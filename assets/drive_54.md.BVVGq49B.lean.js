There are three possible positional relationships between a line and a circle, which can be determined by comparing d and r: d > r, the line and the circle are separate; d=r, the line is tangent to the circle; d < r, the line intersects the circle (d represents the distance from the center of the circle to the line, r represents the radius of the circle). By using the distance from the center of the circle to the line x-y-b=0 being less than the radius, we can find the range of b. **Solution** Given the circle (x-2)^{2}+y^{2}=1, the center of the circle is at (2,0), and the radius is 1.

Prove that no matter how these 11 dominoes are placed, it is always possible to place one more domino.","output":"1. Consider a 6 times 6 chessboard, where 11 dominoes each covering two squares are placed. Given that these 11 dominoes cover (11 times 2 = 22) squares, there are thus (36 - 22 = 14) empty squares. 2. Let's analyze the structure with the assumption that it is impossible to place another (1 times 2) domino in the remaining space. 3. If any row contains 4 or more empty squares, at least two consecutive empty squares must exist because a single row has only 6 squares. Consequently, one additional domino can be placed in those consecutive empty squares, which contradicts the initial assumption that no more dominoes can fit. Hence, each row can have at most 3 empty squares. 4. Therefore, with 14 empty squares and each row containing at most 3 empty squares, we specifically examine the possible configurations over the first 5 rows:    - Maximum empty squares in 5 rows: (5 text{ rows} times 3 text{ empty squares/row} = 15) empty squares.    - Given that there are 14 empty squares in total, at least one additional empty square should exist in the last row detailing our contradiction. 5. Now, Introduce sets (X) and (Y):    - (X): Set of empty squares excluding the top row, a 5 times 6 sub-board.    - (Y): Set of 5 times 6 spaces currently occupied by the dominoes. 6. Establish a function ( f: X to Y ):    - (x = text{empty square})    - (y = text{domino covering space directly above (x)})     7. Properties of function (f):    - Since no additional domino fits, each empty square in (X) uniquely pairs with a domino in (Y). If an empty square’s space above is also empty, it would mean two consecutive empty squares, allowing another domino placement, forming a contradiction.    - Different empty squares pair with different dominoes, otherwise their corresponding spaces could themselves form additional admissible empty spaces globally for more dominoes. 8. Result Group Assertions:    - Sets (X) and (Y) are in bijection and consist of 11 elements each.    - Since (X cup text{last row empty squares} = 14) and considering any empty square configurations up to the 5th row, it follows ( vert X vert geq 11). 9. Counting comparison and proof of contradiction:    - From above, (|X| leq 11).    - Considering domain (|Y| leq 11).     10. Both sides must reflect onto remaining summed empty count assessments, (14 geq 11leq Y). Therefore, it is always possible to place one additional (1 times 2) domino apart from the 11 placed on a (6 times 6) board.

The function g(x) = 2 - sqrt{4-x^2} represents a vertical stretch by a factor of 2 of the upper hemisphere of a circle with radius 2 centered at (0, 2). Therefore, it extends from x = -2 to x = 2 on the x-axis. Reflecting y = g(x) across y=x, we get the function x = g(y) = 2 - sqrt{4-y^2}. The enclosed region between these two graphs originates from the intersection of the circle's upper and lower halves, each modified by the function. The area enclosed by the original function and its reflection is determined by calculating the area of a circle with radius 2 and subtracting the area outside the intersection. The entire circle's area is pi cdot 2^2 = 4pi. Each function covers exactly half of the circle's area, minus the area of the triangular regions formed between the intersection points and the axes. Each quarter-circle (two intersections) has an area of frac{1}{4} times 4pi = pi. The triangular area subtracted from each quarter-circle is frac{1}{2} times 2 times 2 = 2. Therefore, each enclosed region has an area of pi - 2. Since there are two such regions, the total area is 2(pi - 2). Thus, the total enclosed region has an area of 2pi - 4.

Since C = D + N, and C - frac{3N}{2} + D + frac{N}{2} = 100, substituting D = 50 gives:    [    (50 + N) - frac{3N}{2} + 50 + frac{N}{2} = 100    ]    Simplifying and solving for N:    [    100 + N - N = 100 quad Rightarrow quad N = 0    ]    This indicates no change in temperature (N=0), which fits the setup conditions. Thus, N=0 is the value that satisfies the conditions given. Conclusion with boxed answer: The value of N is 0. The final answer is boxed{A}."},{"instruction":"Dave had 21 apps on his phone.

Since x can complete the work in 20 days, x's work rate is 1/20 of the work per day. Since y can complete the work in 12 days, y's work rate is 1/12 of the work per day. Now, let's calculate the amount of work x does in the first 4 days before y joins: x's work in 4 days = 4 * (1/20) = 1/5 of the work. The remaining work after x has worked for 4 days is: 1 - 1/5 = 4/5 of the work. Now, let's calculate the combined work rate of x and y working together: x's work rate + y's work rate = 1/20 + 1/12 = (3 + 5) / 60 = 8/60 = 2/15 of the work per day. Now we need to find out how many days it takes for x and y to complete the remaining 4/5 of the work together: Let the number of days they work together be d.

We start by proving a lemma. **Lemma.** Let left(frac{b'}{a'}, frac{d'}{c'}right) and left(frac{b''}{a''}, frac{a''}{c''}right) be two points with rational coordinates where the fractions given are irreducible. If both a' and c' are odd and the distance between the two points is 1, then it follows that a'' and c'' are odd, and that b' + d' and b'' + d'' are of different parity. **Proof:** 1. Let frac{b}{a} and frac{d}{c} be irreducible fractions such that:    [    frac{b'}{a'} - frac{b''}{a''} = frac{b}{a} quad text{and} quad frac{d'}{c'} - frac{d''}{c''} = frac{d}{c}    ] 2. Given that the distance between the two points is 1, we have:    [    left(frac{b}{a}right)^2 + left(frac{d}{c}right)^2 = 1    ] 3. Multiplying by a^2 c^2 on both sides:    [    b^2 c^2 + a^2 d^2 = a^2 c^2    ] 4. Since (a, b) = 1 and (c, d) = 1, the numbers a and c must be the same (since a mid c and c mid a), thus a = c:    [    b^2 + d^2 = a^2    ] 5. Because a is mutually co-prime to b and d, both b and d must be odd, as they would otherwise share a common factor with a (which would contradict the co-primality condition). 6. Let:     [     frac{b''}{a''} = frac{b}{a} + frac{b'}{a'} quad text{and} quad frac{d''}{c''} = frac{d}{c} + frac{d'}{c'}     ] 7. From frac{b''}{a''}:    [    a'' mid a cdot a'    ]    and from frac{d''}{c''}:    [    c'' mid c cdot c'    ]    Given a and c are odd, it follows that a'' and c'' are both odd. 8. Considering mod 2:    [    b'' equiv b + b' pmod{2} quad text{and} quad d'' equiv d + d' pmod{2}    ] 9. Hence,    [    b'' + d'' equiv b' + d' + b + d pmod{2}    ]    Since b + d is odd, we get:    [    b' + d' text{ and } b'' + d'' text{ are of different parity.}    ] Without loss of generality, start at the origin (0, 0). Initially, b' + d' = 0. For each subsequent point along the broken line, b + d changes parity as proven in the lemma. Therefore, after an odd number of steps, it is impossible for b + d to return to being even (since b + d will be odd). Conclusively, it is impossible to return to the origin after an odd number of steps. Thus, it is impossible to draw such a closed broken line. blacksquare"},{"instruction":"The inscribed circle of the triangle  ABC  is tangent to the sides  BC, AC  and  AB  at points  D, E  and  F , respectively.

By observing these geometrical characteristics, which indicate diagonals of parallelograms with sides 1, 2, and so forth, we comprehend that (AM = BM = CM). 3. Because median ( AC ) of the triangle divides segment ( AB ) in half, the given arrangement forms a right triangle. 4. Therefore, angle ( ACB ) in triangle ( ABC ) measures ( 90^circ ). # Conclusion: [ boxed{90^circ} ]"},{"instruction":"Prove that there does not exist a ring with exactly 5 regular elements.\\r (  a  is called a regular element if   ax equal{} 0  or   xa equal{} 0  implies   x equal{} 0 .)\\r \\r A ring is not necessarily commutative, does not necessarily contain unity element, or is not necessarily finite.","output":"1. **Define Regular Elements and Set ( G )**:    A regular element ( a ) in a ring ( R ) is defined such that if ( ax = 0 ) or ( xa = 0 ) implies ( x = 0 ). Let ( G ) be the set of all regular elements in ( R ). 2. **Closure Under Multiplication**:    The set ( G ) is closed under multiplication. This means if ( a, b in G ), then ( ab in G ). 3. **Injectivity and Surjectivity**:    For any ( a in G ), the left-multiplication map ( L_a: G to G ) defined by ( L_a(x) = ax ) is injective. Since ( G ) is finite, injectivity implies surjectivity. Similarly, the right-multiplication map ( R_a: G to G ) defined by ( R_a(x) = xa ) is also bijective. 4. **Group Structure**:    Since both left and right multiplications are bijective, ( G ) forms a group under multiplication. Given ( |G| = 5 ), ( G ) is a cyclic group of order 5, isomorphic to ( C_5 ). 5. **Existence of Identity**:    In ( G ), there exists an identity element ( 1 ) such that ( 1a = a1 = a ) for all ( a in G ). Note that ( 1 ) is not necessarily the identity in ( R ). 6. **Subgroup and Lagrange's Theorem**:    The subgroup ( {1, -1} ) of ( G ) must satisfy Lagrange's theorem. Since ( G ) has order 5, ( -1 ) must be equal to ( 1 ), implying ( 1 = -1 ). 7. **Ring Homomorphism**:    Consider the ring homomorphism ( Phi: mathbb{F}_2[X] to R ) defined by ( Phi(1) = 1 ) and ( Phi(X) = c ) for some ( c in G ). The image ( S ) of ( Phi ) is a subring of ( R ) with identity ( 1 ). 8. **Units in ( S )**:    Every regular element of ( R ) is a unit in ( S ). Conversely, any unit ( a ) in ( S ) must be a regular element in ( R ). If ( xa = 0 ) for some ( x neq 0 ), then ( x1 = xab = 0 ), contradicting ( 1 in G ). 9. **Order of ( c )**:    Since ( G ) is cyclic of order 5, ( c^5 = 1 ). The kernel of ( Phi ) contains ( X^5 - 1 = (X - 1)(X^4 + X^3 + X^2 + X + 1) ). 10. **Minimal Polynomial**:     Let ( zeta ) be a root of ( X^4 + X^3 + X^2 + X + 1 ) over ( mathbb{F}_2 ). Then ( mathbb{F}_2(zeta) = mathbb{F}_{2^n} ) for some ( n leq 4 ). By Lagrange's theorem, ( 5 ) divides ( 2^n - 1 ), implying ( n = 4 ). 11. **Chinese Remainder Theorem**:     Using the Chinese Remainder Theorem, ( S ) is isomorphic to a factor ring of ( mathbb{F}_2[X]/(X^5 - 1) cong mathbb{F}_2[X]/(X - 1) times mathbb{F}_2[X]/(X^4 + X^3 + X^2 + X + 1) cong mathbb{F}_2 times mathbb{F}_{16} ). 12. **Contradiction**:     The ring ( S ) has either 1 or 15 units, contradicting the assumption that ( S ) has exactly 5 units.

A: Sufficient but not necessary condition B: Necessary but not sufficient condition C: Necessary and sufficient condition D: Neither necessary nor sufficient conditio","output":"To solve this problem, we first need to understand what it means for one condition to be sufficient, necessary, or both, for another condition. A condition is considered sufficient for another if whenever the first condition is true, the second is also true. It is necessary if the second condition cannot be true without the first being true as well.  Let's start by analyzing the inequality x^{2}-5x+6 gt 0. 1. Factor the quadratic equation:  [x^{2}-5x+6 = (x-2)(x-3)] 2. Find the critical points by setting each factor equal to zero:  [x-2=0 Rightarrow x=2] [x-3=0 Rightarrow x=3] 3. Determine the intervals that satisfy the inequality by testing values around the critical points:    - For x<2, let's test x=1:     [(1-2)(1-3) = 1(2) > 0]    - For 2<x<3, let's test x=2.5:     [(2.5-2)(2.5-3) = 0.5(-0.5) < 0]    - For x>3, let's test x=4:     [(4-2)(4-3) = 2(1) > 0] From these tests, we see that the solution set for x^{2}-5x+6 gt 0 is A:(-infty,2) cup (3,+infty). Now, let's analyze the condition \\"x > 3\\": - The set for x > 3 is B:(3,+infty). Comparing set A and set B: - Set B is included in part of set A. This means that whenever x > 3, x^{2}-5x+6 is indeed greater than 0. However, there are values not included in B (specifically, those in (-infty,2)) that also satisfy the inequality. Therefore, \\"x > 3\\" is a condition that is sufficient for \\"x^{2}-5x+6 gt 0\\" because if \\"x > 3\\" is true, then \\"x^{2}-5x+6 gt 0\\" is also true. However, it is not necessary since \\"x^{2}-5x+6 gt 0\\" can still be true even if \\"x > 3\\" is not (e.g., for any x less than 2).

To show that there are infinitely many lovely numbers, we can provide a sequence of integers that meets the definition of a lovely number. Let's consider a sequence of numbers of the form: [ n = d_1 d_2 ldots d_k quad text{where} quad d_i mid n + d_i quad text{and} quad d_i^2 mid n + d_i quad text{for all} quad i in {1, 2, ldots, k}. ] Let’s consider the following set of divisors: (d_1 = 1, d_2 = 2, d_3 = 2,ldots,d_k = 2). In this case, (n = 2^{k-1}) for some (k geq 1). Now, we need to check the conditions of being lovely for each (d_i): 1. For (d_1 = 1), (d_1 mid (n + 1)), i.e., (1 mid (2^{k-1} + 1)), which is clearly true. 2. For (d_i = 2) (for (i geq 2)), we have (d_i mid (n + d_i)), i.e., (2 mid (2^{k-1} + 2)), which is also true as long as (k ) is at least 1. Moreover, checking the second condition (d_i^2 mid (n + d_i)): 1. For (d_1 = 1), (d_1^2 mid (n + d_1)), i.e., (1 mid (2^{k-1} + 1)), which is obviously true. 2.

To check if there is a lovely number which is a square of an integer, suppose (n = m^2) for some integer (m). We need (d_i^2 mid (m^2 + d_i)) for all divisors (d_i) such that (d_1 d_2 ldots d_k = n). Given that (d_i^2 mid (m^2 + d_i)), we can write: [ m^2 + d_i = k d_i^2 quad text{for some integer} quad k ] Rearranging, we get: [ m^2 = k d_i^2 - d_i quad Rightarrow quad m^2 = d_i (k d_i - 1) ] For this to be true, (d_i) must divide (m^2), which implies (d_i) should be a divisor of (m). Hence, we set (d_i = g) for simplicity: [ m^2 = g (kg - 1) ] Checking for solutions, let’s consider (m = 2). Then (n = m^2 = 4): 1. Divisors of 4 are 1, 2, 4. 2. (d_1 = 1): (1^2 mid (4 + 1) Rightarrow 1 mid 5) (true) 3. (d_2 = 2): (2^2 mid (4 + 2) Rightarrow 4 mid 6) (false) Since it does not satisfy, we try larger (m). For example, (m = 3), (n = 9) also fails these conditions. Finally, if we theorize and check various analyses, there isn’t reasonable (m > 1) making (n = m^2) satisfying conditions (d_i^2 mid (m^2 + d_i)) without contradiction being uncovered under current math property constraints. # Conclusion: There does not exist a lovely number greater than 1 which is a square of an integer.

Thus, for 30 people, the total number of possible birthday combinations, assuming birthdays are distributed uniformly, is:    [    365^{30}    ] 2. **Number of favorable outcomes (no shared birthdays):**    We calculate the number of ways in which all 30 people can have different birthdays.        - The first person can have a birthday on any of the 365 days.    - The second person can then have a birthday on any of the remaining 364 days.    - The third on any of the remaining 363 days, and so on.

Each side of the octagon will align with at least one side of a parallelogram. Due to the finite number of parallelograms, and each parallelogram’s side matching another side, eventually, the sides will coincide with the sides of the octagon. 2. **Orientation of Parallelograms**:     - The sides of the parallelograms in the decomposition must be parallel to some of the sides of the octagon.     Consider the side AB of the octagon. Parallelograms must attach to AB, and the total length of the parallelograms' sides along AB must equal 1. Similarly, the sides of these parallelograms parallel to AB must sum up to the same length (1), propagating until side FE parallel to AB is reached. 3. **Area of Formed Regions**:     - The parallelograms form a connected region (shown in the figure as a non-convex octagon ABCDEF{D_1}{C_1}) such that its slices parallel to AB are equal to the length of AB, which remains independent of the decomposition.      The area of this region – effectively the area of rectangle ABEF – is 1+sqrt{2}. 4. **Initial and Remaining Parallelograms**:     - If we remove these parallelograms, the remaining area will fit parallelograms that add to a total area also independent of the decomposition. For instance, consider the remaining area forming hexagon AC{C_1}{D_1}FGH.     The region formed by the parallelograms parallel to GH within this hexagon has an area of sqrt{2}, corresponding to the area of rectangle {GH{C_1}{D_1}}. Since the hexagon's total area is (1 + sqrt{2}), the remaining area, not yet accounted for, is 1. 5. **Rational vs. Irrational Areas**:     - The individual area t of each parallelogram must necessarily be a rational number because the remaining region must be an integer multiple of t:       [       1 = k cdot t quad text{for some integer} quad k       ]          - The entire area of the octagon is 2+2sqrt{2}, which must also match the total area of all parallelograms.

The f-factor theorem states that a bipartite graph G with bipartition (A, B) has an f-factor if and only if the following conditions are satisfied: 1. (sum_{v in A} f(v) = sum_{v in B} f(v)) 2. (sum_{v in X} f(v) leq m(X, Y) + sum_{v in B - Y} f(v)) for all (X subseteq A) and (Y subseteq B), where (m(X, Y)) is the number of edges connecting (X) with (Y). Given: - There are n boys and n girls. - Each boy has at most d girlfriends. - Each girl has at most d boyfriends. - We need to show that it is possible to introduce some of them to make each boy have exactly 2d girlfriends and each girl have exactly 2d boyfriends. Let's denote the set of boys by B and the set of girls by G. We need to construct a bipartite graph G = (B cup G, E) where each boy is connected to at most d girls and each girl is connected to at most d boys. To achieve the desired configuration, we will consider the complementary bipartite graph overline{G}, where an edge exists between a boy and a girl if and only if it does not exist in the original graph G. In overline{G}, each boy is connected to at least n - d girls, and each girl is connected to at least n - d boys. We need to find an f-factor in overline{G} such that each boy and each girl has degree 2d. Define the function f on the vertices of overline{G} as follows: - (f(v) = 2d) for all (v in B cup G). We need to verify the conditions of the f-factor theorem for overline{G}: 1. **Sum of degrees condition:**    [    sum_{v in B} f(v) = sum_{v in B} 2d = 2dn    ]    [    sum_{v in G} f(v) = sum_{v in G} 2d = 2dn    ]    Thus, (sum_{v in B} f(v) = sum_{v in G} f(v)). 2. **Hall's condition:**    For any subsets (X subseteq B) and (Y subseteq G), we need to check:    [    sum_{v in X} f(v) leq m(X, Y) + sum_{v in G - Y} f(v)    ]    Since (f(v) = 2d) for all (v), this becomes:    [    2d|X| leq m(X, Y) + 2d|G - Y|    ]    Simplifying, we get:    [    2d|X| leq m(X, Y) + 2d(n - |Y|)    ]    [    2d|X| - 2d(n - |Y|) leq m(X, Y)    ]    [    2d(|X| - (n - |Y|)) leq m(X, Y)    ]    [    2d(|X| - n + |Y|) leq m(X, Y)    ]    Since (m(X, Y)) is the number of edges connecting (X) with (Y) in overline{G}, and each vertex in X is connected to at least n - d vertices in G, we have:    [    m(X, Y) geq |X|(n - d)    ]    Therefore, the condition holds if:    [    2d(|X| - n + |Y|) leq |X|(n - d)    ]    This inequality is satisfied because d < frac{n}{2}, ensuring that the left-hand side is less than or equal to the right-hand side. Since both conditions of the f-factor theorem are satisfied, overline{G} has an f-factor where each boy and each girl has degree 2d.

This gives us two equations based on the expansion of the right-hand side: 1. p + q = b (the coefficient of x) 2. pq = 2008 (the constant term) Given that pq = 2008, we know that both p and q must either be positive or negative. However, since p + q = b and b is positive, it follows that both p and q must be positive. To minimize b = p + q, we need p and q to be as close to each other as possible because the product pq = 2008 is fixed. The prime factorization of 2008 is 2^3 cdot 251, which suggests the closest factors of 2008 in terms of their sum are 8 and 251.

In the sequence ( 1, 3, 5, ldots, 2n - 1 ), the only multiple of ( d ) is ( 2n - 1 ) itself. 2. **Considering Consecutive Odd Integers:**    Next, consider a series of ( 2n - 2 ) consecutive odd numbers starting from ( 2n + 1 ):    [    2n + 1, 2n + 3, 2n + 5, ldots, 2n + 2(2n - 1) - 3.    ]    These numbers are:    [    2n + 1, 2n + 3, 2n + 5, ldots, 6n - 5.    ]    Clearly, each of these numbers is greater than ( 2n - 1 ) and less than ( 3(2n - 1) ).

The factorization of 812 is 2 times 2 times 7 times 29. We look for pairs of factors that differ by 1 (since the roots of the quadratic are x and x+1).

This setup is the same top and bottom. 4. **Calculate (h)**:    - Since the small sphere is (1.5) units from both the bottom and top of the box (due to tangency), the total height (h) must also account for the vertical position of the large sphere's center, which is elevated by the radius of the smaller sphere:    - The height (h) thus needs to accommodate twice the height from the bottom of the box to a point directly above the smaller sphere to the top. Since the small spheres touch the top and bottom and the large sphere is vertically centered about box's horizontal center plane, (h) must be at least twice the radius of the large sphere plus twice the radius of a small sphere (accounting for the upper and lower setting), so (h = 2 times 3 + 2 times 1.5 = 6 + 3 = 9).

The cities and roads form the vertices and edges of a finite graph ( G ) (without loops and multiple edges). By assumption, ( G ) is connected, and each vertex has even order. # Part (a): We need to show that it's possible to orient all edges such that each vertex has the same number of incoming and outgoing edges. 1. **Definition and Lemma:**    - A graph ( G ) is Eulerian if it has a closed Eulerian path, meaning a path that visits every edge exactly once and returns to the starting vertex.    - Lemma: If ( G ) is a finite connected undirected graph where each vertex has an even degree, then ( G ) has an Eulerian circuit. 2. **Proof of Lemma:**    - Begin with an edge ( e ) starting at a vertex ( v_0 ) and follow a path ( v_0 e_1 v_1 e_2 cdots e_n v_n ) in such a way that no edge is repeated, maximizing the path's length.    - Since ( G ) is connected and each vertex has an even degree, the path can always return to ( v_0 ), forming a closed circuit.    - If every edge originating from ( v_n ) has been used in the path, then ( v_0 = v_n ) implies the path is Eulerian.    - Any unused edges prompt extending the path further, contradicting maximality unless all are included. 3. **Closed Eulerian Path:**    - As ( G ) confirms the lemma conditions, it possesses a closed Eulerian path. Orient all edges in the Eulerian path direction.    - Result: ( G ) becomes a directed graph with equal in-degrees and out-degrees at each vertex. **Conclusion of Part (a):**  Due to the Eulerian nature of ( G ), there exists a way to orient edges such that each city (vertex) has an equal number of incoming and outgoing edges.

So,    [    (10^{2019} - 1)^2 = (10^{2019})^2 - 2 times 10^{2019} times 1 + 1^2    ]    This simplifies to    [    10^{4038} - 2 times 10^{2019} + 1    ] 4. **Recognizing the decimal structure:**    - ( 10^{4038} ) is a 1 followed by 4038 zeros.    - ( 2 times 10^{2019} ) is 2 followed by 2019 zeros.    - The arithmetic result then consists of aligning these values correctly to determine their combined effect:    [    10^{4038} - 2 times 10^{2019} + 1 = 999ldots 998000ldots 0000001    ]    where “999…999” has 2018 nines followed by “800…000001” with 2019 zeros. 5. **Counting the zeros in the result:**    Hence, the total number of zeros, as observed, is exactly 2018 (from the “8000…000001” part). 6. **Conclusion:**    The number of zeros in the result of ( 999 ldots 999 times 999 ldots 999 ) (each with 2019 nines) is: [ boxed{2018} ]"},{"instruction":"A batsman makes a score of 85 runs in the 11th inning and thus increases his average by a certain amount. His average after the 11th inning is 35. By how much did his average increase?","output":"Let's denote the average after the 10th inning as A and the average after the 11th inning as A+X, where X is the increase in average we want to find. We know that after the 11th inning, the average is 35, so A+X = 35. The total runs scored after the 10th inning can be represented as 10A (since the average is A after 10 innings). After the 11th inning, the total runs scored would be 10A + 85 (since the batsman scored 85 runs in the 11th inning). Now, we can set up an equation using the fact that the average after the 11th inning is 35: (10A + 85) / 11 = 35 Multiplying both sides by 11 to get rid of the fraction, we get: 10A + 85 = 11 * 35 10A + 85 = 385 Now, we can solve for A, the average after the 10th inning: 10A = 385 - 85 10A = 300 A = 300 / 10 A = 30 So, the average after the 10th inning was 30. We already know that the average after the 11th inning is 35, so the increase in average is: X = 35 - 30 X = 5 The average increased by boxed{5}  runs."},{"instruction":"The diagonals of a regular octagon have different lengths.

Let's label vertices of the octagon sequentially from ( A ) to ( H ). - The diagonals ( AB ) and ( AC ) are of interest. - The angle ( angle BAC ) is formed by extending sides from vertex ( A ) to vertices ( B ) and ( C ) respectively. Since ( A ) to ( B ) is one side, ( angle BAC ) would then be equal to ( 135^circ - 45^circ = 90^circ ). Since ( angle BAC = 90^circ ), the triangle ( ABC ) is a right triangle. In a regular octagon, the side length and the shorter diagonal form a right triangle with the longer diagonal (from center to a vertex not adjacent but one apart). By applying the Pythagorean theorem: - Let side length = ( s ), - Shorter diagonal ( = ssqrt{2} ) (since ( angle BAC = 90^circ ) in a square formed by two adjacent sides), - Longer diagonal spans from one vertex to the opposite, not adjacent, ( sqrt{2s^2 + 2s^2} = ssqrt{4} = 2s ). The ratio of the shorter diagonal to the longer diagonal is: [ frac{ssqrt{2}}{2s} = frac{sqrt{2}}{2} = frac{1}{sqrt{2}} = frac{sqrt{2}}{2} ] Thus, the ratio of the lengths of the shorter diagonal to the longer diagonal in a regular octagon is ( boxed{frac{sqrt{2}}{2}} )."},{"instruction":"The derivative of the function f(x)=sin (x) is f'(x)=cos x.

Since the length of the major axis is sqrt{2} times the length of the minor axis, a = sqrt{2}b. Using the relationship a^2 = b^2 + c^2, we get a^2 = b^2 + 1. Solving these, we find a = sqrt{2} and b = 1. Thus, the standard equation of the ellipse is: boxed{frac{x^2}{2} + y^2 = 1}. (2) Let points A and B on the ellipse be A(x_1, y_1) and B(x_2, y_2), respectively. Then vec{PA} cdot vec{PB} = (x_1 - 2, y_1) cdot (x_2 - 2, y_2) = (x_1 - 2)(x_2 - 2) + y_1y_2. When line l is perpendicular to the x-axis, x_1 = x_2 = -1 and y_1 = -y_2, and y_1^2 = frac{1}{2}. In this case, vec{PA} = (-3, y_1) and vec{PB} = (-3, -y_1). Thus, vec{PA} cdot vec{PB} = (-3)^2 - y_1^2 = frac{17}{2}. When line l is not perpendicular to the x-axis, let line l be defined by y = k(x + 1). From the system left{begin{aligned} frac{x^2}{2} + y^2 &= 1  y &= k(x + 1) end{aligned}right., eliminate y to obtain (1 + 2k^2)x^2 + 4k^2x + 2k^2 - 2 = 0. Thus, x_1 + x_2 = -frac{4k^2}{1 + 2k^2} and x_1x_2 = frac{2k^2 - 2}{1 + 2k^2}. Then, vec{PA} cdot vec{PB} = x_1x_2 - 2(x_1 + x_2) + 4 + k^2(x_1 + 1)(x_2 + 1) = (1 + k^2)x_1x_2 + (k^2 - 2)(x_1 + x_2) + 4 + k^2 = (1 + k^2)frac{2k^2 - 2}{1 + 2k^2} - (k^2 - 2)frac{4k^2}{1 + 2k^2} + 4 + k^2 = frac{17k^2 + 2}{2k^2 + 1} = frac{17}{2} - frac{13}{2(2k^2 + 1)} < frac{17}{2}.

To solve the inequality f(x) leqslant 9, where f(x) = |2x-4| + |x+1|, we consider the absolute value expressions separately and analyze the function piecewise. This involves considering the critical points where each absolute value expression changes from positive to negative or vice versa, which are x=2 and x=-1. Thus, we have three cases to consider based on the intervals divided by these critical points:    - For x > 2, both 2x-4 and x+1 are positive, so f(x) = (2x-4) + (x+1) = 3x-3. Solving 3x-3 leqslant 9 gives 3x leqslant 12, hence x leqslant 4. Combining this with x > 2, we get 2 < x leqslant 4.        - For -1 leqslant x leqslant 2, 2x-4 is negative and x+1 is positive, so f(x) = -(2x-4) + (x+1) = 5-x. Solving 5-x leqslant 9 gives -x leqslant 4, hence x geqslant -1. Combining this with x leqslant 2, we get -1 leqslant x leqslant 2.        - For x < -1, both 2x-4 and x+1 are negative, so f(x) = -(2x-4) - (x+1) = -3x+3. Solving -3x+3 leqslant 9 gives -3x leqslant 6, hence x geqslant -2. Combining this with x < -1, we get -2 leqslant x < -1.        Combining all intervals, the solution set is x in [-2,4]. Therefore, the solution to the inequality f(x) leqslant 9 is boxed{[-2,4]}. 2. For the equation f(x) = -x^2 + a to have solutions in the interval [0,2], we need to find the range of a for which this is true. Given f(x) = |2x-4| + |x+1|, we can rewrite the equation as -x^2 + a = |2x-4| + |x+1|. However, the standard solution directly jumps to a = x^2 - x + 5 for x in [0,2], which seems to be a simplification or misinterpretation of the original problem statement. Instead, we should analyze the function f(x) within the interval [0,2] and compare it to the quadratic function.    Since the correct approach involves analyzing the graph of y = x^2 - x + 5 within the interval [0,2], we find that the minimum value of this function occurs at x = frac{1}{2}, giving a minimum value of y = frac{19}{4}, and the maximum value occurs at the endpoints of the interval, giving a maximum value of y = 7 at x = 2. Therefore, for the equation f(x) = -x^2 + a to have solutions in [0,2], a must lie within the range of y = x^2 - x + 5 for x in [0,2], which is [frac{19}{4}, 7].

The number of 1's for (n = 1) is (leftlfloor frac{1^2 + 1 + 1}{3} rightrfloor = 1).    - For (n = 2), if (a_1 = 0) and (a_2 = 1) the corresponding (b_1 = 1), so both ([a_1, a_2] = [0, 1]) and ([b_1] = [1]), hence the total number of 1's is 2. This fits the formula since (leftlfloor frac{2^2 + 2 + 1}{3} rightrfloor = 2). 2. **Induction Hypothesis**:    Assume that the statement is true for all (k leq n), i.e., the number of 1's in the triangular table of height (k) is at most (leftlfloor frac{k^2 + k + 1}{3} rightrfloor). 3. **Inductive Step**:    We need to show that the number of 1's in a triangular table with (n + 3) rows is at most (leftlfloor frac{(n+3)^2 + (n+3) + 1}{3} rightrfloor).    Consider the rows:    [    a_1, a_2, ldots, a_{n+3}    ]    [    b_1, b_2, ldots, b_{n+2}    ]    [    c_1, c_2, ldots, c_{n+1}    ]    If we examine the three rows, (a_1 b_1 c_1) can either include a zero or three ones:    - If (a_1 b_1 c_1) = (1,1,1), then (a_2) and (b_2) are zero leading to more zeroes in the first few columns.    - Otherwise, at least one zero is present among (a_1 b_1 c_1). 4. **Counting Zeroes**:    - If there are zeroes in the first (n+1) columns, there must be at least (n+1) zeroes in 3 lines.    - If the first (n) columns have at least (n) zeroes, consider (a_{n+1}, b_{n+1}, c_{n+1}):       - If all are ones ((1,1,1)), the next positions (a_{n+2}) and (b_{n+2}) must be zero ((0,0)). 5. **Conclusion**:    Given both conditions, in either scenario, the three lines must have at least (n+2) zeroes, leading to maximum (2(n + 2)) ones in those lines.

This is because the total count of divisors for a number ( n ) is given by considering the exponents in its prime factorization. Each exponent contributes to a factor count.

Thus, the intersection point of the line and the y-axis is (0, 1). Substituting (0, 1) into the parabola y = x^2 - 2x + n, we get n = 1. The parabola's equation is now y = x^2 - 2x + 1 = (x - 1)^2, so the vertex of the parabola is at (1, 0). Substituting (1, 0) into the line y = mx + 1, we get 0 = m + 1, which gives m = -1. Answer: The value of m is -1, and the value of n is 1. (2) Substituting y = 2x - 4 into y = frac{6}{x}, we get 2x - 4 = frac{6}{x}, which simplifies to 2x^2 - 4x - 6 = 0.

Since the vertex lies on the \\"belt line\\", we have frac{4ak - (3k^2 - 2k + 1)^2}{4a} = -pfrac{3k^2 - 2k + 1}{2a} + k, which gives p = frac{3k^2 - 2k + 1}{2}. Setting y=0 in the \\"belt line\\" l: y = frac{3k^2 - 2k + 1}{2}x + k, we get 0 = frac{3k^2 - 2k + 1}{2}x + k, which yields x = -frac{2k}{3k^2 - 2k + 1}.

We can thus form the inequality:    [    n cdot frac{1}{2} k (k - 1) - frac{1}{2} n(n - 1) leq frac{1}{2} n(n-1)    ] 7. Simplifying the inequality:    [    frac{n}{2} k (k-1) - frac{n(n-1)}{2} leq frac{n(n-1)}{2}    ] 8. Multiplying by 2 throughout:    [    n k (k - 1) - n (n - 1) leq n (n - 1)    ] 9. Adding n(n-1) to both sides:    [    n k(k - 1) leq 2n(n - 1)    ] 10. Dividing both sides by n (since n > 0):     [     k(k - 1) leq 2(n - 1)     ] 11. Adding 1 to both sides:     [     k^2 - k + 1 leq 2n - 1     ] 12. Rearranging the terms:     [     k^2 - k - 2n + 2 leq 0     ] 13.

Since sqrt{8n - 7} is slightly less than sqrt{8n}, it's evident:     [     frac{1 + sqrt{8n - 7}}{2} leq frac{1}{2} + sqrt{2n}     ] 15. This completes the proof that:     [     k leq frac{1}{2} + sqrt{2n}     ] Conclusion: [ boxed{k leq frac{1}{2} + sqrt{2n}} ]"},{"instruction":"Pete thinks of a number.

This circle intersects line CA again at point M, and line CB again at point N. 3. **Symmetry and Equal Angles**    - The circle centered at H suggests symmetry with respect to the line containing the altitude AH. Hence, points C and N are symmetric with respect to the altitude AH.    - Since angle AHC = 90^circ - angle ACB = 30^circ (because triangle ABC is acute-angled and angle C = 60^circ), it follows that angle AHC = 30^circ.    - Thus, the circles intersecting lines CA and CB create triangle ACN and triangle BCM. 4. **Triangle Properties for triangle ACN**    - Since angle AHC = 30^circ and symmetry, angle CAN = 60^circ.    - Combining this with angle ANC = 60^circ (because angle C = 60^circ), triangle ACN has two equal angles of 60^circ.    - Therefore, triangle ACN is equilateral, and correspondingly, all sides are equal, suggesting AC = AN = CN. 5. **Triangle Properties for triangle BCM**    - Similarly, by symmetry and equal arcs in the corresponding circle, angle MBC = 60^circ.    - Therefore, triangle BCM also has two equal angles of 60^circ, making it equilateral.    - All sides in triangle BCM are equal, giving BC = BM = CM. 6. **Parallel Lines Confirmation**    - Since triangle ACN and triangle BCM are both equilateral:      [      angle CAN = angle ABC = 60^circ      ]      [      angle BMC = angle ACB = 60^circ      ]    - It follows that lines AN and BM are parallel (or could possibly coincide based on the equilateral properties and the circle's symmetry). # Conclusion: [ boxed{AN parallel BM} ]"},{"instruction":"Let  ABC  be an acute triangle with  angle ABC=60^{circ}.

We need to find the square of the product of all possible lengths of (BC) such that there does not exist a point (D) (different from (A) and not on line (BC)) where the Euler line of (triangle ABC) coincides with the Euler line of (triangle DBC). The result should be expressed in the form (m + nsqrt{p}), where (m), (n), and (p) are positive integers and (p) is not divisible by the square of any prime. Finally, we need to find (100m + 10n + p). 2. **Euler Line and Reflection:**    The Euler line of a triangle passes through several important points, including the orthocenter (H) and the circumcenter (O). For the Euler lines of (triangle ABC) and (triangle DBC) to coincide, certain geometric conditions must be met. Specifically, the reflection of the Euler line of (triangle ABC) across (BC) must intersect the circumcircle of (triangle ABC) at two distinct points. 3. **Complex Number Representation:**    To simplify calculations, we use complex numbers. Let (A = a), (B = b), and (C = c) be points on the unit circle. We set (a = -bc) to ensure that (A) lies on the unit circle. The reflection of the Euler line across (BC) must be tangent to the circumcircle at a point (A'). 4. **Solving for (BC):**    Using the given lengths (AB = 3) and (AC = 4), we set up the equations:    [    AB^2 = |a - b|^2 = 9 quad text{and} quad AC^2 = |a - c|^2 = 16    ]    We also use the fact that the reflection of the Euler line must be tangent to the circumcircle at (A'), leading to the equation:    [    b + c + frac{1}{b} + frac{1}{c} = 2    ]    This simplifies to:    [    cos(beta) + cos(gamma) = 1    ]    where (b = e^{ibeta}) and (c = e^{igamma}). 5. **Calculating Cosines:**    We solve the system of equations:    [    4|a - b| = 3|a - c|    ]    Squaring both sides, we get:    [    16(2 - a/b - b/a) = 9(2 - a/c - c/a)    ]    Substituting (a = -bc), we find:    [    16(2 + c + 1/c) = 9(2 + b + 1/b)    ]    Simplifying, we get:    [    16(1 + cos(gamma)) = 9(1 + cos(beta))    ]    Solving this system, we find:    [    cos(beta) = frac{23}{25} quad text{and} quad cos(gamma) = frac{2}{25}    ] 6. **Finding (BC):**    Using the cosine values, we calculate:    [    BC^2 = |b - c|^2 = 2 - 2cos(beta - gamma)    ]    Using the sine values:    [    sin(beta) = pm frac{4sqrt{6}}{25} quad text{and} quad sin(gamma) = pm frac{3sqrt{69}}{25}    ]    We find:    [    BC^2 = 2 - 2left(frac{23}{25} cdot frac{2}{25} pm frac{4sqrt{6}}{25} cdot frac{3sqrt{69}}{25}right)    ]    Simplifying, we get:    [    BC^2 = frac{1158}{625} pm frac{72sqrt{46}}{625}    ] 7. **Final Calculation:**    The product of all possible lengths of (BC) is:    [    left(frac{1158}{625} + frac{72sqrt{46}}{625}right) cdot left(frac{1158}{625} - frac{72sqrt{46}}{625}right) = 49 + 588sqrt{2}    ]    Therefore, (m = 49), (n = 588), and (p = 2).

Completing the square gives us the standard form of the circle's equation: (x-2)^2+y^2=4, which reveals that the circle has center C(2,0) and radius r=2. The polar equation of the line is pcos θ=1, which can be converted to the Cartesian equation using x=pcos θ: x=1. **Step 2: Find the distance between the circle's center and the line** The distance d between the circle's center C(2,0) and the line x=1 can be calculated using the formula for the distance between a point and a line: d=frac{|Ax_0+By_0+C|}{sqrt{A^2+B^2}}, where (x_0,y_0) is the point and Ax+By+C=0 is the line's equation.

Let ( N ) be the point of intersection of the lines ( AD ) and ( KQ ). 2. Let ( P' ) be the point of intersection of the lines ( KL ) and ( MN ). To prove that the point of intersection of the lines ( KQ ) and ( MP ) lies on the line ( AD ), we apply Desargues' Theorem to triangles ( KBL ) and ( NDM ). 3. By Desargues' Theorem, if two triangles are perspective from a point, then they are perspective from a line and vice versa. We need to show that the lines joining corresponding vertices of triangles ( KBL ) and ( NDM ) are concurrent (intersect at a single point). Here are the corresponding vertices:    - ( K ) with ( N )    - ( B ) with ( D )    - ( L ) with ( M ) 4. We first note the points of intersection of the corresponding sides:    - The lines ( KB ) and ( ND ) intersect at ( Q ).    - The lines ( BL ) and ( DM ) intersect at ( P ).    - The lines ( KL ) and ( MN ) intersect at ( P' ). 5. According to Desargues' theorem, these concurrent intersections imply that the points ( P', A, ) and ( C ) should lie on a straight line. 6. However, since ( A ) and ( C ) already lie on the line ( AC ), this means the point of intersection ( P' ) must also lie on ( AC ). 7. Given that point ( P ) is the intersection of ( KL ) and ( AC ), it follows that necessarily ( P' = P ). Therefore, the intersection of ( KQ ) and ( MP ) lies on the line ( AD ) since the points ( P ) and ( P' ) coincide.

Each pizza must give sufficient information to conclude exactly which subset of toppings Arno likes. 2. **Initial Scenario**:    - There are five toppings: let's label them ( T_1, T_2, T_3, T_4, T_5 ).    - Each pizza can have any subset of these five toppings, and Arno can either approve (\\"yes\\") or disapprove (\\"no\\") each pizza. 3. **Objective**:    Purineqa needs to ensure that, regardless of which subset of toppings Arno likes, the five pizzas must provide enough information to identify that subset. This suggests that each pizza should be constructed in a way that reveals information about individual toppings. 4. **Ideal Set of Pizzas**:    - Let us consider an arrangement where each pizza has exactly one of the toppings.

This implicitly tells us he likes none of the toppings, as he rejected every single topping.    - **Full Inclusion**: Suppose Arno likes some pizzas and dislikes others. This tells us exactly which toppings he likes and which he does not, because each approval or disapproval is isolated to specific toppings. 6. **Counter Argument**:    - If any pizza combination includes more than one topping per pizza, the information about individual topping preference gets convoluted. For instance, if a pizza had (T_1) and (T_2), a \\"no\\" from Arno does not specify if he dislikes (T_1), (T_2), or both.    - Without isolated toppings (one topping per pizza), there isn’t a way to unambiguously confirm or reject the inclusion of specific toppings individually. 7. **Conclusion**:    The only practical and logically sound method for Purineqa is to make five pizzas, each containing exactly one of the five toppings without any repetitions or combinations.

What is the ratio of the profit earned by p to the profit earned by q?","output":"To determine the ratio of the profit earned by p to the profit earned by q, we need to consider the amount each person invested and for how long they invested it. Since the time period for which they invested is not mentioned, we will assume that both invested for the same time period. The profit earned by each investor is typically proportional to the amount they invested. Therefore, the ratio of their profits will be the same as the ratio of their investments. p invested Rs 60,000 and q invested Rs 90,000. The ratio of p's investment to q's investment is: p : q = 60,000 : 90,000 To simplify the ratio, we can divide both numbers by the greatest common divisor of 60,000 and 90,000, which is 30,000. p : q = (60,000 ÷ 30,000) : (90,000 ÷ 30,000) p : q = 2 : 3 Therefore, the ratio of the profit earned by p to the profit earned by q is boxed{2:3} ."},{"instruction":"Set C = {65, 67, 68, 71, 74}.

Its factors are 5 times 13. 2. **67** is a prime number itself. 3. **68** is an even number. Its factors are 2 times 34, where 34 can be further factored into 2 times 17. So, 68 = 2^2 times 17. 4. **71** is a prime number itself. 5. **74** is an even number. Its factors are 2 times 37. From the list, the smallest prime factor encountered is 2, which is the smallest prime number and is a factor of both 68 and 74. Since we are asked for the number with the smallest prime factor, and 2 appears as a factor of 68 and 74, we conclude that both 68 and 74 have the smallest prime factor.

What is the probability that the number of heads is greater than the number of tails?","output":"To find the probability that the number of heads is greater than the number of tails when a fair coin is tossed 4 times, we can calculate the total number of outcomes and the favorable outcomes. Since the coin is fair, each toss has 2 possible outcomes (head or tail), leading to a total of 2^4 = 16 possible outcomes for 4 tosses. For the number of heads to be greater than the number of tails in 4 tosses, there can be 3 heads and 1 tail or 4 heads and 0 tails.  - The number of ways to get 3 heads and 1 tail is binom{4}{3} = 4, because we choose 3 tosses out of 4 to be heads. - The number of ways to get 4 heads is binom{4}{4} = 1, which is simply all tosses being heads. Therefore, the total number of favorable outcomes is 4 + 1 = 5. The probability that the number of heads is greater than the number of tails is the ratio of the favorable outcomes to the total outcomes, which is frac{5}{16}.

From the inequality, we have:    [    f(2) geq 2f(1)    ]    Given ( f(2) = 0 ), we substitute to get:    [    0 geq 2f(1)    ]    This implies:    [    f(1) = 0    ] 3. Next, consider ( m + n = 3 ) with ( m = 2 ):    [    f(3) geq f(2) + f(1)    ]    Substituting the known values ( f(2) = 0 ) and ( f(1) = 0 ), we find:    [    f(3) geq 0 + 0 = 0    ]    Since ( f(3) > 0 ) by given condition, let’s assume ( f(3) = 1 ). 4. Now, assume for any ( k in mathbb{N}^+ ), using the inequality iteratively, we have:    [    f(3k) = f[3(k-1) + 3] geq f[3(k-1)] + f(3) = f[3(k-1)] + 1    ]    Likewise, using the same logic for ( f(3(k-1)) ):    [    f[3(k-1)] = f[3(k-2) + 3] geq f[3(k-2)] + f(3) = f[3(k-2)] + 1    ]    Continuing this process, we get:    [    f(3k) geq f[3(k-1)] + 1 geq f[3(k-2)] + 2 geq cdots geq k    ] 5. Given ( f(3 times 3333) = 3333 ), it is reasonable to hypothesize that if ( k < 3333 ), then:    [    f(3k) = k    ] 6. We now use proof by contradiction. Assume there exists some ( k_0 < 3333 ) such that ( f(3k_0) neq k_0 ). By our inequality:    [    f(3k_0) > k_0    ]    Assuming ( f(3k_n) geq k_0 + 1 ), we would have:    [    f(9999) geq f[(9999 - 3k_0) + 3k_0] geq (3333 - k_0) + (k_0 + 1) > 3333    ]    This result is a contradiction since we know ( f(9999) = 3333 ). 7. Hence, the hypothesis ( f(3k) = k ) should be correct. Specifically:    [    f(3 times 1997) = 1997    ] 8. We know:    ( f(3 times 1997) geq f(2 times 1997) + f(1997) ). As ( f(3 times 1997)=1997 ), it implies:    [    1997 geq 2f(1997) + f(1997) implies 1997 geq 3f(1997) implies f(1997) leq frac{1997}{3} < 666    ] 9. Also,    [    f(1997) = f(1995 + 2) geq f(1995) + f(2) implies f(1997) geq f(3 times 665) + 0 = 665    ] 10. Therefore, comparing both results, we get:     [     f(1997) = 665     ] # Conclusion: (boxed{665})"},{"instruction":"a certain football competition with a scoring system of 3 points for victory, 1 point for a draw, and 0 points for defeat, each team plays 20 matches.

Since all four bells toll together again after 1320 seconds, the interval for the third bell must be a factor of 1320 that is not a factor of 120, because if it were a factor of 120, the bells would have tolled together earlier. Let's find the factors of 1320 that are not factors of 120. The prime factorization of 1320 is: 1320 = 2^3 × 3 × 5 × 11 We already have 2^3 × 3 × 5 in the LCM of 120, so the interval for the third bell must include the prime factor 11 to ensure that the bells toll together again after 1320 seconds and not before.

Relative speed in m/s = 66 kmph * (5/18) m/s per kmph Relative speed in m/s = 66 * 5/18 Relative speed in m/s = 330/18 Relative speed in m/s = 18.333333333333332 m/s Now, we have the relative speed in meters per second and the time in seconds. We can find the length of the train (distance covered by the train to pass the man) by using the formula: Distance = Speed * Time The time taken for the train to pass the man is 10.909090909090908 seconds. Let's use this time to find the distance (length of the train): Length of train = Relative speed in m/s * Time in seconds Length of train = 18.333333333333332 m/s * 10.909090909090908 s Length of train ≈ 200 meters Therefore, the length of the train is approximately boxed{200}  meters."},{"instruction":"Quadrilateral (ABCD), with (BC = CD), is inscribed in circle (Omega).

Prove that ray (overrightarrow{DY}) bisects angle (ZDB).","output":"To prove that the ray overrightarrow{DY} bisects the angle ZDB, let's follow the given approach to show that Y is the incenter of triangle ZDB. 1. **Establish some basic relations:**        - Given that quadrilateral ABCD is inscribed in circle Omega, and BC = CD, the arcs subtended by BC and CD are equal.    - The point X is the intersection of the diagonals AC and BD.    - The point Y is the intersection of the circumcircle of triangle BCX with segment AB such that Y neq B.    - The point Z is such that the ray overrightarrow{CY} intersects Omega again at Z neq C. 2. **Prove that BY is the internal angle bisector of angle DBZ:**    We need to demonstrate that angle DBY = angle ZBY.         - Since Y lies on the circumcircle of triangle BCX, we know that angle BYC = angle BXC (cyclic properties).    - The angle angle BXC is also equal to angle BDC since X is the intersection of the diagonals. This means angle BYC = angle BDC.    - Since BC = CD, we get angle BDC = angle DBC. Hence, angle BYC = angle DBC.    - This implies that triangle BYD is isosceles with BY = YD, thus dividing angle DBY into equal parts.    Therefore, BY bisects angle DBZ internally. 3. **Prove that ZY is the internal angle bisector of angle BZD:**    Given that BC = CD, the arcs BC and CD on circle Omega are equal. Therefore, angle BZC = angle CZD.    - As Z is on the circumcircle subtending BC and DC, let these arcs be equal, say beta.     - By the property of the circle, angle BZC = angle CZD. Hence, triangle BZD is also isosceles by vertex Z.    - Since Y lies on the circumcircle of triangle BCX, and ZY passes through C, it must bisect angle BZC (and consequently angle BZD).    Thus, ZY bisects angle BZD internally. 4. **Conclusion:**    Since BY and ZY indeed bisect angle DBZ and angle BZD respectively, Y is the incenter of triangle ZDB. Thus, the ray overrightarrow{DY}, which opposite to YD, bisects angle ZDB.

Using the Stolz-Cesaro theorem, we analyze the limit:    [    lim_{n to infty} frac{x_n}{n^b} = lim_{n to infty} frac{x_{n+1} - x_n}{(n+1)^b - n^b}.    ]    Since x_{n+1} - x_n sim a^{1/3} n^{b/3}, we have:    [    lim_{n to infty} frac{a^{1/3} n^{b/3}}{(n+1)^b - n^b}.    ] 7. For large n, (n+1)^b approx n^b + bn^{b-1}, so:    [    (n+1)^b - n^b approx bn^{b-1}.    ]    Therefore,    [    lim_{n to infty} frac{a^{1/3} n^{b/3}}{bn^{b-1}} = lim_{n to infty} frac{a^{1/3}}{b} n^{b/3 - (b-1)} = lim_{n to infty} frac{a^{1/3}}{b} n^{1 - 2b/3}.    ] 8. For the limit to be finite and non-zero, the exponent of n must be zero:    [    1 - frac{2b}{3} = 0 implies b = frac{3}{2}.    ] 9. Substituting b = frac{3}{2}, we get:    [    lim_{n to infty} frac{a^{1/3}}{b} = 1 implies frac{a^{1/3}}{frac{3}{2}} = 1 implies a^{1/3} = frac{3}{2} implies a = left(frac{3}{2}right)^3 = frac{27}{8}.    ] 10.

If t=-frac{1}{2a}in(0,sqrt{2}], i.e., aleq -frac{sqrt{2}}{4}, then Phi(t) is monotonically decreasing on [sqrt{2},2], so h(a)=Phi(sqrt{2})=sqrt{2}. 2. If t=-frac{1}{2a}in(sqrt{2},2), i.e., -frac{sqrt{2}}{4}<a<-frac{1}{4}, then Phi(t) first increases then decreases on [sqrt{2},2], so h(a)=Phi(-frac{1}{2a})=-2a-frac{1}{4a}. 3.

Also, let alpha = angle APC, beta = angle BPD, gamma = angle BPC, and delta = angle APD. Given that cos alpha = frac{4}{5} and cos beta = frac{3}{5}, we can deduce that cos^2 alpha + cos^2 beta = 1. Since alpha and beta are acute angles, it follows that alpha + beta = 90^circ. Consequently, we also have sin alpha = frac{3}{5} and sin beta = frac{4}{5}. Given the equal spacing of points A, B, C, and D, the triangles ABP, BCP, and CDP have equal areas, denoted as K. The area of triangle APC can be calculated as [APC] = frac{1}{2} ac sin alpha = frac{3}{10} ac, which implies that K = frac{1}{2} [APC] = frac{3}{20} ac. Similarly, the area of triangle BPD is [BPD] = frac{1}{2} bd sin beta = frac{2}{5} bd, leading to K = frac{1}{2} [BPD] = frac{1}{5} bd. Thus, we find that K^2 = frac{3}{100} abcd. For triangle APD, we have [APD] = frac{1}{2} ad sin delta, which gives us K = frac{1}{3} [APD] = frac{1}{6} ad sin delta. Since K = [BPC] = frac{1}{2} bc sin gamma, it follows that K^2 = frac{1}{12} abcd sin gamma sin delta. Comparing the expressions for K^2, we get sin gamma sin delta = frac{9}{25}. Given that gamma + delta = alpha + beta = 90^circ, we can substitute delta = 90^circ - gamma into our equation. This substitution yields sin delta = sin (90^circ - gamma) = cos gamma.

In y = sin(2x - frac{pi}{4}), the phase shift is -frac{pi}{4}. A negative phase shift corresponds to a shift to the right in the graph. Since 2x is the original argument for the sine function in y = sin(2x), adding frac{pi}{4} to this argument counteracts the negative phase shift: 2(x + frac{pi}{8}) = 2x + frac{pi}{4}. Solving this equation for the horizontal shift Delta x gives: Delta x = frac{pi}{8}.

Let's break it down step by step: 1. **Case 1: A is the last one.**    - Since A cannot win the championship and B is not the worst, if A is the last, B can be in the second, third, or fourth position. This leaves three options for B.    - The remaining three positions can be filled by C, D, and E in any order.

The number of ways to choose two positions out of three for A and B is binom{3}{2} = 3, and the number of ways to arrange A and B in these two positions is 2! = 2.

We need to prove that ( a_1 + a_2 + ldots + a_n geq -frac{n}{2} ).  First Solution Approach: 2. **Transformation and Sequence Extension**: Note that ( |a_i| = |a_{i-1} + 1| ) implies:    [    a_i^2 = (a_{i-1} + 1)^2    ]    Expanding the right-hand side:    [    a_i^2 = a_{i-1}^2 + 2a_{i-1} + 1    ]    We extend the sequence by one term, defining ( i = 2, 3, ldots, n+1 ). 3. **Summation of Squared Terms**: Summing the squared terms from ( i = 2 ) to ( n+1 ), we get:    [    a_2^2 + a_3^2 + ldots + a_{n+1}^2 = a_1^2 + a_2^2 + a_3^2 + ldots + a_n^2 + 2(a_1 + a_2 + ldots + a_n) + n    ] 4. **Simplifying the Equation**: Since ( a_1 = 0 ), the equation simplifies to:    [    a_{n+1}^2 = 2(a_1 + a_2 + ldots + a_n) + n    ] 5. **Solving for the Sum**: Rearrange to get:    [    a_1 + a_2 + ldots + a_n = frac{a_{n+1}^2 - a_1^2 - n}{2}    ]    Since ( a_1 = 0 ), this reduces to:    [    a_1 + a_2 + ldots + a_n = frac{a_{n+1}^2}{2} - frac{n}{2}    ] 6. **Non-Negativity of Squares**: Noting that ( a_{n+1}^2 geq 0 ), we have:    [    frac{a_{n+1}^2}{2} geq 0    ]    Thus,    [    frac{a_{n+1}^2}{2} - frac{n}{2} geq -frac{n}{2}    ] 7. **Conclusion**: Therefore,    [    a_1 + a_2 + ldots + a_n geq -frac{n}{2}    ]    [    boxed{a_1 + a_2 + ldots + a_n geq -frac{n}{2}}    ]  Second Solution Approach: 1. **Interpreting the Condition**: The condition we need to prove is equivalent to stating that the average value of the given sequence of numbers is not less than (-frac{1}{2}). 2. **Assumption of Negativity**: Assume that the numbers ( a_i ) have at least one negative term; otherwise, the statement holds trivially. 3. **Identifying Critical Points**: Let ( a_k ) be the first non-negative number followed by a negative number in the sequence. Hence ( a_{k+1} < 0 ) and ( a_k geq 0 ).

Some portion of the campers are boys, and the remaining onethird are girls. 50% of the boys want to toast marshmallows and 75% of the girls want to toast marshmallows. They need 56 marshmallows. What is the ratio of boys to the total number of campers?","output":"Let's denote the number of boys as B and the number of girls as G. We know that G is one-third of the total number of campers, so: G = 1/3 * 96 Now, let's calculate the number of girls: G = 32 Since the total number of campers is 96, we can find the number of boys by subtracting the number of girls from the total number of campers: B = 96 - G B = 96 - 32 B = 64 Now we have the number of boys who want to toast marshmallows, which is 50% of the boys: 50% of B = 0.5 * 64 50% of B = 32 boys And the number of girls who want to toast marshmallows, which is 75% of the girls: 75% of G = 0.75 * 32 75% of G = 24 girls The total number of campers who want to toast marshmallows is the sum of boys and girls who want to toast marshmallows: Total marshmallow toasters = 32 boys + 24 girls Total marshmallow toasters = 56 This matches the number of marshmallows needed, so our calculations are consistent. Now, to find the ratio of boys to the total number of campers, we use the number of boys (B) and the total number of campers (96): Ratio of boys to total campers = B : Total Campers Ratio of boys to total campers = 64 : 96 To simplify the ratio, we can divide both numbers by the greatest common divisor, which is 32: Ratio of boys to total campers = (64 ÷ 32) : (96 ÷ 32) Ratio of boys to total campers = 2 : 3 So, the ratio of boys to the total number of campers is boxed{2:3} ."},{"instruction":"Let  A  be the set of positive integers of the form  a^2 +2b^2 , where  a  and  b  are integers and  b neq 0 . Show that if  p  is a prime number and  p^2 in A , then  p in A .","output":"1. **Lemma 1**: If ( w ) is an integer, and if two coprime positive integers ( x ) and ( y ) are such that ( xy ) is a ( w )-th power of a positive integer, then both ( x ) and ( y ) are ( w )-th powers of positive integers.    *Proof of Lemma 1*:     Let ( x = p_1^{a_1} p_2^{a_2} ldots p_k^{a_k} ) be the prime factorization of ( x ), where all ( p_i ) are distinct primes and all ( a_i ) are positive integers for ( i in {1, 2, ldots, k} ). Let ( y = q_1^{b_1} q_2^{b_2} ldots q_l^{b_l} ) be the prime factorization of ( y ), where all ( q_j ) are distinct primes and all ( b_j ) are positive integers for ( j in {1, 2, ldots, l} ).     Since ( x ) and ( y ) are coprime, ( p_i neq q_j ) for every ( i in {1, 2, ldots, k} ) and every ( j in {1, 2, ldots, l} ). Thus, the primes ( p_1, p_2, ldots, p_k, q_1, q_2, ldots, q_l ) are all distinct. Hence, the number ( xy = p_1^{a_1} p_2^{a_2} ldots p_k^{a_k} cdot q_1^{b_1} q_2^{b_2} ldots q_l^{b_l} ) has the prime factorization ( xy = p_1^{a_1} p_2^{a_2} ldots p_k^{a_k} q_1^{b_1} q_2^{b_2} ldots q_l^{b_l} ).    Since ( xy ) is a ( w )-th power of a positive integer, each prime factor in the prime factorization of ( xy ) must appear with an exponent divisible by ( w ). Hence, all integers ( a_1, a_2, ldots, a_k, b_1, b_2, ldots, b_l ) are divisible by ( w ). Therefore, the numbers ( x = p_1^{a_1} p_2^{a_2} ldots p_k^{a_k} ) and ( y = q_1^{b_1} q_2^{b_2} ldots q_l^{b_l} ) are ( w )-th powers of positive integers. Lemma 1 is proven. 2. **Main Proof**:    Since ( p^2 in A ), there exist two integers ( u ) and ( v ) such that ( p^2 = u^2 + 2v^2 ) and ( v neq 0 ). We can assume without loss of generality that ( u ) and ( v ) are both nonnegative (if not, we can substitute ( -u ) for ( u ) or ( -v ) for ( v ) without changing the equation). Since ( v neq 0 ), ( v ) is actually positive. 3. The equation ( p^2 = u^2 + 2v^2 ) becomes ( p^2 - u^2 = 2v^2 ), which rewrites as ( (p - u)(p + u) = 2v^2 ). Thus, ( 2 mid (p - u)(p + u) ). Since 2 is prime, this implies that 2 divides at least one of the integers ( p - u ) and ( p + u ). But if 2 divides one of these integers, it must also divide the other because 2 divides the difference ( (p + u) - (p - u) = 2u ). Thus, 2 divides both integers ( p - u ) and ( p + u ). Hence, ( frac{p - u}{2} ) and ( frac{p + u}{2} ) are integers. 4. We have ( p > u ) since ( p^2 = u^2 + 2v^2 > u^2 ) because ( v ) is positive. 5. The prime ( p ) is odd. If ( p ) were even, then ( p = 2 ), so ( 4 = 2^2 = p^2 = u^2 + 2v^2 ). This implies ( 4 geq 2v^2 ), so ( 2 geq v^2 ), and thus ( v leq sqrt{2} ). Since ( v ) is a positive integer, the only possibility is ( v = 1 ). Then ( 4 = u^2 + 2v^2 = u^2 + 2 cdot 1^2 = u^2 + 2 ) yields ( 2 = u^2 ), which is impossible since 2 is not a perfect square. Therefore, ( p ) must be odd. 6. Since ( p ) is odd, ( p^2 ) is also odd. Since ( p^2 = u^2 + 2v^2 ), this implies that ( u^2 + 2v^2 ) is odd, so ( u^2 ) must be odd, and hence ( u ) is odd. Thus, ( u neq 0 ). Since ( u ) is nonnegative, it follows that ( u ) is positive. We also know that ( v ) is positive. 7. Assume that the two integers ( frac{p - u}{2} ) and ( frac{p + u}{2} ) have a common prime divisor ( q ). Then ( q ) also divides ( frac{p - u}{2} + frac{p + u}{2} = p ). Thus, ( q ) is a prime divisor of ( p ). Since ( p ) is a prime, the only prime divisor of ( p ) is ( p ) itself. Hence, ( q = p ). Therefore, ( p ) is a common prime divisor of ( frac{p - u}{2} ) and ( frac{p + u}{2} ). Thus, ( p ) also divides ( frac{p + u}{2} - frac{p - u}{2} = u ). Since ( u ) is positive, this implies ( u geq p ). This contradicts ( p > u ). Hence, our assumption that the two integers ( frac{p - u}{2} ) and ( frac{p + u}{2} ) have a common prime divisor was wrong. Therefore, the two integers ( frac{p - u}{2} ) and ( frac{p + u}{2} ) are coprime. 8. Now, we divide the equation ( (p - u)(p + u) = 2v^2 ) by 4 and obtain ( frac{p - u}{2} cdot frac{p + u}{2} = frac{v^2}{2} ). Since ( frac{p - u}{2} ) and ( frac{p + u}{2} ) are integers, this implies that ( frac{v^2}{2} ) is an integer, so ( v^2 ) is even, and hence ( v ) is even. Thus, ( v = 2V ) for some integer ( V ). Since ( v ) is positive, ( V ) is positive as well. 9. Thus, ( frac{p - u}{2} cdot frac{p + u}{2} = frac{v^2}{2} = frac{(2V)^2}{2} = 2V^2 ). Hence, ( 2 mid frac{p - u}{2} cdot frac{p + u}{2} ). Since 2 is a prime, it follows that 2 divides at least one of the numbers ( frac{p - u}{2} ) and ( frac{p + u}{2} ). We will only deal with the case when 2 divides ( frac{p - u}{2} ); the case when 2 divides ( frac{p + u}{2} ) is analogous and left to the reader. 10. Since 2 divides ( frac{p - u}{2} ), the number ( frac{p - u}{2}/2 = frac{p - u}{4} ) is an integer; besides, it is positive (since ( p > u )). Now, dividing the equation ( frac{p - u}{2} cdot frac{p + u}{2} = 2V^2 ) by 2, we get ( frac{p - u}{4} cdot frac{p + u}{2} = V^2 ). 11. Now, ( frac{p - u}{4} ) and ( frac{p + u}{2} ) are two coprime positive integers (we know they are positive integers, and they are coprime because ( frac{p - u}{2} ) and ( frac{p + u}{2} ) are coprime). Since ( frac{p - u}{4} cdot frac{p + u}{2} = V^2 ) is the 2nd power of a positive integer, Lemma 1 implies that both ( frac{p - u}{4} ) and ( frac{p + u}{2} ) are 2nd powers of positive integers. Hence, there exist positive integers ( lambda ) and ( mu ) such that ( frac{p - u}{4} = lambda^2 ) and ( frac{p + u}{2} = mu^2 ). 12. Thus, ( p = frac{p + u}{2} + 2 cdot frac{p - u}{4} = mu^2 + 2lambda^2 ). Since ( lambda neq 0 ) (because ( lambda ) is positive), this implies ( p in A ), and the problem is solved.

Speed in meters per second (m/s) = Speed in kilometers per hour (kmph) × (1000 meters / 1 kilometer) × (1 hour / 3600 seconds) Speed in m/s = 72 × (1000 / 1) × (1 / 3600) Speed in m/s = 72 × (1000 / 3600) Speed in m/s = 72 × (5 / 18) Speed in m/s = 20 m/s Now that we have the speed in meters per second, we can calculate the distance the train travels while crossing the platform. Distance = Speed × Time Distance = 20 m/s × 25 s Distance = 500 meters This distance is the combined length of the train and the platform. Since we know the length of the train is 120 meters, we can find the length of the platform by subtracting the length of the train from the total distance. Length of the platform = Total distance - Length of the train Length of the platform = 500 meters - 120 meters Length of the platform = 380 meters Therefore, the length of the platform is boxed{380}  meters."},{"instruction":"Find the integer that is closest to 1000sum_{n=3}^{10000}frac1{n^24}.","output":"To solve for the integer closest to 1000sum_{n=3}^{10000}frac1{n^2-4}, we start by simplifying the fraction within the sum: [ frac{1}{n^2-4} = frac{1}{(n-2)(n+2)} = frac{1}{4}left(frac{1}{n-2} - frac{1}{n+2}right). ] This simplification allows us to see that the sum is telescoping.

Since she can run up 1 story in 10 seconds, it will take her 20 stories * 10 seconds/story = 200 seconds to reach the top. Now, we know that the slower one took 220 seconds to reach the top. Since Lola took 200 seconds, Tara must be the slower one, taking 220 seconds with the elevator. The elevator takes 8 seconds to go up one story, so for 20 stories, it would take 20 stories * 8 seconds/story = 160 seconds if it didn't stop. Since Tara took 220 seconds to reach the top and the elevator takes 160 seconds without stops, the difference must be due to the elevator stopping on each floor.  The total time spent stopping is 220 seconds - 160 seconds = 60 seconds. The elevator stops on every floor except the top one, so it stops on 19 floors (since it doesn't stop on the 20th floor, where it ends). Therefore, the elevator stops for 60 seconds / 19 stops = 3.16 seconds per stop.

The ratio of the angles (angle AKB) to (angle CKB) is (4:5).     2. First, we assume that (angle AKB = 4x) and (angle CKB = 5x).     3. Given that ( angle AKB + angle CKB = 180^circ ) (since ( BK ) is the angle bisector and we are working with supplementary angles), we can write:    [    4x + 5x = 180^circ     ]    Simplifying this, we get:    [    9x = 180^circ     ]    Thus:    [    x = frac{180^circ}{9} = 20^circ    ]     4.

Since the front of the train exits the tunnel 3 minutes after it entered, we calculate the distance it traveled in that time: - Time = 3 minutes - Distance traveled = Speed times Time = 1 text{ mile per minute} times 3 text{ minutes} = 3 text{ miles}. At this point, the entire train has just cleared the tunnel, meaning the tail end is at the tunnel's exit and the front is 1 mile beyond the exit. This is because the train itself is 1 mile long.

Now, let's examine the elements of T in the context of S: - **When n is even**, we can express n as n=2k for some integer k. Substituting this into the formula for s, we get s=2(2k)+1=4k+1. This shows that when n is even, elements of the form 4k+1 are in both S and T. - **When n is odd**, we express n as n=2k+1. Substituting this into the formula for s, we get s=2(2k+1)+1=4k+3.

From the analysis above, we see that all elements of T (which are of the form 4n+1) are also in S since they correspond to the case when n is even.

Find the area of the rhombus.","output":"Given that the side length of a rhombus is 5 and one of its diagonals is 8, we aim to find the area of the rhombus. First, let's recall that a rhombus is a type of parallelogram where all sides have equal length, and its diagonals bisect each other at right angles. Knowing one diagonal allows us to use the Pythagorean theorem to find the half-length of the other diagonal, since each half of the rhombus (divided by the given diagonal) forms a right-angled triangle. Given: - Side length (s) = 5 - One diagonal (d_1) = 8 The half-length of d_1 is frac{d_1}{2} = frac{8}{2} = 4. To find the half-length of the other diagonal (d_2), we use the Pythagorean theorem in one of the right-angled triangles formed by the diagonals: [s^2 = left(frac{d_1}{2}right)^2 + left(frac{d_2}{2}right)^2] Substituting the known values: [5^2 = 4^2 + left(frac{d_2}{2}right)^2] Solving for frac{d_2}{2}: [25 = 16 + left(frac{d_2}{2}right)^2] [left(frac{d_2}{2}right)^2 = 9] [frac{d_2}{2} = 3] Therefore, the full length of the other diagonal (d_2) is 2 times 3 = 6. Finally, the area of the rhombus can be calculated using the formula for the area of a rhombus, which is half the product of its diagonals: [Area = frac{1}{2} times d_1 times d_2] Substituting the known values: [Area = frac{1}{2} times 8 times 6] [Area = 4 times 6] [Area = 24] Therefore, the area of the rhombus is boxed{24}."},{"instruction":"For ( k, n in mathbf{Z}_{+} ), consider the finite sequence ({a_k}) of length ( n ) with ( a_k leq m ) and ( a_k, m in mathbf{Z}_{+} ).

This can happen in two scenarios: both digits are even, or both are odd. 1. **Both digits are even:** Since we have 3 even numbers (2, 4, 6), there are 3 choices for the units place and 2 choices for the tens place after choosing the units place. For the hundreds and thousands places, we have 4 and 3 choices respectively, after selecting digits for the units and tens places. Therefore, the total number of combinations in this scenario is 3 times 2 times 4 times 3 = 72. 2. **Both digits are odd:** Similarly, since we have 3 odd numbers (1, 3, 5), there are 3 choices for the units place and 2 choices for the tens place after choosing the units place. For the hundreds and thousands places, we have 4 and 3 choices respectively, after selecting digits for the units and tens places.

Recognize that frac{overrightarrow{A B}}{|overrightarrow{A B}|} is the unit vector in the direction of overrightarrow{A B}, and similarly, frac{overrightarrow{A C}}{|overrightarrow{A C}|} is the unit vector in the direction of overrightarrow{A C}. 3. Consider the scalar multiple lambda left(frac{overrightarrow{A B}}{|overrightarrow{A B}|} + frac{overrightarrow{A C}}{|overrightarrow{A C}|}right). Let's denote this combined vector sum frac{overrightarrow{A B}}{|overrightarrow{A B}|} + frac{overrightarrow{A C}}{|overrightarrow{A C}|} as overrightarrow{A P_0}.     4. By geometric properties, overrightarrow{A P_0} represents the direction that evenly splits angle B A C. This is because overrightarrow{A P_0} is aligned with the bisector of the angle formed by the unit vectors along overrightarrow{A B} and overrightarrow{A C}. 5. Next, we analyze the trajectory of point P. Since overrightarrow{A P} = lambda overrightarrow{A P_0}, lambda geq 0, this signifies that overrightarrow{A P} is a scaled version of overrightarrow{A P_0} along the angle bisector. 6. Adding overrightarrow{O A} to lambda overrightarrow{A P_0} and using overrightarrow{A P} = overrightarrow{O P} - overrightarrow{O A} = lambda overrightarrow{A P_0} states that point P lies along the line starting from A through the direction of overrightarrow{A P_0}. 7. Conclude that the trajectory or locus of point P must lie on the internal angle bisector of angle B A C, passing through vertex A. 8.

Let the intersection point be denoted by (M). 2. **Line Segment Analysis**:     It is sufficient to consider only the segments (A B) and (C D) on the lines (u) and (v), and focus on the angle region (S) they enclose, since the quadrilateral (ABCD) lies within this region. 3. **Construct New Segments**:    Measure the segments (MU = AB) and (MV = DC) on the rays originating from (M).  4. **Triangle Area Equivalence**:    Since the triangles (PAB) and (PMU) have sides opposite (P) and the heights corresponding to these sides equal, their areas are also equal. Similarly, the triangles (PCD) and (PMV) have equal areas.  5. **Convex Quadrilateral Analysis**:    If point (P) is not inside the triangle (UVM), the vertices (U, P, V, M) form a convex quadrilateral. This quadrilateral can be divided by either the diagonal (UV) or (PM), and the sum of the areas of the resulting parts equals the area of the quadrilateral. 6. **Triangle Division Analysis**:    If (P) is inside the triangle (UVM), then the lines (PU), (PV), and (PM) divide it into three parts, whose total area equals the area of triangle (UVM). The sum of the areas of triangles (PMU) and (PMV) can be found by subtracting the area of triangle (UVP) from the area of triangle (UVM). 7. **Summary of Results**:    The sum of the areas of triangles (PAB) and (PCD) equals the sum or difference of the areas of triangles (UVM) and (UVP) depending on whether (UV) separates points (M) and (P). 8. **Computed Areas**:    For equivalent areas, both sides must be the same:    [    [PAB] + [PCD] = [UVM] pm [UVP]    ]    When point (P) is considered, (P) lies on the investigated geometric locus if and only if it is on the same side of (UV) as point (E).  9. **Geometric Locus Condition**:    If the areas of triangles (UVE) and (UVP) are equal (since they share the same base (UV)), (P) must be equidistant from (UV) as (E). Therefore, (P) lies on the line (e) which is parallel to (UV) passing through (E). 10. **Boundary Condition**:    Since the problem restricts (P) to the interior of quadrilateral (ABCD), the feasible geometric locus is the segment of line (e) that lies within the quadrilateral. 11. **Parallel Lines Case**:     If lines (u) and (v) are parallel, denote the distance between them as (Delta). Let (u(P)) and (v(P)) be the perpendicular distances from point (P) to lines (u) and (v), respectively. The sum of these distances equals (Delta):     [     Delta = u(E) + v(E)     ]     Define ((u(P), v(P))) such that the relationship as extracted from the difference in areas holds:     [     v(P) = v(E)     ]     This implies point (P) must lie at the same distance from the parallel lines (u) and (v), ensuring the same area calculation holds. 12. **Conclusion**:     The geometric locus for (P) in this scenario is the segment of the line parallel to (UV) through (E) that lies inside quadrilateral (ABCD).

We need to find the side length of the largest square given that the area of the cross is (810 , text{cm}^2). 2. **Big Square Construction**:    - Let the side length of the largest (outer) square be (S).    - The cross consists of two large squares and two small squares.    - The large squares are placed such that together, they span the side of the largest square. 3. **Side Length of the Larger Squares**:    - Since the two large squares span the side of the large square, the side of each large square is (frac{S}{2}).    - The area of one large square is thus (left(frac{S}{2}right)^2 = frac{S^2}{4}). 4. **Side Length of the Smaller Squares**:    - The side length relationship is as follows: two large squares plus the side of a small square fit along the side of the large square.    - This implies that the side of each smaller square is (frac{S}{4}).    - The area of one smaller square is thus (left(frac{S}{4}right)^2 = frac{S^2}{16}). 5. **Total Area Calculation**:    - The area of the cross includes 2 large squares and 2 small squares.    - Total area of the two large squares: (2 cdot frac{S^2}{4} = frac{2S^2}{4} = frac{S^2}{2}).    - Total area of the two small squares: (2 cdot frac{S^2}{16} = frac{2S^2}{16} = frac{S^2}{8}). 6. **Summing the Areas**:    - The area of the cross is the sum of the areas of the large and small squares:      [      frac{S^2}{2} + frac{S^2}{8} = frac{4S^2}{8} + frac{S^2}{8} = frac{5S^2}{8}      ] 7. **Equating to Given Area**:    - According to the problem, the area of the cross is given as (810 , text{cm}^2).

For example, numbers like 1, 10, 100, and 1000 all have a sum of digits equal to 1. Writing these numbers helps in minimizing the sum of digits. 4. **Detailed Strategy for Second Player:**     - The second player should respond to any number written by the first player by writing a number that maintains their minimal sum of digits strategy.     - Specifically, the second player should always write the number (1) in response to high digit-sum numbers like (10) or (1000). And write (10) in response to numbers like (100) or (1).      5. **Mathematical Justification:**     - To demonstrate that the second player guarantees a draw or win, observe that after each round, the sum of the digits of the numbers chosen remains minimal.     - The second player’s actions ensure that after every response, the sequence of moves maintains a sum of digits that when tallied remains divisible by 11.     - Specifically, writing the number 1 in response or 10 when needed ensures the sum of the numbers on the board after each turn remains conducive to meeting but not exceeding constraints. 6. **Additional Validation:**     - Check that after each turn, the total sum remains below 10,000, ensuring legality of moves within the game’s confines.     - Since the second player ensures the total sum remains divisible by 11 until the last possible move where 10,000 itself isn’t divisible by 11, this strategic move seamlessly fits within the rules. # Conclusion By using this minimal digits sum strategy, the second player can effectively ensure they don’t lose. With careful choices and maintaining rule adherence, the second player can secure at least a draw or force a victory if the first player makes suboptimal moves.

We have overrightarrow{b} = 2overrightarrow{a} + overrightarrow{BC}. Since overrightarrow{AB} = 2overrightarrow{a} and overrightarrow{BC} is a side of the square, we can write overrightarrow{BC} = overrightarrow{AB}. Therefore, overrightarrow{b} = overrightarrow{AB} + overrightarrow{BC} = overrightarrow{AC}. In a square with side length 2, the diagonal length, which is |overrightarrow{AC}|, equals 2sqrt{2}. Thus, |overrightarrow{b}| = 2sqrt{2}, which shows that statement A is incorrect. **For statement B**: We calculate overrightarrow{a} cdot overrightarrow{b} using the given vectors.

Each circle contributes an equal area, so the total area of intersection is: [ 2 left(frac{9}{4}pi - frac{9}{2}right) = frac{9}{2}pi - 9 ] Thus, the final area of the intersection is boxed{frac{9}{2}pi - 9}."},{"instruction":"There are 50 lines on a plane, 20 of which are parallel to each other.

Given a tetrahedron with one vertex having three edges of lengths ( 9 text{ cm}, 12 text{ cm}, ) and ( 16 text{ cm} ), we can calculate the volume using:    [    V = frac{frac{9 cdot 16}{2} cdot 12}{3}    ]    Simplify step-by-step:    [    V = frac{144 cdot 12}{3}    ]    [    V = frac{1728}{3} = 576 text{ cm}^3    ] 3. Next, consider the tetrahedron with vertex ( D ) and base ( Delta ABC ). The edges ( DB, DC, ) and ( DA ) are mutually perpendicular.    We need to calculate the area of ( Delta ABC ):    - The lengths of sides ( AB, AC, ) and ( BC ) are obtained using the Pythagorean theorem as the edges are perpendicular:    [    AB = sqrt{9^2 + 12^2} = sqrt{81 + 144} = sqrt{225} = 15 text{ cm}    ]    [    AC = sqrt{12^2 + 16^2} = sqrt{144 + 256} = sqrt{400} = 20 text{ cm}    ]    [    BC = sqrt{9^2 + 16^2} = sqrt{81 + 256} = sqrt{337} text{ cm}    ] 4. Given the sides of ( Delta ABC ) are ( 15 text{ cm}, 20 text{ cm}, ) and ( sqrt{337} text{ cm} ), we calculate its area using the cosine rule for the angle ( alpha ) between ( AB ) and ( AC ):    [    cos alpha = frac{15^2 + 20^2 - (sqrt{337})^2}{2 cdot 15 cdot 20}    ]    [    cos alpha = frac{225 + 400 - 337}{2 cdot 15 cdot 20}    ]    [    cos alpha = frac{288}{600} = frac{12}{25}    ]    Using ( sin^2 alpha + cos^2 alpha = 1 ):    [    sin alpha = sqrt{1 - left(frac{12}{25}right)^2} = sqrt{1 - frac{144}{625}} = frac{sqrt{481}}{25}    ] 5. Now calculate the area of ( Delta ABC ):    [    text{Area of } Delta ABC = frac{1}{2} times 15 times 20 times frac{sqrt{481}}{25}    ]    [    = frac{15 cdot 20 cdot sqrt{481}}{50} = frac{300 cdot sqrt{481}}{50} = 6 cdot sqrt{481}    ] 6. Using the first formula for the volume to solve for ( m ) (the height from vertex ( D ) perpendicular to ( Delta ABC )):    [    V = frac{text{Area of } Delta ABC times m}{3} = frac{6 cdot sqrt{481} times m}{3}    ]    [    576 = 2 cdot sqrt{481} times m    ]    Solving for ( m ):    [    m = frac{576}{2 cdot sqrt{481}} = frac{288}{sqrt{481}} approx boxed{6.5658 text{ cm}}    ]"},{"instruction":"f the value of the algebraic expression 3x+7 is 2, then x= boxed{text{▲}}","output":"First, we set up the equation, then move terms, combine like terms, and finally, normalize the coefficient to 1 to find the solution of the equation.

For example, for ( n = 4 ), the partitions are:    [    4, quad 3+1, quad 2+2, quad 2+1+1, quad 1+1+1+1.    ]    Define ( A(pi) ) as the number of times 1 appears in partition pi, and ( B(pi) ) as the number of different integers in the partition pi. For example, for ( n = 13 ) and a partition pi = 1+1+2+2+2+5 ), we have ( A(pi)=2 ) and ( B(pi)=3 ). 2. **Problem Statement:**    We need to show that for any positive integer ( n ), the sum of ( A(pi) ) over all partitions pi of n equals the sum of ( B(pi) ) over all partitions pi of n. 3. **Claim on Sums of ( A(pi) ):**    We claim that for any positive integer ( n ), the sum of ( A(pi) ) over all partitions pi of n is given by:    [    p(n-1) + p(n-2) + cdots + p(0),    ]    where ( p(n) ) denotes the number of partitions of ( n ), and we set ( p(0) = 1 ). 4. **Calculation of the Sum of ( A(pi) ):**    To calculate the sum of ( A(pi) ), note the following observations:    - For each partition of n that includes at least one 1, consider removing its first 1. This implies looking at a partition of ( n-1 ).    - Therefore, partitions of ( n ) where the first number is 1 correspond directly to partitions of ( n-1 ). This gives ( p(n-1) ) such partitions.    - Similarly, removing the second occurrence of 1 from partitions of n corresponds to partitions of ( n-2 ), yielding ( p(n-2) ), and so forth.    - Summing over all such contributions, we get:      [      text{Sum of } A(pi) = p(n-1) + p(n-2) + cdots + p(0).      ] 5. **Verification:**    For the verification, consider that:    - Partitions of ( n ) that have ( k ) occurrences of 1 have their k occurrences counted in sums contributed by partitions of sizes ( n-1, n-2, ldots, n-(k-1) ). 6. **Claim on Sums of ( B(pi) ):**    Next, we need to show the sum of ( B(pi) ) over all partitions pi of n equals ( p(n-1) + p(n-2) + cdots + p(0) ). 7. **Calculation of the Sum of ( B(pi) ):**    For any partition pi_i (where ( i = 1, 2, ldots, p(n) )) containing some number ( d ) ((1 leq d leq n)), create a matrix with ( p(n) ) rows and ( n ) columns.     - Place a checkmark (checkmark) in the d-th column of the i-th row if the partition pi_i contains the number d.    - Each partition pi_i contributes to ( B(pi_i) ) by counting the appearances of numbers ( 1, 2, ldots, n ) in their respective columns.    - Because every number d appears as frequently as partitions of ( n-d ), summing the appearances of checkmarks for each ( d ) gives:      [      p(n-d) quad text{for} quad d = 1, 2, ldots, n.      ] 8. **Conclusion:**    Summing these from 1 to ( n ) yields:    [    p(n-1) + p(n-2) + cdots + p(0).    ]    From the above reasoning and calculations, it follows that:    [    sum A(pi) = sum B(pi) = p(n-1) + p(n-2) + cdots + p(0).    ]    Thus, the equality of the sums is validated.

Cost of eggs = 4 * 2.30 = 9.20 4. Jam: One jar at 3.75. 5. Bacon: One pack at 5.25. Now, let's apply the discounts: 1. Buns: Buy two, get one free. For every three buns, Frank only pays for two.    Number of free buns = 15 / 3 = 5    Cost of buns after discount = (15 - 5) * 0.20 = 10 * 0.20 = 2.00 2. Milk: 2-for-1 deal. For every two bottles, Frank only pays for one.    Number of free milk bottles = 4 / 2 = 2    Cost of milk after discount = (4 - 2) * 2.30 = 2 * 2.30 = 4.60 3. Eggs: 10% discount on the original price.

How many minutes must the cyclist wait until the hiker catches up?","output":"First, let's determine how far ahead the cyclist is from the hiker after 5 minutes. Since the cyclist is traveling at 18 kilometers per hour and the hiker at 4 kilometers per hour, the relative speed between them is 18 - 4 = 14 kilometers per hour. Now, we need to convert the speed to kilometers per minute, since we are dealing with minutes. There are 60 minutes in an hour, so: 14 kilometers per hour / 60 minutes per hour = 0.2333 kilometers per minute. The cyclist travels for 5 minutes at this relative speed, so the distance between the cyclist and the hiker after 5 minutes is: 0.2333 kilometers per minute * 5 minutes = 1.1665 kilometers. Now, the cyclist stops and waits, while the hiker continues to walk at a speed of 4 kilometers per hour, which is: 4 kilometers per hour / 60 minutes per hour = 0.0667 kilometers per minute. To find out how long it takes for the hiker to cover the distance of 1.1665 kilometers at her speed, we divide the distance by her speed: 1.1665 kilometers / 0.0667 kilometers per minute = 17.5 minutes.

Prove that  nleqslant 6 .","output":"1. **Understanding the problem:**    We are given a prime number ( p ) and ( n ) distinct vectors ( overline{v_1}, overline{v_2}, dotsc, overline{v_n} ) in (mathbb{R}^3) with integer coordinates. For any pair of vectors ( overline{v_j} ) and ( overline{v_k} ) (where ( 1 leq j < k leq n )), there exists an integer ( 0 < ell < p ) such that all three coordinates of ( overline{v_j} - ell cdot overline{v_k} ) are divisible by ( p ). We need to prove that ( n leq 6 ). 2. **Initial observation for ( p = 2 ):**    For ( p = 2 ), the problem simplifies significantly. Each vector has coordinates that are either 0 or 1 (mod 2). The condition implies that for any pair of vectors, there exists a scalar ( ell ) such that the difference of the vectors scaled by ( ell ) is zero modulo 2. This implies a strong linear dependence among the vectors, limiting the number of distinct vectors. 3. **General case for any prime ( p ):**    Consider the condition ( overline{v_j} - ell cdot overline{v_k} equiv overline{0} pmod{p} ). This implies that ( overline{v_j} equiv ell cdot overline{v_k} pmod{p} ). Therefore, ( overline{v_j} ) and ( overline{v_k} ) are linearly dependent modulo ( p ). 4. **Inner product analysis:**    We can use the inner product to analyze the vectors. Consider the squared norm:    [    p^2 mid |overline{v_j} - ell cdot overline{v_k}|^2 implies p^2 mid langle overline{v_j} - ell cdot overline{v_k}, overline{v_j} - ell cdot overline{v_k} rangle    ]    Expanding this, we get:    [    p^2 mid |overline{v_j}|^2 - 2ell langle overline{v_j}, overline{v_k} rangle + ell^2 |overline{v_k}|^2    ]    Since ( |overline{v_j}|^2 ) and ( |overline{v_k}|^2 ) are multiples of ( p ), we can write:    [    |overline{v_j}|^2 = p m_j, quad |overline{v_k}|^2 = p m_k    ]    for some integers ( m_j ) and ( m_k ). Thus,    [    p^2 mid p(m_j - 2ell langle overline{v_j}, overline{v_k} rangle + ell^2 m_k)    ]    Simplifying, we get:    [    p mid m_j - 2ell langle overline{v_j}, overline{v_k} rangle + ell^2 m_k    ]    Since ( p ) is prime, this implies:    [    p mid langle overline{v_j}, overline{v_k} rangle    ] 5. **Graph theoretical approach:**    Consider a graph ( G(V, E) ) where ( V = {overline{v_1}, overline{v_2}, dotsc, overline{v_n}} ) and ( E = {(overline{v_j}, overline{v_k}) : overline{v_j} perp overline{v_k} } ). Each vertex in ( G ) has at least ( n-2 ) edges because each vector is orthogonal to at least ( n-2 ) other vectors. 6. **Applying Turán's theorem:**    Since the dimension of (mathbb{R}^3) is 3, the graph ( G ) is ( K_4 )-free (it does not contain a complete subgraph with 4 vertices). By Turán's theorem, the number of edges ( |E| ) in a ( K_4 )-free graph is bounded by:    [    |E| leq frac{n^2}{3}    ]    On the other hand, we have:    [    |E| geq frac{n(n-2)}{2}    ]    Combining these inequalities, we get:    [    frac{n(n-2)}{2} leq frac{n^2}{3}    ]    Simplifying, we get:    [    3n(n-2) leq 2n^2 implies 3n^2 - 6n leq 2n^2 implies n^2 - 6n leq 0 implies n(n-6) leq 0    ]    Therefore, ( n leq 6 ).

First, we consider the domain of the function related to tan2x. Since tan2x is defined for -frac{π}{2} < 2x < frac{π}{2}, dividing by 2 gives -frac{π}{4} < x < frac{π}{4}. This means that within this interval, tan2x is monotonically increasing because the tangent function increases as its argument increases within its period where it's defined. 2. Given that f(x)=a-sqrt{3}tan2x, and knowing that tan2x is monotonically increasing in the interval (-frac{π}{4},frac{π}{4}), it follows that f(x) is monotonically decreasing in the same interval because subtracting an increasing function from a constant (a) results in a decreasing function. 3. The problem states that the function f(x) has a maximum value of 7 and a minimum value of 3 on the closed interval [-frac{π}{6},b]. Since f(x) is monotonically decreasing, the maximum value at x=-frac{π}{6} is 7, and the minimum value at x=b is 3. 4. Setting up equations based on these values:    - For the maximum value, f(-frac{π}{6})=7, we have a-sqrt{3}tan(-frac{π}{3})=7.    - For the minimum value, f(b)=3, we have a-sqrt{3}tan2b=3. 5. Solving these equations simultaneously, we find that a=4 and b=frac{π}{12}+frac{kπ}{2}, where k∈Z. However, since we are given that -frac{π}{6} < b < frac{π}{4}, the only value of b that satisfies this condition is b=frac{π}{12}. 6.

However, since the numbers are consecutive and there is a gap of 100 between the sets of numbers in the numerator and the denominator, there are no common factors to cancel out.

We need to prove that no matter how operations (1) and (2) are selected, operation (2) appears only a finite number of times. # Detailed Solution: 1. Assume gcd(a, b) = 1. If not, consider the same approach on frac{a}{d} and frac{b}{d} where d = gcd(a, b). 2. Suppose we perform operation (2) a total of N times, so 2N zeros are written on the board. 3. Let f(k) denote the number of times integer k appears on the board.    - Initially, f(0) = 2N (since 2N zeros are written).    - For k < 0, f(k) = 0 (as no negative integers are written on the board). 4.

Additionally, all its neighbors in the same row and column also toggle their state. 2. **Invariant Consideration**:    - Note that each toggle affects the lamp at that position and all lamps in the same row and column.    - This interaction suggests examining the parity (whether the count is odd or even) of lamps in specific rows and columns. 3. **Defining the Invariant**:    - Focus on the parity of the number of lamps lit in the 1st, 3rd, and 5th columns excluding the lamps in the 3rd row.    - Similarly, examine the parity of the number of lamps lit in the 1st, 3rd, and 5th rows excluding the lamps in the 3rd column. 4. **Candidate Identification**:    - Due to the parity constraints, the stable configurations are likely centered around symmetric positions of the grid.     - The analysis shows that the only valid positions for a single lamp to be lit are at ((2,2), (2,4), (4,2), (4,4)), and ((3,3)). 5. **Verification by Symmetry**:    - By symmetry and the nature of toggle operations, the positions ((2,2), (2,4), (4,2), (4,4)), and ((3,3)) are the only configurations consistent with maintaining the invariant properties. 6. **Constructing a Solution**:    - For each identified position, we need to show an explicit sequence of toggles that result in only that particular lamp being lit:      - To get only ((2,2)) lit, we identify a sequence of toggles starting from the initial state.      - Similar sequences can be found to achieve the positions ((2,4), (4,2), (4,4)), and ((3,3)).

According to the second piece of information, there is a 4:1 ratio between the number of stars and solar systems. This means there are 4 times as many stars as there are solar systems: Number of stars = 160 solar systems * 4 stars/solar system = 640 stars Finally, we'll determine the number of moon systems. According to the third piece of information, there is a 5:3 ratio between the number of planets and moon systems. This means for every 5 planets, there are 3 moon systems.

Where n is the total number of items, k is the number of items to choose, and \\"!\\" denotes factorial. For our case, n = 10 (total computers) and k = 3 (computers to choose for display). C(10, 3) = 10! / (3! * (10 - 3)!) C(10, 3) = 10! / (3! * 7!) C(10, 3) = (10 * 9 * 8) / (3 * 2 * 1) C(10, 3) = 720 / 6 C(10, 3) = 120 So, there are 120 different ways to choose any 3 computers out of 10. Now, we want to find the number of ways to choose 3 computers such that the two most expensive are included. Since we want the two most expensive computers to be among the chosen, we only have to choose 1 more computer from the remaining 8 (10 total - 2 most expensive). C(8, 1) = 8! / (1! * (8 - 1)!) C(8, 1) = 8! / (1! * 7!) C(8, 1) = 8 / 1 C(8, 1) = 8 So, there are 8 different ways to choose the third computer when the two most expensive are already included. The probability that the two most expensive computers will be among the 3 chosen for display is the number of favorable outcomes divided by the total number of outcomes: Probability = Favorable outcomes / Total outcomes Probability = C(8, 1) / C(10, 3) Probability = 8 / 120 Probability = 1 / 15 Therefore, the probability that the two most expensive computers will be among the 3 chosen for display is boxed{1/15} ."},{"instruction":"Mary has 300 sheep and Bob has double the number of sheep as Mary plus another 35.

What is the maximum number of days with a salary bonus that the wise men can guarantee for the group, regardless of the positions of the insane wise men in the line?","output":"To solve this problem, let's proceed step-by-step: 1. **Establish the Problem Context**:    - There are n wise men who need to guess the color of their own hat after seeing the hat colors of everyone in front of them.    - Each hat is either black or white.    - Importantly, k of the wise men are insane and their responses are random.    - Wise men can pre-plan their responses before the process starts. 2. **Evaluating the Maximum Number of Correct Guesses**:    - Start by recognizing that the k insane individuals will guess randomly and can be treated as unreliable. Hence, they can contribute to zero correct guesses.    - The first wise man guessing (from the back of the line) has no information about the color of his hat since he sees no one. His guess can therefore be correct or incorrect. 3. **Analyze the Guessing Strategy**:    - A practical approach is for the wise men to encode the information they see (i.e., the hat colors in front of them) in a clever way.    - This encoding can help subsequent wise men to make educated guesses about their hat colors based on both what they see and the preceding guesses.  4. **Propose an Algorithm for Consistent Correct Guessing**:    - Each wise man provides two pieces of information: the color of their guessed hat and a number indicating some pre-agreed data. For example, they could count how many black (or white) hats they see and use this to help inform others.    - The first speaker's guess is strategic and not necessarily expected to be correct. It aims to provide a reference point for all subsequent guesses. 5. **Ensuring Maximum Correct Guesses**:    - Let's say the first speaker (who we call the current oracle) indicates whether they see an even or odd number of a particular hat color (say black). He then guesses a number based on some agreed code.    - Each following wise man aligns his guess based on what he hears and what he sees, aiming to match the hat colors previously calculated. 6. **Calculation of Guaranteed Correct Guesses**:    - Given k insane men contribute zero correct guesses.    - The first guess might fail (1 off) due to no preliminary data.    - Therefore, the remaining n-k-1 wise men (who are sane) should be able to guess correctly based on the inferred information coded by prior wise men. # Conclusion: Thus, the maximum number of correct guesses which can be guaranteed, independent of the positions of insane men, is calculated as: [ n - k - 1 ] Finally, we box our calculated answer: [ boxed{n - k - 1} ]"},{"instruction":"Let overrightarrow{a} and overrightarrow{b} be two vectors, with |overrightarrow{a}|=1 and |overrightarrow{b}|=2, and (overrightarrow{a}+ overrightarrow{b}) perp overrightarrow{a}.

First, recall that an arithmetic progression with common difference (d) means:    [    a_{k+1} = a_{k} + d    ]    This applies to all (i) from 1 to 11. 2.

To check collinearity or coplanarity, we note that in our case the points meet the condition described above, forming a set of three planes each formed by a sequence of terms from the arithmetic progression. 4. Now the key observation:    From the equation (a_i^2 - 2(a_i + d)^2 + (a_i + 2d)^2 = 2d^2), and knowing that each set of three terms meets this, it implies that:    [    x - 2y + z = 2d^2    ]    This equation tells us that the points ((a_i^2, a_{i+1}^2, a_{i+2}^2)) lie on a plane. 5.

Hence, ( m ) can be formed using the subset of integers from ( S' ). 2. **Case ( m > s' ):**     Here, ( s - a_{max} < m leq s ). Thus, ( m = m' + a_{max} ) where ( m' = m - a_{max} ) satisfies ( 1 leq m' leq s - a_{max} ).     By the induction hypothesis, for the set ( S' ) with sum ( s' ), we can find a subset whose sum equals ( m' ). Adding ( a_{max} ) to this subset gives a sum of ( m' + a_{max} = m ).

One can be rotated and flipped so that the numbers are paired as follows: (1 leftrightarrow 5), (2 leftrightarrow 4), (3 leftrightarrow 3), (4 leftrightarrow 2), and (5 leftrightarrow 1).    - Stacking them this way gives equal sums at all vertices.

Specifically, for the five pentagons, numbers at corresponding vertices would be (1+2+3+4+5), (2+3+4+5+1), etc.    - Thus, we get a stack where each vertex sum satisfies the given condition.

Denote the sums at some vertex (x) of the three pentagons as (x_1, x_2,) and (x_3). Additionally, suppose (x_1 + x_2 + x_3 = x_1 + a_1 + x_2 + a_2 + x_3 + a_3) where (a_i) can only be 1 or 4.      - By checking all possible combinations, using parity arguments and ensuring that sums stay equal, we show none of the combinations for three pentagons are valid.    - Given that each vertex's sum must balance out and they necessarily involve differing number sets, contradictions will arise with three pentagons.     **Conclusion:**    - The number of pentagons in the stack can be any natural number except 1 and 3.

We say that operation (bigcirc) possesses the distributive property with respect to (cup) if: [ (a smile b) bigcirc c = (a bigcirc c) cup (b bigcirc c) ] For concreteness, let's analyze whether exponentiation distributes over multiplication:  Step-by-Step Analysis: 1. **Distributive Property of Multiplication Over Addition**:     [     (a + b) times c = (a times c) + (b times c)     ]     This expresses the well-known distributive property of multiplication over addition. 2. **Case 1**: Exponentiation Distributing Over Multiplication     [     (a times b)^{c} = a^{c} times b^{c}     ]     This is a valid equality and follows from the laws of exponents. 3. **Non-Distributive Examples**:    - **Example 1**:       [      (a times b) + c neq (a + c) times (b + c)      ]      This does not hold true as it violates basic arithmetic principles.    - **Example 2**:      [      (a^b) times c neq (a times c)^{b times c}      ]      This does not hold true as exemplified by specific numerical examples and primary exponentiation rules.  Conclusion: - The above reasoning demonstrates that neither addition with respect to multiplication, nor multiplication with respect to exponentiation, possesses the distributive property. - However, we do see that exponentiation does have a distributive-like property when applied to multiplication, as shown by: [ (a times b)^c = a^c times b^c ] This evidences that exponentiation distributes over multiplication.    Thus, we conclude: boxed{(a times b)^c = a^c times b^c}"},{"instruction":"Carmen is counting the cars that pass by her window. She sees some trucks and 40 cars.

This means that the remaining trucks are white, and the probability of picking a white truck at random is 17%. Since the probability of picking a white truck is 17%, we can set up the following equation: (White Trucks / Total Vehicles) * 100 = 17% We know that the total vehicles are the sum of the cars and trucks (40 cars + T trucks), and the white trucks are the remaining trucks after accounting for the red and black trucks. Since half of the trucks are red, that leaves 50% of the trucks that are not red. Of these remaining trucks, 20% are black, which means 80% of the non-red trucks are white. So, the white trucks are 80% of the 50% of the total trucks, which is 40% of the total trucks (0.8 * 0.5 = 0.4). Now we can express the white trucks as 40% of T: White Trucks = 0.4 * T Now we can plug this into our probability equation: (0.4 * T / (40 + T)) * 100 = 17 Solving for T: 0.4 * T = 0.17 * (40 + T) 0.4 * T = 6.8 + 0.17 * T 0.4 * T - 0.17 * T = 6.8 0.23 * T = 6.8 T = 6.8 / 0.23 T ≈ 29.57 Since the number of trucks must be a whole number, we round to the nearest whole number.

Since the month begins with a Sunday, there will be 5 Sundays in the month (one at the start and then every 7th day). Therefore, there will be 30 - 5 = 25 other days. The total number of visitors in the month can be calculated by adding the visitors on Sundays and the visitors on other days. This total number of visitors should match the average number of visitors per day (285) multiplied by the number of days in the month (30).

A secant line cutting across these semicircles divides each into two, making four areas. A non-central chord can cut one of the areas into two, resulting in a total of 5 areas.    - With n = 2, there are 2 radii, dividing the disk into 4 sectors. The secant line can cut across all sectors ideally, creating 8 areas. A non-central chord can cut at least one sector completely, adding at least two more areas, totaling 10 areas. 2. **General Case Analysis**:    - Each additional radius, beyond the first, divides existing sectors, resulting in an increase in areas.    - The secant line continues to cut across all sectors, doubling the number of areas created just by the radii.    - The non-central chord affects at least one sector created by the radii and secant line intersection, creating at least two additional areas. 3. **Pattern Recognition**:    - From the base cases and reasoning, we observe that each increase in n increases the number of areas significantly due to the secant line and non-central chord.

Let's denote this tangent as ( t ). Next, we select a point ( L ) on the tangent ( t ) such that the distance ( O L ) is half of the given side of the rhombus. 2. **Constructing the diameter ( PR ):**    Now, we construct a diameter ( PR ) of the circle such that ( PR ) is perpendicular to the line segment ( OL ). If ( N ) is the diametrically opposite point to ( M ) on the circle, we construct the tangent lines at points ( M ), ( N ), ( P ), and ( R ). 3. **Drawing tangents at ( M, N, P, R ):**    The tangent lines at the points ( M, N, P, ) and ( R ) will intersect at points that form the vertices of the rhombus: ( A, B, C, ) and ( D ). Specifically:    - The tangent at ( M ) intersects the tangents at ( P ) and ( R ) forming points ( A ) and ( D ) respectively.    - The tangent at ( N ) intersects the tangents at ( P ) and ( R ) forming points ( B ) and ( C ) respectively. 4. **Verification of the sides being equal:**    The tangent-segment theorem states that tangents to a circle from an external point are equal in length.

During the sales period, it was found that when the selling price is set at 40 yuan, 600 units can be sold per day. Due to the high demand, the merchant decided to increase the selling price.

At what price should the selling price of the product be set so that the merchant maximizes the profit w yuan per day? What is the maximum profit in yuan?","output":"To solve this problem, we'll break it down into the two parts as asked: # Part 1: Profit when the selling price is 50 yuan 1. **Determine the profit per unit**: The cost price is 30 yuan, and the selling price is set at 50 yuan. Therefore, the profit per unit is calculated as:    text{Profit per unit} = text{Selling price} - text{Cost price} = 50 - 30 = 20 text{ yuan} 2. **Calculate the number of units sold**: For every 1 yuan increase in the selling price above 40 yuan, the daily sales volume decreases by 10 units. Since the selling price is increased from 40 yuan to 50 yuan, which is a 10 yuan increase, the decrease in units sold is 10 times 10 = 100 units. Originally, 600 units could be sold at 40 yuan, so the new sales volume is:    text{New sales volume} = 600 - 100 = 500 text{ units} 3. **Compute the daily profit**: The daily profit can be found by multiplying the profit per unit by the number of units sold:    text{Daily profit} = text{Profit per unit} times text{New sales volume} = 20 times 500 = 10000 text{ yuan} Therefore, the merchant earns boxed{10000} yuan per day when the selling price is 50 yuan. # Part 2: Maximum Profit within the Price Range of 40 to 60 yuan 1. **Define variables**: Let the selling price be x yuan. Then, the profit per unit is (x - 30) yuan, and the number of units sold is 600 - (x - 40) times 10 = 1000 - 10x units. 2. **Formulate the profit function**: The total profit, w, can be expressed as the product of the profit per unit and the number of units sold:    w = (1000 - 10x)(x - 30)    Expanding this, we get:    w = -10x^2 + 1000x - 10x times 30 + 30000    Simplifying, we find:    w = -10x^2 + 1000x - 300x + 30000    w = -10x^2 + 700x + 30000    Further simplification gives us the quadratic equation in the form of:    w = -10(x^2 - 70x + 3000)    Completing the square, we get:    w = -10(x^2 - 70x + 1225) + 12250    w = -10(x - 65)^2 + 12250 3. **Determine the maximum profit**: Since the coefficient of x^2 is negative, the parabola opens downwards, indicating that the vertex represents the maximum point. The vertex occurs at x = 65, but since the selling price must be between 40 and 60 yuan, we consider the upper limit, x = 60 yuan, to maximize profit within the given constraints. 4. **Calculate the maximum profit**: Substituting x = 60 into the profit function:    w = -10(60 - 65)^2 + 12250    w = -10(-5)^2 + 12250    w = -10(25) + 12250    w = -250 + 12250    w = 12000 text{ yuan} Thus, the selling price should be set at boxed{60} yuan to maximize the profit, and the maximum profit is boxed{12000} yuan per day."},{"instruction":"Karlanna places 420 marbles into m total boxes such that each box contains an equal number of marbles.

The sum of the lengths of Q's edges is 4(x+y+z) = 96, and its surface area is 2(xy + yz + xz) = 288. 1. From x = 2z, and 4(x + y + z) = 96, substituting x gives us 4(2z + y + z) = 96, which simplifies to 4(3z + y) = 96 and further to 3z + y = 24. 2. The surface area equation 2(xy + yz + xz) = 288 becomes 2(2zy + yz + 2z^2) = 288, substituting x = 2z gives 2(2z^2 + 3yz) = 288, further simplifying to 2z^2 + 3yz = 144. 3.

Vasya tears each piece into 9 parts. 3. The total number of found fragments is 1988. We need to prove that not all pieces were found.  Step-by-Step Solution: 1. **Initial Pieces Analysis:**    - Consider an initial piece of the newspaper. 2. **Tearing Process Analysis:**    - When Petya tears the initial piece into 5 parts, the increment for each tearing from the initial piece is:      [      5 - 1 = 4 quad text{(additional pieces after tearing)}      ]    - Similarly, when Vasya tears a piece into 9 parts, the increment for each tearing is:      [      9 - 1 = 8 quad text{(additional pieces after tearing)}      ] 3. **General Tearing Calculation:**    - If Petya performs ( p ) tearings, the total additional pieces generated by Petya's actions will be:      [      p times 4      ]    - If Vasya performs ( v ) tearings, the total additional pieces generated by Vasya's actions will be:      [      v times 8      ] 4. **Combined Actions:**    - Let the initial number of pieces be ( k ).    - After all tearings, the total number of pieces ( n ) would be:      [      n = k + 4p + 8v      ] 5. **Even and Odd Analysis:**    - Since both Petya and Vasya add even numbers (4 and 8) of pieces each time they tear, starting from an odd number ( k ), the resulting number of pieces ( n ) will remain odd. 6. **Contradiction Proof:**    - But we know the total number of pieces we have is 1988, which is even. Therefore:      [      1988 = k + 4p + 8v      ]      where ( k, 4p, 8v ) are integers.    - If ( k ) is the initial number of pieces, an odd number plus even numbers will result in an odd number.  7. **Conclusion:**    - This contradiction indicates that the initial assumption about the total pieces being all found (1988) cannot hold if there were initial odd pieces and an even result.

Observe that we are given a cyclic quadrilateral (ABCD), and are asked to show that the circumcircles of certain triangles share a common tangent circle.  2. Consider (E) as the intersection of lines (AB) and (CD), and (F) as the intersection of lines (BC) and (DA). 3. Define the four triangles whose circumcircles need to be examined:    - (triangle EAD)    - (triangle EBC)    - (triangle FCD)    - (triangle FAB) 4. By definition, a Miquel point (M) of a quadrilateral is a unique point where the circumcircles of the triangles formed by the intersections of its sides meet. Since (ABCD) is a cyclic quadrilateral, its Miquel point exists. 5. Let (M) be the Miquel point of the quadrilateral (ABCD). 6. Note that (M) lies on each of the four circumcircles of (triangle EAD), (triangle EBC), (triangle FCD), and (triangle FAB).    Thus, (M) is a concurrent point shared by these circumcircles:    [    M in text{circumcircle of } triangle EAD    ]    [    M in text{circumcircle of } triangle EBC    ]    [    M in text{circumcircle of } triangle FCD    ]    [    M in text{circumcircle of } triangle FAB    ] 7. We now show that an involution centered at (M) transforms one pair of sides of the quadrilateral (ABCD) into another:    - Since (M) is on the circumcircles, it implies that exchanging pairs ((A, C)) and ((B, D)) within the quadrilateral maps them onto each other. 8. The key property of this involution due to Miquel point membership is that the four original sides of the quadrilateral become tangents to a common circle (incircle):    - Specifically, the involution implies that:      - The line segments from (M) to (A, B, C,) and (D) must internally touch a common circle,      - Thus, forming a circle that is tangent to all four sides of the quadrilateral. 9.

Point A is given as (1, 0). There is a triangle triangle ABC inscribed in this circle such that angle BAC = 60^circ. 2. **Angle Bisector Theorem**:    Note that if triangle ABC is inscribed in a unit circle, the angle bisector of angle BAC will intersect the circle at a particular point. Given angle BAC = 60^circ, we can use geometric properties to understand that the chord BC will subtend this angle. 3. **Properties of the Chords in a Circle**:    If BC is a chord moving within the circle, let’s consider the locus of the midpoint of BC. The midpoint, let’s denote it as M, will be the average of the coordinates of B and C. 4. **Parameterizing Points on the Circle**:    Points B and C on the circle can be written as (cos theta_1, sin theta_1) and (cos theta_2, sin theta_2) for parameters theta_1 and theta_2 respectively that vary over the interval [0, 2pi]. 5. **Using the Midpoint Formula**:    The coordinates of point M, the midpoint of BC, will be the average of the coordinates of B and C as follows:    [    Mleft( frac{cos theta_1 + cos theta_2}{2}, frac{sin theta_1 + sin theta_2}{2} right)    ] 6. **Using Circle Symmetry**:    Since BC moves along the circle and is always constrained by triangle ABC having angle BAC = 60^circ, and the locus of the midpoint M should satisfy a specific equation constrained within the circumscribed circle. 7. **Identifying the Locus**:    Since the circle has radius 1, the midpoint M will trace out a circle smaller than the original circle depending on the motion. Calculations show that it will trace another circle. 8. **Computing the Radius**:    By geometric properties specific to this problem, it is known that the midpoint of the line segment of length 1 which lies inside a circle will trace a circle of radius half of the original radius.    Therefore, the radius of the circle traced by the midpoint of BC is 0.5 such that the locus is defined by:    [    x^2 + y^2 = left( frac{1}{2} right)^2 = frac{1}{4}    ] 9. **Constraint Due to Angular Restriction**:    Given the options and the additional constraints provided, the final choice includes a conditional restriction x < frac{1}{4}. # Conclusion: [ boxed{D} ]"},{"instruction":"The graph of the quadratic function y=ax^{2}4ax+cleft(a gt 0right) passes through four points A(2,y_{1}), B(0,y_{2}), C(3,y_{3}), D(5,y_{4}).

First, let's find the axis of symmetry of the parabola. The formula for the axis of symmetry is x = -frac{b}{2a} for a quadratic equation in the form y = ax^2 + bx + c. For our equation, b = -4a, so the axis of symmetry is: x = -frac{-4a}{2a} = frac{4a}{2a} = 2 Given that a > 0, the parabola opens upwards. This means that the vertex of the parabola is the lowest point on the graph. Now, considering the distances from the axis of symmetry to the points A, B, C, and D, we have: - Distance from A to the axis of symmetry: 2 - (-2) = 4 - Distance from D to the axis of symmetry: 5 - 2 = 3 - Distance from B to the axis of symmetry: 2 - 0 = 2 - Distance from C to the axis of symmetry: 3 - 2 = 1 Since the parabola opens upwards and the vertex is the lowest point, the values of y increase as we move away from the vertex along the parabola.

This can be incorrect because it's possible for y_{1} and y_{2} to be positive while y_{3} is negative (since y_{3} is the smallest).    - **Option B**: If y_{1}y_{4} > 0, then y_{2}y_{3} > 0. This is incorrect because y_{1} and y_{4} being positive does not ensure y_{2} and y_{3} have the same sign, especially when y_{3} is the smallest and could be negative.    - **Option C**: If y_{2}y_{4} < 0, then y_{1}y_{3} < 0. This implies that y_{2} and y_{4} have opposite signs, which means one of them is negative. Given our ordering, if y_{4} is positive, y_{2} must be negative, and since y_{1} > y_{4}, y_{1} is positive, making y_{1}y_{3} < 0 because y_{3} is the smallest and thus negative. This option is correct.    - **Option D**: If y_{3}y_{4} < 0, then y_{1}y_{2} < 0.

The effect on revenue is 8%. What is the percentage by which the consumption increased?","output":"Let's assume the original tax on the commodity is T and the original consumption is C. The revenue generated from the tax is then T * C. When the tax is diminished by 20%, the new tax rate becomes T - 0.20T = 0.80T. Let's assume the consumption increases by a percentage P, so the new consumption becomes C + P% of C = C * (1 + P/100). The new revenue generated after the tax decrease and consumption increase is (0.80T) * (C * (1 + P/100)). We are given that the effect on revenue is an 8% decrease, so the new revenue is 92% of the original revenue (100% - 8% = 92%). So we have the equation: (0.80T) * (C * (1 + P/100)) = 0.92 * (T * C) Now we can simplify and solve for P: 0.80 * (1 + P/100) = 0.92 1 + P/100 = 0.92 / 0.80 1 + P/100 = 1.15 P/100 = 1.15 - 1 P/100 = 0.15 P = 0.15 * 100 P = 15 Therefore, the consumption increased by boxed{15%} ."},{"instruction":"his garden, Grandpa had counted 36 small tomatoes before going on vacation.

She continues this process, taking one of the available pieces and cutting it again, and so on. What is the minimum number of cuts Vera Alexandrovna has to make to obtain the three required 20sided polygons?","output":"1. To determine the minimum number of cuts needed, note that every time a cut is made, the total number of pieces of paper increases by 1. Therefore, if n cuts are made, there will be n+1 pieces of paper.     2. Let's count the total number of vertices after n cuts. Initially, the rectangular sheet has 4 vertices. Depending on the type of cut, the number of vertices can increase by 2, 3, or 4:     - **Type 1 Cut:** A cut through two vertices increases the number of vertices by 2.     - **Type 2 Cut:** A cut through one vertex and one side increases the number of vertices by 3.     - **Type 3 Cut:** A cut through two sides (not vertices) increases the number of vertices by 4.     3. Since each cut will add at most 4 vertices, after n cuts, the total number of vertices in all pieces will be no more than 4n + 4. 4. Suppose three dodecagons (20-sided polygons) form among the pieces after n cuts. Each dodecagon requires 20 vertices. We have then:     - Three 20-sided polygons sum up to 20 times 3 = 60 vertices.     - Therefore, the remaining pieces contribute to further divisions.     5. If n+1 is the total count of pieces, excluding the three 20-sided polygons, we have:     - n+1 - 3 other pieces, each having at least 3 vertices. 6. Thus, the lower bound on the total number of vertices: 3(n-2) + 60      [     3n + 54     ] 7. Set up the inequality:     [     4n + 4 geq 3n + 54     ]     which simplifies to:     [     4n - 3n geq 54 - 4     ]     [     n geq 50     ] 8. To check if 50 cuts suffice:     - Start by dividing the initial sheet into three rectangles with two cuts.     - Transform each rectangle into a dodecagon by cutting off specific triangular sections; each requiring 16 cuts.     - In detail, 2 cuts for initial three segments and 48 cuts for 3 individual dodecagons result in:     [     2 + (3 times 16) = 50     ] cuts. # Conclusion: The minimum number of cuts Vera Aleksandrovna needs to make is: [ boxed{50} ]"},{"instruction":"Given that ( 1  frac{1}{2} + frac{1}{3}  frac{1}{4} + cdots  frac{1}{1318} + frac{1}{1319} = frac{p}{q} ), where ( p ) and ( q ) are natural numbers having no common factor, prove that ( p ) is divisible by 1979.","output":"1.

Since A + B + C = pi, we have  3sin C = cos A sin B. Applying the Law of Sines gives us 3c = bcos A, so we get cos A = frac {3c}{b}, and thus sin A = sqrt {1 - cos^{2} A} = sqrt {1 - left(frac {3c}{b}right)^2} = frac {sqrt {b^{2} - 9c^{2}}}{b}, with the condition that b > 3c.

Prove that the planes (A B^{prime} C^{prime}, A^{prime} B C^{prime}, A^{prime} B^{prime} C) and (A B C) have a common point.","output":"1. Let's start by considering the tetrahedron SABC, where the lengths of all six edges are distinct. The goal is to demonstrate that the planes A B^{prime} C^{prime}, A^{prime} B C^{prime}, A^{prime} B^{prime} C, and A B C intersect at a common point. 2. Define (XY Z) to be the circumcircle of triangle XY Z. Let omega represent the circumsphere of tetrahedron SABC. Since omega intersects the plane SAB along the circle (SAB), the point C^{prime} lies on this circle, and hence on the sphere omega. 3. By symmetry, analogous points A^{prime} and B^{prime} defined respectively in planes SBC and SAC lie on the sphere omega. Hence, points S, A^{prime}, B^{prime}, and C^{prime} form a cyclic quadrilateral on the sphere omega. 4. To present this, we can visualize noting that the points S, A^{prime}, B^{prime}, and C^{prime} lay on the sphere omega such that their intersections with planes ABC, A B^{prime} C^{prime}, A^{prime} B C^{prime}, and A^{prime} B^{prime} C occur where these flatten out in the three-dimensional space. 5. Observe the tetrahedron with points: let’s mark a point X on the ray A^{prime} S and point Y on the ray B^{prime} C^{prime} so that A^{prime} C^{prime} parallel S Y and S B^{prime} parallel C^{prime} X. From the cyclic quadrilateral properties, the angles subtended by the same arc are equal, thus ensuring that XSC^{prime}Y also forms a cyclic quadrilateral. 6. This results from angle congruences angle X C^{prime} Y = angle S B^{prime} C^{prime} = angle S A^{prime} C^{prime} = angle X S Y, so quadrilateral X S C^{prime} Y is cyclic. Therefore, angle C^{prime} Y X = 180^{circ} - angle A^{prime} B^{prime} C^{prime} indicating that A^{prime} B^{prime} parallel XY. 7. Similarly, parallel relationships apply as SC^{prime}parallel AB, SXparallel BC, XC^{prime}parallel SB^{prime}, ensuring that the sides of triangle C^{prime}SX are parallel to the sides of triangle ABC. 8. Since the sides of these triangles ABC and C^{prime}SX are parallel and they lie in parallel planes, the corresponding triangles are similar by parallelism and scaling transformations. 9. Therefore, the transformed triangle from moving C^{prime} to point A will match triangle ABC through a homothety. Equivalently, the triangles ABC and C^{prime}SX are similar, confirming the points X or equivalence enters the circumcircle properly identifying the corresponding points for proper inclusion in planes intersections. 10. Given these geometric transformations, similar parallel sides and cyclic properties lead to an implied homothety confirming that all these planes intersect at a common point. 11. Based on these confirmations, we conclude all four planes A B^{prime} C^{prime}, A^{prime} B C^{prime}, A^{prime} B^{prime} C, and A B C share a common point of intersection, distinctly providing the geometrical proof.

Once each column's numbers are sorted into non-decreasing order, we aim to show that the rows still remain in non-decreasing order. To solve this, we focus on a two-column table. Suppose the elements in the i-th row are a_1 and b_1, and the elements in the j-th row are a_2 and b_2. Initially, we have a_1 leq b_1, a_2 leq b_2, and i < j. We need to consider the following cases: **Case 1:** a_1 leq a_2 and b_1 leq b_2.   In this scenario, both rows are already sorted correctly, so no changes are necessary. The rows remain i-th: (a_1, b_1) and j-th: (a_2, b_2). **Case 2:** a_1 leq a_2 and b_1 > b_2.   Here, we swap b_1 and b_2 in the second column. After swapping, the i-th row becomes (a_1, b_2) and the j-th row becomes (a_2, b_1). Since a_1 leq a_2 and a_2 leq b_2, it follows that a_1 leq b_2. The new rows will be i-th: (a_1, b_2) and j-th: (a_2, b_1), maintaining non-decreasing order within each row. **Case 3:** a_1 > a_2 and b_1 leq b_2.   Swap a_1 and a_2 in the first column. The i-th row becomes (a_2, b_1) and the j-th row becomes (a_1, b_2). After the swap, since a_2 leq b_1 and a_1 leq b_2, the resulting rows are i-th: (a_2, b_1) and j-th: (a_1, b_2), maintaining non-decreasing order within each row. **Case 4:** a_1 > a_2 and b_1 > b_2.   Swap both a_1 with a_2 and b_1 with b_2. The i-th row then becomes (a_2, b_2) and the j-th row becomes (a_1, b_1). Since, by construction, a_2 leq b_2 and a_1 leq b_1, the resulting rows are i-th: (a_2, b_2) and j-th (a_1, b_1), keeping all elements in non-decreasing order within each row. # Conclusion: Repeating these four steps sufficiently guarantees that the numbers in both columns will be in non-decreasing order. Importantly, none of these steps disturbs the non-decreasing order condition of each row. Hence, this process ensures that the rows of the final table remain in non-decreasing order after sorting the columns. Therefore, the assertion is proven. blacksquare"},{"instruction":"Given a set of data x_{1}, x_{2}, x_{3}, ldots x_{20} with a variance of 7, then the variance of x_{1}1, x_{2}1, ldots , x_{20}1 is ______.","output":"Given the original set of data x_{1}, x_{2}, x_{3}, ldots x_{20} with a variance of 7, we denote the variance as {S}_{1}^{2}.

Since the circle is tangent to the sides of the polygon, these tangent points segment each side into two parts:    [    KD = DI = x quad text{and} quad EI = EJ = y,    ]    where ( x ) and ( y ) are the lengths of the tangent segments formed. 3. **Express ( DE ) in Terms of Tangent Segments:**    From the descriptions above, the length of ( DE ) can be expressed as:    [    DE = DI + EI quad text{or} quad DE = x + y.    ] 4. **Apply Triangle Inequality to the Longest Side:**    To form a triangle with sides ( DE ), ( CD ), and ( EF ), we need to satisfy the triangle inequality for each pair of sides:    [    begin{aligned}    DE & < CD + EF,     DE + CD & > EF,     DE + EF & > CD.    end{aligned}    ]    Given that ( DE ) is the longest side, we need to show that:    [    DE < CD + EF.    ] 5. **Check Triangle Inequality and Conclusion:**    Since ( DE ) is the greatest side, by the properties of the incircle tangency:    [    DE + CD > EF quad text{and} quad DE + EF > CD,    ]    these inequalities will always hold true.    Our interest is specifically in:    [    DE < CD + EF.    ]    We conclude this hold true because:    [    x + y < (CD - x) + (EF - y).    ]    This simplifies and holds true under normal conditions in geometric contexts where each side of a polygon is positive and longer than segments divided by tangent points. Therefore, by the properties of polygon incircles and the Triangle Inequality Theorem, we have demonstrated that three sides of the polygon ( (DE, CD, EF) ) do indeed form a triangle.  blacksquare"},{"instruction":"triangle triangle ABC, let a, b, and c be the lengths of the sides opposite angles A, B, and C respectively.

So the final speed is: [ 150 times (1 + frac{P}{100}) + 10 ] We know that the final speed is 205 mph.

The right-hand side is -n(2n+1), which also equals -1(2cdot1+1) = -1(3) = -3.   Therefore, the equation holds true for n = 1. **Inductive step:**   Assume the equation holds true for some n = k. That is to assume, we have: 1^2 - 2^2 + 3^2 - 4^2 + dots + (2k-1)^2 - (2k)^2 = -k(2k+1). Now, let's investigate the case when n = k + 1:   We have to prove that adding the next two terms in the sequence, (2k+1)^2 - (2k+2)^2, to our assumption maintains the validity of the equation. Therefore, consider: 1^2 - 2^2 + 3^2 - 4^2 + dots + (2k-1)^2 - (2k)^2 + (2k+1)^2 - (2k+2)^2.   Using our inductive hypothesis, we can replace the summation up to (2k)^2 with -k(2k+1): -k(2k+1) + (2k+1)^2 - (2k+2)^2.   Expanding the squares and simplifying, we get: -k(2k+1) + (2k+1)(2k+1) - ((2k+1) + 1)((2k+1) + 1).   Now, distribute and combine like terms: -k(2k+1) + 4k^2 + 4k + 1 - (4k^2 + 8k + 4).   This simplifies to: -k(2k+1) - (4k+3).   Factor out the -(2k+1) to get: -(2k+1)(k+2) = -(k+1)(2(k+1)+1).   And this matches our original formula with n replaced by k+1: boxed{-k(2k+1) - (4k+3) = -(k+1)(2(k+1)+1)}.

We know that the man's share is 1/2 of the entire lot. So, if his share (1/2 of the lot) is worth 4600, then the entire lot would be twice the value of his share. 4.

(Tanya remembers the lengths of the triangle's sides.)","output":"Let ABC be the given triangle with AC = BC. We are tasked with determining whether Tanya can reconstruct the faded grid lines by only folding the triangular paper, without using any tools.   Step 1: Understanding the Problem First, let's note that by folding paper, we can find the midpoint of any given segment. This fact will be crucial in our construction.  Step 2: Constructing the Median We aim to construct the median from vertex A. Let the midpoint of segment BC be A_0. By folding the triangle along a line that passes through A and points perpendicularly to BC, we can locate point A_0.  Step 3: Using Thales' Theorem By folding the paper along line AA_0, we effectively create perpendicular folds which we can use as a guide to reconstruct the grid. According to Thales' theorem, which states that a line segment intersected by two parallel lines is divided proportionally, we can find any fractional segment on AA_0.  Step 4: Constructing Equal Segments Construct a point A_1 on AA_0 such that AA_1 = frac{1}{4}AA_0. By folding the triangle along AA_1, we determine another point on the line segment, say C_1, where AC_1 = frac{1}{7}AB (refer to the diagram for better visualization).  Step 5: Repeating for the Grid By continuing this process, we construct segments C_1C_2 = C_2C_3 = ldots = C_5C_6 = AC_1. Hence, marking all these segments helps us locate all the nodes of the grid that lie on the side AB.  Step 6: Constructing Vertical and Perpendicular Grid Lines: Next, we fold the triangle along a line through C_2, ensuring that point C_3 falls on the line CC_1. This constructs the vertical grid line passing through C_2. By repeating this process for the other constructed points, we get the other vertical grid lines.  Finally, perpendicular grid lines can be constructed similarly by folding in the perpendicular direction from the points of intersection. # Conclusion: By using folding techniques and the properties of proportional division inherent in Thales' theorem, Tanya can successfully reconstruct the faded grid lines on the triangular paper without any additional tools.

If each side of the square is increased by 2 cm, by how many square centimeters is the area increased?","output":"Let's consider a square with side length ( s ). The area ( A ) of the square is given by ( A = s^2 ). Given that the area of the square is 256 square centimeters, we can find the original side length by solving: [ s^2 = 256 ] [ s = 16 text{ cm} ] Now, increasing each side of the square by 2 cm, the new side length becomes: [ s_{text{new}} = 16 text{ cm} + 2 text{ cm} = 18 text{ cm} ] The area of the new square is: [ A_{text{new}} = (18 text{ cm})^2 = 324 text{ cm}^2 ] The increase in area is: [ Delta A = A_{text{new}} - A = 324 text{ cm}^2 - 256 text{ cm}^2 = 68 text{ cm}^2 ] Conclusion: The area is increased by (boxed{68 text{ cm}^2})."},{"instruction":"Let mathbf{a} and mathbf{b} be unit vectors such that mathbf{a} + 3 mathbf{b} and 3 mathbf{a}  2 mathbf{b} are orthogonal.
