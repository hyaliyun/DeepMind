Provide a detailed answer so user don’t need to search outside to understand the answer. Given the question: A friend asked me to answer this question: What is the first name of the person who probably appears before a donor, who would have been kneeling in prayer in the now lost opposite panel?, using the article: Van Eyck gives Mary three roles: Mother of Christ, the personification of the \\"Ecclesia Triumphans\\" and Queen of Heaven, the latter apparent from her jewel-studded crown. The painting's near miniature size contrasts with Mary's unrealistically large stature compared with her setting. She physically dominates the cathedral; her head is almost level with the approximately sixty feet high gallery. This distortion of scale is found in a number of other van Eyck's Madonna paintings, where the arches of the mostly gothic interior do not allow headroom for the virgin. Pächt describes the interior as a \\"throne room\\", which envelopes her as if a \\"carrying case\\". Her monumental stature reflects a tradition reaching back to an Italo-Byzantine type – perhaps best known through Giotto's Ognissanti Madonna (c. 1310) – and emphasises her identification with the cathedral itself. Till-Holger Borchert says that van Eyck did not paint her as \\"the Madonna in a church\\", but instead as metaphor, presenting Mary \\"as the Church\\". This idea that her size represents her embodiment as the church was first suggested by Erwin Panofsky in 1941. Art historians in the 19th century, who thought the work was executed early in van Eyck's career, attributed her scale as the mistake of a relatively immature painter.The composition is today seen as deliberate, and opposite to both his Madonna of Chancellor Rolin and Arnolfini Portrait. These works show interiors seemingly too small to contain the figures, a device van Eyck used to create and emphasise an intimate space shared by donor and saint. The Virgin's height recalls his Annunciation of 1434–36, although in that composition there are no architectural fittings to give a clear scale to the building. Perhaps reflecting the view of a \\"relatively immature painter\\", a copy of the Annunciation by Joos van Cleve shows Mary at a more realistic proportion scale to her surroundings.Mary is presented as a Marian apparition; in this case she probably appears before a donor, who would have been kneeling..., what would be the answer ? The answer is:","output":"The first name of the person who probably appears before a donor, who would have been kneeling in prayer in the now lost opposite panel, is not explicitly mentioned in the provided article. However, based on the context, we could assume that the person in question would likely have been the \\"donor\\" himself. As the painting depicts Mary in a church setting and her height represents her embodiment as the church, the most probable situation would be Mary appearing before a donor in prayer, who may have commissioned the artwork as a display of devotion to the Virgin Mary. Given that the article doesn't provide a specific name for the donor, we cannot accurately name the person in question."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant. You will be given a task.

Question: Generate a question about the following movie plot: Tom Witzky is a phone lineman living in a working-class neighborhood in Chicago with his pregnant wife Maggie and his son Jake, who possesses the ability to commune with the dead. At a party one evening, Tom challenges Maggie's sister Lisa, a believer in paranormal activity, to hypnotize him. After putting him under, Lisa plants a post-hypnotic suggestion in Tom urging him to \\"be more open-minded\\". Tom then begins experiencing visions of a violent scuffle involving a girl who he later learns is Samantha Kozac, a 17-year-old that disappeared from the neighborhood six months prior. While Tom and Maggie attend a high school football game, Jake is overheard by his babysitter, Debbie Kozac, as he speaks with Samantha. Debbie gets upset and snatches Jake, running off with him in the night. Meanwhile, Tom senses Jake is in danger and rushes home but finds him gone. Tom then sees strange flashes of red light that eventually leads him to the 'L' station where Debbie is speaking with her mother about Jake. When Tom and Maggie confront her, Debbie angrily questions them about her sister Samantha, explaining that she had an intellectual disability: having the mental capacity of an 8-year-old and thus a child's tendency to trust strangers. Tom denies knowing her to Debbie but admits to Maggie that she is the girl in his visions. Tom becomes obsessed with Samantha and begins probing members of the community about her disappearance. This attracts the attention of his landlord Harry Damon, Tom's friend, Frank McCarthy and their respective sons Kurt Damon and Adam McCarthy, who all dismiss Samantha as a runaway teen. During an afternoon walk, Jake and Maggie encounter a funeral where Chicago policemen are saluting in a ceremony; here a policeman named Neil immediately recognizes Jake's unique talent and invites Tom to a private gathering of like-minded people to learn more about what is happening to his son. Maggie withholds her conversation with Neil from Tom and goes to the meeting herself, and Neil tells her the spirit... Answer:","output":"Discuss the significance of Jake's ability to commune with the dead and its impact on his family and the unfolding events in the movie. How does this power influence the characters, particularly Tom, Maggie, and Debbie, in their pursuit of the truth about Samantha Kozac's disappearance, and what role does this supernatural element play in the story's resolution?"},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Please answer the following question: Information:  - Lieutenant general, lieutenant-general and similar (abbrev Lt Gen, LTG and similar) is a three-star military rank (NATO code OF-8) used in many countries. The rank traces its origins to the Middle Ages, where the title of lieutenant general was held by the second in command on the battlefield, who was normally subordinate to a captain general.  - Social work is an academic and practice-based professional discipline that seeks to facilitate the welfare of communities, individuals, families, and groups. It may promote social change, development, cohesion, and empowerment. Underpinned by theories of social sciences and guided by principles of social justice, human rights, collective responsibility, and respect for diversities, social work engages people and structures to address life challenges and enhance well-being.  - The German Empire (officially ') was the historical German nation state that existed from the unification of Germany in 1871 to the abdication of Kaiser Wilhelm II in November 1918, when Germany became a federal republic (the Weimar Republic).  - Battle of Kaniv, or Battle of Kaniów took place during World War I on the night of 1011 May 1918, near Kaniv, Ukraine between Polish and German army troops. The fighting pitted the Polish II Corps in Russia (including Brigade II of the Polish Legions), under general Józef Haller von Hallenburg, against the German Imperial Army (including the 28th Landwehr Brigade), under general Zierhold. Ultimately the Germans were victorious with about half of the Polish forces surrendering and the rest retreating in disarray.  - The Central Powers , consisting of Germany, , the Ottoman Empire and Bulgaria  hence also known as the Quadruple Alliance  was one of the two main factions during World War I (191418). It faced and was defeated by the Allied Powers that had formed around the Triple Entente, after which it was dissolved.  - The Triple Entente (from French \\"entente\\" \\"friendship, understanding, agreement\\") was the understanding linking the Russian Empire, the French Third Republic, and the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Ireland after the signing of the Anglo-Russian Entente on 31 August 1907. The understanding between the three powers, supplemented by agreements with Japan and Portugal, constituted a powerful counterweight to the Triple Alliance of Germany, Austria-Hungary and the Kingdom of Italy, though Italy did not side with Germany and Austria during World War I, and joined the Entente Powers instead, in the 1915 Treaty of London.  - The Order of Polonia Restituta is a Polish state order established 4 February 1921. It is conferred to both military and civilians as well as to foreigners for outstanding achievements in the fields of education, science, sport, culture, art, economics, national defense, social work, civil service, or for furthering good relations between countries.  - Austria-Hungary, often referred to as the Austro-Hungarian Empire in English-language sources, was a constitutional union of the Austrian Empire (the Kingdoms and lands represented in the Imperial Council, or \\"Cisleithania\\") and the Kingdom of Hungary (Lands of the Crown of Saint Stephen or \\"Transleithania\\") that existed from 1867 to 1918, when it collapsed as a result of defeat in World War I. The union was a result of the Austro-Hungarian Compromise of 1867 and came into existence on 30 March 1867. Austria-Hungary consisted of two monarchies (Austria and Hungary), and one autonomous region: the Kingdom of Croatia-Slavonia under the Hungarian crown, which negotiated the CroatianHungarian Settlement (\\"Nagodba\\") in 1868. It was ruled by the House of Habsburg, and constituted the last phase in the constitutional evolution of the Habsburg Monarchy. Following the 1867 reforms, the Austrian and the Hungarian states were co-equal. Foreign affairs and the military came under joint oversight, but all other governmental faculties were divided between respective states.  - The Battle of Raracza was fought between Polish Legionnaires, and Austria-Hungary, from February 15 to 16, 1918, near Raracza in Bukovina, and ended with a Polish victory.  - Russia, also officially known as the Russian Empire, was a state that existed from 1721 until it was overthrown by the short-lived liberal February Revolution in 1917. One of the largest empires in world history, stretching over three continents, the Russian Empire was surpassed in landmass only by the British and Mongol empires. The rise of the Russian Empire happened in association with the decline of neighboring rival powers: the Swedish Empire, the PolishLithuanian Commonwealth, Persia and the Ottoman Empire. It played a major role in 181214 in defeating Napoleon's ambitions to control Europe, and expanded to the west and south.  - In the history of Europe, the Middle Ages or medieval period lasted from the 5th to the 15th century. It began with the fall of the Western Roman Empire and merged into the Renaissance and the Age of Discovery. The Middle Ages is the middle period of the three traditional divisions of Western history: classical antiquity, the medieval period, and the modern period. The medieval period is itself subdivided into the Early, High, and Late Middle Ages.  - Second in Command is a 2006 American action film starring Jean-Claude Van Damme and directed by Simon Fellows. The film was released on direct-to-DVD in the United States on May 2, 2006.  - The Polish II Corps in Russia was a Polish military formation formed in revolutionary Russia in 1917.  - The Austro-Hungarian Army was the ground force of the Austro-Hungarian Dual Monarchy from 1867 to 1918. It was composed of three parts: the joint army (\\", \\"Common Army\\", recruited from all parts of the country), the Imperial Austrian Landwehr (recruited from Cisleithania), and the Royal Hungarian Honved (recruited from Transleithania).  - Cisleithania (also \\"Zisleithanien\\", , , , , , , , , transliterated: \\"Tsysleitàniia\\") was a common yet unofficial denotation of the northern and western part of Austria-Hungary, the Dual Monarchy created in the Compromise of 1867as distinguished from \\"Transleithania\\", i.e. the Hungarian Lands of the Crown of Saint Stephen east of (\\"beyond\\") the Leitha River.  - Dual monarchy occurs when two separate kingdoms are ruled by the same monarch, follow the same foreign policy, exist in a customs union with each other and have a combined military but are otherwise self-governing. The term is typically used to refer to AustriaHungary, a dual monarchy that existed from 1867 to 1918.  - A civil servant or public servant is a person in the public sector employed for a government department or agency. The extent of civil servants of a state as part of the \\"civil service\\" varies from country to country. In the United Kingdom, for instance, only Crown (national government) employees are referred to as civil servants whereas county or city employees are not.  - The Polish Legions (Polish \\"Legiony Polskie\\") was a name of the Polish military force (the first active Polish army in generations) established in August 1914 in Galicia soon after World War I erupted between the opposing alliances of the Triple Entente on one side (including the British Empire, the French Republic and the Russian Empire); and the Central Powers on the other side, including the German Empire and Austria-Hungary. The Legions became \\"a founding myth for the creation of modern Poland\\" in spite of their considerably short existence; they were replaced by the Polish Auxiliary Corps formation on 20 September 1916, merged with Polish II Corps in Russia on 19 February 1918 for the Battle of Raracza against Austria-Hungary, and disbanded following the military defeat at the Battle of Kaniów in May 1918, against imperial Germany.

As a result, its political, legal, linguistic and cultural legacy is widespread. At the peak of its power, the phrase \\"the empire on which the sun never sets\\" was often used to describe the British Empire, because its expanse around the globe meant that the sun was always shining on at least one of its territories.

It was their first week in Brazil, having arrived to immerse themselves in its culture, language, and customs. They were siblings – Patricia, a confident and intrepid traveler, and Victoria, the more introspective and sensitive of the two. Upon arrival in Brazil, Patricia dove headfirst into the new experiences, eager to understand the way of life and languages of the locals. Victoria marveled at her sister's enthusiasm and adaptability to the challenges that come with navigating a foreign land. Nevertheless, she felt a constant uneasiness, as though she were submerged in water, unable to surface and breathe the air she needed. One early morning, at their simple but cozy hotel, Patricia suggested they attend a folklore festival held by the locals to learn more about the Brazilian traditions. Victoria initially hesitated but Patricia, ever the persuasive one, managed to get her to agree. The festival was fantastic – a kaleidoscope of colors, music, and dancing. The air was infused with the irresistible aroma of food, and people from all walks of life, dressed in traditional outfits, demonstrated their customs, plied their crafts, and entertained the audience. Victoria found herself drawn to an old man who was weaving intricate patterns on a loom. The vibrant threads and hypnotic motion of the loom cast a spell on Victoria, momentarily lifting her aquatic melancholy. He noticed her watching and beckoned her over. With a smile, the old man handed her a piece of vividly colored fabric, its texture the finest Victoria had ever touched. As she stroked the delicate material, he explained its origins. It was a centuries-old technique handed down through generations, and the fabric was said to hold magical powers. The elders believed that its weight and texture could offer strength and comfort to those who carried it. Intrigued, Victoria wrapped the fabric around her wrist, feeling a sense of peace suffusing her entire being. She thanked the old man and rejoined Patricia, who was trying her hand at traditional dancing. As they laughed and danced together, Victoria felt lighter, unburdened by the oppressive humidity she had been experiencing. Over the following days, they explored more of Brazil. From the vibrant city of Rio de Janeiro to the lush Amazon rainforest, they relished the sights, sounds, and flavors that the country had to offer. Victoria found solace in the presence of her magical fabric, which seemed to imbue her with a newfound strength and ability to tolerate the humid climate. As they traveled deeper into the country, they encountered a mysterious, secluded village high in the mountains. The residents spoke a dialect they hadn't encountered before – a blend of Portuguese and indigenous languages, which Patricia struggled to understand. But Victoria, with the fabric still around her wrist, found herself able to comprehend the rich tapestry of words, absorbing the stories and legends of the village. It was then that Patricia felt a pang of envy and frustration as she watched her sister fully engage with the locals. But as they stayed, Victoria began to share her newfound gift, translating stories and forging connections between their people and themselves. The sisters shared the joys of discovery and learning, realizing that their contrasting perceptions of the world only made their adventure that much richer. As their time in Brazil came to an end, Patricia and Victoria reflected on their journey. They had grown closer, entered the world of Brazilian folklore, and experienced its mystical elements. But the greatest lesson they took away from this land of inherent magic was an understanding that they each had unique gifts to offer – that the beauty of the world lies not just in traversing its lands, but in embracing the differences that exist both within and beyond themselves. And as they boarded their plane to return home, the fabric around Victoria's wrist reminding her of her transformation, she realized that while the air may have felt heavy in Brazil, the weightlessness of the human spirit would reside within her forever – a testament to the adventure that had shaped them both in ways they would never forget."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Answer:","output":"Jack Rafter, born on February 20, 1875, in Troy, New York, was an American baseball player known for his role as a catcher. Growing up in the vibrant city of Troy, Rafter developed an interest in baseball at a young age, which would later translate into a professional career. Rafter made his debut in the world of baseball on September 24, 1904, which was also the starting point for his short-lived career as his final date in baseball would also fall on the same day. In his sole game in the big leagues, Rafter played as a catcher for the Pittsburgh Pirates, a team that continued to gain prominence in the early 20th century. Although he was a right-handed batter and threw with his right hand, Rafter could not make an impact in that game. With such a brief career, Rafter's statistics would also stay limited – he played in only one game, with three at-bats, and unfortunately, no hits. The year 1904 proved to be both the debut and final year for Jack Rafter in baseball. He spent the rest of his life away from the professional baseball scene, but it's likely that he retained a passion for the sport he was once a part of. Little information is available on Rafter's post-baseball life, but he remained a resident of Troy, New York, where he was born. Nearly four decades after his debut, on January 5, 1943, Jack Rafter passed away in his hometown of Troy. He left behind a legacy as a part of the Pittsburgh Pirates and an interesting story of a man who tasted the world of professional baseball for the briefest moment. Rafter remains a unique figure among baseball players for his one-day career, and his story serves as a reminder of how the world of sports can oftentimes be unpredictable and fleeting."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Greg's fellow skier Bob is also competing in the same competitions. They both are exited about it.  Hint: Ski cross is a type of skiing competition. Despite its being a timed racing event, it is often considered part of freestyle skiing because it incorporates terrain features traditionally found in freestyle. Ski cross courses have both naturally occurring terrain and artificial features including big-air jumps and high-banked turns.

You must generate a detailed and long answer. Answer the following question: Tornadoes are nature's most violent storms, which can cause deaths and destroy a neighborhood in seconds. A tornado appears as a funnel-shaped   cloud from a thunderstorm to the ground with whirling   winds that can reach 300 miles per hour. Damage paths can be over one mile wide and 50 miles long. Every state is at some risk from this disaster. Some tornadoes can be seen clearly, while rain or nearby low-hanging clouds _ others. At many times, tornadoes develop so rapidly that little, if any, advance warning is possible. Before a tornado hits, the air may become very still. A cloud of debris   can mark the location of a tornado even if a funnel can not be seen. Tornadoes generally occur near the edge of a thunderstorm, when the strong wind may die down. It is not uncommon to see clear, sunlit skies behind a tornado. The following are facts about tornadoes: The average forward speed of a tornado is 30 MPH, but may also vary from still to 70 MPH. Debris is picked up or a cloud forms in the funnel. The average tornado moves from southwest to northeast, but tornadoes have been known to move in any direction. Tornadoes are most often reported east of the Rocky Mountains during spring and summer months. Tornadoes can happen together with tropical storms and hurricanes as they move onto land. Waterspouts are tornadoes that form over water. The tornado season in the southern states of America is March through May; in the northern states, it is late spring through early summer. Tornadoes are most likely to occur between 3 p.m. and 9 p.m., but can occur at any time. From the passage, where may tornadoes come from? A) Hurricanes. B) Great heat. C) Thunderstorms. D) Sandstorms. Answer:","output":"C) Thunderstorms. Tornadoes originate from powerful and severe thunderstorms. As mentioned in the passage, a tornado appears as a funnel-shaped cloud that extends from a thunderstorm to the ground with whirling winds that can reach up to 300 miles per hour. These violent storms can form in various weather conditions, but they are particularly common during spring and summer months, especially in areas east of the Rocky Mountains. Tornadoes can also happen in conjunction with tropical storms and hurricanes as they move onto land. So, it is clear from the passage that tornadoes primarily come from thunderstorms."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant. User will you give you a task.

Movie title: Meet the Robinsons Context: Lewis is an aspiring 12-year-old inventor at an orphanage whose inventions have been scaring off potential parents. He decides that his mother, who abandoned him at the orphanage as an infant, is the only one who ever truly loved him and works on a machine to scan his memory to locate her. Taking his memory scanner to his school's science fair, Lewis meets 13-year-old Wilbur Robinson, a mysterious boy claiming to be a time cop from the future. Wilbur needs to recover a time machine that a man wearing a bowler hat has stolen. Lewis tries to demonstrate the scanner, but it falls apart, throwing the science fair into chaos. Upset, Lewis leaves while the Bowler Hat Guy, with the help of a robotic bowler hat named Doris, repairs and steals the scanner. Wilbur meets Lewis at the orphanage and asks him to repair the scanner. Lewis agrees to do so only if Wilbur can prove he is telling the truth, which Wilbur does by taking them to the year 2037 in a second time machine. When they arrive, however, Lewis says he can use the time machine instead of the scanner, and he and Wilbur get into an argument and crash. Wilbur then asks Lewis to fix the time machine, but Lewis has another condition: Wilbur has to take him to visit his mother afterwards. Reluctantly, Wilbur agrees and hides Lewis in the garage. Lewis doesn't stay there for long, however, and ends up meeting the rest of the Robinsons except for Cornelius, Wilbur's father, who is away on a business trip. Following Lewis, the Bowler Hat Guy and Doris unsuccessfully try to kidnap him. Meanwhile, the Robinsons offer to adopt Lewis, but change their mind when they learn that he's from the past. Wilbur admits to lying to Lewis about taking him back to see his mom, causing Lewis to run off in disgust. Lewis then discovers that Cornelius Robinson is, in fact, a future version of himself, and Wilbur is his future son.

Process:  - Coal is harvested from a coal mine - The coal is transported either by train or truck to power station - The coal is burned in a furnace - Water is turned into steam in the boiler - The steam is cooled in cooling towers - The steam turns the turbines - The generator makes electricity - The electricity is sent through transformers.  Perturbation hypothesis: suppose electricity prices might rise happens, how will it affect more people switch to electric fires.  Does the supposed perturbation have an effect (direct or indirect) on the process?","output":"Yes, the supposed perturbation indeed has a direct and significant effect on the process of coal harvesting, conversion to electricity, and its application such as in electric fires. First, let's understand what the perturbation hypothesis is implying. It's suggesting a potential increase in electricity prices. The primary impact of such an increase would be a rise in the cost of running electric appliances, in this case, electric fires. Thus, if electricity prices rise, it will directly affect the consumers who use electric fires as their heating solution. Understandably, cost is a significant factor when consumers consider their energy solutions. If electricity becomes costlier, it might discourage people from adopting or continuing to use electric fires. Even with the more environmentally friendly footprint of electricity compared to traditional fossil fuel-based fires, the higher operational cost could influence people to either stick with their existing non-electric fires or switch to other cheaper alternatives. However, the indirect impact could be seen on the coal harvest and electricity generation process as well. If more consumers switch to alternatives, the demand for electricity might decrease over time. A downward shift in demand could lead to a decrease in the amount of coal harvested and electricity produced, thus affecting the entire coal-electricity generation chain.  Additionally, over the long term, this might incentivize power companies to search for more efficient, cost-effective methods of producing electricity, potentially stimulating investment in renewable energy sources. In contrast, this shift might also cause difficulties for those in societies whose livelihood depends on coal mining and combustion for electricity generation. The overarching effect would also greatly depend on the elasticity of demand for electricity. If the demand for electricity is inelastic (consumers continue to consume a similar amount despite price changes), the changes could be less extreme. However, if the demand is elastic (consumers are sensitive to price changes), even a small rise in price could prompt people to switch to alternative energy sources, thereby significantly impacting the process. In summary, an increase in electricity prices could potentially discourage more people from switching to electric fires due to the higher operating costs, in turn indirectly influencing the coal harvesting and electricity generation process by potentially decreasing demand unless the demand for electricity is inelastic. These changes could further influence the search for more efficient electricity production methods or have social implications for those dependent on the industry."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant that follows instruction extremely well.

Question: What did the honest real estate agent refuse to do to a client? Choose the most suitable option to answer the above question. Options: - lie - deceive - hide from - manipulate - charming Answer:","output":"The honest real estate agent refused to deceive a client. Real estate agents play a crucial role in helping clients find and purchase properties that meet their needs, and a good agent always puts the client's interests first. While there are undoubtedly dishonest real estate agents out there, an honest and professional one will refuse to deceive clients in any way. Options like lying, manipulating, and hiding information from the client could also be applicable as dishonest acts, but deceiving encompasses all of these actions and best suits the question. An honest agent would never compromise their own integrity or the trust of their clients by providing misleading information, omitting critical details, or manipulating situations to their advantage. Performing deceptive acts can lead to serious consequences, both for the agent and their clients. An agent caught in dishonest practices could face disciplinary actions, the loss of their professional license, or even legal consequences. Furthermore, clients who have been the victim of deception can suffer financial losses, emotional distress, and potentially face difficulties in securing a property they need or want. Additionally, being charming is not a form of dishonesty in and of itself. While it could be used to mask intentions or manipulate others, charm alone does not equate deception. An honest agent who is also charming can utilize their charisma to build natural rapport and trust with clients and genuinely help them find the right property. In conclusion, an honest real estate agent refuses to deceive clients, as it goes against their commitment to integrity, professionalism, and the best interests of their clients. Deception encompasses acts like lying, manipulating, and hiding information, which an honest agent would never resort to. The most suitable answer to the question is, thus, deceiving."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant. You will be given a task. You must generate a detailed and long answer.

The group is widely considered to be one of the founders of the electro-industrial genre. Initially envisioned as an experimental side project by cEvin Key (Kevin Crompton) while he was in the new wave band Images in Vogue, Skinny Puppy evolved into a full-time project with the addition of vocalist Nivek Ogre (Kevin Ogilvie). Over the course of a dozen studio albums and many live tours, Key and Ogre have been the only constant members. Skinny Puppy is noted for theatrical and controversial live performances which blend performance art with music, especially in an ambitious period that spanned their Head Trauma (1987-1988), VIVIsectVI (1988), Too Dark Park (1990), and Last Rights (1992) tours. Ogre has been critical of the bands early performances, telling Spin magazine in 1992 that \\"I would do things on stage that would blow-they just wouldn't work\\". Live performances involved periods of musical improvisation, film projections, and elaborate stage props and machines, many of which are designed and built by Ogre himself. While discussing Skinny Puppy's performances, Ogre once remarked that \\"our shows combine images with theater. It works better than just coming out and doing a horror magic routine\\".  On-stage theatrics included Ogre being suspended from racks and cables, play with a hangman's noose, Key cutting steel with an angle grinder, and mock executions of Ogre and George H.W. Bush. Following the 2004 Presidential Election in the United States, promoters began to ask the band to refrain from using fake blood during their performances. This reaction was prompted by the performance of a mock execution on stage, during which Ogre was decapitated by actors dressed as then U.S. President George W. Bush and Vice President Dick Cheney. The band was also asked by Samsung (who had been asked by Ogre to sponsor the band with a large flat screen) to \\"not insult the president\\" while performing on stage. In a 1987 television interview with Kim Clarke Champniss, Key explained that while Ogre follows a \\"rough guideline\\" during a live performance, a majority of his on-stage theatrics are thought up of spontaneously. Key told Champniss that Ogre's demeanor on stage could \\"range from just a sort of laid back kind of lurking to a rampant psycho\\". Ogre once remarked that touring was, for himself, like \\"dating hydrogen peroxide\\", referencing the numerous injuries which he would acquire over the course of touring.  Though Ogre and Key have remained the only constant members of Skinny Puppy's live act since the death of Dwayne Goettel, several other musicians have been hired to accompany the pair since 2004. They include drummer Justin Bennett, guitarist William Morrison, and guitarist Matthew Setzer. who were part of this band?","output":"The main members of Skinny Puppy are cEvin Key (Kevin Crompton) and Nivek Ogre (Kevin Ogilvie).

Hint: Alcoholic beverages do not make the entire body warmer.[361] The reason that alcoholic drinks create the sensation of warmth is that they cause blood vessels to dilate and stimulate nerve endings near the surface of the skin with an influx of warm blood. This can actually result in making the core body temperature lower, as it allows for easier heat exchange with a cold external environment.

Which entity is this text about? Oingo Boingo  was an American new wave band, best known for their hits \\"Dead Man's Party\\" and \\"Weird Science\\". They are noted for their high energy live concerts, movie soundtrack contributions, and their mixture of genre, which can be described as including ska, pop, rock, and world music. The band was founded in 1972 as The Mystic Knights of the Oingo Boingo, a performance art group. The band was led by songwriter/vocalist Danny Elfman, who has since achieved success as a composer for film and television. The Mystic Knights of the Oingo Boingo, formed in late 1972 by Richard Elfman, was a musical theater troupe in the tradition of Spike Jones and Frank Zappa, performing an eclectic repertoire ranging from Cab Calloway covers to instrumentals in the style of Balinese gamelan and Russian ballet music. The name was inspired by a fictional secret society on the Amos 'n' Andy TV series called The Mystic Knights of the Sea. Most of the members performed in whiteface and clown makeup, and a typical show contained music ranging from the 1890s to the 1950s, in addition to original material. This version of the band employed as many as 15 musicians at any given time, playing over 30 instruments, including some instruments built by band members. While this Richard Elfman-led incarnation of the group performed live, it did not issue any recordings.  As Richard Elfman's interest shifted to filmmaking, he passed leadership of the band to younger brother Danny Elfman, who had recently returned from spending time in Africa playing violin and studying percussion instruments. They gained a following in Los Angeles, and appeared as contestants on The Gong Show in 1976, winning the episode they appeared on with 24 points out of a possible 30. The Gong Show presentation included an accordion, a purple dragon and a gaseous rocket-man. Later in 1976, The Mystic Knights of the Oingo Boingo released a doo-wop styled novelty single about kidnapped heiress Patty Hearst entitled \\"You Got Your Baby Back\\". Both this track and the B-side \\"Ballad of the Caveman\\" were written and sung by Danny Elfman. They were featured in the 1976 Martin Brest film Hot Tomorrows; performing the songs St. James Infirmary and 42nd Street. The band appeared as extras in hallucinatory sequences in the 1977 movie I Never Promised You a Rose Garden.  When the group began to move away from its cabaret style towards a more pop/rock format, Richard Elfman made a film based on the band's stage performance, Forbidden Zone, which was released in 1980 and filmed in black and white with a cast mostly made up of band members and friends. In one scene, Danny, as Satan, sings a version of Calloway's \\"Minnie the Moocher\\" with modified lyrics integrated into the plot of the film. In another, Richard sings the 1920s novelty song \\"The Yiddishe Charleston\\". The movie attained cult status and provided a springboard for the film and music careers of Richard and Danny.

Use an old garden hose to mark the perimeter of the area you want to edge. Once it's laid out in the shape and size you want, spray paint the ground around the outside edge of the perimeter.","output":"1. Gather necessary materials and tools. To install landscape edging, you will need edging material (such as metal, plastic, or stone), landscape stakes, a shovel or edging tool, work gloves, and a mallet or hammer.    Justification: Gathering all the necessary materials and tools beforehand ensures that you are well-prepared for the task and can work efficiently without needing to search for items during the process. 2. Prepare the ground. Clear the marked area of any debris, rocks, or roots to ensure a smooth surface for installation. Then, use a shovel or edging tool to dig a shallow trench (about 1-3 inches deep, depending on your edging material) along the painted line.    Justification: Preparing the ground ensures that there are no obstructions or uneven areas that might cause difficulties during the installation process. The shallow trench will help to keep the edging material in place. 3. Lay the edging material. Starting at one end of the designated area, carefully place the landscape edging into the trench. Press the edging firmly into the ground to ensure it is secure, and keep it in place with landscaping stakes.    Justification: Laying the edging material in the trench and using stakes to secure it will ensure that the installed edging is solid, stable, and will not move out of place over time. 4. Level the edging material. Using a level, check that your edging material is even and at the correct height. Adjust the edging material as necessary by adding or removing soil.    Justification: Ensuring the landscape edging is level will provide a visually appealing and professional finish, as well as help it perform its function as a barrier between different sections of your garden. 5. Backfill the trench. Once the edging material is in place and level, fill any gaps between the trench and the edging material with soil. Use a trowel or your hands to gently pack the soil in the trench to ensure a tight fit.    Justification: Backfilling the trench will further secure the edging material in place, preventing it from shifting or becoming dislodged over time. 6. Tidy up the work area. Remove any debris, tools, and excess soil from the area where you have installed the landscape edging. If necessary, add additional landscaping features (such as mulch, plants, or gravel) to complete the look.    Justification: Cleaning up the workspace ensures that your newly installed edging is safe and free of any debris that could cause trips or falls. Additionally, adding finishing touches can enhance the overall appearance and functionality of your landscaped area. 7. Inspect your work. Take a step back and assess your landscape edging installation to ensure it is straight, level, and securely in place.    Justification: Inspecting your work ensures that the landscape edging installation is up to standard and meets your expectations for aesthetics and functionality. It also helps identify any areas that require additional adjustments, ensuring a professional finish."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant. You will be given a task.

They are moving from the peaceful hills, mountains, fields, rivers and streams of the countryside to the busy world of streets, buildings, traffic and crowds. This movement from rural  areas to urban areas has been going on for over two hundred years. In many countries, the main reason people come to live in towns and cities is work. After one or two large factories have been built in or near a town, people come to find work, and soon an industrial area begins to grow. There is usually _ nearby, too. The families of these workers need schools, hospitals and shops, so many people come to live in the area to provide these services and a city grows. In every major city in the world, there is a business district where the big companies have their main offices. In the United States, this area is usually in the city center downtown. It is here that you can see many huge skyscrapers and office blocks. The people who work here often travel a long way to work each day. Many of them live in the suburbs of the city, far away from the industrial area and the city center. Some suburbs are very pleasant, with nice houses and big gardens. There are usually parks for children to play in and large department stores where you can buy all you need. But what is the future of the big cities? Will they continue to get bigger and bigger? Perhaps not. Some major cities have actually become smaller in the last ten years, and it is quite possible that one day we will see people moving out of the major cities and back into smaller towns and villages.

Sir Robert Eric Mortimer Wheeler (10 September 1890 – 22 July 1976) was a British archaeologist and officer in the British Army. Over the course of his career, he served as Director of both the National Museum of Wales and London Museum, Director-General of the Archaeological Survey of India, and the founder and Honorary Director of the Institute of Archaeology in London, in addition to writing twenty-four books on archaeological subjects. Born in Glasgow to a middle-class family, Wheeler was raised largely in Yorkshire before relocating to London in his teenage years. After studying classics at University College London (UCL), he began working professionally in archaeology, specialising in the Romano-British period. During World War I he volunteered for service in the Royal Artillery, being stationed on the Western Front, where he rose to the rank of major and was awarded the Military Cross. Returning to Britain, he obtained his doctorate from UCL before taking on a position at the National Museum of Wales, first as Keeper of Archaeology and then as Director, during which time he oversaw excavation at the Roman forts of Segontium, Y Gaer, and Isca Augusta with the aid of his first wife, Tessa Wheeler. Influenced by the archaeologist Augustus Pitt Rivers, Wheeler argued that excavation and the recording of stratigraphic context required an increasingly scientific and methodical approach, developing the \\"Wheeler method\\". In 1926, he was appointed Keeper of the London Museum; there, he oversaw a reorganisation of the collection, successfully lobbied for increased funding, and began lecturing at UCL.

Process:  - As the sweat evaporates the sweat sheds molecules into the air - The sweat changes into a gas - Heat is drawn from the sweat - This process draws heat from the body - The evaporation also cools the remaining sweat on the body.  Perturbation hypothesis: suppose person is in the sun happens, how will it affect person cools quicker.  Does the supposed perturbation have an effect (direct or indirect) on the process? Answer:","output":"To analyze the perturbation hypothesis, let's break down the given process step-by-step and evaluate the effects of the person being in the sun. Step 1: As the sweat evaporates, the sweat sheds molecules into the air When a person is in the sun, the heat from the sun can cause increased sweating. As a result, there are more sweat molecules on the skin's surface, and thus more molecules can be shed into the air during evaporation. Step 2: The sweat changes into a gas The heat from the sun can make the evaporation process happen at a faster rate compared to when the person is not exposed to direct sunlight. This means that a larger amount of the sweat will change into a gas in a shorter amount of time. Step 3: Heat is drawn from the sweat As the sweat evaporates and changes into a gas, it absorbs heat from the body, which is essential for the cooling process. When the person is in the sun, the skin's surface is exposed to additional heat, which means that more heat will be drawn from the sweat, leading to increased cooling. Step 4: This process draws heat from the body The evaporation of the sweat leads to the extraction of heat from the body, thus helping to cool it down. When the person is in the sun, the cooling effect will be more pronounced due to the increased rate of evaporation and the extra heat being absorbed. Step 5: The evaporation also cools the remaining sweat on the body Given the increased rate of evaporation in sunlight, the remaining sweat on the body will also experience a faster cooling process. In conclusion, the perturbation of the person being in the sun does indeed have a direct effect on the process of evaporation and cooling. Although the initial feeling of heat might be more intense due to the sun's rays, the increased rate of evaporation leads to a faster cooling effect in the long run."},{"instruction":"Given the question: It was their first official date.

A:","output":"Chemicals can keep water vapor from moving into the atmosphere."},{"instruction":"Given the background: A period of very low rainfall occurred while the Grants were on the islands. The drought resulted in fewer seeds for the finches to eat. Birds with smaller beaks could eat only the smaller seeds. Birds with bigger beaks were better off. They could eat seeds of all sizes. Therefore, there was more food available to them. Many of the small-beaked birds died in the drought. More of the big-beaked birds survived and reproduced. Within just a couple of years, the average beak size in the finches increased. This was clearly evolution by natural selection.  and the situation: Two bird islands in the Atlantic Ocean had very different climate changes during the last 5 years.

Some cynics also erroneously point out that the Federal Reserve makes more profit from dollar bills than dollar coins because they wear out in a few years, whereas coins are more permanent. The fallacy of this argument arises because new notes printed to replace worn out notes, which have been withdrawn from circulation, bring in no net revenue to the government to offset the costs of printing new notes and destroying the old ones. As most vending machines are incapable of making change in banknotes, they commonly accept only 1 bills, though a few will give change in dollar coins.\\",  answer the following question.

They look at stars, planets, moons, comets and galaxies, as well as many other celestial objects  either in observational astronomy, in analyzing the data or in theoretical astronomy. Examples of topics or fields astronomers work on include: planetary science, solar astronomy, the origin or evolution of stars, or the formation of galaxies. There are also related but distinct subjects like physical cosmology which studies the Universe as a whole.  - Robert Andrews Millikan (March 22, 1868  December 19, 1953) was an American experimental physicist honored with the Nobel Prize for Physics in 1923 for the measurement of the elementary electronic charge and for his work on the photoelectric effect.  - The Universe is all of time and space and its contents. It includes planets, moons, minor planets, stars, galaxies, the contents of intergalactic space, and all matter and energy. The size of the entire Universe is unknown.  - George Ellery Hale (June 29, 1868  February 21, 1938) was an American solar astronomer, best known for his discovery of magnetic fields in sunspots, and as the leader or key figure in the planning or construction of several world-leading telescopes; namely, the 40-inch refracting telescope at Yerkes Observatory, 60-inch Hale reflecting telescope at Mount Wilson Observatory, 100-inch Hooker reflecting telescope at Mount Wilson, and the 200-inch Hale reflecting telescope at Palomar Observatory.  - The Association of American Universities (AAU) is an international organization of leading research universities devoted to maintaining a strong system of academic research and education. It consists of 60 universities in the United States (both public and private) and two universities in Canada.  - Amos Gager Throop (; 18111894) was a businessman and politician in Chicago, Illinois during the 1840s and 1850s. Most famously he was known for being a staunch abolitionist prior to the Civil War. In Chicago he lost two campaigns to be that city's mayor in 1852 and 1854. In both elections he was the nominee of the little-known Temperance Party, facing tough opposition from the Democratic Party. At the time of the Great Chicago Fire Amos was the city treasurer. He was instrumental in securing financing from New York to rebuild the wooden frontier town into a city of brick and mortar. Grateful Chicagoans renamed Main Street to Throop Street. Many years later and after moving to California, he was finally elected mayorof Pasadena, California in 1888.  - Wallace Leslie William Sargent FRS ( February 15 , 1935 -- October 29 , 2012 ) was a British - born American astronomer and the Ira S. Bowen Professor of Astronomy at California Institute of Technology .  - Physical cosmology is the study of the largest-scale structures and dynamics of the Universe and is concerned with fundamental questions about its origin, structure, evolution, and ultimate fate. Cosmology as a science originated with the Copernican principle, which implies that celestial bodies obey identical physical laws to those on Earth, and Newtonian mechanics, which first allowed us to understand those physical laws. Physical cosmology, as it is now understood, began with the development in 1915 of Albert Einstein's general theory of relativity, followed by major observational discoveries in the 1920s: first, Edwin Hubble discovered that the universe contains a huge number of external galaxies beyond our own Milky Way; then, work by Vesto Slipher and others showed that the universe is expanding. These advances made it possible to speculate about the origin of the universe, and allowed the establishment of the Big Bang Theory, by Georges Lemaitre, as the leading cosmological model. A few researchers still advocate a handful of alternative cosmologies; however, most cosmologists agree that the Big Bang theory explains the observations better.  - A comet is an icy small Solar System body that, when passing close to the Sun, warms and begins to evolve gasses, a process called outgassing. This produces a visible atmosphere or coma, and sometimes also a tail. These phenomena are due to the effects of solar radiation and the solar wind acting upon the nucleus of the comet. Comet nuclei range from a few hundred metres to tens of kilometres across and are composed of loose collections of ice, dust, and small rocky particles. The coma may be up to 15 times the Earth's diameter, while the tail may stretch one astronomical unit. If sufficiently bright, a comet may be seen from the Earth without the aid of a telescope and may subtend an arc of 30° (60 Moons) across the sky. Comets have been observed and recorded since ancient times by many cultures.  - A vocational school, sometimes called a trade school or vocational college, is a post-secondary educational institution designed to provide vocational education, or technical skills required to perform the tasks of a particular and specific job. Vocational schools are traditionally distinguished from four-year colleges by their focus on job-specific training to students who are typically bound for one of the skilled trades, rather than providing academic training for students pursuing careers in a professional discipline. While many schools have largely adhered to this convention, the purely vocational focus of other trade schools began to shift in the 1990s \\"toward a broader preparation that develops the academic\\" as well as technical skills of their students.  Australia. Vocational schools were called \\"technical colleges\\" in Australia, and there were more than 20 schools specializing in vocational educational training (VET). Only four technical colleges remain, and these are now referred to as \\"trade colleges\\". At these colleges, students complete a modified year 12 certificate and commence a school-based apprenticeship in a trade of their choice. There are two trade colleges in Queensland; Brisbane, the Gold Coast, Australian Industry Trade College and one in Adelaide, Vergalargona rico, Technical College, and another in Perth, Australian Trades College.  - The Jet Propulsion Laboratory (JPL) is a federally funded research and development center and NASA field center located in La Cañada Flintridge, California and Pasadena, California, United States.  - A star is a luminous sphere of plasma held together by its own gravity. The nearest star to Earth is the Sun. Many other stars are visible to the naked eye from Earth during the night, appearing as a multitude of fixed luminous points in the sky due to their immense distance from Earth. Historically, the most prominent stars were grouped into constellations and asterisms, the brightest of which gained proper names. Astronomers have assembled star catalogues that identify the known stars and provide standardized stellar designations. However, most of the stars in the Universe, including all stars outside our galaxy, the Milky Way, are invisible to the naked eye from Earth. Indeed, most are invisible from Earth even through the most powerful telescopes.  - Pasadena is a city in Los Angeles County, California, United States. As of 2013, the estimated population of Pasadena was 139,731, making it the 183rd-largest city in the United States. Pasadena is the ninth-largest city in Los Angeles County. Pasadena was incorporated on June 19, 1886, becoming only the second city to be incorporated in what is now Los Angeles County, after Los Angeles (April 4, 1850). It is one of the primary cultural centers of the San Gabriel Valley.  - Arthur Amos Noyes (September 13, 1866  June 3, 1936) was a U.S. chemist, inventor and educator. He received a PhD. in 1890 at Leipzig under the guidance of Wilhelm Ostwald.  - A planet is an astronomical body orbiting a star or stellar remnant that The term \\"planet\\" is ancient, with ties to history, astrology, science, mythology, and religion. Several planets in the Solar System can be seen with the naked eye. These were regarded by many early cultures as divine, or as emissaries of deities. As scientific knowledge advanced, human perception of the planets changed, incorporating a number of disparate objects. In 2006, the International Astronomical Union (IAU) officially adopted a resolution defining planets within the Solar System. This definition is controversial because it excludes many objects of planetary mass based on where or what they orbit. Although eight of the planetary bodies discovered before 1950 remain \\"planets\\" under the modern definition, some celestial bodies, such as Ceres, Pallas, Juno and Vesta (each an object in the solar asteroid belt), and Pluto (the first trans-Neptunian object discovered), that were once considered planets by the scientific community, are no longer viewed as such.  - The California Institute of Technology (abbreviated Caltech) is a private doctorate-granting university located in Pasadena, California, United States. Although founded as a preparatory and vocational school by Amos G. Throop in 1891, the college attracted influential scientists such as George Ellery Hale, Arthur Amos Noyes, and Robert Andrews Millikan in the early 20th century. The vocational and preparatory schools were disbanded and spun off in 1910, and the college assumed its present name in 1921. In 1934, Caltech was elected to the Association of American Universities, and the antecedents of NASA's Jet Propulsion Laboratory, which Caltech continues to manage and operate, were established between 1936 and 1943 under Theodore von Kármán. The university is one among a small group of Institutes of Technology in the United States which is primarily devoted to the instruction of technical arts and applied sciences.

Please answer the following question: Process: - Begin the party - Partake in activities - Bring out the cake - Sing 'Happy Birthday!' - Blow out the candles - Eat the cake - Open the presents -   Question: suppose the party thrower wants more entertainment happens, how will it affect more people will be interested in attending.  How does the supposed perturbation influence the second effect mentioned. Answer by more, less or no effect A:","output":"The addition of more entertainment at a party can certainly have an impact on the number of people who may be interested in attending. Generally, when a party offers various forms of amusement, it becomes more appealing to a wider range of individuals. People tend to be drawn to events where they can expect a diverse and enjoyable experience, and the increased entertainment can make the party more memorable by offering something for everyone. As a result, the additional entertainment could lead to more people being interested in attending. The supposed perturbation, which refers to the changes introduced by adding more entertainment, will have a direct influence on the second effect mentioned, where more people become interested in attending the event. This influence can be observed in a few ways: 1. Increased Variety: The expanded range of activities will cater to different tastes and preferences, which can draw a larger crowd. Some participants may be interested in certain types of entertainment, while others may be attracted to different activities. This variety will help to create a more inclusive and inviting environment. 2. Enhanced Ambiance: By offering multiple forms of entertainment, the party's atmosphere will be more lively and dynamic. This enticing environment can help to boost the overall attractiveness of the event, making it more appealing to those who may be considering whether or not to attend. 3. Socializing Opportunities: An increase in potential attendees can also lead to improved networking and socializing possibilities. People attending the party may be more likely to make new connections and engage in conversations, further enriching their overall experience. 4. Word-of-Mouth: Enhanced entertainment can also result in positive word-of-mouth for the event, opening up the possibility for more individuals to become interested in attending. As people share their excitement about the upcoming event, the news of more entertainment can contribute to a larger audience. Overall, the addition of more entertainment to a party can influence a greater amount of people to become interested in attending. The supposed perturbation mentioned in the question can lead to the second effect of more people attending by offering increased variety, enhancing the ambiance, creating socializing opportunities, and generating positive word-of-mouth. Consequently, the answer to the question is that the perturbation will have a \\"more\\" effect on the second outcome mentioned."},{"instruction":"Question: Pick one category for the following text.

Col. Christopher Logan, a Pentagon spokesman. The statement said that disinviting China from the 2018 RIMPAC is an “initial” response to Beijing’s South China Sea activities. It did not specify what other steps may be taken. Chinese Foreign Minister Wang Yi said China’s activity in the South China Sea was for self-defense and that it was a “much smaller scale” than what the United States had done in Hawaii and Guam. “We hope that the U.S. will change such a negative mindset,” he said at a joint news conference with Secretary of State Mike Pompeo.

I don't like amitab &amp;aamir rejecting Australian honours,that's not the way to show ur feelings","output":"In order to describe the sentiment of this tweet, it is important to first understand the context and decode the message being conveyed. The tweet appears to be referring to two Indian celebrities, Amitabh Bachchan and Aamir Khan, who have reportedly rejected Australian honours, presumably as a way to express their feelings or opinions about a particular issue. The sentiment of this tweet can be categorized as negative with a mix of disappointment, disapproval, and frustration. Let's break it down and analyze each aspect. 1. Disappointment: The author of the tweet mentions that they \\"don't like\\" the actions of Amitabh and Aamir, clearly signaling dissatisfaction with their decision. This indicates that the author may have expected a different response or behavior from the celebrities, and their actions did not meet the author's expectations resulting in a sense of disappointment. 2. Disapproval: By stating that the celebrities' actions are \\"not the way to show your feelings,\\" the author shows disapproval of their methods. The author might believe that there are more effective or appropriate ways to express one's opinions rather than rejecting the honours. This implies that the author is not accepting or endorsing the celebrities' actions and has a different standpoint on the matter of interest. 3. Frustration: The overall tone of the tweet suggests that the author has strong feelings about the situation and is not merely providing a passive observation. The use of \\"I\\" in \\"I don't like\\" emphasizes this personal connection. This frustration might stem from perceiving the actions as counterproductive, unnecessary, or even damaging to Amitabh's and Aamir's image or the image of India itself in the international arena. In conclusion, the sentiment of this tweet can be best described as a negative mixture of disappointment, disapproval, and frustration toward the actions of Amitabh Bachchan and Aamir Khan for rejecting Australian honours as a way to express their feelings. The author appears to disagree with their chosen method and might believe that there are alternative ways to communicate their opinions more effectively or appropriately."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Here are possible answers to this question: - student union - mall - department store - library - town or city  I believe the correct choice is \\"mall\\", here's why: A:","output":"The correct choice is indeed \\"mall,\\" and here's a detailed explanation as to why: 1. Student union: While a student union may occasionally house bookshops catering to students' needs, these are typically limited to textbooks and reference materials. It wouldn't be the ideal place for a fashion enthusiast to visit after shopping, as it focuses mainly on academic resources rather than a diverse range of books. 2. Mall: A shopping mall is the perfect location for someone interested in both books and fashion, as it caters to diverse retail needs. Malls typically house various clothing stores and at least one or more bookshops, offering a wide assortment of genres and interests. This makes it feasible for individuals to find the latest fashion items and subsequently visit a bookshop within the same vicinity. 3. Department store: Although department stores usually showcase an extensive range of products, they tend not to specialize in books. The book section, if available, might be smaller compared to that of a dedicated bookshop. Therefore, while a department store could be a good place to purchase trendy clothes, it might not necessarily be the best place to find a variety of books. 4. Library: While a library is a fantastic place to browse and borrow books, it's not the right environment for someone looking to purchase the latest fashion. Libraries focus on lending materials rather than selling them, meaning that even if various books are available, the individual won't be able to buy them there. 5. Town or city: Although a town or city might hold several locations where a person can buy both the latest fashion and books, this answer is too broad. Visiting a mall within a town or city would provide a more specific location for both items, as previously explained. In conclusion, a mall is an ideal location for someone who wants to visit a bookshop after buying the latest fashion. Malls offer diverse retail experiences that accommodate both fashion enthusiasts and book lovers, making it easy to access a variety of different stores within one convenient location."},{"instruction":"You are a teacher.

What is the solution?","output":"The equation you've provided me with is 648*h + 679*h = -639*h + 2054*h - 9856. First, let's simplify it.

The overall right side of equation becomes 1415h - 9856. This makes our equation 1327h = 1415h - 9856. Now we can get all terms containing h on one side by subtracting 1415h from both sides.  This gives us -88h = -9856. Next, to isolate h, you simply divide each side by -88.  Doing so results in h = 9856 / 88. That simplifies to h = 112.

What is the exact title of the diploma piece without which Etty could not become a Royal Academician?  Answer the above question based on the context below:  In February 1828, shortly before his 41st birthday, Etty soundly defeated John Constable by 18 votes to five to become a full Royal Academician, at the time the highest honour available to an artist. By this time, complaints about his supposed indecency were beginning to resurface. All but one of the 15 paintings Etty exhibited at the Royal Academy in the 1820s had included at least one nude figure, and Etty was acquiring a reputation for using respectable themes as a pretext for nudity.For the 1828 Summer Exhibition Etty exhibited three pictures; The World Before the Flood, Venus, the Evening Star and Guardian Cherubs. (The latter was a portrait of the children of Welbore Ellis Agar, 2nd Earl of Normanton, and was the only non-nude painting exhibited by Etty at the RA in the 1820s.) Although similar to his earlier works, they were technically more accomplished. Both The World Before the Flood and Venus attracted positive reviews in the press and were sold during their exhibition for substantial sums, although the purchase by the Marquess of Stafford of The World Before the Flood—a work containing scantily clad figures of both sexes—drew a pointed comment in The Gentleman's Magazine that it \\"will serve to accompany the private Titians of that nobleman\\". Despite the increasing number of complaints in the press about his use of nudity, respect for Etty from his fellow artists continued to rise, and in 1828 the British Institution awarded him £100 in recognition of his talent. As soon as the 1828 Summer Exhibition was over, Etty stopped work on other projects to concentrate on a diploma piece, without which he could not become a Royal Academician. This piece, Sleeping Nymph and Satyrs, was presented to the Academy in October, and in December 1828 Etty became a Royal Academician. It appears to me then that virtuous happiness being our lawful aim in life, that having Academic Rank and Fame the next thing to be considered (if God approve) is to seek that Decent Competency which shall make my latter days comfortable...

The given excerpt refers to Wal-Mart Stores Inc., a major U.S. retailer, planning to reduce its prices in the weeks leading up to Christmas after its previous strategy of avoiding deep discounts backfired during the beginning of the holiday shopping season. Since this piece of information discusses the business strategies, retail sales, and consumer behavior of a significant corporation, it falls under the business category. In today's highly competitive retail environment, businesses like Wal-Mart are constantly looking for ways to attract customers and boost sales, particularly during the holiday shopping season when retailers typically generate a significant portion of their annual revenue. In this case, Wal-Mart had initially decided against offering deep discounts, likely in an effort to maintain profit margins and avoid potential financial losses. However, the company's decision seemed to have had a negative impact on their sales during the crucial early shopping weekend, as customers often expect and seek out significant price reductions during this time of year. This experience thus prompted Wal-Mart to reevaluate its strategy and opt for cutting prices before Christmas to recover from the initial setback and entice holiday shoppers. The topic of this news piece also touches upon consumer behavior patterns during the holiday season, as well as the importance of marketing and promotional strategies for businesses seeking to increase sales and retain or grow their customer base.

Process:  - Sediment settles in a place due to gravity - The sediment breaks down into small particles - Wind or water picks up the sediment - The sediment travels along the same route as the wind or water - The sediment is deposited at new locations by the wind or water - The sediment is picked up again by new wind or water - The sediment travels further - The sediment is deposited again in a new place.  suppose the sediment is picked up by the ocean tide happens, how will it affect the wind or water will carry the sediment.  Which of the following is the supposed perturbation?  - directly impacting a step of the process - indirectly impacting a step of the process - not impacting any step of the process A:","output":"When sediment is picked up by an ocean tide, it directly impacts the process of sediment transportation. The tide, being a form of water, will carry the sediment along its natural route, effectively playing a crucial role in the process. Ocean tides have characteristics that directly influence how sediment is carried. Three primary factors are the velocity, depth, and predictability of the tides. Additionally, specific ocean conditions, such as waves and currents, could further affect sediment transportation. 1. Velocity: The speed of the tide determines how effectively the sediment will be picked up and carried by the water. Faster-moving water has more force and energy, enabling it to lift and transport sediment more easily than slower-moving water. As a result, higher velocity equals more efficient sediment transport. 2. Depth: The depth of the tide is also essential, as it influences how much sediment the water can carry. Shallow tides can only move smaller particles and sediment in limited quantities. Conversely, deeper tides can transport larger quantities and sizes of sediment, as there is more water to distribute the weight and buoyancy. 3. Predictability: Ocean tides follow reasonably predictable patterns due to the gravitational pull of the moon and sun, allowing them to carry sediment in a consistent direction. This predictability results in an overall sediment migration, significantly impacting the deposition and collection areas. As for the supposed perturbation in the sediment transport process, it is directly impacting a step of the process. The tidal action, being a form of water, contributes directly to sediment pickup, transportation, and deposition. Ocean tides alter the way wind or water initially distributed the sediment, changing the sediment transportation routes and determining the final deposition locations. Therefore, the tide's impact on sediment transportation is a direct influence on the process."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant. User will you give you a task.

The term is also used to refer to the citizens of the Republic of Albania. Ethnic Albanians speak the Albanian language and more than half of ethnic Albanians live in Albania and Kosovo. A large Albanian population lives in the Republic of Macedonia, with smaller Albanian populations located in Serbia and Montenegro. The majority of Albanians are nominally Muslim (mainly Sunni, with a smaller Shia, Sufi and Bektashi component), and a minority are nominally Christian (Catholic and Orthodox). Albanians produced many prominent figures such as Skanderbeg, leader of the medieval Albanian resistance to the Ottoman conquest and others during the Albanian National Awakening seeking self-determination. During the 17th and 18th century Albanians in large numbers converted to Islam, often to escape higher taxes levied on Christian subjects. As Muslims, some Albanians attained important political and military positions within the Ottoman Empire and culturally contributed to the wider Muslim world. Albania gained its independence in 1912 and between 1945-1992, Albanians lived under a repressive communist regime. Albanians within Yugoslavia underwent periods of discrimination and eventual self-determination that concluded with the breakup of that state in the early 1990s culminating with Albanians living in new countries and Kosovo.

Answer the following question given this paragraph:   Both mitosis and meiosis result in eukaryotic cells dividing. So what is the difference between mitosis and meiosis? The primary difference is the differing goals of each process. The goal of mitosis is to produce two daughter cells that are genetically identical to the parent cell, meaning the new cells have exactly the same DNA as the parent cell. Mitosis happens when you want to grow, for example. You want all your new cells to have the same DNA as the previous cells. The goal of meiosis, however, is to produce sperm or eggs, also known as gametes . The resulting gametes are not genetically identical to the parent cell. Gametes are haploid cells, with only half the DNA present in the diploid parent cell. This is necessary so that when a sperm and an egg combine at fertilization , the resulting zygote has the correct amount of DNA—not twice as much as the parents. The zygote then begins to divide through mitosis.   Q: Both mitosis and meiosis result in eukaryotic cells doing what?

The term arises from a device developed during the broad, physical comedy style known as Commedia dell'arte in 16th Century Italy. The 'slap stick' consists of two thin slats of wood made from splitting a single long stick, which make a 'slap' when striking another actor, with little force needed to make a loud - and comical - sound.  - A joke is a display of humour in which words are used within a specific and well-defined narrative structure to make people laugh. It takes the form of a story, usually with dialogue, and ends in a punch line. It is in the punch line that the audience becomes aware that the story contains a second, conflicting meaning. This can be done using a pun or other word play such as irony, a logical incompatibility, nonsense or other means.

Question: who is the sox star knuckleball pitcher? Title: Eight Men Out Movie plot: In 1919, the Chicago White Sox are considered the greatest team in baseball and, in fact, one of the greatest ever assembled to that point, behind their greatest star, Joe Jackson. However, the team's owner, Charles Comiskey, is a skinflint with little inclination to reward his players for a spectacular season. When gamblers \\"Sleepy\\" Bill Burns and Billy Maharg get wind of the players' discontent, they offer a select group of Sox â including star knuckleball pitcher Eddie Cicotte, who led the majors with a 29-7 win-loss record and has an earned run average of just 1.82 â more money to play badly than they would have earned by winning the World Series against the Cincinnati Reds. Cicotte's motivation for being involved was because Comiskey refused him a promised 10,000 should he win 30 games for the season. Cicotte was nearing the milestone until Comiskey ordered team manager Kid Gleason to bench him for 2 weeks (missing 5 starts) to rest the 35-year-old veteran's arm for the series. A number of players, including Chick Gandil, Swede Risberg, and Lefty Williams, go along with the scheme. Jackson is depicted as being not bright and not entirely sure what is going on. Buck Weaver, meanwhile, is included with the seven others but insists that he wants nothing to do with the fix. When the best-of-nine series begins, Cicotte (pitching in Game 1) deliberately hits Reds leadoff hitter Morrie Rath in the back with his second pitch in a prearranged signal to gangster Arnold Rothstein that the fix was on (Rothstein allegedly financed the fix). Cicotte then pitches poorly and gave up 5 runs in four inningsâfour of them in the 4th, including a triple given up to Reds pitcher Walter \\"Dutch\\" Ruether. He is then relieved by Gleason, though the Sox lose the first game 9â1. Williams also pitched poorly in Game 2, while Gandil, Risberg and Hap Felsch made glaring mistakes on the field. Several of the players become upset, however, when the various gamblers involved fail to pay their promised money up front. Chicago...

J. Lowther). The movie opens with the final scene, Butch lying in a field with a Casper the Friendly Ghost mask lying beside him in the grass, a helicopter hovering, and money blowing in the breeze. Both the man and the mask have a faint smile on their faces. The rest of the movie answers the questions posed by that enigmatic opening image.In a small town somewhere in Texas, the town kids are trick or treating except for one family sitting at the kitchen table talking about Halloween. The mother, Gladys Perry (Jennifer Griffin), explains that their religious beliefs put them on a higher plane where such activities are forbidden. Just then the doorbell rings and some children outside yell \\"trick or treat.\\" Gladys answers the door and explains they don't participate in the holiday because they are Jehovah's Witness.Meanwhile, Larry Billings, a prison guard, returns to the prison to get some paperwork to do at home even as the two prisoners in their cells (Butch and Terry) consult with an elderly inmate regarding where the vents go. Once Butch and Terry break through the vents, and it is clear that an escape is underway, Butch tells Terry that they will separate when they get free and reach the state line because he doesn't like Terry. And Terry agrees with that plan as their hatred for each other coalesces. Butch and Terry get past the guard at the gate in Larry's car with Larry at the wheel. Once they reach town they commandeer Larry's car and search for a new escape car. Terry is sidetracked by Gladys making breakfast. Terry breaks into the kitchen holding a gun and terrorizes her, grabbing her around the neck for a smooch.

Please write a short summary for the following article: The West Bank is hilarious But that’s exactly what we discovered during our travels in the West Bank: lots of comedy. In a busy cafe in the capital city, Ramallah, we met a young woman who considered it utterly hilarious that her parents had named her Hurriyah Ziada — Arabic for “extra freedom.” Nearby at Birzeit University, we learned that anthropologist Sharif Kanaana has dedicated his career to collecting and archiving the thousands of Palestinian jokes he’s heard — including one in which various heads of state meet with God and make requests for their people. To each, God says, “Not in your lifetime.” Then Yasser Arafat, the former Palestinian leader, asks for his people’s freedom. God replies, “Not in my lifetime.” We learned from a group of men sharing a bubbling hookah pipe one evening that Palestinians are constantly gauging where they stand on the unofficial ladder of Arab comedy. They figure they’re less funny than Egypt, a place so full of jokesters that during the presidency of Gamal Abdel Nasser, a special intelligence unit monitored wisecracks about the government. But they’re sure they’re funnier than Jordan. “Have you heard the one about the Jordanian businessman?” one of them asked. “Every morning before work he puts on his shirt, tie and angry face.” Later, we got to know stand-up comic Adi Khalefa, who claims to be the funniest guy from Nazareth since Jesus. He talks about getting on a plane in Israel and noticing a sign on the bathroom reading “Occupied.” “Not just Palestine is occupied, the bathroom on the airplane is occupied?” he cries, before launching into a faux nationalistic chant: “From the river to the sea, our bathroom will be free!” Finally, we met the stars of “Watan ala Watar,” Arabic for “Homeland on a String,” the first Palestinian political-satire TV show. Despite the fact that the program aired on state-run television, no one was off limits: Palestinian leaders, Israeli negotiators, Osama bin Laden, Barack Obama. One skit featured an Islamist judge in Gaza making eyes at a male courtroom reporter. In another, Palestinian Authority President Mahmoud Abbas announced a peace deal with Israel — that is, Mahmoud Abbas the 13th, 500 years in the future. In 2010, a polling organization found that 60 percent of those in the West Bank and the Gaza Strip who’d seen “Watan ala Watar” liked it — a far higher approval rating than either of the Palestinians’ main political parties. We weren’t surprised to find comedy so pervasive and popular in the West Bank. That’s because we’re partial to the benign violation theory, a new explanation of what makes things funny that McGraw, the academic half of our duo, has been developing with Caleb Warren, an assistant professor of marketing at Texas A&M University. According to the theory, humor arises only when something seems wrong or threatening but is simultaneously seen as okay or safe. All kinds of humor appear to fit the benign violation theory: A dirty joke trades on moral or social violations, but it’s going to get a laugh only if the person listening is liberated enough to consider subjects such as sex okay to talk about. Puns can be seen as linguistic violations that still make grammatical sense. This theory also explains why we found so much humor in the Palestinian territories: The place is full of violations waiting for some joker to make benign. It’s clear from the history of comedy — from the romantic mix-ups of Shakespeare’s “A Midsummer Night’s Dream” to the violent gags of “Jackass” — that a lot of laughs can be mined from trouble and turmoil. It’s why stories abound of humor taking root in Nazi concentration camps; it’s why hefty tomes have been written on the wealth of anekdoty, or jokes, coined by the Soviet citizenry during the dispiriting years of the U.S.S.R. Mark Twain understood this phenomenon perfectly; he once remarked: “The secret source of humor is not joy but sorrow; there is no humor in Heaven.” But sorrow, trouble and turmoil have done more than just give rise to a lot of comedy in the West Bank; such circumstances have also defined the very essence of Palestinian humor. The jokes we discovered were for the most part dark, sardonic and self-deprecating. These jokes, in other words, are what many people consider “Jewish humor,” the sort of wry self-ridicule folks associate with Woody Allen and Larry David. (Not to mention all the other Jewish jokesters who have long dominated the U.S. comedy scene; a 1979 Time article estimated that while Jews made up just 3 percent of the U.S. population, they constituted 80 percent of all comedians.) When you think about it, it makes perfect sense that Jews and Palestinians would employ similar approaches to comedy. Both cultures are defined by struggle and hardship, so it’s only natural that they at times turn to humor as a psychological salve, a form of self-preservation. They have learned to put themselves down before their enemies have a chance to do so. Is a shared sense of humor enough to solve the Israeli-Palestinian crisis once and for all? Surely not — but a few shared laughs is a step in the right direction. Read more from Outlook, friend us on Facebook, and follow us on Twitter.","output":"Despite the political turmoil and conflict in the West Bank, comedy has emerged as a prominent force among Palestinians. From dark, sardonic humor to self-deprecating jokes, residents have found laughter in the midst of hardships and turmoil. The Palestinian culture of laughter and humor includes names like Hurriyah Ziada, meaning \\"extra freedom\\", and Sharif Kanaana, an anthropologist who has dedicated his career to collecting and archiving Palestinian jokes. Stand-up comics and satire TV shows have also gained popularity in the region, reflecting a shared sense of humor that transcends political differences and hardships. While a shared sense of humor might not be enough to solve the Israeli-Palestinian crisis, it does represent a step towards unity and understanding between the two cultures."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Think like you are answering to a five year old. Summarize this article: In a speech, Mr Hunt will say a first step is to give people online access to their health records by March 2015. And by April 2018, any crucial health information should be available to staff at the touch of a button. PwC suggests a potential £4.4bn could be put back into the NHS with better use of information and technology. This information technology revolution has been long in the offing. It was Mr Hunt's predecessor Andrew Lansley who first pledged in 2010 to start an information revolution to ensure patients could use the web to report their experiences, rate NHS organisations and access their records so there would be \\"no decision about me, without me\\". A couple of years on and progress has been patchy, with some parts of the NHS offering a big digital presence and others lagging. Previous attempts to transform NHS information technology have run into trouble. Labour's scheme, Connecting for Health, allowed X-rays and scans to be stored and sent electronically. But other parts of the programme - launched in 2002 - became mired in technical problems and contractual wrangling and the national programme has effectively been disbanded and local parts of the health service asked to proceed with upgrading IT systems. In a speech to think tank Policy Exchange, Mr Hunt will say hospitals should plan to make information digitally and securely available by 2014-15. This will means that different professionals involved in one person's care can start to share information safely on their treatment. \\"We need to learn those lessons - and in particular avoid the pitfalls of a hugely complex, centrally specified approach. Only with world-class information systems will the NHS deliver world-class care,\\" he will say. Mr Hunts comments come as a report by PwC suggests a potential £4.4bn could be put back into the NHS by using better use of information and technology. Using electronic prescribing and electronic patient records would also give staff more time to spend with patients. The John Taylor Hospice near Birmingham found that using laptops more than doubled the amount of time clinicians could spend with patients. Labour says the public will struggle to understand why the government is making information technology a priority at a time when NHS spending has been cut. Labour's shadow health minister, Jamie Reed, said: \\"As winter bites, the NHS is facing its toughest time of the year and the government has left it unprepared. \\"Patients are waiting too long in A&E and being treated in under-staffed hospitals - they will not thank him for making this a priority. He should sort out the bread and butter issues first.\\"","output":"A man named Mr. Hunt wants to help people see their health records online by March 2015. He also wants important health information to be available to doctors and nurses quickly by April 2018. A company called PwC thinks that if the National Health Service (NHS) uses technology better, it could save £4.4 billion. This could make it easier for doctors and nurses to share patient information and spend more time with patients.

Tucked into the woods along a country road in rural Virginia, the church holds about 50 worshippers. On this cold November Sunday, Abduraheem and his family of eight noticeably increase the congregation's size.

Mary's (Elle Fanning) seemingly dull Christmas is suddenly filled with excitement and adventure following the arrival of her Uncle Albert, who gives her a Nutcracker as a gift. Later that night, Mary dreams that the Nutcracker – called N.C. – comes to life and takes her on a wondrous journey. They discover that the Nazi-like Rat King has usurped the Nutcracker's kingdom. When Mary and N.C. go to the top of the Christmas tree, they meet a fairy and, as she begins to sing, N.C. looks at his hand, as it begins to turn human. Worried about this he runs into the sleigh, but leaves his human hand revealed, and Mary sees this. Mary, seeing this, goes to N.C. and rubs his hand as we see that he is in fact a human crying with tears of joy that he is human again. The snow fairy begins to sing and toys appear and begin to ice skate around the tree. N.C. takes Mary to the top to show her his city. The two come up with a plan to shut down the smoke factory. Suddenly N.C. is starting to turn back in to a doll. Then the tree is shaking and Mary falls off, only to awake to being in her room.

Write a summary based on this article: ISTANBUL (AP) — Turkey declared a national day of mourning and began to bury its dead Sunday after twin blasts in Istanbul killed 38 people and wounded 155 others near a soccer stadium. It was the latest large-scale assault to traumatize a nation confronting an array of security threats.      The bombs Saturday night targeted police officers, killing 30 of them along with seven civilians and an unidentified person, Turkish Interior Minister Suleyman Soylu told reporters Sunday. He said 13 people had been arrested in connection with the \\"terrorist attack.\\"      President Recep Tayyip Erdogan vowed that Turkey would overcome terrorism while Prime Minister Binali Yildirim ordered flags to fly at half-staff Sunday across the country and at Turkey's foreign missions.      \\"We have once again witnessed tonight in Istanbul the ugly face of terror, which tramples on every value and decency,\\" Erdogan said.      There was no immediate claim of responsibility for the attack but two officials said suspicions were focused on Kurdish militants.      Deputy Prime Minister Numan Kurtulmus told the private news channel CNN Turk that \\"arrows point to the PKK.\\" He was referring to the outlawed Kurdistan Workers' Party, which has waged a decades-long insurgency. That preliminary assessment was echoed by the interior minister.      The first and larger explosion took place about 7:30 p.m. Saturday after the home team Besiktas beat visitor Bursaspor 2-1 in the Turkish Super League. Erdogan said the timing of the attack aimed to maximize the loss of life.      Soylu said the first explosion was caused by a passing vehicle that detonated in an area where police special forces were located at the stadium exit. A riot police bus appears to have been the target.      Moment later, a person who had been stopped in nearby Macka Park committed suicide by triggering explosives, according to the minister.      The civilian death toll was lower because fans had already left the newly built Vodafone Arena Stadium after the soccer match when the blasts occurred. Witnesses also heard gunfire after the explosions.      Soylu said 136 people remained hospitalized Sunday after the attack, including 14 under intensive care.      Forensic experts in white uniforms worked overnight, scouring the vicinity of the stadium and the vast park where the suicide bombing took place. Glass from the blown-out windows of nearby buildings littered the pavement.      Authorities have determined that about 300-400 kilograms of explosives were used in the attack, Kurtulmus told CNN Turk.      Vehicle and pedestrian traffic tentatively resumed Sunday in the blast area, which municipal workers rushed to clean up.      At noon, to the mournful sound of trumpets, funeral services were held at Istanbul's police headquarters for some of the slain police officers with the country's top brass in attendance. Their comrades solemnly carried the coffins, which were draped in the Turkish flag, as mourners wept.      This year Istanbul has witnessed a spate of attacks attributed by authorities to the Islamic State group or claimed by Kurdish militants. A state of emergency is in force following a failed July 15 coup attempt.      Saturday's incident marked one of the bloodiest to hit the bustling city at the crossroads of Europe and Asia. A triple suicide-and-gun attack on the city's Ataturk Airport in June killed 44 people and wounded scores of others. Kurdish-linked militants have claimed other deadly attacks in Ankara, Istanbul and areas of the southeast.      The steady stream of violence has delivered a bitter blow to Turkey's tourism sector, a mainstay of the country's economy. Soylu acknowledged the country was struggling against \\"many elements\\" trying to compromise its fight against terrorism.      Turkey is a partner in the U.S.-led coalition against the Islamic State and its armed forces are active in neighboring Syria and Iraq. It is also facing a renewed conflict with an outlawed Kurdish movement in the southeast.      Condemnations of the attack came from a range of Turkish politicians, sports leaders and clubs and U.S. and EU officials.      Turkey's pro-Kurdish People Democratic Party, or HDP, issued a statement \\"strongly condemning\\" the attacks and saying it \\"felt great sadness and shared in the sorrow.\\"      Turkish authorities, particularly the president, have routinely accused the party of being linked to the PKK and backing terrorism. The party, which had both of its leaders detained in terror probes and multiple elected officials arrested or removed from public service in the southeast, denies the charge.      The chair of the main opposition Republican People's Party also condemned the attack.      Ned Price, a spokesman for the White House National Security Council, said Washington condemned the attack in \\"the strongest terms.\\"      \\"We stand together with Turkey, our NATO Ally, against all terrorists,\\" Price said.      The Besiktas sports club \\"strongly condemned\\" the attack and said a store employee and a security official were among the fatalities. Bursaspor issued a statement wishing \\"a speedy recovery to our wounded citizens.\\"      Aleksander Ceferin, president of European soccer's governing body UEFA, and European Union Enlargement Commissioner Johannes Hahn also condemned the attack.      \\"Violence has no place in a democratic society,\\" Hahn wrote on Twitter.      The U.S. Consulate General in Istanbul urged its citizens to avoid the area in Istanbul.      Turkey's radio and television board issued a temporary coverage ban citing national security concerns. It said \\"to avoid broadcasts that can result in public fear, panic or chaos, or that will serve the aims of terrorist organizations.\\"      ___      Cinar Kiper and Bulut Emiroglu in Istanbul contributed. ||||| Turkey has vowed vengeance for the victims of twin blasts outside a football stadium in Istanbul that killed 38 people, as Kurdish militants claimed responsibility.      A day after the two bombs, which appeared to be a co-ordinated attack on police, an offshoot of the Kurdistan Workers Party (PKK) said it was responsible.      In a statement on its website, the group, called Kurdistan Freedom Hawks, or TAK, also said two of its militants were killed.      As some of the victims were laid to rest, Turkey vowed to make the perpetrators pay.      \\"Sooner or later, we will have our vengeance,\\" said interior minister Suleyman Soylu, speaking at a funeral service at Istanbul police headquarters.      \\"This blood will not be left on the ground, no matter what the price, what the cost.\\"      President Tayyip Erdogan called the attack on Saturday night \\"the ugly face of terror\\" and vowed to fight \\"the curse of terrorism till the end\\".      In the first explosion, a car bomb was blown up outside the Vodafone Arena, home to the club Besiktas, after a football match. Less than a minute later, a suicide bomber hit in an adjacent park.      Image Caption: A damaged vehicle after the blast on Saturday night      Thirteen people have been arrested as officials started pointing to Kurdish militants soon after the attack.      Most of the victims - 30 - were police officers, seven were civilians and one was yet to be identified, officials said.      More than 150 were injured, and 136 people remained in hospital, including 14 under intensive care.      Authorities have determined that about 300-400kg of explosives were used in the powerful blasts.      The number of civilians killed was lower than feared as fans had already left the stadium after the game when the blasts occurred.      The first explosion struck in an area where police special forces were located at the stadium exit. A riot police bus appears to have been the target, said Mr Soylu.      The suicide bomber triggered the explosive after being stopped by police in the nearby Macka Park.      Witnesses have described scenes of panic as the explosions rocked the area and shattered windows.      \\"It was like hell. The flames went all the way up to the sky,\\" said Omer Yilmaz, who works as a cleaner at the nearby Dolmabahce Mosque, directly across the road from the stadium.      \\"People ducked under the tables, women began crying. Football fans drinking tea at the cafe sought shelter, it was horrible.\\"      Video: Eyewitness: I heard two explosions in 30 seconds      Sunday was a day of national mourning, with flags flying at half-mast across the nation and officials calling for a march against terrorism.      Mr Erdogan, who cancelled a planned trip to Kazakhstan, described the blasts as a terrorist attack on police and civilians. He said the aim of the bombings, two hours after the end of a match attended by thousands of people, had been to cause maximum casualties.      \\"We have once again witnessed tonight in Istanbul the ugly face of terror, which tramples on every value and decency,\\" he said.      \\"Nobody should doubt that with God's will, we as a country and a nation will overcome terror, terrorist organisations.\\"      Video: Running for cover as blasts hit Istanbul      This year Istanbul has witnessed a spate of attacks attributed by authorities to the Islamic State group or claimed by Kurdish militants.

I have no problem with divorce since, as others have stated, everyone has their reasons, however there was one person that I dated briefly but upon hearing the reason why he divorced I opted to end the relationship. I remember, we were having brunch and were talking about our past relationships and what happened. He brought up his marriage. I had previously known his divorce but, up until this point, not the reasoning. He told me, straight out, that he had cheated. Now, cheating in itself is one thing. I try not to judge since everyone has a past and I was never always innocent myself, however his attitude about it was what was very off-putting to me. He didn’t seem remotely fazed by what he was telling me at all. There he was, spreading jelly on his toast as he told me about all the women he had cheated on his wife with. He told me about how it had started with a secretary (talk about cliches!) and then graduated to trysts in motels with girls off Tinder all with the same amount of casualness as someone describing how to make an omelette! And when he finally finished the tale of his cheating adventures I asked him if he regretted cheating on his wife with so many women, His answer? “Oh Definitely.” Oh good! So at least he regrets his actions, right? Or he’s at least a little sorry about it> Wrong. “One of the reasons I regret not divorcing her sooner. Had I divorced her sooner, I wouldn’t have to have cheated on her so much. But it is what it is and, well, I was unhappy.” I have no problems with divorced men.

Welded plastic doesn’t take long to cool down, but you can wait as long as you please. Look for the welded plastic to turn solid. If you don’t feel any heat coming off of it, you are ready to work on it.  The best time to fix a weld is before it cools. A good weld looks relatively smooth and consistent. Add more of the welding rod or smooth out the melted plastic with your gun as needed. Set your welding gun aside when you’re done. Remember to put it in a safe spot, such as in a heat-resistant holster, until it cools. Smooth out the rough ridges on the weld to make it look consistent with the rest of the plastic. Apply light pressure to the weld, rubbing the sandpaper back and forth across it. Try to get the weld to look level with the area around it, but be careful to avoid scratching the plastic around it. If you’re looking for a speedier way to do this, use a sanding wheel on a rotary tool. Be careful, though, since plastic is relatively soft and easy to scratch. Switch to finer grits of sandpaper to neaten out the weld. Higher-grit sandpaper is finer and less abrasive, but it can still scratch the plastic if you’re not careful. Rub the weld down like you did with the 120-grit sandpaper until it looks consistent and feels smooth to the touch. Always start with the lower-grit sandpaper. It is coarser, so it wears away more of the plastic. Save the higher-grit sandpaper for finishing.

Options: - close - closeness - proximity - near - measured in meters  The answer is \\"near\\" because Answer:","output":"The answer is \\"near\\" because the term \\"near\\" is the most appropriate and easily understood way of expressing that the oncoming cars appeared to be at a short distance from the driver. The driver, having forgotten his glasses, struggled with judging the distance accurately, causing him to perceive that the vehicles were closer than they actually were. Let's examine and compare the other options: 1. Close: While \\"close\\" is also a suitable term to describe the perceived or actual distance between the driver and the oncoming cars, \\"near\\" is a more common and straightforward choice. Both words have similar meanings, but \\"near\\" is a more concise and easily understood option for this situation. 2. Closeness: This term refers to the quality of being close, rather than the actual perceived distance between objects. It would not accurately convey the issue the driver was facing. 3. Proximity: Proximity describes the nearness in space, time, or relationship. However, in this context, the term \\"near\\" is more specific and clear, as it directly addresses the issue of the cars appearing to be at a short distance away from the driver. 4. Measured in meters: This option does not make sense in the context of the question because it does not describe a characteristic of the oncoming cars. It refers to a unit of measurement, rather than a quality of distance. In conclusion, the most appropriate answer is \\"near,\\" as it effectively and simply communicates the driver's difficulty in judging the distances of the oncoming cars due to his forgotten glasses. This term clearly conveys the fact that the driver perceived the vehicles to be at a short distance away, causing him not to pull out."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Continue writing the next sentence in this paragraph: How to make zucchini noodles  Decide whether or not to peel the zucchini.  If you want zucchini noodles that more closely resemble actual pasta, peel the zucchini before turning it into noodles. For something a little more colorful, though, keep the peel on.","output":"Next, choose a spiralizing tool or device that suits your needs and preference. There are several options available, such as a spiralizer, julienne peeler, mandoline slicer, or even a regular vegetable peeler. Each of these tools is designed to cut the zucchini into thin, noodle-like strips or ribbons. The choice of the tool will largely depend on the desired thickness and style of the zucchini noodles. For instance, a spiralizer creates long, curly noodles, while a julienne peeler produces evenly-sized, straight noodles. Once you've selected the appropriate tool, wash and dry the zucchini thoroughly, removing any dirt or debris. If using a spiralizer, secure the zucchini on the device and start turning the handle, applying constant pressure to produce consistent noodles. If using a julienne peeler, hold the zucchini firmly and carefully run the peeler along the length of the vegetable, removing thin ribbons each time. Mandoline slicers and regular vegetable peelers can also be used in a similar fashion, making sure to adjust the blade width to achieve the desired noodle thickness. As you create zucchini noodles, you may find that some pieces will be shorter and more irregular than others. This is normal and can be expected when using vegetables with varying shapes and sizes. To obtain a more uniform appearance, simply trim or discard any uneven or excess strips that don't match the desired size and shape. After you've turned the entire zucchini into noodles, it is essential to release any excess moisture from them. If not done properly, the noodles can end up soggy and unappetizing. To prevent this, place the noodles in a colander and sprinkle them with a pinch of salt. Allow them to sit for a few minutes, as the salt will draw the water out. Afterward, gently pat the noodles dry with a paper towel or clean dishcloth to remove any additional moisture. Now that your zucchini noodles are prepared, it's time to cook them. There are several methods of cooking zucchini noodles, such as sautéing, boiling, or even microwaving. To sauté, heat a small amount of oil in a large skillet over medium heat. Add the zucchini noodles, stirring frequently and cook for 2-3 minutes until they're slightly softened but still maintaining their shape. Avoid overcooking the noodles, as they can quickly turn mushy. Boiling the noodles is another option and only takes about 1-2 minutes. Be sure to drain them well after cooking to avoid any excess liquid. Microwaving zucchini noodles is also a quick and efficient way of cooking them. Simply place the noodles in a microwave-safe dish, cover with a microwave-safe lid or plastic wrap, and cook on high for 1-1.5 minutes. Once cooked, serve the zucchini noodles with your choice of sauce, such as marinara, pesto, or even a simple garlic and oil mixture. Top with your favorite protein source, like grilled chicken, tofu, or shrimp, and additional vegetables for a well-rounded and nutritious meal. Making zucchini noodles allows you to enjoy a low-carb, gluten-free, and healthier alternative to traditional pasta dishes, while also adding a colorful and fun twist to your culinary repertoire."},{"instruction":"You should describe the task and explain your answer.

Help as much as you can. Given the question: Information:  - An oxide is a chemical compound that contains at least one oxygen atom and one other element in its chemical formula. \\"Oxide\\" itself is the dianion of oxygen, an O atom. Metal oxides thus typically contain an anion of oxygen in the oxidation state of 2. Most of the Earth's crust consists of solid oxides, the result of elements being oxidized by the oxygen in air or in water. Hydrocarbon combustion affords the two principal carbon oxides: carbon monoxide and carbon dioxide. Even materials considered pure elements often develop an oxide coating. For example, aluminium foil develops a thin skin of AlO (called a passivation layer) that protects the foil from further corrosion. Individual elements can often form multiple oxides, each containing different amounts of the element and oxygen. In some cases these are distinguished by specifying the number of atoms as in carbon monoxide and carbon dioxide, and in other cases by specifying the element's oxidation number, as in iron(II) oxide and iron(III) oxide. Certain elements can form many different oxides, such those of nitrogen.  - Koskullskulle is a locality situated in Gällivare Municipality, Norrbotten County, Sweden with 874 inhabitants in 2010.  - Magnetite is a mineral and one of the main iron ores. With the chemical formula FeO, it is one of the oxides of iron. Magnetite is ferrimagnetic; it is attracted to a magnet and can be magnetized to become a permanent magnet itself. It is the most magnetic of all the naturally-occurring minerals on Earth. Naturally-magnetized pieces of magnetite, called lodestone, will attract small pieces of iron, which is how ancient peoples first discovered the property of magnetism. Today it is mined as iron ore.  - The polar night occurs when the night lasts for more than 24 hours. This occurs only inside the polar circles. The opposite phenomenon, the polar day, or midnight sun, occurs when the Sun stays above the horizon for more than 24 hours. \\"Night\\" is understood as the center of the Sun being below a free horizon. Since the atmosphere bends the rays of the Sun, the polar day is longer than the polar night, and the area that is affected by polar night is somewhat smaller than the area of midnight sun. The polar circle is located at a latitude between these two areas, at the latitude of approximately 66.5 degrees. In the most northern city of Sweden, Kiruna, at 67°51'N, the polar night lasts for around 28 twenty-four-hour periods, while the midnight sun lasts around 50 twenty-four-hour periods.  - Hematite, also spelled as haematite, is the mineral form of iron(III) oxide (FeO), one of several iron oxides. Hematite crystallizes in the rhombohedral lattice system, and it has the same crystal structure as ilmenite and corundum. Hematite and ilmenite form a complete solid solution at temperatures above .  - Sweden, officially the Kingdom of Sweden (Swedish: ), is a Scandinavian country in Northern Europe. It borders Norway to the west and Finland to the east, and is connected to Denmark in the southwest by a bridge-tunnel across the Öresund. At , Sweden is the third-largest country in the European Union by area, with a total population of 10.0 million. Sweden consequently has a low population density of , with the highest concentration in the southern half of the country. Approximately 85% of the population lives in urban areas.  - Luleå (Lule Sami \\"Luleju\\") is a city on the coast of northern Sweden, and the capital of Norrbotten County, the northernmost county in Sweden. Luleå has about 75,000 inhabitants and is the seat of Luleå Municipality (with a total population of 75,921).  - Iron ores are rocks and minerals from which metallic iron can be economically extracted. The ores are usually rich in iron oxides and vary in color from dark grey, bright yellow, or deep purple to rusty red. The iron itself is usually found in the form of magnetite (72.4% Fe), hematite (69.9% Fe), goethite (62.9% Fe), limonite or siderite (48.2% Fe).  - Luleå Municipality is a municipality in Norrbotten County in northern Sweden. Its seat is located in Luleå, which is also the county seat of Norrbotten County.  - Germany, officially the Federal Republic of Germany, is a federal parliamentary republic in central-western Europe. It includes 16 constituent states, covers an area of , and has a largely temperate seasonal climate. With about 82 million inhabitants, Germany is the most populous member state of the European Union. After the United States, it is the second most popular immigration destination in the world. Germany's capital and largest metropolis is Berlin. Other major cities include Hamburg, Munich, Cologne, Frankfurt, Stuttgart and Düsseldorf.  - The Main Line Through Upper Norrland is a long railway line between Bräcke, Jämtland County and Boden, Norrbotten County in Sweden. For military and regional policy reasons, it was built in very sparsely populated areas, far away from the more densely populated coast. The line has several branches to settlements on the coast, the ones to Umeå and Luleå being considered part of the line itself. Today the three largest settlements along the line are Boden (pop 18800), Älvsbyn (pop 5500) and Vännäs (pop 4100).  - Iore, often stylized IORE, is a class of 34 electric locomotives built by Adtranz and its successor Bombardier Transportation for the Swedish mining company LKAB's railway division Malmtrafik. The class is a variation of Adtranz's Octeon modular product platform, thus related to Bombardier's later TRAXX platform. The locomotives haul iron ore freight trains on the Iron Ore Line and Ofoten Line in Sweden and Norway, respectively. The 68-car trains are hauled by two single-ended CoCo locomotives, each with a power output of . Each operates with tractive effort and has a maximum speed of . Delivery of the first series of 18 locomotives was made from 2000 to 2004, and they replaced some of the aging Dm3 and El 15 units. In 2007, eight more vehicles (4 double units) were ordered, with production to be completed by 2011, by which time, another four double units were ordered. These units are scheduled to be delivered from 2013 to 2014.  - Iron is a chemical element with symbol Fe (from ) and atomic number 26. It is a metal in the first transition series. It is by mass the most common element on Earth, forming much of Earth's outer and inner core. It is the fourth most common element in the Earth's crust. Its abundance in rocky planets like Earth is due to its abundant production by fusion in high-mass stars, where it is the last element to be produced with release of energy before the violent collapse of a supernova, which scatters the iron into space.  - World War I (WWI or WW1), also known as the First World War, or the Great War, was a global war originating in Europe that lasted from 28 July 1914 to 11 November 1918. More than 70 million military personnel, including 60 million Europeans, were mobilised in one of the largest wars in history. Over nine million combatants and seven million civilians died as a result of the war (including the victims of a number of genocides), a casualty rate exacerbated by the belligerents' technological and industrial sophistication, and the tactical stalemate caused by gruelling trench warfare. It was one of the deadliest conflicts in history, and paved the way for major political changes, including revolutions in many of the nations involved.  - A mineral is a naturally occurring chemical compound, usually of crystalline form and abiogenic in origin. A mineral has one specific chemical composition, whereas a rock can be an aggregate of different minerals or mineraloids. The study of minerals is called mineralogy.  - Northern or North Sami (disapproved exonym Lappish or Lapp), sometimes also simply referred to as Sami, is the most widely spoken of all Sami languages. The area where Northern Sami is spoken covers the northern parts of Norway, Sweden and Finland. The number of Northern Sami speakers is estimated to be somewhere between 15,000 and 25,000. About 2,000 of these live in Finland and between 5,000 and 6,000 in Sweden.  - The Sami people (also Sámi or Saami, traditionally known in English as Lapps or Laplanders) are an indigenous Finno-Ugric people inhabiting the Arctic area of Sápmi, which today encompasses parts of far northern Norway, Sweden, Finland, and the Kola Peninsula of Russia. The Sami are the only indigenous people of Scandinavia recognized and protected under the international conventions of indigenous peoples, and are hence the northernmost indigenous people of Europe. Sami ancestral lands are not well-defined. Their traditional languages are the Sami languages and are classified as a branch of the Uralic language family.  - Luossavaara-Kiirunavaara Aktiebolag (LKAB) is a Swedish mining company. The company mines iron ore at Kiruna and at Malmberget in northern Sweden. The company was established in 1890, and has been 100% state-owned since the 1950s. The iron ore is processed to pellets and sinter fines, which are transported by Iore trains (Malmbanan) to the harbours at Narvik and Luleå and to the steelmill at Luleå (SSAB).   - Svappavaara is a locality situated in Kiruna Municipality, Norrbotten County, Sweden with 417 inhabitants in 2010. It is a mining village. Mining was started around 1650. Large scale iron mining started in 1965. The mine was closed in 1983, but enrichment of iron ore from the mine at Kiruna is still going on. The mine is owned by LKAB, and there is an ongoing project to open it again for production around year 2015.  - Narvik is located on the shores of the Ofotfjorden. The municipality is part of the traditional district of Ofoten of Northern Norway, inside the Arctic Circle. The municipality of Narvik borders the municipality of Ballangen to the southwest, Evenes to the northwest, Bardu, Gratangen, Lavangen and Skånland (in Troms county) to the north, and Norrbotten County (Lapland) in Sweden to the south and east.  - Limonite is an iron ore consisting of a mixture of hydrated iron(III) oxide-hydroxides in varying composition. The generic formula is frequently written as FeO(OH)·nHO, although this is not entirely accurate as the ratio of oxide to hydroxide can vary quite widely. Limonite is one of the two principal iron ores, the other being hematite, and has been mined for the production of iron since at least 2500 BCE.  - The European Union (EU) is a political and economic union of member states that are located primarily in Europe. It has an area of , and an estimated population of over 510 million. The EU has developed an internal single market through a standardised system of laws that apply in all member states. EU policies aim to ensure the free movement of people, goods, services, and capital within the internal market, enact legislation in justice and home affairs, and maintain common policies on trade, agriculture, fisheries, and regional development. Within the Schengen Area, passport controls have been abolished. A monetary union was established in 1999 and came into full force in 2002, and is composed of 19 EU member states which use the euro currency.  - Goethite (FeO(OH)), named after the German polymath and poet Johann Wolfgang von Goethe (17491832), an iron bearing hydroxide mineral of the diaspore group, is found in soil and other low-temperature environments. Goethite has been well known since ancient times for its use as a pigment (brown ochre). Evidence has been found of its use in paint pigment samples taken from the caves of Lascaux in France. It was first described in 1806 based on samples found in the Hollertszug Mine in Herdorf, Germany.  - World War II (often abbreviated to WWII or WW2), also known as the Second World War, was a global war that lasted from 1939 to 1945, although related conflicts began earlier. It involved the vast majority of the world's nationsincluding all of the great powerseventually forming two opposing military alliances: the Allies and the Axis. It was the most widespread war in history, and directly involved more than 100 million people from over 30 countries. In a state of \\"total war\\", the major participants threw their entire economic, industrial, and scientific capabilities behind the war effort, erasing the distinction between civilian and military resources. Marked by mass deaths of civilians, including the Holocaust (in which approximately 11 million people were killed) and the strategic bombing of industrial and population centres (in which approximately one million were killed, and which included the atomic bombings of Hiroshima and Nagasaki), it resulted in an estimated 50 million to 85 million fatalities. These made World War II the deadliest conflict in human history.  - Kiirunavaara ( Northern Sami : Gironvárri or Kierunavaara ) is a mountain in Kiruna , Sweden that contains one of the largest and richest bodies of iron ore in the world . The presence of iron in the area was known already in the mid- 17th century , but at this early time communication lines to this northerly region were quite insufficient to permit any major exploitation . Only with the construction of a railway , the Iron Ore Line and the ports of Narvik and Luleå at the end of the 19th century did commercial mining become a realistic proposition . The Swedish mining company LKAB ( Luossavaara - Kiirunavaara Aktiebolag ) has been mining the mountain since the beginning of the 20th century . The mining area around Kiruna and Malmberget and the iron port and steelworks at Luleå made Norrbotten County one of the first , and most prominent , regions of heavy industry in Sweden , and the wider region has remained at the forefront of mining and steel smelting and alloying technology .  - Denmark is a Scandinavian country in Europe. The southernmost and smallest of the Nordic countries, it is south-west of Sweden and south of Norway, and bordered to the south by Germany. The Kingdom of Denmark is the sovereign state that comprises Denmark proper and two autonomous constituent countries in the North Atlantic Ocean: the Faroe Islands and Greenland. Denmark has a total area of , and a population of 5.7 million. The country consists of a peninsula, Jutland, and an archipelago of 443 named islands, with the largest being Zealand and Funen. The islands are characterised by flat, arable land and sandy coasts, low elevation and a temperate climate.  - SSAB AB, earlier \\"Svenskt Stål AB\\" (English: Swedish Steel), is a Swedish-Finnish company, formed in 1978 and specialised in processing raw material to steel. The largest shareholders are Industrivärden and the Government of Finland.  - An ore is a type of rock that contains sufficient minerals with important elements including metals that can be economically extracted from the rock. The ores are extracted from the earth through mining; they are then refined (often via smelting) to extract the valuable element, or elements.  - A metal (from Greek  \\"métallon\\", \\"mine, quarry, metal\\") is a material (an element, compound, or alloy) that is typically hard, opaque, shiny, and has good electrical and thermal conductivity. Metals are generally malleable  that is, they can be hammered or pressed permanently out of shape without breaking or cracking  as well as fusible (able to be fused or melted) and ductile (able to be drawn out into a thin wire). About 91 of the 118 elements in the periodic table are metals, the others are nonmetals or metalloids. Some elements appear in both metallic and non-metallic forms.  - Luossavaara (Northern Sami: \\"Luossavárri\\") is a mountain in Kiruna, Sweden. It is the site of a now-inactive iron ore mine formerly operated by the Swedish mining company LKAB. Today it has a ski lift and slope, as well as a hiking path called \\"Midnattsolstigen\\" (the Midnight Sun Trail).  - Iron oxides are chemical compounds composed of iron and oxygen. All together, there are sixteen known iron oxides and oxyhydroxides.  - Finland , officially the Republic of Finland, is a sovereign state in Northern Europe. A peninsula with the Gulf of Finland to the south and the Gulf of Bothnia to the west, the country has land borders with Sweden to the northwest, Norway to the north, and Russia to the east. Estonia is south of the country across the Gulf of Finland. Finland is a Nordic country situated in the geographical region of Fennoscandia, which also includes Scandinavia. Finland's population is 5.5 million (2014), staying roughly on the same level over the past two decades. The majority of the population is concentrated in the southern region. In terms of area, it is the eighth largest country in Europe and the most sparsely populated country in the European Union.  - The Ofoten Line is a railway line in Narvik, Norway. It runs from the Port of Narvik to Riksgränsen on the NorwaySweden border, where the line continues as the Ore Line via Kiruna and Gällivare to Luleå. The Ofoten Line is single track, electrified at and has seven stations. The line only connects to the rest of the Norwegian railway network via Sweden. The main traffic is up to twelve daily freight trains operated by Malmtrafik that haul iron ore from Sweden to Narvik. In addition, CargoNet operates container trains, branded as the Arctic Rail Express (ARE), and SJ operates passenger trains, including a night train to Stockholm. The Ofoten Line is also part of the Northern East West Freight Corridor, which hauls containers from China and India to North America.  - Scandinavia is a historical and cultural region in Northern Europe characterized by a common ethnocultural North Germanic heritage and mutually intelligible North Germanic languages.  - The city's vicinity shares a long history with the indigenous Sami people, with evidence of at least 6000 years of settlement. The city of Kiruna was founded in 1900 and quickly became a major centre of iron ore extraction and mining industry. During World War II, large quantities of iron were transported from Kiruna by rail to the east coast, and further down to be sold to Germany. Due to Kiruna's position north of the Arctic Circle the city experiences both midnight sun and polar night throughout the year as well as a very cold climate, even by Scandinavian standards.  - Siderite is a mineral composed of iron(II) carbonate (FeCO). It takes its name from the Greek word  \\"sideros,\\" iron. It is a valuable iron mineral, since it is 48% iron and contains no sulfur or phosphorus. Zinc, magnesium and manganese commonly substitute for the iron resulting in the siderite-smithsonite, siderite-magnesite and siderite-rhodochrosite solid solution series.  - Norway (; Norwegian: (Bokmål) or (Nynorsk); Sami: \\"Norgga\\"), officially the Kingdom of Norway, is a sovereign and unitary monarchy whose territory comprises the western portion of the Scandinavian Peninsula plus the island Jan Mayen and the archipelago of Svalbard. The Antarctic Peter I Island and the sub-Antarctic Bouvet Island are dependent territories and thus not considered part of the Kingdom. Norway also lays claim to a section of Antarctica known as Queen Maud Land. Until 1814, the Kingdom included the Faroe Islands (since 1035), Greenland (1261), and Iceland (1262). It also included Shetland and Orkney until 1468. It also included the following provinces, now in Sweden: Jämtland, Härjedalen and Bohuslän.  - Northern Europe is the northern part or region of Europe. Although no definitive borders or definition exists for the term, geographically, Northern Europe may be considered to consist approximately of all of Europe above the 52nd parallel north; which includes (from west to east) most or all of: Iceland, the Republic of Ireland, the Isle of Man, the United Kingdom, the Faroe Islands, the Netherlands, northern Germany, Denmark, Norway, Sweden, northern Poland, Finland, Estonia, Latvia, Lithuania and northwest Russia. However, narrower definitions may also be used based on other geographical factors, such as climate and ecology. Greenland, geographically a part of North America, is politically a part of the Kingdom of Denmark, and may be included depending on the definition.  - Sami is a group of Uralic languages spoken by the Sami people in Northern Europe (in parts of northern Finland, Norway, Sweden and extreme northwestern Russia). There are, depending on the nature and terms of division, ten or more Sami languages. Several names are used for the Sami languages: \\"Saami\\", \\"Sámi\\", \\"Saame\\", \\"Samic\\", \\"kukhulas\\", as well as the exonyms \\"Lappish\\" and \\"Lappic\\". The last two, along with the term \\"Lapp\\", are now often considered derogatory.  - Gällivare (or ) is a locality and the seat of Gällivare Municipality in Norrbotten County, province of Lapland, Sweden with 8,449 inhabitants in 2010. The town was founded in the 17th century. Together with nearby towns Malmberget and Koskullskulle it forms a conurbation with some 15,000 inhabitants. This conurbation is the second northernmost significant urban area of Sweden after Kiruna.  - The midnight sun is a natural phenomenon that occurs in the summer months in places north of the Arctic Circle or south of the Antarctic Circle, when the sun remains visible at the local midnight. Around the summer solstice (approximately 21 June in the Northern Hemisphere and 22 December in the Southern Hemisphere) the sun is visible for the full 24 hours, given fair weather. The number of days per year with potential midnight sun increases the farther towards either pole one goes. Although approximately defined by the polar circles, in practice the midnight sun can be seen as much as 55 miles (90 km) outside the polar circle, as described below, and the exact latitudes of the farthest reaches of midnight sun depend on topography and vary slightly year-to-year.  - Malmberget (\\"The Ore Mountain\\") is a locality and mining town situated in Gällivare Municipality, Norrbotten County, Sweden with 5,590 inhabitants in 2010. It is situated 5 kilometres from the municipal seat Gällivare.  - The Iron Ore Line is a long railway line between Riksgränsen and Boden in Norrbotten County, Sweden. The line contains two branches, from Kiruna to Svappavaara and from Gällivare to Koskullskulle. The term is often colloquially used to also include the Ofoten Line, from Riksgränsen to Narvik in Norway, and the northernmost part of the Main Line Through Upper Norrland from Boden to Luleå. The railway from Narvik to Luleå is long.  - Norrbotten County (\\"Norrbottens län\\") is the northernmost county or \\"län\\" of Sweden. It borders Västerbotten County to the southwest, the Gulf of Bothnia to the southeast. It also borders the counties of Nordland and Troms in Norway to the northwest, and Lapland Province in Finland to the northeast.   - Aktiebolag (\\"stock company\\") is the Swedish term for \\"limited company\\" or \\"corporation\\". When used in company names, it is abbreviated AB (in Sweden), Ab (in Finland), or A/B (for some older companies), roughly equivalent to the abbreviations \\"Ltd\\" and \\"PLC\\". The State authority responsible for registration of aktiebolag in Sweden is called the Swedish Companies Registration Office.  - Riksgränsen, \\"The National Border\\" in Swedish, is a ski-resort in Kiruna Municipality, Lappland, Sweden, 200 km north of the Arctic Circle.

He won't be able to sell all of his cupcakes within the next week, so he has decided to store a portion of them in the freezer to preserve them for later. He is trying to decide if he should store the cupcakes at 0° F or at 10° F in the freezer.  and a hint : Freezing is a common method of food preservation that slows both food decay and the growth of micro-organisms. Besides the effect of lower temperatures on reaction rates, freezing makes water less available for bacterial growth.  Please answer this question : At which temperature will more water be available on the cupcakes for bacterial growth? A:","output":"At 10° F, more water will be available on the cupcakes for bacterial growth compared to 0° F. This is because, at a higher temperature (10° F), the freezing process is less efficient, which means that the water content in the cupcakes does not freeze as completely or as quickly as it would at a lower temperature (0° F). This results in more water being available for bacterial growth at 10° F as opposed to 0° F. For optimal preservation and reduction of bacterial growth, it is better to store the cupcakes at 0° F in the freezer."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant. User will you give you a task.

Summarize this article: Labour is celebrating victories by Anna McMorrin in Cardiff North, Tonia Antoniazzi in Gower and the return of Chris Ruane in Vale of Clwyd. Plaid Cymru's Ben Lake has become Wales' youngest current MP, aged 24, after winning Ceredigion from the Liberal Democrats. Here are Wales' new political faces of 2017 by constituency. Labour's Anna McMorrin is the new MP for this swing seat, winning a 4,174 majority and ousting Conservative Craig Williams. She grew up near Brecon, went to university in Cardiff and lives in the city with her partner and two teenage daughters. Previously a Welsh Government adviser and a public policy consultant before the election, she describes herself as a campaigner and mum. Plaid Cymru's Ben Lake is Wales' youngest MP after taking Ceredigion from the Liberal Democrats, depriving them of their only Welsh seat. Aged 24, he was working for Plaid in the Welsh Assembly before hitting the campaign trail and is one of the youngest politicians ever elected to the House of Commons. Tonia Antoniazzi won Gower from the Conservatives for Labour, turning a Tory majority of 27 into a 3,269 majority for her party. A Llanelli schoolteacher who used to represent Wales at rugby, she says she is also a mum and a linguist. While on the campaign trail she told BBC Wales two things she could transfer from the rugby pitch to the battle for the most marginal seat in Britain were stamina and teamwork. Labour's Chris Ruane won the Vale of Clwyd back from the Conservatives, a seat he had held for 18 years before losing it in 2015. He says practising the meditation technique known as mindfulness helped him cope with suddenly losing his job in 2015, and he travelled to Canberra to share the mindfulness message with Australian MPs.

Q: Answer the following question given this paragraph:   One way of classifying organisms that shows phylogeny is by using the clade. A clade is a group of organisms that includes an ancestor and all of its descendants. Clades are based on cladistics. This is a method of comparing traits in related species to determine ancestor-descendant relationships. Clades are represented by cladograms, like the one in Figure below . This cladogram represents the mammal and reptile clades. The reptile clade includes birds. It shows that birds evolved from reptiles. Linnaeus classified mammals, reptiles, and birds in separate classes. This masks their evolutionary relationships.   Q: What is one way of classifying organisms called?   A: A:","output":"One way of classifying organisms is called \\"clade\\". The term \\"clade\\" refers to a group of organisms that comprises an ancestor and all of its descendants. The classification system using clades is founded on cladistics, a method that facilitates the comparison of traits in related species to decipher ancestor-descendant relationships. Clades are visually represented by cladograms. For instance, the cladogram mentioned in the paragraph represents the mammal and reptile clades, underscoring their evolutionary relationships. The system also reveals that the reptile clade embodies birds, indicating that birds evolved from reptiles. It's worth noting that this clade approach to classifying organisms is quite different from the Linnaeus method, which classified mammals, reptiles, and birds into separate classes, thereby obscuring their evolutionary relationships. Consequently, clade-based classification provides a deeper and more accurate understanding of the connection and progression between various organisms."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

The mountain ranges block the moist Pacific air, holding moisture in the western valleys, and creating rain shadows to the east. Heron, in the west, receives the most precipitation, 34.70 inches (881 mm). On the eastern (leeward) side of a mountain range, the valleys are much drier; Lonepine averages 11.45 inches (291 mm), and Deer Lodge 11.00 inches (279 mm) of precipitation. The mountains themselves can receive over 100 inches (2,500 mm), for example the Grinnell Glacier in Glacier National Park gets 105 inches (2,700 mm). An area southwest of Belfry averaged only 6.59 inches (167 mm) over a sixteen-year period. Most of the larger cities get 30 to 50 inches or 0.76 to 1.27 metres of snow each year. Mountain ranges themselves can accumulate 300 inches or 7.62 metres of snow during a winter. Heavy snowstorms may occur any time from September through May, though most snow falls from November to March. If it is possible to answer this question, answer it for me (else, reply \\"unanswerable\\"): What is the annual precipitation?","output":"The question regarding annual precipitation appears to be in reference to a specific region which is not specified in the task description. However, the text includes a diverse range of precipitation averages which suggest a region with varied topography and climate, likely a state or region within a larger country.  For such a varied region, it's important to note that \\"average annual precipitation\\" can differ significantly based on the particular location within the region. Different factors such as geographical features, elevation, wind patterns and proximity to bodies of water can all impact the annual precipitation a specific place receives. Here are some examples of annual precipitation mentioned in the text:  1. The average annual precipitation for the wider region seems to be approximately 15 inches (380 mm).     2. Heron, on the western side, seems to receive the highest precipitation at 34.70 inches (881 mm) annually, due to moist Pacific air being trapped by the mountain ranges. 3. Comparatively, on the eastern (leeward) side, areas such as Lonepine and Deer Lodge receive less annual precipitation, averaging 11.45 inches (291 mm) and 11.00 inches (279 mm) respectively. This is due to them being in the rain shadow of the mountain ranges which blocks the moist Pacific air. 4. Areas of significant elevation, like the Grinnell Glacier in Glacier National Park, can receive over 100 inches (2,500 mm) - for instance, it gets 105 inches (2,700 mm) annually. 5. One area southwest of Belfry, received even less, averaging 6.59 inches (167 mm) over a period of 16 years. 6. The larger cities within this region generally receive between 30 to 50 inches or 0.76 to 1.27 metres of snow each year, which is also a form of precipitation. 7. Meanwhile, mountain ranges can accumulate massive amounts of snow, up to 300 inches or 7.62 meters during the winter season. In summary, the \\"annual precipitation\\" of this region can greatly vary from as little as 6.59 inches (167 mm) in certain locales, up to as high as 105 inches (2,700 mm) in elevated areas like the Grinnell Glacier in Glacier National Park.

Answer the following question: The Marches were a happy family. Poverty, hard work, and even the fact that Father March was away with the Union armies could not down the spirits of Meg, Jo, Amy, and Marmee, as the March girls called their mother. The March sisters tried to be good but had their share of faults. Pretty Meg was often displeased with the schoolchildren she taught; boyish Jo was easy to become angry; golden-haired schoolgirl Amy liked to show up; but Beth, who kept the house, was loving and gentle always. The happy days passed and darkness came when a telegram arrived for Mrs. March. \\"Your husband is very ill,\\" it said, \\"come at once.\\" The girl tried to be brave when their mother left for the front. They waited and prayed. Little Beth got scarlet fever   when she was taking care of the sick neighbor. She became very ill but began to recover by the time Marmee was back. When Father came home from the front and at that joyful Christmas dinner they were once more all together. Three years later the March girls had grown into young womanhood. Meg became Mrs. Brooke, and after a few family troubles got used to her new state happily. Jo had found pleasure in her literary efforts. Amy had grown into a young lady with a talent for design and an even greater one for society. But Beth had never fully regained her health, and her family watched her with love and anxiety. Amy was asked to go and stay in Europe with a relative of the Marches. Jo went to New York and became successful in her writing and had the satisfaction of seeing her work published there. But at home the bitterest blow was yet to fall. Beth had known for some time that she couldn't live much longer to be with the family and in the spring time she died. News came from Europe that Amy and Laurie, the grandson of a wealthy neighbor, had planned to be married soon. Now Jo became ever more successful in her writing and got married to Professor Bhaer and soon afterwards founded a school for boys. And so the little women had grown up and lived happily with their children,... It can be inferred from the passage that the March family had   _  . A) both happiness and sadness B) wealthy neighbors C) more girls than boys D) a lot of rich relatives Answer:","output":"A) both happiness and sadness As we go through the passage, we can see that the March family experienced various ups and downs in their lives. From dealing with poverty and their father being away at war, to the challenges each sister faced in their personal lives, and later dealing with illness and death. However, through it all, they managed to find happiness in their achievements, relationships, and eventual growth into young women. Therefore, the best inference we can make from the passage is that the March family had both happiness and sadness in their lives."},{"instruction":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

A gunman in an Afghan National Army uniform and another man shot dead two NATO soldiers at a combat outpost in southern Afghanistan Thursday, authorities said. The dead soldiers were Americans, according to Niaz Mohammad Sarhadi, the district chief in Kandahar province, where the shooting happened. The NATO-led International Security Assistance Force, however, did not immediately specify the service members' nationalities. Thursday's shooting was the third at a base or government building since news emerged that U.S. troops mistakenly burned Qurans and other religious materials early last week -- an incident that has sparked outrage, protests, and violence across Afghanistan. All three shootings were carried out by men in official clothing. Four Americans were killed in the earlier attacks. If the troops killed Thursday are indeed American, that would bring the death toll from the three attacks to six. A top U.S. lawmaker last month cited at least 42 attacks by Afghan security forces on their international allies in the past five years. Rep. Buck McKeon, who chairs the Armed Services Committee, said 39 of the attacks were by members of the Afghan National Security Force and three were by contractors. \\"Though less than 1% of Afghan forces and security guards have attacked coalition forces, this is 42 attacks too many and the new process must do better,\\" he said at a congressional hearing. Most attackers were acting on their own, rather than being puppets of insurgent groups, defense officials testified. France suspended its operations in Afghanistan after four French soldiers were killed by Afghan counterparts in eastern Kapisa province in January. That shooting came after another Afghan soldier killed two French soldiers in December. \\"The French army is not in Afghanistan to be shot at by Afghan soldiers,\\" French President Nicolas Sarkozy said after the shootings. Coalition forces responding to Thursday's incident killed the two gunmen, said Capt. Justin Brockhoff, an ISAF spokesman. Sarhadi said one gunman was an Afghan National Army soldier and the other, dressed in civilian clothes, was a teacher who formerly ran literacy courses for Afghan army soldiers. Afghan civilians are sometimes used to teach Afghan soldiers English to improve their ability to work alongside ISAF. It appeared that the teacher had been planning the attack for at least a year, Sarhadi said, because officials found pictures and other documents related to the Taliban among his possessions. U.S. officials have called the Quran burning an error by troops who were inadvertently given the Qurans and other religious materials to dispose of because they were thought to contain extremist inscriptions. U.S. President Barack Obama has apologized for the burning. Still, gunmen have targeted U.S. troops in the days following the burning. A man wearing an Afghan National Army uniform killed two American soldiers at a base in eastern Nangarhar province early last week. Over the weekend, two senior U.S. officers were gunned down inside the heavily secure Afghan Interior Ministry when a junior intelligence officer turned his gun on them. The gunman, who had been fired by the ministry but recently rejoined as a driver, is still on the loose. The incident prompted the United States to pull military advisers and embedded civilians from Afghan ministries, and France announced it was temporarily withdrawing all of its public officials in Afghan institutions to ensure their safety. The unrest following the Quran burning has left at least 41 people dead, including the two deaths Thursday, and hundreds more wounded. At least nine people were killed and 12 wounded in an explosion Monday near the front gate of the ISAF base at Jalalabad airport in eastern Afghanistan. There were no NATO casualties in the bombing. The Taliban insurgency said the attack was in retaliation for the Quran burning. In northern Kunduz province over the weekend, protesters attacked a police chief's office and a U.S. military base, Afghan and U.S. authorities said. Some threw hand grenades at the base, known as Combat Outpost Fortitude, and the resulting blasts wounded seven U.S. personnel believed to be Special Forces members, they said. Demonstrations outside the United Nations office in Kunduz on Saturday left four civilians dead and prompted the U.N. mission there to say Monday that it is temporarily relocating its international staff. U.S. Secretary of State Hillary Clinton said Sunday the unrest and targeting of Americans has gotten \\"out of hand\\" and needs to stop. The Obama administration feels the Afghans have not done enough to stem the violence, according to a senior U.S. official who has access to the latest intelligence and is involved in administration discussions, but declined to be identified because of the sensitive nature of the situation. \\"We are not going to settle for what has happened to our troops in recent days,\\" the official said. The U.S. ambassador to Afghanistan, Ryan Crocker, maintained Sunday that the Afghan security forces have given their lives to control the demonstrations and protect U.S. installations. Crocker said the Afghans \\"are very much in this fight trying to protect us.\\" After the Interior Ministry shooting, Lt. Col. Jimmie Cummings, an ISAF spokesman, said the United States would not let the incident divide the coalition.

The sell-by date may also appear as \\"not to be sold after\\" or \\"EXP.\\" This date is, at most, 30 days from the day the eggs were packaged. Eggs that are kept refrigerated and are not broken should be good for at least 1 month beyond the sell-by date.  The sell-by date appears as month/day in the United States. So eggs that must be sold by March 15th are labeled 03/15. \\"Sell-by\\" refers to the last date the eggs should be available for the public to purchase. Eggs should be pulled from the shelf after this date. It does not mean the eggs are bad or rotten after this date. The best-by date may also be labeled as \\"use by,\\" \\"use before,\\" or \\"best before.\\" The best-by label must be within 45 days of the date the eggs were packaged. Try to use these eggs within two weeks after the best-by date. \\"Best-by\\" refers to the period of time eggs are at their peak freshness, with the best texture, flavor, and binding and thickening properties. It does not mean the eggs are bad or rotten after this date. Sell-by or best-by dates are not required by federal law (some states require them, other states forbid them), but all eggs must be labeled with the date they were packaged. This date usually appears as a 3 digit code using the Julian date calendar. This means eggs packaged on January 1st would be labeled 001, eggs packaged on October 15th would be labeled 288, December 31st 365.  Look for the Julian date on the end of the carton. You'll see the plant code (a letter P followed by numbers) indicated where the eggs were packaged, and beside it you should find the Julian code.  The European Union also requires that eggs are marked with a pack date. Even if eggs are sold loose and not in a marked carton, the consumer should have access to that information. Once an egg has cooled in your refrigerator, it is important to keep it at the same temperature. A cool egg in a warmer environment begins to sweat, which can encourage bacteria to grow on the outside of the egg. Because the egg shell is porous, it is sometimes possible for the bacteria on the shell to pass into through and contaminate the egg.  To prevent temperature fluctuations, store your eggs in the coldest part of your refrigerator, not on the door. The temperature is more likely to fluctuate on the door when it is opening and closing, which may cause your eggs to sweat. If you receive your eggs unwashed and at room temperature, they do not need to be refrigerated. Many countries, including most European countries, keep their eggs at room temperature. This is safe because eggs are laid with a protective \\"bloom\\" which naturally keeps bacteria out. Once the eggs are washed, however, they must be refrigerated. Also, in most European countries, the hens have been inoculated against Salmonella prior to laying their eggs. If you have egg-laying hens and you're wondering when they will go bad, you can refer to your country's guidelines for freshness. It's a safe bet your eggs will be good for at least two months, if not more. If you're not sure how long you've had your fresh eggs or if you think they are older than two months, learn the signs of bad and old eggs to help you decide whether or not you should use them in your cooking.

Read this and answer the question The Romans are known for the great number of deities they honored, a capacity that earned the mockery of early Christian polemicists. The presence of Greeks on the Italian peninsula from the beginning of the historical period influenced Roman culture, introducing some religious practices that became as fundamental as the cult of Apollo. The Romans looked for common ground between their major gods and those of the Greeks (interpretatio graeca), adapting Greek myths and iconography for Latin literature and Roman art. Etruscan religion was also a major influence, particularly on the practice of augury.

Write highlights for this article: A city official in the remote Brazilian Amazon village of Envira told CNN that five members of the Kulina tribe are on the run after being accused of murdering, butchering and eating a farmer in a ritual act of cannibalism. The village's chief of staff, Maronilton da Silva Clementino, said Kulina tribesmen took the life of Ocelio Alves de Carvalho, 19, last week on the outskirts of Envira, which is in the far western part of Brazil that bumps up against Peru. Portal Amazonia newspaper reported that the Indians escaped after being held for a few hours in the city's police station. No arrest warrants were issued. Brazilian law does not allow the military or civil police to enter Indian lands, Portal Amazonia reported. It is still unknown how many people took part in the alleged cannibalistic ritual, although several Indians have fled into the jungle fearing prosecution, the newspaper Diario do Amazonas reported. Clementino said the victim was herding cattle when he met with a group of Indians who invited him back to their village. \\"They knew each other and they sometimes helped one another. They invited him to their reservation three days ago and he was never seen again,\\" Clementino said. \\"The family decided to go into the reservation and that's when they saw his body quartered and his skull hanging on a tree. It was very tragic for the family,\\" he said. The news of the incident came from the Indians themselves, who apparently bragged about eating the man's organs, Clementino said. Members of the tribe told residents of Envira -- where 190 Kulina families brush shoulders with non-tribal Brazilians -- that they held a cannibalistic ritual in which they cooked the victim's organs, Clementino said. He said Kulina Indians began surrounding the police station where the suspects were briefly interrogated. Villagers told authorities they are incensed by the lack of response from FUNAI, Brazil's National Indian Foundation. \\"The family is very frustrated with the law here, which protects the Indians and doesn't help protect us,\\" he said. \\"They start drinking and local farmers here are afraid who could be next.\\" Clementino said groups Indians -- often outnumbering police -- pose a security threat to locals. He said the man's family are upset that authorities did not arrive until three days later. But a FUNAI official told the newspaper Voz do Acre that access to Envira is very difficult, requiring long boat or helicopter rides. According to FUNAI, about 2,500 Kulina live in Brazil's Acre state, which borders with Peru, where 450 Kulina live. This remote jungle corridor is known for its isolated tribes. The Kulina are classified as an \\"isolated\\" tribe but some have contact with the non-indian population. The Kulina are also known for their complex language. FUNAI studies show that Kulina women speak a completely different language from the men. According to FUNAI, there are 460,000 Indians in Brazil and 1,300 indian languages. There are 55 groups considered to live in isolation. Highlights:","output":"1. Five members of the Kulina tribe in the Brazilian Amazon are accused of a ritual act of cannibalism. 2. The victim, a 19-year-old farmer, was killed, butchered, and eaten. 3. Police can't go into Indian lands, so no arrests have been made. 4.

He noticed that human societies had changed dramatically after the invention of agriculture.  But I can use this background: Human beings invented agriculture about 10,000 years ago. This provided a bigger, more dependable food supply. It also allowed people to settle down in villages and cities for the first time. Birth rates went up because there was more food and settled life had other advantages. Death rates also rose because of crowded living conditions and diseases that spread from domestic animals. Because the higher birth rates were matched by higher death rates, the human population continued to grow very slowly.  What is an answer for this question: Did era A have higher or lower death rate than era B? Answer:","output":"Era B had a higher death rate than era A. After the invention of agriculture, human societies experienced a shift in their way of living. The increased and more reliable food supply contributed to higher birth rates, as there were more resources to support larger families. However, this also led to the development of settled life in villages and cities, causing crowded living conditions. These conditions facilitated the spread of diseases and the higher concentration of people led to increased exposure to illnesses from domestic animals. As a result, the death rate in era B was higher than in era A, where humans lived in smaller groups as hunter-gatherers with fewer opportunities for disease transmission."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant that follows instruction extremely well.

What is the missing first step of the following process:  -  Animals gain weight - The season changes to one with bad (cold, snowy) weather - Animals find a place to hibernate - Animals enter a type of &#x27;sleep&#x27; (hibernation) - Body processes slow down - The animal&#x27;s heart rate and breathing rate slow - The animal loses weight more slowly than usual - The animal is able to survive not eating or drinking without hurting itself - Answer:","output":"The missing first step of the following process is: - Animals anticipate and sense the upcoming change in season and environment. This essential first step sets the stage for the entire hibernation process, as animals must be aware of and prepared for the upcoming harsh weather conditions in order to survive through them. Instinctively, animals recognize the signs of the changing seasons, such as dwindling food supplies, shorter days, and dropping temperatures. As animals notice these cues, they make the necessary adjustments to their behavior and lifestyle, thus initiating the process that leads to hibernation. The anticipation of the seasonal change triggers a series of events within the animal's body. Hormonal and metabolic changes take place, driving the animal to engage in specific behaviors to prepare for the upcoming period of hibernation. These behaviors include: 1. Searching and consuming larger amounts of food to acquire and store energy reserves, primarily in the form of fat, which will sustain the animal during its hibernation. This process is what eventually causes the animal to gain weight. 2. The seasonal change to colder, harsher weather conditions serves as a signal for animals to find a suitable location to hibernate. This could be a cave, a burrow, or a hollow tree, depending on the species. The selected location typically provides safety from predators and insulation from the extreme temperatures outside. 3. As the animal settles into the hibernation site, it begins to enter a state of deep sleep, or torpor. During this time, the animal's metabolic processes slow down dramatically. The heart rate, breathing rate, and body temperature also decrease significantly. 4. While in hibernation, the animal starts drawing upon its fat reserves to maintain its reduced energy needs. Due to the slowed metabolic processes, the animal loses weight more gradually than it would during periods of normal activity. 5. The ability to survive long periods without eating or drinking is another adaptation that allows animals to endure the harsh conditions of winter without causing significant harm to themselves. This unique ability enables animals to conserve the resources they have stored in their bodies and emerge from hibernation healthy and ready for activity once the more favorable conditions of spring arrive."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Most people tend to use irons to remove creases from their clothing and bed linen. But one enterprising artist chose to mimic his artistic heroes by doing quite the opposite - using his trusty domestic tool to purposefully crease a white sheet. The technique helped the artist create replicas of masterpieces by classic Dutch painters van Gogh, Rembrandt and Vermeer. Scroll down for video. Spot the difference: Vermeer's classic Girl With a Pearl Earring, right, reworked by an artist using only an iron and a white sheet, left. Van Gogh: The artist's Self-Portrait with Bandaged Ear and Pipe, right, and the artist's version, left. The works have all been skilfully recreated to be used in an advert for electrical company Philips in Russia. One of Vincent van Gogh’s most renowned works, Self-Portrait with Bandaged Ear and Pipe, is one of the piece's interpreted by the artist using his iron. Known for his distinctive self-portraits, this particular piece captures van Gogh after he famously cut off part of his own ear - although historians have debated whether he was maimed by somebody else. Completed in 1889, the year before his death, the painting shows van Gogh smoking a pipe and wearing a hat. It is currently part of a private collection. Modern art: Rembrandt's classic Self-Portrait with beret and Turned-Up Collar, right, and the version created for Phillips, left. Girl With a Pearl Earring is widely regarded as Johannes Vermeer's best work. It is usually housed in the Mauritshuis gallery, based in The Hague, although the famous painting is currently part of the gallery's touring collection in Japan. A novel of the same name was written by author Tracy Chevalier in 1999 based on the fictional character. A film adaption of the book was released in 2003, starring Scarlett Johansson. The last painting reworked by the artist was Rembrandt’s Self-Portrait with Beret and Turned-Up Collar. The self-portrait has been housed at the National Gallery of Art in Washington DC since 1937, having been painted by the artist in 1659.

Article:","output":"Title: Gateshead Triumphs Over Bromley, Breaking Their Five-Match Winless Streak in National League Introduction: Gateshead FC, a professional football club based in Gateshead, Tyne and Wear, successfully managed to break their five-match winless run in the National League as they secured a convincing victory against Bromley. The team put on an impressive display, putting an end to their recent underwhelming performances. Body: Having faced a difficult time in the National League lately, Gateshead was eager to turn their luck around and get back on track. Their winless streak had raised concerns among their fans, with many questioning the team's capabilities and determination. However, Gateshead managed to silence their critics by putting up a strong performance against Bromley. The match saw Gateshead dominate possession, consistently applying pressure on the Bromley defense. With unwavering determination and well-coordinated teamwork, Gateshead created several goal-scoring opportunities throughout the game. Their persistence ultimately paid off as they managed to find the back of the net, leaving their opponents trailing behind. Bromley, on the other hand, struggled to keep up with Gateshead's tempo and relentless offensive efforts. Despite displaying occasional moments of brilliance, Bromley was unable to capitalize on their chances and find an answer to Gateshead's attacks. The match clearly highlighted the areas in which Bromley needs to improve in order to bounce back from this defeat. Gateshead's victory not only ended their winless streak but also provided a much-needed morale boost for the team and their fans. The win is an indication that Gateshead is more than capable of competing at a higher level in the National League, and their performance serves as a testament to their true potential. Conclusion: Gateshead's resounding victory over Bromley signals a turning point for the team, as they finally put an end to their disappointing winless run in the National League. The team's unwavering perseverance and determination led them to secure a well-deserved win that has reignited the passion and optimism for their season ahead. Gateshead will now look to build upon this momentum in their upcoming fixtures, seeking to continually improve and rise through the ranks of the National League. With renewed hope and confidence, Gateshead's future in the league now looks much brighter."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant. You will be given a task. You must generate a detailed and long answer. Bill and Chris are passionate entomologists. Bill knows everything there is to know about most ants except the Leafcutter ants. Chris studied Leafcutter ants extensively and exclusively for years now. They are good friends and exchange ideas often over a pint of beer.  Which friend studied more about fungus eating ants?  Hint: Most ants are generalist predators, scavengers, and indirect herbivores, but a few have evolved specialised ways of obtaining nutrition. It is believed that many ant species that engage in indirect herbivory rely on specialized symbiosis with their gut microbes to upgrade the nutritional value of the food they collect and allow them to survive in nitrogen poor regions, such as rainforest canopies. Leafcutter ants (Atta and Acromyrmex) feed exclusively on a fungus that grows only within their colonies. They continually collect leaves which are taken to the colony, cut into tiny pieces and placed in fungal gardens. Ergates specialise in related tasks according to their sizes. The largest ants cut stalks, smaller workers chew the leaves and the smallest tend the fungus. Leafcutter ants are sensitive enough to recognise the reaction of the fungus to different plant material, apparently detecting chemical signals from the fungus. If a particular type of leaf is found to be toxic to the fungus, the colony will no longer collect it. The ants feed on structures produced by the fungi called gongylidia. Symbiotic bacteria on the exterior surface of the ants produce antibiotics that kill bacteria introduced into the nest that may harm the fungi.","output":"Based on the information provided, Chris is the friend who studied more about fungus-eating ants. Bill knows everything about most ants except Leafcutter ants, while Chris has dedicated years of his life to studying Leafcutter ants extensively and exclusively.  Leafcutter ants are an excellent example of ants that feed on fungus, as they have evolved specialized ways of obtaining nutrition through an intricate symbiotic relationship with a particular fungus species that grows within their colonies. This unique relationship makes Leafcutter ants highly reliant on the fungus for their nutrition, which is why Chris's knowledge of these ants is particularly relevant when discussing fungus-eating ants. The ants of this group collect leaves which are later processed and cut into tiny pieces by different worker ants according to their size. These pieces of leaves are then placed in their fungal gardens, where they serve as the substrate for the growth of the specific fungus species that the ants depend on for food. The ants feed on gongylidia, which are structures produced by the fungus, and through this process, the ants show remarkable sensitivity in recognizing the reaction of the fungus to different plant materials, potentially detecting chemical signals from the fungus. In addition, Leafcutter ants showcase another fascinating aspect of symbiosis, as they host symbiotic bacteria on their exterior surfaces that produce antibiotics. These antibiotics are crucial for the health of the fungal gardens, as they eliminate harmful bacteria that could otherwise threaten the fungus' survival. By specializing in the study of Leafcutter ants, Chris has delved deep into the world of fungus-eating ants and their unique relationship with their mutualistic fungi, as well as the role of symbiotic bacteria in this fascinating ecosystem. As a result, Chris is the friend who has studied more about fungus-eating ants compared to Bill."},{"instruction":"Explain how you used the definition to come up with the answer.

Summarize this article: See more of Lorene Bible on Facebook ||||| CHETOPA, Kan. — The latest search for a pair of missing Welch girls turned up empty.      Cameras were used Friday to seach a well on property in Chetopa, Kansas, formerly owned by a convicted murderer in hopes of finding the remains of Lauria Bible and Ashley Freeman or a trace of anything that would help investigators solve the 16-year-old mystery.      “The only thing we saw was a old bucket,” said Gary Stansell, an investigator for the district attorney’s office for Craig, Mayes and Rogers counties.      Stansell said he continues to get leads on the case. The Oklahoma State Bureau of Investigation classifies the girls’ 1999 disappearance as an ongoing investigation.      The three-hour search of the well was initiated after Lorene Bible, Lauria’s mother, received a private message on a social networking site.      “The person said come to the old Charlie Krider house and look in the well,” Bible said.      Lauria Bible and Ashley Freeman disappeared after the teens celebrated Ashley’s 16th birthday with a sleepover at the Freeman family home.      In the early morning hours of Dec. 30, 1999, the Freemans’ mobile home in Welch went up in flames, and the charred remains of Ashley’s parents, Danny and Kathy Freeman, were found inside. Both had sustained gunshot wounds that shattered their skulls, according to autopsy reports.      The well, covered with a concrete slab, is around 10 miles north of the Freeman property on an empty lot about a block from the main thoroughfare in Chetopa.      “There are still people scared of whoever did this,” Lorene Bible said. “The fear for them is still there.”      The Chetopa land once was owned by Charles Christian Krider, 54. It was sold after Krider was convicted of second-degree murder in the 2004 death of Judith Schrum, who was strangled before her body was dumped in a Cherokee County creek, according to court documents.      Krider is serving a 14-year sentence, and his earliest possible release date is April 13, 2017, records show.      He was reported to be a close friend and co-worker of Danny Freeman and had several head of cattle on the Freeman farm, Stansell said.      “We’re waiting on the next person who can tell to go look here or you need to go look here,” Lorene Bible said. “I need information that will lead to something good.”      Bible said she receives about two or three tips a month that are serious.      “The law enforcement has been wonderful — whether in Oklahoma or across the state line in Kansas,” she said. “I’ll go on and see what’s next.” ||||| Fifteen years ago Tuesday, Danny and Kathy Freeman were shot and killed and their mobile home set on fire.      Their 16-year-old daughter, Ashley, and her best friend, Lauria Bible, were having a sleepover to celebrate Ashley’s birthday. The teens bodies were not discovered in the charred remains of the mobile home.      Working on the premise that intruders kidnapped and possibly killed the teens, law officers began a frustrating, seemingly endless search that spanned the United States, Canada and Mexico.      Today, law enforcement officers rattle off their names as one word.      Lauria and Ashley.      Their story has been profiled locally, statewide and nationally — and yet it remains unsolved.      Jay and Lorene Bible, Lauria’s parents, are holding a memorial service Tuesday in Vinita, in hopes that publicity might help stir up memories in the case.      “I still believe Lauria is alive,” Lorene Bible said.      The Bibles want all the involved law enforcement agencies — the Oklahoma State Bureau of Investigation, the Craig County sheriff’s office, the Craig County district attorney’s office and the FBI — to sit down with them and release all the information and leads they have and work together to solve the case.      Surviving members of the Freeman family had Ashley declared legally dead in 2010, according to court records.      Meanwhile, investigators say that new leads have surfaced in the past months.      Once such item involves two people, presumably men that got into an argument with Danny Freeman two weeks before the shooting deaths, said Gary Stansill, an investigator for the district attorney in Craig, Mayes and Rogers counties.      “We learned that Danny told friends that two people came to the Freeman’s residence and there was a heated verbal exchange with one of the men,” Stansill said.      Freeman knew one of the men and the other he knew by reputation, the investigator said.      “We are not saying they are suspects,” Stansill said. “We just want to talk with them. If they have nothing to do with the missing girls or the killings, that’s OK — we just want to talk with them.”      Stansill said he doesn’t know what the meeting was about.      “That’s one of the questions we have,” he said.      Danny Freeman reportedly had a hand in marijuana sales, family and friends have said in the past.      “He (Freeman) did tell friends he had to run the men off and if they came back on his property he would run them off with a gun,” Stansill said.      OSBI spokeswoman Jessica Brown said the case is not closed as far as her agency is concerned.      Brown said the agency recently received a tip, “and we will run it out to see if it has validity.”      Brown said the state agency has investigated “hundreds” of leads and tips over the past 15 years.      “Just because it is an old case doesn’t mean it can’t be solved,” Brown said. “We have solved 20- and 30-year-old cases in the past.”      Solving the case depends on getting the right lead, she said.      “Relationships can change between suspects,” Brown said.      What happened?      The Freeman’s property is located just outside of the Welch city limits and at that time was identifiable by the mailbox that sat on top of an iron-chain stand. A half-mile dirt driveway was marked with a rock entrance that led to the family home, which was slightly visible at night due to the few pole lights in the area.      According to an autopsy report, a shotgun blast sheared off the bottom portion of Danny Freeman’s face and Kathy Freeman was shot in the back of the head and was found by investigators lying face down on the couple’s waterbed.      Danny Freeman’s remains were found the next day near the waterbed by the Bibles, who were searching through the ashes.      Danny Freeman’s extensive arrowhead collection was never found in the ruble. Lauria Bible’s car was still parked in front of the Freeman mobile home with the keys in the ignition. The teen’s purse, which contained money, was found in the charred remains of the mobile home.      OSBI investigators also found a small arsenal of weapons as they searched through the debris of the house.      Person of interest      Jeremy Jones, 41, a convicted killer and rapist who once lived in Miami, OK, was a person of interest in the Freemans’ deaths.      “I believe he knows something about the case,” Lorene Bible said.      Arrest records show Jones was arrested on complaints of public drunkenness and possession of drug paraphernalia at 4 a.m. Dec. 30, 1999, roughly 18 miles from the Freeman’s farm.      Jones confessed to killing the couple and setting their mobile home on fire over a drug debt and taking the teenagers to Galena, Kan., where he said he shot them and threw their bodies into an abandoned mine.      A search of the area in June 2005 turned up nothing, and Jones recanted his confession. He has not been charged in the case.      He is now on Alabama’s death row for the murder and rape of a woman from Turnerville, Ala. ||||| By Tiffany Alaniz      Quick Facts:      Lauria Bible and Ashley Freeman disappeared in 1999      Her mother, Lorena, wants anyone who has called tips over 16 years to re-file tips      New Facebook page set up to get tips to find Lauria Bible      Citing changes in staffing, a mother wants help to strengthen a missing person’s investigation.

Given the background: During the 1670s, the Dutch tradesman Antony van Leeuwenhoek, shown in Figure below , used microscopes to observe many microbes and body cells. Leeuwenhoek developed an interest in microscopy and ground his own lenses to make simple microscopes. Leeuwenhoek was so good at making lenses that his simple microscopes were able to magnify much more clearly than the compound microscopes of his day. His microscope's increased ability to magnify over 200x is comparable to a modern compound light microscope. Compound microscopes , which are microscopes that use more than one lens, had been invented around 1595 by Zacharias Jansen, a Dutch spectacle-maker. Several people, including Robert Hooke, had built compound microscopes and were making important discoveries with them during Leeuwenhoek’s time.  and the situation: John is interested in the history of science. He went to a science museum to learn more about microscopes. First he saw a Leeuwenhoek microscope, which was labeled as item A, then he saw a compound microscope of Leeuwenhoek's time, which was labeled as item B. At the very end of his museum tour he saw a modern compound light microscope, which was labeled as item C.  Answer the following question: Which one would have more lenses, item A or item B?","output":"To answer the question of which item would have more lenses, item A or item B, let's review the information provided step by step. Step 1: Understanding the background - Antony van Leeuwenhoek used microscopes to observe microbes and body cells during the 1670s. - He made simple microscopes by grinding his own lenses that had superior magnification compared to compound microscopes of that time. - Compound microscopes, invented around 1595 by Zacharias Jansen, use more than one lens. - Both Leeuwenhoek and other scientists, such as Robert Hooke, were making important discoveries using microscopes during that time. Step 2: Examining the situation - John visits a science museum and sees three items:     A: A Leeuwenhoek microscope     B: A compound microscope from Leeuwenhoek's time     C: A modern compound light microscope Step 3: Comparing items A and B - Item A is a simple microscope made by Leeuwenhoek that uses a single lens. - Item B is a compound microscope from the same time period that uses more than one lens. Conclusion: Item B, the compound microscope from Leeuwenhoek's time, would have more lenses than Item A, the Leeuwenhoek microscope."},{"instruction":"Given two entities as input, classify as \\"yes\\" if second entity is the part of the first entity.

LOS ANGELES (Reuters) - The Roman Catholic Archdiocese of Los Angeles, its former leader Cardinal Roger Mahony and an ex-priest have agreed to pay a total of nearly 10 million to settle four child sex abuse cases brought against them, lawyers for the victims said on Tuesday.      Mahony, who retired in 2011 as head of the largest U.S. archdiocese and is now in Rome taking part in choosing a new pope, was accused of helping a confessed pedophile priest evade law enforcement by sending him out of state to a Church-run treatment center, then placing the priest back in the Los Angeles ministry.      The defrocked priest named in all four cases is Michael Baker, who ultimately was convicted in 2007 and sent to prison on 12 criminal counts of felony oral copulation with a minor involving two boys who reached a previous settlement with the Church.      The latest agreement came four weeks before civil suits brought by two men, now in their 20s, who claimed they were molested as 12-year-olds in the late 1990s, were scheduled to go to trial, plaintiff's attorney Vince Finaldi said.      The two other newly settled cases are less recent. One dates to the late 1970s, before Mahony was archbishop, and the other to 1986, not long after he assumed the post, Finaldi said.      As part of the settlement, approved by a Los Angeles judge earlier this month, none of the parties admitted wrongdoing.      Finaldi said the settlement, together with the recent release of internal Church records documenting the role of Mahony and others in covering up child sexual abuse by the clergy, comes \\"as close to an admission of guilt as you're going to get from the archdiocese.\\"      A lawyer for the archdiocese, Michael Hennigan, confirmed a settlement in the amount of 9.99 million was reached. He added that the archdiocese \\"has always taken the position that we were responsible for the conduct of Michael Baker.\\"      Mahony has \\"admitted that he made serious mistakes in putting Michael Baker back in the ministry,\\" Hennigan said, but he denied that archdiocese officials were involved in a coverup.      Clergy were not legally required under California law to report suspected child abuse to authorities until 1997. Prior to that, Hennigan said, the policy of the archdiocese was to urge families of victims to go to law enforcement on their own.      'NO REASONABLE EXCUSE'      Finaldi, however, disputed the notion that Mahony should be absolved of any obligation to alert authorities.      \\"You have a priest who is confessing that he sexually molested two kids, and you don't pick up the phone and call police? There's no reasonable excuse for not doing that,\\" he said.      Scandals over sex abuse in the U.S. Catholic Church, which erupted in 1992 with a series of molestation cases uncovered in Boston, have cost the Church billions of dollars in settlements and driven prominent dioceses into bankruptcy.      The Los Angeles Archdiocese, which serves 4 million Catholics, reached a 660 million civil settlement in 2007 with more than 500 victims of child molestation, marking the biggest such agreement of its kind in the nation. Mahony at that time called the abuse \\"a terrible sin and crime.\\"      The archdiocese has reached a handful of settlements in other cases since then, but the one announced on Tuesday was by far the biggest, Finaldi added.      In a rare Church rebuke of a cardinal, Mahony was censured in late January by his successor, Archbishop Jose Gomez, and stripped of all public and administrative duties, as punishment for his role in the sex abuse scandal.      The censure followed the public release of over 12,000 pages of confidential files unsealed as part of previous civil suits, revealing how numerous known or suspected pedophiles in the clergy were shielded from law enforcement scrutiny by Mahony and other Church officials.      But Mahony retained his title as cardinal and his right to take part in the Vatican conclave that selects a new pontiff to replace retired Pope Benedict XVI, an authority he chose to exercise.      The resignation of one of Mahony's former top advisers, Thomas Curry, from his post as bishop of Santa Barbara was announced by the archdiocese in conjunction with the censure.      The Church personnel files released earlier this year revealed that in addition to sending abusive priests to a Church-run pedophile treatment center in New Mexico, Mahony and Curry sought to keep priests from later revealing their misconduct to private therapists who would have been obligated to report molestation to police.      In one such memo about Baker's return to Los Angeles, Curry wrote to Mahony suggesting Baker avoid any mention of \\"his past problem\\" to a therapist after release from the Church treatment program, to which Mahony responded with the handwritten note: \\"Sounds good -- please proceed!!\\"      Baker confessed his molestation of two boys to Mahony in 1986, early in Mahony's tenure as archbishop. After six months in treatment, he was placed back in the ministry in the Los Angeles area, supposedly in a job precluding any contact with children, Finaldi said.      But according to Finaldi, Baker was assigned to a residence attached to a church that also operated a school.

Black smoke again billowed from the chimney... (Associated Press)      In the second day of the conclave, thick black smoke billowed from the chimney of the Sistine Chapel, prompting sighs of disappointment from the thousands of people gathered in a rain-soaked and chilly St. Peter's Square.      \\"I'm not happy to see black smoke. We all want white,\\" said the Rev. ThankGod Okoroafor, a Nigerian priest studying theology at Holy Cross University in Rome. \\"But maybe it means that the cardinals need to take time, not to make a mistake in the choice.\\"      Cardinals voted twice Wednesday morning in the Vatican's famed frescoed Sistine Chapel following an inaugural vote Tuesday to elect a successor to Benedict XVI, who stunned the Catholic world last month by becoming the first pope in 600 years to resign.      The cardinals broke for lunch at the Vatican hotel and planned another two rounds of voting Wednesday afternoon.      The drama _ with stage sets by Michelangelo and an outcome that is anyone's guess _ is playing out against the backdrop of the church's need both for a manager who can clean up a corrupt Vatican bureaucracy and a pastor who can revive Catholicism in a time of growing secularism.      The difficulty in finding both attributes in one man, some analysts say, means that the world should brace for a long conclave _ or at least one longer than the four ballots it took to elect Benedict in 2005.      \\"We have not had a conclave over five days since 1831,\\" noted the Rev. Thomas Reese, author of \\"Inside the Vatican,\\" a bible of sorts for understanding the Vatican bureaucracy. \\"So if they are in there over five days, we know they are in trouble; they are having a hard time forming consensus around a particular person.\\"      The names mentioned most often as \\"papabile\\" _ a cardinal who has the stuff of a pope _ include Cardinal Angelo Scola, the archbishop of Milan, an intellect in the vein of Benedict but with a more outgoing personality, and Cardinal Marc Ouellet, the Canadian head of the Vatican's important bishops' office who is also scholarly but reserved like Benedict.      Brazilian Cardinal Odilo Scherer is liked by the Vatican bureaucracy but not by all of his countrymen. And Cardinal Peter Erdo of Hungary has the backing of European cardinals who have twice elected him as head of the European bishops' conference.      On the more pastoral side is Cardinal Sean O'Malley of Boston, the favorite of the Italian press, and Cardinal Timothy Dolan, the back-slapping, outgoing archbishop of New York who has admitted himself that his Italian is pretty bad _ a drawback for a job that is conducted almost exclusively in the language.      Thousands of people braved a chilly rain on Wednesday morning to watch the 6-foot- (2-meter-) high copper chimney on the chapel roof for the smoke signals telling them whether the cardinals had settled on a choice. Nuns recited the rosary, while children splashed in puddles.      After the smoke poured out, the crowds began to dissipate, though a few hangers-on appeared ready to wait out the afternoon balloting.      \\"The more we wait, the better chance we have of having a surprise,\\" said Ludovic de Vernejouls, a 21-year-old Parisian studying architecture in Rome.      Unlike the confusion that reigned during the 2005 conclave, the smoke this time around has been clearly black _ thanks to special smoke flares akin to those used in soccer matches or protests that were lit in the chapel ovens to make the burned ballots black.      The cardinals spent the night sequestered in the Vatican's Santa Marta hotel, an impersonal modern hotel on the edge of the Vatican gardens. They have no access to television, newspapers, cellphones or computers, and the hotel staff has taken an oath of secrecy to not reveal anything they see or hear.

Home Is Where the Green Card Is I ENTERED the green card lottery in the fall of 2010. It was a surprisingly simple form, composed mostly of questions on contact information, but a box that read “Country Claimed” gave me pause. Most applicants write in wherever they were born, but for me it was a bit more complicated; I could not, in good faith, claim any country as my own. I was born in Canada on July 19, 1986. My Iranian-born parents (of Armenian and Russian extraction) were living in Geneva at the time, but Switzerland grants citizenship only to the children of naturalized citizens. My parents, who both worked for the United Nations, didn’t know if they would live there long enough to meet the residency requirements. I was destined to inherit an Iranian passport, and they knew all too well the lifetime of travel and work restrictions that would entail. So they came up with a third-country solution. My mother would fly to Vancouver, British Columbia, wearing an oversize raincoat just weeks before her due date. She would give birth at a local hospital, stay with her brother, who lived there, until my paperwork was processed, and return to Geneva with a Canadian baby in tow. It worked so well that she repeated the process four years later with my brother. My mother was finally naturalized when I was 8, so I was able to become a Swiss citizen after all. But my papers were, once again, misleading. Growing up, I spoke four languages at home — Armenian with my father, Russian with my mother and English and French with baby sitters — and attended international schools in which no one cared where you were from unless it was during the World Cup. I lived in Switzerland, but for all intents and purposes, I grew up on international soil. When I went to college in New York, I was invited to Armenian events on the basis of my last name and Iranian ones on account of my first name, and I didn’t think too much about where I came from. I was busy making friends and falling in love with the city. I spent summers working here, and it was the first place I’d ever lived that felt like home to me. Having spent my entire (albeit short) adult life here, I couldn’t imagine leaving. So when I graduated, I found myself in need of a work visa. There are several types of visas under which foreigners can work here, from seasonal farm work programs to O visas for “extraordinary aliens” — Nobel Prize winners, celebrities and occasionally writers. For someone like me, just starting out in a career, this one was a long shot. The most common visa among college graduates is the H1-B. But the application process takes months, and the employer is required to shell out thousands of dollars in legal fees to pay for sponsorship. The foreigner’s legal status in the country also depends on maintaining his or her employment. When I graduated, right before the Great Recession, no one was sponsoring. I asked a lawyer if there was anything I could do to stay. He took my 100 consultation fee and asked if I had a boyfriend I could marry. I left. But I had no idea where to go. I felt like a foreigner in Geneva, and most of my friends had left. I’d spent no time in Canada. I had nothing in Iran. I tried out Russia for size, but lasted barely six weeks (life advice: don’t go to Russia if you’re depressed). Eventually, I found a job at an international organization in Paris and spent the year Skyping with my New York friends, listening to WNYC reruns on my laptop and applying to graduate schools back in the United States. Had I not had the good fortune and the funds to go back to school, I don’t know where in the world I’d be. In 2010, I was able to return to New York for a master’s program in journalism, and I spent that year working harder than I ever had before. I would have to make up for my nationality with labor and talent, a school counselor told me. When I interviewed for jobs, I felt like a leper.

Glen Grunwald, Former Knicks G.M., Is Not Gloating (but He Could) HAMILTON, Ontario — In Glen Grunwald’s new office at McMaster University’s athletic center, his walls are adorned with a colorful abstract of a fruit vendor, on loan from the university’s art museum, and a framed newspaper clipping about the university’s football team. In spite of Grunwald’s 22-year career as an N.B.A. executive with the Denver Nuggets, the Toronto Raptors and, most recently, the Knicks, the room is remarkably bereft of basketball souvenirs and memorabilia. It is as if the office was decorated for a man not all that interested in the past. The lone memento from that period, a blue banner commemorating the Knicks’ 2012-13 Atlantic Division title, remains rolled up on the floor. “What do you do with it?” Grunwald, the former Knicks general manager, wondered during a recent interview. “I don’t think it’s appropriate for here.” Grunwald, 56, took over in August as athletic director at this midsize university in an unglamorous steel town of roughly half a million people 40 miles west of Toronto. By then, it had been nearly a year since the Knicks had unexpectedly pushed him out of his job despite two straight winning seasons, in 2011-12 and 2012-13, and a run to Game 6 of the 2013 Eastern Conference semifinals. With the Knicks now in the midst of a disastrous season that could turn out to be the worst in their history, Grunwald’s two years at the helm look more impressive by the day. With him as general manager, the Knicks went 90-58, including a division-winning 54-28 mark in 2012-13. It was the first time in 13 years that the Knicks had won as many as 50 games in a season. Not only that, it was Grunwald who had the hunch to scoop up Jeremy Lin, an undrafted N.B.A. castoff, leading to New York’s brief, but beloved, era of Linsanity. And he had the sound judgment to acquire Tyson Chandler, who became a pillar, for the most part, in his three seasons with the Knicks. The acquisition of J. R. Smith was also a coup for Grunwald and the Knicks — at least until last season. True, his 2013 trade for Toronto’s Andrea Bargnani was a dud from the start. Still, no general manager connects on every trade, and Grunwald, known for his expertise with the salary cap and an approach that was all facts and no flash, did well enough to look back with satisfaction. Nothing, it should be emphasized, has gotten better since he left. Only worse. Which is not to say that he gloated when asked about the Knicks, of whom he spoke carefully. “I follow the Knicks; I follow the Raptors,” he said at one point. “Obviously, it’s easier to be a Raptors fan these days than it is a Knicks fan.” Grunwald had a somewhat distinctive pedigree for an N.B.A. executive. He never played beyond college — he was a teammate of Isiah Thomas’s at Indiana — and he is a lawyer, with a degree from Northwestern. He began his N.B.A. career in 1990 as vice president and general counsel of the Nuggets, and then joined the Raptors as a front-office executive in 1994, working under Thomas, who by then was an old friend. When Thomas departed in 1997, Grunwald replaced him as the Raptors’ general manager and stayed until 2004. Two years later, Thomas recruited him to come to New York and help in his wobbly efforts to turn around the Knicks. The turnaround never took place, but when Thomas was pushed aside in 2008, replaced by Donnie Walsh, Grunwald remained as vice president for basketball operations. And in June 2011, when Walsh stepped down, Grunwald, as he had in Toronto, stepped up. First, he was named the interim general manager, and later the permanent one. He did not have Thomas’s glamour, nor Walsh’s long-established reputation, but in the unpredictable, sometimes volatile, world of the Knicks, he achieved more success than either Thomas or Walsh. “He was perfectly groomed,” said Walsh, who is now back in Indiana, again helping to run the Pacers. With the Knicks, he said, Grunwald was his right-hand man, “the guy making the calls to other teams, seeing what interests there were in trades.” “He’s smart, tactful, a real win-win negotiator,” said Dallas Mavericks General Manager Donnie Nelson, who executed the deal with Grunwald that shipped Chandler to New York in 2011. “He knows the business cold.” What Grunwald did not see coming, however, was the decision by James L. Dolan, the Knicks’ owner, to dump him on the eve of the team’s 2013 training camp, replacing him with a former club executive, Steve Mills. The Knicks never stated a reason for the move, although some attributed it to Dolan’s belief that Mills would be a more polished, and perhaps stylish, person to lead the team’s pursuit of free agents. To Grunwald, the whole thing remains hard to fathom. “I thought I’d done a really good job in New York and I thought I had helped improve the culture,” he said. “Jim just didn’t think I was the guy.” Looking back, and still speaking carefully, Grunwald said he felt he had a “good working relationship” with Dolan, who has often been accused of being a meddling owner. “I thought we had honest discussions,” Grunwald added. “No, we didn’t agree on everything.” As the Knicks stumbled in their first season under Mills, their good vibes from the season before all gone, Grunwald combed the basketball wilderness, meeting, he said, with three Western Conference teams — Oklahoma City, San Antonio and Dallas — to talk about front-office positions. He interviewed unsuccessfully for the athletic director’s post at Stony Brook University. Mills did not even make it through a full season as Grunwald’s successor, pushed aside by Dolan’s hiring of Phil Jackson in March. Three months after that shake-up, Grunwald got a call from a headhunter leading McMaster’s search, asking if he could recommend replacements for the departing athletic director. The Chicago-born Grunwald, who became a Canadian citizen 15 years ago, was familiar with the university from his time in Toronto. So he threw his name into the hat. Despite the comedown from the Garden to a university where he steers a budget of roughly 12 million, Grunwald declines to view the change in job assignments as some sort of fall from grace. Running a university athletics department, he said, had been something that had intrigued him since his playing days at Indiana, with whom he won a national championship in 1981. “The opportunity to give back, to thank the people that helped me through my student-athlete days and to help this generation of student-athletes is really what excited me about it,” he said. He oversees a student-athlete body of 700, as well as the second-ranked football program in Canadian university sports and highly regarded teams in men’s and women’s basketball. And he is learning the rules of rugby as quickly as he can because McMaster’s women reached the national finals last month. Grunwald acknowledged that one of McMaster’s concerns during the hiring process was whether he would decamp if a more prestigious offer came about, particularly from the N.B.A. While he has no fixed contract with the university, he insisted he was not pining for a return to professional basketball. But he is not closed to the possibility, and he grew pensive when asked about those who view his current job as evidence he is no longer cut out for the N.B.A. “I think my record speaks for itself,” he said in a rare moment of self-promotion. “People tell me I have a good reputation, but whether that’s just people being nice to me, or in fact it’s true, I don’t know.” What he does know, of course, is that the Knicks won 54 games two seasons ago and are unlikely to win half that many this time around.

In some trees, the wood laid on late in the life of a tree is softer, lighter, weaker, and more even-textured than that produced earlier, but in other trees, the reverse applies. This may or may not correspond to heartwood and sapwood.

Step 1: Identify the main question. \\"Why are specific seasons for bow hunting established?\\" Step 2: Understand the context and possible reasons. There may be several reasons for establishing specific seasons for bow hunting, such as conservation efforts, population control, maintaining ecological balance, and ensuring hunter safety.  Step 3: Analyze the provided statement. \\"Regulations for big-game hunting often specify a minimum caliber or muzzle energy for firearms.\\" This statement is about firearms regulations, not bow hunting seasons. While it's true that hunting regulations often specify requirements for certain types of hunting, this statement does not directly answer the question about why specific seasons for bow hunting are established.  Step 4: Refute the provided statement. The given statement does not adequately answer the main question. By focusing exclusively on firearm regulations, it does not address the fundamental reasons behind establishing specific bow hunting seasons. Step 5: Provide a justified explanation. Specific seasons for bow hunting are established for several reasons, including: 1. Wildlife conservation: Different species breed and rear their young at various times of the year. Limiting hunting to specific seasons helps protect populations during their vulnerable life stages, ensuring population stability and promoting healthy ecosystems. 2. Population control: Bow hunting seasons can be timed to prevent overpopulation in certain areas. For example, allowing hunting only after the breeding season reduces the number of animals without affecting the yearly reproduction cycle. 3. Ecological balance: Maintaining specific hunting seasons helps preserve the balance within ecosystems by managing species populations and avoiding detrimental effects on other plants and animals. 4. Hunter safety: Bow hunting requires different skills and techniques than firearm hunting. Establishing specific seasons for bow hunting reduces the risk of accidents and ensures that hunters can enjoy a safer experience.

Does it follow that \\"Only the white horses were hunted at first. \\"?","output":"Based on the given information, it's not possible to definitively determine if \\"Only the white horses were hunted at first.\\" However, I can provide additional context and possible implications of the statement within the wider discussion of horse hunting on the Texas plains. Firstly, it is important to understand the broader context of horse hunting during the period, as it may provide some clues about the preference for white horses. Historically, during the 19th century, the Texas plains were home to a diverse range of wild horses that were the descendants of domesticated horses brought to the Americas by Spanish explorers. These horses, commonly known as Mustangs, were highly sought after for their endurance, speed, and agility. As a result, horse hunting and capturing wild horses for various purposes became a significant part of the settlers' and native tribes' way of life in the area. If it's true that \\"Only the white horses were hunted at first,\\" this could imply that the hunters could have had specific reasons for singling out white horses in their initial hunts. Some possible explanations for this preference could include: 1. Rarity and Symbolism: White horses are relatively less common compared to other colors. As a result, their rarity might have made them more desirable to catch and own. Additionally, many cultures attach symbolic meaning to white horses, often regarding them as a sign of purity, power, or nobility. This cultural significance could also have been a motivating factor behind hunting primarily white horses. 2. Visibility and Ease of Tracking: Given the vast expanses of the Texas plains, visibility and recognition of wild horses from a distance would have been of utmost importance to hunters. White horses, due to their prominent color, would have stood out in contrast to the more common, darker-colored horses, making them easier to track and spot from afar. However, it is crucial to remember that these are just speculations, and the provided information does not necessarily confirm that \\"Only the white horses were hunted at first.\\" To reach a more accurate conclusion, more context and details about Anse's stories and the specific circumstances surrounding the horse hunting practices on the Texas plains would be necessary."},{"instruction":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

Question: Found the following article online, use it to answer the question: What is the name of the band John's suggested could produce an instrumental album at some stage in the future?  In writing Young Modern, Johns tried to make the music sound very simple, despite a complex musical structure. The lyrics were written after the music was created, sometimes as late as the day of recording. As Johns dreads writing lyrics, he suggested that the band could produce an instrumental album at some stage in the future. Johns is the band's primary songwriter, and notes that while Joannou and Gillies do not have significant influence on what he writes, they are key to the band's overall sound. For that album, Hamilton co-wrote four songs with Johns including the APRA Award-winning \\"Straight Lines\\". Joannou believed that Young Modern was simpler than Diorama but \\"still as complex underneath with simple pop song elements\\". He said that much of the band's success resulted from trying to push themselves harder in recording and writing. Self-producing has allowed the band to do so without the pressures of a record label.Gillies notes that Silverchair will often \\"run the risk of losing fans\\" with their work, and this was evident in the changes in musical direction in Diorama and Young Modern. However, he described this as a good thing, describing the fact \\"that we haven't been pigeonholed, and people really don't know what to expect\\" as one of the attractive elements of the band. Despite the ups and downs of success at a young age, Gillies says the band \\"appreciate what we've achieved and what we've got\\" in their careers. The band have received six APRA Awards with Johns winning three songwriting awards at the 2008 ceremony.

Answer the following question: The answer to the question: What is the type of whale that can weigh up to 190 metric tons? is inside the article: Whales are a widely distributed and diverse group of fully aquatic placental marine mammals. They are an informal grouping within the infraorder Cetacea, usually excluding dolphins and porpoises. Whales, dolphins and porpoises belong to the order Cetartiodactyla, which consists of even-toed ungulates. Their closest living relatives are the hippopotamuses, having diverged about 40 million years ago. The two parvorders of whales, baleen whales (Mysticeti) and toothed whales (Odontoceti), are thought to have split apart around 34 million years ago.  Whales consist of eight extant families: Balaenopteridae (the rorquals), Balaenidae (right whales), Cetotheriidae (the pygmy right whale), Eschrichtiidae (the grey whale), Monodontidae (belugas and narwhals), Physeteridae (the sperm whale), Kogiidae (the dwarf and pygmy sperm whale), and Ziphiidae (the beaked whales). Whales are creatures of the open ocean; they feed, mate, give birth, suckle and raise their young at sea. So extreme is their adaptation to life underwater that they are unable to survive on land. Whales range in size from the 2.6 metres (8.5 ft) and 135 kilograms (298 lb) dwarf sperm whale to the 29.9 metres (98 ft) and 190 metric tons (210 short tons) blue whale, which is the largest creature that has ever lived. The sperm whale is the largest toothed predator on earth. Several species exhibit sexual dimorphism, in that the females are larger than males. Baleen whales have no teeth; instead they have plates of baleen, a fringe-like structure used to expel water while retaining the krill and plankton which they feed on. They use their throat pleats to expand the mouth to take in huge gulps of water. Balaenids have heads that can make up 40% of their body mass to take in water. Toothed whales, on the other hand, have conical teeth adapted to catching fish or squid. Baleen whales have a well developed sense of \\"smell\\", whereas toothed whales have well-developed hearing − their hearing, that is adapted for both air and water, is so well developed that..., can you guess it ?

On the bright side, Dudovitz has extended his respected program to clients in the San Gabriel-Pomona Valley, and he now operates on a much larger budget, 6.5 million last year. However, his clash with the old San Gabriel program resulted in litigation, bitter feelings and a mission that some say is not clearly focused on serving poor people. \\"It was a difficult situation that was probably mishandled by everyone,\\" a longtime observer of the public interest community said of the San Fernando Valley-San Gabriel-Pomona Valley merger. \\"There are very few people who come out as the heroes. Personalities got involved when they shouldn't have. Things were said that caused bad feelings and couldn't be unsaid.\\" Iwasaki's merger with the smaller, 48-year-old Long Beach program was friendly and fast, and no one - not even Long Beach board members - lost a job. When it was over, Iwasaki had 1 million more in federal dollars and two new offices. Long Beach clients regained services they had lost years ago when federal budget cuts and dwindling grants reduced the staff of 15 lawyers to five and cut immigration and consumer law programs. Iwasaki said, \\"[I judged the transition] better than I could have hoped for.\\"  Question: \\"How long was the Long Beach Program been in operation?\\" Answer: \\"6.5 years\\" Is this answer correct?","output":"No, the answer is not correct. The Long Beach program has been in operation for 48 years, not 6.5 years.

What's the most logical way to complete this passage? (CNN) -- Playing cards with images of Hitler. Toy fuhrers. And a lamp and church tapestry with swastikas emblazoned across the front. No, it's not a neo-Nazi convention. Rather, it is a groundbreaking exhibit that opened Friday in the German capital and is intended to show Adolf Hitler's relationship with the German people. Germany has produced exhibits on the Holocaust and Nazism before but never since World War II has one focused solely on the man who taught an entire nation to hate. \\"Hitler and the Germans\\" is not about the fascist dictator's memorabilia, not about the man himself, said curator Hans-Ulrech Thamer. It's not about textbook history or scholarly writings. Thamer hopes viewers -- many of whom are sure to be","output":"shocked and disturbed by the contents -- will come away from the exhibit with a deeper understanding of the complex dynamics between Hitler and the German population during his rise to power and reign. By displaying these controversial artifacts and symbols, the exhibit aims to explore how Hitler was able to manipulate and control the people, and how a nation collectively fell under his spell. It serves as a stark reminder of the dangers of totalitarianism and the consequences of blind obedience to a single leader. Visitors to the \\"Hitler and the Germans\\" exhibit can expect to be confronted with challenging questions about how a society was so easily swayed by one man and his extreme ideologies. Through examining Hitler's influence on popular culture, everyday objects, and national sentiment, the curator hopes to prompt reflection and discussion on how these factors allowed for the widespread acceptance of hateful beliefs and ultimately, the atrocities committed during the Holocaust. The exhibit serves as a cautionary tale, urging individuals to remain vigilant in recognizing and standing up against hateful ideologies, no matter where they appear."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Answer the following question: Information:  - The Territory of Papua and New Guinea was established by an administrative union between the Australian-administered territories of Papua and New Guinea in 1949. In 1972, the name of the Territory changed to \\"Papua New Guinea\\" and in 1975 it became the independent nation of Papua New Guinea.  - Pomerania is a region on the southern shore of the Baltic Sea in Central Europe, split between Germany and Poland.  - The Battle of Cape Gloucester was a battle in the Pacific theater of World War II between Japanese and Allied forces which took place on the island of New Britain , Territory of New Guinea , between late December 1943 and April 1944 . The battle was a major part of Operation Cartwheel , the main Allied strategy in the South West Pacific Area and Pacific Ocean Areas during 1943 -- 44 , and was the second World War II landing of the U.S. 1st Marine Division , after Guadalcanal .  - The Territory of New Guinea was an Australian administered territory on the island of New Guinea from 1920 until 1975. In 1949, the Territory and the Territory of Papua were established in an administrative union by the name of the Territory of Papua and New Guinea. That administrative union was renamed as Papua New Guinea in 1971. Notwithstanding that it was part of an administrative union, the Territory of New Guinea at all times retained a distinct legal status and identity until the advent of the Independent State of Papua New Guinea.  - Rabaul is a township in East New Britain province, on the island of New Britain, in the country of Papua New Guinea. New Britain is an island about 60 kilometres to the east of the island of New Guinea. Rabaul was the provincial capital and most important settlement in the province until it was destroyed in 1994 by falling ash of a volcanic eruption.  - New Britain, is the largest island in the Bismarck Archipelago (named after Otto von Bismarck) of Papua New Guinea. It is separated from the island of New Guinea by the Dampier and Vitiaz Straits and from New Ireland by St. George's Channel. The main towns of New Britain are Rabaul/Kokopo and Kimbe. The island is roughly the size of Taiwan. While the island was part of German New Guinea, it was named Neupommern (\\"New Pomerania\\").  - Kimbe is the capital of the province of West New Britain in Papua New Guinea. It is a port town on the great Kimbe Bay which boasts more than 60 percent of the coral species of the entire Indo-Pacific. The bustling town of Kimbe is the third largest port in Papua New Guinea and is the fastest growing city in the South Pacific. Accommodation in Kimbe is readily available in many high-class resorts and hotels, as well as many budget guesthouses and motels dribbled along the province. The town of Kimbe is served by Hoskins Airport.  - Vitiaz Strait is a strait between New Britain and the Huon Peninsula, northern New Guinea.   - During World War II, the American atomic bombings of Hiroshima and Nagasaki made Nagasaki the second and, to date, last city in the world to experience a nuclear attack.  - German New Guinea was the first part of the German colonial empire. It was a protectorate from 1884 until 1914 when it fell to Australian forces following the outbreak of the First World War. It consisted of the northeastern part of New Guinea and several nearby island groups. The mainland part of German New Guinea and the nearby islands of the Bismarck Archipelago and the North Solomon Islands are now part of Papua New Guinea. The Micronesian islands of German New Guinea are now governed as the Federated States of Micronesia, the Marshall Islands, Nauru, the Northern Mariana Islands and Palau.  - Operation Cartwheel (19431944) was a major military strategy for the Allies in the Pacific theater of World War II. Cartwheel was a twin-axis of advance operation, aimed at militarily neutralizing the major Japanese base at Rabaul. The operation was directed by the Supreme Allied Commander in the South West Pacific Area (SWPA)General Douglas MacArthurwhose forces advanced along the northeast coast of New Guinea and occupied nearby islands. Allied forces from the Pacific Ocean Areas commandunder Admiral Chester W. Nimitzadvanced through the Solomon Islands toward Bougainville. The Allied forces involved were from Australia, the Netherlands, New Zealand, the US and various Pacific Islands.  - The United States dropped nuclear weapons on the Japanese cities of Hiroshima and Nagasaki on August 6 and 9, 1945, respectively, during the final stage of World War II. The United States had dropped the bombs with the consent of the United Kingdom as outlined in the Quebec Agreement. The two bombings, which killed at least 129,000 people, remain the only use of nuclear weapons for warfare in history.  - Cape Gloucester (also known as Tuluvu) is a headland on the northern side of the far west of the island of New Britain, Papua New Guinea. During World War II, the Japanese captured New Britain, and had driven most of Cape Gloucester's native population out to construct two airfields. During the New Britain Campaign, American forces had decided to capture Cape Gloucester for its two airfields, to assist planned attacks on the garrison on Rabaul, an important area in New Britain. It became the site of the Battle of Cape Gloucester, part of Operation Cartwheel, in 1943. After long fighting through rain, and Japanese, the United States 1st Marine Division had it declared secured. After the war, the headland was given back to the natives.  - Papua New Guinea (PNG  Hiri Motu: \\"Papua Niu Gini\\"), officially the Independent State of Papua New Guinea, is an Oceanian country that occupies the eastern half of the island of New Guinea and its offshore islands in Melanesia, a region of the southwestern Pacific Ocean north of Australia. Its capital, located along its southeastern coast, is Port Moresby. The western half of New Guinea forms the Indonesian provinces of Papua and West Papua.  - Hiroshima is perhaps best known as the first city in history to be targeted by a nuclear weapon when the United States Army Air Forces (USAAF) dropped an atomic bomb on the city (and later on Nagasaki) at 8:15 a.m. on August 6, 1945, near the end of World War II.  - An island or isle is any piece of sub-continental land that is surrounded by water. Very small islands such as emergent land features on atolls can be called islets, skerries, cays or keys. An island in a river or a lake island may be called an eyot or ait, and a small island off the coast may be called a holm. A grouping of geographically or geologically related islands is called an archipelago, e.g. the Philippines.  - World War II (often abbreviated to WWII or WW2), also known as the Second World War, was a global war that lasted from 1939 to 1945, although related conflicts began earlier. It involved the vast majority of the world's nationsincluding all of the great powerseventually forming two opposing military alliances: the Allies and the Axis. It was the most widespread war in history, and directly involved more than 100 million people from over 30 countries. In a state of \\"total war\\", the major participants threw their entire economic, industrial, and scientific capabilities behind the war effort, erasing the distinction between civilian and military resources. Marked by mass deaths of civilians, including the Holocaust (in which approximately 11 million people were killed) and the strategic bombing of industrial and population centres (in which approximately one million were killed, and which included the atomic bombings of Hiroshima and Nagasaki), it resulted in an estimated 50 million to 85 million fatalities. These made World War II the deadliest conflict in human history.  - The Holocaust (from the Greek ': \\"hólos\\", \\"whole\\" and \\"kaustós\\", \\"burnt\\"), also referred to as the Shoah\\"' (Hebrew: , \\"HaShoah\\", \\"the catastrophe\\"), was a genocide in which Adolf Hitler's Nazi Germany and its collaborators killed about six million Jews. The victims included 1.5 million children and represented about two-thirds of the nine million Jews who had resided in Europe. Some definitions of the Holocaust include the additional five million non-Jewish victims of Nazi mass murders, bringing the total to about 11 million. Killings took place throughout Nazi Germany, German-occupied territories, and territories held by allies of Nazi Germany.  - Otto Eduard Leopold, Prince of Bismarck, Duke of Lauenburg (1 April 1815  30 July 1898), known as Otto von Bismarck, was a conservative Prussian statesman who dominated German and European affairs from the 1860s until 1890. In the 1860s, he engineered a series of wars that unified the German states, significantly and deliberately excluding Austria, into a powerful German Empire under Prussian leadership. With that accomplished by 1871, he skillfully used balance of power diplomacy to maintain Germany's position in a Europe which, despite many disputes and war scares, remained at peace. For historian Eric Hobsbawm, it was Bismarck who \\"remained undisputed world champion at the game of multilateral diplomatic chess for almost twenty years after 1871, [and] devoted himself exclusively, and successfully, to maintaining peace between the powers.\\"  - The Bismarck Archipelago is a group of islands off the northeastern coast of New Guinea in the western Pacific Ocean and is part of the Islands Region of Papua New Guinea. Its area is about 50,000 square km.  - Kokopo is the capital of East New Britain in Papua New Guinea. The capital was moved from Rabaul in 1994 when the volcanoes Tavurvur and Vulcan erupted. As a result, the population of the town increased more than sixfold from 3,150 in 1990 to 20,262 in 2000.  - Taiwan, officially the Republic of China (ROC), is a state in East Asia. Neighbors include China (officially the People's Republic of China, abbreviated as PRC) to the west, Japan to the northeast, and the Philippines to the south. Taiwan is the most populous state that is not a member of the United Nations, and the one with the largest economy.  - New Guinea (or, historically, \\"\\") is a large Island in the South West Pacific region.  - The Territory of Papua comprised the southeastern quarter of the island of New Guinea from 1883 to 1975. In 1883, the Government of Queensland annexed this territory for the British Empire. The United Kingdom Government refused to ratify the annexation but in 1884 a Protectorate was proclaimed over the territory, then called \\"British New Guinea\\". There is a certain ambiguity about the exact date on which the entire territory was annexed by the British. The Papua Act 1905 recites that this happened \\"on or about\\" 4 September 1888. On 18 March 1902, the Territory was placed under the authority of the Commonwealth of Australia. Resolutions of acceptance were passed by the Commonwealth Parliament, who accepted the territory under the name of Papua.

Surrounded - \\"Surrounded\\" is the main verb of the sentence and describes a specific relationship between the place of worship and the park mentioned later in the sentence. In this context, it means that the place of worship is enclosed or encircled by the park on all sides. By using \\"surrounded,\\" the sentence is able to paint a very specific and vivid image of the relationship between the two main elements of the sentence. 3. Beautiful - \\"Beautiful\\" is an adjective that adds a descriptive quality to the park mentioned in the phrase \\"beautiful park.\\" By describing the park as beautiful, the sentence conveys the aesthetic appeal and pleasant nature of the park. This enhanced description of the park adds an emotional and visual element to the sentence, allowing the reader to imagine the picturesque surroundings of the mentioned place of worship.  4. Park - Lastly, \\"park\\" is the primary object of the sentence and it tells us what is surrounding the place of worship. A park is an area of land, typically with trees, grass, and other natural features, set aside for public use and enjoyment. Essentially, knowing that a park surrounds the place of worship provides us with information about the setting and environment. In summary, the most important words in the sentence \\"place of worship is surrounded by beautiful park\\" are \\"place of worship,\\" \\"surrounded,\\" \\"beautiful,\\" and \\"park.\\" Each of these words plays a significant role in conveying the main idea of the sentence, which is to describe the location and setting of a religious site in an aesthetically appealing and pleasant environment."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

I will try to solve the given instance step by step. Step 1: Understand the question. In this case, we have a series of Persian numbers: ۲۹ ۱۳ ۸ ۵. We need to find the missing number, denoted by \\"و؟و\\". Step 2: Identify the pattern in the series. The most apparent pattern seems to be a decreasing series. Let's subtract the first two numbers to determine the difference:  ۲۹ - ۱۳ = ۱۶ Step 3: Subtract the second and third numbers to make sure the pattern holds: ۱۳ - ۸ = ۵ Step 4: We notice that the difference in the two subtractions (۱۶ and ۵) is ۱۱. Let's apply this decrease to the next subtraction: ۵ - ۱۱ = -۶ Step 5: The missing number should be ۵ - ۵ (the difference between ۱۳ and ۸) which is 0, but since we've got a negative number (-۶) in our calculation and there's no 0 among the options, it is possible, we have an error in identifying the pattern or the pattern is not straightforward. Step 6: Review the problem and try to identify another pattern.  The numbers look like this in the Latin numeral system: 29 و؟و 13 8 5 Notice that the initial pattern could also be derived by switching the Persian digits in the numbers, like this: 2 -> 1 (2 to 1) 9 -> 3 (from 9 to 3 which is 6 subtracts) Another way to think about this pattern is the decrease of the digit subtracts: 2-1=1, 9-3=6, 1-6=5, now we can apply pattern to 8 Step 7: Apply the new pattern to the remaining number ۸ - ۵ = ۳ Step 8: Find the option with the calculated number.

It is well understood that a proper diet can work wonders for our mental and physical well-being. A healthy diet not only helps in preventing and controlling various health issues but also enables us to lead an active and fulfilling lifestyle. In this article, we will explore the key components of a balanced and nutritional diet, including foods that are high in fiber, omega-3 fatty acids, and potassium. Alongside, we underscore the significance of consulting a doctor before incorporating supplements into your dietary routine.  A Moderate, Lean Diet: The Foundation of a Healthy Lifestyle A balanced diet typically consists of an appropriate mix of nutrients, vitamins, and minerals to meet our body's daily requirements. When we talk about a moderate, lean diet, we refer to the consumption of nutrient-dense foods that are low in fat and sugar. Implementing such a diet involves the following steps: 1. Limiting the intake of foods high in sugar and fat: High sugar and fatty food items can lead to weight gain, increase cholesterol levels, and even contribute to the development of chronic diseases such as heart ailments and diabetes. It is crucial to substitute these items with healthier alternatives, including whole grain products, lean protein sources, and fresh fruits and vegetables. 2. Increasing fiber intake: A fiber-rich diet helps regulate digestion, lowers cholesterol levels, and reduces the risk of developing colorectal cancer. Foods containing high fiber levels include whole grain bread and pasta, beans, legumes, fruits, and vegetables. Aim to consume around 25 to 38 grams of fiber per day, depending on your age and gender. 3. Incorporating omega-3 fatty acids: Omega-3 fatty acids are essential for healthy brain function and reducing inflammation in the body. Foods rich in omega-3 fatty acids include fatty fish (e.g., salmon, mackerel, and sardines), walnuts, flaxseeds, and chia seeds. 4. Enhancing dietary potassium: Potassium is an essential mineral that helps maintain proper functioning of cells, nerves, and muscles. Additionally, it contributes to lowering blood pressure. Foods abundant in potassium include leafy green vegetables, bananas, potatoes, and yogurt. 5. Discussing supplements with your doctor: As the saying goes, there's no one-size-fits-all when it comes to dietary requirements, and this applies to supplementation too. It's essential to talk to your physician about what vitamins and minerals are necessary to complement your diet and whether you require specific supplements to help you reach optimal health.  Conclusion Embarking on the journey to a healthier lifestyle may seem daunting, but by making small, sustainable changes to your diet, you can achieve significant benefits in your overall well-being. By focusing on a moderate, lean diet and incorporating nutrient-dense, wholesome foods, one can improve physical health, increase energy levels, and promote mental clarity. Remember, consulting with a healthcare professional is crucial when considering supplements, as individual needs may vary. Embrace the path to a healthier and more balanced lifestyle with these dietary changes, and celebrate the transformative, long-lasting effects on your well-being."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

You will be given a task. You must generate a detailed and long answer. Summarize: and get your sleeping gear set up while it’s light out. Decide on the location for two different stations: one for your tent and one for your cooking station. Keep a safe distance between your cooking station and your tent, just to lower the chances of wildlife poking around your tent. Set up your tent according to the instructions once you’ve decided where you’d like to place it, and lay out your sleeping pads, bags, blankets, and pillows. If you’ve never set up a tent before, it might be a good idea to take a stab at it before your trip. Most tents come with detailed instructions and aren’t very difficult to erect, so just be patient and it’ll get done in no time! Get your cooking area set up about 200 feet (61 m) away from your tent. Check your location’s rules to see if you need to set up a bear box or bag to hold your food. Keep all food containers closed when you’re not using them, and dispose of trash as soon as you can. If you’re backpacking, put all trash into a resealable bag so its scent doesn’t travel far. Plan on wearing different clothes when you cook, especially if you’ll be grilling meat. Wear a jacket or top that you can leave with your food instead of taking it back to the tent. A greasy, smoky shirt that smells like hamburger might be a temptation to prowling creatures. Once you’ve put up your tent, take a walk around the campsite to figure out how far away the amenities are. If you’re backpacking, it’s really important to establish where you’ll go to the bathroom, how to get to water, and where the firewood is before the sun sets.  Once nighttime comes and you’re using a flashlight to get around, you’ll be glad to know the general direction you need to go. For men and boys, peeing on the trees can be a fun and convenient part of any camping trip - especially at night, when facilities are a long distance away, or if there is a limited supply of facilities for defecation and/or female campers.  The only restrictions are that you use common sense when you do this and always go at least 200 feet away from a water source. in a safe and appropriate spot when you’re ready for it. If you’re at a campsite, there may be a specific place where you need to make your fires, like a fire pit. If you’re out in the woods, create your own fire pit that is at least 8 feet (2.4 m) away from dead grass and other vegetation. Dig down into the dirt 3 to 4 inches (7.6 to 10.2 cm) and create a mound of dirt around the hole to act as a wall. You can also put rocks around the dirt area to enclose it and keep the fire in place. Every fire needs tinder, kindling, and firewood. Tinder is something small, like pieces of cardboard, lint, or wood shavings. Kindling is made up of small twigs and branches. Firewood can be whole or split logs, and it always needs to be dry. Once you have your campsite set up, take a moment to say “hi” to anyone who is camping near you. You might make some new friends, and it’s helpful to be familiar with who is nearby in case either of you needs help at some point. It can be exhausting just setting up camp, so take a load off, have a snack, and rest for a little while before moving on to your first activity. If you’re camping with pets, take them around the campsite and let them smell everything. There are lots of new scents and it’ll help them calm down if they can explore a little.","output":"To have an enjoyable and safe camping experience, it is crucial to set up your campsite properly while there's still daylight available. First, choose two different locations for your tent and cooking station, maintaining a safe distance between them to reduce the likelihood of wildlife coming near your sleeping area. When setting up the tent, follow the provided instructions and ensure you have your sleeping essentials such as pads, bags, blankets, and pillows. It is advisable to practice setting up your tent prior to your trip if you are inexperienced. Your cooking area should ideally be set up about 200 feet (61 m) away from the tent. Comply with the campsite's rules, store food securely in a bear box or bag if necessary, and dispose of trash promptly. When preparing meals, consider wearing different clothing that you will not be taking back to the tent, as this may attract animals due to the scent. Familiarize yourself with the campsite’s amenities, such as bathroom facilities, water sources, and firewood; this will be beneficial once darkness falls. When it comes to using the washroom outdoors, remember to use common sense and maintain a distance of at least 200 feet from water sources. For creating a fire, follow the campsite-specific guidelines or, if in the woods, establish your fire pit at a safe distance from vegetation. Prepare essential fire components such as tinder, kindling, and dry firewood. Once your campsite is set up, take the time to greet nearby campers, which can create a sense of camaraderie and help establish support networks in case of emergencies. After setting up your camp, take a break to relax and recharge before commencing other camping activities. In case you are camping with pets, let them explore the area and familiarize themselves with the new surroundings to feel more at ease."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

The film opens in the year 1958, where steel heiress Edna Buxton enters a talent contest. Her overbearing mother is at odds with her, arguing that Edna should choose a specific song and wardrobe for the contest. At the contest, Edna swaps dresses with a blue singer named Doris, and even changes her song at the last minute, infuriating her mother, who leaves before seeing Edna win the competition. An excited Edna decides to use her grand prize winnings to record a demo. The studio producer tactfully delivers the painful truth to Edna that not only are girl singers not getting signed, the record companies are trying to get rid of the ones currently on their rosters.

It is not clear why, in 1873, Alkan decided to emerge from his self-imposed obscurity to give a series of six Petits Concerts at the Érard piano showrooms. It may have been associated with the developing career of Delaborde, who, returning to Paris in 1867, soon became a concert fixture, including in his recitals many works by his father, and who was at the end of 1872 given the appointment that had escaped Alkan himself, Professor at the Conservatoire. The success of the Petits Concerts led to them becoming an annual event (with occasional interruptions caused by Alkan's health) until 1880 or possibly beyond. The Petits Concerts featured music not only by Alkan but of his favourite composers from Bach onwards, played on both the piano and the pédalier, and occasionally with the participation of another instrumentalist or singer. He was assisted in these concerts by his siblings, and by other musicians including Delaborde, Camille Saint-Saëns, and Auguste Franchomme.Those encountering Alkan at this phase included the young Vincent d'Indy, who recalled Alkan's \\"skinny, hooked fingers\\" playing Bach on an Érard pedal piano: \\"I listened, riveted to the spot by the expressive, crystal-clear playing.\\" Alkan later played Beethoven's Op. 110 sonata, of which d'Indy said: \\"What happened to the great Beethovenian poem ...

Answer the following question: Build a movie plot around this: How are the aliens powering their powerful equipment? Using stolen grid power. Answer:","output":"Title: \\"The Gridbreakers\\" Genre: Sci-Fi, Action & Adventure Plot:  In a not-so-distant future, Earth's environment is critically deteriorating due to climate change and overuse of fossil fuels. Humanity desperately seeks out new renewable energy sources in order to preserve our planet. Responding to an urgent call for help, top scientists across the globe collaborate to bring the entire Earth's power system onto a single, unified energy grid which they believe will offer a sustainable and efficient energy source. Unbeknownst to mankind, an advanced alien species, known as the Xylarions, have been monitoring Earth for centuries, and they are facing an energy crisis of their own. Their once-powerful energy reactors on their home planet, Xylaria, have begun failing rapidly, putting their entire civilization at risk. In desperate need of new energy sources to power their advanced technology and stabilize their planet, the Xylarions plan a covert mission to infiltrate Earth. Upon learning of the new unified energy grid, the aliens realize it presents them with the perfect opportunity to siphon energy for their dying planet. Implanted into human bodies, they blend into society and strategically position themselves as engineers, technicians, and operators within key power facilities connected to the unified grid. Utilizing advanced alien technology, they begin to discreetly divert a portion of Earth's power away from the grid and onto hidden reservoirs which transmit the energy back to their home planet. As Earth's energy consumption mysteriously increases and blackouts become more frequent, the scientific community grows increasingly alarmed. Fearing the grid could collapse completely, they assign an elite team of investigators, led by the brilliant yet eccentric Dr. Eve Ramirez, to uncover the cause of these mysterious power drains. As Dr. Ramirez and her team delve into the case, they inadvertently stumble upon evidence of extraterrestrial involvement. Racing against time, they must come to terms with the shocking reality of alien infiltration and uncover the full extent of the Xylarions' power-stealing operation. As the unified grid approaches its breaking point, drastic measures are called for: a tense alliance between humans and a sympathetic group of Xylarion defectors arises. These defectors, who believe in coexistence, propose a solution: introducing Earth to abundant, sustainable energy technologies that can power both Earth and Xylaria, eliminating both civilizations' energy crises. With Earth's society and the entire alien civilization hanging in the balance, Dr. Ramirez and the unexpected Xylarion allies must confront the sinister alien operatives on Earth, bring their power-stealing operation to a halt, and introduce the advanced technology to power the unified grid sustainably—for the greater good of both races and planets alike. In a thrilling climax, both humans and Xylarions come together to overcome their differences and work as one, ultimately uniting their worlds and securing a promising future for both species. The journey they embark upon will not only save their planets but also foster an era of unprecedented intergalactic cooperation and technological innovation, turning a potential catastrophe into an opportunity for revolutionary advancements that bridge the cosmos."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Process:  - A larva is born - The caterpillar eats constantly until it grows bigger - The caterpillar starts to form a cocoon around itself - The caterpillar becomes a pupa - After some time the cocoon hatches - And a butterfly is born.  Perturbation hypothesis: suppose plenty of food to eat happens, how will it affect more cocoons hatch.  Does the supposed perturbation have an effect (direct or indirect) on the process?","output":"The process you've described is the life cycle of a butterfly, which includes the following stages: egg, larva (caterpillar), pupa (chrysalis/cocoon), and adult (butterfly). Perturbation Hypothesis: If there is plenty of food available for the caterpillar, will it affect the number of cocoons that hatch? Yes, the availability of food does have a direct effect on the life cycle of a butterfly. When there is an ample food supply for caterpillars, it can impact their survival rate and the number of cocoons formed in several ways: 1. Increased survival rate: Caterpillars rely on leaves and other plant matter as their main food source. If there is plenty of food available, a larger number of caterpillars can survive to the next stage of their life cycle. This leads to a higher number of cocoons being formed. 2. Faster growth: With a sufficient food supply, caterpillars grow more rapidly, as they spend most of their larval stage consuming food to meet their energy needs and fuel their development. This quicker growth potentially increases the number of caterpillars that successfully reach the pupal stage and form cocoons. 3. Larger size and better health: A well-fed caterpillar has a better chance of reaching its full size and optimal health. This plays a vital role in ensuring a successful transition from the larval stage to the pupal stage, resulting in more cocoons being formed. 4. Higher reproduction rates: Butterflies with access to plentiful food resources during their larval stages are more likely to be robust and healthy as adults. This can lead to higher mating success rates and increased egg-laying, which results in a larger number of larvae in the next generation and, eventually, more cocoons. In conclusion, the availability of food has a direct impact on the life cycle of a butterfly. If caterpillars have plenty of food to eat, the butterfly population will generally be healthier, grow faster, and have higher rates of survival and reproduction. This chain of events leads to an increased number of cocoons being formed and a more successful completion of the butterfly life cycle."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Answer: A mill engine from Stott Park Bobbin Mill , Cumbria, England Question: how does a steam engine work Answer:","output":"No, the given answer is not a correct answer to the question \\"How does a steam engine work?\\" A proper answer to the question would be as follows:  Step 1: The fuel (usually coal) is burned in a furnace, which heats water in a boiler, turning it into steam. Step 2: The steam builds up pressure inside the boiler, which is then transferred to a steam chamber, allowing it to escape through a control valve. Step 3: The high-pressure steam enters a cylinder containing a piston. The pressure pushes the piston to one end of the cylinder, converting the potential energy of the steam into mechanical energy via the movement of the piston. Step 4: The piston is connected to a beam or rod, which in turn is connected to a wheel. As the piston moves, it rotates the wheel, creating motion. Step 5: The spent steam exits the cylinder through an exhaust valve and is usually sent to a condenser to be cooled back into water, which can then be reheated by the boiler to create more steam. This makes the process more efficient and conserves water. Step 6: The mechanical energy produced by the steam engine is then used to power machinery, vehicles, or other mechanical devices, such as those used for pumping water, driving trains, or powering industrial equipment."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

There is little point being constantly negative about yourself or your chances in love. This is a bad habit and it deserves to be broken.","output":"To break the cycle of negativity, begin by identifying the thought patterns that contribute to your feelings of depression and self-doubt in your love life. Take note of these thoughts whenever they arise and challenge them with rational counterarguments. For example, if you find yourself thinking, \\"I'll never find love,\\" remind yourself that there are billions of people in the world, and countless opportunities for meaningful connections. It's important to recognize that there is no concrete timeline for love, and it can happen at any moment in your life. Next, focus on building your self-esteem and self-worth. Engage in activities that make you feel accomplished and proud, such as practicing a hobby, learning a new skill, or setting personal goals. Surround yourself with positive and supportive people who encourage and uplift you, rather than bring you down with their own insecurities or negative outlooks. Additionally, practice mindfulness and self-compassion. Be present in the moment and acknowledge your emotions without becoming overwhelmed by them or judging yourself too harshly. Remember that it's okay to feel disappointment or pain when love doesn't work out the way you had hoped—these emotions are natural and valid. What matters most is that you learn from these experiences, grow as an individual, and treat yourself with the kindness you deserve. Another step you can take is to change your perspective on love and relationships. Recognize that happiness and fulfillment can be found in various aspects of your life, not solely in romantic relationships. Embrace being single and use this time to focus on self-improvement, personal interests, and strengthening friendships. By doing this, you'll cultivate a sense of happiness and contentment that doesn't depend on having a partner. If you find yourself ruminating on past relationships or unsuccessful attempts at finding love, remind yourself that each experience was a lesson in disguise. It's important to learn from your past experiences and use them to better understand what you're seeking in a partner—both what works for you and what doesn't—and to continue refining your approach to love.

Think like you are answering to a five year old. By. Jane Fryer. Hermione Norris admits that if she had the money she would go to an American plastic surgeon and get 'the lot' Hermione Norris is looking down at her chest in faux disgust. 'I want my boobs done,' she says, cupping them. 'But I just want them lifted a bit, not implants, and I don't think they do that. And I'd have my thighs tightened because all the muscle and skin tone's gone. 'And I'd have the cellulite shlooshed out of my tummy. And I'd have that wattle thing done, under my neck. 'Oh yes, and hair implants – maybe a hair transplant. If I had the money, I'd go to the best plastic surgeon in America and have the lot. I look all right in my clothes, but underneath I'm a melted candle. You wouldn't want to go there...' It's fair to say that Hermione isn't quite as I'd expected. She looks just like the cool, composed, very middle-class Karen Marsden from Cold Feet, or Spooks' tough Ros Myers, or even DCI Carol Jordan from Wire In The Blood – all sleek, beautifully fitting clothes, discreet jewellery and immaculate skin. But actually she's warm, funny, surprisingly open and brilliantly messy. 'Do you want to see the inside of my bag?' she says, grabbing an enormous soft leather tote. 'Look! There's sand, sweets, salt sachets, pens, drinks, packets of crisps, Lego, plasters. I like to be prepared and I know most things I need for all eventualities are there.' Which is all very interesting, but we're actually here to talk about The Crimson Field – a new BBC1 drama series set in a field hospital in France in the First World War, but filmed in the Cotswolds. Hermione, who's long been fascinated by the war and in her 20s made pilgrimages to the French battlefields, plays stern but compassionate Matron Grace Carter. 'It was very emotional. That level of loss – what must it have done to those poor men? To be a good nurse you'd have to have a level of  detachment. I'd just want to take them home with me. My mother's a nurse, but I couldn't do it.' The cast of Cold Feet- back row, from left, John Thomson, James Nesbitt and Helen Baxendale. Front row- Hermione, Robert Bathurst, Fay Ripley. Her mother sounds more capable than most, single-handedly raising four children after her husband walked out when Hermione was just four. 'I don't know why he left – but I would imagine there was someone else involved, knowing my dad. There were four of us under six. It was really hard for my mum.' And her dad – what was he like? 'Great fun, naughty, charismatic, twinkly... trouble. He made me laugh. I saw him every Sunday. He was good at gifts and going out for nice meals but not the sort of man you should marry.' He died when Hermione was 21. 'It had a profound impact. It was really, really difficult. It was like the removal of a limb.' So Hermione immersed herself in work. 'Suddenly I was at Colchester Theatre, sharing a dressing room with a woman who drank gin out of the bottle and went on and on about her cats.' 'If I had the money, I'd go to the best. plastic surgeon in America and have the lot. I look all right in my. clothes, but underneath I'm a melted candle. You wouldn't want to go. there...' For years she alternated between theatre and anything that paid the bills – walking around shopping centres in a moose outfit and selling double glazing. Until,  in 1997, she was cast in Cold Feet, the cult ITV drama co-starring James Nesbitt, John Thomson, Fay Ripley, Robert Bathurst and Helen Baxendale. The show ran for five series and served as a launch pad for its stars, who at one stage were reputed to be being paid £70,000 each an episode. (She looks a bit blank when I mention the money today, as well she might after saying last month she now shops at Asda because British TV pays such meagre wages.) Much has been made of the differences between the cast over the years – so did they get on at all? 'We were a very eclectic group,' is her careful answer. 'A really different bunch of people. But it worked.' Are any of them still friends? 'I'm. godmother to John Thomson's little girl. And I worked with Robert. recently. And Jimmy's been away in New Zealand doing The Hobbit... With. Jimmy you always knew. I remember a helicopter arriving on set to pick. him up, and John saying, \\"Oh look, there's Jimmy's career taking off,\\" as the rest of us got into a minibus.' Which brings us neatly back to hair transplants and, in passing, Jimmy Nesbitt's very natural-looking new thatch. Hermione as Ros and Richard Armitage as Lucas North in Spooks. 'Jimmy's is amazing. You've got to have the cash to do it really, really well. I'm so pleased for him. As an actor it makes a difference to your castability as well.' So what about Botox? 'I would...' And has she? 'I'm not telling you! If you have surgery, don't speak about it. But I'm not against it, obviously.' It's ironic that while she played the wife with children in Cold Feet, Hermione was the last of the cast to settle down. For years, she found herself attracted to charming but unsuitable men – not unlike her father. Then in 2002, at the age of 35, she met Simon Wheeler, a writer and TV producer, when she was filming Wire In The Blood with Robson Green. They married the same year and now have a son, Wilf, nine, and daughter, Hero, six. 'I just thought, \\"Oh **** it's you!\\" It was very straightforward. He's kind, bright, my best friend.' At 40, he's also seven years younger than her. Is she conscious of the age gap? 'I'm sure as I get older I will be. I need that work done!' The family live in Dorset and, between filming commitments, spend their time watching mostly American DVD box sets. 'I'd absolutely love to be in an American drama, but I couldn't go over there and peddle my wares,' she says. 'I'd want them to come to me and just offer me an amazing part. I'd never have to work again and I'd be able to get my plastic surgery done then. I reckon I'd need about a quarter of a million.' Hermione is brilliant. She may have a tendency to play dauntingly capable women but she's great company. And you never know, one day, if Hollywood does finally come calling she might end up looking rather different. 'I'd see you in a few months and my boobs would be up here and I'd look amazing!' Let's just hope she leaves the hair transplants to James Nesbitt. The Crimson Field starts tomorrow at 9pm on BBC1.

How can open new cell tower over land in India? What is the process to rent a land to host mobile tower in india? Are these two questions inquiring about the same information?","output":"Yes, these two questions are closely related and inquire about similar information - setting up a new cell tower on a piece of land in India and the process of renting the land to host a mobile tower. I will provide a detailed answer addressing both aspects. Setting up a new cell tower on a piece of land and renting land to host a mobile tower in India involve a series of steps, which include regulatory compliance, obtaining necessary permissions, and working with telecom operators or infrastructure providers. The process can be divided into the following stages: 1. Identifying suitable land: The first step is to identify a suitable piece of land that meets the technical requirements for setting up a cell tower. This includes factors such as geographic location, topography, signal coverage, and accessibility. You should conduct a thorough survey to ensure that the selected land is the best possible option for the tower installation. 2. Getting NOC from local authorities: After identifying the suitable land, you will need to obtain a No Objection Certificate (NOC) from the local municipality or urban development authority. This is necessary for legal and safety reasons. The NOC validates that there is no legal hindrance to building a cell tower on the piece of land. 3. Negotiating lease agreements: Once you have received the NOC, you can proceed to negotiate and finalize the lease agreements with the landowner. Typical lease agreements for cell tower installations stipulate the terms and conditions, rights, and responsibilities of both parties. These agreements may include details such as the duration of the lease, rental costs, mechanisms for rent escalation, and provisions for renewal. 4. Partnering with telecom operators or infrastructure providers: After securing the land, you will need to collaborate with telecom operators or tower infrastructure providers. You can approach companies like Indus Towers, Bharti Infratel, or ATC India, which lease space on their towers to multiple telecom operators. You can also directly negotiate with telecom operators like Airtel, Vodafone Idea, or Jio. 5. Obtaining permits and clearances: In addition to the aforementioned NOC, cell tower installations may require several other clearances and permits, such as the Structural Stability Certificate (for the tower's structural soundness), the SACFA (Standing Advisory Committee on Radio Frequency Allocation) clearance, and approval from the Airport Authority of India (AAI) if the proposed tower lies within a specified radius of an airport or an Air Force station. 6. Ensuring safety and compliance with radiation norms: The government of India has stringent guidelines in place for telecom tower radiations. You will need to adhere to the limits prescribed under the Department of Telecommunications (DoT) guidelines and ensure that the cell tower installation is compliant with the prescribed norms. You may be required to obtain a certificate from a certified technical expert attesting to compliance with these guidelines. 7. Construction and installation: Once you have all necessary approvals, permits, and clearances, you can proceed with the construction and installation of the cell tower. This includes engaging experienced contractors and technicians to ensure that the infrastructure is installed safely and efficiently. 8. Maintenance and monitoring: After the successful installation of the cell tower, regular monitoring and maintenance are essential to ensuring uninterrupted connectivity and adherence to safety norms. You will need to coordinate with the telecom operator or infrastructure provider for these services. By following these steps, you can successfully establish a new cell tower over land in India and rent the land to host a mobile tower. This process is crucial to expanding telecommunications infrastructure and providing reliable, high-quality coverage to consumers across the country."},{"instruction":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

Should I validate this answer? Answer:","output":"No, you should not validate the suggested answer as it does not address the original question about the age of Anna Nicole Smith when she met her old husband. Instead, I will provide a detailed answer to the original question. Anna Nicole Smith, born as Vickie Lynn Hogan on November 28, 1967, was an American model, actress, and television personality. She first gained fame in 1993 as the Playboy Playmate of the Year and later became known for her marriage to oil tycoon J. Howard Marshall. Smith met J. Howard Marshall, her elderly husband, in October 1991, while she was performing as a stripper at Gigi's, a nightclub in Houston, Texas. At the time, Anna Nicole Smith was 23 years old, and Marshall was 86 years old. Their relationship began as a friendship, with Marshall often visiting the club and showering her with gifts. Smith eventually became his companion and confidante. The couple married on June 27, 1994, when Anna Nicole was 26 years old, and Marshall was 89 years old. Their marriage was surrounded by media controversy due to the significant age difference between the couple, as well as speculations about her intentions towards Marshall's wealth. Marshall passed away on August 4, 1995, just 13 months after their marriage. This led to a lengthy legal battle between Anna Nicole and Marshall's family over his fortune, which continued after her death. Unfortunately, Anna Nicole Smith passed away on February 8, 2007, due to an accidental overdose of prescription medications. The information about her death does not answer the question about her age when she met her old husband but provides relevant context and additional details about her life."},{"instruction":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

Article: Although people everywhere seem to enjoy drinking coffee, they don't all have the same coffee culture. In Europe, for example, coffee shops are common places for people to meet friends and to talk while they drink coffee. On the other hand, places like this were not as common in North America in the past. Instead, people in North America liked to drink coffee in their homes with friends. The coffee culture in the USA changed when Starbucks  coffee shops spread across the country. The first Starbucks coffee shop opened in 1971 in downtown Seattle, Washington, in the USA. It was a small coffee shop that cooked its own coffee beans. The coffee shop's business did well, and by 1981 there were three Starbucks stores in Seattle. Things really began to change for the company in 1981.That year, Howard Schultz met the three men who _ Starbucks. Schultz worked in New York for a company that made kitchen equipment. He noticed that Starbucks ordered a large number of special coffee makers, which caused his great interest. Schultz went to Seattle to see what Starbucks did. In 1982, the original Starbucks owners hired Schultz as the company's head of marketing . In 1983, Schultz traveled to Italy. The special environment of the espresso( ) bars there caught his eyes. Back in the USA, Schultz created an environment for Starbucks coffee shops that was comfortable and casual, and customers everywhere seemed to like it. Starbucks began opening more stores across the USA. Then the company opened coffee shops in other countries as well. Today, there are more than 16,000 Starbucks coffee shops all over the world. However, that does not mean Starbucks has not had problems. In fact, many Starbucks stores have closed over the past few years. On the one hand, this is because there were too many coffee shops competing for business in one small area. On the other hand, stores in some countries closed because the coffee culture there did not match with the \\"feel the same everywhere\\" environment offered by Starbucks. Question: Why did so many Starbucks close in small areas? Options: A: The coffee in these places was too expensive. B: The style of the coffee stores seems the same. C: People like to drink coffee at home with friends. D: There were too many coffee shops in one place. A:","output":"The correct answer is D: There were too many coffee shops in one place. The article mentions that many Starbucks stores have closed over the past few years because there were too many coffee shops competing for business in one small area. This means that the market was saturated with coffee shops which led to stiff competition and likely affected the sales and profitability of individual Starbucks stores, thus leading to their closure."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Eddie James \\"Son\\" House, Jr. (March 21, 1902 - October 19, 1988) was an American delta blues singer and guitarist, noted for his highly emotional style of singing and slide guitar playing. After years of hostility to secular music, as a preacher and for a few years also as a church pastor, he turned to blues performance at the age of 25. He quickly developed a unique style by applying the rhythmic drive, vocal power and emotional intensity of his preaching to the newly learned idiom. In a short career interrupted by a spell in Parchman Farm penitentiary, he developed to the point that Charley Patton, the foremost blues artist of the Mississippi Delta region, invited him to share engagements and to accompany him to a 1930 recording session for Paramount Records. House was born in the hamlet of Lyon, north of Clarksdale, Mississippi, the second of three brothers, and lived in the rural Mississippi Delta until his parents separated, when he was about seven or eight years old. His father, Eddie House, Sr., was a musician, playing the tuba in a band with his brothers and sometimes playing the guitar. He was a church member but also a drinker; he left the church for a time, on account of his drinking, but then gave up alcohol and became a Baptist deacon. Young Eddie House adopted the family commitment to religion and churchgoing. He also absorbed the family love of music but confined himself to singing, showing no interest in the family instrumental band, and hostile to the blues on religious grounds.  When House's parents separated, his mother took him to Tallulah, Louisiana, across the Mississippi River from Vicksburg, Mississippi. When he was in his early teens, they moved to Algiers, New Orleans. Recalling these years, he would later speak of his hatred of blues and his passion for churchgoing (he described himself as \\"churchy\\" and \\"churchified\\"). At fifteen, probably while living in Algiers, he began preaching sermons.  At the age of nineteen, while living in the Delta, he married Carrie Martin, an older woman from New Orleans. This was a significant step for House; he married in church and against family opposition. The couple moved to her hometown of Centerville, Louisiana, to help run her father's farm. After a couple of years, feeling used and disillusioned, House recalled, \\"I left her hanging on the gatepost, with her father tellin' me to come back so we could plow some more.\\" Around the same time, probably 1922, House's mother died. In later years, he was still angry about his marriage and said of Carrie, \\"She wasn't nothin' but one of them New Orleans whores\\".  House's resentment of farming extended to the many menial jobs he took as a young adult. He moved frequently, on one occasion taking off to East Saint Louis to work in a steel plant. The one job he enjoyed was on a Louisiana horse ranch, which later he celebrated by wearing a cowboy hat in his performances. He found an escape from manual labor when, following a conversion experience (\\"getting religion\\") in his early twenties, he was accepted as a paid pastor, first in the Baptist Church and then in the Colored Methodist Episcopal Church. However, he fell into habits which conflicted with his calling--drinking like his father and probably also womanizing. This led him after several years of conflict to leave the church, ceasing his full-time commitment, although he continued to preach sermons from time to time. Did you learn anything interesting about him?","output":"Yes, I learned about Eddie James \\"Son\\" House, Jr., who was a famous American Delta blues singer and guitarist. He was known for his emotional style of singing and playing the guitar. Even though he grew up in a religious family and became a preacher himself, he later switched to blues music at the age of 25. Son House played with Charley Patton, a great blues musician, and even recorded songs together. He had a complicated life, with struggles in his personal relationships and his feelings towards religion and blues music. Son House was also known for wearing a cowboy hat during his performances because he once enjoyed working on a horse ranch in Louisiana."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

If Google is having trouble stirring up people's passions for tech then why should anyone pay attention to some small semiconductor firm? But PortalPlayer, which filed for its IPO on Aug. 4, bears watching over the next few months. Here's why. PortalPlayer gets most of its business from a Taiwanese company called Inventec. And Inventec is the company that makes this little device that you may have heard -- it's called the iPod. Now do I have your attention? PortalPlayer's processors are the brains and guts of Apple Computer's (AAPL) uber-popular music player. So in a sense, PortalPlayer is like the Intel (INTC) of the iPod. What's more, the company's newest chip, the PP5020, is the first to feature photo-processing capabilities, in addition to audio. That could enable PortalPlayer to expand from the digital music device market into other hot areas of consumer electronics such as camera phones. The PP5020 chips could possibly be used in some sort of camera or video version of the iPod as well, which has been the subject of a fair amount of speculation in tech circles. Apple was unavailable for comment about these rumors. Of course, PortalPlayer, once it starts trading (probably in the fall), has a long list of risks. For one thing, the company is tiny. PortalPlayer reported revenues of just 21 million in 2003. However, sales are ramping up quickly, and through the first six months of 2004, it already has topped last year's total. The company is not profitable either, certainly a red flag for skittish tech investors. The company lost 8 million last year and another 3.3 million in the first half of 2004. But it is worth noting that losses have narrowed during the past few years. PortalPlayer lost 25.3 million in 2001 and 22.5 million in 2002. Also it's not as if PortalPlayer is assured of market dominance just because of its relationship with Apple. PortalPlayer lists chip giants Intel and Texas Instruments (TXN) as competitors.

Multi-choice problem: What is this text about? Select from: a). World; b). Sports; c). Business; d). Science/Tech;","output":"This text is about: b). Sports The text is discussing a situation involving Kevin Brown, who is likely a professional athlete, specifically a baseball player, since the term \\"pinstripes\\" typically refers to the uniforms worn by baseball players, most notably the New York Yankees. Brown is experiencing multiple health challenges in his first year, including an intestinal parasite and lower back pain. The mention of two cortisone shots also indicates that the topic pertains to sports medicine and athlete well-being. In the context of sports, it's crucial for athletes like Brown to maintain good health in order to perform at their best. The fact that he's experiencing these difficulties in his first year suggests that this may be impacting his performance on the field. Sports fans and commentators might take an interest in this topic because it can directly affect a team's success. To delve deeper into the topic, Kevin Brown's experience with an intestinal parasite may have impacted his physical health, energy levels, and strength, potentially resulting in missed games or reduced effectiveness on the field. Intestinal parasites are organisms that can enter the body through contaminated food or water, and they can cause various symptoms in their host, ranging from mild to severe. In Brown's case, he had to deal with the parasite for two months, possibly affecting his ability to train and compete at the highest level. Additionally, the lower back pain that prompted two cortisone shots could also severely hinder Brown's performance. Lower back pain can be a common issue for professional athletes, particularly in sports like baseball that involve repetitive motions and stress on the spine. For a baseball player, back pain can affect the swing, pitch delivery, and general mobility on the field. Cortisone shots are often administered to reduce inflammation and alleviate pain temporarily. However, they may not address the root cause of the issue, which may require further medical intervention and rehabilitation. In summary, this text is about sports – specifically a professional baseball player, Kevin Brown, who is experiencing significant health challenges during his first year in pinstripes. Understanding the impact of these health issues on Brown's performance is important for sports enthusiasts and analysts, as it can influence the team dynamics and overall success."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant. You will be given a task. You must generate a detailed and long answer. Trying on a firefighter's helmet, allowing a young boy to hug his leg during a mass and phoning up his followers for a chat are just a few of the ways Pope Francis has attracted headlines in the last few months. And after years of negative press, the Catholic Church is basking in the 'Francis Effect' which has been credited with a 20 per cent rise in congregations in Britain, and similar boosts around the world. But who is the PR guru working quietly behind the scenes to help push Pope Francis forward and leading the Church out of one of its darkest spells following a slew of recent scandals? Mr","output":"Greg Burke, an American public relations expert, has been instrumental in helping Pope Francis reshape the Catholic Church's image. As a PR guru, he has worked tirelessly to rebuild trust and improve the Church's reputation, especially in the wake of numerous scandals that had tarnished its image. As the senior communications adviser to the Vatican under Pope Francis, Burke's role has been to advise the Pope and the Vatican on media strategy and messaging.  Born in St. Louis, Missouri, in 1959, Burke is a member of the conservative Catholic group Opus Dei. He has been a journalist for more than three decades, with experience at various prestigious media outlets, including Time magazine, Fox News, and The National Catholic Register. His journalistic background and expertise in media have provided him with a unique skill set to navigate the challenges of the modern media landscape and handle sensitive issues related to the Church. Burke’s approach to communication has been heavily focused on transparency and direct interactions with the public. Under his guidance, Pope Francis has engaged in numerous public gestures that humanize him and make him more relatable to the masses, such as taking selfies with pilgrims, washing the feet of prisoners, and embracing children with disabilities during papal audiences. These acts have broad appeal and capture the essence of Pope Francis' desire for a more humble, compassionate, and inclusive Church. As a result, the Pope has become a popular figure around the globe and people from different faiths feel a renewed connection to the Catholic Church. Moreover, Burke stresses the importance of social media in reaching out to the younger generation. Pope Francis has an active presence on platforms such as Twitter and Instagram, with millions of followers. These social media accounts allow the Pope to share messages of hope, peace, and love while also addressing pressing global issues, thus significantly broadening his reach and impact on people's lives. Another critical aspect of Burke's strategy has been to address the Church's internal issues both openly and proactively. This involves acknowledging the mistakes of the past, such as the clergy abuse scandal, and implementing meaningful changes to prevent such incidents from occurring again. The Pope, under Burke's guidance, has shown an unwavering commitment towards transparency and healing, promoting measures like the establishment of a special commission to protect minors and the removal of high-ranking officials involved in cover-ups. Despite all the challenges that the Catholic Church has faced in the past, the rise of Pope Francis has been a breath of fresh air to many believers, and much credit goes to the Church's quiet PR guru, Greg Burke. Through his expert handling of media and communication, he has managed to help the Pope and the Church rise above recent controversies, regain public trust, and ultimately bring millions back into the fold. The 'Francis Effect' has breathed new life into Catholicism, with increased congregations and renewed faith around the world, all thanks to the work of Mr. Burke and his dedication to the Church's mission and image."},{"instruction":"User will you give you a task with some instruction.

Found as an infant on the doorstep of Charles' family home, she was taken in by Charles' kind-hearted parents - Edward and Margaret. These two loving souls raised Eliza as their own daughter, providing her with a warm, nurturing home full of love, support, and a deep sense of belonging. Unbeknownst to Eliza, Charles, their biological son, has always been curious about his sister's obscured past. The movie begins with Eliza and Charles as young adults, navigating life, love, and dreams. Eliza is a talented artist and runs a successful gallery with her best friend, while Charles is a budding journalist who is haunted by the unsolved mystery surrounding his sister's past. When Edward becomes severely ill, Margaret finally reveals the secret she kept for all these years. Through her emotional confession, we learn that a mysterious letter was found with the infant Eliza, indicating that her biological parents belonged to a prominent, wealthy family with a dark secret they wanted to protect. With Edward's encouragement, Margaret had buried the letter in the hope that Eliza would be given a clean slate and a stable upbringing, unencumbered by the darkness that cloaked her origins. Charles, inspired by the revelation and driven by a desire to unravel the truth for his sister, embarks on a journey to find the answers that have eluded them for so long. As Charles digs deeper, he encounters a series of clues, testimonies, and old acquaintances that reveal a complex web of relationships and lies surrounding Eliza's origins. His determination takes him through forgotten towns, abandoned mansions, and ancient graveyards, unveiling a story full of melancholy, betrayal, heartache, and unexpected alliances. Meanwhile, Eliza, who is kept in the dark about her brother's mission, continues her art career, finding love, while grappling with a gnawing sense of incompleteness that lingers in her heart. The climax of the story occurs when Charles eventually uncovers a shocking family connection that shakes the very foundation of Eliza's identity. As the truth surfaces, he hesitates and reflects on the consequences of revealing this newfound knowledge to his sister. Edward, on his deathbed, imparts a parting piece of wisdom to Charles, reminding him that the bonds formed by love matter more than bloodlines and that the life Eliza had built, surrounded by her loving family and friends, held more value than any plot twist from her past. In the end, Charles decides to let the past lie, ultimately choosing to protect Eliza's human connections and her love-filled existence over the pursuit of her uncertain heritage. The siblings come together at Edward's funeral, holding each other tightly, as Eliza clings to hope amidst the unanswered questions. The sealed letter, now in Charles' possession, is never opened, symbolizing that one's true family is not always defined by blood but by the bonds of unconditional love.

University Although the initial focus of the humanist scholars in the university was the discovery, exposition and insertion of ancient texts and languages into the university, and the ideas of those texts into society generally, their influence was ultimately quite progressive. The emergence of classical texts brought new ideas and led to a more creative university climate (as the notable list of scholars above attests to). A focus on knowledge coming from self, from the human, has a direct implication for new forms of scholarship and instruction, and was the foundation for what is commonly known as the humanities. This disposition toward knowledge manifested in not simply the translation and propagation of ancient texts, but also their adaptation and expansion. For instance, Vesalius was imperative for advocating the use of Galen, but he also invigorated this text with experimentation, disagreements and further research. The propagation of these texts, especially within the universities, was greatly aided by the emergence of the printing press and the beginning of the use of the vernacular, which allowed for the printing of relatively large texts at reasonable prices. Q: A concentration on the study of the self resulted in what field of study?","output":"A concentration on the study of the self and the focus on knowledge coming from humans resulted in the field of study known as the humanities. The humanities encompass a wide range of disciplines that examine human culture, history, philosophy, literature, and art, among others.

Select the topic that this about: MANNHEIM, Germany - A military judge hearing evidence about the alleged abuse of prisoners at Iraq's Abu Ghraib prison pressed the U.S. government Monday to speed up its investigation, warning that delays could derail the case against at least one of the accused soldiers...","output":"The topic of discussion here is the alleged abuse of prisoners at Iraq's Abu Ghraib prison and the subsequent investigation and legal proceedings involving accused American soldiers. In this context, the military judge has urged the U.S. government to expedite the investigation process to ensure that the case against the accused soldiers proceeds without any hindrances. The location mentioned, Mannheim, Germany, likely refers to the venue of the military court hearing. Abu Ghraib prison, located near Baghdad, Iraq, became infamous in 2004 when images of U.S. military personnel abusing and torturing Iraqi prisoners were made public. These horrifying images and reports of gross human rights violations sparked international outrage and raised questions about the treatment of prisoners during the Iraq War, which was led by the United States and its allies. The prison scandal brought to light a dark chapter in the U.S. military's conduct in Iraq and led to a series of investigations, legal proceedings, and reforms. The military judge's plea for expediting the investigation highlights the urgency and importance of bringing the individuals involved in the alleged abuse to justice. A slow or inefficient investigation process could result in the loss of vital evidence or the weakening of the case against the accused soldiers. Furthermore, delays in the legal process can lead to further negative ramifications, such as loss of public trust in the military and the government's ability to enforce justice and ensure accountability. This is particularly crucial as the United States and other nations involved in the Iraq War have repeatedly emphasized their commitment to upholding human rights and the rule of law. Investigating the allegations of abuse at Abu Ghraib and holding accountable those responsible sends a strong message about the values the U.S. military and its government stand for. Furthermore, it helps to rebuild the image and credibility of the United States in the international community, particularly in the eyes of the Iraqi people, who suffered from grave human rights violations during the conflict.  Efficient and transparent investigations and legal proceedings can also serve as a deterrent to future acts of abuse and misconduct by armed forces, not only in the United States but also in other nations. As the onus of upholding human rights and the rule of law falls upon every nation, ensuring that justice is served in cases of prisoner abuse is crucial for maintaining international standards of justice and human rights protection. In conclusion, the topic discussed in this excerpt revolves around the alleged prisoner abuse at Iraq's Abu Ghraib prison and the necessity for a swift investigation and legal proceedings against the accused American soldiers. The military judge's request for expedition highlights the relevance of timely justice, the importance of enforcing accountability, and the need for upholding human rights and the rule of law in the domain of armed conflict."},{"instruction":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

Please briefly summarize this news article: Hers - A CHILD HAS HER FIRST BRUSH WITH 'CRIME' - NYTimes.com ICOMMITTED my first white-collar crime in second grade. Like many white-collar criminals, I persist in believing that I acted for an honorable cause and that the lessons crime taught me were not necessarily the ones society would have me learn. Things began innocently enough. A priest bearing a stack of magazines and some charts came to every classroom in the school. ''Mission magazines,'' he explained. In their pulp pages nurse-nuns battled fierce bacteria in steaming jungles and brave priests struggled to persuade cannibals to look for new sources of protein. This was edge-of-the-seat stuff in our far-north Michigan town, which was so small and isolated that coins never showed up until the year after the dates on their faces. The charts that came with the magazines were for fund raising. They had thermometers printed on them, like the United Way thermometers that sprout every year on courthouse lawns. At the top was a goal of 5, and the thermometer's ''degrees'' were marked in nickels. ''Pagan babies,'' the priest told us. Each 5 would buy one pagan baby. The money would feed the baby and, more important, would guarantee that the baby would be baptized and thereby rescued from spending eternity in limbo. Because our second grade was such a special class, the priest said, he brought two thermometers. He could tell we were sacrificing and persevering enough to save two pagan babies. He suggested we make a contest of it; the boys could race the girls to 5. The impropriety of buying babies never occurred to me, nor did I grasp the ethnocentric hauteur of a concept like ''pagan'' babies. I just wanted to help. I was unnerved by the magazine pictures of children swollen with hunger - I who never felt like cleaning my plate. The boys-against-girls contest appealed to my sense of urgency in the matter. And, I admit, to my basest competitive instincts. My first thought was that the girls slightly outnumbered the boys. If we worked fast we could win. But when the priest asked who would make the first contribution, I began to see what we were up against. Pockets, for one thing. Little boys have four pockets in their pants and two in their shirts, and one thing they carry in them is money. (None of the girls would have purses until spring, when we made our first communion and needed them for regulation religious equipment like rosaries.) Not one girl had money. Mrs. Davey, our teacher, colored the first red degrees on the boys' thermometer. Undaunted, I went home for lunch and told my mother about the pagan babies. She said I could take a nickel. I supposed that every girl was home doing the same and our thermometer would soar past the boys'. For lunch we'd had egg-salad sandwiches -one of the few things I liked - and it pleased me to think the pagan babies would soon be having egg salad, too. I ran back to school and forced my nickel upon Mrs. Davey. She announced that everyone who had brought money for pagan babies should go stand by the thermometers. To my amazement almost no one went. It was a big class, a postwar bumper crop of 60, but there were only five of us at the thermometers. Didn't the rest of them care? Didn't they know that the bloated stomachs and inside-out navels in those horrible photographs belonged to real children? Worst of all, only one other girl gave money. From the back of the room the thermometers burned into me all afternoon: 48 cents boys, 10 cents girls. During recess I did some lobbying. The pagan babies would die without our money for food, I pointed out, and because they hadn't been baptized they couldn't go to heaven. It would be our fault. But nobody believed it. Africa and Asia seemed unimaginably far away, starvation even farther. At home I told my mother what had happened and asked if I could take a dollar. She said another nickel. When I accused her of being just one more person who didn't care about pagan babies, she said the fund raising was a class project and the whole class should chip in. Contributions dribbled in for the next few days. Finally, after Mrs. Davey plugged the enterprise, the girls went into action. One day we even took the lead - 3.42 girls, 3.39 boys. Here was the glorious proof of what I'd known all along: girls could beat boys. Then Robert stepped forward with 50 cents. This was the greatest philanthropy we'd seen, and someone asked where he'd gotten the money. His paper route, he said. My pride blew away like a dead leaf in a cold wind.After school I told my mother I needed a paper route. She said paper boys were like altar boys -they were always boys. It wasn't fair, she agreed, but she doubted that we could change the world before the pagan baby campaign ended. If only my father were home. He wouldn't let me be beaten by Robert's paper route. But he worked on a ship on the Great Lakes and would be away for days. Besides, it seemed demeaning to ask for money now that I knew Robert earned his. Imagine having money to spend however you wanted, with no need to account to anyone! I racked my brain to think how I might acquire the same freedom, but because the pagan babies needed help fast, all my thoughts came back to a single possibility: crime. Stealing was a sin, of course, but how could it be wrong to steal for pagan babies? That night while my mother gave my little sister a bath I took 40 cents from her wallet. To avoid suspicion at school, I gave half in the morning, half in the afternoon. Mrs. Davey didn't ask any questions. The most interesting thing about crime was that it was so easy. Over the weekend everybody seemed to forget about pagan babies, and in the days that followed contributions tapered off to almost nothing. I kept bringing nickels, quietly, in the hope that Robert wouldn't notice that the girls were catching up. But he did. He loved playing the last tycoon, waiting until everyone else had given money, then fishing in his pockets and counting out just what was needed to put the boys ahead. I stole only once more for the pagan babies. I gave it up not out of guilt or fear but because I sensed that Robert would always come up with more than I could steal. And once I understood the impossibility of winning, I wanted to lose as invisibly as possible. I didn't want Robert to have the faintest idea the contest mattered to me. After the boys won, I tuned out. I don't know how long it took the girls to finish buying their pagan baby. I was preoccupied with dreams of the day when I would be big enough to rake leaves or babysit so I would never again know the humiliations suffered by women of dependent means. Summary:","output":"The article recounts the author's experience with her first \\"white-collar crime\\" in second grade when a priest came to their school to raise funds for \\"pagan babies\\" – an initiative aimed at supporting impoverished children in other countries. A contest was set between boys and girls in the class, with a goal of raising 5 each. The author became determined to help the girls win the contest but found it challenging as boys had more access to money, such as through paper routes. She eventually resorted to stealing money from her mother's wallet to enhance the girls' funding. Despite her efforts, the boys won the contest. The author reflects on her actions and the experience, realizing the unfairness that existed and dreaming of a time when she would be self-sufficient and free from such humiliation."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Please answer the following question: Process: - Magma comes up to the surface of the earth - The magma cools - Particles inside the magma move closer together - Crystals are formed - The crystals contain minerals.  Question: suppose A volcano is inactive happens, how will it affect less crystals are formed.  - A: more - B: less - C: no effect A:","output":"B: less When a volcano becomes inactive, it means that there is no eruption taking place, and hence, no new magma is rising to the surface of the Earth. The process of crystal formation is directly related to the cooling and solidification of magma. Therefore, if a volcano is inactive and not producing fresh magma, there will be fewer opportunities for magma to cool on or near the Earth's surface, and ultimately form crystals. To provide a more comprehensive understanding, let's look at the crystal formation process that occurs when a volcano is active: 1. Magma generation: Magma is generated by the partial melting of the Earth's mantle or crust, primarily due to changes in temperature, pressure, or the introduction of water. In the case of an active volcano, magma is continuously being produced, creating a constant source of fresh material for crystal formation. 2. Magma ascent: When magma is generated deep within the Earth, buoyancy forces and tectonic processes drive it to rise toward the surface. As it ascends, the magma may encounter regions of lower pressure that can cause it to further expand, increasing the likelihood of a volcanic eruption. 3. Eruption and magma cooling: If an eruption occurs, the magma is expelled from the Earth's surface or near-surface conduits, forming a lava flow or pyroclastic material. Regardless of the specific eruptive style, the magma is suddenly exposed to much cooler atmospheric conditions, triggering the cooling and solidification process. 4. Crystal formation: As the magma cools and solidifies, the particles within it move closer together, and the mineral components begin to crystallize according to their particular melting points. The resulting crystals grow in size as cooling continues, incorporating various elements that were present in the magma. Different minerals and crystal forms can emerge, depending on the magma's composition and cooling rate. Now, let's consider the situation where a volcano becomes inactive. In this case, the generation of fresh magma stops, so there is no new material to be cooled and crystallized on or near the Earth's surface. Consequently, fewer crystals will form overall. Moreover, any pre-existing crystals and volcanic rocks on the surface of the Earth will gradually be weathered and eroded, which will decrease the local abundance of crystalline material even further. So, in conclusion, an inactive volcano will indeed result in fewer crystals being formed due to the lack of fresh magma and subsequent cooling that would otherwise facilitate crystal growth."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

While performing the task think step-by-step and justify your steps. On September 18, date of the Scottish referendum, something infinitely less seismic is happening that is nonetheless of quiet importance to the parish of British tennis. As Scottish residents cast their votes, the draw for next year's Davis Cup World Group will take place and, for the domestic game and its key player Andy Murray, those two things could be very much interlinked. In response to a question about the Rio Olympics Murray said last week that, in the event of the Yes vote, he 'assumed' he would be playing for Scotland, but a deeper look into the matter shows it may be less straightforward than anyone – including Murray himself – might think. Team GB: Murray has an impressive Davis Cup record for Great Britain, winning 19 of his 21 singles matches. In fact, such are the uncertainties that tennis and other sports are trying to grapple with, that one many eventual scenarios if separation happens could even be that he continues to play for GB in the Davis Cup while turning out for Scotland in Rio. Such is the confusion associated with the increasingly likely outcome of a Yes vote that, in tennis, it has become the subject that nobody wants to talk about. Murray's endorsement may be the glittering prize for either side of the independence argument but, understandably in some ways, he continues to tiptoe around it as the implications are considerable for the reigning Sports Personality of the Year. It is not just him anxious to avoid discussion. Lawn Tennis Association Chief Executive Michael Downey is another to have stayed determinedly uncommitted on the issue. Tennis Scotland are desperate to remain neutral, despite it being massively important to the future of the game north of the border. Broader governing body The International Tennis Federation restricts itself to setting out procedural elements in the event of a Yes vote. Option? Davis Cup captain Leon Smith (right) might not be able to pick Andy Murray for his side in the future. Part of the reason is that there would be no meaningful precedent if Scotland breaks away. According to one official, the only comparable scenario is the recent secession of South Sudan from Sudan (the former Yugoslavia is not an equivalent as, unlike GB, it ceased to exist). While Sudan does have a national tennis association, and competed in the Davis Cup up to 2001, war-torn South Sudan has got infinitely more important things to consider than setting up sporting administrations in the new country. In the UK tennis, a completely integrated sport with no meaningful history of Scotland competing separately, is an interesting study of the difficulties and fears affecting sports north of the border with the possibility of independence, especially those that supply Olympic teams. Scotland is affiliated to the LTA in the same way that, say, Yorkshire or Lancashire are, and Tennis Scotland receives a basic grant of £800,000 annually from the centre plus support for athletes and facilities. The Independence white paper is thin on detail about how and when this kind of money would be replaced. In the seductive Socialist utopia promised by the SNP, in which public spending will go up while things like corporation tax goes down, there are assurances that funding levels for world class sport will survive a schism with the south. Big question: LTA Chief Executive Michael Downey must formulate a plan to find the next Andy Murray. David Marshall, Chief Executive of Tennis Scotland, is among those reluctant to be drawn about the myriad implications, but admitted 'The honest position just now is that there will be a lot of negotiations and decisions in the event of a Yes vote that are impossible to predict, and sport is unlikely to be at the top of the pile. 'There are a lot of unknowns which make it impossible to have a clear idea of what is going to happen. It seems a waste of money to get legal advice about what could be when there are so many unknowns in the situation. It will be different for each sport.' One possible outcome that has been discussed among various Olympic sport is that what may emerge for some is a compromise along the lines of what happens for some sports in Ireland, which have remained united even though Eire is a separate sovereign nation. Gold: The Scot represented Team GB at the London 2012 Olympics, winning a Gold and Silver medal. Some governing bodies are extremely sceptical about whether legal and constitutional issues could be solved in time to allow a separate Scotland to compete at Rio 2016, something that would affect the ex Wimbledon champion among others. Sir Craig Reedie, vice-president of the IOC, is the latest to point this out. A tennis team is logistically far easier to organise than, say, rowing or sailing. Yet an idea of how complex Olympic entry could be in the case of tennis comes with the dry-as-dust response of a spokesperson for the ITF (which runs the sport at the Olympics) to inquiries about how an independent Scotland would proceed after a theoretical split from the LTA. Here goes: 'In order to take part in any ITF team competition a nation has to be a 'Class B' member. A National Tennis Association may apply for membership of the ITF in accordance with the ITF Constitution. In order to apply for membership a National Association must first be a member of the Regional Tennis Association (a low profile body called Tennis Europe in Scotland's case) and in the case of Class B members, a member of the National Olympic Committee or a member state of the United Nations. All memberships must be approved at the ITF Annual General Meeting.' Doubles triumph: Murray teamed up with Laura Robson to win Silver in the mixed doubles at London 2012. To summarise, that suggests a tricky number of hurdles would need to be cleared in a short period for Olympic participation, at a time when sport would hardly be at the top of a new Scottish government's in-tray with so many more important matters to be sorted out. It is also ITF policy that a player can represent who he or she wants providing they have the requisite passport from that nation – and who gets to hold which passport will be among the thorniest issues to sort out in the event of a Yes vote. You can see why highly focussed athletes do not want to get involved in this kind of minutiae, and also why potential Olympians north of the border might be concerned, given all the possible outcomes and funding implications. It is also easy to understand why Murray, his family and the likes of close friend Sir Chris Hoy are very keen not to become embroiled in a campaign getting more heated and unpleasant the nearer polling day comes. They are part of what might be termed the fearful undeclared. If they were to come out on the No side they will be subject to the vicious attacks of the 'Cybernats' and other pro-independence supporters. If they were to express a view in favour of a Yes vote it would open them up to charges of being anti-English, and doubtless unsettle commercial sponsors as well. This is a particularly sensitive time for the former Wimbledon champion in that regard, as his main apparel contract with adidas is due for renewal on January 1. Negotiations are ongoing with them and others who might wish to sign him with its worth likely to be in the region of £3 million per year, give or take performance clauses. Breakthrough: The Scot's straight sets win over Roger Federer handed Murray the 2012 Olympic Gold medal. The Wimbledon champion has reason to be particularly cautious, given the hysterical reaction to some harmless joshing with his friend Tim Henman about supporting football teams eight years ago that is still held against him by some to this day. The day after his triumph as SW19 last year, when he would have been feeling indestructible, Murray declared that he would have to say something on independence. He has subsequently thought better of it, given the highly emotive reactions the subject draws, but anyone who knows him will be sure that he will have a view, given his intellectual curiosity and fondness for a debate about most things. The nearest he has come to publicly expressing a view was in March last year, when he said in an interview with the Times magazine: 'I don't think you should judge the thing on emotion, but on what is best economically for Scotland. You don't want to come to a snap decision and then see the country go tits up. 'I am proud to be Scottish, but I am also proud to be British. I don't think there is any contradiction in that.' Passionate: David Cameron and Alex Salmond celebrate Andy Murray winning Wimbledon in 2013. More recently he has pointed out that his view has little relevance because, as a longstanding resident of Surrey, he does not have a vote. But there have been hints of his thinking, such as criticising Alex Salmond for unfurling a Saltire in Wimbledon's Royal Box last year. In the past expressed his admiration for staunch 'No' supporter Gordon Brown, and does not give the impression of being a great enthusiast for independence. His private and professional connections make a nonsense of any suggestions that he is in some way anti-English, and he has never shied from wrapping himself in the Union Jack or made a secret of his pride in representing Great Britain. Patriotic: Murray returned to his hometwon Dunblane after his successes at the London 2012 Olympics. It was notable that after London 2012 he declined to appear at the parade of Scottish Olympians in Glasgow but made his own personal visit to his hometown of Dunblane. Yet it should be stressed that none of the country's first tennis family have publicly made their views clear, including brother Jamie and mother Judy. In the case of the latter, who is Captain of Great Britain's Fed Cup team, a few clues can be gleaned from her highly active Twitter feed. She used to follow the SNP account, although stopped doing that prior to getting the GB job. Last week she retweeted a picture of her holding a Saltire-patterned fan that was accompanied by a (lighthearted) suggestion that she was a fan of independence. Like everything else connected with this very complex issue, it will all most likely become clearer after September 18, although perhaps not for some considerable time, possibly not for years.

To track down a dangerous enemy hiding in the vast Arizona desert, they must rely on their courage, resourcefulness, and the unexpected help from a seemingly ordinary jeep. Story: In the small town of Spirit Falls, Arizona, the Apache people's sacred and heavily-guarded artifact, the Thunderbird Eye, gets stolen under the cover of night. The whole community is shocked, and the tribal elders scramble to figure out who the thief might be. To protect their cultural heritage, the Apache community decides to form a group to search for the artifact. Their team comprises Alex, a spirited tribal member; Jessica, a daring archaeologist; and Jake, a former law enforcement officer. As they embark on their quest, the trio finds a mysterious jeep abandoned near the edge of the town. The vehicle is without a driver and has no apparent owner, but it seems to be guiding the team to their next destination. Uncertain at first, the group decides to trust the jeep, eventually calling it Apache. As the adventure ensues, Apache demonstrates excellent off-road capabilities, helping the group overcome various obstacles like dangerous terrain, extreme weather, and unexpected ambushes by the culprits. The allies discover that the theft of the Thunderbird Eye is the work of a merciless criminal organization that seeks ancient artifacts to harness their supernatural powers. With Apache's help, the team finally locates the enemy's hideout in a remote canyon. In the climactic battle, the group faces off against the criminal leader, a notorious artifact collector named Silas. The Apache tribe, alerted by the bravery of Alex's team, arrives just in time to support them in this battle. During the confrontation, it is revealed that the spirit of a legendary Apache warrior who once protected the artifact infuses the jeep. The warrior's spirit, now channeled through Apache, aids the team in incapacitating Silas and his henchmen, helping them to successfully recover the Thunderbird Eye. In the end, the town celebrates the return of the precious artifact, and the unlikely heroes are hailed as the saviors of their community. Apache, the enchanted jeep, returns to its regular form but will always have a special connection with its riders. \\"Riders of the Apache\\" is a thrilling action-adventure tale that showcases the loyalty and determination of a diverse group of individuals and a supernatural entity working together in the face of adversity.

America's third biggest carrier is being slammed online for violently dragging a passenger - a 69-year-old Asian man, believed to be a doctor - off an overbooked flight. This comes just weeks after the company, whose slogan is \\"Fly the Friendly Skies\\", was ridiculed for refusing to allow two teenage girls to board a flight because they were wearing leggings. Chief executive Oscar Munoz added more fuel to the fire with his response, which didn't mention the use of force. \\"This is an upsetting event to all of us here at United. I apologize for having to re-accommodate these customers,\\" he said in a statement. But Mr Munoz also sent an email to employees calling the passenger, who was pictured with a bloodied face, \\"disruptive and belligerent\\". The Twitterverse quickly responded. United, which made 2.3bn (Â£1.85bn) in profit last year, isn't alone in the PR disasters club. Delta Airlines has cancelled thousands of flights since Wednesday because of severe weather. It's not the first time. Delta chief executive Ed Bastian was forced to apologise after thousands of flights were delayed and cancelled due to a computer bug and power failure last August. In February, Sikh-American actor Waris Ahluwalia was barred from boarding an Aeromexico flight because he refused to remove his turban during a security check. The airline later apologised. And Southwest Airlines flew into a PR storm in 2010 after US filmmaker Kevin Smith was kicked off a flight after being told he was too big to fly. He ended his boycott of the airline six years later. So how could United have handled the situation better? John Bailey is a specialist in crisis communications and has handled public relations for many of the aviation industry's biggest players, including Malaysia Airlines following the disappearance of MH370. \\"Any airline which allows its employees the discretion to take this kind of heavy-handed action against a paying customer is asking for trouble,\\" he says. \\"Every other passenger on that aircraft was a potential citizen journalist. What's astonishing is that United responded so poorly to an absolutely predictable reputational risk. \\"But businesses generally are struggling to adapt to the new communications landscape. Research suggests that it takes companies an average of 21 hours to issue meaningful external communications in a crisis situation, leaving them open to 'trial by Twitter'.\\" Wes Finley, a US marketer working at Facebook, said the United video went viral so quickly because \\"everyone could relate to the frustration the doctor felt at being involuntarily booted\\". \\"Last week's widespread cancellations by Delta also left a lot of people with a hostile attitude to airline travel,\\" he adds. Joseph Barratt, chief executive of Mutant Communications, says the incident was handled \\"incredibly poorly at almost every level\\". \\"From the brutality of the man's removal, to the CEO's response, which contradicted itself and was essentially a non-apology - it's truly difficult to see what United Airlines' communications strategy is hoping to achieve, or whether they have one at all. \\"It is also a reminder for brands that issuing a timely statement that acknowledges the error and shows remorse, while staying consistent both internally and externally is essential. \\"Assuming that an internal letter to employees in a company as large as United Airlines will stay private was a big mistake. Their casual disregard for their customers does seem to stress an opportunity for other brands to step into the market.\\" Ironically, United's CEO Oscar Munoz was named PR communicator of the year by a trade publication last month. PR Week called him \\"a smart, dedicated, and excellent leader who understands the value of communications\\". The award was made before the overbooking and leggings incidents. One would assume he is unlikely to win any more such accolades anytime soon. United's Facebook page apology has drawn thousands of angry comments, including calls for the passenger to sue. US authorities are also looking into the matter, with the Department of Transportation saying it \\"remains committed to protecting the rights of consumers\\". But will all the online outrage about United's behaviour and response, which has led to a hashtag of #boycottUnited, actually damage the airline's bottom line? Well, its reputation has undeniably taken a severe blow. The story has gone viral around the world, including on Chinese social media site Weibo. But pundits say it is hard to put a monetary value on reputational damage. Look at Samsung, for example. The tech giant has just reported a stellar profit forecast despite facing corruption allegations and the embarrassment of exploding phones. Aviation analysts also believe demand for its flights are likely to be unaffected by the incident. The markets seem to be less sure though. United Continental shares dropped 4% on Tuesday.

We were upgraded to a casita, because of rewards points. Great for our family of 5, super close to pool and clean.  Not a posh. Resort but not. What we needed with kids 12, 11 and 9. Not crowded at pool. Although the casita could totally have a kitchenette it does not, just has small wet bar sink, fridge (small) and microwave. So we brought our toaster oven, paper plates and utensils, just so we didn't have to eat out 3x per day for a week.  It met our needs perfectly, we had a car so we could go find other fun things to do around Phoenix otherwise it may have gotten a little boring for a whole week. Agree with other reviewers pool is a pool with slow slow slow lazy river and slide.....not a waterpark and there are no lifeguards.

He had to produce a report for the coming annual meeting. This year he is thinking about a report with some lifestyle suggestions for middle adulthood population. To make it easier to understand the needs of middle adulthood population he would compare it with a group who are in their twenties. He labeled the first group as group A; and the latter group as group B.  But I can use this background: Middle adulthood lasts from the mid-30s to the mid-60s. During this stage of life, many people raise a family and strive to attain career goals. They start showing physical signs of aging, such as wrinkles and gray hair. Typically, vision, strength and reaction time start declining. Diseases such as type 2 diabetes, cardiovascular or heart disease, and cancer are often diagnosed during this stage of life. These diseases are also the chief causes of death in middle adulthood.  What is an answer for this question: Would group B have faster or slower reaction time than group A? Answer:","output":"To answer the question \\"Would group B have faster or slower reaction time than group A?\\", first let's understand the characteristics of each group: Group A: Middle adulthood population (mid-30s to mid-60s) - Raise family and attain career goals - Show physical signs of aging (wrinkles, gray hair) - Decline in vision, strength, and reaction time - Increased risk of type 2 diabetes, heart disease, and cancer Group B: Population in their twenties - Not mentioned explicitly in the background, but generally considered a younger, more physically fit population than middle adulthood Based on the information given, we can conclude that Group B (population in their twenties) would likely have a faster reaction time compared to Group A (middle adulthood population). This is because Group A experiences a decline in reaction time as one of the characteristics of aging, while there's no indication that Group B undergoes significant decline in reaction time during this stage of their lives."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Article: If you go to Finland, you'll be surprised to find how \\"foolish\\" the Finnish people are. Take the taxi drivers for example. Taxis in Finland are mostly high class Benz with a fare   of two US dollars a kilometer. You can go anywhere in one, tell the driver to drop you at any place, say that you have some business to attend to, and then get off without paying your fare. And the driver would not show the least sign of worry. The dining rooms in all big hotels not only serve their guests, but also outside diners. Hotel guests have their meals free, so their good faith is to wave their registration card to the waiter. With such a loose check, you can easily use any old registration card to take a couple of friends and dine free of charge. With so many loopholes   in everyday life, surely Finland must be a heaven to those who love to take \\"pretty advantages\\". But the strange things is, all the taxi-passengers would always come back to pay their fare after they have attended to their business; not a single outsider has ever been found in the free hotel dining rooms. As the Finns always act on good faith and always show an attitude of \\"which is which\\" and \\"what is what\\" in everything they do, so to live in such a society has turned everyone into a real \\"gentleman\\". In a society of such high moral practice, what need is there for people to take precautions   against others?

Summarize this article: A reality competition series based on the movie “Mr. and Mrs. Smith,” in which Brad Pitt and Angelina Jolie starred, is in the works.      3 Ball Entertainment and New Regency, which produced the original 2005 movie, are teaming to develop and produce a reality game-competition version of the feature film.      Fittingly, in the vein of secret assassins, details are highly confidential, but the show will feature married couples that compete in a high-octane, high-stakes game that offers a twist on the TV competition format, producers say.      The box office hit, which brought in nearly 500 million worldwide, revolved around a married couple (Pitt and Jolie) who discover they are both assassins hired by competing agencies to kill each other.      Todd A. Nelson and Brant Pinvidic will serve as exec producers on the series for 3 Ball Entertainment. ||||| There's something about a good game show that just reels us in. Although, we admit, sometimes the guest makes it more than the host.      As game shows rose to popularity in the '70s and '80s, a lot of the good ideas for them got taken. And then came the really \\"out there\\" ideas (although in America, we have yet to match the weirdness of the Japanese game show where the guests chew the furniture to see if it's chocolate).      If you've never heard of the ones of this list, bless your heart, because you were spared serious awkwardness.      1. Yahtzee      Yahtzee is a pretty fun dice game on its own, worth enjoying over a pizza and a few beers. Is it fun to watch people roll dice on a national television show? No. No, it isn't.      2. My Dad is Better Than Your Dad      Here was a game where you could win by teaming up with your dad to compete against other father/son teams. The idea wasn't awful, but watching the execution really hurt.      3. Scrabble      Scrabble is great when you're playing it. Watching other people play it kind of sucks. Not even Chuck Woolery could save this one.      4. Identity      Penn Jilette of Penn and Teller fame took the helm in this game show, which challenged contestants to match 12 strangers to their identities. The capacity for stereotyping was like a giant landmine, which is why we'd guess it only lasted one season.      5. Twenty One      Twenty-One, hosted by Maury Povich, was based off the original quiz show of the same name in the 1950s. The show only lasted one season, which left Povich more time for lie detector tests and paternity tests for his talk show.      6. Naked Jungle      This UK game show challenged couples to roam through the jungle performing an assault course naked. We don't think further explanation of why this was a bad idea is required.      7. Shafted      Another gem from the UK, Shafted was canceled in 2001 after only four episodes. Apparently host Robert Kilroy-Silk's tagline \\"Their fate will be in each other's hands as they decide whether to share or to shaft\\" didn't sit well with people.      8. Show Me The Money      William Shatner, go-go dancers and breaks for \\"Sexy Party\\" time. What could go wrong? ||||| Summary:","output":"A reality competition series based on the 2005 blockbuster film “Mr. and Mrs. Smith,” starring Brad Pitt and Angelina Jolie, is in development.

At a St. Louis opera house in 1860, a singer in blackface named Jerry Barton, known as \\"King of the Minstrels\\", comes backstage and asks his sweetheart, Lettie Morgan, to elope. Lettie's Aunt Hortense, fearing that Barton is a fortune hunter, tells Lettie she is not the heiress she thought she was and that she has been living off her aunt's charity. With no fortune to hunt, Barton informs Lettie that an artist cannot be burdened with the responsibility of a wife. Outside the opera house, Lettie meets a chorus girl named Honey, who is preparing to leave with her theatrical troupe in a caravan heading West. When the troupe's producer mistakes Lettie for the star, she joins the group as \\"Mary Varden\\". The troupe's wagon train is escorted by Captain Tex Autry of the U.S. Cavalry and his singing plainsmen. The troupe misses the wagon train, however, and must travel alone. On their way to San Francisco, the caravan is ambushed by a gang of thieves. Tex and his men arrive on the scene and following a gunfight, the gang is chased off. After Tex saves Lettie from a runaway wagon, he comments on the foolishness of risking his men's lives for a bunch of \\"crazy showgirls\\".

We wanted to make a dip which required a blender, so when using the blender we realized it wasn't blending properly, upon inspection we saw that the top blade was bent upwards, so I called the front desk and was informed that they would have one at the front when I was ready to pick it up.

When i explained the situation she rolled her eyes and went anyways.  It took her 15 minutes to retrieve a blender, and finally told me that all the blades are upwards so that's how they are meant to me.  I merely stated that we wanted to create a dip, and she was quick with her attitude to tell me that a blender isn't a food processor (like i didnt know).

Tinariwen (Tamasheq: , with vowels , pronounced tinariwen \\"deserts\\", plural of tenere \\"desert\\") is a Grammy Award-winning group of Tuareg musicians from the Sahara Desert region of northern Mali. The band was formed in 1979 in Tamanrasset, Algeria, but returned to Mali after a cease-fire in the 1990s. The group first started to gain a following outside the Sahara region in 2001 with the release of The Radio Tisdas Sessions, and with performances at Festival au Desert in Mali and the Roskilde Festival in Denmark. Their popularity rose internationally with the release of the critically acclaimed Aman Iman in 2007. Tinariwen was founded by Ibrahim Ag Alhabib, who at age four witnessed the execution of his father (a Tuareg rebel) during a 1963 uprising in Mali. As a child he saw a western film in which a cowboy played a guitar. Ag Alhabib built his own guitar out of a tin can, a stick and bicycle brake wire. He started to play old Tuareg and modern Arabic pop tunes. Ag Alhabib first lived in Algeria in refugee camps near Bordj Badji Mokhtar and in the deserts around the southern city of Tamanrasset, where he received a guitar from a local Arab man. Later, he resided with other Tuareg exiles in Libya and Algeria.  In the late 1970s, Ag Alhabib joined with other musicians in the Tuareg rebel community, exploring the radical chaabi protest music of Moroccan groups like Nass El Ghiwane and Jil Jilala; Algerian pop rai; and western rock and pop artists like Elvis Presley, Led Zeppelin, Carlos Santana, Dire Straits, Jimi Hendrix, Boney M, and Bob Marley. Ag Alhabib formed a group with Alhassane Ag Touhami and brothers Inteyeden Ag Ablil and Liya Ag Ablil in Tamanrasset, Algeria to play at parties and weddings. Ag Alhabib acquired his first real acoustic guitar in 1979. While the group had no official name, people began to call them Kel Tinariwen, which in the Tamashek language translates as \\"The People of the Deserts\\" or \\"The Desert Boys.\\"  In 1980, Libyan ruler Muammar al-Gaddafi put out a decree inviting all young Tuareg men who were living illegally in Libya to receive full military training. Gaddafi dreamed of forming a Saharan regiment, made up of the best young Tuareg fighters, to further his territorial ambitions in Chad, Niger, and elsewhere. Ag Alhabib and his bandmates answered the call and received nine months of training. They answered a similar call in 1985, this time by leaders of the Tuareg rebel movement in Libya, and met fellow musicians Keddou Ag Ossade, Mohammed Ag Itlale (aka \\"Japonais\\"), Sweiloum, Abouhadid, and Abdallah Ag Alhousseyni. All sang and played guitar in various permutations. The musicians joined together in a collective (now known as Tinariwen) in order to create songs about the issues facing the Tuareg people, built a makeshift studio, and vowed to record music for free for anyone who supplied a blank cassette tape. The resulting homemade cassettes were traded widely throughout the Sahara region.  In 1989, the collective left Libya and moved to Ag Alhabib's home country of Mali, where he returned to his home village of Tessalit for the first time in 26 years. In 1990 the Tuareg people of Mali revolted against the government, with some members of Tinariwen participating as rebel fighters. After a peace agreement known as the Tamanrasset Accords was reached in January 1991, the musicians left the military and devoted themselves to music full-time. In 1992 some of the members of Tinariwen went to Abidjan, Cote d'Ivoire to record a cassette at JBZ studios. They played occasional gigs for far-flung Tuareg communities throughout the Sahara region, gaining word-of-mouth popularity among the Tuareg people.","output":"This text is primarily about the Grammy Award-winning group of Tuareg musicians, Tinariwen.

Every country has its own variations of harness racing: Please remove spaces between words.","output":"Harness racing, as a popular horse racing discipline, has found a significant following around the world and, as a result, different countries have developed their unique variations of the sport. Here is a detailed and long answer describing the variations of harness racing in different countries.  1. United States: The sport of harness racing originated in the United States and is known for its Standardbred horses. Two forms of pacing races are widespread in the US - trotting and pacing. Trotting is a gait where diagonally opposite legs move in tandem, while pacing is a gait where lateral legs move together. The races typically take place on mile-long oval racetracks, and the feature of starting gates is common. The events are often categorized by the horses' ages, sex, and career earnings. 2. Canada: As a close neighbor to the United States, the Canadian harness racing scene is quite similar. Standardbred horses dominate the races, and both trotting and pacing are popular. Canada is home to numerous prestigious harness racing events, such as the North America Cup, the Maple Leaf Trot, and the Canadian Pacing Derby. Like their American counterparts, Canadian races also use starting gates and take place at oval racetracks. 3. France: Known as 'trotting' in France, harness racing is referred to as \\"course de trot\\" and predominantly features trotting races. French trotters are the primary breed, and races are divided into two categories - mounted and driven. In mounted races, jockeys ride on the horse's back, and in driven races, they sit on sulky carts. French racetracks are unique in that they often feature both right-handed and left-handed tracks that range from 1,000 to 4,000 meters in length. Also, handicapped starts based on the horses' earnings are common in France. The most prestigious race in France is the Prix d'Amerique, held annually since 1920. 4. Italy: In Italy, harness racing primarily focuses on trotters, with Italian-bred trotters dominating the sport. Trotting races can either be driven or monté (ridden). Flat and hilly racetracks are used, and many tracks have mixed surfaces (dirt and grass). Races in Italy are typically longer, ranging from 1,600 to 3,000 meters in length. Popular contests include the Gran Premio Orsi Mangelli, Gran Premio Lotteria, and Gran Premio Mipaaft. 5. Scandinavia: This region is known for its excellent cold-blooded trotters. Harness racing in Sweden, Norway, Denmark, and Finland sees significant interest from participants and spectators. Races are exclusively trotting and driven, with no pacing or monté races. The tracks are mostly left-handed oval tracks ranging from 800 to 1,000 meters. Major Scandinavian events include the Elitloppet in Sweden, the Copenhagen Cup in Denmark, and the Finnish Trotting Derby in Finland. 6. Australia and New Zealand: Harness racing in these countries heavily features pacing with Standardbred horses. Races are conducted on circular and oval tracks, with both left and right-handed tracks in use. The New Zealand Cup and the Miracle Mile in Australia are among the most popular races in the region. The New Zealand \\"dual-gaited\\" horse - a horse capable of both trotting and pacing during races - is unique to this corner of the world and adds an interesting twist to the sport. In conclusion, while there are distinct differences in harness racing traditions across the world, the sport's core principles and exciting nature captivate fans and participants alike. From the pacing and trotting variations of North America to the exclusively trotting races of Europe and Scandinavia, the breed variations and cultural differences contribute to the sport's enduring appeal and worldwide popularity."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant that follows instruction extremely well.

Iteration 2: Compare -24 to -54 and -94.   - |-24 - (-54)| = 30, which is less than max_diff (40), so no change.   - |-24 - (-94)| = 70, which is greater than max_diff (40), so max_diff = 70. Iteration 3: Compare -94 to -54 and -24.   - |-94 - (-54)| = 40, which is less than max_diff (70), so no change.   - |-94 - (-24)| = 70, which is equal to max_diff (70), so no change. Once the loop has finished, we have found the maximum absolute difference of 70. Output: 70"},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant. User will you give you a task.

What is a one-sentence summary of the following article? Some teens have trouble with social interaction, with the reasons behind it varying. Since social interaction is necessary in order to succeed, it's important to learn how to cope with shyness and social anxiety. Consider working with a friend or a family member of close age to develop your social skills. It may not replace new social exchanges, but it's good practice.  Autistic teens and other disabilities/mental illnesses such as ADHD,  or social anxiety disorder, may have notable difficulty with social interaction. If you're an autistic teen, try learning how to develop better social skills, read other people's body language, and understand figurative language and sarcasm—it's important to learn how to interact in a neurotypical world.  If you have ADHD or related disorder, you can learn to not interrupt others, dominate the conversation, focus on the other person or task at hand, etc. towards those you don't know well. Every day, you'll likely see people you don't know, whether it be in school or out in public. It may seem funny to make fun of those that you don't know, but it's rude, and word will get back to them eventually. Later in life, you'll have to work with people you don't know; it's best to be polite towards strangers. If you can manage it, be friendly as well. It's appreciated by those around you, even if you don't see it.  If somebody you don't know has a clumsy moment that makes others laugh at them, such as dropping their books everywhere, don't laugh, and instead help them pick them up if you have the time. It's a nice thing to do, and they will likely appreciate it, even though they may not show it. . You don't need to be at the top of the social food chain and know everybody at school, but you should at least try to have a few loyal friends throughout your teenage years. Friendships are a good place to build your social skills, and building stable relationships with others can help you determine what you want in friendships and romantic relationships you may pursue.  And most importantly of all, life is simply easier and brighter with friends. Make sure your friends make you feel good about yourself and don't get you in trouble—you want to enjoy your teen years, not spend them miserable because of your \\"friends\\"!   Find friends who make you feel good and inspire you to be your best. Hang out with friends you really like, and worry less about maintaining relationships with people who don't improve your life. Friends come and go, and you may have different types and numbers of friends. That's okay. How many friends you have isn't important; it's the quality of the friends you do have that matters, as cliché as that sounds! If you struggle to find friends, try looking in areas where people are similar to you. Are you LGBT, for example? See if there's a teen LGBT group in your city, or if your school has a GSA that you could join. If you prefer writing over socializing, see if you can find writer's groups. If you're autistic, try seeking out other autistic people to befriend. Try going on social media if you can't find friends face-to-face. However, be very careful with this. Online friendships develop much differently than face-to-face friendships, and many people online are not who they say they are—you never know what goes on behind the screen. Sometimes it may not be even an actual human you are talking to. Exercise caution when making friends online, and never agree to meet up with somebody in private. Avoid giving out personal information to people you meet online unless you are sure that they can be trusted.  It is best to meet people in real life first before meeting them on the internet. Some—but not all—teens are interested in romantic relationships, and may want to find a partner. If you get into a relationship, take it slowly and communicate with your partner well. This leads to the healthiest relationships in the long run. You don't need to be tethered to your partner, either. Make sure the relationship allows the both of you to have your own friends and interests. You don't need to rush into anything before you're ready.  If your relationship ends, it's not the end of the world. You may be tempted to swear off of dating forever, especially if you were badly hurt, but keep an open mind. People grow and change. A relationship that would have worked six months ago may turn out to be extremely destructive now. And remember, few couples stay together during or after high school, whether it's because of long distance or other factors. Be wary of abusive relationships. If you feel like you have to constantly walk on eggshells around your partner to try and avoid them getting angry at you or hitting you, or if you can't talk to anybody else without your partner accusing you of cheating, these are huge red flags that the relationship is unhealthy and that you need to get out of it! The same applies for toxic friendships. Family members—especially parents—probably worry about you during your teenage years. Many teenagers become sullen, withdrawn, and stop valuing family as much as they used to. Try to avoid this. Family is one of the most important connections in your life—it's the building blocks for all relationships you develop, whether they're friendships, romantic relationships, or a family that you choose to have later on in life. And plus, you see them every day—why not make it nice to spend time with them?   You don't have to be best friends with everyone in your family, but be kind to them and spend time with them once in a while; play a video game with your sister, help your brother with his writing, offer to go on a walk with your mom, or play a board game with your dad. Don't just stay in your room all day and only see your family at meals. Improve your relationship with your siblings. It's fine to argue and bicker with siblings here and there, but remember that your sibling relationship is usually one of the longest in your life. Siblings can be great allies, mentors, and friends, not just now, but also when you're old and grey. Watch out for abusive family members. Your family can be some of the closest friends you have, but they can also negatively impact your life. If your parents constantly make you feel down, they may be emotionally abusing you. If your brother constantly hits you, that's a sign of physical abuse. Usually, talking things out with a close friend or confronting your abuser can lessen the hurt, but know when to report child abuse. Keep close to your extended family, such as your cousins, too; make an effort to spend time with them when you can. You probably don't see your extended family often, so take advantage of the time you do have to hang out with them! Summary:","output":"This article talks about the importance of social skills for teens, suggesting ways to practice and improve them, build friendships and healthy relationships, and the value of staying close to family members while also being cautious of abusive relationships."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Write a text based on \\"rabbits unearth rare medieval glass window as they refurbish their burrow\\" Text:","output":"Title: Forest Creatures Reveal Medieval Secrets: A Rare Glass Window Unearthed by Rabbits Once upon a time, deep within the enchanted heart of an ancient forest, there lived a community of rabbits. These rabbits went about their daily tasks with boundless energy and enthusiasm, always seeking new adventures and ways to improve their simple lives within the majestic forest glade. They were proud woodland dwellers, with generations of tales woven into the roots and branches of their burrow. One warm spring morning, as the sun began to break through the leaves, Chief Bunny, the oldest and wisest rabbit, called upon his fellow rabbits to embark on an ambitious project: the refurbishment of their burrow. This monumental task was to be a way to further the legacy of the rabbit folk and ensure that their young could prosper in the lap of a comfortable and secure home. And so, the diligent rabbits began their labor. They dug and foraged, stocked and storied, all the while allowing their claws to carve a new chapter into the watery depths of their forest homeland. Days became weeks, blending into a symphony of hard work, sweat, and unyielding toil. One afternoon, while diligently working on a new section of their burrow, the grey-furred rabbit named Whisper stumbled upon something that caught the glint of sunlight. It was a piece of glass, encrusted with dirt and age, yet still retaining its radiant beauty. Whisper called upon her comrades, who gathered around the magnificent find, each straining to comprehend its significance. For this was no simple, mundane piece of glass: it was a rare, medieval stained glass window, adorned with intricate designs that whispered of the earth's secret history. How had such a relic come to be buried in the living heart of the forest, one may ask. No one could fathom just how the hands of time had entrusted these rabbits with such a treasure. Curiosity piqued and hearts aflutter, the rabbit community set out on a quest to learn more about the mysterious glass window. They sought out the wise elders, whose memories were ingrained in the ancient tapestry of the forest, patiently listening to stories and legends that unraveled the past. Their quest led them to uncover that many centuries ago, a grand monastery had thrived deep within the forest. The monks of this medieval haven had sought solace, silence, and a spiritual connection with nature. The monastery was renowned for its gifted artisans who crafted the most exquisite works of art, including beautiful stained glass windows that bejeweled the monastery walls. Alas, the tides of time and the relentless advance of civilization eventually left this spiritual abode in its wake. The majestic monastery crumbled into ruin, the remnants of its finely-crafted glass entombed in the earth's bosom. But the universe had bestowed upon these rabbits a chance: through their industrious refurbishing efforts, they unearthed a key to the long-lost secrets of the forest. The innocent survivors of the flourishing medieval world were none other than the very guardians of the forest: the rabbits themselves. In embracing the history of their ancestors, they became the living legacy of a glorious past. And so, the rabbits pledged to pay homage to the whispers of their homeland. They lovingly incorporated the glass window into their now refurbished burrow, weaving the story of their mystical forest into the fabric of their lives. Thus began a new chapter in the tale of the rabbits who unearthed a rare medieval glass window, teaching their young about the wisdom of the past, while also looking forward to a present that spoke of strength, perseverance, and a hopeful future."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant that follows instruction extremely well.

Please answer the following question: Suggest a movie title for the following movie plot: A young couple from the city, Mike and Sheryl, sets out for a camping tour in the West Virginia countryside. While making love in the woods they are discovered by three young local guys with rifles and a jar of self-made alcohol, which they force-sell to them. They seem to be the bad guys but as we will see, they're not. They also meet a middle-aged, rather conservatively dressed woman with a little wooden cart on a forest trail, who sends them on the Timber Falls trail, claiming that would be the most rewarding of all. She also asks them if they are married, which they are not (remember this for later). Next person they meet is a park ranger, who reassures them of the beauty of the Timber Falls trail. This happens shortly after Sheryl forces Mike to get rid of their handgun. He throws the bullets in a little creek.They arrive at a beautiful lake where they set up their tent and make love in the night. Somebody is watching them from outside the tent. The next morning Sheryl takes a swim in the lake and is abducted by a strange looking figure. Mike awakes and can only find Sheryl's necklace in the water. After meeting two of the three guys again and having a fight with them suspecting them of taking Sheryl, Mike gets caught in a bear trap and passes out.He awakes in a farmhouse and is taken care of by the woman they met earlier, called Ida. He gets suspicious after a while and asks her to call park service, which she declines. Soon the real scheme becomes clear: It is all a trap set up by Ida and the park ranger Clyde, who are in fact a couple who live there, desperately trying to get a child, but all their attempts so far have failed because the fetuses die in the womb. They want a (married!) couple so the husband can get his wife pregnant in their basement dungeon and, after nine months, they hopefully have their baby (the young couple would instantly get killed afterwards, of course).

Could you help me answer this question? If not, let me know by writing \\"Not answerable\\".  Plot title: The Three Musketeers Movie plot: In Venice, the Three Musketeers Athos (Matthew Macfadyen), Porthos (Ray Stevenson) and Aramis (Luke Evans), with the help of Athos' lover, Milady de Winter (Milla Jovovich), steal airship blueprints made by Leonardo da Vinci. However, they are betrayed by Milady, who gives the blueprints to the Duke of Buckingham (Orlando Bloom). Upon returning to France, the Musketeers are forced to disband by Cardinal Richelieu (Christoph Waltz) for their failure.One year later, the young D'Artagnan (Logan Lerman) leaves Gascony for Paris in hopes of becoming a Musketeer, like his father once was, only to learn that they no longer exist. D'Artagnan ends up challenging Captain Rochefort (Mads Mikkelsen), the leader of Richelieu's guard, to a duel after being offended by him, but Rochefort merely shoots him while he's distracted. In an attempt to get revenge, D'Artagnan offends Athos, Porthos and Aramis for petty reasons, and schedules duels with each of them, at the same day and at the same place, but in different times, not knowing who they are.Before they can duel, however, D'Artagnan and the Musketeers are attacked by the guards for breaking the law by having a public duel. They fight the soldiers off, at which point D'Artagnan discovers their true identities, but end up being captured and brought before the young King Louis XIII (Freddie Fox) and his wife, Queen Anne (Juno Temple). Richelieu attempts to convince them to execute the four prisoners, but they are too impressed, and congratulate them instead, much to Richelieu's anger.Later, Richelieu meets with Milady, who is actually working for him. He orders her to plant false love letters among Queen Anne's possessions and steal Queen Anne's diamond necklace and hide it in the Tower of London with the objective of framing Queen Anne of having an affair with the Duke of Buckingham, who is in France on behalf of the King of England, and who has built a fully armed airship using the designs stolen from the Musketeers. The affair would force King Louis to execute Queen Anne... My question: Whom does D'Artagnan ends up challenging? A:","output":"D'Artagnan ends up challenging Captain Rochefort, the leader of Cardinal Richelieu's guard, to a duel after being offended by him.

The petition that Derrick started isn't signed by Kevin.","output":"The petition that Derrick started isn't signed by Kevin. The reason for this remains unclear. Derrick, a known activist within their community, commonly starts initiatives like this to combat social issues. His proactive measures have often drawn both support and criticism. Despite many in the community passionately partaking in his pleas, Kevin, a well-respected figure within the neighborhood, has conspicuously abstained from signing Derrick’s petitions.  There could be multiple reasons for Kevin's non-participation. He may disagree with the objectives of the petition, feel detached or indifferent about the issue, or perhaps he simply overlooked the chance to sign it. Starting with the first potential reason: Kevin and Derrick, though both prominent figures in the community, did not always see eye to eye on every issue. They had distinct perspectives and occasionally diverging interests that led to frequent, intense debates during community meetings. So, it isn’t a big surprise that Kevin might disagree with the objectives of the petition Derrick started. Another scenario that could explain Kevin's nonparticipation could be indifference. Despite being an active member of the community, not every single issue piqued Kevin's interest. His engagements were primarily focused around education and children's welfare. Therefore, if Derrick's petition was about an issue that Kevin didn't feel as passionate about, he might have disregarded it. Lastly, it’s also possible that Kevin may have simply missed the opportunity to sign the petition. With an array of responsibilities and commitments, the petition might have slipped off his radar unintentionally. To bring some clarity to the situation, a conversation with Kevin might be the best way to understand his reasons. It’s crucial to remember that, despite the difference of opinion or lack of interest, everyone within the community maintains the freedom to choose what to support and what not to support. In writing this, I tried to build upon the existing text by exploring possible reasons why Kevin hasn't signed the petition, thereby creating some tension and intrigue in the story. The intention was to provide nuanced characterization of the two main subjects (Derrick and Kevin) by revealing their differences in perspectives and interests. This portrays them as multifaceted beings with differing priorities, viewpoints, affiliations, and commitments. I ended on a note encouraging respect for diverse viewpoints and freedom of choice, to promote a sense of community.

In the morning, North Korea Leader Kim Jong Un will cross the military demarcation line that divides the two Koreas at the village of Panmunjom, the historic site where the Korean War armistice was signed in 1953. He will be met by South Korean President Moon Jae-in on the South Korean side of the heavily fortified demilitarized zone. This will be the third inter-Korean summit, but it will be the first time that a leader from the communist North will enter the democratic South. The summits in 2000 and 2007 were held in North Korea. Kim will travel with an official delegation that includes his sister, Kim Yo Jong, who led the North’s delegation to the Winter Olympics in South Korea, Kim Yong Nam, the North’s nominal head of state, and Kim Yong Chol. Kim Yong Chol was previously the head of the North’s military intelligence agency and has been named by South Korea as being responsible for ordering the deadly 2010 sinking of the Cheonan, a South Korean navy vessel. It is unclear if Kim Jong Un’s wife, Ri Sol-ju, will be part of the official delegation from the North. She recently traveled with Kim when he visited Chinese President Xi Jinping in Beijing. South Korea will hold a welcoming ceremony for the North Korean leader that will include a military honor guard review. During past summits, North Korea also organized the same level of ceremonial guard used to underscore friendly relations with an important visiting head of state. The two leaders will pose together for pictures, and plant a pine tree in the DMZ to symbolize Korean reconciliation. The leaders from the North and South may also walk together along a historic footbridge called the “Bridge of No Return” that was used for prisoner exchanges at the end of the Korean War. Moon and Kim will hold direct talks in the Peace House conference hall, both in the morning and the afternoon, but the North Korean delegation will...

Here is an article: University of Illinois student Ryan Tompkins bought a discounted bus fare for 50 cents to visit a friend at Illinois State University in November 2011. More than a year later, a FedEx envelope arrived at his parents' Edgebrook home. The bus company, Suburban Express, was demanding that Tompkins pay 138.35 — a fine, he would learn, for using a bus ticket on the wrong date. Tompkins had two options: He could pay up — a 100 convenience charge and 8 representing the full fare amount, plus 30.35 in collection costs — or dispute the matter in small claims court and risk accruing an additional 200 in fees, the letter said. \\"We typically prevail in our small claims cases,\\" the company warned. \\"Govern your actions accordingly.\\" Tompkins refused to pay the bill, which he considered an unfair charge. \\"If I used the ticket for the wrong date, when I was getting on the bus, why didn't they just tell me it was for the wrong date?\\" he said in an interview. \\"It was more than a year ago at this point, so I don't even remember what happened.\\" The company, whose bus and Illini Shuttle service ferry students between college campuses and the Chicago area, ultimately sued Tompkins, making him one of at least 124 customers to be sued by the company for small claims in the past six months, according to court records. Other students were sued after boarding the wrong bus or getting a refund for an unused ticket. The company said in court documents that the customers had violated the terms and conditions of their tickets, to which passengers must agree before buying a ticket. Those terms, which had been listed on the company's website, included a 100 charge if customers used an invalid, altered or duplicate ticket, and a 500 charge if they engaged in \\"disruptive behavior.\\" The company filed the lawsuits in Ford County, about a half-hour drive from Champaign and more than an hour from Bloomington, a location it specified in the terms and conditions as the \\"agreed venue for any legal action.\\" But this week, outrage over the lawsuits prompted the company to revise those terms and conditions. On Tuesday the company filed paperwork to drop all of its lawsuits in Ford County, court Clerk Kim Evans said. \\"We recognized that this legal approach of trying to uphold our agreement with customers carries with it a negative perception that we do not intend,\\" bus company owner Dennis Toeppen said in an email, saying the company is revising its policies. New terms and conditions posted to the company's website Monday no longer specify Ford County as the venue for disputes and does not mention fines for invalid tickets or causing disturbances. The company's motions to dismiss its pending cases against students came one day after Ford County Judge Steve Pacey ordered a venue change for a case against a student who lives in Lake County. Suburban Express has an office in Champaign and a post office box in Lisle, according to Toeppen. \\"The inconvenience of the parties traveling ... (to Ford County) ... for a 68.75 claim is obvious,\\" Pacey wrote. Mounting frustration with Suburban Express erupted recently when Jeremy Leval, a graduate student at the U. of I., complained on Facebook about what he alleged was rude treatment by a bus driver. The post went viral and led to a report by The Daily Illini, the student newspaper, about the company's lawsuits against students. Days later, the company sued Leval for 500 in \\"liquidated damages.\\" That suit, and the suit against Tompkins, were among 71 cases that the company filed against students on a single day last month, according to court records. The timing — there's about a month to go before students head out of town for summer break — and out-of-the-way location of the courthouse left students \\"in an uproar,\\" Evans said. \\"Mothers were calling, fathers were calling, very upset,\\" she said. Toeppen said those lawsuits were filed all at one time because his company had taken the winter break to process a backlog of collection files. He said his company filed suit against students because he believed they were intentionally using the wrong tickets to board buses, which hurt his business. For example, students who wanted to ride a sold-out bus would buy a ticket for a different date or time but board the sold-out bus instead, he said.

Yun studied forest soils, while Jian studied grassland soil. They were both very surprised with they findings.  But I can use this background: In grassland, much of the organic matter added to the soil is from the deep, fibrous, grass root systems. By contrast, tree leaves falling on the forest floor are the principal source of soil organic matter in the forest. Another difference is the frequent occurrence in the grasslands of fires that destroy large amounts of aboveground material but stimulate even greater contributions from roots. Also, the much greater acidity under any forests inhibits the action of certain soil organisms that otherwise would mix much of the surface litter into the mineral soil. As a result, the soils under grasslands generally develop a thicker A horizon with a deeper distribution of organic matter than in comparable soils under forests, which characteristically store most of their organic matter in the forest floor (O horizon) and thin A horizon.

This place is by no means your fancy, spa-type relaxation massage place. I was in a room to accommodate 4 massages- 4 people getting a massage and 4 employees. It was a bit cramped and the employees were talking to each other in Chinese, and they weren't whispering!nnYou do not have to get undressed, they simply move your clothes to the side to get to your shoulder or back or legs. But I would recommend wearing loose pants or shorts, I made the mistake of wearing jeans which probably inhibited the foot/leg massage I got. nnThe deep massage was a bit rough at times, especially when they did my back massage. But overall, I left feeling like all the knots were massaged out and would definitely come back when I'm in the area. nnBe warned!! They have their own tipping system- it does not go by percentage of your bill, there's a sign at the front desk showing what they think is an appropriate tip. It's still pretty reasonable considering we paid 40/person for an hour massage which included tip. But... if you don't tip correctly, you might hear a complaint!!

This supposed discovery gave a new impulse to Menasseh 's Messianic hopes . Menasseh wrote a book about this narrative , The Hope of Israel . In it Menasseh argued , and tried to give learned support to the theory that the native inhabitants of America at the time of the European discovery were actually descendants of the ( lost ) Ten Tribes of Israel .

Q: If I tell you that Plants are part of the ecosystem. , and ask you the question \\"what are parts of the ecosystem?\\", is the correct answer \\"wetland\\"? Select from: a. Yes. b. No. A:","output":"b. No. An ecosystem comprises various biotic (living) and abiotic (non-living) components that interact with one another. While plants are an important part of an ecosystem, merely saying that \\"plants are part of the ecosystem\\" does not provide a complete answer to the question \\"what are parts of the ecosystem?\\" Wetlands, on the other hand, are a type of ecosystem themselves, characterized by the presence of standing water, hydric soils, and unique plant and animal communities. Since you asked about the parts of an ecosystem, a more detailed answer would include other biotic and abiotic components. Some key components of an ecosystem include: 1. Producers: These are organisms, such as plants, algae, and some bacteria, that convert sunlight or/and inorganic molecules into usable energy through photosynthesis or chemosynthesis. They form the base of the food chain or food web in an ecosystem. 2. Consumers: These are organisms that get their energy by consuming other organisms. Consumers can be herbivores, which eat plants (e.g., deer, rabbits); carnivores, which eat other animals (e.g., wolves, lions); omnivores, which eat both plants and animals (e.g., bears, humans); and detritivores, which consume decaying organic matter (e.g., earthworms, some insects). 3. Decomposers: These are organisms, such as fungi and bacteria, that break down dead organic matter and recycle nutrients back into the ecosystem. 4. Abiotic components: These include non-living components of an ecosystem, such as sunlight, temperature, water, soil, and various minerals and nutrients. Abiotic factors help shape the structure and composition of an ecosystem and determine the types of organisms that can survive within it. In summary, while wetlands are a type of ecosystem, they are not the correct answer to the question about the parts of an ecosystem. Instead, a comprehensive answer would mention various biotic and abiotic components that contribute to the functioning of an ecosystem."},{"instruction":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

Today I want to take it a step further and focus on how to start clean eating on a budget.  It is very similar with just a couple of extra steps. Clean eating focuses on fresh ingredients, no processed foods, and eating good foods as close to nature as possible such as: fruits, vegetables, whole grains, cage-free eggs, grass-fed beef and grain-fed poultry, and raw milk (if possible) to your diet. Some of these may seem like a burden when you are on a small food budget, but with the tips below, you can eat clean and stay within your budget. I am sure you will recognize some from the previous post; but read through there is extra information that applies specifically to clean eating. A major component of clean eating is buying fresh produce rather than canned fruits and vegetables. Frozen produce is OK; but, if in-season fruit is available, it is always better to choose that. Buy in bulk, and freeze it yourself. Use Google to help you search for seasonal produce in your area. When you can buy it from a Farmer’s Market, or even directly from the farmers, it will be less expensive. My next choice is SPOUTS Farmer’s Marker, if there is one near you. Those sources will probably be the least expensive. For example:  you may be able to buy strawberries, peaches, and nectarines very inexpensively in the summer and find that squash is a better buy in the fall.  Always buy extra when the price is right and freeze the leftovers. When you first start reading about clean eating, you may find “experts” expounding the importance of certain superfoods that you should start eating. The reality is – they are nutritious and excellent additions to your diet; but, you don’t have to eat them just start a clean eating. If you cannot afford to add chia seeds of flax seeds to every smoothie or eat a pomegranate each morning, don’t worry about it. Buy the clean foods you can afford and eat those – you will be doing just fine. According to the above context, answer the following question. What does the author seem to most probably believe about the availability of seasonal produce? pick from the following. (i). that seasonal produce is in limited supply; (ii). most likely that people can find places that sell seasonal produce where they live; (iii). not enough information; (iv). that seasonal produce is most likely available only at farmers markets; Answer:","output":"(ii). most likely that people can find places that sell seasonal produce where they live;"},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

(4). are then seen climbing up large rocks while another waits at the bottom.. Answer:","output":"(4). are then seen climbing up large rocks while another waits at the bottom. This is the correct answer because it logically continues the action described in the original sentence, which is people strapping rope onto themselves in a mountain setting. The other options are incorrect for the following reasons: (1). are then seen running down a snowy mountain in front of a crowd: This option does not fit well with the initial description of people strapping rope onto themselves, as it suggests a different activity that doesn't involve ropes. (2). are shown riding down a winding mountain with many shooting little names up at the camera: This option is grammatically incorrect and is not clear about the action taking place. It also doesn't seem to connect with the initial phrase of strapping ropes on. (3). get off the boat, walk up the steps to one of the mountain's and climb up: This option introduces new information that doesn't fit with the original sentence (the boat and steps). It also has a grammatical error with the possessive form of \\"mountain's.\\""},{"instruction":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

Which region had fewer plants with an ability to come up with a sort of strategy to minimize water loss?  Austria had two distinct climactic regions. The eastern region was exposed to a wet climate and had thriving vegetation, while the western region was exposed to drought.  Hint: One interesting thing that has been found in plants that are consistently exposed to drought, is their ability to form a sort of \\"memory\\". In a study by Tombesi et al., they found plants who had previously been exposed to drought were able to come up with a sort of strategy to minimize water loss and decrease water use. They found that plants who were exposed to drought conditions actually changed they way the regulated their stomates and what they called \\"hydraulic safety margin\\" so as to decrease the venerability of the plant. By changing the regulation of stomata and subsequently the transpiration, plants were able to function better in situations where the availability of water decreased. Answer:","output":"The western region had fewer plants with an ability to come up with a sort of strategy to minimize water loss. Step 1: Identify the two distinct climactic regions mentioned in the paragraph: eastern (wet climate) and western (exposed to drought). Step 2: Understand the hint given: Plants exposed to drought have a better ability to form a sort of \\"memory\\" to minimize water loss and decrease water use. Step 3: Since the western region is exposed to drought, according to the hint, plants in this region are more likely to have developed the mentioned strategies to minimize water loss. This implies that the eastern region (with a wet climate) had fewer plants with an ability to come up with a sort of strategy to minimize water loss."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant that follows instruction extremely well.

Be it hunger, shelter or search for a mate, he has always controlled the situations to his advantage. Probably this might be the reason why we humans are the most developed of all living species on the earth. As we climbed the steps of development, we somehow left behind common sense and logical thinking -- we forgot that we have stopped thinking ahead of time. If you are hungry, what do you do? Get a piece of your favorite meal and stay quiet. Just like your stomach, even your mind is hungry. But it never lets you know, because you keep it busy thinking about your dream lover, favorite star and many such things. So it silently began to care about your needs and never let itself grow. _ This might be the reason why we all sometimes think \\"What happens next?\\", \\"Why can't I think?\\" \\"Why am I always given the difficult problems?\\" Well, this is the result of using our brain for thinking of not-so-worthy things. Hunger of the mind can be actually satisfied through reading. Now why reading and not watching TV? Because reading has been the most educative tool used by us right from the childhood. Just like that to develop other aspects of our life, we have to turn to reading. You have innumerable number of books in this world which will answer all your \\"How to?\\" questions.

To protect his clients' intellectual property and himself, Jennings, with the aid of his friend Shorty (Giamatti), undertakes a memory wipe to remove knowledge of his engineering. Jennings is approached by his old college roommate, James Rethrick (Eckhart), the CEO of the successful Seattle technology company Allcom. Rethrick proposes a lengthy three-year reverse engineering job to Jennings, requiring him to live on Allcom's secured campus until its conclusion but rewarding him handsomely with company stock. Jennings agrees and, after arranging for his long-term absence, arrives at Allcom, turns in his personal possessions, and is given a brief tour of the facility where he meets and flirts with botanist Dr. Rachel Porter (Thurman). He is injected with a long-term memory marker for the post-job memory wipe. Three years later (June 2007), at the conclusion of the memory wipe, Jennings is sitting in Rethrick's office, being thanked for a successful job. On returning home, Jennings finds that, although his Allcom shares would have been worth around 92 million, he had signed them away near the end of his tenure. Furthermore, he finds that his personal possessions have been replaced with an envelope containing a random assortment of everyday items. Soon after, the FBI captures him; and Agent Dodge (Morton) interrogates him on charges related to the death of physicist William Dekker.

Please briefly summarize this news article: Consumers cut credit card use for second month WASHINGTON – Americans cut back on their credit card use in July for the second straight month as many remain cautious in the face of high unemployment and slow growth. Total consumer borrowing dipped 3.3 billion in July from June to a seasonally adjusted 2.705 trillion, the Federal Reserve said Monday. The drop in credit card debt offset a small rise in a measure of auto and student loans. The Fed also said Americans have borrowed much more than previously estimated after it revised consumer borrowing data back to December 2010. June's figure was increased to 2.708 trillion, or 130 billion higher than initially thought. It's also well above pre-recession levels. Consumer debt declined even though Americans boosted their spending in July by the most in five months, according to government data released last week. The job market has weakened substantially from the start of the year, which is keeping downward pressure on spending. In August, employers added just 96,000 jobs, down from 141,000 in July and well below the average 226,000 jobs a month in the January-March quarter. Consumers have been using credit cards much less since the 2008 credit crisis. Four years ago, Americans had 1.03 trillion in credit card debt, an all-time high. In July, it was 850.7 billion — or 17% lower. During that same time, student loan debt has increased dramatically. The category that includes auto and student loans, along with other loans for items such as boats, has jumped to 1.85 trillion from 1.56 trillion in July 2008. Much of that increase in student loans is a result of high unemployment, which has led many Americans to seek better education and skills in a more competitive labor market. The weak job market is putting more pressure on the Federal Reserve to provide more help to the anemic economy. Fed officials will meet Wednesday and Thursday. Economists expect the central bank to announce another round of bond buying to put downward pressure on long-term interest rates. The economy is growing too slowly to boost business and consumer confidence and spur sustained gains in spending and hiring. Overall economic growth slowed to an annual rate of just 1.7% in the April-June quarter, and analysts don't expect much of a pickup for the rest of the year. Overall, Americans have been steadily paring debt since the financial crisis. Household debt, including mortgages and home equity lines of credit, has declined for 16 straight quarters to 12.9 trillion in March, according to a separate Fed survey on consumer finances. That's down from 13.8 trillion in March 2008. Some of that debt has been removed by defaults, such as foreclosures. But Americans are also repairing their finances by paying down debts. The Fed's monthly consumer credit report covers auto loans, student loans and credit cards. Unlike the quarterly Fed report, it excludes mortgages, home equity loans and other loans tied to real estate.","output":"In July, American consumers reduced their credit card usage for the second consecutive month due to ongoing concerns about high unemployment rates and slow economic growth. According to the Federal Reserve, total consumer borrowing decreased by 3.3 billion, reaching a seasonally adjusted 2.705 trillion. This decline in credit card debt was counterbalanced by a slight increase in auto and student loans. The Federal Reserve also revealed that Americans have borrowed significantly more than initially estimated since December 2010, with June's figure being raised by 130 billion to 2.708 trillion. This is above pre-recession levels. Despite the decreased consumer debt, spending in July increased at its fastest rate in five months. However, the job market has weakened considerably, with only 96,000 jobs added in August, down from 141,000 in July. Credit card usage has been declining since the 2008 financial crisis, with a 17% decrease in outstanding debt over the last four years. In contrast, student loan debt has risen dramatically, as high unemployment rates have driven Americans to invest in their education to compete in the labor market. This weak job market is placing more pressure on the Federal Reserve to provide further assistance to the struggling economy. Experts predict that the central bank will announce another round of bond buying to reduce long-term interest rates. The slow-growing economy is hurting consumer and business confidence, leading to limited spending and hiring. The annual growth rate for the second quarter was a mere 1.7%, and analysts do not expect significant improvements for the remainder of the year. Overall, Americans have been steadily reducing their debt since the financial crisis. Household debt has declined for 16 consecutive quarters, reaching 12.9 trillion in March, down from 13.8 trillion in March 2008. Some of this reduction is due to foreclosures and defaults, but Americans are also consciously working to pay down their debts."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Which American full size pick up truck is the most reliable? Which full-size American pickup truck is the most reliable? Choose your answer. Are these two questions paraphrases of each other? Select from the following.  a). no;  b). yes;","output":"b). yes; Both questions are essentially asking for the same information. They are paraphrases of each other, as they both inquire about the most reliable full-size American pickup truck available. To answer the question briefly, it would be difficult to make a definitive statement, as reliability tends to vary across different models and years. However, by analyzing various studies and reviews, one can often gain a better understanding of the general reliability trends among the full-size American pickup truck market. Now, to provide a more detailed and long answer to the question: In order to determine which full-size American pickup truck is the most reliable, we must first define our parameters. In this case, we will consider trucks from the three major American automakers: Ford, General Motors (Chevrolet/GMC), and RAM (formerly a Dodge brand). We will also evaluate them based on surveys, studies, and expert reviews for long-term reliability and dependability. 1. Ford F-Series The Ford F-Series, particularly the F-150 model, has been America's best-selling pickup truck for decades. Known for their solid construction and dependable performance, F-Series trucks have earned a reputation for being reliable workhorses. In recent years, Ford has added numerous technology and safety features, further enhancing their appeal. J.D. Power's 2020 Vehicle Dependability Study ranked the Ford F-150 as the most reliable truck in the Large Light Duty Pickup segment. 2. Chevrolet Silverado and GMC Sierra Chevrolet and GMC, both subsidiaries of General Motors, often share platforms for their pickup trucks, such as the Chevrolet Silverado and GMC Sierra. Both models are generally known for their durability and longevity, although some model years have faced reliability issues. In J.D. Power's 2020 Vehicle Dependability Study, the Chevrolet Silverado ranked second, behind the Ford F-150, in the Large Light Duty Pickup segment. 3. RAM 1500 The RAM 1500 has experienced a significant improvement in recent years, with a complete overhaul of its design and engineering. While previously lagging behind Ford and Chevrolet in many areas, including quality, the latest generation of RAM trucks has garnered impressive reviews from experts and owners alike. The RAM 1500 earned top honors in J.D. Power's 2020 Initial Quality Study, ranking first in the Large Light Duty Pickup segment. However, long-term reliability remains to be seen as these models have not been on the market for an extensive period. In conclusion, it is challenging to declare a clear winner in the most reliable full-size American pickup truck category, as each manufacturer has models with varying levels of reliability. That said, the Ford F-150 generally earns high marks for dependability, with the Chevrolet Silverado and GMC Sierra not far behind. The RAM 1500 has shown significant promise in recent years, but its long-term reliability has yet to be firmly established. Buyers should consider factors such as individual needs, budget, and model-year-specific reliability ratings when making their purchasing decisions."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Juice is a liquid that is naturally contained in fruits and vegetables, and it can also refer to liquid products obtained by processing fruits and vegetables. Large containers can be used to store and distribute juice in various industries and settings, such as in manufacturing plants, restaurants, supermarkets, and household storage. In contrast, the other options do not fit the criteria of being a liquid that can be stored in a large container: B. Door - A door is a solid object that serves as an entrance or exit barrier in a room or building. It cannot be considered a liquid or something that can be stored in a container. C. Shed - A shed is a small structure that provides storage space and is typically found in residential gardens or yards. Like a door, it is not a liquid and cannot be stored in a container. D. Supermarket - A supermarket is a large establishment where a wide variety of food and household products are available for purchase. Although supermarkets may have liquid items, such as juices, the term supermarket refers to the store itself – a physical space – and not to a liquid that can be kept in a container. E. Cabinet - A cabinet is a piece of furniture built primarily for storage purposes, consisting of shelves, drawers, or compartments. It is a solid object and, once again, not a liquid that can be stored in a container.

You will be given a task. You must generate a detailed and long answer. Is the premise \\"Two men are looking at each other.\\" true if \\"Two men can't see each other.\\"?","output":"The premises \\"Two men are looking at each other.\\" and \\"Two men can't see each other.\\" are mutually contradictory, so it is not accurate to claim that both of these statements exist simultaneously within a single context. To analyze this situation better, let's scrutinize each of the premises. The first premise states that \\"Two men are looking at each other.\\" This implies that the two men are facing each other, being an adequate distance apart so that they can establish eye contact, and clearly perceive one another. This statement's validity would depend on whether the men have unobstructed vision of each other, are not blind or experiencing vision impairment, and are actively focusing on each other's appearance. On the other hand, the second premise claims that \\"Two men can't see each other.\\" This negates the assertion of the first premise, as it conveys the inability of the men to visually perceive one another. Several reasons could contribute to the truth of this premise: 1. Physical obstacles: An object or barrier could be obstructing the men's line of sight, preventing them from visually acknowledging each other. 2. Distance: The two men may be positioned too far apart, rendering their visual perception of one another impossible or extremely challenging. For instance, if they are standing at opposite ends of a large field or in separate rooms or buildings. 3. Vision impairment: One or both men may experience visual impairments, such as blindness or low vision, rendering them unable to see anything, including each other. 4. Environmental factors: Poor lighting conditions, fog, or heavy precipitation might be hampering their ability to see each other. Given these explanations, it is essential to recognize that both premises cannot be accurate within the same context. If the two men are indeed looking at each other, they must be able to perceive one another visually; conversely, if they cannot see each other, they cannot be said to be looking at one another. Therefore, the question of whether the statement “Two men are looking at each other.” is true when given the premise “Two men can't see each other.” is resolved by acknowledging the contradiction between the two statements. Consequently, the first premise is false if the second premise is true, and vice versa."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

As Christian narrates, the film flashes back to one year earlier upon Christian's move to the Montmartre district of Paris to become a writer among members of the area's Bohemian movement. He soon encounters that his neighbours are a loose troupe of performers led by Henri de Toulouse-Lautrec (John Leguizamo). Toulouse-Lautrec and the others ask for Christian's help, and his writing skills allow them to finish their proposed show, \\"Spectacular Spectacular\\", that they wish to sell to the owner of the Moulin Rouge, Harold Zidler (Jim Broadbent). The group arrives at the Moulin Rouge as Zidler and his \\"Diamond Dog Dancers\\" perform for the audience (\\"Zidler's Rap Medley\\"). Toulouse arranges for Christian to see Satine (Nicole Kidman), the star courtesan, in her private quarters to present the work, unaware that Zidler is promising Satine to the wealthy and unscrupulous Duke of Monroth (Richard Roxburgh), a potential investor in the cabaret (\\"Sparkling Diamonds\\"). Satine mistakes Christian for the Duke, and dances with him before retiring to her private chamber with him to discuss things privately (\\"Rhythm of the Night\\", \\"Meet Me in the Red Room\\"), but soon learns he is just a writer (\\"Your Song\\").

Based on the preceding passage, answer the following question Why did the driver immediately admit to being at fault ?","output":"Based on the passage provided, the driver immediately admitted to being at fault for several reasons. While we cannot fully understand the driver's thought process without more context, we can infer the following reasons: 1. Awareness of their mistake: The driver likely realized that they had committed an error by turning left in front of the cyclist. They might have failed to check for oncoming bicycles in the bike lane or did not pay sufficient attention while entering the intersection. This awareness of having made a mistake prompted the driver to accept responsibility for the accident. 2. Clear violation of traffic rules: The cyclist mentions that they were crossing the intersection on a green light, which means they had the right-of-way. By turning left in front of the cyclist who was following the traffic rules, the driver was aware that they had committed a violation, which made it clear that they were at fault in the accident. 3. Genuine remorse: The driver's immediate admission of fault might also result from genuine remorse for putting the cyclist in harm's way. They may have felt terrible about causing the accident and wished to take responsibility and make amends as soon as possible. It can also signify that the driver was aware of the potential consequences of their actions. 4. Desire to resolve the situation: The driver could have been motivated to accept their fault and cooperate with the cyclist to resolve the issue without delay. By admitting their mistake, the driver helped establish clear facts about the incident, allowing the insurance company to assess and compensate appropriately for any damages. 5. Consciousness about road safety: The driver's quick admission of fault may also indicate that they understand the importance of road safety and the duties of motorists in sharing the road responsibly with cyclists and pedestrians. This sense of responsibility could have influenced the driver's reaction and their genuine remorse. In conclusion, the driver's immediate admission of fault can be attributed to a combination of factors, such as realizing their mistake, being aware of the traffic rules and the rights of cyclists, genuine remorse for causing harm, a desire to resolve the situation promptly, and a conscientious mindset towards road safety. These factors together led the driver to accept responsibility for the accident immediately."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant. You should describe the task and explain your answer.

The answer to this question is:","output":"Lysergic acid diethylamide (LSD) is a powerful psychoactive substance that impacts the human body and brain by altering perceptions, emotions, and various physiological processes. Initially synthesized by Albert Hofmann in 1938, LSD has been used for its psychedelic effects, with the substance being both revered and feared for its potent influence on human consciousness. The impact of LSD on the human body can be analyzed in various ways, which we will delve into below. 1. Effect on the brain: LSD functions primarily by interacting with serotonin receptors in the brain. Serotonin is a neurotransmitter responsible for regulating mood, appetite, sleep, and cognition, among other functions. LSD has a high affinity for the 5-HT2A receptor subtype, which is mainly distributed in the cortex, and plays a significant role in modulating sensory perception, cognitive processes, and mood states. When LSD binds to the 5-HT2A receptors, it triggers a cascade of events resulting in the activation of various signaling pathways and the release of excitatory neurotransmitters such as glutamate. This excitatory neurotransmission is believed to underlie the heightened sensory awareness and altered perception experienced during an LSD trip. Additionally, LSD has been shown to increase the functional connectivity between brain regions that do not typically communicate with each other, leading to the synthesis of new neural pathways and the dissolution of the typical boundaries of self and reality. 2. Effect on the cardiovascular system: LSD can cause an increase in heart rate and blood pressure. The stimulation of the 5-HT2A receptors, along with other serotonin and adrenergic receptors, induces a release of stress hormones like norepinephrine, leading to vasoconstriction and, subsequently, elevated blood pressure and heart rate. While these physiological changes are typically well-tolerated by healthy individuals, they may pose risks for individuals with pre-existing cardiovascular conditions. 3. Effect on body temperature: LSD has the potential to raise body temperature due to its influence on the serotonin system. Serotonin plays a critical role in regulating body temperature, and excessive activation of the 5-HT2A receptors may lead to an imbalance in the body’s thermoregulatory mechanisms. This can result in hyperthermia, which, in extreme cases, can be life-threatening. 4. Effect on the muscular system: Users of LSD often report experiencing muscle tension, tremors, and increased reflexes during their trips. The exact mechanisms underlying these effects are not fully understood but are believed to involve the stimulation of serotonin, dopamine, and adrenergic receptors in the central and peripheral nervous systems. 5. Effect on the gastrointestinal system: LSD can cause nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, and other gastrointestinal disturbances. These effects are likely mediated by the drug's interaction with serotonin receptors in the gut, specifically the 5-HT3 receptors, which are known to play a role in regulating gut motility and the vomiting reflex. 6. Psychological impact: As a powerful hallucinogen, LSD can induce a wide range of psychological effects, including altered perceptions, emotional changes, synesthesia, and, in some cases, ego dissolution. These experiences can range from euphoric to terrifying, depending on the individual's mental state and environment. While many users find the experience to be valuable for its potential for self-insight and spiritual growth, others may have difficulty integrating the intense experience and may develop persistent psychological issues such as anxiety, depersonalization, or hallucinogen persisting perception disorder (HPPD). In conclusion, LSD impacts the human body in various ways by interacting with serotonin, dopamine, and adrenergic receptors. Its profound effects on the brain induce perceptual, cognitive, and emotional alterations, while its impact on the cardiovascular, muscular, gastrointestinal, and thermoregulatory systems highlights the drug's capacity to influence a variety of physiological processes. The psychological impact of LSD can be both therapeutic and challenging, and the drug's influence on human consciousness continues to be a subject of fascination and scientific inquiry."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Question:   Jim is designing a new car and playing around with different materials. If he were to decrease the weight of the vehicle, what would happen to the fuel efficiency of that vehicle? It would increase or decrease?    Text:  Lighter, more streamlined vehicles need less energy. Answer:","output":"Based on the provided text, it can be inferred that if Jim were to decrease the weight of the vehicle, the fuel efficiency of that vehicle would increase. The text states that lighter and more streamlined vehicles require less energy, which implies a positive correlation between reduced weight and better fuel efficiency. Decreasing the weight of a vehicle contributes to increased fuel efficiency because lighter vehicles require less energy to accelerate and maintain motion. This, in turn, results in lower fuel consumption as the engine doesn't have to work as hard to overcome inertia and resistive forces, such as rolling resistance and air drag. Consequently, less fuel is needed to power the engine, leading to an increase in fuel efficiency and improved overall performance. Furthermore, by utilizing different materials in the design process, such as lightweight metals and advanced composites, Jim could potentially enhance not only fuel efficiency but also other aspects of the vehicle's performance. For example, lighter materials can lead to better handling, faster acceleration, and shorter braking distances, which would benefit the overall driving experience for the end user. In conclusion, based on information from the text, decreasing the weight of the vehicle would increase its fuel efficiency. Exploring and incorporating lightweight materials into the car's design could thus result in valuable benefits both for the environment and for the overall performance and attractiveness of the vehicle."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

But ask him now he feels about that decision, and you get a tepid response. \\"I'm not sure,\\" Poskin said. Like many farmers in the Midwest, Poskin is concerned about getting caught in the middle of a trade war, as Trump ramps up economic pressure on China. Those fears were heightened after Trump announced plans Thursday to impose tariffs on as much as 60 billion worth of Chinese imports. \\"I'm fearful they will retaliate on those tariffs,\\" Poskin said. \\"Soybean exports, wheat, poultry, chicken, beef — [there are] any number of products that we export to their country that they could retaliate with.\\" The announcement has unnerved many in Trump's base of supporters in U.S. agriculture. The trade tensions have also rattled global markets, which until recently had performed strongly. Trump's tariff decision was meant to punish Chinese companies that benefit from unfair access to U.S. technology. U.S. businesses have long bristled at Beijing's requirement that they transfer technology to Chinese companies as a condition of entering the Chinese market. U.S. businesses have also had their technology stolen through cyberattacks. \\"We have a tremendous intellectual property theft situation going on,\\" Trump said during the signing ceremony Thursday. Some U.S. companies in China cheered the move and suggested that concerns about a trade war were overblown. William Zarit, chairman of the American Chamber of Commerce in China, dismissed the \\"hair on fire\\" concern that Trump's proposed moves would hurt the global economy. \\"That the U.S. is willing to risk these disruptions indicates how serious the U.S. administration finds China's forced technology transfer, cybertheft and discriminatory industrial policies,\\" he said in a statement to VOA.

I can’t think of anything “funny” I have seen at the zoo exactly although there has to be something…. we used to go to Catskill Game Farm and Bronx Zoo in NY so I am sure there has to have been something notable, if not funny…. At Catskill Game Farm there were Peacocks that walked around free and made startling noises. There were also punk flamingoes there that were amazing to see. Maybe the funniest (not so funny though) thing was in the area where you could feed deer and baby pigs so sometimes they’d all come around at once and mob you? My daughter wanted to feed who she wanted to feed but the deer and the pigs had their own ideas. The deer liked these crackers kind of like rye crisps and the baby pigs went for the bottles of milk or formula. When my daughter tried to pick and choose and just feed one suddenly she would be surrounded by many. I think my husband must have videos of what transpired. One of these days it might be entertaining to view them again.

She was in her Carmel, California, home. She is survived by her older sister, actress Olivia de Havilland -- with whom she had not spoken for decades. Fontaine was born Joan de Beauvoir de Havilland in 1916 in Tokyo, Japan, where her British father was a patent lawyer and teacher.

Fontaine was a teenager when she began her acting career as Joan Burfield in the 1935 film \\"No More Ladies.\\" She later adopted the stage name Fontaine -- the name of her mother's second husband. She wrote in her 1978 autobiography, \\"No Bed of Roses,\\" that her mother, who was an actress, began encouraging the rivalry with her older sister at an early age. The feud extended to their careers when both sisters were nominated for best actress Oscars in 1942.

Answer the following question: It's often difficult to remember how or why you became friends with someone, especially if you've been friends with a person forever. But because of the very specific set of circumstances, I remember exactly how Barend and I became friends. This, of course, was long before he became famous for inventing the easy-foldable map, and infamous for the series of bodies he'd decided to bury in his backyard. Barend and I became friends because he had one of the most attractive shadows I'd ever seen. I remember gazing out over the playground, watching a waning sun scatter its dying light over the monkey bars, the metal skeleton contrasting against the turquoise sky, when I noticed this kid coming toward me. He was one of those mostly invisible characters; faded jeans, dirty jacket, snot caked on his upper lip. I probably wouldn't have noticed him if not for his shadow. For some reason, his shadow immediately caught my eye. Now, I'm not one for noticing shadows in general, never really noticed a shadow before or since, but this kid had the most incredible shadow I'd ever seen. I cannot even put in words what that means. What specific set of properties make an ordinary shadow into an incredible one, I'm not sure anyone can, but his shadow was like a piece of art; I didn't necessarily understand it, but I liked it. And that's why this boring looking kid and I first became friends. Our kindergarten games were harmless and boring, but when puberty hit, Barend began to change. We were both expected to change, but I guess some kids just change more than others. Bared didn't want to kill at first. Like many overachievers in the death game, his first brush with the craft came about more or less accidentally. All the elements had been in place, with all the players and attributes coming together as if gathered by some evil force, but, even then, I really had to push the kid.

His first recording was as a violist in \\"Plus blanche que la blanche hermine\\" from Les Huguenots by Meyerbeer in 1903 for Pathé with the tenor Albert Vaguet. It is possible that Monteux played in the Colonne Orchestra's 20 early cylinders recorded around 1906–07. His recording debut as a conductor was the first of his five recordings of The Rite of Spring, issued in 1929. The first of these, with the OSP, is judged by Canarina to be indifferently played; recordings by Monteux of music by Ravel and Berlioz made in 1930 and 1931, Canarina believes, were more impressive. Stravinsky, who also recorded The Rite in 1929, was furious that Monteux had made a rival recording; he made vitriolic comments privately, and for some time his relations with Monteux remained cool.Monteux's final studio recordings were with the London Symphony Orchestra in works by Ravel at the end of February 1964. In the course of his career he recorded works by more than fifty composers. In Monteux's lifetime it was rare for record companies to issue recordings of live concerts, although he would much have preferred it, he said, \\"if one could record in one take in normal concert-hall conditions\\". Some live performances of Monteux conducting the Metropolitan Opera, and among others the San Francisco Symphony, Boston Symphony, BBC Symphony and London Symphony orchestras survive alongside his studio recordings, and some have been issued on compact disc.

Summarize: Sundowns were making their debut in this tournament having qualified for Japan after winning the African Champions League for the first time in their history in September. But the South Africans' hopes of progressing were dashed by two second half goals from Yasushi Endo (pictured) and Mu Kanazaki. In the first half, Sundowns dominated and were at the heart of the action with their Zimbabwean star Khama Billiat coming close. But Kashima, who beat Auckland City 2-1 in the tournament's opening match on Thursday, were gifted their opening goal by Sundowns' Ugandan goalkeeper Denis Onyango in the 63rd minute. Latching onto a knock-down from Shoma Doi, Endo scuffed his left-foot shot which somehow squeezed under Onyango, bobbling out of his grasp and over the line, almost in slow motion. Substitute Kanazaki killed the game off by smashing home from close range with two minutes left after more sloppy defending from the African champions. Sundowns coach Pitso Mosimane was left to rue his side's wasted opportunities. \\"We played against a good team, they had their chances and took them, we didn't take ours,\\" Mosimane said after the match. The South Africans will now play South Korea's Jeonbuk Hyundai in the fifth-place play-off match on Wednesday. Kashima, fresh from clinching their eighth J-League crown last weekend, will face Atletico Nacional of Colombia in the competition's first semi-final on Wednesday.

Plot title: Outland Movie plot: In the future, Federal Marshal William O'Niel (Sean Connery) is assigned to a tour of duty at the titanium ore mining outpost Con-Am 27, operated by the company Conglomerates Amalgamated on the Jovian moon of Io. Conditions on Io are difficult: gravity is 1/6 that of Earth's with no breathable atmosphere, spacesuits are cumbersome, and miners carry their own air supply. Shifts are long, but significant bonuses are paid. The outpost's general manager, Mark Sheppard (Peter Boyle), boasts that productivity has broken all previous records since he took over. O'Niel's wife Carol (Kika Markham) feels she cannot raise their son Paul on Io, fleeing with the child to the Jupiter space station to await a shuttle back to Earth. Later, a miner named Tarlow (John Ratzenberger) suffers an attack of stimulant psychosis: he sees spiders and rips open his spacesuit, resulting in his death by explosive decompression. Cane, another miner, enters an elevator without his spacesuit during another psychotic episode, and likewise dies from decompression. With the reluctant assistance of Dr. Lazarus (Frances Sternhagen), O'Niel investigates the deaths. Another incident involves a worker, Sagan, who takes a prostitute hostage and threatens to kill her with a knife. O'Niel attempts to calm the man while Montone (James B. Sikking), his sergeant, sneaks in via the air duct and kills Sagan with a shotgun. O'Niel and Lazarus discover that Sagan had traces of a powerful amphetamine-type drug in his bloodstream, which would allow the miners to work continuously for days at a time, until they \\"burn out\\" and turn psychotic after approximately ten months of use. O'Niel uncovers a drug distribution ring run by a corrupt Sheppard and sanctioned by Montone. Using surveillance cameras, O'Niel finds and captures one of Sheppard's dealers, Nicholas Spota. However, before Spota can be questioned, he is murdered. Montone is then found garroted. O'Niel finds the latest shipment of drugs in a meat locker that was shipped from the space station, but is...

Heavy metal (or simply metal) is a genre of rock music that developed in the late 1960s and early 1970s, largely in the United Kingdom. With roots in blues rock and psychedelic/acid rock, the bands that created heavy metal developed a thick, massive sound, characterized by highly amplified distortion, extended guitar solos, emphatic beats, and overall loudness. Heavy metal lyrics and performance styles are sometimes associated with aggression and machismo.  In 1968, the first heavy metal bands such as Led Zeppelin, Black Sabbath and Deep Purple attracted large audiences, though they were often derided by critics. During the mid-1970s, Judas Priest helped spur the genre's evolution by discarding much of its blues influence; Motörhead introduced a punk rock sensibility and an increasing emphasis on speed. Beginning in the late 1970s, bands in the new wave of British heavy metal such as Iron Maiden and Saxon followed in a similar vein. Before the end of the decade, heavy metal fans became known as \\"metalheads\\" or \\"headbangers\\".  During the 1980s, glam metal became popular with groups such as Mötley Crüe and Poison. Underground scenes produced an array of more aggressive styles: thrash metal broke into the mainstream with bands such as Metallica, Megadeth, Slayer, and Anthrax, while other extreme subgenres of metal such as death metal and black metal remain subcultural phenomena. Since the mid-1990s popular styles have further expanded the definition of the genre. These include groove metal (with bands such as Pantera, Sepultura, and Lamb of God) and nu metal (with bands such as Korn, Slipknot, and Linkin Park), the latter of which often incorporates elements of grunge and hip hop.

The","output":"The sentence could end in a variety of ways depending on the specific context or story you want to convey. Here is a detailed and long ending for the given sentence: Amy bought a used dryer from the thrift store. The moment she saw it, she knew this was the perfect addition to her growing collection of vintage appliances. It was a charming avocado-green model from the 1970s, which matched her washing machine and refrigerator. As a staunch environmentalist and someone who appreciated the quality and style of older appliances, Amy subscribed to the notion of \\"reduce, reuse, recycle.\\" She took joy in finding these bargains and putting them to good use, instead of seeing them end up in a landfill or wasting resources on manufacturing new appliances. Once she got the dryer home, she called her friend, Dave, a knowledgeable handyman and fellow vintage appliance enthusiast, to help install it. Dave, always eager to lend a hand and share his expertise, came right over. Together, they carefully examined the dryer to ensure that it was in good working condition. Dave inspected its electrical components, the thermostat, and the heating element. He also checked the drum and its accompanying belt, looking for signs of wear and damage. To Amy’s delight, the dryer was in surprisingly excellent condition, considering its age. Next, they unplugged her old dryer and removed it from the designated space. Since Amy was an advocate of repurposing items, she decided to give her old dryer to a neighbor in need. With the old dryer out of the way, Dave and Amy proceeded to install the new-to-her thrift store find. To install the dryer, they first leveled the unit on the laundry room floor, making sure it rested solidly on all its feet to prevent vibrations and noise during operation. They then connected the dryer’s exhaust duct to the vent that extended outside, ensuring all connections were secure and free of leaks. Once the vent was connected, they attached the power cord and connected it to the 240-volt outlet that was specifically designed for dryers. Finally, after ensuring that all safety precautions had been followed, they cautiously plugged in the dryer and turned it on for a trial run. The avocado-green dryer hummed to life, and Amy couldn't help but smile with satisfaction as warm air filled the drum and the familiar scent of freshly dried laundry began to permeate the air. To celebrate their successful installation, Amy and Dave sat down for a cup of coffee in her cozy kitchen, which was adorned with vintage décor. They chatted about their shared appreciation for older appliances, their reliability, and the charm they add to a living space. It was moments like these that Amy cherished, as they demonstrated the power of sustainability and community through her love for vintage appliances. In conclusion, Amy buying a used dryer from the thrift store not only turned out to be a fantastic bargain, but it also allowed her to contribute to a more sustainable lifestyle and strengthen her connection with her handyman friend, creating a heartwarming story driven by shared passions and environmental consciousness."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

(2). cuts a large piece of wood, with two axes blows the wood.  (3). puts a blade on the wood and move it into a straightener.  (4). takes a piece of the wood he cut and throws it into a pile. Step 1: Analyze the continuity of each option. Option 1 shows a logical progression, with the man continuing to cut wood. Option 2 seems odd as it's unclear why two axes would be needed, but it is still related to cutting wood. Option 3 introduces a new action (straightening the wood) that hasn't been mentioned before, making it less relevant. Option 4 shows a logical progression in which the man has completed cutting and is disposing of the cut wood. Step 2: Evaluate the relevance of each option. Options 1, 2, and 4 are all relevant, as they directly relate to the wood-cutting activity mentioned earlier. Option 3 is less relevant because it introduces a new, unrelated action.

Four A:","output":"Title: Four Lives in Peril Step 1: Introduction of Characters Introduce Glenn Griffin, a charming but ruthless escaped convict, and his two fellow escapees, Hank and Tommy, both equally menacing but with distinct personalities. They are trying to evade the police after a recent prison break. Step 2: Hostage Situation Setup Glenn, Hank, and Tommy decide to hide out at a seemingly ordinary suburban household. The house belongs to the Miller family: John, a stern and protective father; Laura, a loving and resourceful mother; Emily, an adventurous and intelligent teenager; and Billy, their resourceful and tech-savvy youngest son. Step 3: Tension and Conflict Build-Up Glenn and his men hold the Miller family hostage, demanding their cooperation in exchange for the family's safety. Tensions rise as both the family and their captors become more desperate to avoid the police. Glenn has clear goals for his escape and needs the family to ensure its success, while the Millers struggle to survive and find a way to alert the police without endangering their lives. Step 4: Personal Connections and Internal Struggles As the hours turn into days, lingering fears and insecurities surface. Glenn starts to develop feelings for Laura, which Hank and Tommy confront him about. John tries to maintain control over the situation, while Emily and Billy secretly work on an escape plan together while bonding with their captors.

Step 6: The Climactic Standoff Just when all hope seems lost, the police arrive, surrounding the house and leaving Glenn, Hank, and Tommy with limited options. Conflicted over his feelings for Laura and his partnership with the other convicts, Glenn faces the decision of surrendering or forging a violent path to escape. Step 7: The Resolution Glenn decides to turn against his fellow escapees, ensuring the safety of the family he has come to care for. As the police eventually arrest all the convicts, the Miller family emerges from the hostage situation both shaken and grateful for their survival. The family's bond is strengthened in the aftermath, having faced their fears together. Step 8: Reflecting on the Story Four Lives in Peril serves as a thrilling tale of desperation, love, and the undeniable strength of the human spirit in the face of adversity.

Given the paragraph above, please answer correctly the following question:   Which month of the year was wetter, September 2018 or September 2019?  Hint: When the subtropical ridge in the Northwest Pacific is stronger than normal, it leads to a wet monsoon season for Asia.[18] The subtropical ridge position is linked to how far northward monsoon moisture and thunderstorms extend into the United States. Typically, the subtropical ridge across North America migrates far enough northward to begin monsoon conditions across the Desert Southwest from July to September.[19] When the subtropical ridge is farther north than normal towards the Four Corners, monsoon thunderstorms can spread northward into Arizona.

In contrast, 2019 was a dry year influenced by the same weather phenomenon that lacked strength that year.

Movie title: 25th Hour Context: FLASHBACK: The movie begins as Montgomery \\"Monty\\" Brogan (Edward Norton) is driving in NYC with Kostya (Tony Siraguza), his Russian/Ukranian mobster-type muscle. Kostya has a heavy accent and some trouble with English idioms. He references \\"Doyle's Law\\" rather than Murphy's Law. They're late to meet with some \\"important people.\\" They find a badly injured dog that was obviously abandoned after a dogfight, and Monty wants to first shoot the dog with Kostya's gun (as a mercy killing) and then when he sees what a scrapper the pup is, he decides to save the dog. He grabs it in his jacket, and sticks it in his trunk, and though the dog bites him, he's very impressed with that fighting spirit. They drive on.PRESENT: Monty is sitting at the pier with the dog, whom he named Doyle. It's early morning; people are jogging. A strung out junkie comes to Monty begging for a fix, and Monty tells him to go to Harlem, because he's been \\"touched\\" and is out of the business. The junkie just doesn't seem to get it, says he's been coming to Monty for 5 years and that he'll remember this! He lurches off, and Monty wanders away with Doyle.Monty and Doyle walk along the streets of NYC, and end up on the campus of what looks like a private prep school. Monty stands looking at a display of sports trophies and old photos, til a school administrator confronts him and tells him to leave with the dog. He tells her that he used to go to this school, and was on the basketball team, was doing well til he was kicked out of the school for fighting. She thaws a little bit as he shows her himself in the photo and says he held some big record. She tells him that record was broken just last year, and she knows because she coaches the girls' team.

The locals warn the group that removing the tablet will end its magic. In present-day New York City, Larry Daley remains the night guard of the American Museum of Natural History. He, Theodore Roosevelt, Sacagawea, Attila the Hun, Jedediah, Octavius, Rexy the Tyrannosaurus rex skeleton and Dexter the capuchin monkey help re-open the Hayden Planetarium. A new wax Neanderthal resembling Larry named Laaa is introduced, identifying Larry as his father. Ahkmenrah shows Larry that the tablet is corroding, which later causes the exhibits to act erratically, causing mayhem at the planetarium's reopening. Afterwards, Larry catches his son Nick, who plans on taking a gap year to sort out his life, throwing a house party. Larry reunites with Cecil, now in retirement, who realizes the end of the tablet's magic will cause the exhibits to become lifeless. Cecil explains that Ahkmenrah's parents, Merenkahre and Shepseheret, may be able to restore the tablet's power but that they are located in the British Museum. Larry convinces the museum's curator, Dr. McPhee, to let him ship Ahkmenrah to London to restore the tablet, convinced that McPhee knows its secrets. Larry and Nick travel to the British Museum, bypassing the night guard Tilly. To Larry's surprise, Roosevelt, Sacagawea, Attila, Jed, Octavius, Dexter and Laaa have come as well, and Laaa is left to stand guard while the others search the museum, the tablet bringing its own exhibits to life.

This area has become one of Tucson's iconic neighborhoods. In 1891, the Fort was abandoned and much of the interior was stripped of their useful components and it quickly fell into ruin. In 1900, three of the officer buildings were purchased for use as a sanitarium. The sanitarium was then sold to Harvey Adkins in 1928. The Bolsius family Pete, Nan and Charles Bolsius purchased and renovated surviving adobe buildings of the Fort – transforming them into spectacular artistic southwestern architectural examples. Their woodwork, plaster treatment and sense of proportion drew on their Dutch heritage and New Mexican experience. Other artists and academics throughout the middle of the 20th century, including: Win Ellis, Jack Maul, Madame Cheruy, Giorgio Belloli, Charels Bode, Veronica Hughart, Edward and Rosamond Spicer, Hazel Larson Archer and Ruth Brown, renovated adobes, built homes and lived in the area. The artist colony attracted writers and poets including beat generation Alan Harrington and Jack Kerouac whose visit is documented in his iconic book On the Road. This rural pocket in the middle of the city is listed on the National Register of Historic Places.

If the first sentence is true, then is the second sentence true?","output":"To determine if the second sentence is true when the first sentence is true, let's examine both sentences step-by-step: Sentence 1: \\"Let's find some place where we can see whether it's impossible now for you to magic up a decent meal.\\" This sentence implies that we are searching for a location to test whether or not it is impossible for a decent meal to be created using magic. This may also imply that there may have been a time when conjuring a decent meal was possible, and we are checking the current situation. Sentence 2: \\"Let's find a place where you can conjure up some chicken.\\" This sentence suggests that we are looking for a location where a magical ability can be used to create or prepare chicken as a meal. Now, let's consider the relationship between these sentences: If we assume the first sentence is true, we are actively seeking a location to determine the feasibility of magically creating meals. If it turns out that it is indeed impossible for me to magic up a decent meal, then the second sentence can not be true, as I would not be able to conjure up some chicken. However, if we find that it is still possible for me to create a meal using magic during our search, then the second sentence would be true, as we could find a location where I can conjure up some chicken using magic. In conclusion, the truth of the second sentence being true depends on the outcome of the search and the current capability of using magic to create a meal.

Each of these categories serves its specific purpose or function, often independent of the entertainment industry. They are characterized by unique attributes; for example, companies are business entities that engage in economic activities, educational institutions provide learning opportunities, athletes participate in sports competitions, and buildings are structures that serve various purposes, such as residential, commercial, or industrial.

Here's the step-by-step process: 1. The speaker says, \\"I don't believe in command and control out of Washington, D.C.\\" This statement suggests that the speaker has opinions about the role of the federal government, but it doesn't necessarily indicate that they work for the federal government. 2. The statement \\"I believe Washington ought to set standards\\" implies the speaker might have knowledge or interest in policymaking. While this may suggest a connection to the federal government, it is not definitive evidence. 3.

We have all seen it…the trolls, the haters, the comment boxes filled with venom and vitriol, typically pointed at people just trying to do good and interesting things. Unfortunately, this conduct can be jarring for many people, with some going as far to give up sharing their creative endeavours so as not to deal with the “wrath of the Internet”. As some of you will know, this has been bothering me for a while now. While there is no silver bullet for solving these issues, one thing I have learned over the years is how to put negative, anti-social, and non-constructive comments and feedback into perspective. To help others with this I have written a free book called Dealing With Disrespect. Dealing With Disrespect is a short, simple to read, free book that provides a straight-forward guide for handling this kind of challenging feedback, picking out the legitimate criticism to learn from, and how to not just ignore the haters, but how to manage them.

Answer the following question: I can use this background: Greenhouse Effect: The solar energy reaching the surface of the Earth is concentrated in short wavelengths, which can easily penetrate the greenhouse gases, such as carbon dioxide and methane. The Earth, however, is cooler than the sun and it radiates its heat in the form of energy in the far infrared range. These longer wavelengths are partially absorbed by the greenhouse gases and some of the solar heat is returned to Earth. At a certain temperature these processes are in equilibrium and the surface temperature of the Earth is stable. However, if more greenhouse gases are put in the atmosphere the amount of trapped terrestrial radiation increases, leading to an increase in global temperature.  Now, I have a new situation: Two friends liked studying about the Earth's atmosphere. Vick studied more about the troposphere, while Frank studied more about the Greenhouse Effect.  Answer this question please: Which friend studied less about carbon dioxide? Answer:","output":"To answer this question, let's take a look at the subjects each friend is studying: 1.

For this method, we'll start with a fully-assembled tank, minus the fish, just like in the method above. However, this time, we won't add the fish until the entire cycle is completed. Instead, we'll add biological waste manually as we monitor the water level and wait for the cycle to complete. This method requires a lot of patience, as it requires you to wait for the organic material you add to your tank to decay and start producing toxic waste products. However, it's often considered a more \\"humane\\" option as it doesn't expose fish to ammonia and nitrites like the method above does. To begin, drop just a few flakes of fish food into your tank — about as much as you'd use to feed your fish will do. Now, simply wait. Over the next few days, the flakes will begin to decay and release waste products (including ammonia) into the water. Use a test kit (or bring a water sample to your local pet store) to test your water for ammonia levels. You want to have a level of at least three parts per million (ppm). If you don't have enough ammonia in your water, add more flakes and wait for them to decay before testing again. Continue to test your water every other day for ammonia levels. As beneficial bacteria begins to grow in your aquarium, it will start to consume the ammonia, reducing the ammonia levels. Replenish them by adding fish flakes whenever the ammonia level falls below three ppm. As the bacteria start consuming ammonia, they'll begin to produce nitrites, the intermediate type of chemical in the nitrate cycle (which is less toxic than ammonia but still harmful to fish). Start testing for nitrites after a week or so — again, you can use a commercial test kit or take water samples to a pet shop to do this. Once you detect nitrites, you'll know the cycle has started. At this point, you'll continue adding ammonia as you have before. As you feed the bacteria in the tank ammonia, the nitrite levels will continue to rise. Eventually, however, enough beneficial bacteria will grow to convert the nitrites into nitrates, the final type of chemical in the nitrate cycle (and one that isn't harmful to fish.) When this happens, you'll know the cycle is nearing completion. You can detect this final phase of the cycle by either testing for nitrites (in which case you're looking for a sudden drop), nitrates (in which case you're looking for a sudden spike from a base level of zero), or both. After about six to eight weeks, the ammonia and nitrite levels should decrease to a level that's so low you can no longer detect them, while nitrate levels should plateau. At this point, it's safe to add your fish.  However, as in the method above, you'll want to add your fish gradually. Don't add more than a few small fish at a time and wait at least a week or two before introducing your next batch of fish. Consider cleaning the substrate with a siphon hose before adding fish, particularly if you had to add a lot of food. Decaying food or plant matter can become a ticking time bomb. If it gets trapped in the gravel, the ammonia won't enter the water, but if something upsets it, it could release a fair amount of ammonia rather quickly. Summary:","output":"In simple words, to start a fish tank without using fish, we need to follow these steps: 1. Set up your tank with everything except the fish. 2. Add a little bit of fish food to the tank; it will break down and create waste. 3. Test the water for ammonia levels, which should be at least three parts per million (ppm). 4. Keep adding fish food and test the water every other day to maintain ammonia levels. 5. After a week, start checking for nitrite levels, which show the cycle has started. 6. Keep adding ammonia, and soon, the bacteria will change nitrites into nitrates (safe for fish). 7. After six to eight weeks, ammonia and nitrite levels should be low, and it's safe to add fish. 8. Add only a few small fish at a time and wait a week before adding more."},{"instruction":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation. Think like you are answering to a five year old.

Help as much as you can. Q:Information:  - In quantum mechanics, a boson is a particle that follows BoseEinstein statistics. Bosons make up one of the two classes of particles, the other being fermions. The name boson was coined by Paul Dirac to commemorate the contribution of the Indian physicist Satyendra Nath Bose in developing, with Einstein, BoseEinstein statisticswhich theorizes the characteristics of elementary particles. Examples of bosons include fundamental particles such as photons, gluons, and W and Z bosons (the four force-carrying gauge bosons of the Standard Model), the recently discovered Higgs boson, and the hypothetical graviton of quantum gravity; composite particles (e.g. mesons and stable nuclei of even mass number such as deuterium (with one proton and one neutron, mass number = 2), helium-4, or lead-208); and some quasiparticles (e.g. Cooper pairs, plasmons, and phonons).  - A quark (or ) is an elementary particle and a fundamental constituent of matter. Quarks combine to form composite particles called hadrons, the most stable of which are protons and neutrons, the components of atomic nuclei. Due to a phenomenon known as \\"color confinement\\", quarks are never directly observed or found in isolation; they can be found only within hadrons, such as baryons (of which protons and neutrons are examples) and mesons. For this reason, much of what is known about quarks has been drawn from observations of the hadrons themselves.  - Gravity, or gravitation, is a natural phenomenon by which all things with mass are brought toward (or \\"gravitate\\" toward) one another, including planets, stars and galaxies. Since energy and mass are equivalent, all forms of energy, including light, also cause gravitation and are under the influence of it. On Earth, gravity gives weight to physical objects and causes the ocean tides. The gravitational attraction of the original gaseous matter present in the Universe caused it to begin coalescing, forming stars  and the stars to group together into galaxies  so gravity is responsible for many of the large scale structures in the Universe. Gravity has an infinite range, although its effects become increasingly weaker on farther objects.  - Particle physics (also high energy physics) is the branch of physics that studies the nature of the particles that constitute \\"matter\\" (particles with mass) and \\"radiation\\" (massless particles). Although the word \\"particle\\" can refer to various types of very small objects (e.g. protons, gas particles, or even household dust), \\"particle physics\\" usually investigates the irreducibly smallest detectable particles and the irreducibly fundamental force fields necessary to explain them. By our current understanding, these elementary particles are excitations of the quantum fields that also govern their interactions. The currently dominant theory explaining these fundamental particles and fields, along with their dynamics, is called the Standard Model. Thus, modern particle physics generally investigates the Standard Model and its various possible extensions, e.g. to the newest \\"known\\" particle, the Higgs boson, or even to the oldest known force field, gravity.  - In particle physics , a hadron i / hædrn / ( Greek :  , hadrós , \`\` stout , thick '' ) is a composite particle made of quarks held together by the strong force ( in a similar way as molecules are held together by the electromagnetic force ) . Hadrons are categorized into two families : baryons , made of three quarks , and mesons , made of one quark and one antiquark . Protons and neutrons are examples of baryons ; pions are an example of a meson . Hadrons containing more than three valence quarks ( exotic hadrons ) have been discovered in recent years . A tetraquark state ( an exotic meson ) , named the Z ( 4430 )  , was discovered in 2007 by the Belle Collaboration and confirmed as a resonance in 2014 by the LHCb collaboration . Two pentaquark states ( exotic baryons ) , named P +  - In particle physics, mesons (or ) are hadronic subatomic particles composed of one quark and one antiquark, bound together by the strong interaction. Because mesons are composed of quark sub-particles, they have a physical size, with a diameter of roughly one fermi, which is about the size of a proton or neutron. All mesons are unstable, with the longest-lived lasting for only a few hundredths of a microsecond. Charged mesons decay (sometimes through mediating particles) to form electrons and neutrinos. Uncharged mesons may decay to photons. Both of these decays imply that color is no longer a property of the byproducts.    What is the relationship between 'hadron' and 'gravity'? A:","output":"The relationship between hadrons and gravity lies in the fact that hadrons, being particles with mass, are subject to gravitational forces. Hadrons, as composite particles made up of quarks, are building blocks of atomic nuclei and thus contribute to the mass of larger structures like atoms and molecules. Gravity, being a natural force that attracts all objects with mass, influences the behavior and interactions of these hadronic particles. However, it is important to note that within the realm of particle physics, gravity has a relatively weak effect compared to other fundamental forces such as the strong nuclear force or the electromagnetic force. Researchers are looking for ways to integrate gravity into the framework of quantum mechanics which currently does not fully explain gravitational interactions, and one of the theories under investigation is quantum gravity. In summary, the relationship between hadrons and gravity is that hadrons are subject to gravitational forces due to their mass, but the study and understanding of that relationship remains an open and challenging area in physics."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant, who knows every language and how to translate one language to another.

(June 2015) Stella (Bette Midler) is a feisty woman working in a bar when she meets and falls for the suave charms of the young Dr. Steve Dallas (Stephen Collins). Although from opposite ends of the social spectrum, they start an affair resulting in Stella becoming pregnant. After he proposes half-heartedly, she rejects him and embarks upon raising their child Jenny as a single mother but is always helped and encouraged by her stalwart friend, a local good natured barfly, Ed Munn (John Goodman). Stella is fiercely independent and proud and is determined to do well by this child and take on whatever jobs she must to raise her daughter properly. When Jenny is 4 years old, her father suddenly reappears on the scene and is determined to get to know his daughter. At first reluctant to allow this, Stella is persuaded to allow contact, and a happy bond develops between the father and daughter. As Jenny (Trini Alvarado) grows up, she becomes torn between her father's rich and well-connected background, and her loyalty and love for her mother who is poor and vulgar but devoted to her daughter. She also despises the perceived relationship she sees developing between Stella and Ed Munn who is now a broken alcoholic. Jenny eventually meets and falls for a boy from her fathers 'world' and Stella realizes that now, the disparities in her own and Jennys father's backgrounds might jeopardize her daughter's future happiness. So she makes a heart rending decision towards the end of the film to ensure that this is not going to happen.

Is \\"Bohr solved this paradox with explicit reference to Planck's work: an electron in a Bohr atom could only have certain defined energies En\\" the correct answer? Options are: (a). yes (b). no","output":"(b). No Although the statement provided is related to the quantized model of the atom, it is not the complete answer to the question of who introduced the first quantized model of the atom. The first quantized (or quantum) model of the atom was introduced by Danish physicist Niels Bohr in 1913. Bohr's model was a major advancement in the understanding of atomic structure and played a significant role in the development of quantum mechanics. While it is true that Bohr's model involved the quantization of energy levels, the provided statement only focuses on a specific aspect of the model. In his quantum model, Niels Bohr proposed that electrons orbit the nucleus in fixed paths, or orbits, with specific, quantized energy levels. This means that electrons could only exist in these orbits and could not exist between them. To move between these orbits, electrons must gain or lose specific, quantized amounts of energy in the form of photons. Bohr's model was primarily aimed at explaining the behavior of the hydrogen atom and its ability to emit and absorb light in discrete wavelengths, as observed in spectral lines. Indeed, Bohr did make explicit reference to Max Planck's work on quantized energy levels and applied the same concept to the atomic model. Planck's work on black-body radiation is foundational to quantum mechanics as it showed that energy was not continuous, but rather discrete and quantized in the form of packets called quanta. In summary, Niels Bohr introduced the first quantized model of the atom in 1913, and his model included the idea of quantized energy levels for electrons based on Max Planck's work. The provided statement only describes a portion of this model and does not fully answer the question."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant that follows instruction extremely well.

Brian was very creative and brave.","output":"Once upon a time in a small town named Breezyville, there was a young boy named Brian. Brian was known throughout the town, not only for his wild, curly hair but also for his boundless imagination and incredible courage. Every day before school, Brian would create new gadgets and gizmos to share with his friends. He transformed the mundane daily routine of walking to school into an exciting adventure, each day filled with wonder and awe. One early morning, as autumn leaves danced around him, Brian had a sudden burst of inspiration. He decided he was going to build a flying machine. He hoped his invention would allow him and his friends to traverse the skies and explore new heights together. In his backyard, Brian began to gather items to construct his flying contraption: bicycle wheels, wood scraps, and an old laundry basket. He toiled away, carefully following the blueprint conjured by his young mind, and night after night, he worked tirelessly. As the days passed, whispers of Brian's project slowly spread around the small town. Breezyville buzzed with curiosity, and people spoke with a mix of excitement and disbelief about the young boy's ambition. But Brian was undeterred by the murmurs and continued steadfastly with his creation. With the townspeople's skepticism beginning to seep into their consciousness, Brian's loyal group of friends felt their confidence falter. Yet, Brian's unwavering resolve motivated them all to believe in his dream. Finally, after weeks of meticulous work, the day arrived when Brian's flying machine stood tall and proud in his backyard, complete with wings made of sturdy fabric, an engine made of old lawnmower parts, and a steering wheel fashioned from a bicycle handle. The townspeople of Breezyville gathered to witness this extraordinary event. Doubts filled the air like dense fog, but Brian, feeling the weight of the moment, climbed into the machine with a sense of determination he had never felt before. His friends cheered him on, their confidence in him renewed. Brian started the engine, and the flying machine shuddered to life. With a smile on his face and a glint of exhilaration in his eyes, Brian raised the machine off the ground and soared into the sky. As the crowd gasped and stared in awe, Brian navigated his flying contraption through the clouds, navigating the vast expanse above the town. His friends could not help but cheer louder, tears of joy streaming down their faces. It was then that they realized they had underestimated their curly-haired friend – for Brian was very creative and brave."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant. User will you give you a task.

Do those questions have the same meaning? Select from the following. I. no. II. yes.","output":"Covalent bonds and ionic bonds are two different types of chemical bonds that can occur between atoms. 1. Covalent bonds are formed when two atoms share one or more pairs of electrons. To understand the process step-by-step, let's take a look at the following:     Step 1: Two atoms come close to one another, usually nonmetals with similar electronegativities.     Step 2: The atoms attract each other's valence (outer shell) electrons.     Step 3: The atoms achieve a more stable electron configuration by sharing one or more pairs of electrons.     Step 4: The shared electrons form a cloud of electron density between the nuclei, holding the atoms together in a covalently bonded molecule. 2. Ionic bonds are formed when one or more electrons are transferred from one atom to another. Let's break down the process:     Step 1: A metal atom with one or few valence electrons comes close to a nonmetal atom with a nearly full valence shell.     Step 2: The metal atom loses electrons, becoming a positive ion (cation), while the nonmetal atom gains electrons, becoming a negative ion (anion).     Step 3: The oppositely charged ions attract each other, forming an ionic bond in a compound known as an ionic solid or salt. Now, addressing the question about whether the two original questions have the same meaning, we can select the answer: I. no. The two questions deal with distinct types of chemical bonds – covalent and ionic – and describe different processes to form compounds. Hence, the questions do not have the same meaning."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant. User will you give you a task. Your goal is to complete the task as faithfully as you can.

Imagine a ball bouncing off a surface. Light can do the same thing. That is, assuming the surface is shiny. So how do you know where light will go after it strikes a shiny surface? It depends on how the light initially strikes the shiny object. Light does not always go straight toward a surface. Therefore, not all light bounces straight back. Sometimes, light can hit a surface at an angle. The angle at which it strikes the surface tells us how it will bounce off. While light is different to a ball, they react in a similar manner. Many sports rely on knowledge of reflection. Pool players know a lot about reflection. They take great care when they strike the pool ball. They need it to go to a certain place. They know the angle it will hit the side of the pool table.

Please answer the following question: You are given a new situation: Students working on their thesis for graduate school decide that they will write about the differences between two identical plants, but they will infect one of the plants with a fungus. This fungus will create a mycorrhizal association between one of the plants and the fungus. After caring for the plants, the students have grown fond of them and given them names. They have named one of them Audrey and the other Baudrey. They flip a coin to decide which plant will be infected with the fungus, and fate has decided that Audrey will have the fungus grow on it. Baudrey will be left to grow naturally.  and a hint : A mycorrhiza (Greek for \\"fungus roots\\") is a symbiotic association between a fungus and the roots of a plant. In a mycorrhizal association, the fungus may colonize the roots of a host plant by either growing directly into the root cells, or by growing around the root cells. This association provides the fungus with relatively constant and direct access to glucose, which the plant produces by photosynthesis. The mycelia of the fungi increase the surface area of the plant’s root system. The larger surface area improves water and mineral nutrient absorption from the soil.  Please answer this question : Which plant's roots will have more surface area? Answer:","output":"In this situation, we have two plants, Audrey and Baudrey. Audrey will be infected with a fungus that creates a mycorrhizal association, whereas Baudrey will grow naturally without the fungus. To determine which plant's roots will have more surface area, we need to consider the effects of the mycorrhizal association. Step 1: Understand the mycorrhizal association From the hint given, a mycorrhizal association is a symbiotic relationship between a fungus and the roots of a plant. The fungus colonizes the plant roots, providing increased surface area for the roots and, in turn, improves water and mineral nutrient absorption from the soil. Step 2: Analyze the impact on root surface area With the mycorrhizal association present in Audrey's roots, Audrey gains the advantage of a larger root surface area due to the presence of the fungus. Baudrey, on the other hand, grows naturally without the fungus, and therefore its root surface area remains unchanged. Step 3: Compare Audrey's and Baudrey's root surface area Considering that the mycorrhizal association increases the plant's root surface area and Audrey is the plant with this association, Audrey's roots will have more surface area compared to Baudrey."},{"instruction":"Given the question: \\"Sparganothis richersi\\", given a list of categories: company, educational institution, artist, athlete, office holder, mean of transportation, building, natural place, village, animal, plant, album, film or written work, what category does the title belong to?

Write an article based on this summary: Rinse out your nose. Take nonprescription antihistamines. Try taking a decongestant. Talk with your doctor. Consider an allergy shot. Article:","output":"Title: A Comprehensive Guide to Dealing with Seasonal Allergies: Tips and Tricks for Clearing Your Sinuses Introduction As the seasons change and the blossoming flowers fill the air with pollen, millions of people around the world find themselves struggling with seasonal allergies. These allergies can range from mildly annoying to severely debilitating, affecting a person's quality of life. In an attempt to help, we have compiled a comprehensive guide on how to combat seasonal allergies, and take control of your sinus health.  1. Rinse Out Your Nose A simple yet effective method for alleviating allergy symptoms is to regularly rinse your nose. By using a nasal irrigation solution, such as a saline solution, you can flush out the build-up of allergens and excess mucus from your nasal passages. This method not only provides relief from congestion but also reduces inflammation in your sinuses. To use a nasal rinse, you can opt for various methods such as a neti pot, a squeeze bottle, or a bulb syringe. While preparing the saline solution, ensure you only use distilled or previously boiled water. After use, always clean your equipment to prevent any bacterial growth. 2. Take Nonprescription Antihistamines Antihistamines are medications that fundamentally counter the effects of histamine, a substance produced by the body during an allergic reaction. By blocking histamine, antihistamines help to alleviate the symptoms of allergies such as sneezing, runny nose, and itching. Several over-the-counter antihistamines are available, including Loratadine (Claritin), Cetirizine (Zyrtec), and Fexofenadine (Allegra). When purchasing antihistamine medication, make sure to read the labels and choose the correct dosage. Consult your doctor if you are pregnant, nursing or have other existing medical conditions before using antihistamines. 3. Try Taking a Decongestant If your seasonal allergies are causing moderate to severe congestion, you might benefit from taking a decongestant. Decongestants work by narrowing blood vessels in your nasal passages, thereby reducing swelling and congestion. However, they may provide only short-term relief, so it is not recommended to use them for prolonged periods. Common over-the-counter decongestants include pseudoephedrine (Sudafed) and phenylephrine (Neo-Synephrine). Like with antihistamines, be sure to choose the correct dosage and consult a healthcare professional if you have any concerns or pre-existing medical conditions. 4. Talk With Your Doctor If your seasonal allergy symptoms persist despite trying the above methods, or if you are experiencing severe symptoms, make sure to consult your healthcare provider. They can assess your condition and recommend further treatments. In some cases, your doctor might prescribe a prescription-strength medication or combination therapy to provide relief. 5. Consider an Allergy Shot Allergy shots (immunotherapy) are another potential solution for individuals who suffer from severe or chronic seasonal allergies. This treatment involves injecting small amounts of allergens into the patient's body to help the immune system build tolerance gradually. Over time, this process can result in decreased sensitivity to allergens, leading to a reduction in allergy symptoms. Before opting for allergy shots, it is essential to consult your doctor to ensure this treatment is suitable for your specific situation. Immunotherapy may involve numerous injections over several years, depending on the severity of the allergies and the frequency of treatments recommended. Conclusion Seasonal allergies can be a challenging, uncomfortable experience, but with the help of the strategies outlined in this article, you can alleviate your symptoms and enjoy the changing beauty of the seasons. Remember to consult your healthcare provider before trying new medications or treatments, and most importantly, listen to your body and take care of your health."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

If he drives both for an hour on the freeway, which will have gone the smaller distance? (A) truck (B) car.  What is the most sensical answer between \\"Truck\\" and  \\"Car\\"? Answer:","output":"The most sensical answer between \\"Truck\\" and \\"Car\\" would be (A) truck. In the given short story, it is mentioned that Mike's truck is slower than his car. To determine which vehicle will have gone the smaller distance when both are driven for an hour on the freeway, we need to consider the speed of each vehicle. This is because the distance covered by a vehicle in motion is directly proportional to its speed and time taken. We know that: - Mike's truck is slower than his car. - Both are driven for an hour on the freeway. From this information, we can deduce the following: When two vehicles travel for an equal amount of time, the one with a slower speed will cover less distance compared to the faster vehicle. As Mike's truck is slower than his car, it will take the truck a longer amount of time to cover the same distance that the car can cover in a shorter time. Therefore, when both vehicles are driven for an hour on the freeway, Mike's truck will have gone a smaller distance compared to his car.

For most rock bands, the pursuit of wisdom's a low priority compared to fame, fortune and fornication. Such a band was Strange Fruit.\\" Thus begins the opening dialog of Hughie, (Billy Connolly) as he launches into a brief history of the British band: in the late 1970's Strange Fruit, consisting of guitarist Brian Lovell (Bruce Robinson), his brother and lead singer Keith, keyboard player Tony Costello (Stephen Rea), bassist Les Wickes (Jimmy Nail) and drummer Beano Baggot (Timothy Spall) were HUGE. When Keith died of a drug overdose, he was replaced on vocals by Ray Simms (Bill Nighy). Watched over by road-dog Hughie and Girl Friday Karen (Juliet Aubrey), they soldiered on until the disastrous appearance at the open-air Wisbech (U.K.) Rock Festival, when lightning struck the stage during their opening number. The already-contentious band members decided it was a sign and immediately broke up forever (all this in the first five minutes of the film). Forever, that is, until in the present (OK, 1998) Tony is spotted on Ibeza (he now stocks condoms in the restrooms at the resorts there) by the son of the Wisbech promoter, who wants to put together a 20th anniversary reunion concert with all the original acts. Tony seeks out Karen, now a divorced mother who coordinates conferences for a major hotel, suggesting a possible reunion. She is ambivalent, as is Les (now a successful roofer with a family) and Ray (a struggling solo artist with a demanding second wife -- Swedish -- and a mansion he can't afford). Beano, working in a floral nursery and hounded by the Inland Revenue (the U.K.'s IRS) is the only immediately enthusiastic bandmate. They arrange a meeting, where Karen informs them that she's tracked Brian and found his music royalties are being distributed per a bequest in his will, provoking Beano to compassionately ask if that means \\"the silly sod's dead?\\" The band again soldiers on.

I don't want to cause a scene, or start a barrage of backlash from people claiming that it worked for them. Instead, I will present the facts and let you decide for yourself if it is worth doing.

If you are going to 'detox' by simply eating healthily then all power to you. That will most definitely do wonders for your body. These detox kits won't. They will produce results; however, the results will be temporary. Why detoxes don't work Firstly, the companies who are marketing the detoxes talk about removing toxins that have built up in the body. So, what are these toxins? They don't say. They remain vague and just leave you to let your imagination run wild. Do they mean chemicals, waste products from digestion, bacteria? I guess I imagined it as the waste products from digestion but it would be interesting to hear what other people perceive as the 'toxins' in their bodies. I read an interesting article on British Beauty Blogger about how Veet gave Chinese women a problem they never had. Chinese women naturally have very little body hair so hair removal products have always been poor sellers. Therefore, Reckitt Benckiser (who own Veet) devised  a marketing campaign to convince Chinese that any body hair is unsightly and released ads equating hair free skin with health, confidence and \\"shining glory\\" (the full marketing concept can be read here). I feel that this is the same as what is happening in regards to detoxes. The marketers of the products have convinced us that our bodies are full of these so called 'toxins', from our unhealthy lifestyles, that need to be removed with a detox.

Which topic is this article about? Choices: (a). World; (b). Sports; (c). Business; (d). Science/Tech;","output":"This article is about topic (c). Business. The article highlights the current trend of venture capitalists scaling back their investments in the third quarter. Venture capitalists are vital components in the business world as they provide financial backing for new and innovative startups that may have difficulty obtaining traditional financing. This reduction in investment suggests that venture capitalists are exercising more caution and restraint, perhaps to avoid the consequences and pitfalls that occurred during the dot-com boom. During the dot-com boom in the late 1990s and early 2000s, there was a significant increase in investment in internet-based companies. Venture capitalists played a crucial role in funding these high-tech startups, hoping to capitalize on the rapid growth of the burgeoning internet industry. Unfortunately, this excessive investment led to the eventual burst of the dot-com bubble, causing many companies to fail and billions of dollars to be lost, resulting in a widespread impact on the business world and economy. In response to these past errors, venture capitalists are now taking a more sober approach to investing in high-tech startups, considering the risks and potential downsides more closely. This cautious attitude may also be influenced by the current economic climate and various global factors that can directly affect businesses and their growth prospects. By choosing to implement a more conservative investment strategy, venture capitalists protect themselves, their investors, and the businesses they back from potential risks and financial losses. This shift in risk tolerance and behavior supports long-term growth, stability, and sustainability in the business world, specifically concerning the high-tech startup industry. In conclusion, the article addresses a critical aspect of the business sector - venture capital investments and their impact on high-tech startups. It emphasizes the importance of responsible and cautious investment decisions made by venture capitalists to ensure a more stable and sustainable business environment in the future. As such, this article falls under the business category (c)."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant. You will be given a task. You must generate a detailed and long answer.

Let's analyze each part separately for a better understanding: 1. Premise: A youth standing next to a metal fence with a black shirt on and a cigarette in their mouth. In the premise, we are given a scenario where a youth is standing near a metal fence while wearing a black shirt and holding a cigarette in their mouth. This scenario implies that the youth is awake and engaged in an activity at the particular moment described. We can understand the situation, location, and attire of the youth.  2. Hypothesis: A young man is in his bed sleeping. The hypothesis portrays a different scenario altogether. Here, a young man is depicted to be in bed and sleeping. This suggests that it's a completely separate time and perhaps a different location, as the young man is mentioned to be asleep, contrary to the premise that showed the youth being awake. To conclude, we cannot determine if the hypothesis is true or false based on the premise provided.

As the stories are sometimes movie plots, they will contain actor names in parentheses. You should not use those names. Only use character names. Try to ask a question about all parts of the plot, not just the beginning.  An elderly woman tells her granddaughter a bedtime story of where snow comes from, by telling her the story of a young man named Edward who has scissors for hands. As the creation of an old Inventor, Edward was a human-like boy who was in the penultimate stage of work. The Inventor homeschooled Edward, but suffered a fatal heart attack and died just as he was about to fasten hands on Edward. Local Avon saleswoman Peg Boggs visits the decrepit Gothic mansion on the hill where Edward lives. She finds Edward alone   at first startled, but, upon realizing he means well and is virtually harmless, takes him to her home. Edward becomes friends with Peg's young son Kevin and her husband Bill. He later falls in love with the Boggs' beautiful teenage daughter Kim, despite her initial fear of him. Peg's neighbors are impressed by Edward's adept hedge-trimming and hair-cutting skills, though an eccentric religious fanatic named Esmeralda and Kim's overbearing boyfriend Jim are fearful and contemptuous of him. Joyce, an ageing, unfaithful housewife in the Boggs' neighborhood, has become fascinated with Edward and suggests that Edward open a hair-cutting salon with her. While examining a proposed site, she attempts to seduce him in the back room, causing Edward to leave in a panic, and Joyce rumoring of him trying to rape her. Wanting money for a van, Jim takes advantage of Edward's ability to pick locks to break into his parents' house to steal from his wealthy but bullying father. The burglar alarm sounds and everyone except Edward flees after he is trapped by the automatic locks triggered by the alarm, despite Kim's insistence that they return for him, as the police have him arrested. He is released when a psychological examination reveals that his isolation allowed him to live without a sense of reality and common sense. Upon questioning by Peg, Edward takes full blame for the robbery, and is scrutinized for his behavior, believed to have committed the robbery as earlier he was denied a bank loan for his hair salon. During Christmas, Edward is cast out by almost everyone except the Boggs family. When Edward returns home, he reveals that he knew it was Jim's house and that he did it because she asked him to, much to Kim's shock. While the family is setting up Christmas decorations, Edward creates a large angel ice sculpture (modelled on Kim). The shavings create an effect of falling snow, which Kim dances under. Jim arrives and calls out to Edward, startling him, resulting in Edward accidentally cutting Kim's hand. Jim accuses Edward of intentionally harming her and attacks him which causes Kim who is finally fed up with Jim's jealousy towards Edward to break up with him. Edward runs away, wandering the neighborhood in a rage, ruining one of his earlier hedge works, pokes a hole in the tire on someone's car, and trims a bush in Esmeralda's front yard into the shape of the devil. However, when a shaggy puppy comes near, Edward calms down, smiles at the dog and give it a trim. While Peg and Bill search for Edward, he returns and finds Kim alone in the Boggs' house. She asks Edward to hold her, but he is afraid that he will hurt her again   she pulls his arms around her and they embrace. Jim returns to the Boggs' house in a drunken rage to confront Kim, forcing his friend to drive his van while inebriated. Kevin is almost run over, but Edward pushes him out of the way, cutting Kevin's arms and face, causing witnesses to think he is attacking him. Jim then attacks him furiously and Edward cuts Jim's right arm. When the police arrive, Edward flees to the mansion as the neighbors pursue. Kim runs to the mansion, reuniting with Edward. Jim follows her and attacks them with a handgun, beating Edward severely, who refuses to fight until Jim strikes Kim across the face when she intervenes. Edward stabs Jim in the stomach and pushes him to fall out of a window to his death. Kim confesses her love for Edward and they share a kiss before saying goodbye. Kim tells the townspeople that Edward and Jim fought each other to death and tells them that the roof caved in on Edward, showing them a discarded scissor-hand from the Inventor's lab. The neighbors return home with Joyce feeling guilty for framing Edward and causing the neighbors to hate him. The elderly woman finishes telling her granddaughter the story, revealing that she is Kim and saying that she never saw Edward again. She chose not to visit him because decades have passed and she wanted him to remember her the way she was in her youth. She believes that Edward is still alive, immortal because he is artificial, and because of the winter \\"snow\\" that Edward creates by carving ice sculptures that scatter shavings over the neighborhood, and remind her of dancing in the snow long ago.","output":"What specific skills of Edward impress Peg's neighbors, and what business idea does Joyce propose to Edward based on these skills?"},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

The structure is a Grade I listed building and protected as a Scheduled Monument.  The construction of a nearby tithe barn is not documented, but it was probably built between 1600 and 1720. It was used for storage of the local tithes (a tenth of a farm's produce).  Along with Radcliffe Tower, the Parish Church of St Mary is a Grade I listed building.  The town also has two Grade II* listed buildings; Dearden Fold Farmhouse, completed during the 16th century, and Radcliffe Cenotaph, built in 1922 to commemorate the First World War.  Outwood Viaduct, and Radcliffe's most visible landmark, St Thomas' Church, are Grade II listed buildings.  St Thomas' took nine years to complete. The first stone was laid by Viscount Grey de Wilton (grandson of the Countess Grosvenor) on 21 July 1862, and it was consecrated in 1864 by the first Bishop of Manchester, James Prince Lee.  Construction of the tower began in 1870 and the building was completed in 1871.  The building cost £7,273, (£670 thousand today) and the tower cost £1,800 (£160 thousand today). The first vicar was the Reverend Robert Fletcher. Radcliffe's first public ornament was a drinking fountain located at the bottom of Radcliffe New Road.  It was presented to the town by a Mrs Noah Rostron in memory of her husband, and erected in August 1896.  The fountain no longer exists at this location.

What are diction examples in literature? Please tell me if those questions are the same. Choose from:  a). no  b). yes","output":"In order to answer the questions, I will first analyze and respond to them one at a time. 1. What are some examples of mockery in literature? Step 1: Identify the concept of mockery in literature Mockery in literature refers to instances where authors use humor, sarcasm, or ridicule to point out the flaws, absurdities, or weaknesses in a character, situation, or idea. Step 2: Provide examples of mockery in literature a) In Jonathan Swift's \\"Gulliver's Travels,\\" the author mocks the political and social systems of his time by describing ridiculous and absurd societies in various fictional lands, such as Lilliput and Brobdingnag. b) In George Orwell's \\"Animal Farm,\\" the author uses satire and irony to mock the events leading up to the Russian Revolution and the early years of the Soviet Union. c) In Jane Austen's \\"Pride and Prejudice,\\" the character of Mr. Bennet frequently uses sarcasm and wit to ridicule the foolish behavior and attitudes of his wife and some of his daughters. 2. What are diction examples in literature? Step 1: Define diction in literature Diction refers to an author's choice of words and the style of expression in a literary work. Step 2: Provide examples of diction in literature a) In William Shakespeare's \\"Hamlet,\\" the formal and poetic diction serves to heighten the sense of tragedy and emotion in the play, as demonstrated in Hamlet's famous soliloquy: \\"To be, or not to be, that is the question.\\" b) In J.D. Salinger's \\"The Catcher in the Rye,\\" the informal, colloquial diction reflects the voice of the teenage protagonist, Holden Caulfield, as he narrates his experiences and thoughts: \\"If you really want to hear about it, the first thing you'll probably want to know is where I was born and what my lousy childhood was like…\\" c) In Cormac McCarthy's \\"The Road,\\" the simple and minimalist diction reflects the bleak, desolate nature of a post-apocalyptic world: \\"The world shrinking down about a raw core of parsible entities. The names of things slowly following those things into oblivion. Colors. The names of birds.\\" As for determining if these questions are the same: - Question 1 asks for examples of mockery (satire, humor, and ridicule) in literature. - Question 2 asks for examples of diction (choices of words and styles of expression) in literature. Given that the two questions address different concepts in literature, I conclude that they are not the same: a) no"},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant. User will you give you a task.

Let's break down the various components of the statement and analyze why the sentiment tilts towards the negative side despite having some positive elements. 1. \\"even if it is generally amusing from time to time\\": This part of the phrase has a positive tone, as it acknowledges that there are moments when the content or scenes in the action comedy titled \\"i spy\\" can be considered amusing. The occurrence of amusement in the movie suggests that it has moments that can be enjoyed by the audience. 2. \\"i spy has all the same problems\\": Here, the sentiment becomes negative, as the phrase points out that the movie shares the same problems as its counterparts in the genre. This observation indicates that the movie might fail to stand out or offer something unique and novel. 3. \\"the majority of action comedies have\\": This part further strengthens the negative sentiment. It emphasizes that the movie does not deviate from the common problems most action comedies face. It implies that \\"i spy\\" does not effectively break free from the usual pitfalls, tropes, and formulaic approaches of the genre. This statement can lead to the perception that \\"i spy\\" is a mediocre or unremarkable movie. In conclusion, the given phrase carries a mixed sentiment, having both positive and negative qualities. However, the negative elements take precedence, as they address the overall experience of watching the movie and how it compares to others in the genre. The phrase presents \\"i spy\\" as an action comedy with some entertaining moments, but one that ultimately falls into the same traps and issues that plague the majority of films in this genre."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Please answer the following question: I know that the answer to the question \\"Who should have taken charge of making sure segregation didn't happen?\\" is in \\"On August 18, 1970, the NAACP filed suit against Michigan state officials, including Governor William Milliken, charging de facto public school segregation. The NAACP argued that although schools were not legally segregated, the city of Detroit and its surrounding counties had enacted policies to maintain racial segregation in public schools. The NAACP also suggested a direct relationship between unfair housing practices and educational segregation, which followed segregated neighborhoods. The District Court held all levels of government accountable for the segregation in its ruling. The Sixth Circuit Court affirmed some of the decision, holding that it was the state's responsibility to integrate across the segregated metropolitan area. The U.S. Supreme Court took up the case February 27, 1974. The subsequent Milliken v. Bradley decision had wide national influence. In a narrow decision, the Court found that schools were a subject of local control and that suburbs could not be forced to solve problems in the city's school district.\\". Can you tell me what it is? A:","output":"The answer to the question \\"Who should have taken charge of making sure segregation didn't happen?\\" in the context provided can be found within the Milliken v. Bradley case decision and its proceedings. In this case, multiple levels of government were held accountable for segregation in schools. The District Court held all levels of government - local, state, and federal - responsible for the segregation, implying that all these institutions should have taken charge in ensuring that segregation didn't happen in the first place. The Sixth Circuit Court also agreed, to some extent, stating that it was the state's responsibility to integrate schools across the segregated metropolitan area. This decision suggests that the state government should have taken the lead role in addressing and preventing school segregation. Furthermore, the NAACP, which filed the lawsuit, argued that both the city of Detroit and its surrounding counties had enacted policies that maintained racial segregation in public schools. Therefore, it could also be inferred that local governments and policymakers should have taken charge in preventing segregation from happening. In summary, the answer to the question is that multiple levels of government, including local, state, and federal, should have taken charge of making sure segregation didn't happen according to the court rulings and arguments made in the Milliken v. Bradley case."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant. User will you give you a task. Your goal is to complete the task as faithfully as you can.

Detailed Instructions: In this task, you are given commands (in terms of logical operations) to select relevant rows from the given table. Your job is to classify the command into one of these seven categories: (1) majority, (2) unique, (3) superlative, (4) count, (5) comparative, (6) aggregation, and (7) ordinal.   Here are the defications of each category:   1. majority: Describing the majority values (most or all) over one column, with the scope of all table rows or a subset of rows   2. unique: Describing one unique row, regarding one column, with the scope of all table rows or a subset of rows   3. Superlative: Describing the maximum or minimum value in a column, with the scope of all table rows or a subset of rows   4. Ordinal: Describing the n-th maximum or minimum value in a column, with the scope of all table rows or a subset of rows   5. Comparative: Comparing two rows in the table, regarding their values in one column   6. Count: counting some rows in the table based on the values in one column, with the scope of all table rows or a subset of rows   7. Aggregation: Describing the sum or average value over a column, with the scope of all table rows or a subset of rows.   Here are the definitions of logical operators for understanding of command:   1. count: returns the number of rows in the view.   2. only: returns whether there is exactly one row in the view.   3. hop: returns the value under the header column of the row.   4. and: returns the boolean operation result of two arguments.   5. max/min/avg/sum: returns the max/min/average/sum of the values under the header column.   6. nth_max/nth_min: returns the n-th max/n-th min of the values under the header column.   7. argmax/argmin: returns the row with the max/min value in header column.   8. nth_argmax/nth_argmin: returns the row with the n-th max/min value in header column.   9. eq/not_eq: returns if the two arguments are equal.   10. round_eq: returns if the two arguments are roughly equal under certain tolerance.   11. greater/less: returns if the first argument is greater/less than the second argument.   12. diff: returns the difference between two arguments.   13. filter_eq/ filter_not_eq: returns the subview whose values under the header column is equal/not equal to the third argument.   14. filter_greater/filter_less: returns the subview whose values under the header column is greater/less than the third argument.   15. filter_greater_eq /filter_less_eq: returns the subview whose values under the header column is greater/less or equal than the third argument.   16. filter_all: returns the view itself for the case of describing the whole table   17. all_eq/not_eq: returns whether all the values under the header column are equal/not equal to the third argument.   18. all_greater/less: returns whether all the values under the header column are greater/less than the third argument.   19. all_greater_eq/less_eq: returns whether all the values under the header column are greater/less or equal to the third argument.   20. most_eq/not_eq: returns whether most of the values under the header column are equal/not equal to the third argument.   21. most_greater/less: returns whether most of the values under the header column are greater/less than the third argument.   22. most_greater_eq/less_eq: returns whether most of the values under the header column are greater/less or equal to the third argument.

The command is \\"eq { count { filter_all { all_rows ; name } } ; 13 }\\". Using the definitions provided, consider the logical operations: 1. filter_all: returns the view itself for the case of describing the whole table. This operation is used with all_rows and the \\"name\\" column, which means it's considering the entire table for the given column. 2. count: returns the number of rows in the view. This operation is applied to the subview that is considering the entire table for the \\"name\\" column. 3. eq: returns if the two arguments are equal. In this case, it's comparing the count from the previous operation with the number 13. The command is checking if there are exactly 13 rows in the table for the \\"name\\" column, which is a count-based operation.
