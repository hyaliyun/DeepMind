Think like you are answering to a five year old. News article: This was one the polls got right.      Heading into Ohio, various surveys showed the race there as a statistical tie, and it did not disappoint:Mitt Romney won, but just narrowly, over Rick Santorum, by a single percentage point.      Text Size -      +      reset Winners & Losers in 60 seconds      And that wasn’t even the whole Super Tuesday story. Here are POLITICO’s five takeaways from the 10-state political extravaganza:      1. Win, no bounce, repeat, continued      It’s better to win ugly than to lose pretty, especially in a key fall battleground state like Ohio. But the victory that Mitt Romney eked out Tuesday night over Rick Santorum in Ohio was far closer than his campaign would have liked.      With six states captured on the night — Alaska, Idaho, Massachusetts, Ohio, Vermont and Virginia — the front-runner is poised to take a majority of the 437 delegates up for grabs on Super Tuesday. He remains the delegate leader, and he scored big in Massachusetts, Virginia and Idaho on that front.      (See also: 2012 delegate tracker)      And yet.      Romney, as we’ve written before, is likely heading into another bounce-free news cycle. The former Massachusetts governor’s campaign and its backers had hoped to use a strong night to start making the case that it’s time to wind this down, and his election night speech, delivered from Boston, was supposed to convey the aura of a nominee-in-waiting.      But in the end, he underperformed. He does not head into Wednesday with the spin on his side, and his campaign has done little to finesse expectations throughout this race. The muddled results Tuesday — Romney’s cache of victories, Newt Gingrich’s win in Georgia and Santorum’s surprisingly strong clinch in Tennessee accompanied by wins in Oklahoma and North Dakota — are going to do little to bring an immediate end to the primary.      The Ohio exit polls showed Romney is still struggling with working-class voters and evangelicals, as well as “very conservative” voters. He and his supporting super PAC also outspent Santorum 4 to 1 for a win of less than 15,000 votes. Losing Tennessee by a wide margin, after his campaign had hoped he would be competitive there, was also a blow: Had he taken the state, he could have essentially argued that, coupled with his Ohio win, the race was effectively over.      But he continues to have trouble in the South, traditional Republican territory. Romney now heads into a less-than-friendly patch of contests, with Kansas, Alabama and Mississippi up in the next week. That’s going to be a tough narrative for him to overcome. Worse, it will generate ongoing headlines about a failure to close the deal, even though most people — a majority of primary voters — agree that Romney is the eventual nominee. ||||| Mitt Romney’s margins in Michigan and Ohio — the Associated Press has called Ohio for Mr. Romney, although The New York Times has not yet – weren’t much different from one another: 3.2 percentage points in the former state, and 1.0 percentage points in the latter.      But the benefit of winning a state is mostly symbolic, especially in a state like Ohio which divides most of its delegates by Congressional district and the remainder proportionately. And the aesthetics of Ohio and Michigan were much different, although for somewhat arbitrary reasons.      Michigan counted its vote very quickly, and Mr. Romney led almost the whole way along — often by slightly larger than the 3.2 point margin that he wound up with.      Ohio counted its vote slowly, and Mr. Romney trailed for most of the evening, sometimes by as many as 3 or 4 points.      In Michigan, Mr. Romney’s win came by a slightly larger margin than polls expected, but the difference was in well within most survey’s margin of error. In Ohio, Mr. Romney leads by a slightly smaller margin than some polls called for, but the polling average was nevertheless very close.      Mr. Romney’s narrow win in Michigan came at a time when his campaign seemed to be struggling. His probable win in Ohio came when he seemed to have the momentum and expectations were higher.      In Michigan, there was nothing else to look at except for that state’s results — that and Arizona, where Mr. Romney did very well. But on Tuesday night, Mr. Romney had lost four other states by the time that the A.P. called Ohio, changing the context that Ohio was viewed in.      Should any of this matter? In my view, it probably shouldn’t. In fact, I tend to find Mr. Romney’s one-point lead in Ohio more impressive than his three-point win in Michigan since the latter was his home state — something that is probably worth at least several points to him.      But, factors like these do affect the way that the results are reported upon and can therefore affect the momentum of the race, for better or for worse.      — NATE SILVER ||||| John GilmoreArchive-It Partner Since: Apr, 2007Organization Type: Other InstitutionsOrganization URL: http://www.toad.com John Gilmore is a private individual who cares about archiving the Internet for future generations.

Yes, it was.            1) Mitt Romney has the same rural problem that Barack Obama does. Here's the map of Ohio from last night's primary.      Here's the map from 2008, an unusually good Democratic year.            Both candidates figured out a pretty simple lesson: Get more votes where people live, don't lose too many votes where people don't. But a county map of the primary so far, even if it excludes Missouri, reveals only urban and suburban areas breaking for Romney. The rural areas that build up any eventual nominee's margin -- all for the other guys.            2) Ron Paul has hit his ceiling. The pre-Tuesday campaign schedule for the Paul campaign pointed reporters to the states where he might win. Idaho's low-attendence caucus. Alaska's low-attendence caucus. North Dakota's low-attendence caucus, where Paul spent election night. In Alaska, where Paul got 2,004 caucus votes in 2008, he drew more than 1,000 to two stump speeches. He had the state to himself. And... he edged up to 3,175 votes, coming in third place.      Yes, the \\"win\\"-driven coverage of the primary is a little silly. Paul won delegates in all of yesterday's caucus states, Vermont, and Virgina. But he's now averaged around 11 percent of the vote in primaries and 21 percent and caucuses. As he stays in, and as, in April, we move to a winner-take-all process, he's hitting the natural limits of his support. In Missouri, Santorum could win a one-on-one beauty contest with Romney, with Paul taking votes on the side. In Virginia, Paul could only win 40 percent and one district.            3) Newt Gingrich owns the deep south. He won all but three counties in Georgia, just as he'd won all but three counties in South Carolina. When Florida voted, he won all but three counties in the panhandle, losing two of them (Oskaloosa and Bay) by less than 100 votes. This is one of Mitt Romney's best prospects for March: Gingrich is in a good position to win Alabama and Mississippi next week, further muddling the \\"Santorum, conservative champion!\\" story.            4) Mitt Romney's a good closer. The frontrunner's strategy from state to state looks a bit like Galactus's strategy for planet-devouring: Move in, absorb everything. Restore Our Future is his Silver Surfer, softening up the terrain and warning of doom. So in Tennessee, Romney spent money late, made one appearance, and won voters who decided in the last few days, 30-28 -- he lost the state overall, 37-28. In Ohio, where he defeated Rick Santorum by one point, he won last-few-day-voters 43-37. But Santorum had once led by around 10 points in an average of polls. When Romney needs to dispatch Santorum, or he needs to cut into his delegate advantage -- as long as Newt Gingrich is in the race, he can do it.      5) Caucuses reveal that the base is cold on Romney. Here are four numbers: 37%, 45%, 60%, 41%. Here are four more: 24%, 32%, 35%, 17%. Those are the numbers for Rommey, respectively, from the 2008 caucuses in North Dakota, Alaska, Colorado, and Minnesota, and from the 2012 caucuses in the same states.       ||||| Republican presidential candidate Rep. Ron Paul, R-Texas, takes in the applause of the crowd as he address a crowd during the North Dakota caucus Tuesday, March 6, 2012, in Fargo, N.D. (AP Photo/Charles... (Associated Press)      Republicans in 10 states weighed in on the GOP presidential nomination race in its busiest day yet. Mitt Romney won six states, Rick Santorum clinched three and Newt Gingrich prevailed in one. And along the way, clues were gleaned from the results about the path ahead. A look at what we learned:      ___      REPUBLICANS AREN'T HOT ON ANYONE      It's almost like a bad version of Goldilocks. Nobody is just right.      Listen to voters _ in person and in exit polls _ and it's pretty clear Republicans aren't all that hot on any of the candidates.      Only in three states did most people say they strongly supported the contender they backed, nowhere reaching 6 in 10. In the four other states where polling was conducted Tuesday, less than half expressed that degree of support for their candidate.      Even so, Republicans will eventually support the nominee. They always do. Just look at how the grumbling over John McCain faded four years ago when voters were given the choice of begrudgingly supporting the Arizona senator _ seen as a moderate _ or backing Barack Obama.      ___      GINGRICH ISN'T DEAD      But that doesn't mean he can fully come back a third time.      Until Tuesday, the former House speaker hadn't won since South Carolina on Jan. 21. He had declared Georgia a must-win state and essentially camped out there for the past week. Gingrich, who represented Georgia for years in the U.S. House, made the state his firewall in hopes of winning a rationale to continue his bid.      It worked. At least for the moment.      \\"The media said, \`Oh, I guess this is over, finally,'\\" Gingrich told supporters. \\"But you all said no.\\"      Now the question is whether his backers open their wallets to prove he can compete.      Underscoring the urgency, ally Herman Cain was soliciting donations even before Gingrich had gone to bed.      ___      ORGANIZATION MATTERS      Unless it doesn't.      On one hand, Santorum should have been embarrassed in Ohio. His shoestring, scattershot campaign didn't collect enough signatures to appear on the ballot in the Steubenville area, a rural, conservative part of the state where his message on social issues _ and his kinship with a region that neighbors his home state of Pennsylvania _ should have given him an advantage. And that meant he ceded delegates from that region.      Yet, Santorum still managed to make it a close race with Romney, and he won at least some delegates. And Romney just eked out a win, not the decisive victory he had sought. The results wouldn't force Santorum from the campaign.      If anything, Santorum's almost-win _ with scant organization _ foreshadows problems for Romney in contests ahead.      ___      RICH PEOPLE LIKE ROMNEY      Got money? Chances are, you voted for Romney.      In the seven states that had exit polls, Romney _ a millionaire many times over who has struggled to connect with working-class voters _ was the preferred candidate of the wealthiest voters. In Ohio and Tennessee, Romney won about 4 in 10 voters who reported a household income of more than 200,000. In Georgia, about a third of voters with a family income greater than 100,000 backed Romney. In his home state of Massachusetts, about three-quarters of voters making more than 200,000 supported him.      Santorum, in turn, did well among less affluent voters. In Ohio and Tennessee, he claimed about 4 in 10 voters reporting an income between 50,000 and 99,000. In Oklahoma, he won about 4 in 10 voters who made less than 50,000.      ___      SOUTHERNERS DON'T LIKE ROMNEY      Look where Romney is winning. It's not in the South.      Romney does well in the Northeast and Midwest, but he is running weak below the Mason-Dixon line. South Carolina, Georgia and Tennessee _ and, to the west, Oklahoma _ all have rejected Romney. The upcoming calendar gives him scant reason to be optimistic: Alabama, Mississippi and Louisiana all have contests this month.      Sure, Romney won Florida, but that is hardly a Southern state by tradition. And Virginia was a contest between only Romney and Paul _ hardly a real choice among rank-and-file Republicans who see the Texas congressman as outside the mainstream of conservative positions.      Can Romney become the GOP nominee if he can't win in the party's only regional stronghold?      ___      OHIO IS WHERE IT'S AT      Step aside, Florida. Ohio remains the ultimate down-to-the-wire presidential state.      Ohio is a microcosm of the country. It has urban centers and sprawling farms. It has diversity in both race and income. It has conservative strongholds in the southwest corner, where Sen. Rob Portman rallied his neighbors to deliver votes for Romney. It has liberal bastions in the northeast, near Cleveland, where moderates sometimes defect to Republicans. Its eastern and southern edges are Appalachia and tend to be filled with more swing voters.      In the end, Romney won the state that no Republican has ever lost on a successful White House run.      ___      PAUL A NONFACTOR      Another primary night went by without Paul winning a primary. Sure, he picked up delegates and he increased the chances he will have a say in deciding the party's platform come the convention in Tampa. But he isn't posting the wins he needs if he's going to be the late-surging nominee.      Romney offered faint praise to Paul \\"for his steadfast commitment to our Constitution and his strong support almost everywhere you go. He's got good followers.\\"      Just not enough so far, it seems. ||||| What is a shorter version of the above article?","output":"In an important election event called Super Tuesday, people from 10 different states voted to help choose the person who will represent the Republican party in the upcoming presidential election. Mitt Romney won in 6 states, Rick Santorum won in 3 states, and Newt Gingrich won in 1 state. Though the results were mixed, Romney still leads in terms of the number of delegates supporting him. The upcoming contests in Kansas, Alabama, and Mississippi will be challenging for Romney, as he hasn't won in the Southern states, which usually support the Republican party. This election process helps pick the best person to challenge the current president, Barack Obama, in the main election later this year."},{"instruction":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

Q:Given the following context:  Around 1880, two young British officers arrive to join a regiment in India. One, Lieutenant Drake, from a middle-class background, is extremely eager to fit in while the other, Lieutenant Millington, the son of a general, is keen to get out as soon as possible and deliberately antagonizes his fellow officers. The two newcomers learn the traditions of the regiment, one of which is a mess game in which they chase a wooden pig on wheels, attempting to pierce its anus with their swords. Mrs Scarlett, the flirtatious and attractive widow of a captain who was posthumously awarded the Victoria Cross, is a constant presence in the regiment.  One night at a mess dance, Millington gets drunk and tries to seduce Mrs Scarlett in the garden. She repels him, but moments later runs back into the mess wounded and in shock, claiming the culprit was Millington. An informal court martial -more a mock trial than anything else- is organized with Drake ordered to be Millington's defending officer. Although Drake is pressured by his superior officer to plead guilty for Millington and close the case quickly, he begins to challenge the orders in order to give the defendant a fair trial. Drake learns from an Indian servant that another widow suffered a similar attack with a sword six months earlier, before he and Millington joined. After irrefutable evidence, Mrs Scarlett finally admits it was not Millington who attacked her but will not say who the culprit is.

News article: Advice from a long career in government: Talking leadership with the FTCâs Eileen Harrington A view of the FTC building (Bill O'Leary/WASHINGTON…) Due to a transcription error, a prior version of this blog post quoted Eileen Harrington as stating that the Credit Union of Ohio had negotiated a consent decree with the FTC at some point prior to 1986. In reality, she mentioned just that a credit union in Ohio negotiated that decree. Eileen Harrington is the executive director of the Federal Trade Commission (FTC). As the FTCâs associate director for marketing practices in 2004, she and her team developed and implemented the National Do Not Call Registry and were awarded the 2004 Samuel J. Heyman Service to America Citizen Services Medal for their efforts. Harrington is retiring at the end of the month from the federal government after serving nearly 30 years. She spoke with Tom Fox, who is the guest writer of the Washington Postâs Federal Coach blog and is the vice president for leadership and innovation at the Partnership for Public Service. Fox also heads up the Partnershipâs Center for Government Leadership. What are your leadership principles? Effective leaders in the federal sector should always think, âIs this what the people in Peoria are paying for?â If you lose focus on what the public is paying you to do, you get into trouble. If you put anything before the publicâs interestâparticularly political considerationsâyou get into trouble. The second principle is giving my people everything they need to do the job, and then to get out of the way. Was there a lesson early in your career that made an impact? Â In 1986 I left the FTC to take a job for the Credit Union National Association as their Washington counsel. I was at a governmental affairs conference when the president of [a credit union in Ohio] came up to me and introduced himself. I had negotiated a consent decree for his credit union when I was at the FTC because they were not notifying consumers properly of reasons for credit denial. To us, these were routine violations and we gave the credit union slap-on-the-wrist penalties. However, this man was devastated that his credit union hadnât followed the law. He told me he had offered his resignation and then apologized to me for it having happened. It was a really sobering moment. It made me appreciate the power that the federal government has when it steps in and that there are real consequences that affect real people. The National Do Not Call Registry is a prime example of government innovation. To what do you attribute making the registry a reality? The idea came from the bottom up. We were looking at a huge number of complaints from citizens about companies not honoring their requests to cease calling. So we knew that there was a problem that had to be fixed. There was opposition on Capitol Hill and from the direct-marketing industry, but this was a fight worth taking on and so we did. I also think there are some federal environments that are more amenable for innovation than others. For example, the FTC is an independent agency. If we had had to run all the traps that executive branch agencies have to run, Do Not Call probably would not have happened. I also think size matters. This is a small agency, we have about 1,200 employees. We have very few layers between the front- line staff and the chairman. People know each other. I think the further someone with an idea is from decision-makers, the less likely the innovation will happen. If we give workers more autonomy, even in large agencies, then more will stick their heads out of the foxhole and push for good ideas. What are the keys to innovation in government? The key to innovation is creating a genuine sense of individual responsibility and opportunity. To foster innovation, you must empower employees to be thoughtful about their work and make sure that they have an opportunity to talk to you. I meet several times a year with every single person who ultimately reports to me, and we just sit and talk. Everybody has something to say about what theyâre doing and how it can be done better. What do you wish you had known at the beginning of your career that youâd tell to rising federal leaders? Consider public service as a career. When I started out, I thought âIâll do this for a couple years. This is where you go to get experience and then you do something else.â Initially when I had met people who had been working for the FTC for 20 years, I thought, âThese people must not be able to do anything else.â I was really clueless as to what a rich, amazing and rewarding opportunity that I had been given. What Iâve learned is that all the people that Iâve worked with at the FTC over the decades choose to do so because theyâre really jazzed about their jobs.

Write highlights for this article: A Muslim community leader who had the Sydney cafe gunman at his house for lunch and dinner claims he was not capable of plotting and executing this week's deadly siege or his controversial activities over the past several years without help. Self-styled Sheikh Man Horan Monis held 18 people hostage for more than 16 hours at the Lindt cafe in Martin Place, a siege that ended in a hail of gunfire early Tuesday that left two hostages and the gunman dead. Some commentators this week labelled the crazed gunman a 'lone wolf'. But Jamal Daoud, a Muslim activist who had dealings with Monis over several months in 2010, told Daily Mail Australia that Monis could not have been acting without some form of assistance. 'I don't think that he was acting alone. I don't. I really don't,' Mr Daoud said, adding he believed Monis would not have been capable of conducting the siege plan in complete secrecy without support or training from someone here or overseas. Mr Daoud did not have any direct knowledge of any assistance to Monis. Scroll down for video. This pictures shows Muslim community activist Jamal Daoud with the man who he was shocked would one day become a 'violent terrorist' - self-styled Sheikh Man Horan Monis, the gunman who held eighteen people hostage for more than sixteen hours in Sydney this week until he was gunned down by police. This picture was taken at a large celebration for the birth of Daoud's first son. Fanatic: Man Haron Monis in the second half of 2010. Mr Daoud says he cut all ties with the self-proclaimed sheik. Protest: Man Horan Monis is pictured here attending a rally alongside various members of the Social Justice Network and people of other affiliations. Moment of terror: Hostages are forced to hold the Islamic Shahada flag in the window of the Lindt chocolate cafe. Free at last: Lindt cafe worker and hostage Elly Chen bolts for freedom on Monday afternoon. She was one of five hostages who managed to escape before it came to a bloody end around 2am on Tuesday. Mr Daoud questioned how Monis was capable of executing his abusive letter-writing campaign to the families of deceased Australian Defence Force personnel in 2008 - which he and his wife Amirah Droudis were later convicted for. He also said he believed Monis would not have been able to publish inflammatory videos on his personal website - logistically or technically - several years ago. In the YouTube clips, a woman who appears to be his wife, praised the Bali bombings and September 11 terrorist attacks. 'My understanding and the people who knew him said he is not capable of doing this himself -  because they [would] need a lot of help or support,' Mr Daoud said. There is no connection known between Ms Droudis and the siege. Mr Daoud first met Monis at a rally to protest the visit of Israeli Vice-President Silvan Shalom to Australia on December 3, 2009, where the self-styled Sheikh - an Iranian refugee who arrived in the country in 1996 - introduced himself as a 'peace activist'. Monis handed Mr Daoud his business card and said he hoped they would participate in future protest actions together. They did just that, participating in various demonstrations, including about the detention of asylum seekers at Villawood, in Sydney's west. But their relationship did not last for long, Mr Daoud said: 'Our contact did not last more than a few months.' Their final encounter at a Ramadan dinner hosted at Mr Daoud's home for disadvantaged members of the community. Mr Daoud's organisation, the Social Justice Network, cut ties with Monis around that time following the publication of the videos featuring the woman believed to be Ms Droudis. In one video, the woman said: 'I regret to say I am a terrorist. I admit and formally confess that for many years I have been a terrorist, but I'll try not to be anymore.' 'Amirah': In a series of videos on Man Horan Monis' website, a woman believed to be his partner Amirah Droudis celebrated the Bali bombings, Holocaust and September 11 terrorist attacks. The Social Justice Network cut ties with Monis in late 2010 following his bizarre behaviour and the publication of various videos, including one wear a woman believed to be his wife Amirah (pictured) called herself a terrorist. Many members of the Social Justice Network are who hold terrorism 'strongly in contempt', Mr Daoud said. Mr Daoud said, 'We wanted to tell her, this is not Islam'. He added that there were questions over how Monis met his wife - who used to work as a hairdresser and partied in Kings Cross bars but later converted to Islam and became an apparent follower of Monis. Members of the Mr Daoud's group - which protest over matters such as the treatment asylum seekers and Palestine - also doubted Monis' sanity and refused to be part of his own bizarre protest plans, including a demonstration in which he shackled himself to Sydney's Downing Centre Local Court over charges relating to his letter-writing campaign. Mr Daoud said Monis constantly refused to answer his questions about whether he was receiving any support in his letter-writing or video campaigns. 'We could not keep any clue about what's going on in his mind or his plans,' he said. Mr Daoud was unable to name individuals who could have been acting in concert with Monis this week, or over the past several years. A New South Wales police spokeswoman declined to comment on Mr Daoud's claims, saying their investigation is ongoing. On Tuesday, police executed a search warrant on the home of Amirah Droudis - where Monis spent much time - carting away several bags of material and documents. Wife: Amirah Droudis is pictured here arriving at Campsie Police Station following dramatic raids on her  home in Belmore, in Sydney's outer west, on Tuesday. Raid: Police officers from the Critical Incident Unit seized several documents from Ms Droudis'  home in Belmore on Tuesday. Ominous warning: Man Horan Monis was not on government terror watchlists at the time of the siege. Both the Federal and NSW governments are examining various aspects of Monis' activities in Australia, including how he obtained political asylum in Australia, how he acquired the sawn-off shot gun he used in Monday's siege and his interactions with various government agencies. Mr Daoud told Daily Mail Australia he and his wife were floored to find out Monis was responsible for the siege. He would only hear of him again when investigators examining the alleged murder of Monis' ex-wife, Noleen Hayson Pal, contacted him for information earlier this year. 'We were shocked, me and my wife,' he said. 'We were shocked and we could not believe that he was able to do this. 'This is why we think he was receiving some intensive brainwashing and training, of how to hide things, you know. 'We are thinking he is not acting alone because someone was planning this very secretive mission for the last few years. 'Somebody planned this very carefully you know. Everything was kept very secret. He was able to reach his targets and execute his final mission.' Police said during the siege that the gunman's motives were unclear, and that it appeared that he was acting alone. It later emerged that one of his few demands was to have a flag of the Islamic State militant group brought to him. This two storey brick house in the south-western Sydney suburb of Green Valley was Monis's home on and off for eight years. A two storey brick house in the south-western Sydney suburb of Green Valley was Monis's home on and off for eight years until his former wife Noleen finally forbade him to visit. The house, where Noleen Pal's parents, Ashok and Marian Pal, live, has a granny flat in the backyard where Monis lived full time with Ms Pal. After their relationship foundered he continued to visit. According to court documents, Monis was staying two days a week until Ms Pal told him, on June 18 2011, not to come back. Monis' stayed in an external flat at the back of the house, where his ex-wife's parents, Ashok and Marian Pal, still live. Ms Pal at one point left Sydney and travelled to stay with her godfather, Ayyat Khalik, in San Francisco. Mr Khalik has told San Francisco TV station Eye 5 KPix that Ms Pal sought refuge for about a month before returning to Sydney, after which she was murdered, in April 2013. On Thursday, as Mrs Pal sheltered inside the Green Valley house, police told Daily Mail Australia the family was still 'very frightened' following Monday's siege.

A precocious pupil, he began piano lessons at the age of five, and could read music as adeptly as his teacher within three years. However, his parents' passion for his musical talent soon cooled. In 1850, the family decided to send Tchaikovsky to the Imperial School of Jurisprudence in Saint Petersburg. This establishment mainly served the lesser nobility or gentry, and would prepare him for a career as a civil servant. As the minimum age for acceptance was 12, Tchaikovsky was sent by his family to board at the Imperial School of Jurisprudence's preparatory school in Saint Petersburg, 800 miles (1,300 km) from his family home in Alapayevsk. Once Tchaikovsky came of age for acceptance, he was transferred to the Imperial School of Jurisprudence to begin a seven-year course of studies.Music was not a priority at the School, but Tchaikovsky regularly attended the theater and the opera with other students. He was fond of works by Rossini, Bellini, Verdi and Mozart. Piano manufacturer Franz Becker made occasional visits to the School as a token music teacher. This was the only formal music instruction Tchaikovsky received there. From 1855 the composer's father, Ilya Tchaikovsky, funded private lessons with Rudolph Kündinger, a well-known piano teacher from Nuremberg, and questioned Kündinger about a musical career for his son. Kündinger replied that nothing suggested a potential composer or even a fine performer. Tchaikovsky was told to finish his course and then try for a post in the Ministry of Justice.Tchaikovsky graduated on May 25, 1859 with the rank of titular counselor, a low rung on the civil service ladder. On June 15, he was appointed to the Ministry of Justice in Saint Petersburg. Six months later he became a junior assistant and two months after that, a senior assistant.

COLUMBUS, Ohio (AP) — The U.S. Supreme Court on Monday rejected the appeal by a condemned Ohio killer whose 2009 execution was called off after two hours during which he cried in pain while receiving 18 needle sticks.      The court's ruling denies death row inmate Romell Broom the opportunity to argue that giving the state prisons agency a second chance to execute him would amount to cruel and unusual punishment and double jeopardy.      Broom is only the second inmate to survive an execution in U.S. history and the only via lethal injection. In 1947, Louisiana electrocuted 18-year-old Willie Francis by electric chair a year after an improperly prepared electric chair failed to work. The U.S. Supreme Court ruled 5-4 to allow the second execution to proceed, rejecting double jeopardy arguments.      Broom was sentenced to die for raping and killing 14-year-old Tryna Middleton after abducting her in Cleveland in 1984 as she walked home from a football game with two friends.      The Ohio Supreme Court earlier this year rejected Broom's state appeal. The court sided with prosecutors who say double jeopardy doesn't apply to Broom because lethal drugs never entered Broom's veins while executioners unsuccessfully tried to hook up an IV.      Prosecutors also argue that a previously unsuccessful execution attempt doesn't affect the constitutionality of Broom's death sentence.      Despite the ruling, a second execution is years away because of other scheduled executions and uncertainty over the state's supply of lethal injection drugs.      Broom's 2009 execution was stopped by then-Gov. Ted Strickland after an execution team tried for two hours to find a suitable vein. Broom has said he was stuck with needles at least 18 times, with pain so intense he cried and screamed.      An hour into the execution, the Department of Rehabilitation and Correction recruited a part-time prison doctor with no experience or training with executions to try — again, unsuccessfully — to find a vein.      Broom, 60, has been back on death row since. No new execution date has been set. ||||| Breaking News Emails Get breaking news alerts and special reports. The news and stories that matter, delivered weekday mornings.      / Updated By Pete Williams and Tracy Connor      The U.S. Supreme Court declined Monday to hear a challenge from a death row inmate who argued that because the state botched its first attempt to execute him, trying again would be unconstitutional.      The court turned the case down in a brief one-line order. Justices Stephen Breyer and Elena Kagan said they would have granted the appeal to decide the issue.      Ohio prison team members struggled for well over an hour to prepare 60-year-old Romell Broom for lethal injection. They inserted needles at least 18 times into his arms, wrist, hands, and ankles, but they could not find a vein that would hold. Some of the attempts caused him to scream out in pain.      His lawyers urged the justices to rule that another attempt would amount to unconstitutional double jeopardy.      Related: Alabama Inmate Coughs, Heaves During Execution, Putting Spotlight on Sedative      \\"To force a man to prepare for his death — not once but twice — and the second time with the full knowledge of the error of the first, is an elevation of punishment repugnant to our Constitution,\\" they said.      Death row inmate Romell Broom, whose 2009 botched execution was called off after two hours. Ohio Department of Rehabilitation and Correction via AP      While double jeopardy is usually thought of as putting a person on trial a second time for the same offense, it also applies to multiple punishments for the same crime.      Ohio's supreme court rejected Broom's appeal, ruling that he was never actually in jeopardy of execution the first time because the attempts to insert needles in his veins were carried out in a holding cell, not the death chamber, and because the lethal chemicals had not yet begun to flow.      Related: Is Lethal Injection Painful?      Not so, Broom's lawyers said. \\"Broom had no hope of leaving the death house alive.\\" Because he was well beyond the point of expecting that he would be executed \\"and was made to endure intense pain and suffering, a second attempt is barred by double jeopardy.\\"      Broom was sentenced to death for raping and murdering Tryna Middleton, a 14-year-old girl who was abducted at knifepoint while walking home from a football game with friends. He was 28.      Related: How Does the Supreme Court Pick Cases?      After years of appeals, he was moved in 2009 to the Southern Ohio Correctional Facility in Lucasville, where the execution was botched, beginning a new round of appeals. Prosecutors have said Broom caused the condition that made it difficult to find a suitable vein, because he took a box full of antihistamines the day before.      Tryna's mother, Bessye Middleton, applauded the high court’s ruling on Monday and pointed to testimony by a prison guard that Broom purposely dehydrated himself before the 2009 execution to make it difficult to find a vein for the lethal injection.      “This has been going on 32 years,” Middleton said with a sigh.      She said she attended the aborted execution and would attend the next one.      “It’s not going to bring her back, but I will be there to support my baby.”      Middleton said she has no doubt that Broom in the man who killed her youngest child.      “I think about it every day — what he did,” she said. “He has his life. He don’t want to die. But he took someone else’s life.”      Related: Court OKs Ohio Do-Over of Failed Lethal Injection of Romell Broom      Broom has denied killing Middleton, writing in a June 2015 letter to NBC News, “I have always claimed my innocence in this case and have been requesting a DNA test for years.

You will be given a task. You must generate a detailed and long answer. Meh .. He 'll get over it ... Secondly , years ago , my Mom told me a NASTY Dirty joke ... Which I used on Tuesday afternoon to get myself out of a speeding ticket . A speeding ticket I actually deserved , considering I was pushing 175 km / h in a 90 zone just outside of golden , however , I am distracting myself . Why would telling a nasty joke get the narrator out of a ticket ?","output":"Telling a nasty or dirty joke in this scenario likely served multiple purposes that ultimately contributed to the narrator getting out of a speeding ticket. Here is a detailed analysis of how this approach might have worked in the narrator's situation: 1. Surprise and humor: The police officer who pulled the narrator over was likely not expecting to hear a dirty joke during a routine traffic stop. Most people, in such situations, generally panic or become overly serious when they're caught. By telling a dirty joke, the narrator created an atmosphere of surprise and humor, which might have caught the officer off guard and lightened the tension of the situation. 2. Establishing rapport: Sharing a joke, especially a dirty one, can be a way to establish rapport and form a connection, even if it's brief, with another person. While it's a risky move, a joke might have resonated with the officer's own experiences, hobbies, or sense of humor. This could lead the officer to see the narrator as more relatable or even likable, which might lessen their inclination to issue a ticket. 3. Demonstrating confidence: The ability to tell a joke in a high-pressure situation signifies a level of confidence. The narrator, by remaining calm and choosing humor in a moment when most people would be flustered or apologetic, showcased their ability to handle uncomfortable situations. This confidence might have impressed the officer or, at least, given them pause. 4. Defusing the situation and humanizing the driver: People often share nasty or dirty jokes among friends or in casual social settings, creating an informal and relaxed environment. The narrator, by telling a dirty joke in this particular situation, might have humanized themselves and broke down the formal divide between the police officer and the driver. This could have made the officer more inclined to let the driver off with a warning, rather than proceeding with a ticket. 5. Providing an opportunity for the officer to exercise discretion: Police officers have the discretion to decide whether or not to issue a ticket during a traffic stop. By telling a dirty joke and showing a lighter side, the narrator provided an opportunity for the officer to exercise this discretion. If the officer found the joke amusing, they might have decided to let the driver off with a warning instead of issuing a ticket. While it is important to remember that telling nasty or dirty jokes during a traffic stop can backfire and lead to less favorable outcomes, it appears that the narrator in this scenario successfully managed to leverage the benefits of humor, rapport-building, and defusing tension to avoid receiving a speeding ticket."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant that follows instruction extremely well.

On the road at Lincoln Financial Field, the Indianapolis Colts played a NFC opponent in the Philadelphia Eagles for the first time since the 2006 season.  The game did not start well for the Colts who allowed the Eagles to score a quick touchdown on only 3 plays covering 72&#160;yards.  A Peyton Manning interception caused more concern as the Colts now found themselves under the gun halfway through the first quarter.  Two key defensive stops allowed the Eagles to only score two field goals making it a 13-0 Eagles lead heading into the second quarter.  A touchdown pass from Manning to Jacob Tamme allowed the Colts to get back into the game trailing the Eagles only 13-7.  A Philadelphia field goal from David Akers added to the lead, however the Colts continued chipping away.

The Colts, playing with passion, drove down the field and scored a touchdown and field goal within the final two minutes of the half, giving them a 17-16 lead at halftime.  The offensive production seen by the Colts in the second quarter was nowhere to be found in the third.  The Colts began the third quarter with two three-and-outs while the Eagles got the lead back with a 44-yard field goal halfway through the quarter.  Going into the fourth quarter, the Eagles were driving down into scoring position where a 1-yard run by Michael Vick gave the Eagles a 26-17 lead over the Colts.  A continued lack of offensive production gave the Eagles the ball back and time to milk the clock.  The Colts received the ball back with less than four minutes remaining in the game, trailing by two scores and drove down to score a touchdown.

Hinton, is set in the mid-1960s in an unspecified city in the United States. Although the exact time setting is never explicitly mentioned, certain elements of the story, such as the clothing, automobiles, music, slang, and socioeconomic conditions, provide clues that point to the 1960s as the time period. The story revolves around the lives of two rival teenage gangs separated by their socioeconomic background: the Greasers, who come from a lower-class, blue-collar background, and the Socs (short for Socials), who belong to the affluent, upper-class section of the society. The novel explores themes of social class divide, friendship, and the challenges of growing up. The choice of the 1960s as the setting for the story provides context to the cultural and social elements of the time and is significant for a number of reasons. During this period, America experienced significant cultural shifts, with the rise of youth counterculture, civil rights movements, the Vietnam War, and protests against socioeconomic and political issues. These factors are crucial in shaping the attitudes and outlooks of the characters and the choices they make throughout the story. While the story is set in a very specific era, the themes and issues addressed in The Outsiders continue to remain relevant today, as they touch upon ageless aspects of human society such as the struggle for identity, the plight of marginalized groups, and the battle against stereotypes. By setting the story during this turbulent time in American history, Hinton effectively manages to reflect the broader societal changes taking place, while also capturing the timeless nature of adolescence and the quest for belonging."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Republican candidate John Koster calls aborting rapist's child \\"more violence on woman's body\\" Surrounded by supporters at a gathering in south Everett, Wash., Republican John Koster celebrates early reports of an overwhelming lead in the primary election Tuesday night Aug. 7, 2012. Tea Party politician John Koster, the Republican nominee for a hotly contested congressional seat in Washington state, says he opposes abortions, even in cases of \\"the rape thing,\\" because it is tantamount to inflicting \\"more violence onto a woman's body.\\" The Snohomish County councilman made the comments during a weekend fundraising appearance in the Puget Sound city of Everett, north of Seattle, that was captured in a recording released on Wednesday by the liberal activist group Fuse Washington. Long known as an opponent of abortion, even in cases of rape or incest, Koster was asked if there were any circumstances under which he would approve of terminating a pregnancy. \\"When a mother's life is in danger ... I'm not going to make that decision,\\" he replied, before going on to talk about incest and rape. \\"Incest is so rare, I mean, it's so rare. But the rape thing, you know, I know a woman who was raped and kept her child, gave it up for adoption. She doesn't regret it. In fact, she is a big pro-life proponent,\\" he said in the recording. He continued by asking a rhetorical question: \\"But on the rape thing, it's like, how does putting more violence onto a woman's body and taking the life of an innocent child that's a consequence of this crime, how does that make it better?\\" The remarks drew sharp criticism from the campaign of his Democratic foe, former Microsoft executive and state revenue director Suzan DelBene - a spokesman said it showed Koster to be \\"out of touch\\" - and from abortion-rights supporters. \\"There are far too many extreme politicians out there that are trying to be involved in a woman's personal medical decisions about her pregnancy,\\" Sara Kiesler of Planned Parenthood Votes Northwest told the Seattle Post-Intelligencer. The flap marked the latest instance of a Republican congressional candidate stirring controversy with comments about abortion and rape. Richard Mourdock, the Republican nominee for a U.S. Senate seat in Indiana, said during a debate last Tuesday that pregnancy from rape was \\"something that God intended to happen.\\" And Missouri U.S. Senate candidate Todd Akin in August caused an uproar by saying women have natural defenses against pregnancy from \\"legitimate rape.\\" In a statement posted on its website on Wednesday, Koster's campaign accused DelBene supporters of engaging in \\"dirty tricks\\" by circulating the recording of his remarks, and suggested his words were taken out of context. \\"The recording was done secretly, then edited to suit DelBene's agenda,\\" campaign manager Larry Stickney said. \\"The insinuation that John Koster is in some way 'callous or 'cavalier' when it comes to the subject of rape is another example of the vicious and desperate tactics ... employed to slander the good name of John Koster.\\" During his term as a state lawmaker, Koster sponsored tough \\"two strikes, you're out\\" legislation to lock up violent sex offenders permanently, his website said. The race between Koster and DelBene for Washington state's newly drawn first congressional district seat, vacated by Democrat Jay Inslee when he resigned to run for governor, is considered a tossup. Koster, a former dairy farmer with close affiliations with and support from the Tea Party movement, has lost two previous bids for the U.S. House of Representatives. What is a short summary of the above article?","output":"Republican nominee John Koster, running for a congressional seat in Washington state, has sparked controversy by opposing abortions even in cases of rape, arguing that doing so would inflict \\"more violence onto a woman's body.\\" His comments, captured in a recording during a weekend fundraising event, have been criticized by his Democratic opponent Suzan DelBene's campaign and abortion-rights supporters.

Options: - sea world - tomales bay - great oceans - the key - tropical waters  The answer is \\"great oceans\\" because Answer:","output":"The shark, being a creature accustomed to the expansive environments of the wild, might grow tired or frustrated with the limited space provided by a tank. This inherent dissatisfaction stems from the natural instincts and environmental requirements of sharks. Sharks are meant to live in the open oceans, which encompass a vast, dynamic, and complex ecosystem. Great oceans serve as their natural habitat, where they have the freedom to roam, hunt and interact with other marine creatures in ways not possible in a confined tank. Starting with the options provided, one might initially consider \\"Sea World\\" as an answer. However, Sea World is a commercial theme park that primarily features marine life shows and exhibitions. It is unlikely that a shark would aim to exchange one tank for another, albeit possibly a larger one. This would not solve the problem of confinement and lack of freedom it is facing. \\"Tamales Bay\\" is a specific location and doesn't quite fit with the broader idea of what the shark is looking for. It is a specific bay, and while it may offer more space than a tank, it still represents a form of confinement and unnatural limitation on the shark's movements. \\"The key\\" is an ambiguous term that could symbolize freedom or escape. However, in this context, it may be too metaphorical. Sharks, or any marine animals, don't have a conceptual understanding of keys as instruments of escape or unlockable areas. \\"Tropical waters\\" could be a plausible answer as certain shark species do prefer warmer waters. However, several species have been known to live in a range of temperature conditions, not just tropical scenarios. So, while some sharks may prefer tropical waters, not all do.  Therefore, the most logical answer is \\"great oceans.\\" The shark's inherent nature and instinct would enable it to seek vast expanses in which it can explore, hunt, and exist freely, as oceans would allow. The major oceans (Atlantic, Pacific, Indian, Arctic, and Southern) offer the most substantial, diverse, and natural habitats for a shark to thrive. They provide plenty of space, an abundance of food, and the occasional interaction with different marine species. This makes \\"great oceans\\" the most suitable option that aligns with the shark's innate desire for freedom and expansive habitat beyond its confined tank."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

How to support young adults leaving foster care  Help foster children start their transition early.  The typical 90-day transition plan may not be long enough to fully prepare a young adult to live on their own. While laws are established to help youths transition from foster care, they may actually require more time to find housing and line up a job. Select from: 1). Much of the work that they'll have to do to begin their transition into foster care may be entirely done by themselves. Foster care costs money, has strict expectations, and may seem overwhelming.; 2). Aim to foster young adults who are 20 and older by helping foster children establish and maintain a solid relationship with their parents and peers. Communicate with the child's guardians.; 3). Foster children should be expected to live in foster care for a minimum of four years. Waiting too long can impact a young person's decision as to whether or not they want to move on.; 4). A good transition plan should include securing housing and employment, practicing money management skills, and making plans to attend college or vocational school if the child wishes to. Life skills like budgeting, staying healthy, and keeping a job take more than 90 days to learn.; Answer:","output":"A good transition plan should include securing housing and employment, practicing money management skills, and making plans to attend college or vocational school if the child wishes to. Life skills like budgeting, staying healthy, and keeping a job take more than 90 days to learn. For young adults leaving foster care, the journey towards self-sufficiency can be both rewarding and challenging. Therefore, it is crucial to put in place comprehensive support systems and resources to ensure their success. One way to support these young adults is by providing access to tailored educational and vocational programs. These programs should focus on developing essential skills to help them navigate the job market and build a stable career. Additionally, mentorship programs can help bridge the gap between foster care and independent living, facilitating connections with experienced professionals or individuals who have successfully transitioned from foster care themselves. Moreover, access to affordable housing options is essential for young adults leaving foster care. This can be achieved by advocating for more low-income housing units or collaborating with landlords willing to accommodate individuals transitioning from foster care. It is also beneficial to provide guidance on eligibility requirements for housing assistance programs and support during the application process. Furthermore, young adults leaving foster care should be equipped with proper financial literacy training, including building and maintaining a budget, understanding credit scores, and managing debt. Financial mentoring can also play a vital role in helping these individuals avoid financial pitfalls and make informed decisions regarding their future. Another essential aspect of support is addressing mental health and well-being. Many young adults leaving foster care have experienced trauma or adverse experiences during their time in the system. Providing access to counseling, therapy, and support groups can aid them in processing and healing from their past. Implementing self-care strategies and building resilience are also critical elements of mental health support. Lastly, maintaining a strong support network is crucial for success following a transition from foster care. Encourage young adults to establish and maintain connections with trusted friends, family members, or mentors who can provide guidance, encouragement, and a listening ear during difficult times. Caseworkers and transition services should also maintain contact with young adults after leaving care, ensuring that they can access support services when needed. In conclusion, a successful transition from foster care to independent living is an ongoing process and requires continuous support and guidance. By addressing various aspects of a young adult's life - from education and employment to housing, financial literacy, mental health, and building a strong support network - we can help them successfully navigate this critical period in their lives and lay the foundation for a stable and prosperous future."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant that follows instruction extremely well.

Would \\"The autumn 1862 Confederate campaign into Maryland (a Union state) ended with Confederate retreat at the Battle of Antietam , dissuading British intervention.\\" be a reasonable answer? Choose from: [-] No; [-] Yes;","output":"[-] No; While the statement about the Battle of Antietam and the dissuasion of British intervention does shed light on a specific occurrence within the Civil War, it doesn't fully satisfy the broader question about what made the Civil War itself unique as compared to other wars. There are several key reasons to consider which made the Civil War different: 1. Casualty Rates and Tactics: The Civil War was one of the deadliest wars in American history, with an estimated 620,000 to 750,000 soldiers killed, greater than the total American casualties in World War I, World War II, the Vietnam War, and the Korean War combined. This high casualty rate was largely due to the outdated tactics used, such as forming lines in open fields, coupled with the introduction of more modern and efficient weaponry. 2. Slavery as a Central Issue: Though wars are typically fought over a range of complex political and societal issues, the Civil War was unique in the sense that the institution of slavery was a central, driving force in the divide between the North and South, leading to secession and ultimately, warfare. 3. Nature of the Conflict: Unlike many conflicts in which two or more independent nations fight, the Civil War was an internal conflict within one nation, with the secessionist Confederate states fighting against the Union states for sovereignty. 4. Technological Advancements: The Civil War saw the first widespread use of many technological advancements such as railways for troop movements, mass-produced weaponry, including rifled artillery, ironclad warships, and even early submarines. Additionally, medical advancements were propelled during the Civil War, leading to improvements in amputation procedures, anesthesia, and other surgical techniques. 5. Economic Disparities: The economic differences between the agricultural South and the industrialized North created stark contrasts in the war effort on both sides. 6. Emancipation Proclamation: With the issuance of the Emancipation Proclamation by President Abraham Lincoln, the war took on a new moral dimension with the definitive goal of ending slavery in the Confederate states, making it a war of liberation for millions of enslaved African Americans. Thus, while the Battle of Antietam was indeed a significant part of the Civil War, it was just one facet in a conflict shaped by numerous unique and defining factors."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

How many countries are there in the United Kingdom?","output":"Yes, both these questions are asking about the composition of the United Kingdom in terms of the number of countries it includes. While the wording is slightly different, they share the same intention and can be answered in a similar way. The United Kingdom, officially known as the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland, is a sovereign state consisting of four countries: England, Scotland, Wales, and Northern Ireland. These countries have distinct cultures and historical backgrounds, but they are united under the same political system and government. 1. England is the largest and the most populous country in the United Kingdom, accounting for over 80% of the total population. London, the capital and the largest city in both England and the United Kingdom, is a major global city and financial hub. England is known for its historical significance, picturesque countryside, and cultural contributions, such as the worldwide influence of the English language, the development of parliamentary democracy, and the Industrial Revolution. 2. Scotland is situated to the north of England and makes up roughly one-third of the land area of the United Kingdom. Its rich and unique culture has much to offer, from the breathtaking landscapes and historic cities to its world-renowned festivals and traditional music. The Scottish legal system and education system are separate from those in England and Wales, allowing the country to maintain its distinct identity. Scotland has its own devolved parliament in Edinburgh, which has responsibility for many domestic issues. 3. Wales is located to the west of England, occupying a smaller land area compared to the other countries in the United Kingdom. It is known for its dramatic coastlines, mountainous landscapes, and strong cultural heritage, including the Welsh language that is still spoken by a significant portion of the population. The Welsh Assembly, situated in Cardiff, is the legislative body that deals with matters specifically related to Wales. 4. Northern Ireland is situated in the northeastern part of the island of Ireland, sharing a border with the Republic of Ireland. It became a separate country in 1921 following the partition of Ireland and following a tumultuous history, peace was established with the Good Friday Agreement in 1998. Northern Ireland is known for its lush green landscapes and vibrant cities such as Belfast, which is its capital. It has a devolved assembly responsible for its domestic affairs.

The fear response arises from the perception of danger leading to confrontation with or escape from/avoiding the threat (also known as the fight-or-flight response), which in extreme cases of fear (horror and terror) can be a freeze response or paralysis.  In humans and animals, fear is modulated by the process of cognition and learning. Thus fear is judged as rational or appropriate and irrational or inappropriate. An irrational fear is called a phobia.  - Amicus Productions was a British film production company, based at Shepperton Studios, England, active between 1962 and 1977.

(CNN) -- Sevilla have sacked coach Manolo Jimenez after their disappointing home draw to bottom-club Xerez on Tuesday extended the club's winless run to seven games. Despite lying fifth in the Spanish Primera Liga table, Sevilla were knocked out of the lucrative European Champions League by Russian side CSKA Moscow last week. Jimenez had also secured a Copa del Rey final against Atletico Madrid but it wasn't enough to save the 46-year-old's job. The club's sporting director Ramon Rodriguez admitted the decision had been difficult but said he had \\"done what I had to.\\" He told the club's official Web site: \\"It was an unavoidable situation and we had to find a solution, and the pain that it brings. \\"Tuesday was the end of the story but the decision comes from the image and dynamics of the team. Without doubt we are grateful to Manolo. He is an excellent professional, he has made all this possible and impossible. However it is obvious that he could not get a response out of the team. \\"Fortunately we believe that there is time. The growth and the ambition of the club is shown in the change of the manager. We are fighting for important things.\\" Xerez's injury-time equaliser on Tuesday meant Sevilla's last league success was against Real Mallorca back in February. Ironically, it is Mallorca who occupy the much-coveted fourth spot in the table that guarantees Champions League football next season. Jimenez took charge in October 2007 when former coach Juande Ramos left to take over at English Premier League team Tottenham.  Question: \\"What was the unavoidable situation Ramon Rodriguez spoke of?\\" Answer: \\"Sacking coach Manolo Jimenez\\" Is this answer correct?","output":"Yes, the answer is correct.

Paul still lives with his mother, Elvira, who works as a clown cheering up children at the local hospital. He spends most of his time hanging out with his best friend and self-proclaimed partner-in-crime, Tip, and their friends Bo and Bust-Ass. Among his friends, Paul has a reputation as a ladies' man, but he is not at all known for being involved with long-term relationships; most of Paul's romances last only a few weeks, and he's slept with nearly every girl in town.

You will be given a task. You must generate a detailed and long answer. In one sentence, describe what the following article is about: Use a straight razor blade or a craft knife to remove any threading that may be surrounding the rod guide. If it’s difficult to remove using just a blade, then try heating the area for 3-4 seconds with a lighter to loosen any of the adhesives. Peel off the tape and unwind the threading until the old, broken guide comes off of the rod.  Rod guides are the circular metal pieces along the length of the rod that help keep your line straight. Be careful not to heat the rod for too long since it could cause damage to it. Don’t cut into the rod with your razor, or else you could damage it and make it weaker. Use 120- or 220-grit sandpaper to get rid of any leftover adhesive and to add tooth to the rod. Rub all the way around the rod on the spot where you want to place the new guide. Then, use your sandpaper on the foot of the guide, which is the flat part that rests against the fishing rod. You can buy new fishing guides at sporting good stores. Make sure the new guide is the same size and style as the other guides on your fishing rod or else your line may snag or get tangled. Press the foot of the new guide onto the rod so it’s in line with the other guides. Rip off a thin piece of masking tape and wrap it around the foot so it’s held in place. That way, you don’t need to keep holding it in place while you wrap it. You can also use super glue, but it will be difficult to move or readjust once the glue is set. Any type of thread will work for wrapping your guide onto the rod. Loop your threading around the rod so it’s  1⁄2–3⁄4 inch (1.3–1.9 cm) from the guide’s foot on the side closest to the handle. Maintain tension on the loop and start tightly winding the thread around the rod. Make sure the thread doesn’t overlap with loops you’ve already made and that they are flush with one another. Take the piece of tape off of the foot you’ve wrapped everything below it. When your wrapping is 1⁄8 inch (0.32 cm) from the circular part of the guide, stop winding the thread around the pole. Cut a separate piece of thread so it’s about 6 inches (15 cm) long and fold it in half to form a loop. Lay the second piece of thread on top of your wrapping so the loop sticks out near your guide. If you don’t have any other thread, you can also use a thin fishing line instead. Once the looped piece of thread is on top of the wrapping, continue spinning your thread around the foot of the guide. Continue wrapping the final 1⁄8 inch (0.32 cm) of the guide so the middle of the looped piece is held against the rod. Once you reach the end of your wrapping, cut the end of the thread you used to wrap and pull it through the middle of the loop. Pull the other end of the looped piece down and away from the guide to pull the thread underneath the wrapping. This way, the wrapping is secured to the rod without having to tie a knot. If you don’t want to use a looped piece of thread, you can also try tying a knot in the threading, but it may not be as strong and it could be more difficult. Mix the 2 parts of the epoxy in a small dish with a paintbrush until they are thoroughly combined. Paint a thin layer of the epoxy over your threading so it hardens and stays in place. Keep the rod horizontal and let it dry overnight before you try using your rod again. Work quickly with the epoxy since it will quickly start to dry and harden once you mix it.","output":"The article provides a step-by-step guide on how to replace a broken rod guide on a fishing rod while focusing on the precautions and techniques involved, such as removing old threading, sanding the rod and new guide, positioning and securing the new guide, wrapping it with thread, and applying epoxy to ensure its stability and longevity."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Paragraph: The earliest signs of people on Jamaica are the remains of the Arawak, an AmerIndian society that originated on the north coast of South America. Arawak peoples migrated to various Caribbean islands, arriving in Jamaica by the beginning of the eighth century. They were peaceful and lived by \\"slash-and-burn\\" farming. For meat, they bred pigs and ate iguana, both native to the island. They were highly skilled in such manual activities as thatching and weaving. In fact, the hammock was an AmerIndian invention that remains with us today; it is an object which, more than any other, evokes an image of a warm sunny day on a tropical isle. The Arawak left a legacy of paintings in places such as Runaway Caves near Discovery Bay, and shards of pottery found at their settlements near Nueva Sevilla and Spanish Town have added a little to our knowledge about them. Over 200 Arawak sites have been identified, and it is said that when the Spanish arrived in Jamaica there were approximately 100,000 Arawak living on the island. They called Jamaica \\"Xaymaca\\" (\\"land of wood and water\\"). Columbus and the Arrival of Europeans Columbus first arrived in Jamaica on 5 May 1494 at Discovery Bay, where there is now a small park in his honor. He stayed for only a few days but returned in 1502, landing here when the ships of his fleet became unserviceable; he waited at St. Ann's Bay for help to arrive from Cuba. After the death of Columbus in 1505, Jamaica became the property of his son Diego, who dispatched Don Juan de Esquivel to the island as Governor. Esquivel arrived in 1510 and created a base called Nueva Sevilla near St. Ann's Bay, from which he hoped to colonize the rest of the island. The Spanish immediately began subjugating the Arawak population, many of whom died under the yoke of oppression and of diseases carried by the Europeans. A number of them committed suicide rather than live the life created for them by the Spanish. The site of Nueva Sevilla proved to be unhealthy and mosquito-ridden, and in 1534 the Spanish founded Villa de la Vega, today known as Spanish Town. Pig breeding was the main occupation of these early settlers, but they also planted sugar cane and other crops that required large numbers of laborers. The number of Arawak had already fallen dramatically, so the Spanish began to import slaves from Africa to work the land; the first Africans arrived in 1517.  Question: \\"After Esquival arrived, did the Spanish remain in Nueva Sevilla?\\" Answer: \\"Moved to Villa de la Vega\\" Based on the paragraph, is this answer correct","output":"Yes, sweetie, the answer is correct.

The film opens with the narrator (who is also the film's director) driving out West along a desert highway, relating to the audience his previous experiences as a streetside bookseller in New York City. The entire documentary – including the central events involving his experiences among the street booksellers in New York – is thus \\"told\\" as a long conversation. The narrator describes his post-graduation years in New York, and how he ended up at one point virtually penniless. Driven by a desperate need to pay the rent, he resorts to wheeling his own books out to the street to try to sell them. He reveals that he was not only successful in making a significant amount of cash on that first day, but he has also met a variety of interesting and strange characters of the streets of New York – including other street booksellers. A motley assortment of street booksellers on West 4th street, in Greenwich Village, New York City, are first introduced.

It instead discusses how European nationalism, the breakup of empires, Germany's defeat in WW1, and issues with the Treaty of Versailles contributed to World War II. While these are relevant historical events and connections, they don't provide the information specifically asked for. To answer the initial question, after World War I, France took control of present-day Lebanon and Syria in the Middle East through a mandate system authorized by the League of Nations. The mandate system established by the League of Nations aimed to oversee and provide a stable government to the former territories of the defeated Ottoman Empire. The territories were expected to become independent eventually, but would be temporarily governed by the European Allied Powers (including France and the United Kingdom) to ensure this transition. The French Mandate for Syria and the Lebanon lasted from 1923 to 1946. While under the mandate, the French colonial administration assigned certain areas to different ethnic and religious groups and created an administrative division between Lebanon and Syria. This was done in line with the French policy of dividing and ruling their colonies, a strategy that ultimately led to internal divisions within these countries. France was finally forced to grant independence to Lebanon in 1943 and to Syria in 1946, after facing increasing nationalist pressures and uprisings in both territories. In summary, the country in the Middle East that France took control of after WW1 is Lebanon and Syria. The statement provided regarding the Treaty of Versailles and the factors contributing to World War II is informative, but not relevant to answering the specific question."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Step 4: Determine the overall sentiment Given that the sentence does not provide further context, it is difficult to definitively determine the sentiment.

How would someone go about accomplishing this goal? What type of chainsaw should I use to cut down a very thick tree?","output":"To accomplish the goal of cutting down a very thick tree using a chainsaw, follow these steps and consider these factors: 1. Choose the appropriate chainsaw:    The type of chainsaw you should use depends on the tree's thickness, your experience, and the specific job requirements. For a very thick tree, consider using a gas-powered chainsaw with a bar length of at least 20 inches. This will provide enough power and cutting capacity to handle the job efficiently. Professional-grade chainsaws from reputable brands such as Stihl, Husqvarna, or Echo are generally reliable and efficient. 2. Safety first:    Before you start, ensure that you're wearing the proper safety gear, including safety glasses, ear protection, sturdy boots, gloves, and chainsaw chaps. Make sure to read the chainsaw user manual and follow all safety guidelines. 3. Plan your cutting strategy:    Inspect the tree and determine the best felling direction. Look for potential hazards, such as nearby structures, power lines, or other trees that could be affected. Plan a safe escape route that's approximately 45 degrees away from your planned cutting area. 4. Clear the working area:    Remove any obstacles or debris from around the tree to create a safe workspace. 5. Make the notch cut:    Create a notch on the side of the tree in the direction you want it to fall. This notch should be a V-shaped cut that goes into the tree about one-fourth of its diameter. 6. Make the back cut:    On the opposite side of the tree from the notch cut, make the back cut approximately 2 inches above the notch cut. Leave some wood as a hinge between the notch and the back cut to help control the direction of the tree's fall. Do not cut all the way through the hinge. 7. Use wedges if needed:    If the tree starts to lean back towards the chainsaw, drive wooden or plastic felling wedges into the back cut to help guide the tree in the intended falling direction. 8. Felling the tree:    As the final cut is made, and the tree begins to fall, quickly move away to your planned escape route, ensuring a safe distance from the falling tree. 9. Limbing and bucking:    Once the tree is down, proceed with limbing (removing branches) and bucking (cutting the trunk into manageable sections). Always follow safety guidelines during these processes. Remember that cutting down a very thick tree requires skill and experience. If you're not confident in your ability to safely fell a large tree, consider consulting with a professional arborist or tree removal service to get the job done safely and efficiently."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Context: Surely the best thing about colomba, the Easter equivalent to panettone, is the sugared, toasted almond topping that covers the whole thing and crumbles when you cut it, so you sort of have no choice but just to pick up the crusty sugary bits and eat those on their own. I’d always thought that colomba would make a very good baking project but was somewhat intimated by getting the right shape  — it’s vaguely in the shape of a dove, if you use your imagination — and texture — wonderfully soft, fluffy, sweet yeasted bread. I had attempted making panettone (this fig, walnut and date panettone) a few years ago with fair results — absolutely delicious results, actually, they were just not as fluffy and bouncy as expertly made ones from your favourite pastry shop where panettoni are hung upside-down to maintain their height and airiness. But when I came across the familiar brown and gold paper forms for making colomba at the supermarket, I thought I’m only ever going to get a chance to make this now! Like the panettone, I referred to my favourite baking book for Italian specialties, Carol Field’s The Italian Baker. Field recounts a bit of history behind the colomba, which I’m sure is little known to anyone these days. Colomba is a fixture at Easter tables all around Italy (and is often given as presents), even though it comes from the north of Italy, Pavia. It is one of those traditions that are now a given, where a slice of colomba, perhaps eaten with pieces of a cracked chocolate Easter egg and an espresso or a glass of dessert wine, is a welcome end to the meal (or indeed breakfast the next day). But the legend behind it is a medieval one and rather disturbing — maybe it was made up to encourage young girls to learn how to bake their own colomba (and make sure it was good) to get themselves out of sticky, undesirable situations.

The negative aspects of the statement can be analyzed in detail by examining the specific words and phrases used within the context. 1. \\"Bleed it almost completely dry\\": This phrase carries a negative connotation, as it suggests a process where something is being drained or removed to an extent where it becomes significantly depleted. It conjures up a sense of depletion and loss, which are typically associated with negativity. 2. \\"Of humor, verve, and fun\\": This portion of the sentence details the qualities that are being lost or depleted - humor, verve, and fun. These qualities are generally associated with happiness, energy, and enjoyment, so their absence or loss would likely indicate a negative experience. 3. Overall tone: The sentence is constructed in a way that emphasizes the loss or absence of positive qualities (humor, verve, and fun). This indicates a negative impression or feeling. Taking all these factors into account, the sentiment of the sentence is negative.

Just weeks after North Korean leader Kim Jong Un and South Korean President Moon Jae-in declared the beginning of a new era of peace during a historic summit held in the demilitarized zone of the inter-Korean border, Pyongyang has put further dialogue and cooperation on hold until its demands are met. President Moon will meet with U.S. President Donald Trump in Washington on Tuesday to discuss the upcoming Trump-Kim summit and the North’s sudden conditions set for continued dialogue and cooperation. Most of North Korea’s anger last week, expressed in official statements and reports carried by the state news agency KCNA, seemed to be directed at the U.S. It criticized the Max Thunder joint military exercise that is currently underway, and U.S. National Security Adviser John Bolton’s demands for the North’s unilateral nuclear disarmament. North Korea in particular objected to Bolton’s insistence that North Korea follow the Libyan model, which involved the rapid and total dismantlement of that country’s nuclear program, but it was also followed by the overthrow of the country’s leader Moammar Gadhafi some years later. Unless the U.S. eased up on its uncompromising stance, Pyongyang indicated it would pull out of the June 12 meeting in Singapore between Kim and U.S. President Donald Trump to negotiate an end the North’s nuclear program in exchange for security guarantees and an end to punishing international sanctions. President Trump later said the Libya model does not apply to North Korea and that Kim Jong Un would remain in power and “be very rich” if he makes a deal to end his country’s nuclear program.

[III] None of the above choices .. [IV] They are not picking him for the game .. The answer:","output":"None of the above choices. The main character seems to resent the people because they are becoming irritated, sarcastic, and defensive towards Spike, the blonde character described in the context. The main character appears to hold Spike in great regard, seeing him not just in his chosen mantle of black and bravura, but in a thousand vibrant colors. This suggests that Spike holds a special significance and might be dear to the main character. This resentment could be a result of the people's failure to acknowledge and appreciate Spike's importance and relevance. Moreover, the main character ponders over how his humans would react if he pointed out that they likely owed their lives to Spike. This implies that the main character thinks that the people might be underestimating Spike's contributions to their well-being, which could be another reason behind his resentment towards them.

Article: Greenwich   is on the River, five miles from the middle of London, and its history is two thousand years old. The first English people were fishermen there, and they named the place Greenwich, meaning \\"green village\\". Later the English kings and queens lived at Greenwich in their beautiful places. The name of the earliest palace was Placentia. Its windows were made of glass--the first in England. But trouble was coming to Greenwich. In 1649, a war started in England and for eleven years there was no king. The men who had worked for him at Placentia decided to live in the place themselves. They sold all its beautiful things, and bought small pieces of the palace garden with money. Finally, the war ended and King Charles II came back. But Placentia was falling down. So King Charles built a new and bigger palace, which is now open to the public. At this time, Charles was worried about losing so many of its ships at sea because their sailors did not know how to tell exactly where they were. So in 1675, Charles made John Flamsteed, the first astronomer   in England, try to find the answer. Flamsteed worked in a new building on the high ground in Greenwich Park. From it with a telescope which he made himself, Flamsteed could look all round the sky. And he did, night after night, for twenty years. Carrying on Flamsteed's work a hundred years later, an astronomer called Harrison finally made a clock which told the time at sea, and helped sailors to know where they were.You can see Harrison's clock, still working, in Greenwich's museum of the sea. Because of Flamsteed's work, every country in the world now tells its time by Greenwich time. Question: Charles made John Flamsteed try to find   _  .

Can you think of other places where you might find friction? Friction also lets you light a match. Heat from friction can also cause problems. It can cause a car to overheat. To reduce friction, oil is added to the engine. Oil coats the surfaces of moving parts. This coating of oil makes them slippery. When things are slippery there is less friction.

Justin is eating ice cream, which has a low temperature.  Given the paragraph above, please answer correctly the following question:   Do the particles have more kinetic energy in the ice cream or in the soup? Answer:","output":"The particles have more kinetic energy in the soup.  In the given scenario, the soup on the stove has been boiling for a while, which means it has a high temperature. In contrast, the ice cream that Justin is eating has a low temperature as it is a cold dessert.  When considering kinetic energy, it is important to remember that the temperature of an object is proportional to the average kinetic energy of the particles in that object. As the temperature increases, the particles move faster, and their kinetic energy increases. When temperature decreases, the particles move slower, and their kinetic energy decreases. Since the soup has a higher temperature than the ice cream, the particles in the soup have more kinetic energy compared to the particles in the ice cream."},{"instruction":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

Movie title: The Mummy Context: In Egypt, circa 1290 BC, high priest Imhotep engages in an affair with Anck-su-Namun, the mistress of Pharaoh Seti, despite strict rules that other men are forbidden to touch her. When the Pharaoh discovers their tryst, Imhotep and Anck-su-Namun murder the monarch. Imhotep is dragged away by his priests before the Pharaoh's guards can discover his involvement; Anck-su-Namun then kills herself, intending for Imhotep to resurrect her. After Anck-su-Namun's burial, Imhotep breaks into her crypt and steals her corpse. He and his priests flee across the desert to Hamunaptra, the City of the Dead, where they begin the resurrection ceremony. However, they are caught by Seti's guards before the ritual could be completed, and Anck-su-Namun's soul is sent back to the Underworld. For their sacrilege, Imhotep's priests are mummified alive, and Imhotep himself is forced to endure the curse of Hom Dai: his tongue is cut out and he is buried alive with a swarm of flesh-eating scarabs. The ritual curses him to become an immortal walking plague if he were ever to be resurrected. He is buried under high security, sealed away in a sarcophagus below a statue of the Egyptian god Anubis, and kept under strict surveillance throughout the ages by the Medjai, descendants of Seti's palace guards. If Imhotep were ever to be released, the powers that made him immortal would allow him to unleash a wave of destruction and death upon the Earth.In 1923, soldiers from the French Foreign Legion, led by American Rick O'Connell, make a final stand at Hamunaptra against an overwhelming force of Medjai warriors. The soldiers are massacred and O'Connell makes a final retreat inside the city, only to be cornered by a group of Medjai.

For instance, you might wear a sheer, ruffled blouse with a blazer, tailored trousers, and flats if you’re heading to the office. Wear a sheer ruffled blouse under a leather jacket for a cool mix of tough and sweet. Ruffles add a sweet, flirty detail to outerwear. If the weather is a little cool, consider wearing a basic outfit, like trousers and a fitted T-shirt. Then, top them with a jacket with a pretty ruffle to create a look that’s instantly chic. The ruffle can be along the buttons or zipper, on the bottom hem, around the collar, or on the sleeves. A ruffled dress can look sweet and innocent, so a pair of ankle boots are the perfect way to toughen up the look a little.

Please write a short summary for the following article: Women, Independent Voters Show Biggest Swing From 2008 Women and independents took the biggest turn away from Democrats since the 2008 election, a Fox News analysis of exit polling from Tuesday's midterm vote shows. In both demographic groups, the percent of eligible voters remained constant from 2008 to 2010. Women turnout was 53 percent, while 28 percent of registered independents voted. But their preferences had a big impact on the GOP win. Whereas the gender gap played a major role in 2008 with women voting for Democrats 56 percent of the time compared to Republicans 42 percent of the time, in 2010 the split was 49-48 percent for Democrats to Republicans. Likewise, independent voters supported Democrats 51 percent of the time compared to 43 percent of the time for Republicans in 2008. But in 2010, the Democrats garnered only 39 percent of the independent vote compared to 55 percent for the GOP. While turnout in a midterm is generally lower than in a presidential year, early numbers suggest that voters participated in the 2010 election at much higher levels than previous midterm years. Turnout in the 2008 race was measured at 61.6 percent of the eligible electorate, or 132.6 million voters. Comparing 2008 to 2010 also shows that youth and minority voting blocs for the most part stayed in the Democratic camp. According to polls, turnout for African-Americans and young voters declined from 13 to 10 percent and 10 to 5 percent of eligible voters in each category, respectively. In 2008, African-Americans voted for Democrats 93 percent of the time compared to Republicans who chose the GOP candidate 5 percent of the time. The change was modest in 2010, with African-Americans voting for the Democrat in 90 percent of the cases compared to 9 percent for Republicans. Likewise, voters ages 18 to 24 were overwhelmingly supportive of Democrats in 2008, with 62 percent of the vote. In 2010, they chose the Democratic candidate 58 percent of the time. The GOP choice rose among young voters modestly, from 35 percent in 2008 to 39 percent in 2010. Hispanic turnout was the same in both years at 8 percent, and the numbers changed only slightly from 68 percent of support for Democrats in 2008 to 65 percent in 2010. GOP support from Hispanics rose from 29 percent to 33 percent, belying the fact that several Hispanic candidates won Republican races, most notably the New Mexico and Nevada governors.

While the percentage of eligible voters in both demographics remained constant from 2008 to 2010, their preferences greatly impacted the GOP win. In 2008, the gender gap was significant, with women supporting Democrats 56% of the time compared to Republicans at 42%. In 2010, however, this split narrowed to 49-48% in favor of Democrats. Independent voters also shifted their support, with 51% voting for Democrats in 2008 compared to 43% for Republicans. But in 2010, Democrats received only 39% of the independent vote, while the GOP received 55%. Although voter turnout during midterm elections is usually lower than in presidential years, the 2010 election saw higher participation levels compared to previous years. Youth and minority voting blocs, for the most part, remained within the Democratic camp during this time."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant. User will you give you a task.

Going in to the sneak preview, knowing nothing about the movie except for the one trailer I'd seen, I thought it was going to be a Dude Where's My Car kind of crap fest. I was expecting bad sex jokes and farting and a pathetic lead character who will get laid in the end because that's just how movies work. Instead I got a smart, surprisingly original movie about a decent, average guy who just never had sex. Yes, the film is chock full o' sex jokes and vulgarity and the occasional hey-look-a-nipple!, but it's done much in the spirit of Bad Santa rather than Sorority Boys. All the characters are people you probably know in real life, redeemable friends who are just trying to hook a brother up and live their lives. I went in thinking this movie was going to be total crap, and I was very surprised. Yea, it's pretty over the top (c'mon, it's a movie about a 40 year old virgin!), but it's very smartly done.

Which British rock band’s original line-up was Syd Barrett, Nick Mason, Roger Waters and Richard Wright????","output":"The original line-up of the British rock band featuring Syd Barrett, Nick Mason, Roger Waters, and Richard Wright was none other than Pink Floyd. Formed in 1965, Pink Floyd is a legendary rock band known for their progressive, psychedelic music style, elaborate live shows, and thought-provoking concept albums. They are considered one of the most influential and groundbreaking groups in the history of rock music. Initially, the band was formed under the name \\"The Tea Set,\\" and later changed their name to \\"The Pink Floyd Sound,\\" inspired by the blues artists Pink Anderson and Floyd Council. Eventually, they shortened the name to \\"Pink Floyd.\\" The name change mirrored the transformation of their musical style from R&B covers to a more experimental sound, driven by Syd Barrett's unique approach to playing the guitar and his peculiar songwriting abilities. Syd Barrett was the lead vocalist, guitarist, and the main creative force behind the band during its early years. His inspired songwriting and innovative guitar techniques helped shape the band's early psychedelic sound, as heard on their debut album, \\"The Piper at the Gates of Dawn,\\" released in 1967. This album received critical acclaim and established Pink Floyd as one of the leaders in Britain's emerging psychedelic rock movement. Nick Mason, the drummer, was the only constant member throughout the entire history of the band. His playing style contributed significantly to Pink Floyd's rhythms, and he contributed to the unique soundscapes that characterized the band's music. Roger Waters was the band's bassist and later became the primary lyricist after Barrett's departure. Besides his indispensable musical contributions, Waters was responsible for many of Pink Floyd's powerful conceptual themes, which dealt with socio-political issues, emotional struggles, and human existence as a whole. His time as the band's creative leader, especially during the late 1970s, resulted in some of the band's most iconic albums, such as \\"Animals,\\" \\"The Wall,\\" and \\"The Final Cut.\\" Richard Wright, the keyboardist, was vital in crafting Pink Floyd's signature atmospheric sound. Wright's use of various keyboard instruments, including the organ, piano, and the synthesizer, helped elevate the band's music to new heights. His contributions to the band's compositions, as well as his occasional roles as a lead vocalist, were essential to Pink Floyd's undeniable success. In 1968, due to mental health issues and erratic behavior, Syd Barrett left the band and was replaced by David Gilmour, who became a key figure in Pink Floyd's later years, taking over as the lead guitarist, vocalist, and songwriter alongside Waters. The band then transitioned from its psychedelic roots to a more progressive rock sound, resulting in classic albums such as \\"The Dark Side of the Moon,\\" \\"Wish You Were Here,\\" and \\"Animals.\\" Pink Floyd remains an iconic band with a massive influence on rock music history. The original line-up of Syd Barrett, Nick Mason, Roger Waters, and Richard Wright laid the groundwork for the band's continuing legacy and created a sound that has inspired countless musicians for generations to come."},{"instruction":"In this task, you are given a sentence in Persian, and your task is to translate it into English. قوانین هویت ملی‌ کشور تبعیض جنسی‌ دارد!","output":"The national identity laws of the country have gender discrimination!"},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant that follows instruction extremely well.

Answer the above question based on the context below:  Four of the men deserted when they reached the Neches River. La Salle and one of his nephews became very ill, forcing the group to halt for two months. While the men recovered, the group ran low on food and gunpowder. In August, the eight surviving members of the expedition returned to Fort Saint Louis, having never left East Texas.While La Salle was gone, six of those who had remained on the Belle finally arrived at Fort Saint Louis. According to them, the new captain of the Belle was always drunk. Many of the sailors did not know how to sail, and they grounded the boat on Matagorda Peninsula. The survivors took a canoe to the fort, leaving the ship behind. The destruction of their last ship left the settlers stranded on the Texas coast, with no hope of gaining assistance from the French colonies in the Caribbean Sea.By early January 1687, fewer than 45 of the original 180 people remained in the colony, which was beset by internal strife. La Salle believed that their only hope of survival lay in trekking overland to request assistance from New France, and some time that month he led a final expedition to try to reach the Illinois Country. Fewer than 20 people remained at Fort Saint Louis, primarily women, children, and those deemed unfit, as well as seven soldiers and three missionaries with whom La Salle was unhappy. Seventeen men were included on the expedition, including La Salle, his brother, and two of his nephews. While camping near present-day Navasota on March 18, several of the men quarreled over the division of buffalo meat. That night, an expedition member killed one of La Salle's nephews and two other men in their sleep. The following day La Salle was killed while approaching the camp to investigate his nephew's disappearance. Infighting led to the deaths of two other expedition members within a short time. Two of the surviving members, including Jean L'Archeveque, joined the Caddo. The remaining six men, led by Henri Joutel,  made their way to Illinois Country.

The Wallflowers are an American rock band formed in Los Angeles in 1989 by singer-songwriter Jakob Dylan and guitarist Tobi Miller. The band has gone through a number of personnel changes but has remained centered on Dylan. After releasing their eponymous debut album in 1992, the Wallflowers released what would become their best-known and highest-selling album, Bringing Down the Horse in 1996, which featured songs such as \\"One Headlight\\" and \\"6th Avenue Heartache\\". They went on to release an additional three albums before going on a seven-year hiatus, beginning in 2006. In 2001, Jakob Dylan began writing for the Wallflowers' fourth album, Red Letter Days. Later that year while on tour with John Mellencamp, the band began recording using portable equipment. Some recording was also done at keyboardist Rami Jaffee's house. Once the band was finished touring for the year they began recording the bulk of the new record at Jackson Browne's studio in Santa Monica. By the time the Wallflowers had gotten into Browne's studio, Michael Ward had left the band, leaving them without a lead guitarist for the recording process. Dylan took on much of the lead guitar duties with Mike McCready, Rusty Anderson and Val McCallum also contributing on guitar. Moe Z M.D., who had been touring with Mellencamp, contributed additional percussion and background vocals to the album.Red Letter Days was produced by founding Wallflowers member Tobi Miller along with Bill Appleberry. Recording continued through the new year and was completed on April 12, 2002. The album was mixed by Tom Lord-Alge, who had mixed the band's previous two albums. Mixing was completed on May 15, 2002.  While the Wallflowers were working on Red Letter Days, they recorded a cover of the Beatles' 1965 song \\"I'm Looking Through You\\" for the soundtrack to the 2001 film I Am Sam. The soundtrack was released on January 8, 2002.  The first single from the Red Letter Days, \\"When You're On Top,\\" was released to radio on August 16, 2002. A music video directed by Marc Webb followed. After a few false starts, Red Letter Days was released on November 5, 2002. The album was met with mixed to positive reviews. Many critics noted the harder rock sound and catchy melodies used throughout the album. Commercial performance was relatively mixed as well, peaking at No.32 on the Billboard 200. Around the time of Red Letter Days' release the Wallflowers embarked on a monthlong U.S. tour stretching into early December. After another U.S. tour in January 2003, the Wallflowers toured in several European countries in February including Spain, Italy, Germany and Great Britain. After this tour, the Wallflowers' drummer since 1995, Mario Calire announced he was parting ways with the band.  In 2003, the Wallflowers were featured on the soundtrack for the film American Wedding. The band recorded a cover of Van Morrison's 1970 song \\"Into the Mystic\\". The film's music department weren't able to secure the licensing rights to use Morrison's version so they enlisted the Wallflowers to cover the song. Both versions of the song were, however, featured in the film. most interesting aspect of the article?","output":"The most interesting aspect of the article is the process of creating the Wallflowers' fourth album, Red Letter Days.

Pearlstein Live - washingtonpost.com Washington Post business columnist Steven Pearlstein was online Wednesday, May 9 at 11 a.m. ET to discuss the growing credibility gap of Washington trade associations who are supposed to oversee and set high standards for student loans, subprime loans and Medicare plans -- all industries that are currently under scrutiny. Read today's column: Industries Could Take Cues From Hollywood on Self-Control. About Pearlstein: Steven Pearlstein writes about business and the economy for The Washington Post. His journalism career includes editing roles at The Post and Inc. magazine. He was founding publisher and editor of The Boston Observer, a monthly journal of liberal opinion. He got his start in journalism reporting for two New Hampshire newspapers -- the Concord Monitor and the Foster's Daily Democrat. Pearlstein has also worked as a television news reporter and a congressional staffer. His column archive is online here. Danvers, Mass.: Yes. Filed this column under HTWW (How The World Works). But, the reason why, in the face of inevitable loss, businesses continue to act out your script ... could it have something to do with them taking enough money off the table before the regulatory costs finally arrive? Could it be that the judicial costs rarely amount to much in the cold calculation of rate of return on the corrupt deals? Steven Pearlstein: It is possible the profits made during the boom periods, when standards are lax, more than offset the \\"costs\\" of having to clean things up once the public and government turn against an industry. That would be an interesting calculation. But to do it, you have to consider a lot of intangibles, chief among them the reputation of the industry and its ability to lobby effectively across a range of issues in the future. Those issue can also involve big money, and losing on them because the industry is in bad odor can be expensive. There are also the impact on people's careers, and the ability to attract and retain people to the industry. I guess I have trouble believing at this point, for example, that the mortgage industy thinks it is better off the way things turned out than to have taken action to reign in some of the worst practices that led to the deterioration of underwriting standards. They would have foregone some business, but not enough to justify the cost of the collapse of the subprime market that has resulted, and the effect of that on the housing market, which in turn impacts the vitality of their basic prime mortgage businesses. Silver Spring, Md.: Great column Steve. But I have to ask... where were the regulators in all of this? You say trade associations are supposed to protect members from themselves, prevent things from getting to such a bad point, and it would be wonderful if that always worked. But while my tax dollars certainly shouldn't go to protect corporations from themselves, I'd sure be happy if some more of them went to protecting me, the consumer, from them! Where were the regulators that should have kept those student loan lenders from getting in bed with my college, so perhaps I'd have a more competative choice? Where were the regulators to prevent mortgage companies from marketing a half a million dollar mortgage for 1500 /month knowing darn well that many many people are not well versed enough in finance to realize that payment's going to double when the interest only period is over? What in the world happened to protecting consumers from these sorts of practices BEFORE they got out of hand that our only hope is trade assocations? Steven Pearlstein: That, of course, is a separate issue. The banking regulators were clearly not vigilant enough, and have effectively admitted as such. The regulators at the Department of Education look, at this point, as if they were in the business of protecting the industry rather than borrowers. The health care issue is more complicated. Some of it involves behavior of state-licensed brokers. The health insurance industry has set up best practices that many of them used to screen out business from bad brokers. But the issue there also concerns whether there should be so-called fee-for-service plans under the Medicare Advantage program, since the view of many who have looked at it is that these don't add any value to the traditional medicare program beyond additional benefits that are paid for by additional subsidies (minus, of course, a profit margin and administrative fees that are higher than the traditional Medicare program.) The health insurance industry has been vigorously defending these fast-growing fee for service programs, which as I indicated is very shortsighted, since the subsidies they receive are indefensible and they threaten political support for the larger Medicare Advantage program, which hold out the real promise of bringing the benefits of managed care to the Medicare program. Arlington, Va.: President Bush strongly favors industry self-regulation. It never seems to work. A corporation's profit motive isn't tempered ethics. Corporations understand two things when it comes to adhering to the law, jail and fines. While you praise Jack Valenti's ratings system, I don't think you'll find too many parents or filmakers who think it's helpful. Sure, he kept Congress out of an area they didn't want to go, but the ratings system is a joke. Steven Pearlstein: On the rating system, I think it does work in two ways. One, it has been well enforced and does give everyone -- not just parents by the way -- a sense of what they are getting into. But more important is that it has set a limit on how raunchy films can get, because the studios do anything to avoid an X rating. That sets a self-imposed limit. This has worked better with sex than with violence -- in fact, I wonder if there needs to be a violence equivalent of the X movie. And don't get me wrong. I'm not for self-regulation as a replacement for regulation in every case. Far from it. I'm only referring to the fact that, in their own self interest, industries should try to prevent the kind of competitive dynamic that sucks everyone into questionable practices or products that, in the long run, wind up costing the industry dearly. New York, N.Y.: Since 2003, the GSE's purchase close to 50 percent of all subprime loans annually and bundle them as mortgage-backed securities. At the same time, they refuse to purchase many prime loans to lower income borrowers because these prime loans appear to be less profitable for their quarterly earnings ledger sheets. As tax-exempt \\"Government Sponsored Enterprises\\" should Fannie and Freddie do business with predatory subprime lenders and turn a blind eye to affordable prime lenders who desperately need to benefit from the liquidity and excess capital the government subsidy provides the GSE's? - Cal Steven Pearlstein: First, GSE's aren't fully tax exempt. Fannie and Freddie, anyway, are exempt from state taxation, not federal. And their bonds are not tax exempt. But to your larger point, you are right. Fan and Fred, to different degrees, participated in packaging and marketing subprime mortgage packages to the bond market, and they weren't as effective in this area as they have been in the prime mortgage area in setting standards. Which, in a way is my point. Because Fan and Fred are the biggest and most powerful members of the MOrtgage Bankers Association, and they could have worked through that organization to set better standards and let the public know about companies that weren't meeting them. This second point is really crucial. Its not just a matter of having standards. Most associations have them. It is a matter of really making them stick with their members and bringing pressure on those that don't. That's where the opportunity is often missed, because it is very uncomfortable doing that. Bowie, Md.: The three industries you mention are all essentially financial middleman -- companies that don't do much except transfer funds, so there isn't a lot of overhead to enter the industry, or sunk-cost loss of getting out (like building a factory). Unlike the film industry, which owns lots of stuff, and in which unsucessful efforts are very expensive; isn't the problem with loans and health insurance that there just aren't many barriers to discourage unsuccessful particiaption? Steven Pearlstein: That's an interesting observation. I'm not sure where it goes, exactly, other than we expect financial intermediaries to be gatekeepers of sorts -- that's one of the reasons they deserve to get a fee -- and when they don't do this job, it can cause markets not to work in the way we expect. Great Falls, Va.: The question about the regulators is an important one, but the real weakness in the system is the regulatory framework instituted by Congress. The subprime mortgage situation has been a perfect example. Congress has held showy hearing after hearing, trying to show constituents that they care about major issues. And at each of those hearings, the Congressmen and Senators ignore the more well-measured responses and play to the camera by feigning indignation. Meanwhile, one could point out that Congress is invariably a decade late to investigate these issues, and while they hold hearings, business interests move on to their next ventures (some of which should probably be the subject of regulation, but won't be for years to come). By the time Congress gets around to acting, it will produce a watered-down regulatory framework that half-fixes older problems that may be moot anyway. You can't really blame Wall Street for holding Congress in disdain. They're not wrong in thinking that the legislators are too slow to respond, a bit too dim to understand the nuance of the issues, and more willing to produce sound bites than helpful regulation. With assistance like that, how can the regulators be expected to accomplish anything? Steven Pearlstein: You know, there's no one who can be as dismissive of Congress than I, but I wonder if they are really the major culprits here. Not having any oversight hearings for six years no doubt allowed regulators to fall into the natural trap of getting too cozy with the industries they are supposed to oversee. But Congress isn't the first line of regulatory defense. I think that's asking too much of them. An Adam Smith moment: I think what you've defined is the difference between self-interest and -enlightened- self-interest; short-term gains (splitting up the pie) vs. long-term industry health (baking a bigger pie). The movie industry was able to latch onto that longer-term view, probably because their products have a longer useful life, whereas the financial middlemen aren't interested in building a long-term customer base. Steven Pearlstein: Thanks, Mr. Smith. You said it better than I did. Washington, D.C.: Steve - Since we were never contacted for your opinion piece that indicts industry practice in the area of Medicare Advantage, I would like to ask you a simple question: At what point does your bias against a particular type of Medicare Advantage plan become a convenient route to besmirch an industry and its trade association for not doing the right thing - especially given the fact that this industry has led the way in improving the Medicare Part D program through intensive systems changes that have cost millions of dollars and also the Medicare Advantage program, which, in any form, provides better benefits for millions of beneficiaries? Steven Pearlstein: This is Mohit Ghose, from the American Heath Insurance Plans trade group, who took particular exception to my column today. I guess, Mohit, I would turn the question around: at what point does your bias in favor of fee-for-service Medicare plans, which siphon money away from other Medicare recipients, get in the way of your seeing the political damage they are causing for the more valuable private plans under Medicare Advantage? It is true I am biased against fee for service plans, because I have studied the criticism and your organization's defense of them, and find the defense very unconvincing. so did the Medicare advisory committee in its recent report, by the way. And as a columnist, I thought I was entitled to have and defend my biases. Anonymous: Steve - thanks for the response - Your column is about brokers and agent issues and the marketing of products. You can now make the issue the existence of private fee for service plans in Medicare Advantage, but that is not what your column was about. However, you indicted the industry for not remedying the issues in marketing, not for selling a product. And - people are entitled to their opinions about PFFS or MA in general, but that should not form the basis to say that the industry doesn't police itself - especially since the track record of the MA program shows that the satisfaction rates among beneficiaries are more than 80 percent across the board - precisely because of the better benefits that ALL plans provide - not just any one model - in the MA program. In fact, PFFS plans have chronic care management programs that are patient-centric, not physician centric because they have no networks. Additonally, PFFS plans and all other plans in MA are able to provide better benefits like vision, hearing and dental care which is not available in the regular FFS program. So, we believe that people should have the right information to make the most informed choice in their Medicare coverage - what we see is that people are choosing with their feet to join ALL MA products. Moreover, the industry has mechanisms in place to address the issues raised by the inappropriate marketing of all MA products, including services like call-backs to beneficiaries to confirm their choice and understanding, ride-alongs with brokers, monitoring of broker calls, and termination of contracts upon observed patterns of complaints. Steven Pearlstein: Mohit, The column wasn't just about marketing of products. It was also, in some instances, about the products themselves, such as subprime mortgages with no documentation and no money down. But I'm glad we have the opportunity here to hear/read what you have to say. Beaumont, Calif.: I agree with your concern Steve about any fee for service option under Medicare Advantage Programs. These managed care Medicare programs are why the average cost for seniors in California for medical coverage are less than most other States in the Union. They emphasize preventive care, annual physicals, shots and vaccinations, incentives for good behavior that reduce the end of life outrageous expenses, etc. I guess all of this reflects the sad state of affairs for the upcoming baby boomers in our country. The majority are way over weight, have no regular exercise programs, eat all the wrong foods, practice no preventive medicine - but they want a deal on real low cost medical insurance after the sad way in which they take care of themselves.

Answer the following question: I am always one to at least finish my shift if that happens then talking to my agency if it is agency work or some higher up boss if not. Never mind employers can ask you to leave at any time. After all, job hunting is a huge inconvenience. There is ONE exception to this rule: NOT GETTING PAID. I am not talking about if accounting messes up and you have to wait an extra day or two to get paid. If you are a good employer, I won’t be happy, but I am understanding. I am talking refusing to pay or being even rumored to be not paying. I am not in the volunteer business for business owners. Only happened once… I thought I had a part timer gig being a waiter at an over-priced tourist trap restaurant in the New Orleans French Quarter. As typical for these type of jobs, you do not get to actually wait tables and get tips till a training period is over. Somehow, I did not get the memo that this place did not have “training” but “auditions”, meaning all that silverware I rolled and floors I mopped and food I ran to tables I was not getting paid for! Add to that, if somehow they did not like me, after a week I would not have a job! Now, I understand actors and actresses go to auditions and not get paid all the time. I’ve known a few amateur actors. But, those auditions do not include showing up for a week to work unpaid so maybe you might get hired from talking to them… And waiters don’t do auditions! I left immediately. I think they owed me 30 bucks for half a day’s work at the minimum wage. Tried to go back threatening labor board and all that, but they would not be intimidated. They said there was no record of me being there and to get off property. I wrote it off to bad experience and started working another place that I had been interviewing with. Much better job.

The Piedmont region of central North Carolina is the state's most urbanized and densely populated section. It consists of gently rolling countryside frequently broken by hills or low mountain ridges. Small, isolated, and deeply eroded mountain ranges and peaks are located in the Piedmont, including the Sauratown Mountains, Pilot Mountain, the Uwharrie Mountains, Crowder's Mountain, King's Pinnacle, the Brushy Mountains, and the South Mountains. The Piedmont ranges from about 300 to 400 feet (91 to 122 m) in elevation in the east to over 1,000 feet (300 m) in the west. Because of the rapid population growth in the Piedmont, a significant part of the rural area in this region is being transformed into suburbs with shopping centers, housing, and corporate offices. Agriculture is steadily declining in importance. The major rivers of the Piedmont, such as the Yadkin and Catawba, tend to be fast-flowing, shallow, and narrow.

The sporting icon's legacy has been marred by a series of alcohol and drug-related arrests throughout the years and his wild lifestyle away from the ring led to him filing for bankruptcy in 2003. He was inspired to turn his life around after landing a role playing himself in the hit 2009 comedy The Hangover, but he insists he is still struggling to make ends meet, despite recently scoring his own reality TV show about his love of bird racing.            However, Tyson insists he is happy with his new frugal way of living and is simply thankful to have been given a second chance at life with his third wife Lakiha Spicer. Appearing on The View on Friday, he says, \\"I'm totally destitute and broke. But I have an awesome life; I have an awesome wife who cares about me.\\"            Asked if he has enough money in the bank to tie him over between jobs, Tyson replies, \\"No, I'm totally broke.

During a startling news conference at the Turning Stone Resort in New York, Tyson said he hasn’t had any alcohol or drugs for six days, which for him is “a miracle,” and he seemed to plea for forgiveness for being “a bad guy.”      Tyson has lived an alternately crushing and soaring life. By the age of 16, his mother was dead and his father was locked up. Boxing trainer Cus D’Amato took him in and Tyson became “Iron” Mike, the most feared boxer in the world.      That all imploded when he was convicted of rape in 1992. When he got out of prison, he recovered as a boxer to the point he fought Evander Holyfield twice, in two of the biggest fights of all time. Holyfield won the first fight by TKO, and the second one was the night a desperate Tyson took a bite of Holyfield’s ear, establishing him as one of the craziest guys in sports.      Tyson’s boxing career slowly and sadly eroded, and he began stacking pounds on top of pounds of fat. He weighed 380 pounds at one point. He’s 5-foot-10. All that boxing money was going out as soon as it was coming in, and Tyson soon found himself broke, disgraced and addicted.      And then, miraculously, Tyson became one of the most beloved characters in pop culture. He started getting acting roles, and he did well in them. His turn as himself in “The Hangover” was wonderful. He did a one-man Broadway show, turned into a film by Spike Lee that will air on HBO. Tyson appeared on FOX Sports Live during its first week and next month will be seen on FOX Sports 1 in the documentary series “Being: Mike Tyson”.      Video: Mike Tyson joins Fox Sports Live - part 1      THE GREATS Where do Joe Frazier and Muhammad Ali rank among the Where do Joe Frazier and Muhammad Ali rank among the best boxers of all time      All in all, it has looked like the manifestation of a full comeback. Not as Iron Mike, but as our charmingly screwed-up cousin.      Tyson’s candor and self-awareness have served him well in his post-boxing life, but every now and then it seems like Tyson wants to remind everybody that he’s still a deeply hurt, deeply troubled person. On top of his aforementioned troubles, he's endured two broken marriages and the death of a 4-year-old daughter, and has been diagnosed as bi-polar.      “I’m a bad guy sometimes,” he said. “I did a lot of bad things, and I want to be forgiven. So in order for me to be forgiven, I hope they can forgive me. I wanna change my life, I wanna live a different life now. I wanna live my sober life. I don’t wanna die. I’m on the verge of dying, because I’m a vicious alcoholic.\\"      It is not surprising to see Tyson unload all that weight during a news conference that I’m sure was expected to be sort of silly and whimsical. This was at a casino. But Tyson always has had a tendency to drop his baggage in the middle of the lobby. His many confessions have tended to come straight out of nowhere, which is probably a big part of the reason people like him now. He does not appear to be orchestrating some kind of thing in the media.      Some people have grandparents like this, who without any context will blurt out some old secret and then just move on like nothing happened. There’s a lot of that in Tyson’s public appearances over the years.

Tyson described a recent conflict and how he resolved it. He was vague about the conflict, but not how he felt about it.      ”I hate myself,” he said. “I’m trying to kill myself. I hate myself a lot. But I made myself proud of myself, and I don’t do that much.” |||||","output":"A famous retired boxer named Mike Tyson spent too much money and had problems with alcohol and drugs.

In Australia it reached No. 13.  - Rockpalast (\\"Rock Palace\\") is a German music television show that broadcasts live on German television station Westdeutscher Rundfunk (WDR). \\"Rockpalast\\" started in 1974 and continues to this day. Hundreds of rock and jazz bands have performed on \\"Rockpalast\\". Some acts were recorded for broadcast and for retail sale. All-night marathon shows called Rock Night (\\"Rocknacht\\") were produced once or twice a year from 1977 through 1986 and simulcast throughout Europe via the Eurovision network of TV broadcasters. \\"Rockpalast\\" is involved in several German pop, rock and underground music festivals, once sponsoring Bizarre Festival.  - The term cult usually refers to a social group defined by their religious, spiritual, or philosophical beliefs, or common interest in a particular personality, object or goal. The term itself is controversial and has divergent definitions in popular culture and in academia and has been an ongoing source of contention among scholars across several fields of study. In the sociological classifications of religious movements, a cult is a social group with socially deviant or novel beliefs and practices, although this is often unclear. Other researchers present a less-organized picture of cults on the basis that cults arise spontaneously around novel beliefs and practices. The word \\"cult\\" has always been controversial because it is (in a pejorative sense) considered a subjective term, used as an \\"ad hominem\\" attack against groups with differing doctrines or practices. Cults range in size from local groups with a few members to international organizations with millions.  - Carol Patricia Mas (born October 20, 1955), professionally known as Carolyne Mas, is an American singer-songwriter, guitarist, pianist, and producer. She broke out of the Greenwich Village music scene boom of the late 1970s, along with other artists such as Steve Forbert, The Roches, and Willie Nile. Although she remains relatively unknown in the United States, except for a loyal cult of fans, she managed to gain popularity in Europe and Canada, mostly due to the use of television as a promotional tool in these markets. Her records did well in the charts in Canada, but her greatest success was in Germany, where a live album, \\"Mas Hysteria\\", was released by Phonogram. It was originally intended to promote her upcoming appearance on Rockpalast in January 1981, and included her most significant hit, \\"Sittin' in the Dark\\".  - Willie Nile (born Robert Noonan on June 7, 1948) is an American singer-songwriter. In 1980, Nile released his self-titled debut album.

В прошлые времена, прежде чем электронные калькуляторы и компьютеры стали распространенными инструментами для решения математических задач, люди использовали логарифмические линейки, чтобы выполнить вычисления. Логарифмическая линейка - это аналоговый вычислительный инструмент, состоящий из двух масштабных линеек с наметками, которые представлены в виде логарифмической шкалы. Логарифмическая линейка была изобретена английским математиком Эдмундом Гюнтером в 1620-х годах и с тех пор значительно развилась. Инженеры и ученые широко пользовались логарифмическими линейками весь XX век, и именно этот инструмент был основным способом относительно быстрых вычислений до 1970-х годов, когда были разработаны доступные электронные калькуляторы. Логарифмическая линейка позволяла выполнять различные операции, такие как сложение, вычитание, умножение, деление, возведение в степень, извлечение корня и многие другие. Для этого надо было перемещать одну из линеек относительно другой, а затем считывать соответствующие значения с логарифмической шкалы. Несмотря на тот факт, что логарифмические линейки не так точны, как электронные калькуляторы, они предоставляли достаточный уровень точности для большинства инженерных и научных расчетов. В конечном итоге, с ростом сложности вычислительной техники и появлением доступных электронных калькуляторов, логарифмические линейки стали менее популярными и в настоящее время являются скорее уникальными предметами коллекционирования и обучающими инструментами, чем практическими вычислительными аппаратами."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

In addition to the administrative capacity to implement legislation, Gunlick emphasizes that strong Länder should also possess fiscal capacity, which includes the ability to pay for the implemented legislation using own-source revenues. Delving deeper into Gunlick's assertion, we can understand that the German system of dual federalism has unique requirements for its strong Länder. Both administrative and fiscal capacities are crucial for the efficient functioning of the system. Here's a more elaborated explanation of these capacities: 1. Administrative capacity: This refers to the ability of the Länder to create, manage, and enforce laws and regulations within their jurisdictions. In a dual federal system, it becomes necessary for the Länder to have a robust administrative structure that supports the execution of policies, ensuring that the regulations are well-coordinated and cater to the local requirements. This is vital in maintaining a balance of power between the federal and state governments. 2. Fiscal capacity: This aspect of the Länder's capacity refers to the financial resources they have at their disposal, either through taxation or other sources of revenue. The fiscal capacity of the Länder is crucial for them to implement and maintain the laws and regulations they create. By having the ability to generate own-source revenues, Länder can finance the programs and public services they administer, ensuring that they're financially independent and sustainable. This financial autonomy is a cornerstone of dual federalism, allowing Länder to tailor their policies and services to their specific needs without relying heavily on the federal government for funding. In conclusion, according to Gunlick, the German system of dual federalism requires strong Länder not only to possess the capacity to implement legislation but also to have the administrative and fiscal capacities to enforce and fund it, thereby promoting a healthy balance of power between the central and state governments."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

News article: MICK Jagger and Melanie Hamrick are “surprised and happy” at the news of her pregnancy, a source close to the ballerina revealed last night.      The source added: “This is great news.

Mick and Mel laugh together      “She’s very bright, intelligent, sparky and has her own ideas about how she wants to lead her life. She knows what a great relationship Mick has with all of his children and can’t wait for him to be a dad again.      “They are taking the news in their stride.”      Mick, 72, and Melanie, 29, have been in a relationship since 2014 and have seen each other regularly over the past two years.      She was a guest in Rio de Janeiro and Mexico in February and March on the Latin American leg of the Stones’ recent tour that ended with their historic concert in Cuba.      Splash News 6 Old-time blues . . . Mick heads for his car in New York      The source said: “They’ve seen each other a lot, they like each other a lot but they still want independent lives.”      A spokesperson confirmed the news last night.      It comes less than two months after Mick’s bandmate Ronnie Wood, 68, welcomed twins.

Melanie is very excited to become a mum and thinks Mick is the most amazing man she’s ever met.”      EPA FILE 6 Tragic . . . Mick with ex L'Wren Scott      Mick and Melanie’s 43-year age difference shocked many when The Sun revealed their secret relationship in 2014.      They kept in touch after meeting at a Rolling Stones concert in February of that year.      Melanie reached out after the tragic death of L’Wren Scott, Mick’s partner of 13 years, and their relationship developed.      They were pictured at the time cuddled up on the penthouse balcony of Mick’s luxury Zurich hotel.      Friends said she put a smile back on his face after months of mourning L’Wren. Melanie is one of the top ballet dancers in the US and was engaged to Cuban classical dancer José Manuel Carreño up until early 2014.      The glamorous pair were among the star couples on the US dance circuit, often attending society parties.      Nigel Norrington 6 In action . . . Mel on stage      The ballerina is originally from Williamsburg, Virginia, and trained at the Eastern Virginia School for the Performing Arts before spending five years at the Kirov Academy of Ballet in Washington DC.      Unlike former hell-raiser Mick, Melanie previously revealed she is not interested in leading a wild lifestyle.      She said: “Offstage I like to read. On breaks, I usually go to (American bookshop) Barnes & Noble.”      The Rolling Stones have 18 children between the four of them, ranging from one month to 48 years old.      Charlie Watts has one, Ronnie Wood has six, Mick has seven and Keith Richards four.      Keith also tragically lost his daughter Tara to Sudden Infant Death Syndrome in 1976 when she was ten.

The singer’s eldest is Karis Hunt Jagger, 45, from his relationship with US star Marsha Hunt, 70. He then had Jade Jagger, now 44, with ex-wife Bianca Jagger, 71. Mick has four kids with ex-partner Jerry Hall, 60 – Elizabeth, 32, James, 30, Georgia, 24 and Gabriel, 18. In 1999 he had a love child, Lucas, 17, after an affair with Brazilian model and TV host Luciana Gimenez, 46. His infidelity resulted in the end of his relationship with Hall. Earlier this year Gimenez described him as a “wonderful dad” and added: “I like to raise my child with his dad, with his help and advice. He’s a very wise man and he is passionate about his kids.” Mick has only been married once, to Bianca Jagger (formerly Dee Macias) in 1971, but she filed for divorce seven years later citing his adultery as the reason. He also wed Jerry Hall in private ceremony in Bali but it was later declared unlawful by the High Court of England and Wales.      This will be Mick’s eighth child with five different women.

Prior to the ballerina, Jagger was in a long-term relationship with fashion designer L’Wren Scott from 2001 to 2014. The former model, 49, shocked the world when she committed suicide in March 2014, and reportedly left her 9 million estate to Jagger.            “I am still struggling to understand how my lover and best friend could end her life in this tragic way,” he wrote in a Facebook post shortly after her death. “We spent many wonderful years together and had made a great life for ourselves. She had great presence and her talent was much admired, not least by me.”            The rocker paid tribute to his designer love on April 28 this year, on what would have been her 52nd birthday.      “Remembering L’Wren on her birthday,” he captioned an Instagram photo of his late girlfriend looking over her shoulder at him, with the sun setting behind her.

This article: Like other Spanish liberals, Goya was left in a difficult position after the French invasion. He had supported the initial aims of the French Revolution, and hoped its ideals would help liberate Spain from feudalism to become a secular, democratic political system. There were two conflicts being fought in Spain: the resistance against the French threat, and a domestic struggle between the ideals of liberal modernisation and the pre-political incumbent ruling class. The latter divide became more pronounced—and the differences far more entrenched—following the eventual withdrawal of the French.Several of Goya's friends, including the poets Juan Meléndez Valdés and Leandro Fernández de Moratín, were overt afrancesados: the supporters (or collaborators, in the view of many) of Joseph Bonaparte. He maintained his position as court painter, for which an oath of loyalty to Joseph was necessary. However, Goya had an instinctive dislike of authority, and witnessed first-hand the subjugation of his countrymen by French troops. During these years he painted little aside from portraits of figures from all parties, including an allegorical painting of Joseph Bonaparte in 1810, Wellington from 1812 to 1814, and French and Spanish generals. Meanwhile, Goya was working on drawings that would form the basis for The Disasters of War. He visited many battle sites around Madrid to witness the Spanish resistance. The final plates are testament to what he described as \\"el desmembramiento d'España\\"—the dismemberment of Spain. contains an answer for the question: What is the name of the person that maintained his position as court painter?, what is it ?

The Duke of Wellington is often incorrectly quoted as saying that \\"The Battle of Waterloo was won on the playing-fields of Eton\\". Wellington was at Eton from 1781 to 1784 and was to send his sons there. According to Nevill (citing the historian Sir Edward Creasy), what Wellington said, while passing an Eton cricket match many decades later, was, \\"There grows the stuff that won Waterloo\\", a remark Nevill construes as a reference to \\"the manly character induced by games and sport\\" amongst English youth generally, not a comment about Eton specifically. In 1889, Sir William Fraser conflated this uncorroborated remark with the one attributed to him by Count Charles de Montalembert's \\"C'est ici qu'a été gagné la bataille de Waterloo\\" (\\"It is here that the Battle of Waterloo was won.\\") In what year was Charles de Montalembert made a Duke?

Ne dorim o strategie de negociere realistă şi care poate fi pusă în practică, dar cum nu au fost stabilite priorităţi clare în acest raport, suntem de părere că acest obiectiv nu a fost îndeplinit. Translate this to English?","output":"We desire a realistic and practical negotiation strategy, but since clear priorities have not been established in this report, we believe that this objective has not been achieved. Here is a more detailed and longer explanation: We understand the importance of developing a negotiation strategy that is both realistic and capable of being implemented effectively. In order to achieve this, it is crucial to establish a set of clear priorities that all parties can agree upon, providing a solid foundation for the strategy. These priorities should accurately reflect the goals and objectives of the negotiation process, addressing the needs and concerns of all involved parties. However, the issue at hand is that the report, as it currently stands, fails to provide such a framework for establishing clear priorities. This can lead to confusion and misalignment among the parties, as well as inefficiency in the negotiation process. Without a common understanding of the main priorities, it becomes much more difficult to develop a cohesive and effective negotiation strategy. For a negotiation strategy to be successful, it must take into account several key factors. First and foremost, the strategy needs to be adaptable to the constantly changing dynamics and circumstances surrounding the negotiation. This includes the interests and agendas of the various parties involved, as well as any potential external factors that may impact the process. In addition, the negotiation strategy should ideally be rooted in a collaborative approach, fostering open communication and information sharing among all parties. This allows for the development of mutual trust and a greater likelihood of reaching an agreement that is satisfactory to all. Effective negotiation strategies also require a deep understanding of the issues at hand, as well as familiarity with the various bargaining tactics and techniques commonly used in negotiations. This knowledge can be invaluable in helping negotiators make informed decisions and navigate potential pitfalls. Overall, a well-thought-out and realistic negotiation strategy hinges on a clear set of priorities that are agreed upon by all parties. In order to achieve the desired outcome, this crucial foundation must first be laid and thoroughly discussed. In the absence of clearly defined priorities, the strategic goals of the negotiation process may not be well-defined, ultimately leading to a less effective and less successful negotiation."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

In Turkish, the adjective (368 sandalyeli) comes before the noun (parlamento çoğunluğu). - \\"allowing\\" can be translated as \\"olanak tanıyan\\" which means \\"enabling\\" or \\"providing the opportunity\\" in Turkish. - \\"it to amend\\" becomes \\"değiştirmesine\\" in Turkish. The verb \\"değiştirmek\\" means \\"to change\\" or \\"to amend\\", and the suffix \\"–me\\" indicates the action is potential. The additional \\"sine\\" allows the phrase to be used depending on context as “its amend.” - \\"the country's constitution\\" translates as \\"ülkenin anayasası\\".

The hypothesis suggests that \\"children are waiting in line to see Santa.\\" While it is possible that this might be the case, the premise does not provide any evidence to support or refute this hypothesis directly. For the hypothesis to be true, we would expect some information about the presence of children, the location (such as a mall or holiday event), or a reference to Santa. Furthermore, the presence of soldiers is not common in typical Santa Claus scenarios, where children wait in line to see Santa. Soldiers could be present for various reasons, such as a toy drive event, a military base holiday celebration, or even as an unrelated occurrence, like a security detail or event guards. The premise does not provide us with any contextual information about the soldiers or their intentions. So, even though the premise and the hypothesis might be related in some way, we cannot confirm the truth of the hypothesis based solely on the information provided in the premise. In conclusion, the premise alone does not tell us whether the hypothesis is true. Additional context and information would be required to make an accurate determination.

Like our sun, stars are unbelievably hot furnaces   that burn their own matter as fuel. When most of the fuel is used up, the star begins to die. The death of a star is not a quiet event. First there is a huge explosion. As its outer layer is blasted off into space, the dying star shines as brightly as a billion suns. After the explosion gravity pulls in what's left of the star. As the outside of the star sinks toward the center, the star gets smaller and smaller. The material the star is made of becomes tightly packed together. A star is so dense that a teaspoon of matter from it weighs billion of pounds. The more the star shrinks, the stronger the gravity inside it becomes. Soon the star is very tiny, and the gravity pulling it in is unbelievably strong. In fact, the gravity is so strong that it even pulls light into the star! Since all the light is pulled in, none can go out. The star becomes black when there is no light. Then a black hole is born! That's what we know about black holes. What we don't know is this: What happens inside a black hole after the star has been squeezed into a tiny ball? Does it keep getting smaller and smaller forever? Such a possibility is hard to imagine. But if the black hole doesn't keep shrinking, what happens to it? Some scientists think black holes are like doorways to another world. They say that as the star disappears from our universe, it goes into another universe. In other words a black hole in our universe could turn into a \\"white hole\\" in a different universe. As the black hole swallows light, the white hole shines brightly--somewhere else. But where? A different place, perhaps, or a different time -- many years in the past or future.

Snowshoes sometimes colloquially referred to as webs are footwear for walking over snow Add punctuation","output":"\\"Snowshoes,\\" sometimes colloquially referred to as \\"webs,\\" are footwear for walking over snow.  Snowshoes raise one's foot above the snow, spreading out the weight over a larger area in order to avoid sinking into the snow. This technique, known as 'flotation', enables the person wearing the snowshoes to traverse snowy areas that would otherwise be difficult or impossible to traverse on traditional footwear alone (due to the person's weight causing them to sink into the snow).  Snowshoes, although simple in their design, have a large impact on the ability to navigate in snowy conditions. There are numerous types of snowshoes available, but they generally all possess the same key design features: a robust frame that provides the necessary support and flotation, and a decking system (the part of the shoe that touches the snow) which can be made of a variety of materials but usually is a tough, synthetic material, designed to resist tears, punctures and general wear and tear from usage. The origins of the snowshoe can be traced back thousands of years to societies living in snowy environments. Originally, it is believed the snowshoes were developed by indigenous peoples of North America, who required the assistance of these devices to hunt and travel in the heavy snowfall areas. Over time, the use of snowshoes spread to other cultures and reached Europe, where they became an essential tool for winter survival and travel.   Modern day snowshoes have seen significant improvements in design, function, and materials used. There are now a variety of models designed to cater for different snow conditions and individual preferences, ranging from models with crampons (metal claws) for better grip in icy conditions, to lightweight models for sports such as snowshoe running and racing. Despite these advancements, the basic principle remains the same; to allow users to walk on snow without sinking or slipping.  In conclusion, snowshoes, or \\"webs\\" as they are sometimes referred to, are an incredibly important innovation in footwear that allow us to traverse snow considerably easier than we could without them. Their history is vibrant, rooted in survival and adaptation, and their presence is still very much evident in today's society—particularly in places where heavy snowfall is a common occurrence."},{"instruction":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

Article: U.S. Republican presidential candidate and former Governor Jeb Bush speaks at the North Texas Presidential Forum hosted by the Faith & Freedom Coalition and Prestonwood Baptist Church in Plano, Texas October 18, 2015.      WASHINGTON Republican Jeb Bush's struggling presidential campaign is cutting salaries across the board and reducing staff in a money-saving effort intended to concentrate resources on early voting states, an internal memo said on Friday.      The memo, seen by Reuters, said payroll costs were being slashed by 40 percent and staff at the campaign's Miami headquarters drastically cut back with some workers offered positions at reduced pay in states that vote early in the nominating process, such as New Hampshire, Iowa, South Carolina and Nevada.      The move follows a dramatic fall in Republican voters' support for Bush's attempt to secure his party's nomination for the November 2016 election and to become the third member of the famous Bush family to win the White House.      \\"We are making changes today to ensure Jeb is best positioned to win the nomination and general election,\\" the memo said.      Once considered the heavy favorite for the nomination, the former Florida governor is running far behind poll leaders Donald Trump and Ben Carson in national polls and in Iowa and New Hampshire, the first two states on the 2016 election nominating calendar.      Now, Bush is facing questions as to whether he has the ability to remain a viable candidate. A key test will be next week when he appears on stage with his rivals at the third Republican debate, in Boulder, Colorado.      Appearing at a forum on Friday at Regent University in Virginia Beach, Virginia, Bush was asked by moderator Pat Robertson whether the cost-cutting was aimed at making his campaign leaner \\"or does this mean you're in trouble?\\"      \\"This means lean and mean and means that I have the ability to adapt,\\" Bush said. \\"I have not met a person who thought Donald Trump would be the front-running candidate at this point. God bless him for his success in that regard. We'll see how long it lasts. But you have to adapt.\\"      In a poll of likely Iowa Republican caucus participants released on Thursday by Quinnipiac University, retired neurosurgeon Ben Carson led the Republican field with 28 percent support, followed by Trump at 20 percent. Bush was tied in sixth place with former business executive Carly Fiorina with 5 percent.      Bush's move to reduce expenses comes a month after the departure from the race of Wisconsin Governor Scott Walker, who ran out of cash.      \\"If you do the right thing about budget cuts at the right time, they don't necessarily affect your chances,\\" said Republican strategist Charlie Black, citing the examples of Ronald Reagan in 1979 and John McCain in 2007.      DONOR RETREAT THIS WEEKEND      Bush's heavy policy focus has shown him to be among the more serious candidates in the Republican field, but he has often been drowned out by Trump's bombastic rhetoric and has lacked the polished communication skills of rivals such as U.S. Senator Marco Rubio of Florida.      Bush announced last week that his third-quarter fund-raising was 13.4 million, a competitive sum but not enough to finance the large campaign operation he had built. As of last week he had 10 million in cash on hand.      \\"It's no secret that the contours of this race have changed from what was anticipated at the start,\\" the memo said.      The Bush campaign also sought to reassure donors who have started to doubt that their candidate still has a path to the nomination.      Bush and his senior aides are staging a two-day donor retreat in Houston on Sunday and Monday that will feature appearances by his father, former President George H.W. Bush, and his brother former President George W. Bush.      The retreat will give donors a sense of where the campaign stands now and what is planned for the next 100 days, an aide said.      The staff deployments from Miami will have a special focus on increasing the Bush presence in New Hampshire. Bush will make more trips to the early voting states as well.      \\"We are unapologetic about adjusting our game plan to meet the evolving dynamics of this race to ensure that outcome,\\" the memo said.      The cost-cutting moves were welcome in the Bush donor community, where there have been concerns about his prospects.      \\"I particularly appreciate that this strategy shift was quick, strategic and bold. As a donor, I am thrilled to see the campaign focus the lion's share of resources on voter contact and this will redirect energy to early states,\\" said Slater Bayliss, a Florida lobbyist who is bundling donations for Bush.      (Additional reporting by Ginger Gibson; Editing by Paul Simao and Frances Kerry) ||||| Jeb Bush, once a front-runner for the Republican presidential nomination, is slashing pay across the board for his struggling campaign as he attempts to regain traction just 100 days before the party’s first nominating contest.      The campaign is removing some senior staff from the payroll, parting ways with some consultants, and downsizing its Miami headquarters to save more than 1 million per month and cut payroll by 40 percent this week, according to Bush campaign officials who requested anonymity to speak about internal changes. Senior leadership positions remain unchanged.      The campaign is also cutting back 45 percent of its budget, except for dollars earmarked for TV advertising and spending for voter contacts, such as phone calls and mailers. Some senior-level staff and consultants will continue to work with the campaign on a volunteer basis, while other junior-level consultants, primarily in finance but including other areas, will be let go, the officials said. The officials declined to say who would be removed from the payroll or provide an exact dollar figure for the savings. (A summary of the changes, provided to Bloomberg Politics by the campaign, is posted here.)      Bush's advisers, under pressure from their donors and from falling and stagnant poll numbers, have been discussing ways to retool the campaign in recent days, and came to the conclusion that a course correction was essential. While recent tangles with Donald Trump have energized the campaign, Bush's senior team recognized a more fundamental set of changes was required that didn't involve dealing directly with the party's surprising—and surprisingly durable—front-runner.      \\"The circumstances when we started the election were different,\\" Bush told Pat Robertson in an interview at Regent University hours after news of the shakeup broke. \\"I have not met a person that thought that Donald Trump would be the front running candidate at this point. God bless him for his success in that regard, we’ll see how long that lasts. But you have to adapt.” He said his new \\"lean and mean\\" campaign will allow him to do that. \\"Every dollar we can save in overhead is a dollar that goes on television, goes on radio, goes on media, goes on voter outreach,\\" Bush added.      Analysts and rival campaigns will view the changes as a desperate act, perhaps the last one, of a man whose campaign has dropped in the polls in recent months and has remained mired in the middle of a crowded field despite a month-long blitz of friendly television ads. None of the changes deal directly with what even many of Bush's supporters say is his main challenge: The burden of trying to convince voters hungry for change to choose a man whose father and brother both served as president.      Officials said the changes—the second time the campaign has cuts its payroll this year—will enable them to shift more resources into New Hampshire, where the campaign has the largest operation in the state, and other states where early voters begin casting ballots in February. There will be more volunteers and surrogates for Bush, which the campaign refers to as “friends of Jeb,” on the ground to help in a state that his brother lost in 2000 and his father won in 1988.      One Bush adviser told Bloomberg Politics in an interview Friday morning that the team was “unapologetic” about the changes, saying the moves were from a “position of strength.” “This is about winning the race,” the adviser said. “We’re doing it now and making the shifts with confidence. We expect to win.”      Bush plans to continue to focus on a core message that argues that he has experience to make the kinds of fundamental changes voters want to see in Washington. The campaign changes reflect that, an adviser said.      Get the latest on global politics in your inbox, every day. Get our newsletter daily.      The campaign claims to have the most extensive field operation in Iowa, New Hampshire, South Carolina, and Nevada, states with the first four nominating contests. Bush had 10.3 million available for the primary race as of Oct. 1, about the same as U.S. Senator Marco Rubio, but less than U.S. Senator Ted Cruz and Dr. Ben Carson. Right to Rise USA, the super-PAC being run by Mike Murphy, raised 103 million in the first six months of the year.      Still, many thought Bush would keep the pole position heading into the 2016 primary calendar. But the former Florida governor and his advisers had little choice but to make the changes to redirect resources and attempt to create a new narrative for the campaign before the Feb. 1 caucuses in Iowa and—more importantly for Bush—the Feb. 9 primary in New Hampshire.      In a presidential campaign cycle that has already seen stunning twists and turns, to see the presumed establishment front-runner, whose strength was based in part on his fundraising capacity, have to make these kinds of cuts, is one of the most surprising developments so far.      One of Bush's rivals, Carson, who leads in a new Bloomberg Politics/Des Moines Register Iowa Poll, was taken aback in an interview Friday morning that Bush is being forced to make some changes.      “This is a little bit surprising, but you know a lot of his money, of course, was super-PAC money as opposed to campaign money,” Carson said in an interview that will air on With All Due Respect today on Bloomberg TV. “That doesn't give you as much flexibility, quite frankly.”      The campaign said its internal measures showed that the month-long run of TV advertising is having an impact. “We need to double down and triple down in the early states,” another Bush official said.      Bush, who aides said was actively involved in the decision to cut back, will spend less time raising money and more time engaged in retail political events, such as town halls, meet-and-greets, and one-on-one meetings, advisers said.      Although Bush's long-time political adviser, Murphy, who now runs the pro-Bush super-PAC backing his candidacy, told Bloomberg Politics recently that Bush's strength in the March contests would earn him the nomination, the changes are an acknowledgement that Bush needs to first improve his standing in Iowa, New Hampshire, South Carolina, and Nevada.      Symbolically, the changes turn Bush from an establishment battleship into a more scrappy underdog, making radical alterations in how the campaign operates in order to avoid the existential threat the campaign now faces. When his brother George W. Bush ran for president in 2000, he was the fundraising leader from start to finish and never had to contemplate such draconian cuts.      The changes come a week after Danny Diaz, Bush’s campaign manager, sought to ease concerns about the amount of cash being spent by pointing to campaign’s robust operation in states with the earliest primary contests.      Polls from Bloomberg Politics this week showed Bush in fifth place in Iowa and a distant third in New Hampshire.      (Contributing: Arit John) |||||       (Steve Marcus/Las Vegas Sun via AP)      Jeb Bush is shaking up his struggling presidential campaign, ordering across-the-board pay cuts, downsizing his headquarters staff, cutting ties with some consultants and refocusing his efforts on retail campaigning and on-the-ground organizing in the early voting states.      Bush's major course correction, first reported Friday by Bloomberg Politics, comes as the onetime front-runner languishes in the single digits in polls and struggles to catch on with Republican voters. The former Florida governor's fundraising slowed over the summer, and his donors and other supporters have grown concerned about his standing in the race.      In a statement Friday morning announcing the moves, campaign spokeswoman Kristy Campbell said, \\"We are making changes today to ensure Jeb is best positioned to win the nomination and general election. Jeb is the one candidate with a proven conservative record, bold ideas and the strong leadership needed to fix the problems America faces. We are moving our resources into the states to ensure that voters in primary and caucus states are introduced to his record and vision for the future.\\"      The campaign, which entered October with 10.3 million in the bank, is taking significant steps to curtail spending. It is slashing its budget, excluding media and voter contact efforts, by 45 percent from its June plans, and is reducing ties to some consultants to eliminate what the campaign sees as extraneous overhead costs.      The campaign also is reducing payroll by 40 percent, including salary cuts for every employee save the most entry-level staffers. Only 25 percent of the staff will remain at the Miami headquarters, with another 25 percent already in early voting states, and the majority of remaining staff offered positions in the states or as part of a ballot access team at a reduced wage.      The campaign also will cut travel expenses by 20 percent and overhaul Bush's schedule, shifting focus from fundraising events to make space on the candidate's calendar for more town hall meetings and other retail campaign stops in the early voting states.      In a two-page memorandum outlining talking points for supporters, the Bush campaign cast the changes as \\"deft\\" moves to position Bush for the long haul. The campaign is doubling down on its organizing efforts in Iowa, New Hampshire, Nevada and South Carolina, as well as its investments in data and digital programs.      The campaign is placing what it calls \\"a special focus\\" on its New Hampshire operation, which already includes 12 paid staffers. The Bush team has long eyed the Granite State's primary as his best opportunity for an early victory.      \\"We are in this campaign to win,\\" read the memorandum. \\"We will take every single step necessary to ensure Jeb is the Republican nominee and next President of the United States. We are unapologetic about adjusting our game plan to meet the evolving dynamics of this race to ensure that outcome.\\"      Bush plans to adjust his message on the campaign trail to better woo voters, according to the memorandum. The campaign will deliver several direct pitches to voters, including \\"Jeb Can Fix It,\\" arguing that after President Obama's two terms Bush is the only candidate in the 2016 field who can \\"fix\\" what he sees as broken in Washington. Bush also will make an \\"experience vs. experiment\\" argument, comparing his Florida record to his opponents who have less experience in government or who \\"cannot be trusted.\\"      Bush has been considered the fundraising leader of the Republican field in large part because of the 103 million he raised in the first six months of this year for his allied super PAC, Right to Rise, which can accept unlimited donations.      But Bush has had a harder time raising money for his official campaign, for which donations are capped under federal law at 2,700 per person. The campaign raised 13.4 million in July, August and September — a solid haul, but not enough to maintain the kind of national campaign infrastructure he had been building in Miami and the early voting states.      Bush has raised just 5 percent of his primary money from donors who gave him 200 or less so far this year, for a total of 1.2 million in all. Even former Arkansas governor Mike Huckabee beat him in small donations, collecting 1.3 million so far, according to an analysis by the nonpartisan Campaign Finance Institute.      Such a tiny base of grass-roots support can be perilous for a campaign, which needs to be able to rely on a constant infusion of cash as it expands.      This is the second round of belt-tightening in Bush's campaign. In August, some top aides had their salaries shaved, and there were other targeted cutbacks to create a more lean operation, as The New York Times first reported, though Friday's announcement is far more sweeping.      Two people familiar with the campaign said they were not surprised by the news. \\"This necessary tightening has been in the works for a while,\\" said one, who, along with his colleague, asked not to be identified because he was not authorized to speak about the changes. The extent of the cuts, hefty for some senior staffers, became evident in the last few days through conversations with campaign advisers grumbling about the cuts.      The announcement comes ahead of a quarterly strategy summit with major supporters in Houston this weekend, where top donors will hear updates from senior campaign officials and visit with members of the Bush family, including former president George H.W. Bush and former president George W. Bush.

We have made investments that have allowed us to do what      serious, national campaigns must do to be competitive in the primary and general elections, including:            o      o      o      o      Growing a real ground game in the early primary and caucus states;      Building a sophisticated data and digital operation;      Rolling out a serious policy agenda;      Getting on the ballot in every state in the nation.      •      It’s no secret that the contours of this race have changed from what was anticipated at the start. We      would be less than forthcoming if we said we predicted in June that a reality television star supporting      Canadian-­‐style single-­‐payer health care and partial-­‐birth abortion would be leading the GOP Primary.      •      Ensuring we are in the most competitive position possible in this unpredictable field requires we      remain as deft as possible, making strategic decisions quickly and intelligently.      •      We are in this campaign to win. We will take every single step necessary to ensure Jeb is the      Republican nominee and next President of the United States. We are unapologetic about adjusting our      game plan to meet the evolving dynamics of this race to ensure that outcome.      •      In order to achieve this end, the campaign is making aggressive changes to our campaign structure,      putting as much money as possible into voter contact, and winning primaries and caucuses.            Campaign Structure:            • Over the last four months, our team has consistently reviewed our budget and made spending      reductions, including: budget cuts by department and salary reductions to senior and mid-­‐level      staffers.            •      Today, we are expanding those reductions in order to maximize our resources where they matter      most: voter contact and personnel in the early states to ensure we can be successful in the primaries      and caucuses.      •      To achieve that objectives we are making the following changes:      o Reducing payroll costs by 40% this week;      o Cutting salaries across the board, with all but the most entry level staff taking cuts;      o Downsizing our headquarters staff: 25% is remaining in headquarters, 25% of our staff is already in      the states; the vast majority of the remaining staff is being offered a position in the early states or      as part of our ballot access efforts at a reduced salary;      o Cutting travel costs by 20%;      o Eliminating other extraneous overhead costs entirely, cutting 45% of our non media/voter contact      budget from our original June planning.                  •      •      We continue to have a strong national finance operation that will ensure Jeb remains competitive by      every measure, through the primary and onto victory next November. Just last week announced that      we had raised more than 13 million for the third quarter with 10 million in the bank, and continue      with aggressive fundraising today and moving forward.            We already have the most extensive field operations in all four early primary states, and as we now      move closer to voting season, we are going to grow the further.      o      o      o      o                  Iowa – 10 paid staffers, 2 offices – Jeb’s ground game is the “best campaign in the bracket.”      according to Iowa conservative journalist Craig Robinson.      New Hampshire – 12 paid staffers, 1 office – “Jeb grows ground operation, biggest in the state.”      South Carolina – 8 paid staffers, 3 offices – Expanded grassroots teams in South Carolina.      Nevada – 8 paid staffers, 2 offices – “When you ask voters in NV which campaign they are hearing      from, the most common answer is Bush.”      •      With staff deployments from headquarters, we are placing a special focus on increasing our New      Hampshire operation – already the most significant in the field – to ensure it remains that way, from      now until February.      •      Iowa, New Hampshire, South Carolina and Nevada can expect to see more visits from Jeb and longer      trips. We will use the campaign’s best asset – Jeb Bush – and put him in front of as many voters as      possible.            Strategic Positioning:            Jeb Can Fix It            •      For these operational changes to be successful, we recognize the need to better emphasize the      arguments surrounding Jeb’s record and adjust the campaign’s strategic positioning.      •      Jeb Can Fix It: We’re going to focus the argument of this campaign around the fact that after seven      years of incompetence, corruption and gridlock in Washington, we need a president “Who Can Fix It.”      And Jeb is the only person in the field on both sides of the aisle who can make this statement.            o Experience vs. Experiment: Jeb is the one candidate with a proven conservative record, bold ideas      and the strong leadership needed to fix the problems America faces. We will aggressively drive      that message, against opponents who have either created the problem, proven incapable of fixing      it or cannot be trusted. Jeb is the one who can do the job.      o National Security: Jeb will increase the emphasis on the need for a strong, experienced leader who      will rebuild our military and have the resolve to defeat the terrorists. Hillary Clinton’s disastrous      tenure as Secretary of State leaves her extremely vulnerable to an electorate looking for the United      States to restore its leadership role in the world.      o Broken Washington: As governor, Jeb Bush issued more than 2,500 line item vetoes totaling more      than 2 billion, which includes millions of dollars in earmarks pursued by Florida legislators. Under      the current administration, spending has exploded and the debt has risen to unsustainable levels      and Jeb is the only candidate who can credibly argue he will rein it in and turn it around.      •      The release of Jeb’s e-­‐book in a couple weeks will be another opportunity to revisit his strong      leadership in Florida and show that if he could fix it in Florida, he can fix Washington.            #             ||||| ADVERTISEMENT      Click here for the 2020 Primary Schedule      The 2016 Presidential primary schedule is finally set.

Answer the above question based on the context below:  San Francisco (SF; , Spanish: [sam fɾanˈsisko]; Spanish for 'Saint Francis'), officially the City and County of San Francisco, is a city in, and the cultural, commercial, and financial center of, Northern California. San Francisco is the 13th-most populous city in the United States, and the fourth-most populous in California, with 883,305 residents as of 2018. It covers an area of about 46.89 square miles (121.4 km2), mostly at the north end of the San Francisco Peninsula in the San Francisco Bay Area, making it the second-most densely populated large US city, and the fifth-most densely populated U.S. county, behind only four of the five New York City boroughs. San Francisco is also part of the fifth-most populous primary statistical area in the United States, the San Jose–San Francisco–Oakland, CA Combined Statistical Area (9.67 million residents). As of 2017, it was the seventh-highest income county in the United States, with a per capita personal income of 119,868. As of 2015, San Francisco proper had a GDP of 154.2 billion, and a GDP per capita of 177,968. The San Francisco CSA was the country's third-largest urban economy as of 2017, with a GDP of 907 billion.  Of the 500+ primary statistical areas in the US, the San Francisco CSA had among the highest GDP per capita in 2017, at 93,938. San Francisco was ranked 14th in the world and third in the United States on the Global Financial Centres Index as of September 2018.San Francisco was founded on June 29, 1776, when colonists from Spain established Presidio of San Francisco at the Golden Gate and Mission San Francisco de Asís a few miles away, all named for St. Francis of Assisi. The California Gold Rush of 1849 brought rapid growth, making it the largest city on the West Coast at the time. San Francisco became a consolidated city-county in 1856. San Francisco's status as the West Coast's largest city peaked between 1870 and 1900, when around 25% of California's population resided in the city proper.  After three-quarters of the city was destroyed by... A:","output":"Based on the context provided and the city's history, most people in San Francisco tend to vote for the Democratic Party. San Francisco is a culturally diverse and progressive city located in Northern California. This region has a historical reputation for being liberal and leaning towards the Democratic Party, as it often supports progressive policies and candidates.  In recent elections, San Francisco has demonstrated considerable support for Democratic Party candidates. For instance, in the 2020 Presidential election, Joe Biden, the Democratic candidate, secured 85.4% of the votes in San Francisco, while Republican candidate Donald Trump only received 12.7%. Similarly, in the 2016 Presidential election, Democratic candidate Hillary Clinton garnered 85.5% of the votes in San Francisco, while Republican candidate Donald Trump received only 9.5%.  This Democratic-leaning trend in San Francisco is also evident in local and state elections. In the 2018 California State Senate elections, Democratic candidate Scott Wiener won 74.9% of the vote in his district, which included parts of San Francisco, while his Republican opponent received only 25.1%. Furthermore, all members of the Board of Supervisors, the legislative body for the City and County of San Francisco, are members of the Democratic Party. Several factors contribute to San Francisco's political leaning. The city has a high proportion of residents with college degrees, who tend to vote Democratic. Additionally, San Francisco has a large LGBTQ+ community, which tends to align with the Democratic Party's progressive stance on social issues. Moreover, the city's diverse ethnic and racial demographics, including a significant Asian and Hispanic population, influence its voting patterns, as these groups have historically exhibited a greater affinity for the Democratic Party in the United States. In conclusion, most people in San Francisco vote for the Democratic Party, due to the city's progressive and diverse nature, as well as its historical inclination towards liberal and Democratic causes. Recent election results at the local, state, and national levels have consistently demonstrated San Francisco's strong support for the Democratic Party."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

The epicenter was in Wenchuan County, Ngawa Tibetan and Qiang Autonomous Prefecture, 80 km west/northwest of the provincial capital of Chengdu, with its main tremor occurring at 14:28:01.42 China Standard Time (06:28:01.42 UTC), on May 12, 2008 lasting for around 2 minutes, in the quake almost 80% of buildings were destroyed. What percentage of buildings were destroyed during the quake?","output":"During the quake, approximately 80% of the buildings were destroyed. This devastating percentage signifies a major calamity which would have led to extensive damage to both livelihoods and infrastructure. This includes residential homes, commercial properties, and public structures such as schools and hospitals. The debris resulting from this disaster would have rendered many roads unusable, complicating rescue and relief efforts. The high percentage indicates that the buildings probably were not adequately designed to withstand a quake of such intensity. Buildings in active seismic zones usually follow specific architectural and constructional regulations designed to limit damage in the event of an earthquake. These regulations usually include the use of flexible construction materials, reinforcement of structural elements, and strategic architectural planning. However, when we observe such a substantial percentage of destruction, it's likely these regulations were not adequately enforced or maybe were not in place. The earthquake, having a tremendous magnitude of 8.0 on the Ms scale and 7.9 on the Mw scale, struck Wenchuan County, Ngawa Tibetan and Qiang Autonomous Prefecture. These magnitude levels are indicative of extremely violent shaking and severe potential for destruction. Moreover, due to the proximity of the epicenter to densely populated areas like Chengdu, the capital of Sichuan Province, the disaster was especially catastrophic. The earthquake didn’t just occur briefly; it lasted approximately 2 minutes. In earthquakes, the duration is a critical factor along with the intensity. This lengthy time duration would have not just resulted in a continued destructive process, but it would also enhance panic and could potentially have caused more injuries and deaths due to accidents associated with the confusion and fear. Recovery and rebuilding following this scale of disaster would have been both time-consuming and extremely costly. It would involve clearing away an enormous quantity of rubble, locating and identifying casualties, providing emergency assistance to survivors, and eventually embarking on a massive reconstruction project to restore the affected areas. This would demand local, national and potentially international involvement and aid. Overall, the figure of 80% destruction presents a stark depiction of devastation and underlines the importance of earthquake preparedness particularly in regions prone to seismic activity. It signifies the human, infrastructural, and economic tragedies that can result from natural disasters like the severe earthquake which took place in Wenchuan County on May 12, 2008."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Article: When you choose a freezer, remember it's probably going to be with you for a long time. So it's important to know which freezer is right for your needs.    First, decide if you want an upright or chest model. Uprights are more convenient. Their storage space is more accessible and they take up less floor area. However, chest models are more energy-efficient because less cold air escapes when they are open.    If you are buying an upright, you'll have to choose between frostless  or manual  defrost . Chest freezers are always manual. Frostless freezers automatically defrost at present intervals  and remove the water. Manual models must be defrosted by hand every few months or whenever frost pile up to about a quarter of an inch.    To help your freezer reach a ripe old age, try to find a spot that's cool, dry, and away fromdrafts . Drafts and heat will raise the freezer's cabinet temperature, which makes it work harder to keep cool. That means wasted energy. That means wasted energy and a shortened life.    Dry air is important because highhumidity  can cause the freezer to rust outside and frost up inside. With proper care, a freezer can serve you for 15 years or more. Regular cleaning and simple maintenance will help it maintain a zero-degree temperature and keep it smelling fresh and looking almost new.    Frostless models requires less care than manual defrost freezers. The inside of a frostless unit should be washed periodically with warm water and baking soda or a mild soap, rinse, and dried.   Good habits go a long way toward a freezer that runs efficiently. To get the most from your freezer, check regularly to make sure it's providing a true zero-degree temperature.   Keep the freezer at least three-quarters full. The emptier it get, the more energy is wasted. If more than three pounds of food per cubic foot of storage space is added every 24 hours, the resulting high or low temperature can damage the food.

She had presented a talk on black holes in the evening, but was found dead in the morning by the manager of the observatory. She had been shot in the face, but there was no weapon. There is a sock and a jar of moisturizing cream found at the scene. The manager claims that he was out all night with an associate. The sock is traced to Jennifer's boyfriend, who claims he left hurriedly to work on a new theory. Jennifer's home is full of tchotchkes and other old nick-nacks. Mike passes out when she picks up a Florida snow globe, and imagines unique blue marbles similar to one that is on a string around her neck. When she comes to, she talks about the marble, and how she doesn't remember where it came from. She was an orphan, and has always had it. Her co-investigator and supervisor suggest that this looks like \\"The .38 Caliber Killer\\", who killed young women, but hadn't struck in many years. The murderer always exchanged nick nacks with his victims. While doing a more detailed search of the area, Mike finds a gun in a case, and a red scarf she had been having dreams about. The gun, a .38 revolver, is traced to the observatory manager, who admits he found it, and tried to dispose of it so he wouldn't be a suspect. Figuring from where the gun originally lay, Mike concludes that Jennifer had shot herself. The investigators agree.

The women said Boko Haram fighters started pelting them when they refused to run away as the army came nearer.      A group of nearly 300 women and children was brought out of the vast Sambisa forest to a government camp.      The military says it has rescued more than 700 people in the past week in an offensive against the Islamist group.      The women said several were killed in the stoning, but they did not know how many.

Some were forced into marriage.      One woman, Lami Musa, 27, said she had avoided that fate.      \\"When they realised I was pregnant, they said I was impregnated by an infidel [her husband] and they killed him,\\" she said.

Image copyright AP Image caption Some of the children are severely malnourished      Image copyright Reuters Image caption Many are now eating their first proper meal for months      Other survivors said the militant Islamists never let them out of their sight - not even when they went to the toilet.      \\"They didn't allow us to move an inch,\\" one of the freed women, Asabe Umaru, told Reuters news agency. \\"We were kept in one place. We were under bondage.\\"      One woman described how they were fed just one meal a day.      \\"We were fed only ground dry maize in the afternoons.

Some of the children were \\"just little skeletal bodies with flaps of skin that make them look like old people\\", Associated Press reporter Michelle Faul told the BBC after visiting the camp where survivors were staying.      A doctor, Muhammad Amin Suleiman, said many severely malnourished babies and children had been put on intravenous drips at a clinic.      The women and children travelled for three days on pick-up trucks from the vast Sambisa forest where they were rescued, to the camp in the city of Yola, where they arrived on Saturday night.      Chibok girls      Through interviews, officials have determined that almost all those rescued are from Gumsuri, a village near the town of Chibok, the Associated Press news agency reports.      Image copyright Reuters Image caption Women have also been receiving check-ups at a clinic      It does not appear that any of those released are from the group of more than 200 Chibok schoolgirls kidnapped by Boko Haram a year ago in a mass abduction that led to worldwide protests calling for the girls' release.      Thousands have been killed in northern Nigeria since Boko Haram began its insurgency in 2009 to create an Islamic state.      In February, Nigeria's military, backed by troops from neighbouring countries, launched a major offensive against the Islamist fighters, recapturing most of the territory Boko Haram had taken in the previous year.      Their last remaining hideouts are believed to be in the Sambisa forest, which surrounds a reserve of the same name. ||||| YOLA, Nigeria Boko Haram fighters killed older boys and men in front of their families before taking women and children into the forest where many died of hunger and disease, freed captives said on Sunday after they were brought to a government refugee camp.      The Nigerian army rescued hundreds of women and children last week from the Islamist fighters in northern Nigeria's Sambisa Forest in a major operation that has turned international attention to the plight of hostages.      After days on the road in pickup trucks, hundreds were released on Sunday into the care of authorities at a refugee camp in the eastern town of Yola, to be fed and treated for injuries. They spoke to reporters for the first time.      \\"They didn't allow us to move an inch,\\" said one of the freed women, Asabe Umaru, describing her captivity. \\"If you needed the toilet, they followed you. We were kept in one place. We were under bondage.      \\"We thank God to be alive today. We thank the Nigerian army for saving our lives,\\" she added.      Two hundred and seventy-five women and children, some with heads or limbs in bandages, arrived in the camp late on Saturday.      Nearly 700 kidnap victims have been freed from the Islamist group's forest stronghold since Tuesday, with the latest group of 234 women and children liberated on Friday.      \\"When we saw the soldiers we raised our hands and shouted for help. Boko Haram who were guarding us started stoning us so we would follow them to another hideout, but we refused because we were sure the soldiers would rescue us,\\" Umaru, a 24 year-old mother of two, told Reuters.      The prisoners suffered malnutrition and disease, she said. \\"Every day we witnessed the death of one of us and waited for our turn.\\"      Another freed captive, Cecilia Abel, said her husband and first son had been killed in her presence before the militia forced her and her remaining eight children into the forest.      For two weeks before the military arrived she had barely eaten.      \\"We were fed only ground dry maize in the afternoons. It was not good for human consumption,\\" she said. \\"Many of us that were captured died in Sambisa Forest. Even after our rescue about 10 died on our way to this place.\\"      SPECIAL ATTENTION      The freed prisoners were fed bread and mugs of tea as soon as they arrived at the government camp. Nineteen were in hospital for special attention, Dr. Mohammed Aminu Suleiman of the Adamawa State Emergency Management Agency told Reuters.      The army said troops on patrol on Saturday had discovered 260 women and children in Adamawa state. Some had fled their homes during fighting while others had been abducted but managed to escape from the Islamists.      The military also said in a statement it had arrested a supplier of food and fuel to Boko Haram on Sunday morning.      Amnesty International estimates the insurgents, who are intent on bringing western Africa under Islamist rule, have taken more than 2,000 women and girls captive since the start of 2014. Many have been used as cooks, sex slaves or human shields.      The prisoners freed so far do not appear to include any of more than 200 schoolgirls snatched from school dormitories in Chibok town a year ago, an incident that drew global attention to the six-year-old insurgency.      Umaru said her group of prisoners never came in contact with the missing Chibok girls.      Nigerian troops alongside armies from neighboring Chad, Cameroon and Niger have won back swathes of territory from the fighters in the last couple of months.      Last year, the group exerted influence over an area bigger than Belgium. But a counter-attack launched in January has pushed them into Sambisa, a nature reserve. While the Nigerian army is confident it has the group cornered, a final push to clear them from the area has been curtailed by landmines.      President Goodluck Jonathan, who relinquishes power later in May after his election defeat to Muhammadu Buhari, has promised to hand over a Nigeria \\"free of terrorist strongholds\\".      Rampant corruption and a failure to stamp out the uprising in the north were factors that cost Jonathan the election won by Buhari, a former military ruler.

Some furnishings were transferred from Carlton House, and others had been bought in France after the French Revolution. The external façade was designed keeping in mind the French neo-classical influence preferred by George IV.

Sally encourages the children to be brave and to organise themselves. Travelling further back into the cave, they find an exit and escape, only to find their armed kidnappers in pursuit and furious. The school isolates itself into a second, \\"fortress\\"-like cave at the top of a hill, where they must prepare for the coming night, when the kidnappers will reach them at last. Sally realises that the kidnappers will have to die, and also that she cannot defeat four grown men without help. The children will have to fight back in order to save their own lives, but Sally grapples with the idea that she must, in essence, give these children permission to commit murder. Answer:","output":"The movie plot does not provide specific information about the walls of the cells. However, since the kidnapped school is held in a cave, it can be inferred that the walls are made of natural rock and earth formations found in caves."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant that follows instruction extremely well.

The Joker is a fictional supervillain created by Bill Finger, Bob Kane, and Jerry Robinson who first appeared in the debut issue of the comic book Batman (April 25, 1940), published by DC Comics. Credit for the Joker's creation is disputed; Kane and Robinson claimed responsibility for the Joker's design, while acknowledging Finger's writing contribution. Although the Joker was planned to be killed off during his initial appearance, he was spared by editorial intervention, allowing the character to endure as the archenemy of the superhero Batman. In his comic book appearances, the Joker is portrayed as a criminal mastermind. The Joker was one of the few popular villains continuing to appear regularly in Batman comics from the Golden Age into the Silver Age, as the series continued during the rise in popularity of mystery and romance comics. In 1951, Finger wrote an origin story for the Joker in Detective Comics #168, which introduced the characteristic of him formerly being the criminal Red Hood, and his disfigurement the result of a fall into a chemical vat.  By 1954, the Comics Code Authority had been established in response to increasing public disapproval of comic book content. The backlash was inspired by Frederic Wertham, who hypothesized that mass media (especially comic books) was responsible for the rise in juvenile delinquency, violence and homosexuality, particularly in young males. Parents forbade their children from reading comic books, and there were several mass burnings. The Comics Code banned gore, innuendo and excessive violence, stripping Batman of his menace and transforming the Joker into a goofy, thieving trickster without his original homicidal tendencies.  The character appeared less frequently after 1964, when Julius Schwartz (who disliked the Joker) became editor of the Batman comics. The character risked becoming an obscure figure of the preceding era until this goofy prankster version of the character was adapted into the 1966 television series Batman, in which he was played by Cesar Romero. The show's popularity compelled Schwartz to keep the comics in a similar vein. As the show's popularity waned, however, so did that of the Batman comics. After the TV series ended in 1968, the increase in public visibility had not stopped the comic's sales decline; editorial director Carmine Infantino resolved to turn things around, moving stories away from schoolboy-friendly adventures. The Silver Age introduced several of the Joker's defining character traits: lethal joy buzzers, acid-squirting flowers, trick guns, and goofy, elaborate crimes. Answer this question using a quote from the following article: What was the Silver Age?","output":"The Silver Age was a period in comic book history where stories and characters became more light-hearted and fun. During this time, the Joker turned into a goofy, thieving trickster, and many of his famous traits like lethal joy buzzers, acid-squirting flowers, and trick guns were introduced. This made the stories more appealing to younger readers and less violent or dark."},{"instruction":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

Read the text and determine if the sentence is true: The Reluctant Fundamentalist is a 2012 political thriller drama film based on the 2007 novel, \\"The Reluctant Fundamentalist\\" by Mohsin Hamid, directed by Mira Nair, starring Riz Ahmed and Kate Hudson in lead. \\"The Reluctant Fundamentalist\\" is a post-9/11 story about the impact of the Al Qaeda attacks on one Pakistani man and his treatment by Americans in reaction to them. Sentence: Al Qaeda attacks america on 9/11","output":"The sentence \\"Al Qaeda attacks America on 9/11\\" is true. The 9/11 terrorist attacks were a series of four coordinated assaults carried out by al-Qaeda, an Islamic extremist group, on the United States on Tuesday, September 11, 2001. The attacks devastated the nation and had a substantial impact on U.S. foreign and domestic policy. On that fateful day, 19 al-Qaeda terrorists hijacked four American passenger planes traveling on domestic routes, with the objective of using them as weapons to target high-profile symbols of American economic and political power. Two of the planes, American Airlines Flight 11 and United Airlines Flight 175, were flown into the North and South towers of the World Trade Center in New York City. Almost 3,000 people died as the two towers collapsed, including a large number of firefighters and other rescue workers who rushed to the scene to help. Another plane, American Airlines Flight 77, was flown into the Pentagon building in Arlington, Virginia, causing significant damage and resulting in the deaths of 189 people, including the 64 passengers on board. The fourth hijacked plane, United Airlines Flight 93, was heading towards Washington, D.C., but crashed into a field in Pennsylvania after passengers attempted to overpower the hijackers. All people on board Flight 93 lost their lives, but their actions potentially saved countless others by forcing the plane to crash short of its intended target. These attacks were the deadliest act of terrorism on U.S. soil and prompted an immediate response from the U.S. government and its allies, including the launch of the War on Terror, which involved military intervention in Afghanistan and Iraq, as well as significant changes to domestic security policy, with the establishment of the Department of Homeland Security, the introduction of the USA PATRIOT Act, and the implementation of new airport security measures. In the context of the text mentioned, \\"The Reluctant Fundamentalist\\" by Mohsin Hamid, the novel and subsequent film adaptation explore the life of a Pakistani man who went to the United States for education and career opportunities but was deeply affected by the 9/11 attacks and the American reaction to them. The story highlights the emotional turmoil experienced by many people of South Asian or Middle Eastern descent who were unfairly treated with suspicion and hostility in the aftermath of the attacks, and it serves as a poignant reminder of the complex social and political repercussions that 9/11 has had on individuals and societies around the world."},{"instruction":"Given a definition of a task and a sample input, break the definition into small parts.

Hypothesis: The only people who call in are those whose only issue is that they are bored.  Does the premise entail the hypothesis? Available options: 1. yes 2. it is not possible to tell 3. no","output":"3. no The premise does not entail the hypothesis. The premise provided information about two specific types of calls: those from people denied food stamps and those with problems with their landlords. The hypothesis suggests that the only people who call in are those who are bored. These two statements are not logically connected, nor does the premise lead to or support the hypothesis. In order to determine if the premise entails the hypothesis, we would need to analyze the relationship between the two statements. Entailment would require that, if the premise is true, then the hypothesis must also be true due to a direct connection or logical implication. In this case, however, there is no such connection between the two. The premise provides a sample of the types of calls received and implies that there are people with real difficulties and issues who are looking for assistance. On the other hand, the hypothesis deals with a completely different type of caller, one who is motivated by boredom. This category of caller is not addressed or implied by the premise at all. Furthermore, the hypothesis is a negative statement, stating that the ONLY people who call in are those who are bored. This directly contrasts the premise, which acknowledges that there are callers with genuine issues, such as the denial of food stamps and landlord problems. Because the premise does not lead to or support the hypothesis, the two statements are not related in a way that could be considered entailment. In conclusion, the premise does not entail the hypothesis, and the available option to choose in this case is 3. no. The two statements provided information on different aspects of the topic, and there is no logical connection or implication that would lead from the premise to the hypothesis. Instead, these two statements offer different perspectives on the types of calls that might be received, without any clear link between them."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

There was no one really around in the grilling department, so he went off to find someone, while myself, and my daughter (in stroller) stalked by the grill/smoker we wanted (like it was going somewhere.)  He first tried in paint, to see if they could page somebody.... that person was texting. He came back to me, and I flagged someone down. We are able to get the grill we want rolled out to us... with some more supplies, we are off to checkout !  The woman who checked us out, was very nice, but didn't know what she was talking about. I am a Lowe's card holder, and get the 5% off nonsense. She told us that if we got 20 more in items, that we would receive interest free for 6 months. Sounded fine.. what's 20? My husband runs off and gets a fish basket.  She rings up the fish basket, and still, no interest free option shows up. She asks other cashiers, and says the amount isn't right. That we needed another 75 odd dollars to get interest free financing. No thanks.  So, off we go. With the grill on a dolly, a cart of goodies, and the stroller. The cashier did not offer to page anybody, and I guess we just didn't think of it. We must have looked funny, trying to manage all this.  Struggling in the parking lot, we notice two employees leaning on the wall of the building out front, chit chatting away and relaxing in the shade. Not assisting customers, not organizing things, but BS'ing.... they stood and watched us try and get to our car and load it.

After the thugs flee, the woman introduces herself as Beverly Switzler, and decides to take Howard to her apartment and let him spend the night. The following day, Beverly takes Howard to Phil Blumbertt, a scientist who Beverly hopes can help Howard return to his world. After Phil is revealed to be only a janitor, Howard resigns himself to life on Earth and rejects Beverly's aid. He soon applies for a job as a janitor at a local romance spa. Because of unfair treatment, Howard quits and rejoins Beverly, who plays in a band called Cherry Bomb. At the club where Cherry Bomb is performing, Howard comes across their manager, and confronts him when he insults the band. A fight breaks out, in which Howard is victorious. Howard rejoins Beverly backstage after the band's performance and accompanies her back to her apartment, where Beverly persuades him to be the band's new manager.

At age fourteen, his parents bought him another guitar, and he learned more songs from his uncle, Sam Lockhart. In early 1994, after \\"Worth Every Mile\\" fell from the charts, Tritt charted at number 21 with a cover of the Eagles' \\"Take It Easy\\". He recorded this song for the tribute album Common Thread: The Songs of the Eagles (released through Warner Bros.' Giant Records division), which featured country music artists' renditions of Eagles songs. When filming the music video for this song, Tritt requested that the band, which was on hiatus at the time, appear in it. This reunion inspired the Eagles' Hell Freezes Over Tour, which began that year.  His fourth album, Ten Feet Tall and Bulletproof, was released that May. Its lead-off single, \\"Foolish Pride\\", went to number one, and the fourth single, \\"Tell Me I Was Dreaming\\", reached number two. In between these songs were the title track at number 22 and \\"Between an Old Memory and Me\\" (originally recorded by Keith Whitley) at number 11. The album included two co-writes with Gary Rossington of Lynyrd Skynyrd, and guest vocals from Waylon Jennings and Hank Williams, Jr. on the cut \\"Outlaws Like Us\\". The album achieved platinum certification in December of that year, and later became his third double-platinum album. Allmusic reviewer Brian Mansfield said that Tritt was \\"most comfortable with his Southern rock/outlaw mantle\\" on it, comparing \\"Foolish Pride\\" favorably to \\"Anymore\\" and the work of Bob Seger. Alanna Nash praised the title track and \\"Tell Me I Was Dreaming\\" in her review for Entertainment Weekly, but thought that the other songs were still too similar in sound to his previous works.  1995's Greatest Hits: From the Beginning included most of his singles to that point, as well as two new cuts: the Steve Earle composition \\"Sometimes She Forgets\\" and a cover of the pop standard \\"Only You (And You Alone)\\".

Question: suppose there is a more need for satellites happens, how will it affect less cracks form in the rocks.  - A: more - B: less - C: no effect A:","output":"C: No effect To answer this question, let's think about the process step-by-step and justify our answer: 1. Water seeps into rocks: This event is determined by natural factors, such as rainfall and the permeability of rocks. The need for more satellites does not seem to have any direct influence on this process. 2. The water freezes and thaws: This is determined by temperature changes due to the climate. The need for more satellites does not seem to have any direct influence on this process either. 3. Cracks form in the rocks: As a result of freezing and thawing water, rocks expand and contract, leading to the formation of cracks. Additional factors that can cause cracks to form are pressure from other rocks and exposure to the elements. Again, more satellites are unrelated to these natural processes. 4. Cracks also form when rocks heat up: Rocks can crack due to extreme heat, which can be caused by activities such as volcanic eruptions or forest fires. While satellites may be used to monitor these events, they do not cause or influence the formation of cracks in rocks. 5. The rocks slowly break down: Over time, the processes mentioned previously will cause rocks to break down. This is all part of the natural rock cycle and has nothing to do with the need for more satellites. Based on the analysis of each step in the process, it can be concluded that an increased need for satellites has no direct effect on the formation of cracks in rocks.

At that very moment, a truck rams their car from behind and Paige crashes through the windshield. Both of them are rushed to the emergency room, and as Leo, in a voice-over talks about how \\"moments of impact help in finding who we are\\" the movie cuts to how Paige and Leo first met. The scenes of how they courted, became engaged and married at the Art Institute of Chicago and share a kiss under the Cloud Gate are interwoven with the present.

One of the surest ways to dampen your imaginative abilities is through persistent negative self-talk. You should try to remove this mental barrier by avoiding telling yourself that you lack imagination. Realize that imagination is inherent in all individuals, and it often requires practice and patience to develop. Start by giving yourself credit for your thoughts and ideas, regardless of how small they might appear. When you begin to acknowledge your imaginative capabilities, you are more likely to develop confidence and improve over time. (B) Instead of solely focusing on the possible inadequacies of your imagination, consider shifting your mindset and recognizing that you do possess imagination, albeit perhaps in need of some nurturing and development. Keep in mind that as with any skill, your imagination can grow and evolve. Intentionally seek out opportunities to engage with new experiences, experiment with different ways of thinking, and challenge yourself to explore unfamiliar territory. By doing this, you will refresh your perspective and stimulate your creative muscles, preventing your thoughts from feeling stale or limited. (C) The possibilities in life are endless; there are so many things. Imagine you are a caterpillar who swots up near some miraculous creature to eventually transform into a butterfly. Taking inspiration from nature, it is important to recognize that the journey of exploration and growth is a continuous process. By comparing yourself to a caterpillar that transforms into a butterfly, you can maintain a sense of wonder and curiosity about your own potential. Engage your imagination by comparing yourself to various creatures or elements in the natural world. This will help you to view your personal journey of self-discovery as an open-ended process full of possibilities and potential transformation. (D) When you need to think, let your imagination do the work. There's no need to go into details. Allow your imagination to take the lead in various aspects of your life by approaching situations with an open mind. Instead of getting bogged down by specifics or overanalyzing, try to maintain a sense of flexibility in your thought processes. This can be particularly helpful when problem-solving and brainstorming, as imaginative thinking allows you to explore unconventional solutions that may initially appear risky or improbable. By cultivating a willingness to think creatively, you will find that your ability to harness the power of your imagination – and overcome the notion that you don't have one – gradually becomes effortless and enjoyable."},{"instruction":"User will you give you a task with some instruction.

Answer this question: who drew the borders in the middle east??","output":"The borders in the Middle East were largely drawn during the early 20th century by the major imperial powers of the time – primarily Britain and France – through a series of agreements, treaties, and mandates following the collapse of the Ottoman Empire and the end of World War I. The process of drawing borders and carving out new states reflected competing geopolitical interests, colonial ambitions, and European disregard for the ethnic, religious, and tribal distinctions in the region. One of the key documents in defining the Middle Eastern borders was the 1916 Sykes-Picot Agreement, a secret understanding between Britain and France. Designed to divide the Arab provinces of the Ottoman Empire, the agreement aimed at carving out spheres of influence for both Britain and France. British diplomat Mark Sykes and French diplomat François Georges-Picot proposed dividing the region into areas of direct and indirect control. Essentially, the Sykes-Picot Agreement laid the foundation for what the map of the Middle East looks like today. However, the drawing of the borders was also influenced by the British-promised support for Arab independence, particularly in the 1915-1916 correspondence between Sir Henry McMahon, the British High Commissioner in Egypt, and Hussein bin Ali, the Sharif of Mecca. Encouraging an Arab revolt against the Ottoman Empire, the British negotiated Arab independence and the establishment of a unified Arab state. However, the British later backed away from these promises due to competing commitments in the region and their alliance with France. Moreover, the 1917 Balfour Declaration, a letter from the British Foreign Secretary Arthur Balfour to Baron Lionel Walter Rothschild, promised the establishment of a \\"national home for the Jewish people\\" in Palestine. This added further complexity to the border drawing process, overlapping with the conflicting territorial aspirations of Arabs and Zionists. After World War I, the drawing of the borders continued during the Peace Conference in Paris, further solidifying British and French control over the region as \\"mandates\\" under the League of Nations. The 1920 Treaty of Sèvres dissolved the Ottoman Empire, but its stipulations for carving out a Kurdish homeland were never implemented. The San Remo Conference in 1920 formalized the allocation of mandates to Britain and France in the Middle East. Under this arrangement, Britain was granted control over Palestine (later including Jordan), Iraq, and the Gulf States, while France received control over present-day Syria and Lebanon. Throughout the 1920s and 1930s, the borders were continuously adjusted in response to local unrest and negotiations among governing powers. However, the lasting impact of these arbitrary border drawings is still felt in the region today. The borders ignored ethnic, religious, and tribal divisions, creating a legacy of tension, conflict, and political instability in the Middle East. In summary, the borders in the Middle East were drawn primarily by Britain and France after World War I through a series of agreements, treaties, and mandates. The process was marked by conflicting interests, colonial ambitions, and disregard for the region's complex ethnic and religious landscape, which has contributed to the ongoing instability within the region."},{"instruction":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation. Think like you are answering to a five year old. In ‘Lila,’ Marilynne Robinson Gives a Prequel to ‘Gilead’ With her flawed but poignant new book, “Lila,” Marilynne Robinson has returned to the central characters in her Pulitzer Prize-winning novel, “Gilead” (2004) — the aging minister John Ames and his much younger wife, Lila — and to the themes of alienation and separateness (and the possibility of belonging) that animated her astonishing debut novel, “Housekeeping,” more than 30 years ago. “Gilead,” set in a small Iowa town, took the form of a letter that the dying Ames wrote to his son who was turning 7 — a meditation on their family history, his religious faith and his regrets and hopes. “Lila” — which might well have been titled “Balm in Gilead” — is his wife’s story, chronicling her precarious childhood and youth, and her efforts to come to terms with that legacy of emotional damage. The novel ends with the birth of her son, whom Ames would address, years later, in “Gilead.” Writing in lovely, angular prose that has the high loneliness of an old bluegrass tune, Ms. Robinson has created a balladlike story about two lost people who, after years of stoic solitariness, unexpectedly find love — not the sudden, transformative passion of romantic movies and novels but a hard-won trust and tenderness that grow slowly over time. The novel is powerful and deeply affecting, but also hobbled, at times, by the author’s curious decision to tell the story in the third person, robbing it of the emotional immediacy of “Gilead” and resulting in occasional passages that seem to condescend to Lila, as an uneducated, almost feral creature. Perhaps Ms. Robinson decided to tell the story in the third person out of concern that such an unlettered girl might not have the language for communicating her state of mind, or perhaps it was difficult to find a voice for Lila that could comfortably address the big existential questions of life while remaining authentic and plain-spoken. Lila, we quickly learn, knew abandonment and hardship growing up. She was so neglected by her family that when she was 4 or 5, a kindhearted itinerant worker named Doll snatched her up from her stoop and became her surrogate mother. (They are called “the cow and her calf.”) They travel with a band of other drifters led by a man named Doane, living off the land, taking the occasional farm job and a stint here and there doing gardening and household chores. Doll’s love for Lila is sustaining, but for Lila — as for the sisters in “Housekeeping,” whose mother committed suicide and who feared their eccentric Aunt Sylvie would desert them too — the fear of abandonment always lurks. At one point, after “the Crash,” when jobs are almost impossible to come by, Doll disappears for a couple of days, and Doane and the others try to leave Lila behind on the steps of a church in a no-name town. That time, Doll does come back, but later she gets into a knife fight with a man, and after the sheriff takes Doll away, Lila is truly on her own. She finds herself working in a whorehouse in St. Louis (where she develops a crush on a cad named Mack), and then for a long time she works as a cleaning lady at a hotel, putting aside money from each paycheck to go to the movies, which help sustain her emotionally. In the hands of another author, Lila’s back story might sound sentimental or contrived, but Ms. Robinson renders her tale with the stark poetry of Edward Hopper or Andrew Wyeth (“Christina’s World”), capturing the loneliness of her transient existence. This sense of rootlessness and dislocation will stay with Lila, making her skittish and wary, a wild child, afraid of belonging to anyone or caring too much. After Lila shows up at his church, Ames — whom Lila thinks of as “the old man” — will do his best to try to tame her with kindness and patience, even though she lashes out at him, in the beginning, with defensive anger and righteous pride. “When you’re scalded, touch hurts,” Ms. Robinson writes, “it makes no difference if it’s kindly meant.” Lila was taught by Doll to be leery of the world — to be quiet, to keep questions to herself, to never owe anything to anyone; and she not only misses Doll and their life on the road, but is also reluctant to trust in the kindness of strangers. And even as she finds herself oddly drawn to this “beautiful old man,” whose first wife died in childbirth many years ago, along with their infant, she is scared to leave herself vulnerable to feelings of hope and the dreams of safety and a future. “Gilead” emphasized how smitten the 67-year-old Ames was with Lila — the first experience of passion in his life, and so all-consuming it almost provoked him to make a fool of himself, running after her in the street. Because those feelings are not really explored here, Ames’s instant and unwavering attachment to Lila — especially in the face of her prickly, often hurtful behavior toward him — often seems mystifying in these pages: We are left with the incomplete (and not entirely convincing) suggestion that his unconditional devotion to her is the behavior of a saintly man of faith, who believes that God “looks after the strays.” In fact, it is Lila, questioning a church that might doom Doll and Doane and her other “heathen” traveling companions to a hellfire they don’t deserve, who makes the case for a wider, more encompassing faith that might provide balm for all the “scoundrels who happened to be orphans, or whose mothers didn’t even like them.” There are moments in this novel when Ms. Robinson unnecessarily italicizes and telegraphs Lila’s emotions. Of a knife that Doll gave her, she writes: “Other people had houses and towns and names and graveyards. They had church pews. All she had was that knife. And dread and loneliness and regret. That was her dowry.” Unlike the author’s ungainly 2008 novel, “Home” (which focused on Ames’s best friend and neighbor the Rev. Robert Boughton’s relationship with his troubled son, Jack), however, such lapses are sporadic. And by the end of the novel they’ve been swept away by Ms. Robinson’s moving depiction of Lila’s slow, halting acceptance of Ames’s love and their slow dance toward marital devotion. By its conclusion, the novel has become a haunting parable of the pastor Ames’s understanding of the Calvinist teaching “that people have to suffer to really recognize grace when it comes.” 261 pages.

Offensive line coach Chris Foerster of the 49ers talks with Andrew Tiller (61), Joe Staley (74) and Trent Brown (right) on the sideline during a recent home game against the Cincinnati Bengals, who won 24-14. One last game and 49ers season reaches its merciful end There is actually some good news for the 49ers: Barring overtime, it will all be finished after four more quarters. Yes, the merciful end to the 2015 season is near for a 4-11 team that ranks 31st in total offense, 28th in total defense, owns the league’s worst point differential (minus-152), has had eight losses of at least 14 points and will occupy the NFC West cellar for the first time since 2005. Leave it to plain-spoken left tackle Joe Staley to capture the mood entering the regular-season finale against the Rams on Sunday at Levi’s Stadium: “We have one more game left,” Staley said. “I want to be able to finish it out the right way and then kind of put a (expletive) end to this season.” Staley laughed: “Sorry for my language.” Staley, of course, isn’t alone. The disastrous season has prompted plenty of R-rated chatter, and it could soon inspire plenty of changes. Those edits could start with head coach Jim Tomsula, whose first year at the helm began under difficult circumstances given the wave of personnel losses in the offseason. And the losses kept coming once the real games began. Consider: The 49ers’ top three running backs have combined to miss 28 of 45 games, their top two tight ends — since-traded Vernon Davis and Garrett Celek — have been on the field for just 13 total games, and other key figures such as defensive tackle Glenn Dorsey and safety Antoine Bethea have been on injured reserve for more than a month. In addition, there is the matter of their most important player, quarterback Colin Kaepernick, who was demoted after eight starts. Still, all NFL teams deal with injuries and poorer-than-expected individual performances. In the 49ers’ case, it’s hard to argue that they’ve handled the in-season adversity particularly well. For his part, Staley, 31, the team’s longest-tenured member, was realistic entering 2015, but he didn’t figure on 4-11. As he’s done after each season, he will meet with general manager Trent Baalke and share his thoughts about changes he thinks need to be made. “I don't think you ever expect a season like this,” Staley said. “We knew it was going to be a challenging year. And we knew we didn’t have everybody coming back like we had in years past — the same coordinators, the same players. It was going to be a challenge, regardless. We knew that going in. But we didn’t expect the kind of year we had this year.” Many don’t expect one of those coordinators, Geep Chryst, to return given the performance of an offense averaging a league-worst 14.6 points a game. The 49ers are on pace to score their third-fewest points in a non-strike season since 1978, and they will set a franchise record for sacks allowed if they surrender four Sunday. Tomsula resisted making in-season staff changes, but it was notable that the defensive-minded head coach couldn’t resist an attempt to help the wheezing offense last month. Tomsula acknowledged that he implored the offensive staff to adopt a more aggressive approach before a 24-10 loss at Cleveland on Dec. 13. “I came in and said, ‘Look, I want to throw the ball down the field. I want to hit those middle-range throws,’” Tomsula said. “I kind of forced that, which, in retrospect, I shouldn’t have forced it. That’s the conversation I had with the offensive staff. That was me in there forcing that, ‘Look, let’s get out here, let’s hit those 14- to 19-yard throws. Let’s go after a couple of those.’” That certainly suggests that Tomsula, a defensive-line coach from 2007-14, felt Chryst needed his input, which doesn’t qualify as a ringing endorsement. Similarly, Staley declined to aggressively back Chryst when asked about the importance of staying in the same offense in 2016. “I definitely think there are advantages to being in the same system and having familiarity with it, but it’s also a results-based business,” Staley said. “And we have to do our part to make sure the results are better than what they were this year.” Eric Branch is a San Francisco Chronicle staff writer.

The 6-foot-7 Armstead (2 sacks, 18.5 hurries) has fared well as a pass-rusher, although he could use work on getting his hands up; he’s yet to deflect a pass. Injuries: 49ers — They placed LB Michael Wilhoite (ankle) on injured reserve Saturday and activated RB Mike Davis from short-term IR. G Marcus Martin (concussion) and S Jaquiski Tartt (knee) are doubtful. Rams — RB Todd Gurley (foot) is doubtful. The 49ers are 0-5 in the NFC West, which includes a 27-6 loss at St. Louis on Nov. 1. They last had a winless division record in 1978. Davis, a rookie fourth-round pick, has 24 yards on 25 carries. Since 1960, only one running back has averaged less than a yard a carry with at least 25 attempts in a season (Donnell Bennett, Chiefs, 2000). The 49ers have converted 29.1 percent of their third downs, which would be their fourth-lowest figure since 1991.

Given the question: Write a multi-choice question for the following article: Article: Nancy Tillman's wonderful On the Night You Were Born is one of my very favorite books. Its celebration of the uniqueness of each and every child told in lyrical language makes it the gift I choose most often for expectant or adoptive parents. I also read it regularly with my grandchildren and talk with them about how special they are. Tillman feels that the most important message for children to receive is simply, \\"You are loved.\\" And it's that message that is the focus of this, her newest book, Wherever You Are: My Love Will Find You. Once again, it is her turn of phrase that most fascinates me: In the green of the grass ... in the smell of the sea ... in the clouds floating by ... at the top of a tree ... in the sound crickets make at the end of the day ... \\"You are loved. You are loved. You are loved,\\" they all say. Phrases encourage children to grow, to try new things, to \\"march to the front\\" of their \\"own parade\\" and assures them that, no matter how far they go or what they do, they will be loved. Though the words alone would convince me to buy, share and recommend this book, Tillman is also a gifted artist and her lovely work makes this book a visual treasure as well. Through the pages, a child rides hippos, splashes in the surf with elephants, plays hide and seek with rabbits, shares a trampoline  with a kangaroo and enjoys some quiet time with a pair of pandas. My favorite drawing has the child walking away along a wide path that runs between trees covered in mist. In all of the drawings, swirls of sparkling lights wrap around the child--the love that will always be with him/her. I've read On the Night You Were Born dozens of times and with every single reading, I am incredibly touched. Wherever You Are: My Love Will Find You creates the same feeling of wonder, peace and happiness in me. It's a keep-forever book and I'm so happy to have it in my collection to share with the children I love most.

There were serious scientific objections to the process of natural selection as the key mechanism of evolution, including Karl von Nägeli's insistence that a trivial characteristic with no adaptive advantage could not be developed by selection. Darwin conceded that these could be linked to adaptive characteristics. His estimate that the age of the Earth allowed gradual evolution was disputed by William Thomson (later awarded the title Lord Kelvin), who calculated that it had cooled in less than 100 million years. Darwin accepted blending inheritance, but Fleeming Jenkin calculated that as it mixed traits, natural selection could not accumulate useful traits. Darwin tried to meet these objections in the 5th edition. Mivart supported directed evolution, and compiled scientific and religious objections to natural selection. In response, Darwin made considerable changes to the sixth edition. The problems of the age of the Earth and heredity were only resolved in the 20th century. Is there an answer to this question (If it cannot be answered, say \\"unanswerable\\"): What justification for his objections to the process of natural selection did Karl von Nägel give?","output":"Karl von Nägeli's justification for his objections to the process of natural selection as the key mechanism of evolution stemmed from his belief that trivial characteristics with no adaptive advantage could not be developed by selection. According to von Nägeli, these seemingly insignificant traits, which did not appear to play a role in an organism's survival or reproduction, were difficult to explain through the process of natural selection alone. Von Nägeli argued that for natural selection to work, traits must be beneficial to the organism, enabling it to survive and reproduce better than individuals without those traits. If a trait provided no apparent advantage, von Nägeli believed that there was no reason for it to be selected and passed on to future generations. This concern highlighted a potential limitation in Darwin's theory of natural selection at the time, as it could not adequately account for the development of these non-adaptive traits. To address von Nägeli's objection, Darwin conceded that these seemingly trivial characteristics could be linked to adaptive characteristics in some way. In other words, a trait that appeared to have no adaptive advantage might be connected to another trait which did provide a benefit to the organism. These connections allowed for the seemingly non-adaptive traits to be maintained and passed on through generations alongside beneficial traits due to the overall advantage obtained by the organisms possessing them. This explanation helped to address some of the concerns raised by von Nägeli and other critics of natural selection. It should be noted, however, that our modern understanding of genetics and the processes underlying inheritance and trait development have evolved significantly since Darwin's time. Today, scientists recognize that traits can be preserved through various mechanisms, such as genetic drift or developmental constraints, which may not always directly relate to an organism's adaptive success. These new insights offer a more comprehensive picture of evolution and contribute to a better understanding of why seemingly trivial traits may persist within populations."},{"instruction":"Teacher:In this task, you will be presented with a question about part-of-speech tag of a word in the question.

This is some data: 11264 Claudiomaccone, periapsis, 296521000.0 (kilometres). Generate a detailed description of this data. Sentence:","output":"The data you have provided contains three distinct elements related to astronomy, more specifically, space exploration.  The first element, '11264 Claudiomaccone,' is an identifier that refers to a specific object present in space. Named after the renowned Italian astrophysicist and space exploration advocate Dr. Claudio Maccone, '11264 Claudiomaccone' is classified as a minor planet within our solar system. This so-called minor planet was officially recognized and designated by the Minor Planet Center, an organization operating under the auspices of the International Astronomical Union. Much like asteroids, minor planets are celestial bodies that orbit the sun but are too small to qualify as planets and too large to fall under the category of meteoroids. Therefore, '11264 Claudiomaccone' is a unique celestial body whirling through our solar system named after an influential scientist in the field. The second element, 'periapsis,' is a term originating from astronomy and space navigation. This concept describes the point within the elliptical, or slightly oval-shaped, orbit of a celestial body where it is closest to its orbital focus or the object it orbits around. Every celestial body moving in an elliptical orbit has a periapsis. For instance, in the scenario where a planet or a minor planet like '11264 Claudiomaccone' orbits the sun, the periapsis would be the point at which this celestial body is nearest to the sun. One of the most common uses of this term is in relation to the Earth's orbit around the sun, which is called perihelion. Lastly, the number '296521000.0 (kilometres),' appears to be providing us with a measurement of distance, more specifically, the distance '11264 Claudiomaccone' at its periapsis. This signifies that at the closest point in its elliptical orbit to its orbital focus, '11264 Claudiomaccone' is approximately 296,521,000 kilometres away. So, this data appears to be detailing a snapshot of '11264 Claudiomaccone' space journey - at the moment when it's closest to the object it is orbiting, it is at a distance of about 296,521,000 kilometres. This gives us a glimpse into the variables that contribute towards the intricate workings of our universe and the celestial bodies within it."},{"instruction":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

We want to find the value of 'f'. We have the equation: 12 = 6*f - 2*f First, let's combine the 'f' terms. We have 6 times 'f' and we need to take away 2 times 'f'. Think of it like you have 6 toys and you give away 2 toys, you would have 4 toys left. So, the equation becomes: 12 = 4*f Now, we need to figure out how many times 'f' should be multiplied by 4 to get the number 12. Imagine you have 12 candies, and you want to split them into groups of 4. You can divide 12 candies into 3 groups of 4. So, f = 3 That's our answer! When f equals 3, our equation is true: 12 = 6*3 - 2*3."},{"instruction":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation. Think like you are answering to a five year old.

Article: Society is the term to describe human beings gathered together by social networks tand power networks. It does not refer to everything everybody thinks or does, but, only refer to those things that everybody depends upon ,for example, public services, governments, and all kinds of communities. A society must keep even the poorest and weakest members willing to help even the richest and strongest, so it is very concerned with citizenship, rights, ethics ( )and time limits. These are basic ways to achieve fairness. If they break down badly, people will think the society is unfair and start taking things from each other, refusing to help each other, or seeing those who have more as cheats. When this happens, it is time for the society to break down or fail. Theft, violence and war are things that can make a society break down. A new society may be formed out of the collapse  of an old failed one when people of different kinds reach an agreement about fairness and are willing to live together in harmony again. To adapt to the society, people should make sure that their behavior can be supported by the society, that is to say, there must be some social rules on which citizens base what they do. However, some people take risks that the society will support them when they do whatever they intend to. For instance, they may refuse to obey the law, and count on their fellow society members to free them in a court of appeal, which harms the society. Therefore we need a social contract which sets out rules for the society. One kind of the social contract is a constitution  -which allows a jury or court to decide what is right or wrong according to the social rules.

The terrifying raid happened at her plush Paris apartment this morning. Robbers pretending to be cops stole her £3.5 million engagement ring – and another £5 million worth of jewellery. “It’s the sort of crime you can do in pretty much any city in the world – you don’t need to come to France to nick Kim Kardashian’s stuff.” It is feared that the £3.5million ring could be the 20-carat second engagement ring given to her by husband Kanye West. Kim, 35, was tied up in the bathroom and had a gun held to her head as the raiders snatched her jewels. The reality star was unharmed but “shaken” and fled on a private jet after the raid. Mr Kirkham, who runs his own security consultancy, said the jewels will already be broken up and could end up in London’s Hatton Garden. He said: \\"Most jewellery is broken almost immediately. \\"The pieces tend to be recognisable so they will be broken up unless there is a particular buyer. \\"If it gets sold through Belgium or Amsterdam it could come into London. \\"Hatton Garden is an international market so it's definitely an option.\\" Mr Kirkham believes the robbers were local, adding: \\"It's impossible to say but my guess would a French gang. There are probably organised crime gangs in Paris that are capable. \\"It's not that big. It's not that high-end that I'd expect people to travel internationally to do it. \\"It's a good robbery but it's not a speed-boat-getaway sort of thing.\\" Kim's husband Kanye West raced off stage after leaning of the of incident in the middle of a performance at The Meadows Music and Arts Festival in New York. He has no doubt that the robbery was planned instead of carried out by opportunists. He said: \\"It was definitely planned. I suspect it's an experienced gang who have worked together before. \\"I suspect they knew what they were going to get.\\" And he added the crime should act as a stark warning about the dangers of over-sharing on social media. He said: \\"It might not have been headline news where Kim was staying but I suspect it was anything but a secret. \\"The robbers probably found out via social media. Information is not that difficult to find out. \\"It's a warning to anybody, not just celebrities.\\" A photographer who posed as a policeman to spy on Kim Kardashian in a restaurant earlier this week is being questioned by police. Sisters Kourtney and Kendall were saying at the nearby Peninsula Hotel. Hours before all three sisters attended an after-party following Kendall's appearance in the Givenchy fashion show.

Given a task, you explain in simple steps what the task is asking, any guidelines it provides and how to use those guidelines to find the answer. Detailed Instructions: In this task, you are given inputs 'i', 'j', and A, where 'i' and 'j' are integers and A is a list. A list is shown by two brackets and comma-separated numbers and characters inside, like ['1', '12', 'l']. You need to concatenate all elements of A from the ith element to the jth element, and then reverse the resulting string. 'i' and 'j' will be non-negative, and will always have a value less than the length of A. 'i' will always be less than 'j'. Perform the operations in order, i.e., do not reverse first and then concatenate. Problem:2, 2, ['X', 'H', '7559', '7293', '517', 'p', 'z', '5407', '9759', '9167', 'H', '7909', '5005'] Solution:","output":"To solve this task, follow these simple steps: 1. Understand the task: The task asks you to concatenate all the elements of the list A from the ith element to the jth element, and then reverse the resulting string. The inputs are i, j, and A. In this case, i = 2, j = 2, and A = ['X', 'H', '7559', '7293', '517', 'p', 'z', '5407', '9759', '9167', 'H', '7909', '5005']. 2. Remember the guidelines: i and j are non-negative integers, and they will always have values less than the length of A. Also, i will always be less than j. 3. Perform the operations in order, as instructed: First, we need to concatenate all elements of A from the ith element to the jth element. In our case, i=2 and j=2. Since indices start at 0, the ith element is the 3rd element of A which is '7559', and the jth element is the 3rd element of A which is '7559' as well. 4. Concatenate the elements: Since we only have one element in this range, our concatenated string will be '7559'. 5. Reverse the resulting string: The final step is to reverse the concatenated string. The reverse of '7559' is '9557'. So the solution to this problem is '9557'."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant that follows instruction extremely well. Help as much as you can.

(Lo Sai Hung/AP) Like a shot of adrenalin, Hong Kong quickens the pulse. Skyscrapers march up jungle-clad slopes by day and blaze neon by night, across a harbour criss-crossed by freighters and motor junks. Hong Kong can overwhelm but offers fantastic experiences, especially to visitors who are willing to step out of their comfort zone. See The Peak Tram rises above skyscrapers, departing from the lower terminus and climbing to the 552-metre Victoria Peak. On clear days and at night, the view from the top is amazing (7am-midnight, every 15 minutes; £3). The largest of Hong Kong’s Man Mo temples was the hub of civil life on the island in the 19th century. The Taoist temple was built in 1847 by Chinese merchants and was dedicated to the gods of literature, ‘man’, and of war, ‘mo’ (24-126 Hollywood Rd, Sheung Wan; 8am-6pm; free). Hong Kong’s first heritage trail, the Ping Shan, includes the territory’s oldest pagoda, a magnificent ancestral hall and temples. All were built by the Tang clan, the most powerful of the five clans that settled in the New Territories around the 11th century (West Rail Tin Shui Wai station, exit E; 10am-1pm and 2pm-5pm; free). Temple Street Night Market is Hong Kong’s liveliest. Aside from the clothes, watches and footwear on offer, it’s worth a visit for the smells and tastes of the open-air street stall and for the occasional Cantonese opera shows. Night owls should try the fruit market, open from midnight until dawn (Man Ming Lane; 6pm-midnight). Picturesque Tai O, on Lantau island, is one of the oldest fishing villages. It is famous for its stilt houses, rope-tow ferry and temple dedicated to the god of war, Guan Yu. Reach it by bus 1 from the Mui Wo ferry point. Eat and drink Dah Wing Wah is the place to go for the village cuisine of the northern New Territories. Local ingredients are sourced from small farms and food producers. Try the lemon-steamed mullet and smoked oysters (00 852 2476 9888; 2nd fl, Koon Wong Mansion, 2-6 On Ning Rd, Yuen Long; lunch and dinner; mains from £3). Tung Po Seafood Restaurant has revolutionised hawkerstyle cooking. Its novel menu has featured items such as steamed glutinous rice with duck jus. Beer is served in big rice bowls, to be downed bandit style. Book ahead or go before 7pm (00 852 2880 9399; 2nd fl, Municipal Services Bldg, 99 Java Rd, North Point; lunch and dinner; meals from £6). Famous tea house Luk Yu is known for its dim sum (available from 7am-5pm) and Cantonese dishes. The delectable food and elegant furnishings make up for the cavalier service (00 852 2523 5464; 24-26 Stanley St, Central; lunch and dinner; mains from £8). Ye Shanghai means ‘Shanghai nights’ and its interior is romantic. The Shanghainese food, lighter than traditional Cantonese dishes, is Michelin-starred (00 852 2376 3322; 6th fl, Marco Polo Hotel, Harbour City, Kowloon; lunch and dinner; mains from £12). The atmosphere at T’ang Court is plush, the service impeccable and the food divine. Try sautéed prawns with deep-fried taro puffs (00 852 2375 1133; Langham Hotel, 8 Peking Rd, Tsim Sha Tsui; lunch and dinner; mains from £30). Sleep Hop Inn has a youthful vibe and nine small but artful rooms, each featuring illustrations by a Hong Kong artist. Three rooms have no windows, but the art on the walls makes this seem like less of a problem (00 852 2881 7331; Flat A, 2nd fl, Hanyee Bldg, 19-21 Hankow Rd, Tsim Sha Tsui; from £40). Given its location in the Central Business District, Ice House is excellent value. It’s styled in contemporary fashion with lots of white and colourful, contrasting bedspreads and accessories. Each room has a kitchenette and a work area (00 852 2836 7333; 38 Ice House St, Central; from £80). Many of the handsomely proportioned rooms at the Hyatt Regency Hong Kong, Tsim Sha Tsui feature harbour views. They are modern, with bamboo flooring, king-size beds and large picture windows. The black-and-white photographs of Tsim Sha Tsui are a stylish touch (00 852 2311 1234; 18 Hanoi Rd, Tsim Sha Tsui; from £155). Summary:","output":"This mini guide to Hong Kong offers a glimpse of the top sights, cuisine, and accommodations for tourists.

Il faut aussi qu'elle rappelle que l'UE doit mener des politiques qui assurent que les mesures visant à répondre aux préoccupations environnementales prennent également en considération l'intérêt des habitants de la région arctique, y compris celui des populations autochtones, à protéger et développer la région. Translate to English","output":"It is also necessary to recall that the EU must implement policies that ensure that measures aimed at addressing environmental concerns also take into consideration the interests of the inhabitants of the Arctic region, including those of indigenous populations, in protecting and developing the region. Translation: We must also remember that the European Union (EU) has the responsibility to implement policies that make sure that any actions taken with the goal of resolving environmental concerns also consider the interests of those living in the Arctic region. This includes considering the interests of indigenous populations who wish to protect and develop the region. The Arctic region is home to diverse ecosystems, abundant wildlife, and unique cultures. However, the region is facing serious challenges caused by climate change, such as melting sea ice, rising sea levels, and loss of biodiversity. These challenges not only have a direct impact on the local environment and communities but also global implications, such as changing weather patterns and increased carbon emissions due to the melting permafrost. To address these environmental concerns, the European Union must develop and implement effective policies that can help protect and preserve the Arctic environment while promoting sustainable development. These policies should be based on comprehensive scientific research and close collaboration with Arctic stakeholders, including governments, organizations, and local communities. Moreover, the EU's policies should also take into account the interests of the Arctic inhabitants, particularly indigenous populations. Indigenous people have lived in harmony with the Arctic environment for thousands of years, and their knowledge, culture, and traditions are closely connected to the region's ecosystems. These communities have the right to maintain their way of life and participate in the decision-making processes that affect their environment and future. Therefore, the EU should focus on the following aspects while addressing the environmental concerns in the Arctic region: 1. Encouraging and supporting scientific research in the region to better understand the changing dynamics of the Arctic ecosystems and their global implications. 2. Promoting dialogue and cooperation among Arctic stakeholders, including governments, organizations, and local communities, to develop effective and sustainable policies that can help mitigate the impacts of climate change on the region's environment and inhabitants. 3. Ensuring that indigenous communities are meaningfully included in policy development and decision-making processes related to the Arctic environment and its future. This could involve supporting capacity-building initiatives for indigenous organizations, engaging in consultations with indigenous leaders, and acknowledging the value of traditional knowledge in shaping policies. 4. Adopting a precautionary approach in the development and implementation of policies and projects in the Arctic region. This means taking into consideration the potential long-term impacts of any planned actions on the environment, ecosystems, and local communities. 5. Promoting the sustainable development of the Arctic region by investing in clean energy sources, sustainable infrastructure, and resource-efficient technologies that can reduce the environmental footprint while fostering economic growth and social development. In conclusion, addressing environmental concerns in the Arctic region is a complex and challenging task, requiring the European Union to develop and implement comprehensive policies that consider not only the preservation of the environment but also the interests of the inhabitants, including indigenous populations. By promoting collaboration, research, and sustainable development, the EU can play a significant role in protecting and developing the Arctic region while respecting the interests and rights of its inhabitants."},{"instruction":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

The Sleaford area has been inhabited since the late Iron Age; people settled around the ford where a prehistoric track running northwards from Bourne crossed the River Slea. A large hoard of coin moulds belonging to the Corieltauvi tribe have been uncovered in this area and dated to the late Iron Age. It was occupied by the Romans, and then by the Anglo-Saxons. The place-name Slioford first appears in 852, meaning \\"crossing over a muddy stream\\", in reference to the Slea. The settlement around the crossing came to be known as \\"Old\\" Sleaford in 13th-century sources to distinguish it from developments further west, around the present-day market place, which came to be known as \\"New\\" Sleaford. The origins of New Sleaford are not clear, leading to a theory that it was planted by the Bishop of Lincoln in the 12th century as a means of increasing his income, hence the epithet \\"New\\". The town's compass-point layout, the 12th-century date of St Denys' stonework and other topographical features offer evidence for this theory.A speculative reassessment of Domesday Book (1086) material suggests that St Denys' origins may be earlier. Two manors called Eslaforde (Sleaford) were recorded in the Domesday Book, one held by Remigius, Bishop of Lincoln, the other by Ramsey Abbey. The Bishop succeeded a Saxon thegn, Bardi, and held 11 carucates with 29 villeins, 11 bordars, 6 sokemen, a church and priest, as well as 8 mills, 1 acre of woodland, 320 acres (130 ha) of meadow and 330 acres (130 ha) of marsh. Ramsey Abbey had been granted land in Sleaford and surrounding villages before the Norman Conquest of England; in Domesday its fee consisted of 1 carucate, 1 sokeman, 2 villeins and 27 acres of meadow. It was sokeland of the abbot of Ramsey's manor of Quarrington, where he held two churches. There is no evidence for a second church at Quarrington, which suggests that the record is alluding to one in another of the abbot's manors for which Quarrington was an estate centre.

Mr Marshall said: \\"It's highly unusual to have these incidents in such a short space of time, they're not connected to each other and sometimes in policing this happens, events happen over a short space of time. \\"To put it into context, in my first full year as chief constable we dealt with 18 murders in Hampshire and the Isle of Wight.

Article:","output":"Title: Antonio Conte Looks to Bolster Chelsea's Title Challenge in January Transfer Window Introduction: As the January transfer window approaches, Chelsea boss Antonio Conte has signaled his intention to strengthen his side in a bid to boost the Blues' Premier League title challenge. With competition for the championship heating up, Conte is looking to make significant additions to his squad to keep the team competitive. 1. The Premier League title challenge this season: Chelsea has been performing impressively in the Premier League this season. However, the competition for the title is getting intense, with clubs like Manchester City, Liverpool, and Tottenham posing a significant threat. The pressure is on Conte to secure valuable points that would keep blues' hopes for the title alive. 2. Areas that need strengthening in the team: To maintain their title hopes, Antonio Conte may look to improve his squad strategically. Key areas that could be enhanced include the midfield, attack, and defense. Boosting these areas with quality signings could provide Chelsea with the edge they need to give their rivals a worthy challenge. 3. Potential targets in the January transfer window: While the manager has not shared any specific names, it is expected that he will pursue top talent to bolster the team's performance. According to some reports, targets could include players such as Bayern Munich's Kingsley Coman, Inter Milan's Marcelo Brozovic, and Tottenham's Harry Kane. Chelsea's scouting department will be working tirelessly to identify and recommend the best talents available in the market. 4. Importance of timing in the transfer window: Antonio Conte will need to act quickly during the January transfer window. Securing quality players early on would not only increase Chelsea's chances of success, but also potentially serve as a statement of intent to their rivals. The faster the club acts, the better chances they have of landing their preferred targets. 5. Balancing the squad and ensuring chemistry: With limited time remaining in the season, it is essential for Conte to strike the right balance within the team. Introducing new players seamlessly into the squad and maintaining chemistry will be an ongoing challenge for the Italian manager. By integrating fresh talents successfully, Chelsea could come away stronger and more cohesive. Conclusion: The January transfer window holds significant potential for Chelsea to strengthen their Premier League title challenge. By identifying and securing quality players in key areas, Antonio Conte could steer his side closer to championship glory. With fierce competition in the title race, the moves made in the upcoming window could make all the difference for the Blues."},{"instruction":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

Perturbation hypothesis: suppose the bones are put underground more quickly happens, how will it affect MORE fossils forming.  Does the supposed perturbation have an effect (direct or indirect) on the process? The answer is:","output":"Yes, the supposed perturbation has a direct effect on the process. If the bones are put underground more quickly, it can lead to the formation of more fossils. This is because the faster burial of the bones protects them from being scattered or destroyed by scavengers, wind, and rain. It also allows the bones to be buried deeper, promoting the replacement of proteins with minerals more effectively.

Please answer the following question: I showed up at the address on Columbine's invitation just before eleven; it was a converted warehouse in an industrial zone on the city's north side. Since it was a Saturday night, everything else was empty for miles. The parking lot was filled with sports cars, hybrids, and shiny suburban tanks. The door facing the parking lot was open, spilling out muted lights and the din of yuppie chatter. It cast a somewhat foreboding aura over the entrance. The first thing I noticed as I approached was the beefy refrigerator in a rented tux blocking the doorway. The second thing was the surveillance camera perched on the wall above his head. I had stopped home and changed first, so I was sure I was dressed mostly appropriately for some rich faux-hipster art party - charcoal gray pinstripe jacket over a TV on the Radio t-shirt, skinny cuffed jeans, Docs, and a black fedora. I certainly didn't look any worse than the other idiots I saw filing in and out of the door. I even had an invitation. So I was fairly confident I'd be able to gain admission to this thing without incident. \\"No, absolutely not,\\" the doorman said, pressing a meaty palm into my chest. \\"I was invited!\\" I said, exasperated. \\"I have documentation.\\" I waved the rave card in front of his face. \\"No dice.\\" I stepped aside to let a couple of aging goths through the door and wondered for a moment if the doorman somehow knew who I was. Then I noticed the ear piece he was wearing and my eyes darted back to the surveillance camera. \\"Motherfucker,\\" I spat and raised both arms to flip off the camera. I didn't know it at the time, but at that moment Dylan Maxwell was sitting in front of a wall of monitors, laughing his ass off. Question: What band's t-shirt is the narrator wearing?

This information allows us to infer his age and the generation he belongs to. As of now (2021), he would be 32 years old. 2. Nationality: He is a German footballer, which indicates that he has either been born and raised in Germany or has chosen to represent Germany in international football competitions. 3. Playing Position: Felix Dausend plays as a striker in football. Strikers are usually responsible for scoring goals and are typically the most forward players in their team's formation. This reveals that he is likely a skillful and agile player with a talent for scoring or assisting in goals. 4. Current Club: He plays for Borussia Neunkirchen. This provides insight into his current profession, as well as the country and league in which he plays. Borussia Neunkirchen is a football club based in Neunkirchen, Saarland, Germany, which currently competes in the Saarlandliga, a sixth-tier German football league. This detail suggests that he is not playing at the top-level professional football leagues in Germany (such as the Bundesliga) but is instead participating in lower-tier regional competitions. 5. Career progression: While the bio does not specifically mention when Felix Dausend started his professional football career, we can infer that he has gained enough experience and competence to play for a club like Borussia Neunkirchen. The absence of additional details about his past clubs or achievements does not allow us to determine his career path prior to joining Borussia Neunkirchen. In summary, the bio provides some essential information about Felix Dausend, including his date of birth, nationality, playing position, and current club.

A:","output":"No, the given statement, \\"It is a record in digital format that is theoretically capable of being shared across different health care settings.\\" is not a reasonable answer to the question: \\"What percent of providers have electronic health records?\\"  The statement provided simply defines what electronic health records are, but does not address the percentage of providers who actually use them.  To answer the question properly, we would need to gather statistical data on the use of electronic health records among healthcare providers. Here's a possible response based on available data: According to the Office of the National Coordinator for Health Information Technology (ONC), as of 2017, approximately 86% of office-based physicians have adopted an electronic health record (EHR) system in the United States. It is important to note that these statistics may vary depending on the source and the specific criteria used to define EHR adoption. Furthermore, hospital adoption of EHR systems has increased significantly over the past decade. As of 2017, 96% of non-federal acute care hospitals were using EHRs, according to the ONC. Globally, EHR adoption rates may vary depending on factors such as the availability of financial and technical resources, government policy, and the existing healthcare infrastructure in a particular country or region. In summary, although \\"It is a record in digital format that is theoretically capable of being shared across different health care settings.\\" accurately describes electronic health records, it does not adequately answer the question about the percentage of providers using such systems.

Tonight, 9 o'clock, CBS. 1 STAR Everything you need to know about tonight's CBS telemovie, \\"Crime in Connecticut: The Story of Alex Kelly\\" (at 9), occurs during the closing credits, after the dismally dull docudrama itself is all but over. First there's a brief return appearance by Cassidy Rae, who, in this dramatization of a well-known 1986 Connecticut criminal case, stars as a 16-year-old who accuses her preppy teen neighbor of rape, then spends the next decade pursuing justice after he skips bail and flees the country before the trial. Rae appears at the very end, out of character, to deliver a national public-service announcement offering a toll-free number for victims of sex crimes to seek confidential aid. Those few seconds of airtime are more instructive, and certainly more justifiable, than the two hours preceding it. Then, at the end of the closing credits, comes the copyright date noting when this particular Canadian-made telemovie was completed. That means CBS has kept this film on the shelf for more than a year and, when finally scheduling it, threw it onto its prime-time schedule on a slow night, midway through a slow TV month, with equally little promotion and conviction. If that doesn't send out signal flares that \\"Crime in Connecticut\\" is a waste of time, I don't know what does. Rather than rely purely on deduction, however, I watched this telemovie, and can say with authority that the advance warning signs were right. The Kelly family tried, and failed, to stop CBS from showing this dramatization which makes sense, because from the very first frame, and certainly including the rape scene, writer Graham Flashner and director Ted Kotcheff adhere loyally to the victim's side of the story. \\"You're gonna make love to me, or I'll kill you,\\" Matthew Settle as Kelly growls at Rae's Carrie Roberts, and his younger neighbor fearfully complies. \\"Crime in Connecticut\\" spends nearly an hour explaining how the title character fled the country. After that, it's a slow march to justice, with the boy's mother, played by Margot Kidder, blindly supportive most of the way. (Kelly was convicted of rape in 1997 and given a 16-year prison term.) The events recounted in this telemovie are dramatic, but the way they're acted, written and directed is not. Even the trial scenes are edited and performed wearily, and not even Kidder manages to break through the sheen of boredom. What is a short summary of the above article?","output":"The article is a critical review of the CBS telemovie \\"Crime in Connecticut: The Story of Alex Kelly,\\" which premiered on March 16th, 1999.

Movie title: Alien vs. Hunter Movie plot: A journalist named Lee Custler (William Katt) is out jogging when a flying object passes behind him and crashes. Sheriff Joel Armstrong (Collin Brock) picks him up and they go to check it out. They find an abandoned caravan close to where the object crashed. As they discover the object and realize it is a spaceship, an Alien emerges. The Alien then chases them, after which Lee flees to the car. However Armstrong makes a stand, trips, falls and is killed by the Alien that then leaves. A terrified Tammy finds Lee and they call the local authorities but their car is destroyed by the Alien. They run to a local cafÃ© where they meet Hilary, Javier, Figgus and Marcy who do not believe them. Together they go back where they find Garrison wounded and the other passenger gone. Garrison says that everyone else died. The Alien then appears and kills Marcy, and while the others flee it fights a cyborg-like Hunter. The group decides to go to Valentines, the local hunter, through the sewers. All except Javier, who is killed by the Alien, make it to Valentine's and his daughter Freckle's house where they call for the support of a local paramilitary team. Valentine attempts to kill the Hunter, only to be nearly killed instead, but he makes it alive. The group then splits up: Valentine and Lee go to meet the paramilitary force while Tammy, Hillary, Freckles, Garrison and Figgus try to escape through a set of tunnels. Garrison gets lost in the tunnels and killed by the Alien but the others make it to the hunterâs ship to their dismay. There they find a second Alien that's nearly dead and figure out that to get rid of the Hunter they need to kill the Alien and take a ray gun from the ship. Lee and Valentine find Two Fingers, Marty and Styles, the paramilitary force, and go to find T and Lexin who are in the woods. But they are already dead and the Hunter kills Marty, and kicks Styles away flying right near the Alien who kills both him and Valentine, who tries to save him. The few survivors meet and while they try to think of... A:","output":"In the movie \\"Alien vs. Hunter,\\" Sheriff Joel Armstrong and Lee Custler realize that the crashed object is actually a spaceship. This discovery leads to a series of terrifying events, as an alien creature emerges from the spaceship and begins to attack the people in the area. As the story unfolds, an additional threat is introduced in the form of a cyborg-like Hunter, who is engaged in a violent conflict with the Alien. The remaining human characters must then navigate the dangerous situation, forming alliances and using their wits to survive the deadly creatures that have invaded their town. Throughout the course of the film, the characters face numerous challenges and losses, both in terms of personal safety and the lives of their friends and loved ones. In an effort to end the threat posed by the Alien and the Hunter, they devise a plan to kill the Alien, as they have deduced that the Hunter will only leave once its mission is complete. Gaining access to the Hunter's ship, the group manages to acquire a ray gun, which they intend to use in their battle against the Alien. Meanwhile, Lee and Valentine join forces with a local paramilitary force to confront the Hunter and any remaining Aliens in the area. As the film reaches its climax, each of the remaining characters must face the deadly creatures in a final, bloody showdown. During the course of these confrontations, several members of the group are killed, but the survivors ultimately prevail by successfully eliminating the Alien threat and, as a result, forcing the Hunter to leave the town. While the town and its survivors are left to mourn their losses and attempt to rebuild their shattered lives, the overall message of the movie underscores the resilience and courage of the human spirit when confronted with unknown and deadly adversaries. In summary, Sheriff Joel Armstrong and Lee Custler, along with other characters in the film, discover that the crashed object that began the terrifying chain of events is a spaceship carrying an alien creature and its powerful, cyborg-like Hunter adversary. The main conflict of the movie revolves around the struggle between the humans caught in this deadly scenario and their attempts to survive and overcome these otherworldly threats. The ultimate resolution is achieved when the remaining characters manage to eliminate the Alien, thereby forcing the Hunter to withdraw and leave the town in relative peace."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

What is the final step of the following process: -  Food enters the body - Food begins to be processed by the digestive system - The pancreas releases enzymes to aid digestion - Digested food affects the amount of sugar in the blood - The pancreas releases one hormone to lower the blood sugar (glucose) level The answer to this question is:","output":"The final step of the process is: The pancreas releases another hormone, called glucagon, to raise the blood sugar level when it gets too low.  Rationale: The entire process revolves around maintaining blood sugar levels in the body. The pancreas plays a crucial role in releasing hormones to regulate these levels. It has already released insulin to lower the blood sugar level, but to ensure the balance is maintained, the pancreas releases glucagon when the blood sugar level gets too low.

Input: CONTEXT: 1 de enero de 2017 Tres personas vestidas de Papá Noel entraron esta noche en una discoteca famosa de Estambul y abrieron fuego contra los clientes, causando al menos 35 muertos y 40 heridos. El ataque tuvo lugar en el club Reina, situado en la orilla del Bósforo, un conocido lugar de ocio de la sociedad de Estambul. El gobernador de Estambul, Vasip Sahin, declaró a la prensa que el ataque ha dejado 35 muertos y 40 heridos, informó la cadena NTV. Los atacantes abrieron fuego con armas automáticas de manera indiscriminada desde la puerta del local, matando al policía de guardia, y luego entraron en el local, en el que se hallaban unas 800 personas celebrando la Nochevieja. Los testigos del ataque aseguraron que los atacantes gritaban consignas en árabe. La policía ha desplazado numerosos agentes al lugar para registrar el local, además de numerosas ambulancias, y se realizan esfuerzos para salvar a numerosos clientes del club que se le lanzaron al Bósforo presas del pánico. La televisión turca ha publicado imágenes que muestran los vehículos blindados de la policía estacionados frente al lugar de los hechos, a donde también se han enviado ambulancias para asistir a los lesionados. Por el momento se desconoce las causas del ataque, del que nadie se ha responsabilizado. Turquía en los últimos meses ha sido blanco de una serie de atentados terroristas reivindicados tanto por el grupo terrorista EIIL (Daesh, en árabe) como por las guerrillas kurdas secesionistas, como el Partido de los Trabajadores del Kurdistán (PKK, en kurdo).

You will be given a task. You must generate a detailed and long answer. Please answer the following question: Information:  - Inflammation (from Latin \\"inflammatio\\") is part of the complex biological response of body tissues to harmful stimuli, such as pathogens, damaged cells, or irritants, and is a protective response involving immune cells, blood vessels, and molecular mediators. The function of inflammation is to eliminate the initial cause of cell injury, clear out necrotic cells and tissues damaged from the original insult and the inflammatory process, and to initiate tissue repair.  - Eicosapentaenoic acid (EPA; also icosapentaenoic acid) is an omega-3 fatty acid. In physiological literature, it is given the name 20:5(n-3). It also has the trivial name timnodonic acid. In chemical structure, EPA is a carboxylic acid with a 20-carbon chain and five \\"cis\\" double bonds; the first double bond is located at the third carbon from the omega end.  - The blood vessels are the part of the circulatory system that transports blood throughout the human body. There are three major types of blood vessels: the arteries, which carry the blood away from the heart; the capillaries, which enable the actual exchange of water and chemicals between the blood and the tissues; and the veins, which carry blood from the capillaries back toward the heart. The word \\"vascular\\", meaning relating to the blood vessels, is derived from the Latin \\"vas\\", meaning vessel. A few structures (such as cartilage and the lens of the eye) do not contain blood vessels and are labeled.  - Eicosanoids are signaling molecules made by the enzymatic or non-enzymatic oxidation of arachidonic acid or other polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFAs) that are, like arachidonic acid, 20 carbon units in length. They are a sub-category of oxylipins, i.e. oxidized fatty acids of diverse carbon units in length but are further distinguished from other oxylipins by their overwhelming importance as cell signaling molecules. Eicosanoids function in diverse physiological and pathological systems including those: mounting or inhibiting inflammation, allergy, fever and other immune responses; influencing the abortion of pregnancy and normal childbirth; contributing to the perception of pain; regulating cell growth; controlling blood pressure; and modulating the regional flow of blood to tissues. In performing these tasks, eicosanoids most often act as autocrine signaling agents to impact their cells of origin or as paracrine signaling agents to impact cells near to their cells of origin. However, they can also act as endocrine agents to control the function of distant cells.  - Enzymes are macromolecular biological catalysts. Enzymes accelerate, or catalyze, chemical reactions. The molecules at the beginning of the process upon which enzymes may act are called substrates and the enzyme converts these into different molecules, called products. Almost all metabolic processes in the cell need enzymes in order to occur at rates fast enough to sustain life. The set of enzymes made in a cell determines which metabolic pathways occur in that cell. The study of enzymes is called \\"enzymology\\".  - Arachidonate 5-lipoxygenase, also known as ALOX5, 5-lipoxygenase, 5-LOX, or 5-LO, is a non-heme iron-containing enzyme (EC 1.13.11.34) that in humans is encoded by the \\"ALOX5\\" gene. Arachidonate 5-lipoxygenase is a member of the lipoxygenase family of enzymes. It transforms EFA substrates into leukotrienes as well as a wide range of other biologically active products. ALOX5 is a current target for pharmaceutical intervention in a number of diseases.  - Leukotriene B4 is a leukotriene involved in inflammation . It is produced from leukocytes in response to inflammatory mediators and is able to induce the adhesion and activation of leukocytes on the endothelium , allowing them to bind to and cross it into the tissue . In neutrophils , it is also a potent chemoattractant , and is able to induce the formation of reactive oxygen species and the release of lysosomal enzymes by these cells . It is synthesized by leukotriene - A4 hydrolase from leukotriene A4 .  - Essential fatty acids, or EFAs, are fatty acids that humans and other animals must ingest because the body requires them for good health but cannot synthesize them.  - Latin (Latin: ) is a classical language belonging to the Italic branch of the Indo-European languages. The Latin alphabet is derived from the Etruscan and Greek alphabets.  - Leukotrienes are a family of eicosanoid inflammatory mediators produced in leukocytes by the oxidation of arachidonic acid (AA) and the essential fatty acid eicosapentaenoic acid (EPA) by the enzyme arachidonate 5-lipoxygenase.  - Arachidonic acid (AA, sometimes ARA) is a polyunsaturated omega-6 fatty acid 20:4(-6). It is structurally related to the saturated arachidic acid found in Cupuaçu butter (\\"L. arachis\\"  peanut).    Given the information above, choose from the list below the object entity that exhibits the relation 'has part' with the subject 'leukotriene b4'.  Choices: - a  - blood  - carbon  - cause  - cell  - family  - function  - human  - iron  - l  - language  - length  - lo  - member  - must  - n  - omega  - part  - peanut  - water  - word  - ω A:","output":"Leukotriene B4, an inflammatory agent, has a strong relationship with the 'cell' entity from the given list. This is because leukotriene B4 is produced by leukocytes (a type of white blood cell) in response to inflammatory mediators. It is involved in the adhesion and activation of leukocytes on the endothelium, allowing them to bind to and cross it into the tissue. In neutrophils, leukotriene B4 is a potent chemoattractant and can induce the formation of reactive oxygen species and the release of lysosomal enzymes by these cells."},{"instruction":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

Question: What is the name of dynasty after Qin? Context: China's first imperial dynasty was the Qin dynasty (221–206 BC). The Qin unified the Chinese Warring States by conquest, but their empire became unstable after the death of the first emperor Qin Shi Huangdi. Within four years, the dynasty's authority had collapsed in the face of rebellion. Two former rebel leaders, Xiang Yu (d. 202 BC) of Chu and Liu Bang (d. 195 BC) of Han, engaged in a war to decide who would become hegemon of China, which had fissured into 18 kingdoms, each claiming allegiance to either Xiang Yu or Liu Bang. Although Xiang Yu proved to be a capable commander, Liu Bang defeated him at Battle of Gaixia (202 BC), in modern-day Anhui. Liu Bang assumed the title \\"emperor\\" (huangdi) at the urging of his followers and is known posthumously as Emperor Gaozu (r. 202–195 BC). Chang'an was chosen as the new capital of the reunified empire under Han.","output":"The name of the dynasty after the Qin dynasty is the Han dynasty."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

This 1984 version of the Dickens' classic \`A Christmas Carol,' directed by Clive Donner, stars George C. Scott as Ebenezer Scrooge. By this time around, the challenge for the filmmaker was to take such familiar material and make it seem fresh and new again; and, happily to say, with this film Donner not only met the challenge but surpassed any expectations anyone might have had for it. He tells the story with precision and an eye to detail, and extracts performances from his actors that are nothing less than superlative, especially Scott. One could argue that the definitive portrayal of Scrooge-- one of the best known characters in literary fiction, ever-- was created by Alastair Sim in the 1951 film; but I think with his performance here, Scott has now achieved that distinction. There is such a purity and honesty in his Scrooge that it becomes difficult to even consider anyone else in the role once you've seen Scott do it; simply put, he IS Scrooge. And what a tribute it is to such a gifted actor; to be able to take such a well known figure and make it so uniquely his own is quite miraculous. It is truly a joy to see an actor ply his trade so well, to be able to make a character so real, from every word he utters down to the finest expression of his face, and to make it all ring so true. It's a study in perfection. The other members of the cast are splendid as well, but then again they have to be in order to maintain the integrity of Scott's performance; and they do. Frank Finlay is the Ghost of Jacob Marley; a notable turn, though not as memorable, perhaps, as the one by Alec Guinness (as Marley) in the film, \`Scrooge.' Angela Pleasence is a welcome visage as the Spirit of Christmas Past; Edward Woodward, grand and boisterous, and altogether convincing as the Spirit of Christmas Present; and Michael Carter, grim and menacing as the Spirit of Christmas Yet To Come. David Warner hits just the right mark with his Bob Cratchit, bringing a sincerity to the role that measures up well to the standard of quality set by Scott's Scrooge, and Susannah York fares just as well as Mrs. Cratchit. The real gem to be found here, though, is the performance of young Anthony Walters as Tiny Tim; it's heartfelt without ever becoming maudlin, and simply one of the best interpretations-- and the most real-- ever presented on film. The excellent supporting cast includes Roger Rees (Fred Holywell, and also the narrator of the film), Caroline Langrishe (Janet Holywell), Lucy Gutteridge (Belle), Michael Gough (Mr. Poole) and Joanne Whalley (Fan). A flawless presentation, this version of \`A Christmas Carol' sets the standard against which all others must be gauged; no matter how many versions you may have seen, watching this one is like seeing it for the first time ever. And forever after, whenever you think of Scrooge, the image your mind will conjure up will be that of George C. Scott. A thoroughly entertaining and satisfying experience, this film demands a place in the annual schedule of the holiday festivities of every home. I rate this one 10/10. How would you describe the sentiment of this review?","output":"The sentiment of this review is highly positive and praiseful. The reviewer expresses great admiration for the 1984 version of \\"A Christmas Carol,\\" especially for the performances of the actors, particularly George C. Scott as Ebenezer Scrooge. The reviewer also appreciates the director's ability to make the familiar material feel fresh and new, and considers this adaptation a benchmark for all others.

Captured Moments by Will Shetterly I remember Papa's stopbox, a teal blue Tiempo Capturado that Mama brought home for his birthday. It was huge and inefficient, and she should never have spent so many pesos on a toy, but Papa would not let her return it. He used it to preserve baby tomatoes, cucumbers, and strawberries in translucent cubes that he stored in the pantry for spring-time meals in the middle of winter. Mama kept her mink jacket, a family hand-me-down, safe from time in a stopbox, and lent the capturador to my uncle for his stamp collection. Sometimes they would let us little ones to seal a treasured toy or a last piece of birthday cake until we begged them for its release, usually a few hours after enclosing it. When my father died, a year after my mother, my sisters and I cleaned out their apartment. We found our baby shoes protected in stopboxes.

Movie title: The Right Stuff Movie plot: In 1947, the Muroc Army Air Field in California has test pilots fly high-speed aircraft such as the rocket-powered Bell X-1, but they die as a result. After another pilot, Slick Goodlin, demands 150,000 to attempt to break the sound barrier, war hero Captain Chuck Yeager receives the chance to fly the X-1. While on a horseback ride with his wife Glennis, Yeager collides with a tree branch and breaks his ribs, which inhibits him from leaning over and locking the door to the X-1. Worried that he might not fly the mission, Yeager confides in friend and fellow pilot Jack Ridley. Ridley cuts off part of a broomstick and tells Yeager to use it as a lever to help seal the hatch to the X-1, and Yeager becomes the first person to fly at supersonic speed, defeating the \\"demon in the sky\\". Six years later, Muroc, now Edwards Air Force Base, still attracts the best test pilots. Yeager (now a major) and friendly rival Scott Crossfield repeatedly break the other's speed records. They often visit the Happy Bottom Riding Club run by Pancho Barnes, who classifies the pilots at Edwards as either \\"prime\\" (such as Yeager and Crossfield) that fly the best equipment or newer \\"pudknockers\\" who only dream about it.

But good luck telling that to President Donald Trump or a dozen or so Democrats contemplating a White House bid two years from now. Trump has already been out on the campaign trail testing themes for his expected re-election bid. \\"Our new slogan for 2020. Do you know what it is? Keep America great!\\" Trump told cheering supporters at a recent rally in Elkhart, Indiana. But Trump also made it clear he is concerned about this year's congressional midterm elections, in which opposition Democrats are favored to make gains.  \\"And all of the great momentum that we are having as a country on jobs, on safety, on security, on our military — it is all at stake in November,\\" Trump warned at the Indiana rally.  2020 is expected to produce a bumper crop of Democratic presidential contenders who will vie for their party's nomination. Those in the group range from the well-known like former Vice President Joe Biden and 2016 contender Senator Bernie Sanders of Vermont to a younger, less recognizable contingent that includes California Senator Kamala Harris and New York Senator Kirsten Gillibrand. Several potential Democratic presidential contenders spoke about the party's future at a recent conference in Washington hosted by the Center for American Progress, a Democratic-leaning public policy institute in Washington. Among the speakers was Massachusetts Senator Elizabeth Warren, who said Democrats face an uphill battle to win back control of Congress this year because of long-standing Republican advantages in winning a majority in the House of Representatives. \\"We can't climb that hill by ignoring the millions of Americans who are angry and scared about the damage this president and this Republican Party have done to our democracy,\\" Warren told the conference to a round of applause. \\"We can't ignore it and we shouldn't want to ignore it.\\" According to the above context, answer the following question.

We look at the possible answers and determine their relevancy to the question. Step 2: Evaluate each option 1. annoyance - This could be a possible reaction to the situation, as some people may be annoyed by the spread of gossip or information that doesn't interest them. However, it doesn't encompass the full scope of the potential outcome. 2. notoriety - This is the most relevant answer, as it directly describes a person becoming well-known for their actions, which is a clear consequence of telling many people about their escapades. 3. emotional distress - It is possible that the person in question could experience emotional distress as a result of their exploits being talked about, but this is not a definitive outcome and may vary depending on the context. 4. religion - This answer has little to no connection to the question, as the spread of information about someone's actions is not specifically linked to religious beliefs or practices. 5. riot - While spreading information about someone's actions could potentially lead to a riot in extreme circumstances, it is not the most common or expected outcome, so it is less aligned with human common sense.

The United States Congress enacted the Securities Act of 1933, also known as the 1933 Act, the Securities Act, the Truth in Securities Act, the Federal Securities Act, or the '33 Act, Title I of Pub. L. 73-22, 48 Stat. 74, codified at 15 U.S.C. § 77a et seq.), was enacted by the US Congress on May 27, 1933, during the Great Depression, after the stock market crash of 1929. Legislated pursuant to the Interstate Commerce Clause of the Constitution, it requires every offer or sale of securities that uses the means and instrumentalities of interstate commerce to be registered with the SEC pursuant to the 1933 Act, unless an exemption from registration exists under the law. The term \`\`Means and instrumentalities of interstate commerce'' is extremely broad, and it is virtually impossible to avoid the operation of the statute by attempting to offer or sell a security without using an \`\`instrumentality'' of interstate commerce. Any use of a telephone, for example, or the mails would probably be enough to subject the transaction to the statute. is the securities act of 1933 still in effect?","output":"Yes, the Securities Act of 1933 is still in effect. The Act was enacted following the stock market crash of 1929 and the subsequent Great Depression to protect investors and restore confidence in the financial markets. Over the years, it has undergone various amendments and refinements but remains a critical framework governing securities law in the United States. The primary objectives of the Securities Act of 1933 are to: 1. Require companies to disclose relevant financial and non-financial information to potential investors, enabling them to make informed investment decisions. 2. Prevent fraud and misrepresentation in the issuance of securities, which was commonplace prior to the enactment of the legislation. 3. Regulate the primary market of securities, where the issuance and distribution of new securities take place. The requirements of the Securities Act of 1933 include mandatory registration of securities with the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) unless an exemption applies. This disclosure process involves filing a registration statement that includes detailed information about the issuing company, its management, financial condition, and the securities being issued. The SEC reviews the registration statement for compliance with the disclosure requirements and, once satisfied, declares it effective, after which the company is free to offer and sell the securities.  There are several exemptions from the registration requirements, such as private placements made under Regulation D, intrastate offerings, and securities issued by the government, among others. Companies issuing securities under these exemptions are subject to specific rules and requirements, but the process is less burdensome compared to the full registration process. In addition to the original 1933 Act, other legislation has been enacted to enhance the regulation of securities markets, including the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, the Investment Company Act of 1940, and the Investment Advisers Act of 1940. These acts, along with the 1933 Securities Act, constitute the foundation of securities law in the United States, which is continuously updated and refined to adapt to evolving financial markets and practices. In conclusion, the Securities Act of 1933 remains in effect as an essential aspect of the US securities law. Its focus on ensuring financial transparency and investor protection has contributed significantly to the stability and growth of the US financial markets."},{"instruction":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

The doctor operated on the pancreas but not the liver because the","output":"patient was suffering from pancreatitis, a condition that required immediate attention to alleviate inflammation and prevent further complications. Pancreatitis is an ailment where the pancreas, an essential organ located behind the stomach, becomes inflamed due to various factors such as gallstones, excessive alcohol consumption, or autoimmune disorders. The pancreas plays a critical role in the digestive process by producing insulin to regulate blood sugar levels and enzymes that aid in breaking down food. The doctor's primary focus was on addressing the pancreatitis because if left untreated, it could lead to severe complications such as persistent pain, malnutrition, and, in extreme cases, organ failure or death. The inflammation of the pancreas causes the release of digestive enzymes, which begin to attack the pancreas itself, leading to damage and, occasionally, infection. As a result, the pancreas must be treated swiftly to prevent irreversible damage and restore normal function. Though the liver is another vital organ that contributes significantly to our overall health, in this instance, it was not the primary concern for the medical team. The liver performs various essential functions, including detoxification of harmful substances, metabolism, and producing bile to help digest fat. While certain diseases and conditions can negatively affect the liver, such as hepatitis, cirrhosis, or fatty liver disease, these were not the immediate concern for the patient in this case. The doctor carefully studied the patient's medical history, symptoms, and test results to rule out any liver-related issues before proceeding with the surgery. With a higher priority placed on addressing the pancreatitis, the surgeon developed a plan tailored to the patient's unique needs, factoring in the severity and underlying cause of the pancreatitis. The medical team closely monitored the patient's condition during surgery to ensure that they did not inadvertently contribute to any further complications. Treating pancreatitis may involve various surgical procedures, including the removal of the gallbladder, drainage of pancreatic pseudocysts, or clearing blocked ducts. In this patient's case, after determining the most appropriate surgical approach, the doctor successfully operated on the pancreas, resulting in a significant reduction in inflammation, alleviation of pain, and substantial improvement in the patient's overall wellbeing. While the liver was not operated on or treated, the medical team nevertheless monitored its function closely during the treatment process and will continue to do so in the patient's future check-ups. Regular screenings and follow-ups will help ensure that the liver remains healthy and functioning optimally, and any potential issues can be detected and addressed early before they escalate into more severe and challenging problems. In conclusion, the doctor decided to operate on the pancreas and not the liver because the patient's primary issue was pancreatitis. Their actions aimed to treat the patient's immediate concerns effectively, prevent further complications, and pave the way towards a full recovery and a healthy life.

Chinatown is a 1974 American neo-noir mystery film, directed by Roman Polanski from a screenplay by Robert Towne, starring Jack Nicholson and Faye Dunaway. The film was inspired by the California Water Wars, a series of disputes over southern California water at the beginning of the 20th century, by which Los Angeles interests secured water rights in the Owens Valley. The Robert Evans production, a Paramount Pictures release, was the director's last film in the United States and features many elements of film noir, particularly a multi-layered story that is part mystery and part psychological drama. Can we conclude that is the movie chinatown based on a true story?","output":"While the movie \\"Chinatown\\" is not based on a specific true story, it is heavily inspired by historical events and real-life situations that occurred in California during the early 20th century. The film uses the California Water Wars as a backdrop and combines elements of fiction and reality to create a complex narrative that addresses themes such as corruption, greed, and power. The California Water Wars were a series of conflicts and controversies over water rights and resources in Southern California, specifically in the Owens Valley. Los Angeles, a rapidly growing city at the time, sought access to water sources to meet its increasing demand. Under the supervision of water department superintendent William Mulholland, the city obtained water rights to the Owens Valley, leading to the construction of the Los Angeles Aqueduct in 1913. These events deeply impacted the Owens Valley communities, as their water resources were significantly reduced or depleted. This struggle over water rights, as well as the corruption and political maneuvering that accompanied it, serves as the primary inspiration for the film. \\"Chinatown\\" blends fiction with these historical events to create a unique and powerful narrative. The main protagonist, J.J. Gittes (played by Jack Nicholson), is a private investigator who becomes entangled in a web of deceit, betrayal, and murder as he uncovers a vast conspiracy surrounding the misappropriation of water resources in southern California. However, it is important to note that the characters and specific events depicted in \\"Chinatown\\" are not direct representations of historical figures and occurrences. For example, the film's villain Noah Cross (played by John Huston) is a character inspired by real-life individuals involved in the California Water Wars but is not a representation of a specific person. Similarly, the character of Evelyn Mulwray (played by Faye Dunaway) is not based on a real individual, but her last name, Mulwray, appears to be an homage to William Mulholland. In conclusion, while \\"Chinatown\\" is not based on a particular true story, it is heavily influenced by the real-life events that took place during the California Water Wars. The film skillfully intertwines fact and fiction, incorporating historical context and elements of noir to create an engaging and complex mystery that continues to resonate with audiences today."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

I heard that Casey drew Skylar's attention to the fact in order to protect her.  And I was wondering How would Casey feel afterwards? The answer is:","output":"To determine how Casey would feel after drawing Skylar's attention to the fact in order to protect her, I will follow these steps: 1. Analyze the situation and the relationship between Casey and Skylar. 2. Consider the possible emotions and thoughts that Casey might have after taking action. 3. Determine the most likely emotion or state of mind for Casey after the action. Step 1: Analyzing the situation and relationship - Casey and Skylar seem to have a relationship where they care for each other since Casey took action to protect Skylar. - The fact that Casey felt the need to protect Skylar signifies that either Skylar was in potential danger or in a vulnerable situation, and Casey wanted to help her out of that situation. Step 2: Considering possible emotions and thoughts for Casey - Relief: Casey might feel relief after successfully drawing Skylar's attention to the fact, which has protected her from harm or danger. - Concern: Despite having protected her, Casey might still feel concerned about the situation and express interest or anxiety about Skylar's well-being. - Pride: Casey could experience pride for having acted on their intuition and successfully ensuring Skylar's safety. - Happiness: Casey could feel happy knowing that their action made a positive impact on Skylar's life. Step 3: Determining the most likely emotion or state of mind for Casey after the action Taking into consideration the situation and the range of emotions that Casey could experience, it is most likely that Casey would feel a combination of relief, concern, and happiness. Relief and happiness would stem from successfully protecting Skylar and contributing positively to her well-being, while concern would be due to the nature of the situation and the possible continuation of any related issues. So, the answer is: Casey would most likely feel a mixture of relief, concern, and happiness after drawing Skylar's attention to the fact in order to protect her."},{"instruction":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

Please answer the following question: Given the following context:  Bowie was born David Robert Jones on 8 January 1947 in Brixton, London. His mother, Margaret Mary \\"Peggy\\" (née Burns; 2 October 1913 – 2 April 2001), was born at Shorncliffe Army Camp near Cheriton, Kent. Her paternal grandparents were Irish immigrants who had settled in Manchester. She worked as a waitress at a cinema in Royal Tunbridge Wells. His father, Haywood Stenton \\"John\\" Jones (21 November 1912 – 5 August 1969), was from Doncaster, and worked as a promotions officer for the children's charity Barnardo's. The family lived at 40 Stansfield Road, on the boundary between Brixton and Stockwell in the south London borough of Lambeth. Bowie attended Stockwell Infants School until he was six years old, acquiring a reputation as a gifted and single-minded child—and a defiant brawler.In 1953, Bowie moved with his family to Bromley. Two years later, he started attending Burnt Ash Junior School. His voice was considered \\"adequate\\" by the school choir, and he demonstrated above-average abilities in playing the recorder. At the age of nine, his dancing during the newly-introduced music and movement classes was strikingly imaginative: teachers called his interpretations \\"vividly artistic\\" and his poise \\"astonishing\\" for a child. The same year, his interest in music was further stimulated when his father brought home a collection of American 45s by artists including the Teenagers, the Platters, Fats Domino, Elvis Presley, and Little Richard. Upon listening to Little Richard's song \\"Tutti Frutti\\", Bowie would later say that he had \\"heard God\\".Bowie was first impressed with Presley when he saw his cousin dance to \\"Hound Dog\\". By the end of the following year, he had taken up the ukulele and tea-chest bass, begun to participate in skiffle sessions with friends, and had started to play the piano; meanwhile, his stage presentation of numbers by both Presley and Chuck Berry—complete with gyrations in tribute to the original artists—to his local Wolf Cub group was described as \\"mesmerizing ... like someone from another...  answer the following question:  What is the real name of the person whose father brought home a collection of American 45s?

Hughes and Pittman were teachers at Chastain Middle School in Jackson.","output":"Title: Carla Hughes Convicted for Two Counts of Capital Murder Once upon a time, in a place somewhere in Mississippi, something really bad happened. You know how when we do bad things, we get punished, like being sent to bed without dessert? In this case, a lady named Carla Hughes did something very, very bad. On a certain Tuesday, some people got together to decide if she deserved a timeout. These people are called a jury, kind of like when your teacher decides if you've been naughty or nice. These jurors said that Carla Hughes was very naughty. Here's what she did: In 2006, she hurt another lady named Avis Banks, who was going to have a baby in four months (that's like waiting for Christmas to come twice!). Carla didn't just hurt Avis, she hurt her really bad and Avis couldn't survive. It was just like when a villain hurts a superhero in a movie, but sadly this was real, not a movie.  But why did Carla do this? Prosecutors, who are like detective mummy and daddy trying to find out why the cookie jar is empty, said Carla did this because she liked Avis's fiance. You know how in some stories, a person might do mean things because they want someone else's toys? This was kind of like that. But in this case, the 'toy' was a man named Keyon Pittman.  Here's another interesting thing: Carla and Keyon were both teachers at a school. Yes, just like Ms. Rachel who teaches you how to count and Mr. Paul who reads you stories! They were both teachers at a place called Chastain Middle School, which is found in Jackson, a city in Mississippi. In the end, doing bad things led to Carla getting a big punishment, just like when you break your sister's toys, you get a time out. Only in this case, the time out is for a very, very long time.

I have a new situation: High lake had a lot of fresh and salt water mixing, therefore presented layers of stratified water.The water was poor in nutrients.Low lake had no such problems and it was a very abundant and prolific fishing spot.  But I can use this background: Water stratification is when water masses with different properties - salinity (halocline), oxygenation (chemocline), density (pycnocline), temperature (thermocline) - form layers that act as barriers to water mixing which could lead to anoxia or euxinia.[1] These layers are normally arranged according to density, with the least dense water masses sitting above the more dense layers.  Water stratification also creates barriers to nutrient mixing between layers. This can affect the primary production in an area by limiting photosynthetic processes. When nutrients from the benthos cannot travel up into the photic zone, phytoplankton may be limited by nutrient availability. Lower primary production also leads to lower net productivity in waters.[2]  What is an answer for this question: Which lake had more dissolved nutrients?","output":"Based on the given information, Low lake had more dissolved nutrients than High lake.  Let's break it down step-by-step to justify this answer: 1. High lake had a lot of fresh and salt water mixing, resulting in layers of stratified water. This stratification causes a separation between water masses with different properties like salinity, oxygenation, density, and temperature. 2. In High lake, water stratification leads to poor nutrient mixing between layers. This means the nutrients cannot easily travel up from deeper levels to the photic zone, where photosynthesis occurs, leading to limited primary production. 3. On the other hand, Low lake did not have any stratification issues. Without layers of stratified water, there are no barriers to prevent nutrient mixing within the lake. 4. Low lake is described as an abundant and prolific fishing spot. This suggests that there is a higher net productivity in Low lake, which can be attributed to a more efficient nutrient mixing process. Based on these justifications, we can conclude that Low lake had more dissolved nutrients compared to High lake."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant. User will you give you a task.

Question: Read the following context and choose the correct option to answer the question. Context: The U.S. Senate Judiciary Committee approved a bill Thursday that would protect from arbitrary dismissal the special counsel investigating Russian interference in the 2016 U.S. election. The measure, backed by 10 Democrats and four Republicans, would codify Justice Department regulations that the special counsel can only be fired by the attorney general or a designee for \\"misconduct, dereliction of duty, incapacity, conflict of interest, or other good cause.\\" The proposal would give the special counsel 10 days to challenge a dismissal in court. If a court determines the firing was not for \\"good cause,\\" the special counsel would be reinstated. The measure would also require the Justice Department to notify Congress when a special counsel is appointed and to report the findings of an investigation. While marking a strong show of support for Special Counsel Robert Mueller who is under frequent attack by President Donald Trump and some Republicans, the bill is unlikely to become law in the face of Republican opposition. Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell said last week that Trump will not fire Mueller and that there was no need to bring the measure to the Senate floor for a vote. House Speaker Paul Ryan has also opposed the idea. The legislation was introduced by four Senators earlier this month after Trump's sharp criticism of an FBI raid on his personal lawyer's home and office rekindled fears that Trump may fire Mueller and Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein, who supervises Mueller. Mueller is heading the federal investigation into Russia's electoral interference and possible collusion with the Trump presidential campaign. Trump has said there was no collusion and repeatedly denounced the probe as a \\"witch hunt.\\" Despite his harsh criticism of the Special Counsel and the Justice Department, Trump has dismissed reports that he's privately talked about firing Mueller.

Documents include the earliest-known photograph of Mandela, taken in 1938 when he was 19 or 20 years old, hand-written letters and diaries written during his 27 years of imprisonment, and previously unseen drafts of the sequel to his autobiography. The archive extends from the earliest known record of Mandela -- a Methodist church membership card issued in 1929 -- to handwritten notes taken during the talks to end apartheid, and beyond. The project is a collaboration between internet giant Google, and the Nelson Mandela Centre of Memory in South Africa, where the originals are held. Google gave a 1.25m grant to help preserve and digitize thousands of archival documents held in the Johannesburg-based center -- including never-before-seen items donated by the former president himself -- so that they could reach a broader audience online. Once again our beloved Mummy has been arrested and now she and Daddy are away in jailLetter from Mandela to his children The concept behind the project is that spreading Mandela's life story will help promote a message of social justice through the world. \\"It is invigorating to see our combined efforts become a reality,\\" said Verne Harris, head of the Nelson Mandela Center of Memory. \\"This digital initiative will make it possible for us to reach the full spectrum of our stakeholders, from the global elite to systemically disadvantaged South Africans.\\" The archive includes handwritten letters from his cell to his children, Zeni and Zindzi, after their mother, Winnie, had been arrested by the apartheid regime's police. \\"My Darlings,\\" begins the letter, dated June 23, 1969. \\"Once again our beloved Mummy has been arrested and now she and Daddy are away in jail. My heart bleeds as I think of her sitting in some police cell far away from home, perhaps alone and without anybody to talk to, and with nothing to read. Twenty four hours of the day longing for her little ones.\\" The project was the work of the Google Cultural Institute, which seeks to unlock the world's cultural and historical heritage by promoting and preserving culture online. Steve Crossan, the institute's director, said the archive showed \\"how the internet can help preserve historical heritage and make it available to the world. We've worked closely with the (center) to create an interactive online experience with powerful search and browsing tools, so that users can explore Mr Mandela's inspiring life story.\\" A similar grant of the same size has also been made to the Desmond Tutu Peace Center in Cape Town, for the documentation and digitisation of the South African Archbishop and anti-apartheid activist's archive. Other Google Cultural Institute projects have included showcasing the Dead Sea Scrolls, presenting thousands of works of art online through the Art Project, and the digitization of the Yad Vashem Holocaust materials. Speaking at the launch, South Africa's Minister of Science and Technology Naledi Pandor described Mandela as \\"the most famous ex-political prisoner of all time\\" and praised him for making \\"his own intellectual property available to all.\\" \\"He is an inspiration to us all. His qualities as a person inspire us. And they inspire our children,\\" she said. \\"It is a pioneering step to digitize Mr Mandela's own records and to post them online.\\" Write a one or two sentence summary.","output":"The Nelson Mandela Digital Archive Project, a collaboration between Google and the Nelson Mandela Centre of Memory, has made nearly 2000 mementos from the life of the late anti-apartheid leader freely available online, promoting social justice.

What is the solution?","output":"To solve for p in the equation 0 = -44*p - 108 - 68, let's first simplify the equation by combining like terms (i.e., the constants). Step 1: Combine the constants (-108 and -68). 0 = -44*p - 108 - 68 0 = -44*p - 176 (Since -108 - 68 = -176) Now, let's isolate p by dividing both sides of the equation by -44. Step 2: Divide both sides by -44. 0 = -44*p - 176 0/(-44) = (-44*p - 176)/(-44) Simplifying the left side of the equation: 0 = p + 4 (Since -176 / -44 = 4) Finally, we need to isolate p by subtracting 4 from both sides. Step 3: Subtract 4 from both sides. 0 - 4 = p + 4 - 4 -4 = p So, the solution to the math problem 0 = -44*p - 108 - 68 is p = -4."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Write a multi-choice question for the following article, with the given choices and answer: Article: Bamboo  is one of the nature's most surprising plants. Many people call this plant a tree, but it is a kind of grass. Like other kinds of grass, a bamboo plant may be cut very low to the ground, but it will grow back very quickly. A Japanese scientist recorded one bamboo plant that grew almost 1.5 meters in 24 hours! Bamboo grows almost everywhere in the world except Europe . There are more than 1,000 kinds of bamboo that grow around the world on both mountains and plains. Not all bamboo looks the same. Some bamboo plants are very thin. They may only grow to be a few centimeters wide while others may grow to more than 30 centimeters across. This plant also comes in different colors, from yellow to black to green. Many Asian countries have been using bamboo for hundreds of years. They often use bamboo for building new buildings. As a matter of fact, the cables  hold up the hanging bridge across the Min River in Sichuan are made of bamboo. The bridge has been in use for more than 1,000 years, and is still holding strong. In Africa, engineers are teaching poor farmers how to find water using bamboo. These African countries need cheap ways to find water because they have no money, and their fields often die from no rain and no water. It seems that bamboo is one of the best things they can use. Bamboo pipes and drills  can help to make the poor thirsty fields be watered. Options: A It is thin and easy to cut. B It grows everywhere. C It grows quickly after it's cut short. D It is short and green. Answer: C It grows quickly after it's cut short.

Given the below context:  \\"The Thing That Should Not Be\\" was inspired by the Cthulhu Mythos created by famed horror writer H.P. Lovecraft, with notable direct references to The Shadow Over Innsmouth and to Cthulhu himself, who is the subject matter of the song's chorus.  It is considered the heaviest track on the album, with the main riff emulating a beast dragging itself into the sea. The Black Sabbath-influenced guitars are downtuned, creating slow and moody ambiance. \\"Welcome Home (Sanitarium)\\" was based on Ken Kesey's novel One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest and conveys the thoughts of a patient unjustly caged in a mental institution. The song opens with a section of clean single strings and harmonics. The clean, arpeggiated main riff is played in alternating 44 and 64 time signatures. The song is structured with alternating somber clean guitars in the verses, and distorted heavy riffing in the choruses, unfolding into an aggressive finale. This structure follows a pattern of power ballads Metallica set with \\"Fade to Black\\" on Ride the Lightning and would revisit with \\"One\\" on ...And Justice for All.\\"Disposable Heroes\\" is an anti-war song about a young soldier whose fate is controlled by his superiors. With sections performed at 220 beats per minute, it is one of the most intense tracks on the record. The guitar passage at the end of each verse was Hammett's imitation of the sort of music he found in war films. The syncopated riffing of \\"Leper Messiah\\" challenges the hypocrisy of the televangelism that emerged in the 1980s. The song describes how people are willingly turned into blind religious followers who mindlessly do whatever they are told. The 136 beats per minute mid-tempo riffing of the verses culminates in a descending chromatic riff in the chorus; it increases to a galloping 184 beats per minute for the middle section that climaxes in a distorted scream of \\"Lie!\\". The title derives from the lyrics to the David Bowie song \\"Ziggy Stardust\\". \\"Orion\\" is a multipart instrumental highlighting Burton's bass playing. It opens with...

I have a test where I am given the following article, what is an answer for the question: What movie does the accountant watch? ?  A timid accountant in a Scottish Tweed weaving company cleverly bests the brash modern American efficiency expert whose ideas threaten his way of life. The film opens with Martin in Edinburgh buying whisky and cigarettes on the Royal Mile. We then see him at work as a head accountant in a very old-fashioned firm in the New Town. The Justerini & Brooks premises in George Street serves as their shop in the film. Martin is called to the death-bed of the owner, old MacPherson, at Moray Place. He is offered a whisky and declines. Old MacPherson drinks both and promptly dies. The new owner of the Tweed company, played by Robert Morley, is enamoured of a zealous American woman who is an efficiency expert and who wants to turn her hand to revolutionise the very traditional company. She insists on visiting \\"the factory\\" on the island, only to discover the task is done by old couples, on crofts where they spin the wool. She plans to replace the 700 weavers, dotted across the islands, with a single large factory. Whilst being driven through the city she even says the company should change to synthetic fibres, causing the chauffeur to drive into the back of a brewer's dray in the Grassmarket.  Martin watches a Sherlock Holmes film at the cinema and is inspired to kill Mrs Barrows. As he is a non-smoker and a non-drinker, he decides he should mislead any future investigation by smoking and drinking at the scene of the planned crime. He buys a half-bottle of whisky and packet of Capstan cigarettes. In her flat though, after a series of botched attempts his conscience gets the better of him and he cannot kill her. He tries to remove all evidence when Mr MacPherson appears suddenly, and manages to avoid detection. Back in the office MacPherson interrogates Martin and finds his denial more plausible than Mrs Barrows's claims. She cannot take any more, accusing them all of being mad, and she leaves for good. Thus Mr Martin wins his battle of the sexes.","output":"In the article, it states that Martin watches a Sherlock Holmes movie at the cinema."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant, who knows every language and how to translate one language to another.

Accountancy: A member specialized in accountancy will possess technical expertise in auditing, financial management, and the maintenance of government accounts. Their experience will be critical in ensuring transparency and accountability in the allocation and distribution of resources.   d. Legal expertise: A member with a background in law, ideally constitutional law, will assist the Finance Commission in interpreting the Constitution, particularly in matters related to the distribution of revenues between the central and state governments. 3. Tenure and Recommendations: Once constituted, the Finance Commission must submit its recommendations to the President within a stipulated period (usually two years). These recommendations serve as the basis for the distribution of financial resources between the central and state governments for the next five years. The members of the Finance Commission are selected based on their competence, expertise, and experience in their respective domains. The President's decision is influenced by various factors such as their integrity, objectivity, and commitment to the principles of federalism and fiscal prudence. The Finance Commission's recommendations, in turn, have significant implications for the overall financial health of the country, making the process of constituting the Finance Commission an essential aspect of India's governance. In summary, the Finance Commission is constituted by the President of India every five years, composed of a chairman and four members with expertise in fields such as finance, economics, public affairs, accountancy, and law. This team works together to formulate recommendations on distributing financial resources between the central and state governments, helping to maintain balanced fiscal relations and equitable growth across the nation."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

The tree in the yard of Megan was a lot bigger than the tree in Rachel's yard, because  Available choices: (A). Megan had an older tree.. (B). Rachel had an older tree..","output":"(A). Megan had an older tree. The tree in the yard of Megan was a lot bigger than the tree in Rachel's yard, because Megan had an older tree. This age difference between the two trees played a significant role in their growth and overall size. Over the years, Megan's tree had the opportunity to extend its roots deeper into the soil, allowing it to access essential nutrients and water that contributed to its impressive stature. Furthermore, the older tree had more time to develop a robust and sturdy trunk, providing the necessary support to withstand strong winds and storms. On the other hand, Rachel's tree, being younger, had not yet had the same amount of time to grow to its full potential. Younger trees usually have less developed root systems and fewer branches, leading to a smaller overall size compared to their more mature counterparts. However, with proper care and ideal growing conditions, Rachel's tree can eventually catch up to, and possibly even surpass, the size of Megan's tree. Apart from the age factor, other variables could also influence the size difference between the two trees. For instance, each tree's particular species could have varying growth rates and maximum sizes. Additionally, the specific environmental conditions in Megan and Rachel's yards, such as sunlight exposure, soil quality, and regular access to water, can greatly impact the trees' development. In conclusion, the significant size disparity between Megan's and Rachel's trees is primarily due to the older age of Megan's tree, which has allowed it more time to grow and develop its structure. With proper care and nurturing, Rachel's younger tree may one day reach a comparable size. However, uncontrollable factors such as tree species and environmental conditions might further affect the ultimate potential of each tree in their respective yards."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Obama’s gay inclusion at Morehouse President Obama speaking at Morehouse College commencement (Curtis Compton/European Pressphoto Agency/pool) President Obama’s commencement address at Morehouse College in Atlanta certainly has gotten a lot of attention. Quite a few Africans Americans don’t like how he talks to predominantly black audiences. As The Post’s Vanessa Williams reported yesterday, “The personal-responsibility finger-wagging … is getting old” for many. My disagreement with that is well documented. But lost in all the talk about what the president said to the all-male historically black college is how Obama ensured that his finger-wagging message also applied to gay black men. Now, there was some initial confusion about the reaction to what he said. But if you fast forward to 22:18 on the video of the president’s speech and listen attentively to the audio, you’ll hear something wonderful happen. Obama was extolling the hard work and dedication of one of the graduates who personified his urging to the men to “[k]eep setting an example for what it means to be a man.” “Be the best husband to your wife,” Obama said. “Yeah!” came the response. Then, the president added this: “Or your boyfriend, or your partner.” One of the graduates yelled out, “That’s right, too!” The reaction to that response was one of laughter and applause. Given Obama’s “wait a minute now” gesticulation during the laughter, perhaps he worried that folks were reacting negatively to his inclusiveness. He needn’t have. But it was another example of Obama’s fearlessness in talking about gay and lesbian issues in any audience, particularly African American audiences. Much like his mention of Stonewall and marriage equality in his inaugural address, Obama’s inclusion of “partner, or your boyfriend” was a startling moment. You couldn’t believe he said it, but you were glad and proud that he did. For, with just a few words, a black man who happens to be the leader of the free world told his fellow black men that gay relationships are on par with straight ones. They demand the same responsibility. They deserve the same respect. Follow Jonathan Capehart on Twitter. What is a short summary of the above article?","output":"The article discusses President Obama's commencement address at Morehouse College, an all-male historically black college in Atlanta.

Article: Find the size of your or another woman’s chest by wrapping your measuring material around the back over your shoulder blades, under the armpits, and across the fullest part of the bust.  Ensure that you do not pull whatever material you’re using to measure too tightly around the chest. To measure for a bra, bathing suit, or other garment that calls for it, you will use this bust measurement along with the circumference just below the bust to find the cup and band size. Use your measuring material to find the length around your or another woman’s torso at its smallest point, which is your natural waist. Find this point by observing where the torso creases when bending side to side, and note that it will fall above the bellybutton and below the ribcage.  Note that there is a difference between the natural waist and where the waistband may be worn on pants, skirts, or shorts. When clothing measurements call for a waist size, it refers to the narrowest part of the torso, the natural waist. You may want to take another measurement below the natural waist where you know you will wear a garment. Be sure to exhale and relax, or have the woman you’re measuring do so, before you take a waist measurement. The abdomen shouldn’t be enlarged with air, sucked in smaller, or otherwise in an unnatural or unrelaxed state. Wrap your measuring material around your own or another woman’s hips at their fullest point to determine hip size.  The fullest point of the hips is generally about 8 inches below the natural waist, but of course the distance varies from person to person. Take a few different measurements if you need to ensure that you find the widest point. If you’re taking the measurement on yourself, make sure your measuring material is level across your hips and rear end by observing yourself in a mirror. Take the measurement of the inseam for a pair of pants by measuring along one leg from groin to ankle with the leg remaining straight.  This is best done on another person or with help from someone else to take a measurement on you. If you don’t have someone to help, you can also measure the inseam on a pair of pants that fits you well.  The proper inseam for a pair of pants may vary depending on the style of pants and the height of the heel on the shoe worn with them. Use your measuring material to take any other measurements that a sizing chart or clothing pattern calls for.  Make sure that you always take a measurement from the fullest part or longest extension of a body part. Measure around the widest part of your arm or thigh, for example, and measure for the length of a sleeve with your arm bent to accommodate movement.  It may be helpful to keep a piece of string or elastic tied around the natural waist, as it will be used as an endpoint for other measurements like front waist length, back waist length, and rise.

While performing the task think step-by-step and justify your steps. Celine Marie Claudette Dion,  ChLD (; French: [selin djo]; born 30 March 1968) is a Canadian singer. Born into a large family from Charlemagne, Quebec, Dion emerged as a teen star in the French-speaking world after her manager and future husband Rene Angelil mortgaged his home to finance her first record. Dion first gained international recognition in the 1980s by winning both the 1982 Yamaha World Popular Song Festival and the 1988 Eurovision Song Contest where she represented Switzerland. Dion was born in Charlemagne, Quebec, the youngest of 14 children of Therese (nee Tanguay), a homemaker, and Adhemar Dion, a butcher, both of French-Canadian descent. Dion was raised a Roman Catholic in a poor, but, by her own account, happy home in Charlemagne. Music had always been a major part of the Dion family; indeed, Dion herself was named after the song \\"Celine,\\" which French singer Hugues Aufray had recorded two years before her own birth. On 13 August 1973, at the age of five, the young Celine made her first public appearance at her brother Michel's wedding, where she performed Christine Charbonneau's song \\"Du fil des aiguilles et du coton\\". She continued to perform with her siblings in her parents' small piano bar called Le Vieux Baril, \\"The Old Barrel.\\" From an early age, Dion had dreamed of being a performer. In a 1994 interview with People magazine, she recalled, \\"I missed my family and my home, but I don't regret having lost my adolescence. I had one dream: I wanted to be a singer.\\"  At age 12, Dion collaborated with her mother and her brother Jacques to write and compose her first song, \\"Ce n'etait qu'un reve,\\" whose title translates as \\"It Was Only a Dream\\" or \\"Nothing But A Dream.\\" Her brother Michel sent the recording to music manager Rene Angelil, whose name he discovered on the back of a Ginette Reno album. Angelil was moved to tears by Dion's voice and decided to make her a star. In 1981, he mortgaged his home to fund her first record, La voix du bon Dieu, which later became a local No. 1 hit and made Dion an instant star in Quebec. Her popularity spread to other parts of the world when she competed in the 1982 Yamaha World Popular Song Festival in Tokyo, Japan, and won the musician's award for \\"Top Performer\\" as well as the gold medal for \\"Best Song\\" with \\"Tellement j'ai d'amour pour toi\\".  By 1983, in addition to becoming the first Canadian artist to receive a gold record in France for the single \\"D'amour ou d'amitie\\" (\\"Of Love or of Friendship\\"), Dion had also won several Felix Awards, including \\"Best Female performer\\" and \\"Discovery of the Year\\". Further success came when Dion represented Switzerland in the 1988 Eurovision Song Contest with the song \\"Ne partez pas sans moi\\" and won the contest by a close margin in Dublin, Ireland.  At age eighteen, after seeing a Michael Jackson performance, Dion told Angelil that she wanted to be a star like Jackson. Though confident in her talent, Angelil realized that her image needed to be changed in order for her to be marketed worldwide. Dion receded from the spotlight for a number of months, during which she underwent dental surgery to improve her appearance, and was sent to the Ecole Berlitz in 1989 to polish her English.  In 1989, during a concert on the Incognito Tour, Dion injured her voice. She consulted the otorhinolaryngologist William Gould, who gave her an ultimatum: have immediate surgery on her vocal cords or do not utilize them at all for three weeks. Dion chose the latter and underwent vocal training with William Riley.

What are the most important words in the following sentence: commuters make their way through thick fog along a road .","output":"The most important words in the sentence \\"commuters make their way through thick fog along a road\\" are \\"commuters,\\" \\"thick fog,\\" and \\"road.\\" These words serve critical roles in shaping the overall meaning and understanding of the sentence. 1. \\"Commuters\\" - This word is crucial because it identifies the group of people that the sentence is primarily about. Commuters are individuals who travel regularly from one place to another, usually for work or school. By specifying \\"commuters,\\" the sentence emphasizes its focus on these habitual travelers, setting the scene for their movement amidst the given conditions. 2. \\"Thick fog\\" - This phrase indicates the critical environmental condition in which the commuters are traveling. \\"Thick fog\\" describes a particularly dense and low-lying cloud-like formation that can obscure visibility and make navigation challenging. It presents an obstacle for the commuters, making their journey more difficult. Thus, this phrase adds essential context to the situation and can also evoke feelings of uncertainty or peril. 3. \\"Road\\" - The term \\"road\\" is significant because it establishes the setting where the action is taking place. It highlights the mode of transportation being used (walking, biking, or driving, for example) and reveals the type of environment where the commuters are navigating. Mentioning \\"road\\" provides crucial spatial understanding while also indicating that the commuters are likely using some form of land-based transportation throughout their journey. Together, these three essential words – \\"commuters,\\" \\"thick fog,\\" and \\"road\\" – provide the foundation upon which the sentence's meaning is built. They paint a vivid picture of a challenging situation that commuters must navigate, ultimately allowing the reader to comprehend the scenario being described, even if they are not personally familiar with commuting through foggy conditions."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Metta means non-romantic love, kindness,and friendliness. It is a feeling that comes from your heart, and it has to be cultivated and practiced. It is usually practiced in five stages. If you are a beginner, try to stay in each stage for five minutes.  Stage 1- Feel metta for yourself.  Focus on feelings of peace, tranquility, strength, and confidence.  You can repeat the phrase \\"May I be well and happy.\\" to yourself. Stage 2- Think of a friend and all of the things that you like about them. Repeat the phrase, \\"May they be well; may they be happy.\\" Stage 3- Think of someone that you are neutral about.  You do not like them or dislike them.  Consider the person's humanity and extend your feelings of metta to that person. Stage 4- Think of someone that you do not like at all.  Instead of thinking about why you do not like them and having hateful thoughts, send your feelings of metta to them. Stage 5- In this last stage, think of every single person including yourself.  Send metta to those people, your city, your neighborhood, your country, and the entire world. This type of mediation will teach you to concentrate and focus your thoughts.  Through this mediation you can learn to practice mindfulness, relax, and rid yourself of anxiety.  Find a sitting position that is comfortable for you. Your spine needs to be upright and relaxed. Your shoulders should be relaxed and slightly rolled back and down. Support your hands on a cushion or in your lap. Once you have your posture, begin going through the different stages. Each stage should last for at least 5 minutes.  Stage 1- Count internally (breathe in, breathe out, 1 breathe in, breathe out 2, etc.) after each breath until you reach 10. Start over once you have reached 10.  Focus on the sensations of breathing in and out.  Your mind will wander.  Just bring your thoughts back to your breathing. Stage 2-  Continue to breathe in cycles of 10, but count before you inhale this time (e.g.,1, breathe in, breathe out, 2, breathe in, breathe out, 3, etc.). Focus on the sensations you have when you are inhaling. Stage 3- Breathe in and out without counting. Try to see your breathing as a continuous process instead of just breathing in and breathing out. Stage 4- Your focus should now be in the sensations of your breath as it enters and leaves your body. This may be your breath passing over your nostrils or your upper lip. The ultimate goal of Buddhism is to achieve inner peace and then share your experience with other people. Attaining nirvana is not only for your benefit, but for the world as well. It is important for you to be a source of encouragement and support for others.  This is as simple as giving someone a hug if he or she is feeling down. If someone is important to you or does something nice for you, let the person know how you feel. Let people know that you are grateful for them and appreciate them.  If someone is having a bad day, provide a listening ear. Your happiness is directly related to the happiness of other people. Showing compassion promotes happiness for all. You can practice compassion in many ways:  Turn off your cell phone when you are spending time with friends and family. Make eye contact when someone is talking to you and listen without interrupting. Volunteer in your community. Open doors for other people. Be empathetic towards people.  For example, if someone is upset, acknowledge and try to understand why they are upset.  Ask them what you can do to help. Listen and show concern for their feelings. When you practice mindfulness, you pay attention to how you think and feel in the present moment.  Mindfulness is not only for meditation but for your every day life as well.  For example, you can be mindful as you eat, shower, or get dressed in the morning. Start by choosing one activity and then focus on the sensations in your body and your breathing as you do it.  If you want to mindful while you are eating, concentrate on the taste, texture, and smell of the food as you eat it. As you wash the dishes, pay attention to the temperature of the water, how your hands feel as you clean the dishes, and how the water feels as you rinse the dishes. Instead of listening to the music or the television as you get dressed in the morning, get ready in silence.  Notice how you feel.  Were you tired or well rested when you woke up? How does your body feel as you put on clothes or shower? Summary:","output":"\\"Metta\\" is a form of meditation focused on cultivating feelings of love, kindness, and friendliness, and is practiced by focusing thoughts on oneself, loved ones, neutral acquaintances, disliked individuals, and then all beings, thereby promoting mindfulness, relaxation, and anxiety-relief; Buddhist principles suggest sharing these peaceful experiences and showing compassion to benefit individuals and the world."},{"instruction":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

I have a test where I am given the following article, what is an answer for the question: What is the last name of the person who was occupied intermittently from the mid 1920s until around 1938? ?  Jean Sibelius's Symphony No. 8 was his final major compositional project, occupying him intermittently from the mid-1920s until around 1938, though he never published it. During this time Sibelius was at the peak of his fame, a national figure in his native Finland and a composer of international stature. A fair copy of at least the first movement was made, but how much of the Eighth Symphony was completed is unknown. Sibelius repeatedly refused to release it for performance, though he continued to assert that he was working on it even after he had, according to later reports from his family, burned the score and associated material, probably in 1945. Much of Sibelius's reputation, during his lifetime and subsequently, derived from his work as a symphonist. His Seventh Symphony of 1924 has been widely recognised as a landmark in the development of symphonic form, and at the time there was no reason to suppose that the flow of innovative orchestral works would not continue. However, after the symphonic poem Tapiola, completed in 1926, his output was confined to relatively minor pieces and revisions to earlier works. During the 1930s the Eighth Symphony's premiere was promised to Serge Koussevitzky and the Boston Symphony Orchestra on several occasions, but as each scheduled date approached Sibelius demurred, claiming that the work was not ready for performance. Similar promises made to the British conductor Basil Cameron and to the Finnish Georg Schnéevoigt likewise proved illusory. It is thought that Sibelius's perfectionism and exalted reputation prevented him ever completing the symphony to his satisfaction; he wanted it to be even better than his Seventh. After Sibelius's death in 1957, news of the Eighth Symphony's destruction was made public, and it was assumed that the work had disappeared forever. But in the 1990s, when the composer's many notebooks and sketches were being catalogued, scholars first raised the possibility that fragments of the music for the lost symphony might have survived. Since... The answer to this question is:","output":"Sibelius. The last name of the person who was occupied intermittently from the mid 1920s until around 1938 is Jean Sibelius, a Finnish composer who was working on his Symphony No. 8 during this time period."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

She closed the door and started to go back to her room across the hall. She was halfway through a romance novel. But Hadley's delicious oatmeal raisin cookies were calling to her. She walked down the stairs to the kitchen and put a few cookies on a plate. Then she poured a glass of milk. She wondered what Elmo was doing. Was he in the Media Room with Carsie? Their Media Room? Before Elmo and Carsie got together, Elmo and Macy used to spend hours almost every night in that room. Some nights he had almost kissed her.

(ii) Monica was wearing sandals..","output":"Tanya avoided getting bitten by the snake that bit Monica, because she was equipped with better preventive measures. Unlike Monica, who was wearing sandals, which exposed her feet to potential threats, Tanya took a more cautious approach in her choice of footwear. First, Tanya assessed the environment and determined the likelihood of encountering snakes in the area. Considering that snakes can often be found in grassy or rocky habitats, Tanya decided to prioritize her safety by wearing shoes that offered her more protection. Second, Tanya chose to wear closed-toe shoes, as they would provide a barrier between her feet and any potential danger, including snake bites. This was a wise decision because, although Tanya was wearing sandals, her feet were still exposed and vulnerable to a snake bite. Next, Tanya learned more about the types of snakes that inhabited the area and their preferred environments. By being more informed, she was able to anticipate potential encounters and take necessary precautions. Finally, Tanya remained vigilant and alert in her surroundings, which allowed her to spot the snake and avoid it. In contrast, Monica was less cautious and did not notice the snake before it bit her. In conclusion, Tanya avoided getting bitten by the snake that bit Monica, because she recognized the potential risks and took appropriate preventative measures. By wearing closed-toe shoes, staying informed about the local snake population, and being vigilant, Tanya was able to keep herself safe from harm."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Build a movie plot around this: What do the assassins dress as? RCMP ERT operators","output":"Title: The Red Deception Step 1: Introducing the Protagonist and Setting The movie is set in present-day Canada. We are introduced to Adam, a key witness in an ongoing high-profile criminal investigation against an international crime syndicate. Due to the risk of assassination, Adam is placed in Witness Protection under the supervision of Canada's elite RCMP (Royal Canadian Mounted Police) Emergency Response Team (ERT) operators. Step 2: Introducing the Antagonist The antagonist is an international crime syndicate leader called Damon, who feels threatened by Adam's testimony in the investigation. Damon hires a group of skilled assassins to eliminate Adam at any cost. Step 3: Assassins' Plan and Disguise The assassins devise a plan to infiltrate the RCMP ERT unit assigned to protect Adam by disguising themselves as ERT operators. They forge credentials, plant backstories, and study the authentic operation tactics to seamlessly blend in. The assassins infiltrate the security team using their disguises. Step 4: Tension Escalates As the trial date approaches, more accidents and unexplained incidents take place, raising suspicion among the real ERT members. Adam, though initially safe, starts to feel uneasy, suspecting that there is a mole within the protection team. Step 5: Protagonist's Action Adam decides to take matters into his own hands. He contacts a former childhood friend, Sarah, who is now a freelance investigative journalist. Together, they start gathering information that might expose the assassins within the team. Step 6: Culminating Confrontation and Reveal As Adam and Sarah discover crucial evidence indicating the presence of the disguised assassins, they confront the moles, leading to an intense action sequence and showdown inside the safehouse. In a dramatic reveal, the assassins' true identities are exposed. The remaining trustworthy ERT members, Adam, and Sarah work together to stop the assassins. Step 7: Resolution and Conclusion With the skilled teamwork and efforts of the real ERT members, Adam, and Sarah, the assassins are neutralized. Adam's testimony is successfully submitted in the trial, helping to take down the international crime syndicate. Realizing the importance of her work, Sarah vows to continue her investigative journalism, focusing on stories involving corrupt officials and hidden enemies. Adam, grateful for the protection he received from the RCMP ERT, decides to find ways to repay the debt and fight against crime in his own way."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

The description may include multiple steps but you should only ouput one SQL statement that accomplishes every step. An SQL query works by selecting data from a table where certain conditions apply. A table contains columns where every row in that table must have a value for each column. Every table has a primary key that uniquely identifies each row, usually an id. To choose which columns are returned you specify that after the \\"SELECT\\" statement. Next, you use a \\"FROM\\" statement to specify what tables you want to select the data from. When you specify a table you can rename it with the \\"AS\\" statement. You can reference that table by whatever name follows the \\"AS\\" statement. If you want to select data from multiple tables you need to use the \\"JOIN\\" statement. This will join the tables together by pairing a row in one table with every row in the other table (Cartesian Product). To limit the number of rows returned you should use the \\"ON\\" statement. This will only return rows where the condition specified after the statement is true, this is usually an equals operator with primary keys. You can also use the \\"WHERE\\" statement to specify that only rows with column values statisfying a certain condition, should be returned. The \\"GROUP BY\\" statement will group rows together that have equal column values for whatever columns follows the statement. The \\"HAVING\\" statement will return groups that statisfy whatever condition follows the statement. Any column(s) being returned from grouped rows must either be an aggregate function, (AVG, MAX, COUNT, SUM, ...) of a column, or the column(s) that the data was grouped by. To sort the returned data you can use the \\"ORDER BY\\" command which will order the data by whatever aggregate function or column follows the statement. The \\"DESC\\" statement will sort in descending order and the \\"ASC\\" statement will sort in ascending order. Finally, you can use the \\"LIMIT\\" statement to return a certain number of rows. When \\"*\\" is used in an SQL statement every column is returned. For example, SELECT * FROM table WHERE attribute = 1, will select every column from rows with the attribute column equal to 1. Input: Step 1: For each row in College table, find the corresponding rows in Tryout table. Step 2: find each value of Tryout's cName in the results of step 1 along with the summation of enr of the corresponding rows to each value Output:","output":"SELECT t.cName, SUM(c.enr)  FROM College AS c JOIN Tryout AS t  ON c.id = t.cID GROUP BY t.cName;"},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

While viscosity and surface tension increase as the strength of intermolecular forces increase, vapor pressure decreases . This is because the stronger the intermolecular forces are, the harder it is for liquid molecules to escape into the gas phase. Vapor pressure a measure of how much of a substance is in the gas phase when that substance is at equilibrium; that is, the number of molecules in the gas and liquid phases are not changing. The more molecules that are able to escape into the gas phase, the higher the vapor pressure. Vapor pressure is also proportional to temperature.

What were the names of the pupils who revered Saint-Saëns as a genius?  Answer the above question based on the context below:  Charles-Camille Saint-Saëns (French: [ʃaʁlkamij sɛ̃sɑ̃s]; 9 October 1835 – 16 December 1921) was a French composer, organist, conductor and pianist of the Romantic era. His best-known works include Introduction and Rondo Capriccioso (1863), the Second Piano Concerto (1868), the First Cello Concerto (1872), Danse macabre (1874), the opera Samson and Delilah (1877), the Third Violin Concerto (1880), the Third (\\"Organ\\") Symphony (1886) and The Carnival of the Animals (1886). Saint-Saëns was a musical prodigy; he made his concert debut at the age of ten. After studying at the Paris Conservatoire he followed a conventional career as a church organist, first at Saint-Merri, Paris and, from 1858, La Madeleine, the official church of the French Empire. After leaving the post twenty years later, he was a successful freelance pianist and composer, in demand in Europe and the Americas. As a young man, Saint-Saëns was enthusiastic for the most modern music of the day, particularly that of Schumann, Liszt and Wagner, although his own compositions were generally within a conventional classical tradition. He was a scholar of musical history, and remained committed to the structures worked out by earlier French composers. This brought him into conflict in his later years with composers of the impressionist and dodecaphonic schools of music; although there were neoclassical elements in his music, foreshadowing works by Stravinsky and Les Six, he was often regarded as a reactionary in the decades around the time of his death. Saint-Saëns held only one teaching post, at the École de Musique Classique et Religieuse in Paris, and remained there for less than five years. It was nevertheless important in the development of French music: his students included Gabriel Fauré, among whose own later pupils was Maurice Ravel. Both of them were strongly influenced by Saint-Saëns, whom they revered as a genius. The answer to this question is:","output":"Gabriel Fauré and Maurice Ravel were the pupils who revered Saint-Saëns as a genius. Step 1: Identify the relevant information in the given context. The passage mentions that Saint-Saëns held only one teaching post at the École de Musique Classique et Religieuse in Paris. Step 2: Locate the names of the students who studied under Saint-Saëns. In the text, it is stated that Gabriel Fauré was one of his students. Step 3: Identify any indirect students who were influenced by Saint-Saëns through their own teachers. The text states that Maurice Ravel was a pupil of Gabriel Fauré, who was himself a student of Saint-Saëns. Therefore, Ravel is an indirect pupil of Saint-Saëns. Step 4: Determine if these students revered Saint-Saëns as a genius. The passage explicitly states that both Fauré and Ravel revered Saint-Saëns as a genius. Conclusion: The pupils who revered Saint-Saëns as a genius were Gabriel Fauré and Maurice Ravel."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant. You will be given a task.

The plot, riddled with inconsistencies and disjointed story arcs, failed to engage the audience and connect us to its central characters. While the premise was intriguing, featuring a protagonist grappling with the blurred lines between reality and the products of his own mind, the execution was severely lacking. The narrative struggled to find its footing and ultimately left the viewer confused and disoriented. As for the performances, the cast seemed to struggle with their roles. Not only was there a general absence of chemistry between the main characters, but the emotional range of the actors felt limited and underdeveloped. The dialogue appeared forced, as if hampered by an overly-expository script that left little room for authentic human interaction. The cinematography was far from any saving grace. Haphazard camera angles and choppy editing created a disorienting experience that distracted from any semblance of a cohesive storyline. Moreover, the visuals frequently strayed into over-the-top territory, pursuing shock value instead of supporting the film's thematic aims. Perhaps most disappointing was the film's score, which hovered between grating and forgettable. The soundtrack fell into the all-too-common trap of telegraphing plot twists through its heavy-handed melodies, thereby detracting from the intended suspense. In turn, the audience was left with a sense of déjà vu, robbed of any genuine surprise. In conclusion, \\"Disastrous Delusions\\" had the potential to be a captivating psychological thriller, but it ultimately collapsed under the weight of its own ambition. It was simply a cacophony of poor decision-making and careless craftsmanship that left viewers disengaged and yearning for the lights to come up.

State, 126 So. 3d 292, 295-96 (Fla. 3d DCA 2011) (counsel's failure to properly move for JOA when state did not prove all of the elements of charged crime constituted ineffective assistance of counsel on the face of the record).\\" Start by reading through it thoroughly. It discusses two cases (Bagnara and Gordon v. State), making similar observations about the inefficacies of counsel in each, specifically in relation to a failure to move for JOA when the state did not adequately demonstrate necessary elements of the crimes in question.  There is no suggestion here of a new legal rule that contradicts an older one. Thus, this would be classified as non-overruling, as it seems to be applying a prevailing legal principle—that of ineffective assistance of counsel in certain circumstances—rather than proposing a new one that would override a previous judicial decision."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Please answer the following question: Given the following context:  Jefferson Reed is a mild-mannered school teacher in Washington, D.C. His neighborhood is terrorized by a local gang called The Golden Lords, led by  Simon Caine and allied with drug lord Anthony Byers. One night, Jeff steps in to rescue a woman from the gang only to end up running from them himself. Hiding in a garbage dumpster, he manages to escape. As he climbs out, he is struck down by a glowing, green meteorite. His spine is crushed and he receives severe burns. A small fragment of the meteor was left over and taken by a vagrant named Marvin. Reed awakens several days later in the hospital, but when his bandages are taken off, he is miraculously healed of all injuries. Jeff soon discovered that the meteorite had left him with spectacular abilities such as flight, x-ray/laser vision, superhuman strength, speed, and hearing, invulnerability, healing powers, the ability to absorb a book's content by touch, super breath, telepathy with dogs (which he uses to communicate with his own dog, Ellington), and telekinesis. Confiding this to his parents Ted and Maxine, they convince him to use his powers to help the community. His mother designs a costume and as the Meteor Man, he takes on the Golden Lords. He shuts down 15 crack houses, stops 11 robberies, brings peace between the police, the Crips, and the Bloods where they begin to work together to rebuild the community they destroyed, and plants a giant garden in the middle of the ghetto.  answer the following question:  What is the last name of the person struck down by a green meteorite?

After nine months of work, the band had an album's worth of material ready for release, but they were not satisfied with the results; Mullen said that the songs \\"had no magic\\". The group subsequently enlisted Steve Lillywhite to take over as producer in Dublin in January 2004. Lillywhite, along with his assistant Jacknife Lee, spent six months with the band reworking songs and encouraging better performances. Several other producers received credits on the album, including Lanois, Eno, Flood, Carl Glanville, and Nellee Hooper; Bono acknowledged that the involvement of multiple producers affected the record's \\"sonic cohesion\\". Released in November 2004, How to Dismantle an Atomic Bomb received favourable reviews from critics. The album featured lyrics touching on life, death, love, war, faith, and family. It reached number one in 30 countries, including the US, where first-week sales of 840,000 copies nearly doubled those of All That You Can't Leave Behind, setting a personal best for the band. Overall, it sold 9 million copies globally. For the album's release, U2 partnered with Apple for several cross-promotions: the first single, \\"Vertigo\\", was featured in a television advertisement for the company's iPod music player, while a U2-branded iPod and digital box set exclusive to the iTunes Store were released. \\"Vertigo\\" was an international hit, topping the charts in Ireland and the UK, while reaching number two in Canada, number five in Australia, and number 31 in the US.

John broke the tablet when he placed the box on it not knowing the  Available choices: A. tablet is heavy.. B. box is heavy..","output":"B. box is heavy. The sentence ends with option B: \\"John broke the tablet when he placed the box on it not knowing the box is heavy.\\" This option accurately showcases the source of the issue, which was the weight of the box causing the tablet to break.  In this situation, John was seemingly unaware of the significant weight of the box. Had he realized how heavy it was, he might have taken more caution when placing the box on top of the tablet, thus potentially avoiding damaging the tablet. The heavy box exerted too much force on the tablet, surpassing its structural integrity and ultimately causing it to break. Option A, \\"tablet is heavy,\\" does not provide a fitting conclusion to the sentence. The heaviness of the tablet itself would not be the cause for it to break in the given scenario. Instead, the weight or force exerted upon it by the box would be the primary contributor to the tablet's breakage. Understanding the importance of adequately supporting and securing delicate items like electronic devices can keep such incidents from occurring. Individuals should take care to store and manage their valuables safely and cautiously, remaining vigilant for any potential risk factors that might expose their belongings to harm. Moreover, becoming aware of the weight of objects before placing them on top of delicate items like tablets can help prevent damage and ensure the longevity of these devices."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Theodore Roosevelt Jr. ( ROH-z@-velt; October 27, 1858 - January 6, 1919) was an American statesman and writer who served as the 26th President of the United States from 1901 to 1909. He also served as the 25th Vice President of the United States from March to September 1901 and as the 33rd Governor of New York from 1899 to 1900. As a leader of the Republican Party during this time, he became a driving force for the Progressive Era in the United States in the early 20th century. His face is depicted on Mount Rushmore, alongside those of George Washington, Thomas Jefferson, and Abraham Lincoln. Theodore Roosevelt Jr. was born on October 27, 1858, at East 20th Street in New York City. He was the second of four children born to socialite Martha Stewart \\"Mittie\\" Bulloch and businessman and philanthropist Theodore Roosevelt Sr. He had an older sister, Anna (nicknamed \\"Bamie\\"), a younger brother, Elliott, and a younger sister, Corinne. Elliott was later the father of First Lady Anna Eleanor Roosevelt, the wife of Theodore's distant cousin, President Franklin Delano Roosevelt. His paternal grandfather was of Dutch descent; his other ancestry included primarily Scottish and Scots-Irish, English and smaller amounts of German, Welsh, and French. Theodore Sr. was the fifth son of businessman Cornelius Van Schaack \\"C.V.S.\\" Roosevelt and Margaret Barnhill. Theodore's fourth cousin, James Roosevelt I, who was also a businessman, was the father of President Franklin Delano Roosevelt. Mittie was the younger daughter of Major James Stephens Bulloch and Martha P. \\"Patsy\\" Stewart. Through the Van Schaacks, Roosevelt was a descendant of the Schuyler family.  Roosevelt's youth was largely shaped by his poor health and debilitating asthma. He repeatedly experienced sudden nighttime asthma attacks that caused the experience of being smothered to death, which terrified both Theodore and his parents. Doctors had no cure. Nevertheless, he was energetic and mischievously inquisitive. His lifelong interest in zoology began at age seven when he saw a dead seal at a local market; after obtaining the seal's head, Roosevelt and two cousins formed what they called the \\"Roosevelt Museum of Natural History\\". Having learned the rudiments of taxidermy, he filled his makeshift museum with animals that he killed or caught; he then studied the animals and prepared them for display. At age nine, he recorded his observation of insects in a paper entitled \\"The Natural History of Insects\\".  Roosevelt's father significantly influenced him. His father was a prominent leader in New York's cultural affairs; he helped to found the Metropolitan Museum of Art, and had been especially active in mobilizing support for the Union during the Civil War, even though his in-laws included Confederate leaders. Roosevelt said, \\"My father, Theodore Roosevelt, was the best man I ever knew. He combined strength and courage with gentleness, tenderness, and great unselfishness. He would not tolerate in us children selfishness or cruelty, idleness, cowardice, or untruthfulness.\\" Family trips abroad, including tours of Europe in 1869 and 1870, and Egypt in 1872, shaped his cosmopolitan perspective. Hiking with his family in the Alps in 1869, Roosevelt found that he could keep pace with his father. He had discovered the significant benefits of physical exertion to minimize his asthma and bolster his spirits. Roosevelt began a heavy regime of exercise. After being manhandled by two older boys on a camping trip, he found a boxing coach to teach him to fight and strengthen his body.Answer this question using a quote from the following article: Who was his father?","output":"Theodore Roosevelt Jr.'s father was Theodore Roosevelt Sr., a businessman and philanthropist.

Answer the following question: I read this background article the other day: Some of Antarctica has been warming up; particularly strong warming has been noted on the Antarctic Peninsula. A study by Eric Steig published in 2009 noted for the first time that the continent-wide average surface temperature trend of Antarctica is slightly positive at >0.05 °C (0.09 °F) per decade from 1957 to 2006. This study also noted that West Antarctica has warmed by more than 0.1 °C (0.2 °F) per decade in the last 50 years, and this warming is strongest in winter and spring. This is partly offset by autumn cooling in East Antarctica. There is evidence from one study that Antarctica is warming as a result of human carbon dioxide emissions, but this remains ambiguous. The amount of surface warming in West Antarctica, while large, has not led to appreciable melting at the surface, and is not directly affecting the West Antarctic Ice Sheet's contribution to sea level. Instead the recent increases in glacier outflow are believed to be due to an inflow of warm water from the deep ocean, just off the continental shelf. The net contribution to sea level from the Antarctic Peninsula is more likely to be a direct result of the much greater atmospheric warming there.In 2002 the Antarctic Peninsula's Larsen-B ice shelf collapsed. Between 28 February and 8 March 2008, about 570 km2 (220 sq mi) of ice from the Wilkins Ice Shelf on the southwest part of the peninsula collapsed, putting the remaining 15,000 km2 (5,800 sq mi) of the ice shelf at risk. The ice was being held back by a \\"thread\\" of ice about 6 km (4 mi) wide, prior to its collapse on 5 April 2009. According to NASA, the most widespread Antarctic surface melting of the past 30 years occurred in 2005, when an area of ice comparable in size to California briefly melted and refroze; this may have resulted from temperatures rising to as high as 5 °C (41 °F).A study published in Nature Geoscience in 2013 (online in December 2012) identified central West Antarctica as one of the fastest-warming regions on Earth.

Read this: Mining was important in Thuringia since the later Middle Ages, especially within the mining towns of the Thuringian Forest such as Schmalkalden, Suhl and Ilmenau. Following the industrial revolution, the old iron, copper and silver mines declined because the competition from imported metal was too strong. On the other hand, the late 19th century brought new types of mines to Thuringia: the lignite surface mining around Meuselwitz near Altenburg in the east of the Land started in the 1870s, and two potash mining districts were established around 1900. These are the Südharzrevier in the north of the state, between Bischofferode in the west and Roßleben in the east with Sondershausen at its centre, and the Werrarevier on the Hessian border around Vacha and Bad Salzungen in the west. Together, they accounted for a significant part of the world's potash production in the mid-20th century. After the reunification, the Südharzrevier was abandoned, whereas K+S took over the mines in the Werrarevier. Between 1950 and 1990, uranium mining was also important to cover the Soviet Union's need for this metal. The centre was Ronneburg near Gera in eastern Thuringia and the operating company Wismut was under direct Soviet control.

Q: U.S. President-elect Donald Trump's choice to lead the Department of Homeland Security, retired Marine General John Kelly, is one of the U.S. military's longest-serving commanders and the most senior officer since 9/11 to lose a child in combat. Blunt-spoken and popular with military personnel, Kelly, 66, was born and raised in Boston. He initially enlisted in the U.S. Marine Corps in 1970, and was discharged from active duty as a sergeant in 1972. He returned to the Marine Corps after graduation from the University of Massachusetts Boston in 1976. Kelly rose through the ranks to serve as the commanding general of the Multi-National Force West in Iraq from February 2008 to February 2009, and as the commander of Marine Forces Reserve and Marine Forces North in October 2009. He succeeded General Douglas Fraser as commander of U.S. Southern Command (USSOUTHCOM) on Nov. 19, 2012. As the head of USSOUTHCOM, Kelly was in charge of the military jail at Guantanamo Bay, Cuba, and also was exposed to immigration, drug trafficking and other cross-border problems over a sprawling area that encompasses 32 countries in the Caribbean, Central America and South America. Kelly took a tough tone on border security, warning Congress last year about the risks of smuggling rings in Mexico and Central America that spirited \\"tens of thousands of people,\\" including unaccompanied children, \\"to our nation's doorstep.\\" He also clashed with the Obama administration over plans to close Guantanamo and the Pentagon's order that opened all jobs in combat units to women, including the most elite forces like the Navy SEALs.

What is the answer for the question: What is the first name of the person who announced, with Shuttlesworth, that desegregation would take place 90 days from May 15? from the following article ?  Desegregation in Birmingham took place slowly after the demonstrations. King and the SCLC were criticized by some for ending the campaign with promises that were too vague and \\"settling for a lot less than even moderate demands\\". In fact, Sydney Smyer, president of the Birmingham Chamber of Commerce, re-interpreted the terms of the agreement. Shuttlesworth and King had announced that desegregation would take place 90 days from May 15.  Smyer then said that a single black clerk hired 90 days from when the new city government took office would be sufficient. By July, most of the city's segregation ordinances had been overturned.  Some of the lunch counters in department stores complied with the new rules. City parks and golf courses were opened again to black and white citizens.  Mayor Boutwell appointed a biracial committee to discuss further changes.  However, no hiring of black clerks, police officers, and firefighters had yet been completed and the Birmingham Bar Association rejected membership by black attorneys.The reputation of Martin Luther King Jr. soared after the protests in Birmingham, and he was lauded by many as a hero. The SCLC was much in demand to effect change in many Southern cities. In the summer of 1963, King led the March on Washington for Jobs and Freedom where he delivered his most famous speech, \\"I Have a Dream\\". King became Time's Man of the Year for 1963 and won the Nobel Peace Prize in 1964. Four months after the Birmingham campaign settlement, someone bombed the house of NAACP attorney Arthur Shores, injuring his wife in the attack. On September 15, 1963, Birmingham again earned international attention when Ku Klux Klan members bombed the 16th Street Baptist Church on a Sunday morning and killed four young girls.  FBI informant Gary Thomas Rowe was hired to infiltrate the KKK and monitor their activities and plans. Rowe was involved, along with the Birmingham Police, with the KKK attacks on the Freedom Riders, led by Fred Shuttlesworth, in Anniston, Alabama on May 14, 1961. In...

Like many farmers in the Midwest, Poskin is concerned about getting caught in the middle of a trade war, as Trump ramps up economic pressure on China. Those fears were heightened after Trump announced plans Thursday to impose tariffs on as much as 60 billion worth of Chinese imports. \\"I'm fearful they will retaliate on those tariffs,\\" Poskin said. \\"Soybean exports, wheat, poultry, chicken, beef — [there are] any number of products that we export to their country that they could retaliate with.\\" The announcement has unnerved many in Trump's base of supporters in U.S. agriculture. The trade tensions have also rattled global markets, which until recently had performed strongly. Trump's tariff decision was meant to punish Chinese companies that benefit from unfair access to U.S. technology. U.S. businesses have long bristled at Beijing's requirement that they transfer technology to Chinese companies as a condition of entering the Chinese market. U.S. businesses have also had their technology stolen through cyberattacks. \\"We have a tremendous intellectual property theft situation going on,\\" Trump said during the signing ceremony Thursday.

On 11 August 2015, he made his professional senior debut for Central Coast Mariners FC in the 2015 FFA Cup against Wellington Phoenix FC. Can we draw the following conclusion? Jake McGing made his professional senior debut after he was 20 years old","output":"Yes, we can draw the conclusion that Jake McGing made his professional senior debut after he was 20 years old. Here is a detailed explanation for this conclusion: Jake McGing was born on 22nd May 1994. To determine his age at the time of his professional senior debut, we need to analyze the time frame between his birthdate and the date of his debut match. His debut took place on 11th August 2015 when he played for Central Coast Mariners FC in the 2015 FFA Cup against Wellington Phoenix FC. To calculate the time difference between these two dates, we can follow these steps: 1. Calculate the years between his birth year (1994) and the year of the debut (2015): 2015 - 1994 = 21 years. 2. Calculate the months between his birth month (May) and the month of the debut (August): August falls in the eighth month of the year, whereas May falls in the fifth. So, 8 - 5 = 3 months. 3. Calculate the days between his birth date (22nd) and the date of the debut (11th): Since we are looking at the day of the debut, the days calculation would be 11 - 22 = -11 days. Putting these calculations together, we can determine that Jake McGing was 21 years, 3 months, and -11 days old. To account for the negative days value, we can borrow one month, making the age 21 years, 2 months, and 20 days. In conclusion, Jake McGing made his professional senior debut at the age of 21 years, 2 months, and 20 days, which is indeed after he was 20 years old."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Next question: where was the first factory built in the world?","output":"The first factory in the world, as we understand the term today, was built in 1717 in Derby, a town in Derbyshire, England. This factory, called Lombe's Mill or more specifically, the Derby Silk Mill, was a silk-spinning factory designed and built by John Lombe and George Sorocold. John Lombe, an Englishman, was an apprentice in the Italian silk industry and had gained valuable insights into the intricate processes of Italian silk spinning. His aim was to bring this knowledge back to England and establish a competitive silk industry in his home country. The silk-spinning mill was strategically constructed on an island in the River Derwent because water from the river was used to power the mill's machinery. In fact, the clever positioning and utilization of the water power made the Derby Silk Mill one of the first successful applications of hydro-power in a large-scale industrial operation. The factory featured a remarkable architectural structure that housed the silk-spinning processes and the mill's production workspaces. With five stories and a distinctively consistent layout, Derby Silk Mill was purpose-built to accommodate the large machinery and the hundreds of workers required for the silk production process. At this factory, silk was spun into threads which were then woven into fabrics, representing the entire range of production processes under one roof. This marked a revolutionary change in the textile industry, as previous smaller-scale workshops and cottage industries had separate locations for each production step. The concept of a centralized and organized production site that housed all the required tools, machinery, and workforce greatly influenced the transition towards the Industrial Revolution and paved the way for future large-scale factories across various industries. As the first factory in the world, Lombe's Mill, or the Derby Silk Mill, holds historical significance not only for its successful implementation of innovative manufacturing practices and the industrial application of hydraulic power but also for serving as the blueprint for future industrial innovations and advancements. Its founding acted as a catalyst for the burgeoning industrial revolution in the late 18th and early 19th centuries, driving economic growth and changing the course of human history."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Questions: The judge had ruled the murder case could be reopened, excavation soon began where? Options: - dead - construction site - under ground - egypt - cemetary A:","output":"The option in line with common sense to answer the question is \\"construction site.\\" When the judge ruled that the murder case could be reopened, it is natural to assume that new evidence or leads have come to light, prompting the need for further investigation. In cases like these, investigators typically examine locations connected to the case, or areas where the new evidence suggests that relevant discoveries might be made. In this particular situation, the excavation would likely occur at a construction site. Construction sites are often home to digging and land development, which makes them prime locations for uncovering hidden or previously buried evidence. If the new leads in the case suggest that the victim's body, a murder weapon, or some other piece of critical evidence could be buried at a construction site, it would make the most sense to begin the excavation there. On the other hand, the other options provided do not fit as logically within the context of a murder case investigation. For example, \\"dead\\" is not a location, and as such, would not be an appropriate place to begin an excavation. Likewise, although \\"underground\\" could imply a literal excavation site, the term is too general to have any practical meaning or direction for investigators in the context of a reopened murder case. The option \\"Egypt\\" would be highly unlikely as well, unless the case is specifically related to Egypt or involves Egyptian nationals. However, even if there were a connection to Egypt, the term itself is too broad to pinpoint an accurate location for excavation. Lastly, a \\"cemetery\\" might be associated with burials, but it is not a place where excavation typically occurs - especially in the context of a murder investigation. Exhuming a buried body in a cemetery would generally require a specific and compelling reason. In conclusion, selecting the \\"construction site\\" option makes the most sense in the context of a reopened murder case. This is primarily due to its relevance to the investigative process and greater likelihood of yielding evidence compared to the other options provided."},{"instruction":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

You will be given a task. You must generate a detailed and long answer. Please answer the following question: Question: What do people do with the old song about twisting? Options: - flat - bend - and shout - straighten - unravel  The answer is \\"and shout\\" because Answer:","output":"The option \\"and shout\\" is the correct response, referencing a popular old song that became a cultural phenomenon, renowned for getting people on the dance floor for decades. This song, \\"Twist and Shout,\\" was first recorded by the Top Notes in 1961 and later covered by several other musicians, including the Beatles in 1963, which led to its fame and worldwide recognition.  The \\"Twist\\" in the song's title isn't merely a part of the lyrics; it corresponds to a dance style that became popular in the 60s - known as the Twist dance. This dance involves standing with feet approximately shoulder width apart and twisting the hips in one direction and then the other. It was one of the foundational dances of the era and was simplistic enough that everyone could participate.  \\"And Shout\\" refers to the song's expressive and rhythmic vocal line which encourages enthusiastic participation from the audience, with shouts and hollers often punctuating the lyrics at concerts and social gatherings. This aspect of engagement and interaction made it favored among the party scene, and it continues to be a crowd favorite at weddings, parties, and other social gatherings up till this day. In the context of the question, the actions \\"flat,\\" \\"bend,\\" \\"straighten,\\" or \\"unravel,\\" are not related to or associated with the song in any way. None of these actions express or signify any key elements or actions associated with the iconic song \\"Twist and Shout.\\" Therefore, the best and most accurate option to choose is \\"and shout.\\" Moreover, the impact and influence of the song \\"Twist and Shout\\" have transcended generations. It is not only remembered as one of the greatest dance songs but also as an embodiment of the energy and carefree spirit of the 60s. Its endurance as a pop culture phenomenon proves its timeless appeal and universal popularity, which can be attributed to its lively rhythm, memorable chorus, and the fun of dancing the Twist.  So when people are asked what they do with the old song about twisting, they \\"and shout,\\" meaning they engage with it, often by singing loudly (shouting) and dancing (twisting) enthusiastically, replicating the joy, energy, and enthusiasm that the song initially and still continues to inspire."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

The phenomenon of biochemical processes' serving to regulate distant tissues by means of secretions directly into the circulatory system is called endocrine signaling. The major endocrine glands include the pineal gland, pituitary gland, pancreas, ovaries, testes, thyroid gland, parathyroid gland, and adrenal glands. The endocrine system is in contrast to the exocrine system, which secretes its hormones to the outside of the body using ducts. The endocrine system is an information signal system like the nervous system, yet its effects and mechanism are classifiably different. The endocrine system's effects are slow to initiate, and prolonged in their response, lasting from a few hours up to weeks. The nervous system sends information very quickly, and responses are generally short lived. In vertebrates, the hypothalamus is the neural control center for all endocrine systems. The field of study dealing with the endocrine system and its disorders is endocrinology, a branch of internal medicine. Special features of endocrine glands are, in general, their ductless nature, their vascularity, and commonly the presence of intracellular vacuoles or granules that store their hormones. In contrast, exocrine glands, such as salivary glands, sweat glands, and glands within the gastrointestinal tract, tend to be much less vascular and have ducts or a hollow lumen.  - A hormone (from the Greek participle ) is any member of a class of signaling molecules produced by glands in multicellular organisms that are transported by the circulatory system to target distant organs to regulate physiology and behaviour. Hormones have diverse chemical structures, mainly of 3 classes: eicosanoids, steroids, and amino acid derivatives (amines, peptides, and proteins). The glands that secrete hormones comprise the endocrine signaling system. The term hormone is sometimes extended to include chemicals produced by cells that affect the same cell (autocrine or intracrine signalling) or nearby cells (paracrine signalling).  - An anesthesiologist (American English) or anaesthetist (British English) is a physician trained in anesthesia and perioperative medicine.  - The pancreas is a glandular organ in the digestive system and endocrine system of vertebrates. In humans, it is located in the abdominal cavity behind the stomach. It is an endocrine gland producing several important hormones, including insulin, glucagon, somatostatin, and pancreatic polypeptide which circulate in the blood. The pancreas is also a digestive organ, secreting pancreatic juice containing digestive enzymes that assist digestion and absorption of nutrients in the small intestine. These enzymes help to further break down the carbohydrates, proteins, and lipids in the chyme. The pancreas is also known as mixed gland.  - The stomach is a muscular, hollow, dilated part of the gastrointestinal tract that functions as an important organ in the digestive system. The stomach is present in many animals including vertebrates, echinoderms, insects (mid-gut), and molluscs. In humans and many other vertebrates it is involved in the second phase of digestion, following mastication (chewing).  - Liver transplantation or hepatic transplantation is the replacement of a diseased liver with some or all of a healthy liver from another person (allograft). The most commonly used technique is phototropic transplantation, in which the native liver is removed and replaced by the donor organ in the same anatomic location as the original liver. Liver transplantation is a viable treatment option for end-stage liver disease and acute liver failure. Typically three surgeons and two anesthesiologists are involved, with up to four supporting nurses. The surgical procedure is very demanding and ranges from 4 to 18 hours depending on outcome. Numerous anastomoses and sutures, and many disconnections and reconnections of abdominal and liver tissue, must be made for the transplant to succeed, requiring an eligible recipient and a well-calibrated live or cadaveric donor match.  - A cadaver, also called corpse (singular) in medical, literary, and legal usage, or when intended for dissection, is a deceased body. The obsolete British term \\"lich\\" for \\"corpse\\", sometimes spelled \\"lych\\", is no longer even listed in major British dictionaries such as Longman, Macmillan, Cambridge, or Oxford Online Dictionaries. However, the term \\"lich\\" has been revived in modern fantasy fiction for a type of \\"undead\\" creature.  - Echinoderm is the common name given to any member of the phylum Echinodermata (from Ancient Greek, , \\"echinos\\"  \\"hedgehog\\" and , \\"derma\\"  \\"skin\\") of marine animals. The adults are recognizable by their (usually five-point) radial symmetry, and include such well-known animals as sea stars, sea urchins, sand dollars, and sea cucumbers, as well as the sea lilies or \\"stone lilies\\". Echinoderms are found at every ocean depth, from the intertidal zone to the abyssal zone. The phylum contains about 7000 living species, making it the second-largest grouping of deuterostomes (a superphylum), after the chordates (which include the vertebrates, such as birds, fishes, mammals, and reptiles). Echinoderms are also the largest phylum that has no freshwater or terrestrial (land-based) representatives.  - Pancreatic juice is a liquid secreted by the pancreas, which contains a variety of enzymes, including trypsinogen, chymotrypsinogen, elastase, carboxypeptidase, pancreatic lipase, nucleases and amylase. The pancreas is located in the visceral region, and is a major part of the digestive system required for proper digestion and subsequent assimilation of macronutrient substances required for living.   - Endocrine glands are glands of the endocrine system that secrete their products, \\"hormones\\", directly into the blood rather than through a duct. The major glands of the endocrine system include the pineal gland, pituitary gland, pancreas, ovaries, testes, thyroid gland, parathyroid gland, hypothalamus and adrenal glands. The hypothalamus and pituitary gland are neuroendocrine organs.  Local chemical messengers, not generally considered part of the endocrine system, include autocrines, which act on the cells that secrete them, and paracrines, which act on a different cell type nearby.

Help as much as you can. Given a passage and a query based on the passage, generate an unambiguous, concise and simple answer to the query from information in the passage. Note that the answer may not be present in exact form. At least, that’s the conclusion I draw from looking at the history of corrections of the S&P 500 Index based on daily data going back to December 30, 1949. Now that major indexes have officially entered correction territory, investors are wondering how long corrections tend to last. Let’s start with the worst-case scenario of a bear market. If a bear market is a move of 20% or more from peak-to-trough and a correction is a move of 10% to just under 20%, then the average bear market is a drop of 31.6% (median of 30.3%). I don’t think this is the start of a bear, though. As long as the future trend remains optimistic, the buying will resume. That leads to an even stronger bull market rally. In other words, a stock market correction can help the stock market catch its breath and hit even higher peaks. Most recessions occur with stock market declines of 30 percent or more. All stock market corrections are different, but some follow patterns. The current pattern looks more like 2011 than 1998, with some significant economic differences. All stock market corrections are different, but some follow patterns. How long do corrections last? Corrections generally last two months or less. They usually end when the price of a stock or a bond 'bottoms out'—for example, some will point to a stock reaching a 52-week low—and investors start buying again. How is a correction different from a bear market or capitulation? The stock market typically has a correction several times a year. For example, between 1983 and 2011, more than half of all quarters had a correction. That averages out to 2.27 per year. A stock market crash is when the 10 percent price drop occurs in just one day. Crashes can lead to a bear market. That's when the market falls another 10 percent, for a total decline of 20 percent or more. A stock market crash can cause a recession. The stock market usually makes up the losses in three months or so. If you sell during the correction, you will probably not buy in time to make up your losses. Corrections are inevitable. Is a correction good for the market? Many investors and analysts look at corrections as a necessary 'evil' to cool off an overheated stock or bond market. This is to prevent a huge sell-off or 'bubble burst,' as what happened with Internet stocks in 2000-2001. Definition: A stock market correction is when the market falls 10 percent from its 52-week high. Wise investors welcome it. A pullback allows the market to consolidate before going toward higher highs. Each of the bull markets in the last 40 years has had a correction. It's a natural part of the market cycle. Corrections can occur in any asset class. A correction is a decline or downward movement of a stock, or a bond, or a commodity or market index. The amount of the decline is at least 10 percent and a true correction exceeds that amount. In short, corrections are price declines that stop an upward trend. Query: how long do stock market corrections last","output":"Stock market corrections typically last around two months or less. They usually end when the price of a stock or a bond 'bottoms out' and investors start buying again."},{"instruction":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

It provides a place for religious activities, work and housing of Christian monks and nuns. The concept of the abbey has developed over many centuries from the early monastic ways of religious men and women where they would live isolated from the lay community about them. Religious life in an abbey may be monastic. An abbey may be the home of an enclosed religious order or may be open to visitors. The layout of the church and associated buildings of an abbey often follows a set plan determined by the founding religious order. Abbeys are often self-sufficient while using any abundance of produce or skill to provide care to the poor and needy, refuge to the persecuted or education to the young. Some abbeys offer accommodation to people who are seeking spiritual retreat. There are many famous abbeys across Europe.  - Tides are the rise and fall of sea levels caused by the combined effects of the gravitational forces exerted by the Moon and the Sun and the rotation of the Earth.  - Yr Wyddfa commonly known as Snowdon in English, is the highest mountain in Wales, at an elevation of above sea level, and the highest point in the British Isles south of the Scottish Highlands. It is located in Snowdonia National Park (\\") in Gwynedd, and has been described as \\"probably the busiest mountain in Britain\\". It is designated as a national nature reserve for its rare flora and fauna.  - The Isle of Man, also known simply as Mann, is a self-governing crown dependency in the Irish Sea between England and Northern Ireland.

Foreign relations and defence are the responsibility of the British Government.  - Thomas Telford FRS, FRSE (9 August 1757  2 September 1834) was a Scottish civil engineer, architect and stonemason, and a noted road, bridge and canal builder. After establishing himself as an engineer of road and canal projects in Shropshire, he designed numerous infrastructure projects in his native Scotland, as well as harbours and tunnels. Such was his reputation as a prolific designer of highways and related bridges, he was dubbed \\"The Colossus of Roads\\" (a pun on the Colossus of Rhodes), and, reflecting his command of all types of civil engineering in the early 19th century, he was elected as the first President of the Institution of Civil Engineers, a post he retained for 14 years until his death.  - Aberffraw is a small village and community on the south west coast of the Isle of Anglesey, in Wales, by the west bank of the Afon Ffraw. Access by road is by way of the A4080 and the nearest rail station is Bodorgan. In the early Middle Ages Aberffraw was the capital of the Kingdom of Gwynedd from c.860 AD until c.1170. Under the eponymous Aberffraw Dynasty it came to be the most important political centre in medieval Wales. The \\"Llys\\" remained the symbolic throne of the Kings of Gwynedd from the 9th century to the 13th century. The Royal Annals of Edward I of England show the Llys was dismantled in 1315 to provide building materials for nearby Beaumaris Castle.  - Wales is a country that is part of the United Kingdom and the island of Great Britain.

The country lies within the north temperate zone and has a changeable, maritime climate.  - Edward I (17/18 June 1239  7 July 1307), also known as Edward Longshanks and the Hammer of the Scots, was King of England from 1272 to 1307. He spent much of his reign reforming royal administration and common law. Through an extensive legal inquiry, Edward investigated the tenure of various feudal liberties, while the law was reformed through a series of statutes regulating criminal and property law. Increasingly, however, Edward's attention was drawn towards military affairs.  - The Menai Suspension Bridge is a suspension bridge to carry road traffic between the island of Anglesey and the mainland of Wales. The bridge was designed by Thomas Telford and completed in 1826 and is a Grade I listed building.  - Britannia Bridge is a bridge across the Menai Strait between the island of Anglesey and the mainland of Wales. It was originally designed and built by Robert Stephenson as a tubular bridge of wrought iron rectangular box-section spans for carrying rail traffic. Following a fire in 1970 it was rebuilt, initially as a single tier steel truss arch bridge, carrying rail traffic. A second tier was added later and opened in 1980 to accommodate road traffic.  - The United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland, commonly known as the United Kingdom (UK) or Britain, is a sovereign country in western Europe. Lying off the north-western coast of the European mainland, it includes the island of Great Britain (the name of which is also loosely applied to the whole country), the north-eastern part of the island of Ireland, and many smaller islands. Northern Ireland is the only part of the UK that shares a land border with another sovereign statethe Republic of Ireland. Apart from this land border, the UK is surrounded by the Atlantic Ocean, with the North Sea to its east, the English Channel to its south and the Celtic Sea to its south-south-west, giving it the 12th-longest coastline in the world. The Irish Sea lies between Great Britain and Ireland. With an area of , the UK is the 78th-largest sovereign state in the world and the 11th-largest in Europe. It is also the 21st-most populous country, with an estimated 65.1 million inhabitants. Together, this makes it the fourth most densely populated country in the European Union.  - The Principality or Kingdom of Gwynedd (Medieval Latin: \\"Venedotia\\" or \\"Norwallia\\"; Middle Welsh: \\"Guynet\\",) was one of several successor states to the Roman Empire that emerged in sub-Roman Britain in the 5th century during the Anglo-Saxon settlement of Britain.  - A tidal island is a piece of land that is connected to the mainland by a natural or man-made causeway that is exposed at low tide and submerged at high tide. Because of the mystique surrounding tidal islands many of them have been sites of religious worship, such as Mont Saint-Michel with its Benedictine Abbey. Tidal islands are also commonly the sites of fortresses because of their natural fortifications.  - The Bristol Channel is a major inlet in the island of Great Britain, separating South Wales from Devon and Somerset in South West England. It extends from the lower estuary of the River Severn to the North Atlantic Ocean. It takes its name from the English city of Bristol, and is over 30 miles (50 km) across at its widest point.  - In the history of Europe, the Middle Ages or medieval period lasted from the 5th to the 15th century. It began with the fall of the Western Roman Empire and merged into the Renaissance and the Age of Discovery. The Middle Ages is the middle period of the three traditional divisions of Western history: classical antiquity, the medieval period, and the modern period. The medieval period is itself subdivided into the Early, High, and Late Middle Ages.  - The Menai Strait (the \\"River Menai\\") is a narrow stretch of shallow tidal water about long, which separates the island of Anglesey from the mainland of Wales.  - Cribinau is a small tidal island off the south west coast of the isle of Anglesey in Wales between Porth China and Porth Cwyfan . The island is in Aberffraw Community , about 1.2 miles ( 2 km ) west of Aberffraw village . The island can be reached on foot at low tide . It is notable for the 13th - century Church in Wales church of St Cwyfan , called in Welsh : eglwys bach y mor ( \`\` the little church in the sea '' ) or simply Cwyfan .  - Beaumaris Castle, located in the town of the same name on the Isle of Anglesey in Wales, was built as part of Edward I's campaign to conquer the north of Wales after 1282. Plans were probably first made to construct the castle in 1284, but this was delayed due to lack of funds and work only began in 1295 following the Madog ap Llywelyn uprising. A substantial workforce was employed in the initial years under the direction of James of St George. Edward's invasion of Scotland soon diverted funding from the project, however, and work stopped, only recommencing after an invasion scare in 1306. When work finally ceased around 1330 a total of £15,000 had been spent, a huge sum for the period, but the castle remained incomplete.  - Great Britain, also known as Britain , is a large island in the north Atlantic Ocean off the northwest coast of continental Europe. With an area of , Great Britain is the largest European island and the ninth-largest in the world. In 2011 the island had a population of about 61 million people, making it the world's third-most populous island after Java in Indonesia and Honshu in Japan. The island of Ireland is situated to the west of it, and together these islands, along with over 1,000 smaller surrounding islands, comprise the British Isles archipelago.  - England is a country that is part of the United Kingdom. It shares land borders with Scotland to the north and Wales to the west. The Irish Sea lies northwest of England and the Celtic Sea lies to the southwest. England is separated from continental Europe by the North Sea to the east and the English Channel to the south. The country covers five-eighths of the island of Great Britain (which lies in the North Atlantic) in its centre and south; and includes over 100 smaller islands such as the Isles of Scilly, and the Isle of Wight.  - Le Mont-Saint-Michel (Norman: \\"Mont Saint Miché\\", ) is an island commune in Normandy, France. It is located about one kilometre off the country's northwestern coast, at the mouth of the Couesnon River near Avranches and is in size. , the island has a population of 44.  - The Irish Sea (, , , Ulster-Scots: \\"Airish Sea\\"), separates the islands of Ireland and Great Britain. It is connected to the Celtic Sea in the south by St George's Channel, and to the Inner Seas off the West Coast of Scotland in the north by the North Channel. Anglesey is the largest island within the Irish Sea, followed by the Isle of Man. The sea is occasionally, but rarely, referred to as the Manx Sea.  - Anglesey or Ynys Môn is an island off the north-west coast of Wales. With an area of , Anglesey is by far the largest island of Wales and the fifth-largest island in the British Isles. Anglesey is also the largest island in the Irish Sea by area, and the second most populous island in the Irish Sea (after the Isle of Man). The population at the 2011 census was 69,751. Two bridges span the Menai Strait, connecting the island to the mainland: the Menai Suspension Bridge, designed by Thomas Telford in 1826, and the Britannia Bridge.  - The Angles were one of the main Germanic peoples who settled in Britain in the post-Roman period.

Better late than never for Ian Poulter, who on Thursday produced what he considers his best round of a dreadful year at the penultimate tournament of the season. A dusted-off putter from better times made the difference, leaving him second in the Turkish Airlines Open after an eight-under-par round. By his own four-letter description, Poulter’s 2014 campaign has been woeful, with injuries, a missed cut at The Open, Twitter rows and an underwhelming Ryder Cup by his standards. In that time his world ranking tumbled from 12th to 44, leaving him in danger of slipping out of the top 50 for the first time since September 2006. But Thursday afternoon there were signs that the 38-year-old was somewhere close to his best, following a sixth-placed finish in China last week with a sublime round of seven birdies, an eagle and only one dropped shot. Ian Poulter insists he is 'feeling right now' after a year in which he has 'played s***' as he moves second. Miguel Angel Jimenez leads the Turkish Airlines Open on nine under par, a shot ahead of Poulter. He cited the new Titleist clubs he switched to after the Ryder Cup as well a putter he unearthed from the 2013 Open, in which he finished third. ‘I’d played s*** all year,’ Poulter said. ‘There’s no other word for it. It was disappointing. There was nothing good coming out of 2014. ‘It’s been tough to take, it really has. I thought I was doing the right things at the start of the year and took a massive step backwards with injuries and trying to play through them is not good. ‘That’s a horrible spiral to be in when you’ve got two tour cards to make sure you maintain. Thankfully I’m feeling right now.’ Poulter (left, taking an approach shot on the 11 and right, his reaction to the shot) is second on eight under par. Poulter added: ‘I am having a boost at the right time. Sometimes you get a new car and it makes you feel good. I got new sticks in the bag. It felt great to be able to do that and that they worked really quickly. ‘When you get something new you are excited to use it. I have been excited for the last couple of weeks. I am happy with everything.’ Miguel Angel Jimenez led by a stroke on a day that all but eliminated Jamie Donaldson’s chances of snatching the Race to Dubai from Rory McIlroy. The Welshman needs to win here and in Dubai next week while hoping McIlroy finishes outside the top five when he returns in the desert. But a level-par round of 72 left the Ryder Cup player nine shots behind Jimenez, while the other two Race contenders in Sergio Garcia and Victor Dubuisson were horribly off the pace, shooting rounds of 75 and 77 respectively. Meanwhile, Turkey insists it is still bidding to host the 2022 Ryder Cup, a day after announcing their withdrawal over environmental concerns.

Term limits, Sanders said, are something Trump \\"supports here in the United States, but that's a decision that would be up to China.\\" The Chinese Communist Party proposed removing the presidential two-term limit from China's constitution, state media reported Sunday. The move would be a further consolidation of power for Xi, who is already seen as one of China's most powerful leaders in decades.  On Monday, U.S. President Donald Trump praised Xi, saying he has a \\"very good relationship\\" and \\"great respect\\" for the Chinese leader. \\"I think that President Xi is unique. He's helping us with North Korea,\\" Trump said during a White House meeting with U.S. governors. Trump has not specifically addressed the issue of China removing term limits. To some, Sanders' comments are the latest evidence of a break in the long-standing U.S. tradition of encouraging democracy in China, and reflect an unwillingness to criticize undemocratic regimes. \\"In effect, she is saying that the U.S. is OK with Xi Jinping simply asserting that he will remain in power indefinitely,\\" said Sophie Richardson, China director at Human Rights Watch. \\"Does she realize China isn't a democracy?\\" During the presidential campaign, Trump regularly slammed China and its trade policies. But since becoming president, Trump has toned down the criticism. Instead, Trump has prioritized working with China to address North Korea's nuclear and ballistic missile programs.

The United States had issued a formal warning to the Taliban, and also to Sudan, that they would be held directly responsible for any attacks on Americans, wherever they occurred, carried out by the  Bin Laden network as long as they continued to provide sanctuary to it. For a brief moment, it had seemed as if the August strikes might have shocked the Taliban into thinking of giving up  Bin Laden. On August 22, the reclusive Mullah Omar told a working-level State Department official that the strikes were counterproductive but added that he would be open to a dialogue with the United States on  Bin Laden's presence in Afghanistan. Meeting in Islamabad with William Milam, the U.S. ambassador to Pakistan, Taliban delegates said it was against their culture to expel someone seeking sanctuary but asked what would happen to  Bin Laden should he be sent to Saudi Arabia. Yet in September 1998, when the Saudi emissary, Prince Turki, asked Mullah Omar whether he would keep his earlier promise to expel  Bin Laden, the Taliban leader said no. Both sides shouted at each other, with Mullah Omar denouncing the Saudi government. Riyadh then suspended its diplomatic relations with the Taliban regime. (Saudi Arabia, Pakistan, and the United Arab Emirates were the only countries that recognized the Taliban as the legitimate government of Afghanistan.) Crown Prince Abdullah told President Clinton and Vice President Gore about this when he visited Washington in late September. His account confirmed reports that the U.S. government had received independently. Other efforts with the Saudi government centered on improving intelligence sharing and permitting U.S. agents to interrogate prisoners in Saudi custody. The history of such cooperation in 1997 and 1998 had been strained. Several officials told us, in particular, that the United States could not get direct access to an important al Qaeda financial official, Madani al Tayyib, who had been detained by the Saudi government in 1997.67Though U.S. officials repeatedly raised the issue, the Saudis provided limited information. In his September 1998 meeting with Crown Prince Abdullah, Vice President Gore, while thanking the Saudi government for their responsiveness, renewed the request for direct U.S. access to Tayyib. The United States never obtained this access. An NSC staff-led working group on terrorist finances asked the CIA in November 1998 to push again for access to Tayyib and to see \\"if it is possible to elaborate further on the ties between Usama bin Ladin and prominent individuals in Saudi Arabia, including especially the  Bin Laden family.\\" One result was two NSC-led interagency trips to Persian Gulf states in 1999 and 2000. During these trips the NSC, Treasury, and intelligence representatives spoke with Saudi officials, and later interviewed members of the  Bin Laden family, about Usama's inheritance.

Your goal is to complete the task as faithfully as you can. While performing the task think step-by-step and justify your steps. Write a summary based on this article: It is difficult to convey the excitement I first felt when it was revealed that His Holiness Pope Francis was invited to Washington D.C. to address the world from the floor of the House of Representatives. Many believed, like I did, that this was an opportunity for the Pope to be one of the world’s great religious advocates and address the current intolerance of religious freedom. An opportunity to urgently challenge governments to properly address the persecution and execution of Christians and religious minorities; to address the heinous and senseless murders committed by ISIS and other terrorist organizations. An opportunity to address the enslavement, belittlement, rape and desecration of Christian women and children; to address the condoned, subsidized, intentionally planned genocide of unborn children by Planned Parenthood and society; and finally, an opportunity for His Holiness to refocus our priorities on right from wrong.            Media reports indicate His Holiness instead intends to focus the brunt of his speech on climate change--a climate that has been changing since first created in Genesis. More troubling is the fact that this climate change talk has adopted all of the socialist talking points, wrapped false science and ideology into “climate justice” and is being presented to guilt people into leftist policies. If the Pope stuck to standard Christian theology, I would be the first in line. If the Pope spoke out with moral authority against violent Islam, I would be there cheering him on. If the Pope urged the Western nations to rescue persecuted Christians in the Middle East, I would back him wholeheartedly. But when the Pope chooses to act and talk like a leftist politician, then he can expect to be treated like one. Artist and columnist Maureen Mullarkey effectively communicated this fallacy stating, “When papal preferences, masked in a Christian idiom, align themselves with ideological agendas (e.g. radical environmentalism) [they] impinge on democratic freedoms and the sanctity of the individual.”      The earth’s climate has been changing since God created it, with or without man. On that, we should all agree. In Pope Francis’ encyclical on the environment (written with the consultation of that great seminary the EPA and its embattled head Gina McCarthy), he condemned anyone skeptical of the link between human activity and climate change and adopted the false science being propagated by the Left. If the Pope wants to devote his life to fighting climate change then he can do so in his personal time. But to promote questionable science as Catholic dogma is ridiculous.            Furthermore, I am a proud Catholic. I chose to attend a Jesuit college in the Midwest, not just for my undergraduate but also my graduate studies (D.D.S.). I received an excellent education where I was taught to think critically, to welcome debate and discussion and to be held accountable for my actions; a trademark of a Jesuit education. And finally, I am a Conservative, a member of Congress, a constitutionalist and adamant defender of our Republic; an American that believes in strict adherence to the rule of law and a firm believer in our First Amendment protections, in this particular discussion, the freedom of religion.      So at this pivotal moment in world history, His Holiness, Pope Francis, is intending to spend the majority of his time on one of the world’s greatest stages focusing on climate change. I have both a moral obligation and leadership responsibility to call out leaders, regardless of their titles, who ignore Christian persecution and fail to embrace opportunities to advocate for religious freedom and the sanctity of human life. If the Pope plans to spend the majority of his time advocating for flawed climate change policies, then I will not attend. It is my hope that Pope Francis realizes his time is better spent focusing on matters like religious tolerance and the sanctity of all life. As the leader of the Catholic Church, and as a powerful voice for peace throughout the world, His Holiness has a real opportunity to change the climate of slaughter in the Middle East… not the fool’s errand of climate change. ||||| Rep. Paul Gosar, an Arizona Republican and a Catholic, said Friday he will boycott next week’s address to Congress by Pope Francis because he believes the pope will focus on climate change instead of “religious tolerance and the sanctity of life.”      Gosar published an op-ed on the conservative news site Townhall:      “I have both a moral obligation and leadership responsibility to call out leaders, regardless of their titles, who ignore Christian persecution and fail to embrace opportunities to advocate for religious freedom and the sanctity of human life.”      The he dismissed the pope’s recent encyclical calling for swift action on climate change, saying the climate has been changing “since God created it, with or without man … If the Pope wants to devote his life to fighting climate change then he can do so in his personal time. But to promote questionable science as Catholic dogma is ridiculous.”      Gosar added, “When the Pope chooses to act and talk like a leftist politician, then he can expect to be treated like one.”      The congressman reiterated those concerns to reporters Friday afternoon, saying he will not attend “without assurances” the pope would not focus his comments on climate change. He said “there are others that have gone to Rome to ask him to talk about the genocide that is occurring,” but it is clear that “he’s going to talk about climate change.”      While Gosar was the only congressman saying he would boycott the speech, he was not the only one raising concerns about the pope’s choice of topics.      Rep. John Fleming, R-La., told USA TODAY on Friday, “What I’m a little concerned about is that the pope seems to distract at times from some of the most important issues of faith — which is life — and he talks about issues like climate change.” The pope has “made some statements that would suggest that there may be certain level of acceptance of abortion,” Fleming said, and he would like to see the pope use his remarks to “re-emphasize the importance of protecting life and preventing abortion.” ||||| The seed for Wide00014 was:      - Slash pages from every domain on the web:                  -- a ranking of all URLs that have more than one incoming inter-domain link (rank was determined by number of incoming links using Wide00012 inter domain links)            -- up to a maximum of 100 most highly ranked URLs per domain      - Top ranked pages (up to a max of 100) from every linked-to domain using the Wide00012 inter-domain navigational link graph |||||","output":"The author expresses excitement about Pope Francis being invited to address the world from the floor of the House of Representatives but is disappointed with the apparently chosen topic for the speech - climate change.

In this entry the dominant role goes to Boris Karloff. Through specially designed astronomical equipment, Dr. Janos Rukh (Karloff) demonstrates to colleagues Dr. Felix Benet (Bela Lugosi), Sir Frances Stevens (Walter Kingsford), his wife Lady Stevens (Beulah Bondi) and their nephew Ronald Drake (Frank Lawton), that a meteorite containing a powerful element, landed on the African continent many millions of years in the past. Rukh impresses his guests who invite him to accompany them on an expedition to Africa to find the mysterious element. Rukh goes off on his own and discovers the place where the meteorite landed and the element which he names \\"Radium X\\". Due to Rukh's long absences, his comely young wife Diana (Frances Drake) becomes attracted to Drake and the two fall in love. Meanwhile Rukh becomes contaminated by Radium X to the point that anyone he touches will die instantly. The contamination causes his skin to emit a bright glow in the dark. Rukh goes to Benet for help. Benet devises an antidote which if taken on a daily basis, will provide temporary immunity to the element. Unfortuneatly, the deadly element also affects Rukh's brain, slowly turning him into a vindictive murderer. While Rukh is continuing his work, Sir Frances takes news of the discovery back to France. Diana and Ronald accompany him. When Benet informs him of this action, Rukh accuses the party of betraying him and his discovery and secretly plans his revenge. When he returns to France he learns of the healing power of Radium X as he cures his mother's (Violet Kemble Cooper) blindness and of Benet's work in curing the maladies of his patients. But Rukh's madness intensifies. First he murders an innocent man whom is identified as Rukh. Upon hearing of Rukh's apparent demise, Diana and Ronald marry.

Question: The seventh ruler of the dynasty in China that started in 206 BC and ended in 220 AD was? Context: The Xiongnu, a nomadic steppe confederation, defeated the Han in 200 BC and forced the Han to submit as a de facto inferior partner, but continued their raids on the Han borders. Emperor Wu of Han (r. 141–87 BC) launched several military campaigns against them. The ultimate Han victory in these wars eventually forced the Xiongnu to accept vassal status as Han tributaries. These campaigns expanded Han sovereignty into the Tarim Basin of Central Asia, divided the Xiongnu into two separate confederations, and helped establish the vast trade network known as the Silk Road, which reached as far as the Mediterranean world. The territories north of Han's borders were quickly overrun by the nomadic Xianbei confederation. Emperor Wu also launched successful military expeditions in the south, annexing Nanyue in 111 BC and Dian in 109 BC, and in the Korean Peninsula where the Xuantu and Lelang Commanderies were established in 108 BC.

Samantha Adeokun, from Silverdale, Lancashire, is accused of killing her partner Peter Davegun, 42, in a brutal attack on December 23 last year. Stafford Crown Court heard she flew into a rage and beat her boyfriend by kicking and punching him as he curled up in a ball to protect himself. Samantha Adeokun, 41, from Silverdale, Lancashire, is accused of killing her on/off partner of six years Peter Davegun, 42, (above) by punching, kicking and beating him with a metal guitar stand until he fell unconcious. He suffered multiple injuries to his head and body after also being bludgeoned with a metal guitar stand leaving behind 'a bloodbath', jurors were told. Emergency services arrived at his flat in Stoke-on-Trent, Staffordshire, after Adeokun waited one hour to dial 999. She claimed her partner had fallen and hit his head on a TV stand after tripping on a mat. Paramedics arrived just before 2.45pm and found Mr Davegun's body lying in the foetal position on his bedroom floor. The court heard he had extensive bruising and bite marks on his body and had suffered severe internal injuries and seven fractured ribs. He was pronounced dead at the property at around 3.20pm. Adeokun went on trial yesterday accused of murdering her on-off partner of six years following the drunken row. Prosecutor Deborah Gould, opening the case, said: 'The prosecution case says the defendant literally beat him to death using her fists, feet and part of a guitar stand. Stafford Crown Court heard how 41-year-old Adeokun allegedly attacked her partner at his flat in Stoke-on-Trent, Staffordshire (above) on December 23 last year during a drunken row. Mr Davegun died from his injuries. The court heard how Adeokun waited nearly one hour before calling emergency services after the alleged attack. When police arrived, Mr Davegun was found unconscious in a pool of blood and was pronounced dead. 'At least part of the time she was doing this, she was bleeding and standing above him. 'She struck him repeatedly, causing significant internal bruising and bleeding. She struck him from behind and from the front. 'You will hear from the pathologist that there's evidence he was struck while on the ground in the foetal position. 'After the attack, the defendant telephoned her daughter and said she was sorry. She said she and the deceased had a fight. 'She said she had been defending herself and Mr Davegun was, at that stage, unconscious. 'When her daughter asked if she had called 999, the defendant said she hadn't because she needed to get dressed because she had blood on her. 'She changed out of her clothing. Then, nearly an hour afterwards, she called paramedics, claiming Mr Davegun had fallen, hit his head and been unconscious for 40 minutes.' Adeokun denies murdering Mr Davegun and claims he fell and hit his head after tripping on a mat at the flat. The jury also heard a recording of the 999 call Adeokun made during which she described the scene as a 'bloodbath'. She told the operator: 'We had a big argument earlier on and he's just fell. 'I cut my finger and it looks bad. I cut my finger and it looks like I've killed him.' Adeokun denies murder. The trial continues. Sorry we are not currently accepting comments on this article.

Provide a detailed answer so user don’t need to search outside to understand the answer. I can use this background: No doubt you already have a good idea of what temperature is. You might say that it’s how warm or cool something feels. In physics, temperature is defined as the average kinetic energy of the particles of matter. When particles of matter move more quickly, they have more kinetic energy, so their temperature is higher. With a higher temperature, matter feels warmer. When particles move more slowly, they have less kinetic energy on average, so their temperature is lower. With a lower temperature, matter feels cooler.  Now, I have a new situation: David is a physicist. He teaches school children how matters and energy work. One day he was teaching them about two particles of matter, particle A and particle B. Particle A moves faster, but particle B moves slower. He was showing the children about different characteristics of moving particles.  Answer this question please: Which particle would have higher temperature, particle A or particle B? Answer:","output":"In this situation, particle A moves faster while particle B moves slower. As stated in the background information, temperature is defined as the average kinetic energy of the particles of matter. When particles move more quickly, they have more kinetic energy and, consequently, a higher temperature. In contrast, particles with less kinetic energy have a lower temperature, which is the case for slower-moving particles. Therefore, based on this information, particle A would have a higher temperature compared to particle B, since particle A moves faster and has more kinetic energy."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

As of 2015, the population was 48,210. It is the county seat of Albemarle County, which surrounds the city, though the two are separate legal entities. Charlottesville has eighteen distinctive neighborhoods. It is named after the British Queen Charlotte of Mecklenburg-Strelitz. The Bureau of Economic Analysis combines the City of Charlottesville with the County of Albemarle for statistical purposes, bringing its steadily growing population to approximately 150,000. Charlottesville is the heart of the Charlottesville metropolitan area, which includes Albemarle, Fluvanna, Greene and Nelson counties.  - Bella Morte is a gothic band that was formed in 1996 in Charlottesville, Virginia, USA. They incorporate elements of metal, dark wave, deathrock, alternative and synthpop. The band's name means \\"beautiful death\\" in Italian. According to Andy Deane, the name was chosen to \\"suggest that beauty can be found in tragedy\\", which is a theme occurring in every Bella Morte album.  - Founded in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania in 1993, Metropolis Records has developed a strong reputation over the years as a leader in various genres of underground music. Though widely known for electro-industrial, synthpop, future pop, darkwave, and gothic music, the label has always operated with a bent towards all genres of dark alternative music, be it electronics-based or post-punk.  - Bleed the Grey Sky Black is Bella Morte 's fourth release on Metropolis Records . It reached # 1 on Metropolis ' pre-order sales in September 2006 .  - Dark wave or darkwave is a musical term used for dark, usually gothic rock-influenced music that incorporates synthesizers, or elements of new wave and synthpop, although the term is also applied to post-punk bands that produce a dark atmosphere. The label began to appear in the late 1970s in German music media, coinciding with the popularity of new wave and post-punk. Building on those basic principles, dark wave is used to describe dark, introspective lyrics and an undertone of sorrow for some bands. In the 1980s, a subculture developed primarily in Europe alongside dark wave music, whose members were called \\"wavers\\" or \\"dark wavers\\".  - Synthpop (also known as \\"technopop\\"), a subgenre of new wave music first became prominent in the late 1970s and features the synthesizer as the dominant musical instrument. It was prefigured in the 1960s and early 1970s by the use of synthesizers in progressive rock, electronic, art rock, disco, and particularly the \\"Krautrock\\" of bands like Kraftwerk. It arose as a distinct genre in Japan and the United Kingdom in the post-punk era as part of the new wave movement of the late-1970s to the mid-1980s.  - Electro-industrial is a music genre drawing on EBM and post-industrial that developed in the mid-1980s. While EBM has a minimal structure and clean production, electro-industrial has a deep, complex and layered sound. The style was pioneered by Skinny Puppy, Front Line Assembly, and other groups, either from Canada or the Benelux. In the early 1990s, the style spawned the \\"dark electro\\" genre, and in the mid-/late-1990s, the \\"aggrotech\\" offshoot. The fan base for the style is linked to the rivethead subculture.  - Post-punk (originally \\"new musick\\") is a broad type of rock music that emerged from the punk movement of the 1970s, in which artists departed from punk rock's raw, accessible style to pursue a variety of avant-garde sensibilities. Attempting to break from rock tradition, post-punk artists experimented with sources such as electronic music, black dance music and the avant-garde, as well as novel recording technology and production techniques. The movement also saw the frequent intersection of music with art and politics, as artists incorporated ideas from sources such as modernist literature, critical theory, cinema, and performance art. Accompanying these musical developments were communities that produced independent record labels, visual art, multimedia performances and fanzines in conjunction with the music.  - Deathrock is a subgenre of punk rock incorporating horror elements and spooky atmospherics, that emerged on the West Coast of the United States in the early 1980s.

Please answer the following question: What do apples, pears and oranges all have in common? If you answered that they are all fruits you are absolutely correct. If you answered that they are all good for your health you are spot on again. Fruits used to be a staple in many diets, however in amongst all of the low carb and anti sugar chaos, many people are now avoiding them. In a rush to rid the diet of ‘toxic sugar’, fruit has fallen on the wayside. However, many studies have shown that fruit is not linked to any adverse health effects, quite the opposite in fact. Most recently researchers in Sweden discovered that eating a diet high in fruits could reduce the risk of an often lethal form of aortic aneurysm. The study collected data from over 80,000 people over a 13 year period and found that people eating at least two whole fruits per day, reduced the risk of developing  an abdominal aortic aneurysm by almost a third. The main fruits that were eaten were apples, pears, bananas, oranges and other citrus fruits. The fruits’ high antioxidant levels may offer protection by reducing oxidative stress and inflammation. Eating whole fruits can also reduced the risk of developing diabetes. Earlier this year a study published in the British Medical Journal revealed that certain whole fruits – in particular blueberries, grapes, apples and pears – could lower the risk of developing type 2 diabetes. The study found that over an 18-year period, 6.5% of the 187,382 participants developed diabetes, but those consuming at least two serves of fruit per week reduced their risk by up to 23%. In the same study those who consumed two or more serves of fruit juice per day increased their risk of developing diabetes by as much as 21%. As Tim wrote in a previous blog post, this is reason why you should be eating your fruit, not drinking it According to the above context, choose the correct option to answer the following question.

After the war, the people of Tokyo began to rebuild their city. Buildings went up at a fantastic rate, and between1945 and 1960, the city's population more than doubled. Because of the Olympic Games held in Tokyo in 1964, many new stadiums, parks and hotels were built to treat visitors from all over the world.

Inuit is a plural noun; the singular is Inuk. The Inuit languages are part of the Eskimo-Aleut family. Inuit Sign Language is a critically endangered language isolate spoken in Nunavut.  In the United States and Canada, the term \\"Eskimo\\" was commonly used to describe the Inuit and Alaska's Yupik and Iñupiat peoples. However, \\"Inuit\\" is not accepted as a term for the Yupik, and \\"Eskimo\\" is the only term that includes Yupik, Iñupiat and Inuit. However, aboriginal peoples in Canada and Greenlandic Inuit view \\"Eskimo\\" as pejorative, and \\"Inuit\\" is more commonly used in self-reference for these groups. In Canada, sections 25 and 35 of the Constitution Act of 1982 classified the Inuit as a distinctive group of Aboriginal Canadians who are not included under either the First Nations or the Métis.  The Inuit live throughout most of Northern Canada in the territory of Nunavut, Nunavik in the northern third of Quebec, Nunatsiavut and NunatuKavut in Labrador, and in various parts of the Northwest Territories, particularly around the Arctic Ocean.

Step 2: Analyzing the implied sentiment Brussels sprouts are commonly known to be disliked by many, especially kids, because of their particular taste, which can be bitter for some.

So far my experience has generally shown me that natural, SLS-free shampoos and conditioners do not irritate the scalp as much as their chemical filled cousins, but that they do not always clean the hair as well and can leave it looking and feeling greasy, sad and lifeless. One of the first SLS-free shampoo and conditioners that I tried, back in 2013, was Mild Shampoo and Gentle Conditioner from Naked. The relief that I got from my itchy scalp was almost instant, but I did find that it didn’t remove grease and oil from my hair too well, and I had to wash my hair a lot more often. Since then I’ve tried lots of different SLS-free haircare products, all of which have had their benefits and downfalls. For the past month I have been using Rescue Intensive Care Shampoo & Conditioner from Naked, aimed at frizzy, dry and damaged hair. As I had found such relief from my itchy scalp when using Naked products previously I wanted to try out another variant to see if it cleaned my hair any better. Prior to using the Rescue duo I had been having a really hard time with my scalp, but after just the first use of these natural products the itching had subsided about by 75%. Both the shampoo and conditioner have a lovely rich almond scent which stays on the hair after it is dry. The conditioner is a thick, rich cream and it feels like it is giving dry hair a real treat. Unfortunately these Naked products still don’t clean my hair as well as some other products, and I still feel that my hair can look greasy and lank the day after I’ve washed it. I have tried the ‘reverse poo’ method which helps a bit – this means conditioning your hair first, then shampooing it second – but my hair can get very tangled after the shampooing stage.

On the way there, he is kissed by one of the nine women (Olivia Newton-John).At work, his co-workers lovingly chide him. His tyrannical boss orders him to paint just what he is told and nothing more. He seems beat down, but his next assignment is an album cover ... with the kissing woman on it! He asks around--who is the kissing album-cover woman? A guy behind the desk says she's not on the payroll. The photographer can't explain how she got into the shoot for the album cover--of a hundred pictures, she's in only one. A guy on a porch hasn't seen her (but tries to set Sonny up with one of his daughters). Sonny goes to look for her at the scene of the kiss. He hears a clarinet played by an older gentleman who sits on a rock by the ocean.

Please answer the following question: Write a multi-choice question for the following article: Article: Sports shoes that work out whether their owner has done enough exercise to promise time in front of the television have been devised in the UK. The shoes- named Square Eyes- contain an electronic pressure sensor and a tiny computer chip to record how many steps the wearer has taken in a day. A wireless transmitter   passes the information to a receiver connected to a television, and this decides how much evening viewing time the wearer deserves , based on the day's efforts. The design was inspired by a desire to fight against the rapidly ballooning waistlines among British teenagers, says Gillian Swan, who developed Square Eyes as a final year design project at Brunel University in London, UK. \\"We looked at current issues and childhood overweight really stood out,\\" she says. \\"And I wanted to tackle that with my design.\\" Once a child has used up their daily allowance gained through exercise, the television automatically   switches off. And further time in front of the TV can only be earned through more steps. Swan calculated how exercise should translate to television time using the recommended daily amounts of both. Health experts suggest that a child take 12,000 steps each day and watch no more than two hours of television. So, every 100 steps recorded by the Square Eyes shoes equals exactly one minute of TV time. Existing pedometers  normally clip onto a belt or slip into a pocket and keep count of steps by measuring sudden movement. Swan says these can be easily tricked into recording steps through shaking.

Vi Ripken was able to scare off the man, who was later apprehended by Aberdeen police, by activating the panic alarm on her key fob. She was uninjured, and the man ran away without taking anything, said Lt. Fred Budnick, an Aberdeen police spokesman.      She was approached outside the NBRS branch in the 200 block of W. Bel Air Ave. about 3 p.m., Budnick said.      \\"Detectives are looking at what exactly transpired,\\" he said.      Jesse A. Bowen, 33, of the 800 block of Lafayette St. in Havre de Grace was charged with attempted armed robbery, attempted armed car jacking, possessing a dangerous weapon, first-degree assault and controlled substance related charges in connection with the incident, police said Wednesday morning. Bowen is being held without bail at the Harford County Detention Center.      There was no physical assault and no theft, Budnick said, and employees at the bank called police.      The incident was the second in just over a year involving Vi Ripken in Aberdeen, a community known for its low crime rate.      \\"It's a little unusual,\\" for her to be the victim of two crimes in a relatively short period, Budnick said, adding that Tuesday's incident \\"appears to be a crime of opportunity.\\"      In July 2012, Ripken was taken at gunpoint from her longtime home in Aberdeen, bound and driven around in her car, then released unharmed after about 24 hours. Police have not identified a suspect in that case. In August, the former Orioles great announced a 100,000 reward for information leading to the arrest of the kidnapper.      Earlier this year, Ripken told The Baltimore Sun that her abduction left her worried but that she was determined not to let it ruin her life.      Police said Tuesday's incident does not appear to be related to her kidnapping.      \\"There is no indication he had any involvement in last year's case. And there's no indication he knew who she was,\\" Budnick said. \\"Right now, it appears to be a crime of opportunity rather than a targeted issue.\\"      Detectives investigating the incident thought they were familiar with the suspect from descriptions and were able to put a name with the face and track him down, Budnick said.

Think like you are answering to a five year old. Snow removal is underway at Ronald Reagan National Airport. (AP Photo/Alex Brandon)      It’s not that 17.8 inches of snow wasn’t enough.      But the number that will go down in the history books as Washington’s official total — recorded at Reagan National Airport — is downright paltry compared with some other spots in the region, raising the question: Why the disparity?      The reason, it turns out, may be partly due to the improvised technique used by a small team of weather observers at the airport who lost their snow-measuring device to the elements midway through the blizzard. It was buried by the very snow it was supposed to measure.      The mix-up, some say, may have kept the blizzard of 2016 from breaking into the region’s top three snowstorms on record, based on accumulations. It has also brought into focus the mechanics of how snow depth is counted and has prompted the National Weather Service to announce it will look into the procedures used at the airport.      Mark Richards, senior weather observer at National, stood by the accuracy of the reading Sunday, saying his team did the best it could under tough conditions. But he acknowledged that the team had to abandon the standard measuring process when they lost the tool typically used to tally totals, called a snow board.      “We would like it to be as accurate as possible,” Richards said. “… But it’s an inexact science. Everyone has to understand that measuring snow in a blizzard is a tough thing to do.”      Susan Buchanan, a National Weather Service spokeswoman, said Sunday that the agency would assemble a team Monday to conduct a “comprehensive assessment of how snow measurements are taken” at National and other locations. She said the agency would make suggestions after its review.      [In detail: How much snow fell in the Washington, D.C., region]      The National Weather Service has clear guidelines on how to measure snowfall for one simple reason: Snowstorms have a huge effect on the economy, life and property. They cost millions of dollars. How much snow falls may determine whether additional relief is sent into a location after a major storm.      The timeline of snowfall on Saturday suggests something was askew at National.      At 8 p.m. Saturday, 17.8 inches of snow had been recorded there. Although snow continued to fall until midnight, that was the final measurement that the airport submitted to the National Weather Service.      The measurement reflects a 0.3-inch increase in the three hours between 5 and 8 p.m., during which time light to moderate snowfall was being reported at the airport. It also reflects no additional snow accumulation in the four hours after 8 p.m. Significantly higher preliminary snowfall totals were reported at the region’s two other airports. Dulles International recorded 29.3 inches, while Thurgood Marshall-BWI Airport recorded 29.2 inches. Teams at both of those airports used snow boards.      Still, Richards, who has been monitoring weather at National for 30 years, said the totals were not that far off from areas in nearby Arlington and Alexandria. Near National, a weather observer trained by the National Weather Service reported 19.4 inches one mile northwest of the airport in the Crystal City neighborhood. At the White House, approximately 3.5 miles north, 22 inches were recorded.      Many residents question why Washington’s official weather records are measured at an airport on the river in Virginia, which may not be representative of the weather in the city.      “People use National Airport as the weather centerpiece of the entire region, but it’s the warmest location in the entire region,” said Bob Leffler, a retired National Weather Service climatologist . “It’s just not a good site.”      The blizzard was the snowiest storm on record at BWI, surpassing the 26.8 inches measured on Feb. 16-18, 2003. It was the second-snowiest storm on record at Dulles, coming in just behind Feb. 5-6, 2010, when “Snowmageddon” overtook the region.      [Mr. President, move Washington’s weather observations to the White House]      The National Weather Service requires that snow be measured with a snow board, which can be little more than a piece of plywood painted white. The board should be placed on the ground before the storm starts in a location that will be undisturbed by drifting. When the storm starts, snow should be measured every six hours, and then the board should be swiped clear.      But once the storm got going Friday night, the board was buried and the observer could no longer locate the board. Instead, he took multiple snow depth measurements and averaged them. This is what was reported to the National Weather Service; it wasn’t snowfall, but rather snow depth.      “Snow boards are the standard to use — when you can use them.” Richards said. “Snow boards are just not effective in a storm that has very strong winds its just going to blow off.”      But without the use of a snow board, the measurement is questionable. Jim Lee, the meteorologist in charge at the National Weather Service in Sterling, Va., said he agrees that if the snow hasn’t been measured by the guidelines, the totals are “perishable.”      [Should National remain D.C.’s official weather station?]      Leffler, also the author of the Weather Service snow measurement guidelines, said that depending on the density of the snow, the loss of the snow board may have kept the total 10 or even 20 percent too low. That adjustment would push National’s total past 20 inches.      It also cannot be compared with the region’s other airports.      “I can tell you with 100 percent certainty” that the measurements were performed by the guidelines at Dulles, Lee said. He said he knows this because his office is responsible for those measurements, and they used a snow board and swiped it every six hours.

The storm has stopped, and the cleanup is only beginning — but not without a snowball fight or some sledding first.      The Washington region on Sunday lurched fitfully from under one of the heaviest snowfalls in memory, with federal and local governments set to be closed on Monday, the Metro system prepared to offer severely limited service Monday, and authorities warning that it could take days for the plows to reach some residential streets.      Metro, which records more than 730,000 rail trips on an average weekday, said it would resume service on a fraction of its operations — partial service on three underground rail lines and 22 bus routes — after being shut down for the weekend by the storm.      Virtually all school systems and colleges in the region said they would be closed Monday. The federal government and state and county governments also said they would be closed Monday.      [Live updates on Monday as Washington digs out]      Authorities urged drivers to stay off the roads and pedestrians to stay out of the streets. They said that digging out from a storm that lasted almost 36 hours and delivered more than two feet of snow in some areas will hobble movement well into the workweek.                  In addition to paralyzing the region, the storm brought airplane traffic in and out of the region’s three major airports to a virtual halt. Reagan National and Dulles International airports said late Sunday that their runways had been cleared of snow to allow limited operations to resume Monday, but flights weren’t expected to return to normal for days, causing the U.S. House of Representatives to cancel an abbreviated session that was planned from Monday to Wednesday.      [The full list of what is closed today]      The last of the snow fell in the region around 11:45 p.m. Saturday. Totals ranged from 10 inches to 35 inches and more, with the heaviest accumulation to the north and west of the city, outside the Capital Beltway. The National Zoo in Northwest Washington got 22.4 inches; Hyattsville, in Prince George’s County, got 25 inches; 30 inches fell in Manassas; and Round Hill, in Loudoun County, got three feet.      Maryland Gov. Larry Hogan (R) asked people to be patient, saying that “getting back to business as usual will take time.”      Gregory Johnson of the Maryland State Highway Administration said the state’s primary roadways will be cleared by Monday morning. The secondary roads will still be snow-covered, “with a lot of work to be done.”      “I’m pleased with the progress that we’ve made,” said Hogan, reiterating his appeal for drivers to stay off the roads. “We’ve been lucky with no fatalities. We want to keep it that way.”      Virginia Gov. Terry McAuliffe (D) and the state’s transportation secretary, Aubrey Layne, toured the hardest-hit areas by helicopter Sunday. McAuliffe said Saturday that snow removal cost the commonwealth 2 million to 3 million per hour.      What's the proper technique for shoveling snow? A physical therapist offers specific tips for protecting your back while you dig out this winter. (Jhaan Elker/The Washington Post)      “It’s going to be one of the largest snow-removal efforts that we’ve had in Northern Virginia — one of the most expensive — because some of it’s so high,” Layne said. “It’s a lot of snow. It’s just a heck of a lot of snow.”      [The final snow totoals, in detail]      In the District, police said they would ticket and tow the cars of drivers who venture out and get stuck.      “If you come out, you get yourself stuck on one of our streets, I have to tell you: We will aggressively ticket you, and tow your vehicle,” D.C. Mayor Muriel E. Bowser (D) said Sunday. “We want to have tomorrow to keep cars off the road so we can continue to clear those major arterials.”      Police Chief Cathy L. Lanier said the tickets could cost as much as 750, and she warned that people also could be fined for walking in the street.      “We’re going to have to start stepping up and being a little more aggressive about asking our public not to be out, walking in the streets,” Lanier said.      Metro will open at 7 a.m. with limited service on the Red, Orange and Green lines as follows: The Orange Line will run between the Ballston and Eastern Market stations, the Red Line will run between Medical Center and Union Station, and the Green Line will run between Fort Totten and Anacostia.      Trains will run every 20 to 25 minutes, the agency said. Fares will not be charged.      Buses will run on what Metro is calling “lifeline service” on 22 lines only, from noon to 5 p.m., every half-hour.      D.C. officials said there was no telling precisely how long it will take to clear the snow.      “Two feet of snow is a lot to move,” Chris T. Geldart, director of the District’s Homeland Security and Emergency Management Agency, said Sunday. “We’re going to be in our response phase for at least 24 to 36 hours, and the recovery phase for much longer than that.”      Authorities in Prince George’s County said nearly 80 percent of the county’s main and secondary roads have been plowed.      “For the next 48 to 72 hours we need you to be patient with us,” said County Executive Rushern L. Baker (D). “We need at least 24 hours for us to clear the primary streets and secondary roads before we can get into the neighborhoods.”      The county government will be closed Monday.      “I know people want to get out of your houses and move around, but we need you to stay at home as much as possible,” Baker said.      Alexandria closed its streets to all but emergency vehicles Sunday.      “With about two feet of snow, we have had 50 percent more snow in the past 36 hours than we typically have all winter,” said Mayor Allison Silberberg (D). “The roads are still treacherous, and the roads will melt a bit each day and then refreeze each night.”      Silberberg said Alexandria had cleared virtually all its primary roads by late Sunday and that crews had shifted to secondary roads. She said residential streets would be tackled Monday or later.      Montgomery County officials said crews are focusing on plowing primary roads. After that, they will move into the 4,000 lane-miles of neighborhood roads, county spokesman Patrick Lacefield said.      [The power surprisingly stayed on across most of the region]      “Crews are working around the clock, but we are not just having to plow, we are also having to carry away” loads of snow, Lacefield said.      Where to put the more than two feet of snow that accumulated in many areas was a problem for officials, businesses and homeowners alike. In a lighter snow, plowing it or shoveling it aside is relatively easy, but this was too much snow to be shoved to one side.      “Where are we going to put it all?” Hampton Inn manager Dorene Sapp said as she looked out from her hotel pavilion just off Leesburg Pike. “We are hoping for some melting but at this rate, I don’t know where it’s all going to go.”      Just finding a shovel to dig out cars was a problem at the Sheraton and Hyatt parking lots near Dulles International Airport.      Scott Morris, a Dulles Airport police officer who stayed in a hotel rather than driving home to the Shenandoah Valley, was close to digging his car out after a grueling hour. He brought his own shovel, which another guest offered 250 to buy.      “I said, ‘At this point, pal, there’s not enough money in your pocket to get this from me,’ ” Morris said.      When Ray Atkins’s neighbor, a tax judge, said he was due in court in North Carolina on Monday, the neighbors in the 1500 block of Garfield Street in Arlington went to work.      Shovels deployed, six people cleared the three-foot-deep snow from the driveway and sidewalks so that the judge could get out. But while the judge may be able to leave his driveway now, he’s going nowhere else because the block, just off Wilson Boulevard, is packed deep with snow.      Even before the snowfall began, Ngozi Johnson knew she’d need a strategy to deal with her daughter’s boredom from being stuck indoors. Thinking back to her own childhood — when she and her siblings would fan out across their neighborhood and help people dig out — Johnson went to Lowe’s and bought two shovels. On Sunday afternoon, with the District buried under two feet of snow, she; her daughter, 13-year-old Nandi Johnson; and her daughter’s best friend, 12-year-old Wendell Wray, hit the streets.      “I thought this would probably be the best time to learn the true value of a dollar,” Ngozi Johnson said.      [Where Snowzilla fits among D.C.’s top 10 snowstorms]      Also recognizing a fresh entrepreneurial opportunity, Noel Lemus, Marcio Cruz and Osmin Fuentes were out at 9 a.m. Sunday with snow shovels ready.      “We’ve been doing this for five years,” said Lemus, who said the men worked as electricians but shoveled snow on weekends as a side job.      Lemus said he grew up in El Salvador and then spent 18 years in Southern California before seeing snow for the first time in Washington about six years ago. Asked whether he ever thought he’d be shoveling snow, he shrugged.      “It’s just like the work in my home country,” he said.      But it doesn’t snow in El Salvador, he was reminded.      “No, but shoveling the dirt is the same.”      It was shoveling with a deadline for many people, including Brian Boxman of North Potomac.      He also wanted to be done digging out by 2:59 p.m. so he could get settled in front of his big-screen TV for the AFC Championship match between the New England Patriots and the Denver Broncos. His vision of the game, a beer and maybe nachos, kept the snow flying.      “I’m under pressure,” he said as game time neared.      Meanwhile, the number of people who died as a result of the storm increased.      A Leesburg man had a heart attack and died early Sunday morning while trudging through waist-deep snow in an attempt to go home after working at a convenience store that had stayed open through the storm, police said.      The man, whose identity has not been released, was in his 50s and collapsed around 2 a.m., police said. A resident saw him fall into the snow, called 911 and pulled the man inside a nearby home. Emergency responders were unable to revive him.      “If the gentleman had been walking home on a sunny day, he probably would be alive,” said Leesburg police Lt. Brian Rourke.      The man had tried to drive home after his shift at the convenience store, in the 700 block of Fieldstone Drive NE, but he abandoned his car after it got stuck and tried to walk the rest of the way home, Rourke said.      Virginia authorities have attributed at least four other deaths to storm-related causes, and the storm had claimed at least 19 other fatalities nationwide as of Sunday morning.      Other deaths included traffic fatalities, those from heart attacks while shoveling snow and two hypothermia deaths. One shoveling death was that of a 49-year old man from Abingdon, Md., northeast of Baltimore. ||||| A massive snowstorm descended on Washington, D.C., this weekend. | AP Photo Capitol police officer dies shoveling snow      United States Capitol Police Officer Vernon Alston died of a heart attack on Saturday while he was shoveling snow at his home, according to an email sent to congressional officials by U.S. Capitol Police Chief Kim Dine.

Once you have all the food in your cart, head to the checkout line and wait your turn. 3. When it's your turn, the person working at the cash register will scan all of your food. 4. After they finish scanning, it's time to pay! You'll need to give them your EBT card. It looks like a regular credit card but has some unique numbers on it. 5. The cashier will slide the card through a special machine, and it will ask you to enter a secret number called a PIN. Your grown-up will help you with that. 6. Once you've entered the PIN, the machine will check if you have enough money on your EBT card. If you do, it will take the money off of the card and pay for your groceries. 7. The cashier will then give you a receipt that shows how much money you have left on your EBT card. Make sure to keep the receipt to remember how much you have left to spend next time. And that's it! You've accomplished your goal of using an EBT card at a grocery store to buy delicious and healthy food for your family. Great job!"},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Registration fees for Illinois lawyers could jump as much as 49 a year if lawmakers adopt two separate measures to bolster pro-bono services and support for lawyers with drug and alcohol problems. The Illinois Supreme Court is pushing for legislation that would allow it to dedicate money raised through the fee hikes to legal services to the poor. The justices are floating a 42 increase to shore up financing for pro-bono work, as the normal funding mechanism for legal services has fallen short in recent years. Currently, support for non-profit legal aid groups comes from interest generated on the Lawyers' Trust Fund, which pools clients' money that attorneys hold for such matters as escrow funds. But low interest rates and a sagging economy mean there is less money being generated. After hours of discussion, the high court agreed that raising the registration fees would be the best way to address the declining revenues, Chief Justice Moses W. Harrison II said. The judges were reluctant to raise those fees but eventually decided that supporting probono services was important enough \\"and lawyers had a responsibility to contribute\\" to the cause, Harrison said. Last year, the high court raised the base fee for active attorneys to 180 from 140. Lawyers in their first three years of practice or who are inactive pay 90, and retired lawyers pay nothing. Legislation circulated by the high court's lobbyist specifies that the hike would apply to attorneys \\"paying full annual registration fees.\\" In 2001, there were 57,392 active attorneys in Illinois and 74,311 on the full roll, according to the Attorney Registration and Disciplinary Commission. The hike would raise roughly 2.4 million. Last year, interest on the trust fund totaled 4.5 million, but service and handling fees consumed 538,000 of that amount. This year's returns are projected to be anywhere between 700,000 and 1 million short of that mark, said Ruth Ann Schmitt, the executive director of Lawyers Trust Fund of Illinois. Harrison said the fee hikes are designed only to counter the shortfall in interest income, not add to the total amount available. \\"Our legal services are already stretched to the breaking point,\\" Schmitt said. \\"We have a tough time raising enough money to properly fund services that our clients need.\\" Neither the Illinois State Bar Association nor The Chicago Bar Association has taken a stance on the proposed hikes.  According to the above paragraph, the correct answer to the question \\"As of 2001 , how many attorneys where on full role and how much money would the hike generate?\\" is \\"57,392 on the full roll- 2.6 million raise\\"?","output":"Imagine there is a big group of helper people called lawyers in a place called Illinois. They sometimes need to pay extra money so they can help others who don't have much money, especially when there is not enough money coming from usual sources. So, the top judge and his friends decided to ask the lawyers to pay a little more. In the year 2001, there were 57,392 lawyers who could give this extra money, and if all of them did, they would raise about 2.4 million - that's a lot of money to help others in need! So, the correct answer is \\"57,392 on the full roll - 2.4 million raise\\"."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

All NBA teams have an interesting story or a history behind their names. Some of the names reflect the city's culture or history, others came from previous owners and many were selected through \\"Name the Team\\" contests. For teams like Los Angeles and Utah, the names were not always a reflection of the city. Even though Los Angeles has no lakes, the Laker name has been a city treasure for almost 40 years. Before going to Los Angeles, the team originated in Minneapolis, Minnesota. In 1948, team officials chose the name for its direct relationship to the state's motto, \\"The Land of 10,000 Lakes.\\" The team name went unchanged after moving to Los Angeles in 1960. Because Utah's team originated in New Orleans, Louisiana, it was called the Jazz. In 1974, New Orleans club officials chose the name to represent the city for its reputation as the \\"jazz capital of the world.\\" The name stayed with the team even after finding a new home in Salt Lake City, Utah in 1979. The Chicago Bull's original owner, Richard Klein, named the team the Bulls. He picked the name because a fighting bull is relentless, and never quits. Klein, who founded the club in1966, believed these qualities were necessary for a championship team and hoped his Chicago athletes would live up to the team name. A belief that Bulls----winner of the six NBA championships have definitely followed. In 1967, the Indian Pacers selected their team name in a different way from most other teams.

I have a test where I am given the following article, what is an answer for the question: What is the full name of the representative of the 9th congressional district that includes the city that elected Michael Fong and Shefali Ranganathan as deputy mayors in 2017? ?  Seattle is a charter city, with a mayor–council form of government. From 1911 to 2013, Seattle's nine city councillors were elected at large, rather than by geographic subdivisions. For the 2015 election, this changed to a hybrid system of seven district members and two at-large members as a result of a ballot measure passed on November 5, 2013. The only other elected offices are the city attorney and Municipal Court judges. All city offices are officially non-partisan.Like some other parts of the United States, government and laws are also run by a series of ballot initiatives (allowing citizens to pass or reject laws), referenda (allowing citizens to approve or reject legislation already passed), and propositions (allowing specific government agencies to propose new laws or tax increases directly to the people). Jenny Durkan was elected as mayor in the 2017 mayoral election and took office on November 28, 2017. The mayor's office also includes two deputy mayors, appointed to advise the mayor on policies; As of 2017, the city's deputy mayors are Michael Fong and Shefali Ranganathan.Seattle's political culture is very liberal and progressive for the United States, with over 80% of the population voting for the Democratic Party. All precincts in Seattle voted for Democratic Party candidate Barack Obama in the 2012 presidential election. In partisan elections for the Washington State Legislature and United States Congress, nearly all elections are won by Democrats. Although local elections are nonpartisan, most of the city's elected officials are known to be Democrats. In 1926, Seattle became the first major American city to elect a female mayor, Bertha Knight Landes. It has also elected an openly gay mayor, Ed Murray, and a third-party socialist councillor, Kshama Sawant. For the first time in United States history, an openly gay black woman was elected to public office when Sherry Harris was elected as a Seattle city councillor in 1991. The majority of the city council is female.Federally, Seattle is split...

Please answer the following question: I read this background article the other day: Cancer is a disease that causes cells to divide out of control. Normally, the body has systems that prevent cells from dividing out of control. But in the case of cancer, these systems fail. Cancer is usually caused by mutations. Mutations are random errors in genes. Mutations that lead to cancer usually happen to genes that control the cell cycle. Because of the mutations, abnormal cells divide uncontrollably. This often leads to the development of a tumor. A tumor is a mass of abnormal tissue. As a tumor grows, it may harm normal tissues around it. Anything that can cause cancer is called a carcinogen . Carcinogens may be pathogens, chemicals, or radiation.  I am facing a new situation today: Jason recently learned that he has cancer. After hearing this news, he convinced his wife, Charlotte, to get checked out. After running several tests, the doctors determined Charlotte has no cancer, but she does have high blood pressure. Relieved at this news, Jason was now focused on battling his cancer and fighting as hard as he could to survive.  Using the knowledge I acquired from the background article, how should I answer correctly the following question regarding my new situation: Who has less abnormal cells in their body? Answer:","output":"Based on the information provided in the background article and the new situation, Charlotte has less abnormal cells in her body than Jason. This is because Jason has been diagnosed with cancer, a disease that causes cells to divide out of control due to mutations in genes controlling the cell cycle. These abnormal cells often lead to the development of tumors and damage to healthy tissues. On the other hand, Charlotte has been tested and found to have no cancer, only high blood pressure. While high blood pressure is a health concern, it does not involve the presence of abnormal cells like cancer does. Therefore, Charlotte has fewer abnormal cells in her body compared to Jason."},{"instruction":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

But it’s disturbing in a way that’s thought-provoking, while at the same time giving us an honest tour of one of the world’s most interesting pieces of land. “Breaking Borders” aims to visit places where there is ongoing tension, and see if the universal language of food can at least open a conversation. So host Mariana van Zeller is accompanied by chef Michael Voltaggio, and their first stop is Palestine, where Israelis and Palestinian Arabs coexist with, at best, unease. Much of the show is devoted to a quick tour of the city, noting areas of particular contention. It’s a great summation for viewers who usually find references like “West Bank” simply confusing. We also see Voltaggio hunting through shops and markets to find food that will be acceptable under the dietary laws of both Orthodox Jews and Palestinians. This in itself provides a fascinating sub-tour of the city. It all builds to the dinner, where guests include both Israeli settlers and Palestinians who want Israeli settlers to just get out. Not surprisingly, the conversation has sharp edges, and no one pretends it will end with a group hug and peace in our time. Still, the dialogue is civil enough to be illuminating, not just angry.

Answer the question...where does all the human waste go on a cruise ship??","output":"On a cruise ship, managing human waste is a crucial aspect of ensuring the health and comfort of passengers and crew members, as well as protecting the environment. Human waste, also known as black water, includes sewage and wastewater generated from toilets and urinals. The disposal and treatment of such waste on a cruise ship involve a multi-step process that typically includes the following stages: 1. Collection: Human waste from toilets, urinals, and other sanitary facilities is collected through plumbing systems that lead to dedicated tanks or holding areas. These tanks are specifically designed to store black water temporarily onboard and can be constructed from materials such as stainless steel or advanced composites to prevent corrosion and leaks. 2. Treatment: Cruise ships utilize onboard sewage treatment systems to process black water. These systems can vary, but many ships use advanced wastewater purification technologies that cleanse and purify the waste before it is discharged overboard. Some of the primary methods of treatment may include:    a. Biological Treatment: This process involves the use of aerobic bacteria that break down organic matter in the waste through anoxic and aerobic digestion. Biological treatment may happen in sequential batch reactors, moving bed biofilm reactors, or membrane bioreactors.    b. Chemical Treatment: In some cases, chemicals like chlorine and ozone may be added to the waste to kill harmful pathogens and aid in disinfection. This helps eliminate viruses, bacteria, fungi, and other harmful organisms present in the sewage.    c. Physical Treatment: Physical separation methods, such as sedimentation, coagulation, and filtration processes, are used to remove debris, oils, and solids from the waste. Ultrafiltration, microfiltration, and reverse osmosis are common physical processes employed in treating the wastewater. In some cases, the wastewater goes through multiple processes to ensure it's safe to be discharged into the ocean or reused for non-potable purposes onboard. 3. Discharge: Once treated, the purified wastewater can be safely discharged overboard, adhering to international maritime regulations and environmental guidelines. Cruise ships must primarily discharge black water in accordance with the International Convention for the Prevention of Pollution from Ships (MARPOL) and follow local laws and regulations of the countries they visit. 4. Offloading: In cases where treatment systems are unavailable or not functioning properly, the cruise ship might store the waste in onboard tanks until it arrives at a port. Once at the port, the waste is offloaded and transported to a land-based waste management facility for disposal or further treatment. In conclusion, managing human waste on cruise ships is a complex process that includes storage, treatment, and safe handling while ensuring adherence to environmental regulations and minimizing the impact on marine ecosystems. Modern sewage treatment systems on cruise ships allow for efficient processing and disposal of human waste, significantly reducing the potential for environmental contamination."},{"instruction":"You should describe the task and explain your answer.

Solve this math problem Solve -17*z + 122 + 483 = -72*z for z.","output":"To solve the given linear equation for z, we will first manipulate the equation to isolate z. Given equation: -17*z + 122 + 483 = -72*z Step 1: Combine the constant terms on the left side of the equation. -17*z + (122 + 483) = -72*z -17*z + 605 = -72*z Step 2: Rearrange the terms by adding 72*z to both sides of the equation to get all the z terms on the left side. (-17*z + 72*z) + 605 = -72*z + 72*z (55*z) + 605 = 0 Step 3: Now isolate z by subtracting 605 from both sides of the equation. 55*z = -605 Step 4: Finally, divide both sides by 55 to find the value of z. z = -605 / 55 z = -11 So, the solution to the equation is z = -11."},{"instruction":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

Information:  - The ZX Spectrum is an 8-bit personal home computer released in the United Kingdom in 1982 by Sinclair Research Ltd. It was manufactured in Dundee, Scotland, in the now closed Timex factory.  - 3D Monster Maze is a computer game developed from an idea by J.K.Greye and programmed by Malcolm Evans in 1981 for the Sinclair ZX81 platform with the 16 KB memory expansion. The game was initially released by J. K. Greye Software in early 1982 and re-released later the same year by Evans' own startup, New Generation Software. Rendered using low-resolution character block \\"graphics\\", it was one of the first 3D games for a home computer, and the first game incorporating typical elements of the genre that would later be termed survival horror.  - The IBM System/360 introduced byte-addressable memory with 8-bit bytes, as opposed to bit-addressable or decimal digit-addressable or word-addressable memory, although its general purpose registers were 32 bits wide, and addresses were contained in the lower 24 bits of those addresses. Different models of System/360 had different internal data path widths; the IBM System/360 Model 30 (1965) implemented the 32-bit System/360 architecture, but had an 8 bit native path width, and performed 32-bit arithmetic 8 bits at a time.  - Home computers were a class of microcomputers entering the market in 1977, and becoming common during the 1980s. They were marketed to consumers as affordable and accessible computers that, for the first time, were intended for the use of a single nontechnical user. These computers were a distinct market segment that typically cost much less than business, scientific or engineering-oriented computers of the time such as the IBM PC, and were generally less powerful in terms of memory and expandability. However, a home computer often had better graphics and sound than contemporaneous business computers. Their most common uses were playing video games, but they were also regularly used for word processing, doing homework, and programming.  - Escape is an early ZX Spectrum video game developed and released by New Generation Software in 1982 . \`\` Can you ESCAPE from the monsters ? You must search through the maze to find the axe which will enable you to break down the door and ESCAPE . But it is not that easy - the Triceratops hides behind the hedges and the Pteranodon soars over the maze to swoop down upon you ''  - A video game is an electronic game that involves human or animal interaction with a user interface to generate visual feedback on a video device such as a TV screen or computer monitor. The word \\"video\\" in \\"video game\\" traditionally referred to a raster display device, but as of the 2000s, it implies any type of display device that can produce two- or three-dimensional images. Some theorists categorize video games as an art form, but this designation is controversial.  - New Generation Software was a firm best known for the computer games with innovative graphics it produced for the Sinclair ZX81 and ZX Spectrum computers. It was conceived in the spring of 1982 shortly after the lead developer, Malcolm Evans created \\"3D Monster Maze\\" (initially released by J. K. Greye Software, and later republished by \\"New Generation Software\\")one of the first 3D games for a home computer.  - J.K. Greye Software was a British software company set up by J.K.Greye in early 1981 and 6 months later joined by Malcolm Evans after they met at a Bath Classical Guitar & Lute Society meeting in Bath in 1981.

Revie's replacement at Leeds is Brian Clough (Michael Sheen), the former manager of Derby County and a fierce critic of Leeds, because of their violent and physical style of play under Revie's management. Furthermore, Clough's longtime assistant, Peter Taylor (Timothy Spall), has not joined him. The roots of Clough's conflict with Leeds are depicted as happening in a 1968 FA Cup match between Leeds, the leaders of the First Division[3] and Derby, who were struggling near the bottom of the Second Division. Clough, assuming Revie to be a similar man to himself, as they grew up in the same part of Middlesbrough and both played for Sunderland, made many preparations for the match; come the day of the match however, Revie failed to even acknowledge Clough upon entering the Baseball Ground. Derby eventually lost 2â0.[4] Although Clough initially blames the brutality of the Leeds players, he and Taylor recognise that their side are not good on a technical level. So they sign veteran Dave Mackay (Brian McCardie), along with several other young players. Chairman Sam Longson (Jim Broadbent) is extremely anxious about the investment, as well as the fact that Clough did not consult him before signing Mackay. However, in 1969 Derby are promoted. They once again face Leeds, only to lose 5â0. The club win their first ever League championship in 1972, meaning a European Cup campaign the following year. They go through to the semi-finals against Juventus. Unfortunately, against Longson's advice, Clough uses his best squad in the last match before the semi-final, against Leeds, purely out of pride and determination to beat Revie. They suffer injuries and Billy Bremner (Stephen Graham) sarcastically wishes Clough well for the semi-final. Juventus defeat them 3-1, and Clough publicly lambasts Longson.[5] Taylor then suffers a heart attack, and Clough tries to...
