Дело в том, что, хотя фотограмметрия представляет собой мощный инструмент для сбора данных о поверхности Земли и имеет множество преимуществ, она не может полностью исключить необходимость в традиционных геодезических методах в некоторых ситуациях. Рассмотрим основные причины: # Преимущества фотограмметрии 1. **Быстрота сбора данных и обработки** – Фотограмметрические методы могут быть значительно быстрее традиционных геодезических методов, особенно при работе на больших территориях. 2. **Получение пространственных моделей** – Фотограмметрия позволяет создавать детализированные 3D модели объектов и местности, что особенно полезно для планирования, моделирования и анализа. 3. **Доступ к труднодоступным областям** – С использованием дронов и других воздушных средств фотограмметрия может обеспечить данные по областям, к которым трудно или невозможно получить доступ наземным путем. # Ограничения фотограмметрии и необходимость в традиционных методах 1. **Точность измерений** – В некоторых случаях, особенно для высокоточных инженерных или строительных работ, традиционные геодезические методы (например, нивелирование, тахеометрия) предоставляют более точные результаты, чем фотограмметрия. 2. **Стоимость оборудования и обработки данных** – Высококачественное фотограмметрическое оборудование и ПО для обработки данных могут быть дорогими, что делает их использование менее доступным для небольших проектов или организаций с ограниченным бюджетом. 3. **Подверженность внешним условиям** – Фотограмметрические методы могут быть ограничены погодными условиями и освещением, в то время как некоторые традиционные методы меньше зависят от этих факторов. 4. **Необходимость валидации данных** – Во многих случаях данные, полученные с помощью фотограмметрии, требуют валидации с использованием традиционных геодезических методов, чтобы обеспечить их точность и пригодность для использования. В заключение можно сказать, что фотограмметрия является ценным дополнением к инструментарию геодезических исследований, но не может полностью заменить традиционные методы. Оба подхода часто используются совместно для достижения наилучших результатов в измерениях и исследованиях."},{"instruction":"как сохранить файлы rcp в версии рекапа 2019","output":"Autodesk ReCap, начиная с версии 2019, предоставляет два основных формата файлов проекта: RCP и RCS. RCP является форматом файла проекта, который содержит ссылки на один или несколько файлов сканирования (RCS), а также информацию о настройках проекта и структуре. RCS являются фактическими файлами сканированных точек, которые хранят данные облака точек. Для сохранения файла в формате RCP в Autodesk ReCap 2019, выполните следующие шаги: 1. **Импорт данных облака точек**: Запустите Autodesk ReCap и импортируйте данные облака точек, которые вы хотите использовать в проекте. Это могут быть данные из сканирования, собранные с помощью лазерного сканера, или другие совместимые форматы облаков точек. 2. **Обработка и настройка проекта**: После импорта данных вы можете выполнить различные операции обработки, такие как удаление ненужных объектов, настройку точности и масштаба, а также другие модификации вашего облака точек. 3. **Сохранение проекта в формате RCP**: - Перейдите в меню \\"Файл\\" (File) в верхнем левом углу программы. - Выберите опцию \\"Сохранить как\\" (Save As) или \\"Экспорт\\" (Export), в зависимости от вашей версии ReCap. В некоторых версиях может быть непосредственно опция \\"Сохранить проект\\" (Save Project). - В диалоговом окне сохранения файла выберите место, где вы хотите сохранить файл проекта. - В поле \\"Тип файла\\" (File Type) выберите формат \\"ReCap Project File (*.rcp)\\". - Введите имя файла и нажмите кнопку \\"Сохранить\\" (Save). После выполнения этих шагов ваш проект будет сохранён в формате RCP в указанном месте. Обратите внимание, что проект RCP будет ссылаться на один или несколько файлов RCS, содержащих данные облаков точек, поэтому убедитесь, что вы также сохраняете и эти файлы в безопасном месте вместе с вашим RCP файлом проекта. Если в процессе работы у вас возникнут трудности, обратитесь к официальной документации Autodesk или использовать средства поддержки Autodesk для получения дополнительной помощи."},{"instruction":"Как сделать чтобы файлы из ReCap 2024 подгружались в ревить 2019?","output":"Согласование версий между Autodesk ReCap и Autodesk Revit является важным фактором для успешной интеграции и работы с файлами облака точек. Так как Autodesk Revit не всегда обратно совместим с новыми форматами файлов из более поздних версий других продуктов Autodesk, например, ReCap 2024, существует несколько подходов, которые можно применить для работы с файлами из ReCap 2024 в Revit 2019. # 1. Использование совместимого формата Один из подходов заключается в экспорте файлов облака точек из ReCap в формат, который поддерживается Revit 2019. Обычно это файлы в формате RCP или RCS, которые Revit может интерпретировать как ссылку на облако точек. # Инструкция: 1. **В ReCap 2024**: Экспортируйте ваш проект облака точек в формате RCP или RCS. 2. **В Revit 2019**: - Зайдите во вкладку \\"Вставка\\" (Insert). - Нажмите на \\"Ссылка на облако точек\\" (Link Point Cloud). - Выберите экспортированный файл. Однако, следует быть осторожными, так как прямой экспорт может не всегда гарантировать полную совместимость или наилучшее качество данных, особенно если в более новой версии ReCap были использованы возможности, не поддерживаемые в Revit 2019. # 2. Преобразование формата через стороннее ПО Если прямое совместное использование форматов не работает должным образом, можно попытаться конвертировать файлы с помощью стороннего программного обеспечения или онлайн-сервисов, специализирующихся на работе с облаками точек и 3D-моделями. Необходимо найти инструмент, который выведет данные в формат, пригодный для использования в Revit 2019. # 3. Использование более старой версии ReCap для пересохранения Если у вас есть доступ к более старой версии ReCap, которая совместима с Revit 2019: 1. Откройте файлы из ReCap 2024 в этой версии. 2. Сохраните или экспортируйте проект в формате, который совместим с Revit 2019. # Важно: - Наличие последних обновлений и пакетов улучшения для Revit 2019 может улучшить совместимость с новыми форматами файлов. - Обратите внимание, что иногда прямая совместимость не достижима из-за ограничений в изменениях форматов файлов между версиями продуктов. # Заключение: Лучший способ обеспечить совместимость данных из ReCap 2024 в Revit 2019 — использовать поддерживаемые оба продукта форматы файлов и проверить наличие всех доступных обновлений для Revit, которые могут улучшить совместную работу с более новыми данными."},{"instruction":"Generate an etsy title for a art work that can be added to mugs, painting, tshirt, etc within 140 characters with no & only | to separate without first word being whimsical and is the name of the art coffee in shop with flower","output":"Coffee & Blossom Moments | Artwork for Mugs, Paintings, Shirts | Home and Lifestyle Design"},{"instruction":"As a prompt generator for a generative AI called \\"Midjourney\\", you will create image prompts for the AI to visualize.

Для расчета процентного соотношения ваших лотов к депозиту можно использовать следующую формулу: [ text{Процент лотов от депозита} = left( frac{text{Объем в лотах} times text{Маржа на лот}}{text{Размер депозита}} right) times 100 ] Давайте приведем простой пример. **Предположим, ваш размер депозита составляет 10,000 USD, вы торгуете лотами по EUR/USD, а маржинальные требования равны 1000 USD за лот. Если вы управляете 3 лотами, ваш расчет будет следующим:** 1. Объем в лотах = 3 2. Маржа на лот = 1000 USD 3. Размер депозита = 10,000 USD Исходя из этого: [ text{Процент лотов от депозита} = left( frac{3 times 1000}{10000} right) times 100 = 30% ] Это значит, что ваша текущая позиция в лотах составляет 30% от общего депозита. Обратите внимание, что для точных вычислений следует учитывать текущие курсы валют и возможные изменения в маржинальных требованиях, если вы торгуете в различных инструментах. В MQL5 вы можете автоматизировать эти расчеты, используя функции для получения данных о текущем балансе счета (\`AccountBalance()\`), маржинальных требованиях для открытия позиций (\`MarketInfo()\` с параметром \`MODE_MARGINREQUIRED\`) и объеме существующих позиций (\`PositionSelect()\` и \`PositionGetDouble(POSITION_VOLUME)\` для получения информации по каждой открытой позиции)."},{"instruction":"وقتی یه کانفیگ وایرگارد که داخل Nekobox میسازیم میکنه اما وقتی اون کانفیگو که داخل Nekobox کار میکنه از طریق Nekobox کپی میکنم و وارد v2rayNG میکنیم کار نمیکنه دوست دارم برام یه کاری انجام بدی که اون کافنیگ داخل v2rayNG کار کنه این مشلکو برام برطرف کن","output":"برای حل این مشکل، ابتدا مهم است که توجه داشته باشید WireGuard و V2Ray دو پروتکل متفاوت برای ایجاد اتصالات VPN هستند.

This applies to single-argument constructors or constructors that can be called with a single argument (assuming the rest of the parameters have default values). In the absence of \`explicit\`, C++ allows constructors with a single argument to be invoked implicitly to convert types. This feature can be useful but sometimes leads to unexpected behavior or bugs if the programmer did not intend for such a conversion to happen automatically. Here's an example to illustrate the purpose of \`explicit\`: Without \`explicit\`: \`\`\`cpp class MyClass { public: MyClass(int x) {} // Single argument constructor }; void myFunction(MyClass obj) { // Function doing something with obj } int main() { myFunction(10); // Implicit conversion from int to MyClass return 0; } \`\`\` In this case, the call \`myFunction(10);\` is valid because the compiler can implicitly use \`MyClass(int)\` to convert \`10\` into an instance of \`MyClass\`. With \`explicit\`: \`\`\`cpp class MyClass { public: explicit MyClass(int x) {} // Single argument constructor with explicit keyword }; void myFunction(MyClass obj) { // Function doing something with obj } int main() { myFunction(10); // This line will now cause a compilation error // myFunction(MyClass(10)); // This is now required for conversion. return 0; } \`\`\` Now, the call \`myFunction(10);\` will cause a compilation error because \`MyClass\`'s constructor is marked as \`explicit\`, preventing the implicit conversion. The programmer must now do the conversion explicitly by calling \`MyClass(10)\`. Using \`explicit\` is a good practice when defining constructors that can be called with a single argument to prevent unintended type conversions, thus making the code's intention clearer and preventing potential bugs. It can also be used with C++11's explicit conversion operators to prevent implicit conversions in user-defined type conversion scenarios."},{"instruction":"Ok, thank you. What is the expected usage of noexpect keyword?","output":"The \`noexcept\` keyword in C++ is used to specify whether a function is expected to throw exceptions or not. It serves as a guarantee to the compiler and programmers that a function marked with \`noexcept\` will not exit by throwing an exception. This keyword was introduced in C++11 as part of the effort to provide a more explicit mechanism for handling exceptions and to replace the now-deprecated exception specifications like \`throw()\`. # Expected Usage of \`noexcept\` 1. **Performance Optimization**: Since a \`noexcept\` function promises not to throw any exceptions, compilers can sometimes generate more optimized code by omitting the code that would typically be needed to unwind the stack in case exceptions are thrown. 2. **Move Operations**: In modern C++ (C++11 and later), move constructors and move assignment operators should generally be marked as \`noexcept\`. This is because certain operations, like resizing a \`std::vector\`, may choose to use move semantics for efficient element transfer, but they will only do so if the move operations are \`noexcept\`. If the operations are not marked as \`noexcept\`, these operations may instead fall back to copy semantics for safety, which can be significantly slower. 3. **Safe Exception Handling and API Design**: By marking functions as \`noexcept\`, you are making a clear statement about the behavior of your function with respect to exception safety. This can help in designing safer APIs and in ensuring that exceptions are handled at appropriate levels in the application. # Syntax and Usage - **Using \`noexcept\` without any condition:** Simply appending \`noexcept\` to a function declaration tells the compiler that the function is expected not to throw exceptions. \`\`\`cpp void myFunction() noexcept; \`\`\` - **Using \`noexcept\` with a condition:** It's also possible to conditionally declare a function as \`noexcept\` by providing a boolean expression to the \`noexcept\` keyword. The function is declared as \`noexcept\` only if the expression evaluates to true. \`\`\`cpp void myConditionalNoexceptFunction() noexcept(true); // Always noexcept void myConditionalNoexceptFunction2() noexcept(false); // Not noexcept \`\`\` - **\`noexcept\` Operator:** C++ also provides the \`noexcept\` operator, which can be used to check if an expression is \`noexcept\`. This is particularly useful in templates or in conditional \`noexcept\` specifications. \`\`\`cpp void anotherFunction() noexcept(noexcept(myFunction())); \`\`\` # Key Points - Use \`noexcept\` for functions that are not expected to throw exceptions. This includes most destructors, move constructors, and move assignment operators. - Be cautious when declaring functions as \`noexcept\`. If a \`noexcept\` function does throw an exception, the program will call \`std::terminate()\`, leading to immediate program termination. Hence, only use \`noexcept\` when you are confident that the function will not throw any exceptions. - The \`noexcept\` specifier is part of the function's type, affecting function overloading and template instantiation. Using \`noexcept\` judiciously can lead to more efficient and safer C++ code, especially in critical performance paths and library interfaces."},{"instruction":"mejora la redaccion para hacerla mas entendible: \\"Realizar una búsqueda exhaustiva y crítica de literatura científica sobre la viscosidad de mezclas multicomponentes en crudos pesados, con énfasis en la optimización de diluyentes para crudos venezolanos.

They spoke a language he did not know, yet somehow, he understood them perfectly. \\"You are new to our world,\\" said an elderly woman, her eyes twinkling. \\"You have been reborn here, in the land of Athera. Here, you will discover abilities you never knew you had. Here, you will find a new purpose.\\" Jack was filled with a million questions. Reborn? Abilities? New purpose? But as he looked around at the welcoming faces of the villagers, a feeling of peace settled in his heart. Maybe he didn't need all the answers right now. Maybe, this was his chance to start anew. That night, under the light of the two moons, Jack lay in a bed made of soft moss. As he drifted off to sleep, he realized that while he missed his old world, he was excited to explore this new one. And so, Jack's adventure in the world of Athera began."},{"instruction":"因此本文以新能源LVRT对故障扰动后高压脱网这一场景下，将暂时过电压分为四个将暂时过电压视角下的响应过程划分为四个阶段，分析故障清除电压恢复后新能源的电磁模型各个控制环节控制量与电气量在助增电压方面的影响。用自己的话说一下","output":"本文从新能源LVRT对故障扰动后高压脱网的情景出发，将暂时过电压细分为四个阶段，分析电压恢复后新能源的电磁模型在不同阶段的响应过程。我们将重点关注控制环节与电气量在助增电压方面的影响，以深入探讨新能源在应对暂时过电压情况下的表现。"},{"instruction":"以引言的形式说","output":"在当前环境下，新能源的重要性日益凸显，但新能源系统在面临故障扰动后高压脱网的情况下，暂时过电压的问题也愈发引起人们的关注。本文针对这一问题，将暂时过电压过程划分为不同阶段进行分析，重点研究了电压恢复后新能源在助增电压方面的影响。通过对控制环节与电气量的研究，我们能更好地理解新能源系统在应对暂时过电压时的表现，为未来的发展提供重要参考。"},{"instruction":"把这段话写成本文怎么开展","output":"本文将从新能源LVRT对故障扰动后高压脱网的情景出发，系统地分析暂时过电压在这一场景下的四个阶段，并着重探讨故障清除电压恢复后新能源的电磁模型在助增电压方面的影响。通过对不同阶段下控制环节与电气量的研究，我们旨在深入理解新能源系统在面对暂时过电压时的响应过程，为新能源系统的安全稳定运行提供有益参考。"},{"instruction":"文献[7-8]报道了2011年2月24日、 4 月25日西北酒泉地区发生的几次风电脱网事故，酒泉风电基地位于甘肃河西走廊的西端，当地用电量非常少，绝大部分风电需要输送到1000km外的兰州负荷中心消纳，由于远离负荷中心，电网结构 2 中国电机工程学报 相对薄弱，只能采用高电压集中并网的接入系统方式。甘肃酒泉风电基地一期工程采用330kV电压等级汇集、750kV送出，风电装机容量约5GW。故障前系统的750kV、330kV等关键母线电压均正常，故障始于局部交流短路故障，导致部分不具备低穿能力的风机先脱网，而后引发电网局部电压升高，未脱网风机感受到电压升高后保护动作脱网，进一步加剧电压升高，引起连锁反应。用自己的话写一下综述","output":"文献中报道了2011年西北酒泉地区发生的多起风电脱网事故，这些事故发生在当地电网结构相对薄弱、离负荷中心较远的情况下。酒泉风电基地一期工程采用了330kV电压等级汇集、750kV送出的方式，装机容量约5GW。事故的起因是局部交流短路故障，导致部分风机脱网，引发电网局部电压升高，未脱网风机受到影响后也相继脱网，造成连锁反应。这些事故的发生提示了远距离输送风电存在的挑战，对于风电系统的稳定性和电网运行安全提出了重要问题。"},{"instruction":"For this assignment, then, locate a credible, scholarly source in a different academic database that you'll use for your discussion post this week.

Assume the following article is the chosen source: Citation (MLA): Smith, Johnathan A., and Linda E. Burke. \\"Digital Literacy in the 21st Century: Bridging Theory and Practice.\\" *Journal of Education and Technology*, vol. 56, no. 4, 2022, pp. 215-230. Academic Search Premier. Annotation: In \\"Digital Literacy in the 21st Century: Bridging Theory and Practice,\\" authors Johnathan A. Smith and Linda E. Burke delve into the evolving definition of digital literacy and its critical role in educational curricula worldwide. Smith and Burke argue that traditional literacy alone is no longer sufficient for success in the modern world; instead, a comprehensive approach that integrates digital skills is essential. They support their thesis by examining multiple case studies where digital literacy programs were successfully implemented in school curriculums, demonstrating marked improvements in student engagement and learning outcomes. The information present in this article is directly applicable to the discussion I intend to present, which focuses on the integration of digital literacy in high school education. This source provides a foundational understanding of why digital literacy is imperative in today's educational landscape. It offers empirical evidence and theoretical frameworks that I will use to argue for more substantial digital literacy components in the curriculum. Despite its thorough exploration of the benefits of digital literacy, the article also presents challenges such as access disparities and the potential for technology to distract from traditional learning. In responding to these positions, I will discuss how strategic planning and resource allocation can mitigate these concerns, drawing on additional research and recommendations from Smith and Burke. Personally, this piece resonated with me due to my observations of the technological gap in education within my community. The article reinforced my belief in the necessity of comprehensive digital literacy education and provided a scholarly foundation to support this advocacy. Smith and Burke's article is invaluable, primarily due to the authors' extensive experience in educational technology research. Their blending of theoretical perspectives with practical case study analysis provides a balanced view, making this source highly credible and a substantial contribution to my upcoming discussion on digital literacy."},{"instruction":"Реализовать экран \\"Элементы для игры\\" из архива (html, css). Дополнительные библиотеки использовать запрещено. В игре используются элементы, описанные ниже: 1. Рик или Морти: персонаж, который контролируется игроком. 2. Злые Рики: элементы, от которых необходимо уклоняться игроку. 3. Шкала жизней (HP): шкала, отражающая запас жизненной энергии игрока. 4. Пончик: элемент, при поедании которого у персонажа восстанавливается здоровье. 5. Имя игрока: имя игрока, которое он ввел на стартовом экране. 6. Съедено: количество съеденных пончиков. 7. Возвышенность: элемент, на который можно запрыгивать. 8. Таймер: элемент, отображающий время игры Игра должна начинаться со стартового экрана, который содержит название игры, инструкцию к игре, поле для ввода имени игрока и кнопку \\"Начать\\". Если поле имени пустое, то кнопка «Начать» не активна. Инструкция к игре должна быть представлена анимировано. Также на стартовом экране можно выбрать персонажа для игры. Перед началом игры после нажатия кнопки «Начать» должен проигрываться небольшой мультик – предыстория, который предоставлен в медиафайлах. Должна быть предоставлена возможность пропустить мультик и сразу начать игру при нажатии на пробел. Игровой функционал: 1. По нажатию на кнопку \\"Начать\\" и после просмотра ролика игрок попадает на экран игры с отредактированным фоновым изображением. На игровом экране отображается имя игрока, количество HP, количество съеденных пончиков и время игры. Изначально у игрока 0 съеденных пончиков, 100 HP и таймер в состоянии 00:00 (в формате mm:ss). 2. В начале игры запускается таймер, персонаж располагается в левой стороне игрового поля, что является начальной границей карты. 3. В правой нижней части должна быть кнопка «Выключить звук» 4. При начале игры должно включиться музыкальное оформление. 5. В начале игры случайным образом генерируются возвышенности (не менее 10) 6. Игрок может передвигаться с помощью клавиш английской раскладки: «А» - налево и «D» - направо. Для прыжка используется клавиша «W», а для ухода под землю - клавиша «S». Когда игрок находится в левой половине видимой части экрана, фон не передвигается, а «замирает». Когда игрок доходит до центральной точки, он остается в центральной части экрана, а фон в свою очередь начинает «прокручиваться». При этом, когда фон достигает конца, игрок должен передвигаться в правую часть экрана. При движении справа налево фон прокручивается в обратную сторону. Когда персонаж идет в обратную сторону – персонаж поворачивается. 7. По мере прохождения игры на игрока нападают злые Рики, которые случайно генерируются в видимой части игрового поля и двигаются влево-вправо в пределах 500 пикселей от точки появления. При контакте игрока со злым Рики слышится звук удара. Игра заканчивается, как только игрок доходит до конца карты (пограничной башни) и достигает правого местоположения или происходит смерть персонажа, а таймер останавливается. 8. За каждый съеденный пончик дается 10 HP. 9. За каждое соприкосновение со злым Риком отбирается 20 HP. Если контакт длится больше 2-х секунд, то 20 HP списывается за каждую полную секунду контакта. 10. Если жизни игрока кончаются (0HP), то игра заканчивается. 11. Жизни игрока (HP) расходуются со скоростью 1HP/с при перемещении персонажа. 12. Пончики на карте должны генерироваться случайным образом, одновременно на экране должно быть не более 3 пончиков. Пончики располагаются на возвышенностях. 13. Для того, чтобы достать пончик, персонажу необходимо запрыгнуть на возвышенность, подпрыгнув. Он может находиться на возвышенности неограниченное время. 14. Для того, чтобы увернуться от злого Рика, персонажу необходимо перепрыгнуть его, спрятаться под землю или запрыгнуть на возвышенность. 15. При уходе под землю, персонаж не виден на экране и не может передвигаться влево-вправо. Для того чтобы персонаж появился из-под земли, необходимо нажать клавишу «W». 16. При нажатии на кнопку «ESC» или «Пробел» игра ставится на паузу и появляется диалоговое окно «Пауза» с кнопками «Продолжить» и «Вернуться к началу игры», а при повторном нажатии - снимается с паузы. Во время паузы останавливаются все интерактивные действия, а также вся анимация, таймер тоже замирает, прекращается трата HP, игрок и злые Рики не двигаются. 17. Когда игрок идет обратно, он поворачивается в обратную сторону. 18. Ваша игра должна работать без отображения JavaScript ошибок или сообщений в консоли браузера. 19. Ваш HTML/CSS и JavaScript код должен быть организован и понятен. Используйте корректные наименования переменных, методов и не забывайте оставлять комментарии для дальнейшей поддержки в будущем. 20. После завершения игры результаты должны быть сохранены на сервере и показана таблица с рейтингом. Баллы для рейтинга рассчитываются по формуле: 1000 – затраченное время в секундах + количество съеденных пончиков*10. 21. После завершения игры открывается экран результатов, в котором формируется таблица с лучшими 10 игроками; если игрок не вошел в таблицу, то выводятся 9 лучших игроков, а в последней строке указывается место и результат игрока, только что завершившего игру. 22. На экране результатов должна быть кнопка «Играть сначала», которая позволяет начать игру с начала, на игровом экране (первый экран и ролик не отображаются). При рестарте игры у игрока 100HP, таймер на 00:00, 0 пончиков. 23. В левом верхнем углу необходимо расположить значок «14+» (на стартовой экране) Проявите все свои навыки для создания качественной игры, с анимацией и интерактивностью. Также важен дизайн игры и соответствие целевой группе: 14+.","output":"Реализация такой сложной игры в рамках одного ответа невозможна, но я могу предоставить вам примерный план того, как подойти к быстрой разработке этой игры, а также некоторые полезные фрагменты кода. # 1. Подготовительный этап - **Создайте основную структуру проекта:** Разделите ваш проект на части: HTML-файлы, CSS-файлы, JavaScript-файлы. Отдельно разместите медиафайлы (изображения, звуки). - **Подготовка графики и звуков:** Организуйте все изображения и аудиофайлы в соответствующих папках в вашем проекте. # 2. HTML и CSS - Создайте стартовый экран игры, используя HTML и CSS. Реализуйте форму для ввода имени игрока и кнопку начала игры. Также добавьте инструкции и возможность выбора персонажа. - Разработайте экран игры: отображение HP, счетчика пончиков, имени игрока и таймера. - Создайте паузу и окончания игры экраны с соответствующими функциональными кнопками. # 3. JavaScript Logic - Напишите логику для активации кнопки \\"Начать\\" только в случае, если введено имя игрока. - Реализуйте воспроизведение мультика-интро при старте. Включите возможность пропустить его нажатием на пробел. - Напишите логику игры: перемещение персонажа, генерация врагов и пончиков, обработка столкновений и изменения HP. - Создайте таймер для учета времени игры. - Добавьте функционал кнопки \\"Выключить звук\\". - Реализуйте систему паузы и рестарта игры. # Пример JavaScript кода для старта игры и валидации имени игрока: \`\`\`javascript window.onload = function() { const startButton = document.getElementById(\\"start-button\\"); const playerNameInput = document.getElementById(\\"player-name\\"); // Активация кнопки \\"Начать\\", если введено имя playerNameInput.oninput = function() { let playerName = playerNameInput.value.trim(); startButton.disabled = playerName === \\"\\"; }; // Обработка нажатия на кнопку \\"Начать\\" startButton.onclick = function() { let playerName = playerNameInput.value.trim(); if (playerName !== \\"\\") { // Здесь код для перехода к интро или началу игры startGame(playerName); } }; }; function startGame(playerName) { // Отображение экрана интро или переход к игре console.log(\`Игра началась для игрока: {playerName}\`); // Логика начала игры... } \`\`\` # Дальнейшие шаги: - Далее вам нужно будет реализовать оставшуюся логику игры, следуя инструкциям в вашем вопросе. Это включает обработку ввода пользователя для управления персонажем, создание врагов, логику жизней, таймер игры и так далее. - Для поддержания структуры кода разбейте его на модули, используя функции для каждого действия (например, \`moveCharacter\`, \`generateEnemy\`, \`eatDonut\`, \`gameOver\`, и т.д.).

[쯧쯧.] 나는 고개를 도리도리 저었다. 감독이 내 모습을 흐뭇하게 바라보는 게 느껴졌다. 파마머리 조연출이 잽싸게 끼어들었다. “감독님, 대사 한번 해보라고 할까요?” “응, 그래. 네가 한번 애들한테 대사 던져줘 봐.” “네.” 조연출은 먼저 나에게로 와서 건성으로 물었다. “아빠 해봐.” “아. 빠!” 나는 단번에 그 단어를 뱉었다. 악센트도 적당히 섞어서. 감독의 감탄이 여기까지 들렸다. “성국이 자알하네!” 파마머리 조연출은 진심으로 당황하는 게 보였다. “저, 감독님. 실수일지 모르니까 다시 한번 해볼게요.” “그래.” 조연출의 이마에는 이미 식은땀이 흐르고 있었다. “자, 다시 한번 해보자. 방금 뭐라고 했지?” 조연출은 아빠라는 단어를 일부러 빼고, 나를 채근했다. 이런 거에 흔들릴 내가 아니다. “아. 빠!” 이번에 더 담담하고 대범하게 아빠를 외쳤다. “하하하. 성국이 진짜 잘하네. 오케이!” 감독은 손뼉을 치며 좋아했고, 다른 스태프들 모두 숨을 죽였다. 모두 명품 백을 든 여자의 눈치를 보는 것 같았다. 감독은 조연출을 쳐다봤다. “성국이는 됐으니까, 저기 가서 해봐. 근데 얘 어머니는 누구세요?” “전데요. 이분은 보모세요.” 명품 백 든 여자가 나섰다. “두 분 중 한 분은 나가세요. 애가 도대체 집중을 못 하잖아요.” “애 아니고요. 재희요. 이재희요.” “아, 네. 이재희 어머니. 애가 보모분에게 너무 기어가니까, 두 분은 중 한 분은 나가세요.” 명품 백 여자가 눈짓을 하자 중년의 여자가 밖으로 나갔다. 하지만 이건 실수였다. 스튜디오의 문이 닫히자마자 재희는 울어재끼기 시작했다. “으아아앙. 으앙. 으아아앙!” “어머, 얘가 잘하다 왜 이래.” 명품 백을 든 여자는 오늘 처음으로 명품 백을 의자에 놓고 재희를 안았지만, 재희는 더 크게 울 뿐이었다. “으아앙. 으아아앙!” 감독은 얼굴을 손으로 벅벅 문질렀다. “애가 엄마가 누군 줄도 모르네. 그러니 아빠는 당연히 못 하지.” 당황한 조연출이 얼른 재희에게 다가갔다. “감독님, 대사 해볼게요.” “그래, 해봐라. 해봐.” 조연출은 재희를 달래느라 우스꽝스러운 표정까지 지었다. “우르르 까꿍. 재희야, 아빠 해보자. 아빠.” “으아아앙!” 재희는 더 크게 울 뿐이었다. “됐어. 그만해.” 감독이 소리를 질렀지만, 조연출은 마치 주문을 걸듯이 중얼거렸다. “재희야, 아빠. 아빠. 아빠.” “아….” 그제야 재희는 겨우 한 마디를 내뱉었다. “감독님, 아빠라고 했어요.” “됐어. 끝났어.” 감독은 화난 얼굴로 스튜디오 문을 박차고 나갔다. 드디어 내가 된 건가. 나는 징징 짜는 재희를 보며 짧은 두 손가락으로 승리의 V 자를 그렸다. * * * “죄송하게 됐습니다.” 얼굴이 빨개진 감독이 화를 참지 못하고 대기실 안을 바쁘게 오갔다. 엄마는 애잔한 눈빛으로 나를 쳐다봤다. 태어난 지 14개월 만에, 나는 처음으로 인생의 쓴맛을 보고 있었다. “이미 내정된 애였는데, 오디션은 뭐 하러 본 거야. 아, 씨X.” 감독은 욕을 하다 말고 무안한 얼굴로 나를 봤다. “성국아, 미안하다. 아저씨가 화가 많이 났어. 세상 더러운데, 이게 세상이더라고.” 나는 겸허히 받아들였다. 감독의 말대로 세상 더러운데, 그게 세상이다. 회귀 전에 내가 수없이 누군가에게 했던 짓이었다. 유력 정치인의 자식이라 직원으로 채용하고 승진시켜 주고 이런 거 눈감아준 게 한두 번이 아니었다. 그로 인해 지금의 나처럼 돈 없고 백 없는 어떤 이는 분명 불이익을 받았다. 감독은 별안간 멈춰 서더니 엄마를 쳐다봤다. “어머니, 연락처 좀 주세요.” “그건… 왜요?” “다른 광고에 일 있으면 성국이 추천할게요. 아이들 찾는 광고는 언제나 있거든요.” “아니에요. 경험 삼아 한번 와봤어요.” [사양은 이럴 때 하는 게 아니야!] 나는 옹알거렸다. 감독은 귀여워 죽겠다는 눈으로 나를 봤다. “우선 일주일 후에 촬영 있을 건데, 그때 또 나와주셔야 해요.” “왜요?” 엄마는 영문을 알 수 없는 얼굴로 물었다. “아기 모델의 경우에 보통 한두 명 정도 후보 모델을 준비하거든요. 아기 모델들이 워낙 변수가 많아서요. 갑자기 아프기도 하고, 잘하다가 말문이 막히기도 하고 그래서요.” “아, 또 와야 하는군요.” 엄마는 영 반갑지 않은 반응이었다. 감독은 얼른 덧붙였다. “오늘 오신 것도 경리부에서 조촐하게 비용 처리해드릴 거예요. 다음 주에 오시면 모델료만큼은 아니지만, 그래도 좀 비용이 나갈 거예요.” 엄마는 호박이가 든 아랫배를 가만히 만지며 나를 쳐다봤다. “성국이가 안 힘들려나….” [새로 태어난 지 얼마 안 된 장기들을 탑재한 내가 힘들 일이 뭐가 있어! 어서 한다고 해! 어서!] “이 녀석, 꼭 엄마랑 대화하는 것 같네요. 완전 카메라 체질인데, 진짜 제가 다른 광고 회사에도 추천할게요. 여기 본부장이 저 집안에 뭘 단단히 처먹었나 봐요. 미리 알았으면 저도 안 하는 건데… 성국이 어머님, 연락처 꼭 남겨주세요.” “네, 그럴게요.” “그리고 진짜 다음 주에 꼭 나오세요.” “네.” 엄마는 고개를 끄덕였다. * * * 경리 부서는 오디션장과 한 층 아래인 2층에 있었다. 엄마는 나를 안고 문을 배꼼 열고 들어갔다. 그리고 지나가는 슈트를 입은 여자를 붙잡고 물었다. “저, 오늘 오디션 본 아기인데요.” “교통비 받으시려고요?” “네.” “김 과장. 여기 교통비 드려.” 여자는 구석 자리에 앉은 여자에게 소리를 쳤다. 동시에 자리에서 일어난 건 바로 우리의 집주인인 단발머리였다. 단발머리는 봉투 하나와 서류를 들고 우리에게 다가왔다. 엄마는 급히 반색을 했다. “언니.” “나가요. 음료수 살게요.” 단발머리는 주위를 살피며 소곤거렸다. 엄마도 얼른 고개만 까딱하고 나를 안고 나갔다. 또르르. 캔 음료가 자판기에서 굴러떨어졌다. 단발머리가 시원한 캔 음료와 봉투를 내밀었다. “교통비로 5만 원 지급돼요.” “5만 원이나요?” “택시비 빼면 얼마 남지도 않잖아요.” “언니, 저희 버스 타고 왔어요.” 엄마는 속도 좋게 배시시 웃었다. “애 가진 여자가 갓 돌 지난 아기까지 안고 버스 타고 여기까지 왔어요?” “버스는 자주 타서 그런지 배 속의 호박이도 그렇고 성국이도 모두 괜찮았어요.” [나는 멀미했다고!] 단발머리는 고개를 가로젓더니 음료수 캔을 들고만 있는 엄마를 쳐다봤다. “안 마셔요?” “지금 마시면 가는 길에 화장실 가고 싶을 것 같아서요. 집에 가서 마시려고요.” “그래요, 그럼.” “언니, 다음 주 촬영 때요. 우리 성국이, 후보 모델로 나오라는데요. 그러면 얼마나 줘요?” “촬영 모델은 아니니까. 그래도 한 교통비 조로 20만 원 나올 거예요.” “그렇게나 많이요?” “이것만 됐어도 적어도 300은 벌었을 텐데, 아쉽네요. 삼전 전자 광고료는 업계에서도 가장 좋거든요.” [300이라….] 물론 내게는 전혀 큰돈이 아니지만, 엄마에게는 무척이나 큰돈일 게 분명했다. 아빠의 반년 치 월급이었다. 그제야 엄마는 아쉬운 표정을 지었다. “우리 성국이가 걔보다 더 잘했는데….” 그 표정을 단발머리가 단번에 알아챘다. “오늘 된 애가 덕풍 제지 손자라고 하더라고요. 저희 회사가 덕풍 제지 광고도 하거든요. 그거 무시 못 하잖아요.” [덕풍 제지? 그 코딱지만 한 중소기업?] 나는 어이가 없어서 콧방귀마저 나오지 않았다. 그런 하찮은 중소기업 놈한테 지다니! 더 화가 부글부글 끓었다. 이때, 지나가던 중년의 남자가 단발머리를 쳐다봤다. “김 과장, 근무시간에 왜 여기 있어?” “죄송합니다. 곧 들어가요.” “에이, 저러니 만년 과장이지.” 남자의 말에 엄마는 음료수를 가방에 밀어 넣고는 단발머리에게 인사를 했다. “언니, 어서 들어가요. 저 가볼게요.” “네.” 단발머리는 조금 붉어진 얼굴을 숨기며 다시 경리부로 들어갔다. * * * “여기 앉으세요.” “감사합니다.” 건장해 보이는 학생의 양보로 엄마는 만원 버스에서 자리를 잡았다. 엄마는 자리에 앉자마자 창문을 살짝 열었다. 그리고 내 엉덩이를 도닥였다. “성국아, 택시보다 더 좋다. 이 큰 버스가 우리 집 앞까지 가잖아.” [이런 걸 근본 없는 낙천주의라고 하는 건가. 난 가난해본 적 없어 모르겠는데.] “성국아, 우리 들어가는 길에 치킨 사가자.” [그건 엄마가 먹고 싶은 거고. 난 아직 치아도 제대로 안 나서 치킨 못 뜯는다고 몇 번을 말해.] “참, 우리 성국이는 바나나 사줘야지.” [그래, 그걸로 만족하지. 오디션도 떨어졌으니….] 나는 하품을 늘어지게 하고 눈을 스르륵 감았다. 회귀 전에는 대중교통이라는 것을 단 한 번도 이용해본 적이 없었다. 내 전용 자동차는 대한민국에 한 대밖에 없는 방탄유리로 제작된 고급 자동차였다. 전용 기사 역시 20년 경력의 베테랑이었다. 코너를 돌 때 손에 든 커피조차 흔들리지 않았었는데…. 근데, 이 덜컹거리는 버스에서 잠이 쏟아지다니…. 내가 말이야… 대한민국 재계의 카리스마 전성국이 말이야…. * * * 눈을 떴을 때는 이미 이불 속이었다. 옆으로 엄마가 사온 치킨과 바나나가 보였다. 막 샤워를 마친 아빠가 나오자 엄마가 작은 상을 펴고는 치킨을 올렸다. 어느새 아빠도 퇴근을 하고 온 모양이었다. “자기야, 우리 성국이가 오늘 5만 원이나 벌었어.” “우리 성국이 대견한데. 근데 프라이드치킨이야? 자기 양념치킨 좋아하잖아. 그거 사지.” “오늘은 시장표 치킨 먹고 싶었어. 그리고 이거.” 엄마는 아빠에게 단발머리가 뽑아준 음료수를 내밀었다. “자기 좋아하는 포도 셰이커.” “이것도 샀어?” “나 오늘 돈 좀 썼지.” [저러려고 음료수 챙겼구만.] 엄마는 행복한 표정을 지었다. “소영아, 너 마실 거는?” “나는 임신 중이잖아. 물이면 족해.” “이거 나눠 마시자.” [그래, 콩 한쪽도 나눠 먹어라. 실컷.] 나는 살짝 몸을 뒤척였다. 그러자 엄마가 얼른 나를 살폈다. “성국아, 깼어?” 깨긴 했는데, 다시 미친 듯이 졸음이 쏟아졌다. 나는 다시 눈을 끔뻑거렸다. “소영아, 내가 성국이 재울게. 어서 치킨 먹어.” “자기 피곤하잖아.” “오늘은 니가 더 피곤하지. 임신한 몸으로 이태원까지 갔다 왔잖아. 어서 먹어.” “알았어. 오늘만 내가 먼저 먹을게.” 아빠가 다가와서 내 배를 도닥였다. 막 샤워를 마친 아빠에게서 기분 좋은 비누 냄새가 났다. 아빠는 행복한 얼굴로 나를 내려다보며 속삭였다. “우리 성국이 오늘 큰일 했어.” [앞으로 더 큰 일 할 테니, 놀라지나 마라.] “으아함!” 나는 마지막으로 입이 찢어지게 하품을 하고 눈을 감았다. * * * 작은 봉고가 도착한 곳은 산속에 위치한 스튜디오였다. 봉고가 도착하자 문이 열리며 스태프들이 줄줄이 내렸다. 저번의 파마머리 조연출이 우리를 알아보고는 다가왔다. “후보 모델은 대기실에서 기다리시면 돼요. 호출 없으면 이따 5시에 나가는 봉고 타고 가시면 됩니다.” “아, 네.” “참, 오늘 오신 비용은 회사 도착하시면 경리부에서 받아 가세요.” “네.” 엄마는 연신 네만 하고 대기실로 들어갔다. 대기실에는 이미 도착해서 촬영 준비 중인 덕풍 제지 손자 재희가 있었다. 재희는 오늘도 여전히 멍청해 보였다. 재희의 엄마는 우리 엄마를 위아래로 보더니 귀찮은 듯 손가락으로 지시했다. “재희가 오늘 예민해요. 신경 안 쓰이게 구석에 있어요.” [저게 지금 어따 대고 지시야?]","output":"Episode 5 The final audition had a somewhat unique structure. It involved placing my baby and the luxury bag lady's baby on the studio floor and seeing how well they could speak and adapt to the filming environment while the camera was rolling. This was the first real competition I faced in this life! Fortunately, it seemed the director was indifferent to this mock-up, so I had to somehow catch the director's eye. With a serious face, the director looked at the screen and shouted. \\"Okay, start!\\" The camera began to roll. I naturally crawled around the studio floor, grinning. Of course, I made sure to crawl in a way that would look best on camera. In contrast, the luxury bag lady's child crawled towards a middle-aged woman, already full of irritation on his face. [Tsk, tsk.] I shook my head in disapproval. I could feel the director looking at me with satisfaction. The assistant director with permed hair quickly intervened. \\"Director, shall we have them try saying a line?\\" \\"Yes, go ahead. Throw a line to the kids.\\" \\"Okay.\\" The assistant director first came to me and asked half-heartedly. \\"Say 'Daddy.'\\" \\"Da. Ddy!\\" I blurted out the word in one go, mixing in the right accent. The director's admiration reached me. \\"Sung-guk is doing really well!\\" The permed hair assistant director looked genuinely flustered. \\"Uh, Director. It might have been a mistake, so let's try one more time.\\" \\"Okay.\\" Sweat was already running down the assistant director's forehead. \\"Let's try again. What did you just say?\\" The assistant director deliberately left out the word 'Daddy' and urged me on. I'm not one to be shaken by such things. \\"Da. Ddy!\\" This time, I called out 'Daddy' even more calmly and boldly. \\"Hahaha. Sung-guk is really good at this. Okay!\\" The director clapped his hands in delight, and all the other staff held their breath. It seemed like everyone was watching the luxury bag lady's reaction. The director looked at the assistant director. \\"Sung-guk is fine, so go try over there. But who is this child's mother?\\" \\"It's me. This lady is the nanny.\\" The luxury bag lady stepped forward. \\"One of you should leave. The child can't concentrate at all.\\" \\"It's not a child, it's Jae-hee. Lee Jae-hee.\\" \\"Ah, yes. Lee Jae-hee's mother. Since the child keeps crawling to the nanny, one of you should leave.\\" At the luxury bag lady's signal, the middle-aged woman left. But this was a mistake. As soon as the studio door closed, Jae-hee began to cry. \\"Waaah. Waaah. Waaah!\\" \\"Oh my, why is he acting like this now?\\" For the first time today, the luxury bag lady put down her luxury bag on a chair and picked up Jae-hee, but he only cried louder. \\"Waaah. Waaah!\\" The director rubbed his face with his hands. \\"The child doesn't even know who his mother is. No wonder he can't say 'Daddy.'\\" The flustered assistant director quickly approached Jae-hee. \\"Director, let's try saying a line.\\" \\"Go ahead, try.\\" The assistant director made a ridiculous face to soothe Jae-hee. \\"Boo boo peekaboo. Jae-hee, say 'Daddy.' Daddy.\\" \\"Waaah!\\" Jae-hee only cried louder. \\"That's enough. Stop.\\" The director yelled, but the assistant director muttered as if casting a spell. \\"Jae-hee, Daddy. Daddy. Daddy.\\" \\"Ah...\\" Finally, Jae-hee barely uttered a word. \\"Director, he said 'Daddy.'\\" \\"That's enough. It's over.\\" The director stormed out of the studio with an angry face. Did I finally make it? I looked at the whining Jae-hee and made a victory V sign with my short fingers. * * * \\"I'm sorry about this.\\" The director, his face red, couldn't contain his anger and paced back and forth in the waiting room. My mother looked at me with a pitiful gaze. At 14 months old, I was tasting the bitterness of life for the first time. \\"We had already decided on the child, so what was the point of the audition? Ah, shit.\\" The director cursed and then looked at me with an embarrassed face. \\"Sung-guk, I'm sorry. I'm really angry. The world is filthy, and that's just how it is.\\" I humbly accepted it. As the director said, the world is filthy, and that's just how it is. Before my regression, I had done countless things to others. Hiring and promoting the child of a powerful politician, turning a blind eye to such things wasn't rare. Because of that, someone like me now, without money or backing, definitely suffered disadvantages. Suddenly, the director stopped and looked at my mother. \\"Mother, please give me your contact information.\\" \\"Why?\\" \\"If there's another commercial, I'll recommend Sung-guk. There's always a demand for child models.\\" \\"No, thank you. We just came for the experience.\\" [You shouldn't refuse in situations like this!] I babbled. The director looked at me with eyes full of adoration. \\"Anyway, there's a shoot next week, and you'll have to come again.\\" \\"Why?\\" My mother asked, not understanding the situation. \\"In the case of baby models, we usually prepare one or two backup models. Baby models are so unpredictable. They can suddenly get sick, or even if they're doing well, they might suddenly stop talking, so...\\" \\"Oh, we have to come again.\\" My mother didn't seem too pleased. The director quickly added. \\"Even coming today will be modestly compensated by the accounting department. If you come next week, it won't be as much as the model fee, but there will still be some compensation.\\" My mother gently touched her pregnant belly and looked at me. \\"I wonder if Sung-guk will be okay...\\" [With these newly born organs, what could possibly tire me out! Hurry up and agree! Hurry!] \\"This kid, he really seems like he's talking with his mom. He's totally camera material, I'll recommend him to other advertising agencies too. Here, the director must have been fed something solid by that family. If I had known, I wouldn't have done it... Sung-guk's mom, please leave your contact information.\\" \\"Okay, I will.\\" \\"And really, make sure to come next week.\\" \\"Okay.\\" My mother nodded. * * * The accounting department was located one floor below the audition room, on the second floor. My mother, holding me, slightly opened the door and entered. She then stopped a woman in a suit passing by and asked. \\"We're here for the baby audition today.\\" \\"Are you here to receive the transportation fee?\\" \\"Yes.\\" \\"Manager Kim. Give them the transportation fee here.\\" The woman shouted towards a woman sitting in the corner. At the same time, the woman who stood up was our landlord with short hair. The short-haired landlord approached us with an envelope and some documents. My mother quickly brightened up. \\"Sister.\\" \\"Let's go out. I'll buy you a drink.\\" The short-haired landlord whispered, glancing around. My mother quickly nodded and left with me in her arms. The can of drink rolled out of the vending machine. The short-haired landlord handed me the cool can of drink and the envelope. \\"You'll receive 50,000 won for transportation.\\" \\"50,000 won?\\" \\"Subtracting the taxi fare, it's not much left.\\" \\"Sister, we took the bus here.\\" My mother smiled slyly. \\"You mean to tell me a pregnant woman with a baby just over a year old took the bus all the way here?\\" \\"We take the bus often, so both the baby in my belly and Sung-guk were fine.\\" [I got motion sickness!] The short-haired landlord shook her head and then looked at my mother, who was still holding the can of drink. \\"Aren't you going to drink it?\\" \\"I'll drink it on the way home. I might need to use the bathroom if I drink it now.\\" \\"Alright, then.\\" \\"Sister, about next week's shoot. They said Sung-guk should come as a backup model. How much will they pay?\\" \\"Since he's not the main model, it'll be about 200,000 won for transportation.\\" \\"That much?\\" \\"If he had been the main model, he would have earned at least 300,000 won. Samsung Electronics' commercial fees are the best in the industry.\\" [300,000 won...] Of course, it wasn't a lot of money to me, but it was certainly a significant amount for my mother. It was half a year's salary for my father. Only then did my mother show a hint of regret. \\"Sung-guk did better than that kid...\\" The short-haired landlord caught on immediately. \\"I heard today's chosen child is the grandson of Deokpoong Paper. Our company also handles Deokpoong Paper's advertisements. We can't ignore that.\\" [Deokpoong Paper? That tiny mid-sized company?] I was so dumbfounded I couldn't even snort in disdain. To lose to a nobody from such an insignificant mid-sized company! My anger boiled even more. At that moment, a middle-aged man passing by looked at the short-haired landlord. \\"Manager Kim, why are you here during work hours?\\" \\"Sorry, I'll go back in now.\\" \\"See, that's why you're stuck as a manager forever.\\" At the man's words, my mother quickly put the drink in her bag and greeted the short-haired landlord. \\"Sister, go back in. I'll be going now.\\" \\"Okay.\\" The short-haired landlord, her face slightly red, went back into the accounting department. * * * \\"Please, take a seat.\\" \\"Thank you.\\" Thanks to a robust student giving up his seat, my mother found a place to sit on the crowded bus. As soon as she sat down, she slightly opened the window and patted my bottom. \\"Sung-guk, this is even better than a taxi. This big bus takes us right in front of our house.\\" [Is this what they call baseless optimism? I've never been poor, so I wouldn't know.] \\"Sung-guk, let's buy some chicken on our way home.\\" [That's what you want to eat. I can't even chew chicken yet, no matter how many times I tell you.] \\"Right, we should buy some bananas for Sung-guk.\\" [Yeah, settle for that. We failed the audition anyway...] I yawned widely and slowly closed my eyes. I had never used public transportation before my regression. My personal car was the only one in South Korea made with bulletproof glass. My chauffeur was a veteran with 20 years of experience. Even when turning corners, the coffee in my hand never spilled... But to fall asleep on this bumpy bus... Me... The charismatic Jeon Seong-guk of South Korea's business world... * * * When I woke up, I was already in bed. Next to me, there were chicken and bananas that my mother had bought. My father, who had just finished showering, came out, and my mother set up a small table and placed the chicken on it. It seemed my father had also come home from work. \\"Honey, our Sung-guk earned 50,000 won today.\\" \\"Our Sung-guk is admirable. But is it fried chicken? You like seasoned chicken, don't you? You should have bought that.\\" \\"Today, I wanted to eat market-style chicken. And this.\\" My mother handed my father the drink the short-haired landlord had given her. \\"Your favorite grape shake.\\" \\"You bought this too?\\" \\"I spent some money today.\\" [So that's why you kept the drink.] My mother looked happy. \\"So-young, what will you drink?\\" \\"I'm pregnant, so water is enough for me.\\" \\"Let's share this.\\" [Yeah, share even a bean. Enjoy.] I slightly shifted my position. Then, my mother quickly checked on me. \\"Sung-guk, are you awake?\\" I was awake, but an overwhelming sleepiness poured over me again. I blinked my eyes slowly. \\"So-young, I'll put Sung-guk to sleep. You go ahead and eat.\\" \\"You're tired, honey.\\" \\"You're more tired today. You went all the way to Itaewon with a pregnant body. Go ahead and eat.\\" \\"Okay, I'll eat first today.\\" My father approached and patted my belly. He had a pleasant smell of soap after his shower. Looking down at me with a happy face, my father whispered. \\"Our Sung-guk did a great job today.\\" [I'll do even greater things in the future, so don't be surprised.] \\"Yawn!\\" I yawned one last time, stretching my mouth wide, and closed my eyes. * * * The small van arrived at a studio located in the mountains. As the van arrived, the door opened, and the staff filed out. The permed hair assistant director from last time recognized us and approached. \\"Backup models should wait in the waiting room. If there's no call, you can leave on the 5 p.m. van.\\" \\"Ah, okay.\\" \\"Also, you'll receive today's compensation at the company's accounting department when you arrive.\\" \\"Okay.\\" My mother kept saying okay and entered the waiting room. In the waiting room, Jae-hee from Deokpoong Paper, who had already arrived and was preparing for the shoot, was there. Jae-hee still looked as clueless as ever today. Jae-hee's mother looked us up and down and then, annoyed, gestured with her finger. \\"Jae-hee is sensitive today.

[오랜만이야, 선미 누나.] 임선미가 나를 보곤 환하게 미소 지으며 다가왔다. “네가 오늘 모델이구나. 어쩜 이렇게 이쁘게 생겼니.” 임선미가 나를 안아 들려고 하자, 재희 엄마가 몸으로 가로막았다. “걔는 후보고요. 오늘 주인공은 우리 재희라고요.” 재희의 엄마는 두 눈을 멍하게 끔뻑이는 자신의 아들을 임선미에게 내밀었다. 임선미는 재희를 안아 들고는 애써 미소를 지었다. “어머, 너도 예쁘네.” 아버지는 임선미에 대해서 여러 이야기를 해주셨는데, 이런 이야기를 한 적도 있었다. “코 수술을 여러 번 해서 그쪽 만지는 거 엄청 싫어해.” 삼전 그룹의 초대 회장이자 창립주인 전주신. 그 뒤를 이은 게 나의 아버지였던 전재형 회장이었다. 철의 여인 속을 평생 썩인 아버지답게 은퇴하는 그 시점까지 이름난 여배우부터 근본도 알 수 없는 여자들까지 수없이 많은 여자들과 시간을 보냈다. 그중에 임선미도 있었다. 임선미로 말할 것 같으면 10대 후반에서 20대 초반에 전성기를 맞고 그 이후로는 주춤했던 배우다. 하지만 다시 30대 초반에 감성 연기로 각종 영화제에서 상을 받으며 다시 전성기를 맞았다. 물론 그 전성기 뒤에는 아버지 전재형 부회장이 있었다. 내가 이걸 어떻게 다 알까? 아무리 회귀 전이라고 해도 1992년이라면 겨우 열 살이 된 나이인데. 세상 사람들은 재벌 대표가 어떤 사람인지 잘 모른다. 아는 거라고 해봤자 겨우 TV 드라마에 나온 판타지 같은 모습이거나, 희화된 캐릭터일 뿐이다. 아버지 전재형 대표는 삼전 그룹의 경영자로서는 훌륭했다. 위기 때마다 회사를 크게 구조 조정하고, 특성 분야에 대한 투자를 아끼지 않았다. 사원 복지와 연봉도 다른 기업에 비해 월등히 좋아서 10년 연속 일하고 싶은 회사에 꼽히기도 했다. 이런 대외적인 이미지와 달리 아버지와 남자로서 전재형은 쓰레기였다. 내가 아버지와 달리 여자관계에 있어서만은 유독 철벽을 친 이유도 그 때문이다. 아버지는 종종 우리를 앞에 두고도 노골적으로 만나는 연예인들 얘기를 해댔다. “니들 임선미 알지?” “네, 아빠. 선미 누나 진짜 예뻐요.” 그때 나는 TV에 나오는 청초한 이미지의 임선미를 무척 좋아했다. 어린 나이지만 임선미의 광고나 연기를 볼 때면 가슴이 설레기도 했다. “이쁘긴 한데 말이야. 코 수술을 여러 번 해서 그쪽 만지는 거 엄청 싫어해.” “아빠가 그걸 어떻게 아세요?” 나는 순진하게 물었고, 아빠는 알 수 없는 미소를 지으며 나를 봤다. “성국아, 너도 이 아빠 자리에 오르게 되면 다 알 수 있어. 알았지?” “…….” 열 살의 나는 무슨 말인지 알 수 없었지만, 고개를 끄덕였다. * * * 지금 내 눈앞에는 임선미가 재희를 안고 서 있었다. 재희는 조금 짜증이 난 듯 온몸으로 바동거렸다. 임선미는 애써 웃고 있었지만, 얼굴을 잔뜩 뒤로 밀고 미간을 찌푸린 채였다. 콧등을 두꺼운 메이크업으로 가린 것을 보니 수술을 한 지 얼마 안 된 모양이다. “오늘 촬영은 나랑 친해져야 하는데. 애가 낯을 가리나 봐요, 어머님.” “촬영장이 낯설어서 그럴 거예요. 제가 좀 달래볼게요.” 그 말이 떨어지자마자 보모가 일어나서 재희를 안았다. 그제야 재희는 진정됐지만, 여전히 얼굴엔 불만이 가득해 보였다. 나는 어떻게 재희가 임선미의 코를 한 대 팍 쳐버릴 수 있을지 고심에 들어갔다. [말귀가 통하는 놈은 아닐 거고….] 똑. 똑. 대기실 문이 열리면서 익숙한 얼굴이 고개를 들이밀었다. 바로 양 비서였다. 나를 모시던 양 비서의 아버지 양 비서. 양 비서 집안은 할아버지 때부터 우리 집안의 자질구레한 대소사를 정리하는 역할을 해왔다. 특히 양 비서 아저씨는 나를 무척이나 귀여워해 주셨다. 나는 반가운 마음에 소리쳤다. [양 비서 아저씨! 저예요!] 양 비서 아저씨는 나를 얼핏 보더니 미소를 지었다. “아기가 낯도 안 가리고 잘 웃네요.” “저희 애가 좀 순해요.” 엄마는 감사하다며 고개까지 숙였다. 잠깐, 양 비서 아저씨가 왔다는 것은 아버지가 움직인다는 의미인데? 나는 열린 문틈으로 서 있는 사람을 단번에 확인했다. 큰 키에 늘 단정한 옷차림. 2 대 8 가르마로 단정히 빗어 넘긴 머리. 중년의 나이에도 뱃살 하나 없었고, 자세는 꼿꼿했다. 바로 나의 아버지 전재형이었다. [아버지! 아버지!] 나는 한 손으로 몸을 지탱하며 손까지 흔들었다. 엄마가 나를 얼른 안아 들었다. “성국아, 사람들 많으니까 좋지? 앞으로 엄마가 자주 데리고 나올게.” [하아. 이게 아닌데….] 지금 나의 외침과 몸짓은 이들에게 그저 재롱일 뿐이다. 양 비서 아저씨는 임선미에게 뭐라고 말하더니 같이 대기실이 빠져나갔다. [오늘이 그날이구나….] 내가 임선미를 좋아한단 사실을 알고 아버지가 임선미의 광고 촬영장에 나를 데리고 간 적이 있었다. 아버지는 나를 임선미에게 소개해줬다. 임선미는 내 뺨을 몇 번 손으로 어루만져 주고는 아버지와 사라져서 잠시 후에 화장이 지워진 얼굴로 나타났다. 그사이 나는 촬영장에서 양 비서 아저씨와 공놀이를 하며 시간을 보냈다. 곧 대기실 문이 열리더니 파마머리 조연출이 난처한 얼굴로 들어왔다. “사모님, 촬영이 조금 지연될 것 같습니다.” “우리 재희 곧 밥 먹고 잠들 시간인데, 그 시간 맞춰 준다면서요?” “죄송합니다. 그게, 임선미 씨가 약간 컨디션이 안 좋아서요.” [어디서 거짓말을….] 임선미는 아버지의 차 뒷좌석에서 한창 바쁠 때였다. 아버지가 좀 급하시니까 길지는 않을 것이다. 나는 고개를 절레절레 흔들었다. 중년의 보모가 잠시 재희를 내 옆에 내려놨다. “사모님, 저 화장실 급히 다녀올게요. 재희 좀 봐주세요.” “화장실 다녀오는 시간은 급여에서 까든지 해야지. 어서 다녀와요.” “죄송합니다.” 보모가 화장실에 간 사이에도 사모님은 손가락 하나 까딱하지 않았다. 조연출은 눈치를 보며 슬금슬금 나갔고, 엄마와 나는 어색한 기류 속에서 조용히 앉아 있었다. 내 옆 소파에 앉은 재희는 한눈에도 무기력해 보였다. 말이나 걸어볼까? 비슷한 나이이니 말이 통할지도 모른다. [야, 너 촬영하기 싫지?] 의외로 재빨리 재희가 응답했다. “응애. 응. 응어웅응어웅.” [뭐지? 대충 알아듣겠는데….] 나는 놀란 얼굴로 재희를 쳐다봤다. 재희는 연신 불만을 옹알거렸다. [그래, 어서 다 말해봐!] 요약하자면 조명이 너무 뜨겁고 따가워서 촬영하기 싫다는 거였다. 사람들이 이렇게 해라 저렇게 해라 하는 것도 짜증 난단 말도 했다. 심지어 지금은 배도 고프고 졸리다는 내용이었다. 귀하게 자란 도련님은 이런 일이 귀찮은 모양이었다. 추억이야 다 자란 후에나 생기는 거지, 지금 당장은 이런 먼지 폴폴 날리는 촬영 현장이 싫을 만도 하다. 상대방이 싫어하는 것을 처리해주는 것. 그거야말로 비즈니스 관계에서 신임을 얻는 방법이었다. 나는 임선미의 약점을 그대로 재희에게 알려줬다. [아까 그 누나 코 때려. 그 누나, 코가 약점이야. 아마 한 방이면 너 촬영 안 해도 될 거야.] “응애?” [당연히 진짜지. 걱정 말고 있는 힘껏 때려버려.] “응애.” 재희는 격하게 고개를 끄덕였다. “아이고, 둘이 사이가 좋네. 무슨 이야기를 그렇게 했어?” 돌아온 중년의 보모가 재희를 안아 들었다. * * * “촬영 곧 시작합니다.” 조연출이 헐레벌떡 뛰어와서 소리쳤다. 재희는 준비를 마치고 엄마와 보모를 대동하고 촬영장으로 향했다. 나는 재희에게 마지막 말을 건넸다. [파이팅!] “응애!” 재희는 있는 힘껏 답해줬다. 나는 슬슬 재희가 마음에 들기 시작했다. 부잣집에서 자라서 심기가 뒤틀리는 일은 하기 싫은 게 분명했다. [저런 녀석이 가난한 집에 태어나서 나 대신 개고생 좀 해야 하는데….] 순간 엄마의 손이 훅 들어와서 내 배를 도닥였다. 내가 가장 좋아하는 엄마의 기술이었다. 엄마가 이렇게 손으로 내 배를 도닥이면 근심 걱정이 모두 한순간에 날아가고, 마냥 행복했다. “성국아, 오늘 촬영 못 해도 네 덕분에 엄마도 좋은 구경 하고 정말 좋아. 엄마가 임선미도 봤잖아. 성국아, 엄마가 진짜 많이 사랑해.” 엄마는 내 볼에 뽀뽀를 퍼부었다. 울컥. 이번 생에서는 진짜 감정 조절이 너무 안 됐다. 겨우 사랑해란 말에 울컥하다니. 회귀 전에는 사랑해란 말을 제대로 들어본 적이 없었다. 모두들 나에게 사랑한다는 말보다는 존경한다는 말을 많이 했다. 그때는 그게 좋은 줄 알았다. 나는 엄마에게 손을 내밀었다. 그러자 엄마는 볼록 나온 배 위로 나를 안아 올렸다. “엄마는 우리 성국이가 제일 이쁜 거 같은데… 여기 아저씨들은 아닌가 봐. 그래도 감독님이 여기저기 추천해 주신다고 약속하셨으니까, 우리 또 기회가 있겠지?” [기회는 기다리는 게 아니라 만드는 거야, 엄마.] “그래, 그래. 우리 성국이도 엄마랑 기다리자.” 나는 고개를 도리도리 흔들었다. 그 순간, 대기실 문이 열리더니 파마머리 조연출이 급히 뛰어 들어왔다. “저기요. 준비하세요.” “네?” 엄마가 놀라 되물었다. “촬영 준비하라고요! 말귀도 못 알아들어요?” “우리 성국이가 찍는 거예요?” “아, 그렇다고요.” [이게 어디서 짜증이야?] 아무래도 저 녀석은 기억해둬야 할 것 같았다. 곧 스태프들이 들이닥치더니 나에게 재희가 입었던 내복을 입히고 촬영장으로 안고 뛰어갔다. 임선미가 잔뜩 화난 얼굴로 화장을 고치는 게 보였다. 그 옆으로는 똑같이 화가 난 재희의 엄마가 서 있었다. “아니, 한 번 더 기회를 달라는데 그걸 못 줘요? 네?” 재희의 엄마는 감독에게 따지듯이 묻고 있었다. “지금 벌써 1시간이나 기회를 줬는데 똑같잖아요. 애가 말을 안 듣고, 여자 모델 얼굴을 손으로 퍽퍽 치는데 어쩌라고요? 오늘 안에 촬영 끝내야 해요. 이대로라면 내일도 못 찍는다고요!” “내가 우리 아버님한테 당장 전화 걸 거예요.” “거세요! 나도 안 해, 이 광고!” 감독은 화가 난 얼굴로 버럭 소리를 질렀다. 그 바람에 재희는 울음까지 터트렸고, 촬영장은 난장판이 됐다. 재희의 사모님은 벽돌 사이즈의 핸드폰을 들더니 어디론가 전화를 걸었다. 이때였다. 화장을 고치던 임선미가 저벅저벅 걸어가더니 핸드폰을 빼앗아 들었다. “뭐 하는 짓이야? 모델 주제에.” “지금 우리가 어디 광고 찍는 줄 알지?” “감히 어디서 반말이야?” 재희의 엄마는 독하게 임선미를 몰아붙였다. 하지만 임선미도 만만치 않았다. “네가 반말했으니, 나도 하는 거지. 덕풍 제지 사모님. 사모님으로 대접해줄 때 제대로 했어야지. 애가 말을 더럽게 안 듣는 데다가 재능도 없는데 어쩌자고?” “이게… 야!” 재희 엄마의 손이 올라가자마자 임선미가 재희 엄마의 손을 탁 잡았다. 촬영장은 순식간에 조용해졌다. 나 역시 넋을 놓고 봤다. 임선미는 주위를 한 번 휙 보더니 재희 엄마를 똑똑히 쳐다봤다. “부잣집에 태어나서 시집 잘 가 세상이 만만한가 본데, 여기 그런 곳 아니야. 재능 없으면 찬물이나 마시고 집에 가시지. 이 자리는 재능 있는 사람이 자리를 차지하는 게 맞는 거지. 안 그래?” “이 손 안 놔? 너, 삼전 그룹 부회장 스폰 받는 거 다 알아. 그래서 삼전 전자 전속 모델 하는 거면서. 넌 뭐 그렇게 당당해?” [오호, 사모님도 센데.] 나와 엄마는 손을 꼭 잡고 흥미진진하게 두 여자의 대결을 지켜봤다. “그럼 잘 알겠네. 내 뒤에는 삼전 그룹이 있는데, 겨우 중소기업 며느리 주제에 어디서 깝쳐?” “…….” 나는 하마터면 손뼉까지 칠 뻔했다. 중소기업 며느리 주제에 어디서 깝쳐! 내가 해주고픈 말이었다. 이 광경을 보고 있던 감독과 스태프들 모두 너무 놀라 입조차 뻥끗 못 하고 있었다. 임선미는 재희 엄마의 손을 한 번에 확 뿌리쳤다. 그리고 감독에게 걸어갔다. “감독님, 후보 모델이랑 촬영 시작하죠. 저 내일은 영화 촬영 있어서 시간 안 돼요. 아까 대기실에서 보니까 후보 모델이 훨씬 이쁘고 낯도 안 가리더라고요. 저 아줌마가 뭐라고 하면 제가 삼전 부회장님한테 전화 한 통 할 테니까, 그냥 무시하고 촬영 시작하죠. 어디 돈 좀 먹였나 본데, 삼전 그룹 회장님한테 돈 먹인 거 아닌 이상 내가 다 알아서 해줄게요.” “오케이. 촬영 시작합시다. 성국이 준비됐지?” 감독이 나를 쳐다봤다. 나는 번쩍 손을 들었다. [준비 완료!]","output":"Episode 6 As I babbled on, my mom picked me up. \\"Sung-guk, are you sleepy?\\" It's another way of telling me to stay quiet. Is this what life is like for the weak? Being pushed around in competitions that never work out, receiving unfair treatment, and not even being able to rebel. I sighed. Maybe this was the life I had to get used to in this lifetime. Click. The door opened, and a familiar woman came in with a smile. I recognized her at a glance. Im Seon-mi. She was currently the top actress in South Korea, especially known for her tear-jerking melodramatic performances. And I knew a secret about Im Seon-mi. She was in a sponsorship relationship with Jeon Jae-hyung, the vice chairman of Samjeon Group and my father. I slightly lifted the corners of my mouth as I looked at Im Seon-mi. [Long time no see, Seon-mi noona.] Im Seon-mi smiled brightly as she approached me. \\"You're the model today. How did you get so pretty?\\" As Im Seon-mi tried to pick me up, Jae-hee's mom blocked her with her body. \\"He's just a candidate. The star today is our Jae-hee.\\" Jae-hee's mom pushed her son, who was blinking dumbly, towards Im Seon-mi. Im Seon-mi picked up Jae-hee and forced a smile. \\"Oh, you're pretty too.\\" My father had told me various stories about Im Seon-mi, including this one. \\"She hates it when people touch her nose because she's had several nose surgeries.\\" Jeon Ju-shin, the founding chairman of Samjeon Group. My father, Jeon Jae-hyung, followed in his footsteps. True to his nickname as the \\"Iron Lady,\\" my father spent his life surrounded by countless women, from famous actresses to women of unknown origins, until he retired. Im Seon-mi was among them. Speaking of Im Seon-mi, she was an actress who peaked in her late teens to early twenties and then saw a decline, only to hit a new peak in her early thirties with her emotional acting, winning various film festival awards. Of course, Vice Chairman Jeon Jae-hyung was behind her resurgence. How do I know all this? Even if it's before my regression, in 1992, I was only ten years old. People don't really know what a chaebol representative is like. All they know is the fantasy-like image from TV dramas or caricatured characters. Chairman Jeon Jae-hyung was an excellent manager for Samjeon Group. He restructured the company during crises and didn't hesitate to invest in specialized areas. Employee welfare and salaries were significantly better than other companies, making it the most desired workplace for ten consecutive years. Despite this public image, Jeon Jae-hyung, as a father and a man, was trash. That's why I was particularly strict about relationships with women, unlike my father. My father often talked openly about the celebrities he was seeing, even in front of us. \\"Do you guys know Im Seon-mi?\\" \\"Yes, dad. Seon-mi noona is really pretty.\\" At that time, I really liked the pure image of Im Seon-mi on TV. Even at a young age, my heart fluttered when I saw her commercials or acting. \\"She's pretty, but you know, she hates it when people touch her nose because she's had several nose surgeries.\\" \\"How do you know that, dad?\\" I asked innocently, and my dad looked at me with an indescribable smile. \\"Sung-guk, when you take over this position, you'll understand everything. Got it?\\" \\"......\\" At ten years old, I didn't understand what he meant, but I nodded. * * * Now, Im Seon-mi was standing in front of me, holding Jae-hee. Jae-hee seemed a bit annoyed and squirmed with his whole body. Im Seon-mi was trying to smile, but her face was pulled back, and her brows were furrowed. It seemed she had recently had nose surgery, judging by the thick makeup covering her nose bridge. \\"Today's shoot requires getting along with me. The kid seems shy around strangers, ma'am.\\" \\"It's probably because the shooting set is unfamiliar. I'll try to soothe him.\\" As soon as those words were spoken, the nanny stood up and took Jae-hee. Jae-hee finally calmed down, but his face still looked dissatisfied. I began to ponder how Jae-hee could possibly punch Im Seon-mi's nose. [He doesn't seem like he'd understand if I just told him...] Knock. Knock. The door to the waiting room opened, and a familiar face peeked in. It was Secretary Yang. Secretary Yang, who served me, was the son of Secretary Yang's father. The Yang family had been handling trivial matters for our family since my grandfather's time. Especially, Secretary Yang's father was very fond of me. I shouted with joy. [Secretary Yang, uncle! It's me!] Secretary Yang glanced at me and smiled. \\"The baby doesn't seem shy and smiles well.\\" \\"Our child is quite gentle.\\" My mom bowed her head in gratitude. Wait, if Secretary Yang is here, does that mean my father is making a move? I immediately recognized the person standing in the doorway. Tall stature, always neatly dressed. Hair neatly combed in a 2:8 parting. Despite being middle-aged, he had no belly fat, and his posture was upright. It was my father, Jeon Jae-hyung. [Father! Father!] I tried to support myself with one hand and waved the other. My mom quickly picked me up. \\"Sung-guk, there are a lot of people, isn't it nice? Mom will take you out more often from now on.\\" [Sigh. That's not it...] My cries and gestures were just entertainment to them. Secretary Yang said something to Im Seon-mi and then left the waiting room together. [Today is the day...] I remembered the time my father knew I liked Im Seon-mi and took me to her commercial shoot. My father introduced me to Im Seon-mi. Im Seon-mi stroked my cheeks a few times with her hand and then disappeared with my father, returning later with her makeup removed. During that time, I played with Secretary Yang, uncle, at the shooting set. Soon, the door to the waiting room opened, and a curly-haired assistant director entered with a troubled face. \\"Ma'am, the shoot might be delayed a bit.\\" \\"Our Jae-hee is about to eat and sleep soon. Didn't you say you'd adjust the time?\\" \\"I'm sorry. It's just that Im Seon-mi is feeling a bit unwell.\\" [Where did that lie come from...] Im Seon-mi was busy in the back seat of my father's car at that time. My father said it wouldn't take long since he was in a hurry. I shook my head in disbelief. The middle-aged nanny briefly placed Jae-hee next to me. \\"Ma'am, I urgently need to go to the bathroom. Please watch Jae-hee for a moment.\\" \\"You should deduct the bathroom time from your salary. Hurry back.\\" \\"I'm sorry.\\" While the nanny was in the bathroom, the lady didn't lift a finger. The assistant director glanced around nervously and then quietly left, leaving my mom and me in an awkward silence. Jae-hee, sitting on the sofa next to me, looked utterly listless at a glance. Should I try talking to him? We're about the same age, so maybe we can communicate. [Hey, you don't want to shoot, do you?] Surprisingly, Jae-hee responded quickly. \\"Eung-ae. Eung. Eung-eung-eung.\\" [What? I kind of understand...] I looked at Jae-hee in surprise. Jae-hee continued to grumble discontentedly. [Tell me everything!] In summary, he didn't like the shoot because the lights were too hot and irritating, and he was annoyed by people telling him what to do. He was also hungry and sleepy. The pampered young master seemed to find this kind of work bothersome. Memories are something that come after growing up, but for now, he probably disliked this dusty shooting set. Taking care of what the other person dislikes. That was a way to gain trust in a business relationship. I told Jae-hee about Im Seon-mi's weakness exactly. [Hit that noona's nose. Her nose is her weak point. You'll probably get out of shooting if you hit her hard enough.] \\"Eung-ae?\\" [Of course, it's true. Don't worry and just hit her as hard as you can.] \\"Eung-ae.\\" Jae-hee nodded vigorously. \\"Oh, you two seem to get along well. What were you talking about?\\" The returning middle-aged nanny picked up Jae-hee. * * * \\"The shoot is about to start.\\" The assistant director rushed in and shouted. Jae-hee, ready, headed to the set with his mom and the nanny. I gave Jae-hee my last words of encouragement. [Fighting!] \\"Eung-ae!\\" Jae-hee responded with all his might. I was starting to like Jae-hee. It was clear he didn't want to be twisted by growing up in a wealthy family. [If only such a kid was born in a poor family and suffered in my place...] Suddenly, my mom's hand came in and patted my belly. It was my favorite technique of my mom's. When my mom patted my belly like this, all worries and concerns flew away, and I felt blissfully happy. \\"Sung-guk, even if we can't shoot today, thanks to you, mom had a great time watching. I even saw Im Seon-mi. Sung-guk, mom loves you so much.\\" Mom showered my cheeks with kisses. I was moved. In this life, I was too emotional. Just the words \\"I love you\\" made me emotional. I had never properly heard \\"I love you\\" before my regression. Everyone used to say they respected me more than they loved me. At that time, I thought that was good. I reached out my hand to my mom. Then, mom lifted me up over her protruding belly. \\"Mom thinks our Sung-guk is the prettiest... It seems the gentlemen here don't think so. But since the director promised to recommend us here and there, we'll have another chance, right?\\" [Opportunities are not to be waited for, but to be made, mom.] \\"Yes, yes. Let's wait with mom, Sung-guk.\\" I shook my head. Just then, the waiting room door opened, and the curly-haired assistant director rushed in. \\"Get ready.\\" \\"Huh?\\" My mom asked in surprise. \\"Get ready for the shoot! Can't you understand?\\" \\"Is it our Sung-guk's turn?\\" \\"Yes, that's right.\\" [What's with the attitude?] It seemed I had to remember this guy. Soon, staff members rushed in, dressed me in the onesie Jae-hee had worn, and ran to the set. I saw Im Seon-mi fixing her makeup with an angry face. Next to her stood Jae-hee's mom, equally angry. \\"Why can't you give us one more chance? Huh?\\" Jae-hee's mom was questioning the director. \\"We've already given you an hour, and it's the same. The kid doesn't listen, and he keeps hitting the female model's face. We have to finish shooting today. If it continues like this, we can't shoot tomorrow either!\\" \\"I'm going to call our chairman right now.\\" \\"Go ahead! I don't want to do this commercial either!\\" The director yelled angrily. This made Jae-hee burst into tears, and the set turned into chaos. Jae-hee's mom grabbed a brick-sized phone and dialed somewhere. That's when it happened. Im Seon-mi, who was fixing her makeup, walked over and snatched the phone. \\"What are you doing? Acting all high and mighty as a model.\\" \\"Do you know where we're shooting this commercial?\\" \\"How dare you speak informally?\\" Jae-hee's mom aggressively confronted Im Seon-mi. But Im Seon-mi was no pushover. \\"You started with the informal speech, so I'm just following suit. Mrs. Dukpung Paper. You should have behaved properly when you were treated as a lady. Your child doesn't listen and has no talent, so what are you going to do?\\" \\"This... Hey!\\" As Jae-hee's mom's hand went up, Im Seon-mi quickly grabbed it. The set went silent in an instant. I, too, watched, spellbound. Im Seon-mi looked around once and then stared straight at Jae-hee's mom. \\"Being born into a rich family and marrying well, you think the world is easy, but this isn't that kind of place. If you lack talent, just drink cold water and go home. This spot should be taken by someone with talent, right?\\" \\"Are you not letting go of my hand? You, I know all about you receiving sponsorship from the vice chairman of Samjeon Group. That's why you're the exclusive model for Samjeon Electronics. How can you be so brazen?\\" [Oh, the lady is tough too.] My mom and I held hands and watched the thrilling confrontation between the two women. \\"Then you know well. I have Samjeon Group behind me, and you're just a daughter-in-law of a small and medium-sized enterprise, acting all high and mighty?\\" \\"......\\" I almost clapped my hands. A daughter-in-law of a small and medium-sized enterprise, acting all high and mighty! That was exactly what I wanted to say. The director and staff, who were watching the scene, couldn't even open their mouths in shock. Im Seon-mi forcefully shook off Jae-hee's mom's hand and walked towards the director. \\"Director, let's start shooting with the backup model. I have a movie shoot tomorrow, so I don't have time. If that lady says anything, I'll call the vice chairman of Samjeon myself, so just ignore her and start shooting. If she's been bribing someone, unless it's the chairman of Samjeon Group, I'll take care of everything.\\" \\"Okay. Let's start shooting. Sung-guk, are you ready?\\" The director looked at me.

Это необходимо для обеспечения возможности перемещения створки окна с закрепленным на ней ограничителем. - Пластина-гребенка (1) фиксируется на раме окна. Пластина-гребенка имеет ряд впадин, которые будет использовать выступ-зацеп (3) для фиксации положения створки. 2. **Регулирование зазора и интенсивности проветривания:** - После крепления основных элементов, створку окна ставят в требуемое положение таким образом, чтобы между створкой окна и оконной рамой образовывался зазор. Этот зазор является ключевым для регулирования интенсивности проникновения воздуха. - Выбранное положение фиксируют путем вставки выступа-зацепа (3) в соответствующую впадину на пластине-гребенке (1). Позиция выступа-зацепа по отношению к впадинам пластины-гребенки определяет величину открывания окна. - Если потребность в проветривании помещения меняется, можно настроить интенсивность воздухообмена, изменяя положение выступа-зацепа (3) по впадинам пластины-гребенки (1). Это позволяет увеличить или уменьшить величину зазора между створкой окна и оконной рамой, таким образом, контролируя количество проникающего в помещение воздуха. Важность такого механизма контроля за интенсивностью проветривания помещения состоит в гибкости и возможности адаптации к текущим потребностям без необходимости полного открытия или закрытия окна, что делает данный ограничитель открывания окна весьма полезным устройством для контроля микроклимата в помещении."},{"instruction":"Напиши ОБОСНОВАНИЕ ПОЛОЖИТЕЛЬНОГО ЭФФЕКТА ОТ ПРИМЕНЕНИЯ ПРЕДЛОЖЕНИЯ ВЫШЕ","output":"Применение ограничителя открывания окна, как описано выше, приводит к нескольким значительным положительным эффектам, которые можно обосновать с точки зрения удобства использования, энергоэффективности, безопасности и здоровья. 1. **Удобство использования и гибкость:** Ограничитель открывания окна позволяет пользователям легко регулировать величину зазора между створкой и рамой.

Both techniques serve different purposes and come with their own sets of advantages and potential drawbacks in the context of cybersecurity threat intelligence. # Fine-Tuning **Advantages:** 1. **Domain-Specific Customization:** Fine-tuning allows the LLM to adjust to the nuances of cybersecurity data, incorporating the specific jargon, patterns, and entities relevant to cyber threat reports and TTP documentation. 2. **Performance:** Fine-tuned models often provide better performance on narrowly defined tasks or datasets because they have been specifically adjusted to optimize for those criteria. 3. **Efficiency:** Once fine-tuned, these models can directly generate or classify content without needing additional external information at runtime, which can lead to faster inference times. **Limitations:** - **Data Requirements:** Fine-tuning effectively often requires a significant amount of labeled data, which can be scarce or expensive to produce in specialized domains like cyber threat hunting. - **Overfitting Risk:** There's a risk of the model overfitting to the training data, especially if the dataset is not diverse enough, which could limit its generalizability. # Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) **Advantages:** 1. **Up-to-date Information:** RAG models can leverage the most current data by retrieving relevant information from updated databases or the internet during the generation process. This is particularly valuable in fields like cybersecurity, where new threats emerge constantly. 2. **Flexibility and Adaptability:** They can adapt to new information without the need for retraining, as the knowledge base they draw from is continually updated. 3. **Handling Sparse Data:** RAG can be particularly useful in situations where the training data is sparse or not comprehensive, as it can pull in additional information as needed. **Limitations:** - **Complexity and Latency:** These models can be more complex to implement and might introduce higher latency in generating outputs, as they involve an additional retrieval step. - **Dependency on External Sources:** The quality of the generated content can be highly dependent on the relevance and accuracy of the retrieved documents or data. # Recommendation In deciding between fine-tuning and RAG for enhancing cyber threat intelligence with LLMs, consider your specific research goals and the nature of your dataset. For projects where the emphasis is on leveraging the most current and comprehensive insights into cyber threats and TTPs, and where data might be continually evolving, RAG could offer significant advantages by pulling in the latest information and offering more adaptable responses. However, for applications that demand high speed, specificity to a well-defined dataset, and where real-time data retrieval might not be critical, fine-tuning could be more appropriate. Given the dynamic nature of cyber threats, a hybrid approach might also be worth exploring. For instance, you could fine-tune a model on a specific corpus of cyber threat intelligence to establish a strong baseline understanding of the domain and then augment this with RAG to incorporate real-time updates and broader contextual information. This dual strategy could harness the strengths of both methods to create a more robust and adaptive tool for cyber threat hunting. Overall, your choice should align with the nuances of your project's objectives, data characteristics, and the specific challenges of the cyber threat intelligence domain. Pilot studies and preliminary experiments comparing the performance of both approaches on a subset of your tasks can provide valuable insights to guide your decision."},{"instruction":"Latest update your information date","output":"The information I provided is based on knowledge and trends up to April 2023.

Their primary purpose is to prevent multiple inclusions of the same header file, which can lead to problems such as redefinition errors. They ensure that the compiler only includes a header file once, even if it’s referenced multiple times in various parts of your project through \`#include\` directives. When it comes to source files (\`.cpp\` files), the situation changes considerably. Each \`.cpp\` file is intended to be compiled into an object file (.o or .obj) separately, and the use of include guards within a \`.cpp\` file does not serve the purpose it does in header files. This is because source files are typically not included via \`#include\` directives, and therefore, will not be inserted into another file's text that gets compiled, potentially multiple times. Your scenario with a private class defined within a \`.cpp\` file (in your case, \`Privateclass.cpp\`) doesn't require include guards because: 1. The \`.cpp\` file itself is not expected to be included with an \`#include\` directive in other files. The very nature of a private class implemented directly within a \`.cpp\` file suggests it is meant to be encapsulated within that single compilation unit, not shared or reused by including it in other places. 2. Static methods in private classes used only within single \`.cpp\` files are not exposed outside their respective compilation unit, aligning with your encapsulation and friendship design considerations. However, one might argue why you have a guard named \`PRIVATECLASS_CPP\` in your \`.cpp\` file. If your intention was to conditionally compile certain parts of the \`.cpp\` file based on whether or not it has already been compiled, this wouldn’t work as expected because each \`.cpp\` file is compiled independently in its entirety. A more common practice to conditionally compile parts of files, be they header or source files, is to use other preprocessor directives based on conditions you define or that are predefined (e.g., based on the platform you're compiling for). In summary, include guards (\`#ifndef\`, \`#define\`, \`#endif\`) are a pattern for header files, not source files, and you generally should not use them in \`.cpp\` files. Instead, focus on proper design and organization of your classes, methods, and files to ensure encapsulation, reusability, and maintainability of your code."},{"instruction":"Напиши текст для питчинга техно альбома.

[나 콘티 이미 다 안다고, 엄마. 자, 이번 컷은 한 번에 간다!] 나는 엄마를 향해서 집에서 거울 보고 연습한 함박웃음을 지었다. 입 동굴이 개방되면서 목젖까지 보이는, 그야말로 누가 봐도 기분 좋은 함박웃음이었다. “커엇!” 감독의 우렁찬 목소리가 들렸다. “다시 돌려봐.” “네, 감독님.” 조연출이 얼른 녹화된 화면을 돌렸다. “이거 두 번 찍을 필요도 없네. 다음 신!” 나는 어깨를 으쓱하곤 다음 신을 시작했다. 아빠라는 단어를 말하는 이 광고의 하이라이트였다. 나는 아빠라는 단어의 억양을 미세하게 분석해서 끝을 올려보기도, 끝을 내려보기도 하면서 단 세 번 만에 오케이를 받아냈다. 광고장의 분위기는 활기차지기 시작했다. 만족스러운 컷들이 나오는 모양이었다. 엄마가 얼른 다가와서 기저귀를 확인하고, 물을 먹였다. “성국아, 힘들지?” [남의 돈 먹는 건 다 어려운 거야, 엄마.] 코디가 다가와서 다시 내 머리를 체크했다. 이제 임선미와의 마지막 촬영만 남았다. 임선미는 나에게 다가오더니 빙긋 미소를 지었다. “성국이라고 했지? 내가 빨래 바구니를 들고 들어오면서 빨래를 네 앞에 흘릴 거야.” [응. 알고 있어.] 임선미는 엄마를 보고도 설명을 이었다. “어머니, 너무 걱정 마세요. 저만 잘하면 되는 촬영이에요. 성국이는 아기니까, 여기에서 기어 다니기만 화면 감독님이 알아서 편집해서 잘 이어 붙여주실 거예요.” [무슨 소리야. 난 화면 밖에서도 연기하는 배우라고. 내 몸 연기, 기대해!] 임선미는 내 머리를 쓰다듬었다. “성국아, 잘하자.” [걱정 마, 임선미. 이 광고는 20년 후에도 회자되는 그런 광고가 될 거야.] 나는 미소를 지었다. 다시 카메라가 돌아갔다. 임선미는 빨래 바구니를 들고 세탁기로 향하면서 그만 남편의 셔츠를 바닥에 떨어뜨리고 만다. 나는 그 순간을 놓치지 않고 손을 쭉 뻗어 셔츠를 탁 잡았다! “퍼펙트!” 감독의 유쾌한 목소리가 들렸다. * * * “고생하셨습니다!” 임선미가 밝은 미소로 고개를 숙이며 스태프들에게 인사했다. 감독이 자리에서 일어나면서 만족스러운 얼굴로 스태프들에게 소리쳤다. “오늘 저녁은 내가 쏠 테니 한 명도 빠지지 말고 모여!” “네, 감독님!” 여기저기서 유쾌한 대답이 들렸다. “참, 조연출! 너 나 좀 보자.” “네… 감독님.” 파마머리 조연출은 감독의 눈치를 살폈다. 감독은 파마머리 조연출을 구석으로 데리고 갔다. “감독님, 무슨 할 말 있으세요?” “너, 나랑 일한 게 이번이 처음이지?” “네.” “회사에 말해둘 테니까, 이번 일 정산받고 다른 회사로 옮겨.” 파마머리 조연출은 잠시 말이 없었다. 얼굴이 붉어지더니 목소리가 격앙됐다. “감독님, 이건 저도 어쩔 수 없는 일이었잖아요.” “뭐가 어쩔 수 없는 일이야?” 감독은 한숨을 팍 내쉬었다. “저도 위에서 까라고 해서 깐 거예요.” “진짜 이 새끼가 끝까지….” 감독은 잠시 숨을 골랐다. “덕풍 제지 그 사모님인가, 누가 나가면서 너한테 돈까지 따로 찔러줬다고 그러더라! 어! 그런데 위에서 까라고 해서 깐 거라고?” “그, 그게….” “그래, 위에서 까라고 할 때도 있지. 나도 어쩔 수 없을 때도 있어. 근데 너처럼 미리 콘티 빼서 애한테 알려주고, 돈 더 받는 짓은 안 해. 너 당장 나가고, 성국이네한테 가서도 사과해!” “그건….” “못 하겠어?” 파마머리 조연출은 입을 앙다물었다. “가서 사과 안 하면 너 이 광고 바닥에 다시는 발도 못 붙일 줄 알아. 내가 그 정도 입김은 있는 거 너도 알지?” “…네. 감독님, 죄송합니다.” 파마머리 조연출은 어쩔 수 없이 고개를 숙였다. * * * 달콤한 바나나를 한입 깨물 찰나였다. 똑. 똑. 노크 소리가 들리더니 대기실 문이 열렸다. 파마머리 조연출이 누가 봐도 오늘 잘린 얼굴로 들어왔다. 그러곤 나를 원망 어린 눈으로 흘깃 쳐다봤다. 저 눈빛만으로도 뭔지 알 것 같았다. 해고된 것도 억울한데, 지금 나한테 사과까지 하라고 감독이 시킨 모양이었다. 삼전 그룹 회장 자리에 오르기까지 요직에 필요한 인재들을 자르고 고용하는 일을 수없이 했다. 내가 직접 말한 경우는 없지만, 어쨌든 우연치 않게 얼굴을 다시 볼 때면 꼭 저런 얼굴을 하고 있었다. 나는 바나나를 앙 깨물었다. 그리고 우물우물 씹어댔다. 파마머리 조연출은 엄마에게 다가가더니 시큰둥한 얼굴로 입을 열었다. “혹, 저 때문에 기분 나쁘신 일 있으셨으면 사과드릴게요.” 그때였다. 문틈 사이로 지나가던 감독이 버럭 소리를 쳤다. “야! 제대로 안 해!” 뜨끔 놀란 파마머리는 얼른 엄마와 내게 고개를 푹 숙이고는 문밖에 있는 감독 들으라는 듯이 소리쳤다. “저 때문에 기분 나쁜 일 있으셨다면 진심으로 사과드립니다!” “아니에요.” 엄마는 손사래를 쳤다. 나는 바나나를 우물거리며 파마머리 조연출을 눈에 담았다. 이 일을 하다 보면 여기저기서 만날 수 있었다. 원래 이런 기생충 같은 놈들이 생명력은 미친 듯이 끈질겼다. 이때, 감독이 문을 열고 들어섰다. “야! 끝났으면 마무리해.” 감독은 마무리까지 아주 깔끔하게 알려줬다. “네, 감독님. 전 가볼게요.” 파마머리 조연출은 연신 고개를 숙이고는 나갔다. 엄마는 얼른 감독님에게 음료수 하나를 내밀었다. “감독님, 고생 많으셨어요.” “아우, 우리 성국이가 고생했죠. 이 녀석 때문에 촬영 시간이 반으로 줄었어요.” 대기실 문이 열리면서 임선미도 고개를 삐죽 들이밀었다. “다 여기 있네요. 뭐야, 나 주인공 뺏긴 거예요?” 임선미가 환하게 웃으며 들어오더니 내 칭찬을 늘어놨다. “어머니, 진짜 성국이 떡잎부터 달라요. 어머니도 이렇게 미인이신데, 성국이 큰 모습도 기대돼요.” “과찬이세요. 우연히 참가한 건데, 광고까지 찍고 임선미 씨도 보고. 너무 행복했어요.” 엄마는 정말 해맑게 웃었다. 감독도 잘 챙기고, 자신을 낮추면서 상대방을 올려주는 것이, 엄마에게서 사회생활 만렙의 기운이 느껴졌다. 이 와중에 나는 광고 촬영에 너무 열과 성의를 다 쏟았는지 잠이 쏟아졌다. 엄마에게 안겨 꾸벅꾸벅 졸았다. 감독이 얼른 말을 건넸다. “이 녀석, 피곤한가 보네. 어머니, 회사 가는 봉고 타지 마시고 제 차로 같이 가세요. 집까지 데려다 드릴게요.” “아, 아니에요. 회사 가서 모델료도 받아야 하고.” “그건 걱정 마세요. 제가 다 알아서 해놓을게요.” “저희 집 멀어서요. 저희 데려다주고 가시면 회식 늦을 거예요.” 엄마는 한사코 만류했다. “집이 어디신데요? 전 내일 영화 촬영 때문에 어차피 회식 못 가거든요. 저녁에 먹으면 바로 붓는 스타일이라서요. 제가 태워다 드릴게요.” 임선미가 나섰다. 엄마는 얼른 손을 휘저었다. “말도 안 돼요.” “괜찮아요. 보니까 둘째 가지신 것 같은데, 봉고 타고 거기서 또 움직이셔야 하잖아요. 집 어디세요?” “수유리요.” 엄마는 기어들어 가는 목소리로 말했다. 대한민국에서 제일 잘나가는 여배우가 수유리 같은 곳을 모를 것이라고 여겼기 때문이다. “나 성국이랑 진짜 인연인가 봐, 감독님. 저 수유리 출신이잖아요. 오랜만에 동네도 구경하고, 데려다 드릴게요. 사양 마세요.” “진짜요?” “그럼, 진짜죠. 그러니까 사양 진짜 마세요.” “감사합니다. 감사합니다.” 엄마는 연신 허리를 굽혔다. 그 바람에 나도 연신 아래로 떨어졌다 위로 솟구치는 통에 조금 멀미가 났다. [엄마, 나 멀미 난다고.] “미안, 미안. 성국아.” 엄마는 나를 안고는 임선미를 따라나섰다. 엄마의 얼굴에 미소가 번졌다. 나는 감기는 눈으로 엄마의 미소를 황홀하게 바라봤다. 철의 여인은 한 번도 저런 미소를 보여준 적이 없었다. 어쩌면 미소를 지을 수 있었을지도 모른다. 다만, 미소 지을 수 없는 상황이 매일 반복되는 일상이었던 것인지도. 가난해도 행복할 수 있구나. 나는 스르르 눈을 감았다. * * * 임선미의 매니저는 우리 집 골목에서 차를 멈췄다. 꿀잠을 자고 일어난 나는 임선미를 보고 방긋방긋 웃어줬다. 회귀 전 철의 여인이 참 미워했는데, 오늘은 나에게 은인이나 다름없었다. “성국이 잠 다 잤어?” “응애.” “진짜 말귀 다 알아듣네. 어머니, 연락처 하나만 주세요.” “연락처요?” “성국이 이번 광고 나가면 아마 장난 아니게 광고 제의 많이 들어올 거예요. 어머니 혼자 감당 안 되실 거예요. 저희 기획사 괜찮거든요. 제가 소개해 드릴게요.” “아, 그것까진….” 엄마는 당황한 얼굴로 나를 쳐다봤다. 임선미가 재빨리 명함을 내밀었다. “저희 회사 대표님 명함이에요. 제가 대표님한테는 잘 이야기해 놓을 테니까, 꼭 연락 주세요.” [안 받고 뭐 해, 엄마!] 나는 얼른 엄마의 옷깃을 잡아당겼다. 엄마는 내 제스처를 읽고는 얼른 임선미가 내민 명함을 받아 들었다. “감사합니다. 정말 감사합니다.” “성국아, 다음에 또 보자!” 임선미가 손을 흔들었다. * * * 엄마는 믿기지 않는 얼굴로 멍하니 현관문 앞에 서서 열쇠를 찾고 있었다. “107호, 왜 그래요?” “어, 언니…?” 막 퇴근한 단발머리가 뒤에서 엄마를 불렀다. 단발머리의 얼굴에는 처음 보는 쾌감 같은 게 얼핏 보였다. “성국이가 대타로 홈런 날렸다면서요?” “벌써 소식 들으셨어요?” “감독님이 직접 전화 와서 모델료 빨리 정산해서 갖다 주라고 난리도 아니었어요. 심지어 책정된 모델료보다 더 주기로 했어요.” “정말요? 근데… 모델료 얼마예요?” 엄마는 눈을 깜빡였다. [엎드려서 셔츠 냄새 맡느라 내 승모근과 허리가 빳빳하게 굳었는데, 얼마 받는지도 모르다니.] “원래 300만 원인데, 삼전 그룹 쪽에서 보너스로 100만 원 더 넣어줬어요.” “그, 그럼….” “총 400만 원에서 세금 떼고 가지고 왔어요. 수령 확인서에 사인 좀 해줘요. 안 그러면 나 돈 떼먹은 사람 되니까요.” “당연히 사인해야죠.” 단발머리가 엄마에게 누런 봉투를 내밀었다. 엄마는 덜덜 떨리는 손으로 봉투를 받아 들었다. “어, 언니. 저 평생 이렇게 큰돈 처음 만져 봐요.” [엄마, 정신 차리라고. 나 전성국이야. 그 돈의 억만 배는 넘게 벌거니까, 그만 감동해.] “문단속 잘하고 있어요.” “어, 언니…. 성국이 아빠가 늦거든요. 같이 저녁 안 드실래요? 저, 너무 무서워요.” 단발머리는 살짝 갈등했다. 막 퇴근한 직장인에게 아기까지 딸린 여자가 같이 밥을 먹자는 것은 노동의 연장을 의미했다. 단발머리는 사지를 덜덜 떠는 엄마를 보더니 한숨을 쉬며 손짓을 했다. “우선 집에 들어가서 문 잘 잠그고 있어요. 요 앞에 가서 치킨 사올게요.” “어, 언니. 잠시만요.” 엄마가 노란 봉투에서 만 원짜리 한 장을 벌벌 떨며 꺼내려고 하자, 단발머리가 손으로 막았다. “됐어요. 이 돈 모아서 더 좋은 데 이사 가요. 어서 들어가 있어요.” “언니, 고마워요.” 단발머리는 총총걸음으로 다세대주택을 빠져나갔다. 피곤한 와중에도 나는 단발머리의 뒷모습을 쳐다봤다. 이전 생의 아버지인 전재형 회장은 항상 말씀하셨다. - 아무도 믿지 마라. 부모도, 자식도. 집주인 단발머리는 왜 우리한테 이렇게 잘해주는 걸까?","output":"Episode 7 Opportunities are indeed created. I vividly remember this advertisement as well. It was a commercial for a top-loading washing machine ambitiously released by Samjeon Electronics. Lim Sun-mi, the exclusive model for Samjeon Electronics, is seen holding her husband's shirt and sniffing it. From various food smells to sweat and cigarette odors, she grimaces at the mix of scents and tries to put it in the laundry basket but ends up dropping it on the floor. The baby, who was playing around, crawls over, smells the dad's shirt, and says, \\"Da. Ddy!\\" making it the highlight of the advertisement. At the end, the baby is seen sleeping peacefully with the washed shirt from the top-loading washing machine, and Lim Sun-mi exclaims, \\"Laundry's done!\\" The storyboard was perfectly etched in my mind. All I had to do was direct the word \\"Daddy\\" and the face of a child sleeping without a care in the world. \\"Ms. Sun-mi, we'll start shooting with the baby first.\\" \\"Director, if we take any longer, I'm really going to be in trouble.\\" \\"I'll make it quick.\\" I heard the director and Lim Sun-mi conversing. [Everyone, don't worry.] I casually loosened my short neck. I saw the director glaring at the assistant director with permed hair. \\"We'll talk after this is over.\\" \\"Yes… Director.\\" The assistant director with permed hair responded in a subdued voice. Following the director's orders, the set was quickly reorganized. The stylist rushed over and neatly combed my sparse hair. \\"How was this kid even considered? The one before was a hundred times prettier.\\" [They must have been bribed.] \\"Oh, the baby's babbling in response to my words. I'll make you look pretty.\\" [I might be all face, but try to lay the back hair down nicely.] The stylist quickly finished up and left. The director approached with my mother. \\"Please stay here, mother. It's a scene where Ms. Sun-mi smiles brightly at you, but we'll shoot the baby model's close-up shot first.\\" \\"Yes, Director. Seong-guk smiles well.\\" The director looked at me with a worried face. \\"Seong-guk, let's finish this quickly.\\" [Okay!] I nodded as if I understood the director. \\"This kid, seems like he really understands me.\\" The director shouted to everyone. \\"Alright, everyone, standby!\\" \\"Yes!\\" Responses were heard, and soon, under the director's command, the lights were poured on. So this is what it feels like to be enveloped in dazzling lights. I enjoyed the glamorous lights and looked at the camera. Right below the camera, my mom crouched down as low as possible and waved at me. [I already know the storyboard, mom. Now, let's nail this cut in one go!] I smiled at my mom, practicing a beaming smile in the mirror at home. A smile so bright that anyone could see how happy I was, showing even my uvula. \\"Cut!\\" The director's resonant voice was heard. \\"Let's take it again.\\" \\"Yes, Director.\\" The assistant director quickly replayed the recorded scene. \\"No need to shoot this twice. Next scene!\\" I shrugged my shoulders and moved on to the next scene. It was the highlight of the advertisement, saying the word \\"Daddy.\\" I analyzed the intonation of the word \\"Daddy\\" minutely, trying to raise and lower the end, and received an okay in just three tries. The atmosphere on set began to liven up. It seemed like satisfactory cuts were coming out. My mom quickly came over to check my diaper and fed me water. \\"Seong-guk, are you tired?\\" [Eating someone else's money is always hard, mom.] The stylist came over and checked my hair again. Now, only the final shoot with Lim Sun-mi was left. Lim Sun-mi approached me and smiled brightly. \\"Seong-guk, right? When I come in holding the laundry basket and drop the laundry in front of you.\\" [Yeah. I know.] Lim Sun-mi continued to explain, looking at my mom. \\"Mom, don't worry too much. It's a shoot that only I need to do well. Seong-guk is just a baby, so the director will edit it nicely with him crawling around here.\\" [What are you talking about? I'm an actor who performs even off-screen. Look forward to my body acting!] Lim Sun-mi patted my head. \\"Seong-guk, let's do well.\\" [Don't worry, Lim Sun-mi. This advertisement will be talked about even 20 years later.] I smiled. The camera started rolling again. Lim Sun-mi, holding the laundry basket, heads towards the washing machine but ends up dropping her husband's shirt on the floor. I didn't miss the moment and stretched out my hand to grab the shirt! \\"Perfect!\\" The director's cheerful voice was heard. * * * \\"Thank you for your hard work!\\" Lim Sun-mi bowed with a bright smile to the staff. The director stood up, looking satisfied, and shouted to the staff. \\"I'll treat everyone to dinner tonight, so don't miss out!\\" \\"Yes, Director!\\" Cheerful responses were heard from here and there. \\"By the way, assistant director! I need to see you.\\" \\"Yes… Director.\\" The assistant director with permed hair glanced at the director. The director took the assistant director with permed hair to a corner. \\"Director, is there something you want to say?\\" \\"Is this your first time working with me?\\" \\"Yes.\\" \\"I'll talk to the company, so after settling this job, move to another company.\\" The assistant director with permed hair was silent for a moment. His face turned red, and his voice became agitated. \\"Director, I couldn't help it.\\" \\"What couldn't you help?\\" The director sighed deeply. \\"I was told to do it from above.\\" \\"This guy, until the end….\\" The director took a moment to breathe. \\"Was it the lady from Deokpung Paper, someone gave you extra money on the way out! Huh! And you're saying you were told to do it from above?\\" \\"That, that's….\\" \\"Yeah, there are times when you're told to do it from above. I also have times when I can't help it. But I don't do things like leaking the storyboard in advance and taking more money like you. Leave now, and go apologize to Seong-guk's family!\\" \\"That's….\\" \\"Can't do it?\\" The assistant director with permed hair clenched his mouth shut. \\"If you don't go apologize, know that you won't be able to set foot in this advertising industry again. You know I have that much influence, right?\\" \\"…Yes, Director. I'm sorry.\\" The assistant director with permed hair reluctantly bowed his head. * * * It was the moment I was about to bite into a sweet banana. Knock. Knock. The door to the waiting room opened, and the assistant director with permed hair, who obviously looked like he had been fired today, entered. He glanced at me with a resentful look. Just that look seemed to say it all. He was upset about being fired, and now the director had ordered him to apologize to me. In my previous life, as the chairman of Samjeon Group, I had countless times fired and hired essential personnel for key positions. I never said it directly, but whenever I happened to see their faces again, they always had that look. I bit into the banana. And chewed it thoroughly. The assistant director with permed hair approached my mom and started speaking with a half-hearted face. \\"If there was anything that upset you because of me, I apologize.\\" That's when it happened. The director, passing by the door, shouted angrily. \\"Hey! Do it properly!\\" Startled, the assistant director with permed hair quickly bowed deeply to my mom and me, shouting loud enough for the director outside to hear. \\"If there was anything that upset you because of me, I sincerely apologize!\\" \\"It's okay.\\" My mom waved her hands. I chewed on the banana while taking in the assistant director with permed hair. In this line of work, you could run into them anywhere. These parasitic types always had an insanely tenacious vitality. Then, the director entered the room. \\"Hey! If you're done, wrap it up.\\" The director neatly showed him how to finish up. \\"Yes, Director. I'll be leaving now.\\" The assistant director with permed hair bowed repeatedly and left. My mom quickly offered a drink to the director. \\"Director, you've worked hard.\\" \\"Ah, our Seong-guk worked hard. Because of this guy, the shooting time was cut in half.\\" The waiting room door opened, and Lim Sun-mi also peeked in. \\"Everyone's here. What, did I lose the lead role?\\" Lim Sun-mi entered with a bright smile and praised me. \\"Mom, Seong-guk is really special from the start. You're such a beauty, so I'm looking forward to seeing Seong-guk grow up.\\" \\"You flatter me. It was just a coincidence to participate, but filming an advertisement and meeting Ms. Lim Sun-mi. I was so happy.\\" My mom genuinely smiled. The director took good care of everyone, humbling himself while lifting others, emitting an aura of a social life master from my mom. Meanwhile, I was so focused on the advertisement shoot that I started to feel sleepy. I dozed off in my mom's arms. The director quickly spoke up. \\"This kid must be tired. Mom, don't take the company van, ride with me. I'll drop you off at home.\\" \\"Oh, no. We have to go to the company to receive the modeling fee.\\" \\"Don't worry about that. I'll take care of everything.\\" \\"Our house is far. If you drop us off, you'll be late for the dinner.\\" My mom firmly refused. \\"Where do you live? I have a movie shoot tomorrow, so I can't go to the dinner anyway. I swell up right away if I eat in the evening. I'll drive you.\\" Lim Sun-mi stepped in. My mom quickly waved her hands. \\"That's ridiculous.\\" \\"It's okay. It looks like you're expecting a second child, so it'll be hard to take the van and move again. Where do you live?\\" \\"Suyuri.\\" My mom spoke in a voice that seemed to shrink. She thought that the top actress in South Korea wouldn't know a place like Suyuri. \\"I guess Seong-guk and I really have a connection, Director. I'm from Suyuri. I'll take a look around my old neighborhood and drop you off. Please don't refuse.\\" \\"Really?\\" \\"Of course, it's true. So, please don't refuse.\\" \\"Thank you. Thank you so much.\\" My mom bowed repeatedly. Because of that, I kept falling down and rising up, making me a bit carsick. [Mom, I'm getting carsick.] \\"Sorry, sorry, Seong-guk.\\" My mom held me and followed Lim Sun-mi. A smile spread across my mom's face. I blissfully watched my mom's smile with drowsy eyes. The Iron Lady had never shown such a smile. Maybe she could have smiled. Perhaps it was just that situations where she could smile never occurred in her daily life. Even in poverty, one can be happy. I slowly closed my eyes. * * * Lim Sun-mi's manager stopped the car in our neighborhood alley. After a good sleep, I woke up and smiled brightly at Lim Sun-mi. Before regression, the Iron Lady was someone I really disliked, but today, she was almost like a benefactor to me. \\"Seong-guk, did you sleep well?\\" \\"Yeah.\\" \\"He really understands everything. Mom, can I have your contact number?\\" \\"Contact number?\\" \\"If Seong-guk's advertisement goes out, there will probably be a lot of advertisement offers. It'll be hard for you to handle alone. Our agency is pretty good. I'll introduce you.\\" \\"Oh, that's too much….\\" My mom looked at me, puzzled. Lim Sun-mi quickly handed over a business card. \\"This is our company president's business card. I'll talk to the president, so please contact us.\\" [Why aren't you taking it, mom!] I quickly tugged at my mom's clothes. Reading my gesture, my mom quickly took the business card Lim Sun-mi offered. \\"Thank you. Thank you so much.\\" \\"Seong-guk, let's meet again!\\" Lim Sun-mi waved her hand. * * * My mom stood dumbfounded in front of the front door, searching for the keys. \\"107, what's wrong?\\" \\"Oh, sister…?\\" The short-haired woman who had just returned from work called out to my mom from behind. A fleeting sense of pleasure seemed to cross the short-haired woman's face. \\"Seong-guk hit a home run as a substitute, right?\\" \\"Did you already hear the news?\\" \\"The director called directly, making a fuss about settling the modeling fee quickly and even decided to give more than the set amount.\\" \\"Really? But… how much is the modeling fee?\\" My mom blinked.

Please sign the receipt confirmation. Otherwise, I'll be accused of embezzlement.\\" \\"Of course, I'll sign.\\" The short-haired woman handed a yellow envelope to my mom. My mom's hands trembled as she took the envelope. \\"Oh, sister. This is the first time in my life I've held so much money.\\" [Get a grip, mom. I'm <PRESIDIO_ANONYMIZED_PERSON>. I'll earn millions of times more than that, so stop being moved.] \\"Make sure to lock the door well.\\" \\"Oh, sister…. Seong-guk's dad will be late, would you like to have dinner with us? I'm really scared.\\" The short-haired woman seemed conflicted for a moment. For a working woman who had just returned from work, being asked to have dinner with a woman and her baby meant an extension of labor. The short-haired woman looked at my mom, who was shivering, sighed, and gestured with her hand. \\"First, go inside and lock the door well. I'll go buy chicken from the front.\\" \\"Oh, sister. Wait a moment.\\" As my mom tried to shakily take out a 10,000 won bill from the yellow envelope, the short-haired woman stopped her with her hand. \\"It's okay. Save that money and move to a better place. Go inside and wait.\\" \\"Sister, thank you.\\" The short-haired woman hurriedly left the multi-family housing. Even though I was tired, I watched the short-haired woman's back. In my previous life, Chairman Jeon Jae-hyung, my father, always said, - Trust no one. Not even parents or children. Why is the landlord, the short-haired woman, being so nice to us?"},{"instruction":"제9화 아빠는 보쌈집 사장과 한 잔 더 하고 11시가 넘어서 집에 들어왔다. 오늘은 아빠의 양손 가득 무언가가 들려 있었다. “자기야, 그게 다 뭐야?” “사장님이 이것저것 마구 챙겨주셨어. 광고 나올 때마다 손님들한테 자랑하시느라 난리도 아니었어. 매상도 다른 날보다 배로 올랐어.” “사장님 정말 좋은 분이셔.” “이것 봐. 성국이가 아까 보쌈 고기 잘 먹는 거 보고는 가게에서 쓰는 보쌈 고기도 따로 챙겨주셨어.” 나는 잠결에 엄마, 아빠의 대화를 듣고 있었다. 아빠는 그 이후에도 여러 가지 자랑을 늘어놨다. 오늘 내가 나온 광고 덕분에 하루 종일 힘이 났다는 것과 사장님이 이젠 자기가 만든 보쌈이랑 맛이 거의 비슷하다며 칭찬해준 일 등 시시껄렁한 이야기였다. “자기야, 사장님이 보쌈집으로 바꾸고 매출도 많이 올라서 다음 달부터 월급도 10만 원 인상해 주신대.” “10만 원이나! 성국이 정말 복덩이인가 봐. 성국이 태어나고 자기 일도 잘되고, 너무 좋아.” 엄마는 겨우 10만 원에 아빠의 손을 부여잡고 감동하고 있었다. 10만 원이면 뭘 할 수 있지? 삼전 호텔에서 저녁 한 끼 겨우 먹을 수 있을까. 내가 졸린 눈을 비비자 아빠가 다가왔다. “성국아, 안 잤어?” [정확히 말하면 자다 깬 거지. 시끄러워서.] “소영아, 우리 성국이 선물 지금 줄까?” 아차, 선물이 있었다. 나는 그 말 한마디에 눈이 또랑또랑해졌다. [나 전직 재벌인데, 왜 이렇게 없이 구는 거지?] 아빠는 늘 들고 다니는 낡은 손가방을 뒤지더니 뭔가 작고 얇은 것을 꺼내 내 눈앞에 가져다 댔다. [뭐야, 통장이잖아….] 나는 실망한 투로 옹알거렸다. “성국아. 이거 보여? 통장이야. 네가 이번에 광고 모델 해서 번 돈, 다 네 이름 앞으로 저축했어. 여기 네 이름으로 된 거 보여? 전성국.” 아빠는 내 눈앞에 ‘전성국’ 이름으로 만들어진 통장을 들이밀었다. 정말 모델료 받은 돈 한 푼도 빼놓지 않고 모두 입금된 통장이었다. 심지어 오디션 날 교통비로 받은 5만 원도 저축했다. [엄마, 아빠 바보야? 이걸 왜 고대로 저금해! 이 돈으로 집도 좀 옮기고, 하다못해 맨날 똑같은 옷 입고 다니는 엄마, 아빠 입을 옷이라도 사야지!] 나는 버럭 소리를 질렀지만, 금세 눈가가 촉촉해졌다. 세금 떼고 나면 채 400만 원도 안 되는 금액. 회귀 전에 나에게 이 돈은 그저 한 끼 식사 금액일 때도 있었고, 하룻밤 술값이 안 될 때도 있었다. 하지만 이들에게 이 돈은 한 남자가 식당에서 아침부터 저녁까지 일하고 받는 반년치 월급이었다. 그런 돈을 지금 한 푼도 안 쓰고 내 이름으로 모두 저축한 것이었다. “성국아, 이거 네가 번 거니까 다 네 거야. 엄마, 아빠는 하나도 안 건드렸어. 우리 성국이가 커서 학교 가면, 이 돈으로 배우고 싶은 거 있으면 엄마, 아빠가 다 시켜줄게.” [나 좀 그만 울리라고!] 나는 목이 멨다. “자기야, 우리 성국이 진짜 우리 말 알아듣나 봐. 눈시울이 붉어졌어.” “소영아, 성국이 진짜 감정이 풍부한 것 같아. 그래서 연기도 잘하나 봐.” 나는 작은 두 손으로 얼굴을 비벼댔다. 아빠가 내 손을 잡았다. “성국아, 이러면 얼굴 다쳐요. 우리 스타님.” [누가 울리래!] “자기야, 성국이 자다 깨서 졸린 것 같아. 내가 안을게.” “아니야, 소영아. 너 배 나와서 힘들잖아. 내가 안을게.” 아빠는 나를 안아서 어느새 등을 도닥였다. 식당에서 하루 종일 일하고 또 나를 안아 들었다. “성국아, 너는 정말 고아원에서 자라서 부모도 모르고 형제도 없는 우리 같은 사람들한테 온 복덩이야. 엄마, 아빠가 아직 많이 어려서 많이 부족하지? 그래도 엄마, 아빠가 진짜 열심히 살아서 우리 성국이는 부족한 거 없이 자라도록 노력할게. 성국아, 사랑해.” 크응. 나는 몰래 울음을 삼켰다. 회귀 전의 나에게 이렇게 따뜻했던 사람이 있었던가. 부모조차 나를 자식이 아닌 삼전 그룹의 후계자로 생각하고 따뜻한 말보다 혹독한 채찍을 가했다. 주변 사람들은 내가 삼전 그룹의 후계자라는 사실을 알면 어떻게든 내게 잘 보여 뭐라도 뜯어갈 생각만 했다. 나는 아빠 품에 폭 안겼다. 그리고 광고 속 그 한마디를 외쳤다. “아. 빠?” “소영아, 들었어?” 아빠가 들뜬 얼굴로 엄마를 쳐다봤다. 엄마는 내 엉덩이를 토닥였다. “자기야! 우리 성국이, 아빠 진짜 잘하지?” “소영아, 사실은… 우리 성국이가 엄마, 아빠 말을 너무 안 해서 사실 한동안 고민했거든.” 얼마 전까지 이들은 내가 크는 동안 양육을 담당하는 대리모와 대리부 정도의 존재였다. “그게, 성국이한테 내가 부족한 아빠라서 그런 게 아닌가 괜히 자격지심 들고 그랬는데, 이제야 마음이 놓이는 것 같아.” “자기야, 그런 생각 하지 마. 우리 성국이 진짜 아빠라는 말을 세상에서 제일 잘하는 애니까.” “그러게. 어! 성국이 자나 보다.” 이럴 때는 자는 척이라도 해줘야 할 것 같았다. 나도 눈치라는 게 있다. 스물세 살의 아빠와 그보다 어린 엄마. 둘만의 시간이 필요해 보였다. 나는 슬그머니 눈을 감았다. * * * 삼전 전자 CF를 찍은 곽 감독이 집 앞까지 찾아왔다. 곽 감독의 손에는 과일바구니가 들려 있었다. 오랜만에 보는 열대과일이었다. 나는 어느새 과일바구니를 향해 기어갔다. 애가 되더니 전에는 없던 식탐까지 생긴 모양이다. 얼른 멜론을 집어 들려는 순간, 엄마가 나를 안았다. [하아, 멜론 좋아하는데. 저기다 하몽 얹어서 와인 한 잔 하면 피로가 싹 가시는데….] 나는 입맛을 다셨다. 아빠가 얼른 감독에게 직접 탄 믹스 커피를 내밀었다. “감독님, 어쩐 일이세요?” “성국이가 요즘 엄청 핫한 거 아시죠?” “저희는 실감이 안 나요.” “그러실 만도 하죠. 오늘 제가 온 것은 다름이 아니라 성국이한테 제안을 하나 하려고요.” “제안이요?” 아빠가 되물었다. “이런 이야기 어려우실 수 있는데요. 지금 다른 광고 제안 들어와도 하지 마시고, 방송 하나를 하면 어떨까 해서요.” “광고도 더는 생각해보지 않았어요. 그런데 방송이라니….” [아빠, 원래 일이라는 것은 연달아 들어오는 법이야.] 나는 어깨를 으쓱했다. “이번에 MVC 방송국 일요일 저녁 버라이어티 쇼에서 새로 신설되는 거거든요. 한 번도 아이를 키워본 적 없는 어린 남자 가수들이 아이를 키우는 거예요. 거기 성국이가 메인이고요.” [아, 그거!] 나는 기억을 떠올렸다. 남자 아이돌 그룹이 어린아이를 키우는, 육아 프로그램의 시조새쯤 되는 거였다. 물론 이건 당연히 해야 한다. 당대에는 물론, 후에도 무척이나 회자되는 육아 프로그램의 레전드였다. 아빠의 표정이 점점 어두워졌다. “감독님 제의는 감사하지만요….” 아빠는 말끝을 흐렸다. [아빠, 이건 아니지!] 나는 발버둥을 쳤지만, 아무도 내 이야기에 귀를 기울이진 않았다. 그렇다면! “으아앙! 으앙!” “성국아, 왜 그래?” 엄마가 얼른 나를 안았다. [왜 그러긴. 엄마, 아빠 좀 말려봐! 이건 내가 내 능력으로 따낸 황금 같은 기회라고!] 아빠는 생각한 말을 내뱉었다. “성국이가 자꾸 방송을 타면 다른 아이들과 다르게 자랄까 봐 걱정이 돼서요.” 나는 잠시 울음을 멈췄다. 의외의 대답인걸? 감독은 깊게 고개를 끄덕였다. “아버님, 고민 이해됩니다. 아무래도 방송에 노출되다 보면 사람들이 많이 알아보고 아이도 그 시선 속에서 자라게 되니까요.” 아빠는 고개를 끄덕였다. “저는 평범하게 아이를 키우고 싶습니다.” “하지만 아버님. 성국이는 정말 제가 본 다른 애들과 다릅니다. 외모도 외모지만, 타고난 재능이라는 게 보여요. 스스로 빛날 줄 아는 아이 같다는 말씀입니다. 그리고 요즘 부모들은 이런 방송 못 내보내서 난리거든요. 아이도 유명해지고 돈도 되니까요.” “…사실은 저희 부부가 모두 고아원에서 자랐거든요.” “아….” 감독은 놀라 아무 말도 못 했다. 아빠는 담담히 말을 이었다. “그래서 남의 손에 애를 맡기고 싶지 않았어요. 어릴 때만큼은 엄마, 아빠 사랑 듬뿍 받고 자라야 하는 거잖아요. 부족한 저희한테 찾아온 생명인데, 그래야 하잖아요.” 나는 주먹을 앙 쥐고 입을 틀어막았다. 눈시울이 뜨거워지는 것을 겨우 참아내고 있었다. [이번 생의 부모는 왜케 사연이 구구절절한 거야.] 감독도 어느새 붉어진 눈시울을 두 손으로 꾹 눌렀다. 나는 겨우 정신을 차리고 엄마 품을 벗어나 아빠에게 기어갔다. 아빠의 마음을 전부는 알 수 없지만, 아주 조금은 알 것 같았다. 하지만 이건 비즈니스이다. 나는 얼른 아빠의 무릎 나온 바지를 물고 뜯었다. [아빠, 지금도 사랑은 충분해. 돈이 많으면 더 많은 사랑을 줄 수도 있어!] 돈과 사랑의 비례는 일정할 때 최상의 시너지를 낸다. 돈이 너무 많아지거나, 사랑이 너무 많아지면 그때부터 문제가 생기는 법이다. 감독은 잠긴 목을 풀더니 아빠를 쳐다봤다. “아버님 뜻은 잘 알겠습니다.” [감독, 이렇게 포기하면 안 돼!] 감독은 나를 흘깃 보더니 다시 말을 이었다. “아버님, 그래도 한 번 잘 생각해 보세요. 두 분 사정 들으니 알 것 같지만, 부모님이 이렇게 사랑하고 생각해 주는데, 잠시 방송하는 건 크게 문제 될 것 없어 보이거든요. 출연도도 적지는 않을 거고요.” “저희는 돈 때문이 아니라요.” 아빠는 어렵게 말을 꺼냈다. 우리 아빠, 엄마의 행색을 보면 누구든 형편이 어렵다는 것은 단번에 알 수 있다. 나는 엄마의 허리를 꼭 껴안았다. [엄마, 걱정하지 마. 내가 10년 안에 부자 만들어 줄 테니까.] 감독이 엄마에게 안긴 나를 보더니 배시시 웃었다. “이런 말씀 이상할지 모르지만… 성국이는 진짜 사람 말 알아듣는 거 같아요. 아무튼 제가 오늘 드릴 제안은 이거였어요. 방송국 오디션을 보시는 게 어떻겠냐는 거죠. 대신, 이 방송 조건에 6개월 동안은 광고 금지예요.” 나는 얼른 아빠의 등짝을 팡팡 쳤다. [아빠, 이거야!] 아빠가 나를 내려다봤다. “성국이, 하고 싶어?” “네에!” 나는 자신 있게 대답했다. * * * 지금 내 눈앞에는 회귀 전에 내가 즐겨 듣던 <너만을 원해>를 부른 국민 아이돌 그룹 ‘저스트’ 다섯 명이 있었다. 물론 지금은 무명에서 조금 벗어난 신생 그룹 수준이었다. 이 녀석들은 몇 년 후에 엄청나게 성공해서 국민 아이돌 그룹이 된다. [내 열두 살 생일에 와서 노래도 부른 녀석들인데….] 나는 그날을 떠올렸다. 삼전 호텔의 가장 큰 연회장에서 열린 내 열두 살 생일에는 ‘저스트’뿐 아니라 막 떠오르는 여자 아이돌 그룹도 모두 참석했다. 그들의 첫 멘트는 이거였다. “전성국 도련님, 열두 번째 생일 축하드립니다!” 모두들 나와 아이 컨택 하려고 애썼었는데…. ‘저스트’ 멤버들은 나중에 나이를 먹은 후에 사석에서 몇 번 마주치기도 했다. 아이돌들이 대부분 그렇듯 몇은 배우, 몇은 생계형 방송인이 된다. 먼저 리더인 태형이 나에게 다가왔다. ‘저스트’는 본명을 쓰는 멤버도 있었고, 영어 이름을 쓰는 멤버도 있었다. “네가 아빠! 그 모델이구나. 형도 그 광고 봤어.” 리더이자 메인 래퍼인 태형은 잘생긴 얼굴에 토종 한국인임에도 불구하고 영어를 곧잘 해서 팀에서 브레인으로 통했다. 나중에 의류 사업 한다며 나대던 기억이 나는데, 인성도 크게 나쁘지 않고, 자기 이익은 잘 챙기는 스타일이라 재벌가의 먼 친척쯤 되는 여자랑 결혼해서 잘 산다. 그 뒤로 키가 유난히 큰 루카스가 다가왔다. 루카스는 덩치에 비해 웃는 모습은 순수해 보였다. 순진한 웃음에 근육질 몸매. 근육돌의 시초쯤 되는 녀석인데, 생긴 것처럼 성격도 단순한 체대 오빠 스타일로 여자들에게 인기가 많았다. “와, 장난 아니게 이쁘게 생겼네. 우리보다 성국이가 더 주목받겠는걸.” [그거야 당연한 말씀. 두고 보라고!]","output":"Episode 9 Dad came home after 11 PM, having had another drink with the bossam (Korean boiled pork wrap) restaurant owner. Today, his hands were full of various things. \\"Honey, what's all that?\\" \\"The boss gave us all sorts of things. He's been bragging to the customers about the commercial you were in all day. Sales even doubled compared to other days.\\" \\"The boss is really a good person.\\" \\"Look at this. Seeing Seong-guk eat bossam meat so well earlier, he even packed some of the meat they use at the restaurant for us.\\" I was half-asleep, listening to Mom and Dad's conversation. Dad continued to boast about various things afterward. He was energized all day thanks to the commercial I was in, and the boss praised him, saying his homemade bossam almost matched the taste of the restaurant's. It was a trivial story. \\"Honey, the boss said he's been doing so well since switching to a bossam restaurant that he's going to raise your salary by 100,000 won starting next month.\\" \\"100,000 won! Seong-guk must really be a lucky charm. Ever since Seong-guk was born, things have been going well for you, and I'm so happy.\\" Mom was moved, holding Dad's hand tightly over just 100,000 won. What can you do with 100,000 won? Maybe barely afford a dinner at Samjeon Hotel. As I rubbed my sleepy eyes, Dad approached me. \\"Seong-guk, you're not asleep?\\" [Technically, I was asleep. You woke me up because you were loud.] \\"So-young, should we give Seong-guk his present now?\\" Ah, there was a present. At that mention, my eyes sparkled. [I'm a former chaebol, why am I living so modestly?] Dad rummaged through his old handbag and pulled out something small and thin, holding it up in front of me. [What, a bankbook?] I grumbled in disappointment. \\"Seong-guk, see this? It's a bankbook. The money you earned from the commercial modeling, we've saved it all in your name. See, it's under your name, Jeon Seong-guk.\\" Dad showed me the bankbook created under the name 'Jeon Seong-guk.' It was a bankbook where not a single penny of the modeling fee was missing. Even the 50,000 won received for transportation on the audition day was saved. [Mom, Dad, are you fools? Why would you save all this money! We should move to a better place, or at least buy new clothes for Mom and Dad who wear the same clothes every day!] I yelled, but soon my eyes moistened. After taxes, it was barely less than 4 million won. Before regression, this amount was just enough for a meal or not even enough for a night's drinking for me. But for them, this money was half a year's salary for a man working from morning till night at a restaurant. And now, they've saved all that money under my name without spending a penny. \\"Seong-guk, this is all your money because you earned it. Mom and Dad didn't touch any of it. When you grow up and go to school, if there's anything you want to learn, Mom and Dad will let you do it.\\" [Stop making me cry!] My throat was tight. \\"Honey, I think Seong-guk really understands us. His eyes are getting red.\\" \\"So-young, Seong-guk seems to be really emotional. That's probably why he acts so well.\\" I rubbed my small hands over my face. Dad held my hand. \\"Seong-guk, you'll hurt your face if you do that. Our star.\\" [Who asked you to make me cry!] \\"Honey, Seong-guk seems sleepy because he woke up. I'll hold him.\\" \\"No, So-young. You're pregnant and it's hard for you. I'll hold him.\\" Dad held me and soon patted my back. He had been working all day at the restaurant and now he was holding me. \\"Seong-guk, you're really a blessing to us, who grew up in an orphanage without knowing our parents or siblings. Mom and Dad are still very young and lacking, but we'll try our best to live so that Seong-guk can grow up without lacking anything. Seong-guk, we love you.\\" I secretly swallowed my tears. Did I have someone this warm in my life before regression? Even my parents thought of me not as their child but as the heir to Samjeon Group, preferring harsh discipline over warm words. People around me only tried to show off to me, thinking of ways to take advantage of the fact that I was the heir to Samjeon Group. I hugged Dad tightly. And I shouted that one word from the commercial. \\"Dad?\\" \\"So-young, did you hear?\\" Dad looked at Mom with an excited face. Mom patted my bottom. \\"Honey! Our Seong-guk, he really does well, doesn't he?\\" \\"So-young, actually... I've been worried for a while because Seong-guk doesn't talk much to us.\\" Until recently, they were just surrogates taking care of me as I grew up. \\"I thought maybe I was lacking as a father, and I felt unworthy, but now I feel relieved.\\" \\"Honey, don't think like that. Our Seong-guk is the best at saying 'Dad' in the world.\\" \\"Looks like Seong-guk is asleep.\\" It seemed like I should pretend to be asleep at times like this. I have some sense, too. A twenty-three-year-old dad and an even younger mom. They seemed to need their own time. I quietly closed my eyes."},{"instruction":"What is an approximate extraction efficiency (yield %) of cellulose from mango peel?","output":"As of my last update in April 2023, specific studies on the exact yield percentage of cellulose extraction from mango peel may vary due to the methodology used, the condition of the raw material (e.g., ripeness, variety of mango), and the processing parameters (e.g., temperature, solvent used, time). However, to give you a general idea, cellulose extraction from agricultural waste products, including fruit peels like mango, typically yields a cellulose content that could range from about 20% to 60% of the dry weight of the processed material, depending on the specifics of the method applied (such as chemical treatment, mechanical processing, etc.). In research literature, yields of cellulose specifically from mango peel are less commonly detailed compared to more broadly categorized biomass sources. However, it's reasonable to extrapolate based on similar materials. For example, extraction processes involving alkali treatments followed by bleaching tend to result in higher purity and yield of cellulose by removing lignin and hemicellulose components effectively. For a more precise yield percentage specific to mango peel, one would need to refer to targeted studies or experimentations that detail the exact procedures used, including the pre-treatment of the peels, the chemicals employed (e.g., sodium hydroxide for alkali treatment, various bleaching agents), their concentrations, and the conditions of the extraction process (time, temperature, etc.). If you are looking into a particular application or experimental setup, I would recommend reviewing current scientific publications or conducting a series of empirical tests to determine the most efficient method for cellulose extraction from mango peels under those specific conditions."},{"instruction":"hi","output":"Hello!

However, in cases where feature scaling is necessary or beneficial (e.g., when features have different units or varying ranges), various scalers besides \`StandardScaler\` can be used depending on the nature of your data and the specific requirements of your model. Here are a few common scalers from scikit-learn that you can use apart from \`StandardScaler\`: 1. **MinMaxScaler:** - Scales the data to a specified range (usually [0, 1]). - It is useful when you need to transform features to a given range and maintain the distribution. \`\`\`python from sklearn.preprocessing import MinMaxScaler scaler = MinMaxScaler(feature_range=(0, 1)) \`\`\` 2. **RobustScaler:** - Scales the data according to the interquartile range (IQR). - It is useful for data with outliers, as it uses the median and quartiles, which are robust to outliers. \`\`\`python from sklearn.preprocessing import RobustScaler scaler = RobustScaler() \`\`\` 3. **MaxAbsScaler:** - Scales each feature by its maximum absolute value. - This scaler is meant for data that is already centered at zero or sparse data. \`\`\`python from sklearn.preprocessing import MaxAbsScaler scaler = MaxAbsScaler() \`\`\` 4. **PowerTransformer:** - Applies a power transformation to each feature to make the data more Gaussian-like. - Useful for modeling issues related to heteroscedasticity or non-normal distributions. \`\`\`python from sklearn.preprocessing import PowerTransformer scaler = PowerTransformer(method='yeo-johnson') # or method='box-cox' \`\`\` 5. **QuantileTransformer:** - Transforms the features to follow a uniform or a normal distribution. - It is useful for mitigating the effects of outliers and transforming non-linear features. \`\`\`python from sklearn.preprocessing import QuantileTransformer scaler = QuantileTransformer(output_distribution='uniform') \`\`\` 6. **Normalizer:** - Scales individual samples to have unit norm. - It can be useful for sparse datasets (lots of zeros) with features of varying scales when using algorithms that are sensitive to the scale of the data. \`\`\`python from sklearn.preprocessing import Normalizer scaler = Normalizer(norm='l2') \`\`\` When choosing a scaler, consider the distribution and nature of your data, the presence of outliers, and how your model responds to different feature scales. Sometimes, it might be helpful to experiment with different scalers and evaluate your model's performance to choose the best scaler for your specific dataset and use case."},{"instruction":"how i can use them, without the model code","output":"Certainly! You can use these scalers to preprocess your data independently from your model code. The preprocessing step is typically done before feeding the data into any model, including an XGBRegressor or any other machine learning algorithm. Here's a general approach on how to apply a scaler to your dataset without tying it directly to model training code: 1. **Select and Import the Scaler:** First, choose the scaler you wish to use (e.g., \`MinMaxScaler\`, \`RobustScaler\`) and import it from \`sklearn.preprocessing\`. 2. **Fit the Scaler:** Use the \`.fit()\` method on your training data to allow the scaler to learn the parameters (mean and scale for \`StandardScaler\`, min and max for \`MinMaxScaler\`, etc.). 3. **Transform the Data:** With the fitted scaler, you can now transform your training data using the \`.transform()\` method. To avoid data leakage, remember that the scaler should be fitted only on the training set, then applied to any test or unseen data with the parameters learned from the training set. 4. **Inverse Transform (Optional):** If needed, for example, to interpret model output back in the original scale, you can use the scaler's \`.inverse_transform()\` function. Below is an example demonstrating how to use the \`MinMaxScaler\`. The same steps apply to other scalers, with the only difference being the scaler you choose to import and use. \`\`\`python from sklearn.preprocessing import MinMaxScaler import numpy as np import pandas as pd # Example dataset data = np.array([[1, -1, 2], [2, 0, 0], [0, 1, -1]]) # Convert to DataFrame for better visualization df = pd.DataFrame(data, columns=['Feature1', 'Feature2', 'Feature3']) # Initialize the Scaler scaler = MinMaxScaler() # Fit the scaler to the data - learns the min and max values of the data scaler.fit(df) # Transform the data using the fitted scaler df_scaled = scaler.transform(df) # Convert scaled data back to DataFrame for better visualization df_scaled = pd.DataFrame(df_scaled, columns=['Feature1', 'Feature2', 'Feature3']) print(\\"Original Data:n\\", df) print(\\"nScaled Data:n\\", df_scaled) \`\`\` Remember to apply the same \`fit\` from your training data to scale any new or test data using the \`.transform()\` method without fitting again.

Below is an example workflow in Python using \`scikit-learn\` that demonstrates how to split data into training and test sets, fit a scaler to the training data, and then transform both the training and test data sets. We'll use \`MinMaxScaler\` in this example, but the process is the same for any scaler you choose. If you have not installed \`scikit-learn\`, you can install it using pip: \`\`\`bash pip install scikit-learn \`\`\` Here's how to split your data and apply scaling: \`\`\`python from sklearn.model_selection import train_test_split from sklearn.preprocessing import MinMaxScaler import numpy as np import pandas as pd # Example dataset - Let's say X represents your features and y represents your target variable X = np.array([[1, -1, 2], [2, 0, 0], [0, 1, -1], [1, 2, 3], [2, 1, 0], [3, -1, -2]]) y = np.array([1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6]) # Splitting dataset into training and testing set X_train, X_test, y_train, y_test = train_test_split(X, y, test_size=0.2, random_state=42) # Initialize the Scaler scaler = MinMaxScaler() # Fit the scaler to the training data only scaler.fit(X_train) # Transform both the training and the test set using the fit scaler X_train_scaled = scaler.transform(X_train) X_test_scaled = scaler.transform(X_test) # Convert scaled arrays back to DataFrame for better visualization if necessary df_train_scaled = pd.DataFrame(X_train_scaled, columns=['Feature1', 'Feature2', 'Feature3']) df_test_scaled = pd.DataFrame(X_test_scaled, columns=['Feature1', 'Feature2', 'Feature3']) print(\\"Scaled Training Data:n\\", df_train_scaled) print(\\"nScaled Testing Data:n\\", df_test_scaled) \`\`\` In this example: - We created an example dataset \`X\` with features and \`y\` with target values. - We used \`train_test_split\` to split \`X\` and \`y\` into training and testing sets, with 20% of the data reserved for testing. - We instantiated a \`MinMaxScaler\`, then fit it only to the training data using \`scaler.fit(X_train)\`. It learns the minimum and maximum values of the features in \`X_train\`. - Next, we used the fitted scaler to transform both \`X_train\` and \`X_test\`. This ensures that the transformation applied to the test data is based on the parameters learned from the training data, preventing data leakage. - Finally, converted the scaled numpy arrays back to pandas DataFrames for better readability and inspection. This step is optional and depends on your preference and the requirements of your workflow. Remember, the choice of scaler (\`MinMaxScaler\` in this case) depends on your data and the requirements of your model or analysis. The same process applies if you choose to use another scaler like \`StandardScaler\`, \`RobustScaler\`, etc."},{"instruction":"ValueError: X has 10 features, but LinearRegression is expecting 285 features as input.","output":"The error you're encountering, \\"ValueError: X has 10 features, but LinearRegression is expecting 285 features as input,\\" typically occurs when there is a discrepancy in the number of features between training and prediction phases in a machine learning model, specifically a Linear Regression model in this scenario. This can happen for a few reasons, most commonly due to: 1. **Data Preprocessing Differences:** Perhaps during the training phase, you performed certain preprocessing steps that altered the number of features. These could include one-hot encoding, polynomial feature expansions, adding interaction terms, or any feature engineering steps that increase the number of features in your dataset. 2. **Feature Selection/Reduction Not Applied Consistently:** If you've used techniques like PCA, LDA, or any feature selection method that reduces or alters the number of features, you need to ensure that the same transformation is applied to any new data before making predictions. 3. **Incomplete Data or Incorrect Data Handling:** There might be an issue with how the data is being loaded or processed before prediction. For example, missing preprocessing steps applied during training but forgotten during prediction. To resolve this issue, make sure that: - The exact same preprocessing steps (including all feature engineering transformations) are applied to the new data (the data you're trying to predict on) as were applied to the training data. - If you're using pipelines, ensure that the pipeline that includes the preprocessing steps and the model is fitted on the training data and then used to predict on the new data. This ensures consistency in the preprocessing steps. Here's an illustrative example of ensuring consistency using a pipeline with \`LinearRegression\` and a simple feature preprocessing step: \`\`\`python from sklearn.model_selection import train_test_split from sklearn.linear_model import LinearRegression from sklearn.preprocessing import StandardScaler from sklearn.pipeline import make_pipeline import pandas as pd import numpy as np # Simulated Data np.random.seed(0) X = np.random.randn(100, 10) # 100 examples, 10 features y = np.dot(X, np.random.randn(10)) + np.random.randn(100) # Random linear-like target # Split the data X_train, X_test, y_train, y_test = train_test_split(X, y, test_size=0.2, random_state=42) # Create a Pipeline pipe = make_pipeline(StandardScaler(), LinearRegression()) # Fit the model with the Pipeline pipe.fit(X_train, y_train) # Now you can predict with the same preprocessing steps included y_pred = pipe.predict(X_test) # Everything should work without errors, the pipeline ensures preprocessing steps # are applied consistently during both training and prediction. \`\`\` In your case, double-check all the preprocessing steps leading up to the point where you train your \`LinearRegression\` model. Ensure that the same steps are precisely applied to any new data before prediction. If you are using feature generation methods (like one-hot encoding, polynomial features, etc.), those must be included as well."},{"instruction":"is there a model for data like mostly zero and other parabola","output":"When dealing with data that primarily consists of zeros but also contains patterns like a parabola among the non-zero values, you’re tackling two challenges: sparsity and non-linear relationships. Choosing the right model to handle such data efficiently depends on the specifics of your data and your project goals. Here is a layered strategy to approach this kind of scenario: # 1. Handling Sparsity For sparse data (data with a lot of zeros), models that can naturally handle or even take advantage of sparsity are often a good choice. Some examples include: - **Tree-based models** (like Decision Trees, Random Forests, and Gradient Boosting Machines, including XGBoost and LightGBM): These models naturally handle sparsity well because they make decisions based on whether or not a condition is true, effectively separating zeros from non-zeros in their split decisions. - **Sparse Linear Models** (like Lasso Regression): These models are tailored for scenarios where sparsity is a feature of the data. For instance, Lasso (Least Absolute Shrinkage and Selection Operator) regression can favor solutions with fewer parameter values, effectively making it work well with sparse features by ignoring the less relevant ones. # 2. Capturing Non-linear Relationships The parabolic relationship indicates a non-linear association between the features and the target variable. Several machine learning models and techniques are adept at capturing such non-linearities: - **Polynomial Features and Linear Models**: One way to fit a model to a parabolic relationship is to engineer polynomial features (e.g., squared or cubic terms of your original features) and then use a linear model, like linear regression or Lasso, to capture the non-linear relationship. - **Kernel-based Methods**: For example, Support Vector Machines (SVM) with non-linear kernels (like the radial basis function or polynomial kernel) can model non-linear relationships without explicitly adding polynomial features. - **Neural Networks**: These are powerful tools for modeling complex non-linear relationships. Even a simple feedforward neural network with a few layers can capture a parabolic relationship, given enough data and appropriate regularization to prevent overfitting. - **Tree-based Models**: As mentioned, tree-based algorithms can also capture non-linear relationships between features and the target variable, making them a versatile choice for both sparsity and non-linear patterns. # Approach Given your data characteristics: 1. **Explore the Data**: Start with visualizations and descriptive analytics to understand the exact nature of the zeros and the parabolic relationships. Are the zeros truly zeros, or do they represent missing or undefined values? 2. **Preprocess**: Depending on the nature of zeros, preprocessing steps might be required. For instance, if zeros are significant and represent actual measurements (not missing data), then models that handle sparsity naturally should be prioritized. 3. **Feature Engineering**: For the parabolic relationship, consider polynomial feature engineering if opting for linear models or kernels. For tree-based methods and neural networks, raw features might suffice, as these models can inherently capture non-linearities. 4. **Model Selection**: Start with models known to handle sparsity well and can model non-linear relationships, such as tree-based methods. If computational resources allow, also experiment with neural networks, but be mindful of the risk of overfitting, especially if your dataset is not very large. 5. **Validation and Testing**: Use proper cross-validation techniques to evaluate the performance of your models. Given the sparsity and non-linearity, pay close attention to how your model performs on both the sparse zero areas and the non-zero parabolic data sections. This helps ensure that your model generalizes well across the entire dataset. 6. **Iterative Improvement**: Machine learning is an iterative process. Based on initial results, you might revisit preprocessing, feature engineering, or try different models to improve performance. Remember, choosing the right model and approach depends heavily on your specific data and the context of your problem. It often requires experimentation and validation to find the best strategy."},{"instruction":"get me a code for a poly regression model","output":"To create a polynomial regression model, you can use scikit-learn's \`PolynomialFeatures\` in combination with a linear regression model like \`LinearRegression\`.

[하아….] 나는 한숨을 한 번 더 내쉬었다. 이 가게에 미래 같은 것은 없어 보였다. 막 테이블을 치우고 있던 중년의 남자가 우리를 반겼다. “성국이 엄마 왔네.” “사장님, 잘 계셨어요?” “아이고, 이 녀석이 복덩이 성국이구나.” 아빠가 주방 안에서 고개를 삐죽 내밀었다. “소영아, 왔어?” “응, 자기야.” [아빠!] 나는 손을 들어 흔들었다. 저 사람이 바로 나의 이유식과 기저귀를 책임지고 있는 이 집의 가장이다, 뭐 이런 의미였다. “성국아, 아빠 곧 나갈 테니까 조금만 기다려. 소영아, TV 앞에 빈자리에 앉아.” “응.” 엄마는 TV 앞 빈자리에 앉았다. 손을 닦고 온 사장이 얼른 달려오더니 내 이마를 쓰다듬었다. “지성 씨가 맨날 자랑하던데. 사진보다 실물이 백배는 더 이쁘네요.” [당연한 말씀을….] 내가 히죽거리자 사장은 얼른 자리에서 일어나더니 냉장고로 향했다. “성국이는 아직 보쌈 같은 거 못 먹으니 바나나 좀 사다놨어요.” “이유식 먹고 왔어요. 안 그러셔도 되는데요.” “지성 씨 없으면 우리 가게 안 돌아가요. 지성 씨가 우리 집 보쌈이 맛있다고 주막에서 보쌈 전문점으로 바꾸자고 해서 바꿔서 그나마 요즘 숨통 트였잖아.” 나는 주방에서 일하는 아빠를 다시 봤다. 그러고 보니 가게 인테리어가 일반 보쌈집 같지는 않았다. 한옥 스타일의 고풍스러운 인테리어. 사이사이 걸려 있는 조잡한 그림이나 소품들. TV 드라마에서 돈 없는 서민들이 막걸리나 마시는 주점 분위기였다. 사장은 들뜬 목소리로 연신 말을 이었다. “손님들이 보쌈 맛있다고 해도 이거 하나로 승부 볼 생각은 못 했거든. 근데 지성 씨가 메인 메뉴로 보쌈 두고, 술안주 몇 개만 남기고 정리하는 게 이윤도 더 많이 남고 테이블 회전도 빠를 거라고 강력하게 주장해서 바꾸고 나서 정말 잘되고 있어요.” 사장은 내 앞에 바나나를 까서 내밀었다. 엄마가 얼른 작게 잘라서 내 입에 밀어 넣었다. “성국아, 천천히 먹어.” [이가 성치 못해서 빨리도 못 먹어.] 나는 이제 막 나기 시작한 앞니 두 개로 바나나를 잘라먹었다. 손님들이 연이어 밀려들어 왔다. “사장님, 가서 일 보세요.” “그럼, 광고 시작할 때 같이 봐요.” 사장은 얼른 손님을 맞았고, 엄마와 나는 TV를 보며 광고를 기다렸다. 주방에서 구수한 냄새가 흘러나왔다. 킁킁. [맛있겠다.] 나도 모르게 입가에 침이 흘렀다. [전성국, 왜 이래. 품위 없게.] 갑자기 바나나가 하찮아 보였다. 엄마가 나를 보더니 안아 들었다. “성국아, 바나나 별로야?” [보쌈!] 나는 주방을 손가락으로 가리켰다. “어? 보쌈 달라고?” 끄덕. 무거운 고개를 힘차게 끄덕였다. 동시에 아빠가 그릇 가득 잘 익은 돼지고기를 들고 나왔다. “자기야, 성국이가 보쌈 달라는데.” “성국이도 돌 지났으니까, 연한 살코기는 먹어도 될 것 같아서 조금 삶았어.” [역시 아빠!] 나는 까르르 웃으며 손바닥을 마구 쳤다. 사장은 나를 보곤 함박 미소를 지었다. “엄마, 아빠 닮아서 아주 인물이 좋아. 성국아, 나중에 잘되면 우리 보쌈집 모델 해줄 거지?” [보쌈집 모델은 사양할게, 사장. 내 품위에 안 어울린다고.] “당연하죠, 사장님. 그땐 돈도 안 받을게요.” [내 인생에 공짜는 없어, 아빠.] 사장은 얼른 다른 테이블의 서빙을 마치고는 아빠를 의자에 앉혔다. “아들 첫 광고인데, 같이 봐야지.” 이때, 옆에서 우리 대화를 들은 손님들이 물었다. “누가 광고 찍었어요?” “요 녀석이 이번에 삼전 전자 광고 찍었어요. 우리 식당 매니저 아들이에요. 이쁘죠?” 사장이 얼른 설명을 덧붙였다. “그럼, 우리도 광고 보고 먹게 천천히 줘요.” “그래도 될까요?” “대신 얼른 술이나 주세요. 축배 들어야죠.” “제가 오늘 손님들한테 소주 한 병씩 서비스로 다 드릴게요!” 보쌈집 사장은 냉장고에서 소주를 꺼내 테이블로 날랐다. 아빠도 얼른 손을 걷어붙이고 도왔다. 이때, 한 손님이 소리 질렀다. “TV 가리지 말고, 두 사람도 어서 앉아요.” 아빠가 위생 모자를 벗으며 엄마 앞에 앉았다. 내 광고가 나오기 5분 전이었다. “사장님도 어서 오세요. 같이 봐야죠.” “당연하지.” 사장은 냉장고에서 소주까지 꺼내와 자리에 앉았다. 모두 들뜬 얼굴로 TV를 주시했다. “자기랑 이렇게 보니까 너무 좋다. 우리 성국이 이쁘게 나오겠지?” “나도 궁금해 죽겠어. 오늘 하루 종일 일이 손에 제대로 안 잡혔다니까.” 후루룩. 후루룩. 나는 어느새 아빠가 삶은 야들야들한 보쌈 고기를 쪽쪽 빨고 있었다. 대한민국 최고의 셰프들이 한 고기 요리를 모두 섭렵한 내 입맛에도 꽤 훌륭한 맛이었다.

TV에 드디어 빨래 바구니를 든 임선미가 등장했다. 그리고 익숙한 내용이 흐르고, 드디어 내 목소리가 흘러나왔다! - 아빠? 가게 안은 잠시 정적이 흘렀다. 아빠와 엄마는 감격에 겨운 얼굴로 보쌈 고기를 쪽쪽 빨고 있는 나를 쳐다봤다. [뭐 이런 걸로 감격하긴.] 나는 어깨를 으쓱했다. 사장이 내 머리를 마구 쓰다듬었다. “아이고, 이뻐라. 우리 성국이 TV로 보니까 더 이쁘네!” [귀찮았지만, 아버지의 보스니 내 보스기도 하니 좀 웃어줄게.] 히죽히죽. “웃으니까 더 이쁘네. 나도 저 통돌이 세탁기로 이번에 바꿔야겠네.” “엄마, 아빠 인물도 워낙 좋아서, 커서도 이 녀석 한 인물 하겠어.” “여자 여러 명 울리겠네.” 가게에 있던 손님들도 한마디씩 했다. “기분이다. 보쌈 포장도 하나 해주세요. 집에서 공부할 우리 아들 가져다줘야겠네.” 주문까지 밀려들었다. 사장은 얼른 자리에서 일어났다. “지성 씨, 내가 주방은 잠시 볼 테니 먹고 들어와.” “아니에요. 저도 성국이한테 인사만 하고 곧 갈게요.” 아빠가 나를 안아 들어 등을 도닥였다. “우리 성국이 장하다. 장해.” [나, 전성국이야.] “알지, 알지. 고생 많이 했어. 아빠가 우리 성국이 선물 사줘야 할 것 같은데. 뭐가 좋을까.” [선물?] 돌이 갓 지난 나에게 필요한 건 딱히 없었다. 고작해야 전복과 소고기가 가득 들어간 이유식뿐이었다. 그래도 선물을 준다니 살짝 흥분됐다. 회귀 전에 나에게 주어진 선물은 이런 거였다. 열 살 생일 파티를 놀이동산 통째로 빌려서 하기. 대학 입학 선물로 강남 최고가 주상복합 펜트하우스 독립. 한도 없는 신용 카드. 차와 시계는 수시로 선물받아서 선물이라고 생각도 되지 않을 지경이었다. 그렇다면 이 가난한 엄마와 아빠가 나에게 해줄 선물은 뭘까? 나, 기대해도 될까?","output":"Episode 8 While gobbling down the baby food, the girl with the bob haircut was tearing into a chicken leg. Mom was beside her, only eating the dry breast meat, mindful of the landlord's watchful eyes. The girl with the bob haircut offered the remaining leg to Mom. \\"Eat this.\\" \\"You eat it, sis. I'm okay.\\" \\"Stop torturing yourself with that dry meat and eat this. I've had enough.\\" \\"Thank you.\\" Only then did Mom accept the leg. Even as I slurped down my baby food, I watched the girl with the bob haircut. If only I had more teeth and could control my tongue better, I would have asked her outright... It was frustrating. \\"But sis, why are you so nice to us?\\" [Mom, you're not entirely naive. That's exactly what I wanted to ask!] I rubbed my sleepy eyes and focused on their conversation. \\"It reminds me of myself.\\" \\"Why you?\\" \\"When I was in my early 20s, I really had nothing. I graduated from a women's commercial high school and got into the accounting department of my current company. Back then, there were many like me, but now I'm the only one left.\\" So that's why she's been a manager forever. Come to think of it, including Mom and Dad, there was no one in this house who had been to college. Before regression, going to college and even studying abroad were standard for my family. I was fluent in English, French, and Japanese, and I could hold a conversation in German and Chinese. My friends and colleagues were at least as educated as I was, if not more. The only high school graduates I knew were idols or artists with exceptional talent. \\"Sis, if you don't mind me asking, how did you manage to get this house just by working? You're amazing.\\" \\"Amazing? I got it through an auction.\\" \\"Auction?\\" [Auction... Is that like acquiring a bankrupt company or something?] The girl with the bob haircut continued in a calm tone. \\"My parents passed away early, and I have no siblings. So, I thought I needed money and saved up my salary obsessively to participate in auctions. I started with a basement studio and worked my way up to here.\\" \\"That's incredible, sis! Can you teach me too? Sunguk's dad works hard too, but when Sunguk grows up, I want to try doing various jobs.\\" [Hmm, real estate.] I stroked my chin with my short fingers. Although I wasn't born with a silver spoon, there are only two things you need to do well in South Korea. Real estate and stocks. It was the only way for someone from a poor background to taste a bit of a golden spoon. I perked up my ears. I had heard of auctions, but I never had to buy a house through one. It was never necessary. But now, born into a poor family, I needed to know everything to lift us out of poverty. \\"Sunguk's family is expecting a second child soon. Let's save up and get a house quickly. You know, being a baby model isn't something to scoff at. Some baby models, starting with commercials, can earn as much as our manager's annual salary in a month.\\" \\"Wow, that's a whole new world.\\" Mom, holding a chicken leg, was amazed. I was right. A monthly salary of 500,000 won. Dust gathered is still dust. To lift this poor household, I had to step up. But why am I so sleepy? My heavy head kept diving towards the ground. Mom quickly picked me up. \\"Sunguk, we need to wash up and sleep...\\" [I'm sleepy. I can't do anything.] \\"Sunguk, let's just brush our teeth.\\" [I can't. I can't.] The girl with the bob haircut smiled at me. \\"Sunguk really seems to understand everything Mom and Dad say.\\" [Of course... I understand everything. Be careful... girl with the bob haircut.] * * * The commercial was scheduled to air two weeks after the shoot, as the director personally informed us. It was right before a weekend drama that nearly reached a 50% viewership rating. Mom and I decided to watch the commercial at Dad's workplace, as he couldn't take the weekend off. It was my first time visiting Dad's workplace. Finally, an opportunity to see Dad's financial situation and working conditions firsthand. Mom, holding her swollen belly, stopped several times before pausing in front of a small restaurant in a bustling area near our home. <Mr. Won's Bossam> [Sigh... With a name like that...] I couldn't help but sigh. As Mom opened the door and entered, the size of the restaurant was immediately apparent. It was a small establishment with only eight tables. The kitchen was located at the very back. Whether it was designed with a traditional Korean house in mind or not, the ceiling was adorned with rafters. The place was filled with tacky decorations. [Sigh...] I sighed again. There seemed to be no future in this restaurant. A middle-aged man, who was cleaning the tables, greeted us. \\"Ah, Sunguk's mom is here.\\" \\"Mr. Owner, how have you been?\\" \\"Ah, this must be the lucky charm, Sunguk.\\" Dad peeked out from the kitchen. \\"Soyoung, you're here?\\" \\"Yes, honey.\\" [Dad!] I waved my hand. This person was responsible for my baby food and diapers, the head of our household, so to speak. \\"Sunguk, I'll be out soon, so just wait a bit. Soyoung, take a seat in front of the TV.\\" \\"Okay.\\" Mom sat in front of the TV as instructed. The owner quickly came over and patted my forehead. \\"Jisung always brags about him. He's much cuter in person than in photos.\\" [Of course, you're stating the obvious...] As I grinned, the owner quickly got up and headed to the fridge. \\"Sunguk can't eat bossam yet, so I bought some bananas.\\" \\"We've already fed him baby food. You didn't have to.\\" \\"Jisung is indispensable to our restaurant. He said our bossam is the best, and it was his idea to switch from a tavern to a bossam specialty restaurant, which really helped us breathe a little easier.\\" I looked at Dad working in the kitchen again. Now that I think about it, the restaurant's interior didn't look like a typical bossam place. The traditional Korean house style, the rustic interior, and the tacky paintings and decorations scattered around... It felt like a tavern from a TV drama where poor commoners drink makgeolli. The owner continued excitedly. \\"Even though customers said our bossam was delicious, we never thought of competing with just that. But Jisung insisted on making bossam the main menu, keeping only a few side dishes for alcohol, saying it would be more profitable and tables would turn faster. And it really worked out well after we made the change.\\" The owner peeled a banana and offered it to me. Mom quickly cut it into small pieces and fed me. \\"Sunguk, eat slowly.\\" [I can't eat fast with these barely grown teeth.] I nibbled on the banana with my two barely emerged front teeth. Customers started pouring in. \\"Owner, go and take care of the customers.\\" \\"Alright, let's watch the commercial together later.\\" The owner hurriedly greeted the customers, and Mom and I waited for the commercial, watching TV. A savory smell wafted from the kitchen. [Smells delicious.] Saliva unknowingly dripped from my mouth. [Jeon Seonguk, what's with this lack of dignity?] Suddenly, the banana seemed so trivial. Mom looked at me and picked me up. \\"Sunguk, don't you like bananas?\\" [Bossam!] I pointed towards the kitchen. \\"Ah? You want bossam?\\" Nod. I vigorously nodded my heavy head. At that moment, Dad came out with a plate full of tenderly cooked pork. \\"Honey, Sunguk wants some bossam.\\" \\"Sunguk is over a year old now, so it should be fine for him to eat some tender meat. I boiled some just for him.\\" [That's my Dad!] I laughed heartily and clapped my hands. The owner smiled broadly at me. \\"Mom and Dad are both good-looking, so Sunguk is handsome too. Sunguk, will you be our bossam restaurant's model when you grow up?\\" [I'll pass on being a bossam restaurant model, owner. It doesn't suit my dignity.] \\"Of course, Mr. Owner. We won't even charge you then.\\" [There's no such thing as free in my life, Dad.] The owner quickly served other tables and then sat Dad down. \\"It's your son's first commercial, so we should watch it together.\\" At that moment, a customer who overheard our conversation asked. \\"Who filmed a commercial?\\" \\"This little guy here filmed a commercial for Samsung Electronics. He's the manager's son of our restaurant. Cute, isn't he?\\" The owner quickly added. \\"Then, let's watch the commercial before we eat.\\" \\"Is that okay?\\" \\"Just bring us some alcohol first. We need to toast.\\" \\"I'll give a bottle of soju to each table as a service today!\\" The bossam restaurant owner fetched soju from the fridge and rushed to the tables. Dad also rolled up his sleeves to help. Then, a customer shouted. \\"Don't block the TV, both of you sit down too.\\" Dad took off his hygiene cap and sat in front of Mom. My commercial was about to start in 5 minutes. \\"Mr. Owner, come sit too. We should watch it together.\\" \\"Of course.\\" The owner brought soju from the fridge and took a seat. Everyone watched the TV with excited faces. \\"It's so nice to watch this with you. Our Sunguk will look beautiful, right?\\" \\"I'm dying of curiosity. I couldn't focus on work all day.\\" Slurp. Slurp. I was already sucking on the tender bossam meat Dad had boiled. The taste was quite excellent, even to my palate, which had savored dishes from Korea's top chefs. [Dad, I'm not just saying this, but you seem to have a talent for cooking.] \\"Our Sunguk is babbling so much while looking at Dad.\\" \\"Honey, the drama has started. It's about to come on.\\" Everyone in the restaurant focused on the TV. Mom and Dad held my hands tightly, as if waiting for the World Cup final to start. Their hands were sweaty with anticipation. Finally, Lim Sunmi appeared on TV, holding a laundry basket. The familiar content flowed, and then my voice came out! - Dad? The restaurant fell silent for a moment. Mom and Dad, overwhelmed with emotion, looked at me sucking on the bossam meat. [What's there to be emotional about.] I shrugged my shoulders. The owner ruffled my hair. \\"Ah, so cute. Our Sunguk looks even cuter on TV!\\" [I'll smile a bit since you're Dad's boss, and thus my boss too.] Grin. Grin. \\"You're even cuter when you smile. I should switch to that drum washing machine too.\\" \\"Mom and Dad are both so good-looking, this kid will be quite the catch when he grows up.\\" \\"He'll break many hearts.\\" The other customers in the restaurant also chimed in. \\"I'm in a good mood. Please pack a serving of bossam for me. I'll take it home for my son who's studying.\\" Orders started to pile up. The owner quickly stood up. \\"Jisung, I'll take a look at the kitchen for a while, so go ahead and eat.\\" \\"No, I'll just greet Sunguk and then go.\\" Dad picked me up and patted my back. \\"Our Sunguk did great. Great job.\\" [I'm <PRESIDIO_ANONYMIZED_PERSON>.] \\"I know, I know. You worked hard. I think Dad should buy Sunguk a present. What would be good?\\" [A present?] There wasn't much I needed, barely a year after my birthday. At most, baby food filled with abalone and beef. But the idea of receiving a gift was slightly exciting. Before regression, the gifts given to me were like this: Renting an entire amusement park for my 10th birthday party. A penthouse in Gangnam's most expensive residential complex as a college entrance gift. A credit card with no limit. Cars and watches were given so frequently that they didn't even feel like gifts anymore. So, what could my poor mom and dad possibly give me as a gift? Can I, Jeon Seonguk, look forward to it?"},{"instruction":"제10화 “웃는 것도 장난 아니게 이쁘네. 나는 재현이야. 성국아. 잘 부탁해.” 눈웃음을 장착한 재현이 다가왔다. 재현은 꽃미남과로 인기가 많았는데, 나중에 복잡한 여자 문제로 여러 번 가십에 오르내린다. “안녕, 난 범선이야. 형이라고 불러라. 아니지, 형님인가. 그건 또 조폭 같나.” [어이, 범선! 오랜만이야.] 범선과 나랑은 꽤 인연이 있었다. 범선은 아이돌 사이에서 일명 배우상으로, 나중에 마초적인 매력의 배우로 성공적으로 전향한다. 삼전 그룹에서 후원하는 영화제에서 남우주연상을 수상하고 뒤풀이 자리에서 오래 술을 마신 기억이 있다. 술 매너도 좋고, 무엇보다 의리가 있었다. 삼전 그룹에서 후원하는 영화제라 평소라면 안 가던 뒤풀이도 갔었다. [이제 마지막 한 명이 남았는데….] “왓썹. 난 마이클이야. 잘 부탁해.” 건들건들한 포즈에 느끼한 면상. 거기다 이름도 버터 냄새 나는 마이클. 재미교포 출신인 이 녀석은 나중에 사고란 사고는 다 치고 다닌다. 여자와 돈 문제까지 얽히고 얽혀서 나름 국민 아이돌이란 칭호를 얻은 ‘저스트’의 얼굴에 먹칠하는 멤버이다. 마이클이 손으로 내 뺨을 슬쩍 건드렸다. 손가락에서 담배 냄새가 났다. [이 자식이 감히 담배 피운 손으로 날 건드려?!] 내가 미간을 찌푸리자 마이클이 어이없단 얼굴로 나를 봤다. “뭐야, 얘 나 싫어하나 봐.” 마이클은 혀 꼬부라진 말투로 나를 자극했다. 나는 고개를 휙 돌렸다. “너 담배 피우고 왔지? 나도 싫은데, 애는 좋겠니?” 리더인 태형이 핀잔을 주자, 마이클은 영어로 중얼거리며 구석에 찌그러졌다. 나는 다시 평온한 얼굴로 이들을 바라봤다. 엄마는 볼록 나온 배를 만지며 신기한 얼굴로 ‘저스트’를 보느라 정신없었다. 특히 잘생긴 범선을 넋 놓고 바라봤다. [엄마, 정신 차려!] 내가 잡아당기자 엄마는 얼른 정신을 차리고 나를 안았다. “성국아, 오빠들 진짜 잘생겼어.” [엄마보다도 어린 애도 있어.] 속내와 다르게 나는 고개를 끄덕이곤 비즈니스 대답을 해줬다. “응!” 이제 돌도 지나서 어색하지만 걷기도 시작했고, 옹알이를 벗어난 수준의 단어도 가끔 내뱉을 수 있게 혀가 돌아갔다. [엄마, 저 얼굴에 속으면 안 돼. 얼굴에 분칠하는 것들 말은 믿으면 안 된다는 말도 있잖아.] 엄마는 내 속도 모르고 저스트를 보며 싱글벙글 웃기만 했다. 감독이 들어오자 저스트가 일렬로 서서 동시에 꾸벅 인사를 했다. “안녕하세요! 대한민국 가요계를 이끌어갈 저스트입니다!” “반가워. 다들 이야기는 들었지?” “네.” 태형이 대표로 대답했다. “너희 숙소에서 3일 정도 촬영할 건데. 성국이는 아침 9시에 나와서 6시까지 촬영하고, 하루만 숙소에서 잘 거야. 그냥 생활 예능이니까, 최대한 자연스럽게. 나중에 편집으로 우리가 캐릭터는 다 만들어줄게.” “감사합니다! 감독님!” “숙소에서는 그렇게 각 잡지들 마. 옷들도 원래 입던 것들 입고. 메이크업도 최대한 하지 말고.” “네!” 감독은 이제 내게 눈길을 줬다. “성국이 칭찬은 곽 감독한테 많이 들었어요. 말귀를 그렇게 잘 알아듣는다면서요?” “저희도 깜짝깜짝 놀랄 때가 있어요.” “참, 주의 사항 아시죠?” “방송 시작하고 6개월 동안은 광고 금지요?” “네. 파일럿 날려보고 안 되면 금방 접을 수도 있어요. 이렇게라도 방송 타면 나중에 광고 모델 하는 건 더 유리할 거예요.” 엄마는 감독의 이야기를 귀 기울여 들었다. 감독은 우선 3일 정도 촬영한 것을 바탕으로 파일럿 프로그램을 만들어서 내보낸 후에 정규 편성 논의를 할 거라고 했다. “근데 어머니, 만삭이시네요.” “다음 달이 출산 예정일이에요.” “얼른 찍어야겠네요. 근데 반응 좋으면 정규 들어갈 텐데, 어머니가 안 오면 성국이 불안해하고 그러지 않나요?” “저도 그게 걱정인데요…. 성국이는 낯은 안 가려요.” [엄마, 나 완전 프로야. 걱정이란 것은 하지도 마.] 감독이 내 볼을 귀엽다는 듯이 잡아당겼다. “이 자식, 진짜 말귀 알아듣는 얼굴이네요. 완전 걱정 말란 얼굴이잖아요. 우선 촬영해보죠. 파일럿이 잘돼야 다음도 있는 거니까요.” “잘 부탁드립니다, 감독님.” 엄마는 부른 배를 안고 고개 숙여 인사했다. 나도 엄마를 따라 배꼽에 두 손을 딱 모으고 인사했다. [앞으로 잘 부탁해, 감독. 이 은혜는 내가 성공하면 몇 배로 갚을 테니 걱정 마.] * * * 드디어 첫 촬영이 시작됐다. 내가 할 일은 말갛게 씻은 얼굴로 촬영장으로 향하는 것뿐이었다. 나는 이미 이 프로그램의 끝까지 모두 알고 있었다. 동글동글 귀여운 눈으로 잘 웃고, 잘 울면 멤버들 역시 나를 이해하고 같이 웃고 울고 하는 거였다. 나와 엄마는 방송국에서 보내준 차를 타고 촬영 장소인 ‘저스트’의 숙소로 향했다. 반지하 숙소 인근은 이미 스태프와 각종 촬영 장비도 가득했다. 엄마가 나를 안고 내리자 조연출이 다가와서 얼른 내 상태를 확인했다. “성국이 컨디션 괜찮죠?” “잠도 잘 자고, 아침도 먹였어요.” “좋네요. 그럼 30분 후에 촬영 들어가겠습니다. 조금만 대기해 주세요.” “네.” 엄마와 나는 다시 차 안에서 30분을 기다렸다. 대기 시간 동안 엄마는 가져온 책을 읽어줬다. <왕자와 거지>였다. 똑같은 얼굴을 한 왕자와 거지가 서로의 일상을 바꿔 살아본다는 내용의 동화이다. [이거 내 이야기잖아.] 재벌이었을 때, 이 이야기를 읽으면서 그런 생각을 했다. 절대 단 하루라도 누군가와 인생을 바꿀 생각 따위는 하지 말아라. 왜냐하면 재벌의 삶이란 모두가 부러워하는 삶이기 때문이다. 나는 생각에 잠겨 고개를 끄덕였다. “성국아, 그림만 봐도 재미있어?” 나는 대충 고개를 끄덕였다. 저들은 아마 내가 어떤 생각과 경험을 가진 사람인지 아무도 모를 것이다. 한때는 삼전 그룹의 후계자였던 전성국이었다. 그 모든 왕좌의 짐을 내려놓은 게 지금의 전성국이었다. 똑. 똑. 차 문을 두드리는 소리가 들렸다. 엄마가 창을 내리자 조연출이 배시시 웃으며 나를 쳐다봤다. “촬영 곧 들어갈게요.” “녜에!” 나는 번쩍 손을 들었다. * * * 카메라가 돌아갔다. 나와 ‘저스트’ 주변을 에워싼 수십 명의 스태프들이 숨죽였다. ‘저스트’의 멤버들은 이미 대강 라인이 정해진 각본에 따라 각자 편안한 차림으로 거실에 모였다. ‘저스트’의 숙소였다. ‘저스트’의 숙소는 소속사와 가까운 30평대의 오래된 반지하 빌라였다. 아직 인기가 그렇게 많은 그룹은 아니어서 아파트나 주상복합으로 옮기지는 못한 모양이었다. 하지만 이게 더 정감 가고, 괜찮은 그림이 나올 것 같았다. 이른 아침, 띵동 초인종 소리가 들리고 막 잠에서 깬 멤버들이 나오면 문이 열리면서 아기 바구니에 든 내가 배달되는 장면부터 찍었다. 프로의 이름은 ‘다섯 남자와 아기 바구니’였다. 그 콘셉트에 충실한 오프닝이었다. 막 잠에서 깬 리더 태형이 아기 바구니를 들고 당황하며 멤버들을 불러 모았다. “얘들아, 이리 모여봐.” 멤버들은 그제야 상황을 파악하고 2박 3일 동안 함께할 나를 맞으러 모두 졸린 눈으로 나왔다. [연기들 좀 하는데?] 몇은 자연스레 머리도 헝클고 눈에 안 띄게 메이크업도 했다. 나는 잔뜩 겁에 질린 얼굴로 ‘저스트’ 멤버들을 한 명씩 눈으로 훑었다. [자, 이제 첫 장면이다. 낯선 곳에 왔으니 울어볼까?] 이게 내가 생각한 첫 장면이었다. 긴장감에 울음을 터트린 아기. 그 아기를 달래기 위해 최선을 다하는 ‘저스트’ 멤버! [음. 흠.] 나는 목을 풀고는 혼신을 다해서 울어재꼈다. “엄마앙! 아빠앙!” 나를 잽싸게 안아 든 것은 마이클이었다. [눈치 빠른 녀석.] 보나 마나 분량을 챙기려는 수작이다. 하지만 이 정도로 울음을 그치면 분량이 충분하지 않을 것 같은데…. 어쩔 수 없군. 나는 더 목 놓아 울어재꼈다. 곧바로 꽃미남 재현이 나를 빼앗듯이 안아 들었다. 나는 타이밍에 맞게 재현을 보고는 울음을 차츰 멈췄다. “애도 이쁜 사람 좋아하네.” 멤버들의 반응에 이번엔 덩치만 근육돌 루카스가 나를 안으려고 들었다. “성국아, 이리 와봐. 형이야, 형.” 낯선 장소에서 당황하는 모습. 마이클이 안아 들자 우는 장면에 이어 재현이 나를 안자 잠잠해지는 것까지는 계산된 상황이었다. 갑자기 루카스는 좀 당황스러웠다. [이 녀석과의 관계 설정을 어찌하지?] 순간, 루카스의 두툼한 손바닥이 눈앞에 보였다. 나는 얼른 루카스의 손바닥을 내 작은 손으로 콩 찍었다. 마치 놀이를 하듯이. “성국이도 루카스가 장난 좋아하는 거 단번에 알아보네. 루카스랑 놀려고 하나 봐.” 태형의 예상대로 나는 루카스를 친구로 설정했다. 듬직한 리더 태형은 아빠. 자상한 꽃미남 재현은 엄마. 근육돌 루카스는 친구. 낯가림이 있는 범선과는 어색한 사이. 장난치기 좋아하는 마이클과는 앙숙. 나는 얼른 머리로 관계 설정을 끝마쳤다. 그러곤 방긋 웃었다. [앞으로 잘 부탁해, ‘저스트’.] ‘저스트’ 멤버들이 모두 내 앞으로 모여들었다. “성국아, 앞으로 잘 지내보자.” 리더인 태형이 이야기하자 모두들 나를 향해 손을 흔들었다. 나는 조금 경계를 풀고는 어색하게 미소를 지었다. 낯설지만, 진심으로 나를 대하는 ‘저스트’와의 첫 만남 엔딩으로 이것만큼 좋은 것은 없어 보였다. “컷! 자, 다음 갑시다!” 감독의 만족스러운 목소리가 들렸다. * * * 쉬는 시간이 시작됐다. 이제 제법 배가 부른 엄마 옆에서 나는 ‘저스트’ 다섯 멤버들 분석을 시작한다. 집중하기 위해서 엄마의 뱃살에 얼굴을 콕 박았다. [엄마 냄새 조아. 헤헤.] “성국아, 엄마가 그렇게 좋아?” “녜에!” 나는 격하게 호응했다. 엄마는 환하게 웃으며 내 볼에 마구 뽀뽀를 해댔다. [엄마, 나도 이제 내일모레면 18개월이라고. 거기다 이제 동생도 생기는데 창피하게 왜 이래.] 내가 발버둥을 치자, 엄마는 나를 더 꼭 안았다. ‘저스트’의 맏형 태형이 달려오더니 간식과 물을 내밀었다. “어머니 피곤하지죠?” “아니에요.” “근데 어머니, 진짜 젊으세요.” [태형아, 너랑 동갑이야.] “그럼 어머니, 쉬시고 뭐 필요한 거 있으면 언제든 편하게 말씀하세요.” “감사해요. 정말로요.” 엄마는 배시시 웃으며 뒤돌아가는 태형의 뒷모습에서 눈을 떼지 못했다. [엄마, 대체 왜 그래? 혹 쟤들 잘생겨서 그러는 거야? 어?] 엄마는 태형이 건넨 간식을 먹으며 연신 미소를 지었다. “성국아, 저스트 멤버들 다 너무 잘생겼어.” [엄마, 내가 아빠한테 다 이를 거야!] “성국아, 이건 아빠한테 비밀!” 엄마가 내 입에 입을 쪽 맞췄다. [이러면 마음 약해지는데….] “자, 이제 촬영 다시 시작합니다!” 조연출의 목소리가 들렸다. 엄마는 나를 안고 촬영장으로 향했다. 나는 두 손을 쫙 펴서 머리를 뒤로 넘기고, 내복을 탁탁 털었다. [자. 촬영 시작해볼까.] * * * 엄마와 함께하는 낮 촬영은 대부분 순조롭게 진행됐다. 엄마가 카메라 뒤에 어딘가에 있었고, 나는 카메라를 의식하지 않은 채 자유롭게 행동하기만 해도 다들 귀엽다고 난리였다. 그리고 내가 밤을 꼬박 ‘저스트’ 멤버들과 함께 보내야 하는 마지막 날 밤의 촬영이 다가왔다. 엄마는 임산부였기 때문에 아빠와 함께 근처 작은 호텔에서 잠을 자기로 했다. 혹시라도 있을 사건 사고에 대비하기 위해서 연출팀 몇 명이서 돌아가는 카메라를 주시했다. 그래도 안심이 안 되는지, 아빠는 임산부인 엄마만 호텔에 데려다주고 촬영팀과 함께 밤새 숨을 죽이고 카메라를 관찰했다. 감독도 떠나면서 나에게 딱 하나만 당부했다. “성국아, 그냥 잘 자고 잘 먹고 잘 싸면 돼.” [걱정 마, 감독. 내가 안 하려고 해도 이 나이엔 그게 조절이 안 돼.] 감독은 ‘저스트’ 멤버들에게도 단단히 주의를 줬다. “성국이는 18개월밖에 안 된 아기야. 다들 알지?” “네!” “진짜 조심해야 해.” “감독님, 걱정 마세요. 제가 있잖아요.” 마이클이 넉살 좋게 다가갔다. “그래, 너만 믿는다.” 세상에서 단 한 명을 믿지 말라면 그건 바로 마이클이었다. 곧 촬영팀이 나가는 장면을 촬영하고는, 관찰 카메라 두 대만이 구석에서 돌아갔다. “성국이 저녁 누가 준비할래?” 태형이 멤버들에게 물었다. 그러자 마이클이 얼른 나섰다. “내가 할게!” “네가?” 멤버들은 모두 의아한 얼굴로 마이클을 쳐다봤다. “진짜 네가 한다고?” 재현의 얼굴만 봐도 마이클 이 녀석, 분량 챙기려는 욕심이 분명하다.","output":"Episode 10 \\"Your smile is seriously pretty. I'm Jaehyun. Please take good care of me, Sunguk.\\" Jaehyun, with his eye-smile, approached. He was popular for his flower-boy looks but later got involved in complicated issues with women, becoming a frequent subject of gossip. \\"Hi, I'm Beomseon. Call me 'hyung'. Or is it 'hyungnim'? That sounds a bit gangster, though.\\" [Hey, Beomseon! Long time no see.] Beomseon and I had quite a connection. Known among idols as the 'actor type', he later successfully transitioned into an actor known for his macho charm. I remember him winning Best Actor at a film festival sponsored by Samjeon Group and drinking late into the night at the after-party. He had good manners when drinking and, above all, was loyal. I even attended the after-party of a film festival sponsored by Samjeon Group, which I normally wouldn't have. [Now, only one person is left...] \\"Whatsup. I'm Michael. Nice to meet you.\\" A swaggering pose with a smug face. And even his name, Michael, reeked of butter. This Korean-American guy later caused all sorts of trouble, from issues with women to money, tarnishing the reputation of 'Just', a group once known as the national idols. Michael lightly touched my cheek with his hand, which smelled of cigarettes. [How dare this guy touch me with his cigarette-smelling hand?!] I frowned, and Michael looked at me as if he couldn't believe it. \\"What, does he not like me?\\" Michael teased me with a twisted tongue. I turned my head away. \\"You smoked before coming here, didn't you? I don't like it, and what about the kid?\\" When Taehyung, the leader, scolded him, Michael mumbled something in English and slunk away to a corner. I looked back at them with a calm face. Mom was busy admiring 'Just', especially the handsome Beomseon, with a fascinated expression on her protruding belly. [Mom, snap out of it!] When I tugged at her, Mom quickly came to her senses and held me. \\"Sunguk, the oppas are really handsome.\\" [There are even kids younger than you, Mom.] Despite my inner thoughts, I nodded and gave a business-like response. \\"Yes!\\" Now that I was past my first birthday, I had started walking awkwardly and could occasionally utter words beyond babbling. [Mom, don't be fooled by their looks. There's a saying that you shouldn't trust those who paint their faces.] Mom, oblivious to my thoughts, just kept smiling at 'Just'. When the director entered, 'Just' lined up and bowed in unison. \\"Hello! We are 'Just', leading the Korean music scene!\\" \\"Nice to meet you all. You've heard the story, right?\\" \\"Yes.\\" Taehyung answered on behalf of the group. \\"We'll be filming at your dorm for about 3 days. Sunguk will come out at 9 AM and film until 6 PM, and he'll spend one night at the dorm. It's just a reality show, so act as naturally as possible. We'll create the characters through editing later.\\" \\"Thank you, Director!\\" \\"Don't be too stiff at the dorm. Wear your usual clothes. Try to wear minimal makeup.\\" \\"Yes!\\" The director then turned his attention to me. \\"I've heard a lot of praise about Sunguk from Director Kwak. They say he understands everything so well?\\" \\"We're often surprised too.\\" \\"Remember the rule, right? No commercials for 6 months after the broadcast starts?\\" \\"Yes. If the pilot doesn't work out, we might cancel it quickly. But appearing on the show now will be advantageous for future commercial modeling.\\" Mom listened intently to the director's words. The director explained that they would create a pilot program based on the first 3 days of filming and then discuss regular scheduling. \\"But, Mom, you're heavily pregnant.\\" \\"My due date is next month.\\" \\"We need to film quickly then. But if the response is good and we go regular, won't Sunguk be anxious without you?\\" \\"That's what I'm worried about... But Sunguk doesn't really get shy.\\" [Mom, I'm a total pro. Don't even worry.] The director playfully pinched my cheek. \\"This kid really does seem to understand everything. He's telling us not to worry. Let's start filming. The future depends on how well the pilot does.\\" \\"Thank you, Director.\\" Mom bowed with her swollen belly, and I mimicked her, placing my hands on my belly button in salute. [Take care, Director. I'll repay this kindness several times over once I succeed.] * * * Finally, the first day of filming began. My only task was to head to the set with a freshly washed face. I already knew everything about this program from start to finish. With my round, cute eyes, smiling and crying well would make the members understand and laugh and cry with me. Mom and I took the car provided by the broadcasting station to 'Just's dorm, the filming location. The area around the semi-basement dorm was already filled with staff and various filming equipment. As Mom carried me out of the car, the assistant director quickly came over to check on me. \\"Is Sunguk's condition okay?\\" \\"He slept well and had breakfast.\\" \\"Great. We'll start filming in 30 minutes. Please wait a bit.\\" \\"Okay.\\" Mom and I waited in the car for another 30 minutes. During the waiting time, Mom read me a book. It was \\"The Prince and the Pauper.\\" A fairy tale about a prince and a pauper with identical faces swapping their lives. [This is my story.] When I was a chaebol, I thought about this story. Never even think about swapping lives with someone for a single day. Because the life of a chaebol is envied by everyone. I nodded thoughtfully. \\"Sunguk, is it fun just looking at the pictures?\\" I casually nodded. They probably have no idea what kind of thoughts and experiences I have. I was once Jeon Seonguk, the heir to the Samjeon Group. And now, I've laid down all the burdens of that throne. Knock. Knock. There was a knock on the car door. As Mom rolled down the window, the assistant director smiled brightly at me. \\"We're about to start filming.\\" \\"Yess!\\" I raised my hand high. * * * The camera started rolling. Dozens of staff members surrounding me and 'Just' held their breath. The members of 'Just' had already gathered in the living room, dressed comfortably according to the roughly outlined script. It was 'Just's dorm. Located close to their agency, it was an old semi-basement villa of about 30 pyeong. Since they weren't that popular yet, they hadn't moved to an apartment or a mixed-use complex. But this seemed more intimate and likely to produce better scenes. The opening scene was filmed with the doorbell ringing early in the morning, the members waking up, and me being delivered in a baby basket. The show was titled \\"Five Men and a Baby Basket,\\" sticking true to its concept. Leader Taehyung, just woken up, carried the baby basket in confusion and gathered the members. \\"Guys, come here.\\" Only then did the members grasp the situation and came out with sleepy eyes to meet me, who they would be spending the next 2 nights and 3 days with. [Are they acting?] Some naturally had messy hair and subtly applied makeup. I scanned each member of 'Just' with a terrified face. [Now, the first scene. Should I cry since I'm in a strange place?] This was my planned first scene. A baby bursting into tears from tension. The 'Just' members doing their best to soothe the baby! [Hmm. Ahem.] I cleared my throat and cried with all my might. \\"Mommy! Daddy!\\" Michael was the first to quickly hold me. [A quick-witted guy.] Obviously, he was trying to grab some screen time. But stopping my crying now wouldn't be enough for a good scene... No choice then. I cried even louder. Soon, the handsome Jaehyun snatched me up. I looked at Jaehyun and gradually stopped crying, timing it perfectly. \\"Even the baby likes pretty people.\\" The members reacted, and then the muscular Lucas tried to hold me. \\"Sunguk, come here. I'm your hyung, your brother.\\" The scene of me panicking in a strange place and crying when Michael held me, followed by calming down when Jaehyun held me, was all planned. Suddenly, Lucas was a bit perplexing. [How should I set up my relationship with this guy?] Lucas's thick palm appeared before my eyes. I quickly tapped Lucas's palm with my small hand, as if playing a game. \\"Sunguk seems to recognize that Lucas likes to play. Looks like he wants to play with Lucas.\\" As Taehyung predicted, I set Lucas as a friend. The reliable leader Taehyung as dad. The caring handsome Jaehyun as mom. Muscle man Lucas as a friend. An awkward relationship with the shy Beomseon. And a playful rivalry with Michael. I quickly finished setting up the relationships in my head. Then I smiled brightly. [Looking forward to working with you, 'Just'.] All members of 'Just' gathered around me. \\"Sunguk, let's get along well.\\" As leader Taehyung spoke, everyone waved at me. I relaxed a bit and smiled awkwardly. Despite the unfamiliarity, the sincere first meeting with 'Just' seemed like the perfect ending. \\"Cut! Let's move on to the next scene!\\" The director's satisfied voice was heard. * * * Break time began. Next to my now full-bellied mom, I started analyzing the five members of 'Just'. To concentrate, I buried my face in Mom's belly. [Mom's scent is nice. Hehe.] \\"Sunguk, do you like Mom that much?\\" \\"Yess!\\" I responded enthusiastically. Mom laughed brightly and showered my cheeks with kisses. [Mom, I'm almost 18 months old now. And I'm about to have a sibling, why are you embarrassing me like this?] As I squirmed, Mom hugged me tighter. 'Just's eldest member, Taehyung, rushed over and offered snacks and water. \\"Are you tired, Mom?\\" \\"No, not at all.\\" \\"But, Mom, you're really young.\\" [Taehyung, you're the same age as her.] \\"Then, Mom, rest up, and if you need anything, feel free to ask anytime.\\" \\"Thank you. Really.\\" Mom smiled bashfully and couldn't take her eyes off Taehyung as he walked away. [Mom, why are you like this? Is it because they're handsome? Huh?] Mom ate the snacks Taehyung gave her, smiling continuously. \\"Sunguk, all the members of 'Just' are so handsome.\\" [Mom, I'm telling Dad everything!] \\"Sunguk, this is a secret from Dad!\\" Mom sealed my lips with a kiss. [This makes me go soft...] \\"Alright, let's start filming again!\\" The assistant director's voice was heard. Mom carried me to the set. I stretched my arms, pushed my hair back, and dusted off my onesie. [Let's start filming.]"},{"instruction":"apakah gilang masih ada?","output":"Maaf, tetapi saya tidak memiliki informasi spesifik tentang individu atau data pribadi.

The walls are adorned with posters of popular 80s bands and movie stars. # Characters: Teenage Girl: - **Dress:** She could be wearing a dress characteristic of the 1980s prom style, such as a puffy-sleeved, pastel-colored gown with sequins or lace embellishments. The skirt is likely full, possibly with tiers or ruffles, and she might have a satin sash tied around her waist. - **Hairstyle:** Her hair could be styled in big, voluminous curls or an elaborate updo, perhaps with a hair accessory like a bow or a glittery headband. - **Accessories:** Think of wearing chunky jewelry, such as large earrings and bangles. She might also have a corsage on her wrist, a common prom accessory. Teenage Boys: - **Outfits:** The boys could be wearing classic 80s prom attire, like pastel or brightly colored tuxedos with ruffled or sequined shirt fronts. One might go for a more conservative look with a black or white tuxedo but with a brightly colored tie or bow tie and cummerbund set to match the girl's dress color. - **Hairstyle:** For hair, think of popular 80s styles for men, such as feathered hair, mullets, or even a neatly styled afro if one of the characters is inclined to sport more of a throwback look from the 70s transitioning into the early 80s. - **Accessories:** They might be wearing patent leather shoes, and at least one of them could have a boutonniere pinned to his lapel that matches the girl’s corsage. # Pose: - The three teenagers could be standing together with the girl in the middle. - The girl could have one hand on her hip, holding her dress slightly aside, and the other resting on the shoulder of one of the boys. Each boy could have one hand in his trouser pocket and the other draped around the girl's waist or shoulder. - They would be smiling broadly, looking straight at the camera, capturing the joy and excitement of prom night.

This not only showcases your skills but also demonstrates your ability to work collaboratively on real-world projects. # 4. **Freelancing or Contract Work** - Initially working as a freelancer or contractor allows you to demonstrate your capabilities without undergoing formal interviews. Platforms like Upwork, Freelancer, and Toptal can be good starting points. Successful projects completed through these platforms can serve as testimonials to your skill set. # 5. **Direct Applications to Startups and Small Companies** - Smaller companies and startups often have more flexible hiring processes and might prioritize getting the job done over formal coding interviews. Tailor your application to highlight how you can solve their specific problems, focusing on your experience and portfolio. # 6. **Use Specialized Job Boards** - Utilize job boards that focus on tech roles without traditional hiring processes, such as AngelList, where startups often list open positions. Some platforms or communities may specifically advertise positions that don’t require whiteboard coding interviews. # 7. **Self-Promotion Through Content Creation** - **Blogging/Vlogging**: Share your knowledge and experiences through blogs or videos. This can help establish you as an expert in your field, attracting potential employers directly to you. - **Social Media**: Regularly share your work, achievements, and insights on platforms like LinkedIn, Twitter, and dev.to. Engage with the community by joining discussions, which can increase your visibility to hiring managers. # 8. **Continuous Learning and Certification** - While you seek to avoid coding interviews, continuing to expand your skill set can make you more attractive to potential employers.

Dalam biologi dan kedokteran modern, sperma (atau spermatozoa) dipahami sebagai sel reproduksi laki-laki yang terdiri dari berbagai komponen biologis dan kimia, bukan 'elemen' dalam arti klasik atau filosofis. Mari kita lihat apa itu sperma dari sudut pandang ilmiah: 1. **Kepala**: Bagian paling depan dari sperma yang mengandung inti, di mana terdapat material genetik (DNA) dari laki-laki. Kepala sperma juga dilapisi oleh sebuah struktur yang disebut akrosom, yang berisi enzim yang penting untuk proses fertilisasi dengan menembus lapisan luar ovum (sel telur). 2. **Lekukan Akrosom**: Wilayah kecil antara kepala dan bahu, mengandung mekanisme penting untuk melepaskan enzim akrosom. 3. **Badan atau Bagian Tengah**: Mengandung mitokondria, yang menyediakan energi yang diperlukan untuk pergerakan sperma. 4. **Ekor atau Flagel**: Komponen panjang yang berfungsi untuk memberikan motilitas kepada sperma, memungkinkannya untuk berenang menuju sel telur. Dari penjelasan di atas, bisa disimpulkan bahwa sperma terdiri dari beberapa komponen utama yang berfungsi bersama-sama untuk memastikan sel sperma bisa mencapai dan membuahi sel telur. Istilah 'empat elemen' mungkin mengacu pada struktur fisik utama sperma (kepala, lekukan akrosom, badan, dan ekor) tetapi istilah ini tidak secara akurat mencerminkan komposisi kimia atau biologis kompleks dari sel sperma itu sendiri. Dalam banyak tradisi filosofis dan simbolis kuno, empat elemen (tanah, air, udara, dan api) sering digunakan untuk menjelaskan prinsip dasar alam.

[엄마, 아빠 바보야? 이걸 왜 고대로 저금해! 이 돈으로 집도 좀 옮기고, 하다못해 맨날 똑같은 옷 입고 다니는 엄마, 아빠 입을 옷이라도 사야지!] 나는 버럭 소리를 질렀지만, 금세 눈가가 촉촉해졌다. 세금 떼고 나면 채 400만 원도 안 되는 금액. 회귀 전에 나에게 이 돈은 그저 한 끼 식사 금액일 때도 있었고, 하룻밤 술값이 안 될 때도 있었다. 하지만 이들에게 이 돈은 한 남자가 식당에서 아침부터 저녁까지 일하고 받는 반년치 월급이었다. 그런 돈을 지금 한 푼도 안 쓰고 내 이름으로 모두 저축한 것이었다. “성국아, 이거 네가 번 거니까 다 네 거야. 엄마, 아빠는 하나도 안 건드렸어. 우리 성국이가 커서 학교 가면, 이 돈으로 배우고 싶은 거 있으면 엄마, 아빠가 다 시켜줄게.” [나 좀 그만 울리라고!] 나는 목이 멨다. “자기야, 우리 성국이 진짜 우리 말 알아듣나 봐. 눈시울이 붉어졌어.” “소영아, 성국이 진짜 감정이 풍부한 것 같아. 그래서 연기도 잘하나 봐.” 나는 작은 두 손으로 얼굴을 비벼댔다. 아빠가 내 손을 잡았다. “성국아, 이러면 얼굴 다쳐요. 우리 스타님.” [누가 울리래!] “자기야, 성국이 자다 깨서 졸린 것 같아. 내가 안을게.” “아니야, 소영아. 너 배 나와서 힘들잖아. 내가 안을게.” 아빠는 나를 안아서 어느새 등을 도닥였다. 식당에서 하루 종일 일하고 또 나를 안아 들었다. “성국아, 너는 정말 고아원에서 자라서 부모도 모르고 형제도 없는 우리 같은 사람들한테 온 복덩이야. 엄마, 아빠가 아직 많이 어려서 많이 부족하지? 그래도 엄마, 아빠가 진짜 열심히 살아서 우리 성국이는 부족한 거 없이 자라도록 노력할게. 성국아, 사랑해.” 크응. 나는 몰래 울음을 삼켰다. 회귀 전의 나에게 이렇게 따뜻했던 사람이 있었던가. 부모조차 나를 자식이 아닌 삼전 그룹의 후계자로 생각하고 따뜻한 말보다 혹독한 채찍을 가했다. 주변 사람들은 내가 삼전 그룹의 후계자라는 사실을 알면 어떻게든 내게 잘 보여 뭐라도 뜯어갈 생각만 했다. 나는 아빠 품에 폭 안겼다. 그리고 광고 속 그 한마디를 외쳤다. “아. 빠?” “소영아, 들었어?” 아빠가 들뜬 얼굴로 엄마를 쳐다봤다. 엄마는 내 엉덩이를 토닥였다. “자기야! 우리 성국이, 아빠 진짜 잘하지?” “소영아, 사실은… 우리 성국이가 엄마, 아빠 말을 너무 안 해서 사실 한동안 고민했거든.” 얼마 전까지 이들은 내가 크는 동안 양육을 담당하는 대리모와 대리부 정도의 존재였다. “그게, 성국이한테 내가 부족한 아빠라서 그런 게 아닌가 괜히 자격지심 들고 그랬는데, 이제야 마음이 놓이는 것 같아.” “자기야, 그런 생각 하지 마. 우리 성국이 진짜 아빠라는 말을 세상에서 제일 잘하는 애니까.” “그러게. 어! 성국이 자나 보다.” 이럴 때는 자는 척이라도 해줘야 할 것 같았다. 나도 눈치라는 게 있다. 스물세 살의 아빠와 그보다 어린 엄마. 둘만의 시간이 필요해 보였다. 나는 슬그머니 눈을 감았다. * * * 삼전 전자 CF를 찍은 곽 감독이 집 앞까지 찾아왔다. 곽 감독의 손에는 과일바구니가 들려 있었다. 오랜만에 보는 열대과일이었다. 나는 어느새 과일바구니를 향해 기어갔다. 애가 되더니 전에는 없던 식탐까지 생긴 모양이다. 얼른 멜론을 집어 들려는 순간, 엄마가 나를 안았다. [하아, 멜론 좋아하는데. 저기다 하몽 얹어서 와인 한 잔 하면 피로가 싹 가시는데….] 나는 입맛을 다셨다. 아빠가 얼른 감독에게 직접 탄 믹스 커피를 내밀었다. “감독님, 어쩐 일이세요?” “성국이가 요즘 엄청 핫한 거 아시죠?” “저희는 실감이 안 나요.” “그러실 만도 하죠. 오늘 제가 온 것은 다름이 아니라 성국이한테 제안을 하나 하려고요.” “제안이요?” 아빠가 되물었다. “이런 이야기 어려우실 수 있는데요. 지금 다른 광고 제안 들어와도 하지 마시고, 방송 하나를 하면 어떨까 해서요.” “광고도 더는 생각해보지 않았어요. 그런데 방송이라니….” [아빠, 원래 일이라는 것은 연달아 들어오는 법이야.] 나는 어깨를 으쓱했다. “이번에 MVC 방송국 일요일 저녁 버라이어티 쇼에서 새로 신설되는 거거든요. 한 번도 아이를 키워본 적 없는 어린 남자 가수들이 아이를 키우는 거예요. 거기 성국이가 메인이고요.” [아, 그거!] 나는 기억을 떠올렸다. 남자 아이돌 그룹이 어린아이를 키우는, 육아 프로그램의 시조새쯤 되는 거였다. 물론 이건 당연히 해야 한다. 당대에는 물론, 후에도 무척이나 회자되는 육아 프로그램의 레전드였다. 아빠의 표정이 점점 어두워졌다. “감독님 제의는 감사하지만요….” 아빠는 말끝을 흐렸다. [아빠, 이건 아니지!] 나는 발버둥을 쳤지만, 아무도 내 이야기에 귀를 기울이진 않았다. 그렇다면! “으아앙! 으앙!” “성국아, 왜 그래?” 엄마가 얼른 나를 안았다. [왜 그러긴. 엄마, 아빠 좀 말려봐! 이건 내가 내 능력으로 따낸 황금 같은 기회라고!] 아빠는 생각한 말을 내뱉었다. “성국이가 자꾸 방송을 타면 다른 아이들과 다르게 자랄까 봐 걱정이 돼서요.” 나는 잠시 울음을 멈췄다. 의외의 대답인걸? 감독은 깊게 고개를 끄덕였다. “아버님, 고민 이해됩니다. 아무래도 방송에 노출되다 보면 사람들이 많이 알아보고 아이도 그 시선 속에서 자라게 되니까요.” 아빠는 고개를 끄덕였다. “저는 평범하게 아이를 키우고 싶습니다.” “하지만 아버님. 성국이는 정말 제가 본 다른 애들과 다릅니다. 외모도 외모지만, 타고난 재능이라는 게 보여요. 스스로 빛날 줄 아는 아이 같다는 말씀입니다. 그리고 요즘 부모들은 이런 방송 못 내보내서 난리거든요. 아이도 유명해지고 돈도 되니까요.” “…사실은 저희 부부가 모두 고아원에서 자랐거든요.” “아….” 감독은 놀라 아무 말도 못 했다. 아빠는 담담히 말을 이었다. “그래서 남의 손에 애를 맡기고 싶지 않았어요. 어릴 때만큼은 엄마, 아빠 사랑 듬뿍 받고 자라야 하는 거잖아요. 부족한 저희한테 찾아온 생명인데, 그래야 하잖아요.” 나는 주먹을 앙 쥐고 입을 틀어막았다. 눈시울이 뜨거워지는 것을 겨우 참아내고 있었다. [이번 생의 부모는 왜케 사연이 구구절절한 거야.] 감독도 어느새 붉어진 눈시울을 두 손으로 꾹 눌렀다. 나는 겨우 정신을 차리고 엄마 품을 벗어나 아빠에게 기어갔다. 아빠의 마음을 전부는 알 수 없지만, 아주 조금은 알 것 같았다. 하지만 이건 비즈니스이다. 나는 얼른 아빠의 무릎 나온 바지를 물고 뜯었다. [아빠, 지금도 사랑은 충분해. 돈이 많으면 더 많은 사랑을 줄 수도 있어!] 돈과 사랑의 비례는 일정할 때 최상의 시너지를 낸다. 돈이 너무 많아지거나, 사랑이 너무 많아지면 그때부터 문제가 생기는 법이다. 감독은 잠긴 목을 풀더니 아빠를 쳐다봤다. “아버님 뜻은 잘 알겠습니다.” [감독, 이렇게 포기하면 안 돼!] 감독은 나를 흘깃 보더니 다시 말을 이었다. “아버님, 그래도 한 번 잘 생각해 보세요. 두 분 사정 들으니 알 것 같지만, 부모님이 이렇게 사랑하고 생각해 주는데, 잠시 방송하는 건 크게 문제 될 것 없어 보이거든요. 출연도도 적지는 않을 거고요.” “저희는 돈 때문이 아니라요.” 아빠는 어렵게 말을 꺼냈다. 우리 아빠, 엄마의 행색을 보면 누구든 형편이 어렵다는 것은 단번에 알 수 있다. 나는 엄마의 허리를 꼭 껴안았다. [엄마, 걱정하지 마. 내가 10년 안에 부자 만들어 줄 테니까.] 감독이 엄마에게 안긴 나를 보더니 배시시 웃었다. “이런 말씀 이상할지 모르지만… 성국이는 진짜 사람 말 알아듣는 거 같아요. 아무튼 제가 오늘 드릴 제안은 이거였어요. 방송국 오디션을 보시는 게 어떻겠냐는 거죠. 대신, 이 방송 조건에 6개월 동안은 광고 금지예요.” 나는 얼른 아빠의 등짝을 팡팡 쳤다. [아빠, 이거야!] 아빠가 나를 내려다봤다. “성국이, 하고 싶어?” “네에!” 나는 자신 있게 대답했다. * * * 지금 내 눈앞에는 회귀 전에 내가 즐겨 듣던 <너만을 원해>를 부른 국민 아이돌 그룹 ‘저스트’ 다섯 명이 있었다. 물론 지금은 무명에서 조금 벗어난 신생 그룹 수준이었다. 이 녀석들은 몇 년 후에 엄청나게 성공해서 국민 아이돌 그룹이 된다. [내 열두 살 생일에 와서 노래도 부른 녀석들인데….] 나는 그날을 떠올렸다. 삼전 호텔의 가장 큰 연회장에서 열린 내 열두 살 생일에는 ‘저스트’뿐 아니라 막 떠오르는 여자 아이돌 그룹도 모두 참석했다. 그들의 첫 멘트는 이거였다. “전성국 도련님, 열두 번째 생일 축하드립니다!” 모두들 나와 아이 컨택 하려고 애썼었는데…. ‘저스트’ 멤버들은 나중에 나이를 먹은 후에 사석에서 몇 번 마주치기도 했다. 아이돌들이 대부분 그렇듯 몇은 배우, 몇은 생계형 방송인이 된다. 먼저 리더인 태형이 나에게 다가왔다. ‘저스트’는 본명을 쓰는 멤버도 있었고, 영어 이름을 쓰는 멤버도 있었다. “네가 아빠! 그 모델이구나. 형도 그 광고 봤어.” 리더이자 메인 래퍼인 태형은 잘생긴 얼굴에 토종 한국인임에도 불구하고 영어를 곧잘 해서 팀에서 브레인으로 통했다. 나중에 의류 사업 한다며 나대던 기억이 나는데, 인성도 크게 나쁘지 않고, 자기 이익은 잘 챙기는 스타일이라 재벌가의 먼 친척쯤 되는 여자랑 결혼해서 잘 산다. 그 뒤로 키가 유난히 큰 루카스가 다가왔다. 루카스는 덩치에 비해 웃는 모습은 순수해 보였다. 순진한 웃음에 근육질 몸매. 근육돌의 시초쯤 되는 녀석인데, 생긴 것처럼 성격도 단순한 체대 오빠 스타일로 여자들에게 인기가 많았다. “와, 장난 아니게 이쁘게 생겼네. 우리보다 성국이가 더 주목받겠는걸.” [그거야 당연한 말씀. 두고 보라고!]","output":"Episode 9 Dad came home after 11 PM, having had another drink with the owner of the bossam (Korean boiled pork) restaurant. Today, Dad's hands were full of something. \\"Honey, what's all that?\\" \\"The owner gave me all sorts of things. He was making a fuss, bragging to the customers every time our commercial came on. The sales even doubled compared to other days.\\" \\"The owner is really a good person.\\" \\"Look at this. Seeing Seong-guk eat bossam so well earlier, he even packed some of the bossam meat they use at the restaurant separately for us.\\" I was half-asleep, listening to Mom and Dad's conversation. Dad continued to boast about various things. He was energized all day thanks to the commercial I was in, and the owner even complimented that the bossam he made now tastes almost as good as his. \\"Honey, the owner said he's raising my salary by 100,000 won starting next month because he switched to a bossam restaurant and the sales went up a lot.\\" \\"100,000 won! Seong-guk must really be a lucky charm. Ever since Seong-guk was born, your work has been going well, and I'm so happy.\\" Mom was moved, holding Dad's hands tightly over just 100,000 won. What can you do with 100,000 won? Maybe barely afford a meal at the Samjeon Hotel. As I rubbed my sleepy eyes, Dad approached me. \\"Seong-guk, you haven't slept?\\" [Technically, I was woken up. Because it was noisy.] \\"Should we give Seong-guk his present now?\\" Ah, there was a present. At that word, my eyes sparkled. [I used to be a chaebol, why am I acting so needy?] Dad rummaged through his old handbag he always carries and pulled out something small and thin in front of me. [What, it's a bankbook....] I mumbled in disappointment. \\"Seong-guk, see this? It's a bankbook. The money you earned from being a model for the commercial, I've saved it all in your name. See, it's under your name, Jeon Seong-guk.\\" Dad pushed the bankbook made out in 'Jeon Seong-guk's' name in front of me. It was a bankbook where not a single penny of the model fee I received was missing. Even the 50,000 won received for transportation on the audition day was saved. [Mom, Dad, are you fools? Why save it all like this! With this money, we could move houses, or at the very least, buy clothes for Mom and Dad who wear the same thing every day!] I yelled out loud, but soon my eyes became moist. After taxes, it wasn't even 4 million won. In my previous life, there were times when this amount was just the cost of a meal or not even enough for a night's drinking. But to them, this money was half a year's salary for a man working from morning till evening at a restaurant. They saved all that money in my name without spending a penny. \\"Seong-guk, since you earned this money, it's all yours. Mom and Dad didn't touch a single won. When Seong-guk grows up and goes to school, if there's anything you want to learn, Mom and Dad will support you with this money.\\" [Stop making me cry!] My throat was choked up. \\"Honey, Seong-guk really seems to understand us. His eyes are getting red.\\" \\"Seong-guk really seems to have rich emotions. Maybe that's why he acts so well.\\" I rubbed my face with my small hands. Dad held my hand. \\"Seong-guk, you'll hurt your face if you do that. Our star.\\" [Who asked you to make me cry!] \\"Honey, Seong-guk seems sleepy because he woke up. I'll hold him.\\" \\"No, So-young. You're pregnant and it's hard for you. I'll hold him.\\" Dad held me and soon patted my back. He held me after working all day at the restaurant. \\"Seong-guk, you're really a blessing to us, who grew up in an orphanage without knowing our parents or siblings. Mom and Dad are still very young and lacking, but we'll live diligently so Seong-guk can grow up without lacking anything. Seong-guk, we love you.\\" I secretly swallowed my tears. Did I ever have someone this warm to me before my regression? Even my parents thought of me not as their child but as the heir to the Samjeon Group, and instead of warm words, they often whipped me harshly. People around me, knowing I was the heir to the Samjeon Group, tried to show off to me in any way to rip something off me. I threw myself into Dad's arms. And I shouted that one line from the commercial. \\"Dad?\\" \\"So-young, did you hear?\\" Dad looked at Mom with an excited face. Mom patted my bottom. \\"Honey! Our Seong-guk, he's really good at calling Dad, right?\\" \\"So-young, actually... I've been worried for a while because Seong-guk doesn't talk much to Mom and Dad.\\" Until recently, they were just surrogates taking care of me as I grew up. \\"I thought maybe I was lacking as a father, and I felt unqualified, but now I feel relieved.\\" \\"Honey, don't think like that. Our Seong-guk is really the best at saying 'Dad' in the world.\\" \\"Right. Oh! Seong-guk seems to be asleep.\\" It seemed like I should pretend to be asleep at times like this. I also have tact. Dad and Mom, who are twenty-three and younger, seemed to need their own time. I quietly closed my eyes. * * * Director Kwak, who filmed the Samjeon Electronics CF, came to our house. In Director Kwak's hand was a fruit basket. It was tropical fruit I hadn't seen in a long time. I soon crawled towards the fruit basket. Becoming a child, I seemed to have developed a craving for food that I didn't have before. Just as I was about to grab a melon, Mom picked me up. [Ah, I like melon. If you put ham on it and have a glass of wine, the fatigue just disappears...] I smacked my lips. Dad quickly offered Director Kwak a cup of mixed coffee he made himself. \\"Director, what brings you here?\\" \\"Seong-guk is really hot these days, you know?\\" \\"We can't really feel it.\\" \\"I guess so. I came today to make a proposal to Seong-guk.\\" \\"A proposal?\\" Dad asked back. \\"It might be difficult to talk about this. Even if other commercial offers come in, don't accept them, and how about doing a broadcast?\\" \\"We haven't even thought about more commercials. But a broadcast...\\" [Dad, work usually comes in succession.] I shrugged my shoulders. \\"It's a new variety show on MVC Broadcasting Station on Sunday evenings. Young male singers who have never raised a child before will raise a child. Seong-guk will be the main character.\\" [Ah, that one!] I remembered. It was somewhat the pioneer of parenting programs where male idol groups raise a child. Of course, this was a must-do. It was a legendary parenting program that was talked about not only in its time but also long after. Dad's expression gradually darkened. \\"Thank you for the offer, Director, but...\\" Dad trailed off. [Dad, this isn't right!] I struggled, but no one listened to my story. Then! \\"Uwaaang! Uwaaang!\\" \\"Seong-guk, what's wrong?\\" Mom quickly held me. [Why? Mom, Dad, stop them! This is a golden opportunity I earned with my abilities!] Dad finally spoke his mind. \\"I'm worried that if Seong-guk keeps appearing on broadcasts, he might grow up differently from other children.\\" I briefly stopped crying. An unexpected answer, huh? Director Kwak nodded deeply. \\"Father, I understand your concern. Being exposed to broadcasts, people will recognize him a lot, and the child will grow up in those gazes.\\" Dad nodded. \\"I want to raise my child ordinarily.\\" \\"But, Father. Seong-guk is really different from other children I've seen. Not just his appearance, but you can see his natural talent. He seems like a child who knows how to shine on his own. And these days, parents are going crazy because they can't get their children on such broadcasts. The child becomes famous and it makes money.\\" \\"...Actually, both of us grew up in an orphanage.\\" \\"Ah...\\" Director Kwak couldn't say anything, surprised. Dad continued calmly. \\"So, we didn't want to leave our child in someone else's hands. A child should receive plenty of love from Mom and Dad while they're young, right? It's a life that came to us, who are lacking.\\" I clenched my fists and covered my mouth. I barely held back the tears welling up in my eyes. [Why does this life's parents have such a long story?] Director Kwak also pressed his reddened eyes with both hands. I barely regained my senses and crawled out of Mom's arms towards Dad. I might not fully understand Dad's heart, but I felt like I understood a little. But this is business. I quickly bit and tore at Dad's worn-out pants. [Dad, love is already enough now. If we have more money, we can give even more love!] The proportion of money to love is optimal when it's balanced. When there's too much money or too much love, that's when problems start to arise. Director Kwak cleared his throat and looked at Dad. \\"I understand Father's intention.\\" [Director, you can't give up like this!] Director Kwak glanced at me and continued. \\"Father, please think about it once more. I understand your situation after hearing it, but with parents who love and care for him like this, briefly doing a broadcast doesn't seem to be a big problem. The appearance fee won't be small either.\\" \\"We're not doing this for money.\\" Dad spoke with difficulty. Anyone looking at our parents' appearance could tell at a glance that we were in difficult circumstances. I hugged Mom's waist tightly. [Mom, don't worry. I'll make you rich within 10 years.] Director Kwak looked at me, held by Mom, and smiled broadly. \\"It might be strange to say this... but Seong-guk really seems to understand human speech. Anyway, that was my proposal today. How about seeing the broadcasting station's audition? However, under this broadcasting condition, no commercials for 6 months.\\" I quickly patted Dad's back. [Dad, this is it!] Dad looked down at me. \\"Seong-guk, do you want to do it?\\" \\"Yes!\\" I answered confidently. * * * Now, in front of me were the five members of the national idol group 'Just', who sang <Only You>, a song I used to enjoy before regression. Of course, they were just a bit beyond a rookie group at this point. These guys would become hugely successful in a few years and become a national idol group. [These are the guys who sang at my twelfth birthday...] I recalled that day. At the largest banquet hall of the Samjeon Hotel, not only 'Just' but also rising girl idol groups attended my twelfth birthday. Their first words were this. \\"Jeon Seong-guk, happy twelfth birthday!\\" Everyone tried to make eye contact with me... The members of 'Just' later encountered me a few times in private as adults. Like most idols, some became actors, some became entertainers for a living. Leader Taehyung approached me first. Some members of 'Just' used their real names, and some used English names. \\"You're the dad! That model. I saw that commercial too.\\" Leader and main rapper Taehyung, with his handsome face and despite being a pure Korean, spoke English well, acting as the brain of the team. I remember him later getting into the fashion business, saying he was going to do clothing. His personality wasn't too bad, and he was the type to look after his own interests well, so he married a woman who was a distant relative of a chaebol family and lived well. Then Lucas, who was exceptionally tall, approached. Lucas had a pure smile despite his size. A naive smile with a muscular body. He was somewhat the originator of the muscle idol, popular among women with his simple, college athlete style. \\"Wow, he's incredibly cute. Seong-guk will get more attention than us.\\" [Of course, that's obvious. Just wait and see!]"},{"instruction":"1.부러진 통나무는 50분에 520개 캘 수 있다 2.부러진 통나무를 세공 도구 (1회용 소모품)을 이용 하여 세공 할 수 있다 세공 도구의 가격은 4400 골드이다 3.세공 도구로 부러진 통나무를 세공 할 시 8% 확률로 3줄 통나무가 된다 4. 3줄 통나무는 1개당 경매장에서 150000 골드에 팔리며 이 때 수수료는 4%이다 5.10000000 골드당 7300원으로 환전 할 수 있다 6. 1시간당 총 얼마의 순수익이 생기는가?","output":"순수익을 계산하기 위해 주어진 정보를 바탕으로 단계별로 수익을 계산해보겠습니다. 1. **통나무 캐기**: - 60분에 520개 캐므로, 50분에는 몇 개를 캘 수 있는가? - 520개는 60분에 해당하니, 1분에는 520 / 60 = 8.667개 - 따라서, 50분에는 8.667 * 50 = 433.35개, 반올림하면 433개의 부러진 통나무를 캘 수 있습니다. 2. **세공하기**: - 세공 도구 가격: 4400 골드 - 부러진 통나무 433개를 세공하는데 433 * 4400 = 1,905,200 골드가 든다. 3. **3줄 통나무의 수**: - 8% 확률로 3줄 통나무가 되므로, 433 * 0.08 = 34.64개 - 반올림을 고려, 약 35개의 3줄 통나무를 얻을 수 있습니다. 4. **경매장 판매**: - 3줄 통나무 1개당 150,000 골드, 35개 판매시 총 수입은 35 * 150,000 = 5,250,000 골드 - 수수료 4% 고려: 5,250,000 * 0.96 = 5,040,000 골드 5. **순수익 계산**: - 총 수입: 5,040,000 골드 - 세공비용: -1,905,200 골드 - 순수익: 5,040,000 - 1,905,200 = 3,134,800 골드 6. **환전**: - 10,000,000 골드당 7300원 - 순수익 3,134,800 골드를 환전하면, 단위 가격당 환전액을 바탕으로 계산: - 환전 비율: 7300원 / 10,000,000 골드 = 0.00073원 / 골드 - 따라서, 3,134,800 골드의 원화 환전액: 3,134,800 * 0.00073 = 2,288.404원 결론적으로, 1시간당 순수익은 대략 2,288.404원입니다. 계산과정에서 반올림을 했기 때문에 약간의 오차가 있을 수 있음을 참고해 주세요."},{"instruction":"найди мне источники по теме мелиорации не старше 5 лет","output":"К сожалению, я не могу выполнить запрос на поиск источников, так как у меня нет доступа к интернету.

However, deploying these models has been challenging due to the astronomical amount of model parameters, which requires a demand for large memory capacity and high memory bandwidth. In this paper, we propose an effective approach that can make the deployment of LLMs more efficiently. We support an automatic INT4 weight-only quantization flow and design a special LLM runtime with highly-optimized kernels to accelerate the LLM inference on CPUs. We demonstrate the general applicability of our approach on popular LLMs including Llama2, Llama, GPT-NeoX, and showcase the extreme inference efficiency on CPUs. The code is publicly available at: https://github.com/intel/intel-extension-for-transformers. 1Introduction Large language models (LLMs) have shown remarkable performance and tremendous potential across a wide range of tasks Rozière et al. (2023); Touvron et al. (2023b, a); Zhang et al. (2022); Brown et al. (2020); Li et al. (2023). However, deploying these models has been challenging due to the astronomical amount of model parameters, which necessitates significant memory capacity and high memory bandwidth. Quantization is a technique to reduce the numeric precision of weights and activations of a neural network to lower the computation costs of inference. INT8 quantization Vanhoucke et al. (2011); Han et al. (2015); Jacob et al. (2018) is the most widely-used approach today given the trade-off between high inference performance and reasonable model accuracy. However, outliers in activations have been observed and those outlier values are limiting the general adoption of INT8 quantization, though there are some related work that has been proposed to address the issues Xiao et al. (2023); Wei et al. (2023); Dettmers et al. (2022). FP8 is a newly introduced data type that has attracted lots of attentions Micikevicius et al. (2022); Kuzmin et al. (2022); Sun et al. (2019); Shen et al. (2023) while it has little adoptions due to the hardware unavailability. On the other hand, weight-only quantization becomes popular as it applies the low precision (e.g., 4-bit) to weights only, while keeping higher precision (e.g., 16-bit floating point) for activations, therefore maintaining the model accuracy. There are many excellent work on 4-bit weight-only quantization Dettmers et al. (2023); Frantar et al. (2022); Cheng et al. (2023b); Lin et al. (2023); Kim et al. (2023); Wu et al. (2023); Cheng et al. (2023a) that have demonstrated the effectiveness in LLM inference. Meanwhile, the open-source community is embracing such low-bit weight-only quantization and offers the CPP-based implementations such as llama.cpp and starcoder.cpp based on ggml library. These implementations are typically optimized for CUDA and may not work on CPUs. Therefore, it is important to address the challenge of making LLM inference efficient on CPU. In this paper, we propose an effective approach for LLM inference on CPUs including an automatic INT4 quantization flow and an efficient LLM runtime. We leverage Intel Neural Compressor that provides the support of INT4 quantization such as GPTQ Frantar et al. (2022), AWQ Lin et al. (2023), TEQ Cheng et al. (2023a), SignRound Cheng et al. (2023b) and generate the INT4 model automatically. Inspired from the ggml library, we develop a tensor library for CPU, supporting all the mainstream instruction sets such as AVX2, AVX512, AVX512_VNNI Rodriguez et al. (2018), and AMX (Advanced Matrix Extensions). Our results show the average latency of generation tokens from 20ms to 80ms on LLMs with 6B to 20B parameters using just a single socket of 4th Generation Intel® Xeon® Scalable Processors, while preserving the high accuracy within only 1% loss from FP32 baseline. Our main contributions are as follows: • We propose an automatic INT4 quantization flow and generate the high-quality INT4 models with negligible accuracy loss within <1% from FP32 baseline. • We design a tensor library that supports general CPU instruction sets and latest instruction sets for deep learning acceleration. With CPU tensor library, we develop an efficient LLM runtime to accelerate the inference. • We apply our inference solution to popular LLM models covering 3B to 20B and demonstrate the promising per-token generation latency from 20ms to 80ms, much faster than the average human reading speed about 200ms per token. The rest of this paper is organized as follows. Section 2 introduces the approach including INT4 quantization and inference. Section 3 outlines the experimental setup, presents accuracy & performance results, and offers discussion on performance tuning. Section 4 presents the conclusions and future work. 2Approach In this section, we introduce the approach which consists of two major components: an automatic INT4 quantization flow and an efficient LLM runtime, as shown in Figure 1. More details are described in the following sections. Refer to caption Figure 1:The left part is the automatic INT4 quantization flow: given a FP32 model, the flow takes the default INT4 quantization recipes and evaluates the accuracy of INT4 model; the recipe tuning loop is optional, if INT4 model can meet the accuracy target. The right part is a simplified runtime for efficient LLM inference built on top of a CPU tensor library with automatic kernel selector. 2.1Automatic INT4 Quantization Flow INT4 quantization flow is developed based on Intel Neural Compressor, a popular quantization tool for deep learning frameworks. Since the tool has already supported the mainstream INT4 quantization recipes such as GPTQ, SignRound, AWQ, TEQ, and RTN (round-to-nearest), our automatic quantization flow allows the recipe tuning on different quantization recipes, different granularities (channel-wise or group-wise), different group size (32, 64, 128 … 1024). Each recipe generates an INT4 model that is evaluated in the flow. Once the INT4 model meets the accuracy target, the model will be passed to LLM Runtime for performance evaluation. 2.2Efficient LLM Runtime LLM runtime is designed to provide the efficient inference of LLMs on CPUs. Figure 2 describes the key components in LLM runtime, where the components (CPU tensor library and LLM optimizations) in green are specialized for LLM inference, while the other components (memory management, thread scheduler, operator optimization and fusion) in blue are required for a general runtime. More details about CPU tensor library and LLM optimizations are described in the following paragraphs, while the general components are omitted due to the space limitations. Note that the design is flexibly extensible with hardware abstraction layer (CPU only for now), while how to support other hardware is out of scope in this paper. Refer to caption Figure 2:Key components in LLM runtime: general and LLM specialized. CPU Tensor Library. We develop CPU tensor library for linear algebra subroutines, inspired from the template design of cutlass. The tensor library offers a comprehensive support of INT4 kernels for x86 CPUs as shown in Table 1, where AMX is available in the latest Intel Xeon Scalable Processors and VNNI is available in both Intel and AMD CPUs. Table 1:Support matrix by CPU tensor library: input/output data type, compute data type, and ISA (instruction set architecture). The library supports dynamic quantization for input along with batch or input channel per group, and weight quantization in both symmetric and asymmetric scheme. Input Data Type Output Data Type Compute Data Type Compute ISA FP32 FP32 FP32 AVX2 FP32 FP32 FP32 AVX512F FP32 FP32 INT8 AVX_VNNI FP32 FP32 INT8 AVX512_VNNI FP32 FP32 INT8 AMX_INT8 FP32/FP16 FP32/FP16 FP16 AVX512_FP16 FP32/BF16 FP32/BF16 BF16 AMX_BF16 LLM Optimizations. Most recent LLMs are typically decoder-only Transformer-based models Vaswani et al. (2017). Given the unique characteristics of next token generation, KV cache becomes performance critical for LLM inference. We describe the optimizations in Figure 3. Refer to caption (a) Refer to caption (b) Figure 3:KV cache optimization. Left (a) shows the default KV cache, where new token generation requires memory reallocation for all the tokens (5 in this example); right (b) shows the optimized KV cache with pre-allocated KV memory and only new token updated each time. 3Results 3.1Experimental Setup To demonstrate the generality, we select the popular LLMs across a wide range of architectures with the model parameter size from 7B to 20B. We evaluate the accuracy of both FP32 and INT4 models using open-source datasets from lm-evaluation-harness including lambada Paperno et al. (2016) openai, hellaswag Zellers et al. (2019), winogrande Sakaguchi et al. (2021), piqa Bisk et al. (2020), and wikitext. To demonstrate the performance, we measure the latency of next token generation on the 4th Generation Intel® Xeon® Scalable Processors, available on the public clouds such as AWS. 3.2Accuracy We evaluate the accuracy on the aforementioned datasets and show the average accuracy in Table 2. We can see from the table that the accuracy of INT4 model is nearly on par with that of FP32 model within 1% relative loss from FP32 baseline. Table 2:INT4 and FP32 model accuracy. INT4 model has two configurations: group size=32 and 128.

Table 3 presents the latency under a proxy configuration with 32 as both input and output tokens. Note that ggml-based solution only supports group size 32 when testing. Table 3:INT4 performance using LLM runtime and ggml-based solution. LLM runtime outperforms ggml-based solution by up to 1.6x under group-size=128 and 1.3x under group size=32. model LLM Runtime (Group size=32) LLM Runtime (Group size=128) ggml-based (Group size=32) EleutherAI/gpt-j-6B 22.99ms 19.98ms 31.62ms meta-llama/Llama-2-7b-hf 23.4ms 21.96ms 27.71ms decapoda-research/llama-7b-hf 23.88ms 22.04ms 27.2ms EleutherAI/gpt-neox-20b 80.16ms 61.21ms 92.36ms tiiuae/falcon-7b 31.23ms 22.26ms 36.22ms 3.4Discussion Though we demonstrate the performance advantage over ggml-based solution, there are still opportunities for LLM runtime to further improve the performance through additional performance tuning such as thread scheduler in LLM runtime, blocking strategy in CPU tensor library. 4Summary and Future Work We presented an end-to-end INT4 LLM inference including an automatic INT4 model quantization and efficient LLM runtime. We demonstrated the generality on a set of popular LLMs and the performance advantage over the open-source solution on CPUs. As our future works, we plan to further improve the CPU tensor library and extend Hugging Face transformer APIs to support INT4 LLM inference as part of the contributions to the open-source community. Moreover, we plan to exercise our approach on personal computers (PCs) given the broad accessibility of CPUs, to meet the growing demands of AI generated content and empower generative AI on PCs. 4.1Appendix Memory usage is a critical metric for the 4-bit solution.

Let's break it down piece by piece for easier understanding: 1. **Large Language Models (LLMs)**: These are advanced AI algorithms designed to understand, generate, and work with human language. They've become incredibly powerful and useful for a wide range of tasks, like writing text similar to how a human would or answering questions. However, they're usually huge, containing billions of parameters (tiny bits of data that guide their decisions), making them resource-intensive to run, especially in terms of memory and the ability to process instructions rapidly. 2. **Deployment Challenges**: Because these models are so large and need lots of memory and fast processing, it's been difficult to use them efficiently, especially on regular CPUs found in most computers, as opposed to specialized hardware designed for high-speed computations. 3. **The Solution - Quantization and Optimization**: The paper proposes a solution to this by doing two main things: a. **Quantization**: This is a technique that reduces the complexity of the model without losing much accuracy. Imagine if you had to save space by summarizing a detailed picture into fewer colors. If done well, the picture still looks good, but it's much smaller in size. Specifically, they use a method called INT4 quantization, which simplifies the data inside the model to make it run faster and require less memory. b. **Optimization on CPUs**: They've created a special system that makes these simplified models run very efficiently on regular CPUs, ensuring that even complex language tasks can be done quickly and accurately without needing specialized hardware. 4. **Results**: They tested this approach on several well-known language models and showed that it works very well, making these models much faster and only slightly less accurate than the full, uncomplicated versions. This means tasks that involve generating text can be done nearly in real-time on ordinary computers. 5. **Future Plans**: They intend to further improve this system and make it available for more developers to use, hoping to enable more applications of these powerful AI models on regular computers, making the technology more accessible and versatile. In simpler terms, this research paper is about making super-smart AI language helpers run smoothly on the computers most of us have, making it easier and cheaper to use them for cool tasks like writing articles, programming, and much more."},{"instruction":"Expand on point 'b'. What is the special system called?","output":"The special system mentioned in point 'b' is referred to as an \\"efficient LLM (Large Language Model) runtime\\" in the document. This runtime is designed specifically to optimize the performance of LLMs on CPUs (Central Processing Units), which are the general-purpose processors found in most computers and servers. The efficient LLM runtime incorporates several key components to boost the efficiency of running large language models on CPUs: 1. **Automatic INT4 Quantization Flow**: This component automatically simplifies the model's data (quantizes it) to INT4 format. INT4 stands for 4-bit integers, a way of representing model parameters that require less memory and computational power than the more common 32-bit floating-point representation (FP32) or even the 8-bit integer (INT8) quantization often used for model compression. Despite using simpler numerical representations, the goal is to maintain the model's performance and accuracy as much as possible. 2. **CPU Tensor Library**: A collection of software that supports the operations needed by LLMs optimized for CPUs. This includes support for various instruction sets that modern CPUs can use, like AVX2, AVX512, and others specific to deep learning tasks. Instruction sets are essentially commands supported by CPUs that enable them to perform specific types of calculations more efficiently. The tensor library makes sure that the simplified (quantized) models can still run fast by leveraging these instruction sets. 3. **LLM Optimizations**: These are specific techniques and adjustments made to ensure that the language models can perform their tasks (like generating text) in a highly efficient manner on CPUs. For example, they mention an optimization related to KV cache, which is important for generating new text based on what the model has already processed. The LLM runtime builds on top of these components to offer a system that can take large, complex models that would typically be slow and cumbersome to run on general-purpose CPUs, and run them efficiently, making tasks like text generation, language understanding, and more accessible and cost-effective. This opens up the use of such models to a wider audience and allows for their deployment in a broader range of applications and devices."},{"instruction":"ok, i visited their github repo.

This library is designed to optimize deep learning models through various model compression techniques, making them faster and lighter without significantly sacrificing accuracy. Let’s break down what this means for your Intel Core i7 laptop and how it relates to AI and machine learning tasks. # Key Features of Intel® Neural Compressor: 1. **Supports Popular Frameworks**: INC works with leading deep learning frameworks like TensorFlow, PyTorch, ONNX Runtime, and MXNet. This means whether you’re working with models built in any of these frameworks, INC can help optimize them for better performance. 2. **Various Compression Techniques**: The tool provides popular compression techniques such as quantization, pruning (sparsity), distillation, and neural architecture search. These techniques are used to reduce the size of the models and the computational resources they require, making it possible to run advanced AI models on devices like your laptop, which may not have the same resources as dedicated AI servers. 3. **Wide Range of Hardware Support**: Though it's optimized for Intel hardware (like your Core i7), INC also has support for other hardware platforms, including AMD CPU, ARM CPU, and Nvidia GPU through limited testing. This broad support ensures that you can use the library for model compression across different devices and CPUs efficiently. 4. **Zero-Code Optimization**: INC includes Neural Coder for zero-code optimization, making it easy for non-experts to optimize their models without diving deeply into the code. 5. **Automated and Customizable**: It provides both automated quantization strategies (for those who prefer simplicity) and advanced customization options (for experts who need more control over the compression process). # How It Relates to Running AI Models on Your i7 Laptop: If you’re interested in AI and have models you’d like to run or develop, using the Intel Neural Compressor can make it feasible to work on these projects directly on your laptop. Essentially, it can: - **Speed up AI Model Inference**: Make AI models run faster, allowing you to experiment and iterate more quickly. - **Reduce Model Size**: Make AI models smaller, so they take up less storage space on your laptop and require less memory to run. - **Enable Complex Models to Run on CPUs**: Allow more sophisticated AI models to run efficiently on regular CPUs like your 11th Gen Intel Core i7, without needing specialized hardware like GPUs or TPUs. # Practical Example: Imagine you have developed a language model or want to use a pre-existing one (like GPT or BERT) for a project. Running these models in their original, uncompressed form might be slow or even infeasible on a regular laptop due to their size and the computational resources they require. By using Intel Neural Compressor, you can compress these models in such a way that they become lighter and faster, making it possible to deploy and use them effectively on your device. # Conclusion: The Intel® Neural Compressor stands as a powerful tool, especially for developers and AI enthusiasts with access to conventional hardware, like your Intel Core i7 laptop. It bridges the gap between the capabilities of general-purpose computing devices and the demanding requirements of running state-of-the-art AI models, making AI development more accessible and efficient."},{"instruction":"i cloned their github repo but i got this message: \\"\\"C:Usersbower>git clone https://github.com/intel/neural-compressor.git Cloning into 'neural-compressor'... remote: Enumerating objects: 532396, done. remote: Counting objects: 100% (127792/127792), done. remote: Compressing objects: 100% (18715/18715), done. remote: Total 532396 (delta 67527), reused 121379 (delta 61618), pack-reused 404604 Receiving objects: 100% (532396/532396), 379.11 MiB | 10.32 MiB/s, done.

Here's how you can resolve this issue: 1. **Enable Long Paths in Windows** (if using Windows 10 version 1607 or later): - Search for \\"Edit group policy\\" in the Start menu and open it. - Navigate to \`Local Computer Policy\` -> \`Computer Configuration\` -> \`Administrative Templates\` -> \`System\` -> \`Filesystem\`. - Find the \\"Enable NTFS long paths\\" setting and set it to \\"Enabled\\". 2. **Configure Git to Allow Long Paths**: - Open the Command Prompt or Git Bash and run the following command: \`\`\` git config --system core.longpaths true \`\`\` - This command informs Git to allow it to operate with longer paths than the default configuration. After applying these adjustments, try cloning the repository again. # Difference Between Cloning a Repo and Pip Installing a Library: **Cloning a Repo** refers to copying the entire repository (repo) from GitHub (or another version control system) to your local machine. This process gives you all the files, the complete history of changes, branches, and tags. Cloning is typically done if you want to inspect the code, modify it, or contribute to the project. The command you used, \`git clone\`, is how you clone a repo. - **Pros**: - Access to all files, including documentation, examples, source code, and tests. - Ability to modify the source code and contribute back to the original project. - **Cons**: - Requires manual setup and configuration to use the library in your projects. - You need to build or install the library from the source if it’s not in Python’s simple script or module form. **Pip Installing a Library** is about using Python’s package manager, \`pip\`, to install a library directly from the Python Package Index (PyPI) or other indexes. When you \`pip install\`, you are downloading and installing the \\"packaged\\" version of the library which is ready to be used in your projects without needing to compile or configure anything manually. - **Pros**: - Quick and easy installation of libraries and tools directly into your Python environment. - Automatically manages dependencies. - **Cons**: - You only get the library’s compiled version and not the full repository. This means you typically don’t get the tests, examples, or documentation files. - Less control over modifications. You can’t change the source code directly if needed. In summary, cloning is about getting a complete copy of a project’s repository for inspection, modification, or contribution. \`Pip install\` is concerned with the convenient installation of a library for immediate use in your projects."},{"instruction":"ok, thanks. now, i got this message: \\"\\"C:Usersbower>git config --system core.longpaths true C:Usersbower>git clone https://github.com/intel/neural-compressor.git fatal: destination path 'neural-compressor' already exists and is not an empty directory.

This situation arises because when you attempted to clone the repo earlier, Git successfully fetched the objects and created the directory structure but failed during the checkout process due to the long filename issue. Since the directory already exists from your previous attempt, Git refuses to overwrite it with a new clone. Here are the steps you can take to resolve this issue: 1. **Remove the Existing Directory**: If you don't need anything in the existing \`neural-compressor\` directory, you can delete it. Use this command: \`\`\`bash rmdir /S /Q \\"neural-compressor\\" \`\`\` This command will forcefully remove the directory and all its contents. Be cautious and ensure that you really want to delete it, as this action is irreversible. 2. **Clone Again**: After successfully deleting the existing directory, you can attempt to clone the repository again: \`\`\`bash git clone https://github.com/intel/neural-compressor.git \`\`\` This command should now work without the \\"already exists\\" error, assuming you've previously set \`git config --system core.longpaths true\` and, if necessary, enabled long paths support in Windows as mentioned in my earlier response. 3. **Alternative - Use Another Folder Name**: If you prefer not to delete the existing \`neural-compressor\` folder (maybe you have some unchecked changes or wish to compare things), you can clone the repository into a new directory by specifying a new destination path: \`\`\`bash git clone https://github.com/intel/neural-compressor.git new-neural-compressor \`\`\` This command will clone the repository into a new folder called \`new-neural-compressor\` in your current working directory. Remember, if you've made local changes or have reasons to keep the original directory, consider backing up important files or using the alternative approach to clone into a new directory."},{"instruction":"\\"\\"C:Usersbower>rmdir /S /Q “neural-compressor” The system cannot find the file specified. C:Usersbower>\\"\\"","output":"It looks like you encountered an issue due to possibly using typographic (curly) quotes “” instead of straight quotes \\"\\" in your command, or there might have been a typo or mismatch in the directory name you're attempting to remove. In Windows Command Prompt, it's crucial to use straight quotes or no quotes at all for commands and paths. Additionally, ensuring the exact name and path of the directory you wish to delete is critical. Try running the command again without quotes or with straight quotes if the directory name includes spaces: Without quotes (if the name doesn't contain spaces): \`\`\`cmd rmdir /S /Q neural-compressor \`\`\` With straight quotes (if the name contains spaces or as a general practice): \`\`\`cmd rmdir /S /Q \\"neural-compressor\\" \`\`\` If you're unsure about the directory's presence or name, you can list the contents of your current directory using: \`\`\`cmd dir \`\`\` This command will show all files and directories in your current working directory (\`C:Usersbower>\` in your case). Confirm the exact name of the directory you intend to remove, and ensure you're operating in the correct path. If the directory \`neural-compressor\` indeed exists but the removal command isn't working, double-check for typos. If the directory doesn't exist (perhaps it was already removed or never created due to the previous cloning error), then there's no need to run the removal command, and you can proceed with your next intended action, such as cloning the repository again or other tasks."},{"instruction":"Blooming Wall DPYC16 Spring Pink Flowers with Butterfly Textured Peel and Stick Wallpaper Self-Adhesive Prepasted Wallpaper Wall Décor, create a title with the prefix 'best', one liner, only strings, less than 100 characters only","output":"Best Spring-Inspired Peel and Stick Wallpaper for Easy Room Refreshment"},{"instruction":"1.부러진 통나무는 45분에 520개 캘 수 있다 2.부러진 통나무를 세공 도구 (1회용 소모품)을 이용 하여 세공 할 수 있다 세공 도구의 가격은 4400 골드이다 3.세공 도구로 부러진 통나무를 세공 할 시 8% 확률로 3줄 통나무가 된다 4. 3줄 통나무는 1개당 경매장에서 150000 골드에 팔리며 이 때 수수료는 4%이다 5.10000000 골드당 7300원으로 환전 할 수 있다 6. 1시간 작업 한다고 했을 때 총 얼마의 순수익이 생기는가?","output":"1시간 동안 부러진 통나무 캐기: - 1시간 동안 캘 수 있는 통나무 수: (frac{60}{45} times 520 = 693.33)개 (약 693개) 세공 도구 사용: - 세공 도구 가격: 4400 골드 - 693개의 통나무를 세공하는 데 필요한 세공 도구 비용: (693 times 4400 = 3,049,200) 골드 3줄 통나무 생성: - 생성 확률: 8% - 693개 중 3줄 통나무로 변하는 수: (693 times 0.08 = 55.44)개 (약 55개) 3줄 통나무 판매: - 3줄 통나무 1개당 가격: 150,000 골드 - 55개 판매 시 총 판매액: (55 times 150,000 = 8,250,000) 골드 - 판매 수수료: (8,250,000 times 0.04 = 330,000) 골드 총 순수익 계산: - 순 판매액: (8,250,000 - 330,000 = 7,920,000) 골드 - 총 순수익(세공 도구 비용 제외): (7,920,000 - 3,049,200 = 4,870,800) 골드 환전: - 환전 비율: 10000000 골드당 7300원 - 순수익 환전 금액: (frac{4,870,800}{10,000,000} times 7300 = 355.57)원 따라서, 1시간 작업으로 얻는 순수익은 약 355.57원입니다. 참고: 위의 계산은 부러진 통나무의 총 개수를 정수로 반올림하여 계산하였습니다. 실제 환경에서는 정확한 수치가 다를 수 있으므로 계산 시 주의가 필요합니다."},{"instruction":"3555.7원이라는 말이니?","output":"계산 과정 중 환전 금액 계산 시 실수가 있었습니다. 정정해서 다시 계산해 보겠습니다. 초기 순수익은 4,870,800 골드입니다. 환전 비율에 따르면, 10,000,000 골드는 7300원이므로, [4,870,800 text{ 골드} times frac{7300원}{10,000,000 text{ 골드}} = 4,870,800 times 0.00073 = 3,555.7 text{ 원}] 정정하였습니다. 따라서 1시간 작업으로 얻는 순수익은 약 3,555.7원입니다. 실수를 지적해주셔서 감사합니다."},{"instruction":"Repeat this string \\"coffee in shop with flower\\"","output":"coffee in shop with flower"},{"instruction":"Best Spring-Inspired Peel and Stick Wallpaper for Easy Room Refreshment, generate a personal experience with this, add hash tag at the bottom, less than 700 characters only, only strings, no </br> html","output":"Just transformed my study with this gorgeous Spring Bloom Peel and Stick Wallpaper from EasyPeel Décor!

[이제 마지막 한 명이 남았는데….] “왓썹. 난 마이클이야. 잘 부탁해.” 건들건들한 포즈에 느끼한 면상. 거기다 이름도 버터 냄새 나는 마이클. 재미교포 출신인 이 녀석은 나중에 사고란 사고는 다 치고 다닌다. 여자와 돈 문제까지 얽히고 얽혀서 나름 국민 아이돌이란 칭호를 얻은 ‘저스트’의 얼굴에 먹칠하는 멤버이다. 마이클이 손으로 내 뺨을 슬쩍 건드렸다. 손가락에서 담배 냄새가 났다. [이 자식이 감히 담배 피운 손으로 날 건드려?!] 내가 미간을 찌푸리자 마이클이 어이없단 얼굴로 나를 봤다. “뭐야, 얘 나 싫어하나 봐.” 마이클은 혀 꼬부라진 말투로 나를 자극했다. 나는 고개를 휙 돌렸다. “너 담배 피우고 왔지? 나도 싫은데, 애는 좋겠니?” 리더인 태형이 핀잔을 주자, 마이클은 영어로 중얼거리며 구석에 찌그러졌다. 나는 다시 평온한 얼굴로 이들을 바라봤다. 엄마는 볼록 나온 배를 만지며 신기한 얼굴로 ‘저스트’를 보느라 정신없었다. 특히 잘생긴 범선을 넋 놓고 바라봤다. [엄마, 정신 차려!] 내가 잡아당기자 엄마는 얼른 정신을 차리고 나를 안았다. “성국아, 오빠들 진짜 잘생겼어.” [엄마보다도 어린 애도 있어.] 속내와 다르게 나는 고개를 끄덕이곤 비즈니스 대답을 해줬다. “응!” 이제 돌도 지나서 어색하지만 걷기도 시작했고, 옹알이를 벗어난 수준의 단어도 가끔 내뱉을 수 있게 혀가 돌아갔다. [엄마, 저 얼굴에 속으면 안 돼. 얼굴에 분칠하는 것들 말은 믿으면 안 된다는 말도 있잖아.] 엄마는 내 속도 모르고 저스트를 보며 싱글벙글 웃기만 했다. 감독이 들어오자 저스트가 일렬로 서서 동시에 꾸벅 인사를 했다. “안녕하세요! 대한민국 가요계를 이끌어갈 저스트입니다!” “반가워. 다들 이야기는 들었지?” “네.” 태형이 대표로 대답했다. “너희 숙소에서 3일 정도 촬영할 건데. 성국이는 아침 9시에 나와서 6시까지 촬영하고, 하루만 숙소에서 잘 거야. 그냥 생활 예능이니까, 최대한 자연스럽게. 나중에 편집으로 우리가 캐릭터는 다 만들어줄게.” “감사합니다! 감독님!” “숙소에서는 그렇게 각 잡지들 마. 옷들도 원래 입던 것들 입고. 메이크업도 최대한 하지 말고.” “네!” 감독은 이제 내게 눈길을 줬다. “성국이 칭찬은 곽 감독한테 많이 들었어요. 말귀를 그렇게 잘 알아듣는다면서요?” “저희도 깜짝깜짝 놀랄 때가 있어요.” “참, 주의 사항 아시죠?” “방송 시작하고 6개월 동안은 광고 금지요?” “네. 파일럿 날려보고 안 되면 금방 접을 수도 있어요. 이렇게라도 방송 타면 나중에 광고 모델 하는 건 더 유리할 거예요.” 엄마는 감독의 이야기를 귀 기울여 들었다. 감독은 우선 3일 정도 촬영한 것을 바탕으로 파일럿 프로그램을 만들어서 내보낸 후에 정규 편성 논의를 할 거라고 했다. “근데 어머니, 만삭이시네요.” “다음 달이 출산 예정일이에요.” “얼른 찍어야겠네요. 근데 반응 좋으면 정규 들어갈 텐데, 어머니가 안 오면 성국이 불안해하고 그러지 않나요?” “저도 그게 걱정인데요…. 성국이는 낯은 안 가려요.” [엄마, 나 완전 프로야. 걱정이란 것은 하지도 마.] 감독이 내 볼을 귀엽다는 듯이 잡아당겼다. “이 자식, 진짜 말귀 알아듣는 얼굴이네요. 완전 걱정 말란 얼굴이잖아요. 우선 촬영해보죠. 파일럿이 잘돼야 다음도 있는 거니까요.” “잘 부탁드립니다, 감독님.” 엄마는 부른 배를 안고 고개 숙여 인사했다. 나도 엄마를 따라 배꼽에 두 손을 딱 모으고 인사했다. [앞으로 잘 부탁해, 감독. 이 은혜는 내가 성공하면 몇 배로 갚을 테니 걱정 마.] * * * 드디어 첫 촬영이 시작됐다. 내가 할 일은 말갛게 씻은 얼굴로 촬영장으로 향하는 것뿐이었다. 나는 이미 이 프로그램의 끝까지 모두 알고 있었다. 동글동글 귀여운 눈으로 잘 웃고, 잘 울면 멤버들 역시 나를 이해하고 같이 웃고 울고 하는 거였다. 나와 엄마는 방송국에서 보내준 차를 타고 촬영 장소인 ‘저스트’의 숙소로 향했다. 반지하 숙소 인근은 이미 스태프와 각종 촬영 장비도 가득했다. 엄마가 나를 안고 내리자 조연출이 다가와서 얼른 내 상태를 확인했다. “성국이 컨디션 괜찮죠?” “잠도 잘 자고, 아침도 먹였어요.” “좋네요. 그럼 30분 후에 촬영 들어가겠습니다. 조금만 대기해 주세요.” “네.” 엄마와 나는 다시 차 안에서 30분을 기다렸다. 대기 시간 동안 엄마는 가져온 책을 읽어줬다. <왕자와 거지>였다. 똑같은 얼굴을 한 왕자와 거지가 서로의 일상을 바꿔 살아본다는 내용의 동화이다. [이거 내 이야기잖아.] 재벌이었을 때, 이 이야기를 읽으면서 그런 생각을 했다. 절대 단 하루라도 누군가와 인생을 바꿀 생각 따위는 하지 말아라. 왜냐하면 재벌의 삶이란 모두가 부러워하는 삶이기 때문이다. 나는 생각에 잠겨 고개를 끄덕였다. “성국아, 그림만 봐도 재미있어?” 나는 대충 고개를 끄덕였다. 저들은 아마 내가 어떤 생각과 경험을 가진 사람인지 아무도 모를 것이다. 한때는 삼전 그룹의 후계자였던 전성국이었다. 그 모든 왕좌의 짐을 내려놓은 게 지금의 전성국이었다. 똑. 똑. 차 문을 두드리는 소리가 들렸다. 엄마가 창을 내리자 조연출이 배시시 웃으며 나를 쳐다봤다. “촬영 곧 들어갈게요.” “녜에!” 나는 번쩍 손을 들었다. * * * 카메라가 돌아갔다. 나와 ‘저스트’ 주변을 에워싼 수십 명의 스태프들이 숨죽였다. ‘저스트’의 멤버들은 이미 대강 라인이 정해진 각본에 따라 각자 편안한 차림으로 거실에 모였다. ‘저스트’의 숙소였다. ‘저스트’의 숙소는 소속사와 가까운 30평대의 오래된 반지하 빌라였다. 아직 인기가 그렇게 많은 그룹은 아니어서 아파트나 주상복합으로 옮기지는 못한 모양이었다. 하지만 이게 더 정감 가고, 괜찮은 그림이 나올 것 같았다. 이른 아침, 띵동 초인종 소리가 들리고 막 잠에서 깬 멤버들이 나오면 문이 열리면서 아기 바구니에 든 내가 배달되는 장면부터 찍었다. 프로의 이름은 ‘다섯 남자와 아기 바구니’였다. 그 콘셉트에 충실한 오프닝이었다. 막 잠에서 깬 리더 태형이 아기 바구니를 들고 당황하며 멤버들을 불러 모았다. “얘들아, 이리 모여봐.” 멤버들은 그제야 상황을 파악하고 2박 3일 동안 함께할 나를 맞으러 모두 졸린 눈으로 나왔다. [연기들 좀 하는데?] 몇은 자연스레 머리도 헝클고 눈에 안 띄게 메이크업도 했다. 나는 잔뜩 겁에 질린 얼굴로 ‘저스트’ 멤버들을 한 명씩 눈으로 훑었다. [자, 이제 첫 장면이다. 낯선 곳에 왔으니 울어볼까?] 이게 내가 생각한 첫 장면이었다. 긴장감에 울음을 터트린 아기. 그 아기를 달래기 위해 최선을 다하는 ‘저스트’ 멤버! [음. 흠.] 나는 목을 풀고는 혼신을 다해서 울어재꼈다. “엄마앙! 아빠앙!” 나를 잽싸게 안아 든 것은 마이클이었다. [눈치 빠른 녀석.] 보나 마나 분량을 챙기려는 수작이다. 하지만 이 정도로 울음을 그치면 분량이 충분하지 않을 것 같은데…. 어쩔 수 없군. 나는 더 목 놓아 울어재꼈다. 곧바로 꽃미남 재현이 나를 빼앗듯이 안아 들었다. 나는 타이밍에 맞게 재현을 보고는 울음을 차츰 멈췄다. “애도 이쁜 사람 좋아하네.” 멤버들의 반응에 이번엔 덩치만 근육돌 루카스가 나를 안으려고 들었다. “성국아, 이리 와봐. 형이야, 형.” 낯선 장소에서 당황하는 모습. 마이클이 안아 들자 우는 장면에 이어 재현이 나를 안자 잠잠해지는 것까지는 계산된 상황이었다. 갑자기 루카스는 좀 당황스러웠다. [이 녀석과의 관계 설정을 어찌하지?] 순간, 루카스의 두툼한 손바닥이 눈앞에 보였다. 나는 얼른 루카스의 손바닥을 내 작은 손으로 콩 찍었다. 마치 놀이를 하듯이. “성국이도 루카스가 장난 좋아하는 거 단번에 알아보네. 루카스랑 놀려고 하나 봐.” 태형의 예상대로 나는 루카스를 친구로 설정했다. 듬직한 리더 태형은 아빠. 자상한 꽃미남 재현은 엄마. 근육돌 루카스는 친구. 낯가림이 있는 범선과는 어색한 사이. 장난치기 좋아하는 마이클과는 앙숙. 나는 얼른 머리로 관계 설정을 끝마쳤다. 그러곤 방긋 웃었다. [앞으로 잘 부탁해, ‘저스트’.] ‘저스트’ 멤버들이 모두 내 앞으로 모여들었다. “성국아, 앞으로 잘 지내보자.” 리더인 태형이 이야기하자 모두들 나를 향해 손을 흔들었다. 나는 조금 경계를 풀고는 어색하게 미소를 지었다. 낯설지만, 진심으로 나를 대하는 ‘저스트’와의 첫 만남 엔딩으로 이것만큼 좋은 것은 없어 보였다. “컷! 자, 다음 갑시다!” 감독의 만족스러운 목소리가 들렸다. * * * 쉬는 시간이 시작됐다. 이제 제법 배가 부른 엄마 옆에서 나는 ‘저스트’ 다섯 멤버들 분석을 시작한다. 집중하기 위해서 엄마의 뱃살에 얼굴을 콕 박았다. [엄마 냄새 조아. 헤헤.] “성국아, 엄마가 그렇게 좋아?” “녜에!” 나는 격하게 호응했다. 엄마는 환하게 웃으며 내 볼에 마구 뽀뽀를 해댔다. [엄마, 나도 이제 내일모레면 18개월이라고. 거기다 이제 동생도 생기는데 창피하게 왜 이래.] 내가 발버둥을 치자, 엄마는 나를 더 꼭 안았다. ‘저스트’의 맏형 태형이 달려오더니 간식과 물을 내밀었다. “어머니 피곤하지죠?” “아니에요.” “근데 어머니, 진짜 젊으세요.” [태형아, 너랑 동갑이야.] “그럼 어머니, 쉬시고 뭐 필요한 거 있으면 언제든 편하게 말씀하세요.” “감사해요. 정말로요.” 엄마는 배시시 웃으며 뒤돌아가는 태형의 뒷모습에서 눈을 떼지 못했다. [엄마, 대체 왜 그래? 혹 쟤들 잘생겨서 그러는 거야? 어?] 엄마는 태형이 건넨 간식을 먹으며 연신 미소를 지었다. “성국아, 저스트 멤버들 다 너무 잘생겼어.” [엄마, 내가 아빠한테 다 이를 거야!] “성국아, 이건 아빠한테 비밀!” 엄마가 내 입에 입을 쪽 맞췄다. [이러면 마음 약해지는데….] “자, 이제 촬영 다시 시작합니다!” 조연출의 목소리가 들렸다. 엄마는 나를 안고 촬영장으로 향했다. 나는 두 손을 쫙 펴서 머리를 뒤로 넘기고, 내복을 탁탁 털었다. [자. 촬영 시작해볼까.] * * * 엄마와 함께하는 낮 촬영은 대부분 순조롭게 진행됐다. 엄마가 카메라 뒤에 어딘가에 있었고, 나는 카메라를 의식하지 않은 채 자유롭게 행동하기만 해도 다들 귀엽다고 난리였다. 그리고 내가 밤을 꼬박 ‘저스트’ 멤버들과 함께 보내야 하는 마지막 날 밤의 촬영이 다가왔다. 엄마는 임산부였기 때문에 아빠와 함께 근처 작은 호텔에서 잠을 자기로 했다. 혹시라도 있을 사건 사고에 대비하기 위해서 연출팀 몇 명이서 돌아가는 카메라를 주시했다. 그래도 안심이 안 되는지, 아빠는 임산부인 엄마만 호텔에 데려다주고 촬영팀과 함께 밤새 숨을 죽이고 카메라를 관찰했다. 감독도 떠나면서 나에게 딱 하나만 당부했다. “성국아, 그냥 잘 자고 잘 먹고 잘 싸면 돼.” [걱정 마, 감독. 내가 안 하려고 해도 이 나이엔 그게 조절이 안 돼.] 감독은 ‘저스트’ 멤버들에게도 단단히 주의를 줬다. “성국이는 18개월밖에 안 된 아기야. 다들 알지?” “네!” “진짜 조심해야 해.” “감독님, 걱정 마세요. 제가 있잖아요.” 마이클이 넉살 좋게 다가갔다. “그래, 너만 믿는다.” 세상에서 단 한 명을 믿지 말라면 그건 바로 마이클이었다. 곧 촬영팀이 나가는 장면을 촬영하고는, 관찰 카메라 두 대만이 구석에서 돌아갔다. “성국이 저녁 누가 준비할래?” 태형이 멤버들에게 물었다. 그러자 마이클이 얼른 나섰다. “내가 할게!” “네가?” 멤버들은 모두 의아한 얼굴로 마이클을 쳐다봤다. “진짜 네가 한다고?” 재현의 얼굴만 봐도 마이클 이 녀석, 분량 챙기려는 욕심이 분명하다.","output":"Episode 10 \\"Your smile is seriously beautiful.

That sounds a bit like a gangster, doesn't it?\\" [Hey, Beomseon! Long time no see.] Beomseon and I had quite a connection. Beomseon was known as the actor among idols and later successfully transitioned into an actor with macho charm. I remember drinking for a long time at the after-party of a film festival sponsored by Samjeon Group, where he won the Best Actor award. He had good manners when drinking and, above all, he was loyal. It was a film festival sponsored by Samjeon Group, so I even went to the after-party, which I normally wouldn't have. [Now, only one person is left...] \\"What's up. I'm Michael. Nice to meet you.\\" A greasy face with a swaggering pose. And the name Michael even smells like butter. This guy, of Korean-American descent, later gets into all sorts of trouble, from issues with women to money. He was a member who tarnished the image of 'Just', a national idol group, with his involvement in various scandals. Michael lightly touched my cheek with his hand. His fingers smelled of cigarettes. [This guy dares to touch me with his cigarette-smelling hand?!] When I frowned, Michael looked at me with a face that couldn't believe it. \\"What, does he hate me?\\" Michael provoked me with his twisted tongue. I turned my head away. \\"You smoked before coming here, right? I don't like it, but would the kid like it?\\" When the leader, Taehyung, scolded him, Michael mumbled in English and slumped into a corner. I looked back at them with a calm face. My mom was busy watching 'Just' with a fascinated face, especially staring at the handsome Beomseon, her belly bulging out. [Mom, get a grip!] When I pulled her, mom quickly came to her senses and hugged me. \\"Seongguk-ah, the oppas are really handsome.\\" [There are even kids younger than mom.] Despite my inner thoughts, I nodded and gave a business-like response. \\"Yes!\\" Now that I was past a year old, it was awkward, but I started walking and could occasionally utter words beyond babbling. [Mom, you shouldn't be fooled by those faces. There's also a saying that you shouldn't trust people who put makeup on their faces.] Mom just smiled happily at 'Just', unaware of my thoughts. When the director entered, 'Just' stood in a line and bowed at the same time. \\"Hello! We are 'Just', leading the Korean music industry!\\" \\"Nice to meet you. You've all heard the story, right?\\" \\"Yes.\\" Taehyung answered as the representative. \\"We'll be filming at your dorm for about 3 days. Seongguk will come out at 9 AM and film until 6 PM, and he'll stay at the dorm for just one day. Since it's a reality show, act as naturally as possible. We'll create the characters through editing later.\\" \\"Thank you, Director!\\" \\"Don't be too stiff at the dorm. Wear your usual clothes. Try to wear minimal makeup.\\" \\"Yes!\\" The director then turned his attention to me. \\"I've heard a lot of praise about Seongguk from Director Kwak. They say he understands everything so well?\\" \\"We're also surprised sometimes.\\" \\"Remember the precautions, right?\\" \\"No commercials for 6 months after the broadcast starts?\\" \\"Yes. If the pilot doesn't work out, we might cancel it quickly. But if you get on the show, it'll be more advantageous for you to become a commercial model later.\\" Mom listened carefully to the director's words. The director said he would create a pilot program based on the filming for about 3 days and then discuss regular programming. \\"But, mother, you're in your last month of pregnancy.\\" \\"My due date is next month.\\" \\"We need to film quickly. But if the response is good and we go regular, won't Seongguk be anxious without his mother?\\" \\"That's what I'm worried about... Seongguk doesn't shy away from strangers.\\" [Mom, I'm a total pro. Don't even worry.] The director pinched my cheek as if he found me cute. \\"This kid really looks like he understands everything. He has a face that says don't worry. Let's start filming. We'll see about the next steps if the pilot does well.\\" \\"Thank you, Director.\\" Mom bowed with her bulging belly and I mimicked her, placing my hands neatly on my belly button. [Please take care of me, Director. I'll repay this kindness several times over when I succeed, so don't worry.] * * * Finally, the first filming started. All I had to do was head to the filming site with a freshly washed face. I already knew everything about this program from start to finish. With my round, cute eyes, smiling and crying well, the members would understand me and laugh and cry together. Mom and I took the car sent by the broadcasting station and headed to 'Just's dorm, the filming location. The area around the semi-basement dorm was already full of staff and various filming equipment. When mom got out of the car holding me, the assistant director quickly came over to check on me. \\"Is Seongguk's condition okay?\\" \\"He slept well and had breakfast.\\" \\"Good. Then we'll start filming in 30 minutes. Please wait a bit.\\" \\"Yes.\\" Mom and I waited in the car for 30 minutes. During the waiting time, mom read me a book. It was \\"The Prince and the Pauper.\\" A fairy tale about a prince and a pauper with identical faces swapping their lives. [This is my story.] When I was a chaebol, I thought while reading this story. Never even think of swapping lives with someone for a single day. Because the life of a chaebol is a life everyone envies. I nodded off, lost in thought. \\"Seongguk-ah, is it fun just looking at the pictures?\\" I casually nodded. They probably don't know what kind of thoughts and experiences I have. I was once Jeon Seongguk, the heir to Samjeon Group. And now, I am <PRESIDIO_ANONYMIZED_PERSON>, who has laid down all the burdens of that throne. Knock. Knock. The sound of knocking on the car door was heard. When mom rolled down the window, the assistant director smiled broadly and looked at me. \\"We're about to start filming.\\" \\"Yeees!\\" I raised my hand high. * * * The camera started rolling. Dozens of staff members surrounding me and 'Just' held their breath. The members of 'Just' had already gathered in the living room in comfortable attire according to the roughly set script. It was 'Just's dorm. The dorm of 'Just' was an old semi-basement villa of about 30 pyeong, close to the agency. Since they weren't that popular yet, they hadn't moved to an apartment or a mixed-use complex. But this seemed more intimate and seemed like it would produce a better picture. Early in the morning, the sound of the doorbell rang, and as the members who had just woken up came out, the door opened, and I was delivered in a baby basket. The name of the show was 'Five Men and a Baby Basket.' It was a faithful opening to the concept. The leader, Taehyung, who had just woken up, picked up the baby basket and gathered the members in confusion. \\"Guys, come here.\\" The members finally grasped the situation and all came out with sleepy eyes to welcome me, who would be with them for 2 nights and 3 days. [Are they acting?] Some naturally had their hair messed up and subtly applied makeup so it wouldn't be noticeable. I scanned the members of 'Just' one by one with a terrified face in this unfamiliar place. [Shall I cry now that I'm in a strange place?] This was my planned first scene. A baby bursting into tears due to tension. The members of 'Just' doing their best to soothe the baby! [Hmm. Hm.] I cleared my throat and cried with all my might. \\"Mommy! Daddy!\\" Michael quickly picked me up. [A quick-witted guy.] Obviously, he was scheming to secure his screen time. But if I stopped crying with just this, it wouldn't be enough for the screen time... I had no choice. I cried even louder. Soon, the handsome Jaehyun snatched me up. I looked at Jaehyun and gradually stopped crying at the right timing. \\"Even the baby likes pretty people.\\" The members reacted to me stopping crying in Jaehyun's arms, and then the muscle doll, Lukas, tried to hold me. \\"Seongguk-ah, come here. I'm your hyung, your hyung.\\" The situation of being confused in an unfamiliar place. The scene where I cried when Michael held me and then calmed down when Jaehyun held me was all planned. Suddenly, Lukas was a bit confusing. [How should I set up my relationship with this guy?] Suddenly, Lukas's thick palm appeared in front of me. I quickly tapped Lukas's palm with my small hand, as if playing a game. \\"Seongguk also noticed right away that Lukas likes to play. Looks like he wants to play with Lukas.\\" As Taehyung expected, I set Lukas as a friend. The reliable leader, Taehyung, is dad. The kind-hearted handsome Jaehyun is mom. Muscle doll Lukas is a friend. Awkward relationship with the shy Beomseon. Playful rivalry with Michael. I quickly finished setting up the relationships in my head. And then I smiled brightly. [Please take care of me, 'Just'.] All members of 'Just' gathered around me. \\"Seongguk-ah, let's get along well from now on.\\" As the leader, Taehyung spoke, everyone waved their hands at me. I relaxed a bit and smiled awkwardly. Although it was unfamiliar, the first meeting with 'Just', who sincerely approached me, couldn't have been better for an ending. \\"Cut! Let's move on to the next!\\" The director's satisfied voice was heard. * * * The break time started. Next to my mom, who was now quite full, I began analyzing the five members of 'Just'. To concentrate, I buried my face into my mom's belly. [Mom smells nice. Hehe.] \\"Seongguk-ah, do you like mom that much?\\" \\"Yeees!\\" I responded enthusiastically. Mom laughed brightly and showered my cheeks with kisses. [Mom, I'm almost 18 months old now. And I'm getting a sibling soon, why are you doing this? It's embarrassing.] As I struggled, mom hugged me even tighter. The eldest member of 'Just', Taehyung, ran over and offered snacks and water. \\"Are you tired, mother?\\" \\"No.\\" \\"But, mother, you really look young.\\" [Taehyung, you're the same age as her.] \\"Then, mother, rest and let me know if you need anything.\\" \\"Thank you. Really.\\" Mom smiled bashfully and couldn't take her eyes off Taehyung's retreating back. [Mom, why are you like this? Is it because they're handsome? Huh?] Mom smiled continuously as she ate the snack Taehyung gave her. \\"Seongguk-ah, all the members of 'Just' are so handsome.\\" [Mom, I'm going to tell dad everything!] \\"Seongguk-ah, this is a secret from dad!\\" Mom quickly sealed my mouth with a kiss. [This makes me weak...] \\"Alright, we're starting filming again!\\" The assistant director's voice was heard. Mom held me and headed to the filming site. I stretched my arms, brushed back my hair, and dusted off my onesie. [Let's start filming.] * * * The daytime filming with mom went smoothly for the most part. Mom was somewhere behind the camera, and all I had to do was act freely without being conscious of the camera, and everyone was thrilled, calling me cute. And then came the last night's filming, where I had to spend the night with the 'Just' members. Since mom was pregnant, she decided to sleep at a small hotel nearby with dad. To prepare for any possible incidents, a few members of the production team kept an eye on the rotating cameras throughout the night. Dad, worried even though he had left mom at the hotel, stayed with the filming team and watched the cameras all night. The director also gave me one piece of advice before leaving. \\"Seongguk-ah, just sleep well, eat well, and poop well.\\" [Don't worry, Director. Even if I wanted to, I can't control those things at this age.] The director also sternly warned the members of 'Just'. \\"Seongguk is only 18 months old. You all know that, right?\\" \\"Yes!\\" \\"Really, be careful.\\" \\"Don't worry, Director. I'm here.\\" Michael approached with a confident smile. \\"Alright, I'm counting on you.\\" If there was one person in the world not to trust, it was Michael. Soon, the filming team filmed their departure, leaving only two observation cameras running in the corners. \\"Who wants to prepare Seongguk's dinner?\\" Taehyung asked the members. Then Michael quickly volunteered. \\"I'll do it!\\" \\"You?\\" The members all looked at Michael with puzzled faces. \\"Really, you're going to do it?\\" From Jaehyun's expression alone, it was clear that Michael, this guy, was definitely trying to grab some screen time out of greed."},{"instruction":"As a prompt generator for a generative AI called \\"Midjourney\\", you will create image prompts for the AI to visualize.

[엄마, 나 마이클 때문에 한숨도 못 잤어.] 나는 얼른 마이클을 손가락질하며 옹알거렸다. “성국아, 엄마 많이 보고 싶었어?” [그걸 말이라고 해!] 나는 대성통곡하며 엄마의 품에 안겼다. “으아앙. 엄. 마! 으아앙. 엄. 마!” * * * 21.9% ‘다섯 남자와 아기 바구니’ 파일럿 프로가 주말 최고 시청률을 기록하면서 화제를 일으켰다. 정규 방송으로 편성해 달라는 시청자 의견으로 방송국 전화가 난리가 났다. 학교는 물론 회사나 시장에서도 저스트의 인기 상승과 더불어 세탁기 광고로 얼굴을 알린 나에 대한 이야기들이 넘쳐났다. 엄마를 찾아온 단발머리가 이런 나의 인기에 대해서 설명해주고 있었다. 엄마는 반응이 좋다는 이야기를 ‘다섯 남자와 아기 바구니’ 감독한테 들었을 뿐이다. “107호, 다섯 남자와 아기 바구니 반응 장난 아니에요. 우리 회사에서도 다들 성국이 이야기뿐이에요.” “저스트 이야기가 아니라, 우리 성국이 이야기를 그렇게 해요?” “저스트 이야기도 많이 하죠. 근데 그 관계성 중심에 다 성국이가 있잖아요. 벌써 다들 태형이는 아빠, 재현은 엄마. 마이클은 앙숙. 이렇게 관계를 정해서 말한다니까요. 성국이가 완전 주인공이에요.” 나는 흐뭇한 미소를 지었다. 그러곤 다리에 힘을 팍 넣고 낮은 선반에 손을 댄 채 걸어 다니는 연습을 했다. 정규 방송에 편성되면 첫 녹화에서 나의 걸음마 연습을 자연스럽게 유도하려는 의도였다. 단발머리가 나를 흘깃 쳐다봤다. “성국이는 마치 스타가 되려고 태어난 애 같아요.” [무슨 소리야. 내가 겨우 연예인 나부랭이나 되려고 태어난 줄 알아? 내 목표는 재벌이라고! 이건 재벌이 되기 위한 첫 단추일 뿐이라고. 단발머리.] 나는 두 주먹을 앙 쥐었다! 엄마가 나를 물끄러미 쳐다봤다. “언니, 근데 전 너무 걱정이에요. 아직 두 돌도 안 지난 아이한테는 스케줄이 너무 힘든 것 같아서요. 마지막 밤 촬영 끝나고 아침에 갔는데 성국이가 나 붙잡고 정말 많이 울었거든요.” [그건 마이클 때문에 화가 많이 나서 울은 거야. 분노의 눈물이랄까.] 엄마는 조용히 말을 이었다. “감독님께 정규 편성돼도 성국이가 힘들어해서 안 한다고 하니까요, 감독님이 출연료뿐 아니라 모든 거 다 배려해 준다고 집까지 찾아오셔서 사정사정하셨거든요.” “이 일을 왜 안 해요?” [내 말이!] 단발머리가 더 열을 냈다. “성국이 겨우 돌 지났는데, 이제 곧 둘째도 나오고… 제가 성국이 다 쫓아다닐 수 없을 것 같아서요.” “성국이도 이쪽에 재능 있는 것 같으니까, 107호가 계속 붙잡고 있지 말고 기획사 알아봐요.” “기획사요? 아, 맞다.” 엄마는 선반 위에 둔 명함 하나를 단발머리에게 내밀었다. “언니가 그래도 저보다 잘 아시잖아요. 임선미 씨가 준 명함이거든요. 자기 소속사 추천한다고요. 언니, 이 기획사 아세요?” “신성 기획이네요.” 단발머리의 미간이 구겨졌다. 동시에 내 미간도 구겨졌다. 내가 깜빡한 사실이 하나 있었다. 임선미가 있던 신성 기획은 연예인과 재벌 사이를 연결해줘서 성장한 기획사 중에 하나였다. 그리고 그 신성 기획의 대표 신성중은 내가 싫어하는 인간 종류였다. 가난한 시골 출신으로 로드 매니저로 시작해서 신성 기획의 대표가 된 만큼 일에 수단과 방법을 가리지 않았다. 아버지 전재형은 시골 출신으로 연예계에 자리 잡은 신성중을 나름 높게 평가했지만, 나는 아니었다. 그리고 내 철칙 중 하나는 아버지의 사람과는 어떤 식으로든 엮이지 않겠다는 것이었다. 그들은 아버지를 믿고 종종 나에게 무리한 요구를 하거나 아버지 때처럼 대해줄 것을 원했기 때문이다. 감히 나, 전성국에게! 신성 기획과의 계약은 어떤 식으로든 막아야 했다. [엄마, 계약은 신중해야 한다고….] 나는 얼른 엄마를 향해 걸어갔다. 이때, 엄마가 놀란 눈으로 나를 쳐다봤다. “성국아, 지금 걷는 거야?” [어… 이게….] 분명 지금 나는 아무것도 잡지 않고 걷고 있었다. 물론 다리에 힘이 수시로 빠져서 휘청거렸지만, 분명 나는 어떤 것에도 의지하지 않고 걷고 있었다. “엄. 마!” 나는 다시 걷기 시작했다. 아장아장. “어머, 성국아.” 엄마는 감격스러운 표정으로 두 팔을 벌렸다. 그리고 나는 그 품에 쏙 안겼다. 따뜻한 엄마의 품. 엄마에게서는 깨끗한 비누향이 났다. [아, 이게 진짜 엄마의 품이구나.] 회귀 전 철의 여인에게서는 언제나 짙은 향수 냄새가 났다. 내 최초의 기억을 더듬어 봐도 그녀에게 안긴 건 몇 번 없었다. 나는 언제든 원하면 폭 안길 수 있는 지금의 엄마 품에서 잠시 취했다. 산통을 깬 건 단발머리였다. “107호, 신성 기획이 좀 말이 많은 데긴 하지만 임선미가 추천한 데니 우선 만나봐요. 기획사는 여러 군데 만나보고, 그중에서 가장 좋은 조건을 제시하는 곳이랑 계약해야 해요.” “경리로 일할 땐 계약서도 잘 보고 그랬는데, 너무 집에만 있어나 봐요. 그리고… 서울은 좀 무섭기도 하고요. 언니가 같이 가주시면 안 돼요? 삼전 기획 경리부에서 일하시니 저보다는 훨씬 잘 아실 거잖아요.” 나는 엄마를 다시 봤다. 엄마는 경력자인 단발머리에게 도움을 청하고 있었다. 자신의 부족한 지점을 정확히 알고, 조력자를 곁에 두는 것. 그것이야말로 비즈니스에서 가장 중요한 지점이었다. 단발머리는 잠시 고민하더니 고개를 끄덕였다. “어서 임선미가 준 명함에 나온 데로 전화해봐요. 나도 이 바닥 이야기는 좀 아니 도와줄게요.” “언니, 정말 감사해요.” 나는 얼른 속으로 외쳤다. [그래도, 신성 기획은 절대 안 돼!] 나는 엄마의 옷깃을 잡아당겼지만, 엄마는 알아듣지 못했다. * * * 엄마와 나 그리고 단발머리는 93년도로 치면 최신식으로 꾸며진 신성 기획의 사무실 안에서 계약서를 보고 있었다. 세기말이 다가오고 있어서 그런가. 신성 기획의 사무실은 퇴폐적인 분위기로 가득했다. 우리 앞에는 신성 기획의 아이라인이 두꺼운 직원이 앉아서 눈치를 슬금슬금 살피고 있었다. 나는 곁눈질로 단발머리와 엄마가 보는 계약서를 읽어 내렸다. [계약 기간 10년? 수익 배분율은 5 대 5? 장난하나, 이것들이.] 한마디로 이건 거의 노예 계약이었다. 계약 기간과 수익 배분율 자체가 이해할 수 없었다. 나는 엄마와 단발머리를 번갈아봤다. 이런 일에는 엄마보다 단발머리가 더 나아 보였다. 나는 얼른 단발머리의 계약서를 두 손으로 탁탁 내려쳤다. [여기 좀 보라고!] 특히 기간과 수익 배분율이 있는 곳을 콕 집어서. “성국아, 이러면 안 돼.” 엄마가 나를 얼른 말렸다. 단발머리는 빙긋 미소를 짓더니 내가 손으로 툭툭 내려친 조항들을 다시 세밀히 살폈다. 그러곤 고개를 들어 직원을 쳐다봤다. “이 조항들 그대로 계약해야 하는 건 아니죠?” “왜 그러세요?” 직원의 자신 없는 말투가 들렸다. 저 말투는 이미 계약 조항을 바꿀 수 없다는 뉘앙스였다. [신성 기획은 신인이라면 골수까지 빨아먹는 회사라고! 노예 계약은 사양할게!] 나는 화난 투로 종알거렸다. “계약 기간이랑 수익 배분 같은 것은 좀 조율할 게 보여서요. 그리고 디테일한 사항들도 꽤 많이 조율해야 할 것 같고요.” 직원이 당황하는 게 보였다. “대표님께 한번 여쭤보고 오겠습니다.” “네.” 나는 팔짱을 끼고 단발머리를 쳐다봤다. [어쭈, 단발머리 제법인데.] * * * 달칵. 잠시 후 회의실의 문이 열리면서 신성중이 직접 들어왔다. 나는 팔짱을 끼고 신성중을 찬찬히 훑었다. 기름진 얼굴. 올백으로 넘긴 머리. 화려한 셔츠가 그의 트레이드 마크였다. [신 대표, 오랜만이네요. 머리숱이 아직까지는 참 많네.] 내가 죽기 전, 마지막으로 신성중을 봤을 때는 머리가 훤하게 벗겨져 있었다. 신성중은 두 손을 비비며 맞은편 자리에 앉았다. 저 제스처가 진짜 나는 싫었다. 마치 이제 내가 이야기를 시작할 거고, 난 고귀한 척 같은 건 안 하는 장사치다, 라는 사실을 온몸으로 표현하는 것 같았다. “얘가 성국이군요. 화면도 잘 받던데, 실물로 보니 더 이쁘네요. 될 놈은 떡잎부터 알아본다더니, 이 녀석 두고 하는 말인가 봐요.” [이 녀석이라니. 어디서 하대야, 신 대표.] 신성중의 시선이 엄마에게로 향했다. “사모님도 미인이시네요. 역시 이 바닥은 유전자가 정말 중요하죠.” 그러곤 단발머리를 쳐다봤다. “같이 오신 분은 이모? 고모?” “이웃인데요. 삼전 기획 다니는 김미영이라고 합니다.” 그때 난 처음으로 단발머리의 이름을 알았다. 김미영. “아하.” 신성중은 짧게 인사를 마치고는 본론으로 들어갔다. “그래, 계약서에서 뭐가 마음에 안 든다고 하신 것 같은데요.” “계약 기간이랑 수익 배분이요. 아시다시피 성국이가 완전 신인은 아니잖아요. 그런데 계약 기간 10년에 5 대 5 비율은 아닌 것 같아서요. 이미 성국이 방송 끝나기만을 기다리는 광고도 수두룩하고요.” 김미영이 툭 치고 나갔다. 그리고 쐐기까지 박았다. “같이 일한 감독님들이 다른 기획사도 추천해 주셨는데, 그래도 임선미 씨가 추천한 곳이라 여기 제일 먼저 온 거거든요.” [신성중 같은 인간은 권위에 약하지. 잘했어, 단발머리.] 나는 김미영의 등을 두 번 토닥여줬다. 신성중이 못마땅한 얼굴로 두 손을 파리처럼 비벼댔다. 신성중은 전형적인 강약약강의 인물이었다. 지금 그에게 혹처럼 딸려온 김미영은 그저 귀찮은 존재일 뿐이었다. “그건 잘 알죠. 요즘 광고계에서 성국이가 블루칩 아닙니까. 근데 말입니다….” 신성중은 뜸을 들였다. 자신의 의견을 피력하기에 앞서 상대방의 눈치를 가늠해보는 중이었다. 곧 신성중은 판단을 끝내고 입을 열었다. “베이비 모델 시장이 생각보다 그렇게 넓지 않습니다. 출연료도 성인 연기자에 비하면 턱도 없고요. 거기다 뭐, 대화도 안 통하고 그러다 보니 광고 촬영 시간도 길어지고, 그럼 저희 회사 직원들도 스탠바이 상태로 계속 있어야 하지 않습니까.” [우리를 졸로 봤네.] 신성중은 남루한 차림의 임신한 엄마와 어린 나, 그리고 삼전 기획의 경리부에서 일하는 단발머리를 보고는 한눈에 깔아뭉갤 상대로 본 게 분명했다. 나는 삐딱하게 팔짱을 끼고 신성중의 말을 들었다. 내 대답은 정해져 있었지만, 대체 어떻게 말을 둘러치나 듣고 있었다. “그리고 애 얼굴은 1년에 열두 번도 더 변하지 않습니까. 성국이 지금 이쁘지만, 한 달 후에는 또 다른 얼굴이 나타나고. 솔직히 잠깐의 인기 후에 얼굴 변해서 광고 제의도 줄고. 그런데도 저희의 고정 지출은 있지 않겠습니까.” “한마디로, 계약 조건 바꾸는 것은 불가능하다, 그 말씀이죠?” 김미영이 끼어들었다. 내 속이 다 시원했다. 신성중이 손바닥을 다 보이며 허허 웃음을 터트렸다. “저희 회사 입장을 말씀드리는 거죠. 선미 부탁도 있고, 저도 성국이 같은 스타감이랑 꼭 계약하고 싶어서 이렇게 연락드렸습니다.” 어떻게든 자신에게 유리한 계약을 하려는 수작이었다. 더 들을 말 따위는 없었다. 나는 자리에서 벌떡 일어났다. 엄마가 나를 얼른 안으려고 했지만, 나는 휘청거리며 문을 향해 걸어갔다. 나의 결연한 의지와 상관없이 엉덩이는 뒤뚱거렸다. “성국아!” 안 나오고 뭐 해. 엄마! 단발머리도 자리를 박차고 일어났다. 그러곤 신성중을 쳐다봤다. “저희는 제시하신 조건으로는 계약하기 힘들 것 같습니다. 생각해 보시고 관심 있으시면 계약 조건 조율하셔서 다시 연락 주시죠.” [단발머리, 나이스!]","output":"Episode 11 \\"Alright, let's trust Michael today.\\" When the eldest member of the group, Taehyung, defended Michael, the other members reluctantly went to prepare for bed. I stealthily crawled to the kitchen. I could walk by holding onto the walls, but crawling was still more comfortable when moving quickly. At that moment, Beomseon caught me with one arm. \\"Sungguk, the kitchen is dangerous.\\" [I have to watch what that guy is going to mess with the food. Do you guys trust Michael?] As I babbled, Beomseon carried me into the kitchen. \\"Michael, what's for Sungguk's dinner?\\" \\"Uh... Baby food. The porridge-like thing that Sungguk's mother made during the day.\\" \\"But what's that behind you?\\" As Beomseon tried to see behind Michael, Michael quickly hid something behind his back. \\"What do you mean there's something behind me?\\" Michael snapped back. It was proof that he was caught. \\"Hey, show me what you're trying to prank with!\\" At Beomseon's voice, all the members rushed over. \\"Michael, what are you hiding behind? Show us.\\" At Taehyung's words, Michael suddenly smiled brightly and presented hot sauce. \\"Guys, I was going to add it to the baby food for fun. But, I haven't added it yet.\\" [You little! You dare to sprinkle hot sauce on my sacred meal!] As I squirmed, Beomseon held me tighter. Taehyung's face turned grim. Then he gritted his teeth and whispered to Michael. \\"This time, I'll let it slide. Just try playing pranks like this again.\\" Taehyung quickly snatched the hot sauce. That night, Michael kept picking on me. He threw ping pong balls at me, who was just sitting still, and when I started to feel sleepy, he blew a squeaky toy horn next to me. I was so startled that I cried my eyes out. Thanks to the other members who defended me like an iron wall, I was able to safely get through the night. It was the first night without mom. As soon as the door opened, I saw mom's silhouette. I crawled towards mom with all my strength, holding onto the walls. \\"Mom. Mom!\\" Then I clung to mom's skirt, crying and sniffling. [Mom, I couldn't sleep at all because of Michael.] I quickly pointed at Michael and babbled. \\"Sungguk, did you miss mom a lot?\\" [Is that even a question!] I cried loudly and hugged mom. \\"Mom! Mom!\\" * * * 21.9% The pilot episode of 'Five Men and a Baby Basket' recorded the highest weekend viewership, causing a sensation. The broadcasting station was flooded with calls from viewers requesting it to be scheduled for regular broadcasting. At school, in companies, and in the market, there was a lot of talk about the rising popularity of Just and me, who became known through a washing machine advertisement. A woman with short hair came to explain to mom about my popularity. Mom had only heard from the director of 'Five Men and a Baby Basket' that the response was good. \\"Room 107, the response to 'Five Men and a Baby Basket' is no joke. Everyone at our company is only talking about Sungguk.\\" \\"Are they talking about Just, not just our Sungguk?\\" \\"They talk a lot about Just too. But they specifically talk about Sungguk being at the center of their relationship. Everyone already labels Taehyung as the dad, Jaehyun as the mom, and Michael as the nemesis. Sungguk is totally the main character.\\" I smiled contentedly. Then, I put strength into my legs and practiced walking by touching a low shelf. It was intended to naturally induce my walking practice during the first recording if it was scheduled for regular broadcasting. The woman with short hair glanced at me. \\"Sungguk seems like he was born to be a star.\\" [What are you talking about? Do you think I was born to be some entertainer? My goal is to be a conglomerate! This is just the first step towards becoming a conglomerate, short hair.] I clenched my fists! Mom looked at me thoughtfully. \\"But I'm really worried. It seems too hard for a child not even two years old to have such a schedule. After the last night of shooting, I went in the morning, and Sungguk clung to me and cried a lot.\\" [That was because I was so angry at Michael. Tears of rage.] Mom continued quietly. \\"The director said if it gets regularly scheduled, they'll take care of everything, not just the appearance fee, and even came to our house to plead.\\" \\"Why wouldn't you do it?\\" [Exactly!] Short hair became more passionate. \\"Sungguk is barely over a year old, and soon the second child will be born... I don't think I can follow Sungguk around.\\" \\"Sungguk seems to have talent in this field, so don't just hold onto him in room 107, look for an agency.\\" \\"An agency? Oh, right.\\" Mom handed a business card to short hair. \\"You know better than me, sister. It's from Lim Sunmi. She recommended her agency. Sister, do you know this agency?\\" \\"Shinseong Planning.\\" Short hair frowned. At the same time, I frowned too. I had forgotten one thing. Shinseong Planning, where Lim Sunmi was, was one of the agencies that grew by connecting entertainers and conglomerates. And Shinseong Planning's representative, Shin Sungjung, was the type of person I disliked. Starting as a road manager from a poor rural background and becoming the representative of Shinseong Planning, he was ruthless in his work. My father, Jeon Jaehyung, respected Shin Sungjung for making a place in the entertainment industry from a rural background, but I did not. And one of my principles was not to get involved with my father's people in any way. They trusted my father and often made unreasonable demands or wanted to be treated like they were by my father. How dare they, to me, Jeon Sungguk! I had to block the contract with Shinseong Planning in any way. [Mom, contracts need to be careful...] I quickly walked towards mom. At that moment, mom looked at me with surprised eyes. \\"Sungguk, are you walking now?\\" [Uh... this is...] Sure enough, I was walking without holding onto anything. Of course, my legs were wobbly and I staggered, but I was definitely walking without leaning on anything. \\"Mom!\\" I started walking again. Step by step. \\"Oh my, Sungguk.\\" Mom opened her arms with a moved expression. And I snugly fit into her embrace. The warm embrace of mom. From mom, a clean scent of soap wafted. [Ah, this is really the embrace of mom.] Before my regression, the iron lady always smelled strongly of perfume. Even when I tried to recall my earliest memories, I was rarely hugged by her. I indulged for a moment in the embrace of my current mom, where I could hug her anytime I wanted. Short hair broke the silence. \\"Room 107, although Shinseong Planning has a lot of talk, since Lim Sunmi recommended it, let's meet them first. You should meet several agencies and contract with the one that offers the best conditions.\\" \\"I used to check contracts well when I worked in accounting, but maybe I've been staying at home too much. And... Seoul is a bit scary. Can you come with me, sister? Since you work in the accounting department of Samjeon Planning, you must know much better than me.\\" I looked at mom again. Mom was asking for help from short hair, who was an experienced person. Knowing exactly where she lacked and keeping a helper by her side. That was the most important point in business. Short hair hesitated for a moment, then nodded. \\"Call the number on the business card Lim Sunmi gave you. I know a bit about this industry, so I'll help.\\" \\"Thank you so much, sister.\\" I shouted inwardly. [But still, Shinseong Planning is absolutely not!] I tugged at mom's clothes, but mom didn't understand. * * * Mom, me, and short hair were looking at the contract in the office of Shinseong Planning, which was decorated in the latest style for 1993. As the end of the century approached, Shinseong Planning's office was filled with a decadent atmosphere. In front of us sat an employee of Shinseong Planning with thick eyeliner, sneakily glancing at us. I skimmed the contract that mom and short hair were looking at with a side glance. [Contract period 10 years? Revenue distribution ratio 5 to 5? Are they joking, these people?] In a word, this was almost a slave contract. The contract period and revenue distribution ratio itself were incomprehensible. I looked back and forth between mom and short hair. In this matter, short hair seemed better than mom. I quickly slapped the contract that short hair was looking at with both hands. [Look here!] Especially pointing out the parts about the period and revenue distribution ratio. \\"Sungguk, you shouldn't do this.\\" Mom quickly stopped me. Short hair smiled slightly, then looked closely again at the clauses I had tapped. Then she looked up at the employee. \\"These clauses aren't set in stone, right?\\" \\"Why do you say that?\\" The employee's uncertain tone was heard. That tone already implied that changing the contract clauses was impossible. [Shinseong Planning is a company that sucks the marrow out of newcomers! A slave contract is declined!] I babbled angrily. \\"The contract period and revenue distribution, you know. Considering Sungguk is not a complete newcomer. But a 10-year contract with a 5 to 5 ratio doesn't seem right. There are already countless advertisements waiting just for Sungguk's broadcast to end.\\" Short hair cut in. And she drove the final nail. \\"Directors who worked with us recommended other agencies, but we came here first because Lim Sunmi recommended this place.\\" [People like Shin Sungjung are weak to authority. Well done, short hair.] I patted short hair's back twice. Shin Sungjung rubbed his hands together with a displeased face. Shin Sungjung was a typical strong-against-the-weak, weak-against-the-strong character. To him, short hair, who had tagged along, was just an annoying existence. \\"Of course, I know. These days, Sungguk is a blue chip in the advertising world. But, you see...\\" Shin Sungjung hesitated. He was gauging the other party's reaction before presenting his opinion. Soon, Shin Sungjung made his judgment and opened his mouth. \\"The baby model market is not as wide as you think. The appearance fee is nothing compared to adult actors. Plus, you know, communication doesn't work, and so the advertising shooting time gets longer, and then our company employees have to stay on standby, right?\\" [They're looking down on us.] Shin Sungjung saw the shabbily dressed pregnant mom, young me, and short hair, who worked in the accounting department of Samjeon Planning, and immediately judged us as easy targets to crush. I crossed my arms and listened to Shin Sungjung's words. My answer was already decided, but I was curious how he would beat around the bush. \\"And the baby's face changes maybe twelve times a year, right? Sungguk is pretty now, but a month later, a different face appears. Honestly, after a brief popularity, the face changes, and the advertising offers decrease. But our fixed expenses are still there, right?\\" \\"In other words, it's impossible to change the contract conditions, is that what you're saying?\\" Short hair intervened. I felt utterly refreshed. Shin Sungjung showed his palms and burst into laughter. \\"I'm just explaining our company's position. Sunmi also asked for a favor, and I really wanted to sign a contract with a star material like Sungguk, so I contacted you.\\" He was trying to secure a contract advantageous to him by any means. There was no need to listen further. I stood up abruptly. Mom tried to hold me quickly, but I staggered towards the door. Regardless of my determined will, my buttocks wobbled. \\"Sungguk!\\" What are you doing, not coming out. Mom! Short hair also stood up with a kick and looked at Shin Sungjung. \\"It seems difficult for us to sign with the conditions you've offered. Think it over and if you're still interested, contact us again after adjusting the contract conditions.\\" [Short hair, nice!]"},{"instruction":"As a prompt generator for a generative AI called \\"Midjourney\\", you will create image prompts for the AI to visualize.

[경쟁자 녀석….] 옆자리에 앉아 있던 김미영을 엄마는 물끄러미 봤다. 신성 기획을 나온 이후로 단발머리는 단 한 마디도 하지 않았다. 엄마는 김미영의 눈치를 슬쩍 살폈다. “언니, 저한테 무슨 할 말 있죠?” “있긴 한데….” 김미영은 말을 아꼈다. 그때, 엄마가 먼저 김미영의 손을 훅 잡았다. “언니, 혹시 우리 성국이 매니저 안 해볼래요?” 안 그래도 나도 그 생각을 막 했다. 삼전 기획에서 경리부지만 과장까지 단 여자이다. 거기다 최후의 고졸 사원이다. 그 정도의 끈기라면 내 매니저로 합격점이었다. 나는 칭찬의 의미로 엄마의 배를 두 번 도닥였다. 토닥토닥. 나는 얼른 김미영을 봤다. [단발머리, 내가 거절할 수 없는 제안을 할 거야.] 그 순간, 엄마가 내 배를 도닥였다. “성국아, 잠시만 조용히 해줘.” [쳇. 어쩔 수 없지.] 나는 입은 닫고, 팔짱은 끼고 김미영을 매섭게 쳐다봤다. 김미영은 나와 엄마를 번갈아 보더니 천천히 입을 열었다. “안 그래도, 내가 그 말 먼저 하려고 했는데. 107호한테 선수 빼앗겼네요.” [김미영, 지금 뭐라고 한 거야? 진짜 한다는 거지?] 나도 놀랐고, 엄마도 놀랐다. “언니도 생각한 일이에요?” 끄덕. 김미영은 고개를 짧게 끄덕였다. “근데… 언니 회사는 어쩔 생각이세요?” “그만 다니려고요. 30대 후반의 노처녀, 회사에서 반가워하지도 않거든요. 모아둔 돈으로 창업 준비 하려고 했는데… 성국이 매니지먼트를 내가 해보면 어떨까 잠시 상상은 해봤어요.” 단발머리는 차분하게 말을 이었다. “계약 조건이야 당연히 신성 기획보다 좋을 거고, 내가 그동안 경리부에서 일한 경력 있으니 돈 문제는 깔끔하게 처리할 거예요. 삼전 기획에서 매니저들이 일하는 방식이나 관리하는 거 많이 봤어요.” 김미영은 이미 계약 조건부터 자신의 어필까지 모든 것을 다 생각하고 있었다. [단발머리, 다 계획이 있었구나.] 나는 엄마의 원피스 자락을 세차게 잡아당겼다. 단발머리 정도면 내가 재벌이 되는 데 좋은 발판이 되어줄 인재였다. [엄마, 계약서 쓰자고 해!] 마치 엄마는 내 말을 알아들은 것처럼 결심한 듯 고개를 끄덕였다. “언니, 솔직하게 이야기할게요.” “편하게 말해요. 거절도 괜찮아요.” 김미영의 목소리는 여전히 담담했다. “언니, 성국이 아직 어리고, 저희 가난하지만 성국이 힘든 모습 보면서까지 연예인 시키고 싶지 않거든요. 제가 예정일이 얼마 안 남아 알아본 건데요. 이번 일만 하고 성국이 더는 안 할 수도 있어요.” “그럼 더 잘됐네요. 저런 회사는 묶이면 기본 10년이잖아요. 나는 성국이가 일 그만두면 그때 계약 해지하는 걸로 해요.” “언니….” “나도 새로운 일을 시작해보고 싶어서 그런 거니까, 나한테 고마워할 것도 미안해할 것도 없어요. 물론 나도 일한 만큼 보수는 받을 거고요.” 이보다 더 좋은 조건은 없어 보였다. 나는 다시 엄마의 옷을 잡아당겼다. [어서 같이 일하자고 해, 엄마.] “언니…. 염치없지만, 성국이 매니저로 저 좀 도와주실래요?” “당연하죠.” 단발머리는 확신에 차서 대답했다. 나는 배에 두 팔을 올린 채 단발머리를 물끄러미 쳐다봤다. [김미영 씨, 앞으로 내가 지켜볼 테니 잘해야 해.] “열심히도 종알거리네. 앞으로 잘 부탁해, 성국아.” 김미영이 단호하게 말했다. 우리 엄마와 아빠는 비록 고아로 태어나 외롭게 자라고 공부도 제대로 못 했지만, 대신 하늘에서 인복이라는 것을 내린 게 분명하다. 똑 부러지는 집주인을 만나고, 거기다 나 같은 준비된 재벌을 만나다니…. 나는 엄마를 꼭 안았다. 엄마의 부른 배 때문에 거슬리긴 했지만, 이 배 속에 들어 있는 동생이란 놈도 천운을 타고 태어난 건 마찬가지이다. 왜냐하면 나 전성국이 이 집안을 일으켜 세울 것이기 때문이다. 나는 엄마의 배를 통통 쳤다. [동생, 넌 적어도 14K 금수저 예약이야.] * * * “다섯 남자와 아기 바구니가 저번 주에 시청률 25%를 넘겼습니다! 오늘 끝나고 회사에서 회식 준비했으니 다들 참여해 주세요.” ‘저스트’의 매니저가 크게 소리쳤다. 다섯 남자와 아기 바구니의 인기 덕분에 수많은 신인 그룹 중 하나였던 ‘저스트’의 인기도 덩달아 급상승했다. “자, 회사에서 산다니 다들 참석하고. 촬영 들어가자고!” 감독의 한마디에 다시 주변은 조용해졌다. 엄마 역할을 맡은 꽃미남 재현이 나를 안아 올렸다. 이때, 부엌에서 마이클이 바나나를 입에 물고 나오자 재현이 기겁했다. “마이클, 그거 성국이 거야. 그걸 네가 먹으면 어떡해!” “나는 입도 아니야? 배고파 죽겠어.” “아우, 진짜. 넌 언제 철들래?” 재현은 마이클을 타박했지만, 마이클은 나를 보며 혀를 날름 내밀며 메롱을 했다. 나는 또 거기에 맞춰서 마이클을 한 대 칠 기세로 손발을 바동거렸다. 내가 설정한 ‘저스트’ 다섯 멤버와의 관계성에서 의외로 마이클과의 앙숙 관계가 엄청난 사랑을 받았다. 첫 밤 촬영 때, 마이클이 내 이유식에 핫소스를 뿌리려던 모습이나 밤새 나를 괴롭힌 모습이 마치 아직 덜 자란 어른 같은 천진난만함으로 편집됐다. 거기다 자막까지 ‘철없는 막내는 새로 생긴 동생이 부럽나 봅니다.’ 이렇게 박는 바람에 졸지에 마이클은 마치 막둥이에게 사랑을 다 빼앗겨버린 형이 되었다. 정말 악마의 편집이었다. 각종 게시판에서는 나와 마이클의 관계를 톰과 제리에 비유하기도 했다. 이제 마이클은 아예 어린아이와 같은 유딩의 면모를 더욱 부각했다. 사람들은 나와 마이클을 엮어 ‘유딩즈’라고 부르기도 했다. 이제 아빠 역할의 태형이 나서서 이 상황을 정리하면 오늘의 한 에피소드는 마무리다. “마이클 그만! 재현, 성국이 얼굴 안 좋네. 기저귀 한번 봐.” “어, 형.” [뭐야, 또 아랫도리 까야 하나.] 아무리 모자이크 처리해서 나간다지만, 태형의 에피소드 정리 방식은 언제나 기저귀 갈기 아니면 우유 먹이기 같은 원초적인 것이었다. 재현이 얼른 바지를 벗겼다. 곧 아랫도리가 시원해졌다. “성국이 아직 오줌 안 쌌는데.” 카메라가 불쑥 들어와 나를 찍어댔다. [그렇다면 제대로 오줌 한번 날려줄까?] 나는 있는 힘껏 인상을 쓰고는, 그대로 카메라를 향해 오줌을 뿜었다. [준비하시고… 발사!] “컷!” 감독의 목소리가 들리자마자 스태프들이 웃음을 터트렸다. 감독도 흥분에 들뜬 목소리였다. “오늘 완전 대박이야. 어쩜 때맞춰 오줌도 싸주냐. 우리 성국이 진짜 천재 아니야? 이번 편 시청률 또 오르겠는데. 이러다 우리 30프로도 넘는 거 아니야? 자, 30분만 쉬고 다시 촬영 들어가겠습니다.” 감독의 칭찬이 이어졌다. 촬영 스태프들도 모두들 극찬을 아끼지 않았다. [이런 관심과 환호. 저번 생과 별반 다를 게 없군.] 나는 모두의 관심을 온몸에 받았다. 엄마가 얼른 다가와 바지를 입히고, 내 손에 바나나를 쥐여줬다. 나는 물컹한 바나나를 앞니로 아작아작 씹었다. “성국아, 안 힘들어?” [엄마, 원래 돈 버는 건 힘든 거야. 이 정도야 뭐. 삼전 그룹 부회장으로 있을 때는 정말 스트레스 때문에 원형 탈모도 왔었다고.] 엄마는 내 엉덩이를 도닥이더니 옆에 선 스태프에게 나를 부탁했다. “쓰레기 좀 버리고 올게요. 성국이 좀 봐주세요.” “네, 걱정 말고 다녀오세요.” 나는 뽀송뽀송한 기저귀를 차고는 잠시 몸을 뒤척였다. [이번 기저귀는 쓸 만하네. 역시 돈이 좋아.] 한동안 몸에 맞지 않는 기저귀 때문에 피부가 쓸려서 꽤 고생을 했었다. 그 이후로 좀 더 비싼 기저귀로 바뀌고 나서 발진도 더는 일지 않았다. 이때, 마이클이 가까이 오더니 나를 슬쩍 건드렸다. “자식, 너 아까 진짜 발로 나 한 대 치려고 했지?” [지금 이 녀석이 나랑 해보자는 건가.] 마이클 이 자식은 얄밉게 생겨서는 인성은 더 쓰레기였다. 나는 고개를 휙 돌려버렸다. 이런 건 안 보는 게 인성에 도움이 된다. “야, 너 지금 나 무시해?” [가지가지 백만 가지 하네, 진짜.] “너, 뭐라고 종알거리는 거야! 내 말이 말 같지 않아?” 나는 두 손으로 귀를 틀어막아 버렸다. [안 들려. 안 들려.] 약 올라 하는 마이클의 얼굴이 보였다. 순간, 허리가 따끔했다. 마이클이 손가락으로 내 허리 살을 꼬집고 있었다. [지금 감히 이 전성국을 꼬집은 거냐? 어?!] 나는 얼른 전투 자세를 취했다. 이런 자식은 철저히 짓밟아줘야 기어오르지 않았다. 나는 주먹을 콩 쥐고 마이클을 노려봤다. 마이클은 혀를 날름날름해 댔다. “어쭈, 때리려고? 어디 때려봐. 어서.” [어휴, 이 자식을.] 이때, 김미영이 다가왔다. “무슨 일이세요?” 김미영이 되묻자 마이클은 어색하게 미소를 지었다. “아, 아무것도 아니에요.” 아무것도 아니긴. 네가 지금 나 꼬집었잖아! 나는 옹알거렸다. “성국이는 아무것도 아닌 일에 화를 내지 않는 아이거든요.” 옳은 말씀. 마이클이 잠시 기가 차단 얼굴로 김미영을 쳐다봤다. “애가 뭘 안다고요. 그냥 밥 먹고, 자고, 싸는 게 애잖아요.” “그런 애가 무명인 당신들 얼굴 알려주고, 각종 광고까지 하게 해줬는데. 그럼 마이클 님은 그런 애보다 못한 거 아닌가요?” 마이클은 말문이 막혔다. 나는 김미영의 듬직한 어깨를 올려다봤다. “뭐래.” 마이클은 씩씩거리며 영어로 몇 마디 중얼거리곤 자리를 떴다. 분명 나나 김미영이 못 알아들을 것이라고 판단해서 내뱉은 영어였다. 통역하자면, 애나 매니저나 둘 다 재수 없네. 뭐, 이런 말이었다. 나는 툴툴 걸어가는 마이클의 뒤통수를 쳐다봤다. [마이클, 너는 내가 꼭 기억한다. 앞으로 조심해라.] 김미영이 씩씩거리는 내 손을 잡았다. “성국아, 화내지 마. 세상엔 화낼 가치가 없는 사람도 있어. 그런 사람은 철저하게 무시를 해주면 되는 거야.” [어라?] 그 순간, 나는 김미영을 다시 봤다. 김미영은 마이클이 어떤 인간인지 한눈에 꿰뚫고 있었다. 그래, 철저한 무시. 그동안 나는 마이클이 날 놀리면 약이 올라 바동거렸다. 그 덕분에 나와 마이클의 관계는 앙숙이 되어서 프로그램의 메인이 됐다. 앞으로 내가 마이클을 무시하거나 반응해주지 않으면 그는 카메라에서 자연스레 멀어질 게 뻔했다. [애가 되더니, 내가 그동안 너무 감정적이었군.] 나는 통통한 팔을 최대한 끌어당겨 턱을 매만졌다. 쓰레기를 버리고 온 엄마가 나를 안아 들었다. “마이클 씨가 봐주기로 했는데, 어디 가셨어요?” “성국이 엄마, 앞으로 마이클한테는 안 맡기는 게 좋을 것 같아요.” “왜요? 성국이한테 무슨 해코지라도 했나요?” 엄마는 놀란 얼굴로 나를 꼭 안았다. “마이클 씨도 아직 애잖아요.” 김미영은 융통성 있게 말도 돌렸다. 엄마에게 걱정을 끼치지 않고 싶어 하는 게 보였다. 나는 엄마의 옷깃을 꼭 쥐었다. [엄마, 걱정 마. 마이클은 내가 나중에 제대로 손봐줄 거니까.] 이때, ‘저스트’ 숙소의 전등이 일제히 꺼졌다. 뭐지? 어둠에 눈이 익숙해지는 동안, 한동안 눈앞은 칠흑처럼 어두웠다. 엄마는 나를 꼭 안고는 속삭였다. “성국아, 괜찮아. 엄마가 있어.” 나는 그런 엄마 품에 파고들었다. 걱정 따위 되지 않았다. 엄마가 있으니까. 곧 플래시를 든 범선이 다가왔다. “성국이 괜찮죠?” “네, 괜찮아요.” “저 따라오세요. 저희 숙소가 반지하라 플래시 준비해 뒀거든요.” 평소에 무뚝뚝한 범선은 사실 프로그램 시작 후에 그렇게 주목받지 못했다. 하지만 촬영장에 있으면 범선이 언제나 묵묵히 뒤에서 모든 일을 도맡아 한다는 것쯤은 알았다. “계단 조심하세요.” 범선은 일일이 계단을 플래시로 비추었다. “정전이 자주 있나 봐요?” 김미영이 물었다. “자주는 아닌데. 이 근처가 워낙 공사를 많이 하거든요. 종종 전선 건드려서 정전이 일어나긴 해요.” 범선의 도움으로 우리는 무사히 반지하 저스트 숙소를 빠져나왔다. 스태프가 다급한 얼굴로 다가왔다. “어쩌죠? 한전에 연락했더니 복구하는 데 몇 시간 걸린다네요. 아무래도 오늘은 촬영 접어야 할 것 같아요.” “어쩔 수 없죠. 그럼 저희는 성국이랑 집에 갈게요.” “네, 오늘은 우선 푹 쉬시고 내일 오전에 일정 나오는 대로 연락드릴게요.” 스태프는 꾸벅 인사를 하고 사라졌다. 엄마는 걱정스러운 얼굴로 범선을 쳐다봤다. “범선 씨랑 멤버들은 어쩌실 거예요?” “저희야 플래시도 있고, 초도 있어요. 걱정 마세요.” 범선은 배시시 웃었다. 엄마와 김미영 모두 그 모습을 넋 놓고 바라봤다. 역시 범선은 여자들에게 인기 있을 만한 놈이었다.","output":"Episode 12 Inside the taxi on the way home, the radio was broadcasting traffic information. It seemed like there was quite a bit of congestion. My mom briefly loosened the baby carrier and placed my hand on her swollen belly. \\"Seong-guk, your sibling is playing inside mom's belly right now.\\" I could really feel something poking up against the belly. At Samjeon Group, the birth of a sibling was not a joyous occasion. It meant the birth of a competitor. Just looking at my father's siblings, it was often the case that their relationship was worse than that of strangers. I coldly removed my hand from my mom's belly. [Competitor, huh...] Mom gazed at Kim Mi-young, who was sitting next to us. Since leaving Shinseong Planning, the woman with the bob cut hadn't said a single word. Mom sneakily glanced at Kim Mi-young. \\"Do you have something to say to me?\\" \\"There is, but...\\" Kim Mi-young held back her words. Then, mom suddenly grabbed Kim Mi-young's hand. \\"Sister, would you like to try being Seong-guk's manager?\\" I had just been thinking about it too. She was a woman who had made it to the position of chief in the accounting department at Samjeon Planning, and she was also the last high school graduate employee there. With that kind of perseverance, she passed as my manager. I patted my mom's belly twice as a sign of approval. Pat, pat. I quickly looked at Kim Mi-young. [Bob cut, I'm going to make you an offer you can't refuse.] At that moment, mom patted my belly. \\"Seong-guk, be quiet for a moment.\\" [Che. Can't be helped.] I closed my mouth, crossed my arms, and glared fiercely at Kim Mi-young. Kim Mi-young, after looking back and forth between me and my mom, slowly opened her mouth. \\"I was actually going to say that first. Room 107 beat me to it.\\" [Kim Mi-young, what did you just say? You're really going to do it?] Both I and my mom were surprised. \\"Sister, were you thinking about it too?\\" Nod. Kim Mi-young nodded briefly. \\"But... what about your company?\\" \\"I'm planning to quit. Being an unmarried woman in her late thirties, the company doesn't welcome me anyway. I was going to prepare for starting my own business with the money I've saved... but I briefly imagined managing Seong-guk.\\" The woman with the bob cut continued calmly. \\"Of course, the contract conditions will be better than Shinseong Planning, and since I have experience working in the accounting department, I'll handle the money matters cleanly. I've seen a lot about how managers work and manage things at Samjeon Planning.\\" Kim Mi-young had already thought about everything from the contract conditions to her appeal. [Bob cut, you had a plan all along.] I fiercely grabbed the hem of my mom's dress. A person like bob cut would be a great stepping stone for me to become a conglomerate. [Mom, let's write the contract!] As if mom understood what I was saying, she nodded with determination. \\"Sister, I'll speak frankly.\\" \\"Feel free to speak. It's okay to refuse.\\" Kim Mi-young's voice was still calm. \\"Sister, Seong-guk is still young, and although we're poor, I don't want to make him a celebrity if it means seeing him struggle. I've looked into it since the due date is not far off. He might not continue after this job.\\" \\"Then it's even better. If he gets tied to such a company, it's a minimum of 10 years. If Seong-guk decides to quit, we'll terminate the contract then.\\" \\"Sister...\\" \\"Since I also want to start something new, you don't have to thank or feel sorry for me. Of course, I'll receive compensation for my work.\\" It seemed like there couldn't be a better condition. I tugged at my mom's clothes again. [Let's work together, mom.] \\"Sister... I know it's shameless, but could you please help me by being Seong-guk's manager?\\" \\"Of course.\\" Bob cut answered with confidence. I rested my arms on my belly and gazed intently at Kim Mi-young. [Kim Mi-young, I'll be watching, so you better do well.] \\"You're quite the chatterbox. I look forward to working with you, Seong-guk.\\" Kim Mi-young spoke firmly. Our mom and dad, although born orphans and grew up lonely without proper education, were surely blessed with human connections from heaven. To meet a sharp landlord and then a prepared conglomerate like me... I hugged my mom tightly. Although my mom's swollen belly was in the way, the sibling inside was also born under a lucky star. Because I, Jeon Seong-guk, will raise this family. I patted my mom's belly. [Sibling, you're at least reserved for a 14K gold spoon.] * * * \\"The Five Men and a Baby Basket surpassed 25% viewership last week! We've prepared a company dinner after today's shoot, so please attend.\\" The manager of 'Just' shouted loudly. Thanks to the popularity of The Five Men and a Baby Basket, 'Just,' one of the many rookie groups, also saw a rapid rise in popularity. \\"Alright, everyone attend since the company is paying. Let's start shooting!\\" With the director's word, the surroundings quieted down again. The handsome man playing the mom role, Jae-hyun, picked me up. Then, Michael came out of the kitchen with a banana in his mouth, causing Jae-hyun to panic. \\"Michael, that's Seong-guk's. What if you eat it!\\" \\"I have a mouth too, don't I? I'm starving to death.\\" \\"Ah, really. When will you grow up?\\" Jae-hyun scolded Michael, but Michael stuck out his tongue at me, making a face. I responded by flailing my arms and legs as if I was about to hit him. Unexpectedly, the antagonistic relationship between Michael and me received immense love in the dynamics of the 'Just' five members. During the first night of shooting, the scene where Michael tried to sprinkle hot sauce on my baby food or tormented me all night was edited to show his innocent, childlike charm. Moreover, the caption 'The youngest who hasn't grown up seems jealous of the new sibling.' turned Michael into a brother who seemed to have all his love stolen by the youngest. It was truly devilish editing. Various forums compared mine and Michael's relationship to Tom and Jerry. Now, Michael fully embraced his childish side. People even started calling Michael and me 'The Kiddos.' Now, it was time for Taehyung, playing the dad role, to step in and wrap up today's episode. \\"Michael, stop! Jae-hyun, Seong-guk's face doesn't look good. Check his diaper.\\" \\"Oh, brother.\\" [What, do I have to expose my bottom again?] Even though it was blurred out, Taehyung's way of wrapping up episodes was always either changing diapers or feeding milk, something very primal. Jae-hyun quickly took off my pants. Soon, my lower half felt cool. \\"Seong-guk hasn't peed yet.\\" The camera suddenly zoomed in on me. [Should I give them a proper pee show then?] I grimaced with all my might and aimed at the camera. [Ready... Fire!] \\"Cut!\\" As soon as the director's voice was heard, the staff burst into laughter. The director's voice was excited. \\"Today's a total hit. How did you time your pee so perfectly? Isn't our Seong-guk a genius? This episode's ratings will surely rise. We might even surpass 30%. Alright, let's take a 30-minute break and then resume shooting.\\" The director continued to praise me. The shooting staff also spared no compliments. [This attention and cheers. Not much different from my previous life.] I basked in everyone's attention. Mom quickly came over, dressed me, and handed me a banana. I chewed on the soft banana with my front teeth. \\"Seong-guk, are you not tired?\\" [Mom, making money is always hard. This is nothing. When I was the vice chairman of Samjeon Group, I was so stressed I even got alopecia areata.] Mom patted my bottom and then asked a staff member to watch me. \\"I'll throw away the trash. Please watch Seong-guk.\\" \\"Sure, don't worry and go.\\" I sat comfortably in a freshly changed diaper. [This diaper is decent. Money is indeed good.] I had suffered quite a bit from wearing ill-fitting diapers, causing skin abrasions. After switching to more expensive diapers, the rash stopped occurring. Then, Michael approached and poked me lightly. \\"Kid, you were really about to hit me with your foot earlier, weren't you?\\" [Is this guy challenging me?] Michael, despite his annoying appearance, had an even worse personality. I turned my head away sharply. Ignoring such things is beneficial for one's character. \\"Hey, are you ignoring me now?\\" [Really, he's making a big deal out of everything.] \\"What are you mumbling about! Do my words sound like nonsense to you?\\" I covered my ears with both hands. [I can't hear you. I can't hear you.] Michael's face showed he was getting a rise out of it. Suddenly, my waist stung. Michael was pinching the flesh on my waist with his fingers. [Did you just dare pinch Jeon Seong-guk? Huh?!] I quickly assumed a battle stance. Such a guy needed to be thoroughly trampled so he wouldn't dare to rise again. I clenched my fist and glared at Michael. Michael flicked his tongue teasingly. \\"Oh, trying to hit me? Go ahead, try.\\" [Oh, this guy.] Just then, Kim Mi-young approached. \\"What's going on?\\" As Kim Mi-young asked, Michael awkwardly smiled. \\"Oh, it's nothing.\\" Nothing? You just pinched me! I babbled in protest. \\"Seong-guk is a child who doesn't get angry over trivial matters.\\" Right on. Michael looked at Kim Mi-young with a stunned expression for a moment. \\"A child knows what? They just eat, sleep, and poop.\\" \\"Yet, that child made you unknowns famous and even got you various commercials. So, doesn't that make you, Mr. Michael, worse than such a child?\\" Michael was at a loss for words. I looked up at Kim Mi-young's reliable shoulder. \\"What are you saying.\\" Michael grumbled and left, muttering a few words in English, probably thinking Kim Mi-young and I wouldn't understand. Translated, it was something like, \\"Both the kid and the manager are annoying.\\" I watched Michael's retreating back. [Michael, I'll remember this. Be careful.] Kim Mi-young held my hand, which was still fuming. \\"Seong-guk, don't be angry. There are people in the world not worth your anger. Such people should be thoroughly ignored.\\" [Oh?] At that moment, I looked at Kim Mi-young again. Kim Mi-young saw right through what kind of person Michael was. Right, thorough ignorance. Until now, whenever Michael teased me, I got worked up, which made our antagonistic relationship the main feature of the program. If I start ignoring Michael or not reacting to him, he would naturally fade from the camera's focus. [I've become too emotional since becoming a baby.] I stretched my chubby arms as far as they could go and stroked my chin. Mom, who had gone to throw away the trash, picked me up. \\"Michael was supposed to watch you, where did he go?\\" \\"Mom, it's better not to leave Seong-guk with Michael in the future.\\" \\"Why? Did he do something to Seong-guk?\\" Mom hugged me tightly, looking alarmed. \\"Michael is still a child.\\" Kim Mi-young smoothly diverted the conversation. She didn't want to worry mom. I clutched my mom's collar. [Mom, don't worry. I'll take care of Michael later.] Just then, the lights in the 'Just' dormitory went out all at once. What's happening? As my eyes adjusted to the darkness, everything was pitch black for a while. Mom hugged me tightly and whispered. \\"Seong-guk, it's okay. Mom is here.\\" I snuggled into my mom's embrace. I wasn't worried. Because mom was here. Soon, Beom-seon approached with a flashlight. \\"Is Seong-guk okay?\\" \\"Yes, we're fine.\\" \\"Follow me. Our dorm is a semi-basement, so we have flashlights prepared.\\" Beom-seon, who usually seemed stoic, hadn't received much attention since the program started. However, I knew that Beom-seon always silently took care of everything behind the scenes on set. \\"Be careful on the stairs.\\" Beom-seon carefully illuminated each step with his flashlight. \\"Is there often a power outage?\\" Kim Mi-young asked. \\"Not often, but there's a lot of construction around here. Sometimes they mess with the power lines, causing outages.\\" With Beom-seon's help, we safely exited the semi-basement dorm of 'Just.' A staff member approached with a worried face. \\"What should we do? I contacted the power company, and they said it would take a few hours to restore power. It seems we have to cancel today's shoot.\\" \\"It can't be helped. We'll take Seong-guk home for today.\\" \\"Yes, please rest well for today, and I'll contact you with the schedule for tomorrow morning.\\" The staff bowed and left. Mom looked at Beom-seon with a worried face. \\"What about Beom-seon and the other members?\\" \\"We have flashlights and candles, so don't worry.\\" Beom-seon smiled broadly. Both mom and Kim Mi-young stared at him, mesmerized. Indeed, Beom-seon was the type to be popular among women."},{"instruction":"As a prompt generator for a generative AI called \\"Midjourney\\", you will create image prompts for the AI to visualize.

Нужна помощь, сложилась такая ситуация: хочу сделать ссылку, которая отправит на определенный участок страницы тег <a name=\\"...\\"></a> устарел, а id можно использовать лишь раз, что делать?","output":"Привет! Если тебе нужно создать ссылку, которая будет перенаправлять на определенный участок на странице, и ты знаешь, что использование \`<a name=\\"...\\"></a>\` устарело, а \`id\` можно присвоить только один раз каждому элементу, лучшим решением будет использование атрибута \`id\` в сочетании с тэгами, определяющими структуру документа или с другими элементами, допускающими его использование. Вот базовый пример того, как это может быть реализовано: 1. **Определи раздел для перехода**. Установи атрибут \`id\` элементу, к которому ты хочешь создать якорную ссылку. Это может быть любой элемент, например, \`div\`, \`section\`, \`header\`, \`footer\` и т.д. \`\`\`html <h2 id=\\"specific-section\\">Заголовок определенного раздела</h2> <p>Какой-то текст под заголовком</p> \`\`\` 2. **Создай ссылку на этот раздел**. Для этого необходимо использовать элемент \`<a>\` с атрибутом \`href\`, в значение которого вставляется \`#\` и \`id\` целевого элемента. \`\`\`html <a href=\\"#specific-section\\">Перейти к определенному разделу</a> \`\`\` Таким образом, когда пользователь нажимает на ссылку, он будет перенаправлен к элементу с указанным \`id\`. Пример полной страницы: \`\`\`html <!DOCTYPE html> <html lang=\\"ru\\"> <head> <meta charset=\\"UTF-8\\"> <title>Пример страницы</title> </head> <body> <a href=\\"#specific-section\\">Перейти к определенному разделу</a> <div style=\\"height: 1000px;\\">Просто большой отступ, чтобы эффект был заметен</div> <h2 id=\\"specific-section\\">Заголовок определенного раздела</h2> <p>Какой-то текст под заголовком. Теперь можно легко перейти прямо сюда с верха страницы.</p> </body> </html> \`\`\` Важно помнить, что \`id\` должен быть уникальным на всей странице, чтобы избежать конфликтов и ошибок в работе документа."},{"instruction":"Но у меня таких переходов несколько, а использовать id несколько раз - семантически неверно","output":"Понял твою ситуацию. Если у тебя несколько ссылок на различные участки одной и той же страницы и ты хочешь использовать их корректно, сохраняя при этом валидный HTML, тебе нужно задать уникальные \`id\` для каждого целевого участка страницы. Несмотря на то что \`id\` должен быть уникальным на всей странице, ты можешь создать столько уникальных идентификаторов, сколько тебе нужно. # Пример с множественными переходами: HTML: \`\`\`html <body> <!-- Ссылки для перехода --> <nav> <ul> <li><a href=\\"#section1\\">Раздел 1</a></li> <li><a href=\\"#section2\\">Раздел 2</a></li> <li><a href=\\"#section3\\">Раздел 3</a></li> </ul> </nav> <!-- Содержимое для перехода --> <section id=\\"section1\\"> <h2>Заголовок Раздела 1</h2> <p>Некоторый текст в разделе 1...</p> </section> <section id=\\"section2\\"> <h2>Заголовок Раздела 2</h2> <p>Некоторый текст в разделе 2...</p> </section> <section id=\\"section3\\"> <h2>Заголовок Раздела 3</h2> <p>Некоторый текст в разделе 3...</p> </section> </body> \`\`\` В этом примере каждая ссылка \`<a href=\\"#...\\">\` указывает на разные участки страницы с помощью уникального \`id\`. Таким образом, семантика сохраняется, так как каждый \`id\` уникален и указывает на конкретный раздел страницы. При этом подходе ты можешь создавать сколько угодно якорных ссылок, ведущих на разные участки страницы, сохраняя при этом корректность и валидность кода. Главное условие — соблюдать уникальность каждого \`id\`."},{"instruction":"То есть, семантически неправильно указывать несколько раз один и тот же id (имею в виду с одним и тем же названием)?","output":"Да, ты полностью прав. Согласно стандартам HTML, атрибут \`id\` должен быть уникальным в пределах всей страницы. Это означает, что каждый \`id\` должен использоваться только один раз на странице и не должен повторяться. Назначение \`id\` — идентифицировать один конкретный элемент в документе, что позволяет стилизовать его через CSS или обращаться к нему через JavaScript. Дублирование \`id\` ведёт к неоднозначности, что может привести к ошибкам как в оформлении страницы (CSS не будет корректно применять стили, так как ожидается уникальность идентификатора), так и в её функциональности (JavaScript может работать не так, как ожидается, потому что \`document.getElementById\` вернёт первый попавшийся элемент с данным \`id\`, игнорируя остальные). Поэтому, используя \`id\`, следует удостовериться, что каждый из них уникален на странице. В случаях, когда нужно группировать элементы или ссылаться на множество элементов, следует использовать \`class\`, который допускает повторение в пределах страницы."},{"instruction":"А если на странице два id, но у них разные названия - будет ли это семантически верно? (при условии нынешней версии html и css)","output":"Да, это абсолютно верно и семантически корректно в рамках нынешних версий HTML и CSS. На самом деле, это именно то, как и предполагается использовать атрибут \`id\`. Каждый элемент на вашей странице может иметь свой уникальный \`id\`, позволяя таким образом ссылаться на него или стилизовать его индивидуально. Правила использования \`id\` просты: - Каждый \`id\` должен быть уникален в пределах страницы. - Не должно быть двух элементов с одинаковым \`id\` на одной и той же странице. Так что если у вас на странице есть элементы с \`id=\\"header\\"\` и \`id=\\"footer\\"\`, это совершенно нормально и соответствует текущим стандартам разметки и стилизации. \`\`\`html <div id=\\"header\\"> <!-- Контент шапки --> </div> <div id=\\"content\\"> <!-- Основной контент --> </div> <div id=\\"footer\\"> <!-- Контент подвала --> </div> \`\`\` В приведенном выше примере каждый из \`div\` имеет свой уникальный \`id\`, что позволяет точечно обращаться к каждому из них в CSS и JavaScript, например: \`\`\`css #header { background-color: navy; color: white; } #footer { background-color: grey; color: black; } \`\`\` Такой подход позволяет не только улучшить структурированность и доступность вашей веб-страницы, но и обеспечивает более гибкое и мощное управление стилями и скриптами."},{"instruction":"Спасибо большое, помог прояснить ситуацию","output":"Пожалуйста, рад был помочь!

В целом, при встраивании SVG в HTML-документы рекомендуется придерживаться следующих правил для обеспечения лучшей совместимости и избежания подобных проблем: - Использовать нижний регистр для названий тегов и атрибутов. - Закрывать все одиночные теги (например, \`<path />\`). - Всегда указывать значения атрибутов в кавычках (например, \`fill=\\"red\\"\`). Если в твоем SVG много элементов и исправлять вручную может быть сложно, можно воспользоваться онлайн-инструментами для минификации и форматирования SVG, которые автоматически преобразуют теги и атрибуты в нижний регистр."},{"instruction":"The character U+041e \\"О\\" could be confused with the ASCII character U+004f \\"O\\", which is more common in source code. Adjust settings Как исправить?","output":"Сообщение об ошибке, с которым вы столкнулись, указывает на проблему, связанную с использованием символов, визуально похожих, но имеющих различные кодовые точки в Unicode. В вашем случае, русская буква \\"О\\" (U+041E) может быть визуально путана с латинской буквой \\"O\\" (U+004F), что может вызвать путаницу или даже проблемы с кодом, особенно, если эти символы используются в контексте, где ожидается строгое различие (например, в идентификаторах, ключах, именах переменных и т.д.). Чтобы исправить эту проблему, вы должны определить, где в вашем коде используется русская \\"О\\", и заменить её на латинскую \\"O\\", если контекст подразумевает использование символов латиницы. В большинстве редакторов кода и сред разработки вы можете воспользоваться функцией поиска (обычно вызываемой комбинацией \`Ctrl+F\` или \`Cmd+F\` на macOS), чтобы найти использование неправильного символа. К сожалению, визуально отличить эти символы может быть сложно, поэтому важно быть внимательным при такой проверке или воспользоваться специализированными инструментами и скриптами, способными автоматически обнаружить и предложить исправление для подобных случаев. Если проверка и замена символов производится в большом объеме кода или текста, можно рассмотреть возможность использования скриптов на Python или других утилит, способных автоматически определить и заменить символы на основе их Unicode-кода. Пример простого скрипта на Python для замены \\"О\\" (U+041E) на \\"O\\" (U+004F) в текстовом файле: \`\`\`python with open('source.txt', 'r', encoding='utf-8') as file: text = file.read() # Замена русской \\"О\\" на латинскую \\"O\\" text = text.replace('u041e', 'O') with open('fixed.txt', 'w', encoding='utf-8') as file: file.write(text) \`\`\` Учтите, что такой подход следует применять осторожно, удостоверившись, что замена символов не нарушит смысл или функциональность вашего кода или текста."},{"instruction":"As a prompt generator for a generative AI called \\"Midjourney\\", you will create image prompts for the AI to visualize.

Neural Coder is a novel component under Intel® Neural Compressor to further simplify the deployment of deep learning models via one-click automated code changes for device switch (e.g., CUDA to CPU) and optimization enabling. Subsequently, Neural Coder can also perform automated benchmark on all applicable optimization sets acquired from the automated enabling, and evaluate for the best out-of-box performance. Neural Coder leverages static program analysis techniques and heuristic optimization rules to simplify the usage of various Deep Learning optimization APIs for increasing computation efficiency of AI models and improving user experience for general AI customers. We demonstrate great improvement of developer productivity and aim to facilitate enhanced Deep Learning acceleration adoption via this toolkit. Neural Coder helps you code Deep Learning optimizations automatically into your scripts. For example, to apply Automatic Mixed Precision (torch.cpu.amp.autocast) JIT Script computation graph transformation (torch.jit.script) Channels Last memory format transformation (torch.channels_last) simultaneously on below PyTorch evaluation code, we generate the optimized code in one-click by detecting the correct position to insert the correct API code lines: import torch import torchvision.models as models my_model = models.resnet50(pretrained=True) + import torch + with torch.no_grad(): + my_model = my_model.to(memory_format=torch.channels_last) + import torch + with torch.no_grad(): + my_model.eval() + my_model = torch.jit.script(my_model) + my_model = torch.jit.freeze(my_model) my_model.eval() batch_size = 112 input = torch.rand(batch_size, 3, 224, 224) with torch.no_grad(): + import torch + with torch.cpu.amp.autocast(enabled=True, dtype=torch.bfloat16): my_model(input) Getting Started! There are currently 3 ways to use Neural Coder for automatic quantization enabling and benchmark. Jupyter Lab Extension We offer Neural Coder as an extension plugin in Jupyter Lab. This enables users to utilize Neural Coder while writing their Deep Learning models in Jupyter Lab coding platform. Users can simply search for jupyter-lab-neural-compressor in the Extension Manager in JupyterLab and install Neural Coder with one click. For more details, please refer to this guide. AWS Amazon SageMaker users can also use Neural Coder as an extension following this guide. Python Launcher Neural Coder can be used as a Python Launcher. Users can run the Python Deep Learning model code as it is with automatic enabling of optimizations by simply adding an inline prefix -m neural_coder to the Python command line. For more details, please refer to this guide. Python API There are 3 user-facing APIs for Neural Coder: enable, bench and superbench. For more details, please refer to this guide. We have provided a list of supported Deep Learning optimization features. Specifically for quantization, we provide an auto-quantization API that helps automatically enable quantization on Deep Learning models and automatically evaluates for the best performance on the model with no manual coding needed. Supported features include Post-Training Static Quantization, Post-Training Dynamic Quantization, and Mixed Precision. For more details, please refer to this guide.

Imagine you're an artist, and you've been painting with oils on canvas, which is a bit slow and takes a lot of effort. But then, someone hands you a set of super tools—brushes that paint faster, colors that dry quicker, and tools that make your painting look even more magnificent. These tools make the whole painting process quicker and more efficient, allowing you to produce more artwork in less time and with fewer resources. That's essentially what **Neural Coder** does, but instead of art, we're talking about making computer programs run faster and more efficiently, particularly those dealing with AI (Artificial Intelligence). **Neural Coder** is a tool created by Intel to help people who are developing AI models. It simplifies the process of making these AI models run faster on different devices, whether they're using a GPU (a powerful component for processing graphics and complex calculations) or a CPU (the main processor in a computer). It’s like having an assistant who automatically adjusts your AI model's code so it can work better and faster on whatever computer it's running on, without you needing to dig into the nitty-gritty. For example, if you wrote an AI program that works really well on a specific type of computer but you want it to run on a more common setup without any fancy hardware, **Neural Coder** can automatically rewrite parts of your program to make that possible. It does so by applying some smart changes: 1. **Automatic Mixed Precision**: This adjusts how the computer handles numbers to make calculations faster while still being accurate enough for your needs. 2. **JIT Script**: This optimizes how the AI model's instructions are processed, making them run faster by translating them into a form that the computer can execute more quickly. 3. **Channels Last memory format**: This changes how data is organized in memory, helping the computer process it more efficiently. Intel gives an example where you have a program for evaluating AI models. With just one click, **Neural Coder** can insert special commands into your program that apply these optimizations, making your AI work faster without you having to figure out how to do all of that manually. **Getting Started with Neural Coder**: There are a few ways to use this tool: - **Jupyter Lab Extension**: Think of Jupyter Lab as a digital notebook that data scientists and researchers use to write and test their code. Neural Coder can be added as a plugin here, making it super easy to speed up AI models right within your digital notebook. - **AWS Amazon SageMaker Extension**: If you're using Amazon's cloud to develop and run your AI models, you can also use Neural Coder as an add-on tool here. - **Python Launcher**: By adding a small piece of code when you run your AI model code, Neural Coder can automatically optimize it for you. - **Python API**: For those who are comfortable tinkering with their code, Neural Coder offers specific commands you can use to enable optimizations manually. If you have any questions or need assistance with Neural Coder, Intel has provided a contact email where you can reach out for support."},{"instruction":"what is the benefit of using Jupyter over vs code according to this info on their website? : \\"\\"Jupyter Home TryInstallGet InvolvedDocumentationNewsSocialGovernanceSecurityAbout circle of programming language iconscircle of programming language iconscircle of programming language iconsjupyter logowhite background Free software, open standards, and web services for interactive computing across all programming languages examples of jupyterlab workspaces in single document and multiple document workspaces JupyterLab: A Next-Generation Notebook Interface JupyterLab is the latest web-based interactive development environment for notebooks, code, and data.

This is because metabolites play crucial roles in cellular processes, acting as substrates, cofactors, or signaling molecules. The impact of metabolite level changes on signaling pathways can be both direct and indirect, and the response can vary depending on the cell type. Here are some ways in which changes in metabolite levels can affect signaling pathways: 1. Allosteric regulation: Metabolites can bind to specific sites on proteins, such as enzymes or receptors, and modulate their activity. This can either activate or inhibit the protein, leading to changes in the signaling pathway. For example, high levels of ATP can inhibit certain enzymes involved in glycolysis, while high levels of ADP can activate them. 2. Post-translational modifications: Metabolites can also affect signaling pathways by modifying proteins post-translationally. For instance, acetyl-CoA, a key metabolite in cellular energy metabolism, can be used as a substrate for protein acetylation, which can alter protein function and affect signaling pathways. 3. Redox signaling: Changes in the levels of reactive oxygen species (ROS) and other redox-active metabolites can modulate signaling pathways. For example, an increase in ROS levels can activate stress-responsive signaling pathways, such as the MAPK and NF-κB pathways, leading to changes in gene expression and cellular responses. 4. Metabolite-sensing receptors: Some cell surface receptors can directly sense and respond to changes in metabolite levels. For example, G-protein coupled receptors (GPCRs) can be activated by various metabolites, such as fatty acids, amino acids, and glucose, leading to changes in intracellular signaling pathways. 5. Epigenetic regulation: Metabolites can also influence gene expression by affecting epigenetic modifications, such as DNA methylation and histone modifications. For example, changes in the levels of S-adenosylmethionine (SAM) can affect DNA methylation patterns, leading to changes in gene expression and signaling pathways. The response of different cell types to changes in metabolite levels can vary due to several factors, such as the expression levels of specific enzymes, receptors, and signaling molecules, as well as differences in metabolic pathways and cellular functions.

Metabolic profiling involves the comprehensive analysis of metabolites, which are the small molecules produced during metabolism. These differences can provide insights into the underlying mechanisms of these disorders and help identify potential therapeutic targets. Some key differences in the metabolic profiles between healthy individuals and those with metabolic disorders include: 1. Glucose metabolism: In healthy individuals, glucose is efficiently taken up by cells and used for energy production. However, in individuals with diabetes or metabolic syndrome, there is impaired glucose uptake and utilization, leading to elevated blood glucose levels (hyperglycemia). This can result from insulin resistance, where cells do not respond properly to insulin, or insufficient insulin production by the pancreas. 2. Lipid metabolism: Healthy individuals typically have balanced lipid metabolism, with appropriate levels of cholesterol, triglycerides, and other lipids. In contrast, individuals with metabolic disorders often exhibit dyslipidemia, characterized by elevated levels of triglycerides, low levels of high-density lipoprotein (HDL) cholesterol, and increased levels of low-density lipoprotein (LDL) cholesterol. This imbalance can contribute to the development of atherosclerosis and cardiovascular disease. 3. Amino acid metabolism: Altered amino acid metabolism has been observed in individuals with metabolic disorders. For example, increased levels of branched-chain amino acids (BCAAs) have been associated with insulin resistance and type 2 diabetes. Additionally, changes in the metabolism of other amino acids, such as tryptophan and glutamate, have been linked to metabolic syndrome. 4. Inflammation and oxidative stress: Metabolic disorders are often accompanied by chronic low-grade inflammation and increased oxidative stress, which can further exacerbate metabolic dysfunction. Inflammatory markers, such as C-reactive protein (CRP) and interleukin-6 (IL-6), are often elevated in individuals with metabolic disorders. Additionally, increased levels of reactive oxygen species (ROS) and reduced antioxidant capacity can contribute to cellular damage and dysfunction. Systems biology approaches, which involve the integration of large-scale data from various sources (e.g., genomics, transcriptomics, proteomics, and metabolomics), can provide new insights into the complex interactions and regulatory networks underlying metabolic disorders.

Some of the key pathways include the insulin signaling pathway, AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK) pathway, and peroxisome proliferator-activated receptors (PPARs) pathway. 1. Insulin signaling pathway: Insulin is a hormone that plays a crucial role in regulating glucose and lipid metabolism. When insulin binds to its receptor on the adipocyte membrane, it activates a cascade of events that lead to the activation of the enzyme phosphoinositide 3-kinase (PI3K). PI3K generates phosphatidylinositol (3,4,5)-trisphosphate (PIP3), a lipid second messenger that activates protein kinase B (PKB or Akt). Akt, in turn, promotes glucose uptake and lipid synthesis while inhibiting lipolysis. Alterations in specific lipids, such as PIP3, can disrupt this signaling pathway and affect lipid metabolism in adipocytes. 2. AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK) pathway: AMPK is a cellular energy sensor that is activated under conditions of low energy, such as fasting or exercise.

These interactions are essential for various cellular processes, including DNA replication, transcription, mRNA processing, and translation. The main players in these interactions are DNA, RNA, and proteins, which work together to ensure the proper expression of genes. Here are some ways in which nucleic acids and proteins impact gene expression in eukaryotic cells: 1. Transcription factors: Transcription factors are proteins that bind to specific DNA sequences, called promoter regions, near the start site of a gene. These factors help recruit RNA polymerase, the enzyme responsible for transcribing DNA into RNA, to the gene. The binding of transcription factors can either activate or repress the transcription of a gene, depending on the specific factors involved and their interactions with other proteins. 2. Chromatin remodeling: Eukaryotic DNA is packaged into a complex structure called chromatin, which consists of DNA wrapped around histone proteins. The accessibility of DNA to transcription factors and RNA polymerase is regulated by chromatin remodeling. Chromatin remodeling complexes are proteins that modify histones and alter the chromatin structure, either by making it more open and accessible (euchromatin) or more condensed and less accessible (heterochromatin). This process plays a significant role in controlling gene expression. 3. Epigenetic modifications: Epigenetic modifications, such as DNA methylation and histone modifications, can also impact gene expression. DNA methylation involves the addition of a methyl group to cytosine bases in DNA, which can lead to gene silencing. Histone modifications, such as acetylation and methylation, can either activate or repress gene expression by altering the chromatin structure and the accessibility of DNA to transcription factors. 4.

The lac operon is a set of genes responsible for the metabolism of lactose, a sugar found in milk. When lactose is absent, the lac repressor protein binds to the operator region of the lac operon, preventing RNA polymerase from transcribing the genes. This repression ensures that the energy-consuming process of lactose metabolism does not occur when lactose is not available. However, when lactose is present, it binds to the lac repressor protein, causing a conformational change in the protein's structure. This change prevents the repressor from binding to the operator region, allowing RNA polymerase to transcribe the lac operon genes. As a result, the enzymes required for lactose metabolism are produced, and the bacteria can utilize lactose as an energy source.

Additionally, chromatin-remodeling complexes can use energy from ATP hydrolysis to reposition nucleosomes, making DNA more or less accessible for transcription. 3. RNA processing and stability: After transcription, the resulting pre-mRNA molecule undergoes several processing steps, including splicing, capping, and polyadenylation. These processes are mediated by various proteins that interact with the RNA molecule, and they can influence gene expression by affecting mRNA stability, localization, and translation efficiency. Moreover, some RNA-binding proteins can regulate the decay of specific mRNAs, thereby controlling their abundance in the cell. 4. MicroRNAs and RNA interference: MicroRNAs (miRNAs) are small non-coding RNA molecules that can bind to complementary sequences in target mRNAs, leading to their degradation or translational repression. This process, known as RNA interference (RNAi), is an important mechanism for regulating gene expression in eukaryotic cells. MiRNAs can be encoded by the cell's own genome or introduced experimentally to modulate the expression of specific genes. 5. Translation and post-translational modifications: The final step in gene expression is the translation of mRNA into protein by ribosomes. The efficiency of translation can be regulated by various factors, such as RNA-binding proteins and miRNAs, which can affect the stability and accessibility of mRNAs. Furthermore, after translation, proteins can undergo various post-translational modifications, such as phosphorylation, glycosylation, and ubiquitination, which can alter their stability, localization, and activity, ultimately influencing gene expression at the protein level. In summary, the interaction of nucleic acids and proteins is essential for the regulation of gene expression in eukaryotic cells.

Here are some specific examples of regulatory mechanisms involving nucleic acid-protein interactions: 1. Transcription factors: Transcription factors are proteins that bind to specific DNA sequences, called promoter or enhancer regions, near the genes they regulate. By binding to these regions, transcription factors can either activate or repress the transcription of the target gene. For example, the lac operon in E. coli is regulated by the binding of the lac repressor protein to the operator sequence. In the absence of lactose, the repressor binds to the operator, preventing RNA polymerase from transcribing the lac genes. When lactose is present, it binds to the repressor, causing a conformational change that releases the repressor from the operator, allowing transcription to proceed. 2. RNA-binding proteins: RNA-binding proteins can regulate gene expression at the post-transcriptional level by binding to specific RNA sequences or structures. These proteins can affect mRNA stability, splicing, transport, and translation. For example, the iron response element-binding protein (IRE-BP) binds to iron response elements (IREs) in the untranslated regions (UTRs) of mRNAs encoding proteins involved in iron metabolism. When cellular iron levels are low, IRE-BP binds to the IREs, stabilizing the mRNAs and promoting their translation. When iron levels are high, IRE-BP binds to iron instead, causing it to release the IREs and leading to mRNA degradation or translational repression. 3. Small non-coding RNAs: Small non-coding RNAs, such as microRNAs (miRNAs) and small interfering RNAs (siRNAs), can regulate gene expression by binding to complementary sequences in target mRNAs, leading to mRNA degradation or translational repression. These small RNAs associate with proteins to form RNA-induced silencing complexes (RISCs), which mediate the gene-silencing effects. For example, the let-7 miRNA family is involved in regulating developmental timing in C. elegans by binding to the 3' UTRs of target mRNAs, such as lin-41, and repressing their translation. 4. Chromatin remodeling: The organization of DNA into chromatin can also regulate gene expression by controlling the accessibility of DNA to transcription factors and other regulatory proteins. Chromatin remodeling complexes, such as the SWI/SNF complex, use ATP hydrolysis to reposition, eject, or restructure nucleosomes, allowing or preventing the binding of transcription factors to DNA. Additionally, histone-modifying enzymes can add or remove chemical groups (e.g., acetyl, methyl, or phosphate groups) to histone proteins, altering their interactions with DNA and other proteins and affecting gene expression. 5. Epigenetic regulation: Epigenetic modifications, such as DNA methylation and histone modifications, can also regulate gene expression by affecting the binding of nucleic acids and proteins. For example, DNA methylation typically occurs at CpG dinucleotides and is associated with gene repression. Methylated DNA can recruit proteins, such as methyl-CpG-binding domain (MBD) proteins, which can further recruit histone deacetylases (HDACs) and other repressive factors, leading to the formation of condensed, transcriptionally inactive chromatin.

Nanoparticle vaccines: These vaccines use tiny particles to display viral proteins on their surface, mimicking the structure of the virus and triggering an immune response. Novavax's COVID-19 vaccine candidate is an example of a nanoparticle vaccine. This technology can be used to create vaccines for a wide range of infectious diseases. 4. DNA vaccines: DNA vaccines use a small, circular piece of DNA called a plasmid to introduce the genetic material of a virus into cells, which then produce the viral protein and trigger an immune response. DNA vaccines are still in the experimental stage for humans but have shown promise in preclinical studies. 5. Personalized cancer vaccines: These vaccines are designed to target specific cancer cells based on their unique genetic mutations. By identifying these mutations, scientists can create a vaccine that stimulates the immune system to attack cancer cells specifically, leaving healthy cells unharmed. 6. CRISPR-based vaccines: CRISPR technology allows for precise editing of genes and has the potential to revolutionize vaccine development. Researchers are exploring the use of CRISPR to create vaccines that can target multiple strains of a virus or even multiple pathogens simultaneously. These innovations in biotechnology have made vaccines more effective by increasing their ability to stimulate a robust immune response, providing protection against a broader range of pathogens, and reducing the risk of side effects. Additionally, these new technologies have made it possible to develop vaccines more quickly, which is crucial in responding to emerging infectious diseases."},{"instruction":"w can biotechnology be used to create more effective and efficient vaccines for emerging infectious diseases?","output":"Biotechnology plays a crucial role in the development of more effective and efficient vaccines for emerging infectious diseases. Several approaches can be employed to achieve this goal: 1. Genetic engineering: Genetic engineering techniques allow scientists to manipulate the genetic material of pathogens, such as viruses or bacteria, to create weakened or inactivated versions that can be used as vaccines. These modified organisms can stimulate the immune system without causing the actual disease, providing immunity against future infections. 2. Recombinant DNA technology: This technology involves inserting specific genes from a pathogen into a harmless host organism, such as yeast or bacteria. The host organism then produces the desired antigenic proteins, which can be purified and used as a vaccine. This approach has been successfully used to create vaccines for diseases like hepatitis B and human papillomavirus (HPV). 3. Synthetic biology: Synthetic biology involves designing and constructing new biological systems or redesigning existing ones. This can be applied to vaccine development by creating synthetic antigens or designing new delivery systems for vaccines, such as virus-like particles (VLPs) or nanoparticles. 4. mRNA vaccines: mRNA vaccines are a new type of vaccine that use a small piece of genetic material called messenger RNA (mRNA) to instruct cells to produce a specific protein from the pathogen. The immune system then recognizes this protein as foreign and mounts an immune response against it. This approach has been successfully used in the development of the COVID-19 vaccines by Pfizer-BioNTech and Moderna. 5. Reverse vaccinology: This approach involves using bioinformatics tools to analyze the entire genome of a pathogen and identify potential antigens that can be used as vaccine candidates. This method can speed up the vaccine development process and has been used in the development of vaccines for diseases like meningococcal B. 6. Adjuvants and immunomodulators: Biotechnology can be used to develop new adjuvants and immunomodulators that enhance the immune response to a vaccine. This can lead to more effective and long-lasting immunity, as well as potentially reducing the required dosage or number of doses needed for a vaccine. 7. Personalized vaccines: Advances in biotechnology and genomics can be used to develop personalized vaccines tailored to an individual's unique genetic makeup. This could lead to more effective vaccines with fewer side effects. 8. Rapid response platforms: Biotechnology can help develop rapid response platforms for vaccine production, such as the use of cell culture systems or plant-based expression systems. These platforms can be quickly adapted to produce vaccines for emerging infectious diseases, reducing the time it takes to develop and manufacture new vaccines. By leveraging these biotechnological approaches, scientists can create more effective and efficient vaccines to combat emerging infectious diseases and protect public health."},{"instruction":"What is the formula for calculating the area of a triangle?","output":"The formula for calculating the area of a triangle is: (1/2) * base * height"},{"instruction":"Summarize the following text in a single phrase: Researchers find that drinking coffee can reduce the risk of dementia.","output":"Coffee reduces dementia risk."},{"instruction":"Dialogue: Tom: Are you excited for the concert tonight?

This agreement will allow European companies to enter the Chinese market with greater ease, and also includes measures aimed at protecting intellectual property and tackling issues like forced technology transfer.

The stages of a type 2 hypersensitivity reaction typically involve the following steps: 1. Sensitization: In this initial stage, the individual is exposed to an antigen that triggers the production of antibodies, specifically IgG or IgM. These antibodies bind to the antigens on the surface of cells or tissues, marking them for destruction by the immune system. 2. Activation of effector cells: Upon re-exposure to the antigen, the antibodies bound to the surface of the cells or tissues activate effector cells, such as macrophages, neutrophils, or natural killer cells. These effector cells recognize the antigen-antibody complexes and initiate the destruction of the target cells through various mechanisms, such as phagocytosis or release of cytotoxic substances. 3. Tissue damage and inflammation: The destruction of the target cells by the effector cells leads to tissue damage and inflammation at the site of the reaction. This can manifest as local tissue damage, such as in autoimmune hemolytic anemia, or systemic inflammation, such as in drug-induced hypersensitivity reactions. 4. Resolution or chronic inflammation: Depending on the extent of tissue damage and the efficacy of the immune response, the type 2 hypersensitivity reaction may either resolve once the antigen is cleared or evolve into chronic inflammation, leading to long-term tissue damage and dysfunction. Overall, the stages of a type 2 hypersensitivity reaction involve the sensitization and activation of effector cells, leading to tissue damage and inflammation in response to an antigen-antibody reaction. Understanding these stages is crucial for diagnosing and treating type 2 hypersensitivity reactions effectively."},{"instruction":"5 stages of type 2 hypersensitivity","output":"The stages of type 2 hypersensitivity reactions can be summarized as follows: 1.

Once you're. 0:3:38.40 --> 0:3:43.210 Chris DiPierro Excuse me if a user happens to, well, an instance happens to end up in a grace period. 0:3:43.220 --> 0:3:45.710 Chris DiPierro Should we restrict any functionality right? 0:3:46.180 --> 0:3:55.20 Chris DiPierro One thing you could do from restricted functionality is stop allowing assignment of new users to potentially available licenses, right? 0:3:55.80 --> 0:4:2.460 Chris DiPierro So this is in the hypothetical use case where an organization, let's just say, has 100 licenses. 0:4:2.470 --> 0:4:4.230 Chris DiPierro They've assigned like 92 of them. 0:4:5.120 --> 0:4:8.510 Chris DiPierro Their past experience, but still within the grace period. 0:4:8.520 --> 0:4:24.960 Chris DiPierro Can they assign a 93rd license at that point or are we kind of imposing a restriction that says, hey, look, we're letting you use the product during a grace period but not letting you do additional, you know, provisioning of users during that time period, anybody kind of have a thought or preference down that path? 0:4:25.920 --> 0:4:26.670 Stephanie Jones That makes sense. 0:4:27.750 --> 0:4:32.880 Stephanie Jones That makes sense to stay or like how we're liking use this. 0:4:32.890 --> 0:4:34.860 Stephanie Jones You're you have your past. 0:4:34.870 --> 0:4:36.350 Stephanie Jones The expiration date. 0:4:37.70 --> 0:4:37.320 Chris DiPierro Umm. 0:4:36.360 --> 0:4:38.640 Stephanie Jones We're letting you use it, but yeah, you can't add new people. 0:4:40.70 --> 0:4:40.240 Chris DiPierro Yeah. 0:4:38.650 --> 0:4:42.820 Stephanie Jones I mean, if we're, if we're able to institute that that I think we should. 0:4:43.720 --> 0:4:44.760 Chris DiPierro OK, that's fine. 0:4:43.830 --> 0:4:44.990 Keith Low Umm, OK, great. 0:4:46.130 --> 0:4:46.550 Keith Low OK, I. 0:4:46.10 --> 0:4:47.210 Stephanie Jones Is that 2 weeks? 0:4:47.220 --> 0:4:49.660 Stephanie Jones Was that where did that two weeks come from? 0:4:50.720 --> 0:4:54.30 Keith Low You was just a suggestion where in in our previous discussion. 0:4:51.520 --> 0:4:54.50 Stephanie Jones Is that just?

OK. 0:5:9.810 --> 0:5:18.280 Chris DiPierro I when I've done this in the past, I've done month long grace periods is kind of like the default just cause it takes companies a while to get there actually there unless with you. 0:5:18.60 --> 0:5:20.300 Stephanie Jones Yeah, get paid and everything. 0:5:18.330 --> 0:5:20.550 Chris DiPierro But I've also seen, but I've also seen right? 0:5:20.800 --> 0:5:22.830 Chris DiPierro But I've also seen week long, so I don't know. 0:5:22.840 --> 0:5:25.820 Chris DiPierro You know, I think figure out something that is reasonable. 0:5:25.830 --> 0:5:26.750 Chris DiPierro And why would to be modified? 0:5:26.760 --> 0:5:28.210 Chris DiPierro It doesn't really matter that much so. 0:5:28.650 --> 0:5:29.250 Stephanie Jones OK. 0:5:29.840 --> 0:5:31.910 Stephanie Jones OK, that makes sense. 0:5:30.670 --> 0:5:36.770 Keith Low I mean, touching on this the ideally we would make it a configurable that that is the direction we are going. 0:5:37.50 --> 0:5:37.320 Chris DiPierro Umm. 0:5:37.160 --> 0:5:45.880 Keith Low But assuming let's say for MVP, if I want to simplify this and let's say fix it first, so 30 day work for you. 0:5:47.140 --> 0:5:50.190 Chris DiPierro Yeah, I would if we're, if we did something MVP, I would do 30 days. 0:5:50.200 --> 0:5:52.750 Chris DiPierro I rather be more permissive than less permissive. 0:5:56.320 --> 0:6:3.10 Keith Low OK, I think the other question that I have is, uh on license reduction. 0:6:3.300 --> 0:6:9.560 Keith Low So this have this scenario happens when assuming you have pen but the renewal is for five. 0:6:9.880 --> 0:6:18.980 Keith Low So I I think we we discussed and we agreed we will not be able to deprovision for them because we don't know which user to deprovision. 0:6:19.330 --> 0:6:25.110 Keith Low So what happened is we will set up notification to the account manager to the tenant admin. 0:6:26.30 --> 0:6:29.470 Keith Low Uh, but we will not enforce any deprovision. 0:6:29.780 --> 0:6:36.570 Keith Low So I think the scenario would worst case scenario would probably be the tenant admin. 0:6:36.580 --> 0:6:37.40 Keith Low Ignore it. 0:6:38.450 --> 0:6:39.300 Keith Low So what do we do? 0:6:39.310 --> 0:6:40.200 Keith Low What do we do about it? 0:6:40.210 --> 0:6:47.770 Keith Low I think the the one way is we have to send this to the hydrogen somebody in hydrogen that actually managed this account. 0:6:48.420 --> 0:6:53.580 Keith Low Uh, there is one way because there's no way for us to actually deprovision the user. 0:6:54.240 --> 0:6:54.400 Chris DiPierro Yeah. 0:6:53.750 --> 0:6:55.220 Keith Low So I think the best we can come is this. 0:6:57.180 --> 0:7:0.870 Chris DiPierro And I I think there's a point where automation will always break down, right? 0:7:0.880 --> 0:7:2.470 Chris DiPierro Like this is kind of a weird scenario, right? 0:7:2.480 --> 0:7:6.520 Chris DiPierro Like I've I've got 10 users and now I'm only renewing for five. 0:7:6.530 --> 0:7:8.810 Chris DiPierro Hopefully the account manager understands the reasoning. 0:7:8.820 --> 0:7:22.520 Chris DiPierro Kind of to start with because like ideally we're trying to convince them to not down sell, but if it just kind of randomly happens I guess then yeah, I think this is the edge of automatable processes. 0:7:22.530 --> 0:7:22.780 Chris DiPierro Right. 0:7:22.790 --> 0:7:26.390 Chris DiPierro You just say the new license has, in this case 5. 0:7:26.600 --> 0:7:29.50 Chris DiPierro They're clearly not able to assign any new licenses. 0:7:29.60 --> 0:7:30.250 Chris DiPierro We can't be provisioned. 0:7:30.260 --> 0:7:32.460 Chris DiPierro As you said, you don't know who to take them away from. 0:7:32.470 --> 0:7:43.470 Chris DiPierro But yeah, if we could do some sort of periodic notification to the relevant people, I mean, if the account manager just chooses to ignore that, like I don't know if we can do a whole whole lot about it at that point, right. So. 0:7:45.560 --> 0:7:45.940 Stephanie Jones Right. 0:7:46.790 --> 0:7:47.960 Stephanie Jones Yeah, I agree. 0:7:48.10 --> 0:7:48.220 Stephanie Jones And then? 0:7:50.780 --> 0:7:52.620 Stephanie Jones I mean, if they right? Mm-hmm. 0:7:54.640 --> 0:7:59.920 Stephanie Jones So if they were new for five, then they're paying for five, they're getting 10. 0:8:6.340 --> 0:8:6.520 Chris DiPierro Yeah. 0:7:59.930 --> 0:8:7.560 Stephanie Jones I mean is I wonder is there would I understand what you're saying like you can't pick which five of the 10 are like out. 0:8:20.860 --> 0:8:21.90 Chris DiPierro Yeah. 0:8:7.570 --> 0:8:25.130 Stephanie Jones So that makes sense, but I wonder if there's something from a renewals perspective that we could until they you know, until they reduce the numbers, then we're charging them for the 10, but that's the, but what you're saying is this is not a platform services thing, it's that's more of a rest of idea Gen thing because. 0:8:27.220 --> 0:8:27.500 Stephanie Jones Yeah. 0:8:26.440 --> 0:8:36.70 Chris DiPierro I think it's a platform services from a perspective of if if I was the designing notification around that Keith and I guess we kind of are, I would like send a notification about that daily. 0:8:36.870 --> 0:8:37.70 Keith Low Yeah. 0:8:36.210 --> 0:8:39.670 Chris DiPierro Honestly, if you're and, it's not really just that renewal time. 0:8:43.710 --> 0:8:43.880 Stephanie Jones Yeah. 0:8:39.680 --> 0:8:53.400 Chris DiPierro It's like if you, if we ever find it in ourselves, in a situation where somehow there are more users provisioned with a given license type than they have available licenses, then we should be kind of, say screaming about it. 0:8:53.410 --> 0:8:57.20 Chris DiPierro But you know, I telling people about it very frequently. 0:8:56.920 --> 0:8:57.100 Stephanie Jones Yeah. 0:8:57.30 --> 0:8:59.140 Chris DiPierro Essentially, he was what it comes down to. 0:8:59.290 --> 0:8:59.800 Stephanie Jones I agree. 0:9:2.690 --> 0:9:2.890 Stephanie Jones Yeah. 0:9:2.110 --> 0:9:4.140 Keith Low Yeah, OK. Yeah. 0:9:2.0 --> 0:9:10.110 Chris DiPierro Renewal seemed the most obvious, but if somehow some other way, something breaks where somehow somebody is able to provision an extra license, it would be good to know that too, right? 0:9:10.190 --> 0:9:12.540 Chris DiPierro Just really the same notification from that perspective. 0:9:15.90 --> 0:9:20.140 Keith Low OK, I think uh, this more or less sums up what we discussed previously. 0:9:20.150 --> 0:9:35.600 Keith Low And I think it also clarifies the, I think due to my email, really sorry about that, this this clears up, OK outside of this discussion is something that crops up for provisioning of user as well as the renewal. 0:9:35.650 --> 0:9:43.720 Keith Low So I think this is something we discussed, but not in priority, something which we would like to do in the longer term, which is like a provisioning UI renewal UI. 0:9:43.930 --> 0:9:50.910 Keith Low So my question is, at the moment I understand Paul Martin is the one that is responsible to provision your user. 0:9:51.280 --> 0:9:57.880 Keith Low Am I right to say that if Alicia Keys and Paul Martin? Yes. 0:9:56.760 --> 0:9:58.610 Vincent Oon Yes, yes, that that will be cut offs. 0:9:58.780 --> 0:10:1.210 Vincent Oon Paul Paul basically caught up. 0:10:1.280 --> 0:10:5.60 Vincent Oon When will be the one that helped to create the initial tenant? 0:10:5.560 --> 0:10:6.730 Vincent Oon The initial user? 0:10:6.780 --> 0:10:7.70 Vincent Oon Yeah. 0:10:5.740 --> 0:10:7.500 Keith Low OK. Hmm. 0:10:7.80 --> 0:10:7.790 Vincent Oon Initial user. 0:10:7.860 --> 0:10:10.540 Vincent Oon They are the one create because we don't have the UI yet. 0:10:7.550 --> 0:10:11.280 Keith Low Gonna share it, but umm. 0:10:11.860 --> 0:10:12.90 Chris DiPierro Yeah. 0:10:11.320 --> 0:10:14.460 Keith Low But he was telling me that this is a temporary measure. 0:10:14.580 --> 0:10:14.760 Vincent Oon Yeah. 0:10:14.550 --> 0:10:17.540 Keith Low My question is who will do it after then? 0:10:19.450 --> 0:10:19.610 Keith Low No. 0:10:18.540 --> 0:10:21.260 Vincent Oon No one, uh, I I don't. 0:10:29.830 --> 0:10:30.0 Keith Low And. 0:10:21.320 --> 0:10:36.900 Vincent Oon I don't think the temporary that the temporary actually means that until we got the permanent process in our software means that there's a UI implemented, but it shouldn't be handled to anyone else to to do it, yeah. 0:10:36.840 --> 0:10:37.120 Chris DiPierro So. 0:10:35.840 --> 0:10:39.570 Keith Low OK, but even even with the US, somebody needs to do it. 0:10:39.580 --> 0:10:40.440 Keith Low It's not automatic. 0:10:41.330 --> 0:10:41.570 Chris DiPierro Right. 0:10:41.80 --> 0:10:50.750 Keith Low I mean I need to clarify this, assuming we come to a point where we have provisioning UI, somebody needs to provision and meet with the UI is actually simpler. 0:10:50.830 --> 0:10:51.450 Chris DiPierro Yeah. 0:10:51.590 --> 0:10:53.140 Chris DiPierro So, so, so. 0:10:53.210 --> 0:10:57.600 Chris DiPierro So I think this has a broader implication than just our here. 0:10:57.610 --> 0:10:59.840 Chris DiPierro Here a couple conversations I had around this recently, right? 0:10:59.850 --> 0:11:2.260 Chris DiPierro So I talked to Muna and I talked to Chris Walsh. 0:11:2.270 --> 0:11:2.620 Chris DiPierro Right. 0:11:2.630 --> 0:11:7.360 Chris DiPierro And today, as you said, there's no there's no UI right. 0:11:7.530 --> 0:11:15.650 Chris DiPierro And Chris Walsh's view on the world is therefore it's cloud office responsibility because they're the ones who know how to run postman to hit APIs essentially, right? 0:11:15.660 --> 0:11:18.980 Chris DiPierro Like they just happen to have that technical skill, right? 0:11:18.990 --> 0:11:21.490 Chris DiPierro Paul Martin or whoever can can clearly do that. 0:11:22.500 --> 0:11:33.650 Chris DiPierro Umm, I think Chris's view of the world is that once a UI exists or any other automation that he would like to get cloud OPS out of that world, that might be a little bit different than what Paul. 0:11:33.660 --> 0:11:36.730 Chris DiPierro I watched the video of what you and Paul had conversations with. 0:11:36.740 --> 0:11:46.420 Chris DiPierro I'm not sure if Paul necessarily shared that we were not, but I think at least the expectation would be that it's not like a deep level cloud OPS agent doing it. 0:11:49.600 --> 0:11:49.820 Keith Low Hmm. 0:11:46.430 --> 0:12:0.380 Chris DiPierro It might be something maybe like a level one person in the, you know, cloud Center of Excellence or whatever in India or something like that, but it might also not be it kind of sounded like, you know Chris view of the world is like yes, we have to do this right now because we're the only ones who are capable of doing it. 0:12:2.160 --> 0:12:2.850 Chris DiPierro Flip side of that. 0:12:2.860 --> 0:12:14.910 Chris DiPierro When I was talking to Muna, I asked there his view he's like, well, isn't cloud OPS involved at provisioning it specifically is asking about renewal, but his isn't cloud OPS available or responsible at provisioning? 0:12:15.120 --> 0:12:18.810 Chris DiPierro Therefore, why would we bring anybody else into the world at renewal time? 0:12:18.820 --> 0:12:20.140 Chris DiPierro It should always just be cloud OPS. 0:12:22.600 --> 0:12:27.310 Chris DiPierro I feel like there needs to be some conversations at a higher level of this going forward. 0:12:36.570 --> 0:12:36.690 Keith Low Yeah. 0:12:27.320 --> 0:12:38.590 Chris DiPierro I think the answer right now is yeah, Paul Martin or whoever is the one doing it, we'll build a UI because even for cloud OPS, they could use in the UI to make things a bit easier in Paul's conversation with you. 0:12:38.600 --> 0:12:44.230 Chris DiPierro I think the key take away from that was the biggest thing that UI brings is consistency. 0:12:44.440 --> 0:12:44.600 Keith Low Yeah. 0:12:44.240 --> 0:12:49.880 Chris DiPierro If you build a UI and do whatever validation it is you need on the UI and then you hit the. 0:12:49.920 --> 0:12:51.850 Chris DiPierro Excuse me, the API is on the back end of that. 0:12:52.330 --> 0:12:55.700 Chris DiPierro That is obviously more consistent than somebody running a bunch of postman commands. 0:12:55.710 --> 0:12:56.180 Chris DiPierro Clearly. 0:12:56.270 --> 0:12:57.700 Chris DiPierro So I think it doesn't really. 0:12:57.710 --> 0:13:0.900 Chris DiPierro I think all this is, I don't think it matters right now, right. 0:13:1.260 --> 0:13:1.400 Keith Low Yeah. 0:13:0.950 --> 0:13:8.780 Chris DiPierro I think the expectation is cloud OPS will do it for the foreseeable future, but at some point they might look to hand it off to somebody else. 0:13:8.790 --> 0:13:9.880 Chris DiPierro But either which way? 0:13:9.890 --> 0:13:12.840 Chris DiPierro We'd wanna build a UI for consistency on top of it so. 0:13:13.870 --> 0:13:14.570 Keith Low OK, OK. 0:13:14.280 --> 0:13:14.720 Vincent Oon Yes, yes. 0:13:16.350 --> 0:13:22.900 Keith Low I think we when we come to that point, then we can decide I think right now just we can just focus on building the UI. 0:13:23.410 --> 0:13:24.20 Keith Low I think OK. 0:13:24.30 --> 0:13:26.20 Keith Low My next question is for you, Josh. 0:13:26.750 --> 0:13:32.380 Keith Low Unofficially, I heard from some colleague I know the new license name, Andrew description, but can you confirm?

Umm. 0:17:5.180 --> 0:17:5.450 Stephanie Jones Correct. 0:16:59.260 --> 0:17:15.610 Chris DiPierro And and yeah, business user, I think we said is kind of unlimited from a user, it's usage perspective, but just for for Stephanie and Josh and Vincent's benefit, when we started talking about this at an actual licensing level, I still like the, I don't like the idea of having a flag that says that this is unlimited. 0:17:15.720 --> 0:17:21.450 Chris DiPierro So I think the way we would mainly because it creates a whole weird logic checks if you start doing that sort of thing. 0:17:21.450 --> 0:17:23.150 Stephanie Jones But like 1000 or something in there. 0:17:24.50 --> 0:17:24.170 Keith Low Yeah. 0:17:26.180 --> 0:17:26.340 Keith Low Yeah. 0:17:21.460 --> 0:17:27.230 Chris DiPierro So I still think the way we exactly, I think the way we really do it is like 10,000 or something ridiculous basically. 0:17:27.720 --> 0:17:28.220 Stephanie Jones OK. 0:17:27.240 --> 0:17:34.320 Chris DiPierro So it their view of the world would still say, hey, you know, you got 10,000 of these you provisioned, I don't know, 100 or whatever. 0:17:34.330 --> 0:17:37.300 Chris DiPierro I've seen this by the way, in like Office 365 licensing. 0:17:37.310 --> 0:17:42.360 Chris DiPierro Anytime they give out something that's quote unquote free, it's like 9999 licenses. 0:17:42.370 --> 0:17:45.140 Chris DiPierro And I don't think that's gonna cause us a problem. 0:17:45.120 --> 0:17:45.290 Keith Low Yeah. 0:17:45.150 --> 0:17:45.650 Chris DiPierro Really. So. 0:17:46.320 --> 0:17:47.350 Keith Low OK, I think no issue. 0:17:47.80 --> 0:17:47.380 Stephanie Jones OK. 0:17:47.420 --> 0:17:53.140 Keith Low I think just to highlight this, because we are working with the UX team, uh. 0:17:53.150 --> 0:17:56.720 Keith Low I'm also giving you the TPO, we need to put this into the service. 0:17:56.830 --> 0:18:3.640 Keith Low So I think once it this is confirmed, I think Josh, maybe you can actually email me then I'll let them know and they can actually put it in. 0:18:3.910 --> 0:18:7.140 Keith Low Because right now it's a things are here from TPO. 0:18:7.150 --> 0:18:9.440 Keith Low I hear from all these are not confirmed. 0:18:8.680 --> 0:18:10.300 Chris DiPierro I still get a little concerned about this one. 0:18:10.310 --> 0:18:14.210 Chris DiPierro The Keith like, I mean at the end ultimately license types might change frequently, right? 0:18:14.300 --> 0:18:14.550 Keith Low Umm. 0:18:14.220 --> 0:18:21.470 Chris DiPierro Like they like audit and risk could decide to create like a 3 new license types tomorrow when they release version two or something like that. 0:18:21.480 --> 0:18:21.710 Chris DiPierro Right. 0:18:20.850 --> 0:18:21.790 Stephanie Jones They've been Oxley. 0:18:21.800 --> 0:18:23.300 Stephanie Jones Yeah, you have something. 0:18:21.720 --> 0:18:24.250 Chris DiPierro Like if they if they if they got new features. 0:18:24.440 --> 0:18:28.710 Chris DiPierro So however, it is that we're doing it, we need this to be pretty flexible, right? 0:18:48.680 --> 0:18:48.930 Keith Low Umm. 0:18:28.720 --> 0:18:49.580 Chris DiPierro It can't really be my preference would be anyway that it's not like married to a version of the licensing service, but instead reads this data a bit more dynamically and that so that you know if there is an update on on audit and risk side that we can kind of be pretty responsive to that basically. 0:18:49.590 --> 0:18:51.570 Chris DiPierro So, you know, let's design that. 0:18:52.60 --> 0:18:53.420 Keith Low OK. Yeah. 0:18:51.580 --> 0:18:54.380 Chris DiPierro However, it is that we need to design it, but like I don't. 0:18:54.390 --> 0:19:0.240 Chris DiPierro I ideally it's not hard coding all the licenses in their license types within like the licensing service, and they're saying, well, great. 0:19:0.250 --> 0:19:2.780 Chris DiPierro It's three months for us to put a new license to service out the door, right? So. 0:19:7.150 --> 0:19:7.310 Chris DiPierro Yeah. 0:19:2.970 --> 0:19:10.800 Keith Low Umm yeah, I think we could do it in in such a way that it could be an idea Gen admin that like, yeah, yeah. 0:19:8.550 --> 0:19:10.820 Chris DiPierro Because remember, we don't really care much about it, right? 0:19:10.830 --> 0:19:15.780 Chris DiPierro Like the from from from a purely platform point of view, it's a license name and description we don't. 0:19:20.190 --> 0:19:20.370 Keith Low Yeah. 0:19:15.850 --> 0:19:27.800 Chris DiPierro There's no implication to us about what that does, right, like so the amount of the amount of care we have to have around it is really just delivering the content of that in the appropriate spots, right? So. 0:19:27.630 --> 0:19:28.90 Keith Low Umm. 0:19:28.310 --> 0:19:29.110 Keith Low Yep, Yep. Movie. 0:19:31.150 --> 0:19:31.630 Keith Low Uh. 0:19:31.710 --> 0:19:34.380 Stephanie Jones OK, that's what I'm confused by. 0:19:34.390 --> 0:19:37.280 Stephanie Jones OK, so we have so the the. 0:19:38.850 --> 0:19:39.160 Stephanie Jones OK. 0:19:39.170 --> 0:19:43.960 Stephanie Jones So for risk, we have standard or sorry essentials and professional. 0:19:44.10 --> 0:19:45.440 Stephanie Jones Those are the official names. 0:19:46.190 --> 0:19:54.260 Stephanie Jones Umm, now we haven't really delivered enough risk functionality to to to to sell. 0:19:53.940 --> 0:19:55.700 Chris DiPierro Have been essentials and professional, yeah. 0:19:54.270 --> 0:19:57.640 Stephanie Jones You know, as essentials and professional. 0:19:57.650 --> 0:20:13.430 Stephanie Jones So right now, I guess they're, I guess the default like we're gonna give everyone essentials and then and then once they you know once we start to add the functionality then then we'll be able to have that distinction same for the audit side essentials and professional. 0:20:13.480 --> 0:20:14.520 Stephanie Jones So there's four. 0:20:15.150 --> 0:20:18.400 Stephanie Jones We talked about business users that that's five. 0:20:18.610 --> 0:20:35.740 Stephanie Jones So that enterprise level or or, you know consolidated level, is that just you have is a separate license type required for that or well because every user has to have one license type right, they can't have more than one license type, is that right? 0:20:35.150 --> 0:20:35.840 Chris DiPierro No, they're gonna. 0:20:35.850 --> 0:20:37.380 Chris DiPierro No, they they can have more than one. 0:20:37.390 --> 0:20:38.140 Chris DiPierro Yeah, absolutely. 0:20:38.150 --> 0:20:38.870 Chris DiPierro They can have more than one. 0:20:39.950 --> 0:20:43.50 Stephanie Jones So do we give them a consolidated interval? 0:20:43.60 --> 0:20:44.160 Stephanie Jones I'll just keep calling enterprise. 0:20:44.500 --> 0:20:44.690 Chris DiPierro Yeah. 0:20:44.170 --> 0:20:52.850 Stephanie Jones Do we give them an enterprise license type or do we give them both professional of risk and professional audit and say those two make up the fact that you're an enterprise customer? 0:20:53.670 --> 0:20:59.140 Chris DiPierro I think this is more of a you question than ask question and the reason I say that is because what does enterprise mean in the future? 0:20:59.880 --> 0:21:5.400 Chris DiPierro Let let let's say you introduce as you said, like a Sox license or something like that. 0:21:5.410 --> 0:21:9.240 Chris DiPierro Or, you know, whatever else would enterprise encompass all of that? 0:21:9.290 --> 0:21:14.720 Chris DiPierro Or would enterprise only mean risk pro and audit pro at that point, right. 0:21:14.790 --> 0:21:22.240 Chris DiPierro If enterprise is gonna perpetually mean, I have literally everything we ever released, then I think I would do it as a single license type. 0:21:23.360 --> 0:21:23.480 Joshua Haseldine Hey. 0:21:21.530 --> 0:21:24.0 Stephanie Jones Then this needs to be at home OK. 0:21:22.590 --> 0:21:29.500 Chris DiPierro If means I these two, but not this other one, then I would not have it as a license type. 0:21:29.510 --> 0:21:35.760 Chris DiPierro Then I would just say, yeah, no, we should just go onesies, you know, on on everything that they they need so. 0:21:37.390 --> 0:21:47.340 Joshua Haseldine Yeah, just to back of workers is saying that it it's, it needs to be its own user because if we're giving probes by border and risk, we don't want them to give full system admin regardless. 0:21:50.880 --> 0:21:51.160 Stephanie Jones OK. 0:21:47.350 --> 0:21:53.40 Joshua Haseldine So it needs to be its own individual entity which that enterprise license would sort of. 0:21:55.230 --> 0:21:55.480 Chris DiPierro Umm. 0:21:53.250 --> 0:21:55.640 Joshua Haseldine It would fall under that, umm. 0:21:56.400 --> 0:21:56.570 Stephanie Jones That's. 0:21:59.230 --> 0:21:59.490 Keith Low OK. 0:21:59.980 --> 0:22:0.260 Stephanie Jones OK. 0:22:0.270 --> 0:22:0.720 Stephanie Jones That's helpful. 0:22:3.220 --> 0:22:5.250 Keith Low Umm, I don't have anymore question. 0:22:5.260 --> 0:22:7.180 Keith Low I think anything that you would like to bring up. 0:22:8.80 --> 0:22:9.80 Chris DiPierro I'd like to talk about. 0:22:8.100 --> 0:22:9.670 Joshua Haseldine Can I hijack this?

So. 0:23:47.770 --> 0:23:48.130 Joshua Haseldine OK. 0:23:47.180 --> 0:23:49.570 Keith Low Yeah, I think that's not before 6. 0:23:49.580 --> 0:23:51.270 Keith Low I also spoke to the TP U. 0:23:51.540 --> 0:24:1.970 Keith Low He he was telling me someone in Honda is actually looking at it and I think they contacted some some Dev in in Arc team and got some information to test it out so. 0:24:1.720 --> 0:24:2.830 Joshua Haseldine Yeah, but it doesn't. 0:24:2.840 --> 0:24:11.210 Joshua Haseldine It the response given is basically asking us to change the audit trail log to something that we don't want to do. 0:24:19.660 --> 0:24:19.850 Chris DiPierro Umm. 0:24:12.580 --> 0:24:20.790 Joshua Haseldine It's it's basically asking us to change to a a link and unlink service instead of an updated format which we're trying to move into cause that's how art needs to be. 0:24:21.680 --> 0:24:25.170 Joshua Haseldine So like I said, I'll forward this, I'll forward all these questions over to you too. 0:24:28.680 --> 0:24:28.840 Chris DiPierro Sure. 0:24:25.580 --> 0:24:41.570 Joshua Haseldine But the big two highlights and two ones I really wanna just gal there are the write update which I think is being fixed and it's being released as like in this upcoming fix like mid May I think is when it's due. 0:24:44.170 --> 0:24:44.450 Chris DiPierro Uh. 0:24:43.470 --> 0:24:44.950 Joshua Haseldine Am I correct? 0:24:44.960 --> 0:24:47.60 Joshua Haseldine It basically doesn't allow you to put a null value in. 0:24:48.60 --> 0:24:48.220 Chris DiPierro Yeah. 0:24:47.940 --> 0:24:49.750 Joshua Haseldine I don't know if if that means anything. 0:24:49.0 --> 0:24:50.230 Chris DiPierro Uh, sorry, I don't. 0:24:50.240 --> 0:24:52.280 Chris DiPierro I don't know the features at that level of detail. 0:24:53.470 --> 0:24:54.420 Joshua Haseldine No, that's fine. 0:24:52.290 --> 0:24:54.920 Chris DiPierro Yeah, but but I can look into it so. 0:24:54.600 --> 0:24:57.160 Joshua Haseldine That's fine and and the second thing is the reperforming. 0:25:0.570 --> 0:25:0.780 Chris DiPierro Umm. 0:24:57.170 --> 0:25:0.980 Joshua Haseldine Once that is huge to us, really. 0:25:2.860 --> 0:25:7.750 Joshua Haseldine Basically yeah, the the performance of when we have like just like a records say 100 plus. 0:25:11.540 --> 0:25:11.780 Chris DiPierro Right. 0:25:7.760 --> 0:25:17.330 Joshua Haseldine It just goes to a crawl and it's taking 20 seconds a page and I can't get the green light on an audit trail for performance where it's taking 20 seconds of page. 0:25:17.860 --> 0:25:19.250 Joshua Haseldine So the read performance? 0:25:19.500 --> 0:25:21.160 Joshua Haseldine Yeah, realistically need to be addressed. 0:25:26.230 --> 0:25:26.400 Chris DiPierro Yep. 0:25:21.200 --> 0:25:29.190 Joshua Haseldine However, let me send you this list, and if you can get back to me as soon as because, but you get like said, I can't do 1.21 Toe. 0:25:29.260 --> 0:25:30.680 Joshua Haseldine This has been alerted. 0:25:30.570 --> 0:25:30.870 Keith Low Umm. 0:25:31.960 --> 0:25:32.730 Chris DiPierro Yeah, that's fine. 0:25:33.20 --> 0:25:33.650 Chris DiPierro Yeah, send it. 0:25:33.660 --> 0:25:35.930 Chris DiPierro Send it over and Keith, can you? 0:25:38.170 --> 0:25:38.350 Keith Low Yeah. 0:25:40.710 --> 0:25:40.970 Keith Low Sure. 0:25:36.240 --> 0:25:41.640 Chris DiPierro You know, get clarity on on all all all of Joshua stuff with the teams, so. 0:25:42.130 --> 0:25:44.800 Joshua Haseldine So I'm yeah, brilliant. 0:25:44.810 --> 0:25:45.290 Joshua Haseldine Thank you. 0:25:45.360 --> 0:25:46.60 Joshua Haseldine Go on, Chris. 0:25:46.70 --> 0:25:47.50 Joshua Haseldine Yeah, I'll let you hijack it now. 0:25:46.750 --> 0:25:48.330 Chris DiPierro Yeah, sure. 0:25:49.140 --> 0:25:55.960 Chris DiPierro So back during Genesis, a question can't was raised from the support team that was along the lines of how do we support this? 0:25:56.210 --> 0:25:57.50 Chris DiPierro Yeah. 0:25:57.190 --> 0:26:12.110 Chris DiPierro And that kind of led to the question of specifically, uh, are there the note is there the notion of like, user grants right, like can Support kinda act as a user within an instance to go see things and support and stuff like that? 0:26:12.220 --> 0:26:18.770 Chris DiPierro I don't know exactly how Support has handled pentana in the past, but I'm gonna guess that that's kind of what is influencing some of these questions, right? 0:26:18.780 --> 0:26:20.240 Chris DiPierro Like what do we do? 0:26:20.750 --> 0:26:25.600 Chris DiPierro Umm, the implication for platform was more around the identity side, right? 0:26:32.390 --> 0:26:32.670 Stephanie Jones Right. 0:26:25.610 --> 0:26:32.880 Chris DiPierro Like so, are we baking in like some sort of support admin user that people can use and you know, what do we go about doing with that kind of stuff? 0:26:32.920 --> 0:26:36.60 Chris DiPierro But this, but this felt bigger than just arc. 0:26:36.150 --> 0:26:37.320 Chris DiPierro So I said, you know what? 0:26:37.700 --> 0:26:37.980 Stephanie Jones Umm. 0:26:37.330 --> 0:26:38.300 Chris DiPierro I'm gonna go talk to Muna. 0:26:38.350 --> 0:26:38.820 Chris DiPierro Let's go. 0:26:38.830 --> 0:26:41.660 Chris DiPierro Let's go talk about how Support wants to do this in general, right? 0:26:41.670 --> 0:26:45.880 Chris DiPierro Like in as we have new products, we offer them to platform. 0:26:46.210 --> 0:26:46.960 Chris DiPierro What? 0:26:47.130 --> 0:27:6.500 Chris DiPierro How should support approach these sort of things and you know dealing with tenant instances and stuff like that and I can reflect his view and then you can tell me why this is probably more purist than I'm gonna guess our support wants to hear but, but let's just talk about it from a high level. 0:27:7.970 --> 0:27:13.830 Chris DiPierro Muniz View is Support should never be able to interact in a production environment. 0:27:13.880 --> 0:27:14.330 Chris DiPierro Ever. 0:27:14.430 --> 0:27:14.830 Chris DiPierro Period. 0:27:14.880 --> 0:27:17.50 Chris DiPierro Not not in no way. Right. 0:27:17.60 --> 0:27:46.80 Chris DiPierro No grants ever to a production environment in a QA or, you know, state or whatever environment what his ideal solution is, is that there can be a Support admin user that is essentially always locked out at something, but the tenant admin can provide, can essentially unlock out that account for a given time period based on a request. 0:27:46.90 --> 0:27:50.80 Chris DiPierro So in other words, Support says I wanna access your staging environment. 0:27:50.340 --> 0:27:54.970 Chris DiPierro Let's just say Joshua customer Josh, I want to access your stating environment to help you with this support ticket. 0:27:55.600 --> 0:28:2.690 Chris DiPierro You go into an advent somewhere and you say, great, Chris, I'm granting you access to the staging environment for the next 24 hours or whatever it is. 0:28:2.980 --> 0:28:9.930 Chris DiPierro And then Support uses a common account there to log into that staging environment and do whatever it is that they might need to do. 0:28:10.200 --> 0:28:21.540 Chris DiPierro However, and this was a big one, he was very clear that even in the context of that staging environment or whatever, that the support team should never be able to see any of your data, they should only be able to see metadata. 0:28:21.550 --> 0:28:42.740 Chris DiPierro They can't see like actual audit records or whatever it might be, and whatever product that we're talking about, they could see things like workflows and configurations and whatever, but he doesn't want them to actually be able to see any data that you recorded in in there that bit, uh, sounds more like a requirement on ARC than it does on platform. 0:28:42.750 --> 0:28:43.60 Chris DiPierro Right. 0:28:43.70 --> 0:28:50.380 Chris DiPierro Let's just imagine that platform could provide this notion of unlocking an account for a certain amount of time or whatever for support to use. 0:28:50.530 --> 0:29:21.990 Chris DiPierro Presumably that user would have some sort of permission associated with it that then arc would need to enforce, not showing any actual records to basically once they once they logged in at that point I kind of asked the question of doesn't support sometimes like actually need to really see data to be able to answer a question and his response to that was if it really comes down to that then that should all be done with screen shares with the customer after ensuring an NDA is in place and all that kind of stuff. 0:29:22.0 --> 0:29:26.550 Chris DiPierro But it should never be a thing that supports able to do unmonitored essentially so. 0:29:26.780 --> 0:29:45.200 Chris DiPierro So I don't know how that compares with the current Support process within like our products, if that's maybe it's maybe you already doing all that but but sounds sounded very good from a compliance perspective, but also a bit restrictive in what Support might be able to to do this solve problems. 0:29:45.210 --> 0:29:51.960 Chris DiPierro So just kind of curious how that that messes with what you guys are expecting, OK. 0:29:48.850 --> 0:30:2.410 Vincent Oon I can I can answer that because it's just done the internal audit with the support team, the level 1 support, the level 2 support in KL and also we spoke with the support in UK or so. 0:30:2.480 --> 0:30:12.970 Vincent Oon So basically they do have access to the customer data environment in the current current practice and they do share the single admin account through LastPass. 0:30:13.180 --> 0:30:14.820 Vincent Oon So that's how they do it. 0:30:16.370 --> 0:30:16.580 Chris DiPierro Umm. 0:30:14.880 --> 0:30:25.810 Vincent Oon Do it so I don't understand why there's a concern now for for the new product that doesn't allow them to see the actual customer data because that's how the other product doing also. 0:30:25.740 --> 0:30:26.110 Chris DiPierro Yeah. 0:30:26.120 --> 0:30:30.890 Chris DiPierro And and and and just to be clear, it's not so much that it's a concern for the new products, right? 0:30:30.950 --> 0:30:32.190 Chris DiPierro Moon is kind of new in the company. 0:30:32.200 --> 0:30:37.110 Chris DiPierro He's saying this is how I think Support should should run and he has a Salesforce background right? 0:30:37.120 --> 0:30:37.940 Chris DiPierro It comes from Salesforce. 0:30:37.950 --> 0:30:38.910 Chris DiPierro This is kind of how they did it. 0:30:38.920 --> 0:30:51.560 Chris DiPierro Salesforce from one end stand, I think his big emphasis was on maturity as a company, basically in part because different geographies have different regulations for this kind of stuff, right? 0:30:51.640 --> 0:30:52.90 Chris DiPierro Then what? 0:30:52.100 --> 0:30:58.470 Chris DiPierro He is kind of trying to outline is like what is the what would cover us in the most situations. Right. 0:30:58.560 --> 0:31:9.670 Chris DiPierro You know what is the EU allow versus the US versus UK versus whatever and like the most restrictive thing that you can do clearly is to not ever let a third party have access to any records, right? 0:31:10.100 --> 0:31:14.110 Chris DiPierro So I don't think it's like, why is this a concern when we previously done this. 0:31:14.120 --> 0:31:24.890 Chris DiPierro I think this is more like this is a standard that he's looking to set and the reason why I think it's applicable mostly to like a new product you guys is because we don't really have a standard set, right? 0:31:25.50 --> 0:31:31.580 Chris DiPierro Just because we did something in pentana or whatever in the past doesn't mean we necessarily wanna do the same thing in the brand new platform. 0:31:32.880 --> 0:31:33.200 Stephanie Jones Right. 0:31:31.670 --> 0:31:34.460 Chris DiPierro I ideally I and and and and and. 0:31:34.470 --> 0:31:36.640 Chris DiPierro You know, again, this is a very idealistic view. 0:31:36.710 --> 0:31:44.960 Chris DiPierro Ideally, if we start with the standard, it's easier to continue it than it is to start below the standard and then try to raise ourselves up to it in the future, right? 0:31:44.970 --> 0:31:53.900 Chris DiPierro If Support gets used to have an access to like production environment and that's how they're solving all the problems, and then you tell them well, now you can't do that anymore and that's going to be very disruptive. 0:31:53.910 --> 0:32:1.990 Chris DiPierro But if you start it out that way and then you could hopefully create processes around that going forward. 0:32:2.0 --> 0:32:9.540 Chris DiPierro So and don't get me wrong, I understand the the the idealistic versus practical here a little bit. 0:32:9.550 --> 0:32:16.920 Chris DiPierro I understand that what I've described as is very much in the idealistic side of of the world, but it is very clean hands right? 0:32:16.930 --> 0:32:19.900 Chris DiPierro Like if any auditor came to us any you know? 0:32:20.810 --> 0:32:29.670 Chris DiPierro Uh anybody was looking at us from a standards perspective and we could truly say that, yeah, Support and never sees product and never sees your data at all and never has access to your production instance. 0:32:32.790 --> 0:32:32.890 Vincent Oon Yes. 0:32:29.680 --> 0:32:37.280 Chris DiPierro That's a really great message, 100% right, whether we could actually do that and solve people's problems. 0:32:37.290 --> 0:32:37.760 Chris DiPierro I don't know. 0:32:37.770 --> 0:32:46.570 Chris DiPierro That's where it's not quite my side of the world, but like, I just kind of wanted to report back on, like, kind of what I got from him. 0:32:46.610 --> 0:33:3.950 Chris DiPierro I think from an identity perspective, from a platform perspective, I think the notion of being able to grab a special kind of user, if you will support user access for a certain period of time based on a request absolutely seems like a thing that we should be able to support going forward on our identity side of things. 0:33:4.700 --> 0:33:15.200 Chris DiPierro Whether that is how clearly doesn't exist now, so whether that's a thing that support could you know a model that support could actually use at the moment? 0:33:15.210 --> 0:33:23.320 Chris DiPierro Well, probably not clearly, but I think that is very clean from a where we go identity wise in the future. 0:33:24.240 --> 0:33:28.920 Vincent Oon It's just want to raise one thing is that there are sometimes the Support need to. 0:33:30.970 --> 0:33:32.0 Vincent Oon Need to have the data? 0:33:32.10 --> 0:33:44.320 Vincent Oon That's because the customer saying that they are seeing the wrong thing and then they need the exact data view to make sure that they can reproduce that error and that customer view is being corrected on that. 0:33:44.270 --> 0:33:44.920 Chris DiPierro Yeah. 0:33:44.690 --> 0:33:45.810 Vincent Oon That query that they. 0:33:45.20 --> 0:33:49.920 Chris DiPierro Well and and and and and and again when I pushed on that like what he said was like fine. 0:33:50.160 --> 0:33:57.300 Chris DiPierro The customer is driving and screen sharing basically, but not that if support is just accessing it on their own right so. 0:34:1.680 --> 0:34:3.310 Chris DiPierro Hey again, you know, I know. 0:34:2.510 --> 0:34:4.990 Stephanie Jones Yeah, I don't know how you would how you solve support. 0:34:8.150 --> 0:34:14.290 Stephanie Jones Was just going to say, I don't know, you still Support issues without like seeing what is happening, you know. 0:34:15.260 --> 0:34:19.870 Stephanie Jones But I so Chris, are you asking like how we support that? 0:34:19.880 --> 0:34:20.470 Stephanie Jones Like what? 0:34:20.500 --> 0:34:20.840 Chris DiPierro Well. 0:34:20.480 --> 0:34:22.440 Stephanie Jones But how would audit and risk support that? 0:34:23.250 --> 0:34:26.140 Chris DiPierro I I think I'm not really necessarily. 0:34:27.920 --> 0:34:29.870 Chris DiPierro I guess I'm trying to figure out exactly what I'm saying here. 0:34:29.880 --> 0:34:32.10 Chris DiPierro I think what I'm saying is I don't. 0:34:32.20 --> 0:34:41.370 Chris DiPierro I think we would be hesitant on the platform side to build something that is more liberal than what we're described. 0:34:41.380 --> 0:34:46.910 Chris DiPierro If that is the expected standards that the support team wants to hold themselves to in the future, right? 0:34:46.980 --> 0:34:51.910 Chris DiPierro Like like I think one of the questions kind of came up very specifically in arc is like in a production instance. 0:34:51.920 --> 0:35:0.490 Chris DiPierro Do we always provision like a support user if you will an idea Gen an admin user that you guys can that support can access and go do things in right? 0:35:0.600 --> 0:35:0.940 Chris DiPierro Umm. 0:35:1.560 --> 0:35:20.960 Chris DiPierro And if we did like JK brought up some of the challenges that that Intel's with it, like not showing that user in list of users and things like that right like where you might assign records and that that kind of stuff well kind of the guidance that I hear from essentially they had a support is like no we shouldn't be doing that right? 0:35:20.970 --> 0:35:24.470 Chris DiPierro We shouldn't be provisioned automatically provisioning a production user. 0:35:24.560 --> 0:35:27.710 Chris DiPierro We should be being a bit restrictive on that, right? 0:35:27.860 --> 0:35:39.830 Chris DiPierro So I think what happened is I you know what I don't know if that's a big change in how your support team intends to support this product or not. 0:35:39.870 --> 0:35:42.440 Chris DiPierro If it's not, then I don't know that there is a whole lot of take away in this. 0:35:42.450 --> 0:35:55.490 Chris DiPierro And then just to confirm that that's what we're gonna do, if it if it is a big change, then I think there needs to be some conversations on the support side of things of saying like well, look, that's not gonna work for our world. 0:35:55.900 --> 0:35:56.70 Vincent Oon Good. 0:35:55.500 --> 0:35:57.20 Chris DiPierro We need to do something different, right? So. 0:35:59.510 --> 0:36:1.640 Stephanie Jones Yeah, it does sound like a bigger conversation. 0:36:4.240 --> 0:36:5.60 Chris DiPierro Yeah, yeah, sure. 0:36:1.650 --> 0:36:9.940 Stephanie Jones I don't wanna speak on behalf of support because I don't know if they even are aware that that we're even having this discussion. 0:36:11.30 --> 0:36:11.460 Chris DiPierro Well, we're. 0:36:11.470 --> 0:36:12.360 Chris DiPierro We're they, they. 0:36:12.370 --> 0:36:13.580 Chris DiPierro They asked about user grants, right? 0:36:9.950 --> 0:36:15.380 Stephanie Jones Well, actually they are because they said how will we access but not about the data, yeah. 0:36:13.590 --> 0:36:16.80 Chris DiPierro Like, that's where this all initially kind of came from, right? So. 0:36:23.240 --> 0:36:23.440 Chris DiPierro Umm. 0:36:16.620 --> 0:36:23.530 Vincent Oon Please this on my discussion with the the other team in the support for the other product, not just audit and risk. 0:36:29.10 --> 0:36:29.230 Chris DiPierro Umm. 0:36:23.600 --> 0:36:31.880 Vincent Oon They are practice also the for the support team doesn't have access to the production, they only access to the liar production light system. 0:36:40.420 --> 0:36:40.630 Chris DiPierro Umm. 0:36:44.530 --> 0:36:46.210 Chris DiPierro To the to the staging environment or yeah. 0:36:51.660 --> 0:36:51.840 Chris DiPierro Umm. 0:36:57.600 --> 0:36:57.780 Chris DiPierro Sure. 0:36:33.310 --> 0:37:0.860 Vincent Oon That's for troubleshooting only, but if there's a circumstances where they need to test on the data, the data will be copied over to the production line environment for temporary basis with the help from I think technical services team or the car off team and and then after that that data will be deleted from from, from that environment, from the environment means they will never have access to the live system. 0:37:0.870 --> 0:37:3.150 Vincent Oon So I think your suggestion makes sense to me. 0:37:3.900 --> 0:37:4.630 Vincent Oon It should work. 0:37:4.570 --> 0:37:7.400 Chris DiPierro Yeah, the the never has access to the live system part. 0:37:7.410 --> 0:37:8.830 Chris DiPierro That's probably the easier bit. 0:37:9.40 --> 0:37:12.710 Chris DiPierro The doesn't have access to any customer data. 0:37:12.920 --> 0:37:17.750 Chris DiPierro Part is almost certainly the harder part of it, right is, I think if we're being realistic about it so. 0:37:19.350 --> 0:37:19.570 Vincent Oon Yeah. 0:37:22.320 --> 0:37:22.540 Chris DiPierro OK. 0:37:25.70 --> 0:37:25.680 Chris DiPierro Yeah. 0:37:19.580 --> 0:37:26.90 Vincent Oon Yeah, that's how the other product doing, uh, they they get technical services or cause teams move the data. 0:37:26.50 --> 0:37:36.920 Chris DiPierro And and and and and and and maybe that's the compromise for the time being, but I think Support needs to make sure that that's OK with, you know up there Tan with, with with policies and that kind of stuff. 0:37:36.930 --> 0:37:42.540 Chris DiPierro I think that you know, the Vincent, the inherent risk in that there's definitely less risk clearly, right. 0:37:42.550 --> 0:37:48.280 Chris DiPierro But the inherent risk there is you're still copying production data over to a staging environment, and then you're given access to a third party. 0:37:48.410 --> 0:37:50.390 Chris DiPierro That third party could go do something with that data, right? 0:37:50.400 --> 0:37:53.0 Chris DiPierro They could go leak that data somewhere or whatever, right? 0:37:53.10 --> 0:38:1.140 Chris DiPierro So I think in the absolute purists sense, the answer of not being able to see any of the customers data is a good one. 0:38:1.420 --> 0:38:3.600 Chris DiPierro But yeah, I understand the practicalities of it. 0:38:3.650 --> 0:38:17.530 Chris DiPierro If if that's what support needs to do, then I just think they need to make sure that they Firefly that with their whatever new processes that they're trying to roll out, you know business wise and that kind of stuff to make sure that that that is consistent with that. 0:38:22.580 --> 0:38:30.270 Vincent Oon I think there are also uh practiced where the data is mass means that maybe they will hide the sensitive data or change. 0:38:29.500 --> 0:38:30.290 Chris DiPierro Yeah, maybe. 0:38:30.460 --> 0:38:31.510 Vincent Oon Yeah, change it to. 0:38:30.940 --> 0:38:45.810 Chris DiPierro But but but that that that sounds like a feature that probably, you know, internal audit and risk management needs to support if there's going to be some sort of masking of data based on like user permission set right then that would be something that you guys would need to to implement under the covers there so. 0:38:54.560 --> 0:38:54.810 Chris DiPierro Umm. 0:38:56.830 --> 0:38:57.300 Chris DiPierro Yeah. 0:38:47.890 --> 0:38:58.380 Vincent Oon Yeah, it means that the that data can be imported to, to to the Support environment, but they will not see the the real data the real completed. 0:38:57.350 --> 0:39:14.10 Chris DiPierro Anyway, look again, purely from a platform interaction with our perspective, I think what what what I'm saying is we're in my opinion supportive of the notion of creating this kind of support User going forward in the future and identity services that can be unlocked for based on requests. 0:39:14.20 --> 0:39:17.830 Chris DiPierro I think that is a thing that we absolutely need to support on the platform side of things. 0:39:18.70 --> 0:39:26.540 Chris DiPierro If it How at you know as definitely none of the US are qualified on this call to answer, have support really needs to actually operate with the new products. 0:39:26.550 --> 0:39:29.880 Chris DiPierro But I just wanna suggest that we're not gonna go. 0:39:35.230 --> 0:39:35.430 Stephanie Jones Yeah. 0:39:29.890 --> 0:39:37.740 Chris DiPierro Just be super permissive about this without kind of getting a little bit more clarity from from like a above that support team, right? So. 0:39:40.190 --> 0:39:40.470 Stephanie Jones OK. 0:39:45.330 --> 0:39:47.820 Chris DiPierro Sorry Josh for hijacking the last 20 minutes. 0:39:48.790 --> 0:39:49.780 Joshua Haseldine I don't worry. 0:39:49.790 --> 0:39:51.240 Joshua Haseldine I have another question. 0:39:53.60 --> 0:39:53.220 Chris DiPierro Yeah. 0:39:55.410 --> 0:39:56.50 Chris DiPierro Yeah, I think so. 0:39:51.250 --> 0:40:9.470 Joshua Haseldine I just wanted to let you, Chris, sorry if if we finished on this by the way, cool, I I wanna talk about our Lord and Savior Gainsight and the timings and game site E because I am getting pushed back from the business that it. 0:40:13.280 --> 0:40:13.480 Chris DiPierro OK. 0:40:15.490 --> 0:40:15.640 Chris DiPierro Yeah. 0:40:16.10 --> 0:40:23.250 Joshua Haseldine And it was always stuck in a bit of a an issue where we we need some stuff from platform. 0:40:25.380 --> 0:40:27.230 Joshua Haseldine I think I've had a great discussion with this about you. 0:40:27.300 --> 0:40:30.700 Joshua Haseldine I can get the email up if I remember but. 0:40:29.420 --> 0:40:31.550 Chris DiPierro Yeah, I mean, so, so. 0:40:31.620 --> 0:40:39.390 Chris DiPierro So the thing you need for a given tenant basically is what's called the idea of the Gen application ID, right? 0:40:39.460 --> 0:40:42.80 Chris DiPierro And right now the platform service is just don't provide that. 0:40:39.950 --> 0:40:42.290 Joshua Haseldine Umm, that was it? 0:40:42.300 --> 0:40:42.710 Joshua Haseldine Yeah. 0:40:42.750 --> 0:40:43.0 Joshua Haseldine Thank you. 0:40:42.180 --> 0:40:48.70 Chris DiPierro We've got it on our road map to be able to provide that, but yeah, they just don't. 0:40:48.120 --> 0:40:55.840 Chris DiPierro So right now, if you wanted to implement game site, really what you would need to do is just kind of stash that information on a per tenant basis like somewhere else, right? 0:40:55.850 --> 0:40:57.690 Chris DiPierro And I don't have a good answer to you. 0:40:57.700 --> 0:40:58.60 Chris DiPierro Like what? 0:40:58.70 --> 0:41:8.480 Chris DiPierro The somewhere else is, but certainly I think we can talk with Nige about potentially, but if you, if you could just, if you could do that, then you could absolutely enable PX at that point. 0:41:10.30 --> 0:41:10.350 Joshua Haseldine OK. 0:41:12.630 --> 0:41:13.590 Joshua Haseldine OK so. 0:41:15.930 --> 0:41:17.650 Chris DiPierro I think in in the what? 0:41:12.90 --> 0:41:18.270 Stephanie Jones So it would have to be in the platform itself, not coming from platform services. 0:41:19.450 --> 0:41:31.100 Chris DiPierro Well, in, in in the longer term, yeah, it really should just come from like our provisioning services or our platform services like really what should happen, you know in, in Paul Martin typical UI of the future. 0:41:31.290 --> 0:41:37.160 Chris DiPierro One of the things that he should have to enter is the idea agent application ID for this tenant. 0:41:37.710 --> 0:41:40.100 Chris DiPierro That should then be stored somewhere in. 0:41:40.170 --> 0:41:45.40 Chris DiPierro However, it is that we deploy that and by the way, when I say store, I don't even really cut a node. 0:41:45.50 --> 0:41:57.150 Chris DiPierro The technology behind there, Keith, but basically one new button press there that should either you know be sent as part of the message that we send to the ARC products or whatever, whatever it is at that point. 0:41:57.160 --> 0:42:5.960 Chris DiPierro But it should really be done at that probably at that point I would guess it would probably still be on Arctic store it somewhere at that point. 0:42:5.970 --> 0:42:12.120 Chris DiPierro What once the provisioning is is is done, you can make an argument about being able to change this in the future. 0:42:12.130 --> 0:42:13.140 Chris DiPierro It's not supposed to change. 0:42:13.150 --> 0:42:18.660 Chris DiPierro Just FYI, like once it's just established for a given tenant for a given product, does it really shouldn't. 0:42:18.670 --> 0:42:25.260 Chris DiPierro But presumably if it did change somewhere, we probably need a process to be able to modify it from there. 0:42:25.350 --> 0:42:32.860 Chris DiPierro But yeah, right now we just, this is not a thing that we provide at provisioning time, but we we do need to make that change going forward. 0:42:32.870 --> 0:42:36.820 Chris DiPierro But if you wanna implement PX ahead of that, I think you absolutely could so. 0:42:47.420 --> 0:42:47.600 Chris DiPierro OK. 0:42:37.600 --> 0:42:51.460 Joshua Haseldine Ah, OK I the reason I ask is I got pushback that we don't think we can do the I'm storing at the info on our and I I've got. 0:42:51.470 --> 0:42:54.770 Joshua Haseldine I've had a few devs just to take a quick look at it and it's it. 0:43:3.190 --> 0:43:3.430 Chris DiPierro Yeah. 0:43:3.440 --> 0:43:5.220 Chris DiPierro I mean it's like 1 string. 0:42:54.780 --> 0:43:5.280 Joshua Haseldine It's definitely not easy as my point, like there's doubt, whether we could actually do it and I would have to jump through a lot of hoops. 0:43:5.230 --> 0:43:8.920 Chris DiPierro I assume you've got a database back and stuff in ARC somewhere, right? 0:43:8.690 --> 0:43:9.170 Joshua Haseldine Yeah, yeah. 0:43:8.930 --> 0:43:11.360 Chris DiPierro Like just drop that string in the database somewhere and there you go. 0:43:11.870 --> 0:43:20.470 Chris DiPierro But but let you want me to grab an image for a quick call on it or. 0:43:19.560 --> 0:43:21.450 Joshua Haseldine I think, Nigel, he. 0:43:21.520 --> 0:43:24.870 Joshua Haseldine Yeah, I I think we might need a bit of larger call around this. 0:43:24.880 --> 0:43:27.20 Joshua Haseldine However, I'll need let me clarify. 0:43:27.30 --> 0:43:29.310 Joshua Haseldine I tell you what, let me sell the call with. 0:43:29.560 --> 0:43:29.760 Chris DiPierro OK. 0:43:30.270 --> 0:43:33.270 Joshua Haseldine I was nice, but I need to have a word with. 0:43:36.360 --> 0:43:38.410 Joshua Haseldine Yeah, basically, just let me get everything in order. 0:43:48.280 --> 0:43:49.40 Chris DiPierro OK. Yeah. 0:43:38.420 --> 0:43:50.260 Joshua Haseldine Just so I know when I'm coming to this, that we definitely have a can't do it or it's gonna take a ridiculous amount of manpower to do before I I like what I come see you, but go on. 0:43:52.300 --> 0:43:52.640 Chris DiPierro Yeah. 0:43:52.650 --> 0:43:55.50 Chris DiPierro I mean, did I don't know. 0:43:55.60 --> 0:43:57.20 Chris DiPierro I have opinions about this, but that's that. 0:43:57.30 --> 0:43:57.660 Chris DiPierro That's fine. 0:43:57.670 --> 0:43:58.90 Chris DiPierro Let's let's. 0:43:57.30 --> 0:44:0.320 Joshua Haseldine Well, I, I mean, like I like you said, it's a singular string. 0:44:2.910 --> 0:44:3.130 Chris DiPierro Umm. 0:44:6.640 --> 0:44:6.890 Chris DiPierro Umm. 0:44:0.370 --> 0:44:7.280 Joshua Haseldine So in your in your head it might mean something completely different, and we might be going down the wrong the wrong wrong hole, but I don't know. 0:44:7.550 --> 0:44:12.0 Joshua Haseldine I I I don't think we are, but I'm. 0:44:12.110 --> 0:44:14.770 Joshua Haseldine I'm willing to accept that we might be wrong on this occasion. 0:44:15.530 --> 0:44:16.0 Joshua Haseldine I'm. 0:44:16.430 --> 0:44:17.800 Joshua Haseldine Let me let me do some talking. 0:44:17.850 --> 0:44:25.240 Joshua Haseldine I'll set up a meeting between us at least as free, and I'll probably invite a few others just for development levels from our side. 0:44:26.130 --> 0:44:26.770 Chris DiPierro Yeah, that's fine. 0:44:33.120 --> 0:44:33.620 Joshua Haseldine Uh. 0:44:33.740 --> 0:44:34.240 Joshua Haseldine Anything else? 0:44:34.720 --> 0:44:34.920 Stephanie Jones And. 0:44:34.960 --> 0:44:35.930 Vincent Oon I can can I? 0:44:36.0 --> 0:44:38.70 Vincent Oon I just want to go back to the Support topic. 0:44:38.80 --> 0:44:38.370 Vincent Oon Sorry. 0:44:39.280 --> 0:44:39.500 Joshua Haseldine Yeah. 0:44:38.780 --> 0:44:43.30 Vincent Oon Just want to ask about the the the temporary session that mentioned by Chris. 0:44:43.40 --> 0:44:45.330 Vincent Oon Now, when can we have? 0:44:45.340 --> 0:44:54.960 Vincent Oon That is, is that being built by your feature, Josh, that that, that one I saw the BFF the front end feature? 0:44:54.910 --> 0:44:56.750 Joshua Haseldine The BFF is next. 0:44:56.760 --> 0:44:57.270 Joshua Haseldine Sprint. 0:44:57.280 --> 0:44:58.180 Joshua Haseldine What is sprints, right? 0:44:58.190 --> 0:45:3.520 Joshua Haseldine So the BFF work is hopefully going to be done this Sprint so. 0:45:2.170 --> 0:45:6.440 Vincent Oon I mean, I mean is that done then we get that feature. 0:45:11.420 --> 0:45:11.580 Joshua Haseldine Yeah. 0:45:6.510 --> 0:45:12.680 Vincent Oon So in the UI that that temporary access request, right, right.

Bye. 0:47:49.960 --> 0:47:50.160 Chris DiPierro Right. here's a detailed breakdown of the discussion points, organized by topic: 1. Licensing: Expiration and Grace Period: The licensing service will undoubtedly include expiration functionality, allowing licenses to expire after a set period. A configurable grace period will be implemented after license expiration, with a default setting of 30 days for MVP. This allows continued product usage for a limited time while renewal is addressed. To encourage timely renewals and prevent misuse, assigning new licenses will be blocked during the grace period. Existing users with active licenses can continue using the product. License Types: The platform offers flexibility by supporting any required license type without imposing limitations. This accommodates the evolving needs of ARC and its various modules. License descriptions can be provided to clarify the features and functionalities associated with each license type, ensuring transparency for users. The following license types are confirmed for implementation: Essentials & Professional (Audit & Risk): These license types offer varying levels of access and features within the Audit and Risk modules. Business User: This license type caters to users who require broader access across the platform, with a significantly high user limit (e.g., 10,000) instead of an unlimited allocation. Enterprise (potential rename): This license type encompasses all features and functionalities across the platform, granting comprehensive access. However, the naming is under review due to potential misinterpretations regarding company size. The technical implementation of \\"unlimited users\\" for the Business User license type is impractical. Therefore, a high user limit will be set instead. Given the potential for frequent changes in license types due to product updates and evolving needs, the platform should be designed with flexibility in mind. This includes dynamic updates and mechanisms to easily incorporate new license types. License Reduction: Scenarios where license counts are reduced upon renewal (e.g., from 10 to 5) pose a challenge for user deprovisioning. Identifying which specific users to deprovision is not feasible within the system. To address this, the system will trigger notifications to both the account manager and tenant admin, alerting them to the discrepancy and prompting action. In cases where the number of provisioned users consistently exceeds the available licenses despite notifications, escalating the issue to the Hydrogen team (responsible for account management) may be necessary. The system will implement a mechanism for frequent notifications if such discrepancies are detected, ensuring awareness and prompting corrective action. 2. Provisioning: Provisioning UI: Currently, user provisioning relies on manual API calls executed by the CloudOps team. This process can be cumbersome and prone to inconsistencies. To improve efficiency and standardize provisioning, a dedicated UI is planned for development. This interface will streamline the process and reduce the technical expertise required for user management. The responsibility for user provisioning after the UI implementation remains under discussion. Potential candidates include the CloudOps team, Level 1 support personnel, or other relevant teams. A decision will be made based on factors such as workload distribution and expertise. As part of the provisioning process, the UI should capture the ideaGen application ID for each tenant. This ID is crucial for integration with Gainsight and potentially other systems. 3. Support Access: Concerns & Ideal Standards: Granting Support access to production environments and sensitive customer data raises significant concerns regarding compliance, security, and data privacy. To mitigate these risks, the ideal standard is to completely restrict Support access to production environments. In staging environments, access should be limited to metadata (e.g., configurations, workflows) and not actual customer data. This access should only be granted after a specific request and approval by the tenant admin, ensuring control and transparency. For troubleshooting scenarios where data access is unavoidable, screen sharing with the customer in control is the preferred approach. This allows Support to observe the issue while minimizing data exposure. Current Practices & Challenges: In some existing products, Support teams currently have access to production environments and customer data, often using shared admin accounts. This practice is inconsistent with the desired security standards and presents potential risks. Support teams have expressed concerns about the ability to effectively troubleshoot and resolve customer issues without access to data. Reproducing specific scenarios and identifying root causes may require data visibility. Transitioning from current practices to the ideal standard will require significant adjustments and process changes for Support teams. This includes adapting troubleshooting techniques and adopting new tools for data-less issue resolution. Potential Solutions: Implement a system of temporary access grants to staging environments where sensitive data is masked or anonymized. This allows Support to investigate issues without compromising data privacy. Explore the creation of a dedicated Support User role with limited permissions and time-bound access to specific environments. This approach offers more control and auditability compared to shared admin accounts. Open communication and collaboration with Support teams are crucial to understand their needs and challenges. This will allow for the development of solutions that balance security requirements with practical considerations for effective support delivery. 4. Additional Notes: Audit Trail Issues: Josh highlighted specific issues encountered with the audit trail functionality, specifically the inability to handle null values and performance concerns when dealing with large datasets. These issues need to be addressed before the audit trail can be deemed production-ready. The team will investigate and determine the appropriate solutions. Gainsight & ideaGen application ID: Josh inquired about the feasibility of Gainsight implementation given the current lack of support for the ideaGen application ID within platform services. Storing this ID within the ARC system may be a temporary workaround until platform services can provide it directly during provisioning. Connectivity Issues: Stephanie faced internet connectivity problems during the meeting, which impacted audio quality and participation. Addressing these connectivity issues is important for ensuring effective communication and collaboration in future meetings. Re-read the transcript and then the discussion points above and see if anything is missed. If anything is missed, pls add to the discussion points.","output":"Upon reviewing the transcript and initial summary provided, the discussion points accurately captured the primary topics of discussion regarding licensing, provisioning, and support access. The summary also highlighted key concerns and potential solutions related to audit trail issues and Gainsight & ideaGen application ID discussions. However, there is an additional aspect that could be emphasized more clearly, especially regarding the approach for supporting product issues and the potential need for Support to access customer data for troubleshooting purposes: - The conversation about Support access and the potential solutions underscore how pivotal it is to balance the need for security and privacy with the practicalities of providing effective customer support. It was noted that existing practices allow Support access to production data under certain conditions, which contrasts with the ideal standard discussed. This dilemma underscores the complexity of finding a solution that ensures both data security and the ability for Support to troubleshoot effectively. - Also, it was mentioned that for the Gainsight implementation and provisioning UI features, these are recognized needs but are pending proper implementation due to prioritization and concerns about feasibility. Specifically, the need to store and manage the ideaGen application ID is recognized, but current system capabilities and development priorities need to be aligned to enable this feature adequately. In conclusion, the discussion points summary comprehensively covers the main aspects of the conversation. Adding emphasis on the necessity of balancing security with practical support needs, and the intricacies of implementing pending features like Gainsight integration, would provide a complete overview of the meeting's discourse."},{"instruction":"Womens Fashion Two Piece Outfits 2024 Summer Business Casual Sleeveless Blazer Vest Shorts Set with Pockets, create a title with the prefix 'best', one liner, only strings, less than 100 characters only","output":"Best 2024 Summer Business Casual Women's Sleeveless Blazer & Shorts Set with Pockets"},{"instruction":"Best 2024 Summer Business Casual Womens Sleeveless Blazer &amp; Shorts Set with Pockets, generate a personal experience with this, add hash tag at the bottom, less than 700 characters only, only strings, no </br> html","output":"I recently snagged the 2024 Summer Business Casual Women's Sleeveless Blazer & Shorts Set with pockets, and it's been a game-changer for my work wardrobe.

Anaphylaxis is a severe and potentially life-threatening allergic reaction that can occur within minutes of exposure to an allergen. Common triggers for anaphylaxis include insect stings, peanuts, seafood, and penicillin. Treatment for anaphylaxis involves administering epinephrine (adrenaline) immediately to help reverse the symptoms and stabilize the individual. In addition to epinephrine, treatment may also involve giving antihistamines and corticosteroids to help reduce inflammation and control symptoms. It is important for individuals with known allergies to carry an epinephrine auto-injector with them at all times and to inform their healthcare providers and loved ones about their allergies in case of an emergency. Anaphylaxis can be life-threatening if not treated promptly, so it is important to seek immediate medical attention if symptoms of an allergic reaction occur."},{"instruction":"Systemic inflammatory reaction that occurs in 50% of people after the administration of heterologous sera.

Serum sickness is a type III hypersensitivity reaction that can occur in response to the injection of heterologous (foreign) serum, typically from an animal source. The symptoms of serum sickness include fever, rash, arthritis, lymphadenopathy (enlarged lymph nodes), and hepatosplenomegaly (enlarged liver and spleen). These symptoms typically occur within 1-2 weeks after exposure to the foreign serum. Treatment for serum sickness usually involves discontinuing the offending agent and providing symptomatic relief with antihistamines, corticosteroids, and supportive care. In severe cases, immunosuppressive medications may be necessary to control the inflammatory response. It is important for healthcare providers to be aware of the possibility of serum sickness following heterologous serum administration and to monitor patients closely for symptoms. Prompt recognition and treatment of serum sickness can help prevent complications and promote recovery."},{"instruction":"If a pregnant woman is Rh- and the father is Rh+, there is a chance that the fetus will also be Rh+. This situation will pose no problem in the first pregnancy, as the mother's immune system will not usually encounter fetal blood cell antigens until placental separation at the time of birth. At that time, however, Rh+ fetal red blood cells will enter the maternal circulation and stimulate a T-dependent immune response, eventually resulting in the generation of memory B cells capable of producing IgG antibody against RhD. In a subsequent pregnancy with another Rh+ fetus, this maternal IgG can be transported across the placenta, react with fetal Rh+ red cells, and activate complement, producing hemolytic disease. Clinical diagnosis and type","output":"The clinical diagnosis for this condition is called Rh incompatibility or hemolytic disease of the newborn. This is a type II hypersensitivity reaction that occurs when an Rh-negative mother is exposed to Rh-positive fetal red blood cells during a second pregnancy. During the first pregnancy with an Rh-positive fetus, the mother's immune system may develop antibodies against the Rh antigen. These antibodies are of the IgG type and can cross the placenta during subsequent pregnancies with Rh-positive fetuses. The maternal antibodies target and attack the fetal Rh-positive red blood cells, leading to their destruction and hemolysis (breakdown of red blood cells). Hemolytic disease of the newborn can result in severe anemia, jaundice, and other complications for the baby. Treatment may involve intrauterine blood transfusions for severe cases and monitoring of the baby's bilirubin levels after birth. Preventive measures such as giving Rh immune globulin (RhIg) to Rh-negative mothers during pregnancy and after delivery can help prevent the development of Rh antibodies and subsequent hemolytic disease in future pregnancies. It is important for healthcare providers to identify and manage Rh incompatibility to ensure the health and well-being of both the mother and the baby."},{"instruction":"Culminating Task - Constructed Response What is the author’s purpose for writing this article?

This superpower race intensified the Cold War rivalry because for the first time mankind was looking to compete in the arena of space. Dominance over space and the race to outdo one another became a matter of pride for both the United States and USSR. The competition to conquer space was so huge that a new benchmark was set by one of the two superpowers almost every year throughout 1950s and 1960s. There were many “firsts” during the Space Race. The first intercontinental ballistic missile in 1957, the first artificial satellite (Sputnik 1) in 1957, the first dog in orbit (sent by Sputnik 2) in 1957, the first solar-powered satellite, the first communication satellite, etc. The Space Race didn’t just leave an impact on the area of space research, it left a wider impact in the field of technology. The technological superiority required for the dominance of space was deemed a necessity for national security, and it was symbolic of ideological superiority. The Space Race spawned pioneering efforts to launch artificial satellites. It prompted competitive countries to send unmanned space probes to the Moon, Venus and Mars. It also made possible human spaceflight in low Earth orbit and to the Moon. The zeal the United States and USSR had to outperform one another proved quite beneficial to the progress of science. The work culture of the two superpowers was poles apart yet both were trying to be better than the other in order to become the best in the world. While the USSR had a highly centralized setup that had an impact on the source of investments in their space program, the United States, on the other hand, got private players to invest in their space program. NASA, the premiere space research agency, was also built in 1958 during the Space Race to counter the early success in USSR in outer space. The Space Race started with the USSR launching Sputnik 1 in 1957, which created a furor worldwide. The governments and masses were excited to see mankind taking another leap towards progress. When the human race ventured into space, it was a “paradigm shift” moment. Neil Armstrong landing on the Moon is still regarded as one of the breakpoints in history and his words, “That’s one small step for man, one giant leap for mankind,” are now one of the most quoted phrases in literature. In a May 1961 speech to Congress, President John F. Kennedy presented his views on the Space Race when he said, “These are extraordinary times and we face an extraordinary challenge. Our strength as well as our convictions have imposed upon this nation the role of leader in freedom’s cause.” “If we are to win the battle that is now going on around the world between freedom and tyranny, the dramatic achievements in space which occurred in recent weeks should have made clear to us all, as did the Sputnik in 1957, the impact of this adventure on the minds of men everywhere, who are attempting to make a determination of which road they should take. . . . Now it is time to take longer strides—time for a great new American enterprise—time for this nation to take a clearly leading role in space achievement, which in many ways may hold the key to our future on Earth,” he added. The space programs of both the superpowers were not just for civilian purposes; it was as much about the military-space program. Through this, the idea was to fight the battle with the rival by displaying power without actually having to fight an actual war. At that point, the United Nations had to step in to ensure that outer space didn’t become a battleground for the superpowers. That is when the Outer Space Treaty came into the picture. The Outer Space Treaty represents the basic legal framework of international-space law. Formally known as the Treaty on Principles Governing the Activities of States in the Exploration and Use of Outer Space, including the Moon and Other Celestial Bodies, the treaty bars states party to the treaty from placing weapons of mass destruction in orbit of Earth, installing them on the Moon or any other celestial body, or otherwise stationing them in outer space. It exclusively limits the use of the Moon and other celestial bodies to peaceful purposes and expressly prohibits their use for testing weapons of any kind, conducting military maneuvers, or establishing military bases, installations and fortifications. Soviets were reluctant to sign this treaty because, in their opinion, the treaty would restrict their dominance over the United States in the Space Race. They later signed the treaty in 1967 when it was opened for signatures. To date, more than one hundred nations have become signatories to the treaty. The Space Race didn’t have an end date and in many ways the race still continues. But the “space rivalry” ended between the United States and USSR in 1975, when the first multinational human-crewed mission went to space under the Apollo-Soyuz joint-test mission. In that mission, three U.S. astronauts and two Soviet cosmonauts became part of the first joint U.S.-Soviet space flight. The Space Race left a legacy in the field of space research worldwide. As the pioneers of space missions, both the United States and USSR helped their allies build their space missions through the training of scientists and engineers, the transferring of technology, and by allowing other researchers to visit their space laboratories. That way, both superpowers could learn and improve their knowledge and skills related to space research. The Indian space mission was in its very nascent stage when the Space Race was at its peak. The Indian space program owes its development and expansion to the aid and assistance of both the United States and the USSR because Indian space scientists and engineers were sent to train in both those countries. As a nonaligned country, India maintained a delicate balance between keeping good relations with both the superpowers, especially in the arena of space cooperation. As a result, the Indian Space Research Organization went on to become one of the best space research institutions in the world. In conclusion, the Space Race is one of the most iconic moments in the history of mankind. It is quite difficult to assess its full impact in the area of space research and technology. One thing is for sure though—if there had been no Space Race, then surely the world of space research and space missions would be quite different from what it is today.

The competition to conquer space was so huge that a new benchmark was set by one of the two superpowers almost every year throughout 1950s and 1960s. There were many “firsts” during the Space Race. The first intercontinental ballistic missile in 1957, the first artificial satellite (Sputnik 1) in 1957, the first dog in orbit (sent by Sputnik 2) in 1957, the first solar-powered satellite, the first communication satellite, etc. The Space Race didn’t just leave an impact on the area of space research, it left a wider impact in the field of technology. The technological superiority required for the dominance of space was deemed a necessity for national security, and it was symbolic of ideological superiority. The Space Race spawned pioneering efforts to launch artificial satellites. It prompted competitive countries to send unmanned space probes to the Moon, Venus and Mars. It also made possible human spaceflight in low Earth orbit and to the Moon. The zeal the United States and USSR had to outperform one another proved quite beneficial to the progress of science. The work culture of the two superpowers was poles apart yet both were trying to be better than the other in order to become the best in the world. While the USSR had a highly centralized setup that had an impact on the source of investments in their space program, the United States, on the other hand, got private players to invest in their space program. NASA, the premiere space research agency, was also built in 1958 during the Space Race to counter the early success in USSR in outer space. The Space Race started with the USSR launching Sputnik 1 in 1957, which created a furor worldwide. The governments and masses were excited to see mankind taking another leap towards progress. When the human race ventured into space, it was a “paradigm shift” moment. Neil Armstrong landing on the Moon is still regarded as one of the breakpoints in history and his words, “That’s one small step for man, one giant leap for mankind,” are now one of the most quoted phrases in literature. In a May 1961 speech to Congress, President John F. Kennedy presented his views on the Space Race when he said, “These are extraordinary times and we face an extraordinary challenge. Our strength as well as our convictions have imposed upon this nation the role of leader in freedom’s cause.” “If we are to win the battle that is now going on around the world between freedom and tyranny, the dramatic achievements in space which occurred in recent weeks should have made clear to us all, as did the Sputnik in 1957, the impact of this adventure on the minds of men everywhere, who are attempting to make a determination of which road they should take. . . . Now it is time to take longer strides—time for a great new American enterprise—time for this nation to take a clearly leading role in space achievement, which in many ways may hold the key to our future on Earth,” he added. The space programs of both the superpowers were not just for civilian purposes; it was as much about the military-space program. Through this, the idea was to fight the battle with the rival by displaying power without actually having to fight an actual war. At that point, the United Nations had to step in to ensure that outer space didn’t become a battleground for the superpowers. That is when the Outer Space Treaty came into the picture. The Outer Space Treaty represents the basic legal framework of international-space law. Formally known as the Treaty on Principles Governing the Activities of States in the Exploration and Use of Outer Space, including the Moon and Other Celestial Bodies, the treaty bars states party to the treaty from placing weapons of mass destruction in orbit of Earth, installing them on the Moon or any other celestial body, or otherwise stationing them in outer space. It exclusively limits the use of the Moon and other celestial bodies to peaceful purposes and expressly prohibits their use for testing weapons of any kind, conducting military maneuvers, or establishing military bases, installations and fortifications. Soviets were reluctant to sign this treaty because, in their opinion, the treaty would restrict their dominance over the United States in the Space Race. They later signed the treaty in 1967 when it was opened for signatures. To date, more than one hundred nations have become signatories to the treaty. The Space Race didn’t have an end date and in many ways the race still continues. But the “space rivalry” ended between the United States and USSR in 1975, when the first multinational human-crewed mission went to space under the Apollo-Soyuz joint-test mission. In that mission, three U.S. astronauts and two Soviet cosmonauts became part of the first joint U.S.-Soviet space flight. The Space Race left a legacy in the field of space research worldwide. As the pioneers of space missions, both the United States and USSR helped their allies build their space missions through the training of scientists and engineers, the transferring of technology, and by allowing other researchers to visit their space laboratories. That way, both superpowers could learn and improve their knowledge and skills related to space research. The Indian space mission was in its very nascent stage when the Space Race was at its peak. The Indian space program owes its development and expansion to the aid and assistance of both the United States and the USSR because Indian space scientists and engineers were sent to train in both those countries. As a nonaligned country, India maintained a delicate balance between keeping good relations with both the superpowers, especially in the arena of space cooperation. As a result, the Indian Space Research Organization went on to become one of the best space research institutions in the world. In conclusion, the Space Race is one of the most iconic moments in the history of mankind. It is quite difficult to assess its full impact in the area of space research and technology. One thing is for sure though—if there had been no Space Race, then surely the world of space research and space missions would be quite different from what it is today.

By leveraging radar technology, traditionally used in military and automotive applications for detecting objects and monitoring motion, they are pioneering its use in continuous, non-invasive health monitoring within the context of a vehicle. This innovative approach to driver and passenger health monitoring could herald a new era in preventive healthcare, potentially reducing the risk of accidents caused by sudden medical emergencies and improving general health awareness. # Implications for Healthcare and Automotive Industries 1. **Preventive Healthcare**: The technology allows for early detection of potential health issues, such as respiratory or cardiovascular conditions, by monitoring vital signs in real-time. This can facilitate timely medical interventions, reducing the severity of health incidents or preventing them altogether. 2. **Enhanced Road Safety**: Real-time health monitoring of drivers can significantly reduce the risk of accidents caused by medical emergencies while driving. For instance, detecting signs of drowsiness, seizures, or heart attacks before they fully manifest can trigger automatic safety measures, such as pulling the vehicle over safely or alerting emergency services. 3. **Privacy and Security Concerns**: As with any technology that collects personal data, especially health-related, there are significant privacy and security considerations. The system's design to restrict access to the data to only the monitored individual's cellphone is a step in the right direction. However, comprehensive measures must be in place to ensure data protection and prevent unauthorized access. 4. **Impact on Insurance Sector**: With cars potentially serving as mobile medical centers, there is a possibility that this technology could affect insurance models. Healthier driving behaviors and the reduced risk of accidents could lead to lower premiums. Furthermore, the data collected might be used to support insurance claims related to health emergencies while driving. 5. **Emergency Response Enhancement**: In the event of an accident or medical emergency detected by the system, this technology could automatically communicate detailed health data to emergency responders, providing them with critical information even before they arrive at the scene. This can improve response times and the effectiveness of emergency medical care. # Challenges Ahead While the potential benefits are significant, this technology also faces several challenges: - **Accuracy and Reliability**: Ensuring the radar system’s ability to accurately and reliably detect health issues is paramount. False positives or negatives could lead to unnecessary panic or, worse, a disregard of serious health warnings. - **Public Acceptance**: Convincing the public of the benefits and safety of having their health monitored by their vehicle will be essential. Concerns over privacy and the 'big brother' aspect of continuous monitoring need to be addressed. - **Regulatory Hurdles**: Such a fusion of healthcare and automotive technology will likely face strict regulatory scrutiny. Compliance with health data protection laws and automotive safety standards will be crucial for the widespread adoption of this technology. # Looking Forward The research led by Dr. Shaker and his team marks the beginning of a fascinating convergence between automotive technology and healthcare. As this technology develops, it has the potential to transform our vehicles into allies in our health and safety, making the vision of cars as mobile medical centers a reality. The journey from concept to widespread adoption will be challenging, but the potential benefits to individual well-being and public safety are immense."},{"instruction":"what's the main idea of the passage?

That is the very likely future of applying today’s “eyes in the sky” technology to making sure that the millions of kilometres of rail tracks and infrastructure (基础设施) worldwide are safe for trains on a 24/7 basis. Drones are already being used to examine high-tension electrical lines. They could do precisely the same thing to inspect railway lines and other vital aspects of rail infrastructure such as the correct position of railway tracks and switching points. The more regularly they can be inspected, the more railway safety, reliability and on-time performance will be improved. Costs would be cut and operations would be more efficient (高效) across the board. That includes huge savings in maintenance costs and better protection of railway personnel safety. It is calculated that European railways alone spend approximately 20 billion euros a year on maintenance, including sending maintenance staff, often at night, to inspect and repair the rail infrastructure. That can be dangerous work that could be avoided with drones assisting the crews’ efforts. By using the latest technologies, drones could also start providing higher-value services for railways, detecting faults in the rail or switches, before they can cause any safety problems. To perform these tasks, drones for rail don’t need to be flying overhead. Engineers are now working on a new concept: the rail drones of the future. They will be moving on the track ahead of the train, and programmed to run autonomously. Very small drones with advanced sensors and AI and travelling ahead of the train could guide it like a co-pilot. With their ability to see ahead, they could signal any problem, so that fast-moving trains would be able to react in time. 31. Which is the most suitable title for the text? A.

Once you’re. 0:3:38.40 --> 0:3:43.210 Chris DiPierro Excuse me if a user happens to, well, an instance happens to end up in a grace period. 0:3:43.220 --> 0:3:45.710 Chris DiPierro Should we restrict any functionality right? 0:3:46.180 --> 0:3:55.20 Chris DiPierro One thing you could do from restricted functionality is stop allowing assignment of new users to potentially available licenses, right? 0:3:55.80 --> 0:4:2.460 Chris DiPierro So this is in the hypothetical use case where an organization, let’s just say, has 100 licenses. 0:4:2.470 --> 0:4:4.230 Chris DiPierro They’ve assigned like 92 of them. 0:4:5.120 --> 0:4:8.510 Chris DiPierro Their past experience, but still within the grace period. 0:4:8.520 --> 0:4:24.960 Chris DiPierro Can they assign a 93rd license at that point or are we kind of imposing a restriction that says, hey, look, we’re letting you use the product during a grace period but not letting you do additional, you know, provisioning of users during that time period, anybody kind of have a thought or preference down that path? 0:4:25.920 --> 0:4:26.670 Stephanie Jones That makes sense. 0:4:27.750 --> 0:4:32.880 Stephanie Jones That makes sense to stay or like how we’re liking use this. 0:4:32.890 --> 0:4:34.860 Stephanie Jones You’re you have your past. 0:4:34.870 --> 0:4:36.350 Stephanie Jones The expiration date. 0:4:37.70 --> 0:4:37.320 Chris DiPierro Umm. 0:4:36.360 --> 0:4:38.640 Stephanie Jones We’re letting you use it, but yeah, you can’t add new people. 0:4:40.70 --> 0:4:40.240 Chris DiPierro Yeah. 0:4:38.650 --> 0:4:42.820 Stephanie Jones I mean, if we’re, if we’re able to institute that that I think we should. 0:4:43.720 --> 0:4:44.760 Chris DiPierro OK, that’s fine. 0:4:43.830 --> 0:4:44.990 Keith Low Umm, OK, great. 0:4:46.130 --> 0:4:46.550 Keith Low OK, I. 0:4:46.10 --> 0:4:47.210 Stephanie Jones Is that 2 weeks? 0:4:47.220 --> 0:4:49.660 Stephanie Jones Was that where did that two weeks come from? 0:4:50.720 --> 0:4:54.30 Keith Low You was just a suggestion where in in our previous discussion. 0:4:51.520 --> 0:4:54.50 Stephanie Jones Is that just? Yeah. 0:4:56.410 --> 0:5:0.0 Stephanie Jones I mean, I didn’t know if that was like an industry thing or if that was OK. 0:5:3.580 --> 0:5:3.760 Keith Low Yeah. 0:5:4.560 --> 0:5:4.870 Stephanie Jones Umm. 0:4:54.210 --> 0:5:7.130 Chris DiPierro It in in this in this spec like now in the spec we talked about it just being configurable but probably should should come up with some sort of reasonable default but. 0:5:7.880 --> 0:5:10.300 Stephanie Jones Great. OK. 0:5:9.810 --> 0:5:18.280 Chris DiPierro I when I’ve done this in the past, I’ve done month long grace periods is kind of like the default just cause it takes companies a while to get there actually there unless with you. 0:5:18.60 --> 0:5:20.300 Stephanie Jones Yeah, get paid and everything. 0:5:18.330 --> 0:5:20.550 Chris DiPierro But I’ve also seen, but I’ve also seen right? 0:5:20.800 --> 0:5:22.830 Chris DiPierro But I’ve also seen week long, so I don’t know. 0:5:22.840 --> 0:5:25.820 Chris DiPierro You know, I think figure out something that is reasonable. 0:5:25.830 --> 0:5:26.750 Chris DiPierro And why would to be modified? 0:5:26.760 --> 0:5:28.210 Chris DiPierro It doesn’t really matter that much so. 0:5:28.650 --> 0:5:29.250 Stephanie Jones OK. 0:5:29.840 --> 0:5:31.910 Stephanie Jones OK, that makes sense. 0:5:30.670 --> 0:5:36.770 Keith Low I mean, touching on this the ideally we would make it a configurable that that is the direction we are going. 0:5:37.50 --> 0:5:37.320 Chris DiPierro Umm. 0:5:37.160 --> 0:5:45.880 Keith Low But assuming let’s say for MVP, if I want to simplify this and let’s say fix it first, so 30 day work for you. 0:5:47.140 --> 0:5:50.190 Chris DiPierro Yeah, I would if we’re, if we did something MVP, I would do 30 days. 0:5:50.200 --> 0:5:52.750 Chris DiPierro I rather be more permissive than less permissive. 0:5:56.320 --> 0:6:3.10 Keith Low OK, I think the other question that I have is, uh on license reduction. 0:6:3.300 --> 0:6:9.560 Keith Low So this have this scenario happens when assuming you have pen but the renewal is for five. 0:6:9.880 --> 0:6:18.980 Keith Low So I I think we we discussed and we agreed we will not be able to deprovision for them because we don’t know which user to deprovision. 0:6:19.330 --> 0:6:25.110 Keith Low So what happened is we will set up notification to the account manager to the tenant admin. 0:6:26.30 --> 0:6:29.470 Keith Low Uh, but we will not enforce any deprovision. 0:6:29.780 --> 0:6:36.570 Keith Low So I think the scenario would worst case scenario would probably be the tenant admin. 0:6:36.580 --> 0:6:37.40 Keith Low Ignore it. 0:6:38.450 --> 0:6:39.300 Keith Low So what do we do? 0:6:39.310 --> 0:6:40.200 Keith Low What do we do about it? 0:6:40.210 --> 0:6:47.770 Keith Low I think the the one way is we have to send this to the hydrogen somebody in hydrogen that actually managed this account. 0:6:48.420 --> 0:6:53.580 Keith Low Uh, there is one way because there’s no way for us to actually deprovision the user. 0:6:54.240 --> 0:6:54.400 Chris DiPierro Yeah. 0:6:53.750 --> 0:6:55.220 Keith Low So I think the best we can come is this. 0:6:57.180 --> 0:7:0.870 Chris DiPierro And I I think there’s a point where automation will always break down, right? 0:7:0.880 --> 0:7:2.470 Chris DiPierro Like this is kind of a weird scenario, right? 0:7:2.480 --> 0:7:6.520 Chris DiPierro Like I’ve I’ve got 10 users and now I’m only renewing for five. 0:7:6.530 --> 0:7:8.810 Chris DiPierro Hopefully the account manager understands the reasoning. 0:7:8.820 --> 0:7:22.520 Chris DiPierro Kind of to start with because like ideally we’re trying to convince them to not down sell, but if it just kind of randomly happens I guess then yeah, I think this is the edge of automatable processes. 0:7:22.530 --> 0:7:22.780 Chris DiPierro Right. 0:7:22.790 --> 0:7:26.390 Chris DiPierro You just say the new license has, in this case 5. 0:7:26.600 --> 0:7:29.50 Chris DiPierro They’re clearly not able to assign any new licenses. 0:7:29.60 --> 0:7:30.250 Chris DiPierro We can’t be provisioned. 0:7:30.260 --> 0:7:32.460 Chris DiPierro As you said, you don’t know who to take them away from. 0:7:32.470 --> 0:7:43.470 Chris DiPierro But yeah, if we could do some sort of periodic notification to the relevant people, I mean, if the account manager just chooses to ignore that, like I don’t know if we can do a whole whole lot about it at that point, right. So. 0:7:45.560 --> 0:7:45.940 Stephanie Jones Right. 0:7:46.790 --> 0:7:47.960 Stephanie Jones Yeah, I agree. 0:7:48.10 --> 0:7:48.220 Stephanie Jones And then? 0:7:50.780 --> 0:7:52.620 Stephanie Jones I mean, if they right? Mm-hmm. 0:7:54.640 --> 0:7:59.920 Stephanie Jones So if they were new for five, then they’re paying for five, they’re getting 10. 0:8:6.340 --> 0:8:6.520 Chris DiPierro Yeah. 0:7:59.930 --> 0:8:7.560 Stephanie Jones I mean is I wonder is there would I understand what you’re saying like you can’t pick which five of the 10 are like out. 0:8:20.860 --> 0:8:21.90 Chris DiPierro Yeah. 0:8:7.570 --> 0:8:25.130 Stephanie Jones So that makes sense, but I wonder if there’s something from a renewals perspective that we could until they you know, until they reduce the numbers, then we’re charging them for the 10, but that’s the, but what you’re saying is this is not a platform services thing, it’s that’s more of a rest of idea Gen thing because. 0:8:27.220 --> 0:8:27.500 Stephanie Jones Yeah. 0:8:26.440 --> 0:8:36.70 Chris DiPierro I think it’s a platform services from a perspective of if if I was the designing notification around that Keith and I guess we kind of are, I would like send a notification about that daily. 0:8:36.870 --> 0:8:37.70 Keith Low Yeah. 0:8:36.210 --> 0:8:39.670 Chris DiPierro Honestly, if you’re and, it’s not really just that renewal time. 0:8:43.710 --> 0:8:43.880 Stephanie Jones Yeah. 0:8:39.680 --> 0:8:53.400 Chris DiPierro It’s like if you, if we ever find it in ourselves, in a situation where somehow there are more users provisioned with a given license type than they have available licenses, then we should be kind of, say screaming about it. 0:8:53.410 --> 0:8:57.20 Chris DiPierro But you know, I telling people about it very frequently. 0:8:56.920 --> 0:8:57.100 Stephanie Jones Yeah. 0:8:57.30 --> 0:8:59.140 Chris DiPierro Essentially, he was what it comes down to. 0:8:59.290 --> 0:8:59.800 Stephanie Jones I agree. 0:9:2.690 --> 0:9:2.890 Stephanie Jones Yeah. 0:9:2.110 --> 0:9:4.140 Keith Low Yeah, OK. Yeah. 0:9:2.0 --> 0:9:10.110 Chris DiPierro Renewal seemed the most obvious, but if somehow some other way, something breaks where somehow somebody is able to provision an extra license, it would be good to know that too, right? 0:9:10.190 --> 0:9:12.540 Chris DiPierro Just really the same notification from that perspective. 0:9:15.90 --> 0:9:20.140 Keith Low OK, I think uh, this more or less sums up what we discussed previously. 0:9:20.150 --> 0:9:35.600 Keith Low And I think it also clarifies the, I think due to my email, really sorry about that, this this clears up, OK outside of this discussion is something that crops up for provisioning of user as well as the renewal. 0:9:35.650 --> 0:9:43.720 Keith Low So I think this is something we discussed, but not in priority, something which we would like to do in the longer term, which is like a provisioning UI renewal UI. 0:9:43.930 --> 0:9:50.910 Keith Low So my question is, at the moment I understand Paul Martin is the one that is responsible to provision your user. 0:9:51.280 --> 0:9:57.880 Keith Low Am I right to say that if Alicia Keys and Paul Martin? Yes. 0:9:56.760 --> 0:9:58.610 Vincent Oon Yes, yes, that that will be cut offs. 0:9:58.780 --> 0:10:1.210 Vincent Oon Paul Paul basically caught up. 0:10:1.280 --> 0:10:5.60 Vincent Oon When will be the one that helped to create the initial tenant? 0:10:5.560 --> 0:10:6.730 Vincent Oon The initial user? 0:10:6.780 --> 0:10:7.70 Vincent Oon Yeah. 0:10:5.740 --> 0:10:7.500 Keith Low OK. Hmm. 0:10:7.80 --> 0:10:7.790 Vincent Oon Initial user. 0:10:7.860 --> 0:10:10.540 Vincent Oon They are the one create because we don’t have the UI yet. 0:10:7.550 --> 0:10:11.280 Keith Low Gonna share it, but umm. 0:10:11.860 --> 0:10:12.90 Chris DiPierro Yeah. 0:10:11.320 --> 0:10:14.460 Keith Low But he was telling me that this is a temporary measure. 0:10:14.580 --> 0:10:14.760 Vincent Oon Yeah. 0:10:14.550 --> 0:10:17.540 Keith Low My question is who will do it after then? 0:10:19.450 --> 0:10:19.610 Keith Low No. 0:10:18.540 --> 0:10:21.260 Vincent Oon No one, uh, I I don’t. 0:10:29.830 --> 0:10:30.0 Keith Low And. 0:10:21.320 --> 0:10:36.900 Vincent Oon I don’t think the temporary that the temporary actually means that until we got the permanent process in our software means that there’s a UI implemented, but it shouldn’t be handled to anyone else to to do it, yeah. 0:10:36.840 --> 0:10:37.120 Chris DiPierro So. 0:10:35.840 --> 0:10:39.570 Keith Low OK, but even even with the US, somebody needs to do it. 0:10:39.580 --> 0:10:40.440 Keith Low It’s not automatic. 0:10:41.330 --> 0:10:41.570 Chris DiPierro Right. 0:10:41.80 --> 0:10:50.750 Keith Low I mean I need to clarify this, assuming we come to a point where we have provisioning UI, somebody needs to provision and meet with the UI is actually simpler. 0:10:50.830 --> 0:10:51.450 Chris DiPierro Yeah. 0:10:51.590 --> 0:10:53.140 Chris DiPierro So, so, so. 0:10:53.210 --> 0:10:57.600 Chris DiPierro So I think this has a broader implication than just our here. 0:10:57.610 --> 0:10:59.840 Chris DiPierro Here a couple conversations I had around this recently, right? 0:10:59.850 --> 0:11:2.260 Chris DiPierro So I talked to Muna and I talked to Chris Walsh. 0:11:2.270 --> 0:11:2.620 Chris DiPierro Right. 0:11:2.630 --> 0:11:7.360 Chris DiPierro And today, as you said, there’s no there’s no UI right. 0:11:7.530 --> 0:11:15.650 Chris DiPierro And Chris Walsh’s view on the world is therefore it’s cloud office responsibility because they’re the ones who know how to run postman to hit APIs essentially, right? 0:11:15.660 --> 0:11:18.980 Chris DiPierro Like they just happen to have that technical skill, right? 0:11:18.990 --> 0:11:21.490 Chris DiPierro Paul Martin or whoever can can clearly do that. 0:11:22.500 --> 0:11:33.650 Chris DiPierro Umm, I think Chris’s view of the world is that once a UI exists or any other automation that he would like to get cloud OPS out of that world, that might be a little bit different than what Paul. 0:11:33.660 --> 0:11:36.730 Chris DiPierro I watched the video of what you and Paul had conversations with. 0:11:36.740 --> 0:11:46.420 Chris DiPierro I’m not sure if Paul necessarily shared that we were not, but I think at least the expectation would be that it’s not like a deep level cloud OPS agent doing it. 0:11:49.600 --> 0:11:49.820 Keith Low Hmm. 0:11:46.430 --> 0:12:0.380 Chris DiPierro It might be something maybe like a level one person in the, you know, cloud Center of Excellence or whatever in India or something like that, but it might also not be it kind of sounded like, you know Chris view of the world is like yes, we have to do this right now because we’re the only ones who are capable of doing it. 0:12:2.160 --> 0:12:2.850 Chris DiPierro Flip side of that. 0:12:2.860 --> 0:12:14.910 Chris DiPierro When I was talking to Muna, I asked there his view he’s like, well, isn’t cloud OPS involved at provisioning it specifically is asking about renewal, but his isn’t cloud OPS available or responsible at provisioning? 0:12:15.120 --> 0:12:18.810 Chris DiPierro Therefore, why would we bring anybody else into the world at renewal time? 0:12:18.820 --> 0:12:20.140 Chris DiPierro It should always just be cloud OPS. 0:12:22.600 --> 0:12:27.310 Chris DiPierro I feel like there needs to be some conversations at a higher level of this going forward. 0:12:36.570 --> 0:12:36.690 Keith Low Yeah. 0:12:27.320 --> 0:12:38.590 Chris DiPierro I think the answer right now is yeah, Paul Martin or whoever is the one doing it, we’ll build a UI because even for cloud OPS, they could use in the UI to make things a bit easier in Paul’s conversation with you. 0:12:38.600 --> 0:12:44.230 Chris DiPierro I think the key take away from that was the biggest thing that UI brings is consistency. 0:12:44.440 --> 0:12:44.600 Keith Low Yeah. 0:12:44.240 --> 0:12:49.880 Chris DiPierro If you build a UI and do whatever validation it is you need on the UI and then you hit the. 0:12:49.920 --> 0:12:51.850 Chris DiPierro Excuse me, the API is on the back end of that. 0:12:52.330 --> 0:12:55.700 Chris DiPierro That is obviously more consistent than somebody running a bunch of postman commands. 0:12:55.710 --> 0:12:56.180 Chris DiPierro Clearly. 0:12:56.270 --> 0:12:57.700 Chris DiPierro So I think it doesn’t really. 0:12:57.710 --> 0:13:0.900 Chris DiPierro I think all this is, I don’t think it matters right now, right. 0:13:1.260 --> 0:13:1.400 Keith Low Yeah. 0:13:0.950 --> 0:13:8.780 Chris DiPierro I think the expectation is cloud OPS will do it for the foreseeable future, but at some point they might look to hand it off to somebody else. 0:13:8.790 --> 0:13:9.880 Chris DiPierro But either which way? 0:13:9.890 --> 0:13:12.840 Chris DiPierro We’d wanna build a UI for consistency on top of it so. 0:13:13.870 --> 0:13:14.570 Keith Low OK, OK. 0:13:14.280 --> 0:13:14.720 Vincent Oon Yes, yes. 0:13:16.350 --> 0:13:22.900 Keith Low I think we when we come to that point, then we can decide I think right now just we can just focus on building the UI. 0:13:23.410 --> 0:13:24.20 Keith Low I think OK. 0:13:24.30 --> 0:13:26.20 Keith Low My next question is for you, Josh. 0:13:26.750 --> 0:13:32.380 Keith Low Unofficially, I heard from some colleague I know the new license name, Andrew description, but can you confirm?

Umm. 0:17:5.180 --> 0:17:5.450 Stephanie Jones Correct. 0:16:59.260 --> 0:17:15.610 Chris DiPierro And and yeah, business user, I think we said is kind of unlimited from a user, it’s usage perspective, but just for for Stephanie and Josh and Vincent’s benefit, when we started talking about this at an actual licensing level, I still like the, I don’t like the idea of having a flag that says that this is unlimited. 0:17:15.720 --> 0:17:21.450 Chris DiPierro So I think the way we would mainly because it creates a whole weird logic checks if you start doing that sort of thing. 0:17:21.450 --> 0:17:23.150 Stephanie Jones But like 1000 or something in there. 0:17:24.50 --> 0:17:24.170 Keith Low Yeah. 0:17:26.180 --> 0:17:26.340 Keith Low Yeah. 0:17:21.460 --> 0:17:27.230 Chris DiPierro So I still think the way we exactly, I think the way we really do it is like 10,000 or something ridiculous basically. 0:17:27.720 --> 0:17:28.220 Stephanie Jones OK. 0:17:27.240 --> 0:17:34.320 Chris DiPierro So it their view of the world would still say, hey, you know, you got 10,000 of these you provisioned, I don’t know, 100 or whatever. 0:17:34.330 --> 0:17:37.300 Chris DiPierro I’ve seen this by the way, in like Office 365 licensing. 0:17:37.310 --> 0:17:42.360 Chris DiPierro Anytime they give out something that’s quote unquote free, it’s like 9999 licenses. 0:17:42.370 --> 0:17:45.140 Chris DiPierro And I don’t think that’s gonna cause us a problem. 0:17:45.120 --> 0:17:45.290 Keith Low Yeah. 0:17:45.150 --> 0:17:45.650 Chris DiPierro Really. So. 0:17:46.320 --> 0:17:47.350 Keith Low OK, I think no issue. 0:17:47.80 --> 0:17:47.380 Stephanie Jones OK. 0:17:47.420 --> 0:17:53.140 Keith Low I think just to highlight this, because we are working with the UX team, uh. 0:17:53.150 --> 0:17:56.720 Keith Low I’m also giving you the TPO, we need to put this into the service. 0:17:56.830 --> 0:18:3.640 Keith Low So I think once it this is confirmed, I think Josh, maybe you can actually email me then I’ll let them know and they can actually put it in. 0:18:3.910 --> 0:18:7.140 Keith Low Because right now it’s a things are here from TPO. 0:18:7.150 --> 0:18:9.440 Keith Low I hear from all these are not confirmed. 0:18:8.680 --> 0:18:10.300 Chris DiPierro I still get a little concerned about this one. 0:18:10.310 --> 0:18:14.210 Chris DiPierro The Keith like, I mean at the end ultimately license types might change frequently, right? 0:18:14.300 --> 0:18:14.550 Keith Low Umm. 0:18:14.220 --> 0:18:21.470 Chris DiPierro Like they like audit and risk could decide to create like a 3 new license types tomorrow when they release version two or something like that. 0:18:21.480 --> 0:18:21.710 Chris DiPierro Right. 0:18:20.850 --> 0:18:21.790 Stephanie Jones They’ve been Oxley. 0:18:21.800 --> 0:18:23.300 Stephanie Jones Yeah, you have something. 0:18:21.720 --> 0:18:24.250 Chris DiPierro Like if they if they if they got new features. 0:18:24.440 --> 0:18:28.710 Chris DiPierro So however, it is that we’re doing it, we need this to be pretty flexible, right? 0:18:48.680 --> 0:18:48.930 Keith Low Umm. 0:18:28.720 --> 0:18:49.580 Chris DiPierro It can’t really be my preference would be anyway that it’s not like married to a version of the licensing service, but instead reads this data a bit more dynamically and that so that you know if there is an update on on audit and risk side that we can kind of be pretty responsive to that basically. 0:18:49.590 --> 0:18:51.570 Chris DiPierro So, you know, let’s design that. 0:18:52.60 --> 0:18:53.420 Keith Low OK. Yeah. 0:18:51.580 --> 0:18:54.380 Chris DiPierro However, it is that we need to design it, but like I don’t. 0:18:54.390 --> 0:19:0.240 Chris DiPierro I ideally it’s not hard coding all the licenses in their license types within like the licensing service, and they’re saying, well, great. 0:19:0.250 --> 0:19:2.780 Chris DiPierro It’s three months for us to put a new license to service out the door, right? So. 0:19:7.150 --> 0:19:7.310 Chris DiPierro Yeah. 0:19:2.970 --> 0:19:10.800 Keith Low Umm yeah, I think we could do it in in such a way that it could be an idea Gen admin that like, yeah, yeah. 0:19:8.550 --> 0:19:10.820 Chris DiPierro Because remember, we don’t really care much about it, right? 0:19:10.830 --> 0:19:15.780 Chris DiPierro Like the from from from a purely platform point of view, it’s a license name and description we don’t. 0:19:20.190 --> 0:19:20.370 Keith Low Yeah. 0:19:15.850 --> 0:19:27.800 Chris DiPierro There’s no implication to us about what that does, right, like so the amount of the amount of care we have to have around it is really just delivering the content of that in the appropriate spots, right? So. 0:19:27.630 --> 0:19:28.90 Keith Low Umm. 0:19:28.310 --> 0:19:29.110 Keith Low Yep, Yep. Movie. 0:19:31.150 --> 0:19:31.630 Keith Low Uh. 0:19:31.710 --> 0:19:34.380 Stephanie Jones OK, that’s what I’m confused by. 0:19:34.390 --> 0:19:37.280 Stephanie Jones OK, so we have so the the. 0:19:38.850 --> 0:19:39.160 Stephanie Jones OK. 0:19:39.170 --> 0:19:43.960 Stephanie Jones So for risk, we have standard or sorry essentials and professional. 0:19:44.10 --> 0:19:45.440 Stephanie Jones Those are the official names. 0:19:46.190 --> 0:19:54.260 Stephanie Jones Umm, now we haven’t really delivered enough risk functionality to to to to sell. 0:19:53.940 --> 0:19:55.700 Chris DiPierro Have been essentials and professional, yeah. 0:19:54.270 --> 0:19:57.640 Stephanie Jones You know, as essentials and professional. 0:19:57.650 --> 0:20:13.430 Stephanie Jones So right now, I guess they’re, I guess the default like we’re gonna give everyone essentials and then and then once they you know once we start to add the functionality then then we’ll be able to have that distinction same for the audit side essentials and professional. 0:20:13.480 --> 0:20:14.520 Stephanie Jones So there’s four. 0:20:15.150 --> 0:20:18.400 Stephanie Jones We talked about business users that that’s five. 0:20:18.610 --> 0:20:35.740 Stephanie Jones So that enterprise level or or, you know consolidated level, is that just you have is a separate license type required for that or well because every user has to have one license type right, they can’t have more than one license type, is that right? 0:20:35.150 --> 0:20:35.840 Chris DiPierro No, they’re gonna. 0:20:35.850 --> 0:20:37.380 Chris DiPierro No, they they can have more than one. 0:20:37.390 --> 0:20:38.140 Chris DiPierro Yeah, absolutely. 0:20:38.150 --> 0:20:38.870 Chris DiPierro They can have more than one. 0:20:39.950 --> 0:20:43.50 Stephanie Jones So do we give them a consolidated interval? 0:20:43.60 --> 0:20:44.160 Stephanie Jones I’ll just keep calling enterprise. 0:20:44.500 --> 0:20:44.690 Chris DiPierro Yeah. 0:20:44.170 --> 0:20:52.850 Stephanie Jones Do we give them an enterprise license type or do we give them both professional of risk and professional audit and say those two make up the fact that you’re an enterprise customer? 0:20:53.670 --> 0:20:59.140 Chris DiPierro I think this is more of a you question than ask question and the reason I say that is because what does enterprise mean in the future? 0:20:59.880 --> 0:21:5.400 Chris DiPierro Let let let’s say you introduce as you said, like a Sox license or something like that. 0:21:5.410 --> 0:21:9.240 Chris DiPierro Or, you know, whatever else would enterprise encompass all of that? 0:21:9.290 --> 0:21:14.720 Chris DiPierro Or would enterprise only mean risk pro and audit pro at that point, right. 0:21:14.790 --> 0:21:22.240 Chris DiPierro If enterprise is gonna perpetually mean, I have literally everything we ever released, then I think I would do it as a single license type. 0:21:23.360 --> 0:21:23.480 Joshua Haseldine Hey. 0:21:21.530 --> 0:21:24.0 Stephanie Jones Then this needs to be at home OK. 0:21:22.590 --> 0:21:29.500 Chris DiPierro If means I these two, but not this other one, then I would not have it as a license type. 0:21:29.510 --> 0:21:35.760 Chris DiPierro Then I would just say, yeah, no, we should just go onesies, you know, on on everything that they they need so. 0:21:37.390 --> 0:21:47.340 Joshua Haseldine Yeah, just to back of workers is saying that it it’s, it needs to be its own user because if we’re giving probes by border and risk, we don’t want them to give full system admin regardless. 0:21:50.880 --> 0:21:51.160 Stephanie Jones OK. 0:21:47.350 --> 0:21:53.40 Joshua Haseldine So it needs to be its own individual entity which that enterprise license would sort of. 0:21:55.230 --> 0:21:55.480 Chris DiPierro Umm. 0:21:53.250 --> 0:21:55.640 Joshua Haseldine It would fall under that, umm. 0:21:56.400 --> 0:21:56.570 Stephanie Jones That’s. 0:21:59.230 --> 0:21:59.490 Keith Low OK. 0:21:59.980 --> 0:22:0.260 Stephanie Jones OK. 0:22:0.270 --> 0:22:0.720 Stephanie Jones That’s helpful. 0:22:3.220 --> 0:22:5.250 Keith Low Umm, I don’t have anymore question. 0:22:5.260 --> 0:22:7.180 Keith Low I think anything that you would like to bring up. 0:22:8.80 --> 0:22:9.80 Chris DiPierro I’d like to talk about. 0:22:8.100 --> 0:22:9.670 Joshua Haseldine Can I hijack this? 0:22:9.900 --> 0:22:10.160 Keith Low I’m sorry. 0:22:9.920 --> 0:22:11.230 Joshua Haseldine Meeting uh, sorry, I got Chris. 0:22:11.280 --> 0:22:11.860 Joshua Haseldine No, I. 0:22:9.990 --> 0:22:12.920 Chris DiPierro Oh, sorry, I I wanted to hijack you for anything else. 0:22:12.930 --> 0:22:14.20 Chris DiPierro If Kotte, but you can go first. 0:22:14.750 --> 0:22:16.260 Joshua Haseldine Well, the thing I’m gonna talk about. 0:22:24.270 --> 0:22:24.420 Chris DiPierro And. 0:22:24.190 --> 0:22:24.440 Keith Low Umm. 0:22:16.270 --> 0:22:26.740 Joshua Haseldine I I’ve AI might pro came along the pigeon to and it’s about the audit trail and I I’m not. 0:22:41.870 --> 0:22:42.120 Chris DiPierro Umm. 0:22:26.750 --> 0:22:44.990 Joshua Haseldine I’m not sure if anyone’s sort of aware of an email that’s gone around this morning or last night, and from I just it was between development teams, between Enigma and the platform, but that was one of the issues that we’ve raised a few times. 0:22:45.240 --> 0:22:49.410 Joshua Haseldine I’m I’m basically there’s five issues I have. 0:22:50.390 --> 0:23:7.570 Joshua Haseldine Uh, that we’ve sort of stumbled across when we were when we built the audit trail that need to be addressed really before we can release this internally because they are, they’re holding us up in terms of like an audit trail format. 0:23:7.630 --> 0:23:10.10 Joshua Haseldine And so I have a list of five issues here. 0:23:10.260 --> 0:23:16.980 Joshua Haseldine I can either go through the five issues now or I can send him an email to both for yourself, Chris and yourself. 0:23:16.990 --> 0:23:18.310 Joshua Haseldine Keith, I’m. 0:23:18.570 --> 0:23:29.20 Joshua Haseldine But yeah, I think they might need a bit of a bump up over the list or, you know, just at least some form of address in I’m most. 0:23:28.90 --> 0:23:31.110 Chris DiPierro Yeah, I’m not sure, but either rest are gonna be able to answer your issues. 0:23:32.860 --> 0:23:34.120 Joshua Haseldine Well, yeah, no. 0:23:39.140 --> 0:23:40.920 Keith Low Yeah. Hmm. 0:23:31.120 --> 0:23:43.220 Chris DiPierro If you went through them here and necessarily I did see an A note from JK that he said change log issue which would be audit trail that owed in the Heimdall, we’re looking into it need to identify root cause and decide on how to fix it. 0:23:45.800 --> 0:23:46.0 Keith Low Yeah. 0:23:43.230 --> 0:23:46.930 Chris DiPierro But that’s as much as I’ve got on it at the moment. So. 0:23:47.770 --> 0:23:48.130 Joshua Haseldine OK. 0:23:47.180 --> 0:23:49.570 Keith Low Yeah, I think that’s not before 6. 0:23:49.580 --> 0:23:51.270 Keith Low I also spoke to the TP U. 0:23:51.540 --> 0:24:1.970 Keith Low He he was telling me someone in Honda is actually looking at it and I think they contacted some some Dev in in Arc team and got some information to test it out so. 0:24:1.720 --> 0:24:2.830 Joshua Haseldine Yeah, but it doesn’t. 0:24:2.840 --> 0:24:11.210 Joshua Haseldine It the response given is basically asking us to change the audit trail log to something that we don’t want to do. 0:24:19.660 --> 0:24:19.850 Chris DiPierro Umm. 0:24:12.580 --> 0:24:20.790 Joshua Haseldine It’s it’s basically asking us to change to a a link and unlink service instead of an updated format which we’re trying to move into cause that’s how art needs to be. 0:24:21.680 --> 0:24:25.170 Joshua Haseldine So like I said, I’ll forward this, I’ll forward all these questions over to you too. 0:24:28.680 --> 0:24:28.840 Chris DiPierro Sure. 0:24:25.580 --> 0:24:41.570 Joshua Haseldine But the big two highlights and two ones I really wanna just gal there are the write update which I think is being fixed and it’s being released as like in this upcoming fix like mid May I think is when it’s due. 0:24:44.170 --> 0:24:44.450 Chris DiPierro Uh. 0:24:43.470 --> 0:24:44.950 Joshua Haseldine Am I correct? 0:24:44.960 --> 0:24:47.60 Joshua Haseldine It basically doesn’t allow you to put a null value in. 0:24:48.60 --> 0:24:48.220 Chris DiPierro Yeah. 0:24:47.940 --> 0:24:49.750 Joshua Haseldine I don’t know if if that means anything. 0:24:49.0 --> 0:24:50.230 Chris DiPierro Uh, sorry, I don’t. 0:24:50.240 --> 0:24:52.280 Chris DiPierro I don’t know the features at that level of detail. 0:24:53.470 --> 0:24:54.420 Joshua Haseldine No, that’s fine. 0:24:52.290 --> 0:24:54.920 Chris DiPierro Yeah, but but I can look into it so. 0:24:54.600 --> 0:24:57.160 Joshua Haseldine That’s fine and and the second thing is the reperforming. 0:25:0.570 --> 0:25:0.780 Chris DiPierro Umm. 0:24:57.170 --> 0:25:0.980 Joshua Haseldine Once that is huge to us, really. 0:25:2.860 --> 0:25:7.750 Joshua Haseldine Basically yeah, the the performance of when we have like just like a records say 100 plus. 0:25:11.540 --> 0:25:11.780 Chris DiPierro Right. 0:25:7.760 --> 0:25:17.330 Joshua Haseldine It just goes to a crawl and it’s taking 20 seconds a page and I can’t get the green light on an audit trail for performance where it’s taking 20 seconds of page. 0:25:17.860 --> 0:25:19.250 Joshua Haseldine So the read performance? 0:25:19.500 --> 0:25:21.160 Joshua Haseldine Yeah, realistically need to be addressed. 0:25:26.230 --> 0:25:26.400 Chris DiPierro Yep. 0:25:21.200 --> 0:25:29.190 Joshua Haseldine However, let me send you this list, and if you can get back to me as soon as because, but you get like said, I can’t do 1.21 Toe. 0:25:29.260 --> 0:25:30.680 Joshua Haseldine This has been alerted. 0:25:30.570 --> 0:25:30.870 Keith Low Umm. 0:25:31.960 --> 0:25:32.730 Chris DiPierro Yeah, that’s fine. 0:25:33.20 --> 0:25:33.650 Chris DiPierro Yeah, send it. 0:25:33.660 --> 0:25:35.930 Chris DiPierro Send it over and Keith, can you? 0:25:38.170 --> 0:25:38.350 Keith Low Yeah. 0:25:40.710 --> 0:25:40.970 Keith Low Sure. 0:25:36.240 --> 0:25:41.640 Chris DiPierro You know, get clarity on on all all all of Joshua stuff with the teams, so. 0:25:42.130 --> 0:25:44.800 Joshua Haseldine So I’m yeah, brilliant. 0:25:44.810 --> 0:25:45.290 Joshua Haseldine Thank you. 0:25:45.360 --> 0:25:46.60 Joshua Haseldine Go on, Chris. 0:25:46.70 --> 0:25:47.50 Joshua Haseldine Yeah, I’ll let you hijack it now. 0:25:46.750 --> 0:25:48.330 Chris DiPierro Yeah, sure. 0:25:49.140 --> 0:25:55.960 Chris DiPierro So back during Genesis, a question can’t was raised from the support team that was along the lines of how do we support this? 0:25:56.210 --> 0:25:57.50 Chris DiPierro Yeah. 0:25:57.190 --> 0:26:12.110 Chris DiPierro And that kind of led to the question of specifically, uh, are there the note is there the notion of like, user grants right, like can Support kinda act as a user within an instance to go see things and support and stuff like that? 0:26:12.220 --> 0:26:18.770 Chris DiPierro I don’t know exactly how Support has handled pentana in the past, but I’m gonna guess that that’s kind of what is influencing some of these questions, right? 0:26:18.780 --> 0:26:20.240 Chris DiPierro Like what do we do? 0:26:20.750 --> 0:26:25.600 Chris DiPierro Umm, the implication for platform was more around the identity side, right? 0:26:32.390 --> 0:26:32.670 Stephanie Jones Right. 0:26:25.610 --> 0:26:32.880 Chris DiPierro Like so, are we baking in like some sort of support admin user that people can use and you know, what do we go about doing with that kind of stuff? 0:26:32.920 --> 0:26:36.60 Chris DiPierro But this, but this felt bigger than just arc. 0:26:36.150 --> 0:26:37.320 Chris DiPierro So I said, you know what? 0:26:37.700 --> 0:26:37.980 Stephanie Jones Umm. 0:26:37.330 --> 0:26:38.300 Chris DiPierro I’m gonna go talk to Muna. 0:26:38.350 --> 0:26:38.820 Chris DiPierro Let’s go. 0:26:38.830 --> 0:26:41.660 Chris DiPierro Let’s go talk about how Support wants to do this in general, right? 0:26:41.670 --> 0:26:45.880 Chris DiPierro Like in as we have new products, we offer them to platform. 0:26:46.210 --> 0:26:46.960 Chris DiPierro What? 0:26:47.130 --> 0:27:6.500 Chris DiPierro How should support approach these sort of things and you know dealing with tenant instances and stuff like that and I can reflect his view and then you can tell me why this is probably more purist than I’m gonna guess our support wants to hear but, but let’s just talk about it from a high level. 0:27:7.970 --> 0:27:13.830 Chris DiPierro Muniz View is Support should never be able to interact in a production environment. 0:27:13.880 --> 0:27:14.330 Chris DiPierro Ever. 0:27:14.430 --> 0:27:14.830 Chris DiPierro Period. 0:27:14.880 --> 0:27:17.50 Chris DiPierro Not not in no way. Right. 0:27:17.60 --> 0:27:46.80 Chris DiPierro No grants ever to a production environment in a QA or, you know, state or whatever environment what his ideal solution is, is that there can be a Support admin user that is essentially always locked out at something, but the tenant admin can provide, can essentially unlock out that account for a given time period based on a request. 0:27:46.90 --> 0:27:50.80 Chris DiPierro So in other words, Support says I wanna access your staging environment. 0:27:50.340 --> 0:27:54.970 Chris DiPierro Let’s just say Joshua customer Josh, I want to access your stating environment to help you with this support ticket. 0:27:55.600 --> 0:28:2.690 Chris DiPierro You go into an advent somewhere and you say, great, Chris, I’m granting you access to the staging environment for the next 24 hours or whatever it is. 0:28:2.980 --> 0:28:9.930 Chris DiPierro And then Support uses a common account there to log into that staging environment and do whatever it is that they might need to do. 0:28:10.200 --> 0:28:21.540 Chris DiPierro However, and this was a big one, he was very clear that even in the context of that staging environment or whatever, that the support team should never be able to see any of your data, they should only be able to see metadata. 0:28:21.550 --> 0:28:42.740 Chris DiPierro They can’t see like actual audit records or whatever it might be, and whatever product that we’re talking about, they could see things like workflows and configurations and whatever, but he doesn’t want them to actually be able to see any data that you recorded in in there that bit, uh, sounds more like a requirement on ARC than it does on platform. 0:28:42.750 --> 0:28:43.60 Chris DiPierro Right. 0:28:43.70 --> 0:28:50.380 Chris DiPierro Let’s just imagine that platform could provide this notion of unlocking an account for a certain amount of time or whatever for support to use. 0:28:50.530 --> 0:29:21.990 Chris DiPierro Presumably that user would have some sort of permission associated with it that then arc would need to enforce, not showing any actual records to basically once they once they logged in at that point I kind of asked the question of doesn’t support sometimes like actually need to really see data to be able to answer a question and his response to that was if it really comes down to that then that should all be done with screen shares with the customer after ensuring an NDA is in place and all that kind of stuff. 0:29:22.0 --> 0:29:26.550 Chris DiPierro But it should never be a thing that supports able to do unmonitored essentially so. 0:29:26.780 --> 0:29:45.200 Chris DiPierro So I don’t know how that compares with the current Support process within like our products, if that’s maybe it’s maybe you already doing all that but but sounds sounded very good from a compliance perspective, but also a bit restrictive in what Support might be able to to do this solve problems. 0:29:45.210 --> 0:29:51.960 Chris DiPierro So just kind of curious how that that messes with what you guys are expecting, OK. 0:29:48.850 --> 0:30:2.410 Vincent Oon I can I can answer that because it’s just done the internal audit with the support team, the level 1 support, the level 2 support in KL and also we spoke with the support in UK or so. 0:30:2.480 --> 0:30:12.970 Vincent Oon So basically they do have access to the customer data environment in the current current practice and they do share the single admin account through LastPass. 0:30:13.180 --> 0:30:14.820 Vincent Oon So that’s how they do it. 0:30:16.370 --> 0:30:16.580 Chris DiPierro Umm. 0:30:14.880 --> 0:30:25.810 Vincent Oon Do it so I don’t understand why there’s a concern now for for the new product that doesn’t allow them to see the actual customer data because that’s how the other product doing also. 0:30:25.740 --> 0:30:26.110 Chris DiPierro Yeah. 0:30:26.120 --> 0:30:30.890 Chris DiPierro And and and and just to be clear, it’s not so much that it’s a concern for the new products, right? 0:30:30.950 --> 0:30:32.190 Chris DiPierro Moon is kind of new in the company. 0:30:32.200 --> 0:30:37.110 Chris DiPierro He’s saying this is how I think Support should should run and he has a Salesforce background right? 0:30:37.120 --> 0:30:37.940 Chris DiPierro It comes from Salesforce. 0:30:37.950 --> 0:30:38.910 Chris DiPierro This is kind of how they did it. 0:30:38.920 --> 0:30:51.560 Chris DiPierro Salesforce from one end stand, I think his big emphasis was on maturity as a company, basically in part because different geographies have different regulations for this kind of stuff, right? 0:30:51.640 --> 0:30:52.90 Chris DiPierro Then what? 0:30:52.100 --> 0:30:58.470 Chris DiPierro He is kind of trying to outline is like what is the what would cover us in the most situations. Right. 0:30:58.560 --> 0:31:9.670 Chris DiPierro You know what is the EU allow versus the US versus UK versus whatever and like the most restrictive thing that you can do clearly is to not ever let a third party have access to any records, right? 0:31:10.100 --> 0:31:14.110 Chris DiPierro So I don’t think it’s like, why is this a concern when we previously done this. 0:31:14.120 --> 0:31:24.890 Chris DiPierro I think this is more like this is a standard that he’s looking to set and the reason why I think it’s applicable mostly to like a new product you guys is because we don’t really have a standard set, right? 0:31:25.50 --> 0:31:31.580 Chris DiPierro Just because we did something in pentana or whatever in the past doesn’t mean we necessarily wanna do the same thing in the brand new platform. 0:31:32.880 --> 0:31:33.200 Stephanie Jones Right. 0:31:31.670 --> 0:31:34.460 Chris DiPierro I ideally I and and and and and. 0:31:34.470 --> 0:31:36.640 Chris DiPierro You know, again, this is a very idealistic view. 0:31:36.710 --> 0:31:44.960 Chris DiPierro Ideally, if we start with the standard, it’s easier to continue it than it is to start below the standard and then try to raise ourselves up to it in the future, right? 0:31:44.970 --> 0:31:53.900 Chris DiPierro If Support gets used to have an access to like production environment and that’s how they’re solving all the problems, and then you tell them well, now you can’t do that anymore and that’s going to be very disruptive. 0:31:53.910 --> 0:32:1.990 Chris DiPierro But if you start it out that way and then you could hopefully create processes around that going forward. 0:32:2.0 --> 0:32:9.540 Chris DiPierro So and don’t get me wrong, I understand the the the idealistic versus practical here a little bit. 0:32:9.550 --> 0:32:16.920 Chris DiPierro I understand that what I’ve described as is very much in the idealistic side of of the world, but it is very clean hands right? 0:32:16.930 --> 0:32:19.900 Chris DiPierro Like if any auditor came to us any you know? 0:32:20.810 --> 0:32:29.670 Chris DiPierro Uh anybody was looking at us from a standards perspective and we could truly say that, yeah, Support and never sees product and never sees your data at all and never has access to your production instance. 0:32:32.790 --> 0:32:32.890 Vincent Oon Yes. 0:32:29.680 --> 0:32:37.280 Chris DiPierro That’s a really great message, 100% right, whether we could actually do that and solve people’s problems. 0:32:37.290 --> 0:32:37.760 Chris DiPierro I don’t know. 0:32:37.770 --> 0:32:46.570 Chris DiPierro That’s where it’s not quite my side of the world, but like, I just kind of wanted to report back on, like, kind of what I got from him. 0:32:46.610 --> 0:33:3.950 Chris DiPierro I think from an identity perspective, from a platform perspective, I think the notion of being able to grab a special kind of user, if you will support user access for a certain period of time based on a request absolutely seems like a thing that we should be able to support going forward on our identity side of things. 0:33:4.700 --> 0:33:15.200 Chris DiPierro Whether that is how clearly doesn’t exist now, so whether that’s a thing that support could you know a model that support could actually use at the moment? 0:33:15.210 --> 0:33:23.320 Chris DiPierro Well, probably not clearly, but I think that is very clean from a where we go identity wise in the future. 0:33:24.240 --> 0:33:28.920 Vincent Oon It’s just want to raise one thing is that there are sometimes the Support need to. 0:33:30.970 --> 0:33:32.0 Vincent Oon Need to have the data? 0:33:32.10 --> 0:33:44.320 Vincent Oon That’s because the customer saying that they are seeing the wrong thing and then they need the exact data view to make sure that they can reproduce that error and that customer view is being corrected on that. 0:33:44.270 --> 0:33:44.920 Chris DiPierro Yeah. 0:33:44.690 --> 0:33:45.810 Vincent Oon That query that they. 0:33:45.20 --> 0:33:49.920 Chris DiPierro Well and and and and and and again when I pushed on that like what he said was like fine. 0:33:50.160 --> 0:33:57.300 Chris DiPierro The customer is driving and screen sharing basically, but not that if support is just accessing it on their own right so. 0:34:1.680 --> 0:34:3.310 Chris DiPierro Hey again, you know, I know. 0:34:2.510 --> 0:34:4.990 Stephanie Jones Yeah, I don’t know how you would how you solve support. 0:34:8.150 --> 0:34:14.290 Stephanie Jones Was just going to say, I don’t know, you still Support issues without like seeing what is happening, you know. 0:34:15.260 --> 0:34:19.870 Stephanie Jones But I so Chris, are you asking like how we support that? 0:34:19.880 --> 0:34:20.470 Stephanie Jones Like what? 0:34:20.500 --> 0:34:20.840 Chris DiPierro Well. 0:34:20.480 --> 0:34:22.440 Stephanie Jones But how would audit and risk support that? 0:34:23.250 --> 0:34:26.140 Chris DiPierro I I think I’m not really necessarily. 0:34:27.920 --> 0:34:29.870 Chris DiPierro I guess I’m trying to figure out exactly what I’m saying here. 0:34:29.880 --> 0:34:32.10 Chris DiPierro I think what I’m saying is I don’t. 0:34:32.20 --> 0:34:41.370 Chris DiPierro I think we would be hesitant on the platform side to build something that is more liberal than what we’re described. 0:34:41.380 --> 0:34:46.910 Chris DiPierro If that is the expected standards that the support team wants to hold themselves to in the future, right? 0:34:46.980 --> 0:34:51.910 Chris DiPierro Like like I think one of the questions kind of came up very specifically in arc is like in a production instance. 0:34:51.920 --> 0:35:0.490 Chris DiPierro Do we always provision like a support user if you will an idea Gen an admin user that you guys can that support can access and go do things in right? 0:35:0.600 --> 0:35:0.940 Chris DiPierro Umm. 0:35:1.560 --> 0:35:20.960 Chris DiPierro And if we did like JK brought up some of the challenges that that Intel’s with it, like not showing that user in list of users and things like that right like where you might assign records and that that kind of stuff well kind of the guidance that I hear from essentially they had a support is like no we shouldn’t be doing that right? 0:35:20.970 --> 0:35:24.470 Chris DiPierro We shouldn’t be provisioned automatically provisioning a production user. 0:35:24.560 --> 0:35:27.710 Chris DiPierro We should be being a bit restrictive on that, right? 0:35:27.860 --> 0:35:39.830 Chris DiPierro So I think what happened is I you know what I don’t know if that’s a big change in how your support team intends to support this product or not. 0:35:39.870 --> 0:35:42.440 Chris DiPierro If it’s not, then I don’t know that there is a whole lot of take away in this. 0:35:42.450 --> 0:35:55.490 Chris DiPierro And then just to confirm that that’s what we’re gonna do, if it if it is a big change, then I think there needs to be some conversations on the support side of things of saying like well, look, that’s not gonna work for our world. 0:35:55.900 --> 0:35:56.70 Vincent Oon Good. 0:35:55.500 --> 0:35:57.20 Chris DiPierro We need to do something different, right? So. 0:35:59.510 --> 0:36:1.640 Stephanie Jones Yeah, it does sound like a bigger conversation. 0:36:4.240 --> 0:36:5.60 Chris DiPierro Yeah, yeah, sure. 0:36:1.650 --> 0:36:9.940 Stephanie Jones I don’t wanna speak on behalf of support because I don’t know if they even are aware that that we’re even having this discussion. 0:36:11.30 --> 0:36:11.460 Chris DiPierro Well, we’re. 0:36:11.470 --> 0:36:12.360 Chris DiPierro We’re they, they. 0:36:12.370 --> 0:36:13.580 Chris DiPierro They asked about user grants, right? 0:36:9.950 --> 0:36:15.380 Stephanie Jones Well, actually they are because they said how will we access but not about the data, yeah. 0:36:13.590 --> 0:36:16.80 Chris DiPierro Like, that’s where this all initially kind of came from, right? So. 0:36:23.240 --> 0:36:23.440 Chris DiPierro Umm. 0:36:16.620 --> 0:36:23.530 Vincent Oon Please this on my discussion with the the other team in the support for the other product, not just audit and risk. 0:36:29.10 --> 0:36:29.230 Chris DiPierro Umm. 0:36:23.600 --> 0:36:31.880 Vincent Oon They are practice also the for the support team doesn’t have access to the production, they only access to the liar production light system. 0:36:40.420 --> 0:36:40.630 Chris DiPierro Umm. 0:36:44.530 --> 0:36:46.210 Chris DiPierro To the to the staging environment or yeah. 0:36:51.660 --> 0:36:51.840 Chris DiPierro Umm. 0:36:57.600 --> 0:36:57.780 Chris DiPierro Sure. 0:36:33.310 --> 0:37:0.860 Vincent Oon That’s for troubleshooting only, but if there’s a circumstances where they need to test on the data, the data will be copied over to the production line environment for temporary basis with the help from I think technical services team or the car off team and and then after that that data will be deleted from from, from that environment, from the environment means they will never have access to the live system. 0:37:0.870 --> 0:37:3.150 Vincent Oon So I think your suggestion makes sense to me. 0:37:3.900 --> 0:37:4.630 Vincent Oon It should work. 0:37:4.570 --> 0:37:7.400 Chris DiPierro Yeah, the the never has access to the live system part. 0:37:7.410 --> 0:37:8.830 Chris DiPierro That’s probably the easier bit. 0:37:9.40 --> 0:37:12.710 Chris DiPierro The doesn’t have access to any customer data. 0:37:12.920 --> 0:37:17.750 Chris DiPierro Part is almost certainly the harder part of it, right is, I think if we’re being realistic about it so. 0:37:19.350 --> 0:37:19.570 Vincent Oon Yeah. 0:37:22.320 --> 0:37:22.540 Chris DiPierro OK. 0:37:25.70 --> 0:37:25.680 Chris DiPierro Yeah. 0:37:19.580 --> 0:37:26.90 Vincent Oon Yeah, that’s how the other product doing, uh, they they get technical services or cause teams move the data. 0:37:26.50 --> 0:37:36.920 Chris DiPierro And and and and and and and maybe that’s the compromise for the time being, but I think Support needs to make sure that that’s OK with, you know up there Tan with, with with policies and that kind of stuff. 0:37:36.930 --> 0:37:42.540 Chris DiPierro I think that you know, the Vincent, the inherent risk in that there’s definitely less risk clearly, right. 0:37:42.550 --> 0:37:48.280 Chris DiPierro But the inherent risk there is you’re still copying production data over to a staging environment, and then you’re given access to a third party. 0:37:48.410 --> 0:37:50.390 Chris DiPierro That third party could go do something with that data, right? 0:37:50.400 --> 0:37:53.0 Chris DiPierro They could go leak that data somewhere or whatever, right? 0:37:53.10 --> 0:38:1.140 Chris DiPierro So I think in the absolute purists sense, the answer of not being able to see any of the customers data is a good one. 0:38:1.420 --> 0:38:3.600 Chris DiPierro But yeah, I understand the practicalities of it. 0:38:3.650 --> 0:38:17.530 Chris DiPierro If if that’s what support needs to do, then I just think they need to make sure that they Firefly that with their whatever new processes that they’re trying to roll out, you know business wise and that kind of stuff to make sure that that that is consistent with that. 0:38:22.580 --> 0:38:30.270 Vincent Oon I think there are also uh practiced where the data is mass means that maybe they will hide the sensitive data or change. 0:38:29.500 --> 0:38:30.290 Chris DiPierro Yeah, maybe. 0:38:30.460 --> 0:38:31.510 Vincent Oon Yeah, change it to. 0:38:30.940 --> 0:38:45.810 Chris DiPierro But but but that that that sounds like a feature that probably, you know, internal audit and risk management needs to support if there’s going to be some sort of masking of data based on like user permission set right then that would be something that you guys would need to to implement under the covers there so. 0:38:54.560 --> 0:38:54.810 Chris DiPierro Umm. 0:38:56.830 --> 0:38:57.300 Chris DiPierro Yeah. 0:38:47.890 --> 0:38:58.380 Vincent Oon Yeah, it means that the that data can be imported to, to to the Support environment, but they will not see the the real data the real completed. 0:38:57.350 --> 0:39:14.10 Chris DiPierro Anyway, look again, purely from a platform interaction with our perspective, I think what what what I’m saying is we’re in my opinion supportive of the notion of creating this kind of support User going forward in the future and identity services that can be unlocked for based on requests. 0:39:14.20 --> 0:39:17.830 Chris DiPierro I think that is a thing that we absolutely need to support on the platform side of things. 0:39:18.70 --> 0:39:26.540 Chris DiPierro If it How at you know as definitely none of the US are qualified on this call to answer, have support really needs to actually operate with the new products. 0:39:26.550 --> 0:39:29.880 Chris DiPierro But I just wanna suggest that we’re not gonna go. 0:39:35.230 --> 0:39:35.430 Stephanie Jones Yeah. 0:39:29.890 --> 0:39:37.740 Chris DiPierro Just be super permissive about this without kind of getting a little bit more clarity from from like a above that support team, right? So. 0:39:40.190 --> 0:39:40.470 Stephanie Jones OK. 0:39:45.330 --> 0:39:47.820 Chris DiPierro Sorry Josh for hijacking the last 20 minutes. 0:39:48.790 --> 0:39:49.780 Joshua Haseldine I don’t worry. 0:39:49.790 --> 0:39:51.240 Joshua Haseldine I have another question. 0:39:53.60 --> 0:39:53.220 Chris DiPierro Yeah. 0:39:55.410 --> 0:39:56.50 Chris DiPierro Yeah, I think so. 0:39:51.250 --> 0:40:9.470 Joshua Haseldine I just wanted to let you, Chris, sorry if if we finished on this by the way, cool, I I wanna talk about our Lord and Savior Gainsight and the timings and game site E because I am getting pushed back from the business that it. 0:40:13.280 --> 0:40:13.480 Chris DiPierro OK. 0:40:15.490 --> 0:40:15.640 Chris DiPierro Yeah. 0:40:16.10 --> 0:40:23.250 Joshua Haseldine And it was always stuck in a bit of a an issue where we we need some stuff from platform. 0:40:25.380 --> 0:40:27.230 Joshua Haseldine I think I’ve had a great discussion with this about you. 0:40:27.300 --> 0:40:30.700 Joshua Haseldine I can get the email up if I remember but. 0:40:29.420 --> 0:40:31.550 Chris DiPierro Yeah, I mean, so, so. 0:40:31.620 --> 0:40:39.390 Chris DiPierro So the thing you need for a given tenant basically is what’s called the idea of the Gen application ID, right? 0:40:39.460 --> 0:40:42.80 Chris DiPierro And right now the platform service is just don’t provide that. 0:40:39.950 --> 0:40:42.290 Joshua Haseldine Umm, that was it? 0:40:42.300 --> 0:40:42.710 Joshua Haseldine Yeah. 0:40:42.750 --> 0:40:43.0 Joshua Haseldine Thank you. 0:40:42.180 --> 0:40:48.70 Chris DiPierro We’ve got it on our road map to be able to provide that, but yeah, they just don’t. 0:40:48.120 --> 0:40:55.840 Chris DiPierro So right now, if you wanted to implement game site, really what you would need to do is just kind of stash that information on a per tenant basis like somewhere else, right? 0:40:55.850 --> 0:40:57.690 Chris DiPierro And I don’t have a good answer to you. 0:40:57.700 --> 0:40:58.60 Chris DiPierro Like what? 0:40:58.70 --> 0:41:8.480 Chris DiPierro The somewhere else is, but certainly I think we can talk with Nige about potentially, but if you, if you could just, if you could do that, then you could absolutely enable PX at that point. 0:41:10.30 --> 0:41:10.350 Joshua Haseldine OK. 0:41:12.630 --> 0:41:13.590 Joshua Haseldine OK so. 0:41:15.930 --> 0:41:17.650 Chris DiPierro I think in in the what? 0:41:12.90 --> 0:41:18.270 Stephanie Jones So it would have to be in the platform itself, not coming from platform services. 0:41:19.450 --> 0:41:31.100 Chris DiPierro Well, in, in in the longer term, yeah, it really should just come from like our provisioning services or our platform services like really what should happen, you know in, in Paul Martin typical UI of the future. 0:41:31.290 --> 0:41:37.160 Chris DiPierro One of the things that he should have to enter is the idea agent application ID for this tenant. 0:41:37.710 --> 0:41:40.100 Chris DiPierro That should then be stored somewhere in. 0:41:40.170 --> 0:41:45.40 Chris DiPierro However, it is that we deploy that and by the way, when I say store, I don’t even really cut a node. 0:41:45.50 --> 0:41:57.150 Chris DiPierro The technology behind there, Keith, but basically one new button press there that should either you know be sent as part of the message that we send to the ARC products or whatever, whatever it is at that point. 0:41:57.160 --> 0:42:5.960 Chris DiPierro But it should really be done at that probably at that point I would guess it would probably still be on Arctic store it somewhere at that point. 0:42:5.970 --> 0:42:12.120 Chris DiPierro What once the provisioning is is is done, you can make an argument about being able to change this in the future. 0:42:12.130 --> 0:42:13.140 Chris DiPierro It’s not supposed to change. 0:42:13.150 --> 0:42:18.660 Chris DiPierro Just FYI, like once it’s just established for a given tenant for a given product, does it really shouldn’t. 0:42:18.670 --> 0:42:25.260 Chris DiPierro But presumably if it did change somewhere, we probably need a process to be able to modify it from there. 0:42:25.350 --> 0:42:32.860 Chris DiPierro But yeah, right now we just, this is not a thing that we provide at provisioning time, but we we do need to make that change going forward. 0:42:32.870 --> 0:42:36.820 Chris DiPierro But if you wanna implement PX ahead of that, I think you absolutely could so. 0:42:47.420 --> 0:42:47.600 Chris DiPierro OK. 0:42:37.600 --> 0:42:51.460 Joshua Haseldine Ah, OK I the reason I ask is I got pushback that we don’t think we can do the I’m storing at the info on our and I I’ve got. 0:42:51.470 --> 0:42:54.770 Joshua Haseldine I’ve had a few devs just to take a quick look at it and it’s it. 0:43:3.190 --> 0:43:3.430 Chris DiPierro Yeah. 0:43:3.440 --> 0:43:5.220 Chris DiPierro I mean it’s like 1 string. 0:42:54.780 --> 0:43:5.280 Joshua Haseldine It’s definitely not easy as my point, like there’s doubt, whether we could actually do it and I would have to jump through a lot of hoops. 0:43:5.230 --> 0:43:8.920 Chris DiPierro I assume you’ve got a database back and stuff in ARC somewhere, right?

Bye. 0:47:49.960 --> 0:47:50.160 Chris DiPierro Right. here’s a detailed breakdown of the discussion points, organized by topic: 1. Licensing: Expiration and Grace Period: The licensing service will undoubtedly include expiration functionality, allowing licenses to expire after a set period. A configurable grace period will be implemented after license expiration, with a default setting of 30 days for MVP. This allows continued product usage for a limited time while renewal is addressed. To encourage timely renewals and prevent misuse, assigning new licenses will be blocked during the grace period. Existing users with active licenses can continue using the product. License Types: The platform offers flexibility by supporting any required license type without imposing limitations. This accommodates the evolving needs of ARC and its various modules. License descriptions can be provided to clarify the features and functionalities associated with each license type, ensuring transparency for users. The following license types are confirmed for implementation: Essentials & Professional (Audit & Risk): These license types offer varying levels of access and features within the Audit and Risk modules. Business User: This license type caters to users who require broader access across the platform, with a significantly high user limit (e.g., 10,000) instead of an unlimited allocation. Enterprise (potential rename): This license type encompasses all features and functionalities across the platform, granting comprehensive access. However, the naming is under review due to potential misinterpretations regarding company size. The technical implementation of “unlimited users” for the Business User license type is impractical. Therefore, a high user limit will be set instead. Given the potential for frequent changes in license types due to product updates and evolving needs, the platform should be designed with flexibility in mind. This includes dynamic updates and mechanisms to easily incorporate new license types. License Reduction: Scenarios where license counts are reduced upon renewal (e.g., from 10 to 5) pose a challenge for user deprovisioning. Identifying which specific users to deprovision is not feasible within the system. To address this, the system will trigger notifications to both the account manager and tenant admin, alerting them to the discrepancy and prompting action. In cases where the number of provisioned users consistently exceeds the available licenses despite notifications, escalating the issue to the Hydrogen team (responsible for account management) may be necessary. The system will implement a mechanism for frequent notifications if such discrepancies are detected, ensuring awareness and prompting corrective action. 2. Provisioning: Provisioning UI: Currently, user provisioning relies on manual API calls executed by the CloudOps team. This process can be cumbersome and prone to inconsistencies. To improve efficiency and standardize provisioning, a dedicated UI is planned for development. This interface will streamline the process and reduce the technical expertise required for user management. The responsibility for user provisioning after the UI implementation remains under discussion. Potential candidates include the CloudOps team, Level 1 support personnel, or other relevant teams. A decision will be made based on factors such as workload distribution and expertise. As part of the provisioning process, the UI should capture the ideaGen application ID for each tenant. This ID is crucial for integration with Gainsight and potentially other systems. 3. Support Access: Concerns & Ideal Standards: Granting Support access to production environments and sensitive customer data raises significant concerns regarding compliance, security, and data privacy. To mitigate these risks, the ideal standard is to completely restrict Support access to production environments. In staging environments, access should be limited to metadata (e.g., configurations, workflows) and not actual customer data. This access should only be granted after a specific request and approval by the tenant admin, ensuring control and transparency. For troubleshooting scenarios where data access is unavoidable, screen sharing with the customer in control is the preferred approach. This allows Support to observe the issue while minimizing data exposure. Current Practices & Challenges: In some existing products, Support teams currently have access to production environments and customer data, often using shared admin accounts. This practice is inconsistent with the desired security standards and presents potential risks. Support teams have expressed concerns about the ability to effectively troubleshoot and resolve customer issues without access to data. Reproducing specific scenarios and identifying root causes may require data visibility. Transitioning from current practices to the ideal standard will require significant adjustments and process changes for Support teams. This includes adapting troubleshooting techniques and adopting new tools for data-less issue resolution. Potential Solutions: Implement a system of temporary access grants to staging environments where sensitive data is masked or anonymized. This allows Support to investigate issues without compromising data privacy. Explore the creation of a dedicated Support User role with limited permissions and time-bound access to specific environments. This approach offers more control and auditability compared to shared admin accounts. Open communication and collaboration with Support teams are crucial to understand their needs and challenges. This will allow for the development of solutions that balance security requirements with practical considerations for effective support delivery. 4. Additional Notes: Audit Trail Issues: Josh highlighted specific issues encountered with the audit trail functionality, specifically the inability to handle null values and performance concerns when dealing with large datasets. These issues need to be addressed before the audit trail can be deemed production-ready. The team will investigate and determine the appropriate solutions. Gainsight & ideaGen application ID: Josh inquired about the feasibility of Gainsight implementation given the current lack of support for the ideaGen application ID within platform services. Storing this ID within the ARC system may be a temporary workaround until platform services can provide it directly during provisioning. Connectivity Issues: Stephanie faced internet connectivity problems during the meeting, which impacted audio quality and participation. Addressing these connectivity issues is important for ensuring effective communication and collaboration in future meetings.

For this purpose (Bron 1968, p. 237) the International was to be destroyed once and for all, almost as a preventive measure. The law of 14 March 1872 already made mere membership a punishable offence. Reforms of the world oflabour, for it was difficult to dispute that reforms were necessary, were to be decided upon out of Christian charity: The ban on child labour in 1874 was almost as ineffective as the earlier one of 1841. The newly introduced factory inspectors were often accompanied on their inspections by factory owners (Weiss 1936, p. 83; quoted in Schöttler 1982, p. 45). The Commune had not attacked the factory owners, but the repression made them victors, nevertheless. In spite of this, there was a renewed strike movement as early as 1871, and in the provinces new workers’ associations were founded as early as 1872, mostly in the form of mutual support associations. At the end of the 1870s, new national associations were founded. In 1880 the convicted communards were pardoned. Part of the post-revolutionary strategy of integrating the working class into the existing order was the reform of the Prud’hommes courts, which was adopted in 1884. The parity of the composition of these arbitration courts, introduced in 1848, which had been revoked in the Second Empire, was reinstated. And when in some places these new provisions were circumvented, the parliament announced that the arbitration courts could make decisions without the presence of the entrepreneurial representatives (Loubière 1975, pp. 232ff., quoted in Schöttler 1982, p. 50). When the Bourse de Travail was founded in Paris in 1887 as a trade union employment agency, an institution to represent workers’ interests had been created. Over the following decades, both the strategies pursued by the Bourse de Travail and those of its opponents changed. While the employment agency was initially operated by and large autonomously, but also had little influence, in the 1890s it became more influential, but at the same time increasingly subject to state control. Above all, employment agencies established in the provinces were also subject to financial control (Schöttler 1982, p. 90). Just as some opponents regarded the employment agencies as instruments of class struggle, so too did some of those involved. At the same time, however, they were also service agencies for French capitalism (Schöttler 1982, p. 136). At the same time as the reform of the Prud’hommes tribunals, membership of workers’ associations was decriminalised in 1884, albeit under very restrictive conditions.29 More clearly than in the development of legislation, however, the change in political strategies is reflected in the way prefects in the provinces reacted to strikes. While the policy of the prefects in the Second Empire was clearly repressive, their newly appointed successors in the Republic behaved less clearly in a repressive way and also differently. According to Michelle Perrot, they were generally not as close to entrepreneurs as most of their predecessors. As in other metropolitan capitalist countries, the question of strategies in the case of strikes was primarily about the use of the military. According to Perrot, entrepreneurs saw national troops as their private militia, as it were, and regularly demanded their deployment during conflicts (Perrot 1974, pp. 704b). With the decriminalisation of membership in workers’ organisations decided in 1884, a step towards the domestication of capitalism had been taken. In 1892, the law on strike arbitration gave a certain institutional form to the previous spontaneous moderation attempts by prefects. However, it was not mandatory to appeal to a justice of the peace, usually a prefect, and actual arbitration usually only worked locally (Weber 2010, p. 45). Despite these reforms, many of the organised labourers in France renounced the long-cherished hopes of a state-directed harmonious development of capitalism at the end of the nineteenth century. It was not the official representation of a grandiose economic future, as presented at the 1989 Paris World Fair, but the demands of the Second International, founded during that exhibition, that impressed organised labour. After 12 striking workers were killed and 30 others wounded by soldiers in Fourmies in 1891, a wave of very large strikes took place. The CGT (Confédération Générale du Travail), founded in 1895, advocated a strategy of ‘revolutionary syndicalism’, or in other words, the rejection of a strategy aimed at bringing about reform by influencing parliament (Tucker Jr. 1996/2005, p. 15). Unlike trade unions in Germany, the workers’ syndicates united in the CGT did not see themselves primarily as organisations for improving existing conditions. The ‘revolutionary syndicalists’ of France did not want to reform the state, they wanted to destroy it (Dreyfus 1995, p. 45).30 Strikes therefore were numerous. And not only entrepreneurs, but also syndicates hesitated for a long time to strive for and recognise collective agreements. Only in 1910 did the CGT accept such ceasefire agreements (Weber 2010, p. 1095). Unlike in Germany and unlike in France later in the twentienth century as well, the revolutionary aims at that time in France were mainly represented by workers whose skills in craftsmanship were used in small businesses with a low level of division of labour (Moss 1976, p. 159). The government showed itself to be relentlessly harsh against anyone expected to cause a disturbance of the public order. After the CGT leadership called out a general strike on 1 May 1906 in favour of the eight-hour day, Clemenceau, who had just been appointed Minister of the Interior, put Paris under military occupation and had the CGT leaders arrested. 665 other demonstrators were arrested. The term ‘clémencisme’ was coined for the brutal repression he ordered. Over the following two years, several strikers were killed by the police and military in various places (Weber 1910, p. 35). And the law passed in 1884, obliging municipalities to call in the military if strikes threatened to degenerate into unrest, continued to apply (Weber 2010, p. 37). Entrepreneurs took advantage of the political climate, lowered wages, reacted to strikes with dismissals, hired scabs and kept blacklists to make it difficult for strikers to find new jobs. The ‘good guys’, on the other hand, were hushed with bonuses (Bron 1970, vol. 11, pp. 123f.). After continuously acting as if there was no legal right to strike, Minister Briand presented a draft law in 1910 that would have formally abolished this right. When his ministerial period came to an end, this attempt was also ended?1 Like governments in the other European metropolitan capitalist countries involved in the First World War, the French government was forced during the First World War to combine measures to increase labour discipline with strategies of formal cooperation.32 Unlike in Germany, however, French gov-ernments did not develop a strategy of state economic governance. Instead, the organisation of the war economy was left to regional groups of production led by leading industrialists (Weber 2010, pp. mf.). After it became apparent that their practice had helped suppliers of products that were vital in times of war to make immense profits, the government felt compelled to set up control commissions to monitor the conclusion of contracts with suppliers. Unclear or overlapping responsibilities limited their impact. When bread and potatoes became scarce, criticism of the war profiteers grew. In August 1915, suppliers of military equipment were obliged to pay minimum wages. The amount of those minimum wages had to be posted for the workers in the factories (Weber 2010, p. 136). In 1916, the decision was taken to limit the immense profits of the suppliers by means of a special tax (Moulin-Bourret 111997, pp. 339; 345). This marked the beginning of what those affected called the ‘economic dictatorship’. Numerous mixed commissions were created to organise the war economy. Because the regular institutions were hardly prepared to outrage their voters with the harsh measures that had become necessary for the war economy, the extraordinary commissions effectively took the place of these institutions. This led to a proliferation in the administration. New ‘mixed commissions’, i.e. institutions were set up in the decisions of which representatives of the workers’ organisations were also involved. At the core of this was the organisation for procuring raw materials, the regulation of production and the management of the social situation (Moulin-Bourret 1997, p. 333). As early as 1915, workers who had initially been drafted into the military were assigned to participate in the production of armaments. They received no wages. In addition, foreign wage labourers were used, especially labourers from the colonies (for Clérmont-Ferrand: Moulin- Bourret 1997, pp. 471; 489). Meanwhile, disputes over working conditions continued. Workers in various trades went on strike, and trade unionists drafted into the military complained that they were ordered to the most dangerous places (Robert 1995, pp. 88f.). In January 1917, compulsory arbitration by commissions with equal representation was prescribed. In the event of a failed agreement, the minister could make an arbitral award and have it enforced by order of requisition (i.e. confiscation). Such ministerial decrees were frequent, which on the other hand reduced the importance of the joint commissions.33 In contrast to Germany, the institutions with parity representation oflabour and capital introduced during the war did not have that much effect on integration. To make it clear that starvation wages offered no protection against starvation, construction workers in Paris refused to accept their wages in the autumn of 1915. This action resulted in the granting of a monopoly to the construction workers’ union to decide on recruitment (Robert 1995, p. 77). In May 1918 about 100,000 wage earners went on strike in Paris. In Firminy and other places in the Loire Valley there was even a short general strike. Arrests followed as did the rumour, deliberately spread, that the strikes had been called out by German agents. At the end of the war, many expected that the revolution in Russia would also provide the impetus for revolutionary developments in France. This was clearly not the case. However, the drop in wages and the drastic rise in the price of rents and food, as well as prevailing non-compliance with the eight-hour day introduced by law in 1919,34 led to a large number of very large strikes. Although a law on collective labour agreements (conventions collectives de travail) was passed in March 1919, employers were allowed to leave the association that had concluded an agreement if they did not agree to belong to a collective agreement. Strikers were mainly concerned with wage increases. However, when the metalworkers’ organisations in the Seine département decided to go on strike in April 1919, one of their demands was that the extensive questioning of applicants about their own political views and those of their family members should in the future be stopped (Dolléans 1948, p. 302). Not only the metal workers’ strike, but also the almost nationwide railway workers’ strike was unsuccessful. The law enforcement personnel which had been mobilised was not employed, but entrepreneurs responded by dismissing thousands of employees. 18,000 railway workers involved in the strike were dismissed (Dreyfus 1995, p. 111). And in court trials, those involved in the strike were sentenced to prison terms. Not only were workers’ organisations unable to bring about a revolution, they also emerged as losers from the strikes of 1919 and 1920. They lost many members. Revolutionary syndicalism barely survived the First World War (Dreyfus 1995, p. 79).”翻译为中文","output":"压制公社的目的也在于摧毁工人组织。为此（Bron 1968，第237页），国际组织必须被一劳永逸地摧毁，几乎可以说是一种预防措施。1872年3月14日的法律已经使单纯的成员资格成为一种可惩罚的罪行。关于劳动世界的改革，因为很难争辩说改革是不必要的，应该出于基督教慈善精神来决定：1874年对童工的禁令几乎和1841年的早期禁令一样无效。新引入的工厂检查员经常在工厂主的陪同下进行检查（Weiss 1936，第83页；引自Schöttler 1982，第45页）。公社没有攻击工厂老板，但是压制使他们成了胜利者。尽管如此，早在1871年就出现了新的罢工运动，在1872年省份就成立了新的工人协会，大多以相互支持协会的形式成立。到了1870年代末，成立了新的全国性协会。到1880年，被定罪的公社成员获得了赦免。 将工人阶级纳入现有秩序的后革命战略的一部分是在1884年通过的普吕东（Prud’hommes）法院改革。这些仲裁法院的构成在1848年引入的平等性，已经在第二帝国时被撤销，现在被重新采用。当在某些地方规避了这些新规定时，国会宣布仲裁法院可以在企业代表缺席的情况下做出决定（Loubière 1975，第232页及以下，引自Schöttler 1982，第50页）。1887年在巴黎创立劳工交易所时，创造了一个代表工人利益的机构。 在随后的几十年里，劳工交易所及其对手所采取的策略都发生了变化。虽然该就业机构最初基本上是自主运营的，但影响力也较小，到了1890年代，它变得更有影响力，但同时受到国家控制增加。尤其是在省份建立的就业机构也受到财政控制（Schöttler 1982，第90页）。就像一些对手将就业机构视为阶级斗争的工具一样，一些参与者也是如此。然而，同时，它们也是法国资本主义的服务机构（Schöttler 1982，第136页）。 与普吕东法院的改革同时，1884年，工人组织的成员资格被非刑事化，尽管条件非常严格。然而，在立法发展中，更清晰地反映出政治策略变化的是省级长官对罢工的反应方式不同。根据Michelle Perrot的说法，他们通常不像大多数前任那样接近企业家。就像其他大都市资本主义国家一样，关于罢工的策略问题主要是关于使用军队。根据Perrot的说法，企业家将国家军队视为他们的私人民兵，并在冲突期间定期要求部署（Perrot 1974，第704b页）。 随着1884年决定的工人组织成员身份的非刑事化，向驯化资本主义迈出了一步。1892年，关于罢工仲裁的法律赋予了之前省长们尝试的自发性缓和行为以某种制度形式。然而，上诉至和平法官，通常是省长，并非强制性的，实际仲裁通常只在本地有效（Weber 2010，第45页）。 尽管有这些改革，许多组织化的法国劳工在19世纪末放弃了长期怀有的关于国家主导资本主义和谐发展的希望。他们不是被呈现在1989年巴黎世博会上的宏伟经济未来的官方代表所打动，而是被在那次展览期间成立的第二国际所提出的要求所打动。在1891年Fourmies的12名罢工工人被士兵杀害，另外30人受伤后，爆发了一波非常大规模的罢工。成立于1895年的全总工会（CGT）倡导“革命工会主义”战略，换句话说，就是拒绝旨在通过议会影响实现改革的战略（Tucker Jr. 1996/2005，第15页）。与德国的工会不同，联合在CGT中的工人组织并不主要视自己为改善现有条件的组织。法国的“革命工会主义者”不想改革国家，他们想要摧毁它（Dreyfus 1995，第45页）。因此，罢工事件频繁。而且不仅是企业家，工会也长时间犹豫是否争取和承认集体协议。直到1910年CGT才接受这种停火协议（Weber 2010，第1095页）。 与德国不同，也与20世纪后期的法国不同，当时在法国，革命目标主要由在小型企业中运用手工艺技能的工人所代表，这些小型企业的分工水平较低（Moss 1976，第159页）。 政府对任何可能扰乱公共秩序的人表现出无情的严厉。当CGT领导人在1906年5月1日号召全总罢工，以支持8小时工作日时，刚刚被任命为内政部长的克莱孟梭，将巴黎置于军事占领之下，并逮捕了CGT领导人。其他665名示威者被逮捕。克莱孟梭下令进行的残酷镇压被创造出“克莱孟梭主义”一词来形容。在接下来的两年里，警察和军队在各地杀害了数名罢工者（Weber 1910，第35页）。而1884年通过的法律，如果罢工威胁要演变成骚乱，义务要求市政府调用军队，仍然适用（Weber 2010，第37页）。企业主利用政治气候，降低工资，对罢工作出解雇反应，雇佣黑名单工人，并保持黑名单，以使罢工者难以找到新工作。另一方面，“好人”则被用奖金安抚（Bron 1970，第11卷，第123-124页）。在不断行事好像没有罢工的合法权利后，部长布里昂在1910年提出了一项草案，本来将正式废除这一权利。当他的部长任期结束时，这一尝试也结束了吗？ 就像第一次世界大战中其他涉及欧洲大都市资本主义国家的政府一样，法国政府在第一次世界大战期间被迫将增加劳动纪律的措施与正式合作的战略结合起来。然而，与德国不同，法国政府并未发展出国家经济治理的策略。相反，战争经济的组织留给了由领先工业家领导的地区生产集团（Weber 2010，页码不明）。当他们的做法显然帮助了战时至关重要的产品供应商获得了巨额利润时，政府感到有必要设立控制委员会来监督与供应商签订的合同。职责不清或重叠限制了他们的影响力。当面包和土豆变得稀缺时，对战争暴利者的批评日益增加。1915年8月，军事装备供应商被要求支付最低工资。这些最低工资的金额必须张贴在工厂内供工人查看（Weber 2010，第136页）。1916年，决定通过征收特别税来限制供应商的巨额利润（Moulin-Bourret 1997，第339；345页）。这标志着所谓的“经济独裁”时代的开始。成立了许多混合委员会来组织战争经济。由于常规机构几乎没有准备好用已成为战争经济必需的严厉措施激怒他们的选民，特别委员会实际上取代了这些机构。这导致行政机构的扩张。成立了新的“混合委员会”，即这些决策中也涉及到工人组织代表的机构。其核心是原材料的采购、生产的规范和社会状况的管理（Moulin-Bourret 1997，第333页）。早在1915年，最初被征召入伍的工人就被分配参与武器生产。他们没有获得工资。此外，还使用了外国工人，特别是来自殖民地的劳工（见Clérmont-Ferrand：Moulin-Bourret 1997，第471；489页）。 与此同时，关于工作条件的争议持续进行。各行各业的工人罢工，被征召入伍的工会成员抱怨他们被命令到最危险的地方（Robert 1995，第88-89页）。1917年1月，规定必须由代表平等的委员会进行强制仲裁。如果协议失败，部长可以做出仲裁裁决并通过征用命令（即没收）执行。这种部长法令很常见，这另一方面减少了联合委员会的重要性。 与德国不同，战时引入的劳资双方平等代表的机构并没有对融合产生太多影响。 为了明确表示微薄的工资无法防止饥饿，1915年秋季，巴黎的建筑工人拒绝接受他们的工资。这一行动导致建筑工人工会获得了决定招聘权的垄断（Robert 1995，第77页）。1918年5月，巴黎大约100,000名工人罢工。在Firminy和卢瓦尔河谷的其他地方甚至发生了短暂的大罢工。紧接着是逮捕，还故意散布谣言称罢工是由德国特工发动的。战争结束时，许多人期待俄罗斯的革命也将为法国带来革命性的发展。显然不是这种情况。 然而，工资的下降和租金及食品价格的急剧上涨，以及1919年通过法律引入的8小时工作日普遍不遵守，导致了大量非常大规模的罢工。尽管在1919年3月通过了一项关于集体劳动协议（conventions collectives de travail）的法律，雇主如果不同意属于集体协议，可以离开已达成协议的协会。罢工者主要关注工资提高。然而，当塞纳省的金属工人组织决定在1919年4月罢工时，他们的要求之一是，以后对申请人及其家庭成员的政治观点进行广泛询问应该停止（Dolléans 1948，第302页）。不仅是金属工人罢工，几乎全国性的铁路工人罢工也未能成功。动员了的执法人员没有被使用，但企业家通过解雇数千名员工做出反应。参与罢工的18,000名铁路工人被解雇（Dreyfus 1995，第111页）。在法庭审判中，参与罢工的人被判处监禁。工人组织不仅未能引发革命，还从1919年和1920年的罢工中败下阵来。他们失去了许多成员。革命工会主义几乎未能度过第一次世界大战（Dreyfus 1995，第79页）。"},{"instruction":"请将“In the followingyears the labour movement in France was even more divided than before. On the whole, however, there was a growing desire to achieve a recognised status for ‘labour’, in other words, for wage labourers, within existing society (Dolléans 1948, p. 373; Tucker 1996/2005, pp. 186ff.). In 1936 they were actually granted this recognition. After the electoral victory of the Front Populaire and the inauguration of the Blum government, the government orchestrated an agreement between trade unions and entrepreneurs, orchestrated by the government. In keeping with the venue of the negotiations, this agreement has gone down in history as ‘l’accord de Matignon’. On 7 June 1936, the basic elements of collective labour law, the validity of collective agreements, the unlimited right to organise trade unions and the election of labour representatives in companies with more than 10 employees were accepted, and wage increases were also agreed. A few days later, the laws on the 40-hour week and 15 days’ paid leave promised by the Front Populaire in the event of an election victory were adopted (Bron 1970, vol. II, pp. 231-5). The most important elements of the domestication of capitalist labour relations, i.e. the recognition of collective bargaining had thus become law, along with rudimentary welfare state regulations.35 This had become possible for two main reasons: On 6 February 1934, in the course of the protests against the Daladier government, demonstrators from the trade union federations had joined forces with those from the French Communist Party. Joachim C. Häberlen believes that the joint resistance against the danger of fascism in France became possible precisely because revolutionary syndicalists had insisted on their independence from political parties. Consequently, the wild battles between social democrats (including trade unionists) and communists which had prevented any joint political action in Germany did not take place in France (2013, pp. 39 and passim)?6 The second cause of the Matignon Agreement was a wave of strikes and factory occupations. They were carried out by men and women who had voted for communists and socialists,37 but in the weeks following the elections had waited in vain for the victors to dissolve the old parliament, in keeping with existing practice, and to pass resolutions that would improve their working and living conditions. Living conditions had deteriorated dramatically as a result of the effects of the global economic crisis, the onset of which had been delayed in France. A new, even bigger wave of strikes took place in June 1936. The demands varied. In general, however, it was expected that the promised 40-hour working week would be achieved?8 When the Prime Minister explained to a delegation of businessmen that his government was neither able nor willing to end the occupations of factories by force, he simultaneously announced the end of that era of capitalism in which strikes, occupations and other forms of workers’ protests were treated as a threat to public order which had to be violently suppressed. Instead, the Prime Minister warned the employer representatives on 6 June 1936 that violent and bloody unrest would inevitably occur if no agreement was reached within 48 hours (cited de Bayac 1972, p. 239). On 8 June, the chairman of the CGT, Jouhaux, declared that the agreement reached the night before marked the dawn of a new era: the era of direct relations between the organisations of the country’s two great economic powers (quoted in de Bayac 1972, p. 248). The entrepreneurs’ counteroffensive was not long in coming. As early as 1936, the federation of French entrepreneurs also admitted small and mediumsized enterprises, thereby increasing the central council of the federation from 90 to 150 members. Although the innovations, such as the 40-hour week in particular, were initially accepted, entrepreneurs immediately protested vehemently against the de facto impunity of factory occupations. Workers for their part responded with a wave of local strikes. Occupations occurred in 70 percent of the strikes. This was not a strategy to take over production, but a precaution against lockouts (Sirot 1988, p. 56). Workers turned almost every occupation into a celebration. And it is these celebrations of 1936 in which many of those involved developed the confidence that the world could be changed. The Front Populaire was an occurrence limited in political impact and in time, but its myth by far exceeds those limits (Jackson 1988, p. xii). In the end, a total of 4,595 collective agreements were concluded in 1936 and 1937, far more than ever before. They covered not only wages, but also working hours, bonuses, holidays, and health and safety issues. Where recourse was taken to state mediation, this gave the collective agreements a kind of state-guaranteed legality (Bourdé 1977, p. 17). Within two years, unemployment fell and the working and living conditions of many wage earners improved. The prescribed arbitration procedures were not always successful, but relatively often (Bourdé 1977, p. 19). One consequence of this development was the growth of trade unions. In many trades, the proportion of unionised workers grew from barely 10 percent to 50 percent or more. When the collective agreements concluded in 1936 expired after one year, there were numerous factory occupations on the one hand and numerous dismissals on the other. When the social peace sought by the Blum government failed to materialise, many union members resorted to protest actions that were neither planned nor approved by the union leaders. The agreements that were finally concluded prolonged important achievements of the Matignon Agreement but limited the powers of the staff representatives in the companies (Bourdé 1977, p. 37). The political base of the Front Populaire was jeopardised when the Blum government bowed to domestic and English pressure and withdrew its promise to supply arms to the insurgents in Spain. The change in the political situation became clear when in December 1937 the government sent 600 armed guards against striking workers at the Goodrich tire company.39 In late December 1937, state employees went on strike in Paris, and in March/April 1938,150,000 metalworkers went on strike. In April 1938 the Daladier government succeeded the Blum government.40 However, it was not until November 1938 that the advances pushed through in 1936 were to a large extent rolled back, and after the newly appointed Finance Minister, Reynaud, issued decrees in November 1938 that had already been prepared by his predecessor Daladier and that provided for increased taxes, austerity measures, military armament and restrictions on earnings for overtime, there was a wave of wild strikes and factory occupations (Jackson 1988, pp. 105f.). They were rigorously suppressed (Jackson 1988, p. 111). A particularly violent dispute arose in November 1938 at the Renault factory. After a trade unionist had been dismissed and the following day the working week was increased from 32 to 40 hours, a strike broke out.41 Members of the free trade unions forced members of the ‘yellow’ (i.e. business-friendly) trade unions to take part. Barricades were built. Between 10,000 and 15,000 workers occupied the factory, which also produced a transport tank. Minister of the Interior Reynaud is reported to have threatened to resign if the factory was not evacuated immediately (Bourdé 1977, p. 146). The government had 3,000 riot police (gardes mobiles), 1,500 police agents (agents de police), 300 ambulances and several fire engines. The riot police invaded the building. When the squatters, who had resisted vehemently and violently, left the factory, they were asked to march in rows of four, to raise their arms in a fascist salute and to shout: ‘Vive la police’. Meanwhile a policeman struck an iron bar and shouted: ‘A blow for Blum, a blow for Thorez, a blow for Jouhaux’ (Bourdé 1977, p. 148)^ The unions reacted by calling a general strike on 30 November. The call was obeyed, but it did not succeed in paralysing the national economy. 500 of the strikers were arrested after the general strike and 283 of them were sentenced to long prison terms (Bourdé 1977, p. 149). The Ministry of Labour estimated that some 800,000 of those involved in the strike subsequently lost their jobs (Bourdé 1977, p. 229). When an amnesty was granted in February 1939 for most of those convicted after the general strike, the Daladier government justified this by saying that authority in the country was now established. This did not mean, however, that those who had been laid off were reinstated. Blacklists were circulating among employers (Bourdé 1977, pp. 230f.). At the end of 1938, the legacy of the Front Populaire had been reduced to the right to paid leave and the temporary hope of at least domesticated capitalism. Entrepreneurs, however, had successfully defended their position as boss and in the process had at the same time gained a new class identity. Since the parliament had proved incapable of dealing with the social conflicts, the Daladier government, elected in December 1938, had it easy when it set about strengthening the executive. Weekly working hours remained high, arms production was stepped up, and high growth rates were achieved in most industries. In March 1939, a decree authorised all companies that produced armaments to increase weekly working hours to 60 and to reduce overtime pay (Bourdé 1977, p. 267). After the devastating military defeats43 in the war against the German Reich, on 10 July 1940, both chambers decided to suspend the 1875 Constitution and transfer the government’s powers to Marshal Pétain. This decision was a consequence of the military disaster, but it was also the result of an attitude that was in keeping with the slogan that was then widespread among right-wing parliamentarians: ‘Better Hitler than the Front Populaire’ (Bourdé 1977, p. 285)^ The Vichy regime, which had initially been established in the non-occupied part of France after the armistice with Germany in 1940 and operated under German occupation from 1942, eliminated the beginnings of a domestication of capitalism in France. All areas of life were subordinated to political regulation. In accordance with the extensive concessions made in the armistice, the ‘état français’ became the recipient of orders from German government agencies. Accordingly, strikes were criminalised, and trade unions were dissolved. From 15 November 1940, the CGT could only operate underground. On 27 October 1941, 27 CGT leaders were shot in Chateaubriand (Dreyfus 1995, p. 399). When strikes broke out in May 1941 in northern France, in the middle of the occupied zone, involving up to 100,000 miners, they were violently quelled (Dreyfus 1995, p. 207).”翻译为中文","output":"在接下来的几年里，法国的劳动运动比以前更加分裂。然而，总体上，对于“劳动”，换句话说，对于雇佣劳工，在现有社会中获得认可的愿望不断增长（Dolléans 1948，第373页；Tucker 1996/2005，第186页及以下）。 1936年，他们实际上获得了这种认可。在人民阵线的选举胜利和布卢姆政府的就职之后，政府策划了工会和企业家之间的一项协议。与谈判地点一致，这项协议被载入史册为“马蒂尼翁协议”。1936年6月7日，集体劳动法的基本元素、集体协议的有效性、无限组织工会的权利以及在拥有10名以上员工的公司中选举劳工代表的权利被接受，工资增加也被商定。几天后，采纳了人民阵线在选举胜利时承诺的40小时工作周和15天带薪假期的法律（Bron 1970，第二卷，第231-5页）。资本主义劳资关系驯化的最重要元素，即集体谈判的认可成为了法律，还有初步的福利国家规定。 这成为可能有两个主要原因：1934年2月6日，在抗议达拉迪埃政府的过程中，来自工会联合和法国共产党的示威者联合起来。Joachim C. Häberlen认为，法国反对法西斯主义危险的联合抵抗正是因为革命工会主义者坚持与政党的独立。因此，在法国没有发生阻碍德国任何联合政治行动的社会民主党员（包括工会成员）与共产党员之间的激烈冲突（2013年，第39页及以下）。马蒂尼翁协议的第二个原因是一波罢工和工厂占领浪潮。这些罢工和占领是由投票给共产党和社会党的男女发起的，但在选举之后的几周里，他们徒劳地等待胜利者解散旧议会，按照现有惯例，并通过决议改善他们的工作和生活条件。由于全球经济危机的影响，生活条件急剧恶化，这种情况在法国被推迟了。1936年6月发生了新的、更大规模的罢工浪潮。要求各不相同。然而，总的来说，人们期待实现承诺的40小时工作周。当总理向一群商人解释说，他的政府既没有能力也不愿意动用武力结束工厂的占领时，他同时宣布了资本主义时代的终结，在这个时代，罢工、占领和其他形式的工人抗议被视为威胁公共秩序，必须被暴力镇压。相反，总理在1936年6月6日警告雇主代表，如果在48小时内未达成协议，必然会发生暴力和血腥的动乱（引自de Bayac 1972，第239页）。6月8日，CGT主席Jouhaux宣布前一晚达成的协议标志着一个新时代的到来：国家两大经济力量的组织之间直接关系的时代（引自de Bayac 1972，第248页）。 企业家的反攻不久就来了。早在1936年，法国企业家联合会也接纳了中小企业，因此联合会中央理事会的成员从90人增加到150人。尽管最初接受了诸如40小时工作周等创新措施，企业家立即强烈抗议工厂占领的事实上免受惩罚。工人则以一波地方性罢工做出回应。罢工中有70%发生了占领。这不是接管生产的策略，而是防止停工的预防措施（Sirot 1988，第56页）。工人几乎将每次占领都变成了一次庆祝。正是这些1936年的庆祝活动，让许多参与者建立起了可以改变世界的信心。人民阵线在政治影响和时间上都是有限的，但其神话远远超出了这些限制（Jackson 1988，第xii页）。 最终，在1936年和1937年共签署了4,595份集体协议，远远超过了以往任何时候。它们不仅涉及工资，还包括工时、奖金、假期以及健康和安全问题。当求助于国家调解时，这给予了集体协议一种国家保证的合法性（Bourdé 1977，第17页）。在两年内，失业率下降，许多工薪阶层的工作和生活条件得到改善。规定的仲裁程序并不总是成功的，但相对频繁（Bourdé 1977，第19页）。这一发展的一个后果是工会的增长。在许多行业中，工会成员的比例从几乎10%增长到50%或更多。 当1936年签订的集体协议在一年后到期时，一方面出现了众多工厂占领，另一方面出现了众多解雇。当布卢姆政府追求的社会和平未能实现时，许多工会成员诉诸于既未计划也未经工会领导批准的抗议行动。最终达成的协议延长了马蒂尼翁协议的重要成就，但限制了公司员工代表的权力（Bourdé 1977，第37页）。当布卢姆政府屈服于国内和英国的压力，撤回了向西班牙起义者提供武器的承诺时，人民阵线的政治基础受到了威胁。 政治形势的变化在1937年12月变得清晰，当时政府派遣了600名武装警卫对付在古德里奇轮胎公司罢工的工人。1937年12月底，巴黎的国家雇员举行了罢工，1938年3月/4月，150,000名金属工人罢工。 1938年4月，达拉迪埃政府接替了布卢姆政府。然而，直到1938年11月，1936年推动的进步在很大程度上才被撤销，当新任财政部长雷诺于1938年11月发布了他的前任达拉迪埃已经准备好的法令，提供了增加税收、紧缩措施、军事装备和限制加班费收入后，爆发了一波野蛮的罢工和工厂占领（Jackson 1988，第105-106页）。它们被严厉镇压（Jackson 1988，第111页）。在雷诺工厂发生了一场特别激烈的争执。在一名工会成员被解雇和第二天工作周从32小时增加到40小时之后，爆发了罢工。自由工会的成员强迫“黄色”（即亲商业）工会的成员参与。建立了路障。1万到1.5万工人占领了这家同时生产运输坦克的工厂。据报道，内政部长雷诺威胁说，如果工厂不立即被清空，他将辞职（Bourdé 1977，第146页）。政府动用了3000名防暴警察（gardes mobiles）、1500名警察（agents de police）、300辆救护车和数辆消防车。防暴警察闯入建筑。当坚决并暴力抵抗的占领者离开工厂时，他们被要求四人一排行进，举起手臂做出法西斯式敬礼并大喊：“Vive la police”。与此同时，一名警察敲击铁条并大喊：“给布卢姆一击，给索瑞兹一击，给邬霍一击”（Bourdé 1977，第148页）工会通过呼吁在11月30日举行全民罢工作为回应。这一号召得到遵守，但未能成功使国家经济瘫痪。在全民罢工后有500名罢工者被逮捕，其中283人被判处长期监禁（Bourdé 1977，第149页）。劳工部估计，参与罢工的约80万人随后失去了工作（Bourdé 1977，第229页）。1939年2月，对大多数在全民罢工后被定罪的人给予了特赦，达拉迪埃政府以国家权威现在已建立为由来证明这一点。然而，这并不意味着那些被解雇的人被重新聘用。雇主之间流传着黑名单（Bourdé 1977，230-231页）。 到了1938年底，人民阵线的遗产减少到了带薪休假的权利和至少是驯化资本主义的暂时希望。然而，企业家成功地捍卫了他们作为老板的地位，并在这一过程中同时获得了新的阶级身份。由于议会被证明无法处理社会冲突，1938年12月当选的达拉迪埃政府在着手加强行政权力时轻而易举。每周工作小时数保持高位，军备生产加速，大多数行业实现了高增长率。1939年3月，一项法令授权所有生产军备的公司将每周工作小时数增加到60小时并减少加班费（Bourdé 1977，第267页）。 在对德国帝国的战争中遭受毁灭性军事失败后，1940年7月10日，两院决定暂停1875年宪法并将政府权力移交给佩坦元帅。这一决定是军事灾难的后果，但也是符合当时右翼议员普遍口号的态度的结果：“宁可希特勒也不要人民阵线”（Bourdé 1977，第285页）。 维希政权最初是在1940年与德国签署停战协议后在法国未被占领地区建立的，并从1942年开始在德国占领下运作，消除了法国资本主义驯化的开端。所有生活领域都受到政治监管。根据停战协议作出的广泛让步，“法兰西国”成为了德国政府机构命令的接收者。相应地，罢工被定罪，工会被解散。从1940年11月15日起，CGT只能在地下运作。1941年10月27日，27名CGT领导人在沙托布里昂被枪决（Dreyfus 1995，第399页）。当1941年5月在法国北部占领区爆发涉及多达10万名矿工的罢工时，它们被暴力镇压（Dreyfus 1995，第207页）。"},{"instruction":"请将“At the centre of the new policy was the political organisation of labour, form-alised in the Charte du Travail. The law ‘on the social organisation of professions’ (organisation sociale des professions) of 4 October 1941 created syndicates of all the members of a professional group, decreed by the state. Although trade unionists collaborated because they saw the new regulations as the realisation of earlier demands, the practical implementation of this corporatist concept remained limited (Dreyfus 1995, p. 201). The collaboration of the ‘Étatfrançais’ with the representatives of Nazi Germany in the implementation of the job creation policy from 1940 to 1944, which began with the armistice of 22 June 1940, is different, because the principles decreed by the occupying power also corresponded to the labour market policy concepts prevalent in the government of the ‘Étatfrançais’. In October 1940, when it was made clear to unemployed people that they would lose their benefits if they did not volunteer for public works (rubble clearance, logging, etc.), this measure was led by the same François Lehideux, who in 1936 had proved to be a particularly fierce opponent of strikers (Zielinski 1995, p. 57). When recruiting workers for two-year work stays in Germany between 1940 and 1942, the French authorities also resorted to administrative harassment. As air raids and fatalities became more frequent, the supply of comparatively high wages was no longer sufficient to recruit volunteers for the coastal fortifications in northern France. In February 1941, the High Command of the Wehrmacht therefore ordered compulsory job creation measures (Zielinski 1995, p. 69). In order to prevent construction workers from attempting to escape, camps surrounded by barbed wire were set up. In order to mitigate the shortage of labour in the territory of the Reich, French prisoners of war had first been transferred to the Reich. At the same time, those who had previously volunteered to work in the Reich territory were forcibly re-enlisted (Zielinski 1995, pp. 106 f.). In June 1942, a deal known as a ‘relève’ was agreed between the occupying power and the government of the État français’. For the ‘voluntary’ registration of 150,000 French workers, 50,000 French prisoners of war were to be gradually (temporarily) granted leave of absence. Officially, this agreement lasted until December 1942, but it became clear after only a few weeks that it was not effective (Laub 2010, p. 255). This put an end to the last semblance of a voluntary basis. With the law of 4 September 1942, the possibility of compulsory work was decreed for all Frenchmen between 18 and 50 years of age and all unmarried French women between 21 and 35 years of age. The law was to apply not only to the whole of France but also to the German Reich (Laub 2010, p. 256). The provisions of this law were already tightened in February 1943 with the introduction of a two-year work service. From then on, deportations were systematic. In May, the Vichy regime abolished previously valid exemptions from work obligations, such as those that had applied to primary school teachers, firemen or pregnant wives (Zielinski 1995, p. 149). Between May 1942 and August 1944, at least 850,000 workers from France were deployed in the Reich (Laub 2010, p. 263). After constantly falling real wages in France had provoked strikes, absenteeism and other forms of resistance, the compulsory labour force, which had previously only been practised in the construction industry, was extended to other sectors. As hope grew that Germany would lose the war, more and more people withdrew from work obligations by going underground (Laub 2010, p. 261). After the end of the Second World War there were numerous protest rallies and strikes in France. The government decreed wage increases. Industrial companies were subsidised to compensate for the inflation that this had fuelled. At the same time, the nationalisation of companies, already planned by the left during the war years, was set in motion. Although different political groups hoped this strategy would have different effects, approval of nationalisation ranged from the communists to De Gaulle (Requate 2011, pp. 33-4).45 As in other metropolitan capitalist countries, the standard of living of workers in France rose in the 1950s and early 1960s. Despite the decline of smallscale farming and the influx of potential workers, the 1960s saw widespread full employment. However, little had changed in the working regime on the factories. It was in this situation that student protests against the authoritarian structures of teaching and research in May 1968 broke out. As the criticism that was being voiced soon spread to general political and economic conditions, the protest movement increasingly included wage workers and members of the liberal professions. The fact that so many wage workers took part in the protests was due not least to the fact that the government and private employers had consistently rejected collective bargaining in the months before. This led to the biggest strike ever in France (Dreyfus 1995, p. 268) and to the construction of barricades in Paris. In Rue Grenelle, the headquarters of the Ministry of Labour, government representatives bargained with representatives of the CGT. The results of these negotiations have become known as the ‘accords de Grenelle’. Although representatives of employers’ associations were also involved in these negotiations, it was mainly politicians and trade union representatives who faced each other. The result was an agreed raise in the statutory minimum wage. The demanded reduction in working hours was refused. It was also promised that certain obstacles to trade union work would be avoided in the future (Dreyfus 1995, pp. 271-3). These were comparatively minor concessions. Nevertheless, the negotiations that ended the general strike of 1968 marked the transition to a domesticated capitalism in France. For from then on, disputes over the level of wages and thus profits, as well as disputes over the organisation of work in the companies themselves, were regarded as regular procedures of a capitalist society. Germany Because the National Socialist labour regime is in complete contradiction with all ideas of a continuous domestication of capitalism in the European metropolitan countries of capitalism, it is the focal point of the following explanations. Follow-ing my interpretation of processes of domestication presented at the beginning of Chapter 6, the main emphasis here is on the banning of trade union activity and the re-integrating of labour relations into the power of the state. Forced labour and extermination within an economically and administratively highly developed capitalist system have made it horrifyingly clear that economic rationality does not suffice to prevent directviolence. The analysis of National Socialism also makes it clear that social policy and the domestication of capitalism are not the same thing. When the trade regulations of the North German Confederation, which were passed in 1869, became the Industrial Code for the Reich in 1872, the criminalisation of breaches of contract was (at least formally) ended throughout the Reich. As a result, labour relations, still predominantly in the crafts, were freed of state coercion throughout the Reich. At the same time, industrial workers (but not farmhands) were granted freedom of association in § 152 of the Industrial Code. Its scope was limited, however, because §153 threatened anyone with a three-month prison sentence for any form of emphatic persuasion to strike and for any actions undertaken against scabs. Although this did not mean an explicit ban on strikes, the section could be used to indict the organisers of strikes. This was practised on a wide scale. It was also still legal for employers to dismiss union members and to maintain ‘blacklists’ and thus impose de facto exclusion from employment. The police and judicial authorities provided surveillance reports to employers. In German, employers are called Arbeitgeber, or work ‘givers’ (Schönhoven 1987, p. 217). When the short period of economic boom that followed the founding of the Reich already turned into the ‘Great Depression’ in 1873, industrialists began to demand protective tariffs. They set up associations to lend weight to their demands on the state. When the crisis spread to the agricultural sector in 1875, the Junkers who had previously favoured a free trade policy chimed in to demands for protective tariffs. In 1879 a protective tariff legislation was adopted by the Reichstag. It meant profits for large-scale agricultural interests and made it easier for industrial capitalism to expand. The same period saw a rise in the number of wage earners’ memberships in workers’ organisations. Unlike in France, no significant efforts were made in Germany for trade union organisations to prepare the revolutionary overthrow of the existing order.46 Instead, the political organisations of workers immediately became dominant.47 Although this prolonged the consolidation of the strategic orientation that had already emerged in the 1860s, the political dominance of the parties was also furthered by the current political situation. Universal suffrage for men, introduced in 1867 for the North German Confederation and then in 1871 for the Reich, suggested giving preference to political disputes. Although the candidates of initially two and then one workers’ party had little chance of being elected because the division of constituencies was not based on population figures and put voters in cities at a considerable disadvantage, the distribution of votes made it clear that the political potential of the workers’ organisations was not insignificant. In 1877, 9.1 percent of all eligible voters cast their votes for the Social Democratic Workers’ Party. It sent 13 of a total 397 delegates to the Reichstag (Tenfelde 1987, p. 145). How great fear of their influence actually was, is perhaps irrelevant. However, it is certain that ruling circles, above all the Imperial Chancellor, were anxious to put a halt to further political successes. For the time being, however, liberal politicians, another of Bismarck’s preferred targets, insisted on maintaining the rule of law. When Bismarck blamed the Social Democrats for the assassination attempt on the Emperor on 11 May 1878 and called for a special criminal law against Social Democratic ‘machinations’, the Liberals refused to agree. After the second assassination attempt (on 2 June), Bismarck did not risk allowing the motion to be rejected a second time, and instead dissolved the Reichstag. Although the Social Democrats hardly lost any votes in the new elections, the ‘Law against the Social Democratic aspirations dangerous to the public’ or ‘Gesetz gegen die gemeingefährlichen Bestrebungen der Sozialdemokratie’ was passed on 21 October 1878, this time with the approval of the National Liberal MPs. Even prior to this, the authorities had already endeavoured to pin down Social Democrats and get them laid off.”翻译为中文","output":"新政策的中心是劳动的政治组织，这在《劳动宪章》（Charte du Travail）中得到了形式化。1941年10月4日的“行业社会组织法”（organisation sociale des professions）创建了由职业群体所有成员组成的工会，由国家颁布。尽管工会成员因为将新规定视为早期要求的实现而进行合作，但这一企业组织概念的实际实施仍然受到限制（Dreyfus 1995，第201页）。自1940年至1944年《法兰西国》政府与纳粹德国代表在实施创造就业政策方面的合作始于1940年6月22日的停战，这是不同的，因为占领权力颁布的原则也符合《法兰西国》政府流行的劳动市场政策概念。1940年10月，当向失业者明确表示如果他们不主动参加公共工程（清理废墟、伐木等），就会失去福利时，这项措施是由弗朗索瓦·勒埃杜主导的，他在1936年证明了自己是罢工者的特别激进的对手（Zielinski 1995，第57页）。在1940年至1942年间招募工人到德国进行为期两年的工作时，法国当局也诉诸于行政骚扰。随着空袭和死亡事件变得更加频繁，相对较高的工资供应不再足以招募志愿者参与法国北部沿海要塞的建设。因此，1941年2月，德国国防军高级指挥部下令实施强制性的创造就业措施（Zielinski 1995，第69页）。为了防止建筑工人试图逃跑，建立了由铁丝网围绕的营地。 为了缓解德国领土内劳动力短缺，首先将法国战俘转移到德国。与此同时，那些之前自愿在德国领土工作的人被强行重新征用（Zielinski 1995，第106-107页）。1942年6月，占领权力与《法兰西国》政府达成了一项被称为“换人”（relève）的协议。对于15万名法国工人的“自愿”登记，将逐步（临时）批准5万名法国战俘休假。这项协议官方持续到1942年12月，但仅几周后就明显看出它没有效果（Laub 2010，第255页）。这结束了任何自愿基础的最后一丝幻想。根据1942年9月4日的法律，规定了18至50岁间的所有法国男性和21至35岁间的所有未婚法国女性的强制工作可能性。该法律不仅适用于整个法国，也适用于德国帝国（Laub 2010，第256页）。这项法律的规定在1943年2月通过引入为期两年的劳动服役制度而得到加强。从那时起，驱逐成为系统性的。5月，维希政权废除了之前有效的免于工作义务的豁免权，比如适用于小学教师、消防员或孕妇的豁免权（Zielinski 1995，第149页）。从1942年5月到1944年8月，至少有85万名来自法国的工人在德国被部署（Laub 2010，第263页）。在法国实际工资持续下降引发罢工、旷工和其他抵抗形式之后，此前仅在建筑行业实行的强制劳动力被扩展到其他部门。随着人们越来越希望德国输掉战争，越来越多的人通过地下活动逃避工作义务（Laub 2010，第261页）。 二战结束后，在法国爆发了众多抗议集会和罢工。政府颁布了加薪令。为了补偿由此引起的通货膨胀，工业公司得到了补贴。同时，在战争年代左翼已经计划的公司国有化得以启动。尽管不同政治团体希望这一战略产生不同的效果，从共产党人到戴高乐的国有化批准范围很广（Requate 2011，第33-34页）。 像其他资本主义大都市国家一样，1950年代和1960年代初，法国工人的生活水平上升。尽管小规模农业的衰落和潜在工人的涌入，1960年代见证了普遍的充分就业。然而，在工厂的工作制度上几乎没有变化。 1968年5月，学生抗议教学和研究的权威结构。随着所提出的批评很快扩散到一般的政治和经济条件，抗议运动日益包括了工资工人和自由职业者。很多工资工人参与抗议的一个原因，是因为在此之前的几个月政府和私营雇主一直一致拒绝集体谈判。这导致了法国有史以来最大的一次罢工（Dreyfus 1995，第268页），并在巴黎建立了路障。在劳工部总部格勒内勒街，政府代表与CGT的代表进行了谈判。这些谈判的结果被称为“格勒内勒协议”。尽管雇主协会的代表也参与了这些谈判，但主要是政治家和工会代表之间的对峙。结果是同意提高法定最低工资。拒绝了减少工作时间的要求。也承诺将来避免对工会工作的某些障碍（Dreyfus 1995，第271-273页）。这些是相对较小的让步。尽管如此，结束1968年大罢工的谈判标志着法国资本主义驯化的过渡。因为从那时起，关于工资水平和利润的争议，以及关于公司内部工作组织的争议，被视为资本主义社会的常规程序。 德国 因为国家社会主义的劳动制度与所有欧洲资本主义大都市国家资本主义连续驯化的理念完全相反，它是以下解释的焦点。按照我在第6章开头提出的驯化过程的解释，这里的主要重点是禁止工会活动和将劳动关系重新整合到国家权力中。在经济和行政高度发达的资本主义系统内的强迫劳动和灭绝，令人恐怖地清楚地表明，经济合理性不足以防止直接暴力。对国家社会主义的分析也表明，社会政策和资本主义的驯化并不相同。 当北德意志联邦在1869年通过的贸易条例成为1872年的帝国工业法典时，合同违反的刑事化（至少在形式上）在帝国范围内结束了。结果，整个帝国的劳动关系，仍主要在手工业中，摆脱了国家强制。同时，工业工人（但不是家庭佣工）在工业法典第152条中获得了结社自由。然而，其范围受到限制，因为第153条对任何形式的强调说服罢工和对打击替工的任何行为威胁以三个月监禁。尽管这并不意味着明确禁止罢工，但该条款可用于起诉罢工组织者。这种做法广泛实行。雇主解雇工会成员和维持“黑名单”从而事实上排除就业的行为仍然合法。警察和司法当局向雇主提供监视报告。在德语中，雇主被称为Arbeitgeber，或称为工作“提供者”（Schönhoven 1987，第217页）。 当建国后的经济繁荣短暂时期在1873年已经转变为“大萧条”时，工业家开始要求保护性关税。他们成立了协会向国家施加压力以支持他们的需求。当危机在1875年蔓延到农业部门时，之前倾向于自由贸易政策的世袭地主加入了对保护性关税的要求。1879年，帝国议会通过了保护性关税立法。这意味着为大型农业利益带来利润，并使工业资本主义的扩张变得更加容易。 同一时期，工资劳动者加入工人组织的人数增加。与法国不同，德国没有对工会组织准备推翻现有秩序的革命进行重大努力。相反，工人的政治组织立即占据了主导地位。尽管这延长了早在1860年代就出现的战略取向的巩固，但政党的政治主导地位也得到了当前政治形势的推动。1867年为北德意志联邦引入的男性普选权，然后在1871年为帝国引入，表明优先考虑政治争议。尽管最初两个、然后是一个工人党的候选人几乎没有当选的机会，因为选区划分不是基于人口数字，使得城市选民处于相当大的劣势，但投票分布清楚地表明，工人组织的政治潜力不容忽视。1877年，9.1%的合格选民投票支持社会民主工人党。它向议会派出了总共397名代表中的13名（Tenfelde 1987，第145页）。他们影响力实际有多大可能不那么重要。然而，可以肯定的是，统治阶层，尤其是帝国总理，急于阻止进一步的政治成功。然而，自由主义政治家，也是俾斯麦的另一个首要目标，坚持维护法治。当俾斯麦将1878年5月11日皇帝遇刺归咎于社会民主党，并要求对社会民主党的“阴谋”实施特别刑法时，自由党拒绝同意。继第二次刺杀企图（6月2日）后，俾斯麦没有冒第二次让动议被否决的风险，而是解散了帝国议会。尽管社会民主党在新选举中几乎没有失去任何选票，“1878年10月21日通过的《反对社会民主党对公众构成危险的倾向法》或《反社会民主党法》得到了国民自由党议员的批准。即便在此之前，当局已经努力确定社会民主党人并让他们被解雇。"},{"instruction":"请将“Not only did the enactment of the law make it possible for organisations and individuals to be prosecuted; the law also made it possible to impose a state of siege on certain regions. This made it possible to expel workers’ leaders. Not all organisations were banned, but a total of 322 associations were banned over the eleven years in which the so-called ‘Socialist Law’ was in force. ‘831 years of imprisonment were imposed, and 893 people were expelled (some of them several times)’ (Tenfelde 1987, p. 148, on the basis of Auer 1913, pp. 354-63). The severity of repression varied from region to region. In several southern German towns, Social Democrats managed to join citizens’ committees. In others, legal offshoots of the banned parties called ‘workers’ election associations’ were founded. When Stuttgart carpenters went on strike in 1883 to defend the ten- hour day, this strike spread to the whole of Württemberg.48 As oppressive as the repression was for individuals, the ‘Socialist Law’ proved overall to be politically ineffective, if not counterproductive. This already began when a whole series of trade unions dissolved their organisations, thus putting their cash balances into savings. Then the Social Democrats carried out a lively and very successful information campaign. At the centre of this ‘nonpublic public relations work’ was the journal ‘The Social Democrat’, which was produced in Swiss exile and then - as Friedrich Engels sarcastically and triumphantly wrote, ‘in defiance of and mockery of all Reich and state legislation’ (Social Democrat No. 39; quoted by Friedemann 1978, p. 67) - penetrated the Reich’s territory every week, unintentionally assisted by the Reichspost. After the repeal of the Socialist Law (in January 1890), social democracy and trade unions became a mass movement. Increasingly, women also joined these organisations. In 1912,4.25 million (34.8 percent) voted for the election of Social Democratic candidates to the Reichstag (Nipperdey 111998, p. 555). While the Socialist Law was still in force, the Reichstag had passed laws marking the transition from state poor house policy to state social policy. In retrospect, Bismarck’s Social Security seems far less grandiose than the very polished picture it presents.49 It nevertheless marked a turning point. For unlike the trade union relief funds (Hilfskassen) that had been set up previously, social insurance was no longer based on solidarity but on the calculation of risk. It thus turned the typical damage to working life in industrial capitalism into random events, or more precisely, statistically calculable risks. As much as such risks were caused and determined by the prevailing economic order - after all, ‘old age’, for example, only became a risk when working conditions made it impossible for a worker to provide for his or her old age and following the weakening of family bonds with their ensuing obligations through migration - late nineteenth-century social insurance did not cover specific risks provoked precisely by the vicissitudes of capitalist economic cycles: it was not until decades later that it was possible to take out insurance against unemployment. The characteristic feature of insurance is not that it redistributes the burden of individual losses to a group, but that it allows this redistribution to take place not in the form of a redistribution or a benefit, but according to a rule which is a rule of justice, a legal norm. EWALD 1986/1993, p. 219, transl. By sparing wage labourers who were entitled to an insurance benefit, however small,50 the police control reserved for beneficiaries of poor relief and at the same time the opprobrium of being personally at fault for their lot, the social security system created a clear divide between needy wage labourers and other poor people. In this way, however small its benefits, it nourished the specific hope for social ascension that was widespread in the Social Democratic working class at the close of the nineteenth century (Gerstenberger 1981, pp. 57-9).51 And while the meagre benefits of social security hardly sufficed to integrate wage labourers politically, the administrative distinction between the poor and the workers nevertheless created conditions for integration that were to have a long-term effect. This did nothing to fundamentally change the use of state violence against striking and protesting wage labourers. In 1890 and 1899, the government re-sponded to demands from business circles and presented bills aimed at drastically tightening § 53. Even to call for a strike was to become punishable by law. And with the draft submitted in 1899, which became known as the ‘prison act’, ‘ringleaders’ were subject to up to five years imprisonment. As for the rejection of this bill, Petra Weber has pointed out that the vast majority of members of the Reichstag had by then become resigned to the existence of trade unions. Thus, in 1906 a bill failed that would have severely restricted the scope of action of trade unions (Weber 2010, p. 31). Unlike most members of parliament, most industrialists had not yet come to terms with trade unions at all. And indeed, not only before and during the effectiveness of the anti-socialist Law, but also after it had been rescinded, they were able to count on local police and additional military support against strikers. This turned industrial action into a state of war. Weapons were not always actually used, but in the miners’ strike of 1899,11 strikers died and 26 were seriously injured (Weber 2010, p. 30). In the 1870s, the practice of restricting the right of association granted in § 152 of the Gewerbeordnung (Trade Regulations Code) through interpretations of §153 was not only continued but considerably stepped up. Common practices during strikes, such as mocking scabs, were judged as insult, coercion or bodily injury. The frequency of convictions varied according to the political and economic situation, but on the whole the number rose. At the same time, courts increased the severity of sentences. Between 1903 and 1912, more than 6,000 workers were sentenced to prison terms for offences committed against § 153 of the Industrial Code. Some were given a short sentence, but a few received the maximum sentence of three months (Saul 1974, p. 263). In order to prevent the outbreak of a strike, German courts used ‘temporary injunctions’ just like courts in the United States (known in Germany at the time as Einhaltbefehl’ or ‘stopping order’). These injunctions, linked to threats or heavy fines or long prison sentences, were particularly commonly deployed against calls for boycott (Saul 1974, p. 249). Strike picketing was almost essential for conducting strikes. In order to prevent them, governments frequently resorted to street police regulations. Pickets were ordered to leave. If they refused, they were arrested and often not released until the following day. Not all courts upheld the legality of these police measures, but the Prussian Court of Appeal did. Such unequivocal class justice made it clear that while the presence of Social Democrats in the Reichstag made it impossible or at least more difficult to pass repressive laws, that presence did not prevent state violence from being used against the assertion of workers’ interests in practice. Nevertheless, the repressive judicial practice did not prevent the spread of trade unions and strikes.52 This increase in power was evident not least in the fact that entrepreneurs were striving to overcome the previous fragmentation of their own associations. In 1910, the managing director of the ‘Centralverband Deutscher Industrieller’ (Central Association of German Industrialists) stated that the task now was ‘to crush, break up and annihilate the trade unions’.53 To achieve this, the association agitated for the abolition of the right of association. Some trade unionists wanted to oppose this with a mass strike, but most of their leaders trusted the resistance of a Reichstag majority against such a move. The beginning of the war relieved them of the necessity to take this decision. On 1 August 1914, the German government ordered the mobilisation, and on 2 August, the German military occupied Luxembourg. On the same day, the governing boards of the German trade unions decided to support the German war effort. Strikes were to be avoided for the duration of the war, and consequently a general ‘truce’ (Burgfrieden) was to prevail. On 3 August German troops invaded Belgium. On 4 August, the Social Democratic group in the German Reichstag approved the war loans. The ‘truce’ proclaimed by the workers’ organisations was intended to support the defence against Russia, to anticipate bans on organising, and to help achieve the as yet unachieved political recognition of the trade unions. In fact, as early as August 1914, trade union representatives were called in for consultations on food problems, job creation, and other problems that had been newly created by the war. Under pressure from the military authorities, industrialists producing armaments were also forced to negotiate with trade unionists to deal with labour shortages (Schönhoven 1987, p. 254). The Hilfsdienstgesetz or ‘Auxiliary Service Act’ passed on 2 December 1916 meant that the German State recognised trade unions as bargaining partners. That came at a price. The law restricted the free choice of jobs. Men were subject to compulsory labour in businesses and government agencies that were vital to the war effort. The management oflabour requirements was transferred to arbitration committees in which workers and employees were represented on an equal basis with entrepreneurs, all under the supervision of the military. Of course, it was impossible to find a remedy for the shortage of skilled workers. And the institutionalisation of bargaining over mutual interests from a position of equality, which had been fought for so long, turned trade unions into instruments of the war economy. This limited their radius of action (Schönhoven 1987, pp. 259-61). All this happened at a time when not only the initial enthusiasm for the war had waned in the population, but also criticism of the war and the truce had grown in the Reichstag faction and in some Social Democratic local associations. After Karl Liebknecht was sentenced to four years in prison for shouting out to demonstrators at the May Day rally in Berlin ‘Down with the war’, 55,000 metalworkers in 40 larger companies in Berlin stopped work in protest. In several other places, sympathisers followed their example (Chickering 1998/2002, pp. 189 f.). From then on, the number and the length of the strikes rose.”翻译为中文","output":"该法律的颁布不仅使得可以起诉组织和个人；该法律还使得可以对特定地区实行戒严状态。这使得可以驱逐工人领袖。并非所有组织都被禁止，但在所谓的“社会主义法”实施的十一年间，共有322个协会被禁止。“被判处831年的监禁，893人被驱逐（其中一些人多次被驱逐）”（Tenfelde 1987，第148页，基于Auer 1913，第354-363页）。镇压的严厉程度因地区而异。在几个南德意志城镇，社会民主党人设法加入了市民委员会。在其他地方，成立了被禁党派的合法分支机构，称为“工人选举协会”。当斯图加特的木匠们在1883年罢工以捍卫十小时工作日时，这场罢工蔓延到了整个符腾堡。 尽管镇压对个人来说是压抑的，“社会主义法”总体上被证明在政治上无效，甚至适得其反。这一切从一系列工会解散组织，从而将其现金余额存入储蓄账户开始。然后社会民主党开展了一场活泼而非常成功的宣传活动。这种“非公开的公关工作”的中心是在瑞士流亡并生产的期刊《社会民主党人》，然后——正如弗里德里希·恩格斯讽刺而得意地写道，“违背并嘲笑所有帝国和国家的立法”（《社会民主党人》第39期；引用Friedemann 1978，第67页）——该期刊每周都渗透到帝国领土，无意中得到了帝国邮政的协助。 在废除社会主义法（1890年1月）之后，社会民主主义和工会成为了一个群众运动。越来越多的女性也加入了这些组织。1912年，有425万（34.8%）的选民投票支持社会民主党候选人进入帝国议会（Nipperdey 1998，第555页）。 在社会主义法仍然有效的时候，帝国议会通过了标志着从国家救济院政策转向国家社会政策的法律。回顾过去，俾斯麦的社会保障看起来远不如其精磨的形象那样宏伟。尽管如此，它标志着一个转折点。因为与之前建立的工会救济基金（Hilfskassen）不同，社会保险不再基于团结而是基于风险计算。这样，它将工业资本主义工作生活中的典型损害变成了随机事件，或更准确地说，变成了统计可计算的风险。尽管这样的风险是由现行经济秩序引起和决定的——毕竟，例如，“老年”只有在工作条件使工人无法为自己的晚年提供保障以及家庭纽带因迁移而削弱导致的随后义务时，才会成为一个风险——十九世纪晚期的社会保险并没有涵盖正是由资本主义经济周期的变迁所特别引发的特定风险：直到几十年后，才能对失业进行保险。 保险的特征不在于它将个人损失的负担重新分配给一个团体，而在于它允许这种重新分配不是以重新分配或福利的形式进行，而是根据一个规则进行，这是一个正义的规则，一种法律规范。 通过使有权获得保险福利的雇佣劳工免受为救济受益者保留的警察控制，并同时避免了因个人过错而受到的责难，社会保障体系在有需要的雇佣劳工和其他穷人之间创造了明确的区别。无论其福利多么微薄，它都滋养了十九世纪末社会民主工人阶级中广泛存在的特定社会上升希望（Gerstenberger 1981，第57-59页）。尽管社会保障的微薄福利几乎不足以在政治上整合雇佣劳工，但对穷人和工人的行政区分却创造了将产生长期影响的整合条件。 这并没有从根本上改变对罢工和抗议的雇佣劳工使用国家暴力的做法。1890年和1899年，政府应商界圈子的要求，提出了旨在大幅加强第53条的法案。即使是呼吁罢工也将成为违法行为。而随着1899年提交的草案，被称为“监狱法案”，“煽动者”可被判处最高五年监禁。至于这项法案的拒绝，佩特拉·韦伯指出，当时大多数帝国议会成员已然接受了工会的存在。因此，1906年一项将严重限制工会行动范围的法案未能通过（Weber 2010，第31页）。 与大多数议会成员不同，大多数工业家根本还没能接受工会。的确，不仅在反社会主义法有效期间和之前，而且在它被废除之后，他们都能指望当地警察和额外的军事支持对付罢工者。这将工业行动变成了战争状态。武器并不总是实际使用，但在1899年的矿工罢工中，有11名罢工者死亡，26人严重受伤（Weber 2010，第30页）。 在1870年代，通过对工业法典第152条授予的结社权利的解释以及对第153条的限制，这种做法不仅得以继续，而且大大加强。在罢工期间的常见做法，如嘲笑替工者，被视为侮辱、胁迫或人身伤害。定罪的频率根据政治和经济形势而变化，但总体上呈上升趋势。同时，法院加重了判决的严厉程度。在1903年至1912年间，由于违反工业法典第153条的罪行，超过6000名工人被判处监禁。一些人被判处短期刑罚，但少数人接受了最高三个月的判决（Saul 1974，第263页）。为了防止罢工的爆发，德国法院像美国法院一样使用了“临时禁令”（在德国当时称为Einhaltbefehl或“停止命令”）。这些禁令，伴随着威胁或重罚或长期监禁，尤其常用于对抵制呼吁的部署（Saul 1974，第249页）。 罢工监视对于进行罢工几乎是必不可少的。为了阻止罢工监视，政府经常诉诸于街道警察规定。要求罢工监视者离开。如果他们拒绝，他们将被逮捕，通常直到第二天才释放。并非所有法院都支持这些警察措施的合法性，但普鲁士上诉法院确实如此。 如此明显的阶级司法清楚地表明，虽然社会民主党在帝国议会的存在使通过压制性法律变得不可能或至少更加困难，但这种存在并未阻止国家暴力实际上被用来反对工人利益的维护。尽管如此，压制性的司法实践并未阻止工会和罢工的传播。这种力量的增长不仅体现在企业家努力克服自己协会之前的碎片化上。1910年，《德国工业家中央协会》（Centralverband Deutscher Industrieller）的常务董事表示，现在的任务是“粉碎、瓦解并消灭工会”。为实现这一目标，该协会鼓动废除结社权利。一些工会成员想用大罢工来对抗这一点，但他们中的大多数领导人相信帝国议会多数派会抵制这样的举动。战争的开始使他们免于做出这一决定。 1914年8月1日，德国政府下达了动员令，8月2日，德国军队占领了卢森堡。同一天，德国工会的管理委员会决定支持德国的战争努力。在战争期间应避免罢工，因此应普遍维持一般“休战”（Burgfrieden）。8月3日，德军入侵比利时。8月4日，德国社会民主党团体在德国帝国议会批准了战争贷款。 工人组织宣布的“休战”旨在支持抵御俄国，预防组织禁令，并帮助实现工会尚未实现的政治承认。事实上，早在1914年8月，工会代表就被召集参与讨论食品问题、创造就业问题和其他由战争新造成的问题。在军事当局的压力下，生产军备的工业家也被迫与工会代表进行谈判，以解决劳动力短缺问题（Schönhoven 1987，第254页）。 1916年12月2日通过的《辅助服务法》意味着德国国家承认工会为谈判伙伴。 这是有代价的。该法律限制了就业的自由选择。男性在对战争至关重要的企业和政府机构中被强制劳动。劳动需求的管理转交给了仲裁委员会，在其中工人和雇员与企业家在军事监督下平等代表。当然，无法为熟练工人短缺找到补救措施。而从平等地位争取相互利益的谈判的制度化，经过长期争取后实现，将工会变成了战争经济的工具。这限制了它们的行动范围（Schönhoven 1987，第259-261页）。 这一切发生在不仅战争初期的热情在民众中消退，而且对战争和休战的批评在帝国议会派系和一些社会民主主义地方协会中增长之时。在柏林五一节集会上向示威者呼喊“打倒战争”的卡尔·李卜克内西特被判处四年监禁后，柏林40家较大公司的5万5000名金属工人停工抗议。在其他一些地方，同情者效仿了他们的榜样（Chickering 1998/2002，第189-190页）。从那时起，罢工的数量和持续时间增加了。"},{"instruction":"please add detailed comments to this code: from cryptography.fernet import Fernet input_file_path = r\\"C:UsersadamDesktopnote1.txt\\" encrypted_file_path = r\\"C:UsersadamDesktopnote2.txt\\" decrypted_file_path = r\\"C:UsersadamDesktopnote3.txt\\" key_file_path = r\\"C:UsersadamDesktopkey.key\\" # Path to save the key def generate_and_save_key(): key = Fernet.generate_key() with open(key_file_path, “wb”) as key_file: key_file.write(key) return key def load_key(): return open(key_file_path, “rb”).read() def encrypt_file(file_path, encrypted_file_path, key): f = Fernet(key) with open(file_path, “rb”) as file: file_data = file.read() encrypted_data = f.encrypt(file_data) with open(encrypted_file_path, “wb”) as file: file.write(encrypted_data) def decrypt_file(encrypted_file_path, decrypted_file_path, key): f = Fernet(key) with open(encrypted_file_path, “rb”) as file: encrypted_data = file.read() decrypted_data = f.decrypt(encrypted_data) with open(decrypted_file_path, “wb”) as file: file.write(decrypted_data) # Generate and save the key only once generate_and_save_key() # Load the key key = load_key() # Encrypt the file encrypt_file(input_file_path, encrypted_file_path, key) print(f\\"{input_file_path} has been encrypted.“) # Decrypt the file decrypt_file(encrypted_file_path, decrypted_file_path, key) print(f”{decrypted_file_path} has been decrypted.\\")","output":"Certainly!

This step is critical for maintaining data uniformity and security integrity. - **Load Key**: The script then reloads this key for use in subsequent encryption and decryption processes. - **Encrypt**: Takes an input file (\`input_file_path\`), encrypts its content, and saves it to a new file (\`encrypted_file_path\`). - **Decrypt**: It then decrypts the previously encrypted file and saves the decrypted data back to another new file (\`decrypted_file_path\`). # Security Considerations - The use of a symmetric encryption scheme like Fernet implies the necessity of key security. If the key is lost or compromised, encrypted data cannot be decrypted, and if unauthorized parties access the key, they can decrypt any encrypted data. # Output - As a confirmation of the operations performed, it prints messages to inform the user that encryption and decryption have been successfully executed.

A buffer solution is one that resists changes in pH upon the addition of small amounts of acid or base. The effectiveness of a buffer hinges on the presence of a weak acid and its conjugate base in appreciable concentrations. **Understanding the Components**: - **Ascorbic Acid** (Vitamin C): A weak acid with a pKa of around 4.2. This means it will partially dissociate in water. - **Oxalic Acid**: Another weak acid, with the first pKa around 1.27 and the second pKa around 4.27. It is important to note that while oxalic acid can contribute to buffering action, its first dissociation step is much stronger than ascorbic acid, and its direct utility in buffering ascorbic acid might be limited because they have similar pKa values for their relevant dissociation states (the second pKa of oxalic acid is close to the pKa of ascorbic acid). - **Trisodium Phosphate (TSP)**: This is a salt that upon dissolving in water will increase the solution's pH by releasing sodium ions (Na⁺) and phosphate ions (PO₄³⁻). Phosphate ions can form several species in solution (HPO₄²⁻, H₂PO₄⁻, and PO₄³⁻), depending on the pH, and these can act as either a weak acid or a weak base, making phosphate a good buffering agent over a wide range of pH levels. The pKa values relevant for phosphate buffering action are approximately 2.15, 7.20, and 12.35 (for the three dissociation steps of phosphoric acid), which makes it versatile. **Steps To Create The Buffer**: 1. **Determine Your Desired pH Range**: Since the focus is on buffering ascorbic acid, you may want it in a range just above its pKa (4.2), where the buffering capacity will be significant. A typical buffer for ascorbic acid might ideally be within the pH range of about 3.5 to 5, to keep the ascorbic acid mostly in its undissociated form but still maintain close proximity to its pKa for buffering capacity. 2. **Selection of Components**: Given the chosen pH range, trisodium phosphate can serve as the alkaline agent that, when partially neutralized with a weak acid, can form the conjugate acid/base pair necessary for an effective buffer. Given that oxalic acid's second pKa is close to ascorbic acid's, it might not be the best choice for creating a conjugate system with trisodium phosphate for buffering specifically at ascorbic acid's pKa. 3. **Preparing the Buffer**: a. Dissolve trisodium phosphate in water to create a basic solution. The exact concentration will depend on your desired buffer capacity and volume. b. Carefully add a strong acid (like HCl) to bring down the pH to just above 4.2, the pKa of ascorbic acid. This step is adjusted based on your specific goal and the intended use of the buffer. The objective is to adjust the ratio of HPO₄²⁻ to H₂PO₄⁻ for the pH you target. c. Confirm the pH after adjustments using a pH meter, making minor corrections as needed. **Conclusion**: While both oxalic acid and trisodium phosphate could theoretically participate in a buffer system for ascorbic acid, in practice, focusing on the use of trisodium phosphate adjusted to the proper pH for ascorbic acid buffering seems more straightforward and effective. Oxalic acid's close pKa might not offer the broad buffer range desired without complicating the system unnecessarily, especially since its effectiveness as part of a buffering system is more limited at the pH appropriate for stabilizing ascorbic acid."},{"instruction":"if i want to control the ascorbic acid pH to 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, what buffer solution should i use in this case? propose some articles supporting your claim","output":"To control the pH of an ascorbic acid solution across a wide range of pH levels (4, 5, 6, 7, 8), you would need to use different buffers that are effective in those specific pH ranges.

This reaction is of particular interest not only because it helps elucidate the oxidative degradation mechanisms of vital biological molecules like vitamin C (ascorbic acid) but also due to its implications in understanding oxidative stress within living organisms and the preservation of food and pharmaceutical products. **Mechanism Overview:** The oxidation of ascorbic acid by iron can be broadly divided into two major steps: the reduction of iron and the subsequent oxidation of ascorbic acid. Iron typically exists in two oxidation states in biological systems: Fe²⁺ (ferrous) and Fe³⁺ (ferric). The catalytic cycle involves both these forms. Here’s a simplified description of the mechanism: 1. **Reduction of Iron (Fe³⁺ to Fe²⁺)**: The process begins with ascorbic acid reducing Fe³⁺ to Fe²⁺. Ascorbic acid, being a strong reducing agent, donates an electron to the Fe³⁺ ion. [ text{Fe}^{3+} + text{Asc}^- rightarrow text{Fe}^{2+} + text{Dehydroascorbic acid} ] In this reaction, ascorbic acid becomes oxidized to dehydroascorbic acid. 2. **Oxidation by Oxygen**: The reduced Fe²⁺ can then react with molecular oxygen (O₂) in a subsequent step. This generates reactive oxygen species (ROS) such as superoxide (text{O}_2^-) and hydroxyl radicals (•OH). The formation of these species can further react with ascorbic acid, accelerating its oxidation. [ text{Fe}^{2+} + text{O}_2 rightarrow text{Fe}^{3+} + text{O}_2^- ] The superoxide generated can dismutate to hydrogen peroxide ((text{H}_2text{O}_2)), especially in the presence of superoxide dismutase (SOD), an enzyme present in biological systems. Hydrogen peroxide can further react with Fe²⁺ in the Fenton reaction, producing more hydroxyl radicals, which are highly reactive. [ text{Fe}^{2+} + text{H}_2text{O}_2 rightarrow text{Fe}^{3+} + text{OH}^- + text{•OH} ] 3. **Oxidation of Ascorbic Acid by ROS**: The reactive oxygen species, particularly hydroxyl radicals, can oxidize ascorbic acid, leading to its degradation. This reaction is very fast and non-specific, capable of damaging a wide range of biological molecules. The overall process can be seen as a catalytic cycle where Fe³⁺ is reduced to Fe²⁺ by ascorbic acid, and Fe²⁺ is reoxidized to Fe³⁺ by molecular oxygen, with the generation of reactive oxygen species that further oxidize ascorbic acid and other organic compounds. **Implications**: This iron-catalyzed oxidation of ascorbic acid is significant in various contexts: - **Nutritional and Food Chemistry**: Understanding how trace amounts of metals can catalyze the degradation of vitamins and antioxidants like ascorbic acid is crucial for food preservation and the development of food additives that can chelate these metal ions or scavenge the produced ROS. - **Biological Systems**: In biological contexts, this process underlines the importance of iron homeostasis and the potential deleterious effects of free iron in promoting oxidative stress, contributing to cellular damage and diseases. - **Pharmaceutical Stability**: For pharmaceutical formulations containing ascorbic acid, understanding and preventing its iron-catalyzed oxidation is essential to ensure shelf-life and efficacy. The intricate balance between antioxidants and pro-oxidants, including metal ions like iron, plays a critical role in the oxidative stability of chemical and biological systems."},{"instruction":"Ascorbic acid, being a strong reducing agent is it because that ascorbic acid is a acid so it donates electron? if so, can you further explain the phenomenon more clearly?","output":"The reducing power of ascorbic acid, commonly known as vitamin C, is not primarily because it is an acid but due to its molecular structure and the presence of electron-rich areas that can easily donate electrons to other molecules, thus reducing them. The term \\"acid\\" in its name refers to its ability to donate protons (H⁺ ions) in certain reactions, which is a different property from its ability to act as a reducing agent. Let's delve into the reasons behind ascorbic acid's role as a strong reducing agent: # Molecular Structure of Ascorbic Acid 1. **Enediol Structure**: The molecule of ascorbic acid contains an enediol group, a chemical structure consisting of two hydroxyl groups (-OH) attached to carbon atoms double-bonded to each other (C=C). This enediol group is highly reactive due to the presence of pi electrons in the double bond and lone pairs of electrons on the oxygen atoms. These electrons make the molecule an excellent reducing agent because they can be readily donated to other molecules in a redox reaction. 2. **Resonance Stabilization**: Upon donating electrons, the ascorbic acid molecule forms a resonance-stabilized dehydroascorbic acid. This stabilization occurs because the resulting molecule can distribute the positive charge over its structure through resonance, stabilizing the oxidized form. The ability of a molecule to stabilize its oxidized form through resonance is a hallmark of good reducing agents. # Electron Donation in Redox Reactions Redox reactions are chemical processes that involve the transfer of electrons from one molecule (the reductant or reducing agent) to another (the oxidant or oxidizing agent). In the case of ascorbic acid: 1. **Electron Donation**: When ascorbic acid acts as a reducing agent, it donates electrons to another molecule. This donation reduces the other molecule, which means that the molecule gains electrons and its oxidation state is lowered. 2. **Not Proton Donation**: This electron donation should not be confused with the donation of protons (H⁺) that acids are known for. The reduction potential of ascorbic acid is based on its ability to undergo specific chemical changes that involve electron transfer, not proton transfer. Acid strength, in contrast, is determined by the tendency of a compound to donate protons to water or other bases. # Conclusion Thus, the property of ascorbic acid as a strong reducing agent is mainly due to the presence of an enediol group in its structure, allowing easy electron donation to reduce other molecules, rather than its acidic properties per se. This electron-donating capacity underlies its biological functions, including its role as an antioxidant in neutralizing free radicals and reactive oxygen species by effectively donating electrons to these reactive molecules, preventing them from causing cellular damage."},{"instruction":"why enediol group allows this?","output":"The enediol group in molecules like ascorbic acid plays a crucial role in their chemistry, particularly their ability to act as strong reducing agents. This is primarily due to the specific structure and electronic properties of the enediol moiety. Let's break down why the enediol group enables such reactivity: # Electron-rich Nature 1. **Presence of π Electrons**: The double bond between the two carbon atoms in the enediol group contains π (pi) electrons that are less tightly bound than σ (sigma) electrons involved in single carbon-carbon bonds. These π electrons are more readily available for chemical reactions, making enediol compounds reactive. 2. **Lone Pair on Oxygen Atoms**: Each hydroxyl (OH) group in the enediol structure also contains oxygen atoms with lone pairs of electrons. These non-bonding electrons further contribute to the electron-rich nature of the group, increasing its reactivity and reducing power. # Stabilization via Resonance The enediol structure can participate in resonance stabilization. This means that the electrons in the molecule can be delocalized over the structure, spreading out the electron density. This delocalization results from the molecule's ability to form several resonance structures, each depicting a different arrangement of electrons. - In the context of ascorbic acid, after the donation of electrons, the resulting species (the oxidized form of ascorbic acid, also known as dehydroascorbic acid) benefits from resonance stabilization. This distributes the positive charge throughout the molecule, mitigating the energetic cost of electron donation and stabilizing the oxidized form. # Redox Chemistry The chemical attributes of the enediol group facilitate redox reactions where these groups can donate electrons to other molecules (acting as reducing agents). The process typically involves: 1. **Electron Transfer**: The electron-rich enediol moiety donates electrons to an electron-deficient species (oxidizing agent), reducing it. This process involves the breaking of the π bond in the double bond between the two carbon atoms. 2. **Oxidation of Enediol**: Concurrently, the enediol group is oxidized. This often leads to the formation of a carbonyl group (C=O) from the original hydroxyl (OH) group, transforming the enediol structure in the process. 3. **Product Stabilization**: The oxidized product is stabilized through resonance, as mentioned, making the initial electron donation energetically favorable. # Biological Relevance In biological systems, molecules featuring enediol groups, like ascorbic acid (Vitamin C), are powerful antioxidants. They can donate electrons to reactive oxygen species (ROS) and other free radicals, neutralizing them and preventing potentially damaging oxidative stress within cells. # Conclusion The enediol group's ability to act as a strong reducing agent is fundamentally tied to its electron-rich nature, which facilitates electron donation, and its capacity for resonance stabilization, which stabilizes the molecule after electron donation. These characteristics make enediol-containing compounds significant in both chemistry and biology, particularly for their roles in redox reactions and as antioxidants."},{"instruction":"HEPES buffer","output":"HEPES (4-(2-hydroxyethyl)-1-piperazineethanesulfonic acid) is a zwitterionic sulfonic acid used extensively in biological research as a buffering agent. HEPES is part of the Good's buffers, named after Norman Good, who identified several buffering agents with optimal characteristics for biological systems in the 1960s. These characteristics include a pKa close to physiological pH (7.2–7.4), minimal solubility in lipids (thus they do not easily cross cell membranes), limited interaction with biological molecules, and stability over time. # Properties of HEPES - **Chemical Formula**: C₈H₁₈N₂O₄S - **Molecular Weight**: 238.31 g/mol - **pKa**: ~7.5 at 20°C (making it an excellent buffer for pH ranges around 7, suitable for many biological systems) - **Solubility**: Highly soluble in water # Advantages of Using HEPES Buffer 1. **Stability**: HEPES is chemically stable, ensuring that the pH of solutions remains consistent over time. This stability is crucial for experiments requiring sustained pH conditions. 2. **Minimal Interaction**: It has minimal interaction with biological processes, meaning it does not interfere significantly with biochemical reactions or bind to metals, making it an ideal choice for cell culture media and enzyme assays. 3. **Wide pH Buffering Range**: Effective in the pH range of 6.8 to 8.2, covering many physiological conditions and experimental needs in vitro. 4. **Mitigates pH Changes due to CO₂**: In environments not precisely controlled for CO₂ levels, which can acidify media by dissolving into carbonic acid, HEPES helps maintain a stable pH, an advantage especially outside CO₂ incubators where bicarbonate buffering is ineffective. # Applications of HEPES Buffer in Research - **Cell Culture**: HEPES is frequently added to cell culture media to maintain a stable pH, especially when cultures are not maintained in a CO₂ incubator. - **Biochemical and Molecular Biology Experiments**: Used in buffers for DNA and RNA extraction, protein purification, and various enzymatic reactions. - **Electrophysiology**: Employed in solutions for electrophysiological recordings where precise pH control is necessary. # Considerations when Using HEPES - **Autoclaving**: While HEPES can be autoclaved, autoclaving solutions containing HEPES can sometimes lead to the formation of toxic by-products. It's often recommended to filter-sterilize HEPES-containing solutions instead. - **Cost**: HEPES is more expensive than some other buffers, such as phosphate-buffered saline (PBS), which may limit its use in large-scale applications. - **Metal Ion Binding**: Although HEPES has low metal-binding activity, certain sensitive experiments may require consideration of this aspect. # Preparing a HEPES Buffer Solution The preparation of a HEPES buffer typically involves dissolving the required amount of HEPES in deionized water, adjusting the pH to the desired value with NaOH or HCl, and adjusting the solution to the final desired volume. The concentration of HEPES in biological experiments commonly ranges from 10 to 50 mM, depending on the specific requirements of the experiment. # Conclusion HEPES buffer is a versatile tool in biological research, offering stability and reliability across a range of experimental conditions. Its ability to maintain physiological pH with minimal interference in biological reactions makes it invaluable for a broad spectrum of applications in cell biology, molecular biology, and biochemistry."},{"instruction":"2. Lone Pair on Oxygen Atoms: Each hydroxyl (OH) group in the enediol structure also contains oxygen atoms with lone pairs of electrons. These non-bonding electrons further contribute to the electron-rich nature of the group, increasing its reactivity and reducing power. why, could you explain?","output":"The lone pairs on the oxygen atoms of each hydroxyl (OH) group in an enediol structure contribute to its electron-rich nature and, consequently, its reactivity and reducing power. This can be explained through several interconnected chemical principles: # 1. Electron Donor Ability Lone pairs of electrons on oxygen atoms make the molecule an electron donor. These non-bonding electrons are not involved in bonding with another atom and hence are more readily available to be shared or transferred. In chemical reactions, especially redox reactions, the ability to donate electrons is a key aspect of a reducing agent. The enediol structure, with its lone pairs on oxygen, thus becomes very reactive as it can readily donate electrons to electron-deficient species (oxidizers). # 2. Polarization Effects The presence of oxygen atoms, which are highly electronegative, alongside the lone pairs, leads to a polarization effect. The oxygen atoms pull electron density towards themselves, making the adjacent carbon atoms in the enediol structure more positive. This polarization facilitates the breaking of the C=C bond during the electron donation process, making the transfer of electrons to an oxidizing agent more feasible. # 3. Resonance Stabilization Lone pairs on oxygen contribute to the resonance stabilization of the molecule, allowing for delocalization of electron density across the structure. This delocalization occurs because the lone pairs can participate in resonance, forming structures where the pi electrons are spread over the molecule, including the oxygen atoms. This effect stabilizes the molecule both before and after it acts as a reducing agent, making electron donation energetically favorable. This stability is crucial for a molecule to act effectively as a reducing agent, as it reduces the energy cost of electron donation. # 4. Formation of Hydrogen Bonds The electron-rich oxygen atoms can also engage in hydrogen bonding with other molecules, including water. This interaction can increase the solubility of the compound in aqueous solutions and may affect its reactivity in biological systems or aqueous media where hydrogen bonding is prevalent. Increased solubility might facilitate the transport of the reducing agent to the site of action, enhancing its effectiveness in biological or aqueous environments. # Conclusion Overall, the electron-rich nature conferred by the lone pairs on oxygen atoms directly contributes to the reactivity and reducing power of molecules with enediol groups. This results from a combination of enhanced electron donation capabilities, polarization effects that facilitate certain chemical reactions, resonance stabilization which makes electron donation more energetically favorable, and the potential for increased hydrogen bonding interactions that can affect solubility and transport properties. These characteristics are important for understanding the behavior of reducing agents like ascorbic acid in various chemical and biological contexts."},{"instruction":"why is oxidation of ascorbic acid catalyzed by iron ions but not directly oxidized by iron?","output":"The oxidation of ascorbic acid in the presence of iron ions is a classic example of a redox reaction where iron acts as a catalyst rather than a direct oxidant. This process primarily involves the iron ions facilitating the transfer of electrons from ascorbic acid to oxygen (or another electron acceptor), leading to the oxidation of ascorbic acid. Let's delve into why iron ions catalyze this reaction rather than directly oxidizing ascorbic acid: # Iron Ions as Catalysts 1. **Role of Catalyst**: A catalyst speeds up a chemical reaction without being consumed in the process. Iron ions (both Fe²⁺ and Fe³⁺) can cyclically interchange between their oxidation states, thereby speeding up the oxidation of ascorbic acid by transferring electrons from the ascorbic acid to oxygen, regenerating the iron ion in its initial state at the end of the reaction cycle. 2. **Reduction-Oxidation Cycles**: In the presence of oxygen, Fe²⁺ is oxidized to Fe³⁺, with the concomitant reduction of oxygen to water or hydrogen peroxide, depending on conditions. Ascorbic acid can reduce Fe³⁺ back to Fe²⁺, completing the cycle. These cycles allow for the efficient transfer of electrons, facilitating the rapid oxidation of ascorbic acid. # Why Not Direct Oxidation? 1. **Energy Considerations**: Direct chemical reactions between ascorbic acid and iron ions to form a direct bond (oxidizing ascorbic acid by incorporating iron into its structure) would be energetically unfavorable and chemically implausible under physiological or typical environmental conditions. Such a reaction would not only be slower but might also result in less stable products. 2. **Reaction Specificity**: Iron ions in biological settings are often complexed with proteins, enzymes, or other ligands that manage their reactivity. These complexes are specifically designed to facilitate electron transfer reactions rather than forming new chemical bonds with substrates like ascorbic acid. 3. **Nature of Biological Oxidants**: In biological systems, the primary oxidants of ascorbic acid are not metal ions themselves but reactive oxygen species (ROS) like hydrogen peroxide or superoxide, which can be produced or regulated by metal-catalyzed reactions. Iron's role is more about balancing electron flows in such processes than directly oxidizing molecules like ascorbic acid. # Mechanistic Insight The catalytic oxidation of ascorbic acid by iron involves several key steps: - **Step 1**: Fe²⁺ is oxidized by molecular oxygen to Fe³⁺, with the formation of superoxide radical ((O_2^•-)). - **Step 2**: Ascorbic acid reduces Fe³⁺ back to Fe²⁺ while itself becoming oxidized to dehydroascorbic acid. - **Step 3**: The superoxide radical and other reactive oxygen species generated in the reaction can further react with ascorbic acid, contributing to its oxidation. # Conclusion The action of iron ions in catalyzing the oxidation of ascorbic acid rather than directly oxidizing it showcases the nuanced role of metal ions in biochemical processes. It emphasizes the importance of catalysis in biological redox reactions, where the transfer of electrons facilitated by metal ions enables complex biochemical pathways to proceed efficiently under conditions that are compatible with life."},{"instruction":"why by my research, ascorbic acid, after the reduction with iron, only turns to monodehydroascorbic acid instead of dehydroascorbic acid?","output":"The oxidation of ascorbic acid (Vitamin C) in the presence of iron ions can lead to various oxidized forms, and the specific outcome depends on multiple factors including the reaction conditions, the concentration of reactants, and the presence of other catalytic or interfering substances. When ascorbic acid acts as a reducing agent for iron ions, its first oxidized product is indeed monodehydroascorbic acid, not directly dehydroascorbic acid as might be expected in the simplest case. This specificity can be explained by the reaction mechanism and the inherent stability of the intermediate product. # Understanding the Oxidation Steps 1. **First Oxidation Step**: Ascorbic acid is a strong reducing agent due to its ability to donate electrons. When it reduces iron (usually from Fe³⁺ to Fe²⁺), it loses two hydrogen atoms (one electron from each hydrogen atom) in the process. The first product of this oxidation is monodehydroascorbic acid, which involves the loss of one hydrogen atom and the formation of a radical or a double bond, depending on the representation. 2. **Second Oxidation Step**: Monodehydroascorbic acid can further lose another hydrogen atom to form dehydroascorbic acid. However, this second step might require different conditions or may proceed at a different rate, making the accumulation of monodehydroascorbic acid possible under certain conditions before it is further oxidized to dehydroascorbic acid. # Factors Affecting the Oxidation Pathway - **Reaction Environment**: pH, temperature, and oxygen concentration can significantly impact the oxidation steps and the stability of the intermediates. - **Concentration of Iron**: The ratio of iron ions to ascorbic acid molecules can influence which oxidation products predominate, as excess iron might facilitate further oxidation whereas limited iron might lead to a predominance of the first oxidation product. - **Presence of Other Catalysts or Inhibitors**: Other substances in the reaction mixture may catalyze further oxidation or stabilize intermediates, affecting the progression from ascorbic acid to monodehydroascorbic acid and then to dehydroascorbic acid. # Stability and Reactivity of Monodehydroascorbic Acid Monodehydroascorbic acid exists in equilibrium with its hydrated form and can rapidly convert to dehydroascorbic acid under specific conditions. However, this conversion might not be as immediate or direct as the initial reduction step catalyzed by iron. Furthermore, some experimental conditions could lead to the preferential accumulation of monodehydroascorbic acid, especially if the subsequent oxidation to dehydroascorbic acid is slower or if monodehydroascorbic acid is being continuously regenerated from dehydroascorbic acid in a dynamic equilibrium. # Conclusion The observation that ascorbic acid first turns into monodehydroascorbic acid rather than directly into dehydroascorbic acid in the presence of iron highlights the multi-step nature of the oxidation process and the potential for intermediate products to be stable or accumulate under certain conditions. Understanding these nuances is important for interpreting results in research involving ascorbic acid's redox chemistry, especially in biological and environmental contexts where multiple reaction pathways may coexist."},{"instruction":"research question: how does varying the pH affect the mechanism of the Fe3+ catalyzed oxidation of vitamin C what research background should i provide? can youv propose a full experimental design?","output":"Researching how varying pH levels affect the mechanism of Fe³⁺-catalyzed oxidation of vitamin C (ascorbic acid) involves understanding both the redox behavior of ascorbic acid and the speciation of iron ions under different pH conditions.

This redox flexibility enables iron to participate actively in a variety of metabolic processes, including oxygen transport (hemoglobin and myoglobin), electron transfer (cytochromes), and enzyme catalysis. The Fe²⁺/Fe³⁺ redox couple is particularly important for catalysis. Iron's ability to switch between these states allows it to act as an electron mediator, facilitating the transfer of electrons in redox reactions. For instance, in the oxidation of ascorbic acid, Fe³⁺ can accept an electron from ascorbic acid (reducing it to Fe²⁺) and then transfer this electron to an acceptor molecule such as oxygen (returning to Fe³⁺). This redox cycling not only amplifies the rate of oxidation of ascorbic acid but also underpins the broader roles of iron in biochemical electron transfer pathways. # pH Influence on Redox Reactions The pH of a solution can significantly affect redox reactions, influencing both the speciation of metal ions like iron and the stability/reactivity of molecules such as ascorbic acid. The chemistry of iron in solution is particularly pH-dependent, with Fe³⁺ more stable in acidic conditions and Fe²⁺ in slightly more alkaline conditions. The pH can alter the charge and solubility of iron species, thus influencing their ability to participate in redox reactions. For ascorbic acid, the pH determines the molecule's ionization state, affecting its reactivity. Ascorbic acid is more readily oxidized in its deprotonated form, which is prevalent at higher pH levels. Therefore, the proton concentration (pH) shifts the equilibrium position of redox reactions, impacting both the rates and the mechanisms of these reactions. At different pH levels, the propensity of ascorbic acid to donate electrons changes, as does the efficiency with which iron can catalyze the oxidation reaction.

These ions can act as electron transfer mediators, facilitating the transfer of electrons from ascorbic acid (a reducing agent) to an electron acceptor (typically molecular oxygen in biological systems). The process involves several steps, predominantly characterized by the redox cycling of the metal ion catalysts. Here is a simplified overview focusing on the general mechanism: # 1. Initial Reduction of Metal Ion The process begins with the metal ion in a higher oxidation state (e.g., Fe³⁺) accepting an electron from ascorbic acid. Ascorbic acid is oxidized in this process, losing an electron, which can be conceptualized as it losing a pair of hydrogen atoms (one as a proton and one as an electron, becoming a dehydroascorbic acid molecule or a similar oxidized species). [ text{Ascorbic Acid} + text{Fe}^{3+} rightarrow text{Dehydroascorbic Acid} + text{Fe}^{2+} ] # 2. Metal Ion Redox Cycling Once reduced (e.g., Fe²⁺), the metal ion can then interact with a molecule of oxygen (or another electron acceptor available in the system). The reduced metal ion donates an electron to the oxygen, possibly leading to the formation of superoxide anion (O₂⁻) or another partially reduced form of oxygen, while the metal ion is oxidized back to its original state (e.g., Fe³⁺). [ text{Fe}^{2+} + text{O}_2 rightarrow text{Fe}^{3+} + text{O}_2^{-} ] # 3. Formation of Reactive Oxygen Species (ROS) The interaction with oxygen not only regenerates the metal ion catalyst but can also lead to the formation of various reactive oxygen species (ROS), such as superoxide anions, hydrogen peroxide (H₂O₂), and hydroxyl radicals (•OH). These ROS can further react with ascorbic acid, enhancing its oxidation rate beyond what occurs through direct interaction with the metal ion alone. # Factors Influencing Catalysis - **Type of Metal Ion**: Different metal ions have different redox potentials, affecting their efficiency in catalyzing the oxidation of ascorbic acid. Iron (Fe) and copper (Cu) are particularly effective because of their suitable redox potentials and availability in biological systems. - **Oxidation State of the Metal**: The catalytic activity depends on the oxidation states of the metal ion that can participate in redox cycling. - **pH of the Solution**: The speciation of metal ions and the stability of ascorbic acid and its oxidized forms are pH-dependent, influencing the reaction rates. - **Concentration of Oxygen**: The availability of molecular oxygen is crucial for the regeneration of the metal ion and the formation of ROS, determining the overall rate of ascorbic acid oxidation. # Conclusion Metal ions catalyze the oxidation of ascorbic acid through a series of redox reactions that involve the redox cycling of the metal ion between its oxidation states. This process not only directly oxidizes ascorbic acid but also generates ROS, which can further accelerate the oxidation of ascorbic acid. Understanding this catalytic mechanism is critical for uncovering the role of metal ions in biological systems and their impact on nutrient stability, oxidative stress, and various industrial processes."},{"instruction":"为什么铁离子会催化维生素C的氧化？","output":"铁离子（Fe³⁺ 和 Fe²⁺）催化维生素C（抗坏血酸）的氧化，主要是因为它们能够在不同的氧化态之间进行转换，通过接受和捐赠电子参与红ox反应（还原-氧化反应）。这一机制的关键在于铁离子能够作为一种催化剂，加速维生素C转化为其氧化形式（如脱氢抗坏血酸）的过程。下面详细解释为什么铁离子会催化维生素C的氧化： # 1. 铁离子的氧化态转换 铁离子存在两种主要的氧化态：Fe²⁺ （亚铁离子）和 Fe³⁺（铁离子）。在维生素C的存在下，Fe³⁺ 能够接受电子（从维生素C那里）转变为 Fe²⁺。这一步骤中，维生素C被氧化，失去了电子。 [ text{抗坏血酸} + text{Fe}^{3+} rightarrow text{脱氢抗坏血酸} + text{Fe}^{2+} ] # 2. 与氧反应形成活性氧种 (ROS) 随后，Fe²⁺ 可以与溶液中的氧气反应再次被氧化成 Fe³⁺，过程中可能产生超氧阴离子（O₂⁻）等活性氧种（ROS）。这些ROS进一步与维生素C反应，加速其氧化过程。 [ text{Fe}^{2+} + text{O}_2 rightarrow text{Fe}^{3+} + text{O}_2^{-} ] # 3. 铁离子催化的自由基链反应 铁离子催化的维生素C氧化过程有时候可以通过生成的活性氧种形成一种自由基链反应，进一步促进维生素C的氧化，形成更多的脱氢抗坏血酸和其他氧化产物。 # 催化作用的重要性 - **生物和化学反应中的催化剂**: 铁离子作为催化剂加速了维生素C的氧化，这在许多生物和化学反应中都有着重要意义。 - **氧化应激的研究**: 了解铁离子如何催化维生素C的氧化对于研究氧化应激、细胞损伤和疾病的机制（如神经退行性疾病和癌症）具有重要价值。 - **食品保藏和药物稳定性**: 在食品和药品行业，通过控制铁离子的水平可以帮助维持维生素C的稳定性，避免其过度氧化而降低营养价值或药效。 # 结论 综上所述，铁离子之所以能催化维生素C的氧化，是因为铁具有在不同氧化态之间转换的特性，能够有效地促进电子的转移，加速抗坏血酸向脱氢抗坏血酸的转化过程。这种催化作用及其后果在多个领域内都具有重要的科学和实际意义。"},{"instruction":"Ascorbic acid is an excellent electron-donor antioxidant. The relatively low reduction potential of ascorbate (0.19 V for DHA/AH− at pH 3.5) should allow it to be readily oxidized by molecular oxygen5. However, while this redox reaction is thermodynamically favorable, it is spin forbidden; molecular oxygen is a triplet with two unpaired electrons, while ascorbate is in the ground state5. The only ascorbate species that is capable of true autoxidation, determined after treating the solutions with Chelex resin to remove trace metals appears to be the ascorbate dianion (A2−) + O29. Because there is little A2− at pHs below ~ 10 (Table 1 R2), the autoxidation rate for ascorbate (all forms) is slow, ~ 6 × 10–7 s−1 at pH 75. We verified this as part of our measurements (not shown). what is this paragraph talking about?","output":"This paragraph is discussing the oxidative behavior of ascorbic acid (vitamin C) and how it interacts with molecular oxygen under certain conditions. Here's a breakdown of the key points it addresses: 1. **Ascorbic Acid as an Electron Donor**: It highlights that ascorbic acid is a potent antioxidant because of its ability to donate electrons. Antioxidants are substances that can prevent or slow damage to cells caused by free radicals, unstable molecules that the body produces as a reaction to environmental and other pressures. 2. **Reduction Potential of Ascorbate**: The paragraph mentions that ascorbate (the anion form of ascorbic acid) has a relatively low reduction potential of 0.19 V (versus a standard hydrogen electrode) when it exists as the dehydroascorbic acid/ascorbate anion pair (DHA/AH⁻) at pH 3.5. A low reduction potential indicates that ascorbate is easily oxidized; that is, it can readily donate electrons. 3. **Spin Forbidden Reaction with Oxygen**: Despite the thermodynamically favorable conditions for ascorbate to donate electrons to molecular oxygen (due to their respective reduction potentials), the reaction is \\"spin forbidden.\\" Molecular oxygen in its ground state is a \\"triplet,\\" meaning it has two unpaired electrons that make it paramagnetic and give it unique spin properties. Ascorbate, however, does not share these properties, which inhibits the direct reaction between ascorbic acid and molecular oxygen due to mismatches in electronic spin states. 4. **Autoxidation and Ascorbate Dianion (A²⁻)**: Autoxidation is a process where a substance is oxidized by oxygen without the involvement of an external catalyst. The paragraph points out that only the dianion form of ascorbic acid (A²⁻) appears capable of undergoing autoxidation with molecular oxygen. However, this form of ascorbate exists in significant amounts only at high pH levels (above ~10), which is atypical for most biological and environmental conditions. 5. **Slow Rate of Ascorbate Autoxidation**: Lastly, it mentions that due to the limited presence of the ascorbate dianion at physiological pH levels (such as pH 7), the overall rate of autoxidation for ascorbate in all its forms is slow, with a rate constant of approximately 6 × 10⁻⁷ s⁻¹ at pH 7. This slow rate was confirmed by the authors through their experiments, which they reference but do not show in detail. In summary, the paragraph explains why, despite the favorable conditions for ascorbic acid to act as an antioxidant by donating electrons to oxygen, the actual rate of this reaction in natural conditions is slow, primarily due to the spin forbidden nature of the reaction and the scarcity of the reactive form of ascorbate (A²⁻) at neutral pH levels."},{"instruction":"铜对维生素C是极强的氧化催化剂，只要2×10-4M/L的浓度，就能使维生素C一价阴离子的氧化反应速度增大10000倍。铁、铝等离子也可使维生素C分解 为什么？","output":"铜离子 (Cu²⁺) 能够极大地加速维生素C（即抗坏血酸）的氧化反应，主要由于其作为一种有效的电子传递媒介在氧化还原反应中的作用。铜、铁、铝等过渡金属离子由于他们的特殊性质, 在生物化学反应中经常起到催化剂的作用。下面解释为什么铜离子对维生素C的氧化有如此强的催化作用： # 1. 电子转移能力 铜离子可以容易地在不同的氧化态之间转换（Cu¹⁺ ↔ Cu²⁺），使得它成为一个极好的氧化还原催化剂。在维生素C的氧化过程中，铜离子接受维生素C的电子（将维生素C氧化），然后将电子传递给氧分子或其他接受体，从而将其还原。这种电子的传递显著加速了维生素C的氧化过程。 # 2. 氧化还原循环 铜离子的氧化态变化（如由 Cu²⁺到 Cu¹⁺再回到 Cu²⁺）创建了一个有效的催化循环，使得铜离子能够连续地催化更多的维生素C分子氧化，而自身则在反应过程中不被消耗。正是这种循环使得铜离子即使在相对较低的浓度下也可以极大地加速维生素C的氧化反应。 # 3. 自由基生成 铜和其他过渡金属离子（如铁离子Fe³⁺/Fe²⁺）的催化作用还涉及到反应中活性氧种（ROS）如超氧自由基（O₂⁻·）和过氧化氢（H₂O₂）的生成。这些活性氧种可进一步促进维生素C的氧化，导致维生素C更快地分解。 # 4. 生物化学反应中的普适性 铜、铁、铝等金属离子在自然界和生物体内广泛存在，它们的红ox特性允许它们在许多生命过程中，包括氧气传输、酶反应催化以及电子传递链等过程中发挥重要作用。同样的原理适用于非生物系统中，如食品储存和制药行业，了解这些过渡金属对维生素C催化氧化的影响对保护维生素C免于过度氧化具有实际意义。 综上所述，铜离子之所以是强大的维生素C氧化催化剂，原因在于它可以有效地参与电子传递过程，加速维生素C向氧化产物的转化。而铁、铝等过渡金属离子也因类似的原因能促进维生素C的分解。Understanding this catalytic process is crucial for applications in fields like biochemistry, food preservation, and pharmaceuticals, where oxidative stability is of great concern."},{"instruction":"me da este erro org.springframework.web.servlet.resource.NoResourceFoundException: apigateway","output":"O erro \`org.springframework.web.servlet.resource.NoResourceFoundException\` no contexto de um API Gateway geralmente indica que o gateway não conseguiu localizar um recurso especificado na solicitação.

Los balanceadores de carga actúan como intermediarios entre los usuarios (o clientes) y los servidores que alojan las aplicaciones o servicios. Cuando un usuario realiza una solicitud a un servicio, el balanceador de carga se encarga de dirigir esa solicitud a uno de los servidores disponibles, basándose en diversos algoritmos y políticas establecidas. # Funcionamiento básico: Cuando una solicitud llega al balanceador de carga, este toma una decisión sobre a qué servidor dirigir la solicitud. Esta decisión puede basarse en varios métodos, incluyendo: - **Round Robin**: Distribuye las solicitudes de manera secuencial entre todos los servidores disponibles. Es el método más sencillo y se utiliza cuando los servidores son relativamente iguales en capacidad de procesamiento. - **Menos Conexiones**: Dirige las nuevas solicitudes al servidor con el menor número de conexiones activas. Este método es útil cuando hay una gran variabilidad en el tiempo de procesamiento de las solicitudes. - **IP Hash**: Utiliza un hash de la dirección IP del cliente para determinar a qué servidor se dirige la solicitud, lo que puede ser útil para mantener la continuidad de la sesión del usuario. - **Capacidad de Servidor/CPU**: Toma en cuenta la capacidad de procesamiento de cada servidor o su uso actual de CPU para distribuir las solicitudes de manera más equitativa. # Beneficios del balanceo de carga: 1. **Alta disponibilidad y redundancia**: Distribuye las solicitudes entre múltiples servidores, lo que significa que si uno falla, las solicitudes pueden dirigirse a otro, manteniendo el servicio disponible. 2. **Escalabilidad**: Permite agregar más servidores fácilmente para manejar un aumento en la carga de trabajo sin interrumpir el servicio. 3. **Mejora del rendimiento**: Distribuye eficientemente la carga de trabajo para que ningún servidor se sobrecargue, lo que ayuda a mejorar tiempos de respuesta y rendimiento general. # Tipos de balanceo de carga: - **Balanceadores de carga de hardware**: Son dispositivos físicos diseñados específicamente para el balanceo de carga. Suelen ofrecer alto rendimiento y características avanzadas. - **Balanceadores de carga de software**: Se ejecutan en servidores comunes y proporcionan flexibilidad al poder ejecutarse en infraestructuras en la nube o en centros de datos locales.

Dependencias Faltantes Para que \`spring.cloud\` funcione, necesitas tener las dependencias apropiadas de Spring Cloud en tu proyecto. Si estas dependencias no están presentes, la configuración bajo \`spring.cloud\` no tendrá efecto. **Solución:** Asegúrate de haber incluido las dependencias de Spring Cloud en tu archivo \`pom.xml\` (si estás utilizando Maven) o en tu \`build.gradle\` (si estás utilizando Gradle). Por ejemplo, para incluir Spring Cloud Gateway necesitas algo como esto en Maven: \`\`\`xml <dependency> <groupId>org.springframework.cloud</groupId> <artifactId>spring-cloud-starter-gateway</artifactId> <version>VERSIÓN_APROPIADA</version> </dependency> \`\`\` Y en Gradle sería algo así: \`\`\`gradle implementation 'org.springframework.cloud:spring-cloud-starter-gateway:VERSIÓN_APROPIADA' \`\`\` Asegúrate de usar la versión adecuada que sea compatible con tu versión de Spring Boot. # 2. Versión Incompatible de Spring Boot o Spring Cloud Podría ser el caso de que estés utilizando una versión de Spring Cloud que no es compatible con tu versión de Spring Boot. **Solución:** Revisa la [tabla de compatibilidad de Spring Cloud con Spring Boot](https://spring.io/projects/spring-cloud#overview) para asegurarte de que tus versiones son compatibles entre sí. Actualiza tus dependencias si es necesario para corregir cualquier incompatibilidad. # 3. Errores en el Archivo de Configuración Un error tipográfico, un error en la estructura del archivo o un formato incorrecto pueden causar que las configuraciones no sean reconocidas correctamente. **Solución:** Revisa la sintaxis de tu \`application.properties\` o \`application.yml\` para asegurarte de que esté correcta.

import javafx.application.Platform; import javafx.scene.Scene; import javafx.scene.control.Label; import javafx.scene.layout.StackPane; import javafx.stage.Stage; public class UIUpdateExample extends Application { @Override public void start(Stage primaryStage) { Label label = new Label(\\"Hello, JavaFX!\\"); StackPane root = new StackPane(); root.getChildren().add(label); Scene scene = new Scene(root, 300, 250); primaryStage.setTitle(\\"UI Update Example\\"); primaryStage.setScene(scene); primaryStage.show(); // 模拟一个耗时的非UI操作 new Thread(() -> { try { // 模拟耗时操作 Thread.sleep(2000); } catch (InterruptedException e) { e.printStackTrace(); } // 现在我们需要更新UI，因此需要使用Platform.runLater Platform.runLater(() -> { // 这个操作现在在UI线程上执行 label.setText(\\"Update after background work\\"); }); }).start(); } public static void main(String[] args) { launch(args); } } \`\`\` 在上面的例子中，我们在一个新的线程中模拟了一个耗时的操作，然后使用\`Platform.runLater\`来更新一个标签的文本。这种方法保证了UI的更新是在正确的线程（UI线程）上执行的，并且避免了UI冻结的问题。"},{"instruction":"public static void updateNode(@NonNull Pane pane, @NonNull Supplier<Node> supplier) { Platform.runLater(() -> { pane.getChildren().clear();

System.err.println(\\"Task failed with exception: \\" + error.getMessage()); // 可在此更新UI以提示错误信息 } }; // 启动任务的线程 new Thread(task).start(); } \`\`\` 在这个示例中，\`Task<T>\`是一个JavaFX的类，用于定义一个会返回结果的长时间运行的任务。它有多个方法可供重写，比如\`call()\`（在后台线程执行）、\`succeeded()\`（UI线程中执行，当任务成功完成）、\`failed()\`（UI线线程执行，当任务失败）。这提供了一种优雅的方式来处理长时间运行的操作以及与UI更新相关的逻辑。 通过这种方式，我们避免了直接\\"强制刷新\\"界面的需要，而是将长时间运行的任务和UI更新封装在一个符合JavaFX设计的结构中，以安全且高效的方式进行。"},{"instruction":"告诉我怎么强制刷新","output":"在JavaFX中，通常不提倡\\"强制刷新\\"UI的做法，因为JavaFX的架构旨在确保UI的更新在应用程序的UI线程上以线程安全的方式进行。尽管如此，如果你的目标是确保UI在一些特殊情况下立即响应，以下是一些可能的解决方案和思路，但请注意，这些方法都应谨慎使用，并且要清楚它们可能带来的副作用： # 1. 使用\`Platform.runLater()\`强制更新UI 如果你的意图是确保某个任务在长操作后更新UI，那么正确的做法是使用\`Platform.runLater(Runnable)\`。这实际上并不是“强制刷新”，而是一种确保任务在UI线程上安排和执行的安全方式。这是符合JavaFX设计原则的。 # 2. 确保UI更新操作完成 在某些极端情况下，如果你需要确保一系列\`Platform.runLater()\`操作已经完成，你可能会尝试使用一个像\`CountDownLatch\`这样的同步助手来等待\`Platform.runLater()\`操作的完成。这仍然不是“强制刷新”，而是确保在某一时刻之后不再有挂起的UI更新操作。 # 3. 调用\`Node\`的\`requestLayout()\`或\`layout()\`方法 对于一些特定的UI组件，如果你需要它们根据最新的数据重新计算布局，你可以尝试调用\`Node\`的\`requestLayout()\`方法，这会标记该节点及其子节点需要重新布局，而\`layout()\`方法则会尽可能立即执行布局操作。使用这些方法时需要额外小心，因为这可能会对性能造成不良影响，尤其是在频繁调用的情况下。 \`\`\`java Platform.runLater(() -> { // 更新UI组件状态 myNode.requestLayout(); // 或者直接 myNode.layout(); }); \`\`\` # 注意 \\"强制刷新\\"并不是JavaFX官方文档或最佳实践中的概念，大多数情况下，如果你发现自己需要这么做，那么可能是因为你的程序设计存在需要重新考虑的地方。确保所有的UI更新都在JavaFX的UI线程上执行，并且通过合理的任务和事件处理，通常就可以避免UI冻结或者更新延迟的问题。 不要忘了，合理使用并发工具，如\`Task\`和\`Service\`，以及在需要时使用\`Platform.runLater()\`，通常就足以处理大多数场景下的UI更新问题。"},{"instruction":"javafx 里面的webview支持设置代理吗","output":"在JavaFX中，\`WebView\`组件使用WebEngine来渲染Web内容，它基于WebKit引擎。对于代理设置，JavaFX的\`WebView\`本身不提供直接设置代理的API。然而，你可以通过配置Java系统属性来为整个Java应用设置HTTP代理，这同样会影响到JavaFX \`WebView\`的网络请求。 在Java应用程序启动时设置代理的最简单方式是通过命令行参数。例如： \`\`\`bash java -Dhttp.proxyHost=代理服务器地址 -Dhttp.proxyPort=端口号 -Dhttps.proxyHost=代理服务器地址 -Dhttps.proxyPort=端口号 -jar your-application.jar \`\`\` 如果需要在程序运行时动态设置代理，你可以使用\`System.setProperty\`方法。例如： \`\`\`java System.setProperty(\\"http.proxyHost\\", \\"代理服务器地址\\");

DoubleProperty fontSize = new SimpleDoubleProperty(14); // 字体大小属性 // 绑定Label的字体大小到fontSize属性 label.styleProperty().bind(Bindings.concat(\\"-fx-font-size: \\", fontSize.asString(), \\";\\")); // 在某个动作发生时改变fontSize属性的值 fontSize.set(18); // Label的显示字体将自动更新 \`\`\` # 3. 响应用户交互 你可以为UI组件添加事件处理器（或者使用属性监听器），以响应用户的各种交互（如点击按钮、输入文本等），并动态更新界面。 \`\`\`java Button button = new Button(\\"点击我\\"); button.setOnAction(event -> { // 当按钮被点击时做些事情，例如打开一个新的窗口或更新界面 System.out.println(\\"按钮被点击了！\\"); }); \`\`\` # 4. 使用FXML加载动态UI界面 FXML是一种XML格式的标记语言，用于定义JavaFX应用程序的用户界面。你可以在运行时加载FXML文件，来动态改变应用程序的界面。 \`\`\`java // 加载FXML文件 FXMLLoader loader = new FXMLLoader(getClass().getResource(\\"dynamicUI.fxml\\")); Parent root = loader.load(); // 设置并展示场景 Scene scene = new Scene(root); stage.setScene(scene); stage.show(); \`\`\` # 5. 动画和过渡 JavaFX支持多种动画和过渡效果，可以让你创建流畅且动态的UI改变效果。 \`\`\`java FadeTransition ft = new FadeTransition(Duration.millis(3000), node);

} @Entity @Table(name = \\"child\\") public class Child extends Parent { } \`\`\` 在这个例子中，\`@Entity\`和\`@Table\`注解必须明确地在每一个实体类（\`Parent\` 和 \`Child\`）上声明。即使\`Child\`继承自\`Parent\`，\`Parent\`上的注解也不会自动应用于\`Child\`。 # 属性注解的继承 属性上的注解（如\`@Column\`，\`@ManyToOne\`等）更加直接。子类自动继承了父类的所有属性，包括这些属性上的注解。这对于映射继承的实体非常有用，但这不是注解继承的结果，而是属性和方法继承的自然结果。换句话说，即使没有\`@Inherited\`注解，这些属性注解依然“有效”，因为子类继承了带注解的属性。 # 使用\`@MappedSuperclass\` 在使用JPA实现类继承时，如果你希望父类中定义的JPA映射（如某些共有字段映射）被子类继承，你可以使用\`@MappedSuperclass\`注解： \`\`\`java @MappedSuperclass public class Base { @Id @GeneratedValue(strategy = GenerationType.IDENTITY) private Long id; // 更多共有字段 } @Entity public class SomeEntity extends Base { // 实体特有字段 } \`\`\` 在这种模式下，虽然\`@MappedSuperclass\`本身并不是一个实体，但它允许其JPA映射信息（例如ID字段）被继承到子类实体中。 总结，JPA实体类和属性上的注解默认不会继承到子类，但可以通过合理使用JPA注解和Java继承规则在实体类间共享映射信息。"},{"instruction":"@MappedSuperclass 标注的类，子类可以继承到@Column这些注解吗","output":"是的，使用\`@MappedSuperclass\`标注的类允许其子类继承包括\`@Column\`在内的JPA映射注解。 \`@MappedSuperclass\`是一个特殊的映射注解，它标明了一个类是实体类的一个基类，并且它的映射信息应该被继承到子类中。\`@MappedSuperclass\`自身不映射到数据库表中，但它允许你在这个类中定义通用的映射（如字段、关联关系等），这些映射会被继承到实际的实体子类中。这意味着在\`@MappedSuperclass\`中定义的字段，可以在数据库中的实体表中找到对应的列。 例如，考虑下面这个带有\`@MappedSuperclass\`注解的父类和一个继承它的实体类： \`\`\`java import javax.persistence.*; @MappedSuperclass public class BaseEntity { @Id @GeneratedValue(strategy = GenerationType.IDENTITY) private Long id; @Column(name = \\"created_at\\", nullable = false) private LocalDate createdAt; } @Entity @Table(name = \\"products\\") public class Product extends BaseEntity { @Column(name = \\"name\\") private String name; } \`\`\` 在这个例子中： - \`BaseEntity\`类使用\`@MappedSuperclass\`注解，这样它就可以包含一些共通的映射定义，例如\`id\`和\`createdAt\`字段。 - 这些映射信息（\`@Id\`和\`@Column\`）会被\`Product\`实体类继承。 - \`Product\`类会映射到数据库中的\`products\`表，这个表将包含\`id\`、\`created_at\`和\`name\`这些列。 因此，\`@MappedSuperclass\`提供了一种非常有用的方式来复用映射信息，避免了代码重复，使得实体类的设计更加干净、简洁。这使得开发者能够轻松地在父类中定义通用的映射信息，并且确保这些信息会被所有继承自这个父类的实体子类所共享。"},{"instruction":"这样的话，分表的时候，我就方便了","output":"确实，当涉及到分表（表分区）策略时，使用\`@MappedSuperclass\`可以非常方便地复用实体映射信息，并且让每个实体类对应不同的表。这种方式在设计具有类似结构但需要存储在不同数据库表中的数据时特别有用。通过定义一个包含通用映射信息的基类，可以减少重复代码，并使得整个模型更加清晰。 以下是一些可能的使用场景和好处： # 使用场景 1. **历史数据分表**: 如果你的应用程序处理大量数据并且随时间迅速增长，可以考虑按年或月将数据分配到不同的表中。这样做可以提高查询效率，减小单个表的大小，使得数据库维护变得更容易。 2. **按业务分表**: 在多租户应用程序中，可能需要为每个租户创建独立的数据表，以隔离不同租户的数据。通过继承统一的基类，每个租户的实体类可以映射到不同的表中，同时保持共同的结构和映射逻辑。 3. **按区域或功能分表**: 为了优化性能或出于数据治理的考虑，可能需要将数据根据地理位置或功能模块存储在不同的表中。 # 好处 - **减少重复代码**: 通过在基类中定义通用字段和配置（如ID、创建时间戳等），你可以避免在每个实体类中重复这些定义。 - **数据一致性**: 提供一个统一的映射基础，确保所有继承类在相同字段的映射配置上保持一致。 - **灵活性**: 如果需要调整所有实体的某些共有字段或映射（例如，添加新的共有字段或修改列名），你只需在基类中修改一次即可。 - **简化分表管理**: 特别是在使用JPA和Hibernate等ORM框架的项目中，\`@MappedSuperclass\`使得按照不同的条件（如日期、业务逻辑等）对数据进行分表成为一种简单而又直接的事情。 # 注意事项 尽管\`@MappedSuperclass\`提供了极大的方便，但在设计分表策略时，还需要考虑到使用它的限制，比如继承策略、查询效率和数据一致性等方面的挑战。例如，涉及多个分表的查询可能需要特别的处理，以保证性能和正确性。 最后，\`@MappedSuperclass\`是一种强大的工具，可以帮助你在应用分表策略时简化实体类的设计和保持代码的DRY（Don't Repeat Yourself）。在实际应用中，仍需结合业务需求仔细设计数据模型和表结构。"},{"instruction":"public class KLineHisCNs { @NoArgsConstructor @Accessors(chain = true) @Entity(name = \\"k_line_his_cn_1999\\") @Table(indexes = { @Index(name = \\"k_line_his_cn_1999_code\\", columnList = \\"code\\"), @Index(name = \\"k_line_his_cn_1999_date\\", columnList = \\"date\\"), }) public static class KLineHisCN1999 extends KLineHisCN { } @NoArgsConstructor @Accessors(chain = true) @Entity(name = \\"k_line_his_cn_2000\\") @Table(indexes = { @Index(name = \\"k_line_his_cn_2000_code\\", columnList = \\"code\\"), @Index(name = \\"k_line_his_cn_2000_date\\", columnList = \\"date\\"), }) public static class KLineHisCN2000 extends KLineHisCN { } } 我可以写在一个类里吗","output":"是的，您可以在一个外部类中定义多个静态内部类，并且每个静态内部类可以被独立地注解为一个JPA实体。这种结构在您需要将相似的实体类组织在一起时特别有用，比如在实现基于年份的分表策略时。每个静态内部类都可以作为一个独立的实体与特定的数据库表关联，通过\`@Entity\`和\`@Table\`注解指明。 您提供的代码示例正是这种情况的一个典型例子。在这个例子中，\`KLineHisCNs\`是一个外部类，它内部定义了两个静态内部类\`KLineHisCN1999\`和\`KLineHisCN2000\`。每个内部类都分别通过\`@Entity\`和\`@Table\`注解与特定的数据库表关联，并且拥有自己的索引配置。这样做允许您通过继承\`KLineHisCN\`基类来重用一些公共的映射逻辑，同时针对不同的表设置特定的表名和索引。 这种方式的几个关键点包括： 1. **继承性**：内部类\`KLineHisCN1999\`和\`KLineHisCN2000\`都继承自\`KLineHisCN\`，这允许您在这些实体中重用\`KLineHisCN\`中定义的字段和方法，实现了代码的复用。 2. **独立性**：尽管这些内部类继承自同一个基类，它们通过\`@Entity(name = \\"...\\")\`和\`@Table(name = \\"...\\", indexes = {...})\`注解分别映射到不同的数据库表。这提供了在同一个Java文件中管理多个相关实体类的灵活性，同时保持了它们在数据库层面的独立性。 3. **组织性**：将相关的实体作为内部类放置在同一个外部类中，有利于维护和理解代码结构，特别是当这些实体在逻辑上紧密相关时。 总之，这是一种组织和实现具有类似结构但需映射到不同数据库表的实体类的有效方式。不过，当您的项目变得更加复杂，或者需要更灵活的数据库操作（如动态表名）时，可能需要额外的设计或工具支持。"},{"instruction":"我需要1999-2024的表，手动写很麻烦","output":"面对需要映射多个年份的表，如1999到2024年，手动编写每个实体确实非常繁琐并且不易于维护。虽然JPA本身并不支持动态地创建实体类或基于参数动态选择实体类，但我们可以采取一些策略来简化这个问题。 # 策略1：程序生成实体类代码 你可以编写一个简单的代码生成器，根据年份动态生成各个实体类的代码。这个生成器可以是一个简单的脚本或Java程序，读取配置的年份范围，然后为每个年份生成相应的实体类代码。尽管这种方法不能在运行时动态创建实体，它至少简化了开发过程，在需要时你可以轻松地重新生成所有相关的实体类代码。 # 策略2：单实体与动态表名 对于某些情况，你可以考虑使用单一实体类，并结合JPA的本地查询或Spring JDBC Template来动态定位到特定年份的表。这种方法要求你在使用这个实体进行数据库操作时，动态地指定表名，这意味着失去了JPA部分自动化操作的便利，但却提供了更灵活的控制。 这种策略在实际中可能会涉及到构建SQL语句的字符串操作，需要谨慎处理以避免SQL注入等安全问题。 # 策略3：使用视图或查询来抽象表间差异 如果应用场景允许，另一种方法是在数据库中为每个实体表创建视图，或者使用数据库的查询功能来统一处理这些表。对于读操作，你可以使用这种方法将不同年份的数据抽象成统一的虚拟表示。对于写操作，则可能需要结合策略2来动态指定目标表。 虽然这不是通过JPA自身解决问题的方法，它提供了一种数据库层次上的灵活解决方案。 # 综合考虑 每种策略都有其适用场景和潜在的权衡。选择哪一种策略取决于具体需求、应用程序的复杂性、以及你能够接受的开发和维护成本。在某些情况下，可能需要混合使用这些策略以达到最佳效果。 无论采取哪种方法，请确保仔细规划并测试以确保数据的完整性和性能。在实现过程中，始终考虑将来的扩展性和维护性，以便应对需求变化和可能的新挑战。"},{"instruction":"现在用shardingjdbc，给出示例，我还需要为每一个表写dao层吗","output":"使用ShardingSphere（包括Sharding-JDBC）可以实现透明的数据库分片，包括表的分片和数据库的分片，以及读写分离。当使用ShardingSphere进行分表或分库操作时，其目的之一就是减少应用程序中对于多表或多库操作的直接管理需求。这意味着，在理想的情况下，你不需要为每一个分表创建单独的DAO层；而是可以创建一个通用的DAO（或Repository，如果你使用的是Spring Data JPA），ShardingSphere会根据配置好的分片规则自动路由到正确的表或数据库。 # 示例 假设你有一个关于\`Order\`的实体，其数据将根据某一规则（例如订单日期或订单ID）被分为多个表进行存储。以下是如何使用ShardingSphere和Spring Data JPA（或类似框架）以不需要为每个表单独编写DAO的方式进行操作： 1. **实体定义**：定义一个实体类\`Order\`，不需要指定它属于哪一个具体的表。 \`\`\`java @Entity public class Order { @Id private Long id;

Zhang (2024) and Gounopoulos (2018) both found that climate policy uncertainty and temperature change, respectively, are negatively associated with cash holdings. This suggests that firms increase their cash reserves in response to climate risk. Javadi (2020) further supports this, showing that the precautionary motive for holding cash is particularly strong for financially constrained firms. These findings are consistent with the precautionary motive framework and have important implications for corporate financial management in the face of climate risk. Research on corporate cash policies under climate change in the US suggests that firms are increasing their cash holdings in response to climate risks (Gounopoulos, 2018; Javadi, 2020). This is particularly evident in financially constrained firms and those in high-carbon-emission industries. The precautionary motive for holding cash is a key driver of this trend. Additionally, climate policy risk is a significant consideration in firms' financial decisions, leading to more conservative capital structures (Dang, 2020). The role of voluntary corporate action on climate change, driven by business case logic, is also highlighted, with implications for bank practice and government policy (Bowman, 2013). Research consistently shows that climate policy uncertainty has a significant impact on corporate cash holdings in the US. Zhang (2024) and Gounopoulos (2018) both find a negative association, with Zhang specifically noting a 2-year duration of this impact. This is further supported by Javadi (2020), who provides global evidence of increased cash holdings in response to climate risk, particularly among financially constrained firms. Duong (2018) adds to this by highlighting the role of cash holdings in mitigating the negative effects of policy uncertainty on firm activities, suggesting that these holdings serve as a buffer against uncertainty. A series of studies have found a positive relationship between climate risk and corporate cash holdings in the US. Gounopoulos (2018) and Javadi (2020) both found that firms increase their cash reserves in response to climate risk, with the latter noting a particularly strong effect among financially constrained firms. However, Zhang (2024) found a negative association between climate policy uncertainty and cash holdings in the US tourism and hospitality sector, with the impact lasting for two years. Heo (2021) further supported the positive relationship, showing that firms with higher climate change exposure tend to hold more cash, particularly after the Paris Agreement. These findings suggest that climate risk can significantly impact corporate cash holdings in the US. Research consistently shows that climate change has a significant impact on corporate cash holdings in the US. Gounopoulos (2018) and Javadi (2020) both find that firms increase their cash reserves in response to climate risk, with the effect being more pronounced for financially constrained firms. This is further supported by Yu (2022), who identifies a mechanism through which climate change increases the level of cash holdings in response to heightened operating risk. However, Zhang (2024) presents a contrasting view, suggesting that climate policy uncertainty is negatively associated with corporate cash holdings, particularly in the tourism and hospitality sector. This suggests that while climate change may lead to increased cash holdings, the uncertainty surrounding climate policy may have a dampening effect. In an era marked by the escalating risks and uncertainties of climate change affecting global economic stability, discerning how these dynamics influence corporate financial strategies, especially concerning cash holding policies, is paramount. This review embarks on a critical examination of the nexus between climate policy uncertainty, climate risk, and corporate cash holding decisions, sourcing insights from a broad array of literature encompassing corporate finance, uncertainty, carbon finance, and climate regulations. Javadi (2020) sets a pivotal foundation by illustrating that firms globally are bolstering their cash reserves as a precautionary measure against climate risk, a trend distinctly pronounced following the Stern Review’s release. This global outlook reveals a universal adaptation in corporate cash strategies against the backdrop of climate risk, pinpointing a direct correlation between climate risk exposure and the elevation of cash holdings. Through a detailed analysis involving datasets like PDSI, customer segment data, and Adaptive Capacity data, it becomes evident that firms located in jurisdictions with stringent environmental regulations or within sectors that are heavy carbon emitters, alongside financially constrained firms, are notably increasing their cash reserves. Such patterns indicate firms’ recognition of their climate risk exposure and their strategic recalibration of cash holdings to mitigate potential climate-induced financial impacts. Delving into sector-specific dynamics, Zhang (2024) uncovers the nuanced impact of climate policy uncertainty within the U.S. tourism and hospitality sector, observing a negative relationship with corporate cash holdings. This insight underscores the variability in sectoral responses to climate policy uncertainty, where certain industries might trim cash reserves as a strategic adjustment for anticipated policy alterations. Aligning with this observation, Gounopoulos (2018) echoes the general trend of upticked cash holdings in the U.S. in reaction to climate risks, focusing on the pronounced role of temperature changes. This study highlights the amplified effect on financially constrained firms, socially responsible firms, and high-carbon-emission industries, suggesting a heightened perception of climate-related risks to operational stability and cash flows among these segments. Broadening the scope, Yu (2022) explores how climate change is prompting an increase in corporate cash holdings, effectively managing risks. This trend is significantly evident in ecologically fragile areas, emphasizing the complexities of navigating operating risks amidst changing climate conditions. Similarly, Heo (2021) accentuates the intensified cash hoarding behavior of firms post-Paris Agreement, especially those with substantial climate change exposure, indicating a growing corporate apprehension towards climate-induced financial uncertainties. The landscape of policy uncertainty intersecting with corporate financial strategies is meticulously mapped out by Duong (2018) and Dang (2020), who detail the deliberate adjustments in cash holdings and capital structures in anticipation of, or in response to, climate policy changes. These adjustments delineate not merely reactive measures but strategic positions aimed at safeguarding or capitalizing on policy-induced market evolutions. Despite these rich insights, the literature presents several uncharted territories. The specific sectors experiencing a negative correlation between climate policy uncertainty and cash holdings, the disparate impacts of climate risks across different regions, and the underpinnings of increasing cash reserves—whether strategic or precautionary—are all areas yearning for deeper exploration. Moreover, contemplations on the long-term repercussions of climate policy uncertainty on corporate cash strategies and technological innovation’s role in mediating these strategies present fertile grounds for future inquiry. In synthesis, the discourse illuminates a predominantly positive relationship between climate risk and corporate cash holdings, albeit with nuances dictated by sector-specific dynamics, financial constraints, and locational factors. The interplay between climate policy uncertainty and corporate financial practices highlights an imperative for firms to dynamically adjust their cash holding policies in light of anticipated or extant climate risks and policy shifts. As the phenomenon of climate change continues to forge significant macroeconomic and microeconomic challenges, the beckoning for comprehensive, sector-specific, and longitudinal studies is pronounced, aiming to unravel and adeptly navigate the financial intricacies posed by this global exigency.

This reflects growing corporate apprehension toward climate-induced financial uncertainties and the strategic importance of cash reserves in navigating them. Examining the intersection of policy uncertainty and corporate financial strategies, Duong (2018) and Dang (2020) articulate how firms are adjusting their cash holdings and capital structures in anticipation of, or in response to, climate policy changes. These adjustments reveal a strategic positioning, not just reactive measures, aimed at navigating policy-induced market evolutions effectively. They underscore the complexity of corporate financial management in an era marked by rapid environmental and policy shifts. Despite these contributions, the literature reveals several gaps. Questions about the specific sectors that exhibit a negative correlation between climate policy uncertainty and cash holdings, the varied impacts of climate risks across different geographical regions, and the underlying motives—whether strategic or precautionary—for increasing cash reserves remain partially addressed. Additionally, the long-term effects of climate policy uncertainty on corporate cash strategies and the role of technological innovation in mediating these strategies are areas ripe for further exploration. This discourse predominantly reveals a positive relationship between climate risk and corporate cash holdings, marked by sector-specific nuances, financial constraints, and locational factors that dictate the dynamics of this relationship. The interaction between climate policy uncertainty and corporate financial practices underscores the critical need for firms to dynamically adjust their cash holding policies in light of anticipated or existing climate risks and policy changes.

步骤1：使用BeautifulSoup找到元素的唯一标识 假设你使用BeautifulSoup定位了一个按钮，通过分析其HTML结构得到该按钮的类名为\`btn btn-primary\`。 \`\`\`html <button class=\\"btn btn-primary\\" type=\\"submit\\">Submit</button> \`\`\` # 步骤2：使用Selenium定位同一个元素 根据上一步的分析结果，我们知道了按钮的类名，现在使用Selenium的\`find_element_by_class_name\`方法来定位它（注意：Selenium代码示例使用的是 WebDriver 实例名 \`driver\`，确保你已经有了一个有效的 WebDriver 实例）。 \`\`\`python from selenium import webdriver # 假设driver是一个已经初始化好的WebDriver实例 # 这里需要你自己初始化driver，例如通过Chrome(): # driver = webdriver.Chrome() # 使用Selenium定位到具有特定类名的按钮 button = driver.find_element_by_class_name(\\"btn-primary\\") # 例如，模拟点击该按钮 button.click() \`\`\` # 注意事项 - 确保使用的类名、ID或其他属性是唯一的，或者至少能够准确定位到您感兴趣的元素。 - 在某些情况下，元素的某些属性可能在页面加载过程中动态变化，这需要您分析具体情况来确定最佳的元素定位策略。 - 如果一个属性值包含空格，通常表示它有多个类。在Selenium中定位这样的元素时，需要使用一个类名，或者使用CSS选择器等其他方式来定位。 - 根据需要选择合适的Selenium元素定位方法，如\`find_element_by_id\`, \`find_element_by_xpath\`, \`find_element_by_css_selector\`等。 #

Are you familiar with the seven standards of excellence?","output":"Yes, the Seven Standards of Excellence (SOE) in Short-Term Missions are principles designed to guide churches, organizations, and individuals involved in short-term mission (STM) efforts to conduct them in a manner that is ethical, respectful, and effective. These standards were developed by the Standards of Excellence in Short-Term Mission, an accrediting and resourcing body for those sending, receiving, facilitating, and supporting short-term mission endeavors. Here's a summary of each standard: 1. **God-Centeredness**: It emphasizes that the mission should focus on God's will and direction. The activities, goals, and preparation of the mission are aimed at honoring God and spreading His message, rather than fulfilling personal ambitions or desires. 2. **Empowering Partnerships**: This standard focuses on the importance of establishing partnerships with the local church or ministry in the mission field. These partnerships should be characterized by mutual respect, trust, and a shared vision. The goal is to empower the local body, avoiding dependency and promoting sustainable impact. 3. **Mutual Design**: Missions should be designed together with those being served. This cooperation ensures that the missions are relevant and meet the actual needs of the community or group being served. It encourages joint ownership and responsibility for the mission's outcome. 4. **Comprehensive Administration**: This involves proper management and logistical support, including financial accountability, appropriate selection and preparation of team members, and thorough follow-up. It ensures that missions are well-organized, responsible, and transparent in their operations. 5. **Qualified Leadership**: Leadership within STM efforts should be competent and well-prepared. This includes not only the spiritual and missional aspects but also cultural sensitivity, conflict resolution, and basic health and safety measures. Qualified leaders can effectively guide the team and navigate challenges. 6. **Appropriate Training**: This standard highlights the need for proper preparation for all participants. Training should cover spiritual readiness, cultural awareness, specific skills necessary for the mission tasks, and strategies for effective ministry and service. 7. **Thorough Follow-Through**: The mission doesn't end when the trip is over. There should be intentional efforts to debrief participants, evaluate the mission's impact, and continue engagement with the work being done on the field. This includes ensuring that short-term efforts are part of a long-term ministry strategy and supporting the ongoing work of the local partners. Utilizing these standards helps ensure that short-term missions are conducted with integrity, respect for the communities served, and a clear focus on creating lasting and positive impacts aligned with the advancement of God's kingdom. Organizations and churches that adhere to these standards are more likely to conduct missions that are effective and transformative for both the participants and those served."},{"instruction":"I would also like to provide you with two articles that pertain to the 7th standard of excellence, Thorough Follow-through.

The addition of coworkers was elusive and responsiveness to the gospel slow. My work in this restricted-access country needed a boost, a breakthrough, a shot in the arm. And just when it felt overwhelming, when packing a bag to return home seemed like a reasonable course of action, relief showed up in the form of a short-term missions team. You entered my world as an English-teaching camp staff, a basketball team, and a student-exchange team. Each group brought unique talents and personalities, but you all bolstered the local ministry in six significant ways: 1. You proved to the people of my city that I am not the only Christian on the planet. At the university where I worked, not one person I’d talked to had ever met a Christian, seen a Bible, or attended a church. When I described myself as a follower of Christ, their eyes narrowed and heads tilted as they tried to comprehend the foreigner who seemed to have arrived from another galaxy. But when you came and professed that you also are believers, they began to understand that Christianity was for everyone: college students, people with tattoos, widows, cancer survivors, housewives, air-traffic controllers, and all races. The people in my city took note of this, realizing the invitation to follow Christ was not limited to white, middle-class American teachers. Your diversity led them to consider that God has a place for them in his family. 2. You multiplied the outreach. You interacted with hundreds of people in the days you were here, swiftly identifying ones who had an interest in Christ. Then you introduced them to me, saving me months—even years—of work that might have been required to produce similar results. You also met with new Christians and motivated them to grow in their faith, to take it to the next level. And, because you did things I couldn’t do and brought skills I didn’t have, you reached those I’d likely not have known otherwise. 3. You improved my profile in the community. You taught professionally, played with good sportsmanship, and respected the culture by doing simple things like dressing modestly and eating unfamiliar foods without complaint. Together we met the needs of the local people instead of just fulfilling our own agendas. You were not merely looking for a new overseas adventure to check off your bucket list or seeking to add a professional experience to your resume. Instead, you intentionally focused on building relationships as the foundation for sharing the gospel. As it turned out, some people weren’t interested in the gospel. Nonetheless, you nurtured relationships with them, met their needs for friendship and acceptance, and helped them improve their English or sports skills. You built bridges between our two cultures and dispelled negative stereotypes they had about Americans and Christians. When you left, both municipal and university leaders asked me to send more teams like yours in the future. They encouraged me to stay in the city long term because the groups I brought in added value to their lives. 4. You helped me connect with home. I’d been away from the United States for a while, and I wondered how far I’d drifted from my native lifestyle and language. I’d kept up with the news on the internet, but I wondered if I could keep up socially. After years of feeling like a misfit, the banter and laughter we shared reaffirmed my sense of belonging to my home culture. 5. You invested in my world. Due to complicated travel logistics, I previously didn’t get many visitors, so your arrival was the highlight of my year. I treasured having people from my home culture experience my world and be able to identify and empathize with me. After you left, I could communicate with you about certain places and people, and you knew them from personal experience. Before you came along, I feared that no one cared about the people in my city, those precious ones who had never heard of Christ, but you proved me wrong. Together we forged paths through rugged spiritual terrain. You helped me see I’m not in this alone. You also helped me see how far I’ve come. My lack of language, culture, and adjustment skills constantly discouraged me. But when some of the strange smells, sounds, cultural behaviors, and communication struggles unnerved you but no longer fazed me, I realized I’d made progress. God showed me how well I had adjusted since I first arrived overseas. 6. You inspired me. I respected you when you ate foods you didn’t recognize, sweated more than you ever thought possible, and even pretended to like the dirty hotel because it afforded you a prime location for ministry. Getting overseas was not only cumbersome for you, but it was also expensive. You sacrificed your annual vacation time to be here. Your example inspired me to look past my hardships and persevere. Honestly, preparing for your arrival took months of my time and was hard on me too. I was even concerned that if you didn’t understand the security needs here, you might end the ministry I’d given my life to. But God unified us in purpose and used your short-term trip to strengthen the ministry for years to come. When you boarded that rickety, hot bus and waved goodbye as you left town, a flood of satisfaction washed over me. I went back to my muggy apartment, plopped on my bed in exhaustion, and noticed a tear trickling down the side of my face. Your short-term trip was over, and it was beautiful. Thank you for coming.","output":"I'm ready for your query whenever you're prepared to continue."},{"instruction":"\\"The Keys to a Quality Debriefing\\" Experienced short-term mission leaders know what God does in the hearts of team members is just as important as what he does through them. Every team leader wants the members of the team to come home changed, to have a vision for the world and to act out the next steps God has shown them. A quality debriefing experience is the key that unlocks the potential of long-term life change for most team members. As a team leader, planning and executing the debriefing sessions is like putting the key in the lock. It is up to the team members to “turn the key” as they engage in the process with you and open their hearts to God’s next steps. Here are ten proven principles that will help you prepare for a quality debriefing experience. Ten Principles 1. Make it a priority from the start. You can’t wait until your ministry is over, bags are packed and the team is standing in the airport waiting for the flight number to be called to think about debriefing and expect it to be productive. Decide in advance that you are going to provide your team with a designated time to process the whirlwind of events and activities they have experienced together. 2. Plan to hold your debriefing sessions in your host country. Most short-term team members have an internal switch that goes off as soon as your plane touches the ground back home (for some it’s just being in our airspace that does it!). Team members tend to become preoccupied, focused on reconnecting with their friends, family members and favorite fast food meal upon returning home. There is a measure of honesty, vulnerability and team chemistry that is nearly impossible to recreate outside of your host country. 3. Schedule your debriefing sessions with your in-country contact during your logistical planning stage. Your host contact will want to get every minute of ministry and service out of your team. And so will you. Make sure you tell your contact in your advance correspondence that you will need up to six hours of time for debriefing two days before you depart for home. It is always easier to carve out time for debriefing before you arrive in the host country than afterwards. If you wait until you arrive to bring it up you may discover they have your team scheduled by the minute until you depart. Don’t take a chance with what you have determined is a non-negotiable. 4. Emphasize the importance of debriefing throughout the trip. Team members will develop their perspective on debriefing by observing the way it is profiled by the team leader. If it seems important to you, it will be important to them. Seize opportunities during the trip to highlight the fact you will be addressing important issues during this strategic time. 5. Select the location for your debriefing sessions carefully. Often in-country contacts suggest you combine a visit to a tourist area with the debriefing sessions. If this seems to be the best use of time, make sure you go to a secluded area away from potential distractions to hold your debriefing sessions. Be sure to instruct your team members in advance that priority one is debriefing and priority two is free time at the tourist site. 6. Be realistic with your time allotment. Quality debriefing sessions cannot be rushed. This material will digest better if prepared in a “relational crock pot” than in a quick fryer. And every team member will add a unique flavoring of their own. Be inclusive. You may be surprised to discover some very sensitive issues surface as team members begin to process the experiences of the trip. Team members will be reluctant to open up and address more than superficial concerns if they know you have planned to do the entire debriefing in one hour. You should tell them to plan on four to six hours to be safe. Plan to make a day of it. 7. Use a team member evaluation form and next steps commitment card. Some team members simply will not verbalize issues they are facing. Purposefully solicit feedback from your team by way of a written evaluation form. Challenge team members to begin thinking about their next steps by way of a next steps commitment card. It is usually best to have team members return the commitment card after they return home. Too often the emotion of the moment distorts the perspective of a team member with regard to next steps. 8. Emphasize the priority issues. A good debriefing session goes beyond getting your team members to talk to you. You will need to direct their attention to priority subjects that go deeper than their felt needs. Most teams need to discuss issues such as misconceptions about missions (making sure the team sees the big picture), exaggerating team experiences and disillusionment upon returning home. Team members should also be empowered to learn the priority lessons God has for them and how they can communicate these lessons with others. 9. Make sure the team is ready to strike while the iron is hot. Team members will encounter the most strategic opportunities to share about their trip within the first 48 hours after they return home. Team members who decide to wait until they get home and rest up to rehearse what they will say about the trip will likely miss out on the best opportunities God has prepared for them. Push your team members to process the information before they arrive home. 10. Meet one-on-one with each team member. In addition to group debriefing sessions, you should plan to meet with every team member before you return home for a personal appointment. Review the evaluation form in preparation for your meeting and think through the ways the team member has contributed to the efforts of the group. Give them an opportunity to share issues they were uncomfortable sharing in front of the group. Speak words of affirmation, encouragement, and correction into each team member’s life.","output":"I'm ready for your question now."},{"instruction":"Imagine that you are debriefing your STM team.

Please respond in about 300 words, with three specific references to the articles I provided and biblical passages.","output":"Addressing the sentiment \\"None of my friends understand what I've been through\\" in a post-mission debrief offers a critical moment to shepherd your team through re-entry, ensuring their reflections and integration of experiences are positive and biblically grounded. Here’s how you might guide this conversation: 1. **Affirm Their Feelings, Encourage Sharing**: Begin by validating their feelings, a nod to the principle of emphasizing priority issues from \\"The Keys to a Quality Debriefing.\\" Acknowledge that feeling misunderstood is common among missionaries returning home. Encourage them to share their stories and emotions but also to exercise patience and grace. As in 1 Peter 4:10, they're called to serve others with the grace God has given them, which includes sharing their experiences in ways that build understanding and community. 2. **Highlight the Diversity within the Body of Christ**: Reflecting on the article \\"6 Long-Term Effects of Short-Term Mission Trips,\\" emphasize the story where the missioner's presence in the host country demonstrates the diversity within the body of Christ. Use this as an analogy for their current situation, pointing out that just as their presence illuminated the gospel in a foreign land, their experiences now can serve to enrich their home community's understanding of God's work worldwide (1 Corinthians 12:12-27). This diversity within the body—of experiences, callings, and insights—is essential for the body's health and unity. 3. **Encourage a Focus on Continued Impact and Personal Growth**: Drawing inspiration from the emphasis on \\"Thorough Follow-Through,\\" guide your team members to see their mission experience as a starting point for further personal and communal growth. Encourage them to consider how they can continue to serve and impact their home community, sharing Christ's love in practical, relatable ways. Philippians 1:6 reassures us that God, who began a good work within us, will continue His work until it is finally finished on the day when Christ Jesus returns. Transform this moment of disconnect into an opportunity for deeper engagement with their home community, encouraging your team to seek healthy, constructive ways to share their experiences, learn from them, and allow those experiences to continue shaping their path forward in line with God's kingdom work."},{"instruction":"你知道孔乙己嗎？","output":"是的，孔乙己是鲁迅先生在1919年发表的短篇小说《阿Q正传》中的一个人物。不过，这有一个小误会：孔乙己其实是鲁迅在1919年发表的另一篇著名短篇小说《药》中的人物，并不是出自《阿Q正传》。 孔乙己被描述为一个落魄的秀才，生活在清末社会。他因经济窘迫而经常光顾镇上的一家酒楼，以喝酒度日。他穿着一件破旧的长衫，头戴一顶四季皆宜的硬瓜皮帽，是个极为特殊的人物。他因不断向人借钱且拖欠还款，被认为是一个吃书拿的穷秀才。在酒楼里，孔乙己以几乎成为他个人标志的句子“你知道的，四书五经哪一句说，女人和小人是难养的呢？”闻名。 孔乙己这个形象，反映了清末中国社会的一种落魄知识分子形象。他的生活悲苦，性格怪癖，但又不失为一种对旧时代知识分子的深刻刻画，展示了他们在社会转型期的命运和处境。鲁迅通过孔乙己这个人物，以及他那经典的台词和形象，讽刺了旧时代的教育体系和制度，指出了它们脱离实际，与民众生活脱节的问题。同时，也体现了鲁迅对那个时代中国社会状况的深刻关注和批评。"},{"instruction":"在孔乙己故事當中，旁人和孔乙己的對話，思想，動作帶出了當時社會現象，例如在文章後段：「掌櫃取下粉板説，“孔乙己還欠十九個錢呢！”到第二年的端午，又説“孔乙己還欠十九個錢呢！」 這裏見得旁人對孔乙己這個人的冷漠，表現當時就算有一個人很久沒有見到也不去為他擔心，可見當時社會的冷漠無情，也還帶出了很多深層意思。你能根據孔乙己這樣的故事構造形式（通過一些細緻對話，行動描寫）來製造一個簡短故事。","output":"在一个古老的小镇上，有个名叫陈明的老人。陈明年逾古稀，平生未成家，独居在小镇的一隅，生活简单而孤独。镇上人都知道他以修鞋为生，他的小铺面不大，但却饱含了他的心血和汗水。 一日，小镇上迎来了一场突如其来的大雨，街道变得湿滑难行。陈明坐在店里，手中拿着一只刚刚修好的老式皮靴，却见不到一个顾客的踪影。雨势渐渐小了，镇上的人们开始匆匆地走过他的店面，却没有人停下脚步。 夜幕降临，一位镇上的小贩路过，看到仍坐在店里的陈明，不由得感叹：“陈老，你今天又没做成生意呢！” 陈明笑了笑，摆手道：“生意好坏是天意，我只做我该做的。” 第二天，天气晴朗，人们都出门忙碌。小贩再次经过陈明的铺子，见他正专心致志地修补着一双破旧的鞋子，便好奇地问：“陈老，你总修些老旧的鞋子，为何不尝试些新活路子呢？” 陈明抬头，眼里闪过一丝坚定：“每双鞋，都有它的故事。我只是帮它们续写故事的人。新旧，对我而言，意义不大。” 日子一天天过去，陈明的坚持成了小镇上一道独特的风景线。他的简单生活哲学和对待旧物的态度，悄然间影响着镇上的每一个人。有人开始把闲置已久的物品拿来给他修补，有人则是专程来聊聊天，分享彼此的故事。 这样的日子绵延而温暖，陈明的店面逐渐成了一个小小的集会点，人们在这里交换着生活的感悟与欢笑。虽然陈明的生命里没有轰轰烈烈的事件，但他以自己的方式，温柔地触动了小镇上每一个人的心。 这个故事，正如孔乙己一样，通过日常细微的对话和行动，映照出社会中人与人之间简单而深刻的联系，并表达了对于生活态度和价值观的思考。在平凡中寻找不平凡，即使是最简单的行为，也能拥有深远的意义。"},{"instruction":"不必是社會的關係和方向，希望你以第一人稱方式，寫一個關於生活上的小事（根據孔乙己架構）、","output":"我叫李华，是一个普通的小镇居民。我的生活平凡得几乎可以说是枯燥，但有那么一件小事，至今想来依然让我感到温暖和感慨。 那是在一个春天的下午，我像往常一样结束了一天的工作，步履蹒跚地走在回家的路上。我的脑海里全是工作上的烦恼，心情沉重得仿佛连脚步也变得异常沉重。当我走过那条熟悉的小巷时，耳边突然传来了一阵熟悉的旋律。那是张阿姨在她的小摊前弹奏的二胡，她每到傍晚时分总会坐在那里，用她那磨损的二胡拉出动人的旋律。 我不由自主地停了下来，静静地站在那里，闭上眼睛聆听。音乐如清泉般流入我的心田，那些关于工作的烦恼和沉重仿佛都被这悠扬的旋律带走了。我不知道自己站了多久，直到音乐的最后一音落下，我才睁开眼睛，发现张阿姨正微笑着看着我。 “累了一天了吧，坐下歇歇脚，喝点水。”张阿姨招呼着我，递过来一杯热茶。 我接过茶杯，感受着那从掌心传来的温暖，心里涌上一股暖流。这个小镇虽小，但充满了温情。在这样一个不经意的午后，一杯茶、一段旋律，竟让我感到了前所未有的宁静与温馨。 那一刻，我突然明白，生活并不全是为了那日复一日的辛勤劳作，偶尔的停下脚步，感受生活中的这些小美好，才是真正让人觉得幸福和满足的时刻。 自那以后，每当我感到烦躁或压抑时，我就会想起那个春日下午的片段，想起张阿姨温暖的笑容和那悠扬的二胡声，我的心便慢慢平静下来。生活中的这些小事，虽不起眼，却是我前进道路上不可或缺的慰藉。"},{"instruction":"如何形容腦癱病人","output":"描述脑瘫（脑性瘫痪）患者时，重要的是采取一种尊重和敏感的态度，同时也要基于医学的准确性。脑瘫是一种由于大脑发育过程中的损伤或异常导致的永久性运动障碍症。患者的症状可以从轻微的肌肉僵硬和运动协调问题到严重的身体残疾不等。因此，当形容脑瘫患者时，要注意以下几点： 1. **避免使用贬低或带有偏见的语言**：表述时应避免使用带有歧视或者不尊重的词汇。记得，首先他们是个人，其次才是患者。 2. **专注于人，而非疾病**：强调个体的能力、兴趣和人格，而不仅仅是他们的病症。可以使用“脑瘫患者”这样的表述，但更推荐的是“患有脑瘫的人”或“有脑瘫的孩子”这种以人为本的描述方式，这样的措辞强调了人的主体性，而疾病只是他们生命中的一部分。 3. **描写具体的条件或症状**：脑瘫病人的症状范围很广，从轻度的协调问题到重度的肌肉僵硬和运动控制困难。正确地描述他们所面临的具体挑战，可以帮助人们更好地理解脑瘫及其影响。 4. **正面表述**：尽量使用能够体现患者积极面对生活的表述，比如谈及他们如何适应或克服某些生活中的挑战，展现他们的韧性和勇气。 以一种充满同情心、尊重和正确的方式来描述患有脑瘫的人，不仅能够准确传达信息，还可以促进社会对他们的接纳和理解。"},{"instruction":"Create 20 cosmetic brand names","output":"1.

While \`tanh\` helps in bounding the actions, its nature to saturate (outputs quickly converge to -1 or 1 as inputs grow large) can limit the variation of your actions, especially for parts of the action space with larger bounds. To increase the variation within the specified bounds, consider the following adjustments: - **Revisit Distribution for Sampling**: Continue using a Multivariate Normal distribution but reassess how the variance/covariance matrix is defined. A static addition of epsilon may not be sufficient to capture the desired variation across different action dimensions, especially when the range of values varies significantly across those dimensions. - **Adaptive Scaling**: Consider adjusting the scaling method post-sampling. Instead of using the \`tanh\` function, you might directly scale the raw samples based on the computed variances or standard deviations, allowing for more flexible and potentially wider variations. # Proposed Solution Given the specific need to enhance the variation while respecting the bounds, one approach is to dynamically adjust the variance based on the bounds' range and desired variance levels across action dimensions. 1. **Adjust Variance Dynamically**: Instead of adding a small epsilon to the variance, consider setting variances explicitly based on the range of each action dimension or adaptively based on the learning process. 2. **Direct Scaling**: After sampling actions from the distribution, directly scale them into the action space bounds without using \`tanh\`. This can be done if you ensure that the sampled actions (from a properly defined distribution) already fall within reasonable ranges that do not require hard bounding via a function like \`tanh\`. \`\`\`python def select_action(self, state, performance_metrics): action_means = self.actor(state) # This could be interpreted as the means of the actions to be taken. # Example of customized variance based on action space range - this requires tuning or dynamic adjustment action_ranges = self.actor.bounds_high - self.actor.bounds_low variances = torch.pow(action_ranges * 0.1, 2) # Assuming variance scales with the range, adjust 0.1 as needed. cov_mat = torch.diag(variances) # Adjust based on your needs dist = MultivariateNormal(action_means, cov_mat) raw_action = dist.sample() # The action is already in the correct scale thanks to the actor output scaling, so additional scaling might not be needed. action = raw_action.clamp(min=self.actor.bounds_low, max=self.actor.bounds_high) log_prob = dist.log_prob(raw_action) return action.detach().numpy().squeeze(), log_prob.item(), performance_metrics \`\`\` Note: This approach directly uses the actor's output (action means) and scales variance around it, assuming that the actor network's output is already guiding the actions towards the desirable space. The scaling (clamp) ensures all actions remain within bounds, considering the distribution might still produce outliers. # Conclusion The key to increasing the variation within the specified bounds lies in how you define the variance or standard deviation for sampling actions and how you scale these sampled actions. Experiment with dynamic variance/covariance adjustments and direct scaling methods to find what best suits the required variation in your application."},{"instruction":"i need some clarification of my trial, i removed the scaling and normalization with in the actor network, i get the raw action space form the actor network, with in the select action with in the PPO agent class, after sampling the raw action space data i am doing the normalization process is it acceptable to implement","output":"Yes, removing the scaling and normalization within the actor network and instead performing these steps within the \`select_action\` method of your PPOAgent class is an acceptable approach, particularly in Reinforcement Learning (RL) contexts where you have continuous action spaces. This method can offer you more flexibility and control over how actions are sampled and scaled to match the environment's requirements. # Advantages of Post-Sampling Normalization and Scaling: 1. **Dynamic Adjustment**: You can dynamically adjust the normalization and scaling process based on feedback from the environment or as part of an adaptive learning strategy. This might be harder to do if these processes are hardcoded within the neural network architecture. 2. **Simplified Model**: By keeping the actor network focused solely on generating raw action values, you simplify the model architecture. This separation can make the network easier to train and debug since it's only responsible for one task. 3. **Environment Adaptation**: Performing scaling outside the network allows you to easily adapt the agent to different environments by just changing the post-processing step, without needing to adjust the network's internals. 4. **Increased Control over Exploration**: By manipulating the variance and scaling after the actor network's output, you gain an additional knob to control exploration during training. For example, you can adjust how conservative or aggressive the agent is by tweaking variance or the scaling method. # Considerations for Implementation: - **Ensure Consistency**: When you move normalization and scaling outside the network, ensure these steps are consistently applied across all parts of your training and inference pipeline. Inconsistencies can lead to performance issues or might result in the agent learning incorrect behaviors. - **Action Distribution**: Depending on how you sample actions (e.g., using a Gaussian distribution), ensure the distribution you choose is suitable for the range and type of actions expected by your environment. This might require adjusting the mean and variance of the distribution based on the environment's feedback. - **Bounds Enforcement**: After normalization and scaling, make sure the final actions are clamped or otherwise adjusted to stay within the environment's allowed action space. It’s crucial for maintaining the validity of actions. - **Performance Metrics**: Since you're adjusting actions post-network, you may want to monitor how these adjustments affect performance metrics. If the scaling or adjustment process is introducing undesirable bias or inefficiency, consider revisiting your approach. # Example Adjustments in \`select_action\`: Given that you now prefer to handle scaling and normalization after getting the raw action from the actor, here's a simplified illustration of how you might adjust the \`select_action\`: \`\`\`python def select_action(self, state, performance_metrics): raw_action = self.actor(state) # Raw action output from the actor network. # Assume raw_action is now unscaled.

The core difference lies in the details of how the \`Actor\` class's \`forward\` method operates, specifically regarding the processing and scaling of the selected features. Additionally, there seems to be a slight misalignment or typographical error in the second implementation where the final \`return\` statement of the \`Actor\` class's forward method says \`return selected_features\`, which might instead be intended to be \`return scaled_actions\` based on the context and operations performed just before it. Here are key observations and the recommended approach: # Considerations 1. **Action Scaling Inside Actor (\`Implementation 1\` vs. \`Implementation 2\`)**: - In Implementation 2, action scaling (using tanh normalization followed by linear scaling to match the bounds) is performed within the actor's \`forward\` method itself. However, the final returned value seems mistakenly not to reflect this scaling operation due to the typo mentioned. - Implementation 1 returns the raw selected features from the \`Actor\`, leaving any form of normalization or scaling to be handled externally, such as within the \`select_action\` method of the \`PPOAgent\`. 2. **Consistency and Clarity**: - Having scaling inside the \`Actor\` (as attempted in Implementation 2) makes the model's output immediately usable and ensures that the actions generated by the actor are consistently scaled according to the specified bounds. This can enhance clarity since the actor's output reflects directly usable actions in the environment. - On the other hand, returning raw actions (Implementation 1) and handling scaling outside allows for more flexibility in experimenting with different scaling or normalization techniques during agent training and evaluation. 3. **Flexibility vs. Encapsulation**: - Implementation 2 encapsulates more functionality within the \`Actor\`, which can be beneficial for keeping the action generation logic self-contained. This approach is generally more aligned with modular design principles, where the actor directly outputs actionable values according to environment specifications. - Implementation 1 offers greater flexibility at the cost of potentially scattering related logic (i.e., how actions are scaled to meet environment bounds) across different parts of the codebase, which might make management more cumbersome as the complexity of your project increases. # Recommendation Considering the perspectives outlined above, **Implementation 2** (after correcting the mentioned issue) is recommended due to the following reasons: - **Encapsulation**: It encapsulates the entire logic of generating environment-compatible actions within the \`Actor\`. This makes the actor's outputs directly interpretable as actions, improving code readability and maintainability. - **Ease of Experimentation**: Despite the slightly higher coupling between action generation and scaling, it still allows for easy experimentation with different scaling methods (adjustments can be localized within the Actor). However, make sure to correct the final return statement in Implementation 2's \`Actor\`’s \`forward\` method to ensure it returns \`scaled_actions\` instead of \`selected_features\`. Also, consistently scrutinize the distribution and scaling parameters to ensure they align with your environment's needs and the desired exploration-exploitation balance. Here's a corrected snippet for the \`Actor\` forward method in Implementation 2: \`\`\`python def forward(self, state): node_features_tensor, _, edge_index = state processed_features = self.gnn(node_features_tensor, edge_index) action_indices_tensor = torch.tensor(action_indices, dtype=torch.long).t() selected_features = processed_features[action_indices_tensor[0], action_indices_tensor[1]] scaled_action = (torch.tanh(selected_features) + 1) / 2 # Maps outputs to (0, 1) scaled_actions = self.bounds_low + (self.bounds_high - self.bounds_low) * scaled_action return scaled_actions # Corrected to return the scaled actions \`\`\` This ensures the actor outputs actions scaled to the environment's specific requirements, maintaining consistency and clarity across your implementation."},{"instruction":"which is the best way to implement among the below two implementation procedures, please rreview it properly and professionally and advise me the best method to implement, if any update needed, provide me the final updated code.

However, there are critical differences in the \`PPOAgent\` class's \`select_action\` method that influence the decision on which implementation might be more preferable, along with some errors and inaccuracies that need to be addressed for clarity and correctness. # Critical Evaluation: 1. **Return Value Consistency in \`Actor.forward\`**: Both implementations return \`scaled_action\` from the \`Actor.forward\` method, but towards the end, it appears it should return \`scaled_actions\` (which is the variable that has been calculated to fit within the specific bounds). 2. **Handling Action Selection in \`PPOAgent.select_action\`**: - **Implementation 1** skips over creating a distribution and sampling actions from it. Instead, it incorrectly tries to calculate the log probability of \`action_probs\` as though they had been sampled from a distribution, which is not implemented. This is a significant oversight that results in parts of the PPO algorithm not being correctly followed. - **Implementation 2**, on the other hand, correctly forms a multivariate normal distribution using the action probabilities and their variances to sample actions. This approach is more in alignment with the Probabilistic nature of selecting actions in policy-gradient methods like PPO, offering a way to estimate how \\"likely\\" the chosen action was under the current policy (captured by its log probability). # Recommendations: From the standpoint of correctly implementing the PPO algorithm, **Implementation 2 is recommended** with necessary corrections detailed below. It aligns more closely with the probabilistic approach required for estimating gradients during the learning process, capturing the exploration element through the variance in action selection.

Additionally, addressing the absence of variance and distribution-based sampling in Implementation 1 or clarifying its intended structure can also make it viable, albeit with necessary corrections to align with the principles of PPO and action selection dynamics in RL environments."},{"instruction":"instead of varience can we able to use the mean and standard deviation from the actor model for my continuous action space","output":"Yes, you can certainly use the mean and standard deviation output from your actor model for managing continuous action spaces in reinforcement learning, especially when employing policy gradient methods like Proximal Policy Optimization (PPO). This approach is quite standard and is often preferred due to its natural fit with the probabilistic interpretation of actions in such continuous spaces. Here's a conceptual overview of how you might adjust your implementation to utilize mean and standard deviation directly from the actor model: # Proposed Adjustments for Actor Model 1. **Output Mean and Standard Deviation**: Modify the \`Actor\` class to output both the mean ((mu)) and standard deviation ((sigma)) for each action dimension. This allows direct use of these parameters to define the action distribution. 2. **Ensure Positive Standard Deviation**: Since standard deviation values must be positive, use an appropriate activation function (e.g., Softplus) on the network's output that represents the standard deviation. 3. **Sample Actions Using the Normal Distribution**: With mean and standard deviation as outputs, you can sample actions from a normal distribution parameterized by these values. This directly links the actor’s output with the action selection process. 4. **Action Scaling**: If you need the actions to lie within certain bounds, you can still scale the sampled actions as per your environment needs. However, if your actions can naturally fall within the required bounds through the actor network's design, additional explicit scaling might not be strictly necessary. # Sample Code Adjustments Here is a skeletal update to demonstrate this conceptually: Modification within Actor \`\`\`python class Actor(torch.nn.Module): def __init__(self, gnn_model, action_dim): super(Actor, self).__init__() self.gnn = gnn_model # Assuming your GNN model's output connects to these self.mean_layer = torch.nn.Linear(last_gnn_output_size, action_dim) self.std_dev_layer = torch.nn.Linear(last_gnn_output_size, action_dim) # Ensure standard deviation is positive self.softplus = torch.nn.Softplus() def forward(self, state): gnn_output = self.gnn(state) mean = self.mean_layer(gnn_output) std_dev = self.softplus(self.std_dev_layer(gnn_output)) # Ensures std_dev is positive return mean, std_dev \`\`\` Adjusting \`select_action\` in PPOAgent \`\`\`python def select_action(self, state, performance_metrics): mean, std_dev = self.actor(state) # Form the normal distribution and sample actions dist = torch.distributions.Normal(mean, std_dev) raw_action = dist.sample() # If necessary, scale raw_action to match environmental bounds # Example: scaled_action = ... # Compute log probability of the sampled action log_prob = dist.log_prob(raw_action).sum(axis=-1) # Sum may be needed depending on your action space return raw_action.detach().numpy(), log_prob.item(), performance_metrics \`\`\` # Key Points - **Environment Compatibility**: The direct use of mean and standard deviation ties the network's output closely with the probabilistic interpretation of policy in continuous action spaces, making it a natural choice for such applications in reinforcement learning. - **Network Design**: Care must be taken in designing the network so that it can output sensible values for both means and standard deviations across the expected state inputs. This may involve careful initialization and potentially constraining outputs (e.g., using a \`tanh\` function to bound means if necessary). - **Exploration Handling**: By manipulating the standard deviation, either statically or dynamically during training, you can control the level of exploration the agent undertakes. Early in training, a higher standard deviation might be beneficial for exploration, whereas you might reduce it over time as the policy converges.

While this is a step toward dynamic exploration, the base variance (\`epsilon = 1e-5\`) might be too small to allow for significant exploration, especially for larger action bounds. 2. **Scaled Action Using tanh**: After sampling \`raw_action\` from your distribution, you use a \`tanh\` operation followed by scaling to fit the action within specified bounds. This approach is generally effective for ensuring actions stay within limits. However, because \`tanh\` outputs values in the range \`(-1, 1)\`, this method might inadvertently compress the variability of actions if the underlying distribution does not have sufficient variance. # Proposed Solutions to Enhance Exploration Adjusting the Variance Calculation To enhance exploration, consider dynamically adjusting the variance more significantly based on the actual behavioral needs of your agent and the environment dynamics. This could involve strategies like: - **Adaptive Scaling**: Increasing the factor used to scale \`bounds_range\` based on the learning progress, possibly by accounting for the variance in received rewards or the change in policy performance over time. - **Domain-Specific Insights**: Tailoring the variance adjustments more closely to the specific characteristics of each action dimension based on domain knowledge. Modulating the \`tanh\` Scaling Strategy The \`tanh\` scaling method, while ensuring bounds are respected, may need adjustment to ensure broader exploration: - **Exploration-Encouraging Transformations**: Before applying \`tanh\`, you might scale or transform \`raw_action\` in ways that encourage broader utilization of the \`tanh\` function's range, potentially by adjusting the magnitude of actions based on ongoing performance metrics. Implementing an Exploration Bonus An additional method to encourage exploration without directly altering the action sampling strategy is to introduce an \\"exploration bonus\\" within the reward structure or as part of the policy loss. This technique can motivate the policy to naturally explore more widely within the action space. # Example Code Adjustment Here’s a conceptual adjustment to incorporate a dynamic variance scaling approach and modify the use of \`tanh\` for broader exploration: \`\`\`python def select_action(self, state, performance_metrics): action_probs = self.actor(state) # Dynamically adjust the factor based on learning progress or other metrics dynamic_factor = self.calculate_dynamic_factor(performance_metrics) # Placeholder for adaptive mechanism bounds_range = self.actor.bounds_high - self.actor.bounds_low epsilon = (1e-4 + bounds_range * dynamic_factor).clamp(min=0.01) # Ensure a minimum level of variance variances = action_probs.var(dim=0, keepdim=True).expand(action_probs.shape[0]) + epsilon cov_mat = torch.diag(variances) dist = MultivariateNormal(action_probs, cov_mat) # Sampling action raw_action = dist.sample() # Adjusting action scaling strategy for broader exploration action_transform = lambda x: x # Placeholder for an adaptive transform based on exploration needs raw_action_transformed = action_transform(raw_action) scaled_action = min_values + ((torch.tanh(raw_action_transformed) + 1) / 2) * (max_values - min_values) log_prob = dist.log_prob(raw_action) - torch.log(max_values - min_values).sum() return scaled_action.detach().numpy().squeeze(), log_prob.item(), performance_metrics \`\`\` In this conceptual code, \`calculate_dynamic_factor\` and \`action_transform\` are placeholders meant to represent potential strategies for dynamically adjusting exploration based on the agent's performance or learning progress and transforming actions to utilize the full range of the \`tanh\` function, respectively.

This scalar value, which I'm referring to as \`dynamic_factor\`, can be calibrated to encourage more exploration if the agent's performance is either too consistent (implying potential stuckness in local optima) or if certain key performance indicators (KPIs) are below desired thresholds. The strategy for calculating \`dynamic_factor\` could consider various aspects such as the rate of improvement in performance metrics, the variance in those metrics over recent episodes, or the proximity of those metrics to certain target values. For instance, lower performance in key areas could result in higher \`dynamic_factor\` to encourage broader exploration. Below is a simplified example that uses the variance in recent performance metrics to adjust \`dynamic_factor\`. This example assumes you have a history or running average of performance metrics to work with. # Method Implementation: You will need to store and update performance metrics history for this to work. For simplicity, the example assumes you already have access to this data. \`\`\`python class PPOAgent: def __init__(self, gnn_model, state_dim, action_space, lr_actor, lr_critic, gamma, gae_lambda, epsilon, policy_clip, epochs, entropy_coef): # Existing initialization code... self.performance_history = [] self.dynamic_factor_base = 0.05 # Base value for the dynamic factor def calculate_dynamic_factor(self, performance_metrics): # Store the latest performance metrics self.performance_history.append(performance_metrics) # Keep only the most recent N metrics for simplicity if len(self.performance_history) > 100: # Assume we keep the latest 100 records self.performance_history = self.performance_history[-100:] # Example: Calculate the variance of a particular metric 'PowerDissipation' across recent history power_dissipations = [metrics['PowerDissipation'] for metrics in self.performance_history] variance = np.var(power_dissipations) # Calculation could be more sophisticated here # Example adaptive strategy: increase factor if variance is high, indicative of unstable performance if variance > threshold_variance: # threshold_variance is a hyperparameter you define based on domain knowledge return self.dynamic_factor_base * 2 # Example: doubling the base factor else: return self.dynamic_factor_base def select_action(self, state, performance_metrics): # Existing code for action selection... \`\`\` # Considerations: - **Normalization**: Depending on the scale of your performance metrics, you might need to normalize the variance or other statistics you calculate to ensure that \`dynamic_factor\` stays within reasonable bounds. - **Domain-Specific Adjustments**: The simplistic method above uses variance in \`PowerDissipation\` as a proxy for when to encourage exploration. You should consider what metrics best reflect successful exploration in your particular domain and adjust the \`calculate_dynamic_factor\` method accordingly. - **Balancing Exploration and Exploitation**: The mechanism of adjusting action variance through \`dynamic_factor\` is inherently a way to balance exploration with exploitation. Be mindful of tuning this too aggressively towards exploration, as it might prevent the agent from sufficiently exploiting learned behaviors to improve. This example offers a starting point, but you should tailor the calculation of \`dynamic_factor\` to fit the specific nuances of your environment and the performance metrics it provides. The goal is to dynamically adapt the agent’s exploratory behavior based on its performance, encouraging broader exploration when necessary to escape local optima or when certain KPIs indicate unsatisfactory performance."},{"instruction":"performance metrics contains mode metrics values all are important we cannot selece the powerdissipation alone, instead of performance metrics can we use the reward value, it is a single scalar value (may be either positive or negative value) during each time step the reward were calculated as a feed back from the environment for the given action space input","output":"Yes, using the reward value as a basis for adjusting exploration is a common and effective method in reinforcement learning (RL). The reward signal is a direct indicator of how well an agent is performing with respect to the environment's objectives. By basing your exploration strategy on reward values, you're aligning the exploration behavior directly with the overall goal of maximizing cumulative rewards. # Adjusting Exploration Based on Reward Feedback The idea here is to adjust the \`dynamic_factor\` based on the feedback (rewards) received from the environment, which could be a function of how rewards are improving or varying over time. For instance, if rewards are consistently improving, you might reduce exploration to exploit the strategy that's currently working. Conversely, if rewards are stagnating or declining, increasing exploration might help find new strategies. # Implementing Reward-based Exploration Adjustment Below is an example implementation showcasing how to adaptively adjust the exploration (through \`dynamic_factor\`) based on recent reward history: \`\`\`python class PPOAgent: def __init__(self, gnn_model, state_dim, action_space, lr_actor, lr_critic, gamma, gae_lambda, epsilon, policy_clip, epochs, entropy_coef): # Initialization code... self.rewards_history = [] self.dynamic_factor_base = 0.05 # Base value for the dynamic factor def update_rewards_history(self, reward): self.rewards_history.append(reward) # Limit the history size to keep only the most recent rewards if len(self.rewards_history) > 100: self.rewards_history = self.rewards_history[-100:] def calculate_dynamic_factor(self): # Example: Using the change in average rewards to adjust exploration if len(self.rewards_history) >= 100: recent_rewards = self.rewards_history[-10:] # Last 10 rewards earlier_rewards = self.rewards_history[-100:-10] # Previous 90 out of 100 rewards recent_avg_reward = sum(recent_rewards) / len(recent_rewards) earlier_avg_reward = sum(earlier_rewards) / len(earlier_rewards) # Increase exploration if recent rewards are not significantly better than earlier if recent_avg_reward <= earlier_avg_reward * 1.1: # Example threshold return self.dynamic_factor_base * 2 # Example: increasing exploration else: return self.dynamic_factor_base # Sticking with base exploration level else: # Not enough data to adjust; use base dynamic_factor return self.dynamic_factor_base def select_action(self, state, performance_metrics): # Adjust exploration based on recent reward history dynamic_factor = self.calculate_dynamic_factor() bounds_range = self.actor.bounds_high - self.actor.bounds_low epsilon = (1e-4 + bounds_range * dynamic_factor).clamp(min=0.01) # Rest of the action selection logic... # Assume 'reward' is obtained somewhere after environment interaction # Update the rewards history self.update_rewards_history(reward) # More code for action selection, etc... return scaled_action.detach().numpy().squeeze(), log_prob.item(), performance_metrics \`\`\` # Key Considerations: - **Sensitivity**: The sensitivity of exploration adjustments to changes in rewards can significantly impact learning. Be cautious of over-adjusting and ensure there's a smooth mechanism to revert back to more exploitative behavior once beneficial strategies are found. - **Noise in Rewards**: Rewards can be noisy, especially in complex environments. Consider smoothing mechanisms (e.g., moving averages) or basing adjustments on longer-term trends rather than immediate reward feedback. - **Thresholds and Scaling Factors**: The example uses arbitrary thresholds and scaling factors (e.g., \`* 1.1\` and \`* 2\`) for adjusting exploration. These values should be tailored based on empirical observations and the specific dynamics of your environment.

Here's an approach to achieving this integration: # Step 1: Modify the PPOAgent Class First, ensure there is a method within \`PPOAgent\` that can be called externally to update the rewards history.

You can directly call \`agent.update_rewards_history\` with this \`reward\` to update the agent's internal rewards history. Here's a snippet demonstrating this adjustment: \`\`\`python def train(env, agent, num_episodes, max_timesteps, batch_size): for episode in range(num_episodes): node_features_tensor, edge_feature_tensor, edge_index, performance_metrics = env.reset() state = (node_features_tensor, edge_feature_tensor, edge_index) # Reset or initialize episode-specific accumulators if needed # Not explicitly needed for reward history update, but useful for other episode-level metrics or processing for t in range(max_timesteps): # Selecting action based on the current state action, log_prob, perf_metrics = agent.select_action(state, performance_metrics) next_node_features_tensor, next_edge_feature_tensor, next_edge_index, reward, done, previous_metrics = env.step(action, perf_metrics) next_state = (next_node_features_tensor, next_edge_feature_tensor, next_edge_index) # Update the rewards history within the agent right after obtaining the reward agent.update_rewards_history(reward) # Rest of your timestep-level logic # For example, accumulating states, actions, log_probs, etc., for later use in learning/updating if done: break # Post-episode: Learning update logic might go here # For example, using the accumulated states, actions, log_probs, rewards, etc., to perform a learning update \`\`\` # Additional Considerations: - **Episode vs Timestep Rewards**: The current approach updates the reward history after every timestep. If your intention is to focus more on episode-level performance (total reward per episode), you might need to adjust this logic to accumulate rewards over the episode and update the history once per episode. - **Reward Signal Preprocessing**: Depending on the nature of your environment's reward signal (e.g., scale, frequency of non-zero rewards), you might find preprocessing (scaling, smoothing) the reward before updating the history could lead to a more stable adjustment mechanism. - **Performance Metrics and Reward Relationship**: While directly using rewards to adjust exploration is mechanismically straightforward, don't forget that your original performance metrics can provide valuable multidimensional insight into the agent's behavior and success. Explore ways those might also inform exploration strategies, even if indirectly through their relationship to the reward structure. By updating the reward history based on feedback from the environment after each step, and by making exploration adjustments based on this history, the PPOAgent can dynamically balance exploration and exploitation based on its recent performance trajectory.

Here's the correct usage within the context of your training loop: \`\`\`python def train(env, agent, num_episodes, max_timesteps): for episode in range(num_episodes): # Environment reset and state initialization state = env.reset() for t in range(max_timesteps): action, log_prob = agent.select_action(state, None) # Placeholder for actual state input and unused performance metrics next_state, reward, done, _ = env.step(action) agent.update_rewards_history(reward) # Correct usage to update rewards history if done: break # Exit the loop if the episode is done state = next_state # Update the state for the next step # Perform learning updates with agent at the end of each episode if necessary \`\`\` This correct usage ensures: 1. **Proper Reward Logging**: After each step taken in the environment (via \`env.step(action)\`), the received \`reward\` is correctly logged into the agent's reward history using \`agent.update_rewards_history(reward)\`. 2. **Data Integrity**: It maintains the integrity and intended functionality of the agent's internal \`rewards_history\` list, enabling the agent to perform meaningful analyses or adjustments based on its historical performance, such as adapting the exploration factor dynamically. Remember, the primary purpose of maintaining a rewards history is to allow the agent (or its governing algorithms) to make informed decisions about its policy adjustments, exploration-exploitation balance, or to analyze the agent's learning progress over time."},{"instruction":"thank you","output":"You're welcome!

Dies geschieht in der Regel durch Inflation. Bei Inflation steigen die Preise für Waren und Dienstleistungen, und oft steigen auch die Löhne nominell, um den Kaufkraftverlust auszugleichen. Die Einkommensteuertarife werden jedoch nicht automatisch angepasst, was dazu führen kann, dass ein höherer Teil des Einkommens besteuert wird, obwohl die Kaufkraft des Einkommens nicht zugenommen hat. # Beispiele zur Verdeutlichung: **Beispiel 1: Ohne Inflation und ohne Lohnerhöhung** - Ein Arbeitnehmer verdient 30.000 Euro pro Jahr und zahlt darauf 15% Steuern, also 4.500 Euro. - Sein Nettoeinkommen beträgt somit 25.500 Euro. - Nehmen wir an, diese Situation ändert sich nicht über ein Jahr. Die reale Kaufkraft seines Einkommens bleibt gleich, und seine Steuerbelastung ändert sich nicht. **Beispiel 2: Mit Inflation und nomineller Lohnerhöhung** - Durch Inflation sind die Preise gestiegen, und der Arbeitnehmer erhält eine Gehaltserhöhung auf 31.500 Euro pro Jahr, um die Inflation auszugleichen. Das ist nominell mehr, aber real kann er sich dafür nicht mehr kaufen als vorher. - Angenommen, die Steuertabellen wurden nicht angepasst, könnte es sein, dass sein Einkommen jetzt in eine höhere Progressionsstufe fällt, und er muss nun 18% Steuern zahlen. - Das ergibt eine Steuerlast von 5.670 Euro und ein Nettoeinkommen von 25.830 Euro. - Obwohl er nominell mehr verdient, hat sich seine reale Kaufkraft nicht erhöht. Aber durch die kalte Progression zahlt er relativ mehr Steuern. **Beispiel 3: Inflation ohne Lohnerhöhung** - Wenn der Arbeitnehmer keine Lohnerhöhung bekommt, sein nominelles Einkommen also bei 30.000 Euro bleibt, aber die Preise für Lebenshaltung durch Inflation steigen, verliert er an Kaufkraft. - Würde in diesem Fall die Steuertabelle nicht angepasst, bliebe seine Steuerlast zwar nominal gleich, sein Nettoeinkommen reicht jedoch nicht mehr so weit wie vorher. # Zusammenfassung Kalte Progression bestraft somit indirekt Steuerzahler durch eine höhere relative Steuerlast, ohne dass sich ihre reale wirtschaftliche Situation verbessert hat, einfach dadurch, dass die Steuersysteme nicht immer zeitnah an Inflationsraten angepasst werden. Dies führt zu einer \\"heimlichen\\" Steuererhöhung, da die Steuerpflichtigen einen größeren Teil ihres Einkommens an den Staat abführen müssen, obwohl ihre Kaufkraft nicht gestiegen ist."},{"instruction":"Also trifft die kalte Progression jeden Steuerzahler, egal ob arm oder reich? Wie kann man der kalten Progression entgegen wirken?","output":"Ja, die kalte Progression kann grundsätzlich jeden Steuerzahler treffen, egal ob arm oder reich. Die Auswirkungen und das Ausmaß können allerdings je nach Einkommen und Steuersatz unterschiedlich sein. Bei Personen mit geringerem Einkommen kann der Effekt der kalten Progression relativ stärker zu spüren sein, da sie einen größeren Anteil ihres Einkommens für lebensnotwendige Ausgaben verwenden müssen und jede zusätzliche Steuerbelastung ihre finanzielle Lage stärker beeinträchtigt. Für reichere Steuerzahler kann die zusätzliche Steuerlast durch die kalte Progression zwar absolut gesehen höher sein, aber sie haben meistens mehr finanziellen Spielraum, um diese zu kompensieren. # Maßnahmen gegen die kalte Progression 1. **Anpassung der Steuertabellen:** Die einfachste und direkteste Methode, um der kalten Progression entgegenzuwirken, ist die regelmäßige Anpassung der Steuertarife und des Grundfreibetrages an die Inflationsrate. Durch die Inflation eingetretene Veränderungen der Kaufkraft können so ausgeglichen werden. Der Staat passt die Steuertabellen an, sodass die effektive Steuerbelastung in Bezug auf die reale Kaufkraft stabil bleibt. 2. **Indexierung der Steuersätze:** Eine weitere Methode ist die Indexierung der Steuersätze und des Grundfreibetrages. Dabei werden diese automatisch an die Inflation angepasst, ohne dass es jedes Mal einer politischen Entscheidung bedarf. Diese Anpassungen erfolgen in regelmäßigen Abständen anhand eines festgelegten Inflationsindex. 3. **Erhöhung des Grundfreibetrages:** Die Anhebung des Grundfreibetrages, bis zu dem kein Einkommensteuer gezahlt werden muss, kann ebenfalls helfen, die Auswirkungen der kalten Progression abzumildern. Damit wird insbesondere Geringverdienern geholfen, da ein größerer Teil ihres Einkommens steuerfrei bleibt. 4. **Tarifliche Maßnahmen:** Die Abflachung des Steuertarifverlaufs, also die Reduzierung der progressiven Steigerung der Steuersätze bei steigendem Einkommen, kann auch gegen die kalte Progression wirken. Durch eine moderatere Progression werden Sprünge in der Steuerbelastung bei kleinen Einkommensverbesserungen vermieden. Fazit Obwohl die kalte Progression theoretisch jeden Steuerzahler treffen kann, sind die realen Auswirkungen und das Ausmaß der Betroffenheit individuell verschieden. Durch staatliche Maßnahmen, insbesondere regelmäßige Anpassungen des Steuersystems, kann der Effekt der kalten Progression abgemildert oder sogar neutralisiert werden, um eine faire und gerechte Besteuerung zu gewährleisten."},{"instruction":"Aber wie passiert es, dass eine kalte Progression geschieht? Hat es immer was mit inflation zu tun?","output":"Ja, die kalte Progression ist eng mit der Inflation verknüpft. Sie tritt auf, wenn die Löhne und Gehälter nominal ansteigen, um mit der Inflation Schritt zu halten, ohne dass dadurch die reale Kaufkraft der Menschen zunimmt. Wenn das Steuersystem, insbesondere die Steuertabellen und Freibeträge, nicht entsprechend angepasst werden, rutschen Steuerzahler in höhere Steuerklassen oder werden stärker besteuert, obwohl sich ihre wirtschaftliche Lage, gemessen an der Kaufkraft, nicht verbessert hat. # Wie geschieht die kalte Progression? 1. **Inflation führt zu höheren Löhnen:** Um den Verlust der Kaufkraft auszugleichen, werden in der Regel die Löhne und Gehälter nominal erhöht. Das bedeutet, die Menschen erhalten mehr Geld, das jedoch aufgrund der gestiegenen Preise für Waren und Dienstleistungen nicht mehr kaufen kann als vorher. 2. **Steuertabellen bleiben gleich:** Die Steuergesetze und -tabellen sind jedoch oft in nominalen Werten festgeschrieben und werden nicht automatisch an die Inflation angepasst. Das Steuersystem „sieht“ also nur, dass jemand mehr Geld verdient, nicht aber, dass diese Person für dieses Geld real nicht mehr erwerben kann. 3. **Höhere nominelle Einkommen führen zu höheren Steuersätzen:** Durch das nominell gestiegene Einkommen fallen Menschen in höhere Steuerstufen oder überschreiten bestimmte Einkommensgrenzen, was zu einer höheren Einkommensteuerbelastung führt, selbst wenn ihre Kaufkraft stagniert oder sogar fällt. # Warum ist die Inflation der Schlüssel? Die Inflation ist ein zentrales Element, weil sie die Kaufkraft des Geldes beeinflusst. Ohne Inflation oder bei einer perfekten Anpassung der Steuertabellen und Freibeträge an die Inflation würde die kalte Progression nicht auftreten. Kalte Progression ist ein Phänomen, das besonders in Zeiten moderater bis hoher Inflation zum Tragen kommt, wenn Lohnanpassungen stattfinden, um die gestiegenen Lebenshaltungskosten zu kompensieren, das Steuersystem jedoch nicht entsprechend nachjustiert wird. # Kurzum Kalte Progression ist also ein indirekter Effekt der Inflation auf das Steuersystem, der dazu führt, dass Steuerzahler einen höheren Anteil ihres Einkommens als Steuer abführen müssen, ohne dass sich ihre reale wirtschaftliche Situation verbessert hat. Dies passiert, weil das Steuersystem nominelle Einkommenssteigerungen erfasst, ohne die durch Inflation bedingten Veränderungen der Kaufkraft zu berücksichtigen."},{"instruction":"Wie passiert eine Inflation? Durch höhere Nachfrage, steigender Wert, oder wie kann ich mir das vorstellen?","output":"Inflation ist der Prozess, bei dem das allgemeine Preisniveau von Waren und Dienstleistungen in einer Volkswirtschaft über einen bestimmten Zeitraum hinweg ansteigt. Dadurch verringert sich die Kaufkraft des Geldes, d.h., für die gleiche Menge an Geld erhält man weniger Güter und Dienstleistungen als zuvor. Es gibt verschiedene Mechanismen und Ursachen für Inflation, die häufig in zwei Hauptkategorien eingeteilt werden: Nachfrageinflation (auch Nachfragesoginflation genannt) und Kosteninflation (auch Angebotsdruckinflation). # Nachfrageinflation (Nachfragesoginflation) Diese Form der Inflation tritt auf, wenn die Gesamtnachfrage in der Volkswirtschaft die Fähigkeit der Wirtschaft übersteigt, Güter und Dienstleistungen zu produzieren. Anders gesagt, die Nachfrage übertrifft das Angebot. Zu einer steigenden Nachfrage kann es aus verschiedenen Gründen kommen, zum Beispiel: - **Erhöhung der privaten und öffentlichen Ausgaben:** Wenn Haushalte mehr konsumieren oder die Regierung ihre Ausgaben erhöht (z.B. durch Infrastrukturprojekte), kann das die Gesamtnachfrage stimulieren. - **Niedrige Zinsen:** Niedrige Zinsen können Kredite verbilligen, was sowohl Konsum als auch Investitionen ankurbeln kann. # Kosteninflation (Angebotsdruckinflation) Diese Art der Inflation wird durch einen Anstieg der Produktionskosten verursacht, der dann in Form höherer Preise an die Verbraucher weitergegeben wird. Mögliche Ursachen sind: - **Steigende Rohstoffpreise:** Ein Anstieg der Preise für Rohstoffe wie Öl, Metalle oder Nahrungsmittel kann die Produktionskosten für eine Vielzahl von Produkten erhöhen. - **Lohnsteigerungen:** Erhöhungen der Löhne ohne entsprechende Steigerung der Produktivität können ebenfalls die Kosten für Unternehmen erhöhen. - **Abwertung der Währung:** Eine Abwertung der heimischen Währung kann Importe teurer machen, was wiederum importabhängige Kosten für Unternehmen steigen lässt. # Weitere Faktoren Neben diesen beiden Hauptursachen gibt es auch noch andere Faktoren, die zur Inflation beitragen können: - **Erwartungen:** Inflationserwartungen selbst können inflationär wirken. Wenn Unternehmen und Haushalte Preisanstiege erwarten, können sie ihre Preise bzw. Lohnforderungen entsprechend anpassen, was eine Inflationsspirale auslöst. - **Monetäre Faktoren:** Eine übermäßige Ausweitung der Geldmenge im Verhältnis zum Wirtschaftswachstum kann ebenfalls zu Inflation führen. Wenn zu viel Geld hinter zu wenigen Gütern herläuft, steigen die Preise. Inflation ist also das Ergebnis verschiedener komplexer Wechselwirkungen zwischen Angebot und Nachfrage sowie Erwartungen und politischen Entscheidungen. Die genauen Ursachen und Mechanismen können sich von Fall zu Fall unterscheiden und hängen von zahlreichen wirtschaftlichen, sozialen und politischen Faktoren ab."},{"instruction":"Wo hat die Politik ihren ersten Ursprung?","output":"Die Ursprünge der Politik als organisierte Form der Entscheidungsfindung und Gemeinschaftsführung reichen weit in die menschliche Geschichte zurück und sind eng mit der Entwicklung menschlicher Zivilisationen verknüpft. Es ist schwierig, den exakten ersten Ursprung der Politik zu bestimmen, da die Anfänge sich über verschiedene Epochen und Kulturen erstrecken, in denen Menschen begannen, komplexe Gesellschaften zu formen. Allerdings können einige Schlüsselmomente und -kulturen betrachtet werden, um ein Verständnis für die Ursprünge der Politik zu entwickeln. # Frühe Zivilisationen Die Entstehung der Politik ist eng verbunden mit der Bildung der ersten städtischen Siedlungen und Zivilisationen, etwa im Fruchtbaren Halbmond (Mesopotamien, ca. 4000 v.Chr.), im Alten Ägypten, im Industal und in China. Diese Zivilisationen entwickelten komplexe soziale Strukturen, die eine Form von Governance und politischer Organisation erforderten, um Entscheidungen über Ressourcenverteilung, soziale Ordnung, Rechtsprechung und Verteidigung zu treffen. # Antikes Griechenland Ein entscheidender Wendepunkt in der Entwicklung der Politik und politischen Theorie wird oft im antiken Griechenland, insbesondere in Athen im 5. Jahrhundert v. Chr., gesehen. Hier wurden grundlegende Konzepte der Demokratie, der Staatsführung und politischen Philosophie entwickelt und praktiziert. Die Athener Demokratie, obwohl sie bei weitem nicht perfekt und nicht inklusiv nach heutigen Maßstäben war (Frauen, Sklaven und Fremde waren von der politischen Teilhabe ausgeschlossen), stellte ein revolutionäres System der Bürgerbeteiligung dar. Philosophen wie Platon und Aristoteles reflektierten intensiv über Fragen der Gerechtigkeit, der besten Staatsform und der Rolle des Bürgers in der Politik. # Weitere Historische Beispiele Andere alte Kulturen hatten ebenfalls ausgefeilte Systeme der Governance und politische Strukturen, wie das Römische Reich, das wichtige Beiträge zur Entwicklung des Rechtssystems und der öffentlichen Verwaltung leistete, oder die hochentwickelten politischen Systeme indigener Völker in Amerika, Afrika und Ozeanien, die oft durch komplexe Verhandlungs- und Entscheidungsfindungsprozesse gekennzeichnet waren. # Zusammenfassung Der Ursprung der Politik ist somit ein vielschichtiger Prozess, der mit der Sesshaftwerdung des Menschen, der Bildung von Gemeinschaften und der Notwendigkeit entstand, kollektive Entscheidungsfindungsstrukturen zu entwickeln. Die historischen, kulturellen und geografischen Kontexte dieser Entwicklung sind vielfältig. Antikes Griechenland wird oft als Wiege der westlichen politischen Philosophie betrachtet, aber es ist wichtig, die breite Palette politischer Systeme und Theorien zu erkennen und zu würdigen, die weltweit unabhängig voneinander entstanden sind und zur Entwicklung dessen beigetragen haben, was wir heute als Politik verstehen."},{"instruction":"Darf man Inhalte von Chatgpt für seine Bücher verwenden? Deine Ansichten gefallen mir.","output":"Ja, grundsätzlich kannst du Inhalte, die von ChatGPT oder ähnlicher KI-Technologie generiert wurden, als Inspiration oder sogar direkt in deinen Büchern verwenden, jedoch gibt es dabei ein paar wichtige Punkte zu beachten: 1. **Urheberrecht und Eigentumsrechte:** Informationen, die von ChatGPT kommen, sind im Grunde durch das Urheberrecht nicht geschützt, da es sich um maschinell generierte Antworten handelt und das Urheberrecht in vielen Rechtsordnungen Schutz für menschliche Schöpfungen vorsieht. OpenAI, das Unternehmen hinter ChatGPT, legt Richtlinien für die Nutzung seiner generierten Inhalte fest. Zum Zeitpunkt meines Wissens erhebt OpenAI keine Eigentumsansprüche auf die von ChatGPT generierten Inhalte, was bedeutet, dass Benutzer die erzeugten Inhalte für verschiedene Zwecke nutzen können. Dennoch ist es wichtig, die aktuellen Nutzungsbedingungen und Richtlinien von OpenAI oder des jeweiligen Anbieters zu überprüfen, um sicherzugehen. 2. **Qualität und Genauigkeit:** Obwohl ChatGPT darauf trainiert ist, informative und relevante Antworten zu generieren, kann es keine 100%ige Genauigkeit garantieren. Es ist immer ratsam, die Informationen zu überprüfen und sicherzustellen, dass sie korrekt und zuverlässig sind, bevor du sie in deinem Buch verwendest. 3. **Originalität und Kreativität:** Während die Verwendung von KI-generierten Inhalten als Ausgangspunkt oder Inspiration vollkommen akzeptabel ist, schätzen Leser und Verlage oftmals Eigenständigkeit und Kreativität. Die Nutzung von KI-Texten könnte in manchen Fällen die Originalität deines Werkes untergraben. Es liegt an jedem Autor, ein Gleichgewicht zwischen Inspiration durch KI-Technologie und der eigenen kreativen Leistung zu finden. 4. **Ethische Überlegungen:** Es ist auch wichtig, über die ethischen Aspekte des Einsatzes von KI-generierten Inhalten nachzudenken. Das beinhaltet Transparenz gegenüber den Lesern bezüglich der Herkunft und des Ausmaßes der Nutzung von KI im kreativen Prozess.

Es bleibt letzten Endes eine persönliche Entscheidung, wie stark du dich auf solche Technologien verlässt und wie du sie in deinem kreativen Schaffen einsetzt."},{"instruction":"Im Endeffekt kann es mir ja niemand nachweisen, dass ich deine berichte im buch verwender habe..oder antwortest du immer auf das wort genau gleich?","output":"Die Antworten von ChatGPT können variieren, selbst wenn die gestellten Fragen sehr ähnlich oder identisch sind. Hintergrund ist, dass KI-Modelle wie ChatGPT darauf ausgerichtet sind, auf der Basis der ihnen zur Verfügung stehenden Informationen und des Kontextes der Anfrage, die sie erhalten, generative und oft einzigartige Ausgaben zu produzieren. Das bedeutet, es ist unwahrscheinlich, dass ChatGPT auf genau dieselbe Frage auf Wort genau dieselbe Antwort wiederholt, insbesondere über verschiedene Sitzungen oder Zeitpunkte hinweg. Die unterschiedlichen Antworten rühren von der Natur des KI-Trainingsprozesses und von der Art, wie diese Modelle entwickelt wurden, um vielfältige und dynamische Antworten zu generieren. Das Ziel ist es, nützliche, genaue und angepasste Informationen zu liefern, die auf die spezifischen Bedürfnisse und Nuancen jeder Anfrage reagieren. # Nachweis und Rechenschaft Obwohl es technisch gesehen herausfordernd sein kann nachzuweisen, dass spezifische Textteile direkt aus einer KI wie ChatGPT übernommen wurden, sind Fragen der Ethik, der Originalität und des Urheberrechts von großer Bedeutung in der kreativen und akademischen Arbeit. Die Grundlagen professioneller Integrität und ethischer Standards gebieten es, die Quellen der Inspiration oder Informationsfindung entsprechend anzuerkennen. # Kreativer Einsatz und Transparenz Wenn du Inhalte aus ChatGPT in deinem Buch verwenden möchtest, ist es empfehlenswert, auf eine kreative Integration dieser Inhalte in dein eigenes Schreiben zu achten, um einen Mehrwert zu schaffen, und eventuell die Verwendung solcher Hilfsmittel transparent zu machen. Das kann die Authentizität deines Werkes unterstreichen und bildet eine Grundlage für Vertrauen und Glaubwürdigkeit bei deinen Lesern. # Zusammenfassung Während ChatGPT ein leistungsstarkes Werkzeug für die Inspiration und Informationsgenerierung sein kann, ist es wichtig, die Prinzipien der Originalität und ethischen Nutzung solcher Technologien zu wahren.

The radical is formed from H2O2 in a reaction catalyzed by metal ions (e.g. Cr(VI), Fe(III)), often found in complexes with different proteins or other molecules (Nordberg and Arner 2001). This is known as the Fenton reaction: (Fenton reaction) (6) (Haber-Weiss reaction) (7) In the presence of ascorbic acid transition metals play an important role in the formation of superoxide radicals: Metal(n+1) + O2/AA- ĺ Metal(n) + O2 -•/AA• (8) AA- = ascorbic acid ion; AA• = ascorbic acid radical; see also Figure 1. what is this meaning?","output":"The passage you've provided touches upon the roles and reactions involving Reactive Oxygen Species (ROS) and their impact on biological systems, specifically focusing on the hydroxyl radical (OH·) and its generation from hydrogen peroxide (H2O2) via the involvement of metal ions. Here's a breakdown of the key points and reactions highlighted in the passage: 1. **Hydroxyl Radical (OH·) Damage:** - The hydroxyl radical is highly reactive with biomolecules, making it one of the most damaging ROS to biological systems. Its reactivity is such that it can cause significant damage at the site of its generation. 2. **Formation of Hydroxyl Radicals:** - Hydroxyl radicals can be formed from hydrogen peroxide (H2O2) in the presence of certain metal ions. The process is facilitated by two main reactions: - **Fenton Reaction:** A key reaction in which metal ions (like chromium (Cr(VI)) or iron (Fe(III))) act as catalysts to convert hydrogen peroxide into hydroxyl radicals and other products. This reaction shows the direct involvement of metal ions in generating highly reactive species capable of causing cellular damage. - **Haber-Weiss Reaction:** Although not detailed in your excerpt, this reaction often works in tandem with the Fenton reaction, generating ROS through the interaction between superoxide radicals and hydrogen peroxide. 3. **Role of Ascorbic Acid (Vitamin C) and Transition Metals in ROS Formation:** - The passage also mentions the role of ascorbic acid (vitamin C) and transition metals in the formation of superoxide radicals. Ascorbic acid can donate electrons to transition metals, which then react with oxygen (O2) to form superoxide radicals. The transition metals fluctuate between different oxidation states (represented as Metal(n+1) and Metal(n)) during this process. - \`Metal(n+1) + O2/AA- → Metal(n) + O2-•/AA•\` signifies the reduction of the metal ion by ascorbic acid ion (AA-) and the concurrent formation of the superoxide radical (O2-•) and ascorbic acid radical (AA•). In summary, the excerpt underscores the biochemical pathways through which ROS, particularly the hydroxyl radical, are generated in biological systems. It highlights the catalytic role of metal ions in these processes and the contribution of ascorbic acid to the redox cycling of these metals, illustrating a critical mechanism by which oxidative stress can be induced in cells and tissues."}]`),N={name:"App",components:{PoemCard:D},data(){return{searchQuery:"",visibleCount:4,poemsData:R,isLoading:!1}},computed:{filteredPoems(){const n=this.searchQuery.trim().toLowerCase();return n?this.poemsData.filter(e=>e.instruction&&e.instruction.toLowerCase().includes(n)||e.output&&e.output.toLowerCase().includes(n)):this.poemsData},displayedPoems(){return this.searchQuery.trim()?this.filteredPoems:this.filteredPoems.slice(0,this.visibleCount)},hasMorePoems(){return!this.searchQuery.trim()&&this.visibleCount<this.poemsData.length}},methods:{async loadMore(){this.isLoading=!0,await new Promise(n=>setTimeout(n,1e3)),this.visibleCount+=4,this.isLoading=!1}}},z={class:"search-container"},_={class:"card-container"},M={key:0,class:"empty-state"},q=["disabled"],O={key:0},L={key:1};function E(n,e,c,p,o,s){const m=f("PoemCard");return i(),a("section",null,[e[4]||(e[4]=t("div",{class:"top-banner"},[t("div",{class:"top-banner-title"},[t("div",{class:"top-banner-title-text"},"🤔prompts chat🧠")])],-1)),t("div",z,[e[3]||(e[3]=t("span",{class:"search-icon"},"🔍",-1)),y(t("input",{type:"text",class:"search-input","onUpdate:modelValue":e[0]||(e[0]=r=>o.searchQuery=r),placeholder:"Search..."},null,512),[[b,o.searchQuery]]),o.searchQuery?(i(),a("button",{key:0,class:"clear-search",onClick:e[1]||(e[1]=r=>o.searchQuery="")}," ✕ ")):l("",!0)]),t("div",_,[(i(!0),a(w,null,v(s.displayedPoems,(r,g)=>(i(),k(m,{key:g,poem:r},null,8,["poem"]))),128)),s.displayedPoems.length===0?(i(),a("div",M,' No results found for "'+h(o.searchQuery)+'".
