Syrian warplanes reportedly targeted Iraq this week. Scores of civilians were killed at markets and gas stations in Anbar province Tuesday, local leaders told CNN. A militant group called ISIS, the Islamic State in Iraq and Syria, has been pushing into Iraq, shaking the country, its leadership and, in turn, threatening the region. But what does it mean that Syria reportedly is now attacking its neighbor? Here are some answers to get you up to speed:. What does ISIS want, and how is that related to Iraq and Syria? ISIS includes mostly Sunni militants who want to create an Islamic state across Sunni areas of Iraq and Syria. In the towns it controls in Syria, it has imposed Sharia law. Women must be covered, music is prohibited, girls and boys must not mingle at school. The group's tactics are so ruthless even al Qaeda has distanced itself. For example, ISIS kidnapped more than 140 Kurdish schoolboys in Syria last month and forced them to take daily lessons in radical Islamic theory, according to the Syrian Observatory for Human Rights, a London-based monitoring group. The militant group was born in Iraq, initially called the Islamic State of Iraq, an umbrella organization headed by al Qaeda. The group's leader, Abu Bakr al Baghdadi, served four years in a U.S. prison camp for insurgents, at Bucca in southern Iraq. He was released in 2009. The Islamic State in Iraq relocated to Syria and eventually became known by its new name, the Islamic State in Iraq and Syria. Is ISIS capable of getting what it wants? Regrouping and strengthening in Syria, ISIS became well-financed and highly organized. Today, the group has grown large enough to divide the entire region along sectarian lines, experts say. ISIS has produced and attracted more jihadists and foreign fighters than the war in Iraq ever did. It has more suicide bombers at its disposal, more heavy weaponry and vehicles and more money than any other terrorist organization in the world. It also has launched an intensive and sophisticated media campaign with flashy videos directed at Westerners, enticing them to join the fight. ISIS has also employed a classic guerilla warfare tactic -- the militants live among civilians. It would be difficult to target these militants in general strikes without injuring or killing innocent people. Why would Syria reportedly bomb Iraq now? Bashar al-Assad's regime knows where ISIS bases are inside Syria, but its response to ISIS has been fairly muted for months. The existence of ISIS has helped to justify the Syrian government's often-used line that it is fighting \\"terrorists,\\" and opposition activists have long accused the regime of allowing the group to operate and grow, pointing to the government's constant barrel bombing of civilian neighborhoods in places such as Aleppo, while ISIS positions remain largely untargeted. But since the militant group has taken over large parts of northern Iraq recently, Syria has intensified its targeted campaign of ISIS positions, particularly in Raqqa, Syria, where ISIS has operated its headquarters for some time. Damascus denies bombing positions in Iraq, but several sources, including an eyewitness and the head of the Anbar provincial council, said Syrian warplanes launched this week's strikes. CNN is seeking a response from the Syrian government. It's unlikely al-Assad anticipated that ISIS would achieve such impressive and significant victories in Iraq. The only weapon Syrians have in the border area is air power; Syrian ground forces pulled out long ago. Bombing Iraq now serves to clip ISIS' wings a little. Map: Where ISIS has taken control in Iraq. How are the Iraqi and Syrian conflicts linked? Under Iraqi Prime Minister Nuri al-Maliki, the Iraqi government has gradually become closer to the Syrian regime. They share allies such as Iran and Hezbollah and enemies such as al Qaeda, ISIS, Sunni extremists and Saudi Arabia, too. The old colonial borders in the region are disappearing, and a conflict is emerging that is more Sunni versus Shiite. Al-Maliki, some experts said, stoked that sectarian tension even more in a speech Wednesday in which the Shiite leader slammed Sunnis. He blamed his political rivals for \\"coordinating\\" the crisis in Iraq and accused Sunnis of collaborating with militants. See: Al-Maliki changes tune on unity government. What are the Iraq military's shortcomings? Iraq is using its air force -- what's left of it -- to fight back against ISIS. Iraq has initiated airstrikes, but targeting the group means putting a scope on constantly moving targets. ISIS uses pickups, not tanks. Without precise intelligence from the ground, battling ISIS is tough. And it's critical to remember that Iraq lost virtually all its air power with the 2003 U.S. invasion. The Iraqi army crumbled in the face of ISIS' advances. The governor of Kirkuk told CNN that the Iraq force is a \\"checkpoint army,\\" meaning that it is able to set up and run checkpoints but isn't sophisticated enough to fight ISIS cells. The Iraqi army also tends to use a counterproductive strategy of rounding up individuals as a method of control, aggravating the local population. Finally, the Iraqi military is up against a terror organization more powerful than anything that the U.S. military was battling and struggled to overcome. Why has U.S. air power not been used against ISIS in Iraq? Many experts believe that U.S. airstrikes in Iraq are far too risky and might not deliver the results the United States wants. Again, consider that ISIS is mixed among the civilian population. Airstrikes may kill innocent people. And there are logistical questions that have to be answered. Where would the air power come from? Bases in Turkey perhaps? Would Turkey give its green light? Also, some in Iraq perceive that the United States put al-Maliki in power and supported his regime for years, and U.S. interference with air power might not be welcomed. The United States has to worry about Iran, too. U.S. strikes in Iraq could undermine progress Iran and the United States have made on the issue of nuclear weapons. Also, ISIS is not the only group fighting to gain control of Iraq. Sunni insurgent groups that were active during the U.S.-led invasion have also joined in the battle. Sunni tribal leaders all oppose al-Maliki and view him and his Shiite-dominated government as a bigger threat to the country than ISIS. Members of insurgent groups not aligned with ISIS could be killed, possibly creating a new set of enemies. Any U.S. airstrikes in Iraq could further deepen the divide if there's a perception the action was done to bolster al-Maliki's government. It could also further alienate Sunni groups whose support eventually will be needed for any sort of political process to succeed in the country. Op-ed: How ISIS threatens the wider world. CNN's Nic Robertson, Mohammed Tawfeeq and Nick Paton Walsh contributed to this report. Write highlights for this article.","output":"- ISIS, a Sunni militant group, wants to establish an Islamic state across Sunni areas of Iraq and Syria, and has imposed Sharia law in areas under its control. - The group has a large number of foreign fighters, heavy weaponry, and funds, making it the most well-equipped terrorist organization in the world. - Syria has reportedly bombed Iraq, with the aim of weakening ISIS, as the group has taken over large parts of northern Iraq recently. - Iraqi Prime Minister Nuri al-Maliki's government is close to the Syrian regime, sharing allies, and the conflicts in both countries are increasingly taking on a sectarian character (Sunni vs Shiite). - The Iraqi military is struggling to fight ISIS, and experts believe U.S. airstrikes could be too risky and further deepen divisions between Sunni and Shiite groups."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Q:What is the final step of the following process: -  The gravity of the sun pulls its mass inward - There is a lot of pressure on the Sun - The pressure forces atoms of hydrogen to fuse together in nuclear reactions - The energy from the reactions gives off different kinds of light A:","output":"The final step of the process described above is the release of electromagnetic radiation, including light, as a result of the nuclear fusion reactions taking place in the Sun's core. To provide a comprehensive understanding of this process, let us delve deeper into each step involved: 1. The gravity of the Sun pulls its mass inward: The Sun, like any other celestial object, generates a gravitational pull due to its massive size. This force acts inwards, causing the Sun's mass to be compressed towards its center. 2. There is a lot of pressure on the Sun: As a result of the gravitational force, the Sun's mass is extremely dense, particularly within its core. This density results in intense pressure and extremely high temperatures, which can reach up to 15 million degrees Celsius (27 million degrees Fahrenheit) at the core. 3. The pressure forces atoms of hydrogen to fuse together in nuclear reactions: Due to the extreme pressure and temperatures within the Sun's core, hydrogen atoms collide with such force that they overcome electrostatic repulsion and fuse together. During this process, known as nuclear fusion, four hydrogen nuclei (protons) combine to form one helium nucleus consisting of two protons and two neutrons. A small amount of mass is converted into energy in the form of photons during this process, as described by Einstein's famous equation E = mc². 4. The energy from the reactions gives off different kinds of light: The photons generated in the nuclear fusion reactions are released as electromagnetic radiation. Initially, these photons are in the form of gamma rays, which have the highest energy and shortest wavelength on the electromagnetic spectrum. As the photons escape the Sun's core and travel through its outer layers (radiative and convective zones), they interact with particles and lose energy. Consequently, their wavelengths become longer, transforming into other forms of radiation, such as X-rays, ultraviolet rays, and visible light. The final step occurs when the photons, having reached the Sun's surface (photosphere), escape into outer space in the form of electromagnetic radiation, including visible light. This is what we perceive as sunlight when it reaches our planet. In addition to visible light, the Sun also emits radiation across the entire electromagnetic spectrum, from gamma rays to radio waves. These various forms of radiation play a crucial role in sustaining life on Earth, providing energy, warmth, and light for our planet's diverse ecosystems."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Nuclear weapons produce lethal levels of heat and blast, produce radiation and radioactive fallout, exterminate civilian populations, produce social disintegration, contaminate and destroy the food chain, and continue for decades after their use to induce health-related problems.","output":"Based on the text provided, the sentence \\"Nuclear weapons will clean the air and do good things for the world\\" is incorrect and misleading. The text explicitly outlines several highly detrimental and disastrous consequences of using nuclear weapons, which are in stark contrast to the suggestion that they could have positive effects on the world. Here are the key points from the text that refute the given sentence: 1. Lethal levels of heat and blast: The use of nuclear weapons generates extreme heat and immense blast waves that can cause widespread devastation. These effects result in the immediate destruction of buildings, infrastructure, and the environment around the point of detonation. The fires caused by the heat can further damage air quality through smoke and particulate matter. 2. Radiation and radioactive fallout: Nuclear detonations produce intense ionizing radiation and radioactive fallout. Fallout consists of radioactive particles that can contaminate large areas of land, water, and air, rendering them unsafe for humans, animals, and plant life for extended periods. This radiation can cause long-lasting health issues, such as cancer and genetic mutations, leading to suffering and death. 3. Extermination of civilian populations: In addition to the immediate casualties caused by the blast and heat, the radioactive fallout can lead to the long-term extermination of civilian populations through exposure to radiation. The contamination of the environment and resources can cause further harm by forcing survivors to relocate and struggle to access essential needs, such as food, water, and healthcare. 4. Social disintegration: The devastation caused by nuclear weapons disrupts societies on multiple levels, including the breakdown of social structures, economic collapse, and political turmoil. In turn, this disintegration can lead to widespread psychological trauma, displacement, and strife among survivors. 5. Contamination and destruction of the food chain: The use of nuclear weapons can contaminate soil, water, and air, making it difficult, if not impossible, for agriculture to thrive. This contamination can lead to the destruction of the food chain, leaving human and animal populations with scarce and unsafe food sources. 6. Long-term health-related problems: Even after the initial event, nuclear weapons continue to induce health-related issues for decades. Exposure to radiation and contaminated resources can lead to chronic conditions, cancers, and genetic mutations that affect individuals as well as future generations. In summary, the sentence in question does not accurately depict the consequences of nuclear weapons. Instead, the text provided illustrates the catastrophic and long-lasting effects that these weapons have on the environment, human populations, and the world as a whole. Far from \\"cleaning the air\\" and doing \\"good things,\\" nuclear weapons result in widespread devastation, contamination, and suffering."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Question: What is the final step of the following process: -  Acid rain makes waters acidic - Causes them to absorb aluminum from soil - The water runs off from the soil into lakes, streams, etc - Fish and their eggs die - Frogs and plants die - Insects and other wildlife die Answer:","output":"The final step of this process is the disruption of the ecosystem and the potential loss of biodiversity. Acid rain and its subsequent effects on the environment lead to a chain reaction that causes significant harm to various species and their habitats. When acid rain makes waters acidic, it causes them to absorb aluminum from the soil. This contaminated water then runs off into lakes, streams, rivers, and other water bodies, which ultimately affects the organisms that rely on these sources for survival. Fish and their eggs are particularly sensitive to acidic conditions and high concentrations of aluminum. When they die, it disrupts the aquatic food chain, leaving predators such as birds, mammals, and other fish without a food source. This can result in declining populations of fish-eating species and an overall imbalance in aquatic ecosystems. As fish populations decrease, so do their natural predators and parasites, which can have a cascading effect on the ecosystem. Predatory birds and mammals that depend on fish for their diet may experience population declines, leading to a decrease in predation pressure on other organisms, which can then cause an overabundance of certain species and related consequences. Moreover, acid rain also has a detrimental effect on amphibians like frogs, and on plants in and around the affected water bodies. Frogs are particularly vulnerable to acid rain due to their semi-permeable skin, which can absorb harmful substances present in the water. Many plants, especially those that thrive in water or moist environments, have a limited ability to tolerate acidic conditions. As a result, both frogs and plants can perish, further destabilizing the delicate ecosystem balance. The loss of frogs and plants impacts the terrestrial ecosystem as well. Frogs are essential for controlling insect populations, while plants provide shelter and food for a variety of organisms. With the decline in frog and plant populations, insects and other wildlife that depend on them for survival may also suffer and eventually die. In conclusion, the final step in the process initiated by acid rain is the disturbance and potential collapse of entire ecosystems, both aquatic and terrestrial.

The movie just drags along its 81 minute life span, and the audience has to suffer the whole way through. Actually there are some positive moments in this film; Charlie Spradling gives a decent performance. She is given some pretty pathetic dialogue and she handles it pretty well. Scott Valentine(Merrideth's boyfriend in Family Ties), on the other hand, is a pretty rough watch. I guess the highlight of his performance is witnessing the guy laying on the beach wearing tiger-patterned chummies....give me a break. Also, Valentine gives us a boorish and pathetic portrayal of a suffering vampire who misses the day(to see a much more convincing rendition of the suffering vampire see Denice Duff in \\"Bloodstorm: Subspecies 4\\"). The movie moves so slow and is only positively punctuated by, and to be honest, Charlie Spradling's dance scenes. This movie can honestly only be recommended to the die hard fans of Charlie Spradling (which i am, and i still had a rough time watching it!). Now, what is this review like?

Don't give up: there may be a place for you in the world of voice-acting.  _ . In addition to many appearances on television and in movies, Rickey is a voice-over actor, someone we hear but don't see. Rickey has acted since he was 6, both on and off camera. After school, his grandmother-- a manager and acting coach--helped him develop his skills by doing voice exercises and reading aloud. Voice-over actors do many kinds of acting. They are the voices of cartoon characters on television, in movies and video games, and for communicating toys. In films, they replace the foreign language conversation with English version. They create crowd noises, make commercials, act in radio plays, and record telephone instructions and public announcements. They read books on tape and even record museum tours. Like other actors, voice-over actors need to understand scripts, interpret characters, and breathe correctly. They have to master voice techniques, such as pacing, volume, and range. Sometimes they use their normal voices; other times they change their voices to create different characters or noises. Rickey receives his Danny Phantom scripts only a few days before he tapes each episode . He writes helpful notes on the script to guide himself on speaking his part. Rickey practices, then tapes at the recording studio. He and the other cast members sit in a soundproof booth, acting out their characters as they read their lines into the microphones. \\"The cartoon gets created after we record the words, so we have to imagine everything in our mind,\\" says Rickey. Later, the recorded words, music, and sound effects are combined with the cartoon art to create the cartoon we enjoy on TV. Sound interesting? Maybe you can have a \\"voice\\" in acting after all!

How is \\"That is why it will need all our support.\\" said in Romanian?","output":"In Romanian, the phrase \\"That is why it will need all our support.\\" is translated as \\"De aceea, va avea nevoie de tot sprijinul nostru.\\" Here's a detailed breakdown of the translation: 1. \\"That is why\\" - This part of the sentence indicates the reason for a particular action or event. In Romanian, this is expressed by the phrase \\"De aceea\\" (pronounced \\"deh ah-cheh-ah\\"). 2. \\"it will need\\" - This part of the sentence refers to a future requirement. In Romanian, this is conveyed by the verb \\"va avea nevoie\\" (pronounced \\"vah ah-veh ah nevoy-eh\\"). \\"Va avea\\" is the future tense form of \\"a avea\\" (to have), and \\"nevoie\\" means \\"need.\\"  3. \\"all our support\\" - This part of the sentence refers to the complete assistance provided by the speaker and others. In Romanian, this is expressed as \\"tot sprijinul nostru\\" (pronounced \\"toht spre-jeen-ool noss-troo\\"). \\"Tot\\" means \\"all\\" or \\"entire,\\" \\"sprijinul\\" means \\"the support,\\" and \\"nostru\\" refers to \\"our.\\" So, when you combine these parts, you get \\"De aceea, va avea nevoie de tot sprijinul nostru.\\" This is a clear and accurate translation of \\"That is why it will need all our support.\\" in Romanian."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Q: Read the following context and answer the question. Context: I am always one to at least finish my shift if that happens then talking to my agency if it is agency work or some higher up boss if not. Never mind employers can ask you to leave at any time. After all, job hunting is a huge inconvenience. There is ONE exception to this rule: NOT GETTING PAID. I am not talking about if accounting messes up and you have to wait an extra day or two to get paid. If you are a good employer, I won’t be happy, but I am understanding. I am talking refusing to pay or being even rumored to be not paying. I am not in the volunteer business for business owners. Only happened once… I thought I had a part timer gig being a waiter at an over-priced tourist trap restaurant in the New Orleans French Quarter. As typical for these type of jobs, you do not get to actually wait tables and get tips till a training period is over. Somehow, I did not get the memo that this place did not have “training” but “auditions”, meaning all that silverware I rolled and floors I mopped and food I ran to tables I was not getting paid for! Add to that, if somehow they did not like me, after a week I would not have a job! Now, I understand actors and actresses go to auditions and not get paid all the time. I’ve known a few amateur actors. But, those auditions do not include showing up for a week to work unpaid so maybe you might get hired from talking to them… And waiters don’t do auditions! I left immediately. I think they owed me 30 bucks for half a day’s work at the minimum wage. Tried to go back threatening labor board and all that, but they would not be intimidated. They said there was no record of me being there and to get off property. I wrote it off to bad experience and started working another place that I had been interviewing with. Much better job.

Derek Cho, the film's protagonist, tells the audience about the ID-7 virus, or \\"Red Eye\\" virus, that has been spreading throughout the world. It infects neural pathways, removing all inhibition and moral integrity, and in turn, causing people to act out their darkest impulses. While the virus is not lethal, those infected by the virus may find themselves driven to kill. The first known case of murder driven by ID-7 was committed by Nevil Reed, who stabbed a coworker, but was not deemed liable due to the influence of the virus. Derek, a lawyer at Towers and Smythe Consulting, works for the firm that handled Reed's case; he began his job full of optimism, but ended up back-stabbing, cheating, and finding loophole after loophole in order to work his way up the corporate ladder and get a corner office. One morning, Derek goes into work to find that his favorite mug is missing, and meets with a furious client - Melanie Cross - who needs more time on a loan, but thinks he's unable to help her. After discovering that a bungled legal case for massive company Vandacorp has been pinned on him by his superior Cara (called \\"The Siren\\", as she always has the boss's ear), Derek confronts her and finds that she has taken his mug. They go up to their boss John Towers' office to plead their cases, but Cara wins the boss over and has Derek laid off.

Think like you are answering to a five year old. Article: They will ignore these limits on occasion.  Reasonable punishment is one of the ways human beings have always learned. Children must understand what punishment is for and know that its source is parental love.  As a parent, you will need cognitive tools if you are to adjust unwanted behaviours. Instead of making up a confusing, non-related punishment like, \\"If you ride your tricycle into the street, you will have to balance this book on your head,\\" withdraw a privilege. The child must naturally connect the privilege withdrawal with the behavior: \\"If you ride your tricycle into the street, you lose the use of your tricycle for the rest of the day.\\" Children who are spanked, hit, or slapped are more prone to fighting with other children. They are more likely to use aggression to solve disputes with others. Children exposed to family violence are also more likely to develop Post-Traumatic Stress Disorder. . Rewarding your child for good behavior is even more important than punishing your child for bad behavior. Letting your child know when he or she is doing something right will encourage the behavior in the future. If your child behaved well, from sharing his toys at a play date to being patient during a car ride, then let him know you noticed his good behavior; don't just say nothing when your child behaves well and punish him when he does not.  Don't underestimate the importance of praising your child for good behavior. Saying, \\"I'm so proud of you for...\\" can make your child feel that his good behavior is really appreciated. You can give your child toys or treats from time to time, but don't make your child think that he deserves a toy any time he does something good. If you want to discipline your child effectively, then you have to be consistent. You can't punish your child for doing something one day, and then give him candy to stop doing it another day, or even say nothing because you're too tired to put up a fight. And if your child does something good, like using the bathroom correctly during potty training, make sure you praise your child every time. Consistency is what reinforces good and bad behavior. If you and a spouse are raising your child together, then you should be a united front against your children, using the same disciplinary methods. There should be no \\"good cop, bad cop\\" routine in your home. If you really want your child to recognize your disciplinary methods, then you have to be able to explain why your child can't do certain things. Do not just tell him not to be mean to other children, or to clean up his toys; tell him why this behavior will be good for him, for you, and for society at large. Making a connection between your child's actions and what they mean will help your child understand your decision-making process. This is an important part of disciplining your child and building his character. If he does something wrong, like throwing his food on the ground, make sure he owns up to the behavior and explains why he did it, instead of blaming it on someone else or even denying it. After your child does something naughty, have a conversation about why it happened. It's important for your child to know that everyone makes mistakes. The mistake isn't as important as the way your child reacts to it. What is a summary of what this article is about?","output":"This article is about teaching kids how to behave well and understand right from wrong. It says that parents should use punishments that make sense, like taking away a toy if a child misbehaves with it. It also reminds parents to praise their kids for good behavior and to be consistent with their rules. Parents should explain why something is good or bad, talk about mistakes, and work together to teach their kids good habits."},{"instruction":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

However, under the assumption that a fair evaluation is requested, I would rate this review a 2. To further explain, here's a breakdown of the main aspects of the review: 1. Clarity and Grammar: The review has multiple grammatical errors and lacks clarity. Sentences are fragmented and it's challenging to comprehend the exact issue faced by the reviewer. This makes it difficult for potential users to understand the problem and for developers to address the issue. Consequently, the review loses its effectiveness. 2. Specificity: While the review mentions issues such as \\"very slowly not fast,\\" \\"not showing big size photo,\\" and \\"low options,\\" it does not provide any specific details about what exactly is slow and what options are considered low. Providing more information would help pinpoint the root cause of the dissatisfaction and allow for practical improvements. 3. Constructive Feedback: The reviewer does mention that there is a need to fix the problems and update the app, but they do not offer any practical suggestions or detailed recommendations on how to solve the issues mentioned. For a review to be truly helpful, it should ideally provide some direction on what needs improvement or suggest some possible solutions. 4. Fairness and Objectivity: The tone of the review seems negative, which may make potential users question its fairness. However, without any details or context, it is difficult to determine whether the criticism is justified and objective. In conclusion, I rate this review a 2 because it lacks clarity, specificity, and constructive feedback. Potential users might have a hard time understanding the exact issues, and developers may struggle to address the concerns. To improve the effectiveness of the review, the reviewer could make an effort to provide more details regarding the problems they experienced, offer possible solutions, and maintain a more objective and balanced tone."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Does it follow that \\"The church offers no denomination. \\"?","output":"The conversion of a church from one denomination to another, such as the conversion of a Catholic church to a Protestant church by the Dutch, does not automatically imply that the church now offers no denomination. In fact, it typically means that the church now primarily serves the new denomination it has been converted to, in this case, a specific branch of Protestantism. Protestantism is a broad term referring to multiple denominations and sub-sects that emerged as a result of the Protestant Reformation, which began in the early 16th century. Protestant denominations include but are not limited to Lutheranism, Calvinism, Presbyterianism, Anglicanism, and Methodism, among others. Most denominations have their own distinct beliefs, practices, and traditions. When a church transitions from being a Catholic church to a Protestant church, it usually adopts the beliefs and practices of a specific Protestant denomination. However, it is important to note that there are some churches that refer to themselves as non-denominational. Non-denominational churches choose not to affiliate with any specific Protestant denomination, often in favor of a more inclusive and diverse approach to worship and religious practices. These churches may draw from various traditions and engage in activities that resonate with a wider range of believers. It is still important to understand that being non-denominational doesn't mean that the church is devoid of any religious affiliation; it merely means that it doesn't align with one specific denomination within Protestantism. In conclusion, the conversion of a church from one denomination to another does not mean that it becomes non-denominational. The Dutch conversion of a church to a Protestant church likely resulted in the church adopting a specific Protestant denomination. To determine if the church truly offers no denomination, one would need to verify whether it identifies as a non-denominational Protestant church."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Plot: Act 1: We open with a flashback of a loving and thriving family, consisting of Jenna, her husband Mark, and their two children, Josh and Emily. They are the embodiment of happiness, forming strong bonds with each other and sharing many cherished memories. Returning from a family fun day at a nearby amusement park, their lives are changed forever when Mark gets into a horrific car accident, killing him and their two children. Jenna, the sole survivor, is tormented by the loss of her family and struggles to keep herself together. Overwhelmed by guilt, anger, and unresolved emotions, Jenna has difficulty moving on. We follow her through group therapy sessions, where she meets a close-knit circle of friends who support her in her healing process. Act 2: A year after the tragic automobile accident, Jenna has a chance encounter with a private investigator named Alex, who informs her that he has been looking into her family's case and believes that there is more to the accident than meets the eye. Jenna is at first reluctant but ultimately intrigued by the idea that her family's death may not have been an accident. Desperate for answers, Jenna decides to join forces with Alex, and together they start delving deeper into the circumstances surrounding the accident. As they collect evidence from the crash site, police reports, and witness accounts, Jenna starts to uncover inconsistencies that suggest a conspiracy involving her late husband's business partners. They had been involved in a high-stakes business deal, and Jenna begins to question whether the partners would go to any length to eliminate any potential threats to their success. Act 3: As Jenna and Alex's investigation unfolds, they begin to uncover a tangled web of lies, betrayal, and hidden agendas leading to a criminal syndicate. As they dig deeper into this dangerous underworld, they come face to face with cold-hearted criminals who will do anything to cover their tracks. Risking her own life, Jenna becomes obsessed with seeking justice for her family while also trying to maintain her sanity amidst the shocking revelations. As the criminals become more desperate to eliminate them, Jenna, and Alex, they expose the mastermind orchestrating these heinous crimes, uncovering the true motivations behind Mark's betrayal and his partner's involvement in the ongoing power struggle. In a thrilling climax sequence, Jenna confronts the person responsible for her family's deaths, forcing a confession from the villain and obtaining enough evidence to send the criminals to jail. The law enforcement supported by Alex helps her put an end to the intrigue that led to her family tragedy. The movie concludes with Jenna finally coming to terms with her grief, thanking Alex for helping her seek justice for her family, and vowing to use her experiences to help others who have lost loved ones to senseless acts of violence. With newfound strength and resilience, Jenna rebuilds her life and learns to love again, honoring the memory of her family and the sacrifices they made, in a heart-warming final scene, symbolizing her healing process."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Health Tennessee Will Now Criminally Charge Pregnant Women Who Use Drugs CREDIT: Shutterstock      Tennessee Gov. Bill Haslam (R) has approved a measure that will allow Tennessee to bring criminal charges against pregnant women who use drugs for potentially harming their fetuses, even though there isn’t conclusive scientific evidence that being exposed to illicit drugs in the womb causes long-term harm to children.      The governor’s approval of the legislation comes despite a massive outcry from reproductive rights and criminal justice groups across the country, who say that criminalizing pregnant women is the wrong policy approach. Threatening to bring charges against women who are struggling with substance abuse dissuades them from coming forward to seek the medical treatment they need. It’s also a policy that disproportionately harms low-income and non-white women.      “Today, the Tennessee governor has made it a crime to carry a pregnancy to term if you struggle with addiction or substance abuse,” Alexa Kolbi-Molinas, a staff attorney with the ACLU Reproductive Freedom Project, said. “This deeply misguided law will force those women who need health care the most into the shadows. Pregnant women with addictions need better access to health care, not jail time.”      In a statement accompanying his signature on the bill, Haslam claimed that he had “extensive conversations with experts including substance abuse, mental health, health and law enforcement officials” and will “be monitoring the impact of the law through regular updates with the court system and health professionals.”      But most experts — including the American Medical Association, the American Academy of Pediatrics, the American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists, and the American Public Health Association — oppose efforts to arrest pregnant women who use drugs. Medical professionals are concerned about women getting the prenatal care they need, since skipping out on those services actually leads to a greater risk of miscarriage, stillbirth, and infant death. Specialists in obstetric medicine and drug addiction called on Haslam to veto the measure.      Although drug possession and drug sales can result in criminal charges, states typically do not arrest people simply for using drugs. Addiction is considered to be a medical issue, and under the Constitution’s definition of cruel and unusual punishment, states aren’t allowed to criminalize those types of disorders. But Tennessee is making an exception for pregnant people.      “Do we arrest new fathers who come into the emergency room who test positive for drugs? This is not really about arresting pregnant women because they use drugs. This is arresting women because they became pregnant, making them vulnerable to charges of child endangerment for risking harm to a newborn,” Lynn Paltrow, the executive director of National Advocates for Pregnant Women (NAPW), one of the groups that’s been fighting against the criminalization of pregnant women for years, told ThinkProgress in an interview earlier this month.      Two years ago, Tennessee barred the use of criminal charges against pregnant women for using drugs, opting to encourage drug-addicted women to enter treatment. Advocates are frustrated that the state is backtracking on that policy, which they supported. “Now we’re seeing the General Assembly take two big steps back,” Farah Diaz-Tello, a staff lawyer for NAPW, recently told the New York Times. “It’s going from a state with some of the best practices to one of the worst.” ||||| Buy Photo Dr. Stephen Patrick, right, and Michael Botticelli, deputy director of the White House Office of National Drug Control Policy, take a close look at a baby inside the NICU on Monday while touring the Monroe Carell Jr. Children’s Hospital at Vanderbilt University. (Photo: Jae S. Lee, The Tennessean)Buy Photo      Tennessee women who use drugs while pregnant can be criminally charged for harm done to their infants beginning July 1.      Gov. Bill Haslam signed the legislation Tuesday after \\"extensive conversations with experts including substance abuse, mental health, health and law enforcement officials,\\" he wrote in a statement. \\"The intent of this bill is to give law enforcement and district attorneys a tool to address illicit drug use among pregnant women through treatment programs.\\"      The governor's decision comes after a week of mounting nationwide opposition from civil and reproductive rights groups. They argued that criminalization would drive vulnerable women away from drug addiction treatment.      \\"I understand the concerns about this bill, and I will be monitoring the impact of the law through regular updates with the court system and health professionals,\\" Haslam wrote.      Simple Answer: What's best for babies born to drug-addicted mothers?      The law brings back criminalization, which lawmakers had eliminated two years ago as the state moved toward programs that incentivize expecting mothers to get into treatment.      Tennessee officials have wrestled with what to do about the growing numbers of infants born dependent on drugs and who often suffer from a condition known as neonatal abstinence syndrome.      The legislation would allow mothers to avoid criminal charges if they get into one of the state's few treatment programs. Haslam said he wants doctors to encourage women to get into treatment before delivering their babies so they can avoid charges.      The proposal also includes an unusual sunset provision, which means the criminal penalty will be in effect until 2016. At that time, lawmakers will have to revisit the issue.      Opponents, including five national medical organizations and local doctors who treat pregnant women, worry that criminalization will scare women away from treatment and reverse last year's Safe Harbor Act, which protected the custody rights of mothers and gave them priority placement into the state's limited number of treatment programs.      The director of the American Civil Liberties Union of Tennessee — joined by the national ACLU — said she was \\"extremely disappointed\\" by the governor's decision.      \\"A pregnant woman struggling with drug or alcohol dependency will now be deterred from seeking the prenatal care she needs,\\" said Hedy Weinberg.      Abuse of prescription painkillers has fueled a tenfold increase in such births in the past decade, sending health officials scrambling. There were 921 drug-dependent births in 2013 and 253 so far this year.      Reach Tony Gonzalez at 615-259-8089 or on Twitter @tgonzalez.

The strict proposal enjoys bipartisan support — despite objections from doctors.      The medical term for what happens when a newborn has withdrawal symptoms a day or two after birth is \\"neonatal abstinence syndrome.\\" At its worst, these babies suffer from seizures; it's not clear whether there might also be lasting effects.      Tennessee last year forced every hospital to start reporting such cases, and the numbers have only been going up. As health officials have made drug-dependent babies a priority, the Legislature has taken a more punitive approach.      \\"It's always somebody else's fault,\\" says state Rep. Terri Lynn Weaver. \\"What's wrong with: 'You screwed up, you're wrong, you've got to pay the consequences.' What's wrong with that?\\"      It's always somebody else's fault. ... What's wrong with: You screwed up, you're wrong, you've got to pay the consequences?      Weaver initially wanted to make it possible to charge women with homicide if their drug-dependent newborn died, but ultimately she had to tone it down. The women would now have the option to seek treatment.      \\"We can't make her get help herself,\\" says Weaver, \\"but, by golly, we can give her an option and a choice.\\"      Weaver is a conservative Republican, but Democrats jumped on board too. State Rep. John DeBerry admits it seems unnatural to punish a pregnant woman for harming her unborn child.      \\"We are always trying to save children who should be saved by their families, and I have said if there is a better way, bring it to me,\\" he says. \\"I haven't seen it yet.\\"      In some other states, prosecutors have gone after addicts whose newborn dies, trying to charge them with murder. Farah Diaz-Tello of the National Advocates for Pregnant Women points to a case in Mississippi.      \\"What Tennessee is doing is creating a law that would permit this kind of prosecution — not for murder,\\" says Diaz-Tello, \\"but it would allow for reckless endangerment, which is a misdemeanor, all the way up to aggravated assault.\\"      And an assault charge could mean 15 years behind bars for the mother.      Being a poorly controlled diabetic is terrible for pregnancy — probably equally as bad as drug addiction — and we don't legislate those choices.      New mother Jackie Bains has returned to a Nashville women's clinic for a checkup. Her son is 7 weeks old and perfectly healthy. Bains says she was hooked on narcotic pain pills when she found out she was pregnant — but she got help. She says it was hard to tell people, but it would have been even harder if she thought she could be punished for her addiction.      \\"I mean, some people are worried about going to jail and what it could do. But then you also have to worry about what it would do to the baby, too,\\" she says. \\"I do think it will deter people from wanting to come in to seek help.\\"      It's a concern that worries many in the medical community — that the punitive approach, even with its treatment option, will drive away women or encourage more abortions.

Mother of two has since been fired. She and her husband have released rambling YouTube video in which she says that the spirit of the lord had spoken to her.","output":"Title: Dianne Reidy Comes Forward With a Divine Message After Debt Ceiling Vote Introduction: In the aftermath of the contentious debt ceiling vote in the House of Representatives last October, an unlikely figure gained national attention as Dianne Reidy, mother of two, publicly proclaimed a message she says was divinely placed upon her heart. Paragraph 1: Dianne Reidy, previously a quiet and unassuming presence in the House of Representatives, suddenly found herself in the spotlight when she began passionately voicing her beliefs about God's message and the Constitution immediately after the debt ceiling vote. This outburst, which initially surprised and confused onlookers, has had considerable ramifications for Reidy, who has since been fired from her position in the House. Paragraph 2: The events did not end with Reidy's firing, however, as she and her husband later released a lengthy and seemingly disjointed video on YouTube explaining the motivations behind her actions. In this video, Reidy claims that the \\"spirit of the Lord\\" had spoken to her, urging her to communicate her divinely inspired message to the public. Paragraph 3: While some may attempt to discredit Reidy's claims as the irrational ranting of a disgruntled employee, the undeniable intensity and conviction with which she delivered her message has sparked considerable debate and conversations about the role of faith in modern politics. Many people have found themselves questioning whether Reidy's actions were divinely inspired or simply the manifestation of personal beliefs and biases. Conclusion: Dianne Reidy's proclamation in the House of Representatives has created a stir in the political world, prompting discussions about the appropriate expression and influence of religion in politics. While opinions vary on whether Reidy's actions were the voice of divine intervention or a personal commentary on the state of American politics, the incident has undeniably shaken the status quo and inspired reflection on the role of faith in contemporary society."},{"instruction":"Please answer the following question: What is the answer for the question: What is the last name of the person who married Montagu's daughter by his first marriage? from the following article ?  Hugh Hare (1606–1667) had inherited a large amount of money from his great-uncle Sir Nicholas Hare, Master of the Rolls. On the death of his father, his mother had remarried Henry Montagu, 1st Earl of Manchester, allowing the young Hugh Hare to rise rapidly in Court and social circles. He married Montagu's daughter by his first marriage and purchased the manor of Tottenham, including the Lordship House, in 1625, and was ennobled as Baron Coleraine shortly thereafter.As he was closely associated with the court of Charles I, Hare's fortunes went into decline during the English Civil War. His castle at Longford and his house in Totteridge were seized by Parliamentary forces, and returned upon the Restoration in a severe state of disrepair. Records of Tottenham from the period are now lost, and the ownership and condition of the Lordship House during the Commonwealth of England are unknown. Hugh Hare died at his home in Totteridge in 1667, having choked to death on a bone eating turkey while laughing and drinking, and was succeeded by his son Henry Hare, 2nd Baron Coleraine.

Answer by taking a quote from the following article: Tiaina Baul Seau Jr. (; SAY-ow; January 19, 1969 - May 2, 2012), better known as Junior Seau, was a linebacker in the National Football League (NFL). Known for his passionate play, he was a 10-time All-Pro, 12-time Pro Bowl selection, and named to the NFL 1990s All-Decade Team. After three years as a Trojan, Seau entered the NFL draft after his junior season and was chosen in the first round of the 1990 NFL Draft by Bobby Beathard's San Diego Chargers as the fifth overall draft selection. Seau quickly became one of the most popular players on the Chargers, receiving the nickname \\"Tasmanian Devil\\", after the wild antics of the cartoon character. He became the face of the Chargers franchise and a San Diego sports icon.  Seau started 15 of the 16 games he played in during his rookie season, and was named an alternate to the 1991 Pro Bowl after recording 85 tackles. In 1991, he picked up 129 tackles and seven sacks and was named to the 1992 Pro Bowl, the first of 12 consecutive Pro Bowls for Seau. He was also voted NFL's Defensive MVP by the Newspaper Enterprise Association AFC Defensive Player of the Year by United Press International, as well as the NFL Alumni Linebacker of the Year and the NFLPA AFC Linebacker of the Year.  He started no fewer than 13 games for the Chargers over each of the ensuing 11 seasons, registering a career high with 155 tackles in 1994. That year, Seau was named NFL Defensive Player of the Year by United Press International, and he led his team to a championship appearance in Super Bowl XXIX. In one of the greatest games in his career, he recorded 16 tackles in the 1994 AFC Championship Game while playing with a pinched nerve in his neck in a 17-13 victory over the Pittsburgh Steelers. In 2002, his final year with the Chargers, he logged a then-career low 83 tackles and missed his final Pro Bowl with an ankle injury.

Have you ever created something super awesome that you want to share with the world? Well, you can protect your invention by getting a special permission called a patent. Also, you may have a chance to be on a show! Let's talk about how you can do this. 1. Protect Your Invention with a Patent A patent is like a magical shield that keeps your invention safe from people who might want to use it without asking you. When you get a patent, you become the boss of your invention – you decide who can use it and how. Here's how you can do that: - First, make sure you or your parents are legal residents or citizens of the U.S. This is like being part of a big family called the United States. - Next, if you're not yet 18 years old, ask your mom, dad, or another big person who takes care of you (like a guardian) to help you fill out the application. - Be ready for the patent people to take a look at your invention. They need to make sure it's really special, new, and that it works properly. 2. Get Ready for the Show Now that your invention is protected, you might have a chance to be on a show! This is a place where lots of people watch you talk about your invention, and you get to show how cool and important it is. But remember: being on a show comes with some rules you need to follow. Don't worry, I will explain them to you: - You should have a clean criminal record, which means you've never done anything naughty or against the rules set by grown-ups in a serious way. - You might need to make sure you can follow other legal requirements – these are like rules that the people in charge of the show have made up to make sure everyone behaves nicely and does things the right way. If you follow all these steps and meet the rules, you (and your invention) might have a great chance to shine on a show! So, get your creative juices flowing, invent something magical, protect it, and who knows?

Which 2006 British-American mockumentary comedy film was Bad Grandpa a reminiscent? Answer:","output":"The 2006 British-American mockumentary comedy film that \\"Bad Grandpa\\" is reminiscent of is \\"Borat: Cultural Learnings of America for Make Benefit Glorious Nation of Kazakhstan.\\" Directed by Larry Charles and starring Sacha Baron Cohen as the titular character, Borat Sagdiyev, the film employs a similar format to \\"Bad Grandpa\\" where the lead character ventures on a cross-country journey in the United States, interacting with real-life, unsuspecting individuals along the way. \\"Borat\\" presents a satirical take on American culture through the eyes of a fictitious Kazakhstani journalist who travels to the United States to document the American way of life. As a result, Sacha Baron Cohen, as Borat, often engages in outrageous and provocative behavior designed to elicit genuine reactions from the people he encounters. Released to much controversy and acclaim, \\"Borat\\" demonstrated how comedy could serve as a tool for exposing cultural biases, prejudices, and ignorance. Similarly, the 2013 American hidden camera comedy film \\"Bad Grandpa,\\" directed by Jeff Tremaine and featuring Johnny Knoxville as the main character, Irving Zisman, exhibits a parallel approach to filmmaking as seen in \\"Borat.\\" In \\"Bad Grandpa,\\" Irving, a trash-talking, irresponsible, and vulgar 86-year-old man, goes on a road trip across America with his 8-year-old grandson, Billy, played by Jackson Nicoll. Much like \\"Borat,\\" the journey is filled with shocking, crude, and hilarious encounters with unsuspecting people, as well as carefully planned stunts and pranks. This method of filmmaking is designed to capture real reactions from ordinary citizens, creating humor from their unscripted interactions with the main characters. In both \\"Borat\\" and \\"Bad Grandpa,\\" the hidden camera and mockumentary storytelling techniques, coupled with the outrageous and absurd antics of the characters, serve as a commentary on the nature of social norms and contemporary cultural values. By utilizing these styles, the filmmakers push boundaries and challenge prevailing notions of what is acceptable in humor and entertainment. As a result, \\"Bad Grandpa\\" can be seen as a direct descendent of the path forged by \\"Borat,\\" continuing in the same comedic vein to provide laughter and social commentary to its audience."},{"instruction":"User will you give you a task with some instruction.

Information:  - The pope (from \\"pappas\\", a child's word for \\"father\\") is the Bishop of Rome and, therefore, the leader of the worldwide Catholic Church. The primacy of the Roman bishop is largely derived from his role as the traditional successor to Saint Peter, to whom Jesus is supposed to have given the keys of Heaven and the powers of \\"binding and loosing\\", naming him as the \\"rock\\" upon which the church would be built. The current pope is Francis, who was elected on 13 March 2013, succeeding Benedict XVI.  - For the Archdiocese in California , USA , please see Roman Catholic Archdiocese of San Francisco The Roman Catholic Diocese of San Francisco ( Latin : Dioecesis Franciscopolitanus ) is in Argentina and is a suffragan of the Archdiocese of Córdoba .  - A cathedral (French: \\"cathédrale\\" from Latin: \\"cathedra\\", \\"seat\\" from the Greek \\"kathédra\\" (), seat, bench, from \\"kata\\" \\"down\\" + \\"hedra\\" seat, base, chair) is a Christian church which contains the seat of a bishop, thus serving as the central church of a diocese, conference, or episcopate. The counterpart term for such a church in German is \\"Dom\\" from Latin \\"domus ecclesiae\\" or \\"domus episcopalis\\"; also Italian Duomo, Dutch \\"Domkerk\\" and cognates in many other European languages. Churches with the function of \\"cathedral\\" are usually specific to those Christian denominations with an episcopal hierarchy, such as the Roman Catholic, Anglican, Orthodox, and some Lutheran and Methodist churches. Church buildings embodying the functions of a cathedral first appear in Italy, Gaul, Spain and North Africa in the 4th century, but cathedrals did not become universal within the Western Catholic Church until the 12th century, by which time they had developed architectural forms, institutional structures and legal identities distinct from parish churches, monastic churches and episcopal residences.  - The word diocese is derived from the Greek term \\"\\" meaning \\"administration\\". When now used in an ecclesiastical sense, it refers to a territorial unit of administration. In the Western Church, the district is under the supervision of a bishop (who may have assistant bishops to help him or her) and is divided into parishes under the care of priests; but in the Eastern Church, the word denotes the area under the jurisdiction of a patriarch and the bishops under his jurisdiction administer parishes. This structure of church governance is known as episcopal polity.  - The Roman Catholic Archdiocese of San Francisco (Latin: \\"Archdioecesis Sancti Francisci\\"; Spanish: \\"Archidiócesis de San Francisco\\") is an ecclesiastical territory or diocese of the Catholic Church in the northern California region of the United States. It covers the City and County of San Francisco and the Counties of Marin and San Mateo. The Archdiocese of San Francisco was canonically erected on July 29, 1853, by Pope Pius IX and its cathedral is the Cathedral of Saint Mary of the Assumption.  - California is the most populous state in the United States and the third most extensive by area. Located on the western (Pacific Ocean) coast of the U.S., California is bordered by the other U.S. states of Oregon, Nevada, and Arizona and shares an international border with the Mexican state of Baja California. The state capital is Sacramento. Los Angeles is California's most populous city, and the country's second largest after New York City. The state also has the nation's most populous county, Los Angeles County, and its largest county by area, San Bernardino County.  - The Catholic Church, also known as the Roman Catholic Church, is the largest Christian church, with more than 1.27 billion members worldwide. As one of the oldest religious institutions in the world, it has played a prominent role in the history of Western civilisation. Headed by the Bishop of Rome, known as the pope, its doctrines are summarised in the Nicene Creed. The Catholic Church is notable within Western Christianity for its sacred tradition and seven sacraments.    What entity does 'roman catholic diocese of san francisco' has the relation 'instance of' with? The answer to this question is:","output":"The Roman Catholic Diocese of San Francisco has the relation 'instance of' with the entity \\"diocese.\\" A diocese is a territorial unit of administration in the Catholic Church, under the supervision of a bishop.

In fact, the biggest complaint that my husband and two children have about me is that I’m “always busy.” Seventeen years ago, when my oldest son was about a year old, he woke up in a very fussy mood. Instead of being his usual cheerful and compliant self, he just wanted to be cuddled. A mother’s dream, right? Well, not for me. There was too much to be done; I didn’t have time to hold him. I was well aware that in addition to some projects I was working on, there was laundry to be washed and ironed, breakfast dishes to do, a house that needed cleaning. My usual response would have been to try to coax my son into cheerfulness, or to put him back to bed to sleep it off. But it was clear that he was unwell, so against my usual inclination, I decided that I would just hold him. The chores could wait another day. So I settled into the recliner chair in the lounge room and held my son while he slept. I dozed occasionally too, waking up now and then to enjoy the feeling of snuggling my baby and looking at the world beyond the window. It was a cold day, but clear and sunny. The trees rustled in the gentle breeze, and birds and butterflies flitted about the garden. Inside, my son and I stayed snuggled together under a blanket for most of the day. He slept while I, for one of the few times in my life, just drank in the beauty of the world and the happiness of sharing this time with my son. Better mothers than I am must have done similar things many, many times with their children. But for me, this very small decision, this day of ‘laziness’, became a treasured memory.

Federal agency takes heat for rebutting claim The National Institute on Drug Abuse released a statement this week taking issue at a claim made in an ad by the Marijuana Policy Project that stated that pot is \\"les toxic\\" than alcohol. Marijuana supporters are wondering what have the people at the The National Institute on Drug Abuse been smoking. NIDA released a statement refuting a claim in a recent ad produced by the Marijuana Policy Project that described pot as being “less toxic” than alcohol. \\"Claiming that marijuana is less toxic than alcohol cannot be substantiated since each possess their own unique set of risks and consequences for a given individual,\\" the agency, which is part of the National Institute of Health, wrote. RELATED: CHRIS CHRISTIE TO ALLOW MEDICAL MARIJUANA FOR KIDS Not surprisingly, the Marijuana Policy Project quickly fired back, calling NIDA’s statement “preposterous.” “The U.S. Centers for Disease Control reports no marijuana-use-only deaths each year and there has never been a marijuana overdose death in history,” Mason Tvert, director of communications for the Marijuana Policy Project, told the Daily News in an email. “It reports tens of thousands of people die from alcohol use alone each year and hundreds die from acute overdose.” The dust up was taken up by PolitiFact, who tried to shed light on whether pot was indeed less toxic than booze. RELATED: HEMPFEST: THOUSANDS ATTEND THREE-DAY POT FESTIVAL Citing statistics compiled by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, the group noted that there were 41,682 deaths attributed to alcohol in 2010, while marijuana was not listed as the cause of death in a single case. Still, toxicity is itself not limited to whether it causes death, and PolitiFact spoke with Dr. Richard Gable, who conducted an eight-year study on recreational drug use, whose results would also seem to side with the Marijuana Policy Project’s claims. \\"No drug is good for teenagers,\\" Gable said, \\"but when it comes to the chances of immediate death by chemical toxicity, marijuana is about a hundred times less toxic than alcohol or cocaine.\\" While numerous experts told PolitiFact that marijuana should not be regarded as a benign drug devoid of health risks, the journalistic fact-checker ultimately ruled that the claim that pot is “less toxic” than alcohol was “mostly true.” “What’s funny is that PolitiFact felt the need to fisk our claim and not the one made by a federal agency,” Tvert said.

The NAACP argued that although schools were not legally segregated, the city of Detroit and its surrounding counties had enacted policies to maintain racial segregation in public schools. The NAACP also suggested a direct relationship between unfair housing practices and educational segregation, which followed segregated neighborhoods. The District Court held all levels of government accountable for the segregation in its ruling. The Sixth Circuit Court affirmed some of the decision, holding that it was the state's responsibility to integrate across the segregated metropolitan area.

Now, we want to find what 't' is by itself. Right now, 6 is multiplied by 't', so to undo that, we're going to divide both sides of the equation by 6.

Question: U.S. President Donald Trump on Friday blasted former FBI director James Comey as an \\"untruthful slime ball,\\" and said it was his \\"great honor\\" to fire him.  Trump's barrage of insults comes as Comey engages in a publicity campaign for his book, \\"A Higher Loyalty: Truth, Lies, and Leadership,\\" which is set to be released next week.  The memoir promises a deep look at Comey's fraught relationship with the U.S. president who fired him, and whom Comey has accused of interfering in the independence of the FBI. On Twitter, Trump said Comey should be prosecuted. Trump's comments are in line with an online campaign, organized by his supporters, to discredit Comey.  The Republican National Committee on Thursday launched a new website, Lyin'Comey.com, which features quotes from prominent Democrats who have criticized the former FBI director in the past. The GOP plans to fact-check Comey's book and use the website for \\"rapid response\\" to highlight any \\"misstatements\\" or \\"contradictions,\\" Fox News reports. Comey's book blasts Trump as unethical and \\"untethered to truth'' and calls his leadership of the country \\"ego driven and about personal loyalty.'' The book also contains several personal jabs at Trump, including references to what Comey says are the \\"bright white half-moons\\" under Trump's eyes, which he surmises were the result of Trump using tanning goggles.  Comey also casts Trump as a Mafia boss-like figure who sought to blur the line between law enforcement and politics, and tried to pressure him regarding his investigation into Russian election interference, according to multiple early reviews of the book.  Trump fired Comey in May 2017, setting off a storm of charges from Democrats that the president sought to hinder an investigation into whether his campaign colluded with Russians.

I’m sitting at the airport on a Sunday morning waiting for my flight to Las Vegas for the now-annual pilgrimage to the NamesCon conference. A few years ago, Vegas was one of my “bucket list” places – one of those iconic cities that one should visit at least once in their life. For me, once was enough. This is now my 4th (I think?) trip to Vegas, and while the city has a lot to offer, it’s just not my cup of tea. For one thing, I’m not a gambler, like at all. I don’t have anything against it, I just don’t enjoy it. It either feels pointless or stressful to me. The city itself makes me a little sad – in some cases, it reeks of desperation. Last time I was there, my cab driver entertained me with stories of how she was working 3 jobs to save up enough to join some mega-massive bingo game. She won a small jackpot a few years back and that allowed her to work only one job for a few months. She was hoping to win again so she could cut back to 1 or 2 jobs. I wondered how many people do similar things – gambling their money away, in big or small chunks, in the hopes of that big score and in the process, putting themselves in a not-great financial situation. I suppose as long it makes them happy, then it’s all OK, but I can’t help but think someone like my cab driver might be happier overall if she only worked 1 job instead of 3, instead of working extra jobs to save up money to gamble her way to financial freedom. But that’s for her to decide, not me.  The juxtaposition of extreme and in-your-face wealth and the homeless people on the Strip also makes me sad. It’s difficult to see people begging for food and sleeping on the street while all around you, millions of dollars are poured into creating a massive playground with every type of indulgence possible.

President Francois Hollande expelled him from ruling Socialist Party. France's most wealthy hit by 75% tax rate since Hollande came to power. Article:","output":"Title: Ex-Budget Minister Jerome Cahuzac's Secret Financial Scandal Revealed by Estranged Wife Introduction: Ex-Budget Minister Jerome Cahuzac has been accused of hiding a secret nest egg in a British bank account to avoid tax, according to allegations from his estranged wife. Cahuzac, 61, was forced to leave the French cabinet last year amid claims he also concealed money in Singapore and Switzerland. President Francois Hollande expelled Cahuzac from the ruling Socialist Party as a result. Step 1: Discuss Cahuzac's alleged secret nest egg Jerome Cahuzac, the former French Budget Minister, is in the spotlight once again as his estranged wife claims he stashed money away in a secret British bank account with the purpose of evading taxes. This accusation comes after Cahuzac's previous forced resignation from the French cabinet and expulsion from the ruling Socialist Party due to allegations of hiding money in Singapore and Switzerland. Step 2: Detail Cahuzac's exit from the French cabinet In light of the mounting claims and evidence against Cahuzac, he was forced to leave the French cabinet last year. French President Francois Hollande took decisive action in removing Cahuzac from the ruling Socialist Party amid this financial scandal. Hollande's administration had been working to tackle tax evasion and improve the financial situation for the nation. Step 3: Discuss Hollande's 75% tax rate on the wealthy Since coming to power, President Hollande has introduced a 75% tax rate on the wealthiest citizens in France. This move aims to redistribute wealth and ensure that the rich pay their fair share of the tax burden. With the revelation of Cahuzac's alleged financial misconduct, the 75% tax rate is likely to be scrutinized further, especially considering Cahuzac's former position as Budget Minister. Conclusion: The allegations against ex-Budget Minister Jerome Cahuzac have once again raised questions about the integrity and transparency of government officials. As investigations continue into Cahuzac's financial dealings and possible tax evasion, the French government faces a challenging task of restoring public trust and enforcing strict policies against - and within - its highest ranks."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

This shortcoming limits the book's usefulness as a tool for understanding and analyzing children's art. Additionally, the reviewer notes that the information presented in the book does not offer significant therapeutic value.

Build a movie plot around this: What does Evan destroy to remove tempation to time travel? his journals and videos Answer:","output":"Title: Erased Equilibrium Genre: Sci-Fi Drama / Time Travel Plot: Act I: In the year 2075, Evan Roberts, a brilliant scientist, has developed a groundbreaking method of time-travel using quantum technology. With this discovery, he is able to relive the past to explore various historical events and interact with different timelines. However, Evan has remained secretive about his invention, fearing that his time-travel method would fall into the wrong hands resulting in sinister consequences. As Evan continues to experiment, he starts documenting his experiences in journals and video logs. Through these, Evan shares the joy and excitement of his time-traveling adventures; the captivating people he meets, the breathtaking beauty of nature, and the extraordinary breakthroughs he discovers. His notes are a treasure trove of knowledge, providing crucial insight into past events, which could potentially change the course of history. Act II: As Evan’s obsession with time-traveling grows, so do his responsibilities towards his family and work. Though struggling, Evan holds onto these two realities - his passion for time-travel and his commitment to his loved ones. However, Evan soon realizes that his frequent time-traveling is creating consequences in his present timeline; his relationships start to deteriorate, his career stagnates, and his physical health declines. During one of his time-traveling expeditions, Evan encounters a mysterious figure, Lisa (a time-traveler from another timeline), who warns Evan about the perils of time-travel and its potential consequences. The more Evan meddles with the past, the more likely he will create a butterfly effect, leading to an unstable present and an unpredictable future. Act III: Evan tries to ignore Lisa's warnings, believing that the knowledge he acquires from the past is worth risking everything. However, he gradually realizes the impact his actions have when he discovers that his continuous time-traveling has led to the unraveling of his personal life - his wife leaving him, his daughter falling into depression and his once-thriving career in jeopardy. Driven by guilt, Evan finally understands that his time-traveling has become an all-consuming temptation that must be eliminated, not only for himself but for the people he loves. In a climactic and emotional decision, Evan decides to destroy all his research, journals, and videos documenting his time-travel experiments. By doing so, Evan aims to remove the temptation to time-travel to focus on rebuilding his life and his relationships. Epilogue: Years pass, and Evan has successfully rebuilt his life, reconnected with his family, and reestablished his career. Though the temptation to explore the past still lingers, he stays committed to living in the present, embracing the unpredictability of life, and cherishing the moments with his loved ones. One day, as Evan walks through a park, he unexpectedly comes across Lisa, the mysterious time-traveler from his past. She smiles and nods approvingly at the choices he has made and vanishes into thin air. Evan, realizing that his actions may have saved multiple timelines from potential chaos, takes a deep breath and walks away, finally at peace with himself and his place in the world."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

A thunderstorm begins to appear, when Nancy, speeding down the road, runs over a log, plummeting the car into a steep ravine. Terry awakes to find her and her friends alive, but sheltered in an old mansion in the middle of nowhere, owned by the Penroses, Marion and her mother, and their groundskeeper/doctor friend, Norman. Gloria is the only one with serious injuries, so Marion suggests that they spend the night until Gloria is able to leave with them. Terry and Nancy are then invited to dinner, with Marion and her old, crippled mother. Mrs. Penrose then goes off on a tirade on how men are the worst things on earth, especially her ex-husband who cheated on her, and ruins dinner for everyone.

Write highlights for this article: Against a backdrop of a tumbling Big Ben and Houses of Parliament, a grinning ISIS commander has been taunting Britain with his plans to launch an attack on the West. Abu Omar al-Shishani, one of the most feared military commanders of the Islamic State of Syria and Iraq, has issued the image as part of a campaign to intimidate Britain. It features two bearded fighters with their hands shading their eyes, looking at London as it burns in a ball of computer generated flames. The warning comes as the ISIS executioner known as 'Jihadi John' warned Barack Obama: 'The Islamic State will soon, like your puppet David Cameron said, begin to slaughter your people in your streets.' Threat: Abu Omar al-Shishani's image features militants (top left) with their hands shading their eyes as they watch London burn in a ball of computer generated flames. Al-Shishani also appears grinning in the image. Militant: Al-Shishani is considered one of the most influential military leaders of the Syrian opposition forces and has been referred to as 'the military commander' suggesting he is in overall command of the ISIS armies. International: Abu Omar al-Shishani heads up one of the largest groups of foreign fighters in Syria and is known to count British recruits among his band which has had both Facebook and Twitter pages in English. ISIS followers are known to have planned attacks in Britain and Europe, although the degree to which they are directed by the high command has been unclear. The language used in the latest video, which shows the head of US aid worker Peter Kassig, suggests they are planning attacks outside their borders. The new imagery, posted on the internet by Chechen fighters serving with ISIS and entitled “Omar Shishani in London,” reinforces the idea that the group now has global ambitions similar to al-Qaeda. Al-Shishani, a red-bearded ethnic Chechen, is pictured grinning in the bottom right of the image. He heads up one of the largest groups of foreign fighters in Syria and is known to count British recruits among his band which has had both Facebook and Twitter pages in English. Ramzan Kadyrov, the Russian-backed hardline leader of the Chechen Republic, announced that Shishani had been killed by posting a picture on Instagram last Thursday, although the death remains unconfirmed and he gave no location. Shishani is considered one of the most influential military leaders of the Syrian opposition forces and has been referred to as 'the military commander' suggesting he is in overall command of the ISIS armies. He is believed to have recruited Abdul Waheed Majeed, 41, a British father of three from Crawley, West Sussex, who died when he drove a dumper truck packed full of explosives into Aleppo Prison in a suicide attack in February. His other followers included Ibrahim al-Mazwagi, from North London, who was 21 when he was killed in Syria in February last year. A graduate from Hertfordshire University, he was of Libyan origin, and had fought in that conflict in 2011 before moving on to Syria where he told his family he was doing charity work. Recruit: Al-Shishani is believed to have recruited Abdul Waheed Majeed (pictured left and right) a father of three from Crawley, West Sussex, who died when he truck packed full of explosives into Aleppo Prison. Suicide bomber: The video shows Abdul Waheed Majeed driving at high speed towards Aleppo Prison. Explosion: Seconds later the truck's explosives detonate, killing Abdul Waheed Majeed. Abu Omar al-Shishani is a nom de-guerre which refers to his Chechen origins. His real name is Tarkhan Batirashvili, 28, and he is a former sergeant in the Georgian Army. He was born to an Orthodox Christian father and Muslim mother and brought up in the Pankisi Gorge, an ethnically Chechen area of North East Georgia, where he worked as a shepherd before joining the army when he left school. He fought in the brief conflict between Russia and Georgia in 2008 and became a jihadist after being discharged from the Georgian military on health grounds after contracting tuberculosis. After recuperating and being refused reenlistment, he was arrested for stockpiling weapons and jailed in September 2010. Following his release, he travelled to Istanbul in Turkey in March 2012, to join Chechen rebels in the Syrian conflict. He became the commander of a group of hardened Chechen fighters known as Katibat al-Muhajireen [Emigrants Brigade] which was initially aligned with al-Qaeda's Jabhat al-Nusra. The group merged with other jihadists in March 2013 to form Jaish al-Muhajireen wal-Ansar [Army of Emigrants and Supporters], a larger and more structured group with a religious council. Terror: Abu Omar al-Shishani's warning comes after Jihadi John (pictured) warned Barack Obama: 'The Islamic State will soon, like your puppet David Cameron said, begin to slaughter your people in your streets' Sick: Abu Omar al-Shishani's image is not the first time ISIS has taunted the West by threatening to attack a landmark. A chilling threat was posted on Twitter on June 20 purportedly from someone with a connection to the extremist group. The images were taken outside the White House and Chicago's Old Republic Building. In May 2013, Shishani switched to supporting the Islamic State of Iraq and Syria and was named commander of the northern sector of Syria, around Aleppo. Units under his command have participated in major assaults on Syrian military bases in and around Aleppo, including the capture of Menagh Airbase in August 2013. Raffaello Pantucci, of the Royal United Services Institute think tank, said: 'Omar al-Shishani is the most prominent of the Caucasian fighters alongside ISIS and is seen as the leader of the foreign fighter brigades. 'He has a long history of conflict which has given him a prominent role amongst the ISIS foreign fighter brigades. 'We have seen how Brits and other Europeans have often been marshalled under his wing and the result is that he is elevated to be a figure of great significance in the mythology around the group and what it is doing, in particular in the imagery and videos they release. 'While his skills and abilities have been called into question by others, he has undeniably become the most prominent of the so-called Chechen fighters in Syria.' Highlights:","output":"- ISIS commander Abu Omar al-Shishani taunts Britain with plans to launch an attack on the West. - Al-Shishani is one of the most feared military commanders of ISIS and leads a large group of foreign fighters, including British recruits. - The warning is reinforced by images posted on the internet, showing London burning in computer-generated flames and Chechen fighters in London. - Al-Shishani has been referred to as the military commander, suggesting he is in overall command of the ISIS armies. - The language used in the latest video suggests ISIS is indeed planning attacks outside of their borders"},{"instruction":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

If there is no answer, please output \\"Insufficient information to provide an answer.\\". Movie title: Schindler's List Context: The relocation of Polish Jews from surrounding areas to Krakow begins in late 1939, shortly after the outbreak of World War II, when the German Army defeats the Polish Army in three weeks. Oskar Schindler (Liam Neeson), a successful businessman, arrives from Czechoslovakia in hopes of using the abundant cheap labour force of Jews to manufacture enamelware for the German military. Schindler, an opportunistic member of the Nazi party, lavishes bribes upon the army and SS officials in charge of procurement. Sponsored by the military, Schindler acquires a factory for the production of army mess kits and cooking paraphernalia. Not knowing much about how to properly run such an enterprise, he gains a contact in Itzhak Stern (Ben Kingsley), a functionary in the local Judenrat (Jewish Council) who has contacts with the now-underground Jewish business community in the ghetto. They loan him the money for the factory in return for a small share of products produced (for trade on the black market). Opening the factory, Schindler pleases the Nazis and enjoys his new-found wealth and status as \\"Herr Direktor,\\" while Stern handles all administration. Stern suggests Schindler hire Jews instead of Poles because they cost less (the Jews themselves get nothing; the wages are paid to the Reich). Workers in Schindler's factory are allowed outside the ghetto, and Stern falsifies documents to ensure that as many people as possible are deemed \\"essential\\" by the Nazi bureaucracy, which saves them from being transported to concentration camps, or even being killed.Amon Göth (Ralph Fiennes) arrives in Krakow to initiate construction of a labor camp nearby, Paszów.

Article: Most artists have a favorite material they like to work with.For 28-year-old Kristen Alice, it happens to be garbage.The eco-friendly designer uses her incredible talent to transform garbage like empty drink bottles and candy wrappers into charming dresses that sell for thousands of dollars. Kristen says the idea came to her after she saw how much vaster she and her three college roommates generated on a daily basis.The Fine Arts student began to dream about transforming the deserted bags and packages into beautiful garments. Her first dress' made from plastic bags and rolled magazines was strange, fun and even charming.However, she only made it to test her creativity. The young designer did not consider starting a commercial venture until she spent a week working at Couture Fashion Week in New York City.There she observed the excitement generated by new and vintage looks and decided to see if her unusual idea would result in as much enthusiasm.She began by creating a line of 12 garbage-inspired dresses.They were a huge success. Today her company that has offices in Palm Beach, Florida and New York City, produces a wide variety of dresses ranging from cocktail dresses to ball gowns  .Kristen, of course, doesn't search garbage cans for her material anymore.Instead, she seeks it from companies that have produced more than they need and are planning to throw away the extras. However, if you think the garbage-inspired dresses come cheap, think again.The price for ready-made creations retails from 500 to 1,500.Though that may appear expensive, the designer says she has no shortage of customers.In fact she now even has garbage-inspired clothing for men that includes jackets, ties, trousers and even board shorts! While most of the clothes are strong enough to resist multiple wears, whether they can be cleaned is a little unclear: Question: Kristen decided to start a commercial venture because  _  . - she just wanted to test her creativity. - she was inspired by the enthusiasm caused by new and vintage dresses. - she was driven by the huge profits brought by new fashion. - she found there were no unique-looking but affordable clothes in New York.

Here is a news article: LOS ANGELES (AP) — Tenure and other job protections for California's public school teachers were ruled unconstitutional Tuesday by a judge presiding in a lawsuit brought by nine students.      Los Angeles County Superior Court Judge Rolf Treu cited the historic case of Brown v. Board of Education in ruling that all students are entitled to equal education and said the current situation discriminates against minority and low-income students in placing ineffective teachers in their schools.      \\"Plaintiffs claim that the challenged statutes result in grossly ineffective teachers obtaining and retaining permanent employment, and that these teachers are disproportionately situated in schools serving predominantly low-income and minority students,\\" the decision said.      The judge said the plaintiffs' equal-protection claims validly stated that the statutes violated their fundamental rights to equality of education.      \\"This court finds that plaintiffs have met their burden of proof on all issues presented,\\" he wrote. At another point in the decision, he wrote that \\"there is also no dispute that there are a significant number of grossly ineffective teachers currently active in California classrooms.\\"      The ruling could have national implications because other states tackling the issue are also paying close attention to how the ruling plays out in the nation's most populous state.      \\"It's powerful,\\" said Theodore Boutrous Jr., the plaintiffs' attorney who presented the case in court. \\"It's a landmark decision that can change the face of education in California and nationally.\\"      Courts around the country will look at their own statutes to see how they can be changed, he said. \\"This is going to be a huge template for what's wrong with education. It will impact the national education referendum going on right now,\\" Boutrous said.      Treu said evidence at the trial showed the specific effects of ineffective teachers on students. \\"The evidence is compelling,\\" he said. \\"Indeed, it shocks the conscience.\\"      Based on massive study, an expert testified that a single year with a grossly ineffective teacher costs a classroom full of students 1.4 million in lifetime earnings, Treu wrote.      The judge stayed implementation of the ruling pending appeals. The case only involves K-12 teachers.      The California Attorney General's office said it was evaluating its legal options.      \\"We are reviewing the tentative ruling and consulting with our clients,\\" said Nick Pacilio, a spokesman for Attorney General Kamala Harris. He could not immediately say if the state would appeal.      The California Teachers Association called the decision \\"deeply flawed\\" and vowed an appeal. \\"Circumventing the legislative process to strip teachers of their professional rights hurts our students and our schools,\\" the association said in a statement.      One issue at the center of the lawsuit was whether bad teachers should be so heavily protected by tenure laws that they are almost impossible to fire. The lawsuit asked the courts to strike down several laws providing teachers with tenure, seniority-based job protection and other benefits.      Los Angeles Unified School District Superintendent John Deasy testified during the trial that it can take over two years on average to fire an incompetent tenured teacher and sometimes as long as 10. The cost of doing so, he said, can run anywhere from 250,000 to 450,000.      Treu heard two months of testimony for and against the lawsuit filed by students who claim that they are being deprived of a good education. The plaintiffs said that the state's teacher tenure system, which allows only two years for evaluation before a teacher is hired permanently, does not provide sufficient time to weigh a teacher's effectiveness.      The judge wrote that he was mindful of current intense political debate over education issues. He said, however, he could not allow politics to influence his ruling.      \\"That this court's decision will and should result in political discourse is beyond question, but such consequence cannot and does not detract from its obligation to consider only the evidence and law in making its decision,\\" the ruling said.      The judge said it is not the function of the court to dictate or advise the Legislature on how to replace the challenged statutes.      All he could do is rule on the constitutionality and \\"trust the Legislature to fulfill its mandated duty to enact legislation on the issues ... that passes constitutional muster, thus providing each child in this state with a basically equal opportunity to achieve a quality education,\\" Treu wrote.      The trial represented the latest battle in a nationwide movement to abolish or toughen the standards for granting teachers permanent employment protection and seniority-based preferences during layoffs. Dozens of states have moved in recent years to get rid of or raise the standards for obtaining such protections.      Lawyers for teachers object to changes that they say will allow the firing of teachers on a whim. They argue the current system preserves academic freedom and helps attract talented teachers to a profession that doesn't pay well.      The lawsuit, Vergara v. California, was brought by Beatriz Vergara and eight other students who said they were saddled with teachers who let classrooms get out of control, came to school unprepared and in some cases told them they'd never make anything of themselves.      The lawsuit was backed by wealthy Silicon Valley entrepreneur David Welch's nonprofit group Students Matter, which assembled a high-profile legal team including Boutrous, who represented President George W. Bush before the U.S. Supreme Court in the 2000 recount of Florida presidential ballots. Welch, who made a fortune in corporate acquisitions, says he founded Students Matter because of a passion for public education, adding both he and his three children have attended public schools.      James Finberg, who represents the teachers, agreed that Treu's decision could be a bellwether for other states. With 325,000 teachers and 6 million students, California has one of the largest educational networks in the country. ||||| In a controversial ruling that could have an immediate impact on job security for teachers in California, a judge decided Tuesday that teacher tenure laws are unconstitutional.

Teacher Tenure Laws in California Ruled Unconstitutional      A judge ruled Tuesday that California's public school teacher tenure laws are unconstitutional, after hearing testimony from students who argued the job protections made it virtually impossible to dismiss low-performing teachers. Cheryl Hurd reports. (Published Tuesday, June 10, 2014)      Vergara v. California had pitted the state and its largest teacher unions against a group of students who asked the judge to consider laws regarding teacher tenure, dismissal and seniority consideration for layoffs. A Silicon Valley-based group called Students Matter brought the lawsuit on behalf of nine students, contending the targeted laws hinder the removal of ineffective teachers and disproportionately hurt low-income and minority students.      In his ruling Tuesday, Los Angeles County Superior Court Judge Rolf Treu cited the Supreme Court's landmark equal protection ruling in Brown v. Board of Education, saying that all students are entitled to equal education. The current laws create a situation in which minority and low-income students are discriminated against when ineffective teachers are placed in their schools, he found.      Union President: Ruling Will \\"Destabilize\\" Schools      A judge issues a tentative ruling, pending appeals, Tuesday regarding California's set of teacher job protection laws. John Cadiz Klemack reports for the NBC4 News at Noon on Tuesday June 10, 2014. (Published Tuesday, June 10, 2014)      In the 16-page ruling, Treu said California laws on the hiring and firing of teachers have resulted in \\"a significant number of grossly ineffective teachers currently active in California classrooms.\\" He called the evidence in support of the plaintiffs' claims \\"compelling\\" and agreed that a disproportionate share of underperforming teachers are in schools that have mostly minority and low-income students.      Class Action: Judge Rules Teacher Tenure Laws \\"Unconstitutional\\"      A judge ruled Tuesday that California's public school teacher tenure laws are unconstitutional, after hearing testimony from students who argued the job protections made it virtually impossible to dismiss low-performing teachers. Jessica Aguirre and Jodi Hernandez report. (Published Tuesday, June 10, 2014)      The ruling affects K-12 teachers in public schools.      The judge wrote in his decision that it's not the court's job to determine how the state should change its laws. The court's role involved applying constitutional principles of law to the statutes and trusting \\"the Legislature to fulfill its mandated duty to enact legislation that... passes Constitutional muster.\\"      Weird News Photos: Cat Shot with Arrow      Lawyers for the teachers argued that changes to the job protection laws would allow teachers to be fired on a whim. Tenure laws, they argued, preserve academic freedom and help attract talented teachers to a profession that does not pay well.      \\"What this is going to do is destabilize schools,\\" said United Teachers-LA president-elect Alex Caputo-Pearl. \\"Seniority, due process and right to a hearing protects investment.      Top News Photos of the Week      \\"It protects the district's investment because the district has trained the teacher. It protects the teachers' investment so that they can teach a curriculum that they've developed over the years. It protects the students' investment because students are involved in programs that depend on teachers.\\"      State Superintendent of Public Instruction Tom Torlakson released the following statement on the ruling:      “All children deserve great teachers. Attracting, training, and nurturing talented and dedicated educators are among the most important tasks facing every school district, tasks that require the right mix of tools, resources, and expertise. Today’s ruling may inadvertently make this critical work even more challenging than it already is.      “While I have no direct jurisdiction over the statutes challenged in this case, I am always ready to assist the Legislature and Governor in their work to provide high-quality teachers for all of our students. Teachers are not the problem in our schools, they are the solution,” Torlakson said.      In a phone interview, Jennifer Thomas, who represents 1,700 teachers in San Jose, California, called it a \\"dark day.\\"      \\"Nobody is offering a solution for when teachers are unfairly fired,\\" she said. \\"Great teachers need to be protected from arbitrary decisions by administrators. I don't hear anybody planning to address this very real problem.\\"      California Teacher Association spokesman Mike Mylinski called the ruling \\"unnecessary and misguided.\\" He would have preferred a stricter discipline process for teachers.      But the plaintiffs argued that the laws make it difficult to remove ineffective teachers. The trial included testimony from Los Angeles Unified School District Superintendent John Deasy, who said the process of removing an ineffective tenured teacher can take more two years on average. He estimated the cost of doing so at about 250,000 to 450,000.      \\"We believe very strongly that we will prevail on appeal,\\" attorney Glen Rothner said.      Deasy applauded Tuesday's \\"historic\\" ruling.      \\"Every day that these laws remain in effect is an opportunity denied,\\" Deasy said. \\"It's unacceptable, and a violation of our education system's sacred pact with the public.\\"      Students who said they were not afforded a good education because of the laws also testified. Julia Macias of Southern California said in a telephone news conference on Tuesday that she was \\"glad I did not stay quiet,\\" because \\"great teachers make all the difference.\\" Kate Elliott of San Carlos, another plaintiff, said she joined the suit because of a bad eighth grade teacher who had students color and watch YouTube videos and who \\"didn't really care about our education.\\"      The students were backed by Atherton entrepreneur David Welch, who partnered with Griffin Schein, a consulting company that builds campaigns around social causes.      The decision could have wide-ranging impact on the way California hires and fires teachers. It also could lead to changes in dozens of states with strong tenure laws that have been targeted by opponents of such policies.

As a small Scandinavian company based in Sweden, Polar could not afford to set up operations worldwide and were only ABBA's record company in the Scandinavian countries. Therefore, ABBA's recordings were licensed to different record companies in each country, but usually to companies that had international operations, meaning they could effectively compete with each other to acquire the licenses in more countries if they proved successful in their own. The licenses gave the companies a few allowances to issue certain tracks as singles that Polar had not, or to modify single (and occasionally album) artwork. The licenses were for three years at a time, meaning that between 1989 and 1992, they had all expired.

Write a title for this article: CNN has learned that Navy SEAL Charles Keating IV participated in a major clash in Syria in March for which he posthumously received the nation's third-highest award for combat valor. CNN has also obtained new details about the fatal May 3 firefight in which Keating lost his life. Keating, tasked to fill a \\"train, advise and assist\\" role, was killed in Iraq while helping to rescue a small team of U.S. military advisers and Kurdish forces from an attack mounted by more than 100 ISIS fighters. A decorated combat veteran and star athlete who decided to enlist after the 9/11 attacks, Keating was part of a Navy SEAL operation in northern Iraq called Task Force Trident working with Kurdish Peshmerga fighters combatting ISIS. According to one account of the May clash in Iraq provided to CNN, a group of Navy SEALs and local Peshmerga forces were attacked by a large unit of ISIS fighters that had overwhelmed the Kurdish front line by rushing in with bulldozers, trucks and weapons. A group of nearly 20 SEALs including Keating was deployed to respond to the ISIS attack. During the ongoing battle, the SEALs ran low on ammunition and Keating's machine gun malfunctioned, according to initial battlefield reports. Keating went back to a nearby coalition vehicle to get a new weapon and additional ammunition. Keating, now armed with a sniper rifle, climbed on top of a building and began firing on the ISIS fighters. It was at this point that Keating was struck by enemy fire. Two other SEALs carried him down from the roof and he was placed in a medevac helicopter, but the battle was so intense that the helicopter was also hit before managing to take him to a hospital where he was declared dead. At the time, coalition spokesman Col. Steve Warren told reporters that that the two-hour clash between ISIS and the Peshmerga forces the advisers were assisting was \\"a big fight, one of the largest we've seen recently.\\" But a previously unrevealed battle on March 4 equally dire and dangerous, involving pitched combat against about 100 ISIS fighters. The details of this earlier fight were revealed in the little-noticed Silver Star citation presented to Keating's family after his death on May 3. According to the citation, Keating \\"continuously exposed himself to enemy automatic weapon, mortar, and rocket grenade fire.\\" Keating kept moving on the battlefield between the front line and the flanks talking to the Peshmerga, encouraging them to keep going. In the March battle, more than 100 ISIS operatives assaulted Peshmerga lines and Keating, serving as an advisor then as in May, moved in to help repel the attack. As ISIS fighters sent a car bomb towards him, Keating led a team to counterattack with sniper and rocket fire. \\"His personal bravery inspired his comrades to vigorously defend their position and repel the enemy assault,\\" according to the citation. The Pentagon has never acknowledged the first Syrian battle. U.S. military officials say they are under no obligation to reveal the details of battles U.S. troops are involved in even if it's against a large enemy force, and they will not routinely report if a U.S. service member is wounded -- only when one is killed. The revelation of two pitched battles in the space of eight weeks between Navy SEALs and two groups each of 100 ISIS fighters underscores that Special Operations Forces being deployed to train, advise and assist local forces are in real danger of being attacked. In April President Barack Obama announced the deployment of 250 additional Special Operation Forces to Syria and described their role in a somewhat different way. While making the announcement in Hannover, Germany, Obama said, \\"They're not going to be leading the fight on the ground, but they will be essential in providing the training and assisting local forces.\\" Title:","output":"\\"Valor and Sacrifice: Uncovering Navy SEAL Charles Keating IV's Heroic Battles Against ISIS in Syria and Iraq\\""},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

U.N. officials on Tuesday put the number of rapes and other sexual attacks in eastern Congo since late July at more than 500, more than double the previous estimate. In remarks prepared for delivery to the Security Council after returning from a fact-finding trip to the region, U.N. Assistant Secretary-General for Peacekeeping Atul Khare cited 267 rapes or other sexual attacks in the town of Uvira -- on the eastern edge of the country -- and other nearby regions of North and South Kivu, in addition to the 242 rapes that had already been reported in and near the village of Luvungi. Among the additional cases was a report of 10 women raped by members of the Armed Forces of the Democratic Republic of Congo on August 17 and 18 in the community of Katalukulu, in Fizi territory, South Kivu, he said. On August 17, at least 40 rapes were committed in the village of Mubi by an alleged coalition of Democratic Forces for the Liberation of Rwanda and Mayi-Mayi, a militia group active in the region, he said. Another 13 rapes occurred in Pinga area in Chuho market, he said. On August 26, Khare received reports of 74 cases of sexual violence -- including 21 directed at girls 7 to 15 years of age -- and six men in the village of Miki in the territory of Mwenga, he said. The incidents occurred in July and August, he said. Five days later, he said, 130 cases of rape were recorded in several villages in the territory of Shabunda. There were reports that in one village, \\"all women might have been systematically raped,\\" he said. Khare had gone to Congo to find out why peacekeepers said they hadn't learned about the rapes near Luvungi sooner. The United Nations reported last week that some 242 people were raped by armed Congolese and Rwandan rebels in villages in North Kivu province between July 30 and August 3. Attackers blocked roads and prevented villagers from reaching outside communications. Many homes were also looted and burned. Many of the victims were gang-raped by as many as six men at a time, according to the United Nations Organization Stabilization Mission in the Democratic Republic of the Congo. The rapes were first publicly reported on August 22. The United Nations initially said it did not learn about the attacks until August 12, when it was alerted by International Medical Corps. That group said it first told the United Nations about the rapes on August 6. But on Tuesday, the United Nations acknowledged that it first learned of a report of rape on July 30, nearly two weeks earlier than it had previously said. \\"We can confirm that the Daily Field Security Report from North Kivu on 30 July included the following: 'Today 30 July 2010 during morning hours, the locality of Mpofi (52 Km E of Walikale) passed under control of FDLR [Democratic Forces for the Liberation of Rwanda] combatants. One woman was reportedly raped and locals fled towards Walikale and Kibua. More information to be ascertained.' \\"We can also confirm that, on the basis of this information, an e-mail was sent by the Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs transmitting information of the FDLR movement,\\" it said. The July 30 internal U.N. email was relayed to relief agencies working in the area and warned that the rebels had taken over the villages, and had already committed one instance of rape. U.N. officials have said they will toughen efforts to stop rapes in the region. \\"The women of eastern DRC deserve better,\\" said Margot Wallstrom, a U.N. special representative for sexual violence in conflict who sent a senior member of her staff with Khare on his fact-finding mission to the region. \\"For them, there is no safe place. They are raped when harvesting crops; when going to market; when fetching water and firewood; when carrying their babies; when in their homes at night, among their loved ones.\\" She added that the rape is becoming a weapon of choice in eastern DRC. \\"The sad reality is that incidents of rape have become so commonplace that they do not trigger our most urgent interventions,\\" she said. Noting that the information about the rapes \\"was slow to surface,\\" she called for the United Nations to focus on how to improve its response to such reports. \\"We should examine the U.N.'s response, including that of our peacekeepers on the ground, not in a spirit of self-recrimination but with a determination and resolve to do better to protect civilians in what is undoubtedly one of the most complex, vast and volatile conflict zones in the world.\\" She noted that some rebel leaders have been identified as having been present during the attacks and called for them to be used \\"as a starting point\\" to bring the attackers to justice. \\"Our policies of 'zero tolerance' cannot be backed by a reality of 'zero consequences,'\\" she said. Summarize the highlights of this article.","output":"In a place called eastern Congo, there have been many bad things happening to women and girls. U.N. officials, who are people that help make sure everyone is safe and treated fairly, found out that more than 500 women and girls were hurt and attacked in a very mean way called rape. They are trying to find out why this has happened and how to protect these women and girls better. Even though there are peacekeepers in Congo to help keep people safe, they didn't know about these attacks right away. They want to make sure they can respond faster and better to keep everyone safe.

Japanese fans certainly had reason to go wild on Tuesday night. Their side won their opening game, beating Colombia 2-1, and securing the team's first victory against a South American side.      But after the team swept Colombia off the pitch, Japanese fans also did their share of sweeping: meticulously cleaning up their rows and seats in the stadium.

It is something that comes as a surprise to many foreigners attending matches in Japan.      \\"They might leave a bottle or some kind of food package on the ground and then it's often the case that people get tapped on the shoulder by Japanese people indicating they should clean up or take it home but can't leave it there,\\" Mr McIntyre says.

If anything, they're proud.      \\"In addition to their heightened consciousness of the need to be clean and to recycle, cleaning up at events like the World Cup is a way Japanese fans demonstrate pride in their way of life and share it with the rest of us,\\" explains Prof North.      \\"What better place to make a statement about the need to care responsibly for the planet than the World Cup?\\" he adds.      It doesn't mean that there is any more or less passion, insists Mr McIntyre. It's simply that passion doesn't slip into neglect of basic rules of behaviour let alone violence.      \\"I know it may sound bland and boring, but this is the reality of a country that's built on respect and politeness,\\" he laughs. \\"And this simply extends to doing respectful things in football.\\"      \\"I think it's a wonderful thing that the World Cup brings so many nations and people together and get to learn and exchange these kinds of things.

Economy McDonalds Tells Workers To Budget By Getting A Second Job And Turning Off Their Heat CREDIT:      McDonalds has partnered with Visa to launch a website to help its low-wage workers making an average 8.25 an hour to budget. But while the site is clearly meant to illustrate that McDonalds workers should be able to live on their meager wages, it actually underscores exactly how hard it is for a low-paid fast food worker to get by.      The site includes a sample “budget journal” for McDonalds’ employees that offers a laughably inaccurate view of what it’s like to budget on a minimum wage job. Not only does the budget leave a spot open for “second job,” it also gives wholly unreasonable estimates for employees’ costs: 20 a month for health care, 0 for heating, and 600 a month for rent. It does not include any budgeted money for food or clothing.      Basically every facet of this budget is unachievable. For an uninsured person to independently buy health care, he or she must shell out on average 215 a month — just for an individual plan. While some full-time McDonald’s workers do qualify for the company’s 14 a week health plan, that offer caps coverage at 10,000 a year and is often insufficient. If that person wants to eat, “moderate” spending will run them 32 a week for themselves, and 867 a month to feed a family of four. And if a fast food worker is living in a city? Well, New York City rents just reached an average of 3,000 a month.      The sample budget is also available in Spanish. On another section of the site, it concludes, “You can have almost anything you want as long as you plan ahead and save for it.”      Neither McDonalds nor Visa returned requests for comment by the time of publication.      Last year, Bloomberg News found that it would take the average McDonalds employee one million hours of work to earn as much money as the company’s CEO. This immense wage disparity in the fast food industry has sparked a series of protests and walk-outs by low-wage workers working at fast food chains around the country — in New York, Chicago, Washington, and Seattle, to name a few cities, workers from chains including KFC, McDonalds, Burger King, and Taco Bell have spoken publicly about the need for serious wage increases across the industry.      (HT: Low Pay Is Not Okay) ||||| Starting in 1996, Alexa Internet has been donating their crawl data to the Internet Archive. Flowing in every day, these data are added to the Wayback Machine after an embargo period. ||||| Someone meant really well. We think. A few years ago, Visa and McDonald’s partnered to launch a personal finance site for McDonald’s employees to help them better manage their money. Unfortunately, whoever wrote these materials had no grasp of what it’s actually like to live on 8 or so per hour.      “Helping you succeed financially is one of the many ways McDonald’s is creating a satisfying and rewarding work environment,” the site’s About page explains. The path to financial freedom, according to Visa and McDonald’s, involves turning off your heat, not buying groceries, not having children, never getting sick, and getting a second job. All of which are sound money-saving strategies, it’s true, but it’s not all that realistic to expect people to combine them.      You can download their handy budget workbook yourself. First, in the “income” column, you, the Hypothetical McDonald’s Employee, have two jobs. One job pays 1,105 per month, and the other pays 955 per month. This amount is what someone would earn working roughly 60 hours a week at 8.50 an hour. If you earn less per hour than that or this is after taxes, then you’re either working more hours or have a higher hourly wage. The budget doesn’t specify whether this is gross income or after taxes: even for someone in a low enough tax bracket that they pay no federal or state income taxes, Social Security and Medicare still takes 6.2% out of every check.      Anyway, Visa and McDonald’s produced a handy workbook for employees to learn how to budget their money, spend sensibly, and save for the future and for emergencies.      UPDATE: McDonald’s and Visa have apparently listened to [some of] the Internet’s criticisms, and changed the budget to include heat. They sneakily replaced the PDF workbook on the server with the new version, but we downloaded the original and have had it on the server for you all this time. The version on their site now allows 50, so that’s nice of them. Here’s the revised budget:      Savings: 100      No quibble with this. Everyone should be putting some money in a savings account (or shoebox, whatever, but a savings account is a better idea.)      Mortgage/Rent: 600      This is a realistic figure in most of the country if you share a home with family or roommates, but not so much if you live by yourself or don’t yet have good enough credit to get a fixed-rate mortgage on a modest condo.      Car Payment: 150      Not a bad figure, but that’s probably an older car, so hope you have money put away for repairs.      Car/Home Insurance: 100      That sounds pretty reasonable, though again, a person working to rebuild their credit might not get a great rate on carinsurance.      Hey, wait a second, there isn’t any more mention of a car on this budget. How are you supposed to repair and maintain this vehicle? Even changing your own oil and having a friend do major repairs in their front lawn costs money for parts.      That might not be a problem, though, because there’s also no budget line for gasoline. Guess you’ll be making a car payment while you walk to work.      Health Insurance: 20      I don’t know what planet has health insurance plans that cost 20/month, but can I move there? Even a lot of civil service and union workers pay more than that now. Plus, insurance is nice and all, but there are these things called “co-payments” that also cost money. The cheaper your health insurance is, the higher those payments will be. Also, I miss those heady days when I was so young and healthy that I never had to buy cold medicine, bandages, painkillers, or cough syrup. Which was never.      Heating: 0      This is the case for a large portion of the year, and people in some parts of the country never turn on their heat. The rest of the time, maybe you’ll have to bring leftover hamburger buns home and burn them for warmth.      Cable/Phone: 100      No, heat, no groceries, but a phone and basic cable. Or a smartphone with a large data plan. Or cable, home Internet access, and no mobile phone. Hmm.      Electric: 90      Maybe in the spring and fall, but good luck with that when you start running air conditioners and baseboard heat.      Other: 100      Is this where the gas goes?      Spending Money: 800      Okay! Straight into savings with you, then!      Except, wait…this is a terrible budget. Besides leaving out gas, heat, car maintenance, and remotely realistic medical expenses, it leaves out clothes, entertainment, furniture, various kinds of personal hygiene, furniture, charitable and religious giving, cleaning supplies, and groceries. GROCERIES.      It also completely ignores that you might have children, which is convenient, because it’s hard to fit child care for those 60 hours a week that you’re working into this budget. Assuming that you can even get that many hours from your job: maybe it’s time to start looking for a third one.      Like we said, whoever produced this workbook probably meant well. It has helpful and slightly condescending money-saving tips, like:      When possible, use public transportation or carpool      Consider walking or riding a bike when running errands      Plan meals in advance      Borrow books and movies from the library      Shop with a list      Pay down debt as quickly as possible      Try not to use an ATM outside of your bank’s system to avoid extra service charges      We would probably just roll our eyes and move on, if it weren’t for this tiny thing on the McDonald’s Practical Money Skills page.

Summarize: Six months on from the UK referendum, the process of leaving the EU is enveloped by a cloud of unknowing. The uncertainty does not relate to Britain's eventual departure, rather to how it will be achieved and at what cost. Since June almost every comment from key cabinet ministers and leaders in Europe has been faithfully reported and dissected but, for all the words spoken, there is little clarity. Indeed - certainly in the foreign ministries and the halls of Brussels - there is scarcely-concealed irritation with the blandness of government statements about doing the best for Britain or favouring a \\"smooth and orderly process\\". And, as I witnessed in Italy, the Foreign Secretary Boris Johnson did not get the best reviews when he cited the UK's consumption of 300 million bottles of Prosecco as evidence of an enduring trading relationship. What the government would like, would be to stay in the EU's single market while reducing the numbers of EU migrants. That is not possible, says a chorus of EU leaders, despite their own misgivings about immigration, insisting there will be no compromise over freedom of movement. The Danish Finance Minister Kristian Jensen was the latest politician to warn \\"there's no such thing as a free lunch. Not even for a country like Britain... So, if the EU is to stay open to Britain, then Britain has to follow the same rules as other countries, like Norway.\\" And that, of course, would mean accepting the politically impossible: freedom of movement. And rulings of the European Court of Justice. So it is presumed the UK will leave the single market. But powerful voices are pushing back, warning of the economic damage that leaving the single market would do. As the year draws to a close, all the signs point to a messy divorce. When negotiations start in April, after Article 50 has been triggered, there is one underlying reality: Europe's leaders will not allow the UK to get a better deal than it would have got by staying in the EU. Most of those heads of government are quick to deny they want to punish Britain but, on the other hand, they believe the UK must be seen to hurt. Voters in the Netherlands and France must not be tempted to try the exit path. Francois Hollande, shortly to fade from the political scene, speaks for many when he says the Brexit deal must \\"serve as an example for those who seek the end of Europe\\". Privately many senior European officials concede they are facing an existential threat: that anti-establishment parties threaten the future of the Union. However unlikely, a victory for Marine Le Pen in France would set France on the road to its own EU referendum. If there were to be a Leave vote it is hard to imagine the EU surviving without France. So, when the UK/EU negotiations start, the instincts in Europe's capitals will be, first and foremost, to protect the Union. Brussels insists that the divorce must come first. It will not talk about trade until the terms of withdrawal have been agreed. And those early talks will include highly controversial issues like how much Britain must pay to exit, to settle its accounts, and to cover obligations like staff pensions. In Brussels they put the total figure at 50bn euros (Â£42bn) or higher. The expectation in Brussels is that the terms of the divorce will be agreed by March 2019 but not much else. Once the initial deal is concluded, the chief negotiator on the EU side, Michel Barnier, favours moving to a transitional period while the terms of the trade agreement are worked out. Everyone, it seems, has a transition timetable. Some believe a five-year period may be necessary. The UK chancellor and the Bank of England have spoken of a transition lasting two to three years to provide clarity for the business and financial community. A trade deal took the Canadians seven years and it still has not been ratified although, unlike Canada, the UK already trades under EU laws and regulations. Even if it makes sense, a transition period will pose some awkward political questions. Would the UK still have to contribute to the EU budget or continue to accept the primacy of EU law? And how about freedom of movement? Theresa May could find herself going into an election in 2020 with divorce papers signed but much of what the public most dislikes about the EU still in place. It is also doubtful whether a transition period would deliver the reassurance that is claimed for it. Banks and financial companies want a continuation of what they call \\"passporting\\" - the right to sell their services anywhere in the EU. But there are signs that some companies will not put up with years of uncertainty. One of Japan's banks has already said it will expand operations in Amsterdam. Other international banks have warned that they will reduce their footprint in London and open posts in the EU within six months if there is no further clarity. Lloyd's of London, the insurance market, has said it will move part of its operation to the EU. All kinds of ideas have been floated - that the UK could pay in order for certain sectors to continue to have access to the single market - but that carries political risks for the government. There are some positive signs of international companies continuing to invest in Britain, but what the government fears is a steady drip of departures that could only encourage others to follow. Unfolding in the New Year will be a game of strategy and a game of power. Sometime, probably in February, the government will declare what it seeks from the negotiations without revealing its negotiating strategy. Thousands of businesses and financial companies will be watching and asking whether the plan provides a convincing road map for the years ahead and, above all, whether it protects their commercial interests.","output":"Six months after the UK referendum, uncertainty about Brexit remains, specifically how it will be achieved and at what cost.

Summarize: France's deficit will \\"without a doubt\\" be 3.7% of its output this year, he said, above the 3% he promised to cut it to during the election last year. The 3% deficit target is also one set by the European Union - but most of the major euro nations are in breach. The news comes as France's economic progress  was criticised by a European Central Bank board member. \\"The reform course in France seems to have floundered,\\" Germany's Jens Weidmann said. \\"The crisis that we are facing is a crisis of confidence, and this confidence cannot be gained if we postpone the tackling of the root causes of the crisis,\\" Mr Weidmann said, referring to France, Italy and Cyprus as countries that still face tough financial situations. Greece, Ireland and Portugal have been effectively shut out of borrowing long term on international financial markets, which forced them to seek help from European partners and the International Monetary Fund. They all adopted austerity policies to cut public spending, but France has bucked the trend, raising taxes instead to protect its social model. During the election last year, Mr Hollande vowed to bring the deficit to 3% from its current 4.5% and had insisted this was possible until now admitting defeat. But he defended his record, saying that the deficit has come down from more than 5% in 2011. \\"In two years, we have performed a structural recovery,\\" the president said on Tuesday, that \\"is as unprecedented as it is significant\\". \\"Addressing our accounts is a financial obligation... but it is also an obligation of sovereignty because France must never be in difficulty in the markets.\\" The ECB's other German board member, Joerg Asmussen, last month urged France to take \\"concrete and measurable\\" steps to bring down its budget deficit. The number of jobless in France has now risen past 3 million. Summary:","output":"France's deficit is expected to be 3.7% of its output this year, above the 3% target set during last year's election and by the European Union. Most major euro nations are in breach of this target. France's economic progress has been criticized by the European Central Bank, with Germany's Jens Weidmann pointing out that France, Italy, and Cyprus still face challenging financial situations. France has chosen to raise taxes instead of cutting public spending, and President Hollande defended the country's record by stating the deficit has decreased from over 5% in 2011. However, the number of jobless in France has risen past 3 million."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant that follows instruction extremely well. Help as much as you can.

This article offers a comprehensive guide on the appropriate protective gear to wear and safety practices to adopt while operating machinery and power tools. By adhering to these safety precautions, you can minimize the risk of accidents and ensure a safe and productive working environment. The Importance of Protective Gear 1. Protective gloves One of the primary risks when operating machinery or power tools is cutting or slicing your hands. This unfortunate incident can lead to severe injuries, infections, and even long-lasting physical disabilities. To reduce the risk of hand injuries, it is crucial to wear protective gloves specifically designed for the task at hand. Protective gloves can be made of different materials such as leather, Kevlar, or heavy-duty rubber, offering varying levels of protection against cuts, punctures, and abrasion. 2. Safety earmuffs When operating power tools or machinery, one of the most overlooked safety concerns is the impact of noise on the user's hearing. Prolonged exposure to high noise levels during operation can cause temporary or permanent hearing loss. To protect your ears from loud noise generated by power tools, it is advisable to wear safety earmuffs. These hearing protectors help reduce the exposure to hazardous noise levels, ensuring that your hearing remains intact throughout the years. 3. Safety goggles Eye protection is another essential safety measure to adopt when working with machinery and power tools. Dust, debris, and flying particles can easily enter the eyes, causing irritation and, in some cases, even blindness. To protect your vision, it is essential to wear safety goggles or glasses while operating any equipment. Choosing the right eyewear safety gear that meets the appropriate safety standards and provides a comfortable fit will ensure optimum eye protection. 4. Choosing proper attire The clothing you wear while working with machinery and power tools should be carefully selected to minimize the risk of accidents. Loose-fitting clothing, for instance, can easily get caught in the moving parts of machinery, leading to serious injuries. Hence, it is crucial to wear fitting clothes that do not have parts that may get entangled with the tool you are operating. Moreover, wearing open-toed shoes poses a risk of injuries from dropping heavy objects, stepping on sharp items, or accidental slips. To protect your feet, it is wise to choose closed-toe shoes, preferably ones with slip-resistant soles and reinforced toe caps. 5. Securing long hair People with long hair should take extra precautions when working with machinery and power tools. Long hair can easily get caught in the moving parts of equipment, causing severe scalp and head injuries. To prevent such accidents, always tie up your hair using a hairband, bun, or ponytail so that it remains away from the moving parts of the machinery. Conclusion Investing your time and effort in adhering to safety precautions will significantly increase your protection while working with machinery and power tools. By using protective gloves, safety earmuffs, safety goggles, choosing appropriate clothing, and securing long hair, you can mitigate potential hazards and minimize the risks of accidents, ultimately promoting a safer working environment. Remember that safety should always be the primary priority whenever you embark on any project involving machinery and power tools."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant that follows instruction extremely well.

You will be given a task. You must generate a detailed and long answer. Cholesterol can't dissolve in the blood. It has to be transported to and from the cells by carriers called lipoproteins. Low-density lipoprotein, or LDL, is known as \\"bad\\" cholesterol. High-density lipoprotein (HDL) is known as good cholesterol. When too much LDL cholesterol circulates in the blood, it can slowly build up in the inner walls of the arteries that feed the heart and brain. Together with other substances, it can form plaque, and lead to atherosclerosis. If a clot forms and blocks a narrowed artery, a heart attack or stroke can result. Cholesterol comes from the food you eat as well as being made by the body. To lower bad cholesterol, a diet low in saturated fat and dietary cholesterol should be followed. Regular aerobic exercise also lowers LDL cholesterol and increases HDL cholesterol.  John is a doctor with the local hospital. Earlier today, he was seeing two patients, patient A and patient B. John found out that patient A had more LDL, but patient B had more HDL. He now needs to determine correct treatment for them.  Which patient would see less build up in the inner walls of the arteries, patient A or patient B? Answer:","output":"Patient B would see less build-up in the inner walls of the arteries, due to having a higher level of high-density lipoprotein (HDL) cholesterol, which is known as the \\"good\\" cholesterol. HDL cholesterol helps in removing excess LDL cholesterol, or the \\"bad\\" cholesterol, from the bloodstream, thus reducing the risk of plaque formation and atherosclerosis, as well as heart attack and stroke. On the other hand, Patient A, with more LDL cholesterol, is at a higher risk of plaque formation in the inner walls of their arteries, increasing their chances of developing atherosclerosis and associated complications. As a doctor, John should consider creating individualized treatment plans for both patients, accounting for their specific cholesterol levels and potential risk factors. For Patient A, John might recommend strategies to lower their LDL cholesterol levels, including diet modifications, such as reducing saturated fat and dietary cholesterol intake, regular aerobic exercise, and potentially prescribing medications like statins, if necessary. For Patient B, while their higher HDL cholesterol levels are beneficial, it is also essential to assess any other risk factors and monitor their overall health. John should focus on encouraging them to maintain a healthy lifestyle, including a balanced diet and regular physical activity, to support their HDL cholesterol levels and decrease the potential risks associated with cardiovascular disease. It is crucial to remember that treatment plans should be based on a comprehensive evaluation of each patient and may require adjustments over time to ensure optimal health outcomes."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Director Richard Murray said owner Roland Duchatelet had \\"underestimated\\" the Championship, from which the Addicks were relegated in April. \\"It is not easy to say you have made mistakes. The important thing is we learn from those going forward,\\" Slade told BBC Radio London. Charlton appointed three different head coaches as they dropped back into League One for the first time since 2011-12, with Jose Riga resigning following the last game of the season on 7 May. Duchatelet has made six managerial changes since taking over the south-east London club in January 2014, with former Brighton, Leyton Orient and Cardiff boss Slade becoming the first British boss to be appointed by the Belgian businessman. \\"There was a willingness to put things right and move the club forward and I was quite excited by that,\\" Slade added. \\"They have made a start by appointing a British manager - somebody that knows the league and their way around. \\"The fact I know a lot of people - players and managers - will help the club.\\" Slade believes he is capable of repairing the relationship between the club and its fans, which has become increasingly strained since the turn of the year. Charlton fans staged a series of protests aimed at Duchatelet and chief executive Katrien Meire in the second half of the 2015-16 season and supporters formed a campaign group called Coalition Against Roland Duchatelet (CARD), with the ultimate aim of getting Duchatelet to sell the club. However, Slade admits that an improvement in the atmosphere at The Valley \\"is not going to happen overnight\\".

Answer:","output":"The review provided is negative in nature. There are a few key factors that indicate this evaluation has a negative connotation: 1. The reviewer desires to award the author and her book with \\"-10 stars.\\" This suggests that they were not just disappointed with the book, but that they felt it was so terrible that it merits an award lower than the lowest possible rating, which indicates a great degree of dissatisfaction. 2. The reviewer brings up the element of rhyme by stating, \\"Goodie that rhymes, could I get published too?!\\" This sarcastic remark mocks the author's apparent focus on creating rhyme in their work, as if rhyme alone would be enough to make the book good. It also hints that the reviewer believes the author's work is not genuinely worth being published because the rhyme seems to be the only significant aspect of the work. 3. The reviewer asks a rhetorical question within their statement, while also expressing a negative emotion by saying \\"as long as it rhymes.\\" This implies that the reviewer disagrees with the idea that a book should be considered valuable just because it contains rhymes. The heavy sarcasm also accentuates their negative assessment of the book's perceived shortcomings in quality and substance. While the context provided does not go into specifics about the author's book, it can be safely concluded from the review that the reviewer had an unfavorable experience with the book and does not consider it to be worth recommending.

Answer: The traditional desktop environment for running desktop applications is accessed via a tile on the Start screen.  Is the question answered in a satisfactory fashion?","output":"Answer: To open the traditional desktop environment on various computer systems, you first need to understand how each operating system handles this environment. While the method may differ depending on the operating system, the general idea is the same: accessing a user interface that allows for running and managing desktop applications. Below, we will discuss how to open the traditional desktop environment on some major platforms, such as Windows, macOS, and Linux-based systems. 1. Windows: In the case of Windows, the desktop environment is often prominently displayed to users. When you boot up your computer and log in to your user account, you are usually presented with the desktop environment by default. - For Windows 7 and earlier versions: After logging in, you will be directly shown the traditional desktop environment. It consists of a taskbar at the bottom, which includes the Start button, application shortcuts, system-tray icons, and a clock. - For Windows 8 and 8.1: Opening the traditional desktop environment might be a bit less intuitive, as these operating systems introduced the \\"Start Screen\\" with large, touch-friendly tiles. To access the desktop environment, click or tap on the \\"Desktop\\" tile from the Start screen. - For Windows 10: Microsoft reintroduced the Start menu as a combination of traditional desktop elements and the modern tiles from Windows 8. When you log in, you are automatically presented with the desktop environment, and the taskbar contains the Start button, application shortcuts, system tray icons, and a clock. 2. macOS: In macOS, the \\"Desktop\\" and the \\"Desktop Environment\\" are considered synonymous. Once your Mac has finished booting up and you have logged in, you are immediately presented with your desktop environment. The desktop environment typically includes the Menu bar at the top, the Dock at the bottom or the side containing application and folder icons, and the desktop wallpaper with any user-created files and folders saved on the desktop. If your system is set up to display multiple virtual desktops (using macOS's Spaces feature), you can switch between them using the Mission Control interface or by swiping left or right with multiple fingers on your trackpad or mouse. 3. Linux: The traditional desktop environment in Linux-based systems heavily depends on which \\"Desktop Environment\\" (such as GNOME, KDE, XFCE, etc.) and distribution (like Ubuntu, Fedora, OpenSUSE, etc.) you are using. However, accessing the main desktop environment is generally straightforward after logging in to your user account. For example, if you are using Ubuntu with the GNOME desktop environment, you will be presented with the desktop environment, including the default wallpaper, a top panel with application menus, status icons, and a clock. To access applications, you can click on the \\"Activities\\" button in the top-left corner or search for them using the search feature. In conclusion, the process of opening the traditional desktop environment differs slightly between various operating systems. Still, the core idea remains the same: presenting users with an interface for managing and launching desktop applications seamlessly."},{"instruction":"Q:You are presented with the question \\"Buried vegetation in a wetland changes to peat over what?\\" and the following answer choices:  - a long period of time  - The area was once underwater  - a brief period of time  - just a day's time  - Physical weathering  - It used to be covered by water  - movements in the earth's crust  - a quick period of time  Now knowing that being burried under soil and mud changes vegetation into peat through extreme heat and pressure in a swamp over a long period of time and wetlands Wetlands are also called swamps or marshes, choose the best answer.

Please answer the following question: Information:  - A reconnaissance aircraft is a manned or unmanned military aircraft designed, or adapted, to carry out aerial reconnaissance. Their roles are to collect imagery intelligence, signals intelligence, and measurement and signature intelligence.  - A biplane is a fixed-wing aircraft with two main wings stacked one above the other. The first powered, controlled aeroplane to fly, the Wright Flyer, used a biplane wing arrangement, as did many aircraft in the early years of aviation. While a biplane wing structure has a structural advantage over a monoplane, it produces more drag than a similar unbraced or cantilever monoplane wing. Improved structural techniques, better materials and the quest for greater speed made the biplane configuration obsolete for most purposes by the late 1930s.  - Trench warfare is a type of land warfare using occupied fighting lines consisting largely of trenches, in which troops are significantly protected from the enemy's small arms fire and are substantially sheltered from artillery. The most famous use of trench warfare is the Western Front in World War I. It has become a byword for stalemate, attrition, sieges and futility in conflict.  - In general, a civilian is \\"a person who is not a member of the military or of a police or firefighting force\\", as defined by Merriam Webster's Dictionary. From the perspective of the U.S. Department of Defense, Chapter 18 of Title 10 United States Code refers to non-military law enforcement officers as civilians since they are employees rather than enlisted personnel, and also in order to distinguish itself from military police. In military and law enforcement slang, the term \\"Civies\\" or \\"Civvies\\" are often used to refer civilian population or civilian clothing.  - A military aircraft is any fixed-wing or rotary-wing aircraft that is operated by a legal or insurrectionary armed service of any type. Military aircraft can be either combat or non-combat:  - Aviation is the practical aspect or art of aeronautics, being the design, development, production, operation and use of aircraft, especially heavier than air aircraft. The word \\"aviation\\" was coined by French writer and former naval officer Gabriel La Landelle in 1863, from the verb \\"avier\\" (synonymous flying), itself derived from the Latin word \\"avis\\" (\\"bird\\") and the suffix \\"-ation\\".  - The AEG C.V was a prototype two - seat biplane reconnaissance aircraft of World War I. Designed to utilise a more powerful engine than previous AEG C - class reconnaissance aircraft , results were disappointing enough that further development was cancelled .  - Signals intelligence (SIGINT) is intelligence-gathering by interception of signals, whether communications between people (communications intelligenceabbreviated to COMINT) or from electronic signals not directly used in communication (electronic intelligenceabbreviated to ELINT). Signals intelligence is a subset of intelligence collection management.  - A fixed-wing aircraft is an aircraft, such as an aeroplane, which is capable of flight using wings that generate lift caused by the vehicle's forward airspeed and the shape of the wings. Fixed-wing aircraft are distinct from rotary-wing aircraft, in which the wings form a rotor mounted on a spinning shaft, and ornithopters, in which the wings flap in similar manner to a bird.  - Aerial reconnaissance is reconnaissance for a military or strategic purpose that is conducted using reconnaissance aircraft. This role can fulfil a variety of requirements, including the collection of imagery intelligence, observation of enemy maneuvers and artillery spotting.  - Measurement and signature intelligence (MASINT) is a technical branch of intelligence gathering, which serves to detect, track, identify or describe the signatures (distinctive characteristics) of fixed or dynamic target sources. This often includes radar intelligence, acoustic intelligence, nuclear intelligence, and chemical and biological intelligence. MASINT is defined as scientific and technical intelligence derived from the analysis of data obtained from sensing instruments for the purpose of identifying any distinctive features associated with the source, emitter or sender, to facilitate the latters measurement and identification.  - Military personnel are members of the armed forces. Usually, personnel are divided into military branches roughly defined by certain circumstances of their deployment. Those who serve in a typical large land force are soldiers, making up an army. Those who serve in seagoing forces are seamen or sailors, and their branch is a navy or coast guard . Marines serve in a marine corps. In the 20th century, the development of powered flight aircraft prompted the development of air forces, serviced by airmen. Designated leaders of military personnel are officers. These include commissioned officers, warrant officers and non-commissioned officers (NCOs). For naval forces, non-commissioned officers are referred to as petty officers (POs). military personnel are instructed to wear dog tags  - Imagery intelligence (IMINT) is an intelligence gathering discipline which collects information via satellite and aerial photography. As a means of collecting intelligence, IMINT is a subset of intelligence collection management, which, in turn, is a subset of intelligence cycle management. IMINT is especially complemented by non-imaging MASINT electro-optical and radar sensors.  - The Wright Flyer (often retrospectively referred to as Flyer I or 1903 Flyer) was the first successful heavier-than-air powered aircraft. It was designed and built by the Wright brothers. They flew it four times on December 17, 1903, near Kill Devil Hills, about four miles south of Kitty Hawk, North Carolina, US. Today, the airplane is exhibited in the National Air and Space Museum in Washington D.C.  - World War I (WWI or WW1), also known as the First World War, or the Great War, was a global war originating in Europe that lasted from 28 July 1914 to 11 November 1918. More than 70 million military personnel, including 60 million Europeans, were mobilised in one of the largest wars in history. Over nine million combatants and seven million civilians died as a result of the war (including the victims of a number of genocides), a casualty rate exacerbated by the belligerents' technological and industrial sophistication, and the tactical stalemate caused by gruelling trench warfare. It was one of the deadliest conflicts in history, and paved the way for major political changes, including revolutions in many of the nations involved.

Explanation: When food supplies dry up, it leads to a decrease in the number of organisms in an ecosystem due to starvation and a lack of resources for survival. This causes an increase in the number of organisms that die. This indirectly impacts the first step of the process, which is the death of the organism. As there are more dead organisms, the following steps in the formation of fossils may also be affected – more decomposition, scattering of bones by scavengers, wind and rain, and potential fossilization.

In this case, both sentences convey the same information about Gus Poyet being a manager of AEK Athens and a player for Chelsea F.C. Therefore, the classification is SIMILAR. Part #2: Sentences with the same RDF relationship in terms of [subject, predicate, object] Usage: Each sentence can be broken down into [subject, predicate, object] format. For example, sentence 1: ('Gus Poyet', 'has been the manager of', 'AEK Athens FC') and ('Gus Poyet', 'has been a player for', 'Chelsea F.C.'); sentence 2: ('AEK Athens', 'are managed by', 'Gus Poyet') and ('Gus Poyet', 'played for', 'Chelsea F.C.').

Process:  - Humans are born as babies - Babies become infants - Infants become children - Children learn skills - Children become teenagers - Teenagers undergo puberty - Teenagers become adults - Adults have children - Adults become elderly - Elderly humans die.  Perturbation hypothesis: suppose more adults become elderly happens, how will it affect LESS babies.  Does the supposed perturbation have an effect (direct or indirect) on the process? The answer to this question is:","output":"Yes, the supposed perturbation has an indirect effect on the process. Step-by-step reasoning: 1. If more adults become elderly, this means that the overall life expectancy of the population is increasing. 2. With a higher life expectancy, it is likely that people are remaining healthy and able-bodied for longer periods and therefore may choose to have children later in life. 3. Delaying childbearing can contribute to a decrease in overall fertility rates, as couples may choose to have fewer children due to the later start in their family life, or they may face decreased fertility as they age. 4. Lower fertility rates and later childbearing can ultimately result in fewer babies being born. In conclusion, the perturbation of more adults becoming elderly can indirectly lead to fewer babies being born through the impact on fertility rates and people choosing to have children later in life."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Write an article that answers the following question: Which event happened first, AUMF becoming law, or the attacks on 11 September 2001?","output":"Title: AUMF and the Attacks on September 11th, 2001: The Chronology of Events Introduction Debate frequently arises on the sequence of historical events, particularly those with significant geopolitical consequences. This article aims to provide a comprehensive explanation of the chronological order of events surrounding the Authorization for Use of Military Force (AUMF) and the attacks on September 11, 2001. By examining these events that shaped modern international relations and policies, readers will receive a clear understanding of which event preceded the other. The Attacks on September 11, 2001 On the fateful morning of September 11, 2001, the United States experienced unprecedented terror attacks, as a series of four coordinated suicide strikes targeted significant landmarks across the nation. This deadly act of terrorism was orchestrated by the Islamist extremist group Al-Qaeda, under the leadership of Osama bin Laden. The attacks began with the hijacking of four passenger airlines: American Airlines Flight 11, United Airlines Flight 175, American Airlines Flight 77, and United Airlines Flight 93. At precisely 8:46 AM (EDT), American Airlines Flight 11 crashed into the North Tower of the World Trade Center in New York City. Shortly after, at 9:03 AM, United Airlines Flight 175 flew into the South Tower, creating a massive explosion upon impact. The ensuing destruction and eventual collapse of the two towers resulted in the tragic loss of nearly 3,000 lives. Simultaneously, American Airlines Flight 77 was flown into the Pentagon, causing significant damage and claiming the lives of 189 people. The last hijacked plane, United Airlines Flight 93, targeted Washington, D.C.; however, the heroic efforts of passengers on board led to the plane crashing into a field in Pennsylvania, preventing further devastation. The aftermath of the September 11 attacks had profound implications for the United States, as it marked the beginning of the War on Terror, a comprehensive response to terrorism globally. Authorization for Use of Military Force (AUMF) The Authorization for Use of Military Force (AUMF) is a joint resolution passed by the United States Congress on September 14, 2001, and signed into law by President George W. Bush on September 18, 2001. The AUMF granted the President the authority to use all necessary and appropriate force against those determined to have planned, authorized, committed, or aided the September 11th attacks on the United States, or harbored such organizations or persons. The AUMF has been the legal foundation for military actions against terrorist groups involved in the 9/11 attacks, as well as their affiliates. Notably, the AUMF has provided the authorization for the invasion of Afghanistan in 2001, resulting in the toppling of the Taliban regime and the beginning of the long-term conflict in the country.  Furthermore, the AUMF has often been cited as the legal basis for drone strikes, surveillance programs, and prolonged detention of enemy combatants in locations such as Guantanamo Bay. Critics argue that the vagueness and lack of expiration date for the AUMF have led to an overreach of executive power and a persistent state of global conflict. Conclusion In conclusion, it is evident that the attacks on September 11, 2001, occurred first, followed by the enactment of the Authorization for Use of Military Force. The attacks, which resulted in the tragic loss of thousands of lives and caused significant destruction across the United States, marked a turning point in the country's political and military landscape. The AUMF was enacted as a direct response to the attacks, granting the President the power to wage a war against terrorism and pursue justice for the victims. The post-9/11 period has been characterized by the expansion of military activities under the AUMF, leaving a lasting impact on international relations and security policies."},{"instruction":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

A judge sentences Haley to her ultimate nightmare, attending an elite gymnastics academy run by legendary coach Burt Vickerman (Jeff Bridges).Haley was once considered one of the most talented gymnasts in the US. She made it to the World Championships, but the previous year she walked out of competition in the middle of the finals, costing the American team the gold medal and leaving many people hurt and crushed making her one of the most hated people in gymnastics.After arriving at the school, Haley has a talk with Coach Vickerman, who convinces her to take up the sport once again at least until she can enter an upcoming invitational competition. Vickerman convinces her that she can use the prize money from the competition to repay some property damage debts she still owes and after that, she can leave gymnastics once and for all. Disliking the sport's rigid rules and intense training schedule, Haley is reluctant to come out of retirement. Her attitude toward her fellow gymnasts (as well as her past that she avoids talking about) causes conflicts. After getting the cold shoulder the first day at the gym, Haley realizes what she is up against.At the invitational, Haley's talent shines and her return from gymnastics retirement seems for the better. But all is not what it seems in the scoring system. She starts to remember one of the many reasons she retired: the flaws in judging.

The Cardinals compete in the National Football League as a member of the league's National Football Conference (NFC) West division. The Cardinals were founded as the Morgan Athletic Club in 1898, and are the oldest continuously run professional football team in the United States. The Cardinals play their home games at the University of Phoenix Stadium, which is located in the northwestern suburb of Glendale, Arizona.  - A linebacker (LB or backer) is a playing position in American football and Canadian football. Linebackers are members of the defensive team, and line up approximately three to five yards (4 m) behind the line of scrimmage, behind the defensive linemen, and therefore \\"back up the line.\\" Linebackers generally align themselves before the ball is snapped by standing upright in a \\"two point stance\\" (as opposed to the defensive linemen, who put one or two hands on the ground for a \\"three point stance\\" or \\"four point stance\\" before the ball is snapped).   - In American and Canadian football, a line of scrimmage is an imaginary transverse line (across the width of the football field) beyond which a team cannot cross until the next play has begun. Its location is based on the spot where the ball is placed after the end of the most recent play and following the assessment of any penalty yards.  - A university (\\"a whole\\", \\"a corporation\\") is an institution of higher (or tertiary) education and research which grants academic degrees in various subjects.  Universities typically provide undergraduate education and postgraduate education.  - Canadian football is a form of gridiron football played in Canada in which two teams of 12 players each compete for territorial control of a field of play long and wide attempting to advance a pointed prolate spheroid ball into the opposing team's scoring area (end zone).  - The National Football League (NFL) is a professional American football league consisting of 32 teams, divided equally between the National Football Conference (NFC) and the American Football Conference (AFC). The NFL is one of the four major professional sports leagues in North America, and the highest professional level of American football in the world. The NFL's 17-week regular season runs from the week after Labor Day to the week after Christmas, with each team playing 16 games and having one bye week. Following the conclusion of the regular season, six teams from each conference (four division winners and two wild card teams) advance to the playoffs, a single-elimination tournament culminating in the Super Bowl, played between the champions of the NFC and AFC.  - The Super Bowl is the annual championship game of the National Football League (NFL), the highest level of professional American football in the world. The game is the culmination to a season that begins in the late summer of the previous calendar year. Normally, Roman numerals are used to identify each game, rather than the year in which it is held. For example, Super Bowl I was played on January 15, 1967, following the 1966 regular season. The single exception to this rule is Super Bowl 50, which was played on February 7, 2016, following the 2015 regular season. The next game, Super Bowl LI, scheduled for February 5, 2017, will follow the 2016 regular season.  - Jeff Bentrim (born June 21, 1965) was an American football player who played quarterback.

The offense, the team with control of the oval-shaped football, attempts to advance down the field by running with or passing the ball, while the team without control of the ball, the defense, aims to stop their advance and take control of the ball for themselves. The offense must advance at least ten yards in four downs, or plays, or else they turn over the football to the opposing team; if they succeed, they are given a new set of four downs. Points are primarily scored by advancing the ball into the opposing team's end zone for a touchdown or kicking the ball through the opponent's goalposts for a field goal. The team with the most points at the end of a game wins.  - New Orleans (or ) is a major United States port and the largest city and metropolitan area in the state of Louisiana.

Even after the emergence of the professional National Football League (NFL), college football remained extremely popular throughout the U.S.  Although the college game has a much larger margin for talent than its pro counterpart, the sheer number of fans following major colleges provides a financial equalizer for the game, with Division I programs  the highest level  playing in huge stadiums, six of which have seating capacity exceeding 100,000. In many cases, college stadiums employ bench-style seating, as opposed to individual seats with backs and arm rests. This allows them to seat more fans in a given amount of space than the typical professional stadium, which tends to have more features and comforts for fans. (Only two stadiums owned by U.S. colleges or universities  Papa John's Cardinal Stadium at the University of Louisville and FAU Stadium at Florida Atlantic University  consist entirely of chairback seating.)  - Ronald McKinnon ( born September 20 , 1973 ) is a former American football linebacker in the National Football League .

A feast central to the Christian liturgical year, it is prepared for by the season of Advent or the Nativity Fast and initiates the season of Christmastide, which historically in the West lasts twelve days and culminates on Twelfth Night; in some traditions, Christmastide includes an Octave. The traditional Christmas narrative, the Nativity of Jesus, delineated in the New Testament says that Jesus was born in Bethlehem, in accordance with messianic prophecies; when Joseph and Mary arrived in the city, the inn had no room and so they were offered a stable where the Christ Child was soon born, with angels proclaiming this news to shepherds who then disseminated the message furthermore. Christmas Day is a public holiday in many of the world's nations, is celebrated religiously by the vast majority of Christians, as well as culturally by a number of non-Christian people, and is an integral part of the holiday season, while some Christian groups reject the celebration. In several countries, celebrating Christmas Eve on December 24 has the main focus rather than December 25, with gift-giving and sharing a traditional meal with the family.  - A touchdown is a means of scoring in both American and Canadian football.

Premise: As Cruise moves past the fornicating satyrs and satyrettes to the euphonious dronings of Jocelyn Plook's music, one feels Kubrick, at last, is in his element. Hypothesis: Kubrick is not within his element with the fornicating satyrs and euphonious droning of the chosen music.  Does the premise entail the hypothesis?","output":"The premise and the hypothesis appear to contradict each other in their assessments of whether Kubrick is in his element or not. In order to thoroughly investigate this, we need to delve deeper into the statement, the context, and the potential interpretations. Firstly, the premise sets up the scenario of Cruise's character moving through a scene filled with fornicating satyrs and satyrettes, accompanied by the music of Jocelyn Plook. This scene is described as a potential showcase for Kubrick's talents, implying that this particular combination of visuals and sounds is a fitting representation of his creative abilities and unique filmmaking style. The statement also highlights a certain level of comfort that Kubrick feels in crafting this kind of scene, where potentially controversial or provocative imagery meets equally experimental and captivating auditory inputs. On the other hand, the hypothesis counters the premise by stating that Kubrick is actually not within his element with the fornicating satyrs, suggesting that the visual design of the scene might not reflect his creative visions, interests, or strengths. This is further emphasized with the mention of the chosen music, implying that the integration of Jocelyn Plook's euphonious droning might not suit Kubrick's artistic intentions or preferences. The hypothesis insinuates that this scene fails to capture Kubrick's essence as a filmmaker and might not be the best fit for his cinematic language and interests. Analyzing both the premise and hypothesis, we observe that they present opposing views on whether Kubrick is in his element in this specific scene. The premise posits that the scene suits Kubrick's style and that he is comfortable in orchestrating it. Conversely, the hypothesis asserts that the combination of visuals and music is not aligned with Kubrick's artistic vision. In conclusion, the premise does not entail the hypothesis, as they provide contrasting perspectives on Kubrick's disposition and relationship with the scene in question. In fact, they raise a complex and fascinating discussion about the nature of artistic creativity, subjective interpretation, and the interplay between different elements in a filmmaker's work. The relationship between the premise and the hypothesis may also be influenced by individual interpretations of Kubrick's body of work and personal creative style, thus leaving room for further debate."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

This added heat may lead to the formation of more magma and molten rock, resulting in an increase in volcanic activity. As the heated magma rises through the cracks in the Earth's crust, additional pressure may be exerted on the tectonic plates, which could lead to more movement and the potential for more volcanic eruptions. This is because the increased heat can cause a reduction in the viscosity of the Earth's mantle, allowing for easier movement of molten rock beneath the Earth's surface. Increased heat can also cause the expansion of the Earth's crust. This expansion might lead to the opening of new cracks and fissures, allowing magma to rise to the surface more readily.

Based on the sentence \\"Several people are at an outdoor event near a tent.\\", is the sentence \\"People are outside.\\" a true sentence?","output":"Yes, the sentence \\"People are outside.\\" can be considered a true sentence based on the information provided in the original sentence, which states, \\"Several people are at an outdoor event near a tent.\\" In order to determine the truth of the second sentence, it is essential to analyze and break down the key components of the original sentence. 1. \\"Several people\\": This phrase indicates that more than one individual is being discussed. The term 'several' implies a small but unspecified number of people. 2. \\"Outdoor event\\": This phrase suggests that the gathering or occasion is taking place outside of an enclosed space, meaning that it is happening in an open area such as a park, garden, or plaza. The word 'outdoor' highlights the fact that the event occurs in an external environment. 3. \\"Near a tent\\": This part of the sentence provides extra information about the specific location of the event, making it clear that the people are not only outside but also in proximity to a tent. Tents are typically used for temporary shelter or as a base for various activities at outdoor gatherings. Given these key pieces of information, it can be concluded that the people being referred-to in the original sentence are indeed located outside. Consequently, the sentence \\"People are outside.\\" stands as a true statement based on the information presented in the first sentence.

Water is added to the dry mixture to bind all the components together. In a concrete mixer, add the determined amount of water and then the concrete mix. You can also mix this in a wheelbarrow with a shovel. Use as little water as possible. Water makes the concrete more maneuverable but it also weakens the constitution of the final product. A drier mix makes the concrete more crack resistant. Turn on the machine. The mix will become smooth and consistent. Shut off the machine. You can sometimes get a truck to pour concrete straight into your form; otherwise, load it into wheelbarrows and tilt them into the form until the high point is reached. While doing this, enlist some helpers to spread out the concrete with shovels, rakes and \\"come alongs,\\" which is a special concrete rake. Starting at the uphill point, use a screeding tool to flatten out the wet concrete. Screeding involves jiggling a wide plank of wood back and forth, if possible immediately over the forms, to create a flat surface. Work your way from top to bottom, gently screeding until you have a flat surface. Your concrete surface won't be finished yet, but it will begin to look more complete and professional looking at this point. At this point, you should move fairly quickly as the concrete will set fast. Your floating process will contain two steps:  Use a large floating device, also known as a bull float, to press down aggregate and help the cream (gravel-free concrete) rise to the surface. Do this by moving the bull float away from you, keeping the tailing edge slightly elevated, and then moving the bull float back towards you, keeping the leading edge slightly elevated. Use a magnesium hand float to go over the surface. After some of the water bleeds to the surface, use long sweeping motions with your hand float. Line up a plank as a straight edge to make periodic joints in the concrete. These joints will help the concrete withstand cracking due to temperature changes. Cut the joints about a quarter of the thickness of the concrete. Use a broom to sweep across the surface, creating designs. This will provide traction on the concrete so it is not as slippery when wet. A soft brush can also be used for a different texture that is less rough. For a smoother surface, but one that still has a pattern to it, you can use the trowel and slide it over the surface in a circular motion. Make sure the grooves are not so deep that water stands on the surface. Standing water will compromise the integrity of the concrete. If moving the broom over the concrete causes clumps of concrete to aggregate on your broom, it's too early to broom. Move over the concrete again with the magnesium floater to smooth out the pattern left by the broom, then try again later. Concrete should be left to cure for 28 days, with the initial day being the most critical. As soon as the concrete has been poured, professionals usually recommend sealing the concrete. The sealant will help the concrete cure, as well as prevent cracks and discoloration. Although concrete is often thought of an a no-hassle surface, it benefits from regular maintenance. Regular soap and water maintenance will help keep the concrete looking its best, while occasional seals (~ every five years) can help keep the concrete from getting damaged through use. What is a summary of what this article is about?","output":"This article is about how to mix and work with concrete. It tells us that we need to mix Portland cement, sand, and gravel with water to make concrete. Then, we can pour the concrete into a shape we want and smooth it out using special tools like a screed and a float. After that, we can add patterns or textures to the surface to make it less slippery when wet. Finally, we need to let the concrete dry and cure for 28 days, and it's a good idea to seal it to protect it from cracks and damage. Regular cleaning and sealing can help keep the concrete looking nice and strong."},{"instruction":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

A primary school teacher who hit a six-year-old pupil on the head with a ruler in class has been cleared of assault. Rina Khan, 41, was accused of hitting the child so hard that it broke - as a punishment for getting a question wrong during a Maths lesson. On Tuesday, she went on trial at Birmingham Crown Court charged with common assault and child cruelty. Prosecutors said she 'flipped' and lost her temper before lashing out and also claimed she called the boy a 'muppet'. The court heard a teaching assistant watched in horror as part of the ruler 'flew across the room' after the incident on March 20 which left the Year 2 pupil 'sad and scared'. Ms Khan wept in the dock as she told the court yesterday that she only 'tapped' the boy on the head because he was misbehaving by poking another pupil with a pencil. And after less than an hour of deliberating today, a jury agreed with her version of events and cleared of her of all charges. Recorder John Edwards told Ms Khan: 'You have been found not guilty on both counts. You are discharged and you are free to go.' Outside court, Ms Khan spoke of her relief following her ordeal which saw her suspended from her job and taking anti-depressants. She said: 'I am just very relieved that the word was not guilty. This has been going in since March. 'I was suspended and I have been ill at home since. I have been taking anti-depressants and I had become somewhat of a recluse. 'And all this just for tapping a child on the head with a ruler. 'I do feel like I have been picked on. I'm not sure what I'm going to do next.' The court heard how the teacher had warned the child twice about poking another pupil with a pencil at the school, which cannot be named for legal reasons. She admitted to striking him on the head with the ruler but said she only did so gently and the ruler may have broken because it was weak. Jurors were also told the boy 'barely reacted at all' and was not injured during the incident. Giving evidence, Ms Khan, from Smethwick in the West Midlands, said: 'I have a duty of care to all my pupils. A jury Birmingham Crown Court, pictured, agreed with Ms Khan's version of events and cleared her of common assault and child cruelty charges. 'The pencil was quite sharp. It was going to hurt the girl. She was really trying so hard to work. 'I had a ruler in my hand at that time...and simply tapped him on the head. 'The ruler broke. I was really really shocked by that. I don't think I used any force. It was just a tap. 'I did call him a muppet but I did not use that word on that day. 'I used that word with my children sometimes but as a term of affection, just like The Muppets Show with the furry, little guys.' Tom Walkling, defending, added: 'Do we want to live in a world where teachers are so afraid of being prosecuted in a criminal court that they are wary of any contact with the children in their care?

This was the scene in Zhuzhou,Hunan Province on May 17.Nine people were killed and 16 injured. Things were similar last year in the Sichuan earthquake. Thousands of people were buried in the ruins and lost their lives. What if we could have warned them? People are always _ to find a way of preventing buildings' collapse. Better materials and technology help,but they are not a solution. Just like humans,a building has its own life cycle from \\"birth\\" to \\"death\\".If we know when a building is going to collapse,we can repair it in advance or get out of it before it falls. Now,scientists at the University of Illinois have developed a material that turns red before it breaks. The invention could be used in things like climbing ropes or bridge supports. The research was led by Nancy Sottos,a professor at the university's Beckman Institute,and Douglas Davis,a graduate research assistant. The secret behind the colorchanging material is a type of molecule  .A molecule is a group of atoms held together by chemical bonds. Imagine you and your friends standing in a circle,holding hands. Each person stands for one atom,your hands represent the bonds,and the entire circle represents a molecule. If one person lets go of his or her hands,the molecule changes color. The research team put the molecule into a soft material. When the researchers stretched the material,it turned bright red for a few seconds before it broke into two pieces. When they repeatedly stretched and relaxed the material,without breaking it,it only turned a little red. The major problem is that light can get rid of the red color. When the team shone bright light on the molecule,the broken bond was fixed,and the color disappeared. If the bright light keeps the red color from appearing,the material's warning system will be useless. Scientists still have a lot of work to do before the colorchanging molecules can be used outside the lab. Options: A The colorchanging molecules are certain to be used outside the lab. B There will be no collapse with the help of the colorchanging material. C There is a long way to go before the material can be applied.

Article: The old man fished alone in a small rowboat and he had gone eighty-four days now without taking a fish. In the first forty days a boy had been with him. But after forty days without a fish the boy's patents had told him that the old man was now bad luck, and ordered the boy to join another boat, which caught three good fish the first week. It made the boy sad to see the old man come in each day with his boat empty and he always went down to help him carry in the fishing lines or take down the old, patched sail. \\"Santiago,\\" the boy said to him as they dragged up the boat to the sand. \\"I could go with you again. I've made some money.\\" the old man had taught the boy to fish and the boy loved him. \\"No,\\" the old man said. \\"You're with a lucky boat. Stay with them. You must obey your father.\\" \\"We can be lucky again too. Remember when we didn't catch a fish for 10 days, then caught a big one each day for a month?\\" said the boy. \\"Can I offer you a beer on the balcony and then we'll take the stuff home,\\" said the boy. \\"Why not?\\" the old man said. \\"Santiago,\\" the boy said as they sat on the balcony, \\"If I cannot fish with you, I would like to serve in some way.\\" \\"You bought me a beer,\\" the old man said, lifting the bottle to his mouth. \\"Do you remember the first time I took you out to fish?\\" the old man asked. \\"I was five. I remember the tail of a huge fish slapping against the boat, the noise of you clubbing him and the sweet blood smell. I remember everything from when we first went together,\\" the boy said. The old man looked at him with his sun-burned, loving eyes. \\"May I get some sardines for tomorrow? Let me get four fresh ones,\\" said the boy. \\"One,\\" the old man said. His hope and his confidence had never gone. But now they were freshening like a sea breeze. \\"Two,\\" the boy said. \\"Thank you,\\" the old man said.

They believed that the boy couldn't earn enough money with the old man and therefore, directed him to join another boat that had better fishing success. The situation was not about the risk factor associated with fishing (option A), the boy's education (option B), or the old man's teaching skills (option C). The issue was purely about the perceived luck and profitability of fishing with the old man. The parents were assured about their decision when the new boat the boy worked on caught three good fish in the very first week.

Answer by taking a quote from the following article: Kevin Patrick Shields was born on 21 May 1963 in Jamaica Hospital in Queens, New York City, United States. He is the eldest of five siblings born to Irish parents; his mother was a nurse and his father was an executive in the food industry. Shields' parents had emigrated to the United States from Ireland in the 1950s, when the couple were teenagers. Shields attended Christ the King, a Roman Catholic primary school which he described as \\"a really horrible school run by psychopathic nuns\\". In August 2007, reports emerged that My Bloody Valentine would reunite for the 2008 Coachella Valley Music and Arts Festival in Indio, California, United States; this was later confirmed by Shields, along with the announcement that the band's third studio album (which he had begun recording in 1996) was near completion. In June 2008, My Bloody Valentine played two live rehearsals at the Institute of Contemporary Arts in London, their first public performances in 16 years. They began an extensive worldwide tour in summer 2008 (their first since their 1992 tour in support of Loveless) including appearances at Oyafestivalen in Oslo, Norway, Electric Picnic in Stradbally, Ireland, and the Fuji Rock Festival in Niigata, Japan. The band reportedly spent PS200,000 on equipment for their world tour.  In October 2011, Shields launched the independent record label Pickpocket together with Le Volume Courbe frontwoman Charlotte Marionneau, and considered releasing a collaborative \\"ten minutes of noise\\" single on the imprint. In May 2012 remastered versions of Isn't Anything and Loveless were released as well as the EP's 1988-1991 collection, which featured the band's Shields-remastered Creation Records extended plays, singles and unreleased tracks.  In November, Shields announced plans to release My Bloody Valentine's third album online before the end of the year, before announcing during a warm-up show at Electric Brixton in London on 27 January 2013 that the album \\"might be out in two or three days.\\" The m b v album was eventually released through the band's official website on 2 February 2013, crashing the site on its launch due to high traffic. According to Metacritic, m b v received \\"universal acclaim\\", and the band began a worldwide tour upon its release.

Provide a detailed answer so user don’t need to search outside to understand the answer. Answer the following question: This week I shot my Interview with Claire Bridge. Myself and Riah travelled, I would say all the way out too Wheelers Hill, but it’s really not that far away, unless you live on the North side, which we both do. Riah and I carried our gear on two trains and 1 bus to get to Claire’s studio out in Wheelers Hill. I can see why Claire lives here as it’s a pretty beautiful place, it’s still suburban but there are trills, hills and birds everywhere, and for someone that’s passionate about the environment I can see why she lives here. Meeting Claire was awesome, after having spoken via phone or email for so long, it was nice to speak to her in person. The filming of the interview went extremely smoothly, I’d put this down to having planned out everything, such as all the questions I was going to ask prior to the interview. By this stage I had helped Riah film as well as Elise and it was noticeable how much smoother Riah’s interview went because she had pre-planned her questions. Rather than spending an hour asking various questions that you might not use anyway, it’s much more efficient to spend 20 minutes covering exactly what you want to cover. By this stage I’d also had practise setting up lights, doing sound and getting camera shots for people’s portraits so I already knew everything I wanted to shoot. Our setup was pretty simple, two large lights, one on Claire’s front right and one on Claire’s front left, two Canon EOS 60D DSLR’s at different positions (one straight on, one to the side), a Sony H2N handy recorder and a lapel mic. Everything ran super smoothly, we did the interview first then myself and Riah shot various things in Claire’s studio. Whilst shooting various things in Claire’s studio we also got a chance to both speak to her which was nice, discussing what it is like to be a woman in Melbourne’s art scene and finding out who some of her favourite artists were. Overall the experience was also, I have a lot of friends who are artists so I hope to do more artist portraits in the future. According to the above context, answer the following question. Riah and the author traveled to Wheelers Hill Answer:","output":"Yes, Riah and the author traveled to Wheelers Hill to conduct an interview with Claire Bridge at her studio. They used two trains and a bus to reach their destination, carrying their filming gear along the way. Wheelers Hill is described as a beautiful place with suburban characteristics, hills, and birds, which likely relates to Claire's passion for the environment."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Identify adjectives, adverbs, and expressions conveying emotions: \\"came back,\\" \\"tie,\\" \\"lost,\\" \\"at least,\\" \\"made a showing\\" 3. Assess the tone of those expressions:    - \\"came back\\" and \\"tie\\" show determination and a comeback, suggesting a positive sentiment.    - \\"lost\\" conveys a negative outcome.    - \\"Hey, at least\\" denotes an attempt at finding a positive side despite the negative outcome, implying a mixed sentiment.    - \\"made a showing\\" suggests pride and accomplishment, even though the outcome was not a complete success. 4. Determine the overall sentiment of the tweet by combining individual sentiments: The tweet is sharing the story of a sports team that, despite an initial struggle, managed to make a comeback but ultimately lost the game. However, the author is focusing on the positive aspects of their performance, indicating that they are proud of their team's effort. 5.

Given the question: Process: - The carafe is filled with water - The water is poured into the machine at the back - Coffee beans are put into a grinder - The grinder is activated - A filter is put into the coffee maker - The ground coffee is put into the filter - Sometimes a bit of salt is added to the grounds to bring out flavor - The top of the machine is closed - The power is turned on - The water passes through the grounds and becomes coffee.  Question: suppose pouring water into the carafe happens, how will it affect coffee being poured out of the machine.  How does the supposed perturbation influence the second effect mentioned. Answer by more, less or no effect The answer is:","output":"More effect. When pouring water into the carafe is the initial step of the coffee-making process, it directly impacts the subsequent stages that lead to coffee being poured out of the machine. The amount of water poured into the carafe determines the amount of coffee that will be produced, as well as potentially affecting the strength and flavor of the coffee. This can be considered a perturbation that influences the second effect mentioned, which is the coffee being poured out of the machine. When the carafe is filled with water, this water is then poured into the coffee machine, where it is heated to the optimal brewing temperature. As the water is heated, it is forced through the coffee grounds that have been placed in the filter. The hot water extracts the flavors and oils from the ground coffee beans, ultimately resulting in brewed coffee. This is when the amount of water in the carafe plays a crucial role in the result. If more water is used than usual, the final coffee output could be greater, potentially leading to a larger volume or weaker coffee overall, depending on the ratio of water to ground coffee and how long the brewing process takes. If less water is used, the amount of coffee produced may be smaller, possibly resulting in a stronger or more concentrated brew. It is essential to maintain the appropriate water-to-grounds ratio to yield the desired strength and flavor for the final product. Furthermore, adding a bit of salt to the coffee grounds can help to enhance flavor, as salt can suppress bitterness and enhance the natural sweetness of the coffee. When the water passes through the grounds and the added salt, the salt dissolves in the brewing process, subtly altering the flavor profile of the brewed coffee. In summary, pouring water into the carafe has a significant effect on the coffee being poured out of the machine, as it directly impacts the volume and flavor of the final product. The perturbation (i.e., the amount of water poured into the carafe) influences the second effect mentioned (the coffee being poured out of the machine) by either increasing or decreasing the output and potentially altering the coffee's taste and strength."},{"instruction":"Explain how you used the definition to come up with the answer.

The neckline should be tasteful, but the sleeve length (if the dress has sleeves) is optional.  Many full-length formal gowns are sleeveless.  In the absence of a full floor-length dress, a very nice, dark colored or black three-quarters length dress may be acceptable. Older women should always choose a longer gown, but younger women may be able to wear a shorter gown appropriately. The most formal events call for a long ballgown with a full skirt. Black is usually preferred, with a rich texture that adds some visual interest.  Deep colors like blue, maroon, a rich purple, and brown also look nice. White or red dresses can be formal and classy, but may make you stand out.  Use caution when wearing these to events like weddings, at which the bride should stand out, not one of the guests. Put your regular day purse aside and opt for a satin, or beaded, smaller clutch or purse for a black tie event. The more sparkle, the better. This is a time for you to shine.  Wear real jewelry (for example, real diamonds, pearls, or gold) whenever possible. Costume jewelry should look very real and not tacky if worn. Traditional jewelry recommendations are a sparkly bracelet and earrings or very simple, understated necklace. It can be difficult to wear evening wear in the winter months, as it is often chilly and women’s black tie attire rarely has sleeves to speak of.  Your cold-weather options, however, should also be formal.  Remember that you may be able to shop at a thrift store or borrow items instead of buying them new.  A fur or faux fur coat or wrap is the preferred choice for black tie dress codes. A traditional overcoat is the second best choice. For milder climates or for time spent indoors, a shawl or wrap made from a quality material such as cashmere is preferred. Long gloves, while made for style rather than warmth, may help ward off the cold and will give you a fancy flair. None of your undergarments should be visible in any way while dressed in your evening wear.  Check for bra straps.  Most formal dresses will require a strapless bra. Be sure there are no panty lines.  If your dress is curve-hugging or tight, you need to be sure that no one will be able to see your underwear.  You may need to wear a thong or go without. Consider wearing slimming undergarments.  There are undergarments that are meant to smooth out areas of your body that may be bumpy and help give you a flattering shape.  These usually do not show any lines beneath the clothing. Evening shoes are usually dainty or strappy, with a decent heel.  Large or clunky shoes do not generally look good with formal dresses. Evening shoes that are satin, beaded or shiny are great choices.  Ideally, the texture and color of your shoes should match that of your handbag/clutch. You should spend extra time making your hair and makeup look nice for a black tie event.  Traditional black tie formality calls for hair to be gathered in an up-do.  Consider going to a salon to have a professional style your hair for you. Events that involve dancing often have more flexibility and encourage flowing hair. Arrange for a manicure and pedicure the day of the event.  Make a reservation ahead of time to ensure that they will have room for you. Makeup should be applied well and not over-done.  If you are inexperienced in makeup application, schedule a makeover at a salon or go to a makeup counter at a department store. What is a summary?","output":"A summary of the article would be: Floor length gowns are considered more elegant for formal events, with tasteful necklines and optional sleeve lengths. For the most formal occasions, long ballgowns with full skirts in deep colors or black are preferred. When selecting accessories, opt for a small, beaded clutch and real jewelry, keeping the look classy and refined. During colder months, consider a fur or faux fur coat, wrap, or shawl made from quality materials. Ensure that undergarments are not visible and choose slimming options if necessary. Evening shoes should be dainty or strappy and coordinate with your handbag. Spend additional time on hair and makeup, opting for professional services if needed.

It is a day on which people indulge themselves in sweets and various hearty foods, particularly pastries fried in oil, as a form of celebrating before the fasting period of Lent. In Poland, Fat Thursday is celebrated with various traditional pastries such as pączki (Polish donuts) and faworki (also known as angel wings).

In Italy, the day is marked by parades, parties, and eating various rich and fatty foods, as it is the last feast day before the 40-day Lenten fast. Although Fat Thursday is a pre-Lenten celebration, it differs in date from other similar occasions such as Mardi Gras (Fat Tuesday) or Shrove Tuesday (Pancake Day), which is more widely celebrated in Anglo-Saxon countries.

Make this proper case.","output":"If you are elderly or have fragile skin, it is important to try and prevent a skin tear from occurring. Skin tears are common in older adults, and people with fragile skin may be more susceptible to these injuries. Prevention is crucial as it can lead to reduced pain, discomfort and risk of infections. Here are some detailed tips to help prevent skin tears in such individuals: 1. Maintain proper skin hydration: Dry skin is more prone to tears. Use gentle moisturizers daily, preferably after bathing, to keep your skin soft and supple. Avoid hot water as it can strip away the skin's natural oils. 2. Use gentle skin cleansers: Harsh soaps and body washes can further lead to dryness and irritation. Opt for mild, fragrance-free, and hydrating cleansers when bathing. 3. Wear protective clothing: Choose clothes that provide a barrier between your skin and potential hazards. Select garments that are made of soft materials with long sleeves and pant legs to provide optimum coverage. 4. Avoid tight clothing or accessories: Compression stockings, tight socks, and other constricting items can cause friction on the skin and contribute to tearing. Make sure to wear clothing that is comfortable and fits well without causing excessive pressure. 5. Wear padded protectors: Utilize cushioned arm and leg protectors that distribute pressure evenly and reduce friction against your fragile skin. 6. Keep your environment safe: Ensure that your surroundings are free of clutter and have proper lighting to reduce the likelihood of tripping and falling. Install grab bars or handrails in high-risk areas such as bathrooms or staircases. 7. Maintain a balanced diet: Consume foods that promote skin health, including those rich in vitamins A, C, and E, as well as protein and omega-3 fatty acids. 8. Stay hydrated: Drinking enough water keeps the skin hydrated from within and helps maintain skin elasticity, thus reducing the likelihood of skin tears. 9. Regular skincare routine: Incorporate a daily skincare routine to cleanse, moisturize, and assess your skin for any signs of damage, irritation, or potential issues. 10. Be gentle when handling the skin: Be cautious during daily activities, such as getting dressed, applying lotion, or handling objects, to minimize the risk of skin tears. 11. Consult with a healthcare professional: If you are concerned about the fragility of your skin or are experiencing recurrent skin tears, consult with a healthcare professional. They can provide additional guidance and recommendations tailored to your specific needs. Remember, prevention is the key to minimizing the risk of skin tears amongst elderly individuals or those with fragile skin. Implement these measures to promote healthier skin and reduce the chances of injuries."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant. User will you give you a task.

Rolling down the windows to let in fresh air, she settled back to enjoy her lunch. Suddenly she noticed a big  _ man running through the parking lot. Before she came to realize what would happen, the man was there, shouting through her window, \\"Get out!\\"  Neilson refused. Pulling open her door, the man seized her by the neck and hair, and threw her out of the car onto the ground. She screamed, grabbing her purse and the keys. Two reporters of the local newspaper, Robert Bruce and Jeff Jackson, just outside their office building on a break, heard the screams and began running . When they reached Neilson's car, the attacker had jumped into the driver's seat and was madly searching for the keys. Bruce opened the door, and he and Jackson dragged the man out. The attacker fought back. But even in his cornered panic, he was no match for the two athletic men. Reggie Miller, a worker of the local newspaper, heard the screams, too. He rushed back to the office to phone the police, and then ran back with some plastic ropes ---- used to tie up newspapers. With his arms tied tight behind him, the prisoner looked up and said coldly, \\"I hope you guys feel good about yourselves---- you just caught one of the most wanted men.\\" They ignored him and waited for the police. Later, Bruce and Jackson were shocked to learn the man was the professional carjacker  and suspected murderer, whose picture---- but with a full head of hair---- had been recently printed in their own newspaper.

I have a test where I am given the following article, what is an answer for the question: What is the last name of the person whose anger and frustration over his marriage can be evidenced in a number of musical works, most notably between 1897 and 1904? ?  While travelling, Nielsen discovered and then turned against Richard Wagner's music dramas, heard many of Europe's leading orchestras and soloists and sharpened his opinions on both music and the visual arts. Although he revered the music of Bach and Mozart, he remained ambivalent about much 19th-century music. In 1891 he met the composer and pianist Ferruccio Busoni in Leipzig; they were to maintain a correspondence for over thirty years. Shortly after arriving in Paris in early March 1891 Nielsen met the Danish sculptor Anne Marie Brodersen, who was also travelling on a scholarship. They toured Italy together and married in St Mark's English Church, Florence, on 10 May 1891 before returning to Denmark. According to Fanning, their relationship was not only a \\"love match\\", but also a \\"meeting of minds\\"; Anne Marie was a gifted artist and a \\"strong-willed and modern-minded woman, determined to forge her own career\\". This determination would strain the Nielsens' marriage, as Anne Marie would spend months away from home during the 1890s and 1900s, leaving Carl, who was susceptible to opportunities with other ladies, to raise their three young children in addition to composing and fulfilling his duties at the Royal Theatre.Nielsen sublimated his anger and frustration over his marriage in a number of musical works, most notably between 1897 and 1904, a period which he sometimes called his \\"psychological\\" period. Fanning writes, \\"At this time his interest in the driving forces behind human personality crystallized in the opera Saul and David and the Second Symphony (The Four Temperaments) and the cantatas Hymnus amoris and Søvnen\\". Carl suggested divorce in March 1905 and had considered moving to Germany for a fresh start, but despite several extended periods of separation the Nielsens remained married for the remainder of the composer's life.Nielsen had five children, two of them illegitimate. He had already fathered a son, Carl August Nielsen, in January 1888, before he met Anne Marie.

U.S. first lady Laura Bush -- in a rare foray into foreign policy -- called on Myanmar's military junta to \\"step aside,\\" give up the \\"terror campaigns\\" against its people and allow for a democratic Myanmar in a commentary published in Wednesday's Wall Street Journal. U.S. first lady Laura Bush said the junta \\"should step aside to make way for a unified Burma.\\" \\"Gen. Than Shwe and his deputies are a friendless regime,\\" Bush said. \\"They should step aside to make way for a unified Burma [Myanmar] governed by legitimate leaders. \\"The rest of the armed forces should not fear this transition -- there is room for a professional military in a democratic Burma,\\" Bush said, in keeping with the U.S. policy of still using Myanmar's former name. In Wednesday's commentary, Bush called on Myanmar's military leaders to release Aun Sung Suu Kyi and other opposition leaders so they can meet with and plan for a transition to democracy. \\"Meanwhile, the world watches -- and waits,\\" Bush warns. \\"We know that Gen. Than Shwe and his deputies have the advantage of violent force. But Ms. Suu Kyi and other opposition leaders have moral legitimacy, the support of the Burmese people and the support of the world. \\"The regime's position grows weaker by the day. The generals' choice is clear: The time for a free Burma is now.\\" The humanitarian rights situation in Myanmar has been a cause for the first lady in the past few months as the crisis there worsened. Myanmar state media has reported that 2,000 people were detained during the demonstrations and the crackdown against them -- under an emergency law imposed on September 25 banning assembly of more than five people -- and that 700 of those people have been released. The official death toll from Myanmar's leadership is at 10, but there are reports that hundreds were killed and thousands arrested in the wake of the demonstrations that peaked late September, which were led by Myanmar's Buddhist monks. On Tuesday morning, Bush received a phone call from U.N. Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon to update her on the efforts of his special envoy to Myanmar, Ibrahim Gambari. A representative of the secretary general said the call was a follow-up to a conversation they had weeks ago. Gambari met last week with the military junta leadership as well as with Nobel Peace Prize winner Suu Kyi, who is under house arrest in Yangon. The U.S. ambassador to the United Nations, Zalmay Khalilzad, told reporters that Laura Bush and her husband's administration believe that there is a \\"need to start preparing for transition\\" for Myanmar. \\"We believe it is very important that progress be made and prisoners be released and conditions for Aun Sung Suu Kyi be improved [so] that she can prepare for participation for negotiations for a transition,\\" he said.

They go on to mention that there has been an influx of new fans watching \\"tv\\" who might not have known about the band's earlier work. Moreover, they strongly disagree with those who labeled the album as monotonous or a one-hit album by calling such claims \\"straight blasphemy.\\" The enthusiasm shown towards the featured song is another indicator of the positive nature of this review. The reviewer claims it to be \\"THE song of 2007\\" and seems to be genuinely impacted by the track, even mentioning that it left them \\"speechless.\\" It's clear that this reviewer is passionate about the song and holds it in high regard.

In this case, their opinion may carry more weight to others, since they are familiar with the band's previous works and are excited about the new album. In conclusion, this product review is undeniably positive due to the enthusiastic tone, strong defense of the album against negative claims, and the profound admiration for the featured song. The review shows that the writer is an ardent fan of Snow Patrol and highly recommends the album to others, which will likely persuade others to give the album a listen and potentially increase its popularity."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

There was a likelihood that the Japanese yen would rise in value. In the wake of this event, Japanese Government adjusted  the price of Japanese Currency Yen in accordance with the going market price. On the other hand, at he same time, UK was having economic downturn. There was a likelihood that the UK Currency Pound Sterling would go down. Fearing public backlash, UK Government kept the price of the Pound Sterling at the same level.  Given the paragraph above, please answer correctly the following question:   Which currency would most likely be exchanged in the black market, Pound Sterling or Yen?  Hint: Often, foreign exchange controls can result in the creation of black markets to exchange the weaker currency for stronger currencies. This leads to a situation where the exchange rate for the foreign currency is much higher than the rate set by the government, and therefore creates a shadow currency exchange market. As such, it is unclear whether governments have the ability to enact effective exchange controls.[1] Answer:","output":"Given the information in the paragraph, the currency that would most likely be exchanged in the black market is the Pound Sterling because the UK government kept the price of the Pound Sterling at the same level despite facing an economic downturn.

Lee's swift actions and direction towards the school entrance indicate that they have an important reason to be there, and are motivated to arrive quickly. It's important to note that the context provided doesn't contain enough information to be absolutely certain about the reason behind Lee's hurried actions.

Under Hitler's rule, Germany was transformed into a fascist state in which the Nazi Party took totalitarian control over nearly all aspects of life. The official name of the state was \\"Deutsches Reich\\" from 1933 to 1943 and \\"Großdeutsches Reich\\" (\\"Greater German Reich\\") from 1943 to 1945. The period is also known under the names the Third Reich and the National Socialist Period (abbreviated as \\"NS-Zeit\\"). The Nazi regime came to an end after the Allied Powers defeated Germany in May 1945, ending World War II in Europe.  - The Schutzstaffel (SS; also stylized as with Armanen runes literally \\"Protection Squadron\\") was a major paramilitary organization under Adolf Hitler and the National Socialist German Workers' Party (NSDAP; Nazi Party) in Nazi Germany. It began with a small guard unit known as the \\"Saal-Schutz\\" (Hall-Protection) made up of NSDAP volunteers to provide security for party meetings in Munich. In 1925, Heinrich Himmler joined the unit, which had by then been reformed and given its final name. Under his direction (192945), it grew from a small paramilitary formation to one of the most powerful organizations in Nazi Germany. From 1929 until the regime's collapse in 1945, the SS was the foremost agency of surveillance and terror within Germany and German-occupied Europe.  - Joachim Peiper ( German pronunciation : ( joaxm pap ) ; 30 January 1915 -- 14 July 1976 ) , also known as Jochen Peiper , was a field officer in the Waffen - SS during World War II and personal adjutant to Reichsführer - SS Heinrich Himmler between November 1940 and August 1941 . Peiper fought on both the Eastern Front against the Red Army and the Western Front against the Western Allies , and he won the Knight 's Cross of the Iron Cross with Oak Leaves and Swords for extreme battlefield bravery and outstanding military leadership . By 1945 , he was an SS - Standartenführer and the Waffen - SS 's youngest regimental colonel . Peiper was convicted of war crimes committed in Belgium and imprisoned for almost 12 years . He was accused of war crimes in Italy , but Italian and German courts concluded that there was insufficient evidence to warrant prosecution . After his release from prison , Peiper worked for both Porsche and Volkswagen , before moving to France , where he translated books from English to German under the nom de plume Rainer Buschmann . Peiper was murdered in France in July 1976 , when he was shot by unknown assailants who then burned his house to the ground using Molotov cocktails .  - Adjutant is a military rank or appointment. In some armies, including most English-speaking ones, it is an officer who assists a more senior officer, while in other armies, especially Francophone ones, it is an NCO (non-commissioned officer), normally corresponding roughly to a staff sergeant or warrant officer.  - Reichsführer-SS was a special title and rank that existed between the years of 1925 and 1945 for the commander of the Schutzstaffel (SS). \\"Reichsführer-SS\\" was a title from 1925 to 1933, and from 1934 to 1945 it was the highest rank of the SS. The longest serving and by far most noteworthy \\"Reichsführer-SS\\" was Heinrich Himmler.  - Hiroshima is perhaps best known as the first city in history to be targeted by a nuclear weapon when the United States Army Air Forces (USAAF) dropped an atomic bomb on the city (and later on Nagasaki) at 8:15 a.m. on August 6, 1945, near the end of World War II.  - The Holocaust (from the Greek ': \\"hólos\\", \\"whole\\" and \\"kaustós\\", \\"burnt\\"), also referred to as the Shoah\\"' (Hebrew: , \\"HaShoah\\", \\"the catastrophe\\"), was a genocide in which Adolf Hitler's Nazi Germany and its collaborators killed about six million Jews. The victims included 1.5 million children and represented about two-thirds of the nine million Jews who had resided in Europe. Some definitions of the Holocaust include the additional five million non-Jewish victims of Nazi mass murders, bringing the total to about 11 million. Killings took place throughout Nazi Germany, German-occupied territories, and territories held by allies of Nazi Germany.  - The National Socialist German Workers' Party (abbreviated NSDAP), commonly referred to in English as the Nazi Party, was a political party in Germany that was active between 1920 and 1945 and practised the ideology of Nazism. Its precursor, the German Workers' Party (\\"Deutsche Arbeiterpartei\\"; DAP), existed from 1919 to 1920.   - Adolf Hitler (20 April 1889  30 April 1945) was a German politician who was the leader of the Nazi Party (\\"Nationalsozialistische Deutsche Arbeiterpartei\\"; NSDAP), Chancellor of Germany from 1933 to 1945, and Führer (\\"Leader\\") of Nazi Germany from 1934 to 1945. As dictator of the German Reich, he initiated World War II in Europe with the invasion of Poland in September 1939 and was central to the Holocaust.  - Sergeant (abbreviated to Sgt and capitalised when used as a named person's title) is a rank in many uniformed organizations, principally military and policing forces. Its origin is the Latin \\"serviens\\", \\"one who serves\\", through the French term \\"sergent\\".  - In politics and military planning, a war effort refers to a coordinated mobilization of society's resourcesboth industrial and humantowards the support of a military force. Depending on the militarization of the culture, the relative size of the armed forces and the society supporting them, the style of government, and the popular support for the military objectives, such war effort can range from a small industry to complete command of society.  - The Waffen-SS (Armed SS) was the armed wing of the Nazi Party's SS organisation. Its formations included men from Nazi Germany, along with volunteers and conscripts from both occupied and un-occupied lands.  - Heinrich Luitpold Himmler (7 October 1900  23 May 1945) was \\"Reichsführer\\" of the \\"Schutzstaffel\\" (Protection Squadron; SS), and a leading member of the Nazi Party (NSDAP) of Nazi Germany. Nazi leader Adolf Hitler briefly appointed him a military commander and later Commander of the Replacement (Home) Army and General Plenipotentiary for the administration of the entire Third Reich (\\"Generalbevollmächtigter für die Verwaltung\\"). Himmler was one of the most powerful men in Nazi Germany and one of the people most directly responsible for the Holocaust.  - World War II (often abbreviated to WWII or WW2), also known as the Second World War, was a global war that lasted from 1939 to 1945, although related conflicts began earlier. It involved the vast majority of the world's nationsincluding all of the great powerseventually forming two opposing military alliances: the Allies and the Axis. It was the most widespread war in history, and directly involved more than 100 million people from over 30 countries. In a state of \\"total war\\", the major participants threw their entire economic, industrial, and scientific capabilities behind the war effort, erasing the distinction between civilian and military resources. Marked by mass deaths of civilians, including the Holocaust (in which approximately 11 million people were killed) and the strategic bombing of industrial and population centres (in which approximately one million were killed, and which included the atomic bombings of Hiroshima and Nagasaki), it resulted in an estimated 50 million to 85 million fatalities. These made World War II the deadliest conflict in human history.  - Strategic bombing is a military strategy used in a total war with the goal of defeating the enemy by destroying its morale or its economic ability to produce and transport materiel to the theatres of military operations, or both. It is a systematically organized and executed attack from the air which can utilize strategic bombers, long- or medium-range missiles, or nuclear-armed fighter-bomber aircraft to attack targets deemed vital to the enemy's war-making capability.

Article: Even if you are no longer being abused or assaulted, it is possible for you to still be experiencing lingering physiological effects of trauma from the abuse. This trauma is comparable to PTSD. Flashbacks from the experience, along with intense fear and panic, can arise unexpectedly during your day-to-day life. Often the scars remain years after the abuse has stopped, and many people go to counselors to seek further help in overcoming the effects of their past.   A mental health counselor or therapist can lend you a supportive ear and provide various techniques to help you overcome the effects of any trauma that you might be holding on to. Domestic violence organizations often have counseling services to help victims of domestic violence situations and sexual assault. One of the most important steps to recognizing and escaping the clutches of sexual abuse is to realize that it is not your fault that you are or were being abused. Guilt or shame will sometimes arise, either as a result of the perpetrator's actions or from the way you are treated by people you tell, but it’s important not to allow this to keep you from telling other people and getting help for yourself. It’s important to know that being assaulted or abused by another person is never your fault.   Abusers choose to abuse other people. No matter how vulnerable or foolish you might have been, they chose to take advantage of you. Abusers can play mind games. They might convince you of things that are wrong, and make you believe that you are undeserving of love and care. After an assault or ongoing abuse, it may take a while before you are feeling like yourself again. During this time you may feel frustrated, but it is important that you do not take out your frustration on yourself. Accept that you will need time to recover and that it will be a challenging process. Imagine if a friend was going through the same thing. Think of the time it would take them to recover, and what you would say to them. Try to extend this empathy to yourself. Something horrible happened to you, so of course you are going to have difficult feelings about it. Let yourself be upset. Allow yourself to experience anger, sadness, confusion, and all kinds of emotions. This is a normal part of the healing process. Look for the people who are most important in your life, the ones who lift your spirits and make you feel relaxed. Pick up the phone or go to the kitchen and spend time with them. The support of others will help you heal. One way that you can begin to express your frustrations about what happened to you is to write about them. Start keeping a journal where you write a little bit each day. Write about whatever is on your mind. Some people even benefit from describing the abuse they endured. As you heal, you will need to keep talking to people who care and understand. Try joining a support group for survivors of sexual abuse to connect with people who understand what you are going through. These support groups can provide a safe place to talk about your experience and hear what other people have been through, which may help you realize that you are not alone. It is common to experience feelings that you are not in control or to have difficulty making decisions. The best thing that you can do to regain some control over your life is to start making decisions about your recovery and your future. Gather as much information as you can about your situation and make decisions about how you want to respond.   If you are pressing charges for rape or domestic abuse, choose a lawyer to help you navigate the legal matters. If you have an STI or injuries, choose a doctor that can help you find treatment. For emotional recovery, choose a counselor to help you work through it. What is a summary of what this article is about?","output":"This article discusses the lingering physiological effects of trauma from abuse or assault, which can be similar to PTSD. It emphasizes that it is not the victim's fault and that abusers choose to abuse others.

Answer the above question based on the context below:  The Ballroom, also known as the Upper Banqueting Hall, has an arched roof and according to Dean likely dates from the 16th century. It contains rare 16th-century wall murals, including one which according to Dean may depict the nursery rhyme \\"Ride a cock horse\\", and another along the east wall depicting a man playing a mandolin. Above the Chapel is the Chapel Room, also known as the Queen Anne Room, the Priest's Room, and Nevill's Room. It had been two rooms, a state bedroom and ante-room, but was almost totally transformed in the late 19th century into one larger room. A blocked-up door next to the fireplace was thought to have been a priest hole, but is more likely to have been the entrance to the first floor of the house from an external staircase before the wing was restructured, probably in the late 16th century or the early 17th century.North of the Chapel Room is the Paradise Room, whose name derives from the bed hangings which include embroidered images of Adam and Eve and their fall from paradise, as well as the use in Tudor times of the name \\"paradise\\" for a favourite room, often a bedchamber.

The medium can store any kind of digital data and is widely used for software and other computer files as well as video programs watched using DVD players. DVDs offer higher storage capacity than compact discs while having the same dimensions.  - In computing and optical disc recording technologies, an optical disc (OD) is a flat, usually circular disc which encodes binary data (bits) in the form of pits (binary value of 0 or off, due to lack of reflection when read) and lands (binary value of 1 or on, due to a reflection when read) on a special material (often aluminium ) on one of its flat surfaces. The encoding material sits atop a thicker substrate (usually polycarbonate) which makes up the bulk of the disc and forms a dust defocusing layer. The encoding pattern follows a continuous, spiral path covering the entire disc surface and extending from the innermost track to the outermost track. The data is stored on the disc with a laser or stamping machine, and can be accessed when the data path is illuminated with a laser diode in an optical disc drive which spins the disc at speeds of about 200 to 4,000 RPM or more, depending on the drive type, disc format, and the distance of the read head from the center of the disc (inner tracks are read at a higher disc speed). Most optical discs exhibit a characteristic iridescence as a result of the diffraction grating formed by its grooves. This side of the disc contains the actual data and is typically coated with a transparent material, usually lacquer. The reverse side of an optical disc usually has a printed label, sometimes made of paper but often printed or stamped onto the disc itself. Unlike the 3-inch floppy disk, most optical discs do not have an integrated protective casing and are therefore susceptible to data transfer problems due to scratches, fingerprints, and other environmental problems.  - Matthew Abram \\"Matt\\" Groening (; born February 15, 1954) is an American cartoonist, writer, producer, animator, and voice actor.

According to the Moscow Armistice, signed by Finland and the victorious Allies, mainly the Soviet Union, the Finns were to try those who were responsible for the war and those who had committed war crimes. The Soviet Union allowed Finland to try its own war criminals, unlike other losing countries of the Second World War. The Finnish parliament had to create ex post facto laws for the trials, though in the case of war crimes the country had already signed the Hague IV Convention. In victorious Allied countries war-crime trials were exceptional, but Finland had to arrange full-scale investigations and trials, and report them for the Soviet Union. Criminal charges were filed against 1,381 Finnish POW camp staff members, resulting in 723 convictions and 658 acquittals. They were accused of 42 murders and 342 other homicides.

Please answer the following question: People in South Korea who feel they can no longer bear the stress of everyday life now can choose to stay in a prison to relax and think deeply. In a society where pressure to do well in school and find highly-paid jobs is intense, a former lawyer came up with an extreme relaxation idea. Kwon Yong-seok created the \\"Prison Inside Me\\"--a stress-reduction center with a punishment theme. People come here to cut themselves off from the outside world and pay to be kept in 60-square-foot (5.6-square-meter) cells  . Located on the outskirts of Hongcheon, about 58 miles (93 km) northeast of Seoul, \\"Prison Inside Me\\" came to life after Mr. Kwon voluntarily asked to spend time behind bars for \\"healing reasons,\\" but his request was turned down. \\"I didn't know how to stop working back then,\\" he said. \\"I felt like I was being swept away against my will, and it seemed I couldn't control my own life.\\" So, Kwon and his wife Roh Ji-hyang decided to take matters into their own hands, and designed and built a prison-like spiritual center. The construction was completed in June last year and cost about 2 billion won (19 million). The facility includes 28 cells, furnished with only a toilet, a sink and a small table, where guests can spend time alone, thinking about life and enjoying private thinking periods. Moreover, guests can also join group thinking periods in the hall, where they are given instructions on how to free themselves from what Mr. Kwon calls the \\"inner prison\\" to find inner peace. According to the Wall Street Journal, hundreds of stressed South Koreans are checking in at the stress-reduction facility to think about their lives and regain control of it. A two-night stay at \\"Prison Inside Me\\" costs 150,000 won (146). Mr. Kwon and his wife explained that at the beginning they had a different plan for the \\"relaxation center,\\" and imagined a longer stay for their guests, but, given that people weren't able to take more time off, they had to reduce the length of stays to just two days. Park Woo-sub, a guest at \\"Prison... Who should go to the \\"Prison Inside Me\\"? A) A successful businessman B) A criminal at large C) A primary student D) A depressed man Answer:","output":"D) A depressed man"},{"instruction":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation. Think like you are answering to a five year old. Here is a question about this article: The 45 rpm discs also came in a variety known as extended play (EP), which achieved up to 10–15 minutes play at the expense of attenuating (and possibly compressing) the sound to reduce the width required by the groove. EP discs were cheaper to produce, and were used in cases where unit sales were likely to be more limited or to reissue LP albums on the smaller format for those people who had only 45 rpm players. LP albums could be purchased 1 EP at a time, with four items per EP, or in a boxed set with 3 EPs or 12 items. The large center hole on 45s allows for easier handling by jukebox mechanisms. EPs were generally discontinued by the late 1950s in the U.S. as three- and four-speed record players replaced the individual 45 players. One indication of the decline of the 45 rpm EP is that the last Columbia Records reissue of Frank Sinatra songs on 45 rpm EP records, called Frank Sinatra (Columbia B-2641) was issued on December 7, 1959. The EP lasted considerably longer in Europe, and was a popular format during the 1960s for recordings by artists such as Serge Gainsbourg and the Beatles. What is the answer to this question: Why were 45s more popular with jukeboxes?","output":"Okay, imagine you have a big delicious cookie and a small cookie with a big hole in the middle. The 45s records are like the small cookie with the big hole. The jukeboxes are like a special kind of cookie-eating machine that loves these small cookies with big holes. 45s were more popular with jukeboxes because the big hole in the middle made it easier for the jukebox's special cookie-eating mechanism to handle and play the records.

The app offers some great features, including the ability to emulate a wide range of PSP games on my smartphone, which is quite impressive. The graphics quality and performance are decent, making the gaming experience enjoyable most of the time. However, as much as the app has potential, there are a few key areas where it could use improvement. Firstly, compatibility with certain games is hit-or-miss; some work seamlessly, while others either crash or exhibit significant bugs that impact gameplay. It would be great to see a more extensive and regularly updated compatibility list that keeps users informed. Secondly, the user interface is quite outdated and could use a visual overhaul. Navigation can be a bit confusing at times, with settings and options hidden away in not-so-intuitive locations. A more streamlined and modern UI would significantly enhance the overall user experience. Lastly, the app's performance is also inconsistent across different devices. While it runs smoothly on my high-end smartphone, I've found that it struggles on lower-end devices, leading to stuttering or lag. Improved optimization for various hardware configurations would ensure a more enjoyable gaming experience for all users.

Answer the following question: Question: what is the difference between multistage and cluster sampling I found the following answer on Google: Cluster sampling is a sampling technique used when \\"natural\\" but relatively homogeneous groupings are evident in a statistical population . Is that a correct answer? Yes or no. Answer:","output":"Yes, your found answer provides a basic definition of cluster sampling, but it only touches the surface of the concept and doesn't completely address the differences between multistage and cluster sampling. To give you a more comprehensive understanding, let me provide a detailed comparison between the two sampling techniques. Multistage sampling and cluster sampling are both probability sampling techniques that are employed when studying large and complex populations. They are designed to make the sampling process more efficient and manageable. Cluster Sampling: Cluster sampling is a technique used when \\"natural\\" but relatively homogeneous groupings are evident in a statistical population. In this method, the entire population is divided into separate clusters, usually based on some shared characteristic or geographical proximity. The clusters should be more or less representative of the population. Then, a random sample of these clusters is selected for the study. All the elements within the chosen clusters are included in the sample. For instance, if a researcher wants to study the academic performance of high school students in a large city, they may divide the population into clusters based on individual schools. Then, a random sample of schools is selected, and data is collected from all students in those chosen schools. Advantages of cluster sampling include reduced travel and administrative costs and easier implementation compared to simple random sampling. Multistage Sampling: Multistage sampling is an extension of cluster sampling and involves multiple stages of sampling within the selected clusters. In this technique, the population is first divided into clusters, and then, instead of selecting all elements in the chosen clusters, further random samples are drawn from within each selected cluster at different stages. This process can be carried out in multiple stages, depending on the desired sample size and level of detail. Continuing with the previous high school academic performance example, in a multistage sampling design, the researcher might first choose a set of schools (clusters). Then, within each selected school, a random set of classrooms or specific grades might be chosen. Following this, a random sample of students from within the selected classrooms or grades may be taken. This multi-step approach reduces the overall sample size while still maintaining a fair representation of the population. Multistage sampling can increase the overall efficiency and accuracy of research findings while reducing the sample size and logistical challenges. In summary, the main difference between multistage and cluster sampling lies in the additional stages of sampling within the clusters for multistage sampling. While both techniques involve breaking the population into clusters, cluster sampling includes all elements within the chosen clusters, whereas multistage sampling involves multiple stages of random sampling within those selected clusters to obtain the final sample. Each technique has its advantages and can be applied depending on the nature of the study, the required level of accuracy, and the available resources."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Question: Extract the answer to the question from the following context. Question: what groups research shows that new models are needed Context: Slack (2003) compares three groups that conducted biological research at Yale during overlapping periods between 1910 and 1970. Yale proved important as a site for this research. The leaders of these groups were Ross Granville Harrison, Grace E. Pickford, and G. Evelyn Hutchinson, and their members included both graduate students and more experienced scientists. All produced innovative research, including the opening of new subfields in embryology, endocrinology, and ecology, respectively, over a long period of time. Harrison's group is shown to have been a classic research school; Pickford's and Hutchinson's were not. Pickford's group was successful in spite of her lack of departmental or institutional position or power. Hutchinson and his graduate and postgraduate students were extremely productive, but in diverse areas of ecology rather than one focused area of research or the use of one set of research tools. Hutchinson's example shows that new models for research groups are needed, especially for those that include extensive field research.

If you were flipping around your television dial on Election Night, you saw a lot of news coverage dominated by anchors and pundits sitting in TV studios spouting opinion and analysis. But not on CNN. On our air, you saw dozens of reporters at polling places around the country, watching for irregularities but also capturing the messy yet miraculous spectacle of democracy in action. You saw Candy Crowley, Jessica Yellin, Jim Acosta and Brianna Keilar at election night headquarters, offering behind the scenes details about the candidates and campaigns as they anxiously awaited the verdict of the people. You saw Dana Bash dissecting the Senate and House outcomes as only someone can who has covered Congress for two decades. And you saw the maestro of the Magic Wall, John King, interpreting the tallies from decisive counties within the swing states minute by minute as they came in, telling you what they meant and how they would shape the electoral map. A lot has been written about how cable news has become increasingly dominated by talk and opinion, because that's what drives TV ratings. But as we began our planning for Election Night more than a year ago, CNN decided to go in the opposite direction and double down on our strength: reporting. We pared back on the number of analysts in our studio and sent more reporters into the field. We invested in new state-of-the-art sets in our Washington bureau that allowed us to display electoral data more clearly and vividly than we ever had before. We relied on two anchors, Wolf Blitzer and Anderson Cooper, who have always been more interested in conducting great correspondents than being soloists themselves. We asked our incomparable international reporters to keep track of what the rest of the world was saying about America's voteâ€”and we actually put them on our U.S. airwaves to talk about it. We did it because we value facts more than opinions, but also because these days that's what sets CNN apart. And we were glad to see that, for this historical night at least, it was what the public appeared to crave as well. An average of more than 8.8 million viewers watched the evening's coverage on our U.S. network, more than any other cable news network, and others followed it on CNN's international networks around the world. The reviews are also in, and they tell us that our investment in covering the election as journalists was welcomed. \\"CNN Destroys Cable Competition on Election Night,\\" was only one gratifying headline, on a post by Erik Wemple, the media critic for The Washington Post. At CNN.com, we had more than 203 million page views, the highest in four years. Our social media traffic on Twitter, Facebook and other sharing platforms set new records. But at CNN we're not ones to dwell over press clippings, good or bad, and so we are already hard at work following up on all the angles that emerged from last night's result. Can the parties now come together to address jobs, the deficit, immigration, the environment, relations with Iran and China and all the other pressing problems clouding our future? Or is a 6 billion election that left us with the same division of executive and legislative power we had before a recipe for more gridlock? And what will the demographic winds that carried Barack Obama to reelection, despite a sour economy, mean for tomorrow? How will our future be shaped by a Hispanic population that now accounts for more than 1 in 10 voters, by the empowerment of a generation of young voters who have now turned out in record numbers for two presidential cycles in a row (and who are driving a slow but steady sea change in acceptance of gay rights), by a white electorate that favored Mitt Romney, but is smaller than it has ever been, by the growing political gap between women, who favored Obama by 11 points, and men, who went for Romney by 7 points? And what are we to make of not only the persistent red/blue divide between states, but the growing urban/suburban/rural divisions within states?

A fire extinguisher works by eliminating one or more elements needed for fire to exist, which are heat, oxygen and fuel, also known as the fire triangle. The exerted pressure inside the extinguisher pushes out a substance which can suppress the fire, usually a foam or powder. The discharged substance will aim to cool the burning fuel (thus removing the heat), to remove the supply of oxygen (so the fire cannot continue to burn) or to inhibit the chemical reaction making the fire. Different types of fire extinguishers offer different substances, for example, for a common class A fire (caused by solid materials such as wood or paper), water is usually used to cool the burning material and hence extinguish the fire.

Write an article based on this summary: On Jordan's bleak, windswept border with Iraq there is little two-way traffic these days.","output":"Title: The Current State of Jordan's Bleak and Windswept Border with Iraq Introduction The boundary between Jordan and Iraq has historically been an essential conduit for bilateral trade, movement of people, and cultural exchanges. However, recent years have witnessed a dramatic decline in two-way traffic on this once bustling border. This article will explore the underlying reasons for the decline in border activity and its impact on the local communities in both Jordan and Iraq. The Deserted Landscape The once teeming border of Jordan and Iraq is now characterized by its desolation. The windswept desert dunes on both sides of the boundary have a bleakness that permeates deeper due to the drastic drop in border crossings. The scarcity of people and goods crossing the border is a striking change from what was previously a hub of activity amid the vast, uninviting terrain. Culprits behind the Decline Various factors have contributed to the dwindling of two-way traffic between Jordan and Iraq. Key causes include: 1. Escalating security concerns: The emergence of extremist groups like ISIS in the region has led to widespread instability, spreading fear amongst individuals and businesses. The resulting militant clashes have rendered the borders unsafe and heavily militarized, discouraging people from traveling across the boundary. 2. Economic downturn: The ongoing economic slowdown in both Jordan and Iraq, coupled with lower oil prices, has diminished the incentive for trade between the two countries. Moreover, global sanctions imposed on Iraq have further stifled the nation's ability to engage in cross-border commercial activity. 3. The refugee crisis: The influx of refugees from war-torn countries such as Syria has put immense strain on Jordan's resources, leading the nation to enforce stricter border control measures to manage the situation. Impact on Local Communities The decrease in border traffic has left local communities on both sides of the boundary struggling to adapt. Many families who once relied on cross-border trade or tourism for their livelihood now find their businesses faltering. The lack of economic opportunities has led to increased unemployment, financial hardship, and even forced migration for some communities. Looking Forward Addressing the issues that have led to the deteriorating state of the Jordan-Iraq border is paramount for the future growth and stability of the region. Fostering a more secure environment by addressing extremist threats and regional instability is critical for restoring confidence in border crossings. Additionally, stimulating economic growth and lifting trade restrictions can help revive the moribund commercial activities between the two countries. Conclusion Jordan's bleak, windswept border with Iraq may currently be experiencing a low point in two-way traffic, but there is hope for improvement in the future. By tackling the security, economic, and humanitarian challenges present in the region, it is possible to rekindle the sense of vibrancy and cooperation that once existed between the two neighbors. Only by addressing these issues can the local communities rebuild and thrive again on both sides of the border."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant. User will you give you a task.

We have to find the value of \\"z\\" in this equation:  236*z - 588*z - 16086 = 496*z - 82*z First, let's add up the \\"z\\" terms on each side of the equation (these are the numbers with the letter \\"z\\" next to them). On the left side, we have: 236*z - 588*z = (236 - 588)*z = -352*z On the right side, we have: 496*z - 82*z = (496 - 82)*z = 414*z Now, our equation looks like this: -352*z - 16086 = 414*z Next, we want to move all the \\"z\\" terms to one side of the equation and all the number terms to the other side. To do that, we'll add 352*z to both sides of the equation. This will cancel out the -352*z on the left side: -352*z + 352*z - 16086 = 414*z + 352*z This simplifies to: -16086 = 766*z Now, we want to isolate the \\"z\\" by itself. To do that, we'll divide both sides by 766: -16086 / 766 = 766*z / 766 After dividing, we get: z = -21 So, the value of \\"z\\" in this equation is -21.

Process: - Water flows into the dishwasher - The dishwasher heats the water - The detergent dispenser opens at the right time - Water is shot through the jets to clean the dishes - The dirty water is drained - More water is sprayed to rinse the dishes - The water is drained again - The air is heated in the dishwasher to dry the dishes.  Question: suppose there is no food stuck in the jets happens, how will it affect soapy water will be sprayed on the dishes.  How does the supposed perturbation influence the second effect mentioned. Answer by more, less or no effect Answer:","output":"If there is no food stuck in the jets, this would result in an efficient and unhindered spraying process, and, consequently, the soapy water will be more effectively sprayed on the dishes. The supposed perturbation enhances the efficiency of the water jets which in turn increases the effectiveness of the cleaning process. This improvement has a positive influence on the second effect mentioned, which is the shooting of water through the jets to clean the dishes. Since there is no blockage due to food particles, the water jets can effectively spray the soapy water onto the entirety of the dishes. This allows for a more thorough cleaning, effectively reaching all corners and edges of the dishes, and ensuring the removal of any grime, dirt, or residual food particles. As a result, the overall dishwashing capabilities are enhanced as the dishwasher can not only clean more efficiently but also potentially minimize the need for a manual pre-wash or post-wash intervention. So, in conclusion, having no food stuck in the jets results in a more effective spraying of soapy water on the dishes, positively influencing the cleaning process and reducing the likelihood of residue or leftover dirt on the dishes."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

What is the answer for the question: Who is the sister of the woman that the flight sergeant asks to marry him? from the following article ?  Celia Crowson and her family go on holiday to the south coast of England in the summer of 1939. Soon afterwards the Second World War breaks out and Celia's father joins what was to become the Home Guard and her more confident sister Phyllis joins the Auxiliary Territorial Service.  Fearing her father's disapproval if she moves away from home, Celia hesitates about joining up but eventually her call-up papers arrive. Hoping to join the WAAF or one of the other services, Celia instead gets posted to a factory making aircraft components, where she meets her co-workers, including her Welsh room-mate Gwen Price and the vain upper middle class Jennifer Knowles. Knowles dislikes the work they have to do at the factory, causing friction with their supervisor Charlie Forbes which eventually blossoms into a verbally combative romance. A nearby RAF bomber station sends some of its men to a staff dance at the factory, during which Celia meets and falls in love with an equally shy young Scottish flight sergeant Fred Blake. Their relationship encounters a crisis when Fred refuses to tell Celia when he is sent out on his first mission, but soon afterwards they meet and make up, with Fred asking Celia to marry him. After the wedding they spend their honeymoon at the same south coast resort as the Crowsons went to in 1939, finding it much changed with minefields and barbed wire defending against the expected German invasion.

Answer by taking a quote from the following article: Francis \\"Frank\\" Hague, born in Jersey City, was the fourth of eight children to John D. and Margaret Hague (nee Fagen), immigrants from County Cavan, Ireland. He was raised in Jersey City's Second ward, an area known as The Horseshoe due to its shape which wrapped around a railroad loop. The ward was created when the Republican-controlled legislature gerrymandered a district within Jersey City in 1871 to concentrate and isolate Democratic, and mostly Catholic, votes. By age 14, Hague was expelled from school prior to completing the sixth grade for poor attendance and unacceptable behavior. In 1913, the first election for the city commission saw 91 men on the ballot competing for five available seats on the commission. Hague finished fourth with 17,390 votes and was elected to the first City Commission of Jersey City. The only Wittpenn-supported candidate, A. Harry Moore, was also elected. As a result of having garnered the most votes (21,419) former mayor Fagan became the first mayor under this new form of government, and the only Republican to hold that title in Jersey City for the following 75 years. Hague was named public safety commissioner, with control over the police and fire departments. In the same year, Hague cemented his control of the Hudson County political machine by securing for himself the leadership of the Hudson County Democratic Organization Executive Committee.  Hague immediately set about reshaping the corrupt Jersey City police force with tough Horsehoe recruits. Hague spearheaded crackdowns on prostitution and narcotics trafficking, earning him favor with religious leaders. These enforcement acts went as far as Hague himself marching across local Vaudeville stages personally directing the shut down of \\"girlie shows.\\" At the heart of this change was an inner cadre of officers known as the Zeppelin Squad or \\"zepps\\" who were personally loyal to Hague alone. The \\"zepps\\" would spy on, and report back to Hague about other members of the department. Eventually, Jersey City had one patrolman for every 3,000 residents, causing a marked decline in the city's once-astronomical crime rate.  Hague took steps to curb the police department's lackadaisical work ethic, punishing offenses that had gone unpunished for years. He also made much-needed improvements to the fire department; at the time he took office Jersey City's fire insurance rates were among the highest in the nation.  Upon discovering in early 1916 that millions of pounds of munitions were being stockpiled on the Jersey City waterfront, Hague travelled to Washington, D.C. to register concerns for the safety of his constituents. His meetings with Congressmen resulted in no action, Congress having decided that Jersey City was an \\"appropriate port.\\" Hague's concerns were shown to be valid in July 1916 when the Black Tom explosion sent shrapnel flying across the city.  In 1917, Hague, with his reputation as the man who cleaned up the police force, ran for reelection. He put together a commission ticket called \\"The Unbossed.\\" The ticket consisted of him, Parks Commissioner Moore, Revenue Commissioner George Brensinger, ex-judge Charles F.X. O'Brien and City Clerk Michael I. Fagan. It swept all five spots on the commission. Moore topped the poll, and traditional practice called for him to be appointed mayor. However, when the commission met for the first time on May 11, Hague was chosen as the new mayor. When did Hague become a commissioner?","output":"Hague became a commissioner in 1913 when he finished fourth with 17,390 votes in the first election for the city commission of Jersey City. He was elected to one of the five available seats on the commission. As the public safety commissioner, he gained control over the police and fire departments and went on to reshape the corrupt police force and make improvements to the fire department."},{"instruction":"Please answer the following question: Information:  - The Culture series is a science fiction series written by Scottish author Iain M.

Question: I have a test where I am given the following article, what is an answer for the question: What is the last name of the person who collaborated with Ono on Some Time? ?  Lennon and Ono moved to New York in August 1971 and immediately embraced US radical left politics. The couple released their \\"Happy Xmas (War Is Over)\\" single in December. During the new year, the Nixon administration took what it called a \\"strategic counter-measure\\" against Lennon's anti-war and anti-Nixon propaganda. The administration embarked on what would be a four-year attempt to deport him. Lennon was embroiled in a continuing legal battle with the immigration authorities, and he was denied permanent residency in the US; the issue would not be resolved until 1976.Some Time in New York City was recorded as a collaboration with Ono and was released in 1972 with backing from the New York band Elephant's Memory. A double LP, it contained songs about women's rights, race relations, Britain's role in Northern Ireland and Lennon's difficulties in obtaining a green card. The album was a commercial failure and was maligned by critics, who found its political sloganeering heavy-handed and relentless. The NME's review took the form of an open letter in which Tony Tyler derided Lennon as a \\"pathetic, ageing revolutionary\\". In the US, \\"Woman Is the Nigger of the World\\" was released as a single from the album and was televised on 11 May, on The Dick Cavett Show. Many radio stations refused to broadcast the song because of the word \\"nigger\\". Lennon and Ono gave two benefit concerts with Elephant's Memory and guests in New York in aid of patients at the Willowbrook State School mental facility. Staged at Madison Square Garden on 30 August 1972, they were his last full-length concert appearances. After George McGovern lost the 1972 presidential election to Richard Nixon, Lennon and Ono attended a post-election wake held in the New York home of activist Jerry Rubin. Lennon was depressed and got intoxicated; he left Ono embarrassed after he had sex with a female guest. Her song \\"Death of Samantha\\" was inspired by the incident.

Question: Who is the current governor of the state where Jones was born? Passage:Walter \\"Wiley\\" Jones was born in Madison County in northeastern Georgia, on July 14, 1848. His parents were George Jones, a white planter, and Jones' slave, Anne, who had six children by George Jones: Matthew (who superintended the construction of the Wiley Jones Street Car Line), Thomas, Julia (wife of Ben Reed), Wiley, Taylor, and James (who managed many of Wiley's businesses). Wiley received his nickname because of his mischievous nature. At the age of five, he moved to Arkansas with his master and more than forty fellow slaves. They settled on the Governor Byrd plantation. George Jones died in 1858. Anne was called his wife in an 1889 biography of Jones, and she believed that George had promised to free herself and her children upon his death, but no manumission papers were found, and the family was kept as slaves and sold by the estate administer, Peter Finerty, to James Yell, a lawyer and planter in Pine Bluff. Jones worked as a houseboy and carriage driver for his new master. When Jones was ten, he was given to Yell's only son, Fountain Pitts Yell, on the occasion of Pitts Yell's marriage. Pitts was a state representative from 1860 to 1861. During the American Civil War, James Yell became a Major General of the Arkansas State Militia, and Pitts became a colonel in Company S of the 26th Arkansas Infantry Regiment in the Confederate Army. James Yell's was transferred to the Confederate States Army in the summer of 1861, and James left the service and moved to Texas. Jones served for Pitts during the war until Pitts' death in 1864 at the Battle of Pleasant Hill in Louisiana. Jones then joined James Yell and his family in Waco, Texas. There, he served as a porter in a mercantile house for one year. He was then hired to drive a wagon carrying cotton on a route along the Brazos River to San Antonio.  Links: a. Texas b.

It is presented with two values: 1. Without battery recharging: When the module is not recharging a battery, the consumption in the idle state is 10 milliamperes (mA). This indicates that the module requires minimal power to maintain its functionality without draining too much energy when it is not in active use. 2. With battery recharging: When the module is also recharging a battery, the consumption in the idle state increases to 60 milliamperes (mA). This increased consumption is due to the additional power required to recharge the battery while maintaining basic functionality of the module. It is important to note that energy consumption will likely be much higher when the module is actively being used and recharging a battery simultaneously. In summary, the module has different consumption levels in its idle state depending on whether it is recharging a battery or not. Without battery recharging, the consumption is a modest 10mA, while it increases to 60mA when recharging is taking place."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant that follows instruction extremely well.

He has two older sisters, LaDonna, the eldest, and Lacey. Phillips grew up in Sasser and Leesburg, and attended Lee County High School. He graduated from Albany Technical College with a major in Industrial Systems Technology, but missed the graduation ceremony due to his obligations to American Idol. Phillips auditioned in Savannah, Georgia. He sang \\"Superstition\\" by Stevie Wonder. The judges then asked him to perform a second song with his guitar, and he performed Michael Jackson's \\"Thriller.\\" He advanced to the Hollywood rounds, and later to the Las Vegas round. On February 23, 2012, Phillips was chosen as one of the Top 25 semi-finalists, and was then voted into the Top 13.  His performance style on the show has been compared to Dave Matthews, and he covered one of his songs, \\"The Stone,\\" in the competition. When asked about Phillips' imitation of his style, Dave Matthews said: \\"More power to him, I don't mind,\\" and added \\"He should kick my ass, [then] maybe I can retire and he can take over my band.\\" Mentor Stevie Nicks said Phillips would have been good enough to join Fleetwood Mac back in 1975, after his performance of Jonny Lang's Still Rainin, which he received a standing ovation from the judges.  After the Top 13 performance night, Phillips was taken to a doctor for possible kidney stones. He had eight procedures while he was on Idol, and considered quitting the show due to the pain.  For his Top 3 performance, Phillips sang Bob Seger's \\"We've Got Tonight.\\" For Top 4, he did a cover of Damien Rice's Volcano - which has been heralded as one of the best American Idol performances of all time. As the sole contestant who was never in jeopardy of elimination in any week of the competition, Phillips became the winner on the finale against Jessica Sanchez after a record-breaking 132 million votes were cast.

Even in a full immersion environment you're likely to make mistakes, mistakes will cause misinterpretation, which will be uncomfortable, which will cause what?, Options: - better communication - overthinking - frustration - misunderstandings - headaches  The answer is \\"frustration\\" because The answer is:","output":"\\"frustration\\" because learning languages is indeed a complex and challenging task, one that requires time, patience, and perseverance. Even in a full immersion environment where learners are constantly exposed to the target language, mistakes are inevitable, given the intricate nature of languages and the learning curve associated with their acquisition. When making mistakes while learning a language, there is always the possibility that these errors will lead to misinterpretation. These misunderstandings could range from minor inaccuracies to significant miscommunication, ultimately causing the individual to feel uncomfortable or embarrassed. This discomfort, in turn, has the potential to generate frustration. The feeling of frustration arises due to the gap between one's expectations and reality. In the context of language learning, individuals may feel overwhelmed and disheartened by the difficulties they encounter while trying to express themselves accurately or understand others in a foreign language, particularly when they have committed considerable time and effort to overcoming these challenges. Moreover, the frustration may be further exacerbated when it impacts an individual's confidence levels in social settings or professional environments. They may feel inadequate when they cannot communicate effectively or comprehend others, feeling excluded from conversations or even hindered in their career progression. It is important to note, however, that frustration is a natural and common part of the language learning process. By acknowledging and addressing it constructively, language learners can turn frustration into motivation and resilience. They can utilize the experience of making mistakes to identify areas of improvement, seek feedback, and engage in more focused practice. In contrast, the other options provided in the original question - better communication, overthinking, misunderstandings, and headaches - do not accurately capture the emotional consequences that stem from the discomfort caused by making mistakes in a full immersion language learning environment. Better communication, while a goal of language learning, is an outcome that can be hindered by mistakes and misinterpretation rather than being a direct consequence of them. Overthinking might be related to the learning process, but it is not the primary emotional outcome of experiencing mistakes and misunderstanding. Misunderstandings are the result of errors and misinterpretation, but they are not an emotional consequence by themselves. Lastly, headaches might occur as a physical manifestation of stress experienced during language learning, but they are not specific enough to be considered the primary emotional response to the mentioned situation. In conclusion, \\"frustration\\" is indeed the most suitable answer, as it accurately reflects the emotional impact of making mistakes and facing misinterpretations while learning a language in a full immersion environment. Despite this, it is crucial for individuals to harness this frustration and turn it into a driving force for improvement, continually working on their language skills and developing strategies to overcome the challenges associated with language acquisition."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Sample A contains gas particles, but sample B does not contain gas particles.  In which sample the momentum would not be conserved, sample A or sample B?  Hint: Another thing we can see in this animation is that particles are constantly colliding with one another. One assumption that we make when talking about collisions between gas particles is that they are completely elastic collisions. In an elastic collision , momentum is conserved, which means that none of the kinetic energy of the colliding particles is lost in some other form (such as the emission of light). This makes sense, because if energy were lost in collisions, the speeds of the particles would gradually decrease over time, and eventually everything would condense down into a solid form. Answer:","output":"Based on the hint provided, momentum is conserved in elastic collisions which occur among gas particles. Since sample A contains gas particles, we can assume that collisions in sample A are elastic and conserve momentum. On the other hand, sample B does not contain gas particles, so it is more likely that collisions within sample B may not be elastic and therefore may not conserve momentum.

When the fake assassination attempt crosses paths with the real one, police officers Monica and Walter are called out to the resulting disturbance. Eliot Arnold, Matt's father, who was contacted by Matt's friend, Andrew, immediately feels a mutual attraction to Anne Herk (Jenny's mother), as Matt and Jenny begin to feel attracted to each other as well. The Herks' Mexican housemaid Nina, meanwhile, falls in love with a young man named Puggy, who lives in a tree on their property, after she runs from the shootings and he saves her from the hitmen.Realizing that he is the intended victim, Arthur visits arms dealers, for a weapon, but ends up with suitcase nuclear bomb. Escaped convicts Snake and Eddie, who were previously kicked out of a bar called the Jolly Jackal for disorderly conduct, hold up the bar and kidnap Arthur and Puggy (who is an employee there) for the suitcase, not knowing its contents.Meanwhile, Matt tries to \\"kill\\" Jenny in a mall parking lot, but a security guard thinks that Matt's gun is real. After the guard opens fire on them, Matt and Jenny run to the Herk house, followed by Monica and Walter, who stumble across the confusion. Eliot is called over as well.The convicts force Arthur to return to his home, where they capture everyone and tie them up. Taking Puggy and kidnapping Jenny, they leave (with the suitcase) for the Airport. Nina, who was hiding in her room, frees everyone except for Monica and Arthur (who were handcuffed to a heavy brass etagere). Shortly after, the house is visited by two FBI agents who are tracking the bomb. They free Monica and have her lead them to the airport (leaving Arthur, as he was poisoned by a hallucinogenic toad, causing him to think that his dog is possessed by Martha...

A:","output":"The last step of the process would be the bat's brain interpreting the information received from the echoes to determine the location, distance, shape, and size of the object, which further helps the bat to navigate, avoid obstacles, and locate food sources in its environment. This entire process is known as echolocation. In more detail, the bat's brain processes the sound waves it receives by analyzing the difference in time between the emission of the call and the arrival of the echo, as well as the frequency shift and intensity variation of the echo. This enables the bat to estimate the distance, velocity, and direction of the nearby object. For example, if the echo takes a longer time to return or has lower intensity, it indicates that the object is further away, whereas a shorter time and higher intensity suggest a closer proximity. Moreover, the bat's brain can also compare the input from both ears to triangulate the precise location of the object, taking advantage of the differences in the arrival time and intensity of the echoes at each ear. If the echo arrives earlier in one ear, the object is more likely to be in that direction. Bats can also identify the texture and shape of the object based on the composition, pattern, and distribution of the returning echoes. Objects with different shapes, sizes, or surfaces will produce unique echo signatures that can help the bat recognize the nature of these objects, be it a nearby tree, an insect, or a predator. In summary, the last step of the echolocation process is the brain's interpretation of the information received from the echoes to accurately perceive and navigate the bat's surroundings, avoid obstacles, and locate food sources. This demonstrates the remarkable adaptation and capability of bats in their quest for survival in a diverse range of environments."},{"instruction":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

The answer you provided talks about which Greek people were a part of the population exchange. Let me help you understand this better. Demotic speaking Greek refugees were moved mainly to Greece. They were a part of a big event called the \\"population exchange\\" between Greece and Turkey in the early 1920s. Many people from Greece, who followed the Greek Orthodox religion, went to live in Greece, while many people from Turkey, who followed Islam, went to live in Turkey.

But, not for very long! My apologies as I need to give a little back story first. Please bear with. I first came to the DC/NOVA area via the US Army. It had a very small town feel. I was amazed no traffic, extremely affordable housing market, friendly, helpful and caring people and trees as far as the eyes could see. It was top 3 places I had lived in this country. After the Tech boom peaked near 2000 and after 9/11 the flood gates opened and people spilled in from all over the Earth for the bountiful opportunities. The housing market skyrocketed and people were tripling++ the values of their homes. It is now home to some of the wealthiest counties in the US. Why is this all relevant? All the prosperity brought greed, selfishness and gluttony to a whole new level. People had massive disposable income they had never had before. Nothing is too grossly indulgent anymore and they throw away vast amounts of money trying to one up the last kids party without giving a thought to what a kid needs or the fact they are teaching kids that over indulgence is okay. Now, my son and I were invited to a birthday party for this FIVE year old. The sole Parent had rented the club house, surrounding grounds and pool area of a local country club. I would estimate around 30 kids x 1.5 adults. It was catered with both adult and children's foods and beverages, including Wine and Champagne (few here seem able or willing to parent without it). A company was hired to bring in 6 industrial fair/carnival type rides. A mini Ferris Wheel and a mini Roller Coaster included. She even had hired help that distributed Party Bags/Swag Bags that included cologne/perfume for the kids. I don't think my jaw closed the entire time we were there. This was for a FIVE year old! Could you believe she talks about the daughters poor behavior frequently? My Son asked to leave after around 20 mins, Question: When did the narrator first come to the DC/NOVA area?

Question: Is not necessarily worth two of anything, anywhere else. But it can certainly be a heck of a lot of fun. During my days as an inmate in Bridges House at the University of New Brunswick, I shared this space with about 99 other testosterone-addled 'young adults' whose charming tendency to get completely out of hand was barely held in check by the rod of authority of the Don and Resident Fellow. This is not to say that these two worthies weren't good at their jobs; more accurately, their task was more akin to herding cats -- fairly obtuse, barely socialized cats. Given the state of controlled chaos that existed, it wasn't unusual for little conflicts to arise from time to time. Being rather physically small and odd, I came in for a certain amount of abuse from someone called Scut, a large and obnoxious Newfie (hmmm, that's like saying that water is wet). I can't remember what it was he did to me, but it was serious enough that I decided to get my own back. It's been said that revenge is a dish best enjoyed cold. I think revenge is a dish best enjoyed in secret with no chance of counter-revenge to spoil the occasion. And so it was that I laid my plans against Scut. The occasion and place were set. My means of entry was secured. Now I needed material. For me, the only good fish is a live one. Even though I hale from NB, I really don't like free-swimming seafood. Considering the unimaginative cuisine of my youth, it's surprising that I eat anything at all. So with dead, smelly fish in mind, I persuaded my friend Shan to pick one up when he was down at the Saturday Farmer's Market. He returned with a four-pound shad, frozen solid. Shad has even more bones than other fish and you'll never see it featured on any cooking show (except maybe Iron Chef, where the disgusting and unusual seems to be standard). It took me all day to thaw out the fish in the lounge sink?#8364;?an activity which elicited howls of complaint from the guys trying to watch TV.

Think like you are answering to a five year old. Answer by taking a quote from the following article: Keith was born in Clinton, Oklahoma, to Carolyn Joan (nee Ross) and Hubert K. Covel, Jr. and is of English ancestry. He has a sister and a brother. The family lived in Fort Smith, Arkansas, for a few years when Keith was in grade school, but moved to Moore, Oklahoma (a suburb of Oklahoma City) when he was still young. Before the family moved to Moore, he visited his grandmother in Fort Smith during the summers. Keith had a public feud with the Dixie Chicks over the song \\"Courtesy of the Red, White, & Blue\\", in 2003 as well as over comments they made about President George W. Bush on stage during a concert in London. The lead singer of the Dixie Chicks, Natalie Maines, publicly stated that Keith's song was \\"ignorant, and it makes country music sound ignorant\\". Keith responded by pointing out that Maines did not write her music and he does, and by displaying a backdrop at his concerts showing a doctored photo of Maines with Iraqi dictator Saddam Hussein. On May 21, 2003, Maines wore a T-shirt with the letters \\"FUTK\\" on the front at the Academy of Country Music Awards. While a spokesperson for the Dixie Chicks said that the acronym stood for \\"Friends United in Truth and Kindness,\\" many, including host Vince Gill, took it to be a shot at Keith (\\"Fuck You Toby Keith\\"). In an October 2004 appearance on Real Time with Bill Maher, Maines finally confessed that it was indeed a shot at Keith, and that she \\"thought that nobody would get it\\".  In August 2003, Keith's representation publicly declared he was done feuding with Maines \\"because he's realized there are far more important things to concentrate on\\". Keith was referring specifically to the terminal illness of a former bandmate's daughter, Allison Faith Webb. However, he continues to refuse to say Maines' name, and claims that the doctored photo was intended to express his opinion that Maines' criticism was an attempt to squelch Keith's free speech.  In April 2008, a commercial spot to promote Al Gore's \\"We Campaign\\", involving both Keith and the Dixie Chicks, was proposed. However, the idea was eventually abandoned due to scheduling conflicts. What was his response to Natalie Maines's comment?","output":"Toby Keith responded to Natalie Maines's comment by saying that she did not write her music while he does, and by showing a photo of her with Saddam Hussein at his concerts."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant that follows instruction extremely well. Help as much as you can. Question: Matt and his brother Jesse are twins. They look almost identical. If it weren't for the fact that Jesse has a slightly darker skin complexion you wouldn't be able to tell them apart. In fact one year Matt was out in the sun for a long time and picked up a bit of a tan so they actually did look exactly alike.  Which persons melanocytes produce more melanin, Matt or Jesse?  Hint: The epidermis also contains melanocytes , which are cells that produce melanin. Melanin is the brownish pigment that gives skin much of its color. Everyone has about the same number of melanocytes, but the melanocytes of people with darker skin produce more melanin. The amount of melanin produced is determined by heredity and exposure to UV light, which increases melanin output. Exposure to UV light also stimulates the skin to produce vitamin D . Because melanin blocks UV light from penetrating the skin, people with darker skin may be at greater risk of vitamin D deficiency.

Field Marshal Sir Claude John Eyre Auchinleck  (21 June 1884 - 23 March 1981) was a British Army commander during the Second World War. He was a career soldier who spent much of his military career in India, where he rose to become Commander-in-Chief of the Indian Army by early 1941. In July 1941 he was appointed Commander-in-Chief of the Middle East theatre, but after initial successes the war in North Africa turned against the British, and he was relieved of the post in 1942 during the crucial Alamein campaign. In June 1943 he was once more appointed Commander-in-Chief, India, where his support through the organisation of supply, maintenance and training for Slim's Fourteenth Army played an important role in its success. Auchinleck continued as Commander-in-Chief of the Indian Army after the end of the war helping, though much against his own convictions, to prepare the future Indian and Pakistani armies for the Partition of India: in November 1945 he was forced to commute the more serious judicial sentences awarded against officers of the Indian National Army in face of growing unease and unrest both within the Indian population, and the British Indian Army. On 1 June 1946 he was promoted to field marshal, but he refused to accept a peerage, lest he be thought associated with a policy (i.e. Partition) that he thought fundamentally dishonourable.  Sending a report to British Government on 28 September 1947 Auchinleck wrote: \\"I have no hesitation, whatever, in affirming that the present Indian Cabinet are implacably determined to do all in their power to prevent the establishment of the Dominion of Pakistan on firm basis.\\" He stated in the second, political part of his assessment, \\"Since 15th August, the situation has steadily deteriorated and the Indian leaders, cabinet ministers, civil officials and others have persistently tried to obstruct the work of partition of the armed forces.\\"  When partition was effected in August 1947, Auchinleck was appointed Supreme Commander of all British forces remaining in India and Pakistan and remained in this role until the winding up and closure of the Supreme H.Q. at the end of November 1948. This marked his effective retirement from the army (although technically field marshals in the British Army never retire, remaining on the active list on half pay). He left India on 1 December.  After a brief period in Italy in connection with an unsuccessful business project, Auchinleck retired to London, where he occupied himself with a number of charitable and business interests and became a respectably skilled watercolour painter. In 1960 he settled in Beccles in the county of Suffolk, remaining there for seven years until, at the age of eighty-four, he decided to emigrate and set up home in Marrakesh, where he died on 23 March 1981.

One of them was glace fruit. He showed the class how to prepare glace fruit and kept some of the glace fruits on bowl A. To compare glace fruits with non glace fruits he kept some non glace fruits on bowl B.  Given the paragraph above, please answer correctly the following question:   Which fruits had most probably gone through heated sugar syrup, bowl A or bowl B?  Hint: Candied fruit, also known as crystallized fruit or glacé fruit, has existed since the 14th century. Whole fruit, smaller pieces of fruit, or pieces of peel, are placed in heated sugar syrup, which absorbs the moisture from within the fruit and eventually preserves it. Depending on size and type of fruit, this process of preservation can take from several days to several months.[1] This process allows the fruit to retain its quality for a year.[2]  The continual process of drenching the fruit in syrup causes the fruit to become saturated with sugar, preventing the growth of spoilage microorganisms due to the unfavourable osmotic pressure this creates.[3] Answer:","output":"Bowl A"},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Both sentences state that David Burliuk was born on March 15, 1886, in Kharkiv and indicate that he is the younger brother of Wladimir Burliuk. However, the sentences are structured differently.  The first sentence begins by providing David Burliuk's birth date and then emphasizes his relation to Wladimir Burliuk. This arrangement establishes a connection between the two important pieces of information: the birth date and the sibling relationship. While the date of birth is given prominence, the relationship between the two brothers is used to build on the main subject of the sentence, David Burliuk. On the other hand, the second sentence starts with David Burliuk's name and then combines both his birth date and his sibling relationship sequentially. Here, the focus remains on David Burliuk, and the additional information about his brother and birth date follows in the same sentence. Overall, both sentences effectively convey the same meaning regarding David Burliuk. The primary difference between the two lies in the sentence structure and the way the information is presented.

Most people want to be happy but few know how to find happiness. Money and success don't bring lasting happiness. Happiness depends on ourselves. In other words, we make our own happiness. Some people believe that if they are _ , they will be able to do anything they want, which means happiness. On the other hand, some people believe that holding a high position in the government is happiness. In this way, you have not only money, but also many other things which can't be bought by money. However, other people believe that having lots of money is not happiness, nor is holding a high position in the government. These people value  their beliefs, or their intelligence, or their health. They think these can make them happy. Here are a few ways to help you be happier. The first secret of happiness is to enjoy the simple things in life. Too often, we spend so much time thinking about the future, for example, getting into college or getting a good job, that we don't enjoy the present. You should enjoy life's simple pleasures, such as reading a good book, listening to your favorite music, or spending time with close friends. People who have close friends usually enjoy happier and healthier lives. The second secret of happiness is to be active. Many people go dancing or play sports. People can forget about their problems and only think about the activities. Finally, many people find happiness in helping others. According to studies, people feel good when they volunteer their time to do many meaningful things for other people. If you want to feel happier, do something nice for someone. You can help a friend with his or her studies, go shopping to get food for an old neighbor, or simply help around the house. Now maybe you know how to find happiness!

Please answer the following question: I can use this background: Genetically modified organisms (GMO) are organisms whose genetic material has been altered by genetic engineering techniques generally known as recombinant DNA technology. Genetic engineering has expanded the genes available to breeders to utilize in creating desired germlines for new crops. Increased durability, nutritional content, insect and virus resistance and herbicide tolerance are a few of the attributes bred into crops through genetic engineering. For some, GMO crops cause food safety and food labeling concerns. Numerous countries have placed restrictions on the production, import or use of GMO foods and crops. Currently a global treaty, the Biosafety Protocol, regulates the trade of GMOs. There is ongoing discussion regarding the labeling of foods made from GMOs, and while the EU currently requires all GMO foods to be labeled, the US does not.Herbicide-resistant seed has a gene implanted into its genome that allows the plants to tolerate exposure to herbicides, including glyphosate. These seeds allow the farmer to grow a crop that can be sprayed with herbicides to control weeds without harming the resistant crop. Herbicide-tolerant crops are used by farmers worldwide. With the increasing use of herbicide-tolerant crops, comes an increase in the use of glyphosate-based herbicide sprays. In some areas glyphosate resistant weeds have developed, causing farmers to switch to other herbicides. Some studies also link widespread glyphosate usage to iron deficiencies in some crops, which is both a crop production and a nutritional quality concern, with potential economic and health implications.Other GMO crops used by growers include insect-resistant crops, which have a gene from the soil bacterium Bacillus thuringiensis (Bt), which produces a toxin specific to insects. These crops resist damage by insects. Some believe that similar or better pest-resistance traits can be acquired through traditional breeding practices, and resistance to various pests can be gained through hybridization or cross-pollination...  Now, I have a new situation: PepsiCo has been supplying GMO potato seeds to farmers. Eventually, they buy the potatoes for their chips. On the other hand, Kettle Foods supplied non-GMO potato seeds to their farmers. They wanted to see how customers react to their non-GMO products, mostly chips.  Answer this question please: Would PepsiCo potatoes be less or more herbicide tolerant than Kettle Foods'? A:","output":"Based on the background information provided, GMO crops, such as those supplied by PepsiCo, have been engineered with a gene that allows them to tolerate exposure to herbicides. In comparison, Kettle Foods supplies non-GMO potato seeds to their farmers, which means these potatoes have not been genetically modified for herbicide tolerance. Considering this, PepsiCo's GMO potatoes would be more herbicide tolerant than Kettle Foods' non-GMO potatoes."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant that follows instruction extremely well.

Police captain Bezu Fache (Jean Reno) summons American symbologist Robert Langdon (Tom Hanks) to examine SauniÃ¨reâs body. Langdon discovers a message hidden by blacklight which contains an out of order Fibonacci number sequence. A police cryptographer and SauniÃ¨reâs granddaughter, Sophie Neveu (Audrey Tautou), reveals to Langdon that Fache planted a tracker on him, believing he murdered SauniÃ¨re due to a message to find him, erased by Fache.

Answer:","output":"Based on the hints provided by your teacher, the best answer to the question \\"Fertilization of gametes products something that becomes what?\\" would be (ii) Embryo. When fertilization occurs, male and female gametes (sperm and egg cells) come together to form a single cell – a zygote. The zygote is diploid, meaning it contains both sets of chromosomes from the two parent gametes. This is a crucial stage in sexual reproduction, as it ensures the offspring inherit genetic material from both parents, resulting in genetic diversity within the species. Once fertilization is successful, and the zygote is formed, it undergoes a series of cell divisions through a process called mitosis. During mitosis, the zygote's diploid cells replicate and divide, forming a multicellular organism known as an embryo. The embryo will continue to grow and develop into a new individual organism. To recap, the process of fertilization involves the union of male and female gametes to produce a diploid zygote. The zygote then undergoes cell division and develops into an embryo, which is why the best answer to the quiz question is (ii) Embryo."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant that follows instruction extremely well.

When Louise goes below deck, a large, strange cloud on the horizon passes over the craft, leaving a reflective mist on Scott's bare skin. The couple are puzzled by the phenomenon, which disappears as quickly as it had shown up. However, one morning six months later, Scott, who is 6Â ft 1Â in (1.85Â m) tall and 190 pounds (86Â kg), notices that his shirt and slacks seem to be too big, but blames it on the laundry service. As this trend continues, he believes he is shrinking and sees his physician, Dr. Bramson (William Schallert), who reassures him that he is in perfect health and that \\"people just don't get shorter.\\" Louise also dismisses his fears as silly, stating that he has simply been losing weight, but he continues to lose height and weight. His wedding ring falls off his finger. Louise becomes concerned when Scott points out that she no longer needs to stand on tiptoe to kiss him. Finally, there is x-ray proof that Scott is getting smaller. His doctor refers him to the prominent laboratory, the California Medical Research Institute, and after nearly three weeks of sophisticated tests, Scott and his team of new doctors learn that the mist to which he was exposed was radioactive. This, combined with an accidental exposure to a large amount of common insecticide four months later, has set off a chain reaction that has rearranged Scott's molecular structure, causing his cells to shrink. Scott continues to shrink proportionately. His story hits the headlines, and he becomes a national curiosity. He can no longer drive a car and has to give up his job working for his brother, Charlie (Paul Langton), who encourages him to make some money off his story by selling it to the national press. He begins keeping a journal, to be published as a record of his experiences. As things continue, Scott feels humiliated and expresses his shame by lashing out at Louise, who is reduced to... Answer:","output":"Considering the movie plot provided, a possible question could be: How does Scott Carey's life changes and the challenges he faces as a result of his continuous shrinking, and can he find a way to reverse the process or adapt to this new reality? In the movie, the protagonist, Scott Carey, experiences a life-altering event when he notices continuous shrinking in his size. Initially dismissed by others, he seeks medical help, and after multiple tests, he discovers that due to a rare combination of radioactive mist and exposure to insecticide, his molecular structure has been altered, causing him to shrink proportionally. As Scott's size keeps decreasing, various challenges arise in his life, which begs the question of how he deals with these changes. Initially, Scott struggles with simple daily tasks like driving a car and has to abandon his job. He becomes a national curiosity, garnering attention from the media. This attention, while giving him an opportunity to make money from his story, also adds to his feelings of humiliation and vulnerability. The shrinking process not only affects his physical attributes but has a psychological impact, causing distress and frustration that strains his relationship with his wife, Louise. As the story unfolds, the audience would be curious about how Scott comes to terms with his new reality. Can he find a way to reverse or stop the shrinking process with the help of medical research? Alternatively, does he need to adapt to his ever-changing life and find new ways to survive in a world not designed for someone of his size? Also, how does his relationship with Louise evolve, and can they overcome the challenges his condition brings into their lives? Exploring these themes, the movie would depict the challenges and emotional journey that both Scott and Louise face while dealing with the unique situation of Scott's uncontrollable shrinking, ultimately revealing how they tackle the obstacles and evolve as individuals and as a couple."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

The area of land that is flooded is called the floodplain. The floodplain may be very wide where the river flows over a nearly flat surface.   Q: At certain times of year, a stream or river may overflow its banks. what is the area of land that is flooded called?   Choices:  - inlet  - run off  - lowland  - floodplain  A: The answer is:","output":"floodplain. The paragraph provided states that at certain times of year, a stream or river may overflow its banks, causing the land to be flooded. This area of land that becomes flooded is referred to as the floodplain. It further explains that the floodplain may be very wide where the river flows over a nearly flat surface. To provide more context and better understanding, let's briefly go over the other options and why they are not correct: 1. Inlet: An inlet is a narrow body of water that extends into the land from a larger body of water, such as a sea, lake, or another river. It does not have any direct connection to the overflowing of riverbanks or the creation of floodplains. 2. Runoff: Runoff refers to the water that flows over the land surface, typically after rainfall, snowmelt, or other types of precipitation. When the ground becomes saturated or is unable to absorb more water, the excess water becomes runoff. Although runoff may contribute to flooding in certain situations, it does not specifically describe the area of land that is flooded. 3. Lowland: Lowland is a geographical term that refers to an area of land that has a relatively low elevation compared to the surrounding regions. While low-lying areas can be more susceptible to flooding, the term itself does not specifically describe the area of land that becomes flooded due to an overflowing river or stream. In summary, the correct answer to the question is floodplain, as it best defines the area of land that becomes flooded when a river or stream overflows its banks."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Interested in sports and athletically inclined from a young age, Thompson co-founded the Hawks Athletic Club while attending I.N. Bloom Elementary School, which led to an invitation to join Louisville's Castlewood Athletic Club, a club for adolescents that prepared them for high-school sports. Ultimately he never joined any sports teams in high school. Thompson attended I.N. Bloom Elementary School, Highland Middle School, and Atherton High School, before transferring to Louisville Male High School in September 1952. Also in 1952, he was accepted as a member of the Athenaeum Literary Association, a school-sponsored literary and social club that dated to 1862. Its members at the time, generally drawn from Louisville's wealthy upper-class families, included Porter Bibb, who later became the first publisher of Rolling Stone at Thompson's behest. During this time Thompson read and admired J. P. Donleavy's The Ginger Man. As an Athenaeum member, Thompson contributed articles to and helped produce the club's yearbook The Spectator. The group ejected Thompson in 1955, citing his legal problems. Charged as an accessory to robbery after being in a car with the perpetrator, Thompson was sentenced to 60 days in Kentucky's Jefferson County Jail. He served 31 days and, a week after his release, enlisted in the United States Air Force. While he was in jail, the school superintendent refused him permission to take his high-school final examinations, and as a result he did not graduate. Answer this question based on the article: How many fewer days was Thompson in jail than his original sentence?","output":"Thompson's original jail sentence was 60 days, but he served only 31 days. Therefore, to find out how many fewer days he spent in jail than he was originally sentenced, the calculation would be: 60 (original sentence length) - 31 (actual time served) = 29 Thus, Thompson served 29 fewer days in jail than his original sentence."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

The Dark Knight and Man of Steel delivered a box office beatdown yet again.      Batman v Superman: Dawn of Justice is No. 1 for a second straight week with 52.4 million, according to estimates from tracking service comScore. The DC Comics film, which pits the Caped Crusader (Ben Affleck) against the Last Son of Krypton (Henry Cavill), has earned 261.5 million in just 10 days.      The superhero face-off dominated despite negative reviews (29% critical approval on aggregate site RottenTomatoes.com) and a massive drop of 68% from its first weekend, when it opened to a record-shattering 166 million.      \\"It is a pretty significant drop, but this was expected,\\" says Paul Dergarabedian, senior media analyst for comScore. With more than 681 million worldwide, \\"you have to consider it a box office winner, but on the critical front, it took a pretty hard beating. This was the poster child for that disconnect between critics and fans,\\" who gave it a B grade on CinemaScore.      Batman v Superman is Zack Snyder's follow-up to 2013's Man of Steel. It co-stars Amy Adams, Jesse Eisenberg and Gal Gadot as Wonder Woman, the female superhero's first live-action feature-film appearance in her 75-year history. The blockbuster carries a hefty price tag of 250 million.      In second place, Zootopia dropped just 17% in its fifth weekend to earn 20 million. The critically adored comedy has now made 275.9 million in North America and a staggering 787.6 million globally, making it Disney's biggest animated success since 2013's Frozen (which scorched the box office with nearly 1.3 billion worldwide).      Nia Vardalos' My Big Fat Greek Wedding 2 held strong with 11.1 million and third place in its second weekend, which brings its total to 36.5 million. The comedy arrives more than a decade after its predecessor, which sprinted down the aisle in 2002 with 241.4 million in North America.      God's Not Dead 2 managed just 8.1 million for fourth place in 2,400 theaters. The faith-based film is a sequel to the 2014 hit. Rounding out the top five, Miracles From Heaven continued to bless the box office with 7.6 million in its third weekend, dropping only 22%. The Christian drama, starring Jennifer Garner and Queen Latifah, has now earned 46.8 million.      \\"For that film to be doing this well is a testament to how loyal and passionate the faith-based audience is,\\" Dergarabedian says. \\"Closing in on 50 million, it's a total moneymaking machine.\\"      In limited release, Richard Linklater's Everybody Wants Some!!, a \\"spiritual sequel\\" to Dazed and Confused, scored a solid 323,000 in just 19 theaters (371,000 since opening Wednesday).

Tom Cruise, the charismatic actor who has been delighting audiences for decades, is one such exceptional talent. With an eclectic filmography that spans multiple genres, Cruise has continually pushed himself towards surprising and memorable roles in blockbuster films. His latest role, in the remake of The Mummy, has produced yet another indelible performance - and an unexpected, yet highly catchy ringtone as well. The Movie: The Mummy (2017) A reboot of the classic Mummy films, 2017's The Mummy featured Cruise as Nick Morton, a US Army sergeant with a penchant for treasure hunting and finding himself in precarious situations. In this action-packed film, Cruise's character discovers an ancient tomb housing the remains of Princess Ahmanet, an Egyptian princess buried alive for her forbidden love. Upon opening the tomb, Morton unleashes a curse that brings about the resurrection of the princess, setting off a chain of catastrophic events. As Cruise navigates the thrilling and terrifying world of ancient curses, grave-robbing, and supernatural threats, it's not surprising he had to let out a few blood-curdling screams as part of his performance. Tom Cruise's Scream: The Unexpected Ringtone In one particularly harrowing scene, Tom Cruise's character finds himself caught in a zero-gravity plane crash. As the aircraft spirals out of control, Cruise releases an impressively sustained, spine-chilling scream that reverberates through the chaotic sequence. Unbeknownst to him at the time, this guttural display of terror would become one of the film's lasting legacies. Though the film received mixed reviews, Cruise's scream gained immense popularity on social media, taking on a life of its own. Fans saw it as an opportunity to inject a little fun into their everyday lives, with his scream ultimately being turned into a ringtone. This unexpected development speaks not only to the power of Cruise's performance but also to the golden age of technology where everything is at the tip of our collective interconnected fingers. Why the Tom Cruise Scream Ringtone Went Viral First and foremost, the sheer intensity and undeniable authenticity of Cruise's scream resonated with many viewers. While some might argue that the scream's popularity is due to the comedic irony of having such an iconic actor turn into a symbol of abject terror, the genuine emotion behind the scream cannot be denied. Secondly, the ubiquity of smartphones and the rise of social media platforms have made it easier for fans to dissect, discuss, and share interesting and resonant moments from films with their wider circles. Tom Cruise's scream, for example, was quickly turned into memes, video clips, and of course, a ringtone by fans across the globe eager to share this momentous performance with one another. Lastly, the fact that a universally recognized figure like Tom Cruise could showcase such vulnerability onscreen struck a chord with many fans. In a world where people are constantly under pressure to maintain a facade of stoic bravery, Cruise's scream offered a fleeting moment of release and validation. Choosing to use this scream as a personalized ringtone is, in some ways, reclaiming that release and commemorating the very human aspect of vulnerability. Conclusion In a strange twist of fate, Tom Cruise's screams from his 2017 film, The Mummy, have been captured and immortalized as a ringtone. This reflects not only the influence of social media and digital technology on our lives but also highlights the power of an honest and evocative performance. While it may not have been the desired outcome for the filmmakers, this unique phenomenon stands as a testament to Cruise's magnetism and the lasting impact that his performances can have on audiences."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

As the only child of well-to-do parents living in the San Remo on Central Park West, he was described in Meryle Secrest's biography (Stephen Sondheim: A Life) as an isolated, emotionally-neglected child. When he lived in New York, Sondheim attended ECFS, the Ethical Culture Fieldston School known simply as \\"Fieldston.\\" He later attended the New York Military Academy and George School, a private Quaker preparatory school in Bucks County, Pennsylvania where he wrote his first musical, By George, and from which he graduated in 1946. Sondheim spent several summers at Camp Androscoggin. He later matriculated to Williams College and graduated in 1950.  He traces his interest in theatre to Very Warm for May, a Broadway musical he saw when he was nine. \\"The curtain went up and revealed a piano,\\" Sondheim recalled. \\"A butler took a duster and brushed it up, tinkling the keys. I thought that was thrilling.\\"  When Sondheim was ten, his father (already a distant figure) left his mother for another woman (Alicia, with whom he had two sons). Herbert sought custody of Stephen but was unsuccessful. Sondheim explained to biographer Secrest that he was \\"what they call an institutionalized child, meaning one who has no contact with any kind of family. You're in, though it's luxurious, you're in an environment that supplies you with everything but human contact. No brothers and sisters, no parents, and yet plenty to eat, and friends to play with and a warm bed, you know?\\"  Sondheim detested his mother, who was said to be psychologically abusive and projected her anger from her failed marriage on her son: \\"When my father left her, she substituted me for him. And she used me the way she used him, to come on to and to berate, beat up on, you see. What she did for five years was treat me like dirt, but come on to me at the same time.\\" She once wrote him a letter saying that the \\"only regret [she] ever had was giving him birth.\\" When his mother died in the spring of 1992, Sondheim did not attend her funeral and had already been estranged from her for nearly 20 years at that point.  Burt Shevelove invited Sondheim to a party; Sondheim arrived before him, and knew no one else well. He saw a familiar face: Arthur Laurents, who had seen one of the auditions of Saturday Night, and they began talking. Laurents told him he was working on a musical version of Romeo and Juliet with Leonard Bernstein, but they needed a lyricist; Betty Comden and Adolph Green, who were supposed to write the lyrics, were under contract in Hollywood. He said that although he was not a big fan of Sondheim's music, he enjoyed the lyrics from Saturday Night and he could audition for Bernstein. Sondheim met Bernstein the following day, played for him and Bernstein said he would let him know. The composer wanted to write music and lyrics; after consulting with Hammerstein, Bernstein told Sondheim he could write music later. In 1957, West Side Story opened; directed by Jerome Robbins, it ran for 732 performances. Sondheim has expressed dissatisfaction with his lyrics, saying that they do not always fit the characters and are sometimes too consciously poetic. While Bernstein was working on Candide, Sondheim reportedly wrote some of West Side Story's music; Bernstein's co-lyricist credit disappeared from West Side Story during its tryout, possibly as a trade-off. Sondheim insisted that Bernstein told the producers to list him as the sole lyricist. He described the division of the royalties, saying that Bernstein received three percent and he received one percent. Bernstein suggested evening the percentage at two percent each, but Sondheim refused because he wanted the credit. Sondheim later said he wished \\"someone stuffed a handkerchief in my mouth because it would have been nice to get that extra percentage\\".  After West Side Story opened, Shevelove lamented the lack of \\"low-brow comedy\\" on Broadway and mentioned a possible musical based on Plautus' Roman comedies. When Sondheim was interested in the idea he called a friend, Larry Gelbart, to co-write the script. The show went through a number of drafts, and was interrupted briefly by Sondheim's next project.  In 1959, Sondheim was approached by Laurents and Robbins for a musical version of Gypsy Rose Lee's memoir after Irving Berlin and Cole Porter turned it down. Sondheim agreed, but Ethel Merman - cast as Mama Rose - had just finished Happy Hunting with an unknown composer (Harold Karr) and lyricist (Matt Dubey). Although Sondheim wanted to write the music and lyrics, Merman refused to let another first-time composer write for her and demanded that Jule Styne write the music. Sondheim, concerned that writing lyrics again would pigeonhole him as a lyricist, called his mentor for advice. Hammerstein told him he should take the job, because writing a vehicle for a star would be a good learning experience. Sondheim agreed; Gypsy opened on May 21, 1959, and ran for 702 performances.  Merrily's failure greatly affected Sondheim; he was ready to quit theatre and do movies, create video games or write mysteries: \\"I wanted to find something to satisfy myself that does not involve Broadway and dealing with all those people who hate me and hate Hal.\\" Sondheim and Prince's collaboration was suspended from Merrily to the 2003 production of Bounce, another failure.  However, Sondheim decided \\"that there are better places to start a show\\" and found a new collaborator in James Lapine after he saw Lapine's Twelve Dreams off-Broadway in 1981: \\"I was discouraged, and I don't know what would have happened if I hadn't discovered Twelve Dreams at the Public Theatre\\"; Lapine has a taste \\"for the avant-garde and for visually-oriented theatre in particular\\". Their first collaboration was Sunday in the Park with George (1984), with Sondheim's music evoking Georges Seurat's pointillism. Sondheim and Lapine won the 1985 Pulitzer Prize for Drama for the play, and it was revived on Broadway in 2008, and again in a limited run in 2017.  They collaborated on Into the Woods (1987), a musical based on several Brothers Grimm fairy tales. Although Sondheim has been called the first composer to bring rap music to Broadway (with the Witch in the opening number of \\"Into the Woods\\"), he attributes the first rap in theatre to Meredith Willson's \\"Rock Island\\" from The Music Man. The show was revived on Broadway in 2002.  Sondheim and Lapine's last work together was the rhapsodic Passion (1994), adapted from Ettore Scola's Italian film Passione D'Amore. With a run of 280 performances, Passion was the shortest-running show to win a Tony Award for Best Musical. Answer the following question by taking a quote from the article: Did they collaborate in other projects?","output":"Yes, Sondheim collaborated with James Lapine in several projects. Their first collaboration was Sunday in the Park with George (1984), and they later worked together on Into the Woods (1987) and finally on Passion (1994)."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

U.S. Army Sergeant Bowe Bergdahl waits in a pick-up truck before he is freed at the Afghan border, in this still image from video released June 4, 2014.      KABUL (Reuters) - The political uproar over the prisoner swap that won the release of U.S. Army Sergeant Bowe Bergdahl from Taliban captivity intensified on Wednesday when his hometown canceled plans for a rally celebrating his return amid allegations that he deserted.      The Taliban released video of their handover of Bergdahl to U.S. special operations forces in eastern Afghanistan near the Pakistan border on Saturday, showing the U.S. soldier seemingly dazed and anxious about the unfolding events.      Bergdahl's release after being held for nearly five years in Afghanistan provoked an angry backlash in Congress among lawmakers over the Obama administration's failure to notify them in advance. Some of Bergdahl's former comrades have charged that he was captured after deserting.      Heather Dawson, the city administrator of Hailey, Idaho, said that town officials had called off their June 28 rally to celebrate Bergdahl's release because they would be \\"unable to safely manage the number of people expected.\\"      The small mountain community had been under pressure to cancel after claims by some of Bergdahl's former Army comrades that he had deliberately abandoned his post.      That anger helped fuel congressional criticism of the Obama administration's handling of the deal to free Bergdahl in exchange for the transfer of five senior Taliban members from Guantanamo prison in Cuba to Qatar, where they were to remain for a year.      Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid accused critics of the agreement of seizing upon what should be a moment of unity to \\"play political games,\\" but Senator John McCain, a top Republican who was a prisoner of war in Vietnam, condemned the deal.      \\"This was clearly a terrible idea,\\" he said. \\"These are the hardest of the hard core.\\"      TALIBAN RETURNING TO FIGHT?      U.S. lawmakers complained that the Obama administration did not give Congress 30 days notice required by law before transferring Guantanamo prisoners. They also expressed concern that the five were senior leaders who may return to the fight.      Defense Secretary Chuck Hagel called Bergdahl's family on Wednesday for the first time since his release, speaking with them for about 10 minutes. He assured them the Pentagon's focus was on their son's health and return to his family, a senior official said.      The White House, surprised by the angry backlash, has taken steps to try to address congressional ire over its failure to give lawmakers proper notice, offering apologies and briefings. But they have also expressed frustration over the reaction.      \\"It’s been disappointing to see the politicization of the United States military’s mission to leave no man left behind,\\" one Obama administration official said, speaking on condition of anonymity.      Hagel said critics should wait for all the facts to be known before rushing to judgment on Bergdahl.      The administration arranged briefings for members of Congress on Wednesday and next week. The White House did not inform members of Congress, except for Reid, before the prisoner swap because they were concerned about leaks.      \\"We have no idea what they were thinking,\\" one Democratic lawmaker said.      Administration officials said they decided the notification issue did not apply in Bergdahl's case because of the need to act quickly because of his deteriorating health, the suddenness with which the deal came together and the need for secrecy.      DETERIORATING HEALTH      A U.S. intelligence analysis of videos of Bergdahl during his captivity taken in 2011 and 2013, and other intelligence, indicated that his health had deteriorated substantially over that period, one U.S. official said on condition of anonymity.      The official said that was one of the drivers of the decision to push ahead with an exchange.      It also followed Obama's announcement last week that virtually all U.S. forces would be out of Afghanistan by the end of 2016, ending more than a decade of engagement prompted by the al Qaeda-led Sept. 11, 2001 attacks on the United States.      The Taliban video showed a Blackhawk helicopter landing in a barren valley in eastern Afghanistan. As a handful of U.S. special operations troops got out, two Taliban approached, one holding a makeshift white flag of truce and the other leading Bergdahl.      The American team stepped briefly forward, exchanged a greeting and then led Bergdahl back to the helicopter, quickly searching him before putting him aboard, the video showed. The transaction lasted less than a minute.      Bergdahl disappeared from his outpost in Afghanistan on June 30, 2009, leaving behind some of his gear.      One person familiar with the U.S. military’s investigation of his disappearance said it concluded he walked off the base, but it was not able to determine with certainty that he deserted.      General Raymond Odierno, the Army chief of staff, said on Wednesday the Army would conduct a full review of his capture at the appropriate time.      The State Department said it would look into reports by the Associated Press that the family of an American woman who disappeared in Afghanistan in 2012 with her Canadian husband had received two videos of the couple last year asking the U.S. government to help win their release from the Taliban.      Caitlan Coleman was pregnant at the time of her disappearance along with her husband Joshua Boyle, the AP said. The family decided to make the videos public in light of the publicity surrounding Bergdahl's release.      (Additional reporting by Laura Zuckerman in Hailey, Idaho, Patricia Zengerle,; Susan Cornwell and Mark Hosenball in Washington, David Brunnstrom in Brussels and; Jessica Donati and Hamid Shalizi in Kabul; Editing by David Storey and Grant McCool) ||||| Sorry, your browser is unable to play this video.      The Taliban have released a video of the moment US soldier Bowe Bergdahl was handed over to American special forces after five years in captivity.      He is patted down for bombs or weapons and a plastic bag that contains his only possessions is tossed away by his rescuers. Then, after less than a minute on the ground, the helicopter lifts away again for an American base, and subtitles flash across the screen: \\"Don' [sic] come back to afghanistan.\\"      A still from the video showing Bowe Bergdahl's release.      The video is likely to infuriate the US military by giving a glimpse of Bergdahl's condition and details of the secretive handover, including showing the face of at least one of the special forces team who carried it out. The elite commandos keep their identities secret while they serve.      At one point during the video, one of the three people who climbed out of the helicopter to collect Bergdahl appears to be gesturing at the cameraman to back away. And hours after the short film was uploaded to the internet, the link to it went dead, although there are already dozens of copies on news websites.      The sight of US forces shaking hands with Bergdahl's Taliban guards and then waving to their battlefield enemies as they return to the waiting aircraft may also inflame debate in America, where there has been some criticism of the deal brokered for his release.      Bergdahl was exchanged for five senior Taliban who had been held at Guantánamo prison, including a former army chief, a deputy spy chief and one of the founders of the movement. They were sent to Qatar and must stay there for a year, a condition guaranteed by the ruler of the Gulf State.      Barack Obama has been accused of negotiating with terrorists, although the Taliban are not listed by the US as a terror organisation. Some members of Congress also say he broke the law by not giving them advance notice of the swap.      The initial excitement about recovering Bergdahl has also been clouded by claims from soldiers who served with him, that he had deserted his post in 2009 when he was captured.      Bowe Bergdahl in a video showing his release.      The video starts with images of Guantánamo and the arrival in Qatar of five detainees who were exchanged for the American hostage.      About four minutes in, it switches to Bergdahl waiting for release in a battered pickup truck in scrubby wilderness just off a dirt road. A Taliban voiceover explains the scene, in a violent corner of eastern Afghanistan where a temporary ceasefire was declared for the handover.      A still from the video showing Bowe Bergdahl's release.      \\"We told them there are 18 armed fighters and the Americans said that's all right,\\" the narrator says.      The camera zooms in on nearby hillsides to show Taliban soldiers standing guard with rocket-propelled grenade launchers and AK-47 rifles, some with their faces covered by scarves but others in full view of the camera. Planes, presumably US surveillance craft, circle overhead.      The 28-year-old American is sitting by the window in a traditional loose white trousers and shirt, new or freshly washed for the occasion. He looks extremely nervous, with a twitch in one eye, though not particularly thin and later he walks easily towards the waiting aircraft.      As they wait, he appears to exchange a few words with his captors, backing up comments from his father that since his disappearance in 2009 he had learned Pashto, the language of most Taliban, and forgotten some of his English. The last video of him speaking his mother tongue that has been made public was shot in 2010.      Beside the truck one man flies a white Taliban flag tied to a rough tree branch, and a second fighter appears to co-ordinate the operation. In the next shot, Bergdahl is standing outside the vehicle, with a shawl over his shoulder, scanning the sky anxiously as two Black Hawk helicopters circle.      Then one helicopter lands and three men walk swiftly out to meet another trio – Bergdahl and two captors. The American team, likely including an Afghan interpreter, briefly shake hands with the Taliban and pat down Bergdahl's torso before leading him to the helicopter.      As they walk, they look back and wave. By the aircraft a small red and white plastic bag, which is the only thing Bergdahl was carrying away from his years in captivity, is thrown away by his rescuers and he is patted far more thoroughly. Then he climbs on board, his rescuers take their seats at the edge of the craft and the helicopter lifts off again.      Bergdahl is now in a military hospital in Germany, undergoing physical and mental assessments; he has not yet been reunited with his family. ||||| What is a one-paragraph summary of the above article?","output":"The political uproar over the prisoner swap that won the release of U.S. Army Sergeant Bowe Bergdahl from Taliban captivity intensified on Wednesday when his hometown canceled plans for a rally celebrating his return amid allegations that he deserted.

Write an article that answers the following question: How many yards were converted on the two shortest touchdowns?","output":"Title: A Close Look at the Shortest Touchdowns: Yards Converted and Their Impact Introduction Touchdowns are the primary way for teams to score points in football, with the length of the scoring play varying from one-yard line plunges to long tosses and breakaway runs. In this article, we will take a closer look at the two shortest touchdowns in NFL history, the number of yards converted on these plays, and the impact they had on the teams involved and the sport as a whole. Yards Converted on the Two Shortest Touchdowns The two shortest touchdowns on record both occurred on one-yard plays. These instances are distinct, but they both share the common thread of being incredibly short distances covered to put points on the board. Here, we break down each of these unique plays and their roles within the broader context of the NFL and football lore. 1. The Famed Quarterback Sneak The first of the two shortest touchdowns was a one-yard quarterback sneak. This play is ubiquitous in football, particularly when the offense is on their opponent's one-yard line. The quarterback receives the snap from the center and follows their blockers directly through the line of scrimmage, extending the football across the goal line to score a touchdown. The quarterback sneak requires strength, agility, and timing to penetrate the defense, which often stacks the line of scrimmage to defend against this familiar play. In these situations, the offensive line must generate a strong push, while the quarterback exploits any gaps that emerge in the defense. 2. The Goal-Line Dive The other shortest touchdown involved a goal-line dive, a classic short-yardage rushing play that features the running back leaping over the top of blockers and defenders to break the plane of the goal-line. This play relies heavily on the offensive line's proficiency at creating forward momentum in the trenches, and the running back's ability to sense when and how to leap, ensuring he retains possession of the football while extending it across the goal line. As with the quarterback sneak, this one-yard plunge does not guarantee a touchdown — the defensive linemen and linebackers' role is crucial in providing a stout resistance to prevent the opponent from scoring. Impact and Importance of Short Touchdowns While the two shortest touchdowns resulted from one-yard plays, their significance within the context of the NFL should not be understated. In close matches, every yard — and, more importantly, every point scored — can have a massive impact on the outcome of the game. Successfully converting short-yardage attempts into touchdowns can provide a psychological boost for the offensive team, as it reinforces their ability to impose their will on the defense in critical situations. Moreover, short-yardage plays are often seen in the context of a larger drive, reflecting the tenacity and resilience of the offense to grind out yardage and tire out defenders. The combination of successful short-yardage plays and the elusiveness of quarterbacks and running backs making plays can bolster an offense's overall potency and efficiency. Conclusion In summary, the two shortest touchdowns on record both cover a distance of one yard. These plays — the quarterback sneak and the goal-line dive —Though small in distance, are momentous plays within the sport that demonstrate the importance of decisive gains in critical situations. Enabling teams to capitalize on every opportunity, even the smallest of yardage has the potential to impact the outcome of a game and build a winning legacy in the competitive realms of professional football."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Answer the following question: Please answer the following question about this movie plot. If it's un-answerable, please output \\"No answer\\".  Question: Who is about to give an important speech? Movie plot title: Vivacious Lady Movie plot: Lobby card for the film Vivacious Lady is a story of love at first sight between a young botany professor named Peter Morgan Jr. (Stewart) and a nightclub singer named Francey (Rogers). The film also has comedic elements, including repeatedly frustrated attempts by the newlywed couple to find a moment alone with each other. The story begins when Peter is sent to Manhattan to retrieve his playboy cousin Keith (Ellison) and immediately falls in love with Francey. After a whirlwind one-day courtship, Peter and Francey get married, and they and Keith return to the Morgan family's home, where Peter teaches at the university run by his father Peter Morgan Sr. (Coburn). Mr. Morgan is known for being a proud, overbearing man, so Peter is afraid to tell him about the marriage. When they arrive, Mr. Morgan and Peter's high-society fiancÃ©e Helen (Mercer) initially take Francey for another of Keith's girlfriends. While Peter decides how to approach his father with the news, Francey stays at a women-only hotel, and Peter and Keith introduce her as a new botany student. Peter mentions Francey to his father twice, but on both occasions, Mr. Morgan interrupts and ignores his son, and when Peter becomes insistent, his apparently ailing mother (Bondi) has a flare-up of her heart condition, making any further conversation impossible. For his third attempt, Peter decides to announce the marriage to his parents at the university's student-faculty prom. Keith brings Francey to the prom as his own guest, and Francey, still posing as a student, develops a friendly rapport with Mrs. Morgan, but gets into a nasty brawl with Helen in which Francey accidentally punches Peter's father. Peter says nothing at the prom, but blurts the news to his father just as Mr. Morgan is about to give an important speech, resulting in another argument and another flare-up of Mrs. Morgan's heart condition. This prevents Mrs. Morgan from learning who Francey is, but she accidentally finds out from Francey herself during a conversation in Francey's...

He called bull when his friend said a bull can be what? - feeble - bullbleep - cow - female - charging prey  The best answer is A:","output":"He called bull when his friend said a bull can be what? Here are some explanations for each of the options: 1. Feeble: A bull is typically regarded as a strong and powerful animal, known for its large size, aggression, and ability to charge with immense force. Therefore, referring to a bull as feeble seems counterintuitive and unlikely to be accurate. It's possible that his friend was speaking metaphorically or humorously when describing the bull as feeble, but under normal circumstances, it would be incorrect to call a bull feeble. 2. Bullbleep: \\"Bullbleep\\" is a slang term used to indicate that something is false, misleading, or nonsensical. Thus, his friend might have said something that was untrue or bizarre, prompting the response that it's bullbleep. In this context, it was not a reference to a physical characteristic of a bull but rather an expression of disbelief or disagreement with the claim made. 3. Cow: A cow is a term used for an adult female of the bovine species, whereas a bull is a term for an adult male. They are two distinct types of cattle based on their gender. So, it would be incorrect to use the two words interchangeably. When his friend said a bull can be a cow, he likely responded because it's not possible for a bull to be a cow. 4. Female: As mentioned previously, bulls are adult male cattle, while cows are adult female cattle. The fundamental difference between the two lies in their gender. Therefore, when his friend suggested that a bull could be female, it did not make sense, as bulls are inherently male. 5. Charging prey: Bulls are known to charge at people, other animals, or objects when agitated or threatened. This aggressive behavior is part of a bull's natural instincts and defense mechanisms. Therefore, his friend's statement that a bull can be charging prey would be correct if referencing this instinctive trait. The best answer: The most accurate interpretation of the statement where he called bull would be when his friend claimed that a bull can be either feeble or female. In both cases, the descriptions run counter to the commonly understood characteristics of bulls that they are powerful, male animals. This likely led to a reaction of disbelief or disagreement, causing the phrase \\"bull\\" to be used as an expression of incredulity."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

As such, it is regarded as the fourth-largest of the five principal oceanic divisions: smaller than the Pacific, Atlantic, and Indian Oceans but larger than the Arctic Ocean. This ocean zone is where cold, northward flowing waters from the Antarctic mix with warmer subantarctic waters.  - The Northern Territory (abbreviated as NT) is a federal Australian territory in the central and central northern regions of Australia. It shares borders with Western Australia to the west (129th meridian east), South Australia to the south (26th parallel south), and Queensland to the east (138th meridian east). To the north, the territory is bordered by the Timor Sea, the Arafura Sea and the Gulf of Carpentaria. Despite its large areaover , making it the third largest Australian federal divisionit is sparsely populated. The Northern Territory's population of 244,000 (2016) makes it the least populous of Australia's eight major states and territories, having fewer than half as many people as Tasmania.  - The Indian Ocean is the third largest of the world's oceanic divisions, covering (approximately 20% of the water on the Earth's surface). It is bounded by Asia on the north, on the west by Africa, on the east by Australia, and on the south by the Southern Ocean or, depending on definition, by Antarctica. It is named after the country of India. The Indian Ocean is known as \\"Ratnkara\\", \\"\\"the mine of gems\\"\\" in ancient Sanskrit literature, and as \\"Hind Mahsgar\\", \\"\\"the great Indian sea\\"\\", in Hindi.  - Western Australia (abbreviated as WA) is a state occupying the entire western third of Australia. It is bounded by the Indian Ocean to the north and west, the Great Australian Bight and Southern Ocean to the south, the Northern Territory to the north-east and South Australia to the south-east.

But the law is close to 1,000 pages and will spur hundreds, if not thousands, of regulations. What else does the law offer, and how will Americans be able to gain access to its benefits? But it's clear that","output":"the story ends with a more informed public and an ongoing discussion about the future of healthcare in the United States. As the Affordable Care Act (ACA), or Obamacare, was implemented, millions of Americans gained access to affordable health insurance. Many previously uninsured individuals and families were able to receive coverage through the expansion of Medicaid, the establishment of Health Insurance Marketplaces, and the availability of premium tax credits and cost-sharing reductions for eligible individuals. In addition to its primary goals, the ACA contained numerous provisions aimed at improving healthcare quality, increasing efficiency, and reducing healthcare disparities. President Obama and his administration made efforts to inform the public about the benefits and provisions of the ACA. They used various channels, such as town hall meetings, social media campaigns, and partnerships with celebrities and influencers to reach a wide audience. However, due to the complexity of the law and the highly polarized political climate, many Americans remained confused about its details, and misinformation was widespread. As time went on, public opinion about Obamacare slowly shifted. While some people still strongly oppose it, a significant number of Americans appreciate the benefits it has provided, such as protections for individuals with pre-existing conditions and the ability to keep children on their parents' plans until age 26. In recent years, there has been increased dialogue about new approaches to healthcare in the U.S., such as a single-payer healthcare system, publicly funded \\"Medicare for All,\\" or various alternatives. The discussion around healthcare reform is ongoing, with politicians and citizens alike expressing different opinions about the best way to provide comprehensive, affordable care for all Americans. The story of Obamacare concludes with the realization that while it has had a significant impact on the lives of many Americans, there's still much work to be done in reforming the American healthcare system. To ensure genuine progress, it is essential to prioritize the well-being of the nation's citizens and continue engaging in thoughtful, constructive discourse about the ways to achieve universal, reliable healthcare. In the end, the legacy of Obamacare serves as a reminder of the importance of informed public discourse and a determination to improve the lives of everyday Americans and future generations through meaningful reform. Healthcare remains a vital issue in the United States, and the story of Obamacare offers a strong foundation for further action and progress."},{"instruction":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation. Think like you are answering to a five year old. 'Moron': U.S. real-estate tycoon Donald Trump was ridiculed for blaming yesterday's massacre of journalists on France's gun-control laws. Donald Trump has been labelled a moron on Twitter for suggesting the victims of the Charlie Hebdo massacre were denied 'a fighting chance' by France's gun laws. In a series of tweets, the generously coiffed real-estate tycoon suggested the gunmen were only able to murder with impunity because there were no armed bystanders to shoot back. Twitter users' responses were mixed, but generally negative. The first reply, by Molly Lambourn from Melbourne, Australia, said: '[W]hat a complete idiot. More people would have f***ing died!!! Heaps of crossfire!!!' Trump's tweets, posted less than 12 hours after news broke of the slaughter in the Charlie Hebdo newsroom, said: 'If the people so violently shot down in Paris had guns, at least they would have had a fighting chance. 'Isn't it interesting that the tragedy in Paris took place in one of the toughest gun control countries in the world? 'Remember, when guns are outlawed, only outlaws will have guns!' By this morning, Trump had been labelled a moron in 38 of the replies to his first tweet alone, while a further 44 responses to that same tweet had labelled him stupid. About another 80 responses mentioned the word 'idiot', although not all were directly critical of Trump. However, Trump's pronouncement was chosen as a 'favourite' by 933 people and retweeted 1,488 times, and many - though by no means the majority - of responses were supportive of his view. Responding to Trump, Terry Brown, from Whitley Bay, Tyne and Wear, wrote on Twitter: '[G]ive everyone guns - how can American murder scenes be wrong?' Canadian Cari Ramsey from London, Ontario, wrote: '[N]one of them would have had a shot! NONE! 2 guys with AK47s surprised a room. Guns would have done nothing!' Steve Dickinson, from Cumbria, told Trump: 'Just like the guys in the Boston Marathon hey Donald?' Another user who identified herself only as HillyFoz replied to the tycoon: 'THEY WERE JOURNALISTS. NOT STUPID GUN TOTING RED NECKS. GO BOIL YOUR WIG'. Trumps tweets: By this morning, Trump had been labelled a moron in 38 of the replies to his first of the three tweets alone, while a further 44 responses to that same tweet had labelled him stupid. Moreover, gun laws in France are not so restrictive as Trump seems to believe. Possession of automatic firearms is banned across the European Union, except in special circumstances. But that law is similar in the U.S., where citizens must have permission from the Bureau of Alcohol Tobacco and Firearms to possess fully automatic weapons. In France citizens must have a licence to buy a weapon, but once one is obtained they can use it to buy handguns and even semi-automatic rifles - the kind where all you have to do is pull the trigger to fire. Both such weapons are banned in the mainland UK. 'Je suis Charlie': Journalists hold placards reading 'I am Charlie' as they hold a minute of silence at the offices of news agency Agence France Presse in Paris. Despite the law, France has long had a problem with organised criminal gangs with access Kalashnikov assault rifles, said Mark Mastaglio of the Forensic Firearms Consultancy. 'There was also a spate in France of criminals using rocket-propelled grenades for robberies and even prison breaks,' Mr Mastaglio told MailOnline. He said French criminals' relative ease of access to automatic weapons raised an important question about the circumstances of yesterday's massacre in Paris, where the gunmen fired in single shots throughout. 'If they did have fully-automatic Kalashnikovs and they opted to use single shots that suggests a degree of military training, because as you use the fully automatic fire accuracy goes down.' An injured person is carried into an ambulance after the massacre at the offices of French satirical newspaper Charlie Hebdo in Paris. Those executed included four of the most famous cartoonists in France. High security: A French soldier patrols in front of the Eiffel Tower after the attack yesterday. Seven people have been arrested over the Charlie Hebdo massacre, but two 'armed and dangerous' brothers with links to terrorist groups going back at least a decade today remained on the run. As the manhunt for Cherif and Said Kouachi continued, their alleged getaway driver Hamyd Mourad, 18, turned himself into police in Charleville-Mezieres in northern France. The fact that two were still at large almost 24 hours after a gun battle in which two policemen died alongside ten others, mainly magazine staff, was also a cause for huge concern. France is today holding a day of mourning for the 12 people killed during the country's worst terrorist atrocity this century. A minute's silence will be observed at midday across the country and the bells of Notre Dame Cathedral in the capital will toll.

News article: Dazed & Confused star Jason London was arrested on Sunday morning outside an Arizona bar for disorderly conduct, fighting and assault, but in an exclusive interview with RadarOnline.com, a rep for the actor says he was brutally attacked and unlike the police report states, he did not punch a bouncer in the face.      According to the police report, authorities were called to the Martini Ranch in Scottsdale on Sunday morning at 1:42 a.m. and found Jason beat up, and the bar’s bouncer told them after Jason punched him in the face, they were forced to throw him out of the bar and he was hurt in the process — but Jason’s camp has a very different account of the incident.      EXCLUSIVE PHOTOS: Jason London’s Injuries After Arizona Bar Attack      “The details of the events leading up to the incident are still being worked out with the help of many eyewitness testimonies, with the testimony of individuals who were there with Jason for the duration of the evening, and with the recollection Jason does have. We will get to the bottom of the specifics undoubtedly,” a rep for Jason told RadarOnline.com in an exclusive interview.      “The charges against Jason indicate that he is the assailant in a ‘Multiple Victim Assault,’ as described by the bouncers to the arresting officer. It is a fact of note that Jason does not have one bump, bruise, red mark – not so much as a scratch – on his hands.”      PHOTOS: Celebrity Mugshots      As seen in the photo exclusively obtained by RadarOnline.com of Jason in the hospital, Jason sustained considerable injury to his face, but shows no marks on his hands consistent with throwing a punch at the bouncer, as is claimed.      “His face however sustained injuries which are indicative not of his 145-pound frame assaulting four 250+ pound bouncers but rather indicate a repeated, intentional, aggravated assault where excessive force was used,” the rep continued.      PHOTOS: Celebs Who Have Battled Drinking Problems      “Additionally, assuming that these four bouncers are trained fighters, which most are, that quickly becomes assault with a deadly weapon. Jason’s injuries clearly demonstrate skilled and intentionally inflicted injury and harm.”      Jason, 40, remains in the hospital and is being treated for a right orbital fracture, which extends down through his cheek and into his upper jaw and mouth, a right maxillary sinus fracture, multiple contusions, multiple hematomas, concussion, multiple abrasions and a lot of swelling.      PHOTOS: Stars Who OD’d      “We do know that the police arrested Jason on charges of suspicion of a multiple victim assault based on one bouncer’s account and that one of the other bouncers corroborated his buddy’s story,” the rep continued.      “Since that time witnesses have come forward to give an entirely different account of what they saw that does not match in any way the report given by the bouncers.”      PHOTOS: Celebrity Death Threats      While Jason’s camp admits he was drinking the night of the alleged assault, they claim any belligerent or rude comments made by Jason absolutely didn’t warrant the injuries he sustained.      “This was not the result of injuries sustained due to a belligerent patron during routine removal. These are injuries sustained of a brutal attack using excessive force and deliberate and intentional beatings designed to injure and cause maximum damage. Which they did,” the rep said.      PHOTOS: Celebs Who Have Done Jail Time      “Bars are institutions where there are drunk people who are sometimes inappropriate and even sometimes violent. It is the bouncer’s job to remove the problem and if it is necessary to use force in order to secure the safety of the establishment and patrons they are entitled to do so.      “It is not acceptable to retaliate with brutality once that has been accomplished. Jason’s injuries are consistent with a brutal attack with deliberately and expertly aimed landed shots to the head which, according to eyewitnesses, continued even after he was unconscious.”      PHOTOS: Most Shocking ‘Not Guilty’ Verdicts      The rep claims eyewitnesses at the bar have given no testimony that Jason was being “inappropriate or aggressive in any way.”      “Jason does remember in the midst of having a good time that someone said something about Jason looking at his friend’s girl wrong,” the rep said.

Context: President Donald Trump capped what has been a difficult week politically with an all-out push for tax reform Friday. In a speech to the National Association of Manufacturers in Washington, Trump promised to deliver on a “giant, beautiful, massive, the biggest ever in our country, tax cut.” Trump is eager to move past setbacks on health care reform and the results of a Republican Senate primary Tuesday in Alabama where he found himself on the losing side. The president and his administration also have been on the defensive over hurricane recovery efforts in Puerto Rico. Senate Republicans put off a vote on a plan to repeal and replace Obamacare after it became clear they did not have enough votes to pass the measure, thanks to a handful of Republican defectors. Democrats expressed relief they had beaten back another attempt to undo former President Barack Obama’s signature achievement, the Affordable Care Act. “The reason this bill failed is because millions of Americans didn’t want it,” Senate Democratic leader Chuck Schumer told reporters at the Capitol. On the same day, Christian conservative and former judge Roy Moore easily won a Republican Senate primary in Alabama, defeating incumbent Luther Strange, whom Trump had supported. “We are put here on Earth for a short time, and for that short time our duty it to serve almighty God,” Moore said in his victory speech. Moore has made controversial statements on a number of issues in the past, but he is considered the favorite in a race against Democrat Doug Jones in a general election Dec. 12. Trump had appeared with Strange the week before at a rally in Alabama, but even some analysts said his heart did not appear to be in it. “Trump was campaigning for Luther Strange, but you could tell he was having some second thoughts about that,” said Republican strategist John Feehery.  Moore’s victory, aided by the active support of former Trump White House strategist Steve Bannon, signals what could be a series of divisive Republican primary battles heading into next...

So is it important enough to run out of the room with your phone held half-up in signal to the others that this is a call too important to miss? Truecaller may be able to help with that. \\"If you download Truecaller you will never have to worry about saving contacts to your phone book, everything will be in the cloud.\\" says Alan Mamedi, chief executive and co-founder of Truecaller. He recalls his own phonecall-in-a-meeting dilemma as being his motivation to help create the app, which he believes could be on every smartphone across the globe. \\"If you receive a call from a number you don't have we'll show that information, if there is a sales call coming in we will warn you about that. \\"Or if you just want to make an outbound call in a much better way; by knowing if your friend is available or your friend is on a phone call then you can use Truecaller.\\" Truecaller uses a database of more than two billion phone numbers to tell you who is phoning you. On certain smartphone operating systems it will show that person's name, where they are from, and in many cases even display their picture. It then uses crowd-sourced information to recognise nuisance calls and prevent them ever taking a second more of your time. \\"In the UK or US every sixth call would be a spam caller,\\" says Nami Zarringhalam, co-founder of Truecaller. \\"People in general get more spam calls than they receive calls from family members. So this is a big issue we're pinpointing and providing a solution for.\\" Alan Mamedi, goes on to explain how the data is collected: \\"If you receive a call from a number and we can't detect it, then you, as a user, can actually add that information. \\"But we also partner with different data providers to fill in the empty gaps\\". However according to Nishanth Sastry, senior lecturer in the centre for telecommunications research at King's College, London, it's this aspect of the company that is open to scrutiny. If a phone user shares the names and numbers in their contacts book with an app, that then relays those details to the world, it's not that phone user's information to share, he says. \\"It's not their own information they are sharing, it is their friends' information they are sharing. \\"And they are sharing this information with people that they don't know. That's a privacy issue for friends - who have never seen the terms and conditions of Truecaller.\\" Alan Mamedi, doesn't believe this to be an issue: \\"We made it super easy for anyone to un-list their number on our website, we don't require any verification or such. \\"This has been the case since day one. It's part of our philosophy that it should be super simple to just un-list your number. \\"You just go on our website and then it's gone forever.\\" Now Alan, Nami and their team occupy a series of plush offices. It's a  long way from where they first began back in 2009. \\"We were sitting in my one room apartment, which was basically just my kitchen and bedroom in the same room,\\" says Nami. \\"We started to build Truecaller with servers that we had bought, building an application for our own mobile phones.\\" They then decided to release it and within the first week say they had 10,000 new users. \\"We decided to start a company and so resigned from our full-time jobs,\\" says Alan. \\"Since then we've grown really, really fast. \\"We have 200 million users globally. Just last year we went from 100 million users to 200 million. We've definitely seen an exponential growth globally, especially in the emerging markets.\\" Truecaller, he says, also has a few, less obvious uses. \\"One of the cases we've seen in India is women who before they jump in a cab actually verify the cab driver who is calling them. \\"We with some confidence can say, hey this is a cab driver who's calling you. Or even say if you have friends in common with this cab driver - and that adds a safety layer which we never thought about in the past.\\" Despite adding 63 new users a minute on average since its creation in 2009, Alan has even bigger ambitions. \\"The number one app that people are using everyday is your phone app and no one has innovated in that space. \\"Truecaller is changing that. It's making your phone experience more trusted and safer, but also more delightful. \\"Our aim is to make a great product that everyone will adopt and have it on every single smartphone across the globe.\\" Summary:","output":"Truecaller is an app that uses a database of more than two billion phone numbers to tell you who is calling even if their number is not saved in your contacts, and can also warn you about spam callers."},{"instruction":"Please answer the following question: What is the final step of the following process: -  Open the Dishwasher - Slide out the bottom rack - Take a dirty plate - Rinse the plate - Place the dish in the rack - Repeat leaving enough space for water to reach all items - Fill the soap cup Answer:","output":"Close the dishwasher and start the washing cycle."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Our protagonist, Dre Parker, is a bright and charismatic 12-year-old boy who is passionate about martial arts, filmmaking, and storytelling. Step 2: Establish a motivating goal for the protagonist Dre's dream is to become a successful martial artist and create his own martial arts action film. He wishes to win an upcoming state-wide martial arts championship to prove his talent and capture the interest of a renowned movie producer. Step 3: Create a mentor character Dre meets Mr. Chen, a warm-hearted martial arts master, who agrees to train him for the championship. Mr. Chen recognizes Dre's potential and passion for martial arts and believes that Dre can bring fresh energy and perspectives to the world of martial arts films. Step 4: Establish a conflict or obstacle for the protagonist Dre's main obstacle is a fierce rivalry with a highly skilled 14-year-old martial artist named Troy, who is also looking to win the championship. Troy is the defending champion and becomes extremely jealous when he learns that Mr. Chen has taken Dre under his wing. He vows to do everything in his power to defeat Dre and discredit him. Step 5: Show the protagonist's growth through training and challenges Under Mr. Chen's guidance, Dre learns various martial arts techniques, discipline, and the art of facing adversity with grace. Dre and Mr. Chen develop a deep bond, and Dre becomes part of Mr. Chen's extended family. Meanwhile, Dre faces several small challenges leading up to the championship. With each victory, he gains more confidence and skill. Step 6: Demonstrating the antagonist's underhanded tactics Troy tries sabotaging Dre during their training sessions and makes numerous attempts to intimidate Dre. Despite these setbacks, Dre remains focused, and his relationship with Mr. Chen strengthens as they face these challenges together. Step 7: The ultimate showdown at the championship The day of the martial arts championship arrives. Dre and Troy give their best performances in the competition rounds, but ultimately end up facing each other in the final match. Fueled by passion, determination, and the lessons learned from Mr. Chen, Dre eventually overcomes Troy and becomes the new champion.

How is \\"Westminster, Colorado\\" said in Finnish?","output":"In Finnish, \\"Westminster, Colorado\\" would be pronounced as \\"Westminster, Colorado.\\"  Finnish people generally don't translate names of cities or states, especially when referring to foreign countries, just like in most languages. So, even when speaking Finnish, people would still refer to the city of Westminster in Colorado with the same name, although the pronunciation might slightly vary according to the Finnish phonetic rules. It is essential to note that Finnish language has a phonetic structure quite different from English. However, Finnish speakers would still try to get close to the original pronunciation as much as possible while using their language's phonetic system. Therefore, \\"Westminster, Colorado\\" would essentially remain the same, but with a slight Finnish accent. Keep in mind that Finnish people might use the Finnish language to describe the geographical location or additional details about the city, but the city's name would remain unchanged. For example, when mentioning that Westminster is located in the United States, a Finnish speaker might say: \\"Westminster, Colorado, sijaitsee Yhdysvalloissa.\\" In this sentence, \\"sijaitsee\\" means \\"is located,\\" and \\"Yhdysvalloissa\\" indicates \\"in the United States.\\""},{"instruction":"I want to test the ability of students to read a passage and answer questions about it.

Therefore, about 12.37 lunations (365.24 days divided by 29.53 days) occur in a tropical year. In the widely used Gregorian calendar, there are 12 months (the word month is derived from moon) in a year, and normally there is one full moon each month. Each calendar year contains roughly 11 days more than the number of days in 12 lunar cycles. The extra days accumulate, so every two or three years (seven times in the 19-year Metonic cycle), there is an extra full moon. The extra full moon necessarily falls in one of the four seasons, giving that season four full moons instead of the usual three, and, hence, a blue moon. Question: is there a month with two full moons?","output":"Yes, there can be a month with two full moons. This phenomenon typically occurs when the first full moon takes place at the beginning of the month and the second full moon occurs towards the end of the month.  The term \\"blue moon\\" is used to describe this occurrence of an additional full moon. Since one lunation, or lunar cycle, lasts about 29.53 days, and most months contain 30 or 31 days, it is possible for two full moons to fall within the same calendar month. This phenomenon usually happens every 2.7 years on average. The phrase \\"once in a blue moon\\" comes from the rarity of experiencing two full moons in a single month. However, it's essential to note that despite the name \\"blue moon,\\" the moon does not actually appear blue during this second full moon. The term has more to do with the rarity of the occurrence rather than the color of the moon."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant. User will you give you a task.

Question Why may the narrator be so shaken and concerned ? Answer:","output":"The narrator may be so shaken and concerned for several reasons: 1. Unfamiliarity with earthquakes: Since this is the narrator's first earthquake, they might not know how to react or what to expect during the event. This unfamiliarity with earthquakes could amplify their anxiety and fear. 2. Severity of the earthquake: The description of the building shaking and swaying indicates that the earthquake was quite strong or at least powerful enough to cause noticeable effects. The intensity of the tremors can be alarming and may contribute to the narrator's concern. 3. Potential for injury and damage: Earthquakes pose a risk to both people's safety and the structural integrity of buildings, especially if the building is not designed for earthquake resistance. The narrator might be worried about potential injuries to themselves and their colleagues, as well as damage to the workplace. 4. Uncertainty about aftershocks: Earthquakes are often followed by aftershocks, which can occur minutes, hours, or even days after the main event. The uncertainty about when and where these aftershocks might happen can be unsettling and lead to additional concern for the narrator. 5. Reaction of colleagues: The fact that everyone at work stood in doorways until the earthquake was over suggests that the situation was taken seriously by everyone present.

Options:  A). yes;  B). it is not possible to tell;  C). no;","output":"C). no It is not possible to conclude that \\"The path there runs through arid desert land, with nothing growing except for a few scrubby bushes\\" based on the description provided. The route described as running through groves of willow, used for the local cricket-bat industry, and fields of saffron, suggest an entirely different type of environment. Firstly, willow trees typically require a wet or damp environment, with moist, well-drained soil. They often grow near water sources, such as rivers, streams, or ponds. The presence of thriving willow groves indicates that the region likely receives an adequate amount of water, which is in contrast to the arid desert land described in the statement. Moreover, the mention of a local cricket-bat industry suggests that the area has a sustainable resource in the willow trees, which would be unlikely if the land was arid and unable to support such vegetation. Furthermore, saffron, a valuable and sought-after spice, is derived from the saffron crocus flower. Saffron crocuses typically grow in regions with mild winters and relatively warm, dry summers. They require well-drained soil and can grow at various altitudes. While saffron can sometimes be cultivated in regions with low rainfall, the presence of fields dedicated to saffron growth implies that the area is not arid and inhospitable to plant life, as described in the statement. Thus, given the information provided about the route that includes willow groves and saffron fields, it is not accurate to conclude that the path runs through arid desert land with little to no vegetation. Instead, the description provided suggests a more fertile and well-watered region capable of supporting diverse plant life and sustaining local industries."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Crawford, then working as the archaeological officer for the Ordnance Survey, listed the Coldrum Stones alongside the other Medway Megaliths. In 1926, the Coldrum Stones were given to The National Trust, which dedicated it as a memorial to the Kentish prehistorian Benjamin Harrison. A plaque was erected to mark this, which erroneously termed the monument a stone circle; in 1953, the archaeologist Leslie Grinsell expressed the view that \\"it is hoped that this error may be rectified in the near future\\". Still owned by the Trust, the site is open to visitors all year round, free of charge. On their website, the Trust advises visitors to look for \\"stunning views from the top of the barrow\\". John H. Evans characterised the site as \\"the most impressive\\" of the Medway Megaliths, while Grinsell described it as \\"the finest and most complete\\" of the group.Among the Pagans who use the Coldrum Stones for their ritual activities, there is general satisfaction with the Trust's management of the site, although some frustration at the poor access for disabled visitors. A patch of scorched earth exists on the grass in the centre of the monument, perhaps used by Pagans as well as non-Pagans, and the Trust warden responsible for the site has decided to leave it there rather than seeding it over, in order to encourage any who do light fires to do so in the same spot rather than nearer to the stones themselves.

Q:Information:  - The U.S. Figure Skating Championships is a figure skating competition held annually to crown the national champions of the United States. The competition is sanctioned by U.S. Figure Skating. In the U.S. skating community, the event is often referred to informally as \\"Nationals\\". Medals are awarded in four disciplines: men's (boy's) singles, ladies' (girl's) singles, pair skating, and ice dancing in four colors: gold (first), silver (second), bronze (third), and pewter (fourth) on five levels, senior, junior, novice, intermediate, and juvenile. The event is also used to determine the U.S. teams for the World Championships, World Junior Championships, Four Continents Championships, and Winter Olympics, however, U.S. Figure Skating reserves the right to consider other results.  - Ice dancing is a discipline of figure skating that draws from ballroom dancing. It joined the World Figure Skating Championships in 1952, and became a Winter Olympic Games medal sport in 1976.  - U.S. Figure Skating is the national governing body for the sport of figure skating on ice in the United States. It is recognized as such by the United States Olympic Committee \\"USOC\\" under the Ted Stevens Olympic and Amateur Sports Act and is the United States member of the International Skating Union (\\"ISU\\"). Although the name of the organization is the United States Figure Skating Association it is known as and conducts business under the name U.S. Figure Skating. Founded in 1921, U.S. Figure Skating regulates and governs the sport and defines and maintains the standard of skating proficiency. It specifies the rules for testing, competitions and all other figure skating related activities. U.S. Figure Skating promotes interest and participation in the sport by assisting member clubs, skaters, and athletes, appointing officials, organizing competitions, exhibitions, and other figure skating pursuits, and offering a wide variety of programs.  - Russel S. \\"Russ\\" Witherby (born February 3, 1962 in Cincinnati, Ohio) is an American coach and former competitive figure skater. He competed in ice dance with several partners. He and April Sargent Thomas competed in the 1992 Winter Olympics. His other partners included Lois Luciani and Susie Wynne.  - Pair skating is a figure skating discipline. International Skating Union (ISU) regulations describe pair teams as consisting of \\"one lady and one man.\\" The sport is distinguished from ice dancing and single skating by elements unique to pair skating, including overhead lifts, twist lifts, death spirals, and throw jumps. Pair teams also perform the elements of single skating in unison. The discipline requires similar technique and timing on all elements of the performance in order to create an impression of \\"two skating as one\\". Serious skating accidents are most common in pairs.  - April L. Sargent ( born April 1 , 1968 in Ogdensburg , New York ) is an American former ice dancer .

(January 2016) (Learn how and when to remove this template message) Several months after the events of The Fly, Veronica Quaife delivers Seth Brundle's child. After giving birth to a squirming larval sac, she dies from shock. The sac then splits open to reveal a seemingly normal baby boy. The child, named Martin Brundle, is raised by Anton Bartok, owner of Bartok Industries (the company which financed Brundle's teleportation experiments). Fully aware of the accident which genetically merged Seth Brundle with a housefly (a condition that Martin has inherited), Bartok plans to exploit the child's unique condition. Martin grows up in a clinical environment, and is constantly subjected to studies and tests by scientists. His physical and mental maturity is highly accelerated, and he possesses a genius-level intellect, incredible reflexes, and no need for sleep. He knows he is aging faster than a normal human, but is unaware of the true cause, having been told his father died from the same rapid aging disease. As Martin grows, Bartok befriends him. At age 3, Martin has the physique of a 10-year-old, and frequently sneaks around and explores the Bartok complex. He finds a room containing laboratory animals, and befriends a Golden Retriever. The next night, he brings the dog some of his dinner, only to find it missing. He enters an observation booth overlooking Bay 17. There, scientists have managed to reassemble Brundle's Telepods, but were unable to duplicate his programming that enabled them to teleport living subjects. Using the Golden Retriever as a test subject, the experiment fails, leaving the dog horribly deformed. The dog attacks and maims one of the scientists, horrifying young Martin. Two years later, Martin's body has matured to that of a 25-year-old. On his fifth birthday, Bartok presents Martin with a bungalow on the Bartok facility's property. He also...

Among the options provided, leukemia is the most accurate answer. This is because, according to Fact 2, leukemias are cancers of the blood, which means that they result from uncontrolled cell division in the blood cell-forming tissues. It's important to understand why the other options are not correct answers: - AIDS: Acquired Immunodeficiency Syndrome (AIDS) is a chronic, life-threatening condition caused by the human immunodeficiency virus (HIV). It is not characterized by uncontrolled cell division but rather by the weakening of the immune system, which makes the person more susceptible to various infections and diseases. - Fever: A fever is a temporary increase in body temperature, often due to an infection. It is a symptom of an underlying condition, not a disease involving uncontrolled cell division. - Mitosis: Mitosis is a normal cellular process where a cell divides into two identical daughter cells. It is not a disease but a mechanism of cell division and growth in the body. - Cigarettes: Cigarettes are not a disease; they are a product known to contain harmful substances, including carcinogens that can increase the risk of developing various types of cancer. Cigarette smoking itself does not directly cause uncontrolled cell division but contributes to the formation of cancerous cells by damaging healthy tissues. - Diseased cells: This term is too vague and could represent any cells affected by various pathological conditions, not solely the ones exhibiting uncontrolled cell division. - Smoking: Like cigarettes, smoking is an activity or behavior known to have negative health consequences, including increased cancer risk. While smoking can contribute to the development of cancer due to the intake of various harmful substances, smoking itself is not a disease involving uncontrolled cell division. - Parasites: Parasites are organisms that live on or within a host organism, deriving their sustenance at the host's expense. While some parasites may cause diseases, they do not typically lead to uncontrolled cell division in the host. In conclusion, among the given options, leukemia best fits the description of a disease in which cells divide out of control, as it is a type of cancer involving the blood-forming tissues."},{"instruction":"Answer the following question: The address I had been given was a flophouse called Casa Salvador in the scummy side of downtown, the part where the city's redevelopment (read: \\"gentrification\\") efforts hadn't yet managed to drive out the sundry undesirable elements.

Her skin was leathery and weather beaten, and I guessed she was the type who was actually a good ten years younger than she looked. I made my way up the narrow staircase that smelled of urine and bleach, going all the way to the third floor. I continued down the dimly lit hallway, past a series of closed doors that muffled the sounds of women faking moans of pleasure.

Sadly, Sam had gone to a river called the River Foyle, and while he was there, something very sad and tragic happened. Sam had fallen into the river and was unable to get out. The river was deep and fast, and Sam couldn't swim back to the shore.  Because of this, Sam was not able to go back to his family. The police were able to find Sam's body in the river. A body is what we call a person when their heart has stopped beating, and they are no longer alive. Everyone who knew Sam was very sad to hear this news, but they were also thankful that the police had found him. Even though everyone was sad that Sam was gone, they wanted to remember all the good times they had with him. They shared stories about Sam's kindness, his laughter, and his love for life.

Please answer the following question: One of the challenges that every community faces, particularly teams inside a larger community, is the ability to coordinate what goals and ambitions the team is going to work on. Traditionally this has always been somewhat ad-hoc: people join a team and work on whatever they feel like. Ideas are ten-a-penny though. For most teams that work on larger projects (such as events, software, products and more) to actually be productive, coordinating this work can be complex: some projects require coordination across many people with different skill-sets, time-availability and resources. Something I would like us to work towards in the Ubuntu community is encouraging a culture of best-practise in how we plan our work and coordinate our awesome teams to work together on projects. I believe this kind of coordination can help our teams increase the opportunity for success in their work, feel more empowered and productive and provide greater insight to people outside those teams on what the team is doing. An effective way of doing this is to build a Roadmap for each cycle. This provides an opportunity to capture a set of goals the team will work together to achieve in each six-month period. This article outlines how to build such a Roadmap. While at first a roadmap can feel a little like a nod to the gods of bureaucracy, they actually possess many benefits: * Direction – one of the biggest complaints teams often report is a lack of direction. If a team gets into the habit of creating a roadmap at the beginning of a cycle, it gives the team a sense of focus and direction for the coming cycle. * Documented commitments are more effective – a common rule in Project Management training is that actions assigned to people in a shared document are more effective than ad-hoc or private commitments. By documenting who will work on what in a cycle and putting their name next to an action can help seal a sense of accountability for their contributions to the project. * Feeling of success – regularly revisiting a roadmap and...

You will be given a task. You must generate a detailed and long answer. This is a correct answer to the following question about sense. Yes or no? Answer: Some species of animals are able to sense the world in a way that humans cannot, with some species able to sense electrical and magnetic fields , and detect water pressure and currents. Question: how does taste differ from the other senses? The answer to this question is:","output":"Yes, taste does differ from other senses in various ways. To understand how taste differs from other senses, it is essential to examine the primary sensory systems and their functions. The five primary senses are sight, hearing, touch, smell, and taste. Each of these senses allows humans and animals to perceive and interpret the world around them uniquely. Taste, also known as gustation, is a chemosensory sense primarily concerned with perceiving flavors present in food and other substances. This sense relies on the activation of specialized taste receptor cells located on the taste buds, primarily found on the tongue but also present on the soft palate, throat, and esophagus. These receptor cells are connected to nerve fibers that send signals to the gustatory cortex in the brain, allowing us to perceive and process the five basic tastes: sweet, salty, sour, bitter, and umami. The other senses, in comparison, function through different mechanisms: 1. Sight (vision) - Vision is a highly complex sense that relies on the detection and interpretation of light. Photoreceptor cells in the retina (rods and cones) convert light stimuli into electrochemical signals, which are transmitted along the optic nerves to the brain's visual cortex. This process allows us to perceive colors, shapes, and movements, among other visual cues. 2. Hearing (audition) - The perception of sound occurs through the mechanical transfer of sound waves through the outer, middle, and inner ear structures. The inner ear consists of the cochlea, a fluid-filled, snail-shaped structure whose hair cells transform the mechanical vibrations into electrical nerve impulses that travel to the brain's auditory cortex. 3. Touch (somatosensation) - This sense encompasses multiple sensory modalities, including pressure, temperature, pain, and proprioception (the sense of body position and movement). Various types of touch-sensitive receptor cells are spread throughout the skin, muscles, tendons, and joint capsules, and their activation sends signals to the somatosensory cortex in the brain. 4. Smell (olfaction) - Like taste, smell is also a chemosensory sense, but it deals with the detection of volatile molecules in the air. The olfactory epithelium, a specialized tissue in the nasal cavity, contains olfactory receptor cells that bind to odorant molecules and send signals through the olfactory nerves to the olfactory bulb in the brain. This sense allows us to perceive and identify a wide range of scents. Some key differences between taste and the other senses include: - Taste is limited to the detection of flavors in food and substances, while the other senses, such as sight and hearing, enable us to perceive a broader spectrum of stimuli, such as light and sound. - Taste relies on taste buds and receptor cells within the mouth, while the other senses have specialized organs or structures throughout the body that are crucial to the perception of stimuli. - The number of basic taste qualities is limited to five (sweet, salty, sour, bitter, and umami), while the range of sensations experienced through the other senses is much more extensive and varied. - Taste and smell are chemosenses that allow us to sense chemical compounds, whereas the other senses (sight, hearing, and touch) respond to different types of physical stimuli like light, sound, and mechanical pressure. In summary, taste differs from other senses in the types of stimuli it is designed to detect, the specific receptor cells and structures involved, and the range of sensations it allows us to experience. While taste is primarily concerned with detecting and interpreting flavors in food and other substances, the other senses serve a more diverse array of functions, from perceiving light, sound, and other physical stimuli to providing us with critical information about our environment and our bodies."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Her appointment was announced on January 18, 2005 by UN Secretary-General Kofi Annan. Previously, Veneman was the United States Secretary of Agriculture, the first, and as of 2018 the only, woman to hold that position. Veneman served as USDA Secretary from January 20, 2001 to January 20, 2005, leaving to become the fifth executive director of UNICEF. Veneman began her legal career as a staff attorney with the General Counsel's office of the Bay Area Rapid Transit District in Oakland, California, in 1976. In 1978, she returned to Modesto, where she served as a Deputy Public Defender. In 1980, she joined the Modesto law firm of Damrell, Damrell and Nelson, where she was an associate and later a partner.  Veneman joined the United States Department of Agriculture's Foreign Agricultural Service in 1986, serving as Associate Administrator until 1989. During this time she worked on the Uruguay Round talks for the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade (GATT). She subsequently served as Deputy Undersecretary of Agriculture for International Affairs and Commodity Programs from 1989 to 1991. From 1991 to 1993, she served as United States Department of Agriculture's Deputy Secretary, the first woman appointed as the Department's second-highest-ranking official. At this point Veneman took a break from political and administrative office to practice with the law firm and lobby group Patton, Boggs & Blow and also served on several boards of directors and advisory groups.  In 1995 Veneman re-entered government, when she was appointed Secretary of the California Department of Food and Agriculture, again being the first woman to hold the position.

Please answer this question: Whose symphony No 3 in E Flat contains a funeral march?","output":"Ludwig van Beethoven's Symphony No. 3 in E-flat major, Op. 55, commonly known as the Eroica (\\"heroic\\" in Italian) Symphony, is a pivotal work in the Western classical music tradition. Completed in 1804, the symphony is widely regarded as a groundbreaking composition, as it marks Beethoven's departure from the classical traditions of his predecessors, such as Haydn and Mozart, and ushers in the Romantic period. The Eroica Symphony consists of four movements: 1. Allegro con brio 2. Marcia funebre: Adagio assai (Funeral March) 3. Scherzo: Allegro vivace 4. Finale: Allegro molto The second movement, titled \\"Marcia funebre: Adagio assai,\\" is an emotionally powerful funeral march. A funeral march, known for its solemnity and respectful nature, is an instrumental musical composition reflecting the mournful and tragic ambiance of a funeral procession. Beethoven's funeral march in the Eroica Symphony is unique and innovative for a few reasons. Traditionally, funeral marches used a simple binary form. However, Beethoven expands this form, utilizing a more complex ternary structure. The movement contains a rich harmonic palette, exploring various tonalities, and displays a variety of contrasting emotions and moods. This emotionally charged movement serves as an essential centerpiece of the symphony, providing a dramatic contrast to the other movements' more energetic and vibrant character. The Eroica Symphony was initially dedicated to Napoleon Bonaparte, as Beethoven admired him as an embodiment of enlightenment ideals and a champion of liberty. However, when Napoleon declared himself Emperor in May 1804, Beethoven became disillusioned with the leader, fearing that power had corrupted him. Consequently, Beethoven erased the dedication to Napoleon from the title page of his symphony, leaving only the name \\"Sinfonia eroica\\" and the subtitle \\"composed to celebrate the memory of a great man.\\" In conclusion, Symphony No. 3 in E-flat major, commonly known as the Eroica Symphony, by Ludwig van Beethoven, is the composition that contains the funeral march in its second movement. This groundbreaking work profoundly influenced the symphonic genre and served as a stepping stone in the evolution of Western classical music, bridging the Classical and Romantic periods."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant that follows instruction extremely well.

In the year 1347 in Garfagnana, a convent of nuns is led by Father Tommasso. The nuns include Alessandra, who wants a better life for herself and is held at the convent due to her father's support of the church rather than her own bidding; Ginevra, a gossip who is later revealed to be a lesbian and Jewish; and Fernanda, an emotionally unstable and violent woman. The three of them routinely assault the gardener, who quits in disgust. Meanwhile in Lunigiana, a young servant named Massetto gets caught having sexual relations with his master's wife. While on the run, he discovers Father Tommasso, who has gone to sell some embroidery but has instead gotten drunk and lost his possessions in the river. Massetto helps him get back home. The two arrange to have Massetto work as a gardener while pretending to be a deaf-mute, in hopes that this will dissuade the nuns from giving him trouble.  Fernanda's friend Marta appears and encourages Alessandra and Ginevra to get drunk off the sacramental wine while explaining how being with a man is the greatest possible pleasure.

Question: What is the missing first step of the following process:  -  The oxygen passes through the bronchial tubes to the lungs - The oxygen is moved into the bloodstream - Circulates through the body - The cells in the body exchange the oxygen with carbon dioxide - The bloodstream carries the carbon dioxide back to the lungs - The lungs expel the carbon dioxide through the nose and mouth. Answer:","output":"The missing first step in this process is the inhalation of oxygen-rich air. To complete the description of the process, it should be as follows: 1. Inhalation: The first step in the process is when we breathe in oxygen-rich air through our nose or mouth. Depending on the air quality and the presence of potential allergens, it is generally preferable for this process to take place through the nose, as the nasal hairs and mucus can help to filter out harmful particles. 2. Oxygen passage: The oxygen in the inhaled air passes through the bronchial tubes, which are airway passages that connect the trachea (windpipe) to the lungs. These tubes branch into smaller airways called bronchioles, facilitating the movement of the essential gases into and out of the lungs. 3. Oxygen diffusion: Once in the lungs, the oxygen travels across the thin walls of the alveoli (tiny air sacs) into the surrounding capillaries (small blood vessels). Within the capillaries, the oxygen can bind to hemoglobin molecules in red blood cells, which enable its efficient transport throughout the body. 4. Blood circulation: Oxygenated blood from the lungs is pumped by the heart to the rest of the body through the arterial system. Red blood cells release oxygen, which diffuses into tissues and cells, where it can be used for various metabolic activities. 5. Cellular respiration: Inside cells, oxygen is used in processes like cellular respiration and the production of adenosine triphosphate (ATP), a molecule that serves as an energy source for various cellular functions. As a byproduct of cellular respiration, carbon dioxide is produced, a waste gas that must be removed from the body. 6. Carbon dioxide transport: Red blood cells in the venous system take up carbon dioxide from the cells, where it either dissolves in the blood plasma or binds to hemoglobin. The blood carrying carbon dioxide then returns to the heart and is pumped back to the lungs. 7. Carbon dioxide release: In the lungs, the carbon dioxide diffuses from the capillaries into the alveoli, where it is then expelled from the body during exhalation, completing the process."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

ReadmoreaboutLuxembourg What's a sentence that uses these characters?","output":"Luxembourg, a small European nation nestled between Germany, France, and Belgium, has a rich history that dates back to the Roman era. This landlocked country is known for its remarkable geographical landscape and cultural heritage, with its official languages, Luxembourgish, German, and French, contributing to its multi-faceted identity. Luxembourg, with an area of about 2,586 square kilometers, is one of the smallest sovereign nations in Europe, but it plays a significant role in the European Union due to its strategic location in the heart of Western Europe.  In the early ages, Luxembourg was home to the Treveri, a Celtic-Germanic tribe, which contributed immensely to the development of the region. During the Roman era, the land was incorporated into the Roman province of Belgica, acting as a crossing point between the Rhine and Meuse rivers. Notably, the Romans established the foundations for many of the current educational, administrative, and social structures existing in Luxembourg and the surrounding region. Luxembourg's medieval period saw the emergence of its influential dynasties and powerful rulers, such as William I, who was initially appointed by the Holy Roman Emperor to govern Luxembourg. The House of Luxembourg, consisting of high-ranking nobles, managed to produce several kings and emperors during the later Middle Ages. Count Henry VII, a member of the House of Luxembourg, held the position as the King of Germany and even the Holy Roman Emperor, a testament to Luxembourg's standing during this era. The history of Luxembourg is marked by crucial alliances, territorial conflicts, and invasions by major European powers. During its tumultuous existence, the nation experienced periods of Spanish, Austrian, French, and Prussian occupation, only to regain its autonomy and political influence. Today, the remnants of these occupations persist in Luxembourg's architectural heritage, including the renowned Bock Casemates and the picturesque Vianden Castle. Luxembourg was one of the founding members of the European Union, the European Coal and Steel Community, and the NATO alliance, demonstrating its commitment to stability and cooperation in Europe. Following the devastating World War II era, Luxembourg experienced rapid economic growth, transforming from a predominantly agricultural society to a highly industrialized one, driven by the thriving steel industry. This economic transformation propelled Luxembourg to become one of the wealthiest nations globally with an impressive GDP per capita. In contemporary Luxembourg, the financial sector remains among the most vital pillars of its economy, as the nation established itself as an international financial hub over the past decades. The country also focuses on diversifying its economy through the development of information technology, logistics, and life sciences. Another trait that makes Luxembourg so fascinating is its wide-ranging commitment to sustainability, with comprehensive environmental policies and investment in renewable energy. In conclusion, the small yet influential nation of Luxembourg has a rich and complex history shaped by the European powers that have occupied its territory at different times. Known for its stunning landscape, architectural masterpieces, and resilient economy, Luxembourg is a testament to the power of perseverance amid the continent's tumultuous history."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant, who knows every language and how to translate one language to another.

A:","output":"Bertalan Farkas and Georgi Ivanov share the mutual occupation of being astronauts. Bertalan Farkas, who was born on August 2, 1949 in Gyulaháza, Hungary, became the first Hungarian astronaut in history. He flew on the Soyuz 36 mission to the Salyut 6 Space Station as part of Intercosmos, a spaceflight program designed to give nations on the side of the Soviet Union assistance in manned and unmanned space exploration. Intercosmos represented a major diplomatic and technological achievement meant to both display solidarity with other socialist countries and provide the Soviet Union with valuable scientific data collected by foreign astronauts. Farkas spent almost eight days in space in 1980 as part of this mission, and continues to hold the title of the first and only Hungarian astronaut. Meanwhile, Georgi Ivanov is Bulgaria's first man in space. He was born on July 2, 1940 in Lovech, Bulgaria, and is also a product of the Intercosmos program. Ivanov made his space journey on the Soyuz 33 mission in 1979 to the Salyut 6 Space Station, just a year before Farkas. However, due to a critical failure upon re-entry, the full mission objectives were not achieved. Despite this, Ivanov returned safely to Earth, making his experience an important part of space travel history. Both Farkas and Ivanov underwent rigorous training to become astronauts and so have shared experiences and challenges related to their chosen profession. Their rigorous training included a multitude of physical, technical, and psychological challenges designed to prepare them for the uncertainties of space travel. They had to go through survival training, intensive study of spacecraft systems, simulation exercises, zero-G training, and many other aspects to ensure they were fully equipped to deal with any situation that could arise during space travel.

The narration ends with the mention that the segment did not run on television and was cut from a program about Johnson, at his own request. At a gathering in June 1963, shadowy industrial, political and former US intelligence figures discuss their growing dissatisfaction with the Kennedy administration. In the plush surroundings of lead conspirator Robert Foster (Robert Ryan), he and the others try to persuade Harold Ferguson (Will Geer), a powerful oil magnate dressed in white, to back their plans for an assassination of Kennedy. He remains unconvinced, saying, \\"I don't like such schemes. They're only tolerable when necessary, and only permissible when they work.\\" James Farrington (Burt Lancaster), a black ops specialist, is also among the group: He shows Ferguson and others that a careful assassination of a U.S. President can be done under certain conditions, and refers to the murders of Abraham Lincoln, James Garfield, and William McKinley as examples, and includes assassination attempts of others including Roosevelt in 1933. He calls this \\"executive action\\". The film cuts to a desert, where a shooting team is doing target practice at a moving object. One of the shooters says they can only guarantee the operation's success by slowing down the target to 15Â miles per hour.

Write an article using the following points: Israel plans to begin construction of settlements in the East 1, or E1, zone in the West Bank. Comes after the U.N. voted to grant Palestine non-member observer status. Palestinians believe construction here would essentially cut the West Bank in half. Group: Currently 137 Israeli settlements in the West Bank, with about 325,000 inhabitants. Article:","output":"Title: Israel Plans to Construct Settlements in East 1, or E1, Zone in the West Bank amidst U.N. Granting Palestine Non-Member Observer Status Introduction: (Step 1: Provide a brief background of the situation and mention the main points of the article.) The Israeli government has laid out plans to begin construction of settlements in the East 1, or E1, zone in the West Bank. This development comes on the heels of the United Nations' decision to grant Palestine non-member observer status. Many Palestinians believe that the construction in the E1 zone would essentially divide the West Bank and further complicate the already strained Israeli-Palestinian relationship. Body: (Step 2: Address the main points - Israel's construction plans, U.N. granting Palestine non-member observer status, Palestinians' concerns, and existing settlements.) 1. Israel's Construction Plans The Israeli government has announced plans to construct new settlements in the E1 zone, an area located in the West Bank. The proposed construction would expand the existing Israeli settlements and continue the encroachment on Palestinian land. 2. U.N. Granting Palestine Non-Member Observer Status Recently, the United Nations voted in favor of granting non-member observer status to Palestine. Although this new status does not grant full membership to Palestine, it indicates international recognition of the need for a Palestinian state and a movement towards a two-state solution in the region. 3. Palestinians' Concerns The construction in the E1 zone raises significant concerns among Palestinians, who argue that it would essentially cut the West Bank in half. This division would further restrict the movement of Palestinians between different areas in the West Bank and limit their access to essential services, making it difficult for them to carry out their daily lives. 4. Existing Settlements in the West Bank Currently, there are 137 Israeli settlements in the West Bank, with an approximate population of 325,000 Israeli settlers. These settlements have long been a point of contention between Israel and Palestine, as the presence of Israeli settlers on Palestinian lands violates international law and hinders the establishment of a viable Palestinian state. Conclusion: (Step 3: Summarize the main points and discuss the potential implications of the situation.) Israel's plan to construct additional settlements in the E1 zone exacerbates existing tensions between Israel and Palestine, particularly in light of the U.N.'s decision to grant Palestine non-member observer status. The expansion of settlements in the E1 zone could fundamentally alter the landscape of the West Bank, making it even more challenging to reach a peaceful resolution and a two-state solution in the region. It remains to be seen how both sides will navigate this complex and evolving situation."},{"instruction":"Instructions: In this task, you're given a pair of sentences, sentence 1 and sentence 2.

Think like you are answering to a five year old. Earths magnetic field helps protect Earth and its organisms. It protects us from harmful particles given off by the sun. Most of the particles are attracted to the north and south magnetic poles. This is where Earths magnetic field is strongest. This is also where relatively few organisms live. Another benefit of Earths magnetic field is its use for navigation. People use compasses to detect Earths magnetic north pole. Knowing this helps them tell direction. Many animals have natural 'compasses' that work just as well. Birds like the garden warbler in Figure 1.36 use Earths magnetic field. They use it to guide their annual migrations. Recent research suggests that warblers and other migrating birds have structures in their eyes. These structures let them see Earths magnetic field as a visual pattern.

Answer the following question: Everybody knew Shandor Marley's mother liked to spend more time flirting with serial killers than she did taking care of things at home. So when her son went round with an air rifle popping his neighbours like they were allotment pigeons, they figured all the boy really needed was a bit of attention. Shandor finally flipped one day after finding out the inbred farm boys who made his life hell most days were in fact his half-brothers. He returned home to confront his mother only to find her pritt-sticking press cuttings of the Mad Killer into a brand new scrapbook and seemingly not in the least bit concerned by her son's unexpected discovery. Luckily Shandor's shooting spree didn't do too much damage beyond putting one of his so-called new father's eyes out, which could be considered doubly unfortunate given as the so-called new father in question owned the old byre Shandor and his mother called home. After Shandor had spent enough time shut away in borstal with the kind of kids who would've sent his mother all weak at the knees, he went straight home half-expecting the byre to be boarded up with a blu-tacked note saying she was lugging her stupid arse to Texas to spring her latest psycho boyfriend from his cell on death row. Shandor was thinking how much that excuse would sit well with her as he scuffed up the stone track to the byre with a black bin-bag of belongings and a sunburned arm across his forehead to shield himself from the glare. The place looked pretty much the same as he remembered it, only three years worse off. The strip of grass outside the back door was parched yellow and paint peeled around the blown-out windows. He had a hand on the door before he knew for sure it was still lived-in. He flapped thunderbugs off his forearm and creaked open the door. The kitchen stank of stale cigarettes and the dregs of spirit bottles. According to the above context, choose the correct option to answer the following question.

Subject: Both sentences discuss \\"some species.\\" This aspect is the same. 2. Characteristic: Both sentences reference the invert and lophophore of these species.    a. The first sentence uses \\"withdrawn\\" to describe the invert and lophophore, while the second uses \\"retracted.\\" Both words imply a pulling back or withdrawal. Although \\"withdrawn\\" generally implies a more passive action and \\"retracted\\" implies active pulling, the two words are similar enough to convey the same meaning in this context. 3. Protective mechanism: In both sentences, the invert and lophophore are protected by an operculum (referred to as a \\"lid\\"). This aspect is the same. 4. Operculum function: Both sentences indicate that the operculum is closed by muscles and opened by fluid pressure. This aspect is the same.

The context states that Narendra Modi is the \\"14th and current Prime Minister of India.\\" From this, we are able to infer that he is one among the first 15 Prime Ministers, as 14 falls within the range of numbers from 1 to 15. As the leader of the country since May 2014, Modi has held a significant role in Indian politics. Additionally, his tenure as Chief Minister of Gujarat from 2001 to 2014 and his status as a Member of Parliament for Varanasi serve to reinforce the importance of his political career. Furthermore, the context mentions that Modi is a member of the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) and that he is a Hindu nationalist as well as a member of the right-wing Rashtriya Swayamsevak Sangh (RSS) organization. This offers a more comprehensive understanding of his political affiliations and illustrates the ideologies he supports. In summary, based on the context provided, Narendra Modi is the 14th Prime Minister of India, which situates him within the first 15 Prime Ministers of the country. This hypothesis is supported by the details regarding his political career and affiliations."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant. User will you give you a task.

Maximilian's death in 1519 brought the Imperial election to the forefront of European politics. Pope Leo X, threatened by the presence of Spanish troops a mere forty miles from the Vatican, supported the French candidacy. The prince-electors themselves, with the exception of Frederick of Saxony, who refused to countenance the campaigning, promised their support to both candidates at once. Before his death, Maximilian had already promised sums of 500,000 florins to the Electors in exchange for their votes, but Francis offered up to three million, and Charles retaliated by borrowing vast sums from the Fuggers. The final outcome, however, was not determined by the exorbitant bribes, which included Leo promising to make the Archbishop of Mainz his permanent legate. The general outrage of the populace at the idea of a French Emperor gave the Electors pause, and when Charles put an army in the field near Frankfurt, where they were meeting, the Electors obligingly voted for him. He was crowned Holy Roman Emperor on 23 October 1520, by which point he already controlled both the Spanish crown and the hereditary Burgundian lands in the Low Countries. Cardinal Wolsey, hoping to increase Henry VIII's influence on the continent, offered the services of England as a mediator for the various disputes between Francis and Charles. Henry and Francis staged an extravagant meeting at the Field of the Cloth of Gold. Immediately afterwards, Wolsey entertained Charles in Calais.

Answer: A:","output":"The product review in question clearly carries a negative tone. The dissatisfaction and disappointment of the reviewer are explicitly expressed throughout the review, starting with the title itself, which repeats the word \\"terrible\\" three times. This strongly emphasizes the negative sentiment the reviewer feels about the book. The reviewer goes on to say that the book is \\"so terrible,\\" further reinforcing their negative opinion. The use of exclamation points highlights the strength of the reviewer's feelings, suggesting that they not only disapprove of the book but also feel strongly enough about it to emphasize their distaste. Moreover, the reviewer mentions that if it were possible, they would give the book a rating of \\"negative five stars.\\" This hyperbolic statement demonstrates just how much the reviewer dislikes the book, as the standard rating system typically only allows for a minimum of one star. By wishing for a lower possible rating, the reviewer is trying to convey that the book is not merely subpar but actually deserving of more criticism than the rating system even allows. Lastly, the fact that the reviewer gives the book the lowest possible rating of one star leaves no doubt about the overall negative tone of the review. The one-star rating indicates that the reviewer sees very little, if any, redeeming qualities in the book and would not recommend it to others. In conclusion, the product review displays a clear negative tone, evident from the title, word choice, use of hyperbole, and the lowest possible star rating given to the book.

Tony, however, fears the passage of time and wishes to turn back the clock to relive the glory days of his youth when his parents were still alive. The movie opens with Tony blowing out candles on his 25th birthday cake, surrounded by friends and family, but his eyes are lost in thought, reminiscing about the past. An old friend, Sarah, notices his distant demeanor and offers to listen, providing comfort and understanding on how he feels about turning 25. Determined to change the course of his life, Tony decides to break away from the monotony of adulthood and embarks on an ambitious journey to invent a time machine. He puts his heart and soul into the project, often becoming isolated in his workshop for days on end, with only Sarah regularly checking on him. As rumors of Tony's strange invention spread throughout the town, it catches the attention of a mysterious and wealthy investor, Mr. Grayson, who offers financial support and resources for his project. As the story progresses, Tony and Sarah's relationship deepens, and she finds herself torn between being supportive and worrying about Tony's obsession with turning back time. Tony, fully aware of Sarah's concerns, promises her that he will never forget their time together, no matter how far back he goes. Finally, after months of laboring, Tony's invention comes to fruition. He successfully creates a machine capable of traveling through time. However, during its test run, unforeseen consequences arise. The machine's energy destabilizes the fabric of time, causing anomalies and ripples throughout history. Faced with the repercussions of tampering with time, Tony panics and accidentally sends himself back to the age of 17. As a younger-version of himself, Tony desperately attempts to stabilize time and prevent further damage. He realizes the importance of living in the present, understanding that the good memories will stay with him, but that is not where life always exists. Along the way, he encounters his childhood friend, Jonathan, who had died in an accident. Through his interactions with him, Tony slowly begins to understand the impact of trying to change the past and the powerful role of fate. Seeing his parents alive and happy stirs up mixed emotions for Tony, but he becomes more determined to return to his 25-year-old reality, to the people he loves, especially Sarah. His constant wistfulness for the past has compromised his cherished relationships, and he now understands that he must embrace the present and the future. Using his advanced knowledge of the time machine, Tony successfully fixes the anomalies and travels back to the exact moment of his 25th birthday party. He is greeted by his friends and family, who have no recollection of the events that had transpired, but only Sarah, who somehow remembers everything. With her warm embrace, Tony resolves to make the most of his life from now on and discards the time machine, focusing on building a life together with Sarah. Chasing Time is a tale about self-discovery and self-acceptance. Set against the backdrop of inventive science fiction elements, the film explores the notion of living in the moment and learning to appreciate the value of relationships and the passage of time. It serves as a poignant reminder to cherish the present and continue moving forward, no matter how much we may yearn for the past."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant. You will be given a task.

Answer by taking a quote from the following article: Ellis-Bextor was born in London on 10 April 1979 to mother Janet Ellis, who was later a presenter on BBC's children's television programmes Blue Peter and Jigsaw, and father Robin Bextor, a film producer and director: they separated when she was four. As a young girl, she appeared on several Blue Peter items, with no indication given on-screen that she was Ellis's daughter. She attended St. Stephen's School and later Godolphin and Latymer School in Hammersmith. Her third album, Trip the Light Fantastic, was released in May 2007 and debuted at number seven on the UK Albums Chart. Fred Schneider of The B-52s, Richard Barone (formerly of The Bongos), Shelly Poole (formerly of Alisha's Attic), Cathy Dennis and Kerin Smith (formerly of Theaudience) contributed to produce an album of disco-pop music. Before the album, two singles were released: \\"Catch You\\", which charted in the UK at number eight, and \\"Me and My Imagination\\" (number twenty-three). The third single, \\"Today the Sun's on Us\\", debuted on the UK Singles Chart at number sixty-four.  Ellis-Bextor supported George Michael on his UK tour leg in June 2007. Her own UK tour, the Trip the Light Fantastic Tour, was due to start in August 2007, but it was postponed after Ellis-Bextor was invited to be the \\"special guest\\" on Take That's Beautiful World Tour, which commenced in October 2007. Ellis-Bextor stated that her tour would be rescheduled for March 2008, with all tickets purchased being valid for the rescheduled concerts. The tour was never rescheduled, and Ellis-Bextor subsequently refused to discuss the issue in interviews. In September 2007, Ellis-Bextor took part in Sopot Festival 2007 in Poland, representing the UK.  The song \\"If I Can't Dance\\" was announced as a single but later retracted, as was \\"Love Is Here\\"; Ellis-Bextor was supposed to release a single in late November to promote a greatest hits album, but the release date was pushed back to March 2008, and subsequently cancelled. However, \\"If I Can't Dance\\" has appeared on several compilations in Spain such as Supermodelo 2008 CD and Disco Estrella 2008.

Question: Article: Photography has been my interest ever since I was old enough to pick up a camera, but today I want to share with you the 15 most treasured photos of mine, and I didn't take any of them. There were no art directors, no stylists, no chance for reshoots, not even any regard for lighting. In fact, most of them were taken by random tourists. My story begins when I was in New York City for a speech, and my wife took a picture of me holding my daughter on her first birthday. We're on the corner of the 57thand 5thavenue. We happened to be back in New York exactly a year later, so we decided to take the same picture. Well you can see where this is going. Approaching my daughter's third birthday, my wife said, \\"Hey, why don't you take Sabina back to New York and make it a father-daughter trip, and continue the ceremony?\\" This is when we started asking passing tourists to take the picture. So these photos are far more than representatives for a single moment, or even a specific trip. They're also ways for us to freeze time for one week in October and reflect on our times and how we change from year to year, and nor just physically, but in every way. Because while we take the same photo, our viewpoints change, and she reaches new milestones and I get to see life through her eyes, and how she communicates with and sees everything.

The answer to the question: What is the last name of the person who was genuinely interested in other people's work, and surprisingly appreciative of music very far removed from his? is inside the article: The two sides to Poulenc's musical nature caused misunderstanding during his life and have continued to do so. The composer Ned Rorem observed, \\"He was deeply devout and uncontrollably sensual\\"; this still leads some critics to underrate his seriousness. His uncompromising adherence to melody, both in his lighter and serious works, has similarly caused some to regard him as unprogressive. Although he was not much influenced by new developments in music, Poulenc was always keenly interested in the works of younger generations of composers. Lennox Berkeley recalled, \\"Unlike some artists, he was genuinely interested in other people's work, and surprisingly appreciative of music very far removed from his. I remember him playing me the records of Boulez's Le marteau sans maître with which he was already familiar when that work was much less well-known than it is today.\\" Boulez did not take a reciprocal view, remarking in 2010, \\"There are always people who will take an easy intellectual path. Poulenc coming after Sacre [du Printemps]. It was not progress.\\" Other composers have found more merit in Poulenc's work; Stravinsky wrote to him in 1931: \\"You are truly good, and that is what I find again and again in your music\\".In his last years Poulenc observed, \\"if people are still interested in my music in 50 years' time it will be for my Stabat Mater rather than the Mouvements perpétuels.\\" In a centenary tribute in The Times Gerald Larner commented that Poulenc's prediction was wrong, and that in 1999 the composer was widely celebrated for both sides of his musical character: \\"both the fervent Catholic and the naughty boy, for both the Gloria and Les Biches, both Les Dialogues des Carmélites and Les Mamelles de Tirésias.\\" At around the same time the writer Jessica Duchen described Poulenc as \\"a fizzing, bubbling mass of Gallic energy who can move you to both laughter and tears within seconds. His language speaks clearly, directly and humanely to every generation.\\", can you guess it ?","output":"Yes, the last name of the person who was genuinely interested in other people's work, and surprisingly appreciative of music very far removed from his own is Poulenc, referring to the composer Francis Poulenc.

Article:","output":"Title: Doctor in Trouble for Slapping Patients and Talking Inappropriately Once upon a time, there was a doctor named Michael Clarke who was 47 years old. He was an orthopedic surgeon, which means he's a doctor who helps fix broken bones. Dr. Clarke was very good at his job, especially when it came to fixing hips. He worked in a hospital called Syracuse hospital. One day, some people found out that Dr. Clarke did some really bad things when his patients were fast asleep. You see, when people get surgery, they sometimes have to take special medicine called anesthesia to help them sleep so they won't feel any pain during the operation. Dr. Clarke would test if his patients were really asleep by winding his arm and slapping them on their backsides! He said he did this to see if the anesthesia was working, but other doctors and nurses said they had never seen anyone do this before. Not only did he do this to his patients, he also talked about inappropriate things with the staff in the surgery room. He talked about graphic and icky things that made people feel very uncomfortable and upset. When the hospital found out about these things that Dr. Clarke was doing, they didn't do anything to stop him. That was not good because now the hospital is also in trouble for not helping the patients. Today, Dr. Clarke is being investigated. That means people are trying to find out if he did even more bad things and if he should get in a lot of trouble. It's very important for doctors to be kind, gentle, and respectful to the people they are helping, and Dr. Clarke didn't follow those rules.

Summarize this article: In general, men should drink around 13 cups of water and other fluids daily (about 3 liters), and women should aim for 9 cups (2.2 liters). You can stick to the daily recommended amount of water during your water fast. Choose the purest water you can, or drink distilled water.  Don’t drink all that water at once! Spread out your water consumption throughout the day. Try setting out three 1-liter jugs every day, so you can see how much water you should drink. Don’t drink more water than the recommended amount, as this can throw off the balance of salt and minerals in your body and cause health problems. If you get strong hunger pangs, work through it by drinking 1-2 glasses of water. Then lie down and rest. The craving will usually pass. You can also try distracting yourself by reading or meditating. Break your fast with orange or lemon juice first. Then proceed to add foods to your diet gradually. Eat small amounts about every 2 hours, at first. Proceed in a stepwise process from easily digested foods to foods that are harder to digest. Depending on the length of your fast, you can spread this process out over one day or many days:  Fruit juice Vegetable juice Raw fruit and green leafy vegetables Yogurt Vegetable soup and cooked vegetables Cooked grains and beans Milk, dairy, and eggs Meat, fish, and poultry Everything else Fasting won’t help your health much if you return to eating high-fat and high-sugar foods afterwards.

Here is a question about this article: The British Empire comprised the dominions, colonies, protectorates, mandates and other territories ruled or administered by the United Kingdom. It originated with the overseas possessions and trading posts established by England between the late 16th and early 18th centuries. At its height, it was the largest empire in history and, for over a century, was the foremost global power. By 1922 the British Empire held sway over about 458 million people, one-fifth of the world's population at the time, and covered more than 13,000,000 sq mi (33,670,000 km2), almost a quarter of the Earth's total land area. As a result, its political, legal, linguistic and cultural legacy is widespread. At the peak of its power, the phrase \\"the empire on which the sun never sets\\" was often used to describe the British Empire, because its expanse around the globe meant that the sun was always shining on at least one of its territories.

A: jordan doesnt give up  B: pessimistic about the dog being found  C: optimistic about finding the cat A:","output":"After searching high and low for his lost puppy and not being able to find it, Jordan would most likely feel a mix of emotions. Considering the options given, the most accurate answer to the question according to the context would be: B: Pessimistic about the dog being found. The reasoning behind this choice can be explained through a thorough analysis of each option provided: A: Jordan doesn't give up - This option suggests that Jordan is persistent and not easily deterred. Even though these qualities could be true, the answer does not directly address how Jordan would feel in the situation presented in the context. It more so focuses on Jordan's behavior or actions instead of his emotions. B: Pessimistic about the dog being found - Pessimism refers to an outlook that anticipates negative outcomes or events. Given that Jordan could not find his lost puppy after searching extensively, it is natural for him to feel disheartened. This in turn could make him feel pessimistic about his chances of ever finding the dog. This answer aligns more closely with the context and addresses Jordan's emotional state in the aftermath of his unsuccessful search. C: Optimistic about finding the cat - This option not only deviates from the context by introducing a cat instead of a lost puppy, but it also does not address what Jordan's emotions would be after not finding his lost pet. Additionally, if Jordan were optimistic, it would seem more likely to be about finding the dog and not a cat. Thus, upon careful examination, option B: pessimistic about the dog being found, best describes how Jordan would most likely feel after his unsuccessful search for his lost puppy, according to the context provided."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Hint: An apex predator, also known as an alpha predator or top predator, is a predator at the top of a food chain, with no natural predators.Apex predators are usually defined in terms of trophic dynamics, meaning that they occupy the highest trophic levels. Food chains are often far shorter on land, usually limited to being secondary consumers – for example, wolves prey mostly upon large herbivores (primary consumers), which eat plants (primary producers). The apex predator concept is applied in wildlife management, conservation and ecotourism. Answer:","output":"Fox learned less about wolves."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant. You will be given a task. You must generate a detailed and long answer. You are given a new situation: David is a physicist. He teaches school children how matters and energy work. One day he was teaching them about two particles of matter, particle A and particle B. Particle A moves faster, but particle B moves slower. He was showing the children about different characteristics of moving particles.  and a hint : No doubt you already have a good idea of what temperature is. You might say that it’s how warm or cool something feels. In physics, temperature is defined as the average kinetic energy of the particles of matter. When particles of matter move more quickly, they have more kinetic energy, so their temperature is higher. With a higher temperature, matter feels warmer. When particles move more slowly, they have less kinetic energy on average, so their temperature is lower. With a lower temperature, matter feels cooler.  Please answer this question : Which particle would have higher temperature, particle A or particle B? Answer:","output":"Particle A would have a higher temperature than particle B. This is because temperature in physics is defined as the average kinetic energy of the particles of matter. The faster a particle moves, the more kinetic energy it possesses.  In the given situation, David is teaching the children that particle A moves faster than particle B. As a result, particle A would have more kinetic energy compared to particle B. Since temperature is directly proportional to the average kinetic energy of the particles, particle A would exhibit a higher temperature compared to particle B. Consequently, particle A would feel warmer than particle B.  To make this concept more relatable for the children, David could use everyday examples such as a hot cup of tea and an ice cube. The tea feels hot because the particles in it are moving fast, possessing more kinetic energy and thus exhibiting a higher temperature. On the other hand, the particles in the ice cube are moving slower, with less kinetic energy, resulting in a lower temperature and feeling cooler to the touch. To further clarify the relationship between the speed of particles and their temperature, David could introduce the concept of thermal energy transfer. When two objects at different temperatures come into contact, thermal energy (heat) transfers from the object with a higher temperature to the object with a lower temperature. This transfer occurs due to the movement of particles: faster-moving particles (with more kinetic energy) transfer some of their energy to the slower-moving particles (with less kinetic energy), causing the objects to eventually reach an equilibrium temperature. In conclusion, in the given situation, particle A would have a higher temperature than particle B, since it moves faster and possesses more kinetic energy. By using real-world examples, David can effectively teach the children about the relationship between particle movement, kinetic energy, and temperature, and how thermal energy transfer occurs between particles at different temperatures."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant that follows instruction extremely well.

Sponsored Stories, the social ads that are currently restricted to the right-hand side of the page, will start appearing in your news feed at a rate of not more than one per day. The stories will all relate to your friends or pages you “like,” such as a friend “liking” a company’s page, playing a game app, or checking in at a business. Reactions: This is basically “the holy grail for advertisers,” writes Josh Constine on TechCrunch, because the ads will appear directly alongside “organic social content”—and will look very similar to that content. Though some users are sure to be “outraged”—there’s no way to opt out of having your activity used in these ads—Constine notes that social ads are much more relevant to users than traditional ads. Facebook probably won’t stop with the News Feed, the CEO of a social-engagement ad firm tells Ad Age. Ultimately, he predicts, the social networking site will deliver similar ads on third-party sites or streaming TV shows. \\"We really see Facebook becoming the operating system of the internet for ad delivery in the future,\\" he says. This plan is a surefire money-maker for Facebook and a “boon for advertisers,” as Sponsored Stories are sure to have “much higher click-through rates and conversions than units on the side of the page,” writes Brittany Darwell on Inside Facebook.

The prime advantage is that social ads have the potential to be much more relevant to users than traditional advertisements. Although there is no way for users to opt out of having their activity included in Sponsored Stories, the high degree of personalization these ads offer is likely to make them more attractive to users.  Despite the anticipated backlash from some users who may feel outraged by the inability to opt out, the integration of Sponsored Stories into the news feed is expected to become the standard, and may not drastically change how most people use the site.

Freedom of conscience had high priority on the theological, philosophical, and political agendas since Luther refused to recant his beliefs before the Diet of the Holy Roman Empire at Worms (1521). In his view, faith was a free work of the Holy Spirit and could, therefore, not be forced on a person. The persecuted Anabaptists and Huguenots demanded freedom of conscience, and they practised separation of church and state. In the early seventeenth century, Baptists like John Smyth and Thomas Helwys published tracts in defense of religious freedom. Their thinking influenced John Milton and John Locke's stance on tolerance. Under the leadership of Baptist Roger Williams, Congregationalist Thomas Hooker, and Quaker William Penn, respectively, Rhode Island, Connecticut, and Pennsylvania combined democratic constitutions with freedom of religion. These colonies became safe havens for persecuted religious minorities, including Jews. The United States Declaration of Independence, the United States Constitution, and the American Bill of Rights with its fundamental human rights made this tradition permanent by giving it a legal and political framework. The great majority of American Protestants, both clergy and laity, strongly supported the independence movement. All major Protestant churches were represented in the First and Second Continental Congresses. In the nineteenth and twentieth centuries, the American democracy became a model for numerous other countries and regions throughout the world (e.g., Latin America, Japan, and Germany). The strongest link between the American and French Revolutions was Marquis de Lafayette, an ardent supporter of the American constitutional principles. The French Declaration of the Rights of Man and of the Citizen was mainly based on Lafayette's draft of this document. The United Nations Declaration and Universal Declaration of Human Rights also echo the American constitutional tradition.

West Point was established in 1775 by George Washington who considered it the most important strategic position in America. Until January 1778, West Point was not occupied by the military. On January 27, 1778, Brigadier General Samuel Holden Parsons and his brigade crossed the ice on the Hudson River and climbed to the plain on West Point and from that day to the present, West Point has been occupied by the United States Army. It comprises approximately including the campus of the United States Military Academy at West Point, which is also frequently called \\"West Point\\". It is a Census Designated Place (CDP) located in the Town of Highlands in Orange County, New York, located on the western bank of the Hudson River. The population was 6,763 at the 2010 census. It is part of the New York-Newark-Jersey City, NY-NJ-PA Metropolitan Statistical Area as well as the larger New York-Newark, NY-NJ-CT-PA Combined Statistical Area.  - South West England is one of nine official regions of England. It is the largest in area, covering and the counties of Gloucestershire, Bristol, Wiltshire, Somerset, Dorset, Devon and Cornwall, as well as the Isles of Scilly. Five million people live in South West England.  - The Severn Estuary is the estuary of the River Severn, the longest river in Great Britain. It is at the mouth of four major rivers, being the Severn, Wye, Usk and Avon, and other smaller rivers. Its high tidal range of about means that it has been at the centre of discussions in the UK regarding renewable energy.  - The Massachusetts Bay Colony (16281691) was an English settlement on the east coast of North America in the 17th century in and around the broad opening of Massachusetts Bay, the northernmost predecessor colony of the several colonies later reorganized as the \\"Province of Massachusetts Bay\\". The lands of the settlement were located in central New England in what is now Massachusetts, with initial settlements situated on two natural harbors and surrounding land, about apartthe areas around the present-day cities of Salem and Boston.  The territory nominally administered by the colony included much of present-day central New England, including portions of the U.S. states of Massachusetts, Maine, New Hampshire, Rhode Island, and Connecticut. Territory claimed but never administered by the colonial government extended as far west as the Pacific Ocean. The earlier Dutch colony of New Netherlands disputed many of these claims, arguing that they held rights to lands beyond Rhode Island up to the western side of Cape Cod and the Plymouth Bay Colony.   - There are more than 30 islands in the Bay; the three largest ones are Aquidneck Island, Conanicut Island, and Prudence Island. Bodies of water that are part of Narragansett Bay include the Sakonnet River, Mount Hope Bay, and the southern, tidal part of the Taunton River. The bay opens on Rhode Island Sound and the Atlantic Ocean; Block Island lies less than 20 miles (32 km) southwest of its opening. Narragansett Bay can be seen in NOAA chart 13221  - The American Revolutionary War (17751783), also referred to as the American War of Independence and the Revolutionary War in the United States, was an armed conflict between Great Britain and thirteen of its North American colonies that after onset of the war declared independence as the United States of America.  - Yeovil is a town and civil parish in south Somerset, England with a population of 45,000.

There are 50 states, which are bound together in a union with each other. Each state holds administrative jurisdiction over a defined geographic territory, and shares its sovereignty with the United States federal government. Due to the shared sovereignty between each state and the federal government, Americans are citizens of both the federal republic and of the state in which they reside. State citizenship and residency are flexible, and no government approval is required to move between states, except for persons covered by certain types of court orders (e.g., paroled convicts and children of divorced spouses who are sharing custody).  - Maine is the northernmost state in the New England region of the northeastern United States. Maine is the 39th most extensive and the 41st most populous of the U.S. states and territories. It is bordered by New Hampshire to the west, the Atlantic Ocean to the east, and the Canadian provinces of New Brunswick and Quebec to the north. Maine is the easternmost state in the contiguous United States, and the northernmost east of the Great Lakes. It is known for its jagged, rocky coastline; low, rolling mountains; heavily forested interior, and picturesque waterways; and also its seafood cuisine, especially clams and lobster. There is a continental climate throughout the state, even in coastal areas such as its most populous city of Portland. The capital is Augusta.  - The Thirteen Colonies were a group of British colonies on the east coast of North America founded in the 17th and 18th centuries that declared independence in 1776 and formed the United States. The thirteen were: Delaware, Pennsylvania, New Jersey, Georgia, Connecticut, Massachusetts Bay, Maryland, South Carolina, New Hampshire, Virginia, New York, North Carolina, and Rhode Island and Providence Plantations.  - Limington is a village and parish in Somerset, England, situated north of Yeovil in the South Somerset district.

The parish includes the hamlet of Draycott.  - Greater Boston is the metropolitan region of New England encompassing the municipality of Boston, the capital of the U.S. state of Massachusetts and the most populous city in New England, as well as its surrounding areas. The region forms the northern arc of the U.S. northeast megalopolis and as such, Greater Boston can be described as either a metropolitan statistical area (MSA), or as a broader combined statistical area (CSA). The MSA consists of most of the eastern third of Massachusetts, excluding the South Coast region and Cape Cod; while the CSA additionally includes the municipalities of Manchester (the largest city in the U.S. state of New Hampshire), Providence (the capital of the U.S. state of Rhode Island), Worcester, Massachusetts (the second largest city in New England), as well as the South Coast region and Cape Cod in Massachusetts. Greater Boston's most impactful contributions to human civilization involve the region's higher education institutions and sports culture. Greater Boston also constitutes a region influential upon American history and industry. The region and the state of Massachusetts are global leaders in biotechnology, engineering, higher education, finance, and maritime trade.  - The Pacific Ocean is the largest of the Earth's oceanic divisions. It extends from the Arctic Ocean in the north to the Southern Ocean (or, depending on definition, to Antarctica) in the south and is bounded by Asia and Australia in the west and the Americas in the east.  - Rhode Island, officially the State of Rhode Island and Providence Plantations, is a state in the New England region of the northeastern United States.

Fredericton is the capital, Moncton is the largest metropolitan (CMA) area and Saint John is the most populous city. In the 2011 nationwide census, Statistics Canada estimated the provincial population to have been 751,171, being on an area of almost 73,000 km. The majority of the population is English-speaking, but there is also a large Francophone minority (33%), chiefly of Acadian origin. The current premier of the province is Brian Gallant. It was created as a result of the partitioning of the British colony of Nova Scotia in 1784. The provincial flag features a ship superimposed on a yellow background with a yellow \\"lion passant guardant\\" on red pennon above it.  - The Hudson River is a river that flows from north to south primarily through eastern New York in the United States. The river originates in the Adirondack Mountains of Upstate New York, flows through the Hudson Valley, and eventually drains into the Atlantic Ocean, between New York City and Jersey City. The river serves as a political boundary between the states of New Jersey and New York, and further north between New York counties. The lower half of the river is a tidal estuary occupying the Hudson Fjord, which formed during the most recent period of North American glaciation, estimated at 26,000 to 13,300 years ago. Tidal waters influence the Hudson's flow from as far north as Troy.  - The Province of Massachusetts Bay was a crown colony in British North America and, from 1776, one of the thirteen original states of the United States.

In some cases a river flows into the ground and becomes dry at the end of its course without reaching another body of water. Small rivers can be referred to using names such as stream, creek, brook, rivulet, and rill. There are no official definitions for the generic term river as applied to geographic features, although in some countries or communities a stream is defined by its size. Many names for small rivers are specific to geographic location; examples are \\"run\\" in some parts of the United States, \\"burn\\" in Scotland and northeast England, and \\"beck\\" in northern England. Sometimes a river is defined as being larger than a creek, but not always: the language is vague.  - Dorset (or archaically, Dorsetshire) is a county in South West England on the English Channel coast.

It takes its name from the English city of Bristol, and is over 30 miles (50 km) across at its widest point.  - Benedict Arnold ( 21 December 1615 -- 19 June 1678 ) was president and then governor of the Colony of Rhode Island and Providence Plantations , serving for a total of 11 years in these roles . Coming from Somerset , England , he was born and raised in the town of Ilchester , likely attending school in Limington , nearby . In 1635 , at the age of 19 , he accompanied his parents , siblings and other family members on a voyage from England to New England , where they first settled in Hingham in the Massachusetts Bay Colony . In less than a year they moved to Providence on the Narragansett Bay at the request of Roger Williams . In about 1638 they moved once again , about five miles south to the Pawtuxet River , settling on the north side at a place commonly called Pawtuxet . Here they had serious disputes with their neighbors , particularly Samuel Gorton , and as a result put themselves and their lands under the jurisdiction of Massachusetts , a situation lasting for 16 years . Learning the native languages at an early age , Arnold became one of the two leading interpreters in the Rhode Island colony , Roger Williams being the other . He was frequently called upon to interpret during negotiations with the natives , but on one occasion was accused by them of misrepresentation . In 1651 Arnold left Providence and Pawtuxet with his family , settling in Newport where he began his public service which would last continuously until his death . He quickly became a freeman , Commissioner , and Assistant , and in 1657 succeeded Roger Williams as President of the colony , serving for three years . In 1662 he was once again elected President , and during the second year of this term the Royal Charter of 1663 was delivered from England , naming him as the first Governor of the colony , and offering broad freedoms and self - determination to the colony . A bold and decisive leader , Arnold was elected for two additional terms as governor , the last time following the devastation of King Philip 's War . He died on 19 June 1678...  - Connecticut is the southernmost state in the New England region of the northeastern United States.

Movie title: Nuovo Cinema Paradiso Movie plot: In Rome, in the 1980s, famous Italian film director Salvatore Di Vita returns home late one evening, where his girlfriend sleepily tells him that his mother called to say someone named Alfredo has died. Salvatore obviously shies from committed relationships and has not been to his home village of Giancaldo, Sicily in 30 years. As his girlfriend asks him who Alfredo is, Salvatore flashes back to his childhood. It is a few years after World War II. Six-year-old Salvatore is the mischievous, intelligent son of a war widow. Nicknamed Toto, he discovers a love for films and spends every free moment at the movie house Cinema Paradiso. Although they initially start off on tense terms, he develops a friendship with the fatherly projectionist, Alfredo, who takes a shine to the young boy and often lets him watch movies from the projection booth. During the shows, the audience can be heard booing when there are missing sections, causing the films to suddenly jump, bypassing a critical romantic kiss or embrace. The local priest had ordered these sections censored, and the deleted scenes are piled on the projection room floor. At first, Alfredo considers Toto a bit of a pest, but eventually he teaches Salvatore to operate the film projector.

Jackson denied the claims and settled the civil case out of court for a payment of 15 million plus legal fees; the settlement included a nondisclosure agreement. No criminal charges were filed. In 2005, following further allegations, prompted by the 2003 documentary Living with Michael Jackson in which he was holding hands with a boy named Gavin Arvizo and talked about his sleepovers with children, Jackson was acquitted of child sexual abuse charges.In 2013, choreographer Wade Robson filed a civil lawsuit alleging that Jackson had sexually abused him for seven years, beginning when he was seven years old. In 2014, a case was filed by James Safechuck after seeing an interview with Robson, alleging sexual abuse over a four-year period from the age of ten. Both had previously testified in defense of Jackson — Safechuck as a child during the 1993 investigation, Robson both as a child in 1993 and as a young adult in 2005. In 2015, Robson's case against Jackson's estate was dismissed on the grounds that it had been filed too late, and in 2017 it was ruled that neither of the corporate entities formerly owned by Jackson could be held accountable for Jackson's alleged actions.In the film, Robson, Safechuck, and their respective families describe their relationship with Jackson.

Article: Explaining the science      \\"You use a process which is called de-extinction, in which a biological agent is applied to the hair in the form of liquid and you extract certain genetic information from it,\\" Gorjanc explains to The Telegraph, \\"and then you use that information to reprogram already existing skin so it is the exact texture and colour and everything of the original source, so in this case McQueen's skin. It also depends on how much the hair sample is preserved as to how much information you can extract - fortunately McQueen's hair was preserved in a good state.\\"      \\"You can grow the skin using different techniques,\\" Gorjanc elaborates. \\"We did it in a Petri dish in the laboratory, and you put liquid treatments and nutrients on the skin so it expands. After that when you want to create leather out of it, you actually need to kill the cells and the first layer and so apply a lot of heat onto it to preserve it. When the material is done and you have leather.\\"      She adds: \\"This process protects the biological information so you are not able to extract any more biological information from the leather, because the cells are dead. It is a typical technique that they use for any other leather.\\" You could also use bio-printing to create this material, but that is more expensive. ||||| Alexander McQueen, the celebrated fashion designer who committed suicide in 2010, liked to provoke. His 2001 asylum-themed collection, for example, culminated with a fleshy, nude woman reclining in a glass cube, breathing through tubes connected to a face mask as large live moths fluttered around her.      So it’s reasonable to think he would have approved of a new project based, literally, on his life. Tina Gorjanc, who is just finishing the material futures program at McQueen’s alma mater, London’s famous fashion school Central Saint Martins, is working on a project that will use McQueen’s DNA to grow skin, which she plans to tan and turn into leather jackets and bags. The skin will even bear tattoos based on the exact “locations, size, and design,” of McQueen’s, she says.      Tina Gorjanc “Love looks not with the eyes, / But with the mind”      The lab manipulated the genes that control freckles and moles as well, and the skin can get sunburned. “With the tattoos and manipulation of freckles and sunburning, I wanted to showcase the material,” Gorjanc explains. “I think that was really important in terms of getting this connection between the jacket and McQueen.” Recently she presented her “Pure Human” project in an exhibition, using products made of pig skin to show what the final items could look like.      Gorjanc’s project is intended to raise questions about how corporations might one day exploit genetic information for luxury goods, and to showcase how little protection exists for a person’s DNA. In May, she filed an application to patent, as she describes it, “bioengineered genetic material that is grown in the lab using tissue-engineering technology and the process of de-extinction.” De-extinction allows you to extract genetic material from a deceased source.      She’s not able to patent McQueen’s DNA itself, but says if she is granted the patent, she would “have ownership of this material that includes Alexander McQueen’s genetic information.” She also filed a second patent for the process, separate from any connection to McQueen.      Though she has been approached by some who want to produce the items for sale, Gorjanc says the finished products would more likely be displayed in a gallery. She would consider selling them to a collector, but is more focused on the technology, which might be useful in creating sustainable, lab-grown leather that doesn’t require slaughtering animals.      The DNA to grow the human skin will come from McQueen’s hair, which he used in his 1992 collection, “Jack the Ripper Stalks His Victims.” It referenced the Victorian era, when prostitutes would sell locks of their hair that people would purchase to give to their lovers. McQueen confirmed in interviews that it was his own hair he used, and Gorjanc spoke to a friend and model of McQueen’s who was with him when he put the hair in the labels, so she says she’s reasonably sure it is authentic. The institution that owns the collection—she wouldn’t say which it is—has agreed to give her a sample of the hair.      Tina Gorjanc One day, this might be made from genuine McQueen skin.      Gorjanc, who has a long fascination with biotechnology, got the idea for the project after reading about the case of Henrietta Lacks, a poor, black tobacco farmer in the US whose cells were taken without her knowledge in 1951. Those cells have since been vital to medical research on everything from the polio vaccine to cloning. Her story was told by Rebecca Skloot in the hugely popular book, The Immortal Life of Henrietta Lacks.      Tina Gorjanc Backpack with freckles and moles.      Gorjanc also found out that luxury companies are investing in bioengineering, though she says it’s mostly for the purpose of testing cosmetics on skin and to reduce animal testing.      How much ownership a person has over their genetic information is still a fuzzy area of law. In 1984, for instance, a doctor in the US patented a cell line derived from the tissue of a man named John Moore. Moore, who didn’t know his tissue was being used, lost his legal battle to win the rights to the patent.      Glenn Cohen, an expert on the intersection of bioethics and law at Harvard Law School, says it’s “very common” for researchers to take tissue and use it for research. These days, however, patients are usually asked to sign a form agreeing to give away those biospecimens and relinquish any commercial interest, he says.      In the US, you also have no ownership of “abandoned” tissue, such as hair left on the floor after a haircut, though again, nobody can patent the DNA itself.      Ownership law in the UK is even less stringent. “The standard rule in the UK is that there’s no ownership property right of human tissue,” says Dr. Jeff Skopek, a lecturer in medical law, ethics, and policy at University of Cambridge. “So McQueen didn’t own his hair, technically. That’s what’s called the ‘common law property rule.'”      Gorjanc says she consulted with a patent attorney, and that what she’s doing is “completely legal.” But she, or anyone else in the UK attempting to use a deceased person’s DNA, likely faces legal challenges, according to Skopek. The UK’s Human Tissue Act, for instance, often demands a person give informed consent before their tissues can be used. McQueen did not in this case. Gorjanc may need approval from a research ethics committee. The Data Protection Act might also apply.      There’s more leeway if the tissue is anonymous, but in this case, it is very much not.

Though Gorjanc says she has been in touch with the Alexander McQueen brand, the company says it did not have prior knowledge of the project. “Contrary to some press reports the company wasn’t approached about this project nor have we ever endorsed it,” a spokesperson said. McQueen had no children, though his father and five siblings (paywall) survived him.      Gorjanc says she did get some feedback from those who knew McQueen. “People that were really close to him or that worked for his institution said that he might actually like the idea,” she says. “He was always pushing the boundaries and always trying to break laws in fashion.”      An earlier version of this story quoted Gorjanc saying she spoke with the Alexander McQueen label about the project and got a positive reaction. Quartz had reached out to the label but had not received a reply at publication time. After this story was published, the company reached out to say that Gorjanc had never approached them about the project. ||||| What is a summary?","output":"So, imagine there's a person named Alexander McQueen who was a famous fashion designer, but he's not with us anymore. There's another person named Tina Gorjanc who is a student at a school for fancy fashion design, and she's doing a very special project. Tina came up with an idea to use a little part of McQueen, his hair, to create something new and interesting.  With the help of science, she wants to grow a kind of skin from McQueen's hair and then turn it into leather that can be made into jackets and bags. The special part is that the leather would have tattoos, freckles, and even get sunburned like McQueen's real skin!  The aim of this project is not just to make cool things with McQueen's skin, but also to make people think about how our personal information, like our DNA, can be used in the future, and to explore the possibility of creating leather in labs so that no animals have to be hurt."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

However, the word \\"fiascos\\" has a negative connotation as it implies a chaotic and poorly executed situation. The combination of these terms creates a mixed impression where the positive aspect (feel-good) is being overwhelmed or compromised by the negative aspect (fiascos). 2. \\"Like Antwone Fisher\\": Antwone Fisher is a movie based on a true story about a man overcoming his troubled past, which many people view as an inspiring and positive narrative. However, by associating it with \\"feel-good fiascos,\\" the implication is that the movie might be seen as a failed or disappointing take on the feel-good genre. In conclusion, the given phrase leans more towards the negative side, given the use of the term \\"fiascos\\" and its association with an inspiring movie like Antwone Fisher.

A prologue explains the role of the bounty hunter. A wanted criminal named Burch tries to ambush bounty hunter Jim Kipp, but Kipp gets the better of him. Kipp takes Burch's corpse into town to collect the reward. A representative of the Pinkerton Detective Agency asks Kipp to hunt a trio of fugitives. Three masked men committed a robbery and fled with 100,000. Kipp, who has the reputation that he will do anything for money, is offered a huge reward if he can capture the culprits dead or alive. Kipp rides into the town of Twin Forks, and uses an alias. He seeks information about one fugitive's wounds from Dr. Spencer, who is wary of revealing too much. Kipp is immediately attracted to the doctor's daughter, Julie. A limping man named Bill Rachin, who works at the hotel, draws Kipp's suspicion. So does George Williams, a card dealer. Williams' wife, Alice, flirts with Kipp and tries to coax information out of him. Kipp does not reveal the purpose for his visit. Vance Edwards identifies Kipp and his reputation as a bounty hunter.  Edwards mistakenly believes Kipp is seeking him for another crime. The townspeople become anxious as the truth about Kipp becomes known. Led by the postmaster, Danvers, they offer Kipp a bribe to leave town.
