Just after he bought the house with his ill gotten gains from his band's over-hyped, over-marketed, and over-bought sophomore Disc, he drove me out to see it in his beautiful but nauseating '70 Datsun 240 Z. All the smog combined with the pinball effects of winding up the hill at teeth-numbing speeds had me puking for an hour after we got there. I took the last turn at the top of the hill and watched the rising sun crest over the black blocks of the city, her angel wings soiled and cheapened with the soot of 12 million get-away drivers. Rick's house came into view out of the fog, its large glass panes sparkling like the last clean surface of an oversized ashtray. I parked between a blue hatchback and Rick's favorite toy: a 350 horsepower Impreza he had smuggled here from Japan. All his more expensive rides were in the garage, collecting dust and gaining vintage resale value. I rang the bell. I waited and watched a couple of squirrels fight over a small treasure in the bushes.

He was wondering how that change in rainfall might have helped emerge the Egyptian civilization.  Given the paragraph above, please answer correctly the following question:   Would era B see less or more rocks with chemical reactions than era A? The answer to this question is:","output":"To answer the question correctly, I will first analyze the provided information and consider the possible factors that could influence the number of rocks with chemical reactions in each era. Step 1: Understanding the differences between Era A and Era B - Era A: 10,000 years ago, plenty of rainfall in the Sahara region - Era B: 8,000 years ago, less rainfall in the Sahara region Step 2: Identifying factors that could influence chemical reactions in rocks - Water presence: Water is a key factor in chemical reactions involving rocks because it can help dissolve minerals and facilitate reactions between them. In Era A, there was plenty of rainfall, meaning there was more water available for these reactions to occur. In Era B, the decrease in rainfall would result in less water available for these chemical reactions. Step 3: Considering the influence of the Egyptian civilization on era B - The emergence of the Egyptian civilization in relation with era B could lead to an increase in human activity, such as construction, mining, and agriculture, influencing the frequency of chemical reactions in rocks. However, this factor may not be as significant as the availability of water in the environment. Step 4: Concluding based on the most significant factor Since the availability of water is the most significant factor in determining the number of rocks with chemical reactions, era B would likely see fewer rocks with chemical reactions than era A, due to the decrease in rainfall in the region. The answer to this question is: Era B would see less rocks with chemical reactions than era A."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant that follows instruction extremely well.

Despite initial disagreements (mainly contrasting Vin's idealistic attitude to class differences with Carol's practical altruism) they fall in love. Vin proposes to Carol in front of his family at home after his younger brother prods him to give a less romantic but more honest proposal.Several months later, as the war comes closer to home with the bombing of Great Brittan, Vin feels he must \\"do his bit\\" and enlists in the Royal Air Force, qualifying as a fighter pilot.

I have a new situation: Robert was watching the local news when he saw a report about a wildfire. The report stated that there was a brush fire in the southwest part of Texas, where it was currently daytime. When he switched the channel, he saw another report about a different wildfire. This one was a forest fire in the northwest part of Seattle, where it was currently nighttime.  But I can use this background: Wildfire intensity increases during daytime hours. For example, burn rates of smoldering logs are up to five times greater during the day because of lower humidity, increased temperatures, and increased wind speeds. Sunlight warms the ground during the day and causes air currents to travel uphill, and downhill during the night as the land cools. Wildfires are fanned by these winds and often follow the air currents over hills and through valleys. United States wildfire operations revolve around a 24-hour fire day that begins at 10:00 a.m. because of the predictable increase in intensity resulting from the daytime warmth.  What is an answer for this question: Which wildfire, the one in Texas or the one in Seattle, will have higher intensity? The answer to this question is:","output":"The wildfire in Texas will likely have a higher intensity than the one in Seattle, based on the information provided. There are several factors that contribute to this conclusion. Firstly, the Texas wildfire is occurring during daytime hours. As mentioned in the background information, wildfire intensity generally increases during the day due to lower humidity, increased temperatures, and increased wind speeds. These conditions make it easier for the fire to spread and intensify. Sunlight warms the ground, which causes air currents to travel uphill and fan the flames. This typical daytime scenario in Texas would lead to a higher intensity wildfire compared to one occurring during nighttime hours, such as the one in Seattle. Secondly, the Texas fire is described as a brush fire, whereas the Seattle fire is a forest fire. While both types of fires can be destructive, brush fires tend to spread more quickly and intensely because of the lighter, more flammable fuel (dry grass and shrubs) they typically consume. The larger, denser materials found in a forest fire, such as trees, can take more time to burn and spread. This difference in fuel type would also contribute to the Texas fire being more intense than the one in Seattle. Additionally, the location of the fires may play a role in their intensities. While the exact environmental conditions at each site are not provided, we can make some general assumptions based on the regions involved. Southwest Texas has a semi-arid to arid climate, with lower humidity, higher temperatures, and more direct sunlight compared to that of the northwest part of Seattle which is known for its temperate marine climate, involving higher humidity, cooler temperatures, and more cloud cover. Under these climate conditions, a fire in Texas would likely have a higher intensity due to the more favorable conditions for the fire to spread and intensify. In conclusion, based on the information provided, the wildfire in southwest Texas is expected to have a higher intensity than the wildfire in northwest Seattle. Factors contributing to this conclusion include the time of day when the fires are occurring, the type of fires (brush fire versus forest fire), and the regional climate conditions."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

On Friday said he wouldn't seek to repeal civil rights legislation.      On the oil spill, Paul, a libertarian and tea party darling, said he had heard nothing from BP indicating it wouldn't pay for the spill that threatens devastating environmental damage along the coast of the Gulf of Mexico.      \\"And I think it's part of this sort of blame-game society in the sense that it's always got to be somebody's fault instead of the fact that maybe sometimes accidents happen,\\" Paul said.      The senate candidate referred to a Kentucky coal mine accident that killed two men, saying he had met with the families and he admired the coal miners' courage.      \\"We had a mining accident that was very tragic. ... Then we come in and it's always someone's fault. Maybe sometimes accidents happen,\\" he said.      The political novice came under blistering scrutiny little more than 24 hours a landslide Republican primary victory. He defeated a rival recruited by Senate GOP leader Mitch McConnell, and invited Obama, who never enjoyed popularity in the state, to campaign for Kentucky's Democratic candidates as a strategy toward a Republican win in November.      Paul, 47 and an eye surgeon, is making his first run for public office, and his emergence as a favorite of tea party activists has been one of the most striking developments of the early months of the midterm election campaign. In an appearance on primary night, he credited their support with powering him to his victory, and the first opinion poll since then shows him with a commanding lead over his Democratic rival, Jack Conway. ||||| Rand Paul, the Tea Party's rising star from Kentucky who won the state's GOP Senate primary this week, says criticism of his views on the Civil Rights Act and other pieces of anti-discrimination legislation are \\"red herrings\\" and Democrats' attempt to \\"trash\\" his campaign.      \\"When does my honeymoon period start? I had a big victory,\\" Paul told George Stephanopoulos on \\"Good Morning America\\" today. \\"I've just been trashed up and down and they have been saying things that are untrue. And when they say I'm for repealing the Civil Rights Act, it's absolutely false. It's never been my position and something that I basically just think is politics.\\"      Play      Paul's comments came amid a firestorm of criticism sparked earlier this week when he appeared to question the 1964 Civil Rights Act, which he said went too far in banning discrimination by private companies.      In an interview Wednesday with MSNBC's Rachel Maddow, Paul was asked whether he believed private businesses should have the right to refuse service to African-Americans.      \\"Yes,\\" Paul said. \\"I'm not in favor of any discrimination of any form. … But I think what's important about this debate is not written into any specific 'gotcha' on this, but asking the question: what about freedom of speech? Should we limit speech from people we find abhorrent? Should we limit racists from speaking?\\"      His comments drew a range of criticism, including a rebuke from the White House Thursday, with press secretary Robert Gibbs telling reporters, \\"a discussion about whether or not you support those I don't think has a real, shouldn't have a place in our political dialogue in 2010.\\"      Republicans also seemed to distance themselves from Paul's views. Republican National Committee chairman Michael Steele made it clear the GOP supports the Civil Rights Act, whatever its Senate nominee in Kentucky says.      Paul has said he doesn't believe the government has the right to tell a private business who they have to serve but insists he has not -- and has never -- called for a repeal of the law.      \\"If you want to bring up 40-year-old legislation, why don't you bring me on with Sen. [Robert] Byrd, and we'll talk about how he filibustered the Civil Rights Act,\\" he said of the 92-year-old West Virginia Democrat. \\"Make him, call him to task for something he actually did as opposed to calling me to task for something they insinuated that I might believe that's not true.      \\"What is going on here is an attempt to vilify us for partisan reasons. Where do your talking points come from? The Democratic National Committee, they also come from Rachel Maddow and MSNBC.\\"      Paul Slams Obama Administration for Treatment of BP      Paul's political philosophy, which is shared by many members of the Tea Party movement, emphasizes a more limited role of the federal government in U.S. business and society.      Earlier this year, for example, Paul told the Fox Business Channel that he believes government agencies should reduce their regulation of the energy industry. \\"Get the EPA out of our coal business down here, get OSHA out of our small businesses. We need to restrain government to let small businesses create jobs,\\" he said.      Paul affirmed the comments on \\"Good Morning America,\\" saying that he finds the Environmental Protection Agency's recent regulatory initiative on greenhouse gas emissions, independent of Congress, \\"particularly galling.\\"      \\"I think that's a regulatory commission run amok and I think we need to have congressional oversight,\\" he said. \\"I don't think regulatory agencies should write regulations without approval of the people through their representatives. And I stick to that and that's absolutely my point of view.\\"      The Kentucky Senate candidate also criticized the Obama administration's treatment of BP in the wake of the ongoing Gulf of Mexico oil spill.      \\"What I don't like from the president's administration is this sort of, 'I'll put my boot heel on the throat of BP.' I think that sounds really un-American in his criticism of business,\\" he said. \\"I've heard nothing from BP about not paying for the spill. And I think it's part of this sort of blame game society in the sense that it's always got to be someone's fault instead of the fact that sometimes accidents happen.\\"      Paul's Civil Rights Comments Could Embolden Tea Party Critics      The controversy over Paul's comments on federal civil rights legislation has revived suggestions by Tea Party critics that there are racists in the movement, an allegation Paul denies.      The most recent ABC News polls show the perception of racial prejudice in the movement exists, particularly among the movement's opponents. Among all Americans, 28 percent see racial prejudice against President Obama as a substantial factor in support for the Tea Party movement.      Paul clarified his views in a written statement Thursday, saying whatever concerns he may have had about parts of the Civil Rights Act, he has not -- and has never -- called for repealing it.      \\"Even though this matter was settled when I was 2, and no serious people are seeking to revisit it except to score cheap political points, I unequivocally state that I will not support any efforts to repeal the Civil Rights Act of 1964,\\" Paul, 47, said.      \\"Let me be clear: I support the Civil Rights Act because I overwhelmingly agree with the intent of the legislation, which was to stop discrimination in the public sphere and halt the abhorrent practice of segregation and Jim Crow laws,\\" he said. ||||| What is a one-paragraph summary of the above article?","output":"Rand Paul, a political candidate from Kentucky, was critical of how President Obama handled a big oil spill in the Gulf of Mexico. He didn't like the way the president talked about the oil company (BP) and thought it sounded un-American. Paul believes that sometimes accidents just happen, and it's not always someone's fault. People have also been talking about his opinions on civil rights laws and how businesses should be allowed to decide who they serve."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Step 1: Understand each statement - \\"Crowd of people standing outside\\" indicates that there is a group of individuals gathered in an outdoor area. - \\"The area is devoid of life\\" suggests that there is no sign of living organisms in a particular region. Step 2: Compare the two statements Compare these two statements to see if they are logically consistent with each other. Since there is a crowd of people standing outside, this means that there are living organisms (humans) in the area. Therefore, it cannot be true that the area is devoid of life. Conclusion: \\"The crowd of people standing outside\\" does not mean \\"The area is devoid of life\\" because people are living organisms and their presence contradicts the notion that the area lacks life."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Q:-  These pores are called stomata - Water is absorbed by the roots and passes through vessels in the stem on its way to the leaves - Chlorophyll absorbs the sun&#x27;s energy - It is this energy that is used to split water molecules into hydrogen and oxygen - Oxygen is released from the leaves into the atmosphere - Hydrogen and carbon dioxide are used to form glucose or food for plants.  What might be the first step of the process? A:","output":"The first step of the process described above, which is a simplified explanation of the process of photosynthesis in plants, is the absorption of water by the plant roots. Photosynthesis is a vital process for plants to produce glucose through the conversion of light energy into chemical energy, which is ultimately used by the plant as a source of nourishment. A detailed understanding of this first step involves several sub-steps: 1. Water absorption: Plant roots are responsible for absorbing water and essential nutrients from the soil. The root system is formed by the main root (called the tap root) and numerous lateral (branching) roots, which spread out and penetrate the soil to access its resources. The root hairs, which are extensions of the root epidermis, are crucial in facilitating the absorption process by increasing the surface area for water and nutrient uptake. 2. Osmosis: Water moves into the roots through a passive transport process called osmosis, driven by a difference in concentration of water molecules in the soil and the plant root cells. The water potential (an indication of the free energy of water molecules) is generally lower in the root cells than in the soil, which causes water to move into the root tissues. Osmosis ensures that the plants obtain a steady supply of water for their survival and growth. 3. Transportation through the xylem: Once absorbed by the roots, the water travels through specialized vascular tissues called xylem, which are responsible for conducting water and dissolved minerals from the roots to the other parts of the plant. The xylem consists of elongated, dead cells called tracheids and vessel elements, which form a continuous network of interconnected tubes. The water in the xylem moves upwards through a combination of processes, such as capillary action, root pressure, and transpiration pull. In summary, the first step of the described process, which is integral to the overall process of photosynthesis, consists of the absorption of water by plant roots, followed by its transportation through the xylem vessels in the stem to reach the leaves, where the subsequent steps of photosynthesis occur. This step is essential for providing the raw materials and maintaining the hydration necessary for the energy conversion and synthesis of glucose in plants."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Justification: Natural forces, such as wind and water, cause erosion, which breaks down rocks into smaller pieces. Step 2: The wind or water deposits tiny rocks. Justification: After breaking down the rocks, wind and water transport and deposit the tiny rocks in a new location. Step 3: The rocks become known as sediment. Justification: Once deposited, the tiny rocks are considered sediment, which forms in layers over time. Step 4: The layers of sediment are pressed together by other layers of sediment on top. Justification: As more layers of sediment accumulate, the weight of the new layers presses down on the older layers beneath, compacting them together. Step 5: Minerals from the rocks in the sediment dissolve. Justification: Over time, minerals within the sedimentary rocks dissolve due to water and other factors, aiding in the further compacting and binding of the particles.

Read this: As with most of Europe, prehistoric Britain and Ireland were covered with forest and swamp. Clearing began around 6000 BC and accelerated in medieval times. Despite this, Britain retained its primeval forests longer than most of Europe due to a small population and later development of trade and industry, and wood shortages were not a problem until the 17th century. By the 18th century, most of Britain's forests were consumed for shipbuilding or manufacturing charcoal and the nation was forced to import lumber from Scandinavia, North America, and the Baltic. Most forest land in Ireland is maintained by state forestation programmes. Almost all land outside urban areas is farmland. However, relatively large areas of forest remain in east and north Scotland and in southeast England. Oak, elm, ash and beech are amongst the most common trees in England. In Scotland, pine and birch are most common. Natural forests in Ireland are mainly oak, ash, wych elm, birch and pine. Beech and lime, though not native to Ireland, are also common there. Farmland hosts a variety of semi-natural vegetation of grasses and flowering plants. Woods, hedgerows, mountain slopes and marshes host heather, wild grasses, gorse and bracken.

These systems work by removing contaminants and impurities from your tap water, improving its taste and smell. In addition, a water filter system can help you save money by reducing your reliance on bottled water. To get the best results from your water filter system, it is crucial to install it properly. This article will provide you with a step-by-step guide on how to position the base system, mount the collar, insert the filter cartridge, and flush out the new cartridge. Step 1: Position the Base System Beneath the Faucet Start by choosing the area under your sink where you want to install the water filter system. Ensure there is enough space to accommodate the system and that you have easy access for maintenance and filter changes. Once you have found the perfect spot, position the base system in such a way that it is beneath the faucet. Positioning it directly below the faucet ensures that the water flows seamlessly through the system and into the outflow pipe. Step 2: Twist on the Mounting Collar The mounting collar is essential for securing the water filter system in place. Hold the mounting collar above the base system and twist it onto the designated area on the base. The twisting motion will lock it securely, adding stability to the filter system and preventing it from moving during water flow. Step 3: Insert the Filter Cartridge into the Filter Cup The filter cartridge is a key component within the water filter system, as it helps remove impurities and contaminants from the water. To install it, first, locate the filter cup and ensure it is clean and free of debris. Next, hold the filter cartridge by its ends and gently insert it into the filter cup following the manufacturer's guidelines/instructions. Make sure the cartridge is seated correctly in the filter cup. Step 4: Check the Cartridge Once you have inserted the filter cartridge into the filter cup, you must check its position. Double-check that the cartridge is inserted correctly and that it is not misaligned or damaged in any way. It is essential to ensure that the filter cartridge is functioning effectively to remove impurities from your tap water. Step 5: Flush Out the New Cartridge Before you start using the water filter system, you must flush out the new cartridge. This process helps remove any particles, dust, or residue that may be present in the cartridge from manufacturing and shipping. To flush out the new cartridge, turn on the faucet and allow water to flow through the system for a few minutes. During this time, do not consume the water, as it may still contain some unwanted particles. Once the initial flushing process is complete, your water filter system is ready for use. Conclusion Installing a water filter system under your faucet is a relatively simple process that can drastically improve your household's water quality. By following these steps to position the base system, install the mounting collar, insert the filter cartridge, and flush out the new cartridge, you will enjoy clean and healthy water in no time. Remember to maintain your water filter system and replace the filter cartridge according to the manufacturer's recommendations to ensure optimal performance and maximum benefits."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

On 23 February 1763, slaves on Plantation Magdalenenberg on the Canje River in Berbice rebelled, protesting harsh and inhumane treatment. They torched the plantation house, then went to other plantations to mobilize other enslaved Africans to join the rebellion. Cuffy, an enslaved man at Lilienburg, another plantation on Canje, is said to have organized them into a military unit. As plantation after plantation fell to the slaves, the Dutch settlers fled northward and the rebels began to take over control of the region. For almost a year, the rebels held on to southern Berbice, while the whites were able to hold on to the north. Eventually only about half of the white population that had lived in the colony remained. The rebels came to number about 3,000 and threatened European control over the Guianas. Other key figures among the rebels include Atta, Accara, and Accabre. The insurgents were eventually defeated in the spring of 1764 with the assistance of troops from neighbouring French and British colonies and from Europe. Answer this question: How many more whites than Amerindians were there?","output":"There were 346 whites and 244 Amerindians in the colony of Berbice.

Background: Curved Air are a pioneering English progressive rock group formed in 1970 by musicians from mixed artistic backgrounds, including classical, folk, and electronic sound. The resulting sound of the band was a mixture of progressive rock, folk rock, and fusion with classical elements. Along with High Tide and East of Eden, Curved Air were one of the first rock bands after It's a Beautiful Day and the United States of America to feature a violin. Curved Air released eight studio albums, the first three of which broke the UK Top 20, and had a hit single with \\"Back Street Luv\\" (1971) which reached number 4 in the UK Singles Chart. Context: Having retained a good working relationship, Sonja Kristina and Mike Wedgwood formed a new band with Kirby Gregory (electric guitar), Eddie Jobson (keyboards, violin), and Jim Russell (drums). Jobson had come from a band called Fat Grapple, who had been one of Curved Air's support acts on tour. This new band played a much more conventional brand of rock than the former Curved Air, with almost none of the classical influences of that group. However, on the suggestion of manager Clifford Davis, they continued using the name Curved Air so as to give them a commercial leg up.  Kristina later commented:  What I wanted to do with the band at the time was get more of a rock edge to it, and Kirby's guitar playing really excited me - he was just really wild. And Jim was the same way, a very solid rock drummer. Mike and I really wanted to continue, and it was our manager Clifford Davis who said we would do a better business continuing to call the band Curved Air. So we kept the name and followed along the same pattern as before, as a writer's band. Everybody in the new band contributed material except for Jim Russell, who really wasn't a writer. Before it had mainly been Darryl and Francis, but I had managed to get some of my compositions in.  The use of the Curved Air name was not enough, however. Whereas all three of the original Curved Air's albums had broken the UK top 20, the new band's sole album, Air Cut, failed to even chart. Due to artistic differences with Jobson, Kirby Gregory and Jim Russell both left the group to form Stretch. Warner Brothers realized that the current Curved Air was in essence not the same band they had signed, and so the remaining trio recorded a demo tape for the label. The demos failed to convince Warner Brothers, and they discontinued the contract. (These demos were later issued as part of the Lovechild record.) With no contract and only half a lineup, in summer 1973 Curved Air broke up. Jobson replaced Eno in Roxy Music, while Wedgwood joined Caravan. Question: How did that demo do. Whats the answer?","output":"The demo that Curved Air recorded for Warner Brothers didn't do well. The record company wasn't convinced by the demo and decided to discontinue the contract with the band. As a result, Curved Air broke up in summer 1973. Those demos were later released as part of the Lovechild record."},{"instruction":"Is there a negative or positive tone to this product review? === Title: what a piece of crap...

He conducted them for nearly half a century, introducing hundreds of new works to British audiences. After his death, the concerts were officially renamed in his honour as the \\"Henry Wood Promenade Concerts\\", although they continued to be generally referred to as \\"the Proms\\". Born in modest circumstances to parents who encouraged his musical talent, Wood started his career as an organist. During his studies at the Royal Academy of Music, he came under the influence of the voice teacher Manuel Garcia and became his accompanist. After similar work for Richard D'Oyly Carte's opera companies on the works of Arthur Sullivan and others, Wood became the conductor of a small operatic touring company.  He was soon engaged by the larger Carl Rosa Opera Company. One notable event in his operatic career was conducting the British premiere of Tchaikovsky's Eugene Onegin in 1892. From the mid-1890s until his death, Wood focused on concert conducting. He was engaged by the impresario Robert Newman to conduct a series of promenade concerts at the Queen's Hall, offering a mixture of classical and popular music at low prices. The series was successful, and Wood conducted annual promenade series until his death in 1944. By the 1920s, Wood had steered the repertoire entirely to classical music.  When the Queen's Hall was destroyed by bombing in 1941, the Proms moved to the Royal Albert Hall. Wood declined the chief conductorships of the New York Philharmonic and Boston Symphony Orchestras, believing it his duty to serve music in the United Kingdom.

Pernell Whitaker (born January 2, 1964) is an American former professional boxer who competed from 1984 to 2001, and has since worked as a boxing trainer. He is a four-weight world champion, having won titles at lightweight, light welterweight, welterweight, and light middleweight; the undisputed lightweight title; and the lineal lightweight and welterweight titles. In 1989, Whitaker was named Fighter of the Year by The Ring magazine and the Boxing Writers Association of America. From 1993 to 1997, The Ring ranked him as the best active boxer in the world, pound for pound. On February 20, 1999, Whitaker suffered his first convincing defeat against the much bigger, much fresher Felix Trinidad, gamely taking the Puerto Rican the distance in an attempt to win Trinidad's IBF welterweight title. The fight began with both boxers displaying aggressive styles, which included excessive pushing. In the following rounds, both boxers used their jabs most of the time, with Trinidad gaining an advantage when Whitaker attempted to attack inside, eventually scoring a knockdown in round two. In the fourth, fifth and sixth rounds the fighters exchanged combinations. Later in the fight, both boxers fell to the canvas in what were ruled as \\"accidental slips.\\" On the seventh round, Whitaker displayed more offense, trading power punches with Trinidad, but the champion retained control in the fight's tempo during the eight, ninth and tenth rounds. In the last round, Whitaker, with a badly swollen right eye, displayed a purely defensive stance, avoiding his opponent throughout the round while Trinidad continued on the offensive until the fight concluded. The judges gave the champion scores of 117-111, 118-109 and 118-109.  His last fight came on April 27, 2001, against journeyman Carlos Bojorquez. Whitaker, the former lightweight, entered the ring at 155 pounds. He broke his clavicle in round four and was forced to retire; at the time of the stoppage Whitaker was trailing in all the judges' scorecards by 28-29. Following this fight, Whitaker officially announced his retirement. He finished his professional career with an official record of 40-4-1 (17 knockouts).  In 2002, The Ring ranked Whitaker as the 10th Greatest Fighter of the Last 80 Years.  On December 7, 2006, Whitaker was inducted in the International Boxing Hall of Fame along with contemporaries Roberto Duran and Ricardo Lopez.

Translate to English","output":"Both Sudan and South Sudan need to address massive humanitarian needs. In both countries, there are extensive humanitarian challenges that require significant attention and support from the international community. These challenges stem from a variety of factors, including the impact of civil wars, political instability, economic crises, and natural disasters like severe droughts and floods. First and foremost, the issue of displacement affects millions of people in Sudan and South Sudan. According to the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR), there are more than two million internally displaced persons (IDPs) in Sudan and around 1.6 million IDPs in South Sudan, as of 2021. Large numbers of refugees have also fled to neighboring countries, such as Uganda, Ethiopia, and Kenya. Many of these individuals live in overcrowded camps, have limited access to basic services like healthcare and education, and face protection risks. Another major challenge is food insecurity. The civil wars and ongoing conflict, as well as widespread poverty in the region, have negatively affected agricultural production and hindered humanitarian access to many locations. In South Sudan, the Famine Early Warning Systems Network estimated in November 2021 that over seven million people are in need of humanitarian food assistance, representing more than half of the population. On the other hand, Sudan has faced a series of crises in recent years that have increased food prices, making it difficult for millions of Sudanese households to afford adequate nutrition. Ensuring access to water, sanitation, and hygiene is also crucial to the wellbeing of communities in both countries. Many IDP and refugee camps struggle to provide safe drinking water and adequate sanitation facilities, leading to the potential spread of waterborne diseases like cholera and diarrhea. In addition, the lack of proper sanitation infrastructure can also contribute to conflicts over limited resources and heighten protection risks. Healthcare is another area that demands attention in both Sudan and South Sudan. The healthcare systems in both countries have been severely affected by years of conflict. In South Sudan, only around 44% of the population has access to healthcare services, while in Sudan, the situation is slightly better with about 70% having access. But, the ongoing economic crisis in Sudan is taking a toll on the healthcare system. A shortage of medical supplies, insufficient funding, and damaged infrastructure all contribute to the problem. As a result, there is an increased risk of disease outbreaks and limited access to essential health services. Finally, education is another area where both countries face challenges. According to UNICEF, more than 2.2 million children in South Sudan are out of school, which is one of the highest rates of out-of-school children in the world. Similar challenges exist in Sudan, where around 3.6 million children are also out of school. Efforts to provide education for children are hampered by a variety of factors, such as inadequate infrastructure, a lack of teachers and learning materials, and ongoing conflict and insecurity. Given these pressing humanitarian needs in both Sudan and South Sudan, it is vital that the international community not only provides financial and material support but also seeks lasting political solutions to the underlying issues that contribute to these crises. A focus on peacebuilding, fostering resilience, and addressing the root causes of conflict and displacement will be essential in enabling both countries to overcome these immense challenges and secure a better future for their people."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

ROLAND NARROWED HIS EYES AND STARED UPWARD INTO THE DARKNESS, across the top of Mont Segur toward the Cathar fortress. Standing on a high walkway of planks behind the palisade of the crusaders' small wooden fort, he heard faraway voices and saw torches moving on the Cathar rampart. The two men on watch with him that night, a sergeant from Champagne and a young man-at-arms from Brittany, were talking in low tones about the women to be had far below, at the foot of the mountain. They seemed not to see the activity about the Cathar stronghold on the upper peak of the mountaintop opposite their own fort. But Roland, knowing Diane was in the besieged fortress, could not take his eyes from it. He knew he had to act soon. Each day the crusaders grew stronger and the Cathars weaker. Once the Cathar stronghold fell, the crusaders would slaughter all within, including Diane. The sergeant, chuckling, was offering his young companion a wineskin. The Breton never received it. From behind the Cathar wall came the sound of a huge thump, as if a giant's fist had pounded Mont Segur. Roland recognized the sound, and fought panic as he thrust his arms out, trying to push the other two men toward the ladder. But there was no time for them to climb down to safety. The thump was the counter-weight of a stone-caster, and the whistling noise that followed fast upon it was the rock it had thrown. A shape as big as a wine barrel blotted out the stars. The stone hit the parapet beside Roland, and the whole palisade shuddered. Roland caught a glimpse of the sergeant's horrified face and heard his scream as the boulder struck him, crushing him to the ground. Question: What is probably the sergeant's status at the end of the story? === The answer to the above question is Answer:","output":"The sergeant is most likely dead by the end of the story. The narrative describes a situation in which a huge boulder, launched by a stone-caster from the enemy's Cathar fortress, hits the parapet where Roland and his comrades are positioned. The stone, described as being as big as a wine barrel, strikes the sergeant, crushing him to the ground. Given the size and force of the thrown boulder, this would almost certainly result in fatal injuries. Therefore, it can be inferred that the sergeant is probably killed by this assault.  The sudden and violent nature of this event underlines the serious dangers faced by these crusaders in their siege against the Cathar stronghold, and gives the reader a very stark reminder of the hazards of medieval warfare. The sergeant's death emphasizes the urgency of the situation and reinforces the tension that Roland feels knowing that his beloved Diane is in the besieged fortress, under threat not only from the ongoing siege but also from the potential massacre that would follow if the stronghold fell to the crusaders. This tragic event showcases the harsh realities of war, where laughter and camaraderie can instantly be replaced by loss and grief."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Options: - garage - movies - in europe - paris - bus  Explain why a human would choose \\"in europe\\" to answer the question above:","output":"\\"In Europe\\" is an option that a human might choose to answer the question of what kind of tour someone is likely to see the Eiffel Tower on. However, the most accurate and specific answer would be \\"Paris,\\" as the Eiffel Tower is located in Paris, France. Here's why a human might choose the \\"in Europe\\" option instead: 1. General knowledge: Someone may choose \\"in Europe\\" if they're aware that the Eiffel Tower is in Europe but unsure of the specific city or country it's located in. They may recognize that the other options (garage, movies, bus) aren't relevant and choose \\"in Europe\\" because it's the general area where the landmark exists. 2. Contextual association: The Eiffel Tower is one of Europe's most iconic landmarks, and some people might associate it with Europe as a whole rather than specifically with Paris. If someone isn't confident in their geography but knows that the Eiffel Tower is a famous European attraction, they may choose \\"in Europe\\" as the answer. 3. Misunderstanding the question: If a user isn't clear on the question's intent, they might think that \\"in Europe\\" refers to a wide-ranging tour of Europe that happens to include the Eiffel Tower. In this sense, \\"in Europe\\" would still be a correct answer, though \\"Paris\\" would be more appropriate. 4. Lack of knowledge on other options: For some people, the Eiffel Tower might not be well-known enough to pinpoint it to a specific location. In this case, they might choose \\"in Europe\\" because it seems like the most general answer compared to the other options, which are unrelated or too specific. 5. Regional identification: Sometimes, people may identify certain landmarks as representative of a specific region rather than a particular city. This could be because these iconic structures possess a cultural or historical significance that spans beyond their immediate location. In conclusion, while \\"in Europe\\" might be an option that some people choose to answer the question of what kind of tour someone is likely to see the Eiffel Tower on, the most accurate and specific answer would be \\"Paris\\" because that's where the landmark is located."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

The answer to the question: What is the last name of the person who warned that other composers were interested in adapting La Tosca? is inside the article: The French playwright Victorien Sardou wrote more than 70 plays, almost all of them successful, and none of them performed today. In the early 1880s Sardou began a collaboration with actress Sarah Bernhardt, whom he provided with a series of historical melodramas. His third Bernhardt play, La Tosca, which premiered in Paris on 24 November 1887, and in which she starred throughout Europe, was an outstanding success, with more than 3,000 performances in France alone.Puccini had seen La Tosca at least twice, in Milan and Turin. On 7 May 1889 he wrote to his publisher, Giulio Ricordi, begging him to get Sardou's permission for the work to be made into an opera: \\"I see in this Tosca the opera I need, with no overblown proportions, no elaborate spectacle, nor will it call for the usual excessive amount of music.\\"Ricordi sent his agent in Paris, Emanuele Muzio, to negotiate with Sardou, who preferred that his play be adapted by a French composer. He complained about the reception La Tosca had received in Italy, particularly in Milan, and warned that other composers were interested in the piece. Nonetheless, Ricordi reached terms with Sardou and assigned the librettist Luigi Illica to write a scenario for an adaptation.In 1891, Illica advised Puccini against the project, most likely because he felt the play could not be successfully adapted to a musical form. When Sardou expressed his unease at entrusting his most successful work to a relatively new composer whose music he did not like, Puccini took offence. He withdrew from the agreement, which Ricordi then assigned to the composer Alberto Franchetti.  Illica wrote a libretto for Franchetti, who was never at ease with the assignment. When Puccini once again became interested in Tosca, Ricordi was able to get Franchetti to surrender the rights so he could recommission Puccini.  One story relates that Ricordi convinced Franchetti that the work was too violent to be successfully staged. A Franchetti family tradition holds that Franchetti gave the work back as a grand..., can you guess it ?

Here is a question about this article: Around the beginning of the 20th century, William James (1842–1910) coined the term \\"radical empiricism\\" to describe an offshoot of his form of pragmatism, which he argued could be dealt with separately from his pragmatism – though in fact the two concepts are intertwined in James's published lectures.

Answer the following question: Article: As skies are filled with millions of migrating  birds, European scientists say the seasonal wonder appears to be strange: The fatter the bird, tile better it flies.     The results of their study led to a theory opposite to a central one of aerodynamics  , which says that the power needed to fly increases with weight.     For birds, obviously, the cost of flying with heavy fat is much smaller than we used to think. Researchers found that red knot wading birds double their normal body weight of 100 grams before making their twice-a-year nonstop flight between the British Isles and the Russian Arctic. Distance: 5,000 kilometers.     Another study in the magazine Nature measured the advantage of flying in an aerodynamic group which allows birds to save energy by flying smoothly and quietly in the lead bird' s air stream.     Flying in groups, their heart rates were 14.5 percent lower than flying alone, according to Henri, a French scientist. The findings help explain how birds complete difficult migrations. Researchers had thought that thinner, stronger birds would have the best chance to survive.     The first study suggests that building up fat to be burnt as fuel during the migration is worth more than the energy it takes to carry the additional weight.     In the study, researchers said their team studied the birds flown at different body weights during 28 simulated  flights. They forced a small amount of special water into the birds' bodies so that they could measure the amount of energy burnt during the flight. Question: A   _   red knot wading bird has a better chance to survive during its migrating flight. Yes or no, is the answer \\"fatter\\"? Answer:","output":"Yes, the answer is \\"fatter.\\" The study conducted by European scientists found that red knot wading birds have a better chance of survival during their migration flights when they double their normal body weight before embarking on their journey. This finding contradicts the central theory of aerodynamics, which states that the power required to fly increases with weight. The researchers discovered that for birds, the cost of flying with heavy fat is much lower than previously believed. This suggests that accumulating fat as fuel for migration is more advantageous than the energy required to carry the additional weight. Red knot wading birds, doubling their normal body weight of 100 grams, embark on their twice-a-year nonstop flight that covers 5,000 kilometers between the British Isles and the Russian Arctic. Another study published in the magazine Nature revealed that birds flying in an aerodynamic group could save energy by flying smoothly and quietly within the lead bird's air stream. The heart rates of birds flying in groups were found to be 14.5 percent lower than those flying solo, according to Henri, a French scientist. These findings help explain how birds complete their challenging migrations. Prior to this discovery, researchers believed that thinner, stronger birds had the best chance of survival. In conclusion, the studies show that a fatter red knot wading bird has a better chance of survival during its migration flight due to the additional fat reserves providing energy and the lower cost of flying with extra weight than initially thought."},{"instruction":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

Please answer the following question: April 2-May 2 is the worst 30 day period for me. The reason is… April 2, 2014 was the day my 53 year old wife found out that she had metastasized lung cancer. A large tumor had formed on the bottom of one lung, they found 4 tumors in her brain, another large one in her stomach and several more throughout her intestinal track. She rarely complained about physical problems and I knew something was wrong when she said she needed to go to the hospital ER. She died exactly 30 days later. I spent virtually every minute of that time with her. I went with her to radiation appointments. I stayed in the hospital with her because it seemed like every week I would have to take her in for something that required a 3 or 4 day stay. And the final trip to the ER was May 1st. An MRI showed that one of the tumors in her intestines had torn a hole in her bowel. The ER surgeon told us straight up that she was beyond any medical care that could help her and to use the next 24 hours to say goodbye to family and friends. And almost exactly 24 hours later, she was gone. I was devastated. 30.5 years of Happily Ever After turned into god fucking damn it all to hell! And when April 2 rolls around every year, I begin living those last 30 days of her life over again. I thought that after the third time in 2017 that I was about ready to let it go. I started really living again instead of just existing. But when April 2 came this year, I found that I was back in my memories. It was easier to deal with this time because of the way I had changed over the last year. I hung around with more friends and they helped distract me and one actually helped me turn May 2 into a celebration. And I love her for that. That's my story.

Her father, John, took Alberta to countless medical appointments, seeking the best treatment possible. Alberta's younger brother James also wanted to help. Despite his young age, he felt responsible for his sister because he had always been her protector. James started tagging along with Alberta and their father to every medical appointment, constantly asking questions and listening keenly to what the doctors had to say. During this entire journey, Alberta's family made it a point to remain positive and focused on promoting Alberta's emotional well-being. They believed that if Alberta had a strong, positive mindset, it would only give her the best chance to combat the weakening anemia. Together, they tackled Alberta's anemia head-on, and their powerful, unified support gradually helped her regain her health. With time, Alberta started feeling better and was able to return to her normal life.

The strength of their love and unity as a family truly outshined any physical weaknesses they faced. In the end, it was the anemia that was weak, as it stood no chance against a family so full of love and determination. Alberta would forever be grateful for her family's support and knew she could always count on them, no matter what challenges life threw their way."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

In a hotel sitting room the Princess is met by the hotel manager. Ermyntrude, now dressed very plainly gets the job as her lady's maid. Captain Duval, a messenger from the \\"Inca of Perusalem\\" appears with news that Inca wants one of his sons to marry the Princess. Ermyntrude realises that the messenger is in fact the Inca in disguise. She offers to return the trick, by pretending to be the Princess to find out what his intentions are.

Unfortunately he already has a wife, so he suggests they should to convert to Islam so he can legally have another one. Ermyntrude says the Inca is far too poor for her, since his country is going bankrupt because of its foolish war. The Inca says that the war will result in his overthrow and the creation of a republic, but this will not be a problem as he will be elected as \\"super-president\\" of the republic. He then says how surprised he is by the popularity of the war in his homeland. He used to rely for popularity on his contributions to art, literature and science, but he was ignored. Now the mass killing in the war leads to cheering crowds. Despite being turned down for marriage, the Inca offers to take Ermyntrude on a drive round the town.

Article: If you want the benefits of medical marijuana without the \\"unwanted side effects\\" of cannabis, new research should leave you on a high note. According to a research report appearing in the April 2015 issue of The FASEB Journal, fenofibrate, also known by the brand name Tricor®, may benefit a wide range of health issues, such as pain, appetite stimulation, nausea, as well as immune and various psychiatric and neurological conditions. This suggests that fenofibrate may be the starting point for a new class of cannabis-like drugs to treat these types of conditions.      \\"By illustrating the relationship between fenofibrate and the cannabinoid system, we aim to improve our understanding of this clinically important drug,\\" said Richard S. Priestley, Ph.D., a researcher involved in the work from the School of Life Sciences at the University of Nottingham Medical School in Nottingham, United Kingdom. \\"Our study provides the basis for the investigation of new drugs targeting these important receptors.\\"      To make this discovery Priestly and colleagues cultured cells containing cannabinoid receptors and exposed them to a tracer compound, which binds to cannabinoid receptors. They found that fenofibrate was able to displace the tracer, suggesting that it also binds to the receptors. Furthermore, they discovered that fenofibrate actually switched the cannabinoid receptors \\"on,\\" not only in these cells, but also in sections of intestine. This led to the relaxation of the tissue in a way that mimicked what marijuana does. Despite the fact that fenofibrate has been used for many years, and its mechanism of action was presumed to be through a completely different family of receptors, this suggests that at least some of the effects of fenofibrate may be controlled by cannabinoid receptors. Furthermore, these cannabinoid receptors may be a future target for drugs used to treat pain and a variety of immune and psychiatric diseases.      \\"It may be difficult to persuade people in Colorado, Washington, and the District of Columbia that there are people who want the beneficial effects of marijuana without actually getting high,\\" said Gerald Weissmann, M.D., Editor-in-Chief of The FASEB Journal, \\"but there are people who do not want to get stoned just to get the relief that marijuana brings.

The Jacobite rising of 1745, also known as the Forty-five Rebellion or simply the '45'  was an attempt by Charles Edward Stuart to regain the British throne for his father, James Francis Edward Stuart, and the House of Stuart. The rising took place during the War of the Austrian Succession, when the bulk of the British Army was in Europe, and was the last in a series of revolts that began in 1689 and continued in 1708, 1715 and 1719. Charles launched the rising on 19 August 1745 at Glenfinnan in the Scottish Highlands, capturing Edinburgh and winning the Battle of Prestonpans in September. The Jacobite army invaded England in early November, reaching Derby on 4 December, where they were forced to retreat by a lack of expected English support, by superior numbers of government forces, and by differences in opinion amongst the Jacobite command. Despite victory at Falkirk Muir in January 1746, the Battle of Culloden in April ended the Rebellion and significant backing for the Stuart cause.

Which of the following is the supposed perturbation?  - directly impacting a step of the process - indirectly impacting a step of the process - not impacting any step of the process Answer:","output":"If the air is not converted to oxygen in the lungs, it is directly impacting a step of the process in the respiratory system. The primary purpose of the lungs is to facilitate the exchange of oxygen and carbon dioxide, which is necessary for the human body to function properly. This exchange occurs in the alveoli, tiny air sacs within the lungs, where oxygen from the inhaled air diffuses into the bloodstream and carbon dioxide is released from the blood into the air sacs to be exhaled. Several factors or conditions can result in the disruption of the oxygen and carbon dioxide exchange in the lungs, such as: 1. Respiratory diseases: Conditions like chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), asthma, or pneumonia can impair lung function, thus affecting the ability of the lungs to efficiently deliver oxygen to the bloodstream or remove carbon dioxide. 2. Impaired alveolar function: Conditions like emphysema or pulmonary fibrosis can damage the alveoli and hinder gas exchange. 3. Hypoxia: Inadequate oxygen supply to the body can be a result of high altitudes, smoke inhalation, or various medical conditions that impede the lungs' function. 4. Airway obstruction: Mucus, foreign objects, or swelling can block the airways, disrupting the flow of air and potentially leading to inadequate oxygenation of the blood. When the lungs' ability to convert air to oxygen is directly impacted, it can have severe consequences on the body's overall function, as oxygen is critical for cells to generate energy, maintain body temperature, and perform numerous other essential biological processes. A lack of oxygen may lead to shortness of breath, fatigue, confusion, and in severe cases, organ failure and death. Immediate medical intervention may be necessary to address any conditions that are directly impacting the lungs' ability to convert air to oxygen and ensure proper respiratory function is maintained."},{"instruction":"Question: On a scale of 1-5 (with 1 being least favorable and 5 being most favorable), how would you rate this review? \\"Good Ever good filemanager ever seen\\" Answer:","output":"2"},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

But in Y.S. 375 of the First Age Morgoth sent out an Orc - raid against them . The Men were caught off - guard , and a great part of their people was wiped out . The remnant was gathered under one Haldad and his twin children , daughter Haleth and son Haldar ; and they held out for days in a stockade until the Noldor rescued them , by which time both Haldad and Haldar were slain . Caranthir offered to Men his lands to live in protected , but Haleth refused , for now she was chosen a Chieftain , being of great heart and no less in valour than her kinsmen . Next year she led her people to Estolad ; and after a time again urged them to move further westward . They passed through the horrors of Nan Dungortheb only by the strength of Haleth 's will , and at last came to the woods of Talath Dirnen . Later many removed the forest of Brethil , which was a part of Doriath outside the Girdle of Melian , but now was granted to them by Thingol . Haleth ruled the Folk of Brethil until she died .

This causes the car's kinetic energy to be converted into heat, eventually bringing the car to a stop. (b).

Russian news reports say Verzilov a member of Russian punk protest group... (Associated Press)      MOSCOW (AP) — A member of Russia's Pussy Riot protest group says a severely ill fellow activist was being taken to Germany on Saturday for treatment after his suspected poisoning.      Maria Alekhina told The Associated Press that Pyotr Verzilov was being flown to Berlin, but she did not give details.      Independent news site Meduza reported that Verzilov's partner, Veronika Nikulshina, said a doctor from a Berlin clinic who is friends with the ill man's father suggested medical care outside Russia.      Verzilov was hospitalized in Moscow on Tuesday and had remained in intensive care, Pussy Riot members said this week. Alekhina told the AP he regained consciousness Friday.      She also said she thinks he was poisoned for political reasons.      Verzilov, Nikulshina and two other Pussy Riot members served 15-day jail sentences for running onto the Moscow field where soccer's World Cup final was being played in July. Their protest of what they described as the excessive powers of Russia's police briefly disrupted the match with a very large broadcast audience.      Verzilov's fell ill as new allegations arose over the March nerve-agent poisoning of a Russian former double agent and his daughter in the British city of Salisbury.      British authorities last week named two men — alleged to be agents of Russia's military intelligence service — in the poisoning of Sergei Skripal and his daughter, Yulia. The authorities showed surveillance-camera images of the pair in Salisbury.      The two men told Kremlin-funded satellite TV channel RT on Thursday they were in Salisbury only as tourists, to see the city's noted cathedral, and denied working for military intelligence.      Several Kremlin opponents have died from poisoning or suspected poisoning during the past 15 years. Alexander Litvinenko, a former member of Russia's domestic security service, succumbed slowly in London after ingesting a radioactive isotope in 2006. He fell ill hours after meeting with two Russians whom Britain claimed were the assassins.      Journalist Anna Politkovskaya, a fierce critic of President Vladimir Putin, became sick after drinking tea on an Aeroflot flight in 2004. She was travelling to southern Russia to try to help negotiate the Beslan crisis in which Chechen militants took hundreds of schoolchildren hostage.      Poison was mentioned as a possible cause of her symptoms. Politkovskaya survived, and was shot to death in the elevator of her apartment building two years later.      Vladimir Kara-Murza, a prominent opposition figure, nearly died of kidney failure after a suspected poisoning in 2015 and fell severely ill again in 2017.      ___      Jim Heintz in Moscow contributed to this story. ||||| Alexander Zemlianichenko / AP / Scanpix / LETA      Doctors at Moscow Sklifosovsky Institute treating Pyotr Verzilov have ruled out the risk of a brain hemorrhage, Verzilov’s partner, fellow Pussy Riot member Veronika Nikulshina, told Meduza. He was hospitalized on September 11 in critical condition after the sudden loss of his vision, speech, and mobility.      Earlier on September 13, the news agency Interfax reported that Verzilov was “in fact, in a pre-stroke condition,” saying his blood work revealed “no drugs other than the ones the doctors gave him.” Nikulshina calls these claims “absurd nonsense,” saying that doctors at the Sklifosovsky Institute specifically evaluated Verzilov’s stroke risk and ruled it out “conclusively.” Elena Verzilova, Pyotr’s mother, told Meduza that her son’s ultrasound and CT scan “showed no vascular changes whatsoever.”      “This is absolutely poisoning. Poisoning by . It’s something like the atropine Cyclopentolate — what’s found in medicines. But the issue here is the large dosage,” Nikulshina told Meduza. According to Elena Verzilova, “these aren’t the kind of drugs that are easy to remove [from his system].”      Verzilov is currently unconscious in intensive care. According to friends, he’s in “medicated sleep,” because he “starts to become overactive when awake,” raising his blood pressure. Doctors apparently haven’t ruled out putting Verzilov on a ventilator. His friends say new information won’t be available until the morning of September 14, when his latest test results are in.      A member of Pussy Riot and the publisher of the investigative news website Mediazona, which conducts often daring reporting on Russia's criminal justice system, Verzilov has been a prominent figure in Russia’s anti-Kremlin opposition movement since the late 2000s, when he performed in the controversial “Voina” artist-activist group alongside his then wife, Nadezhda Tolokonnikova. On September 11, paramedics brought Verzilov to Moscow’s Bakhrushin City Clinical Hospital, where he was treated at the toxicology wing before being transferred to the Moscow Sklifosovsky Institute on September 13.

Review: 'Jersey Boys' generally falls flat updated 11:07 AM EDT, Fri June 20, 2014 Vincent Piazza, Erich Bergen, John Lloyd Young and Michael Lomenda play the Four Seasons in \\"Jersey Boys,\\" directed by Clint Eastwood. (EW.com) -- Nine years ago, Frankie Valli was rescued from oldies-station oblivion with the smash Broadway musical \\"Jersey Boys.\\" The show chronicles the real-life rise-and-fall-and-rise-again of four crooners from the mobbed-up mean streets of 1960s New Jersey who called themselves the Four Seasons and cranked out a seemingly endless string of hit records, including the love ditty ''Sherry,'' the triumphant ''Walk Like a Man,'' and the bouncy bubblegum bop of ''Big Girls Don't Cry.'' The songs are timeless. But so are a lot of songs from that Motown and Phil Spector era. What made the Four Seasons magical was Valli's voice -- an impossibly high-pitched nasal falsetto that sounded like a prepubescent angel who'd huffed a tank of helium. With \\"Jersey Boys' \\" receipts still pouring in on the Great White Way, the notion of adapting the musical into a splashy song-and-dance Hollywood biopic must have been too juicy to resist. In fact, the only thing that might seem surprising about the \\"Jersey Boys\\" movie is the man squinting behind the camera, Clint Eastwood. But the pairing actually makes more sense than you'd think. Anyone who saw Eastwood's 1988 Charlie Parker film, \\"Bird,\\" knows that the guy's always been a not-so-closeted hepcat with a discerning set of ears. The biggest problem is that the film, written by Marshall Brickman and Rick Elice, never makes a convincing case for why Valli the man or the singer matters beyond the music in the way that \\"Ray\\" and \\"Walk the Line\\" did for Ray Charles and Johnny Cash. Such are the perils of adapting a somewhat one-dimensional stage show. Fortunately, Eastwood is far wiser on the casting front. As Valli, John Lloyd Young is pretty close to perfection. That's no shocker, really, as he won a Tony in 2006 for his portrayal of Valli on the boards. With his slicked-back pompadour and wardrobe of sharkskin suits, Young looks more like the late Bruno Kirby than Valli. But when he opens his mouth, you believe you're listening to the real deal. He finds every ounce of sweat, aftershave, and salad dressing that made up Valli's one-of-a-kind voice. As his fellow Four Seasons, Michael Lomenda, Erich Bergen and Vincent Piazza are equally spot-on, even if all of their bada-bing lingo occasionally makes them sound like they're competing in a Chazz Palminteri impersonation contest. (Both Lomenda and Bergen starred in the stage version as well.) Eastwood has never been the kind of filmmaker to grab you by the lapels or hot-dog with flashy storytelling tricks. You can walk in halfway through just about any of his movies and know exactly where you are. His laid-back traditionalism has always been part of his appeal, though. And in chronicling the careers of Valli & Co., he charts a predictably linear through-line: the band's hardscrabble Italian-American roots, which lead them to a sentimental wiseguy (Christopher Walken) who takes them under his wing; their first flirtation with fame; the downward slide of excess, money trouble, and infighting; and a redemptive third act in which they let bygones be bygones when they're inducted into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame in 1990. The movie's decades-spanning scope requires the 34-year-old Young to play Valli from age 16 to 60. As good as he is, he isn't done any favors by Eastwood's makeup team. You'd think that after all the grousing over Leonardo DiCaprio's distracting mugful of old-age putty in \\"J. Edgar,\\" the director would have paid more attention to the unconvincing wrinkles and jowls in the final stretch of \\"Jersey Boys.\\" But alas. Still, as flat and pitchy as the film sometimes feels, what saves it are those nostalgic, soaring doo-wop numbers (especially ''Sherry'') and Eastwood's measured doses of directorial playfulness, such as when the actors cheekily break the fourth wall and talk directly to the audience, as they did on Broadway. This trick doesn't always work, but when it does, and Valli or one of his bandmates turns to the camera, winks, and dishes about how the reality of events clashes with what we're actually witnessing on screen, it gooses the film with a giddy jolt of jukebox electricity.

They called themselves the Four Seasons, and they sang many hit songs like \\"Sherry,\\" \\"Walk Like a Man,\\" and \\"Big Girls Don't Cry.\\" The movie is based on a Broadway musical and is directed by Clint Eastwood. John Lloyd Young, who won a Tony award for playing Frankie Valli on stage, plays him in the movie too. The film tells the story of the band's journey, from their beginnings to fame, and then their struggles and eventual reunion in the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame. While it has some issues, the movie has great singing and fun moments where the actors talk directly to the audience."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Answer the following question: -  Air is taken into the body via the nose or mouth - The air travels into the windpipe - The windpipe divides the air to the two lungs via the bronchial tubes - The lungs oxygenate the blood in the body - Carbon dioxide is filtered out by every cell in the body - The carbon dioxide is carried back to the lungs via the bloodstream  What might be the last step of the process? Answer:","output":"The last step of the process involves exhaling the carbon dioxide. After the carbon dioxide is carried back to the lungs via the bloodstream, it diffuses from the blood into the alveoli (tiny air sacs) in the lungs. The oxygen-rich blood is then transported back to the heart and circulated throughout the body. When we exhale, we release this carbon dioxide, along with other gases and water vapor, from our lungs and back into the atmosphere through the same pathway it entered: the bronchial tubes, windpipe, and finally, either the mouth or nose.

Options: - possessing - plethora - enough - satisfaction - availability  Explain why a human would choose \\"enough\\" to answer the question above:","output":"A human would choose \\"enough\\" to answer the question above because it is the most appropriate and contextually accurate option among the given choices. The question focuses on the insufficiency of supplies, which led to the inability to finish the job despite the effort put in by the individuals involved. The word \\"enough\\" directly addresses this aspect of quantity and sufficiency in relation to the supplies needed to complete the task. Let's analyze each of the other options to understand why \\"enough\\" is the best choice: 1. Possessing: This option doesn't fit well into the context of the question. The word \\"possessing\\" refers to having or owning something, but it doesn't imply the insufficiency of the supplies in relation to the completion of the job. Conversely, it could be interpreted as if they had the supplies, but the question indicates they didn't have the necessary supplies to finish the job. 2. Plethora: This option also doesn't fit the context of the question. \\"Plethora\\" denotes an abundance, excess, or large quantity of something. Using this word would imply that the individuals had more than enough supplies, which contradicts the main idea expressed in the question, i.e., the lack of supplies was the reason why the job wasn't completed. 3. Satisfaction: The term \\"satisfaction\\" refers to a feeling of contentment or happiness when a desire or expectation has been fulfilled. It doesn't directly address the aspect of supply sufficiency and could be considered irrelevant in the given context. 4. Availability: Though this option might seem relevant initially, it doesn't precisely imply the insufficiency of supplies. \\"Availability\\" implies whether the supplies can be accessed or obtained rather than referring to the required quantity for the completion of the job. It is possible that the supplies were available, but the individuals did not have enough of them. In conclusion, a human would choose \\"enough\\" as the answer to this question because it accurately reflects the insufficiency of supplies, which is the primary focus of the question, and fits the context perfectly. The other options either do not address the pertinent aspect of supply quantity or do not align with the given situation and its requirements."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Here's our equation: 9 * y + 71 - 3 = -4 First, let's combine the numbers 71 and -3. If you have 71 candies and someone takes away 3 candies, you would have 68 candies left: 9 * y + 68 = -4 Now we need to get \\"y\\" all by itself. We'll do that by getting rid of the +68 next. To do this, we'll subtract 68 from both sides of the equation (remember to keep the equation balanced, whatever you do to one side, you must also do to the other side): (9 * y + 68) - 68 = -4 - 68 This simplifies to: 9 * y = -72 Now we're almost there! We just need to figure out what to multiply 9 by to get -72. We'll do this by dividing both sides of the equation by 9: (9 * y) / 9 = -72 / 9 The 9's on the left side cancel out each other, and we'll be left with: y = -8 And that's our answer, buddy!

Did the documentaries Tar Creek and Hot Girls Wanted focus on different events? Answer:","output":"Yes, the documentaries Tar Creek and Hot Girls Wanted focus on different events and subject matters. Tar Creek is a documentary released in 2009, directed by Matt Myers. It explores the devastating environmental and health effects caused by the mining of lead and zinc in the Tar Creek region of northeastern Oklahoma. The area, once packed with mining operations, is now an EPA Superfund site due to hazardous waste and contaminated waters left behind by mining. The documentary investigates the impact it has had on the communities living there and raises awareness about their struggle. Hot Girls Wanted is a 2015 documentary directed by filmmakers Jill Bauer and Ronna Gradus. The film takes an in-depth look at the amateur pornography industry and its exploitation of young women, specifically the \\"girl-next-door\\" type. It gives viewers a raw, behind-the-scenes glimpse at the lives of several 18- and 19-year-old girls who get lured into the business by the appeal of fame and easy money, only to face objectification, manipulation, and emotional consequences.

Strabo used Βρεττανική (Brettanike), and Marcian of Heraclea, in his Periplus maris exteri, used αἱ Πρεττανικαί νῆσοι (the Prettanic Isles) to refer to the islands. Historians today, though not in absolute agreement, largely agree that these Greek and Latin names were probably drawn from native Celtic-language names for the archipelago. Along these lines, the inhabitants of the islands were called the Πρεττανοί (Priteni or Pretani). The shift from the \\"P\\" of Pretannia to the \\"B\\" of Britannia by the Romans occurred during the time of Julius Caesar.

Its first line-up consisted of singer and rhythm guitarist Kai Hansen, bass guitarist Markus Grosskopf, lead guitarist Michael Weikath, and drummer Ingo Schwichtenberg. After the release of a self-titled EP and their debut album Walls of Jericho in 1985, it expanded into a quintet with the addition of singer Michael Kiske, Hansen choosing to focus on guitar instead. Under this line-up, they released the Keeper of the Seven Keys albums (1987 and 1988), which established Helloween as a notable heavy metal band and led to the creation of the power metal subgenre. The year 2000 saw the release of The Dark Ride, a more experimental and darker album than their previous releases. It came complete with downtuned guitars and a gruffer singing style from Deris. Immediately following the tour, Helloween parted ways with guitarist Roland Grapow and drummer Uli Kusch. One version of events states that Weikath, Deris, and Grosskopf felt that Kusch and Grapow, in particular, were spending more time on and paying more attention to their new side-project, Masterplan (Grapow's output on Helloween albums had dropped to barely one song per album by that point); since the others believed that Kusch and Grapow were not one hundred percent dedicated to Helloween, they were dismissed.  They were replaced by guitarist Sascha Gerstner (ex-Freedom Call, Neumond) and drummer Mark Cross (ex-Metalium, Kingdom Come, At Vance, Firewind), culminating with the recording of another studio album, titled Rabbit Don't Come Easy, in 2003. The band met Sascha via a recommendation by producer Charlie Bauerfeind. According to Grosskopf, one day he was recording something with Freedom Call \\"and later on we called him up and he went to first meet Weiki because it was very important that Weiki finds a player that he can play with and also communicate and understand. [...] So we got him on the island where we recorded and let him hang out with us a little and then he decided 'Good, let's go'.\\" Later in 2012, on an interview with Metal Shock Finland's Chief Editor, Mohsen Fayyazi, Roland stated:  Cross could not finish the album due to mononucleosis, completing only two tracks; the drum tracks were completed by Motorhead's Mikkey Dee. Stefan Schwarzmann, former drummer of Running Wild and Accept would shortly thereafter take over the drumming duties. Despite a somewhat tepid response to the album, Helloween nonetheless completed a successful world tour, highlighted by the return of classic songs such as \\"Starlight\\", \\"Murderer\\", \\"Keeper of the Seven Keys\\" and \\"How Many Tears\\" to the setlist. Additionally, the band toured the United States for the first time since 1989, playing to sold-out crowds at nearly every venue.

Provide a detailed answer so user don’t need to search outside to understand the answer. In this task, you are given a text of many news articles seperated by special token \\"|||||\\". Your task is to summarize them. Picking up on the ancestral tradition, South Carolinians have spent much of the last two years asserting various forms of independence from the federal government and attempting to block different federal laws. Now a state senator from the Palmetto State has decided it’s time for South Carolina to create its own currency.      State Sen. Lee Bright (R-Roebuck) says that federal spending and increased monetary intervention by the Fed have placed the entire US Federal Reserve system on a path to monetary collapse. And when the crash comes, state residents will need to rely on the stable South Carolina currency to weather the storm.      “If folks lose faith in the dollar, we need to have some kind of backup,” Bright told Stephen Largen of the Spartanburg Herald-Journal on Friday.      Bright’s proposed legislation states that “many widely recognized experts predict the inevitable destruction of the Federal Reserve System’s currency through hyperinflation in the foreseeable future; and …      South Carolina can avoid or at least mitigate many of the economic, social, and political shocks to be expected to arise from hyperinflation, depression, or other economic calamity related to the breakdown of the Federal Reserve System only through the timely adoption of an alternative sound currency that the state’s government and citizens may employ without delay in the event of the destruction of the Federal Reserve System’s currency.      The legislation calls for the creation of a joint legislative subcommittee which would study the “the need, means, and schedule for establishing such an alternative currency.”      Others in the state are less than impressed with the idea. “It’s a waste of time; it’s a waste of resources,” says Phil Bailey, direct of the state Senate Democratic Caucus. “I mean who’s paying for this study? Will they be paid in actual dollars or gold doubloons?”      (ed.note: Special thanks to TPM Reader TK for sending along word of this developent.) ||||| Continuing a pattern of attempts to assert South Carolina's independence from the federal government, State Sen. Lee Bright, R-Roebuck, has introduced legislation that backs the creation of a new state currency that could protect the financial stability of the Palmetto State in the event of a breakdown of the Federal Reserve System.      Bright's joint resolution calls for the creation of an eight-member joint subcommittee to study the proposal and submit a report to the General Assembly by Nov. 1.      The Federal Reserve System has come under ever-increasing strain during the last several years and will be exposed to ever-increasing and predictably debilitating strain in the years to come, according to the legislation.      “If there is an attempt to monetize the Fed we ought to at least have a study on record that could protect South Carolinians,” Bright said in an interview Friday.      “If folks lose faith in the dollar, we need to have some kind of backup.”      The legislation cites the rights reserved to states in the Constitution and Supreme Court rulings in making the case that South Carolina is within its rights to create its own currency.      “The Supreme Court of the United States has ruled that the states may adopt whatever currency they desire for the purposes of performing their sovereign governmental functions, even to the extent of adopting gold and silver coin for those purposes while refusing to employ a currency not redeemable in gold or silver coin that Congress has designated ‘legal tender.'...” Bright's legislation states.      The legislation claims “many widely recognized experts predict the inevitable destruction of the Federal Reserve System's currency through hyperinflation in the foreseeable future.”      Per the legislation, South Carolina's new currency could consist of “gold or silver, or both.”      Bright said in explaining his introduction of the legislation that Virginia and Georgia are considering similar measures to protect their states against economic calamity in the event of the collapse of the Federal Reserve System.      Phil Bailey, the director of the state Senate Democratic Caucus, described the currency bill as a distraction from the real issues facing the state.      “Not any thing in that bill is going to create a job or improve education,” Bailey said Friday.      “It's a waste of time; it's a waste of resources. I mean who's paying for this study? Will they be paid in actual dollars or gold doubloons?”      Bright responded by saying that his proposal is “something we ought to study” and “if there's no support for the bill in the body, it won't go anywhere.”      Bright's bill has been referred to the Senate Finance Committee, but he said he's working with Sen. David Thomas, R-Greenville, on the legislation, and Thomas could redraft it so that it's referred to the Banking and Insurance Committee, of which Thomas is the chair.      Bright also has introduced legislation in the ongoing legislative session that would make a firearm, firearm accessory or ammunition that is commercially or privately manufactured in South Carolina and does not leave this state exempt from federal regulation, including registration.      During the 2010 session, Bright sponsored legislation passed by the state Senate that in addition to affirming South Carolina's Second-, Ninth- and 10th-amendment rights, also targeted federal health care legislation by saying state residents are not subject to any law that interferes with patients' rights to choose their own health care provider or pay for medical services directly.      “If at first you don't secede, try again,” Bright said with a laugh after the legislation passed last year.      Secession-style language and proposals seeking to transfer power from the federal government to states and localities have become increasingly common in recent years during the fight over federal health care reform, perhaps most notably in Texas, where Republican Gov. Rick Perry in 2009 suggested the Lone Star State could secede in the future should the federal government not change its fiscal polices. |||||","output":"The text primarily details the proposal by State Sen. Lee Bright of South Carolina to develop an independent state currency. This action is an extension of South Carolina's efforts to assert its independence from the federal government and prevent the potential impact of a collapse of the Federal Reserve System on the state's economy. Bright believes that the US Federal Reserve System is heading towards a monetary collapse due to federal spending and increased intervention by the Fed. In anticipation of such an event, he argues that having a stable South Carolina currency would help residents weather the crisis. He proposes the creation of a joint legislative subcommittee to investigate the establishment of such a currency.  This bill posits that numerous experts predict the inevitable breakdown of the Federal Reserve System's currency due to hyperinflation in the foreseeable future. To insulate itself from the economic, social, and political aftermath of such a development, South Carolina must adopt an alternate sound currency that the state government and citizens can use immediately if and when the Federal Reserve System's currency is destroyed.  The proposed currency could consist of gold, silver, or both, and echoes suggestions that Virginia and Georgia are considering similar measures. Bright's legislation cites the rights reserved to states in the Constitution and Supreme Court rulings supporting the states' right to adopt their currency for executing independent government functions.  However, Phil Bailey, director of the state Senate Democratic Caucus, criticizes the idea as a diversion from pressing state issues and as a wasteful use of time and resources.  In the past, Bright has also proposed legislation to exempt locally manufactured firearms, accessories, or ammunition from federal regulations. He has pushed for more power to be transferred from the federal government to states, especially in the field of healthcare. The concept of a state adopting its own currency signals a continuation of his previous secession-style advocacies."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant. User will you give you a task.

Online acquaintances wished fair winds and following seas to Joshua Hakken as he fled to Cuba, a strange refuge for a professed fan of Ron Paul. Hakken, his wife and their two sons, 2-year-old Chase and 4-year-old Cole, were at a marina on the communist-ruled island when CNN found them aboard their small sailboat Tuesday. Florida authorities believe Hakken sailed there after abducting the two boys from the Tampa home of their grandmother, who was granted custody after Hakken's 2012 arrest on drug charges in Louisiana. \\"This all just seems like the government is yet again making real criminals out of non-violent peaceful freedom lovers,\\" wrote one commenter on \\"Adam Vs. The Man,\\" a libertarian web forum. The family's Cuban sojourn may be short-lived, as the government there announced Tuesday that it would hand them over to U.S. authorities. A man identifying himself as Hakken -- \\"a father, a registered professional mechanical engineer and a veteran of the USAF\\" -- joined the Adam Vs. The Man discussion board in February 2012 under the handle \\"Sailingbull.\\" \\"I am absolutely devoted to life, liberty, the rights of the individual and the Constitution of the United States of America,\\" he wrote. \\"Mr. Ron Paul is the ONLY politician I have ever admired or supported. It is unimaginable what the forces at be are doing and want to do to him.\\" Paul, the former Texas congressman, ran for president as a Republican in 2008 and 2012 and once as the Libertarian Party nominee, in 1988. Hakken vounteered to help Paul supporters scout out campsites near last year's Republican convention in Tampa, posting photos of site possibilities on the message board. CNN has not been able to independently confirm Hakken's identity on site, and Adam Vs. The Man founder Adam Kokesh did not respond to requests for comment. But in a post last week, after news that Hakken was wanted in connection with the abduction, he noted, \\"I feel like we're in a position to help here. Maybe to reach out to him. Certainly seems like a stupid way to go about this, regardless of what your moral assessment is.\\" Both Hakken and his wife, Sharyn, held professional engineering certificates -- hers in civil engineering, his in the mechanical and fire-protection specialties, according to state records. After high school, he attended the Air Force Academy in Colorado from June 1996 to May 1998, academy spokesman Meade Warthen told CNN. Online, Hakken said he left because of a previously undiagnosed spinal condition; Warthen said the academy couldn't comment on the reason for his withdrawal. The couple's legal woes began last June with what police called a \\"disturbance\\" at a hotel in Slidell, Louisiana, just east of New Orleans. \\"When police arrived, both Mr. and Mrs. Hakken were acting in a bizarre manner that alarmed officers,\\" a Slidell police statement recounts. \\"They were talking about 'completing their ultimate journey' and were traveling across the country to 'take a journey to the Armageddon.' Let it be noted that both of their children were present in the hotel room at the time.\\" Police said they found both drugs and weapons in the room and called in the state Office of Child Services, which \\"determined that the children were in danger\\" and took them into their custody. Hakken was charged with marijuana possession, possession of drug paraphernalia and the use of a controlled substance around minors; \\"Officers also took custody of several weapons for safe keeping.\\" The Office of Child Services told CNN it would not comment on the case. The children were put into foster care with a family in Tangipahoa Parish, north of Lake Pontchartrain. Two weeks after the arrest, the foster mother called 911 and told dispatchers, \\"I need a cop now. I have a guy at my house with a gun.\\" \\"I have two foster children, and it's their dad ... I don't hear banging, but I'm not getting out 'til a cop car gets here,\\" she said. Hakken left without the boys, who later were sent to live with Patricia Hauser, Sharyn Hakken's mother, in Tampa. On April 2, a Louisiana court terminated the couple's parental rights, investigators say. The following day, Hillsborough County authorities say Hakken entered Hauser's home, tied her up and took off in her Toyota Camry with the boys.

A helicopter A:","output":"Title: \\"Crimson Skies\\" Genre: Action, Thriller Plot Summary: When a top-secret military experiment goes wrong on a remote island, the island becomes surrounded by an electromagnetic dome, making all forms of communication black out. The only way in or out is through a mysterious portal in the sky that can only be accessed by helicopter. As tensions rise between the researchers trapped on the island and various powerful nations vying for control of the experiment, a race against time begins to save the people on the island as well as the world from an escalating global conflict. Plot Outline: Protagonist Dr. Jane Marshall, a brilliant scientist employed by the government, leads a top-secret research team on a remote island. Their mission is to harness the power of the elusive \\"Crimson Particle\\", a new form of energy that could revolutionize global power dynamics. As the team makes a breakthrough in their research, an unforeseen accident occurs, creating an impenetrable electromagnetic dome around the island. All communications are cut off, leaving the research team stranded and confused, with no way to convey their plight. The military's nearest base, under the command of Colonel Harris, quickly springs into action after losing contact with the island. They discover the only way in or out of the dome is through a mysterious portal in the sky that can only fit a helicopter. Harris assembles an elite team of skilled operatives, who are experts in combat and extraction. As news of the research incident leaks out, various powerful nations express their interest in obtaining the \\"Crimson Particle\\" technology, turning the island into a battlefield between international forces, each trying to capture the research team and their prize. Amidst the chaos, an international terrorist group infiltrates the island, intending to exploit the situation and sell the technology to the highest bidder. Dr. Marshall must now team up with Colonel Harris and his elite helicopter squad to navigate through the treacherous foreign forces and the villainous terrorists. They engage in thrilling helicopter combat and espionage as they battle to save the scientists and prevent the particle technology from falling into the wrong hands. As the movie reaches its climax, the team successfully rescues as many researchers as possible and shuts down the experiment just before the portal collapses. Dr. Marshall and Colonel Harris fiercely battle with the ruthless leader of the terrorist group, bringing the villain to justice. The world breathes a collective sigh of relief as the electromagnetic dome disperses, preventing the imminent global conflict. The movie ends with Dr. Marshall and the remaining researchers debriefing with top government officials, as they contemplate the future applications of the \\"Crimson Particle\\" technology. Meanwhile, Colonel Harris and his helicopter squad are celebrated as heroes who prevented a global disaster, and their thrilling adventures inspire future generations of operatives.

Question: What did Beef say they would find to make Spencer's sister's Christmas better? Movie plot title: Unaccompanied Minors Movie plot: Spencer Davenport and his sister Katherine must fly from California to Pennsylvania on Christmas Eve to spend the holidays with their dad, an environmentalist. Unfortunately, during their layover at the Hoover International Airport in Chicago, a massive blizzard grounds all planes and cancels all flights, and the siblings are sent to the anarchic UM (unaccompanied minors') room, where they meet Christmas-spirited smarty-pants Charlie Goldfinch, surly tomboy Donna Malone, arrogant rich girl Grace Conrad, and mysterious Beef Wellington. Charlie, Spencer, Beef, Grace and Donna sneak out, and proceed to enjoy themselves around the airport. When they are caught by the airport security guards and returned to the UM room, they find that the other minors, Katherine included, have been sent to a lodge down the road, and that the grouchy head of passenger relations, Oliver Porter â whose trip to Hawaii is among the canceled flights â intends for the kids to spend Christmas Eve in the UM room. Knowing that it will break Katherine's faith in Santa Claus if she does not receive a present by the next morning, Spencer asks the others to help him get a present for his sister in return for a plan to escape. With Spencer's plan, the minors give Zach Van Bourke, the friendly clerk watching them, the slip, but Mr. Porter grows desperate to get the kids back, and sends all the airport guards to find them. After Donna and Grace get into a fight, Spencer decides that they're going to have to put their differences aside and work together as a team, and Beef leaves to go and get a Christmas tree. Along the way, he reflects on how his step-father, Ernie, hoped to make him stronger by saying men are made, not born. Meanwhile, Spencer and Katherine's father tries to drive to the airport in his biodiesel fueled car, but it eventually breaks down at a gas station. Fortunately, the owner lets him borrow a Hummer.

My first impression would be this is Beowulf only with all the good bits of fighting Grendel and dragons intact, making it one thrill ride from start to end. Written by Frederic Lanoir and Arthur Qwak, the two of them had created a fantastical landscape that becomes a character in itself within their story, with its ever changing environment made up of small spheres of land floating around, which can either be wastelands, or globes of greenery. The story's a simple one, which tells of a land which is cowering in the expectation of a mighty dragon's unwanted visit to plunder and destroy, and the resident knights have all but been annihilated. Enter the king's granddaughter Zoe (Marie Drion) who gathers Lian-Chu (Vincent Lindon), a huge brute with immense strength but truly a gentle giant, and his partner-in-arms Gwizdo (Patrick Timsit), who balances the partnership with his cunning brain. Lian-Chu and Gwizdo (together with their pet creature which too proudly spews incipient fires) share a common dream of owning a farm land and spending idyllic days tending to their farm animals in retirement, but in order to do that comes the requirement of being financially free, hence their career in monster-extermination which doesn't exactly pay off. That's basically the whole gist of it, but what makes this film a spectacle, is its CG graphics, which is solidly rich, detailed, and an eye-popping marvel to behold. It has some wonderfully crafted set action pieces that were painstakingly designed to draw you into the thick of the action,, and during those fight sequences, there's nary a boring moment. Photo-realistic moments of non-existent landscapes make you put aside the fantasy of make-belief, and it's easy to be in awe of the landscape which goes beyond the usual three-suns and a kaleidoscope of flying thingamajigs (here's having at you George!) And I couldn't get enough of the finale battle as well, though the usual brick-bats will find some fault at the indestructibility of the principle characters. I guess this film had opened my eyes that there are many more computer-animated companies out there around the world that have quality in their product to match that of Pixar's. And this is definitely a movie that the local filmmakers of Zodiac: The Race Begins and Legend of the Sea can learn from  to keep the story effectively simple, and let your moving artwork do all the talking.

Please write a short summary for the following article: Why the early 2015 college football rankings like ASU, Arizona Updated JAN 13, 2015 4:50p ET Late night host Jimmy Kimmel's pick for the Arizona State Sun Devils to win the College Football Playoff on Monday was ludicrous. So here's FOX Sports football analyst Petros Papadakis being equally high on the Sun Devils while bringing us closer to reality. Papadakis included ASU as one of his four teams for next year's playoff. Bold, yes. Out of the realm of possibility? No. With Marcus Mariota leaving Oregon for the NFL, the Pac-12 South champion in 2015 could have a shot at making the College Football Playoff. Getting out of the division will again be the tricky part, but both Arizona schools are positioned to be in the mix. Arizona won the division title in 2014 because of the math, but fans were still left wondering which Pac-12 South team was the best. UCLA finished 10th in the final USA Today Coaches poll of the season, ahead of 14th-ranked ASU and 17th-ranked Arizona. The Bruins also finished 10th in the Associated Press poll, again in front of 12th-ranked ASU and 19th-ranked Arizona. USC and Utah weren't far behind. Vetting the final rankings is a process for bragging rights more than a useful projection for next season, but that's why we're moving on with the help of some smart college football folks. Here are where three experts pick the Wildcats and Sun Devils heading into 2015: FOX Sports' Stewart Mandel: ASU (12th), Arizona (17th) ESPN's Mark Schlabach: Arizona (13th), ASU (15th) USA Today's Paul Myerberg: ASU (11th), Arizona (15th) Now, to what factors have helped the rivals gain positive reviews heading into 2015, and why both ASU and Arizona should challenge for the Pac-12 South title: Coaching staff continuity can't be overlooked, and it's an important factor for Arizona and Arizona State. Rich Rodriguez's close-knit coaching staff seems stable, while Todd Graham's lead assistant, offensive coordinator Mike Norvell, didn't receive a head coaching offer strong enough to pull him out of Tempe. Meanwhile, the Utah Utes wait anxiously to see if reports of head coach Kyle Whittingham wanting out will come true. Even if they don't, Utah took a big blow when offensive coordinator Dave Christensen left for Texas A&M despite a successful first season with the Utes. The Utes also lost defensive coordinator Kalani Sitake and defensive line coach Ilaisa Tuikai. USC should be in decent shape in the second year under Steve Sarkisian, though the Trojans did lose offensive line coach Tim Drevno, who will become Jim Harbaugh's offensive coordinator at Michigan. And there will always be rumors that UCLA coach Jim Mora could leave for the NFL, though nothing to this point seems past the point of speculation. Do-it-all Sun Devil D.J. Foster will return foe his senior year with ASU, and the Sun Devils know what they'll get out of quarterback Mike Bercovici. Sixteen starters will be back for Graham's team, and that's good enough reason for Papadakis to make a surprising pick despite the departure of receiver Jaelen Strong. At Arizona, quarterback Anu Solomon will likely return as a smarter, more determined player in 2015 after he put the blame on himself following the Wildcats' Fiesta Bowl loss to Boise State. Rodriguez hasn't handed him the starting job, but it would be a surprise if he wasn't behind center with stud running back Nick Wilson by his side. And the Wildcats can't be discussed without mentioning linebacker Scooby Wright, who piled up numerous national awards as a sophomore. Elsewhere in the Pac-12 South, there are significant holes to fill. UCLA will move on without Brett Hundley leading the offense, while Utah will miss standout defensive end Nate Orchard. USC returns Cody Kesler at quarterback but will need to replace defensive end Leonard Williams, running back Buck Allen and receiver Nelson Agholor. If there is any team equipped to deal with such losses, it's the Trojans. USC is arguably the favorite to win the division, and part of the reasoning is its fourth-ranked recruiting class, per Scout. Graham's incoming class at ASU is ranked 20th -- the third-best in the Pac-12 and behind only the Trojans and No. 9 UCLA. Arizona's class finds itself down the ladder at 35th, but there's something to be said for Rodriguez's eye for talent. Just look at Wright, and it's clear the Wildcats know what types of players fit their system and identity, even if the number of stars don't impress.

Think like you are answering to a five year old. By. Pa Reporter. Chris Kirk shot a bogey-free final round to clinch the Deutsche Bank Championship at TPC Boston with Rory McIlroy unable to mount a challenge on the final day. The American, who was joint third with McIlroy and Jason Day on 10 under going into the final day, carded five birdies in a final-round 66 to beat Australia's Geoff Ogilvy and fellow Americans Russell Henley and Billy Horschel by two shots. 'Biggest win I ever had,' Kirk said on pgatour.com shortly after sealing victory on 15 under overall. 'I may be a little bit more calm, but I was still freaking out a bit inside.' Glory: Chris Kirk (right) is presented with the winner's trophy by CEO of Deutsche Bank Jacques Brand. What might have been: Rory McIlroy trudges off the 18th green after a disappointing final round. Kirk's victory in the second of the four play-off events means the 29-year-old American now leads the FedEx Cup standings. It is only his third PGA Tour career title. He wasted no time in eating into Henley's two-shot overnight lead by birdieing the third and fourth holes, while a further birdie on the ninth meant he had picked up three shots in the opening nine holes. Kirk made par on the next three before birdieing again on the 13th and repeating the feat for the fifth and final time of his round on the 16th before finishing with two more pars. In the swing: Kirk  takes his approach shot on the sixth hole at TPC Boston on Monday. In the long grass: World No 1 McIlroy hits out of trouble on the sixth hole on his way to a fifth place finish. Going for the flag: Kirk chips to the second green during the final round of the Deutsche Bank Championship. Best man won: McIlroy congratulates Kirk after their round on the biggest win of his career to date. Kirk's victory gives United States captain Tom Watson plenty to ponder ahead of the Ryder Cup at Gleneagles later this month. Watson chooses his three wildcard picks on Tuesday and Kirk has done his chances of selection no harm at all. 'I definitely put myself in contention for one,' Kirk said when asked about his Ryder Cup chances. 'If I get picked, great. If not, I'm still happy with my win today.' World No 1 McIlroy, who had catapulted himself into contention with a flawless seven-under 64 on Sunday, could not secure his fourth title in five tournaments after recording four bogeys in his final-round 70 to finish joint fifth with Australia's John Senden on 11 under. They were two shots shy of the second-placed trio of Ogilvy, Henley and Horschel. Martin Kaymer and Day were tied for seventh on 10 under, while Sweden's Carl Pettersson and Jimmy Walker of America were two of seven players tied for ninth place on nine under. World No 2 Adam Scott had to be content with a joint 16th-placed finish with six others on eight under, while England's Ian Poulter was a further shot back to finish alongside Jim Furyk and Rickie Fowler. Here is a summary of the highlights for this article:","output":"A golfer named Chris Kirk played a really great game and won the Deutsche Bank Championship at a place called TPC Boston. He didn't make any mistakes and scored five birdies in the final round, which helped him win. Rory McIlroy, another golfer who is very good, didn't play as well as he wanted to on the last day and didn't win. This win is very important for Chris Kirk because now he might be chosen to play in a big golf competition called the Ryder Cup."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant. You will be given a task.

Q:Write a multi-choice question for the following article: Article: Their cheery song brightens many a winter's day. But robins are in danger of wearing themselves out by singing too much. Robins are singing all nightas well as during the day, British-based researchers say. David Dominoni, of Glasgow University, said that light from street lamps, takeaway signs and homes is affecting the birds' biological clock, leading to them being wide awake when they should be asleep. Dr Dominoni, who is putting cameras inside nesting boxes to track sleeping patterns, said lack of sleep could put the birds' health at risk. His study shows that when robins are exposed to light at night in the lab, it leads to some genes being active at the wrong time of day. And the more birds are exposed to light, the more active they are at night. He told people at a conference, \\"There have been a couple of studies suggesting they are increasing their song output at night and during the day they are still singing. Singing is a costly behaviour and it takes energy. So by increasing their song output, there might be some costs of energy.\\" And it is not just robins that are being kept awake by artificial light. Blackoiids and seagulls are also being more nocturnal. Dr Dominoni said, \\"In Glasgow where I live, gulls are a serious problem. I have people coming to me saying \`You are the bird expert. Can you help us kill these gulls?'.During the breeding season, between April and June, they are very active at night and very noisy and people can't sleep.\\" Although Dr Dominoni has only studied light pollution, other research concluded that robins living in noisy cities have started to sing at night to make themselves heard over loud noise. However, some birds thrive in noisy environments. A study from California Polytechnic University found more hummingbirds in areas with heavy industrial machinery. It is thought that they are capitalising on their predators fleeing to quieter areas. A:","output":"Which factor is primarily causing robins to sing at night and potentially affecting their health according to the study conducted by Dr. David Dominoni? A.

While performing the task think step-by-step and justify your steps. Summarize the following: If you are continuing to have difficulty with managing your anxiety and triggers, therapy may be a beneficial option to help you better handle your symptoms. Professional counselors and therapists are trained specifically to help with coping skills such as anxiety triggers.  Find therapists in your area by getting a list of providers through your health insurance. Consider contacting your school counselor, university counseling center, or your work’s Employee Assistance Program for referrals to counseling. Find out about if the therapist has expertise in your anxiety triggers. You can even ask the therapist what kind of evidence-based practices they use. Different types of therapy techniques include CBT, DBT, Solution Focused, Strengths Based, and Prolonged Exposure Therapy. Research the techniques the therapist uses to learn more about them. There may be other treatment options to help with your anxiety if it continues to impair your daily life.  Unavoidable anxiety triggers mean that you may have to encounter certain people or situations regularly and feel overwhelmed often.  Talk with your health care provider or a mental health specialist about medication options if other strategies are not working for you.  A doctor or psychiatrist can prescribe medications to help with your symptoms.  Talk with your primary care provider about options or a referral to a specialist for advice. Talk with a mental health specialist about your medication treatment, and whether it has been beneficial.  Often a combination of medication and therapy are best for severe anxiety. Many people face anxiety that is overwhelming and unavoidable.  Depending on the type of anxiety that you’re facing, talk with a counselor or therapist about support groups in your area.  Support groups are often less expensive than individual therapy. Working as a group on your anxiety symptoms can help you feel less isolated or judged.  A support group is a safe space to engage with others about your concerns. Many support groups are led by trained mental health professionals or peer support specialists who have been through the same anxious feelings as you. Avoid isolating yourself when anxiety hits.  Often this action will in turn make you feel less willing to handle anxiety the next time.  After an anxiety-provoking situation has occurred, instead focus on turning to friends or family that support and reassure you.  Have two or three friends or family that you can call when you’re feeling anxious or overwhelmed.  Talk with them in advance about them acting as your “calling buddies.” Do activities with your friends or family.  If you are hesitant to do things in groups, then find activities to do with just one friend or family member. Trust and confide in them.  The people that love and care about you often want to be helpful and supportive as you learn to handle your anxiety.","output":"You may consider therapy if you are having difficulties managing anxiety and triggers.

Runoff carries it away. The fertilizer ends up in bodies of water, from ponds to oceans. Nitrogen is a fertilizer in the water. Since there is a lot of nitrogen, it causes algae to grow out of control. Pictured below is a pond covered with algae ( Figure below ). Algae use up carbon dioxide in the water. After the algae die, decomposers break down the dead tissue. The decomposers use up all the oxygen in the water. This creates a dead zone. A dead zone is an area in a body of water where nothing grows because there is too little oxygen. There is a large dead zone in the Gulf of Mexico ( Figure below ). The U.S. states outlined on the map have rivers that drain into the Gulf of Mexico. The rivers drain vast agricultural lands. The water carries fertilizer from these areas into the Gulf.  and the situation: In central Ireland there are two farms next to two very similar lakes, and both farms use the same fertilizer to grow crops. The farm next to lake Montopeke gets rain on a regular basis and so the farmer doesn't need to water his crops as much. The farm that is adjacent to lake Costanza hardly gets any rain at all though. Both farms are able to prosper and do well though despite the different amount of rain they get.  Answer the following question: Which lake will have more dead zones? A:","output":"Lake Montopeke is more likely to have more dead zones. This is because the farm next to Lake Montopeke gets rain on a regular basis, which dissolves the fertilizer in the soil. The runoff from the rain then carries the dissolved fertilizer away, and it ultimately ends up in the nearby Lake Montopeke. This introduction of nitrogen from the fertilizer promotes excessive algae growth in the lake. As the algae use up carbon dioxide and then die, decomposers break down the dead tissue, using up the oxygen in the water. This process can lead to the creation of dead zones, or areas with too little oxygen to support most aquatic life. On the other hand, the farm adjacent to Lake Costanza receives less rain, and as a result, there is less opportunity for runoff carrying dissolved fertilizer into the lake. Therefore, Lake Costanza is less likely to be subjected to the same degree of nutrient enrichment and subsequent dead zone formation as Lake Montopeke."},{"instruction":"Given the task definition and input, reply with output.

You will be given a task. You must generate a detailed and long answer. Summarize the following: Determine where your property line is before you start so that you don't accidentally go over. The best advice is to hire a Registered Land Surveyor in your home state to mark the property line for you before you begin construction. Your city or town usually does not keep very detailed records of your property's boundary information. GIS (geographic information system) maps and Assessors maps are highly inaccurate when it comes to property boundaries. You can search for PropertySurvey Pins on your property. These are also located on the corners of a lot. Just because an old fence or other “assumed” property boundary wasis in place that does not always mean that it is correct. Choose a fence height before getting too far into the project. Six foot is normal for a privacy fence, a livestock fence four feet high is usually sufficient, and picket fences are often three feet high. Fence height is important in the early stages, as it determines things like post hole depth. Most cities have a height ordinance, so be sure to check this before you choose your fence height. Place stakes at the corners roughly where you wish your fence to go. Tie a string around the stakes and run the string between stakes. Use a square or square-level to make sure that the corners\\" where our stakes are placed are squared (the two sides form a 90° angle).   You can also square the corners by measuring the strings. Measure 3' on one side and 4' on the other. If the distance between the two marks (diagonally) is equal to 5', then the corner is square. Measure out lengths of 8' or less along the strings once you've square your corners and stake those locations to indicate the location for your support posts.  You generally want to take the total distance and divide it by 8 but if you have a length of fence that is not divisible by 8, you'll need to break it down into smaller sections. For example, a 24' fence would need 2 middle posts to create the three 8' sections, but a 25' fence would need 3 middle posts at 6.25' for each section in order to look even and be structurally sound. To find the length and number for odd fence lengths, go up to the next number of posts and then divide the total length of the fence by the number of resulting sections. Use a post-hole digger to dig holes at the locations you staked. The posts will need to be buried at least 33% as deep as they are tall (example: an 8' high fence needs a hole 2.5' deep), so your hole will need to be at least that depth plus a few extra inches.  The hole should be wide enough that there is room around the post when you put it in. Because soil conditions vary, and the height of the fence, the type of fencing, and other factors must be considered in determining how deep the post should be, you will have to calculate the hole depth for yourself. Place 3-4\\" of gravel at the bottom of the hole. Place the post in the hole and get it into alignment. Check to make sure that the corners are still square, use a post leveler to make sure it is straight, and make sure it is sitting at the correct height. Carefully holding your post in place, pour in instant concrete until the hole is 2/3 full. Add water to the top and use a stirring stick to mix the cement. Prop the post into place (stabilize using temporary nailed boards if necessary) and allow the concrete to set following the manufacturer's instructions. Fill any remainder of the hole with dirt once the concrete has set. Pull a builder's line from one end post to the other, at an equal height above the ground, preferably at the top of the post (if your posts were placed correctly). This will help you keep the height of the fence the same along the way. Cut 2x4 rails (or horizontal support boards) to the appropriate length to reach between the centers of the posts. If you can, use a single rail for the entire length of the fence section. Rails should be no more than 24\\" apart, so most fences will have 2-3 rails. Attach the rails using decking screws. With your support boards in place, you can attach your pickets (vertical boards, also called privacy boards). There are many different styles and ways of doing this, depending on how you want your fence to look. The most basic is a board on board fence, where the fence boards are nailed (using a nail gun, nailed at the support boards) with the distance of less than one board between them. Place the first board up and then use a level to “plumb” (vertical level) the board. Then, nail or screw the board in place. Use a spacer and then place the next board. Use the level periodically to check that it is “plumb.”   These boards are usually 1X6 rough sawn lumber but you can buy other pre-cut fencing boards as well. If nailing the boards by hand, use 8d spiral shank galvanized nails. Once you're done, you will want to treat the boards to increase the longevity of your fence. You can paint your fence, stain it, or simply apply a weather-proofing finish to keep your fence looking great for years to come. Enjoy! This will usually either contain silicone solids, or linseed oil.  If you plan on painting a finish paint, stick with an oil-based sealer, and use an oil-based polyurethane paint or exterior enamel for the finish paint.","output":"To build a fence, it is crucial to first determine your property line by hiring a Registered Land Surveyor. Make sure to choose the fence's height beforehand, keeping in mind local height ordinances. Start by placing stakes at the corners of the area you want to cover and tie a string between them, ensuring the corners are squared and forming 90-degree angles. You can also use the 3-4-5 rule to square the corners. Once the corners are squared, measure out lengths of 8 feet or less along the strings to mark the locations for your support posts. Use a post-hole digger to dig holes at these locations. The holes should be deep enough to bury a suitable portion of the post, which is dependent on various factors such as fence height, soil conditions, and the type of fencing. Place gravel at the bottom of each hole and position the posts accordingly. Use a post leveler to ensure the posts are straight and aligned. Pour instant concrete into the hole up to 2/3 of its depth, mix with water, and let it set. Once the concrete has set, fill the rest of the hole with dirt. Pull a builder's line between the end posts to keep the fence height consistent. Cut 2x4 rails as horizontal support boards to reach between the centers of the posts and attach them using decking screws. Space rails no more than 24\\" apart. Attach the pickets (vertical boards) following the chosen fence style and use a level to ensure that they are vertically level. Nail or screw the boards in place, using spacers for even placement.

Article: If the rose can be said to be a special flower, then the apple can be said to be a special fruit. It is very important in American culture. American stories speak of Johnny Appleseed, who went throughout America collecting apple seeds and planting apple trees. He had a great love for nature and went through fields and farms adding richness and beauty to the country. One of the first sayings taught to school children is, \\"An apple a day keeps the doctor away.\\" This short saying encourages children to eat fresh fruit to keep healthy. If someone always says good words to a person, people will call him an _ . This, however, is not a good name. If someone is very dear to us, we say that he or she is the \\"apple of our eye\\". Most people believe that the fruit which Eve gave to Adam was an apple, even though the Bible  never says so. The apple, therefore, is a deep part of the language and stories of America. An apple is also delicious. Apples can be cooked in many ways, used as a dessert   , and made into sweet juice. In many parts of the country during the harvest season, a popular activity is to go into an apple garden to pick apples. Washington, D. C. and New York are both famous for their apples. Finally, when it's time to take a vacation to American cities, one can always visit New York, which is \\"the biggest apple\\" of all the American cities.

Provide a detailed answer so user don’t need to search outside to understand the answer. Q:Information:  - Pissed Jeans are an American noise rock/hardcore punk band from Allentown, Pennsylvania. The band claims to play \\"loud, heavy, noisy, punk rock\\" and is influenced by 1980s hardcore punk and post-hardcore bands. The band have released several 7\\" singles and four albums, and are currently signed to Sub Pop. In March 2013, Pissed Jeans was named one of Fuse TV's 30 must-see artists at SXSW.  - Hardcore punk (often abbreviated to hardcore) is a punk rock music genre that originated in the late 1970s. It is generally faster, harder, and more aggressive than other forms of punk rock. Its roots can be traced to earlier punk scenes in San Francisco and Southern California which arose as a reaction against the still predominant hippie cultural climate of the time and was also inspired by New York punk rock and early proto-punk. New York punk had a harder-edged sound than its San Francisco counterpart, featuring anti-art expressions of masculine anger, energy and subversive humor. Hardcore punk generally disavows commercialism, the established music industry and \\"anything similar to the characteristics of mainstream rock\\" and often addresses social and political topics.  - Post-hardcore is a punk rock music genre that derives from hardcore punk, maintaining hardcore's aggression and intensity, but emphasizes a greater degree of creative expression initially inspired by post-punk and noise rock. Like post-punk, the term has been applied to a broad constellation of groups. The genre took shape in the mid to late 1980s with releases by bands from cities that had established hardcore scenes, such as Fugazi from Washington, D.C. as well as groups such as Big Black and Jawbox that stuck closer to post-hardcore's noise rock roots.  - Noise rock is a style of experimental rock rooted in noise music. The genre, which gained prominence in the 1980s, makes use of the traditional instrumentation and iconography of rock music, but incorporates atonality and especially dissonance, and frequently discards typical songwriting conventions. Noise rock developed from early avant-garde music, sound art, and rock songs featuring extremely dissonant sounds and electronic feedback. The New York no wave scene, featuring such artists as Mars and Teenage Jesus and the Jerks in the late 1970s, was an essential development in noise rock.   - Hope For Men is a 2007 album by Pissed Jeans . The lyrics of many of the songs are about very mundane subjects , such as eating ice cream and scrapbooking , in sharp contrast to the frenzied vocals and loud , off - key instrumentals . The tracks \`\` Scrapbooking '' and \`\` The Jogger '' are essentially spoken - word tracks , the latter with a crashing guitar backdrop .  - Sub Pop is a record label founded in 1986 by Bruce Pavitt. In 1988, Sub Pop Records LLC was formed by Pavitt and Jonathan Poneman in Seattle, Washington. Sub Pop achieved fame in the late 1980s for first signing Nirvana, Soundgarden, Mudhoney and many other bands from the Seattle alternative rock scene. They are often credited with taking the first steps toward popularizing grunge music, and have continued to achieve critical and commercial success in the new millennium, with bands such as Fleet Foxes, Foals, Beach House, The Postal Service, Flight of the Conchords, Sleater-Kinney, Blitzen Trapper, No Age, Wolf Parade and The Shins on their roster. In 1995 the owners of Sub Pop sold a 49% stake of the label to the Warner Music Group.  - Albums of recorded music were developed in the early 20th century, first as books of individual 78rpm records, then from 1948 as vinyl LP records played at  rpm. Vinyl LPs are still issued, though in the 21st century album sales have mostly focused on compact disc (CD) and MP3 formats.

But while this monumental event begins to unfold, it is marred by the ongoing security guard fiasco that has entangled the city in recent weeks. In this article, we take a glimpse at the journey the flame will embark on, led by a Royal Marine commando, and discuss the somber backdrop of the security guard crisis that continues to overshadow the upcoming Olympic Games. The Flame's Arrival: The Olympic torch relay holds a special place in the hearts of sports enthusiasts and casual onlookers alike, as it represents the unity, dedication, and indomitable spirit of athletes worldwide. As such, the organizers have orchestrated a grand entrance for the flame, with a Royal Marine commando bringing it into the Tower of London via helicopter. This thrilling spectacle will undoubtedly draw the attention of Londoners and the world, serving as an awe-inspiring start to a week-long relay leading up to the Games themselves. Torchbearers and the 200-mile Journey: Over the course of this week, the Olympic flame will be transported through 200 miles of London streets, passed from one torchbearer to another. Each torchbearer has been carefully selected, many due to their inspiring stories and dedication to their communities. As they carry the torch, they will simultaneously represent and celebrate the spirit of the Olympic Games, embodying the values of perseverance, teamwork, and sportsmanship that have come to be synonymous with this international event. The Security Guard Fiasco: Unfortunately, as the Olympic flame makes its way through the city, its bright glow has been tarnished somewhat by the ongoing fiasco regarding security guards for the Games. The buildup to the Olympics has been plagued by scandals involving the contractors responsible for providing security, with reports of insufficient guards, undertrained staff, and compromised safety measures. This has led to increasing concerns over the safety of the athletes, spectators, and the city itself during the Games, casting an unfortunate shadow over what should be a time of global unity and celebration. Conclusion: In the face of the security guard fiasco, the Olympic flame's journey through London serves as a beacon of hope and inspiration. The image of a Royal Marine commando carrying the torch into the Tower of London, coupled with the hundreds of torchbearers who will follow in his footsteps, is a poignant testament to the strength and resilience that the Olympic Games represent. One can only hope that the city's authorities can resolve the security concerns and allow the true spirit of the Olympics to shine through when the Games commence on July 27."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Answer based on context: During the Ottoman period, the citys population of Ottomans Muslims (including those of Turkish people and Albanians origin, as well as Bulgarian Muslim and Greek Muslim convert origin) grew substantially. According to the 1478 census Selânik (), as the city came to be known in Ottoman Turkish, had 6,094 Greek Orthodox households, 4,320 Muslim ones, and some Catholic. No Jews were recorded in the census suggesting that the subsequent influx of Jewish population was not linked to the already existing Romaniote Jews community. Soon after the turn of the 15th to 16th century, however, nearly 20,000 Sephardic Jews immigrated to Greece from the Iberian Peninsula following their expulsion from Spain by the 1492 Alhambra Decree. By c. 1500, the number of households had grown to 7,986 Greek ones, 8,575 Muslim ones, and 3,770 Jewish. By 1519, Sephardic Jewish households numbered 15,715, 54% of the citys population. Some historians consider the Ottoman regimes invitation to Jewish settlement was a strategy to prevent the ethnic Greek population from dominating the city. How many more Jewish households were there in Selânik in 1519 than there had been in 1500?","output":"In the year 1500, there were 3,770 Jewish households in Selânik. By the year 1519, the number of Jewish households had increased to 15,715.  To find out the increase in the number of Jewish households from 1500 to 1519, you can simply subtract the number of Jewish households in 1500 from the number in 1519.  So, 15,715 (the number in 1519) minus 3,770 (the number in 1500) equals 11,945.  Therefore, there were 11,945 more Jewish households in Selânik in 1519 than there had been in the year 1500.  This significant increase may be attributed primarily to the influx of Sephardic Jews who migrated to Greece from the Iberian Peninsula following their expulsion from Spain under the 1492 Alhambra Decree. This historical event led to a considerable shift in the population composition of Selânik, with Sephardic Jewish households constituting 54% of the city's total population by 1519. The Ottoman regime’s invitation to Jewish settlement could have been viewed as a strategic move to counterbalance the ethnic Greek population and prevent it from dominating the city."},{"instruction":"Answer the following question: What are the worst examples of false advertising you've seen?

Q:Read the following paragraph and extract the answer for the question: What is the name of the object that the musician who married the daughter of a senior British army officer was believed to be the first to take seriously?  Sir Edward William Elgar, 1st Baronet  (; 2 June 1857 – 23 February 1934) was an English composer, many of whose works have entered the British and international classical concert repertoire. Among his best-known compositions are orchestral works including the Enigma Variations, the Pomp and Circumstance Marches, concertos for violin and cello, and two symphonies. He also composed choral works, including The Dream of Gerontius, chamber music and songs. He was appointed Master of the King's Musick in 1924. Although Elgar is often regarded as a typically English composer, most of his musical influences were not from England but from continental Europe. He felt himself to be an outsider, not only musically, but socially. In musical circles dominated by academics, he was a self-taught composer; in Protestant Britain, his Roman Catholicism was regarded with suspicion in some quarters; and in the class-conscious society of Victorian and Edwardian Britain, he was acutely sensitive about his humble origins even after he achieved recognition. He nevertheless married the daughter of a senior British army officer. She inspired him both musically and socially, but he struggled to achieve success until his forties, when after a series of moderately successful works his Enigma Variations (1899) became immediately popular in Britain and overseas. He followed the Variations with a choral work, The Dream of Gerontius (1900), based on a Roman Catholic text that caused some disquiet in the Anglican establishment in Britain, but it became, and has remained, a core repertory work in Britain and elsewhere. His later full-length religious choral works were well received but have not entered the regular repertory. In his fifties, Elgar composed a symphony and a violin concerto that were immensely successful. His second symphony and his cello concerto did not gain immediate public popularity and took many years to achieve a regular place in the concert repertory of British orchestras.

First, I go to Roy Senior high School. I'm happy on the first night in America because I live with a kind family, the Edwards. It's a big family. They are very friendly to me. They help me do many things. When I want to write to my friends, they buy _ for me; when I lose my camera, they help me buy a new one. After some days, I go to another school in New Haven. I live in the Palumbos' house. There are three people in the family. I'm surprised that the parents are from two countries. It is a nice trip and I'm happy to be with the two families.

Can we infer the following? \\"Child labor\\" is illegal in Canada, but it is legal in the United States.","output":"In order to infer whether the statement is true or false, we need to gather information about child labor laws in both Canada and the United States.  Step 1: Research Canadian child labor laws  I researched Canadian child labor laws and found that the minimum working age varies by province, but generally, it is set between 14 and 16 years old. There are also restrictions on the type of work and hours that minors can be employed, which are designed to protect children and ensure they have access to education. Step 2: Research U.S. child labor laws I researched the child labor laws in the United States and found that under the Fair Labor Standards Act, the minimum working age is 14 for non-agricultural jobs and the U.S. has strict rules regarding the hours and conditions under which minors may work.  Step 3: Analyze the information Based on the information gathered, both Canada and the United States have laws in place to protect children from harmful or exploitative work that could affect their health, safety, and access to education. Conclusion: The statement \\"Child labor is illegal in Canada, but it is legal in the United States\\" is not accurate because both countries have regulations against exploitative or harmful child labor.

Which of the following is the supposed perturbation?  - directly impacting a step of the process - indirectly impacting a step of the process - not impacting any step of the process A:","output":"The supposed perturbation in the given situation is that the lungs remove more oxygen from the air than usual. Let's analyze the steps and determine how this specific perturbation might affect the process of oxygen diffusion into cells from capillaries, focusing on the distinction between direct, indirect, and no impact on the process. 1. Air goes into the lungs: This step remains unchanged because the perturbation only affects the amount of oxygen removed from the air, not the physical process of air entering the lungs. 2. The lungs remove more oxygen from the air: This is the supposed perturbation and directly impacts this step of the process. The increased efficiency in oxygen removal leads to a higher concentration of oxygen in the air within the lungs, which might result in the increased availability of oxygen to diffuse. 3. Oxygen diffuses from alveoli in the lungs to the bloodstream: With a higher concentration of oxygen in the lungs resulting from the perturbation, the diffusion from alveoli to the bloodstream will be indirectly impacted. Higher concentration gradients tend to increase the rate of diffusion, thereby potentially allowing more oxygen to enter the bloodstream. 4. Hemoglobin in red blood cells attaches to the oxygen: Increased oxygen concentration in the bloodstream means that there is more available oxygen for hemoglobin to bind. Since the concentration of hemoglobin remains constant, this step will be indirectly impacted, and the overall oxygen-carrying capacity increases. 5. Red blood cells carry oxygen all around the body: Functionally, this step shouldn't be affected but with an increased oxygen-carrying capacity, the amount of oxygen transported will increase indirectly. This could lead to more oxygen being delivered to the tissues and cells throughout the body. 6. Oxygen diffuses into cells from capillaries: This final step will be indirectly impacted by the perturbation. The increased concentration of oxygen in the bloodstream results in a higher oxygen partial pressure in the blood. According to Fick's law of diffusion, this will increase the rate of diffusion from capillaries into cells, leading to more oxygen being available for cellular respiration. In conclusion, the supposed perturbation directly impacts the step of removing oxygen from the air in the lungs. This, in turn, indirectly impacts several other steps in the process of oxygen diffusion into cells from capillaries, ultimately leading to more oxygen being available for diffusion into the cells."},{"instruction":"Answer the following question: -  Solar radiation reaches Earth's atmosphere - Some is reflected back into space - The rest of the energy is absorbed by land and oceans, heating the Earth - Heat radiates from Earth to space - Some of this heat is trapped by greenhouse gases in the atmosphere - Human activities such as burning fuel are increasing the amount of greenhouses gases - This causes more heat radiation to stay trapped in our atmosphere  What might be the last step of the process?

Context: U.S. Defense Secretary Jim Mattis on Saturday slammed China's militarization of disputed South China Sea islands, insisting that weapons systems recently deployed in the area were meant to intimidate and coerce Beijing's neighbors. The comments came during a speech at the Shangri-La Dialogue, an annual Asian defense forum in Singapore. In the speech, Mattis laid out the broader U.S. strategy for a \\"free and open\\" Indo-Pacific region. \\"China's policy in the South China Sea stands in stark contrast to the openness our strategy promotes. It calls into question China's broader goals,\\" Mattis said. Specifically, the Pentagon chief mentioned China's deployment of anti-ship and surface-to-air missiles, electronic jammers, and the landing of a bomber aircraft at the Paracel Islands off the coast of Vietnam. \\"Despite China's claim to the contrary, the placement of these weapon systems is tied directly to military use for the purposes of intimidation and coercion,\\" Mattis added. Though much of the world is focused on an upcoming summit between North Korea and the United States, this year's Shangri-La Dialogue has focused primarily on the region's long-term future and how to deal with a more assertive China. Beijing has begun projecting power beyond its borders, most notably through the construction and militarization of islands in disputed areas of the South China Sea. China claims nearly the entire South China Sea, despite overlapping claims by countries including Vietnam, the Philippines, Brunei, Malaysia and Taiwan. Last week, the United States disinvited China from the Rim of the Pacific exercise (RIMPAC), a major international maritime exercise to be held later this year, citing Beijing's behavior in the South China Sea. Mattis on Saturday referred to that disinvitation as an \\"initial response\\" to China, but he did not outline any additional steps that might be taken. \\"The U.S. will continue to pursue a constructive, results-oriented relationship with China, cooperating when possible and competing vigorously where...

After cutting off the power, wiring a light is simple.","output":"Yes, we can draw the following conclusion: After cutting off the power, wiring a light becomes a simpler process. The main reason for cutting off the power is to ensure safety while working with electrical wiring. With the power off, we can follow the subsequent steps to wire a light without the risk of electrical shock. Here's a step-by-step guide to wiring a light after cutting off the power: 1. Gather the necessary tools and materials, such as a screwdriver, wire stripper, wire nuts, and the light fixture itself. 2. Identify the wires in the ceiling box. Typically, you will find a black or red wire (hot/live), a white wire (neutral), and a green or bare copper wire (ground). 3. Carefully strip the insulation from the ends of the wires, exposing about half an inch of the conductive core. 4. Follow the light fixture instructions to correctly attach the wires. Usually, this involves connecting the black or red wire from the ceiling box to the black or red wire from the light fixture (hot/live wires); the white wire from the ceiling box to the white wire from the light fixture (neutral wires); and the green or bare copper wire from the ceiling box to the green or bare copper wire from the light fixture (ground wires). 5. Use wire nuts to secure each connection, ensuring a strong and safe connection. 6. Gently fold the wires back into the ceiling box, taking care not to pinch them. 7. Attach the light fixture base to the ceiling box according to the manufacturer's instructions. 8. Install the light bulbs and any additional components, such as a cover or shade. 9. Turn the power back on at the junction box by switching the breaker so the fuse for the circuit supplying electricity to the fixture reads \\"on.\\" 10. Test the light switch to ensure the wiring is correct and the light functions as intended. By following these steps, the process of wiring a light becomes manageable and relatively simple once the power is off."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant. You will be given a task.

Write an article based on this summary: – In what Deadline calls a \\"shock ruling,\\" Midnight Rider director Randall Miller was set free Wednesday from a Georgia jail after serving only half of his plea-deal term for his role in the death of a 27-year-old camera assistant, the AP reports. The early release was due to prosecutors recently discovering that state law doesn't permit an inmate to serve more than one year at a state jail (as opposed to a prison), leading a judge to modify Miller's sentence from two years to one, Variety reports. The judge also took into account the fact that Miller's lawyers—who the Hollywood Reporter says tried to get him out twice before—and the DA's office had struck a \\"two-for-one\\" agreement of possible early release for good behavior before Miller entered his plea last year. Miller, who had pleaded guilty to criminal trespassing and involuntary manslaughter in the death of Sarah Jones, will continue his 10-year probation, which includes a mandate saying he can't direct a film or otherwise have any supervisory role overseeing safety in a film production. On Feb. 20, 2014, Jones was working on the set of the Gregg Allman biopic, filming a scene on train tracks in Wayne County, Ga., when she was struck by a train and killed, per the Reporter; eight others were injured, Variety notes. The movie production company had reportedly been denied access to the tracks and shot there anyway, leading to Miller becoming the first known filmmaker to be convicted and jailed for an on-set death. Jones' parents tell Variety they initially agreed to the plea deal placing Miller in jail instead of prison due to his health and say they never would have agreed to it if they had known he'd be released after one year. \\"We don't mean to inflict more pain to Mr. Miller's family,\\" Jones' father, Richard Jones, said in court Wednesday. \\"It's about making the film industry a better, safer place.\\" Others expressed their outrage more forcefully. \\"It's a complete miscarriage of justice and merely a slap on the wrist,\\" one of Jones' former colleagues tells the Reporter. \\"One year in jail is hardly accountability.\\"","output":"\\"Midnight Rider\\" Director Randall Miller's Shock Early Release: Examining the Controversy and Its Impact on Film Industry Safety In a surprising turn of events, \\"Midnight Rider\\" director Randall Miller was released from a Georgia jail on Wednesday, after serving only half of his plea-deal term for his role in the tragic death of 27-year-old camera assistant Sarah Jones on the film set in 2014. This unexpected early release has sent shockwaves through the film industry and has sparked intense debate on the need for increased safety measures and accountability in film production. Miller's early release was due to the recent discovery by prosecutors that Georgia state law does not allow an inmate to serve more than one year in a state jail, as opposed to a prison. This led to a judge modifying Miller's sentence from two years to one, as reported by Variety. The Hollywood Reporter also noted that the judge took into account a \\"two-for-one\\" agreement of possible early release for good behavior that Miller's lawyers had previously struck with the District Attorney's office before he entered his plea last year. The ramifications of Jones' tragic death and Miller's subsequent early release extend far beyond the individuals involved, with significant implications on the film industry at large. The events have brought critical attention to on-set safety and accountability, seeing as the production company had reportedly been denied access to the train tracks where Jones was killed, but proceeded to film there regardless. This disregard for safety ultimately led to Miller becoming the first known filmmaker to be convicted and jailed for an on-set death. Jones' parents, who initially agreed to the plea deal placing Miller in jail instead of prison due to his health, told Variety they would not have agreed to the deal had they known he'd be released after one year. In a statement, Jones' father, Richard Jones, expressed his hopes for the film industry to learn from this tragedy: \\"It's about making the film industry a better, safer place.\\" As the film community grapples with the fallout from this shocking ruling, various stakeholders are raising their voices in frustration and disappointment. One of Jones' former colleagues told the Reporter, \\"It's a complete miscarriage of justice and merely a slap on the wrist. One year in jail is hardly accountability.\\" Despite his early release, Miller is still subject to the conditions of his 10-year probation, which includes a mandate stating that he cannot direct a film or have any supervisory role overseeing safety in film production. In light of this controversial ruling, the broader film industry must now reflect on the importance of prioritizing safety on sets, learning from the tragic loss of Sarah Jones, and ensuring that such a tragedy never occurs again. As Richard Jones poignantly stated, the ultimate goal must be to make the film industry a better, safer place for all those involved. Success will be measured not just in the prevention of future on-set accidents, but also in the establishment of clear, well-enforced safety protocols that protect everyone working in film production. With safety at the forefront of the conversation, the industry will move forward with a greater sense of responsibility, learning from this heartbreaking incident and working to ensure on-set safety for every member of a production crew."},{"instruction":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

(CNN) -- Japan's prime minister conceded defeat in parliamentary elections Sunday, signaling the return to power of the Liberal Democratic Party and ending the brief rule of the disappointing upstart Democratic Party of Japan. Prime Minister Yoshihiko Noda pledged to step down as party president after exit polls showed a smashing loss in lower house voting. The party, once seen as a breath of fresh air in Japanese politics, came to be regarded as increasingly ineffective. \\"We got a regrettable result,\\" Noda said. \\"The result is everything in the politics. The biggest responsibility lies on me. I will quit as the partly leader of DPJ.\\" The move clears the way for the return to power of former Prime Minister Shinzo Abe, the current leader of the conservative-leaning Liberal Democratic Party, or LDP. \\"The Japanese people will be keenly looking whether the LDP can meet with their expectations,\\" Abe said in interviews after the polling. The LDP ruled the country almost continuously since its establishment in 1955 until it was forced from power three years ago by the DPJ. Public broadcaster NHK said the LDP and its coalition partner, the new Komei party, gained at least 302 seats in the 480-seat lower house. CNN's main affiliate, TV Asahi, reports the LDP/Komei coalition gained at least 312 seats. The official count is expected to be released Monday. The LDP is inheriting a struggling economy, regional tensions and questions over Japan's role in Asia. \\"The economy is at the bottom. It's our first mission to turn it around,\\" Abe said.  Question: \\"How did the Democratic Party of Japan eventually become to be regarded in Japan?\\" Answer: \\"Asahi Party\\" Is this answer to the question correct?","output":"No, the answer to the question \\"How did the Democratic Party of Japan eventually become to be regarded in Japan?\\" is not \\"Asahi Party.\\" The correct answer is that the Democratic Party of Japan (DPJ) came to be regarded as increasingly ineffective during their time in power. Many people in Japan were disappointed with their performance and were looking for a change, which eventually led to the Liberal Democratic Party returning to power."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Write an article based on this \\"You can set up a network between 2 PCs directly without access point  You have to use a crossover ethernet cable\\"","output":"Title: Setting Up a Direct Network Between Two PCs Without an Access Point: The Power of Crossover Ethernet Cables Introduction In today's interconnected world, setting up a network between computers is a common task among users wishing to share resources or connect to the internet. Typically, this involves using an access point, such as a router or a switch, to facilitate communication between the devices. However, many people are still unaware of the fact that it is possible to establish a direct network between two PCs without using an access point. One solution is by utilizing a crossover Ethernet cable. In this article, we will explore the benefits of setting up a direct network, how it works, and the step-by-step process for setting one up using a crossover Ethernet cable.  Why Set Up a Direct Network? There are several advantages to setting up a direct network between two computers: 1. Cost Savings: By skipping the need for additional hardware, such as routers and switches, users can save money on equipment. 2. Simplified Setup: A direct network is easier and faster to set up than a traditional network. 3. Direct Data Transfer: A direct connection allows for faster transfer of data between the two connected computers, as it bypasses the need for an intermediary device. 4. Increased Privacy: In a direct connection, there is no chance of third-party interference, making it a more secure way to transfer sensitive data. Understanding Crossover Ethernet Cables The key to creating a direct network between two PCs without an access point lies in the use of a crossover Ethernet cable. Unlike standard Ethernet cables, which have identical pin configurations on both ends, crossover cables have different pin configurations. This unique design allows two devices (such as PCs) to communicate directly with each other, without the need for an intermediary device. Setting Up a Direct Network using a Crossover Ethernet Cable Step 1: Obtain a Crossover Ethernet Cable To set up a direct network between two PCs, you will first need to purchase a crossover Ethernet cable. These cables are available at most electronics stores and online retailers. Make sure to choose a cable of appropriate length, depending on the distance between the two computers. Step 2: Connect the Crossover Ethernet Cable Connect one end of the crossover Ethernet cable into the Ethernet port on the first PC, and the other end into the Ethernet port on the second PC. Step 3: Configure the IP Addresses For the direct connection to work, you will need to assign static IP addresses for both PCs. To do this in Windows, follow these instructions: 1. Open the Control Panel and navigate to Network and Internet > Network and Sharing Center > Change adapter settings. 2. Right-click on the Ethernet connection and select \\"Properties.\\" 3. Select Internet Protocol Version 4 (TCP/IPv4) and click on \\"Properties.\\" 4. Choose \\"Use the following IP address\\" and enter an IP address for the first PC (for example, 192.168.0.1) with a subnet mask of 255.255.255.0. 5. Repeat this process for the second PC, choosing a slightly different IP address (e.g., 192.168.0.2). 6. Click \\"OK\\" to finish the configuration. Step 4: Test the Connection To verify whether the direct network has been set up successfully, try pinging the other PC. To do this, open the Command Prompt and type \\"ping\\" followed by the IP address of the other computer (e.g., \\"ping 192.168.0.2\\"). If the line says \\"Reply from...\\", it means the connection is successful. Conclusion Setting up a direct network between two PCs without an access point is not only possible but relatively simple with the help of a crossover Ethernet cable. This method offers a cost-effective, easy-to-implement solution for users who need a direct connection between computers to transfer data at high speeds and with increased privacy."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

In 1919 Father James Burns became president of Notre Dame, and in three years he produced an academic revolution that brought the school up to national standards by adopting the elective system and moving away from the university's traditional scholastic and classical emphasis. By contrast, the Jesuit colleges, bastions of academic conservatism, were reluctant to move to a system of electives. Their graduates were shut out of Harvard Law School for that reason. Notre Dame continued to grow over the years, adding more colleges, programs, and sports teams.

Gregory James \\"Greg\\" LeMond (born June 26, 1961) is an American former professional road racing cyclist who won the Road Race World Championship twice (1983 and 1989) and the Tour de France three times (1986, 1989 and 1990). He is also an entrepreneur and anti-doping advocate. LeMond was born in Lakewood, California, and raised in ranch country on the eastern slopes of the Sierra Nevada mountain range, near Reno. He is married and has three children with his wife Kathy, with whom he supports a variety of charitable causes and organizations. LeMond is a longtime vocal opponent of performance-enhancing drug use. He first spoke on-record against doping in cycling after winning the 1989 Tour de France. LeMond received intense criticism in 2001 when he publicly expressed doubts about the legitimacy of Lance Armstrong's Tour success after learning of his relationship with Dr. Michele Ferrari. His outspokenness placed him in the center of the anti-doping controversy.  LeMond has consistently questioned the relationship between riders and unethical sports doctors like Ferrari, and has pointed out that doping products ultimately victimize the professional cyclists who make use of them. Said LeMond: \\"When I speak out about doping people could translate it and think it was about the riders. Actually I feel like I am an advocate for the riders. I look at them as being treated like lab rats that are test vehicles for the doctors. The doctors, the management, the officials, they're the ones that have corrupted riders. The riders are the only ones that pay the price.\\"  LeMond's most notable conflicts have been with fellow Tour riders Lance Armstrong and Floyd Landis. He has also been critical of Alberto Contador, the UCI, and its former president, Pat McQuaid. In December 2012, LeMond claimed that a change needed to be made at the head of leadership for the UCI, and stated if called upon he would be willing to take the position himself if necessary to lead cycling out of the mire of doping. Said LeMond: \\"It is now or never to act. After the earthquake caused by the Armstrong case another chance will not arise. I am willing to invest to make this institution more democratic, transparent and look for the best candidate in the longer term.\\"  McQuaid rejected LeMond's call for new leadership and was dismissive of LeMond. Ultimately McQuaid was defeated in his bid for a third term by British Cycling president Brian Cookson at the September 2013 UCI Congress in Florence, Italy. Lemond had supported Cookson in the UCI Presidential battle.

Article: Getting enough vitamin C in your diet is key to getting all its benefits. Vitamin C supplements are measured in micrograms—see part one for the required amounts of vitamin C for different people. Many foods contain vitamin C, and consuming these can help you increase your vitamin C intake. Raw pineapple has 16mg of vitamin C, asparagus has 31 mg, raw broccoli has 89 mg, sun-dried tomatoes in oil have 101 mg, and raw parsley has 133 mg. Citrus is an especially good source of vitamin C. One cup of grapefruit, for instance, provides an entire day's worth of vitamin C, while a glass of orange juice is the equivalent of 165 percent of your daily vitamin C intake. Fresh squeezed orange juice or a physical orange is better for you than processed orange juice. What's more, the vitamin C in citrus will help curb stress by lowering stress hormone levels and possibly by reducing blood pressure, boost your energy by helping you to absorb iron better, and provide other essential phytonutrients that work in tandem with vitamin C, some of which aid memory. Check out the nutritional chart produced by your government's health department with respect to recommended daily intake of vitamin C. You'll be surprised how easy it is to vary your diet to include plenty of vitamin C sources. In the United States, the National Institutes of health have some recommendations. Vitamin C does not last in storage, so it is steadily lost the longer it is stored.  As such, be prepared to eat your food as fresh as possible rather than leaving it to linger in the refrigerator or pantry. For example, leaving your broccoli in the fridge and then boiling it will reduce the vitamin C content considerably, compared to freshly picking the broccoli and steaming it that same day.  It's good to grow your own vegetables if possible, even if you just grow broccoli on a balcony or potatoes in a bag or barrel.  Wash fresh fruits and vegetables and then allow them to dry. Store them in an airtight container in the refrigerator and eat them within a few days. Do not soak them or store them in water because the vitamin C dissolves out of the plant into the water. Vitamin C also leaches out in cooking water. Fresh food is the best source of vitamin C and most fruit and vegetables contain vitamin C. In particular, aim to eat food from the cabbage family, red and green peppers, potatoes, blackcurrants, strawberries, citrus fruit, and tomatoes. This includes broccoli, cabbage, Brussels sprouts and collard greens. Eat the vegetables raw or steam them, using only a small amount of water to maximize the amount of vitamins the vegetables retain. Have a salad with spinach leaves instead of lettuce. Spinach is a better source of vitamin C when eaten raw. Toss in green and red bell peppers and tomatoes for added vitamin C. Vegetables lose micronutrients when cooked. Potatoes are also a good source of vitamin C. In spite of what you may have heard, the skin does not have the highest concentration of vitamin C, but its fiber is good for you. When having a baked potato, be sure to also eat the skin. Juice is calorie dense and you lack the roughage and other benefits of eating the fruit when consuming it as juice. However, you can enjoy juice as a means of increasing your vitamin C intake by doing the following: Juice with pulp is better for you than juice without it because vitamin C is better absorbed if it is consumed in the presence of bioflavonoids, which are found mostly in fruit pulp. Make fresh squeezed orange juice or purchase frozen concentrate instead of premixed, ready-to-drink refrigerated cartons. Frozen concentrates have significantly more vitamin C in them because the pasteurization process destroys some of the vitamin C in premixed juices. Make your own vitamin C booster by making rosehip syrup. As an added bonus, this syrup is one that children will like. What is a summary of what this article is about?","output":"This article emphasizes the importance of getting enough vitamin C in one's diet and highlights various food sources rich in vitamin C. It recommends consuming fresh, raw fruits and vegetables, such as citrus fruits, pineapple, asparagus, broccoli, parsley, and members of the cabbage family. The article also suggests growing one's own vegetables, proper storage techniques, and consuming juices with pulp to maximize vitamin C intake.

The number of candies in each group is: k = -5184 / -162 When we divide two sour candies (- signs) together, we get a sweet candy (+ sign).

Given these facts, sperm had to swim from what to what reproductive organs for zygotes to occur. among the following options: - barnacles  - male to female  - animals  - ocean water  - male to male  - mouth of rivers  - female to male  - female to female Answer:","output":"In order for fertilization to occur and zygotes to form, sperm must swim from the male reproductive organs to the female reproductive organs. This process is essential for sexual reproduction in animals, including humans. In the context of the provided options, sperm must swim from \\"male to female\\" reproductive organs to achieve fertilization and eventually form zygotes. Here is a detailed explanation of the process: 1. Sperm production: The process begins with the production of sperm cells in the male reproductive organs, specifically within the testes. The sperm cells undergo maturation and are stored in the epididymis, where they become motile and capable of fertilizing an egg. 2. Ejaculation: During sexual intercourse, sperm cells are released from the male reproductive system through ejaculation. The sperm cells are mixed with seminal fluid produced by the accessory glands, forming semen. The semen functions as a vehicle for the sperm, providing nutrients and protection as they travel through the female reproductive system. 3. Sperm meets egg: To reach the female reproductive organs, sperm must swim through the vagina and then ascend the cervical canal into the uterus. From the uterus, the sperm must navigate through the fallopian tube(s) in search of the mature egg released from the ovary during ovulation. Only a small fraction of the ejaculated sperm will successfully navigate this intricate path. 4. Fertilization: Once a sperm cell encounters an egg, it must penetrate the outer layers of the egg and fuse with it, thereby releasing its genetic material into the egg. This fusion is called fertilization, and it results in the formation of a single-celled zygote. 5. Zygote formation and development: After fertilization, the new zygote begins its development process, starting with cell division. As the cells continue to divide and specialize, the zygote transforms into a blastocyst and then an embryo. If implantation into the uterus lining is successful, it will grow into a fetus and eventually a fully formed offspring. In summary, for zygotes to form, sperm must successfully swim from the male reproductive organs to the female reproductive organs, where fertilization of an egg can occur. This essential process forms the basis of sexual reproduction in animals."},{"instruction":"Generate a question that has the following answer:  The Duke and his crew  for the following movie plot:  A simple group of commercial flyers, post WWII, one plane is downed in uncharted Canadian tundra, dead of winter, wicked cold.

Summarize: Not content with filling stadiums around the world, and selling more than 100 million records, the face-painted, fire-breathing US hard rockers also have their own navy. Every autumn Kiss hire a huge cruise liner to sail around the Caribbean for a week with 2,300 of their diehard fans. This year will be their sixth voyage, or Kiss Kruise VI. The band perform two shows on the ship, and fans get to meet and hang out with the four band members. There are 13 bars on board, plus 12 restaurants, a swimming pool, a gym, a spa, a casino, an indoor theatre and a tattoo parlour for getting a new Kiss ink work. Members of the so-called Kiss Navy fly into Miami from around the world to attend, and Kiss vocalist and bass guitarist Gene Simmons says the cruise is one of the highlights of his annual calendar. \\"It's rock and roll all night and party every day,\\" he says. \\"Anyone who has ever been on one of our cruises comes back raving to their friends. \\"Imagine 2,300 crazy friends, swimming, shopping, gaming and visiting exotic ports of call with us.\\" While Kiss might not be to everyone's taste, the rock group has helped to transform the once staid world of cruise lines. Whereas cruises were traditionally the preserve of elderly holidaymakers, over the past decade - and especially in the past five years - there has been an exponential growth in the number of \\"themed cruises\\" - cruises aimed at people with a specific interest. This has opened up the world of cruising to a much younger demographic, and given the cruise industry hundreds of millions of dollars in additional earnings. From music cruises - at which Kiss are leading the way - to cruises for people with specific political views, or cruises for poker players, or fans of Italian food, there is a ship sailing for pretty much everyone. For example, if you are passionate about your constitutional right to bear arms, you might be tempted to join the Freedom Alliance and National Rifle Association's cruise down the River Danube in June. Guest speakers include US Republican politician - and former speaker of the US House of Representatives - Newt Gingrich. Or if you are transgender, Transgender Vacations organises cruises around the Caribbean. Disney holds regular sailings for fans of the Star Wars movies, where you can dress up as a stormtrooper or ewok and meet some of the actors. Howard Moses, founder and president of the Cruise & Vacation Authority, says that more than 700 themed cruises now set sail around the world each year, compared with less than 30 a decade ago. \\"Themed cruises are absolutely by far the biggest growth area in the industry,\\" says Mr Moses, whose organisation is based in the US state of Georgia. \\"It has enabled the cruise industry to reach beyond people who are our traditional customers, to people who are passionate about a certain subject. \\"For music cruises, there can be a very young crowd. \\"And for the political cruises we joke that the attendees are often people who said they would never go on a cruise, yet they have the time of their lives, and are the first to lead the conga line.\\" At Atlanta-based Sixthman, the world's largest organiser of music cruises, its communications manager Alaidriale Derway says the business has just wrapped up its busiest ever spring sailing season, with 10 back-to-back cruises. Sixthman now has more than 500 acts on its books, including Kiss. Other acts for whom it organises cruises include Weezer, Paramore, Lynyrd Skynyrd and Kid Rock. The company charters the ships and helps to organise support acts. Ms Derway says: \\"More and more artists want to get involved. \\"Cruises are a great way for artists to interact with their fans in a much more intimate environment, and collaborate with each other. \\"In terms of the cost for a fan, they pay a set fee, and then pretty much everything is free except for alcohol and soda. All the food is included unless someone wants to pay for more speciality dining.\\" She adds: \\"Lots of people really hesitate to do the whole cruise thing, there is still a bit of a stigma attached, but you can really connect with people who are passionate about the same things as you are.\\" While the music cruise industry is very much based in the US, themed cruises are also a growing phenomenon on the other side of the Atlantic. Mike Bugsgang, chief executive of the UK-based Association of Group Travel Organisers, says there has been a big rise in the number of cruises that include visits to locations that have featured in well-known movies. One such cruise organised by Fred Olsen Cruise Lines is called \\"UK Scenes from the Silver Screen\\". Sailing around the UK and Ireland, the itinerary includes trips to settings from TV series Game of Thrones and the Harry Potter movies. Back in the US, Kiss' Gene Simmons doesn't just have to prepare for performing live on the Kiss Kruise, he also has to brush up on his wedding officiating. An on-board extra for Kiss' hard-partying fans is the chance to splice more than just the mainbrace. They can tie the marital knot, with Mr Simmons or a fellow band member performing the service. But one thing a Kiss Kruise is not is restful. As Mr Simmons admits: \\"It's tough to get to sleep on the cruises... it is fair to say, both the band and the fans are completely exhausted once we leave the cruise.\\"","output":"Themed cruises, aimed at passengers with specific interests, are experiencing exponential growth and transforming the cruise line industry. Hard rock band, Kiss, are pioneers of the movement, and have helped open up the world of cruising to a younger demographic. More than 700 themed cruises now set sail annually around the world, compared with fewer than 30 a decade ago.

Article: Owls  are some of the world's greatest hunters. From head to feet, owls' bodies are built to hunt. Scientists are studying all the things that make owls such great hunters. Most owls hunt at night. The birds have excellent hearing, which helps them find their next meal in the dark. Owls have one ear that is larger and set higher than the other. When an owl hears a sound, it listens closely. Is the sound lounder in its right ear or left ear? Does the upper or lower ear detect the sound first? The information helps the owl find the location of its prey without ever seeing it. Owls don't depend just on their hearing to hunt. After a sound draws an owl's attention, it zeroes in with sight. Many birds have eyes on either side of their heads. But an owl's eyes face forward, like a person's. Images from each eye combine to form a 3-D picture, similar to how we see. That helps owls better judge a prey's size, distance, and speed. An owl's eyes are so large that they can gather lots of light. That helps the owl see better when hunting at night. An owl's eyes are also fixed in their sockets . It can't roll them like we can. Instead, an owl keeps prey in its sight by turning its head. Owls can move their beads nearly upside down and turn them 270 degrees around. Their necks have 14 vertebrae . That's twice as many neck bones as a person has. The blood vessels  thread through holes in an owl's vertebrae. The researchers found that these holes are very large so that the extra space provides an air cushion that protects the vessels. Detecting prey is only the first step for owls. Next they must catch their meals. An owl can fly inches over your head and you can't hear anything. The secret to owls' silent flight is their feathers. Fine \\"hairs\\" cover the surface of an owl's wing feathers. And the feathers' edges have soft barbs . Together, they make the sound of air rushing over the owl's wings quieter and less clear. Question: The shortcoming of an owl's fixed eyes can be made up by its  _  . Options: A: large head B: strong legs C: body size D: flexible neck A:","output":"The shortcoming of an owl's fixed eyes can be made up by its flexible neck. This is because owls have the ability to turn their heads nearly upside down and rotate them 270 degrees around, thanks to their 14 vertebrae in their necks. This flexibility allows them to easily keep their prey in sight without needing to move their eyes. So, the correct answer is D: flexible neck."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Here is a question about this article: By the late 2000s, Dell's \\"configure to order\\" approach of manufacturing—delivering individual PCs configured to customer specifications from its US facilities was no longer as efficient or competitive with high-volume Asian contract manufacturers as PCs became powerful low-cost commodities. Dell closed plants that produced desktop computers for the North American market, including the Mort Topfer Manufacturing Center in Austin, Texas (original location) and Lebanon, Tennessee (opened in 1999) in 2008 and early 2009, respectively. The desktop production plant in Winston-Salem, North Carolina, received US280 million in incentives from the state and opened in 2005, but ceased operations in November 2010. Dell's contract with the state required them to repay the incentives for failing to meet the conditions, and they sold the North Carolina plant to Herbalife. Most of the work that used to take place in Dell's U.S. plants was transferred to contract manufacturers in Asia and Mexico, or some of Dell's own factories overseas. The Miami, Florida, facility of its Alienware subsidiary remains in operation, while Dell continues to produce its servers (its most profitable products) in Austin, Texas.

Kennedy, the 35th President of the United States, was born and raised in the Boston suburb of Brookline, Massachusetts. Born into a prominent and wealthy family on May 29, 1917, John Fitzgerald Kennedy was the second of Joseph P. Kennedy Sr. and Rose Fitzgerald Kennedy's nine children.  Joseph Kennedy, his father, was a well-known businessman and political figure, while his mother, Rose, was a socialite and philanthropist. Together, they created a nurturing environment that supported their children's education and development in various aspects of life. The Kennedy family, famous for their political and public service contributions, played an important role in shaping young John's interests and ambitions. Growing up in Brookline, Kennedy attended the Edward Devotion School and the Noble and Greenough Lower School, both located in the local area. The family lived in a Georgian-style mansion at 83 Beals Street from 1917 to 1920, and this house is now a National Historic Site known as the John Fitzgerald Kennedy National Historic Site. In 1927, when Kennedy was 10 years old, the family moved to a larger estate in the more affluent suburb of Riverdale in Bronx, New York. In New York, Kennedy briefly attended the private Riverdale Country School before transferring to the Catholic boys' school, Canterbury School, located in New Milford, Connecticut. After completing eighth grade there, Kennedy was sent to the prestigious Choate Rosemary Hall, a boarding school in Wallingford, Connecticut, where he spent his high school years. While studying at Choate, Kennedy developed his interests in politics, history, and leadership and also faced some health challenges, including a diagnosis of the autoimmune disorder called Addison's disease. Upon graduation, Kennedy went on to attend three different higher education institutions, due to several reasons, including health and academics. These institutions were the London School of Economics, Princeton University, and eventually, Harvard University. It was at Harvard that he completed his undergraduate degree in international affairs and wrote his senior thesis, “Appeasement at Munich,” which later became the best-selling book “Why England Slept.” In addition to his academic pursuits, Kennedy's upbringing included a focus on physical fitness, athletic competitions, and outdoor activities like sailing and swimming. Spending summers at the large family estate in Hyannis Port, Massachusetts, he and his siblings were encouraged to be highly competitive and to develop strong interpersonal skills. These experiences undoubtedly helped shape the resilient, charismatic leader that John F. Kennedy eventually became. In conclusion, while John F. Kennedy's upbringing took place across several locations within the United States and beyond, it was in Brookline, Massachusetts, where he spent his earliest years, and the Boston area remained an integral part of his life and personal identity."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Departures (Japanese: okuribito, Hepburn: Okuribito, \\"one who sends off\\") is a 2008 Japanese drama film directed by Yojiro Takita and starring Masahiro Motoki, Ryoko Hirosue, and Tsutomu Yamazaki. Loosely based on Coffinman, a memoir by Shinmon Aoki, the film follows a young man who returns to his hometown after a failed career as a cellist and stumbles across work as a nokanshi--a traditional Japanese ritual mortician. He is subjected to prejudice from those around him, including from his wife, because of strong social taboos against people who deal with death. Eventually he earns their respect and learns the importance of interpersonal connections through the beauty and dignity of his work. Japanese funerals are highly ritualized affairs which are generally--though not always--conducted in accordance with Buddhist rites. In preparation for the funeral, the body is washed and the orifices are blocked with cotton or gauze. The encoffining ritual (called nokan), as depicted in Departures, is rarely performed, and even then only in rural areas. This ceremony is not standardized, but generally involves professional morticians (Na Guan Shi , nokanshi) ritually preparing the body, dressing the dead in white, and sometimes applying make-up. The body is then put on dry ice in a casket, along with personal possessions and items necessary for the trip to the afterlife.  Despite the importance of death rituals, in traditional Japanese culture the subject is considered unclean as everything related to death is thought to be a source of kegare (defilement). After coming into contact with the dead, individuals must cleanse themselves through purifying rituals. People who work closely with the dead, such as morticians, are thus considered unclean, and during the feudal era those whose work was related to death became burakumin (untouchables), forced to live in their own hamlets and discriminated against by wider society. Despite a cultural shift since the Meiji Restoration of 1868, the stigma of death still has considerable force within Japanese society, and discrimination against the untouchables has continued.  Until 1972, most deaths were dealt with by families, funeral homes, or nokanshi. As of 2014, about 80% of deaths occur in hospitals, and preparation of the bodies is frequently done by hospital staff; in such cases, the family often does not see the body until the funeral. A 1998 survey found that 29.5% of the Japanese population believed in an afterlife, and a further 40% wanted to believe; belief was highest among the young. Belief in the existence of a soul (54%) and a connection between the worlds of the living and the dead (64.9%) was likewise common. Answer the following question by taking a quote from the article: what is the cultural background?","output":"The cultural background of \\"Departures\\" is deeply rooted in traditional Japanese culture, where death and everything related to it is considered unclean or a source of kegare (defilement). This is evident in the fact that people who work closely with the dead, such as morticians, are often subjected to prejudice and discrimination.

It occurred in about September 1848 at Avenue Range, a sheep station in the southeast of the Colony of South Australia. Information is scarce about the basic facts of the massacre, including the exact date and number of victims. A contemporary account of the massacre listed nine victims – three women, two teenage girls, three infants, and an \\"old man blind and infirm\\". Another account published by Christina Smith in 1880 gave the number of victims as eleven, and specified that they belonged to the Tanganekald people. Pastoralist James Brown and his overseer, a man named Eastwood, were suspected of committing the murders in retaliation for attacks on Brown's sheep. In January 1849, reports of the massacre reached Matthew Moorhouse, the Protector of Aborigines. He visited the district to investigate the claims, and based on his enquiries Brown was charged with the murders in March 1849. Proceedings against Brown began in June 1849 and continued in the Supreme Court of South Australia for several months, but were eventually abandoned. Some key witnesses, including Eastwood, either fled the colony or refused to cooperate with the investigation. There were also significant restrictions on the use of evidence given by Aboriginal witnesses, especially where a verdict could involve capital punishment. These legal hurdles and settler solidarity ensured the case did not go to trial, although the magistrate who committed him for trial told a friend that there was \\"little question of the butchery or the butcher\\". Although the details of the case were known for decades after the murders, distortions of the massacre eventually appeared in print and were embellished by local white and Aboriginal historians. Two key aspects of these later accounts were that Brown poisoned rather than shot the victims, and that he had undertaken an epic horse ride to Adelaide to establish an alibi...., what would be the answer ? The answer is:","output":"The full names of the two people who were suspected of committing the murders in the Avenue Range Station massacre are James Brown and his overseer, Eastwood. They were suspected of committing the murders in retaliation for attacks on Brown's sheep."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant that follows instruction extremely well. Help as much as you can.

Article:","output":"**Impersonators Cause a Stir at Winter Olympics Opening Ceremony** As the world turned its gaze towards the Winter Olympics opening ceremony in Pyeongchang last Friday, a peculiar sight caught the attention of the audience and media alike. President Donald Trump and North Korean leader Kim Jong Un seemed to be in attendance. In reality, they were professional impersonators who sparked a commotion in the stands and were promptly escorted out by security. \\"We wanted to surprise everyone and bring world peace and then we’re being escorted out by security guards, which I think is really unfair,” said the Kim Jong Un impersonator, later identified as Howard. “Doesn’t everyone want peace?” The pair was mobbed by reporters, seeking reactions and insights into their unexpected presence. As commented humorously by the Los Angeles Times, this scrum of reporters proved that \\"reporters in other countries chase stupid stories, too.\\" Howard and his counterpart, Trump impersonator Dennis Alan, kept up their charade while interacting with the press. In character as Kim Jong Un, Howard claimed that he and the fake Trump were \\"getting along great\\" and expressed his belief that their real-life counterparts would feel the same if they ever meet. \\"Because in my opinion, they're pretty much the same person,\\" he stated. He even joked about their respective nuclear buttons, saying, “Both of our buttons are very big. We both agree on that, so there’s going to be peace.” Though briefly detained by security, the impersonators were allowed back to their seats after they proved they had legitimately purchased tickets for the ceremony. \\"We paid good money for it. We’re not thieves, you know. I can afford it. We’re rich,\\" said Howard, still portraying the North Korean leader. While their stunt might have been a lighthearted attempt to bring levity and promote peace, it highlighted the stark absence of official interaction between the US and North Korean delegations at the Olympic Games. Despite the ongoing tensions between North Korea and the US, the Olympics provided an opportunity for diplomacy and dialogue between North and South Korea, which marched together under one unified flag during the opening ceremony.   It remains to be seen if the goodwill and cooperation displayed at the Winter Olympics will translate into lasting progress in inter-Korean relations, or if the impersonators’ momentary unity will be the only semblance of peace we will witness during these tumultuous times. Regardless, the memorable appearance of Howard and Dennis Alan at the opening ceremony has reminded the world of the importance of striving for peace and unity, even in the face of overwhelming opposition."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

I remember when I was a child my father always got up very early, quietly putting on his clothes and going off to work. To arrive in time to open his tiny store at 8:30, he needed to leave our apartment at 6:30. After all, he had to take a bus and then the subway. The last journey was a long walk through a neighborhood much of which was full of the smell of rubbish. I learned: it is very important to work. No excuse. When I was 12, I would, on some Saturdays, go to my father's store to help out. After helping set up the outside clothing display, for the rest of the day, I'd watch to make sure no one stole anything. When I noticed someone looking unusual or strange, I would look the person in the eye, smile and say, \\"May I help you?\\" Usually that worked, but sometimes, someone would run off with something. The first time, I ran after the thief but my father shouted, \\"Martin, stop! There is no need to do that.\\" It's true that safety is more important than money. After 10 years of hard work, he saved up enough money to buy his first car, a cheap one--he wouldn't buy one until he could afford to pay for it without borrowing money.

Middle school friends Frank Navetta and Dave Nolte start the band in 1977 by writing songs together on guitar. Classmate Bill Stevenson impresses them with his musical talents and becomes their drummer. In 1979 they meet bassist Tony Lombardo in Long Beach and recruit him to the band. Nolte bows out to join his brothers in The Last, and Navetta, Stevenson, and Lombardo record the Descendents' debut single. Stevenson's high school classmate Milo Aukerman joins the band as lead singer, and the new lineup builds a local following through their catchy and melodic songs, energetic live shows, and Aukerman's image as a nerd. They release the Fat EP (1981) and their debut album Milo Goes to College (1982), so named because Aukerman leaves the band to study biology. Stevenson drums in Black Flag for the next few years. In 1985 the Descendents reconvene for a second album, I Don't Want to Grow Up. Navetta has burned all of his equipment and moved to Oregon, and is replaced by Ray Cooper. Stevenson pushes for the band to tour, but Lombardo declines and quits. He is replaced by Doug Carrion, and this lineup records 1986's Enjoy!, after which Cooper and Carrion both leave the band.

This is sometimes referred to as “checking labs,” “doing bloodwork,” or even “checking blood.” Most older adults have been through this. For instance, it’s pretty much impossible to be hospitalized without having bloodwork done, and it’s part of most emergency room care. Such testing is also often done as part of an annual exam, or “complete physical.” Last but not least, blood testing is usually — although not always — very helpful when it comes to evaluating many common complaints that affect aging adults. Fatigued and experiencing low energy? We should perhaps check for anemia and thyroid problems, among other things. Confused and delirious? Bloodwork can help us check on an older person’s electrolytes (they can be thrown off by a medication side-effect, as well as by other causes). Blood tests can also provide us with information related to infection, kidney function, and much more. Like much of medical care, blood testing is probably overused. But often, it’s an appropriate and an important part of evaluating an older person’s health care concerns. So as a geriatrician, I routinely order or recommend blood tests for older adults. Historically, laboratory results were reviewed by the doctors and were only minimally discussed with patients and families. But today, it’s becoming more common for patients to ask questions about their results, and otherwise become more knowledgeable about this aspect of their health. In fact, one of my top recommendations to older adults and family caregivers is to always request a copy of your laboratory results. (And then, keep it in your personal health record!) This way, if you ever have questions about your health, or need to see a different doctor, you’ll be able to quickly access this useful information about yourself. In this article, I’m going to list and briefly explain the blood tests that are most commonly used, for the primary medical care of older...

Premise: \\"Los Angeles's closest mountain retreats are Big Bear Lake and Lake Arrowhead, which lie east of the city less than two hours away.\\" The premise states two key pieces of information:  1. Big Bear Lake and Lake Arrowhead are the closest mountain retreats to Los Angeles.  2. These retreats are less than two hours away from the city and are located east of it. Hypothesis: \\"Big Bear Lake and Lake Arrowhead are the closest mountain resort near Los Angeles.\\" This hypothesis suggests that Big Bear Lake and Lake Arrowhead are the closest mountain resorts to Los Angeles, which aligns with the first piece of information mentioned in the premise. Therefore, the hypothesis seems to be directly related to the information provided in the premise. Now, to analyze if the hypothesis is entailed by the premise, we need to determine if there is any discrepancy, contradiction, or missing information between the two statements. Upon close inspection, both the premise and the hypothesis convey the same core idea – that Big Bear Lake and Lake Arrowhead are the closest mountain retreats/resorts to Los Angeles. There is no contradiction or information gap between the two statements. The only difference is in the wording used, wherein the premise uses \\"retreats\\" and the hypothesis prioritizes \\"resort.\\" However, it becomes apparent from the context that these terms are being used interchangeably and refer to the same locations – Big Bear Lake and Lake Arrowhead. In conclusion, the hypothesis is entailed by the premise, as it is directly supported by the information provided and maintains the same core idea about the proximity of these mountain retreats/resorts to Los Angeles. This assertion remains consistent between the premise and the hypothesis, and there is no discernible discrepancy, contradiction, or missing information."},{"instruction":"Choose from: 1). No. 2).

This belief was central to his political philosophy, as evident in his famous work, \\"The Republic.\\" Plato's arguments on the ideal government began as a response to the political turmoil and moral decline of Athenian society during his lifetime. He sought to establish a government that would be ethical, wise, and just. Plato argued that a well-ordered, harmonious society could only be achieved if it were governed by individuals who had a deep understanding of abstract concepts like justice, goodness, and beauty. He believed that only philosophers possessed the necessary intellectual capacity and moral disposition to attain such an understanding. In \\"The Republic,\\" Plato introduces the idea of the Philosopher-King, ruling over his imagined utopian society called Kallipolis. He asserts that in order to create a just society, the rulers must be philosophers, as they possess knowledge of the Forms (ideal essences of things). Philosophers, in Plato's view, are those who love wisdom and have a desire for truth. They have the ability to see the \\"big picture,\\" which is crucial for enabling them to make moral, ethical, and rational decisions for the common good. According to Plato, philosopher-kings would be able to create and maintain a just society because they are guided by wisdom and rationality, rather than by personal or financial interests. They value knowledge and understand the true nature of reality, allowing them to make better-informed decisions that benefit the entire community. Furthermore, since philosopher-kings have no personal desires or motives, they would be less likely to become corrupt. Plato’s concept of the philosopher-king revolves around his Theory of Forms, which includes the notion that reality consists of two realms: the visible world of particulars, which we perceive with our senses, and the unchanging, eternal world of the Forms. It is the knowledge of the Forms that philosophers possess and the ordinary people lack. In the education system of Kallipolis, potential philosopher-kings would undergo a rigorous and extensive educational program, which would involve both intellectual and physical training. This program would ultimately serve to develop the philosopher's mind and character. Notably, the educational curriculum included subjects like mathematics, astronomy, dialectics, and physical education. After completing their education, the philosopher-kings would apply their acquired wisdom and leadership skills to govern society fairly and effectively. Although Plato's idea of philosophers running the government has been influential in the history of political thought, it has also been criticized. Critics argue that it is impractical and elitist, as it assumes that philosophers would be somehow immune to corruption and that their rule would be inherently superior. Additionally, there are concerns regarding the lack of representation and democratic values in such a system. In conclusion, it was Plato who believed that only philosophers should run the government, as they possessed the wisdom, intellectual capacity, and moral disposition required for effective and just governance. His ideal government, as portrayed in \\"The Republic,\\" is centered around the philosopher-king who would cultivate a harmonious and morally upright society, free from the instability and failings of its contemporaneous reality."},{"instruction":"I'm taking a test and have to guess the right answer to the question after the article.

As a legal services attorney, Barnes will help women escape domestic violence, Mauricio Vivero is vice president seniors fight predatory lending scams and parents obtain child support for their kids. of Legal In doing so, he will take his place on the front line of the U.S. legal community's Services Corporation, the uphill and underpublicized struggle to achieve equal access to justice for millions of Washington-Americans too poor to afford legal representation. based nonprofit corporation chartered by The inaccessibility of the U.S. civil justice system is hardly a new development, but it Congress in took Barnes' decision to put the national media spotlight on our country's ongoing 1974 to promote equal access to access-to-justice crisis. civil justice. The 2000 U.S. census reports that more than 43 million Americans qualify for free federally funded legal assistance, yet fewer than 20 percent of eligible clients (annual income: 11,075 or less) are able to obtain legal help when they need it, according to the American Bar Association. In Georgia, there is just one legal aid lawyer for every 10,500 eligible poor people. Barnes understood this problem long before he became governor. While in private practice, he handled many pro-bono cases and was a frequent volunteer in the Cobb County office of the federally funded Atlanta Legal Aid Society. Most memorably, he secured a 115 million judgment in 1993 against Fleet Finance for victimizing 18,000 homeowners -- many of them senior citizens -- with its widespread predatory lending mortgage practices. His long-standing commitment to the underserved is certainly admirable, but it should not be viewed as a rare and laudable act of civic virtue. To be admitted to practice law, every attorney must take a professional oath to promote justice -- and every state's ethical rules include language indicating lawyers' responsibility to be guardians of fair play for those living in poverty. In Georgia, many law firms, corporations and private attorneys are working pro bono to serve the neediest clients. Yet only 23 percent of the state's 23,598 active lawyers reported meeting the Georgia State Bar's goal of 50 hours of pro-bono service in 2002. The need for volunteers is most severe outside the five-county Atlanta metropolitan area, where 70 percent of the state's poor people are served by only 24 percent of the state's lawyers. National pro-bono participation is even worse. Only 23 percent of the roughly 1 million attorneys in America volunteer even one hour of pro-bono service annually, according to the ABA.

Dreams are like stars .. you may never touch them but if you follow them they will lead you to your destiny. ||||| The four-minute video in Korean and English was credited to Destiny Pictures, but owner of firm with same name said he had ‘no involvement’      The National Security Council has said that it made the video Donald Trump showed to Kim Jong-un at their Singapore summit on Tuesday in an unorthodox effort to persuade him of the benefits of denuclearisation.      The four-minute video in Korean and English was made in the style of an extended action movie trailer and portrayed Kim and Trump as men of destiny with the future of the world in their hands.      The video, which Trump showed to the press after playing it on an iPad for Kim, is credited to “Destiny Pictures Productions”, prompting a flurry of press inquiries to a film production company of that name in California.      'The bromance of the century': Trump's bizarre trailer for his summit with Kim | Peter Bradshaw Read more      Mark Castaldo, the company’s founder, said in an email it had “no involvement in the video”.      “Woke up to 100’s of e-mails and calls from all over the world. Crazy” Castaldo said in a tweet, adding that he was trying to find out “why they used my company name”.      Garrett Marquis, an NSC spokesman said in a statement: “The video was created by the National Security Council to help the president demonstrate the benefits of complete denuclearization, and a vision of a peaceful and prosperous Korean peninsula.”      When asked about the decision to present the video as made by a non-existent company, an NSC spokesman said there would be no further comment.      “From my understanding, they were just using ‘Destiny Pictures’ as a play on words. It just so happens there’s a studio by that name in California,” said Ned Price, a former NSC spokesman.      “Leave it to this White House to fail to conduct basic due diligence. And that, of course, leaves aside the fact they thought it prudent to try to out-North-Korea North Korea in the propaganda department.      “The whole enterprise reeks of amateurism and comes off as an attempt to check the box on a harebrained idea that presumably originated in the oval office,” Price added.      The video shows the possibilities of North Korea’s future if it renounces nuclear weapons, with a rapid succession of colourful images of advanced technology and happy people. It contrasted that with an alternative reality in which the regime stayed on course with the development of its arsenal. That future was shown in grainy black and white images of US warplanes in the air and missiles launching.      The choice between the two scenarios was Kim’s, the film implied.      “A story about a special moment in time. When a man is presented with one chance that may never be repeated,” the narrator says.      When asked about the film at a press conference on Tuesday, Trump defended it as a masterstroke which he had sprung on Kim and his entourage.      “We had it made up,” the president said. “I showed it to them today. Actually during the meeting. Toward the end of the meeting. I think he loved it.      “We had it on cassette. An iPad,” Trump said. “They played it. About eight of their representatives were watching it. I thought they were fascinated by it. I thought it was well done. I showed it to you because that is the future.” ||||| White House      Just when you thought things couldn’t get any weirder, President Donald Trump today released a video about the future of U.S.-Korean relations that looks like a cross between a Michael Bay movie and a corporate infomercial.      “It is cod spiritual gibberish,” wrote a columnist with the British newspaper, The Spectator, “But clearly, in some peculiar way, it works.”      As cheesy as the video is, it’s precisely the vision of a high-energy planet that poor nations generally, and North Korea particularly, need right now.      The video draws a striking contrast between the current, low-energy North Korea, and a future high-energy one.      For decades, anti-nuclear environmentalists have insisted that there aren’t enough resources for all humans to live prosperous lives, while pro-nuclear environmentalists have pointed out that nuclear power allows for universal prosperity and a shrinking of humankind’s environmental footprint.      Trump’s video clearly embraces the high-energy vision, even referencing population challenges. “Seven billion people inhabit planet Earth,” says the narrator over scenes of population-dense cities.      The video presents a positive vision of all the things nuclear energy can power: an abundant grocery store; speedboats; incubators for babies; skyscrapers along a beach; robots in factories; and people being scanned inside of MRIs. ||||| “And I explained, I said, ‘You know, instead of doing that, you could have the best hotels in the world right there.’ Think of it from a real estate perspective.”      Mark McKinnon, a seasoned political ad maker who ran media for President George W. Bush’s campaigns, said the video was “obviously quite shlocky” for a broader audience, but could be effective in influencing its intended target.      “At bottom, it’s very good storytelling — something obviously Trump understands,” Mr. McKinnon said. Citing the former governor of Texas ousted by Mr. Bush, he added: “Ann Richards used to say, ‘Dumb it down so my mama can understand it.’ Or you know, so a foreign dictator can. Over all, a pretty creative and clever move.”      But veteran diplomats and foreign policy scholars were warier. “I was speechless when I first saw it,” said Alexander R. Vershbow, who served as ambassador to South Korea under Mr. Bush. “Pure Trump with Hollywood production values, showing what Kim Jong-un and North Korea would be like if they make the fateful choice to trade in their nukes for economic prosperity.”      Sung-Yoon Lee, a Korean studies professor at Tufts University’s Fletcher School of Law and Diplomacy, was even less impressed, calling it “eerily reminiscent of second-rate South Korean government promotional videos.” In fact, although the White House said it was made by the National Security Council, he said he instinctively suspected the South Koreans might have created it and gave it to Mr. Trump.      “Will it have any impact?” he asked. “Most likely, this patronizing act will give Kim a good laugh. It may also irritate and, paradoxically, reassure him at the same time — in the knowledge that his two adversaries are utterly clueless.”      Jeffrey Lewis, the director of the East Asia Nonproliferation Program at the Middlebury Institute of International Studies, said he thought it would fall flat. “I was gobsmacked by it,” he said. “It seems unlikely that a man who ruthlessly ordered the murder of his half brother with a nerve agent is likely to be beguiled by a film trailer and decide to abandon the nuclear-armed missiles that are a centerpiece of his propaganda.” ||||| Write a summary.","output":"So, WARCZone is like a big box where people put special files called WARCs, which help save parts of the internet.

Group of Seven member Arthur Lismer wrote that he \\"is the manifestation of the Canadian character\\". Another contemporaneous Canadian painter, David Milne, wrote to National Gallery of Canada Director H. O. McCurry in 1930, \\"Your Canadian art apparently, for now at least, went down in Canoe Lake. Tom Thomson still stands as the Canadian painter, harsh, brilliant, brittle, uncouth, not only most Canadian but most creative. How the few things of his stick in one's mind.\\" For Canadian artists Roy Kiyooka and Dennis Lee, he is a \\"haunting presence\\" and \\"embodies the Canadian artistic identity\\".As of 2015, the highest price achieved by a Thomson sketch was Early Spring, Canoe Lake, which sold in 2009 for CAD2,749,500. Few major canvases remain in private collections, making the record unlikely to be broken. One example of the demand his work has achieved is the previously lost Sketch for Lake in Algonquin Park. Discovered in an Edmonton basement in 2018, it sold for nearly half a million dollars at a Toronto auction. The increased value of his work has led to the discovery of numerous forgeries on the market.In 1967, the Tom Thomson Art Gallery opened in Owen Sound. In 1968, Thomson's shack from behind the Studio Building was moved to the McMichael Canadian Art Collection in Kleinburg. Many of his works are also on display at the National Gallery of Canada in Ottawa, the Art Gallery of Ontario, and the McMichael Canadian Art Collection in Kleinburg, Ontario. His influence can be seen in the work of later Canadian artists, including Joyce Wieland. In 2004, another historical marker honouring Thomson was moved from its previous location near the centre of Leith to the graveyard in which he is now buried. The grave site has become popular spot for visitors to the area with many fans of his work leaving pennies or art supplies behind as tribute.  answer the following question:  What is the last name of the person whose works are on display at the National Gallery of Canada in Ottawa, the Art Gallery of Ontario, and the McMichael Canadian Art Collection in Kleinburg, Ontario?","output":"Thomson"},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant that follows instruction extremely well.

Her parents, Leo (Richards) and Justine (Lacey), let her attend, under the condition that she returns at midnight and calls if she's going to be late. Arriving early at the party, Angelica immediately attempts to acquire ecstasy and suspects an attendee named Swan (Stallone) is carrying the drug. When asked about it, Swan informs the two girls that he doesn't have any ecstasy on him, but he has it in a nearby cabin, where his friends live. He requests that Emily and Angelica come to the cabin with him and meet his friends; the two comply. Unbeknownst to the girls, Swan's friends are actually his father Chaos (Gage), a notorious and wanted criminal and his father's gang, which consists of Chaos' girlfriend Daisy (Quann) and felon Frankie (Wozniak). Chaos sent his son to the party in order to lure unsuspecting women. Upon their arrival at the cabin, Emily and Angelica are quickly captured by the gang and taken to an abandoned part in the woods. The girls manage to escape their captors and split up in an attempt to make it harder for Chaos and his gang to find them. Angelica is ultimately caught by Daisy and brought before Chaos, who tortures and stabs her death, and then proceeds to violate her corpse. Chaos and his group continue their pursuit of Emily, even as the sun sets. They briefly re-encounter her, but Emily manages to steal Daisy's knife in a struggle and stabs Swan in the genitals.

Answer the following question: We all present these glossy lives to the world; coffee cups presented to dewy sunrises, champagne in airport lounges, luxurious restaurants that cost more than they should and share the blue skies days of exploration. I’m as guilty as anyone. But, what about behind those scenes? Those days where the wind is so strong you can’t instastory for talking (I’m looking at you Cornwall), when travel mistakes happen (like in Vienna where I accidentally booked our trip a day short) or when everyone asks you what your next trip will be and you sheepishly have to answer ‘er, not sure’. So I thought I’d get a few things off my chest, and confess a few of the reasons why I probably shouldn’t be calling myself a travel blogger. And yes, these are all very much first world problems. 1. I hate photographs of myself. Ironic, no? Especially when one of the first rules of blogging is all about the cult of personality. I just don’t like them. I wish I did, but there are few times that I fancy a photo and even less when I like the result. 2. We nip into a MacDonalds at least once every trip. It has now become a tradition between nicer restaurants to nip in and order a Big Mac and fries at some point of our trip – but especially in Europe for some reason. Why do their MacDonalds meals taste better? 3. Pastels aren’t really my shade. Again, I wish I could be super girly, twirling in gossamer skirts painted in spring shades but I’m just not. My colour palette is decidedly autumnal/jewel hued and usually sticks to a scarf draped around my neck in a hopefully fashionable manner. And I’m totally ok with that. 4.

Write an article based on this summary: Two Chinese citizens have been killed and another wounded in a suspected bomb attack in Laos, say Chinese state media.","output":"Title: Suspected Bomb Attack in Laos Results in the Death of Two Chinese Citizens and Leaves a Third Wounded Introduction In recent news, a suspected bomb attack occurred in Laos, claiming the lives of two Chinese citizens, while leaving another wounded, according to the Chinese state media. This incident highlights the escalating tensions in the region and has prompted concerns among safety and security experts. This article examines the details and possible implications of this tragic event as well as the impact it may have on the fragile relations between China and Laos. The Incident The unfortunate event took place near the Lao-Vietnamese border, a popular destination among Chinese tourists. According to the Chinese state news agency Xinhua, the attack unfolded when a group of Chinese citizens traveling in a minibus were targeted in an explosion. A preliminary investigation by local authorities in Laos suggests that the bomb was planted along the roadside and was remotely detonated. The victims of the attack have been identified as Chinese nationals, highlighting potential motivations for this crime. The injured individual was transported to a nearby clinic, where they received emergency medical treatment. Their condition is stable but remains under observation. Reaction and Impact on China-Laos Relations The Chinese government has expressed concern over the safety of Chinese nationals living and traveling in Laos. Officials from both the Chinese embassy in Laos and the Chinese Ministry of Foreign Affairs have called for a thorough investigation into the attack and requested full cooperation from the Lao authorities. This call for action underscores the significance of the incident and its potential ramifications on China’s ties with Laos, a country heavily dependent on China for investment and infrastructure support. China's Ministry of Foreign Affairs, through its spokesperson, urged the Laotian government to take effective measures to ensure the security of Chinese citizens and their assets in the country. While there have not been any explicit accusations against the Lao government, it goes without saying that failure to act could strain the China-Laos relationship. The Lao government has condemned the attack and extended its condolences to the Chinese government and the families of the victims. Laos authorities have assured China of their full cooperation with the investigation, in a bid to bring the perpetrators to justice. Possible Motives The motive behind the suspected bomb attack remains unclear, as no group has claimed responsibility so far. However, some speculations exist that conflict or disagreements arising from China’s Belt and Road Initiative (BRI) investments could have played a role in the incident. Laos is a key partner of China's BRI projects in Southeast Asia, primarily in terms of infrastructure development. Consequently, there are concerns that local unrest or dissatisfaction could have spurred this attack to undermine China's position in Laos. Additionally, ethnic and political tensions continue to exist in the border regions of Laos, which is further exemplified by a history of sporadic violence. This situation could contribute to the involvement of a group or groups with specific local grievances, aiming to send a message either to China or the Lao government. Conclusion The recent suspected bomb attack that claimed the lives of two Chinese citizens and injured another puts further strain on the relations between China and Laos. While the motive behind the attack remains unclear, it has succeeded in conveying an alarming message prompting both governments to act urgently to ensure the security of Chinese nationals in Laos. As the investigation progresses, it is crucial for China and Laos to cooperate closely in order to identify the perpetrators and maintain the delicate balance in their relations. This incident is a reminder that regional security tensions require constant vigilance by all relevant stakeholders."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant. You will be given a task.

Would \\"This was one of the most controversial acts of the 1850 compromise and heightened Northern fears of a \\" slave power conspiracy\\".\\" be a reasonable answer? Choices: 1. No; 2. Yes; The answer is:","output":"2. Yes; The Fugitive Slave Law, also known as the Fugitive Slave Act, was passed by the United States Congress and enacted as part of the Compromise of 1850. The primary goal of this law was to address the issue of runaway slaves by requiring their return to their owners in the South. It was one of the most controversial acts of the 1850 compromise and indeed heightened Northern fears of a \\"slave power conspiracy.\\" The Compromise of 1850 was a set of five bills that aimed to resolve the sectional conflict between the Northern and Southern states. This conflict had arisen in the aftermath of the Mexican-American War, as new territories were acquired, and disputes arose over their status as slave or free states. The Fugitive Slave Act was enacted as one of the five component bills of the Compromise to address this matter. The Fugitive Slave Act made it a federal offense for individuals to assist or harbor escaped slaves, and it mandated that state and federal officials aid in the capture and return of these slaves to their owners. In addition, the law provided for the use of federal commissioners to adjudicate claims of fugitive slaves, without the right of these alleged escapees to a trial by jury or the presentation of any evidence on their own behalf. The Northern states, which were generally opposed to slavery, found the Fugitive Slave Act particularly onerous. Abolitionists, including groups such as the Underground Railroad, had long been assisting slaves in their escape and relocation to the free states or Canada, and this law effectively forced them to violate their moral convictions in order to avoid prosecution. This situation only served to further polarize the country, leading to an increase in tension between the North and the South. In this context, it is entirely reasonable to say that the Fugitive Slave Act was one of the most controversial acts of the 1850 compromise and heightened Northern fears of a \\"slave power conspiracy.\\" The passage of the law, as well as its subsequent enforcement, generated widespread uproar in the North and fueled a growing divide between the two regions, which would eventually contribute to the outbreak of the American Civil War in 1861."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Step 1: Combine like terms on the left side of the equation -93*m and 266*m are like terms, so we add them together: (-93 + 266) * m + 16325 = -480*m 173 * m + 16325 = -480 * m Step 2: Move the terms with m to one side of the equation and constants to the other side Now, we want to move the -480*m term to the left side of the equation. To do this, we can add 480*m to both sides of the equation: 173*m + 480*m + 16325 = -480*m + 480*m 653*m + 16325 = 0 Step 3: Move the constant term to the right side We want to isolate the m term, so we need to move the constant term 16325 to the right side of the equation. We can accomplish this by subtracting 16325 from both sides of the equation: 653*m + 16325 - 16325 = 0 -16325 653*m = -16325 Step 4: Solve for m Now, we have an equation with only one term containing m.

It was so named by the Falkland Islands Dependencies Survey , following their survey of 1948 -- 49 , because of the continuous avalanches from the hanging glaciers above the corrie .  - Coronation Island is the largest of the South Orkney Islands, long and from wide. The island extends in a general east-west direction, is mainly ice-covered and comprises numerous bays, glaciers and peaks, the highest rising to .  - The South Orkney Islands are a group of islands in the Southern Ocean, about north-east of the tip of the Antarctic Peninsula. They have a total area of about . The islands are claimed both by Britain (as part of the British Antarctic Territory since 1962, previously as a Falkland Islands Dependency), and by Argentina as part of Argentine Antarctica. Under the 1959 Antarctic Treaty, sovereignty claims are held in abeyance.  - Snowpack forms from layers of snow that accumulate in geographic regions and high altitudes where the climate includes cold weather for extended periods during the year. Snowpacks are an important water resource that feed streams and rivers as they melt. Therefore, snowpacks are both the drinking water source for many communities and a potential source of flooding (in case of sudden melting). Snowpacks also contribute mass to glaciers in their accumulation zone.  - In fluid dynamics, a gravity current is a primarily horizontal flow in a gravitational field that is driven by a density difference, hence gravity currents also sometimes being referred to as \\"density currents\\". When a gravity current propagates along a plane of neutral buoyancy within a stratified ambient fluid, it is known as a Gravity Current Intrusion. Typically, the density difference is small enough for the Boussinesq approximation to be valid. Gravity currents can be either finite in volume, such as the release from a dam break, or continuously supplied from a source, such as in doorway or lava flows.  - An amphitheatre or amphitheater is an open-air venue used for entertainment, performances, and sports. The term derives from the ancient Greek  (\\"amphitheatron\\"), from  (\\"amphi\\"), meaning \\"on both sides\\" or \\"around\\" and  (\\"thétron\\"), meaning \\"place for viewing\\".  - Snow pertains to frozen crystalline water throughout its life cycle, starting when it precipitates from clouds and accumulates on surfaces, then metamorphoses in place, and ultimately melts, slides or sublimates away. Snowstorms organize and develop by feeding on sources of atmospheric moisture and cold air. Snowflakes nucleate around particles in the atmosphere by attracting supercooled water droplets, which freeze in hexagonal-shaped crystals. Snowflakes take on a variety of shapes, basic among these are platelets, needles, columns and rime. As snow accumulates into a snowpack, it may blow into drifts. Over time, accumulated snow metamorphoses, by sintering, sublimation and freeze-thaw. Where the climate is cold enough for year-to-year accumulation, a glacier may form. Otherwise, snow typically melts, seasonally, and causes runoff into streams and rivers and recharging groundwater.  - The Antarctic Peninsula is the northernmost part of the mainland of Antarctica, located at the base of the Southern Hemisphere. At the surface, it is the biggest, most prominent peninsula in Antarctica as it extends from a line between Cape Adams (Weddell Sea) and a point on the mainland south of Eklund Islands. Beneath the ice sheet which covers it, the Antarctic Peninsula consists of a string of bedrock islands; these are separated by deep channels whose bottoms lie at depths considerably below current sea level. They are joined together by a grounded ice sheet. Tierra del Fuego, the southernmost tip of South America, lies only about away across the Drake Passage.  - In earth science, erosion is the action of surface processes (such as water flow or wind) that remove soil, rock, or dissolved material from one location on the Earth's crust, then transport it away to another location. The particulate breakdown of rock or soil into clastic sediment is referred to as \\"physical\\" or \\"mechanical\\" erosion; this contrasts with \\"chemical\\" erosion, where soil or rock material is removed from an area by its dissolving into a solvent (typically water), followed by the flow away of that solution. Eroded sediment or solutes may be transported just a few millimetres, or for thousands of kilometres.  - The British Antarctic Territory (BAT) is a sector of Antarctica claimed by the United Kingdom as one of its 14 British Overseas Territories, and is the largest. It comprises the region south of 60°S latitude and between longitudes and , forming a wedge shape that extends to the South Pole, overlapping the Antarctic claims of Argentina (Argentine Antarctica) and Chile (Chilean Antarctic Territory).  - A valley is a low area between hills, often with a river running through it.  - A cauldron (or caldron) is a large metal pot (kettle) for cooking and/or boiling over an open fire, with a large mouth and frequently with an arc-shaped hanger.  - The Southern Ocean, also known as the Antarctic Ocean or the Austral Ocean, comprises the southernmost waters of the World Ocean, generally taken to be south of 60° S latitude and encircling Antarctica. As such, it is regarded as the fourth-largest of the five principal oceanic divisions: smaller than the Pacific, Atlantic, and Indian Oceans but larger than the Arctic Ocean. This ocean zone is where cold, northward flowing waters from the Antarctic mix with warmer subantarctic waters.  - An avalanche (also called a snowslide or snowslip) is a rapid flow of snow down a sloping surface. Avalanches are typically triggered in a starting zone from a mechanical failure in the snowpack (slab avalanche) when the forces on the snow exceed its strength but sometimes only with gradually widening (loose snow avalanche). After initiation, avalanches usually accelerate rapidly and grow in mass and volume as they entrain more snow. If the avalanche moves fast enough some of the snow may mix with the air forming a powder snow avalanche, which is a type of gravity current.  - Argentine Antarctica is a sector of Antarctica claimed by Argentina as part of its national territory consisting of the Antarctic Peninsula and a triangular section extending to the South Pole, delimited by the 25° West and 74° West meridians and the 60° South parallel. This region overlaps with British and Chilean claims in Antarctica; however, all claims are suspended by the Antarctic Treaty System, of which Argentina is a founding signatory and permanent consulting member, with the Antarctic Treaty Secretariat being based in Buenos Aires.  - Orkney, also known as the Orkney Islands, is an archipelago in the Northern Isles of Scotland, situated off the north coast of Great Britain. Orkney is 16 kilometres (10 mi) north of the coast of Caithness and comprises approximately 70 islands, of which 20 are inhabited. The largest island Mainland is often referred to as \\"the Mainland\\". It has an area of , making it the sixth-largest Scottish island and the tenth-largest island in the British Isles. The largest settlement and administrative centre is Kirkwall.  - Antarctica (US English , UK English or ) is Earth's southernmost continent. It contains the geographic South Pole and is situated in the Antarctic region of the Southern Hemisphere, almost entirely south of the Antarctic Circle, and is surrounded by the Southern Ocean. At , it is the fifth-largest continent. For comparison, Antarctica is nearly twice the size of Australia. About 98% of Antarctica is covered by ice that averages in thickness, which extends to all but the northernmost reaches of the Antarctic Peninsula.  - Fluvial is a term used in geography and geology to refer to the processes associated with rivers and streams and the deposits and landforms created by them. When the stream or rivers are associated with glaciers, ice sheets, or ice caps, the term glaciofluvial or fluvioglacial is used.  - A cirque (French, from the Latin word \\"circus\\") is an amphitheatre-like valley formed by glacial erosion. Alternative names for this landform are corrie (from Scottish Gaelic \\"coire\\" meaning a pot or cauldron) and cwm (Welsh for \\"valley\\", pronounced \\"coom\\"). A cirque may also be a similarly shaped landform arising from fluvial erosion.    What is the relationship between 'avalanche corrie' and 'landform'? The answer to this question is:","output":"Avalanche Corrie is a specific type of landform. It is an ice-filled cirque, or corrie, located near the south coast of Coronation Island in the South Orkney Islands.

It frustrated Randy that Joel would oversleep so often but","output":"it was a situation that he'd come to accept after months of dealing with his roommate's tardiness. They had been friends since grade school, and despite the flaws Randy saw in his friend, there was also a loyalty that couldn't be shaken. However, when they decided to become roommates for their college years, Randy had no idea how much of an impact Joel's habit would have on their daily lives. Randy began to analyze the root of the problem. He had noticed, on multiple occasions, that Joel had a penchant for staying up late. Whether it was finishing an assignment at the eleventh hour, binge-watching a series or playing video games until the early hours of the morning, Randy realized that Joel was operating under an unhealthy cycle of sleep deprivation. This, in turn, made it difficult for him to wake up on time, leaving Randy to fill in the blanks when it came to dividing shared responsibilities. Over time, the frustrations began to wear on both of them. Joel knew that his actions were impacting his friend and roommate, but he couldn't seem to break the habit. Time and time again, Randy would attempt to discuss the issue with Joel, offering suggestions on how to improve his sleeps schedule, such as setting multiple alarms, using innovative sleep aid apps or adjusting his bedtime routine. Despite his supportive efforts, nothing seemed to change. Randy began to feel the weight of his friend's bemusement on his own life. Their friendship, once filled with laughter and camaraderie, started taking a toll as their interactions became increasingly centered around the issue of oversleeping. Late-night study sessions would inevitably devolve into arguments, and shared meals became less and less frequent as the tension grew between them. Eventually, Randy realized that he could not bear the growing resentment that was building between them. He didn't want to risk losing a lifelong friendship over Joel's tardiness. As difficult as it was for him to accept, Randy began looking for new ways to get a handle on the situation. One day, Randy happened upon an article about coexistence and tolerance. He took the time to introspect and reassess his understanding of his friend's struggle. It dawned on him that perhaps there was more to Joel's problem than just a refusal to change his habits. He knew how much Joel valued their friendship, and it was unlikely that Joel would willingly jeopardize it. Determined to salvage their bond, Randy broached the subject with Joel in a more empathetic manner. He approached the conversation with an open mind and a willingness to truly understand what factors were playing a role in his friend's struggle. For the first time in months, they sat down and discussed the matter without anger. To Randy's surprise, Joel opened up about his anxieties and how they were affecting his sleep. These were factors Randy had never considered before, and he couldn't help but feel a renewed sense of compassion for his friend. Together, they began to work on a plan to improve Joel's sleep schedule and cope with his anxieties. It was a slow process, with occasional setbacks. But as time went on, they found ways to compromise and help each other. Patience and understanding replaced frustration, and their friendship began to flourish once again. It frustrated Randy that Joel would oversleep so often, but as they worked through the issue together, he discovered the value of empathy and the importance of unwavering support. Not only did they grow stronger as individuals, but their bond as friends became unshakable - a testament to the power of facing life's challenges with mutual care and understanding."},{"instruction":"Question: \\"Was Origin published sooner in Swedish or Italian?\\"  Context: \\"The book was widely translated in Darwin's lifetime, but problems arose with translating concepts and metaphors, and some translations were biased by the translator's own agenda. Darwin distributed presentation copies in France and Germany, hoping that suitable applicants would come forward, as translators were expected to make their own arrangements with a local publisher. He welcomed the distinguished elderly naturalist and geologist Heinrich Georg Bronn, but the German translation published in 1860 imposed Bronn's own ideas, adding controversial themes that Darwin had deliberately omitted. Bronn translated \\"favoured races\\" as \\"perfected races\\", and added essays on issues including the origin of life, as well as a final chapter on religious implications partly inspired by Bronn's adherence to Naturphilosophie. In 1862, Bronn produced a second edition based on the third English edition and Darwin's suggested additions, but then died of a heart attack. Darwin corresponded closely with Julius Victor Carus, who published an improved translation in 1867. Darwin's attempts to find a translator in France fell through, and the translation by Clémence Royer published in 1862 added an introduction praising Darwin's ideas as an alternative to religious revelation and promoting ideas anticipating social Darwinism and eugenics, as well as numerous explanatory notes giving her own answers to doubts that Darwin expressed. Darwin corresponded with Royer about a second edition published in 1866 and a third in 1870, but he had difficulty getting her to remove her notes and was troubled by these editions. He remained unsatisfied until a translation by Edmond Barbier was published in 1876. A Dutch translation by Tiberius Cornelis Winkler was published in 1860.

Think like you are answering to a five year old. Royal Swedish Ballet offers an innovative ‘Juliet and Romeo’: One for today There are few tragedies more haunting than the death of innocents, as Shakespeare, Euripides and the daily news remind us. One of the best known of these tragedies gains new power through a moving and boldly original treatment. “Juliet and Romeo” is Swedish choreographer Mats Ek’s version of the ill-fated lovers’ tale, told in a way that honors its Renaissance source while tying it directly to today’s world. The Royal Swedish Ballet gave this 2013 work its North American premiere on Wednesday at the Kennedy Center Opera House. Ek’s ballet has little in common with those heavily draped and chandeliered productions of the Shakespeare story that most balletgoers know. Ek’s characters look pretty much like us, in their slacks, skirts and ponytails. There are no pointe shoes. The teenage boys behave like teenage boys, goofing around and punching each other. It is always night here. The set has a stripped-down look, with a smoky, shadowy stage and forbidding walls that bring to mind cities under siege. This could be modern-day Syria or Iraq, or a U.S. town in crisis. The Capulets patrol their turf on Segways, with the rigid bearing that we instantly recognize as policelike. The music is not the familiar Prokofiev, but Tchaikovsky. In a previous conversation, Ek told me he found that Tchaikovsky evoked young love beautifully, though there wasn’t much in the way of true violence and aggression in his music. Ek needed the violence, too, but love was most important. He chose his excerpts well, and they were splendidly performed by the Opera House Orchestra. Ek took his flip-flopped title from an early short story, “Giulietta e Romeo,” which was probably one of Shakespeare’s sources. Having given his heroine top billing, he also gave her moxie and strength. Again and again it is Juliet who takes the most decisive action and who stands up to her parents. In this austere world, Mariko Kida’s Juliet is the lone bright spot. We first see her wearing yellow, hopping about like a puppy and teasing her Nurse. Ana Laguna, the extraordinarily expressive dancer who is Ek’s longtime muse (and wife), gave the role of the Nurse a grounded moral force. Throughout the ballet she is a witness to the key moments, often peering from the shadows. In her 60s, with her long gray hair in a thick braid, she is also a vigorous and deeply musical member of the cast, matching the bounding Mercutio and Benvolio, for instance, step for step. Her presence highlighted one of the many glories of this company and this production: Not everyone looks alike. There are dancers of varying ages, sizes (Jerome Marchand’s Mercutio towers over Jokuto Kodam’s Benvolio) and backgrounds, with some more trained in ballet, others in modern dance. It takes time to adjust our ears when we’re at a Shakespeare play, and in the same way, it may take a short while to feel engaged by Ek’s unique physical expression: the long, stretched-out lunges, the blown-back torsos and moments when everyone rolls on the floor. It is Ek’s genius, however, that his weighted, earthy, unusual moves arouse vivid emotions. When Mercutio, Benvolio and Anthony Lomuljo’s sweet Romeo are messing around, you ache for them. Especially the big, tattooed Mercutio, who roughly pushes the other two away, yet also yearns for their company. An unnameable change is in the air — we see how the boys sense it, in their intentionally awkward, artless responses to the music, in the way they link arms and take comfort in being together. The giddy beauty of young love is Ek’s high achievement here, but so is the ugliness of hatred, which Ek depicts with equal inventiveness and immediacy. It’s easy, therefore, to link this ballet with what’s going on in today’s world. Age-old frictions and factions continue to tear loved ones apart: The same day that “Juliet and Romeo” opened at the Kennedy Center, this newspaper’s front page told the story of an Israeli woman fatally knifed in her kitchen by a teenage Palestinian boy. Both her family and his spoke poignantly of their grief, confusion and loneliness in the aftermath. That Ek’s ballet seems to anticipate, respond to and add more layers to such heartbreaking violence speaks to his masterful command. How acutely he communicates something real in the make-believe world of the stage. In fact, his art draws us in not by making us believe, but by making us feel. By expressing the yearning, resistance, helplessness — and the hopefulness — of love. Hope is Ek’s coda, as it was Shakespeare’s, and as it must be ours, too. The Royal Swedish Ballet performs “Juliet and Romeo,” by Mats Ek, in the Kennedy Center Opera House through Saturday. Tickets: 29-129. 202-467-4600 or kennedy-center.org.

The following points can help explain why this perception is derived from the text: 1. Word choice: The use of words like \\"bloated\\" and \\"stretches\\" in the sentence indicates that the plot of the story or movie is being criticized for being unnecessarily long and possibly unwarranted. These words evoke a sense of excess, which is often considered as a negative trait. 2. The comparison of running time: Mentioning that the running time is stretched about 10 minutes longer than it should be suggests that the plot is excessive and could have been more concise. This indicates dissatisfaction with the way the story has been structured or paced, and therefore adds to the negative perception of the sentiment. 3. Implication of wasted time: By pointing out the additional 10 minutes of running time, the sentence implies that the extra length does not contribute to the overall quality of the story. This can be perceived as a criticism, meaning that the time spent watching or listening to the story may have been wasted or not well-utilized. 4. Lack of praise or positive descriptions: The sentence does not offer any positive or complimentary feedback on the plot. As it is solely focused on the negative aspects, the sentiment is more likely to be perceived negatively. Overall, the sentiment in this sentence can be considered as negative, as it critiques the plot of a story or movie for being excessively long and potentially wasteful. The word choice and implications in the text contribute to this perception and make it evident that the author does not deem the additional running time as valuable or worthwhile."},{"instruction":"Information:  - The Gesta comitum Barcinonensium et regum Aragoniae ( \`\` Deeds of the counts of Barcelona and kings of Aragon '' ) is a Latin chronicle composed in three stages by some monks of Santa Maria de Ripoll and recounting the reigns of the Counts of Barcelona from Wifred I ( 878 -- 97 ) to James II ( 1291 -- 1327 ) , as late as 1299 . It is the fawning history of the dynasty known as the House of Barcelona . In presenting the rulers of the county of Barcelona as the descendants of Charlemagne , the monks sought to justify their independent policy with respect to the King of France , their nominal sovereign . The Gesta is the chronological backbone . The first composition was made between 1162 and 1184 and ended with the reign of Raymond Berengar IV ( 1131 -- 62 ) . In the late thirteenth century it was continued through the reign of James I ( 1213 -- 76 ) . An abridged version in the Catalan language was produced sometime between 1268 and 1283 . The final Latin version was edited in 1303 -- 14 and included the reigns of Peter the Great ( 1276 -- 87 ) , Alfonso the Generous ( 1287 -- 91 ) , and James II. Except for the first composition , all surviving versions are later copies , today preserved in the Arxiu de la Corona d'Aragó , in the Biblioteca de Catalunya , and in the Bibliothèque Nationale de France . A copy of one of the latter was taken to France by Pierre de Marca and published in 1688 by Étienne Baluze .  - The Kingdom of Aragon (, ) was a medieval and early modern kingdom on the Iberian Peninsula, corresponding to the modern-day autonomous community of Aragon, in Spain. It should not be confused with the larger Crown of Aragon, that also included other territories  the Principality of Catalonia (which included the County of Barcelona and the other Catalan Counties), the Kingdom of Valencia, the Kingdom of Majorca, and other possessions that are now part of France, Italy, and Greece  that were also under the rule of the King of Aragon, but were administered separately from the Kingdom of Aragon.  - Charlemagne (2 April 742/747/74828 January 814), also known as Charles the Great or Charles I, was King of the Franks. He united much of Europe during the early Middle Ages and laid the foundations for modern France, Germany and the Low Countries. He took the Frankish throne in 768 and became King of Italy in 774. From 800, he served as the first Holy Roman Emperorthe first recognised emperor in Western Europe since the fall of the Western Roman Empire three centuries earlier.  - The House of Barcelona was a medieval dynasty that ruled the County of Barcelona continuously from 878 and the Crown of Aragon from 1137 (as kings from 1162). From the male part they descend from the Bellonids, the descendants of Wifred the Hairy. They inherited most of the Catalan counties by the thirteenth century and established a territorial Principality of Catalonia, uniting it with the Kingdom of Aragon through marriage and conquering numerous other lands and kingdoms until the death of the last legitimate male of the main branch, Martin the Humanist, in 1410. Cadet branches of the house continued to rule Urgell (since 992) and Gandia. Cadet branches of the dynasty had also ruled Ausona intermittently from 878 until 1111, Provence from 1112 to 1245, and Sicily from 1282 to 1409. By the Compromise of Caspe of 1412 the Crown of Aragon passed to a branch of the House of Trastámara, descended from the \\"infanta\\" Eleanor of the house of Barcelona.  - A dynasty is a sequence of rulers from the same family, usually in the context of a feudal or monarchical system but sometimes also appearing in elective republics. The dynastic family or lineage may be known as a \\"house\\"; which may be styled \\"royal\\", \\"princely\\", \\"comital\\", etc., depending upon the chief or present title borne by its members. Historians periodize the histories of many sovereign states, such as Ancient Egypt, the Carolingian Empire and Imperial China, using a framework of successive dynasties. As such, the term \\"dynasty\\" may be used to delimit the era during which the family reigned and to describe events, trends, and artifacts of that period (\\"a Ming-dynasty vase\\"). The word \\"dynasty\\" itself is often dropped from such adjectival references (\\"a Ming vase\\").  - Provence (Provençal: \\"Provença\\" in classical norm or \\"Prouvènço\\" in Mistralian norm) is a geographical region and historical province of southeastern France, which extends from the left bank of the lower Rhône River to the west to the Italian border to the east, and is bordered by the Mediterranean Sea to the south. It largely corresponds with the modern administrative \\"région\\" of Provence-Alpes-Côte d'Azur, and includes the \\"départements\\" of Var, Bouches-du-Rhône, Alpes-de-Haute-Provence and parts of Alpes-Maritimes and Vaucluse. The largest city of the region is Marseille.  - The Principality of Catalonia, is a historic territory and a medieval and early modern political entity in the northeastern Iberian Peninsula, mostly in Spain, with an adjoining portion in southern France. Between the 13th and the 18th centuries it was bordered by the Kingdom of Aragon to the west, the Kingdom of Valencia to the south, the Kingdom of France and the feudal lordship of Andorra to the north and by the Mediterranean sea to the east.  - The Franks (or ') are historically first known as a group of Germanic tribes that inhabited the land between the Lower and Middle Rhine in the 3rd century AD, and second as the people of Gaul who merged with the Gallo-Roman populations during succeeding centuries, passing on their name to modern-day France and becoming part of the heritage of the modern French people. Some Franks raided Roman territory, while other Frankish tribes joined the Roman troops of Gaul. In later times, Franks became the military rulers of the northern part of Roman Gaul. With the coronation of their ruler Charlemagne as ' by Pope Leo III in 800 AD, he and his successors were recognised as legitimate successors to the emperors of the Western Roman Empire.  - The County of Barcelona was originally a frontier region under the rule of the Carolingian dynasty. By the end of the 10th century, the Counts of Barcelona were \\"de facto\\" independent, hereditary rulers in constant warfare with the Islamic caliphate of Córdoba and its successor states. The counts, through marriage alliances and treaties, acquired the other Catalan counties and extended their influence along Occitania. Barcelona formed the nucleus of the emergent Principality of Catalonia. In 1164, the count of Barcelona, Alfons I, inherited the Kingdom of Aragon (as Alfonso II). Thenceforward, the history of the county of Barcelona is subsumed within that of the Crown of Aragon, but the city of Barcelona remained preeminent within it.  - An era is a span of time marked by character, events, changes on earth, etc. When used in science, for example geology, an \\"era\\" denotes a clearly defined period of time of arbitrary but well-defined length, such as for example the Mesozoic Era frozen m 252 Ma66 Ma, delimited by a start event and an end event. When used in social history, eras may for example denote a period of some monarch's reign. In colloquial language, eras denote longer spans of time, before and after which the practices or fashions change to a significant degree. When era is extended to a calendar system, it is known as a calendar era. In Sanskrit or Indian culture eras are known as yugas.  - Ancient Egypt was a civilization of ancient Northeastern Africa, concentrated along the lower reaches of the Nile River in what is now the modern country of Egypt. It is one of six civilizations to arise independently. Egyptian civilization followed prehistoric Egypt and coalesced around 3150 BC (according to conventional Egyptian chronology) with the political unification of Upper and Lower Egypt under the first pharaoh Narmer (commonly referred to as Menes). The history of ancient Egypt occurred in a series of stable kingdoms, separated by periods of relative instability known as Intermediate Periods: the Old Kingdom of the Early Bronze Age, the Middle Kingdom of the Middle Bronze Age and the New Kingdom of the Late Bronze Age.  - France, officially the French Republic, is a country with territory in western Europe and several overseas regions and territories. The European, or metropolitan, area of France extends from the Mediterranean Sea to the English Channel and the North Sea, and from the Rhine to the Atlantic Ocean. Overseas France include French Guiana on the South American continent and several island territories in the Atlantic, Pacific and Indian oceans. France spans and had a total population of almost 67 million people as of January 2017. It is a unitary semi-presidential republic with the capital in Paris, the country's largest city and main cultural and commercial centre. Other major urban centres include Marseille, Lyon, Lille, Nice, Toulouse and Bordeaux.  - Occitania (, , , , also sometimes lo País d'Òc, \\"the Oc Country\\") is the historical region in southern Europe where Occitan was historically the main language spoken, and where it is sometimes still used, for the most part as a second language. This cultural area roughly encompasses the southern half of France, as well as Monaco and smaller parts of Italy (Occitan Valleys, Guardia Piemontese) and Spain (Aran Valley). Occitania has been recognized as a linguistic and cultural concept since the Middle Ages, but has never been a legal nor a political entity under this name, although the territory was united in Roman times as the \\"Seven Provinces\\" and in the early Middle Ages (\\"Aquitanica\\" or the Visigothic Kingdom of Toulouse) before the French conquest started in the early 13th century. Currently about 200,000800,000 people out of 16 million living in the area are either native or proficient speakers of Occitan, although the languages more usually spoken in the area are French, Italian, Catalan and Spanish. Since 2006, the Occitan language has been an official language of Catalonia, which includes the Aran Valley where Occitan gained official status in 1990.  - A prince is a male ruler, monarch, or member of a monarch's or former monarch's family. \\"Prince\\" is also a hereditary title in the nobility of some European states. The feminine equivalent is a princess. The English word derives, via the French word \\"prince\\", from the Latin noun \\"princeps\\", from \\"primus\\" (first) + \\"capio\\" (to seize), meaning \\"the chief, most distinguished, ruler, prince\\".  - The House of Trastámara was a dynasty of kings in Spain , which first governed in Castile beginning in 1369 before expanding its rule into Aragón, Navarre and Naples. They were an illegitimate cadet line of the House of Ivrea.  - The Roman Empire (Koine and Medieval Greek:   , tr. ) was the post-Roman Republic period of the ancient Roman civilization, characterized by government headed by emperors and large territorial holdings around the Mediterranean Sea in Europe, Africa and Asia. The city of Rome was the largest city in the world BC AD, with Constantinople (New Rome) becoming the largest around 500 AD, and the Empire's populace grew to an estimated 50 to 90 million inhabitants (roughly 20% of the world's population at the time). The 500-year-old republic which preceded it was severely destabilized in a series of civil wars and political conflict, during which Julius Caesar was appointed as perpetual dictator and then assassinated in 44 BC. Civil wars and executions continued, culminating in the victory of Octavian, Caesar's adopted son, over Mark Antony and Cleopatra at the Battle of Actium in 31 BC and the annexation of Egypt. Octavian's power was then unassailable and in 27 BC the Roman Senate formally granted him overarching power and the new title \\"Augustus\\", effectively marking the end of the Roman Republic.  - The Catalan counties were the administrative divisions of the eastern Carolingian \\"Marca Hispanica\\" and southernmost part of the March of Gothia created after its Frankish conquest. The various counties roughly defined what came to be known as the Principality of Catalonia.   - The Bellonids, sometimes called the Bellonid Dynasty, were the counts descendant of the Goth Belló who ruled in Carcassonne, Urgell, Cerdanya, County of Conflent, Barcelona, and numerous other Catalan and Septimanian counties and marches in the 9th and 10th centuries. His most famous grandson was Wilfred the Hairy, who founded the House of Barcelona, rulers of the County of Barcelona from 878, and since 1164 the Crown of Aragon, until the end of the reign of Martin the Humane in 1410.  - The Low Countries is a coastal region in western Europe, consisting especially of the Netherlands and Belgium, and the low-lying delta of the Rhine, Meuse, Scheldt, and Ems rivers where much of the land is at or below sea level. This wide area of Western Europe roughly stretches from French Gravelines and Dunkirk at its southwestern point, to the area of Dutch Delfzijl and German Eastern Frisia at its northeastern point, and to Luxembourg and French Thionville in the southeast.  - A chronicle (from Greek , from , \\"chronos\\", \\"time\\") is a historical account of facts and events ranged in chronological order, as in a time line. Typically, equal weight is given for historically important events and local events, the purpose being the recording of events that occurred, seen from the perspective of the chronicler. This is in contrast to a narrative or history, which sets selected events in a meaningful interpretive context and excludes those the author does not see as important.  - The Carolingian dynasty (known variously as the Carlovingians, Carolingus, Carolings or Karlings) was a Frankish noble family with origins in the Arnulfing and Pippinid clans of the 7th century AD. The name \\"Carolingian\\" (Medieval Latin \\"karolingi\\", an altered form of an unattested Old High German word *\\"karling, kerling\\", meaning \\"descendant of Charles\\", cf. MHG \\"kerlinc\\") derives from the Latinised name of Charles Martel: \\"Carolus\\". The dynasty consolidated its power in the mid 8th century, eventually making the offices of mayor of the palace and \\"dux et princeps Francorum\\" hereditary, and becoming the \\"de facto\\" rulers of the Franks as the real powers behind the Merovingian throne. In 751 the Merovingian dynasty, which had ruled the Germanic Franks was overthrown with the consent of the Papacy and the aristocracy, and a Carolingian Pepin the Short was crowned King of the Franks. The Carolingian dynasty reached its peak in 800 with the crowning of Charlemagne as the first Emperor of Romans in over three centuries. His death in 814 began an extended period of fragmentation of the Carolingian empire and decline that would eventually lead to the evolution of the Kingdom of France and the Holy Roman Empire.  - The Crown of Aragon was a composite monarchy, also nowadays referred to as a confederation of individual polities or kingdoms ruled by one king, with a personal and dynastic union of the Kingdom of Aragon and the County of Barcelona. At the height of its power in the 14th and 15th centuries, the Crown of Aragon was a thalassocracy (a state with primarily maritime realms) controlling a large portion of present-day eastern Spain, parts of what is now southern France, and a Mediterranean \\"empire\\" which included the Balearic Islands, Sicily, Corsica, Sardinia, Malta, Southern Italy (from 1442) and parts of Greece (until 1388). The component realms of the Crown were not united politically except at the level of the king, who ruled over each autonomous polity according to its own laws, raising funds under each tax structure, dealing separately with each \\"Corts\\" or \\"Cortes\\". Put in contemporary terms, it has sometimes been considered that the different lands of the Crown of Aragon (mainly the Kingdom of Aragon, the Principality of Catalonia and the Kingdom of Valencia) functioned more as a confederation than as a single kingdom. In this sense, the larger Crown of Aragon must not be confused with one of its constituent parts, the Kingdom of Aragon, from which it takes its name.  - Italy, officially the Italian Republic, is a unitary parliamentary republic in Europe. Located in the heart of the Mediterranean Sea, Italy shares open land borders with France, Switzerland, Austria, Slovenia, San Marino and Vatican City. Italy covers an area of and has a largely temperate seasonal climate and Mediterranean climate; due to its shape, it is often referred to in Italy as \\"lo Stivale\\" (the Boot). With 61 million inhabitants, it is the fourth most populous EU member state.

Bill used insecticides to get read of aphids, while his buddy farmer Paul didn't.  But I can use this background: Insecticide control of aphids is difficult, as they breed rapidly, so even small areas missed may enable the population to recover promptly. Aphids may occupy the undersides of leaves where spray misses them, while systemic insecticides do not move satisfactorily into flower petals. Finally, some aphid species are resistant to common insecticide classes including carbamates, organophosphates, and pyrethroids.For small backyard infestations, spraying plants thoroughly with a strong water jet every few days may be sufficient protection. An insecticidal soap solution can be an effective household remedy to control aphids, but it only kills aphids on contact and has no residual effect. Soap spray may damage plants, especially at higher concentrations or at temperatures above 32 °C (90 °F); some plant species are sensitive to soap sprays.

Answer this question: who discovered that the nuclei of atoms contained neutrons that carries no charge??","output":"The discovery of the neutron and the realization that it resides within the atomic nucleus are attributed to James Chadwick, a British physicist who made this groundbreaking discovery in 1932. The journey towards this discovery, however, was preceded by numerous critical findings and collaborative efforts from other brilliant minds in the world of physics.  Before diving into Chadwick's discovery, it is essential to understand the background and some earlier discoveries in atomic structure. In the late 19th and early 20th centuries, scientists made a series of significant breakthroughs that unraveled the mysteries of atomic structure. In 1897, the British physicist J.J. Thomson discovered the electron – a negatively charged subatomic particle. His work led to the development of the \\"plum pudding\\" model of the atom, which proposed that the atom consisted of negatively charged electrons dispersed in a positive \\"soup\\" much like plums in a Christmas pudding. This model was later challenged by the work of Ernest Rutherford, a physicist from New Zealand. Rutherford's famous Gold Foil Experiment (performed in 1909 with Hans Geiger and Ernest Marsden) revealed that most of an atom's mass was concentrated in a central positive core, which he later termed the nucleus. This led to the conception of the \\"Rutherford model,\\" where electrons orbit the dense, positively charged nucleus, much like planets orbit the sun. Another critical figure in the story of the neutron is the Danish physicist Niels Bohr. Bohr's work built on Rutherford's atomic model, refining it by incorporating the principles of quantization and suggesting that electrons occupied specific energy levels around the nucleus. Despite these advancements in understanding the atom, the model could not explain the atomic mass discrepancies or the behavior of isotopes. The final piece of the puzzle came in 1932 when James Chadwick, a student of Rutherford, performed a series of experiments at the Cavendish Laboratory in Cambridge, England. Chadwick hypothesized that the nucleus contained another neutral particle (neutron), which would account for the atomic mass disparity and the existence of isotopes. He reached this conclusion after studying the high-energy particle emission from radioactive decay. Chadwick observed that when beryllium was exposed to alpha particles, it emitted a stream of unidentified particles, which he called neutrons. In his experiments, Chadwick employed the radioactive substance polonium to emit alpha particles, which struck a beryllium target. The beryllium emitted the mysterious, high-energy particles, which then interacted with a paraffin wax, as it was thought that hydrogen nuclei would be useful in detecting the neutral particles thanks to their similar masses. As the particles passed through the wax, they caused protons to be ejected. The ejected protons’ energy was observed and measured, indicating that these emitted neutrons had no charge. Chadwick's discovery of the neutron was an essential milestone in atomic and nuclear physics. The identification of an uncharged particle residing in the atomic nucleus paved the way for many subsequent advancements, such as nuclear fission, the development of atomic weapons, and nuclear power generation. This discovery also contributed significantly to the development of modern atomic theory and understanding the behavior of isotopes, which are crucial in various fields, including biology, chemistry, medicine, and materials science."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Gerard Brantsen (1735-1809) was a Dutch diplomat and politician in the 18th-19th century. His most significant contribution was to the Treaty of Paris in 1783, which marked the end of the Fourth Anglo-Dutch War. The Fourth Anglo-Dutch War was a conflict between the Kingdom of Great Britain and the Dutch Republic, and commenced on December 20, 1780. The war was primarily driven by commercial rivalries and political tensions that emerged from the American Revolutionary War. At this time, the Dutch Republic, in an attempt to protect their trade interests, sought to provide military assistance and resources to the newly established United States of America. This support of the rebellious colonies angered Great Britain and consequently led to the escalation of hostilities between the two European powers. The Treaty of Paris, which ended the Fourth Anglo-Dutch War, was signed on September 3, 1783. The negotiations brought together the major powers involved in the American Revolutionary War. Delegates from the United States, France, Spain, and the Dutch Republic were present to deliberate the terms for reestablishing diplomatic relations and resolving territorial disputes. Gerard Brantsen, acting as one of the Dutch envoys, played a significant role in the negotiation process.

Most were eventually rebuilt, using castings of the original façades to retain the architectural style. The menagerie of exotic animals featured at the 1915 exposition provided the basis for the San Diego Zoo.

Just make sure not to startle your co-workers if you start yelling, \\"Awesome, baby!\\" Everyone in the entire country, starting on Selection Sunday when the NCAA Tournament brackets are revealed, becomes a college basketball expert. From President Obama to that annoying woman in accounting who lets her corgie make the picks (and still somehow wins the office pool), we're all about to pretend we know more about Cinderella than the prince himself. So if you're just now beginning to pay attention, here is an A-to-Z primer of what you're going to find in your brackets. If that doesn't seem like a long drought, consider: The","output":"last time a team with a losing record made it to the NCAA Tournament was back in 1999 when Florida A&M stunned the college basketball world. Since then, there have been numerous attempts for lesser-known programs (or Cinderellas, as they're often called) to defy the odds and make it to the Big Dance. This year promises to be no exception, as several potential dark horse contenders are poised to make their mark on the national stage. But amid all the Cinderella stories and bracket-busting upsets, there remains a certain level of predictability within the NCAA Tournament. Powerhouse programs such as Duke, Kentucky, and Kansas are perennial fixtures on the brackets, and their success often sets the pace for the rest of the field. However, part of the tournament's appeal lies in the fact that anything can happen once the first round begins, setting the stage for what has become one of the most exciting sporting events in the United States. One crucial aspect of filling out a winning bracket is to understand the mechanics of the seeding process. Teams are ranked from 1 to 16 within four different regions – East, West, Midwest, and South – depending on their performance during the regular season and conference tournaments. This seeding determines their matchups in the tournament. While the higher-ranked teams generally have better odds of advancing to later rounds, they must navigate through a minefield of potential upsets at the hands of lower-seeded squads that have nothing to lose. Often, it is these matchups that help form the enduring legends of the tournament, as fans and pundits alike revel in the unexpected triumphs of the underdog. Another crucial concept to grasp is that of the tournament's one-and-done nature. Unlike the professional leagues, there are no best-of-seven series in college basketball – each game is a single-elimination affair, meaning that one bad performance can spell the end of a team's season. This high-stakes atmosphere is what fuels the intensity and passion behind the NCAA Tournament, as both players and fans alike are all too aware of the fact that one wrong move or one unlucky bounce could send a championship contender packing. In summary, succeeding in your office pool or finding your inner Dick Vitale requires a blend of basketball knowledge, an understanding of the tournament structure, and a healthy dose of good fortune. It's important to pay attention to patterns and trends throughout the season to make educated guesses on which teams are poised to pull off an upset, but remember that no strategy is foolproof in the ever-unpredictable world of March Madness. As you prepare to fill out this year's bracket, take some time to learn about the participating teams and enjoy the stories they will inevitably bring to the tournament. Whether you choose to root for the underdog or stick to the safe and familiar path of backing the established powerhouses, the NCAA Tournament is a nearly month-long celebration of the very best that college basketball has to offer. And who knows – with a little luck and the right amount of bracket savvy, you may just find yourself atop the office pool standings and proudly proclaiming \\"Awesome, baby!\\" for all to hear."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

As he seeks to improve his sound, he stumbles upon Chan, an enigmatic man with a unique, mysterious audio system. As the two become entangled in a dangerous plot, Lau must unravel the secrets of the audio system and the mysterious organization in the background. ----- Act 1: Rising Beats We're introduced to Lau, a young, talented musician struggling to find his place in the Hong Kong music scene. Desperate for a powerful and crystal-clear sound, Lau hears of an underground audio technology that promises to elevate his performances to a new level. In a dimly lit bar, Lau meets Chan, a secretive man with a penchant for obscure, high-quality audio equipment. Lau is mesmerized by the sound produced by Chan's system—it's unlike anything he has ever heard. Eager to get his hands on the equipment, Lau proposes a deal. Chan agrees, but with a cryptic warning that Lau must not dig too deep into the origins of the technology. Act 2: Amplified Pursuit As Lau starts using the new audio system, he notices some unusual sounds hidden beneath the music—a series of encoded messages woven through the tracks. Driven by curiosity, Lau decides to go against Chan's warning, and investigates the source of the messages. His search leads him to a secretive organization known as the Sonic Order, which uses music and advanced technology for mysterious purposes. In his quest for answers, Lau befriends Lily, a former member of the organization, who reveals that the Sonic Order is involved in illegal activities such as cyber-espionage, mind manipulation, and hidden communication. With the audio system being the key to their operations, Chan, a high-ranking member of the Sonic Order, was entrusted with its sale to fund their expansion. Act 3: Reverberation of Consequences The Sonic Order realizes that Lau is aware of their secrets and sends their agents to recover the audio system and silence Lau and Lily. In a series of intense encounters, Lau and Lily fight against the agents and try to dismantle the organization from the inside. As the conflict reaches its peak, Lau confronts Chan once more, who tells him that the Sonic Order is actually trying to prevent an even bigger threat that could harm millions of people. Lau is confused but decides to trust his intuition and sides with Chan. In the final act, Lau, Lily, and Chan work together to expose and thwart the real threat—a powerful corporation that aims to use sonic technology to control the population. They successfully sabotage the corporation's plans while keeping the audio system hidden from those who might misuse it. In the epilogue, Lau's music career takes off, and he becomes a recognized artist, using his newfound success and connections to ensure the Sonic Order's dangerous technology remains a secret, protecting it from falling into the wrong hands."},{"instruction":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

Moments later, Henry is helped by an older version of himself who has also traveled back. Unable to control the timing or destinations of his traveling, Henry finds himself drawn to significant people, places, and events in his life but is incapable of changing events beyond the minor differences his presence creates. In 1991, Henry meets Clare Abshire in the library where he works. She is overjoyed to see him although he is actually meeting her for the first time. Clare explains that she met Henry's future self when she was a child, and that he informed her then that they would meet in the future, which is happening at the moment. Since childhood, Henry has been Clare's best friend and visited her. Clare develops a crush with Henry, and she is upset after learning that he is married. When Clare turned 18, which is two years before their meeting at the library, the older Henry kissed Clare, leading her to realize that he is romantically involved with her and thus is her husband in the future. They begin a relationship, which is challenged by Henry's disorder. His sporadic time traveling is further complicated by the fact that he arrives at his destination completely naked. From an early age, he learned how to pick locks and to steal clothing to endure his travels. Among his getaways are many visits to young Clare. From present-day Clare's diary, he gets a list of dates when he visited her, and gives those to young Clare so that she can be waiting for him with clothes. Falling in love, Henry and Clare eventually marry, though he actually time travels away before the ceremony and an older version of himself arrives in time to step in, though his altered appearance confuses guests. Henry's disappearances allow him to win the lottery by having the numbers in advance, but his disorder takes a toll on his relationship with Clare. It also makes having a child with Clare...

The 9/11 plotters eventually spent somewhere between 400,000 and 500,000 to plan and conduct their attack. Consistent with the importance of the project, al Qaeda funded the plotters. KSM provided his operatives with nearly all the money they needed to travel to the United States, train, and live. The plotters' tradecraft was not especially sophisticated, but it was good enough. They moved, stored, and spent their money in ordinary ways, easily defeating the detection mechanisms in place at the time. The origin of the funds remains unknown, although we have a general idea of how al Qaeda financed itself during the period leading up to 9/11. General Financing As we explained in chapter 2,  Bin Laden did not fund al Qaeda through a personal fortune and a network of businesses in Sudan. Instead, al Qaeda relied primarily on a fund-raising network developed over time. The CIA now estimates that it cost al Qaeda about 30 million per year to sustain its activities before 9/11 and that this money was raised almost entirely through donations. For many years, the United States thought  Bin Laden financed al Qaeda's expenses through a vast personal inheritance.  Bin Laden purportedly inherited approximately 300 million when his father died, and was rumored to have had access to these funds to wage jihad while in Sudan and Afghanistan and to secure his leadership position in al Qaeda. In early 2000, the U.S. government discovered a different reality: roughly from 1970 through 1994,  Bin Laden received about 1 million per year-a significant sum, to be sure, but not a 300 million fortune that could be used to fund jihad. Then, as part of a Saudi government crackdown early in the 1990s, the  Bin Laden family was forced to find a buyer for Usama's share of the family company in 1994. The Saudi government subsequently froze the proceeds of the sale. This action had the effect of divesting  Bin Laden of what otherwise might indeed have been a large fortune. Nor were  Bin Laden's assets in Sudan a source of money for al Qaeda. When  Bin Laden lived in Sudan from 1991 to 1996, he owned a number of businesses and other assets.

Please answer this question: Whom did Idi Amin depose in the 1971 coup in Uganda?","output":"Idi Amin deposed President Dr. Apollo Milton Obote in the 1971 coup in Uganda. The coup occurred on January 25, 1971, while Obote was attending a Commonwealth summit meeting in Singapore. Amin, who was serving as commander of the Ugandan Army under President Obote, orchestrated the coup in his absence, seizing control of the government and installing himself as the new head of state. Apollo Milton Obote was Uganda's first post-colonial Prime Minister from 1962 to 1966, and then he served as the President from 1966 until his overthrow in 1971. He played a significant role in Uganda's early post-independence political landscape, leading the country through initial years of nation-building and laying the terms of internal governance. As a founder and leader of the Uganda People's Congress (UPC), Obote's first term focused on finding revenue sources, alleviating poverty, and fostering national unity. However, his consolidation of power, particularly through the 1966 crisis which led to the suspension of the Ugandan Constitution and his shift from prime minister to president, created tensions and vulnerabilities within the government and military. Idi Amin, who was a trusted military confidant of Obote, had risen through the ranks of the armed forces, thanks to his loyalty and effectiveness in implementing military actions against Obote's political rivals. While Obote believed that Amin's loyalty would keep the military in check, Amin's aspirations and ambitions began to cause divisions, eventually leading to the coup in 1971. Amin's ascendancy to power and his brutal regime, which lasted from 1971 to 1979, marked a dark period in Uganda's history. His rule was characterized by widespread human rights abuses, extensive bloodshed, political and ethnic persecution, extrajudicial killings, and the expulsion of minorities, particularly Asians, from the country. Experts estimate that between 100,000 and 500,000 people lost their lives under Amin's regime, making it one of the most horrific and tyrannical periods in Africa's modern history. In 1979, Amin was eventually overthrown by a coalition of Ugandan exiles and the Tanzanian army. Obote, who was living in exile in Tanzania, returned to Uganda in 1980 and was re-elected as the president. However, his second term faced numerous challenges, and he struggled to regain the trust and support of the populace. Obote was ultimately deposed again in 1985 following a military coup led by General Tito Okello. Obote fled to Zambia, where he spent the rest of his life in exile until his death in 2005. Overall, the 1971 coup that brought Idi Amin to power was a destabilizing event in Uganda's history and significantly impacted the political, social, and economic trajectory of the country for decades to come. The reign of these two leaders, Obote and Amin, is a testament to the complexity of post-colonial African politics and the lasting legacies of their time in office."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Came here 2 years ago when my boyfriend and I went to Vegas together... I ate maryland crab cakes benedict at 4AM with him... and... I... fell... in... LOVE! Seriously.   Came back to Hawaii... and constantly craved these damn delicious crab cakes. Ask him. He'll tell you. So... when my girls trip plans were to Vegas... I KNEW I had to hit up this spot...

A: Answer:","output":"The airway and the lungs are part of the Respiratory System. The primary function of the respiratory system is to take in oxygen from the environment and expel carbon dioxide from the body. This process is usually done through breathing.     The Respiratory System is composed of various organs and structures, including:     1. Nasal cavities and nose: Filters, warms, and moistens the incoming air. 2. Pharynx (throat): Serves as a passageway for both food and air. 3. Larynx (voice box): Allows vocalization, and prevents food from entering the trachea. 4. Trachea (windpipe): A major tube that carries air to the lungs. 5. Bronchi and Bronchioles: These are smaller branches that carry air from the trachea into the lungs. 6. Lungs: These are two large organs that perform the gas exchange, allowing oxygen to enter the bloodstream and carbon dioxide to be removed from the bloodstream and exhaled. 7. Alveoli: These are small sacs within the lungs where the actual gas exchange happens.     In the process of respiration, the human body draws in fresh air into the lungs, absorbs oxygen and releases carbon dioxide. It is a critical system for sustaining life because all cells, tissues, and organs in the body require a constant supply of oxygen to generate the energy needed for body functions."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Background: Dev was born Dharam Dev Anand on 26 September 1923 in the Shakargarh tehsil of the Gurdaspur district in Punjab (British India). His father Pishori Lal Anand was a well-to-do advocate in Gurdaspur District Court. Dev was the third of four sons born to Anand. One of Dev's younger sisters is Sheel Kanta Kapur, who is the mother of film director Shekhar Kapur. Context: In the sixties, Dev Anand acquired a romantic image with films such as Manzil and Tere Ghar Ke Samne with Nutan, Kinaare Kinaare with Meena Kumari, Maya with Mala Sinha, Asli-Naqli with Sadhana Shivdasani, Jab Pyar Kisi Se Hota Hai, Mahal with Asha Parekh and Teen Deviyaan opposite three heroines Kalpana, Simi Garewal and Nanda. In the film Teen Deviyaan, Dev Anand played a playboy.  His first colour film, Guide with Waheeda Rehman was based on the novel of the same name by R. K. Narayan. Dev Anand himself was the impetus for making the film version of the book. He met and persuaded Narayan to give his assent to the project. Dev Anand tapped his friends in Hollywood to launch an Indo-US co-production that was shot in Hindi and English simultaneously and was released in 1965. Guide, directed by younger brother Vijay Anand, was an acclaimed movie. Dev played Raju, a voluble guide, who supports Rosy (Waheeda) in her bid for freedom. He is not above thoughtlessly exploiting her for personal gains. Combining style with substance, he gave an affecting performance as a man grappling with his emotions in his passage through love, shame and salvation.  He reunited with Vijay Anand for the movie Jewel Thief, based on the thriller genre which featured Vyjayanthimala, Tanuja, Anju Mahendru, Faryal and Helen and was very successful. Their next collaboration, Johny Mera Naam (1970), again a thriller, in which Dev was paired opposite Hema Malini was a big hit. It was Johnny Mera Naam which made Hema Malini a big star.  In 1969, he was a member of the jury at the 6th Moscow International Film Festival. Question: Did the film do well for him? Answer:","output":"Yes, the film \\"Johny Mera Naam\\" did well for Dev Anand. The film was a big hit and was successful. It was a thriller genre movie, directed by his younger brother Vijay Anand, and featured Hema Malini opposite Dev Anand. The film's success also played a significant role in making Hema Malini a big star."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant. You will be given a task. You must generate a detailed and long answer. Does \\"vegetate\\" mean the same thing in these two sentences? The fields vegetate vigorously. The bacterial growth vegetated along.","output":"The term \\"vegetate\\" does carry a connection in meaning for both sentences, but there are distinctions in how it is used and the specific meanings it conveys in each context. In the first sentence, \\"The fields vegetate vigorously,\\" the term “vegetate” is used to describe the growth and flourishing of plants or crops in the fields. This usage is more aligned with the original definition of vegetate, which involves plant life growing and developing in a healthy manner. In this context, \\"vegetate\\" communicates the idea that the fields are teeming with life, plants are thriving, and there is a sense of strong, robust growth. In the second sentence, \\"The bacterial growth vegetated along,\\" the term \\"vegetate\\" takes on a different nuance of meaning. Here, the word is utilized to describe the growth and expansion of bacterial colonies or populations. Although \\"vegetate\\" still conveys growth, its connection to plant life is less prominent in this sentence, and the emphasis is more on general growth processes. In this context, \\"vegetate\\" primarily indicates that the bacteria are growing, reproducing, and spreading. So while there is an overlap in the basic concept of growth and development in both sentences, the specific meaning and application of \\"vegetate\\" varies depending on the context. In the first sentence, it is about the thriving and flourishing of plant life, whereas in the second, the focus is on the reproduction and expansion of bacterial growth. Overall, the term conveys progression and the propagation of life, but the specifics change with the subject matter."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant. User will you give you a task.

What is the answer??","output":"We want to find the value of p in the equation 0 = 8819*p - 176697 + 1146787. To do this, we follow these steps: Step 1: Combine the constants. Add -176697 and 1146787. 1146787 - 176697 = 970090 Now we have: 0 = 8819*p + 970090 Step 2: Isolate the term with p. To do this, we need to subtract 970090 from both sides of the equation: 0 - 970090 = 8819*p + 970090 - 970090 Which simplifies to: -970090 = 8819*p Step 3: Solve for p. To find the value of p, we need to divide both sides of the equation by 8819. -970090 / 8819 = 8819*p / 8819 This gives us: p = -110 The solution to the equation 0 = 8819*p - 176697 + 1146787 is p = -110."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Kayla made sure to mold the wooden table well for Christine's purchase because","output":"she knew how important this table was to her friend. Christine had been searching for the perfect table for months, ever since she’d moved into her new house. She had an image in her mind of a beautiful, handcrafted wooden table, one that would last for generations and be a centerpiece for family gatherings, get-togethers, and heartfelt conversations with friends. Kayla, a skilled woodworker herself, had always been an advocate of quality craftsmanship and had a deep-rooted passion for creating things with her own two hands. She had spent years honing her skills in order to establish a flourishing business. When Christine reached out to her with her request, Kayla knew it was more than just a simple purchase from a friend; she was providing Christine something meaningful that would connect their friendship and families for years to come. It was her way of showing her love and support, while also demonstrating her incredible artistry. Kayla decided to use high-quality, reclaimed wood for the table, as its inherent warmth and character would only add to its charm. She knew that Christine had a beautiful open kitchen with an industrial-chic design, so a blend of rustic and contemporary styles would be the perfect match. The wood was sourced from an old barn that had been taken down in a nearby town; it immediately caught Kayla’s eye for its natural beauty and history. In order to create a one-of-a-kind piece that would stand the test of time, Kayla began by planning out her design meticulously. She envisioned a long, sturdy table, with an elegantly arched base and thick, solid legs that gave it both stability and an air of majesty. The intricate details and embellishments would be understated yet exquisite, hinting at the great care and thought that went into its creation. As she began to work on the table, Kayla quickly realized that her friend’s timeline for the purchase was fast approaching. Christine was hosting a large family dinner in just a few weeks to celebrate her parents' anniversary. To ensure that the table would be ready in time, Kayla immersed herself in the process, working long hours without rest. She painstakingly sanded, carved, and polished the wood, transforming the reclaimed timber into a stunning piece of furniture. As the table started to take shape, Kayla made sure that each corner and edge was perfectly smoothed out. The table had to have a refined, seamless beauty that would catch the light and create an inviting atmosphere in Christine’s home. Every detail was important, from the precise alignment of the wooden planks, to the masterful joinery techniques Kayla employed. This craftsmanship was both a testament to her friend’s refined taste as well as a showcase of her own skill. In the final days leading up to the deadline, Kayla’s dedication never faltered. Although her hands were calloused and her muscles sore, she quietly reveled in the satisfaction of her labor. The table’s incredible transformation was nearing completion, and she was proud of what she had accomplished. With great care, she applied a rich, natural finish to the wood, sealing and protecting it for years to come. On the morning she was meant to deliver the table, Kayla took a step back and admired her handiwork. She had imbued the table with all her love, care, and skill – and it showed. Knowing that she had created not just an ordinary table, but a cherished heirloom, Kayla smiled and thought of the countless memories that would be shared around it. When the day finally arrived for Christine to receive her new wooden table, Kayla knew she had surpassed her friend’s expectations. As they marveled at the table, it became apparent just how special this piece was – the careful craftsmanship, the warm and sturdy wood, and the love that bound the friends together. Kayla felt proud and grateful for the opportunity to create something so significant for her dear friend, and as laughter and conversation filled Christine’s home that night, the table’s presence was the perfect reminder of their connection and the love that united them."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Given the paragraph above, please answer correctly the following question:   Which student read more about animals carrying out lactic acid fermentation?  Hint: Animals and some bacteria and fungi carry out lactic acid fermentation. Lactic acid is a waste product of this process. Our muscles perform lactic acid fermentation during strenuous exercise, since oxygen cannot be delivered to the muscles quickly enough. The buildup of lactic acid is believed to make your muscles sore after exercise. Bacteria that produce lactic acid are used to make cheese and yogurt. The lactic acid causes the proteins in milk to thicken. Lactic acid also causes tooth decay, because bacteria use the sugars in your mouth for energy. A:","output":"Ned read more about animals carrying out lactic acid fermentation. Steps and justification for the answer: 1. The initial information given states that Ned studied lactic fermentation and Kat studied alcoholic fermentation. 2.

As Opeth's primary songwriter and lyricist, vocalist/guitarist Mikael Åkerfeldt heads the direction of Opeth's sound. He was influenced at a young age by the 1970s progressive rock bands King Crimson, Yes, Genesis, Camel, P.F.M., Hawkwind, and Gracious, and by heavy metal bands such as Iron Maiden, Slayer, Death, Black Sabbath, Deep Purple, Celtic Frost, King Diamond, Morbid Angel, Voivod, and, most importantly, Judas Priest. Åkerfeldt considers Judas Priest's Sad Wings of Destiny (1976) the best metal album of all time, and notes that there was a time when he listened only to Judas Priest. While warming up before Opeth concerts, Åkerfeldt frequently sings \\"Here Come the Tears\\" from Judas Priest's third album Sin After Sin (1977). Åkerfeldt later discovered progressive rock and folk music, both of which had a profound impact on the sound of the band.Opeth's distinct sound mixes death metal with progressive rock. Steve Huey of AllMusic refers to Opeth's \\"epic, progressive death metal style\\". Ryan Ogle of Blabbermouth described Opeth's sound as incorporating \\"the likes of folk, funk, blues, '70s rock, goth and a laundry list of other sonic oddities into their trademark progressive death style.\\" In his review of Opeth's 2001 album Blackwater Park, AllMusic's Eduardo Rivadavia wrote, \\"Tracks start and finish in seemingly arbitrary fashion, usually traversing ample musical terrain, including acoustic guitar and solo piano passages, ambient soundscapes, stoner rock grooves, and Eastern-tinged melodies—any of which are subject to savage punctuations of death metal fury at any given moment.\\" Åkerfeldt commented on the diversity of Opeth's music: I don't see the point of playing in a band and going just one way when you can do everything. It would be impossible for us to play just death metal; that is our roots, but we are now a mishmash of everything, and not purists to any form of music.

Despite belonging to the reputed tech-giant, it frankly does not measure up to the expectations.  Firstly, the app continuously freezes up on my device which is a huge inconvenience. Even though I use a latest model phone, problems persist which can only be traced back to the app's inherently poor optimization. Providing a seamless experience should be a core focus, but is sadly lacking here. Secondly, the number of updates is disproportionately high and yet, the issues remain unresolved. It feels as if the updates are just consuming storage without providing any tangible improvements. The constant need to update suggests weak design and maintenance from the developers' team.

A:","output":"Based on the given information, it remains unclear whether the option \\"cellulose\\" correctly answers the question \\"what sort of molecules are used for absorbing light energy by plants?\\", especially since the statement confirms that complex molecules are involved in the process. To provide a more comprehensive and detailed response, let's first consider the primary function of cellulose in plants. Cellulose is a complex carbohydrate and the main structural component of plant cell walls. While it plays a critical role in maintaining a plant's physical strength and support, cellulose lacks the ability to absorb light energy. Instead, plants primarily use light-absorbing molecules called pigments to fulfill this function. These pigments are responsible for capturing light energy, which is then converted into chemical energy via photosynthesis. Chlorophyll, which gives plants their green color, is the most prominent and essential pigment in this process, although other pigments such as carotenoids (yellow, orange, and red pigments) also contribute to light absorption. Chlorophyll absorbs light in the red and blue parts of the visible light spectrum, and through a series of complex reactions within chloroplasts, converts the absorbed energy into adenosine triphosphate (ATP) and nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide phosphate (NADPH), which are then used to convert carbon dioxide and water into glucose and other organic molecules. These products are vital to the plant, as they provide energy and structural building blocks for further growth and development. In conclusion, while cellulose is an essential component of plant structure, it is not primarily involved in light absorption. Rather, the process relies on pigments such as chlorophyll. Therefore, given the available answer options and presupposing that complex molecules absorb light energy in plants, the correct answer would not be \\"cellulose.\\" Instead, the answer should involve pigments like chlorophyll and carotenoids that are directly responsible for the light absorption and photosynthesis processes in plants."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Marouane Fellaini on Sergio Aguero (42mins) - A clear penalty as the Belgian kicked the Manchester City forward on the Achilles from behind. For  Felliaini to then turn and have a go at  Aguero was disgraceful. There were some suggestions on Twitter that Fellaini spat at Aguero as he lay on the turf. However, it looked like saliva falling from his mouth as he shouted at the striker. Joe Hart approaches","output":"Michael Oliver, intent on preventing any further escalation between the two teams. The Manchester City goalkeeper stands tall and forcefully urges Fellaini to back off. Oliver senses that the situation is escalating and doesn’t hesitate to brandish a yellow card for the Belgian midfielder's reckless challenge and unsporting behavior. The half-time whistle blows, and tensions are high as both teams head to their respective dressing rooms. The managers, knowing the importance of this derby, give impassioned speeches to their players, urging them to remain focused and disciplined on the pitch. As the second half kicks off, both teams return to the field with fierce determination. City, the aggrieved party after the controversial penalty decision, look to make amends and take control of the game. After a series of chances, they finally break through in the 63rd minute. Raheem Sterling jinks his way past a defender and serves an inch-perfect cross for Sergio Aguero, who makes no mistake in putting the ball into the back of the net. The Etihad erupts in celebration, as Manchester City take the lead 1-0. Both teams continue to battle it out, but the intensity of the derby gets the better of them. In the 78th minute, following a dangerous tackle, scuffles break out between several players — a testament to the high stakes and emotions associated with this match. Oliver, having a difficult evening, shows a red card to Manchester United midfielder Ander Herrera for a studs-up challenge on David Silva. Now down to ten men, United's desperation grows. They fight valiantly to find an equalizer, and in the 85th minute, they do just that. A cross from the right wing finds the head of Marcus Rashford, who expertly guides the ball past Joe Hart. The score is now level at 1-1. With the fans on the edge of their seats and the clock ticking down, it seems as though the match could be headed for a draw. However, both teams are determined to find a late winner as extra time approaches. A relentless back-and-forth battle ensues, with neither team willing to relent. Finally, deep into added time, a moment of individual brilliance unfolds. Kevin De Bruyne finds himself with the ball outside the United penalty area. He assesses the situation, takes a calculated touch, and unleashes a curling shot that whistles past the outstretched arms of David de Gea and nestles into the far corner of the net. The Etihad erupts in euphoria once more, as Manchester City takes the lead just as the referee signals for full time. The story ends with Manchester City claiming a dramatic 2-1 victory in a thrilling, hard-fought, and heated derby. The fans are left breathless, as both sets of players slump to the ground in exhaustion. As the dust settles, Manchester City desperately savors their victory, while Manchester United is left to ruminate on a game marred by controversy and heartbreak. Off the pitch, the refereeing decisions lead to heated debates between pundits, journalists, and fans alike. Days later, Michael Oliver's performance remains under the microscope, a forceful reminder of just how heavily the outcome of a match can rest in the hands of one individual.

The equation is: 130*u = -40 - 90 Combine the constant terms -40 and -90: -40 - 90 = -130 The updated equation is: 130*u = -130 Step 2: Solve for u by dividing both sides of the equation by 130. To isolate u, you need to divide both sides of the equation by 130: (130*u) / 130 = -130 / 130 The 130 on the left side of the equation cancels out, leaving: u = -130 / 130 Step 3: Simplify the fraction -130 / 130.

Answer the following question: I'm taking a test and have to guess the right answer to the question after the article. Article: What would you do if you were lost in the dark forest at night? The first sensible lesson is that you shouldn't bother trying to find your way in the dark at all, but just stay put until dawn. Because then you won't trip over things? No, mainly because you'll have an idea of direction. The sun rises in the east. But you will be amazed at how many people forget they know that. Apparently, the area underneath a holly bush provides a good makeshift shelter -- they are thick, and evergreen. The next thing to do -- or rather not to do -- is panic, for the obvious reason that unless there is someone there to hear you scream, it will get you nowhere. Just try to think of nice, happy things. There is always a point in films when a person who is lost in the desert or the snow, dehydrated  and exhausted, comes across a set of their own footprints and realizes they have just walked in a huge, round circle. It is wrong to owe it to the unequal strengths or different lengths of your legs. Experiments prove that, without the sun or the moon (or landmarks) as a fixed guide, lots of small errors add up over time so the brain can't correctly identify the \\"straight ahead\\" direction. To just get out of somewhere, pick a spot on the horizon and just head for it. There are several ways to find directions in the dark, and by far the best is to establish north using the stars. Most people can identify the Plough, which is part of Ursa Major. It looks a lot like a saucepan. The Plough rotates through the sky, but let's imagine the saucepan lying horizontally  , with its handle on the left. You need to trace a line from the star at the right-hand base of the pan, through the star at the right-hand rim  , and follow it upwards; the north star is roughly five times the distance between those two \\"pointer\\" stars. Then drop a vertical line from the North Star to the horizon and that's north. \\"Tonight is very cloudy and I can't see the Plough.\\" Maybe luckily, it is quite windy.

If there is no answer, please output \\"Insufficient information to provide an answer.\\". Movie title: The Exorcist III Context: The film begins with the point of view of someone wandering through the streets of Georgetown, a voice informing us \\"I have dreams... of a rose... and of falling down a long flight of stairs\\". The point of view shows a warning of evil about to arrive later that night at a church. Demonic growls are heard, leaves and other street trash suddenly come flying into the church as a crucifix comes to life. It then cuts to Lieutenant William F. Kinderman (George C. Scott) at a crime scene, where a 12-year-old boy named Thomas Kintry has been murdered.Kinderman takes his friend, a priest named Father Dyer (Ed Flanders), out to see their mutually favorite film It's a Wonderful Life. Kinderman later relates the gruesome details of the murder of the young boy he was investigating that morning, including his crucifixion. Another murder soon takes place; a priest found decapitated in a church. Dyer is shortly hospitalized and found murdered the next day, with the words \\"IT'S A WONDERFULL LIFE\\" written on a wall in Dyer's blood.At each murder scene, the fingerprints at the crime scenes do not match up, indicating a different person was responsible for each. Kinderman tells hospital staff the reason for his unease: fifteen years ago the vicious serial killer, \\"The Gemini\\" (Brad Dourif), was executed; with every victim he cut off the right index finger and carved the Zodiac sign of Gemini into the palm of their left hand. Kinderman noticed the hands of the three new victims and verified that the Gemini's sign has been there. The Gemini Killer also always used an extra \\"L\\" in his notes sent to the media, such as \\"usefull\\" or \\"carefull\\". Furthermore, to filter out false confessions, the original Gemini Killer's true mutilations were kept a secret by the Richmond police's homicide department; the newspapers were made to wrongfully report that the left middle finger was severed and that the Gemini sign was carved on the back of the victim.Kinderman visits the head of the psychiatric ward, Dr. Temple (Scott Wilson), who relates... A:","output":"The Gemini Killer, also known as James Venamun, was able to inhabit the body of a fellow inmate in the psychiatric ward named Patient X, who was revealed to be Damian Karras (Jason Miller), the priest from the original Exorcist film. Karras, having survived being possessed by the demon Pazuzu, had amnesia and was being cared for by Dr. Temple. After The Gemini Killer's execution, his soul was sent to Karras' comatose body by the demonic forces trying to exact their revenge. As James Venamun, The Gemini Killer sought spiritual guidance from his master, Satan himself, while occupying the body of Damian Karras. Upon transferring his soul into the body, the Gemini Killer proceeded to commit a series of horrific murders, mimicking his previous modus operandi and targeting the victims with ties to the Georgetown exorcism and the individuals who participated in it. It should be noted that the Gemini Killer did not inhabit the body of a child in the movie, but rather the body of the adult priest, Damian Karras. There was, however, a child victim mentioned in the film - Thomas Kintry, who was killed by the Gemini Killer. What makes The Exorcist III stand out is the investigative aspect of the story, which focuses on the character of Lieutenant Kinderman unraveling the mystery of the Gemini Killer's resurrection and possessing Damian Karras' body. As Kinderman delves deeper into the case, he comes to confront the Gemini Killer, who confirms that he is responsible for the recent murders and that he has been acting on demonic orders. Eventually, as Kinderman tries to confront the Gemini Killer and save Karras, an exorcism is performed by another priest, Father Paul Morning (Nicol Williamson). During the exorcism, Karras regains his strength and sacrifices himself to save not only Morning but also to vanquish the demon and the Gemini Killer's plans for destruction."},{"instruction":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

(CNN)President Barack Obama may change the United States' plan to withdraw virtually all its troops from Afghanistan by the end of 2016, his new defense secretary said Saturday during a visit to the central Asian nation -- an indication that the White House is considering extending the U.S. troop presence there beyond that year. U.S. Defense Secretary Ashton Carter made the comment in a news conference in Kabul with Afghan President Ashraf Ghani, who has previously called on Obama to \\"re-examine\\" the withdrawal plan to ensure his country has the support it needs to maintain security gains. Carter arrived in Afghanistan's capital on Saturday during his first foreign trip since being sworn in as defense secretary four days ago.

The bilateral security agreement (BSA) came into force after a long period of negotiations and aimed to provide the much-needed security and stabilization to the country grappling with insurgency and terrorism. The agreement established a framework for continued United States' military presence in Afghanistan, which has been essential in supporting and training Afghan security forces while conducting counterterrorism operations. This was a crucial development for the Afghan government and the people of Afghanistan, seeking a steady partnership with the United States in their efforts to build a secure and prosperous nation. Since then, both nations have actively collaborated in strengthening the Afghan National Defense and Security Forces (ANDSF), targeted operations against the Taliban and terrorist groups such as Al-Qaeda and ISIS, and efforts in advancing the peace process. Despite the agreement, the initial plan to withdraw virtually all U.S. troops by the end of 2016 loomed over Afghanistan, creating concerns about the country's security situation and its capacity to maintain hard-won gains against insurgent forces. Therefore, the potential extension of the U.S. troop presence beyond 2016, as indicated by Defense Secretary Ashton Carter, could provide much-needed reassurance to Afghanistan's leadership and its people. In the long run, any decision to extend the U.S.' military commitment in Afghanistan will greatly depend on several factors, such as the ANDSF's ability to effectively counter threats, the country's progress in combating corruption, and its efforts to foster a culture of good governance and democracy. It is essential for Afghanistan and the United States to maintain a strong partnership based on trust, cooperation, and mutual respect, so as to ensure a secure and stable future for the war-torn nation."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Answer the above question based on the context below:  Elvis Aaron Presley (January 8, 1935 – August 16, 1977) was an American singer and actor. Regarded as one of the most significant cultural icons of the 20th century, he is often referred to as the \\"King of Rock and Roll\\" or simply \\"the King\\". Presley was born in Tupelo, Mississippi, and relocated to Memphis, Tennessee, with his family when he was 13 years old. His music career began there in 1954, recording at Sun Records with producer Sam Phillips, who wanted to bring the sound of African-American music to a wider audience. Accompanied by guitarist Scotty Moore and bassist Bill Black, Presley was a pioneer of rockabilly, an uptempo, backbeat-driven fusion of country music and rhythm and blues. In 1955, drummer D. J. Fontana joined to complete the lineup of Presley's classic quartet and RCA Victor acquired his contract in a deal arranged by Colonel Tom Parker, who would manage him for more than two decades. Presley's first RCA single, \\"Heartbreak Hotel\\", was released in January 1956 and became a number-one hit in the United States. With a series of successful network television appearances and chart-topping records, he became the leading figure of the newly popular sound of rock and roll. His energized interpretations of songs and sexually provocative performance style, combined with a singularly potent mix of influences across color lines during a transformative era in race relations, made him enormously popular—and controversial. In November 1956, Presley made his film debut in Love Me Tender. Drafted into military service in 1958, Presley relaunched his recording career two years later with some of his most commercially successful work. He held few concerts however, and guided by Parker, proceeded to devote much of the 1960s to making Hollywood films and soundtrack albums, most of them critically derided. In 1968, following a seven-year break from live performances, he returned to the stage in the acclaimed television comeback special Elvis, which led to an extended Las Vegas concert residency and a string...

Daryl Rasmussen, 58, pleaded guilty Friday to counts of second-degree murder. Rasmussen was sentenced to 30 years in prison, and 13 other charges against him – including first-degree murder - were dismissed. Scroll down for video. Guilty: Daryl Rasmussen, 58, known as Ms Puppy, was sentenced to 30 years in prison as part of a plea deal in the double murder of a gay couple. According to prosecutors, Rasmussen bludgeoned to death Ronald Ford, 63, and his long-time boyfriend, 56-year-old Ramiro 'Rome' Sanchez, in their Denver home in late January 2011. The cross-dresser also stole the slain couple's 1997 Dodge Caravan and used their credit cards and identifies. The victims’ bodies were discovered a week apart in mid-February. Both are survived by a number of grown children. Rasmussen, aka Ms Puppy, had been homeless when the Denver couple hired him in 2010 to be a housekeeper and caregiver to Sanchez, who was disabled. Sanchez and Ford were killed in their home in the 120 block of Stuart Street in Denver with blows to the head, according to court documents. Ingrate: Rasmussen (left), who had been homeless, was hired by the couple in 2010 as a housekeeper and a caregiver to Ramiro Sanchez, 56 (right), who was disabled. Gruesome discoveries: Ronald Ford's body was found inside the couple's Denver home February 11, 2011, and Sanchez was discovered a week later hidden in the basement. Ford's body was found inside the house February 11. Sanchez was discovered a week later hidden in the basement under a pile of bags. Before Sanchez was found dead, it had been suggested that he and Rasmussen may have run away together. Speaking to The Denver Channel in February 2011, Heidi Coleman, one of Ford's four children, said that it was a relief to know that her father's partner of 18 years did not play a part in his murder. Denver Post reported that Daryl Rasmussen fled after the murders but was arrested six months later in Palm Springs, California, after a patron in a local bar overheard him introduce himself as Ms Puppy. In court Friday, Daryl Rasmussen spoke very little, only saying he was sorry for what happened, CBS Denver reported. Here is a summary of the highlights for this article:","output":"A man named Daryl Rasmussen, who dressed like a woman and was called Ms. Puppy, admitted to hurting and causing the death of a couple in Denver. He used to work for them as a housekeeper and caregiver. After the incident, he took their car and used their credit cards. He ran away, but eventually, he was found and arrested.

Tammy wound up in the hospital and was diagnosed with a serious brain injury. Rob suffered only a mild concussion.  Which person had a greater chance of suffering permanent brain damage?  Hint: A person with a serious brain injury usually suffers permanent brain damage. These brain injuries usually occur when an external mechanical force, such as a violent blow or jolt to the head or body, causes brain dysfunction. An object penetrating the skull, such as a bullet or a shattered piece of the skull, also can cause traumatic brain injury. As a result, the person may have trouble talking or controlling body movements. Symptoms depend on what part of the brain was injured. Serious brain injuries can also cause personality changes and problems with mental abilities such as memory. Medicines, counseling, and other treatments may help people with serious brain injuries recover from, or at least learn to cope with, their disabilities. A:","output":"Based on the information provided, Tammy has a greater chance of suffering permanent brain damage.

This work is an imaginative and fanciful account of British kings from the legendary Trojan exile Brutus to the 7th-century Welsh king Cadwallader. Geoffrey places Arthur in the same post-Roman period as do Historia Brittonum and Annales Cambriae. He incorporates Arthur's father Uther Pendragon, his magician advisor Merlin, and the story of Arthur's conception, in which Uther, disguised as his enemy Gorlois by Merlin's magic, sleeps with Gorlois's wife Igerna (Igraine) at Tintagel, and she conceives Arthur. On Uther's death, the fifteen-year-old Arthur succeeds him as King of Britain and fights a series of battles, similar to those in the Historia Brittonum, culminating in the Battle of Bath. He then defeats the Picts and Scots before creating an Arthurian empire through his conquests of Ireland, Iceland and the Orkney Islands. After twelve years of peace, Arthur sets out to expand his empire once more, taking control of Norway, Denmark and Gaul. Gaul is still held by the Roman Empire when it is conquered, and Arthur's victory leads to a further confrontation with Rome. Arthur and his warriors, including Kaius (Kay), Beduerus (Bedivere) and Gualguanus (Gawain), defeat the Roman emperor Lucius Tiberius in Gaul but, as he prepares to march on Rome, Arthur hears that his nephew Modredus (Mordred)—whom he had left in charge of Britain—has married his wife Guenhuuara (Guinevere) and seized the throne.

Okay, okay, the transparent TV was neat, but will it actually change the way we watch television? Not likely -- not any time soon, at least. And while the mind-controlled set we saw last year was certainly cool, it didn't offer much in the way of accuracy. This Eye-Control TV, on the other hand, certainly takes a step in the right direction. To use the set, you sit in front of a black rectangular sensor positioned at chest height. There's some calibration involved when moving from person to person, chasing a circle around the screen with your eyes. Once calibrated, you're good to go.      You use your eyes for basic TV controls -- changing channels, adjusting the volume, things like that. Switching involves looking at an element of the screen and giving a big blink to select -- the display seems adjusted in such a way that normal blinks won't trigger it, so you're less likely to accidentally set something off. You look down to adjust the volume. A control panel will show up, and from there, you can move the slider left or right by looking at the volume up and volume down icons -- you can also select mute from here.      To change channels, look at the top left-hand corner of the screen and blink. That'll bring up a UI featuring large pictures of videos. Look at one and blink at it to select it. The system can also be used to view and toggle between still images. The use of pictures certainly seems the most intuitive method for navigating around videos -- there's a definite learning curve here, and it's hard enough to select pictures -- we couldn't really imagine toggling through small text. As with the transparent television, this doesn't feel quite ready for market -- it's a compelling concept, none the less. And using the human eye to control a display that you're already staring at anyway does seem to have some merits. Check out an eyes-on video, after the jump. %Gallery-163806% ||||| Blink and you'll miss it: Eye-control TV arrives which lets couch potatoes change the channel without lifting a finger            Couch potatoes just found another excuse not to get off the sofa - a TV which can monitor your eyes and change the channel if you give it the nod.      The Eye Control TV, by Chinese manufacturer Haier, comes with an admittedly bulky device that you place in front of your TV, and with a determined blink of your eyes you can change channels, change the volume, or power your television off.      The eye-sensing technology relies on a Kinect-style sensor sat on your table, and Haier says your standard blinks will not interrupt your scheduled viewing.      Scroll down for video      No more lost remotes: The prototype sensor sits in front of the television, responding to blinks from the couch potato      Blinks can bring up a menu bar, with a slide of your head allowing you to adjust the volume      The sensor sits in front of you and needs calibration the first time you run it, which involves chasing a circle around the screen with your eyes.      After that, long blinks activate the sensor, bringing up an on-screen display. Looking downwards brings up the volume controls, which you can then adjust by looking at the plus and minus signs.      Meanwhile, other menus allow you to switch channels and glide between still images.      Engadget tested the equipment at the IFA technology conference in Berlin this week and called it a 'compelling concept', although not quite ready for market, partly for the slight learning curve and the coffee-table-dominating sensor.      The sensor is not likely to improve the appearance of your coffee table, but it might make a good talking point ... unless there's something worth watching instead      New ways of controlling the TV are beginning to overtake the old infra-red remotes that currently dominate the coffee table.      Many TVs are not 'Smart-enabled', meaning they have in-built Freeview and Apps which can allow streaming from services such as Sky TV.      A range of accessories also allow you to control your television from a smartphone.      For those of a more active disposition, a Doctor Who-themed 'Sonic Screwdriver' TV remote is released this weekend, allowing you to gesticulate wildly at the television in the style of your favourite Doctor. ||||| Write a summary.","output":"Chinese manufacturer Haier has introduced an Eye-Control TV that allows users to switch channels, adjust volume, and power the television off with their eyes.

Choosing in-season fruits and vegetables, local produce, less meat and foods that are grown with fewer pesticides can make your impact on the Earth a bit lighter. Keeping track of all the information you need to make the right choices can be a bit overwhelming, but these seven mobile apps store all you need to know in your pocket. Be sure to let us know in the comments which apps you found most helpful or what you plan to do start eating environmentally friendly. Nobody wants to destroy ecosystems when they go out for sushi, but trying to factor in where each species of fish was caught, what region it comes from, or how it was farmed can seem like a full-time job when picking where to eat. The people who do, in fact, dedicate themselves to full-time study of the planet’s water systems have mercifully created an iPhone app and mobile site to provide a guide for your seafood decisions. Search fish by name for the best choice (salmon, for instance, should be wild-caught in Alaska), good alternatives (wild-caught in Washington), and what to avoid (farmed, Atlantic-caught or wild-caught in California), and reference a best practice guide for your region. On Tuesday, the aquarium also added a new “Project FishMap” component to the app that helps you share restaurants and markets you’ve found that sell sustainable seafood. Eventually, the crowdsourced map will be a resource for finding ocean-friendly seafood wherever you are. The modern-day grocery store has created a problem that would have been absurd to our ancestors. With produce being shipped from all over the world, it’s difficult to tell what is actually in season near you. Locavore (2.99) tells you what is currently in season in your region so that you can make purchasing decisions that reduce your carbon footprint. It also provides recipes that use all in-season ingredients and shows you nearby farmers markets where you can buy those ingredients. If you connect the app to your FacebookFacebook account, you can share where you came across especially stellar local produce and read what other people near you have discovered. The jury is still out on the health and environmental impact of genetically modified food like the “botox apple,” but genetically modified (GMO) foods still go unlabeled and are difficult to avoid. The Center for Food Safety, which runs campaigns to halt the approval of GMO foods, has iPhoneiPhone and AndroidAndroid apps that help shoppers identify genetically modified food. The app gives the low-down on the approval statuses of GMO items in major food groups and highlights tips for avoiding GMO foods in general. As the title indicates, this app from the Pesticide Action Network helps you figure out what pesticides are on your food before you buy it. According to the app, an apple has a potential 42 residues, for instance. The app comes with a helpful chart if you want to know which ones are neurotoxins, hormone disruptors, carcinogens, or developmental or reproductive toxins. Though by that point, you might already be standing in the organic section. Like the Locavore app, Seasons (1.99) helps consumers buy products that are in-season in their region. In addition to fruits and vegetables, it also keeps track of herbs, nuts and mushrooms broken down by whether they’re in-season, at the start of their season, at the end of their season or produced year-round in your area. Each food includes a graph that shows both import and local seasons. Because many consumers prefer environmentally conscious options when available, companies are eager to label their products as such. In some cases, however, the labels are more indicative of greenwashing than of reduced environmental impact. Shoppers can use Label Lookup to understand what 169 different green labels mean and how reliable they are. “GMO-Free,” for instance, is too vague to be reliable. “American Grassfed,” however, is thirdy-party verified and meets detailed standards. Whether or not you’re a vegetarian, reducing the amount of meat that you eat can reduce the impact your diet has on the environment. And it doesn’t need to be painful; you can easily find great vegan, vegetarian and vegetarian-friendly restaurants using mobile app VegOut (2.99). The app is powered by happycow.net, a vegetarian-friendly restaurant search engine with more than 13,000 listings around the world. It uses your location to show you the restaurants nearest you, but you can also search by zipcode if you’re planning to dine elsewhere. - 10 Free iPhone Apps to Help You Go Green for Earth Day - 10 Great iPhone Apps for Growing a Garden - 6 Essential Android Apps for Business Travel - 5 Excellent E-Card iPhone Apps - 10 Mobile Apps for Movie Addicts Image courtesy of iStockphotoiStockphoto, Jasmina007 What is a short summary of the above article?","output":"This article talks about 7 mobile apps that can help you make environmentally friendly eating choices.

Article: Though there are about 400 languages from all over the world that are in danger of disappearing completely, Zoque-Ayapaneco, a native Mexican language is considered the most likely to become extinct, because the only two people in the world that speak it fluently do not talk to each other! And, it's not because they live in different countries, states or even villages. In fact, Manuel Segovia and Isidro Velazquez, both in their 70s, live within 500 yards of each other, in the village of Ayapa in the Southern Mexican State of Tabasco. They, however, refuse to communicate because they simply don't have much in common. Segovia is apparently a little flank in nature while Velazquez is described as shy. Segovia was at least able to talk in Zoque-Ayapanece with his brother until he passed away about 12 years ago, and still manages to practice it with his family, especially his son Manuel, who for the last five years has been trying to learn it and hopes to become fluent enough to teach it to the next generation. Velazquez on the other hand, has not been heard speaking in the language with anybody. The two men say the language used to be widely spoken in the village, but the younger generation _ it for fear of being laughed at, and it therefore began to die a slow death, as the elders passed away. Unless the two men get their acts together, the only way to hear the language will be to either listen to Manuel's not-so-fluent statement or see them talk in a documentary entitled \\"Lengua Muerta\\" (Dead Language) that is being filmed to capture Zoque Ayapaneco and 364 other native Mexican languages that are in a similar state. We sure hope Segovia and Velazquez soon find something common to talk about. Maybe the fact is that the language is dying and that they should start encouraging and teaching the next generation together.

Article: All living things on the earth need other living things to live. Nothing lives alone. Most animals must live in a group, and even a plant grows close together with others of the same kind. Sometimes one living thing kills another, one eats and the other is eaten. Each kind of life eats another kind of life in order to live, and together they create a food chain  . Some food chains are simple, while others are not. But all food chains begin with the sun, and all food chains become broken up if one of the links   disappears. All life needs sunlight to live on. But only plants can use sunlight directly. Plants are 'factories'. They make food from sunlight, water and things in the soil   and air. Plants feed all other living things. Animals can only use the sun's energy after it has been changed into food by plants. Some animals feed directly on plants, others eat smaller animals. Meat-eating animals are only eating plants indirectly. What about humans? We are members of many food chains. We eat rice, vegetables, and fruits and so on. We also eat meat and drink milk. But we often break up the food chains. We kill wild animals and also make rivers, lakes and seas polluted. When these rivers, lakes and seas are polluted, the fish in them can not be eaten.

Math Problem Solve -2271*x + 88004 = -6151*x - 51457 - 70059 for x.","output":"Okay little buddy, let's solve this math problem together, step by step! We have the equation: -2271 * x + 88004 = -6151 * x - 51457 - 70059 First, let's combine the numbers on the right side of the equation (the -51457 and -70059). When you subtract 51457 and then subtract 70059 more, you get: -51457 - 70059 = -121516 Now our equation looks like this: -2271 * x + 88004 = -6151 * x - 121516 Next, we want to move the -6151 * x to the left side so that all the \\"x\\" terms are on one side. To do that, we'll add 6151 * x to both sides of the equation. So, -2271 * x + 6151 * x + 88004 = -121516 Combining the x terms on the left side, we get: 3880 * x + 88004 = -121516 Now, we need to get the \\"x\\" term all by itself. We'll start by getting rid of the 88004 on the left side. To do this, we'll subtract 88004 from both sides of the equation: 3880 * x = -121516 - 88004 Subtracting 88004 from -121516, we get:  -121516 - 88004 = -209520 Now our equation is:  3880 * x = -209520 Last step! We need to find out what number x is. To do that, let's divide both sides of the equation by 3880: x = -209520 / 3880 Doing the division, we find out that: x = -54 So the answer to the problem is x = -54.

Think like you are answering to a five year old. Here is a news article: When the news flitted across my screen that Alaskan newscaster Charlo Greene quit her job by saying “fuck it” on live TV, I winced in recognition. As someone who’s quit in a flamboyant way – and then compounded the drama by writing about quitting in both memoir and in fiction – I’ve spent a lot of time thinking: what might drive someone to that moment? Is it ever the right thing to do?            The logical answer to the latter question seems pretty obvious: probably not. Not only did Greene hang all her co-workers out to dry, forcing them to scramble to cover for her as she got her moment of satisfaction, but she’s also marked herself as a loose cannon. She’s now someone who, in the most fundamental way, can’t be trusted as a teammate. It’s fun to quit, certainly, but would you ever want to be the next person to hire a quitter?      On the other hand, sometimes quitting is the only appropriate response: when an employer’s in the wrong, say, or when you have a valid point to make and you need to make it in a very public way. Other times, it’s the right thing to do for more complicated reasons. Quitting can show coworkers or colleagues who don’t quite have the gumption to get out of obviously bad situations that it can be done; it can inspire others to have the courage to change their lot, maybe in less brazen, more incremental ways.      Maybe that’s why we’re so fascinated by people who say “fuck it”: they speak to the tiny part of all of us that wishes we could say be so honest and so irresponsible in any number of situations, any number of times a day. But refusing to give in to those impulses is what keeps society functioning, and what makes us – as individuals – adults.      In 2007, I quit my job at Gawker – which was then a New York-specific media gossip site – by essentially saying “fuck it”. I said it far less succinctly than Greene did, though, in a long, digressive blog post in which I echoed concerns raised by a piece that had recently run in the magazine n+1: that Gawker, once a useful gadfly that irritated the powerful, had become a bully more powerful than the institutions it mocked. I then compounded the faux pas of quitting that way by running my mouth off to anyone who asked: media reporters whose work I’d been in the business of shredding were only too willing to mock my hasty, immature decision.      (It’s taken my former boss, the site co-founder Nick Denton, many years to forgive me – though, actually, I’m still not quite sure he has. But then, I’ve also never quite apologized, and I’m not exactly apologizing now.)      Looking back, it’s easy for me to view my fuck-it moment as a rookie mistake – the kind of thing only a 26-year-old who doesn’t understand that actions have consequences would do. I wanted to make a big ideological point, and I had but one weapon in my arsenal: a pulpit that I could use to denounce the very thing that had given me a voice.      Unfortunately, I lost that weapon as soon as I used it, like a bee that dies in the act of stinging. I don’t know that I would have quit if I’d understood then how much it would deform the next few years of my life. I succeeded on my own terms as a freelancer and an author, but I also failed to secure any of the steady, full-time, paycheck-y gigs that every writer (save maybe Edward St Aubyn) needs. The reason? Well, if I had to guess, it was that no one was quite prepared to trust me.            It took years before I worked another full-time job.      I hope that Charlo Greene is enjoying her new, more self-determined career path, and that she isn’t listening to the people who are questioning her decision, after her on-air performance inevitably went as viral as it did on Monday.            We don’t know exactly what Greene’s workplace was like, or the other choices that were available to her. We can guess at her motivations, but it’s probably good to recognize that we’re inevitably projecting our own workplace neuroses onto someone we really don’t know much about at all. Hopefully, she’s listening to the people who find her inspiring and liberating, and not to the people who put her down for being “unprofessional”.      The satisfaction of quitting is real, but it’s fleeting. More lasting satisfaction comes from slowly, painstakingly creating a career path that lets you be true to yourself, whether you’re a pot-loving activist or a writer with various axes to grind. But I also hope that she’ll find her way, as I’ve tried to do, towards a different kind of future – one where she gets the kind of work that doesn’t make her want to say “fuck it” every day. Because we all want to say it; we just shouldn’t have to. ||||| Early in the evening of the day I became Facebook friends with James Frey, Choire and I found ourselves standing on Chrystie Street, unloading boxes of n+1's Winter 2008 issue (\\"Mainstream\\") from a very large Budget rental truck. We did this in a fit of perversity. n+1 editor Keith Gessen had driven the truck from the Ingram warehouse in Pennsylvania earlier in the day, accompanied by an n+1 intern that he'd been \\"mentoring.\\" There were six pallets. As usual, the issue's contributors had been invited to the box-unloading party, and so we staggered, box-laden, past the likes of little Ben Kunkel, wearing his noticeably-heeled boots even for this athletic activity. Probably more people came later for the beer-drinking part of the evening. But we missed that part because, when the truck was fully unloaded, we hopped into it with Keith to return it to the Budget lot in Brooklyn. On the way there, Keith turned up a narrow street and smashed a taillight and a bit of the back end of a minivan that would turn out to belong to an Orthodox Jewish lawyer.      Keith handled himself remarkably well in this crisis, though he did later blame the accident on me: \\"You make me nervous,\\" he said, his voice getting high-pitched and muppety for a second.      At the time of the accident we'd been talking about Keith's book \\"All The Sad Young Literary Men,\\" which Viking will publish in April. Jonathan Franzen had said that reading Keith's book made him wish to be a young man again. And last night, Choire quoted a friend of his who's reading a galley of the book as saying that the book was a cautionary tale. [The friend had written: \\"I just started reading Keith Gessen's novel — irritating of course, it's the n+1 world, where women are mere accessories, but not bad! But SUCH a cautionary tale.... To me it's screaming *Get out of NY before it's too late*!!! Or, shrink your life in NY... stop going to all those lame competitive parties. Look, I always liked Sloane Crosley too, but when the fact that she is *nice* is the subject of an Observer article, that is a culture in deep, deep decline.\\"]      Keith didn't understand how the book could be a cautionary tale.      Not having read the book, it's impossible to say with any certainty whether it would make me want to be a young man or whether it would make me want to leave New York.      While Keith was writing a note for the minivan's owner, I had time to flip through n+1 issue 8. In it, Wesley Yang writes about Virginia Tech shooter Seung-Hui Cho, and of other \\"essentially unlovable\\" people, including himself:      Jasper once told me that I was \\"essentially unloveable.\\" I've always held that observation close to my heart, turning to it often. It's true of some people—that there's no reason anyone should love or care about them, because they aren't appealing on the outside, and that once you dig into the real person beneath the shell (if, for some obscure if not actively perverse reason, you bother), you find the real inner ugliness.      Identifying with a serial killer is uncomfortable, maybe as uncomfortable as identifying with the pretty girls who rejected his advances. The essay puts its reader in both roles. Wesley's refusal to shy away from the kind of \\"rude question\\" that \\"affects to inquire into what everyone gets to know at the cost of forever leaving it unspoken\\" makes 'The Face of Seung-Hui Cho' an exercise in revolutionary honesty.      In the Budget truck, I also had time to read most of Carla Blumenkranz's review, 'In Search of Gawker.' Carla went back into the Gawker archives to trace the site's evolution from Elizabeth Spiers' first post in 2002 to the decadent Gawker of today. \\"Reading through the early Gawker archives means watching Spiers receive and record her New York education,\\" Carla writes, also observing that \\"her persona was part of her appeal,\\" while the site's next editor Choire Sicha's appeal was that he was \\"almost impersonally sharp and cruel and correct.\\"      \\"Sicha's persona did not change much during his time at Gawker, but he did reveal himself to be invested, in a strange way, in the integrity of Gawker as an institution,\\" Carla goes on to say. It's hard not to be invested in the integrity of an institution that you are, to some extent, the public face of. Yes, also it's just a job, it's just a business. Right now, it's a business that is fairly hell-bent on increasing pageviews in light of the allegedly coming internet advertising downturn—whether that means that content is a tertiary concern after pageview-boosting commenter-friending features and sponsored contests. And still when you work here, Gawker is, to some extent, you. Carla also wrote:      No one ever said Nick Denton was an altruist. But it's important to note that Gawker Media was designed to compete with the corporations that Gawker abused from the sidelines, because this is what created the dissonance of the site's later years....It was the writers, from Elizabeth Spiers to Emily Gould, who sold Denton's cynical project to his cynical audience, on the strength of their authentic interest in the material....      The old (and also accurately self-parodied) idea of Gawker as a necessary corrective to the reams of fawning, vapid, toothless celebrity profiles and trend pieces published every day has faded also as many of the media outlets Gawker used to mock have adopted its jaded style, if not its substance.      \\"The status of Gawker rose as the overall status of its subjects declined, and it was this that made Gawker appear at times a reprehensible bully,\\" she wrote.      And finally:      In early 2007, Choire Sicha—the outsider, the non-careerist, the one who had known restraint, whose parody of journalism had retained some memory of journalism's ethics—returned from the Observer to save Gawker. But it was too late.      That is, at least, overblown. Didn't he do it for the money, actually? Yes. Yes he did.      Keith finished his note to the minivan-owner and, with Choire behind the truck waving his arms in an impersonation of usefulness, backed the truck out of the too-narrow street.      Later Keith asked me what I thought about Carla's essay and I said that I didn't really think she was wrong about anything, except that Jessica Coen had not \\"grown up in Los Angeles.\\" By then we were standing high on the F train elevated platform at Smith and 9th Streets. The Statue of Liberty looked like a little dashboard adornment beyond the B.Q.E.      I took a phone call and when I got back, Choire had told Keith he was quitting Gawker.      \\"Yup, we're quitting!\\" I said.      \\"Because of this?\\" Keith asked.      \\"Sort of. Well, not because it was written. But because it's not untrue.\\" ||||| A summary of this is?","output":"This news article talks about a lady named Charlo Greene, who used to be a news person on TV.

Birds' feeding strategies vary by species. Many birds glean for insects, invertebrates, fruit, or seeds. Some hunt insects by suddenly attacking from a branch. Those species that seek pest insects are considered beneficial 'biological control agents' and their presence encouraged in biological pest control programs. Nectar feeders such as hummingbirds, sunbirds, lories, and lorikeets amongst others have specially adapted brushy tongues and in many cases bills designed to fit co-adapted flowers. Kiwis and shorebirds with long bills probe for invertebrates; shorebirds' varied bill lengths and feeding methods result in the separation of ecological niches. Loons, diving ducks, penguins and auks pursue their prey underwater, using their wings or feet for propulsion, while aerial predators such as sulids, kingfishers and terns plunge dive after their prey. Flamingos, three species of prion, and some ducks are filter feeders. Geese and dabbling ducks are primarily grazers.\\"?

What might be the first step of the process? A:","output":"A: The first step of the process is known as Inhalation or Breathing In. Here is a detailed explanation of the entire process: 1. Inhalation (Breathing In):  This is the first step in the process of respiration. Inhalation occurs when we take in fresh air containing oxygen from the environment into our body. It starts with the diaphragm muscle (located below the lungs) and the intercostal muscles (located between the ribs) contracting, which results in the expansion of the chest cavity and a decrease in pressure. This pressure difference causes air to move into the lungs through the nose or mouth, passing through the pharynx and larynx. 2. Air travels down the trachea: Once the air enters the respiratory system, it travels down the trachea (windpipe) which is a tube that connects the upper respiratory system to the lower respiratory system. The trachea is lined with mucus and tiny hair-like structures called cilia that help filter out dust, bacteria, and other unwanted particles. 3. Air goes down the bronchi and bronchioles: The trachea splits into two main branches known as the left and right bronchi, which further divide into smaller tubes called bronchioles. These bronchioles continue to branch and become smaller until they finally end in tiny air sacs called alveoli. 4. Gas exchange in the alveoli: Inside the alveoli, oxygen from the inhaled air diffuses through the thin walls of the alveoli and capillaries and enters the red blood cells in the bloodstream. Simultaneously, carbon dioxide (a waste product of cellular respiration) diffuses from the bloodstream into the alveoli. 5. Oxygen transport by the circulatory system: The oxygenated blood is then transported by the red blood cells throughout the body via the circulatory system. It reaches cells and tissues where the oxygen is used for cellular respiration – a process that generates energy for the cells to function. 6. Exhalation (Breathing Out): After the oxygen is used by the cells, the carbon dioxide produced as a waste product needs to be removed from the body. The carbon dioxide-rich blood returns to the lungs, where it releases the carbon dioxide into the alveoli. The diaphragm and intercostal muscles relax, which in turn causes the chest cavity to shrink and increase the pressure inside the lungs. This pressure difference forces the air containing the carbon dioxide to be expelled from the body through the mouth or nose during exhalation. In summary, the first step of the process is inhalation, where fresh air containing oxygen is taken in from the environment. This is followed by the air traveling through the respiratory system, gas exchange occurring in the alveoli, and oxygen being transported to the cells. Finally, the process ends with exhalation, where carbon dioxide is expelled from the body."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant. You will be given a task.

Can you imagine a world without the Internet?It's surprising to think about it Now,China has more than 162 million Internet users,according to the China Internet Network Information Center. This is the second highest number of user in the world after the United States. Today,66% of Chinese \\"netizens \\"are teenagers. \\"They spend about thirteen hours every week online,\\"said Qian Hulin,an Internet expert . Doctor Song in Beijing Xuanwu Hospital said about 14% of Chinese netizens who are teens often lasted over ten hours to play online games. The main reasons why teenagers surf the Web are to search for information,to communicate with others and to have fun. On the Internet,teenagers can find out almost everything. And surfing the Web can help students with their homework and widen their knowledge.

B) Going to see them. C) Writing a letter to them. D) Sending emails to them. Answer:","output":"D) Sending emails to them. In a world without the Internet, the way we communicate, find information, and entertain ourselves would be vastly different. Before the advent of the Internet, people relied on traditional means of communication such as face-to-face conversations, phone calls, and handwritten letters to stay in touch with friends and family. The exchange of information was much slower and less convenient compared to today's digital age. Considering the statistics provided on China's Internet users, it is clear that a significant portion of the population relies on the World Wide Web for various activities. Today’s generation of Chinese teenagers, who are actively using the Internet, spends an average of thirteen hours a week online. This clearly shows the role the Internet plays in their lives, allowing them to search for information, communicate with others, and have fun. Dr. Song's observation of teenagers spending more than ten hours playing online games highlights the Internet's function as an entertainment platform. Moreover, the benefits of the Internet also extend to educational arenas. Teacher Li Dong's statement about how students who surf the Net have more background knowledge indicates that the Internet can be an invaluable learning tool. In addition to its educational benefits, the Internet also enables cheap and quick communication with friends far away. Among the various ways to stay in touch with friends, such as making a phone call, visiting in person, or writing a letter, sending emails stands out as the most cost-effective and efficient method. This virtual form of communication not only saves time and money on phone bills and postage stamps but also provides instantaneous connections allowing users to send and receive messages almost instantly. In conclusion, if we were to imagine a world without the Internet, our communication would be slower, and the process of obtaining information would be much less efficient. The traditional ways of staying in touch with friends and learning about them, like phone calls or writing letters, are more time-consuming and expensive than sending emails. Therefore, in a world with the Internet, sending emails is the cheapest and quickest way to learn about friends far away."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant. You will be given a task.

And the answer is...","output":"To solve the equation -139*u + 142*u = -15 for the variable u, follow the steps below: Step 1: Combine the like terms on the left side of the equation. The left side of the equation has two terms with the variable u: -139*u and 142*u. -139*u + 142*u = (142 - 139)*u = 3*u Now the equation is: 3*u = -15 Step 2: Solve for u by isolating the variable. To isolate u, we need to get rid of the coefficient (3) that is multiplying the variable. To do this, we can divide both sides of the equation by 3. (3*u) / 3 = (-15) / 3 The left side simplifies to u since (3*u) / 3 = u: u = -15 / 3 Step 3: Simplify the right side of the equation.

Given the below context:  On hearing that her husband, the Emperor Claudius, has died in a storm at sea, Agrippina plots to secure the throne for Nero, her son by a previous marriage. Nero is unenthusiastic about this project, but consents to his mother's wishes (\\"Con saggio tuo consiglio\\"). Agrippina obtains the support of her two freedmen, Pallas and Narcissus, who hail Nero as the new Emperor before the Senate. With the Senate's assent, Agrippina and Nero begin to ascend the throne, but the ceremony is interrupted by the entrance of Claudius's servant Lesbus. He announces that his master is alive (\\"Allegrezza! Claudio giunge!\\"), saved from death by Otho, the commander of the army. Otho himself confirms this and reveals that Claudius has promised him the throne as a mark of gratitude. Agrippina is frustrated, until Otho secretly confides to her that he loves the beautiful Poppaea more than he desires the throne. Agrippina, aware that Claudius also loves Poppaea, sees a new opportunity of furthering her ambitions for Nero. She goes to Poppaea and tells her, falsely, that Otho has struck a bargain with Claudius whereby he, Otho, gains the throne but gives Poppaea to Claudius. Agrippina advises Poppaea to turn the tables on Otho by telling the Emperor that Otho has ordered her to refuse Claudius's attentions. This, Agrippina believes, will make Claudius revoke his promise to Otho of the throne. Poppaea believes Agrippina. When Claudius arrives at Poppaea's house she denounces what she believes is Otho's treachery. Claudius departs in fury, while Agrippina cynically consoles Poppaea by declaring that their friendship will never be broken by deceit (\\"Non ho cor che per amarti\\").  Guess a valid title for it!","output":"A fitting title for this story would be \\"Agrippina's Machinations: A Tale of Deceit and Ambition.\\" This title effectively captures the central theme of the story, which revolves around the manipulative and cunning nature of Agrippina.

Since no options were provided, I will evaluate two common ingredients: baby-safe soap and an essential oil. Option 1: Baby-safe soap Step 1: Assess the purpose of adding baby-safe soap to reusable baby wipes - Baby-safe soap is gentle on a baby's sensitive skin while providing a cleaning effect. - It helps remove dirt, grime, and any remnants on the baby's skin. Step 2: Evaluate safety concerns - Baby-safe soap is specially formulated with a mild balance of ingredients to make sure it doesn't cause any issues for the baby's skin. - It is typically free from harsh chemicals and fragrances, reducing the risk of irritation. Step 3: Consider the convenience - Baby-safe soap is readily available in stores and can be easily mixed with water. Option 2: Essential oil Step 1: Assess the purpose of adding essential oil to reusable baby wipes - Essential oils can provide a pleasant smell and have some known antibacterial properties. - However, not all essential oils are safe for use on baby's skin. Step 2: Evaluate safety concerns - Some essential oils can cause skin irritation or allergic reactions in babies, even when diluted. - It is important to research and choose baby-safe oils and dilute them properly before adding them to the baby wipes. Step 3: Consider the convenience - Essential oils need to be used with caution, and care must be taken to acquire baby-safe oils and understand the proper dilution ratios. After evaluating both options: Option 1: Baby-safe soap appears to be the better solution because it is designed specifically for a baby's sensitive skin, provides a cleaning effect, and is readily available. Option 2: Essential oil might be a good addition for its scent and antibacterial properties; however, it requires more caution and research to ensure proper use and safety for the baby.  In conclusion, adding baby-safe soap to your reusable baby wipes is a safer and more convenient solution to achieve your goal of providing a gentle cleaning effect for your baby's skin."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Question: Found the following article online, use it to answer the question: What part of the church did Nikolova consider unsuitable for the baptism?  The rectangular narthex constitutes the middle part of the building, between the atrium and the cella, and serves as the lobby of the church. It lies directly east of the atrium, through a wide gate flanked by a couple of high circular turrets. Mavrodinov likens the narthex of the Round Church to similar structures in the churches of Mount Athos, because of its depth.Together with the north and south wall, the entrance of the narthex effectively isolates two smaller parts of the atrium, similar in plan and accessible through doors. The north part includes a small necropolis, while the south part was probably a baptistery, as it features a square installation with a clay pipe that resembles a baptismal font. However, Nikolova considers its shape much too unusual and its depth unsuitable for baptism, and believes it may instead have been designed as a vessel for dispensing holy water.Measuring 5 m × 9.50 m (16.4 ft × 31.2 ft), the narthex is the part of the Round Church which has survived in best shape, as some of its walls reach 3 m (9.8 ft). Its two turrets have a diameter of 3.20 m (10.5 ft); each has an entrance facing the interior of the narthex and three windows. The higher reaches of the towers were reached via spiral stairways, archaeological remains of which have been unearthed in the north turret. There are two pairs of columns inside the narthex, supporting its second floor, which is accessible from the north tower. The columns divide the narthex into three naves and mark the way from the narthex entrance to the gates of the rotunda.

Running shoes are highly technical footwear. The provide stability  while bearing up to three times the wearer's body weight. But it's not easy to find the right pair. Finding the right running shoes is something of an art, or a science and a feel.       The science part begins with the shape of the arch  of your foot, which anyone can find out at home with this quick experiment: Put your foot in water and place it on a piece of brown paper. If you see a \\"C\\" shape on the paper when you remove your foot, you have a rare high arch. If the shape looks more like a rectangle, that means you have flat feet. See something in between? That's a normal arch.            Conveniently for shoppers, shoe companies nowadays divide their shoes in three categories: neutral ( for high arches), stability ( for normal or low arches) and motion control (for flat arches). So you'll know which type suits you.       At this point, most people would just grab an appealing shoe and try it on, But professionals would do a few quality-control tests. First, you bend the shoe toe to heel to see where it bends. If it's not at the forefoot---where the foot actually be bends, be afraid. Then you grip both ends and twist in opposite directions. If you can twist it like a tower, it means there's zero support. Finally, you squeeze  he heel in both directions. A stable heel won't  _ .       Now you need to check the mold  that shapes the inside of the shoe: whether its wide or narrow in the mid-foot, how it sits on the heel and how roomy the toe box is.       It's wise to make the shoe purchase in the late afternoon, to allow for any swelling  that your feet do throughout the day. Toes also decide sizing choices.

Article: Today, home-ownership has reached extremely high levels. Modern generations tend to believe there is something wrong with them if they rent.  However, is high home-ownership really as rosy as people imagine?  Staring at data first, we realize that the most successful, stable, attractive country in the Western world is Switzerland. It has tiny unemployment; wealth; high happiness and mental-health scores.  Does it have high home-ownership rates? Absolutely not. In Switzerland, about seven in ten of the population are renters. Yet, with Europe's lowest home-ownership rate, the nation thrives.  Now go to the other end of the misery distribution. Spain has approximately the highest home-ownership rate in Europe (at more than 80%). But one-quarter of its population are unemployed. A likely reason is that high levels of home-ownership mess up the labour market. In a sensibly functioning economy it is easy for people to move around to drop into the vibrant job slots thrown up by technological change. With a high degree of owner-occupation, everything slows. Folk get stuck. Renters can go to new jobs. In that way they do the economy a favour. As Friedman said, the rate of unemployment depends on the flexibility of the housing market. Next we come to economic breakdown. Most analysts accept that at heart it was the housing market--obsessive pursuit of homes, the engendered mortgage  lending and an unavoidable house-price crash--that sank the Western world. Germany, say, with its more efficient rental market, had a far smoother ride through trouble. As for the monetary system, in the past few decades, in the hope of getting untaxed capital gains way above their true labour earnings, many people threw their spare cash into buying larger houses or building extra bedrooms. TV programmes about how to make easy money, beautiful rising house prices, and most importantly, our falulty tax system encouraged that. When at some point market broke down, everyone suffered.

Would you say that these questions are the same?","output":"To answer these questions, I'll first need to research the main imports and exports of the mentioned countries and compare their industries. Let's begin with Venezuela. Step 1: Find the main imports and exports of Venezuela After researching, I found that Venezuela's main exports are petroleum, refined petroleum products, and gold. Its main imports include medicine, vehicles, machinery, electronics, and food. Now let's compare Venezuela's industry with Haiti's and Peru's: Step 2: Compare the industries of Venezuela and Haiti Venezuela has vast oil reserves and relies heavily on its oil exports. In contrast, Haiti has a weaker economy and limited natural resources. Haiti's main industries include agriculture, textiles, and construction materials. Thus, there is a significant difference between the industries of Venezuela and Haiti. Step 3: Compare the industries of Venezuela and Peru Peru's main industries include mining (such as copper, silver, gold, and zinc), agriculture, and textiles. Although both Venezuela and Peru have natural resources, their industries differ since Peru has a more varied economy and does not rely solely on oil exports. Now to determine if the two questions are the same: Question 1: What are the main imports and exports of Venezuela, and how does Venezuela's industry compare to Haiti's? Question 2: What are the main imports and exports of Venezuela, and how does Venezuela's industry compare to Peru's? These questions are similar, as they both ask about Venezuela's main imports and exports and compare its industry with another country. However, they differ in the countries they refer to for comparison (Haiti in Question 1 and Peru in Question 2). Therefore, these questions cannot be considered identical."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant that follows instruction extremely well. Help as much as you can.

Mercury complains that the older gods are lazy and leave all their duties to him, while he gets no credit for all his drudgery.  Jupiter says that matters have reached a crisis, but he is unsure what can be done about it.  Just then, the gods see a swarm of mortals ascending the mountain and withdraw to observe them from a distance. Thespis's acting company enters for a picnic celebrating the marriage of two of its members, Sparkeion and Nicemis.  The actors, being cheap, have failed to contribute substantial food items to the picnic.  Sparkeion flirts with his former fiancée, Daphne, which annoys Nicemis.  In retaliation, Nicemis flirts with her old suitor, Thespis, but he declines to flirt back.  Thespis explains to his troupe that a successful manager must be aloof from those he manages, or he will lose his authority. Jupiter, Mars and Apollo enter.  All of the actors flee in terror, except for Thespis.  Jupiter asks Thespis whether he is impressed with the father of the gods.  Thespis replies that the gods are unimpressive and suggests that they go down to earth in disguise to \\"mingle\\" and judge for themselves what people think of them.  They agree to invest the actors with their powers, as they take a merry holiday below on Earth.  Thespis agrees that he and his company will keep things running on Mount Olympus during the gods' absence.  Each actor takes the place of one of the gods, with Thespis himself replacing Jupiter.

Trump's barrage of insults comes as Comey engages in a publicity campaign for his book, \\"A Higher Loyalty: Truth, Lies, and Leadership,\\" which is set to be released next week.  The memoir promises a deep look at Comey's fraught relationship with the U.S. president who fired him, and whom Comey has accused of interfering in the independence of the FBI. On Twitter, Trump said Comey should be prosecuted. Trump's comments are in line with an online campaign, organized by his supporters, to discredit Comey.  The Republican National Committee on Thursday launched a new website, Lyin'Comey.com, which features quotes from prominent Democrats who have criticized the former FBI director in the past. The GOP plans to fact-check Comey's book and use the website for \\"rapid response\\" to highlight any \\"misstatements\\" or \\"contradictions,\\" Fox News reports. Comey's book blasts Trump as unethical and \\"untethered to truth'' and calls his leadership of the country \\"ego driven and about personal loyalty.'' The book also contains several personal jabs at Trump, including references to what Comey says are the \\"bright white half-moons\\" under Trump's eyes, which he surmises were the result of Trump using tanning goggles.  Comey also casts Trump as a Mafia boss-like figure who sought to blur the line between law enforcement and politics, and tried to pressure him regarding his investigation into Russian election interference, according to multiple early reviews of the book.  Trump fired Comey in May 2017, setting off a storm of charges from Democrats that the president sought to hinder an investigation into whether his campaign colluded with Russians. The firing led to the appointment of Robert Mueller as special counsel overseeing the Russia investigation. Mueller's probe has expanded to include whether Trump obstructed justice by firing Comey, an idea the president denies. Trump... According to the above context, choose the correct option to answer the following question. Question: Why did the Republican National Committee set up the website lyincomey.com?

In mid-2012, The Wiggles announced that Page, Fatt, and Cook would be retiring from touring with the group; Emma Watkins, the first female member of The Wiggles, replaced Page, Lachlan Gillespie replaced Fatt, and Simon Pryce, who was initially supposed to replace Page in August, replaced Cook.  Anthony Field remained in the group because he found it too difficult to give up and because he still had a passion for educating children.  According to Paul Field, his brother staying in the band \\"was a vital decision to placate American, British and Canadian business partners\\".  Page, Fatt, and Cook remained involved with the creative and production aspects of the group.  Fatt and Cook had been talking about quitting touring for many years; Cook announced his intention to retire first, citing a desire to spend more time with his family, and then Fatt announced his own retirement shortly thereafter.  Page, who was still struggling with his health issues and had stated that his interest was in working with the group's original line-up, was subsequently asked to extend his stay until the end of the year so he would leave alongside Cook and Fatt, to which he agreed.  Cook reported that the original members were confident that the new group would be accepted by the fans because they passed on their founding concepts of early childhood education to Watkins, Gillespie, and Pryce.  The new members, like Moran, who was not approached to return, were salaried employees.The group, for their farewell tour, visited 8 countries and 141 cities, for a total of almost 250 shows in over 200 days for 640,000 people.

They meet Mathias (Joe Anderson), a German tourist, who is looking for his brother Heinrich. His last known location is an archaeological dig at a remote Mayan ruin in the jungle. They are also joined by Dimitri (Dimitri Baveas), Mathias's friend. The group reaches the ruins of a Mayan temple, and are confronted by Mayan villagers with guns and bows. Mathias tries to explain their purpose, but the villagers do not understand Spanish or English. When Amy accidentally touches some vines the villagers become increasingly agitated. Dimitri approaches the villagers, hoping to appease them, but they shoot and kill him. The rest of the group flees up the steps of the ruins. At the top, they find an abandoned camp and a shaft in the center. The group cannot call for help since Eric's phone has no signal. They hear a cell phone ringing from somewhere inside the ruins. Believing it is Heinrich's phone ringing, the rest of the group lowers Mathias down the shaft with a rope. The rope breaks and Mathias falls, becoming completely paralyzed. Amy and Jeff descend the temple steps hoping to reason with the Mayans, but to no success. In anger, Amy throws a clump of vines at them and hits a young boy, whom the Mayans promptly kill. They realize the Mayans are afraid of the vines, and won't let them go since they have touched them. Later, Stacy and Amy descend the shaft to help Mathias and to find the phone. Jeff and Eric rig a backboard and bring Mathias out of the shaft. The next morning, Stacy sees a tendril of vine has crept into a wound on her leg. The vines have also wrapped themselves around Mathias's lower legs and eaten them down to the bone. Eric and Jeff are barely able to remove the vines from Stacy but cannot get them off of Mathias.

Young undocumented immigrants seeking permanent status in the United States received an unexpected boost Thursday on Capitol Hill as a small group of House Republicans mounted a last-minute effort to bring up an immigration vote in Congress. The group of eight Republicans — some freed from political considerations by upcoming retirements and others facing tough re-elections races — defied their own party leadership, quickly persuading 10 more Republicans to sign on to a petition that would force debate on the Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals (DACA) program. With all 193 Democrats expected to sign on, Republicans will have to persuade just seven more members of their own party to join the petition to trigger a vote on several immigration bills on the House floor. But Republican leadership said the effort would be wasted if the end result is a presidential veto. \\"I think it's important for us to come up with a solution that the president can support,\\" House Speaker Paul Ryan told reporters Thursday. These types of petitions are rare and seen as a threat to leadership's ability to direct legislative action. \\"It's better to use the legislative process,\\" Republican Majority Leader Kevin McCarthy told reporters Wednesday. But that argument appears to be losing sway with House members who see an opportunity for legislative action in a mid-term election year. The growing group of House Republicans are joining Democratic colleagues who have long criticized Ryan for not bringing immigration bills up for a vote. \\"This is about making sure we're not consolidating power in the White House,\\" said Representative Mia Love, a Republican from Utah and one of the first lawmakers to sign petition. The immigration issue had all but died after an effort to pass a DACA fix collapsed in the U.S. Senate earlier this year. The program has been the focus of fierce negotiations on Capitol Hill since last September, when President Donald Trump announced he was ending the 2012 Obama-era program and called for a legislative fix. Why did DACA collapse?  A. because Trump ended it  B. because Trump fixed it  C. not enough information  D. because Obama ended it The answer to this question is:","output":"A. because Trump ended it"},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant, who knows every language and how to translate one language to another.

Information:  - Modern rock is an umbrella term describing rock made from the 1980s to present day. Some radio stations use the term to distinguish themselves from classic rock, which tend more towards 1960s-1980s rock music.  - Punk rock (or simply \\"punk\\") is a rock music genre that developed in the early to mid 1970s in the United States, United Kingdom, and Australia. Rooted in 1960s garage rock and other forms of what is now known as \\"proto-punk\\" music, punk rock bands rejected perceived excesses of mainstream 1970s rock. Punk bands typically use short or fast-paced songs, with hard-edged melodies and singing styles, stripped-down instrumentation, and often political, anti-establishment lyrics. Punk embraces a DIY ethic; many bands self-produce recordings and distribute them through informal channels.  - \`\` Through the Iris '' is a single released by alternative rock / metal band 10 Years in 2006 . It is the second single released and track 8 from their first major release , The Autumn Effect . It was released for radio only , as there was no CD single . Like the previous single , the song was also originally released on Killing All That Holds You , the band 's second independent album , produced by Travis Wyrick . The album was eventually reissued with four acoustic tracks . The acoustic tracks were recorded live by Mike D. for Lakeside Studios . It was track 2 and clocked in at 3:23 .  - Alternative rock (also called alternative music, alt-rock or simply alternative) is a genre of rock music that emerged from the independent music underground of the 1980s and became widely popular in the 1990s and 2000s. In this instance, the word \\"alternative\\" refers to the genre's distinction from mainstream rock music. The term's original meaning was broader, referring to a generation of musicians unified by their collective debt to either the musical style or simply the independent, D.I.Y. ethos of punk rock, which in the late 1970s laid the groundwork for alternative music. At times, \\"alternative\\" has been used as a catch-all description for music from underground rock artists that receives mainstream recognition, or for any music, whether rock or not, that is seen to be descended from punk rock (including some examples of punk itself, as well as new wave, and post-punk).  - The Autumn Effect is the third studio album by the Tennessee rock band 10 Years. Produced by Josh Abraham, released on August 16, 2005 through Universal Records and Republic Records. Featured on the album is the popular modern rock track \\"Wasteland\\" and two other singles, \\"Through the Iris\\" and \\"Waking Up\\".  - Josh Abraham is an American record producer, songwriter, and music executive. Having worked with some of the music industry's most successful artists over the past 15 years including P!nk, Thirty Seconds to Mars, Kelly Clarkson, Shakira, Weezer, Linkin Park, Velvet Revolver, Carly Rae Jepsen, Adam Lambert, and Slayer, he has produced and co-written songs accounting for sales of more than 40 million albums worldwide.  - Independent music (often shortened to indie music or indie) is music produced independently from major commercial record labels or their subsidiaries, a process that may include an autonomous, do-it-yourself approach to recording and publishing. The term \\"indie\\" is sometimes also used to describe a genre (such as indie rock and indie pop); as a genre term, \\"indie\\" may include music that is not independently produced, and most independent music artists do not fall into a single, defined musical style or genre, and usually create music that can be categorized into other genres.  - Rock music is a genre of popular music that originated as \\"rock and roll\\" in the United States in the 1950s, and developed into a range of different styles in the 1960s and later, particularly in the United Kingdom and the United States. It has its roots in 1940s' and 1950s' rock and roll, itself heavily influenced by blues, rhythm and blues and country music. Rock music also drew strongly on a number of other genres such as electric blues and folk, and incorporated influences from jazz, classical and other musical sources.  - Republic Records is an American record company that operates as a division of Universal Music Group. The label was endowed by Monte Lipman and Avery Lipman in 1995; it was later paired into the Universal Motown Republic Group in 1999. After the separation of Motown Records from Universal Motown Records, the Universal Motown Republic Group was shuttered, the label was temporarily reincarnated as Universal Republic Records in 2006, until it was revived in late 2012. The label's main offices are located in New York City, New York, United States, other offices of the record label are located at the Interscope Center in Santa Monica, California, U.S.  - Post-punk (originally \\"new musick\\") is a broad type of rock music that emerged from the punk movement of the 1970s, in which artists departed from punk rock's raw, accessible style to pursue a variety of avant-garde sensibilities. Attempting to break from rock tradition, post-punk artists experimented with sources such as electronic music, black dance music and the avant-garde, as well as novel recording technology and production techniques. The movement also saw the frequent intersection of music with art and politics, as artists incorporated ideas from sources such as modernist literature, critical theory, cinema, and performance art. Accompanying these musical developments were communities that produced independent record labels, visual art, multimedia performances and fanzines in conjunction with the music.

Known for their nutritional value and versatility, beans are an excellent source of protein, fiber, and other essential minerals. From salads and stews to casseroles and dips, beans can be incorporated into countless dishes. However, the key to turning beans into a rich and tantalizing meal lies in how you cook and flavor them. In this article, we'll explore some simple, yet effective ways to add flavor to your beans, and create diverse bean dishes you'll keep coming back to. Step 1: Boil the beans with flavorful additions To truly elevate the taste of your beans, it is essential to add some extra flavors to the pot during the boiling phase. Consider adding ingredients like garlic cloves, onion quarters, bay leaves, or even a few dashes of your favorite spices such as cumin or paprika. These aromatic ingredients infuse the beans with flavor as they cook, resulting in a richer, more nuanced dish. Step 2: Incorporate additional vegetables Adding vegetables to your bean dish not only enhances the flavor but also boosts the nutritional value of the meal. Vegetables like bell peppers, carrots, celery, tomatoes, and zucchini perfectly complement beans in dishes like chili, bean salads, and casseroles, creating a well-balanced and satisfying meal. Be sure to saute or roast the vegetables before adding them to the pot to release their natural flavors and maximize their contribution to the dish. Step 3: Substitute stock for bean liquid While traditional bean recipes often call for water or the bean cooking liquid, using chicken, vegetable, or beef stock can significantly enhance the overall flavor of the dish. The stock provides a rich, savory base for your beans, and infuses them with depth and complexity. Consider using homemade stock or a quality store-bought alternative to fully capitalize on this flavor booster. Step 4: Experiment with international variations One of the unique qualities of beans is their adaptability to a wide range of cuisines and flavor profiles. For instance, try giving your refried beans an Italian twist by using white beans like cannellini or Great Northern beans. Mash the beans and mix them with garlic, olive oil, and finely chopped fresh sage for a delicious and unique side dish or spread. Step 5: Utilize a slow cooker A slow cooker is an exceptional appliance for creating flavorful bean dishes. Not only does it tenderize the beans and meld the flavors over an extended period, but it also allows for a hands-off approach to cooking. Simply add ingredients to the slow cooker, turn it on, and let it do its magic while you go about your day. When dinner time rolls around, you'll have a delectable bean dish ready to serve. Conclusion Transforming beans from a bland, monotonous ingredient to a scrumptious, mouthwatering dish is all about introducing flavors and techniques that enhance and complement the beans. By following these simple tips and experimenting with different flavor profiles and cooking methods, you can create bean dishes that are anything but boring. So, go ahead and start enriching your meals with flavorful, versatile bean creations that you and your family will undoubtedly love."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

I hate to give this place a 2 star review based on some things that are not their fault but the truth of the matter is that I have had better accommodations elsewhere and at other Hamptons.    I picked this Hampton because it was close to where I needed to be, not too far from the strip/food and it was close to the airport...that last one is what got me.  It's VERY VERY VERY VERY VERY VERY VERY VERY VERY close to the airport.  I mean very close.  Like, look out your window and there's a jumbo jet close.    So the planes landing and taking off at all hours of the night?  You can hear all of it.  It gets so bad that the windows shake at times and if you're a light sleeper then you probably aren't sleeping.

News article: - USATODAY.com Next time you're inching your way through the line at the airport security checkpoint, take a look around. Do the plastic bins where people plop their laptops, carry-on bags and shoes look worn and industrial gray or do they look crisp, white and new? At the majority of the more than 400 U.S. airports, the checkpoints are stocked with the generic, government-issued gray bins. They're boring, yes, but they do what the TSA needs them to do: contain your stuff as it sits on the belt that passes through the x-ray machine. But the checkpoints at more than two dozen airports have those crisp, white bins. In those airports the bins do not only what the TSA needs them to do, they also save the TSA time and money. And because there are advertisements inside these bins, they generate income for the airports. Not bad for a bunch of recyclable plastic. The advertisement-bearing bins are the brainchild of Joe Ambrefe, CEO of Security Point Media (SPM), who came up with the idea not long after 9/11 while standing in a long line at an airport security checkpoint. He realized everyone had to grab a bin and that an advertisement inside each bin was a sure-fire way for a company to reach the desirable demographic of business and leisure travelers. 1.

Houston Bush Intercontinental Airport25. Houston Hobby Airport26. Miami International Airport Ambrefe worked up a plan to provide free bins (and carts to move those bins around) in exchange for the right to sell advertisements on the bins. He chose white bins because \\"color is an emotive issue and white is a happier color than industrial gray.\\" He also promised to replace the bins every 90 days with brand new units so that \\"the components are opening-day fresh all the time.\\" Testing began in 2007 and now the Bin Advertising Program is in operation at Orlando, San Diego, Seattle-Tacoma, JFK, LaGuardia and 21 other airports nationwide and is approved by the Transportation Security Administration (TSA) for all airports. The TSA likes the program because it saves the agency money: The free bins represent an overall savings of between 200,000 and 700,000 on the costs of replacing bins. And TSA spokesperson Greg Soule said the program also \\"reduced injuries associated with lifting bins and improved durability and aesthetics of the checkpoint equipment.\\" Airports like the program because it generates a bit of extra money and helps improve the checkpoint experience for passengers. At Los Angeles International Airport, one of the program's first test sites, spokesperson Nancy Castles says ad revenues helped purchase \\"the long tables, seating, floor mats, wheeled bin carriers, stanchions and other equipment that helps streamline the TSA passenger security screening process.\\" The airport also gets to place its own advertising in some of the bins and is currently promoting its LAX FlyAway bus service. At Nashville International, an early test airport which officially signed up with the program in 2010, spokesperson Emily Richard said, \\"We have experienced significant and consistent improvement of the appearance of the checkpoint since SPM started managing the process.\\" She added that year-to-date income from the program is 7,500. And in Houston, where the Hobby and George Bush Intercontinental airports joined the program in June, Houston Airport System's concessions manager Randy Goodman described the benefits as \\"bright new bins and a streamlined process,\\" and a share of the advertising income that should net the airport about 26,000 for the first six months. Ambrefe hopes to expand the bin advertising program to other airports and continues to tweak the system. He said that while the company has not considered providing separate bins for shoes - a suggestion put forth by some groups concerned about checkpoint health risks - \\"antimicrobial products for use at the checkpoints are in research.\\" In the meantime, both Ambrefe and the TSA might make note of the checkpoint procedures in place at Canada's Prince Rupert Airport, in northern British Columbia. The airport has color-coded bins for boots and shoes and, for the past 18 years, the security team has cleaned all the bins after each of the six daily flights. \\"It's nice to know that when you lay down your suit jacket or coat that the bin has not previously contained any dirty boots or other contaminated item,\\" said airport manager Richard Reed. \\"The bins are cleaned to protect the health of the screening agents and the traveling public,\\" said team leader Virginia Toro. \\"We treat the checkpoint as we do our home: clean is the rule of the day.\\" Harriet Baskas writes about travel etiquette for MSNBC.com and is the author of the airport guidebook Stuck at the Airport and a blog of the same name.

Advertisement-bearing, white bins implemented in more than two dozen major U.S airports are saving the TSA time and money while generating income for the airports. 2. The bins were created by Joe Ambrefe, CEO of Security Point Media, who provides the bins for free in exchange for the right to sell advertisements on them. 3. The bins are replaced every 90 days with fresh, clean units, and the use of the program has resulted in an overall savings of between 200,000 and 700,000 on the costs of replacing bins. 4.

[+] The mother comforted the child.","output":"The mother, upon hearing her child's painful cry, rushed to the living room with great concern. She saw her young toddler lying on the floor, tears streaming down his red cheeks. Immediately, she assessed the situation and realized that he had fallen from the chair. Her maternal instincts kicked in, and she knew she must comfort her precious child. She kneeled down beside him, scooping him up gently in her loving arms. As she held him, she started to soothingly pat his back, whispering calming words into his tiny ear. \\"It's okay, sweetheart. Mommy's here. You're going to be just fine,\\" she reassured him, trying to ease his pain and fear. As her comforting words and touch started to lessen the toddler's tears, she began to inspect his body for any injuries he might have sustained from the fall. Thankfully, there were no signs of any severe harm, but she knew that he might be feeling sore for a while. She decided that this presented an opportunity to teach her child about safety and responsibility. Holding him close, she took a moment to explain why it was important to be careful while climbing on furniture. \\"You know, my love, it's not safe to climb on chairs like that. We can easily hurt ourselves if we're not careful. We must always ask for help when we want to reach something,\\" she said in a gentle tone. The little boy, still snuggling in his mother's caring embrace, seemed to understand the message. His tears had subsided, and he appeared more at ease now. His mother gave him a tender kiss on his forehead and decided it was best to take a break from the kitchen to spend some quality time with her son. Together, they went to his playroom where they spent the next hour engaging in fun and educational activities, tailored to instill a sense of safety and responsibility in the little boy. With each lesson and game, the toddler gradually became more aware of the importance of taking precautions and asking for assistance when necessary. As the day went by, both the mother and her young son grew more in-sync, developing a stronger bond and understanding of one another. The experience of the fall and the lessons learned brought them closer, ensuring that the once seemingly traumatic event had become a teachable moment that positively impacted both their lives. In the end, the young toddler's fall from the chair wasn't just a fleeting moment of pain and distress; it was an opportunity for growth, understanding, and a reminder that sometimes, life's challenging moments can lead to precious lessons and deeper connections with those we love."},{"instruction":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

What is the missing first step of the following process:  -  The star does not have enough mass to become a neutron star - The star goes through a change in its core and bonds helium to carbon and oxygen - The star becomes a red giant - A mass of carbon and oxygen builds up in the center of the star - The star sheds its outside layers and becomes a nebula - The star leaves behind the core which becomes a dwarf star. Answer:","output":"The missing first step in the given process is: The star starts its life as a protostar, forming from a dense cloud of dust and gas in a nebula. To provide a more detailed explanation, let's go through the entire process with the missing step included: 1. The star begins its life as a protostar, forming from a dense cloud of dust and gas in a nebula. This cloud, mainly composed of hydrogen, starts contracting under its own gravity, becoming hotter and denser over time. As the temperature and pressure rise, nuclear reactions begin at the core of the protostar, marking the beginning of its life as a main-sequence (hydrogen-burning) star. 2. The star does not have enough mass to become a neutron star. This means that it is a low- to medium-mass star, typically less than 8 solar masses. Stars in this category do not undergo supernova explosions and instead follow a different evolutionary path leading to the formation of a white dwarf star. 3. The star goes through a change in its core and bonds helium to carbon and oxygen. This occurs when the hydrogen in the core is almost fully converted into helium, causing the core to contract and heat up. In turn, helium starts fusing into heavier elements like carbon and oxygen in a process known as helium burning. This phase marks the beginning of the star's ascent along the red giant branch. 4. The star becomes a red giant. As helium burning occurs in the core, the outer layers of the star expand and cool off, giving it a red appearance. This phase is characterized by the star's significant increase in size, which can reach as much as several hundred times its original diameter. 5. A mass of carbon and oxygen builds up in the center of the star. With time, the core becomes richer in carbon and oxygen as the helium fusion continues. For stars with masses lower than about 4 solar masses, the fusion process stops at carbon and oxygen, as the core never becomes hot and dense enough to ignite carbon fusion. 6. The star sheds its outside layers and becomes a planetary nebula. As the red giant's core continues to contract, the outer layers of the star are gradually expelled into space, forming an expanding gas cloud known as a planetary nebula. This occurs due to intense stellar winds caused by the increased radiation pressure from the core. 7. The star leaves behind the core which becomes a white dwarf star. After shedding its outer layers, the exposed hot core is now a white dwarf star, mostly composed of carbon and oxygen. These compact, dense remnants are incredibly hot, but they gradually cool down and emit light over billions of years, eventually fading to black as black dwarfs. However, this cooling process takes such a long time that there are currently no known black dwarfs in the Universe. To summarize, the missing first step in the process is the formation of a star from a protostar in a nebula. This crucial step sets the stage for the entire subsequent stellar evolution."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Here are possible answers to this question: - the ground - outside - park - ground - uzbekistan  I believe the correct choice is \\"ground\\", here's why: A:","output":"Apple trees drop their fruit primarily to the ground. This is because of the force of gravity that pulls objects downwards towards the surface of the Earth.  When apples ripen, they often fall off the tree naturally, even without any external force like wind or human intervention. As the fruit matures, the cells in its stem weaken, and eventually, the weight of the apples causes the stem to break, dropping the apples to the ground. This is a part of the tree's reproductive process, as apple trees rely on the dispersal of seeds contained within the fruit to propagate. It is worth noting that the other options provided don't really make sense as answers to the question. \\"Outside,\\" \\"park,\\" and \\"Uzbekistan\\" are not direct explanations for where the fruit falls in relation to the tree itself.

They gather data on everything from the moisture of our soil to the intensity of mighty hurricanes. Day after day they orbit the planet, watching, recording and transmitting. These spacecraft lead a lonely, desolate life, with one major perk: the gorgeous view. NASA, a composer and an architect are trying to bring the Earth-orbiting satellite's experience down to the planet's surface with an art installation in New York City this weekend as part of the World Science Festival. The shell-shaped piece of art they created — made out of aluminum and called the NASA Orbit Pavilion — is designed to be acoustically ideal for groups of kids and adults standing in the middle of it for a five-minute sound show. The show is engineered to take listeners on a journey with the 20 NASA satellites studying Earth today. These kinds of art and education pieces provide an important source of inspiration for people who may not know much about NASA otherwise, Ellen Stofan, NASA's chief scientist, said. \\"Apollo inspired a whole generation of kids to go into engineering, math, science,\\" Stofan told Mashable in an interview at the exhibit. \\"They didn't end up all working for NASA, but I think NASA plays a really important inspirational role in getting kids to go into STEM subjects.\\" The exhibit starts with a rocket launch (as any proper space mission does). The dome of the shell shakes, and you can feel the reverberation of the sound in your bones, just like a real launch. The sound design then moves into a composition written by composer Shane Myrbeck that uses different kinds of sounds to represent the 20 satellites and the International Space Station as they orbit the planet. NASA's Orbit Pavilion from the outside. Image: Greg Kessler/World Science Festival Myrbeck used instruments like the piano and cello for land-studying satellites, while he used a blend of sounds from wind and glass instruments for atmosphere-observing probes, and water-derived noises for ocean-observing satellites The Space Station, which is an international project, is represented by vocal harmony. The vocals change throughout the composition because the people on the station change, Myrbeck said. \\"It sounds like an echo of a memory,\\" StudioKCA architect Jason Klimoski told Mashable. He designed the overall installation. \\"It's very lonely. The sounds are getting more and more space-like because they're more and more lonely. You think about these things way out in space listening — always listening — listening to the Earth, listening to the land.\\" After the musical interpretation of the satellites, the soundscape pivots again. People in the dome can then hear a voice call out the various names of NASA satellites — SMAP, Aqua, etc. — as they fly overhead and in every direction. Myrbeck, NASA's David Delgado and Dan Goods gather real-time data to sonically demonstrate where the satellites are in space at any given moment. The installation comes at a time when NASA's Earth science objectives have come under fire from members of Congress. Some congressional officials have said that NASA should focus on human and robotic exploration goals instead of Earth research because other government agencies, like the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration, are tasked with learning more about our home planet. But Stofan thinks that NASA is in a particularly unique position to observe Earth on a planet-wide scale, allowing them to focus on complex processes like global climate. \\"The Earth is a planet, and only NASA has the unique ability to study planets. The Earth needs to be studied as a planet because it's a very complex system. Other agencies focus on doing research here on the planet. NASA focuses on using the techniques, the tools and pushing the technology for studying our planet from space.\\" Perhaps NASA should erect the installation in Congress as an experiential lobbying project, because it certainly drives home the fact that the agency has a lot of assets in space that beam back data about Earth everyday. The exhibit is open in New York through Sunday, and might \\"resurface\\" again locally sometime this summer, according to the World Science Festival. Summary:","output":"NASA, a composer, and an architect have collaborated to bring the Earth-orbiting satellite's experience down to the planet's surface with an art installation in New York City as part of the World Science Festival. The NASA Orbit Pavilion, constructed with aluminum and designed to be acoustically perfect, played a 5-minute sound show in which 20 of NASA's Earth-observing satellites were represented through music. This art installation aims to inspire people, especially children, to become more interested in STEM subjects, as well as showcasing NASA's unique ability to study the Earth as a planet due to its wide range of orbiting satellites."},{"instruction":"I am trying to decide whether it's worth it to invest in this film proposal.

She accidentally causes all sorts of havoc with her Kryptonian-like powers until the Dark Knight exposes her to a piece of Kryptonite. With Superman's help, they discover that the girl is Kara Zor-El, the niece of Jor-El and Superman's biological cousin. While Superman welcomes Kara, teaches her English, and helps her adjust to Earth society, Batman remains suspicious. Tipped off by Batman, Wonder Woman and Lyla ambush Clark Kent and Kara in a park and take Kara to Themyscira, on the basis that only there can she learn to control her powers. Superman reluctantly agrees, but still prefers to watch to Kara himself.Meanwhile, on the planet Apokolips, Darkseid learns of Kara's presence on Earth, and orders her to be captured and brought to Apokolips as a possible candidate to lead the Female Furies since the departure of Big Barda.

Is it possible to conclude that if the premise is true, then so is the hypothesis?","output":"Yes, it is possible to conclude that if the premise is true, then the hypothesis could also be true. If we break it down, we can analyze the components of the premise and the hypothesis to better understand this connection. Premise: \\"What I'd like to know is how them bushwhackers knew jus' where to lay down an' wait for Oliveri.\\" Hypothesis: \\"It surprises me they were able to take down Oliveri.\\" In the premise, the speaker is wondering how the bushwhackers were able to determine the precise location where they could lay an ambush for Oliveri. This implies that the bushwhackers had some knowledge or information about Oliveri's whereabouts, which they used strategically to carry out their plan. The premise suggests that the bushwhackers were successful at least in setting up an ambush, but it doesn't explicitly state whether they managed to take down Oliveri or not. The hypothesis involves the speaker's reaction to the bushwhackers' ability to take down Oliveri. It shows that the speaker is surprised by the outcome of the event. This could be because of multiple reasons, such as the speaker underestimating the bushwhackers' abilities, overestimating Oliveri's strength or protection, or simply not understanding how the bushwhackers managed to plan and execute their attack so well. Considering the premise and hypothesis, if we assume that the bushwhackers were able to lay the perfect ambush, which is directly implied in the premise, then it becomes more plausible that they could have successfully taken down Oliveri. The perfect ambush would give them a tactical advantage, allowing them to take their target by surprise and potentially leaving Oliveri with little chance to defend himself or escape the situation. However, it is important to note that the connection between the premise and the hypothesis is not a definitive one. While a well-executed ambush increases the likelihood of successfully taking down Oliveri, it does not guarantee it. There might be other factors, such as Oliveri's ability to defend himself, help from others, or even sheer luck, that could have helped Oliveri to survive the situation. So, even if the premise is true, it doesn't undeniably confirm the hypothesis. In conclusion, if the premise is true and the bushwhackers were indeed able to lay a perfect ambush for Oliveri, then it seems more likely that the hypothesis is true as well. While there is a connection between the two statements, it is not an absolute one. Instead, it merely increases the probability that if one statement is true, the other might be true as well."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant. You will be given a task.

Baby Leonidas is then inspected, having a six-pack, biceps, and beard from birth. He is accepted as a Spartan and prepared for kinghood through his childhood training, from fighting his grandmother to enduring torture. Leonidas (Sean Maguire) is then cast out into the wild, and survives the harsh winter while killing a giant dancing penguin. Returning a king for his inauguration ceremony, Leonidas sees Margo (Carmen Electra) dancing and asks her to marry him, to which she responds by giving him the combination to her chastity belt.Years later, Leonidas is training when Captain (Kevin Sorbo) informs him that a Persian messenger has arrived.

Is \\"He did not have a separate cult, but he was the personification of the holy magic-song sung by the magicians that was supposed to cure disease.\\" a good answer to the question \\"Who is the physician of the Gods in the Iliad?\\"","output":"While the statement \\"He did not have a separate cult, but he was the personification of the holy magic-song sung by the magicians that was supposed to cure disease\\" offers some insight into the concept of a divine healer in ancient Greece, it does not directly answer the question, \\"Who is the physician of the Gods in the Iliad?\\" A more comprehensive and informative response to the question would be: In the Iliad, the physician of the Gods is the Greek deity Paean (also spelled Paeon). Paean is not one of the central characters in the Iliad, but he is occasionally mentioned in connection with his divine healing abilities. As the physician of the Gods, Paean is responsible for providing them with medical aid when needed, such as during the midst of battles or other conflicts. In the epic poem, he is particularly noted for his role in tending to the wounds of both gods and mortals alike. It is important to note that Paean's role as the divine healer does not mean he possessed a separate cult dedicated to his worship. The cults in ancient Greece were primarily focused on gods who had more significant roles in mythology, such as Zeus, Hera, or Athena. However, Paean was still considered a highly important figure due to his ability to heal and provide relief to those in need. Paean was traditionally portrayed as a young and beautiful god, which symbolized his close association with youthfulness, vitality, and, ultimately, good health. Additionally, his divine prowess was often said to be personified through the magic-song or hymns sung by ancient Greek magicians and healers, which were believed to have the power to cure disease. These songs, typically performed during rituals, were passed down through generations and paid homage to Paean's expertise in the art of healing. In summary, Paean is the physician of the Gods in the Iliad, responsible for providing medical aid to divine and mortal beings in the epic. Though he did not have a separate cult dedicated to his worship, Paean's importance in ancient Greek society translates through the magic-song sung by magicians, which were believed to contain holy and restorative powers."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

When they go out to enjoy themselves, they can wear almost anything. At theatres  , cinemas and concerts   you can put on anything you like: from beautiful suits and dresses to jeans and sweaters. Anything goes, as long as you look clean and tidy. But in Britain, as well as in the US, men in offices usually wear suits and ties and women wear dresses or skirts (not trousers). Doctors and business people always wear quite formal clothes. And in some hotels and restaurants men have to wear ties and women have to wear tidy dresses. In many ways, Americans are less formal than British people, but they are more careful with their clothes. At home, most Americans wear informal   or sports clothes. But when they go out in the evening, they like to look nice. In good hotels and restaurants, men have to wear jackets and ties, and women have to wear pretty clothes. It is difficult to say exactly   what people wear in Britain and the US, because everyone is different. If you are not sure what to wear, watch what other people do and then do the same.

Choices:  - decomposition energy  - reaction energy  - positive energy  - activation energy  A: The answer to this question is:","output":"Activation Energy. Activation energy is the amount of energy that is required to initiate a chemical reaction. It is a fundamental concept in chemistry and is expressed in joules per mole or kilojoules per mole. The term was first introduced by the Swedish scientist Svante Arrhenius in 1889. The concept of activation energy is related to the reaction rate, which is the speed at which a chemical reaction occurs. The higher the activation energy, the slower the chemical reaction, as more energy is required to overcome the energy barrier for the reaction to proceed. In contrast, if the activation energy is low, the reaction rate is high as the reaction can easily take place. In a chemical reaction, the reactants first have to be converted into an activated complex or transition state, which is a short-lived, high-energy, unstable state. The formation of this structure requires an input of energy which is the activation energy. This explains why you need to, for instance, heat a mixture to kick start a reaction: you are feeding in the activation energy. In many cases, a catalyst is used to decrease the activation energy of a reaction. By providing a different reaction pathway, catalysts reduce the energy required to reach the transition state, and hence increase the rate of the reaction. Catalysts are extensively used in the chemical industry and biochemistry. In our bodies, for instance, enzymes act as catalysts to allow biochemical reactions to proceed quickly at normal body temperature. While \\"decomposition energy\\", \\"reaction energy\\", and \\"positive energy\\" can be associated with chemical reactions in certain contexts, none of them refers specifically to the amount of energy required to start a reaction. Decomposition energy refers to the energy associated with the breakdown of a compound into its constituent elements. Reaction energy generally refers to the energy change in a chemical reaction, which can be exothermic (releases energy) or endothermic (absorbs energy). \\"Positive energy\\" is not a term commonly used in the field of chemistry.

We're trying to find the value of \\"d\\". The equation looks a bit long but don't worry, we'll break it down.  Here's the equation we'll solve: -106*d = 53*d - 402 - 11192 - 10348 First, let's add the numbers on the right side of the equation: -402 - 11192 - 10348 = -21942 (it's okay if the number is negative) Now, the equation looks like this: -106*d = 53*d - 21942 We want to get all the \\"d\\" terms on one side, so let's move the \\"53*d\\" from the right side to the left side by subtracting it: -106*d - 53*d = -21942 Now, add the \\"d\\" terms: -159*d = -21942 Next, we want to find the value of \\"d\\". To do that, we'll divide both sides of the equation by -159: d = -21942 / -159 When we do the division, we get: d = 138 So, that's the answer! The value of \\"d\\" is 138.

FedEx to Acquire TNT Express for 4.8 Billion FedEx will acquire Dutch delivery giant TNT Express for 4.8 billion in an all-cash deal that will vastly expand the American company’s operations across Europe, the company revealed on Tuesday. “This transaction allows us to quickly broaden our portfolio of international transportation solutions to take advantage of market trends – especially the continuing growth of global e-commerce – and positions FedEx for greater long-term profitable growth,” CEO of FedEx Corp. Frederick Smith said in a public statement of the deal. TNT Express’ executive board unanimously agreed to the deal which will have FedEx purchase all shares of TNT at €8 (8.60) a share, but the deal will still have to pass a review from European anti-trust regulators before closing in early 2016. Regulators previously denied UPS a similar buyout deal for TNT in 2013. “FedEx and TNT Express are confident that anti-trust concerns, if any, can be addressed adequately in a timely fashion,” FedEx noted in a press statement.

Australia #39;s Prime Minister and the country #39;s main opposition leader say  quot;trust quot; will be a key issue when voters go to the polls on October the ninth.","output":"This statement is about the Australian federal elections held on October 9th, 2004. The two key figures mentioned here are the then-incumbent Prime Minister, John Howard of the Liberal Party, and the main opposition leader, Mark Latham of the Australian Labor Party. The central theme and focal point of the 2004 Australian federal election campaign was the issue of \\"trust.\\" In the run-up to the election, both John Howard and Mark Latham emphasized the importance of trust in their campaigns. They sought to convince Australian voters that their respective parties had the qualities necessary to guide the nation through a time of significant global and domestic challenges. John Howard, who was seeking his fourth term as prime minister, was keen on highlighting his experience and competence as a leader. Since first being elected in 1996, Howard successfully navigated Australia through a period of strong economic growth and low unemployment. Additionally, he played a significant role in strengthening Australia's alliances with important global partners, especially the United States, particularly as a strong supporter of U.S.-led initiatives in Afghanistan and Iraq. Throughout the campaign, Howard sought to portray himself as a trustworthy, experienced, and stable leader, well-versed in the complexities of foreign and domestic policies. Furthermore, he pointed to the achievements and consistency of his government as evidence of his party's ability to lead the nation effectively and ensure its national security and continued prosperity. On the other hand, Mark Latham, who had taken over as the leader of the Australian Labor Party in December 2003, was eager to present a fresh and viable alternative to Howard's government. Latham focused on a range of pressing issues, such as climate change, improving the public healthcare system, and investing in education and infrastructure. One of his key campaign promises was to withdraw Australian troops from Iraq. As the main opposition leader, Latham positioned himself as a passionate and energetic advocate for change, with a vision for a more inclusive, compassionate, and forward-looking Australia. He argued that the Howard government had become complacent and disconnected from the concerns of ordinary citizens, and sought to capitalize on voter fatigue with the incumbent. Latham centered his campaign on the notion that the Australian people could place their trust in him and his party to bring about meaningful, positive reforms in the national interest. In conclusion, the 2004 Australian federal elections were marked by an emphasis on the notion of trust as a key issue. Both the incumbent Prime Minister, John Howard, and the main opposition leader, Mark Latham, sought to highlight their respective qualities and visions as the basis for voters to place their trust in them. Ultimately, the election resulted in a victory for John Howard and the Liberal Party, securing another term in office and validating their claims of trustworthiness and competence in the eyes of the Australian electorate."},{"instruction":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

However, on the morning of his departure, he receives a mysterious letter signed by an unknown source. The letter contains only one line - \\"Where is Lecor flown to Memphis, Tennessee?\\" Intrigued by the cryptic message, Lecor decides to unearth the truth behind it. The plot thickens when Lecor arrives in Memphis to discover that the city is being plagued by a string of bizarre occurrences. A series of bank robberies, with the victims being left alive but in a state of temporary amnesia, have the police baffled. As he delves deeper into the story, Lecor finds himself uncovering a hidden world of crime and intrigue. The city's most prolific crime lord, Alastair King, orchestrates kidnappings, drug deals, and political machinations to control the city's underworld with an iron fist. Unbeknownst to Lecor, King is also intimately connected to the recent bank robberies. The amnesia suffered by those affected is the result of a groundbreaking technology designed to extract memories and information. While working his way through the seedy criminal underworld of Memphis, Lecor enlists the help of a rogue detective named Victoria Mitchell. The two quickly uncover that the cryptic letter Lecor received had been sent by a former victim of King's memory extraction technology in a desperate attempt to warn him about the dangers he faces in Memphis. As they investigate further, Lecor and Mitchell begin to unravel the truth behind the amnesiac bank robberies and the origin of the mysterious technology. They discover that King is using this technology to gather information that will allow him to exercise more significant control over the city's political and financial infrastructure, positioning himself to take over Memphis entirely. Together, the duo tenaciously pursue King and his network of criminals, capturing his right-hand man and decrypting information that leads them to King's secret lab, where the memory extraction technology is stored. The stakes are higher than ever when Lecor is captured and subjected to the memory extraction procedure by King himself. It's a race against time as Mitchell and her team work to rescue Lecor, dismantle the criminal network, and bring King to justice. With the help of his new allies, Lecor is saved from the memory extraction procedure, and King's operation is shut down. The war against corruption and crime in Memphis is ongoing, but thanks to the investigative prowess of Lecor and Mitchell, the streets are much safer. The Memphis Mystery is a thrilling film that takes viewers on a journey through the dark and dangerous world of crime and corruption, with unexpected twists and turns that keep the audience guessing until the very end.

The decision to deploy the U.S. military to the border represents a major new aspect of Trump’s wide-ranging immigration crackdown. But major parts of the move are unclear, including how many troops will be sent, when they will deploy, or what exactly they will do. “It will take time to have the details in place, but we are beginning today and are moving quickly,” said Kirstjen Nielsen, secretary of the Department of Homeland Security. “We are anxious to have this support.” In the U.S., the active duty military is generally restricted from domestic law enforcement functions, which would include apprehending border crossers. However, U.S. presidents have deployed the National Guard to the border to act in support roles. Nielsen said the National Guard troops will help with border surveillance and other “support functions.” She declined to say how large the force would be, but she did say it would include “as many (troops) as is needed to fill the gaps today.” A senior Trump administration official declined to say whether the National Guard troops will be armed, saying those details are still being worked out. But the official said the force would be effective. “Suffice it to say, for individuals looking to pay a smuggler to get in the United States right now, that would be a very unwise investment,” the official said. Trump signed a proclamation authorizing the move Wednesday evening. But states must also approve the decision before deploying their guard members.

Belgian killer and rapist 'will not be euthanised' despite wishes Convicted Belgian killer and rapist Frank Van Den Bleeken. (Supplied) An imprisoned Belgian serial rapist and murderer whose wish to die was previously granted by doctors, will not be euthanised following a fresh medical decision. Frank Van Den Bleeken, who has spent 26 years in jail for repeated rapes and a rape-murder, will be moved from his prison in the northwestern city of Bruges to a new psychiatric treatment centre in Ghent, Justice Minister Koen Geens said in a statement on Tuesday. Geens \\"takes note of the decision of doctors treating Mr Frank Van Den Bleeken to no longer continue the euthanasia procedure,\\" the minister said in a statement. He gave no reason for the decision, citing medical privacy. The Flemish-language newspaper De Morgen reported at the weekend that Van Den Bleeken would be euthanised in Bruges prison on January 11. Van Den Bleeken had for years requested that the state help him end his life due to what his lawyer Jos Vander Velpen called \\"unbearable\\" psychological suffering. He won approval in September. Belgium legalised euthanasia in 2002, the second country in the world to do so after The Netherlands, and logged a record 1807 cases of euthanasia in 2013. Its strict conditions for a mercy killing include that patients must be capable, conscious and have presented a \\"voluntary, considered and repeated\\" request to die. Van Den Bleeken, considering himself a menace to society, had refused to be considered for early parole but found the conditions of his detention inhumane, according to an interview he gave Belgian media.

And the answer is...","output":"To solve the equation 493*b - 976*b - 333913 = -221*b + 4441*b for b, we first need to simplify the equation by combining like terms (terms with the same variable).  1. Combine like terms on the left side: 493*b - 976*b = (-483)*b So the equation becomes: -483*b - 333913 = -221*b + 4441*b 2. Combine like terms on the right side: -221*b + 4441*b = 4220*b Now, the simplified equation is: -483*b - 333913 = 4220*b 3. To get all the terms with variable 'b' on one side of the equation, we can add 483*b to both sides: -333913 = 4220*b + 483*b 4. Combine the 'b' terms on the right side: 4220*b + 483*b = 4703*b Now, we have: -333913 = 4703*b 5. To solve for 'b', we need to isolate the variable by dividing both sides of the equation by 4703: b = -333913 / 4703 6. Calculate the value for 'b': b ≈ -71 So, the solution to the equation 493*b - 976*b - 333913 = -221*b + 4441*b for b is b ≈ -71."},{"instruction":"Bailey used trickery to control his classmates  think he can solve the mat problem.

The use of the right of self-defense as a legal justification for the use of force in times of danger is available in many jurisdictions, but the interpretation varies widely.  - The term \\"manga\\" (kanji: ; hiragana: ; katakana:  or ) in Japan is a word used to refer to both comics and cartooning. \\"Manga\\" as a term used outside Japan refers to comics originally published in Japan.  - Law enforcement is any system by which some members of society act in an organized manner to enforce the law by discovering, deterring, rehabilitating, or punishing people who violate the rules and norms governing that society. Although the term may encompass entities such as courts and prisons, it is most frequently applied to those who directly engage in patrols or surveillance to dissuade and discover criminal activity, and those who investigate crimes and apprehend offenders, a task typically carried out by the police or another law enforcement agency. Furthermore, although law enforcement may be most concerned with the prevention and punishment of crimes, organizations exist to discourage a wide variety of non-criminal violations of rules and norms, effected through the imposition of less severe consequences.  - Art is a diverse range of human activities in creating visual, auditory or performing artifacts (artworks), expressing the author's imaginative or technical skill, intended to be appreciated for their beauty or emotional power.

Chiba would reprise this role in two more films \\"Karate Bearfighter\\" (1975), and \\"Karate for Life\\" (1977).  - Martial arts are codified systems and traditions of combat practices, which are practiced for a number of reasons: as self-defense, military and law enforcement applications, mental and spiritual development; as well as entertainment and the preservation of a nation's intangible cultural heritage.  - The Netherlands  is the main constituent country of the Kingdom of the Netherlands. It is a densely populated country located in Western Europe with three island territories in the Caribbean. The European part of the Netherlands borders Germany to the east, Belgium to the south, and the North Sea to the northwest, sharing maritime borders with Belgium, the United Kingdom, and Germany. The largest cities in the Netherlands are Amsterdam, Rotterdam, The Hague and Utrecht. Amsterdam is the country's capital, while The Hague holds the Dutch seat of government and parliament. The name \\"Holland\\" is used to refer informally to the whole of the country of the Netherlands.  - Early life. Miura was born on October 3, 1949, in Kisarazu, Chiba, Japan, the son of a ship's engineer. He has one younger brother and one younger sister. Miura began training in Shotokan karate at the age of 13 years, and had been promoted to the rank of 2nd \\"dan\\" black belt by his 18th birthday. He also studied judo in his youth, achieving the rank of 1st \\"dan\\" in that art by the time he was 17. In 1967, aged 18, he began studying Kyokushin karate in a club at Josai International University. His teacher was Yoshiji Soeno at the university. Miura also studied this karate in summer vacation at the \\"honbu dojo\\" (headquarters training hall) of the Kyokushin in Tokyo.  - Combat or fight is a purposeful violent conflict meant to weaken, establish dominance over, or kill the opposition, or to drive the opposition away from a location where it is not wanted or needed.  - Sir Alfred Joseph Hitchcock (13 August 1899  29 April 1980) was an English film director and producer, at times referred to as \\"The Master of Suspense\\". He pioneered many elements of the suspense and psychological thriller genres. He had a successful career in British cinema with both silent films and early talkies and became renowned as England's best director. Hitchcock moved to Hollywood in 1939, and became a US citizen in 1955.  - Film producers fill a variety of roles depending upon the type of producer. Either employed by a production company or independent, producers plan and coordinate various aspects of film production, such as selecting script, coordinating writing, directing and editing, and arranging financing. During the \\"discovery stage\\", the producer has to find and acknowledge promising material. Then, unless the film is supposed to be based on an original script, the producer has to find an appropriate screenwriter.  - Intangible cultural heritage (ICH) is promoted by UNESCO as a counterpart to the World Heritage focusing mainly on intangible aspects of culture. In 2001, UNESCO made a survey among States and NGOs to try to agree on a definition, and the Convention for the Safeguarding of Intangible Cultural Heritage was drafted in 2003 for its protection and promotion.  - A politician (from \\"politics\\" + \\"-ian\\", from the Greek title of Aristotle's book  \\"Politika\\", meaning \\"Civic Affairs\\") is a person active in party politics, or a person holding or seeking office in government. In democratic countries, politicians seek elective positions within a government through elections or, at times, temporary appointment to replace politicians who have died, resigned or have been otherwise removed from office. In non-democratic countries, they employ other means of reaching power through appointment, bribery, revolutions and intrigues. Some politicians are experienced in the art or science of government. Politicians propose, support and create laws or policies that govern the land and, by extension, its people. Broadly speaking, a \\"politician\\" can be anyone who seeks to achieve political power in any bureaucratic institution.  - Works. Manga. All listings are as Ikki Kajiwara unless otherwise specified.  - Karate Bearfighter (   Kenka karate kyokushin burai ken , literally \`\` Fighting Karate - Brutal Ultimate Truth Fist '' ) is a Japanese martial arts film made by Toei Company in 1975 and directed by Kazuhiko Yamaguchi . It is the second installment of a trilogy of films based on the manga Karate Baka Ichidai ( literal title : \`\` A Karate - Crazy Life '' ) by Ikki Kajiwara , Jiro Tsunoda and Jya Kagemaru . Sonny Chiba reprises his role from Champion of Death as Masutatsu Oyama , the historical founder of Kyokushin karate in Japan ( Oyama makes a cameo appearance in the film as well ) . Chiba was an interesting choice for the role , as he had studied martial arts under the real - life Oyama for several years . True to the film 's title , at one point in the course of the narrative he battles a \`\` bear '' , actually a human actor in a bear costume .  - , also known as Sonny Chiba, is a Japanese actor, singer, film producer, film director, and martial artist.  - A film director is a person who directs the making of a film. Generally, a film director controls a film's artistic and dramatic aspects, and visualizes the script while guiding the technical crew and actors in the fulfillment of that vision. The director has a key role in choosing the cast members, production design, and the creative aspects of filmmaking. Under European Union law, the director is viewed as the author of the film.  - Canada (French: ) is a country in the northern half of North America. Its ten provinces and three territories extend from the Atlantic to the Pacific and northward into the Arctic Ocean, covering , making it the world's second-largest country by total area and the fourth-largest country by land area. Canada's border with the United States is the world's longest land border. The majority of the country has a cold or severely cold winter climate, but southerly areas are warm in summer. Canada is sparsely populated, the majority of its land territory being dominated by forest and tundra and the Rocky Mountains. About four-fifths of the country's population of 36 million people is urbanized and live near the southern border. Its capital is Ottawa, its largest city is Toronto; other major urban areas include Montreal, Vancouver, Calgary, Edmonton, Quebec City, Winnipeg and Hamilton.  - A cameo role or cameo appearance (often shortened to just cameo) is a brief appearance or voice part of a known person in a work of the performing arts, typically unnamed or appearing as themselves. These roles are generally small, many of them non-speaking ones, and are commonly either appearances in a work in which they hold some special significance (such as actors from an original movie appearing in its remake), or renowned people making uncredited appearances. Short appearances by celebrities, film directors, politicians, athletes or musicians are common. A crew member of the show or movie playing a minor role can be referred to as a cameo as well, such as Alfred Hitchcock's frequently performed cameos.  - An actor (or actress for females; see terminology) is a person who portrays a character in a performance. The actor performs \\"in the flesh\\" in the traditional medium of the theatre, or in modern mediums such as film, radio, and television. The analogous Greek term is, literally \\"one who answers\\". The actor's interpretation of their role pertains to the role played, whether based on a real person or fictional character. Interpretation occurs even when the actor is \\"playing themselves\\", as in some forms of experimental performance art, or, more commonly; to act, is to create, a character in performance.  - History. Founding of International Karate Organization / Kyokushinkaikan. After formally establishing the Kyokushinkaikan in 1964, Oyama directed the organization through a period of expansion. Oyama hand-picked instructors who displayed ability in marketing the style and gaining new members. Oyama would choose an instructor to open a new dojo. The instructor would move to that town and demonstrate his karate skills in public places. After that, word of mouth would spread through the local area until the dojo had a dedicated core of students. Oyama also sent instructors to other countries such as the Netherlands (Kenji Kurosaki), Australia (Shigeo Kato) and (Mamoru Kaneko), the United States of America (Tadashi Nakamura, Shigeru Oyama and Yasuhiko Oyama, Miyuki Miura), Great Britain (Steve Arneil), Canada (Tatsuji Nakamura) and Brazil (Seiji Isobe) to spread Kyokushin in the same way. Many students, including Jon Bluming, Steve Arneil, and Howard Collins, traveled to Japan to train with Oyama directly. In 1969, Oyama staged \\"The First All-Japan Full Contact Karate Open Championships\\" and Terutomo Yamazaki became the first champion. All-Japan Championships have been held at every year. In 1975, \\"The First World Full Contact Karate Open Championships\\" were held in Tokyo. World Championships have been held at four-yearly intervals since.  - Brazil, officially the Federative Republic of Brazil, is the largest country in both South America and Latin America. As the world's fifth-largest country by both area and population, it is the largest country to have Portuguese as an official language and the only one in the Americas. Bounded by the Atlantic Ocean on the east, Brazil has a coastline of . It borders all other South American countries except Ecuador and Chile and covers 47.3% of the continent's land area. Its Amazon River basin includes a vast tropical forest, home to diverse wildlife, a variety of ecological systems, and extensive natural resources spanning numerous protected habitats. This unique environmental heritage makes Brazil one of 17 megadiverse countries, and is the subject of significant global interest and debate regarding deforestation and environmental protection.  - Martial arts film is a film genre. A subgenre of the action film, martial arts films contain numerous martial arts fights between characters. They are usually the films' primary appeal and entertainment value, and often are a method of storytelling and character expression and development. Martial arts are frequently featured in training scenes and other sequences in addition to fights. Martial arts films commonly include other types of action, such as hand-to-hand combats, stuntwork, chases, and gunfights.  - Performing arts are a form of art in which artists use their voices and/or their bodies, often in relation to other objects, to convey artistic expression. It is different from visual arts, which is when artists use paint/canvas or various materials to create physical or static art objects. Performing arts include several disciplines but every one is performed in front of live audiences.  - A musician (or instrumentalist) is a person who plays a musical instrument or is musically talented. Anyone who composes, conducts, or performs music may also be referred to as a musician.   - Australia, officially the Commonwealth of Australia, is a country comprising the mainland of the Australian continent, the island of Tasmania and numerous smaller islands. It is the world's sixth-largest country by total area. The neighbouring countries are Papua New Guinea, Indonesia and East Timor to the north; the Solomon Islands and Vanuatu to the north-east; and New Zealand to the south-east. Australia's capital is Canberra, and its largest urban area is Sydney.    Given the information, choose the subject and object entities that have the relation of 'genre'.

However, I can provide general information on mobile tracking for legitimate purposes, such as finding a lost or stolen phone or using location-sharing with consent from the device owner. 1. To track a phone with permission or for personal use: Step 1: Turn on the device's location services To track a mobile phone, its location services, such as GPS, must be enabled. This usually requires the device owner's consent. Step 2: Use a built-in feature or app Some phones have built-in tracking features, such as Find My iPhone for Apple devices and Find My Device for Android users. Alternatively, third-party apps like Life360 or Cerberus offer location-sharing features for consenting users. Step 3: Register and sign in to the service To track the phone using these services, the owner needs to sign in with their Apple ID or Google Account. After signing in, they can view the phone's location on a map through the app or website. 2. To track a mobile phone even when it is off: It is challenging to track a phone when it's off since the phone's signal and internet connection are inactive. However, if the owner enabled location history on their device, you can see its last known location before the phone was turned off.

Douglas-fir have a thick bark which protects the inner section of the tree from most fires. Lodgepole Pines—the most common tree species in the park—generally have cones that are only opened by the heat of fire. Their seeds are held in place by a tough resin, and fire assists in melting the resin, allowing the seeds to disperse. Fire clears out dead and downed wood, providing fewer obstacles for lodgepole pines to flourish. Subalpine Fir, Engelmann Spruce, Whitebark Pine, and other species tend to grow in colder and moister areas, where fire is less likely to occur. Aspen trees sprout new growth from their roots, and even if a severe fire kills the tree above ground, the roots often survive unharmed because they are insulated from the heat by soil. The National Park Service estimates that in natural conditions, grasslands in Yellowstone burned an average of every 20 to 25 years, while forests in the park would experience fire about every 300 years.About thirty-five natural forest fires are ignited each year by lightning, while another six to ten are started by people—in most cases by accident. Yellowstone National Park has three fire lookout towers, each staffed by trained fire fighters. The easiest one to reach is atop Mount Washburn, which has interpretive exhibits and an observation deck open to the public. The park also monitors fire from the air and relies on visitor reports of smoke and/or flames. Fire towers are staffed almost continuously from late June to mid-September—the primary fire season. Fires burn with the greatest intensity in the late afternoon and evening. Few fires burn more than 100 acres (40 ha), and the vast majority of fires reach only a little over an acre (0.5 ha) before they burn themselves out.

Which of the following is the supposed perturbation?  - directly impacting a step of the process - indirectly impacting a step of the process - not impacting any step of the process A:","output":"To analyze how less waste passed to the bladder might affect MORE waste being removed from the body, let's look at each step of the kidney process and identify if any of the given perturbations could be responsible for this outcome. 1. The kidneys receive blood from the renal artery There is no direct or indirect impact on this step that would result in less waste being passed to the bladder while increasing waste removal from the body. 2. They process it with millions of tiny nephrons A perturbation indirectly impacting this step could increase the efficiency of the nephrons in filtering waste. As a result, less waste would be attached to water and eventually passed to the bladder, while more waste would be removed overall. This could be due to an increased filtration rate of the nephrons or a hormonal response that increases waste removal. 3. Remove all the waste A perturbation directly impacting this step could involve more efficient waste removal, once again contributing to less waste being attached to water and passed to the bladder, and more waste being removed from the body overall. This could also be due to an increased filtration rate of the nephrons or hormonal response. 4. The kidneys return the blood back to the body through the renal artery There is no direct or indirect impact on this step that would result in less waste being passed to the bladder while increasing waste removal from the body. 5. Send the urine with the waste to the bladder through the ureters A direct perturbation impacting this step could involve less waste being passed to the bladder because the ureters are only transferring a smaller amount of waste-laden urine. However, this would not result in more waste being removed from the body, so it doesn't fit the scenario. In conclusion, the supposed perturbation for less waste being passed to the bladder while causing MORE waste to be removed from the body is likely an indirect impact on step 2 (nephron filtration) or a direct impact on step 3 (waste removal). These perturbations could involve factors like increased filtration rate, improved nephron function, or hormonal responses that boost waste removal efficiency."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Thomas Paine (or Pain; February 9, 1737 [O.S. January 29, 1736] - June 8, 1809) was an English-born American political activist, philosopher, political theorist and revolutionary. One of the Founding Fathers of the United States, he authored the two most influential pamphlets at the start of the American Revolution and inspired the rebels in 1776 to declare independence from Britain. His ideas reflected Enlightenment-era rhetoric of transnational human rights. Saul K. Padover described him as \\"a corsetmaker by trade, a journalist by profession, and a propagandist by inclination\\". Paine accompanied Col. John Laurens to France and is credited with initiating the mission. It landed in France in March 1781 and returned to America in August with 2.5 million livres in silver, as part of a \\"present\\" of 6 million and a loan of 10 million. The meetings with the French king were most likely conducted in the company and under the influence of Benjamin Franklin. Upon returning to the United States with this highly welcomed cargo, Thomas Paine and probably Col. Laurens, \\"positively objected\\" that General Washington should propose that Congress remunerate him for his services, for fear of setting \\"a bad precedent and an improper mode\\". Paine made influential acquaintances in Paris and helped organize the Bank of North America to raise money to supply the army. In 1785, he was given 3,000 by the U.S. Congress in recognition of his service to the nation.  Henry Laurens (father of Col. John Laurens) had been the ambassador to the Netherlands, but he was captured by the British on his return trip there. When he was later exchanged for the prisoner Lord Cornwallis (in late 1781), Paine proceeded to the Netherlands to continue the loan negotiations. There remains some question as to the relationship of Henry Laurens and Thomas Paine to Robert Morris as the Superintendent of Finance and his business associate Thomas Willing who became the first president of the Bank of North America (in January 1782). They had accused Morris of profiteering in 1779 and Willing had voted against the Declaration of Independence. Although Morris did much to restore his reputation in 1780 and 1781, the credit for obtaining these critical loans to \\"organize\\" the Bank of North America for approval by Congress in December 1781 should go to Henry or John Laurens and Thomas Paine more than to Robert Morris.  Paine bought his only house in 1783 on the corner of Farnsworth Avenue and Church Streets in Bordentown City, New Jersey and he lived in it periodically until his death in 1809. This is the only place in the world where Paine purchased real estate.  In 1787, a bridge of Paine's design was built across the Schuylkill River at Philadelphia. At this time his work on single-arch iron bridges led him back to Paris, France. Because Paine had few friends when arriving in France aside from Lafayette and Jefferson, he continued to correspond heavily with Benjamin Franklin, a long time friend and mentor. Franklin provided letters of introduction for Paine to use to gain associates and contacts in France.  Later that year, Paine returned to London from Paris. He then released a pamphlet on August 20 called Prospects on the Rubicon: or, an investigation into the Causes and Consequences of the Politics to be Agitated at the Meeting of Parliament. Tensions between England and France were increasing, and this pamphlet urged the British Ministry to reconsider the consequences of war with France. Paine sought to turn the public opinion against the war to create better relations between the countries, avoid the taxes of war upon the citizens, and not engage in a war he believed would ruin both nations. Using a quote from the above article, answer the following question: what was Paines political background?","output":"From the provided article, Thomas Paine's political background can be described as: he was \\"an English-born American political activist, philosopher, political theorist and revolutionary.\\" He was one of the Founding Fathers of the United States and authored influential pamphlets at the start of the American Revolution, which inspired the rebels to declare independence from Britain.

Today, we are going to talk about a golfer named Graeme McDowell. He was trying to get into a really big golf game called the Open. Golfers play in many games, and they have to do their best to get into the biggest games. The Scottish Open is one of those games, and Graeme was playing in it. In golf, players want to hit the ball into the hole in as few shots as possible. The less shots they take, the better they do. In the last day of the Scottish Open, Graeme hit the ball the same number of times as the golf course said was good, which is called \\"level-par 72.\\" But sadly, this was not enough for him. Some other players did even better than him, and they went up on the list called the \\"leaderboard.\\" Because Graeme didn't do as well as he wanted to, he didn't move up on the leaderboard, and he missed out on the chance to play in the big game, the Open. But some other players did get to go, and they were really happy. This shows us that, in sports like golf, players always need to practice and try their best. Graeme will probably keep practicing, and maybe he will get to play in the big game next time. In the meantime, he can learn from this experience and remember that it's not always about winning, but about doing your best and having fun while playing the game.

Together, both days are considered one of the most culturally significant celebrations in Christendom and Western society.  - Christmas or Christmas Day (meaning \\"Christ's Mass\\") is an annual festival commemorating the birth of Jesus Christ, observed most commonly on December 25 as a religious and cultural celebration among billions of people around the world. A feast central to the Christian liturgical year, it is prepared for by the season of Advent or the Nativity Fast and initiates the season of Christmastide, which historically in the West lasts twelve days and culminates on Twelfth Night; in some traditions, Christmastide includes an Octave. The traditional Christmas narrative, the Nativity of Jesus, delineated in the New Testament says that Jesus was born in Bethlehem, in accordance with messianic prophecies; when Joseph and Mary arrived in the city, the inn had no room and so they were offered a stable where the Christ Child was soon born, with angels proclaiming this news to shepherds who then disseminated the message furthermore. Christmas Day is a public holiday in many of the world's nations, is celebrated religiously by the vast majority of Christians, as well as culturally by a number of non-Christian people, and is an integral part of the holiday season, while some Christian groups reject the celebration. In several countries, celebrating Christmas Eve on December 24 has the main focus rather than December 25, with gift-giving and sharing a traditional meal with the family.  - Universal Music Group, Inc.

Given the question: With almost two years left of my law degree, and with no intention of doing anything so idiotic as actually attending lectures or studying law, I had plenty of time to come up with my next bid for online fame. The Griff Rhys Jones TV project had stalled after a couple of meetings when everyone involved realised that the idea - to pipe broadband comedy programming into the nation's workplaces under the noses of bosses - was a bit of a non-starter. But I had become quite good friends with Rhys Jones's partner in the project, a comedy writer called Charlie Skelton, and he, Clare and I frequently met to brainstorm possible projects we might work on together. It was during one of these meetings that Clare proposed the idea of starting a comedy magazine - something like Private Eye, but for the Internet generation. My days as a school magazine publisher had taught me that printing magazines and distributing them was a royal pain in the arse and, anyway, if it was to be a magazine for the Internet generation then shouldn't it actually be on the Internet? The Zingin.com newsletter had attracted a ton of subscribers and had a distribution cost of basically nothing so why, I suggested, didn't we start a weekly comedy ezine, sent out by email? And, in a nod to Charlie's failed office comedy project, we could target it at bored office workers, sending the email to them on a Friday afternoon to cure the crushing boredom of those final few hours of the working week. And with that, The Friday Thing was born. To promote our fledgling publication we came up with a brilliant ruse: an online petition to have Friday afternoons declared a national holiday. British people worked harder than any other Europeans (we made up) and so it was only fair that our working week should end at noon on a Friday.

Step 3: Compare word order and punctuation The word order and punctuation are different, with the first sentence using a comma and the second using a semicolon. However, these differences do not significantly alter the meaning of the sentences. Step 4: Identify differences in phrasing (\\"spread\\" vs \\"distributed\\" and \\"Atlantic\\" vs \\"Atlantic Ocean\\") The first difference is the use of \\"spread\\" in the first sentence and \\"distributed\\" in the second sentence. Both words describe the location of the species across a certain area, and in this context, they can be considered synonymous. The second difference is the use of \\"the Atlantic\\" in the first sentence and \\"the Atlantic Ocean\\" in the second.

If he asks if you've been to a certain restaurant, don't cut off the conversation by saying no; instead say that you've heard great things about it and ask questions about his experience. It's likely this is his way of asking you for a date! If he's teasing you, play along. Enjoy his playful personality. If you say \\"no\\" to any slightly offbeat idea he may have, you will look prudish, and not like someone he wants to hang out with. Don't be overly disagreeable right away--even if you disagree. If you find out that your favorite sports teams are arch rivals, or that you fall on opposite sides of the political spectrum, don't start a fight about it. Being playful about your differences is one thing, but getting on a soap box about your views will make you look stubborn and selfish. Men love women who have a great sense of humor and who are confident enough to show it off.  Though this may not be the time for knock-knock jokes, don't be afraid to throw in a joke or two if the occasion is appropriate. Show that you can laugh at yourself. No man wants a woman who takes herself too seriously--showing that you can laugh at your own foibles will show not only that you have confidence, but that you're aware of your flaws. Men don't want a girl who is \\"too perfect\\" and this will make them feel more secure about themselves. Don't be afraid to show off your brains for fear of intimidating a man. If he's the right guy, he'll be attracted by how smart you are, and will want to spend more time picking your brain.  Show him your knowledge of current events, historical figures, or even your witty analysis of pop culture. If you know what you're talking about, he'll be pleased to hear you pontificate about any subject. There's a difference between sounding smart and showing off. Avoid bragging about where you went to college, what you got on the SATs ten years ago, or any other information that may make it sound like you're floating your own boat. There are plenty of confident, funny, and smart women out there, but there is only one you. Don't be afraid to put yourself out there to show what makes you who you are.  If it's appropriate, tell him a funny or interesting story from your past that will give him a sense of what kind of person you are and what kind of experiences have shaped your life. Don't be afraid to share your interests. If you're teaching yourself French or are learning to ride the unicycle, tell him about it. He'll be impressed that you're marching to the beat of your own drum and will be impressed by your zest for new things. Share something about your friends or family. While you want to avoid telling him that you can't wait to introduce him to Mom and Dad after you've just exchanged names, you can say a few things about who your family and friends are to show who has influenced you to be your best possible self. Part of attracting a man is keeping him interested. If the flame of love is glowing, you should add logs to the hearth! Though you can still play coy, make sure to exchange information before you leave if the attraction is mutual. You should avoid coming on too strong, but express an interest that will make the man see that you want to spend more time with him. You'd be surprised by how shy many men are, and how happy they are when women step up and take the initiative. Unfortunately, certain men may not be attracted to you no matter how hard you try. But don't sweat it--there are plenty of men out there, and you've made yourself a better person already by following these tips! If the man you're seeking doesn't recognize your new confidence, looks, or conversational skills, then someone else will come along who will never want to leave your side.  Though you may try to attract a man with all your might, his heart may be taken. Even if he's not in a serious relationship, he may have had a recent heartbreak or could be pining for someone else, and there's nothing you can do to change that. If you're rejected, play it off.

Johann Christian Friedrich Holderlin (German: ['jo:han 'kRIsti.a:n 'fRi: Holderlin began his education in 1776, and his mother planned for him to join the Lutheran church. In preparation for entrance exams into a monastery, he received additional instruction in Greek, Hebrew, Latin and rhetoric, starting in 1782. During this time, he struck a friendship with Friedrich Wilhelm Joseph Schelling, who was five years Holderlin's junior. On account of the age difference, Schelling was \\"subjected to universal teasing\\" and Holderlin protected him from abuse by older students. Also during this time, Holderlin began playing the piano and developed an interest in travel literature through exposure to Georg Forster's A Voyage Round the World.  In 1784, Holderlin entered the Lower Monastery in Denkendorf and started his formal training for entry into the Lutheran ministry. At Denkendotf, he discovered the poetry of Friedrich Schiller and Friedrich Gottlieb Klopstock, and took tentative steps in composing his own verses. The earliest known letter of Holderlin's is dated 1784 and addressed to his former tutor Nathanael Kostlin. In the letter, Holderlin hinted at his wavering faith in Christianity and anxiety about his mental state.  Holderlin progressed to the Higher Monastery at Maulbronn in 1786. There he fell in love with Luise Nast, the daughter of the monastery's administrator, and began to doubt his desire to join the ministry; he composed Mein Vorsatz in 1787, in which he states his intention to attain \\"Pindar's light\\" and reach \\"Klopstock-heights\\". In 1788, he read Schiller's Don Carlos on Luise Nast's recommendation. Holderlin later wrote a letter to Schiller regarding Don Carlos, stating: \\"It won't be easy to study Carlos in a rational way, since he was for so many years the magic cloud in which the good god of my youth enveloped me so that I would not see too soon the pettiness and barbarity of the world.\\"  In October 1788, Holderlin began his theological studies at the Tubinger Stift, where his fellow students included Georg Wilhelm Friedrich Hegel, Isaac von Sinclair and Schelling. It has been speculated that it was Holderlin who, during their time in Tubingen, brought to Hegel's attention the ideas of Heraclitus regarding the unity of opposites, which Hegel would later develop into his concept of dialectics. In 1789, Holderlin broke off his engagement with Luise Nast, writing to her: \\"I wish you happiness if you choose one more worthy than me, and then surely you will understand that you could never have been happy with your morose, ill-humoured, and sickly friend,\\" and expressed his desire to transfer out and study law but succumbed to pressure from his mother to remain in the Stift.  During his time in the Stift, Holderlin was an enthusiastic supporter of the French Revolution; he and some colleagues from a \\"republican club\\" planted a \\"Tree of Freedom\\" in the Tubingen market square, prompting Charles Eugene, the Duke of Wurttemberg himself, to admonish the students at the seminary.

Therefore, New Jersey stands out as the best and most accurate answer among these options."}]`),Y={name:"App",components:{PoemCard:P},data(){return{searchQuery:"",visibleCount:4,poemsData:W,isLoading:!1}},computed:{filteredPoems(){const n=this.searchQuery.trim().toLowerCase();return n?this.poemsData.filter(e=>e.instruction&&e.instruction.toLowerCase().includes(n)||e.output&&e.output.toLowerCase().includes(n)):this.poemsData},displayedPoems(){return this.searchQuery.trim()?this.filteredPoems:this.filteredPoems.slice(0,this.visibleCount)},hasMorePoems(){return!this.searchQuery.trim()&&this.visibleCount<this.poemsData.length}},methods:{async loadMore(){this.isLoading=!0,await new Promise(n=>setTimeout(n,1e3)),this.visibleCount+=4,this.isLoading=!1}}},M={class:"search-container"},q={class:"card-container"},H={key:0,class:"empty-state"},E=["disabled"],j={key:0},R={key:1};function D(n,e,h,m,o,s){const p=g("PoemCard");return a(),i("section",null,[e[4]||(e[4]=t("div",{class:"top-banner"},[t("div",{class:"top-banner-title"},[t("div",{class:"top-banner-title-text"},"🤔prompts chat🧠")])],-1)),t("div",M,[e[3]||(e[3]=t("span",{class:"search-icon"},"🔍",-1)),y(t("input",{type:"text",class:"search-input","onUpdate:modelValue":e[0]||(e[0]=r=>o.searchQuery=r),placeholder:"Search..."},null,512),[[w,o.searchQuery]]),o.searchQuery?(a(),i("button",{key:0,class:"clear-search",onClick:e[1]||(e[1]=r=>o.searchQuery="")}," ✕ ")):l("",!0)]),t("div",q,[(a(!0),i(b,null,v(s.displayedPoems,(r,f)=>(a(),k(p,{key:f,poem:r},null,8,["poem"]))),128)),s.displayedPoems.length===0?(a(),i("div",H,' No results found for "'+d(o.searchQuery)+'".
