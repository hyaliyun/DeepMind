The sum of these 9 digits is 45, meaning the number of digits in odd and even positions must be either 4 or 5. Assuming the sum of the digits in odd positions is a and the sum of the digits in even positions is b, we have a + b = 45. It is known that a and b must be one odd and one even, and the minimum possible value for a or b is 1 + 2 + 3 + 4 = 10. Therefore, the only possible solution for a and b is 28 and 17. To make the nine-digit number as large as possible, the digits 9, 8, 7, 6, 5 should be placed as early as possible, and the digits 4, 3, 2, 1 should be placed later. In other words, the first three odd positions should ideally be filled with 9, 7, 5, and the first two even positions should ideally be filled with 8, 6. Next, we check if it is possible to combine them to get 28 and 17 respectively: 1. For the odd positions: 28 - (9 + 7 + 5) = 7, which can only be split into 3 + 4; 2.

For a hexagon (n=6), this sum is 180(6-2) = 180(4) = 720^circ. Since the hexagon is regular, all interior angles are equal, so each angle measures frac{720^circ}{6} = 120^circ. 2. **Determine the measure of the base angles in triangle POQ**: Since overline{PO} and overline{PQ} are congruent sides of the regular hexagon, triangle POQ is an isosceles triangle. The sum of the angles in any triangle is 180^circ, and given that one of the angles (angle OPQ) measures 120^circ, the sum of the two base angles is 180^circ - 120^circ = 60^circ. Since the triangle is isosceles, these angles are congruent, so each measures frac{60^circ}{2} = 30^circ. **Approach 1**: - **Use the properties of isosceles trapezoid PQLO**: Since overline{PO} and overline{QL} are congruent sides of the regular hexagon, trapezoid PQLO is an isosceles trapezoid, implying its base angles are equal. Thus, if we let the measure of angle LOQ be x^circ and the measure of angle OQL be y^circ, we have x + 30 = y. - **Solve for x using the right angle at OQL**: Since angle OQL is a right angle (as indicated by the diagram), and the acute angles of a right triangle sum to 90^circ, we have x + y = 90^circ. Substituting y = x + 30 into this equation gives x + (x + 30) = 90^circ Rightarrow 2x + 30 = 90^circ Rightarrow 2x = 60^circ Rightarrow x = 30^circ. Therefore, the degree measure of angle LOQ is boxed{30^circ}. **Approach 2**: - **Use the properties of isosceles trapezoid LMNO**: Since overline{NO} and overline{ML} are congruent sides of the regular hexagon, trapezoid LMNO is an isosceles trapezoid, implying its base angles are equal. Let the measure of angle N (or M) be z^circ. - **Calculate z using the sum of angles in trapezoid LMNO**: The sum of the interior angles in any quadrilateral is 360^circ. Given that the two top angles of trapezoid LMNO each measure 120^circ, we have 2z + 120 + 120 = 360 Rightarrow 2z = 120 Rightarrow z = 60^circ. - **Solve for x**: Knowing that angle O measures 120^circ and z = 60^circ, we have z + x + 30 = 120^circ. Substituting z = 60^circ gives 60 + x + 30 = 120 Rightarrow x + 90 = 120 Rightarrow x = 30^circ.

For simplicity, assume the five numbers are (a_1, a_2, a_3, a_4, a_5).

According to the statements, everyone says: \\"My number is greater than the numbers of my two neighbors.\\"    - If A (the person with the smallest number) says this, it must be a lie because it’s impossible for the smallest number to be greater than its neighbors.

According to the problem, the 120 new 120-digit numbers are formed by permuting the first 12 digits while keeping the remaining 108 digits constant. 3. Let S denote the sum of these 120 new 120-digit numbers. We can express S as follows:    [    S = (A_1 + A_2 + cdots + A_{120}) cdot 10^{108} + 120B    ] 4. We need to show that S is divisible by 120. For this, we consider the individual terms.    - First, observe that each A_i is formed by permuting the digits of the original set of 12 digits, implying that these digits are the same set in each A_i. 5. Since:    [    A_1 + A_2 + cdots + A_{120}    ]    is simply the sum of all permutations of the same 12 digits, it follows that:    [    A_1 + A_2 + cdots + A_{120} equiv 0 pmod{3}    ]    because each sum of permutations includes all digits which, by property of permutations, sum to a number that is divisible by 3. 6.

Then the set of all possible values for the last digits of ( l_1 + l_2 ) is ( {0, 1, dots, 9} ) since ( l_1 + l_2 equiv n pmod{10} ).    Assume for the sake of contradiction that ( |S| = 4 ), and let ( S = {a_1, a_2, a_3, a_4} ). Then ( l_1 + l_2 = a_i + a_j ) for ( i, j in {1, 2, 3, 4} ). Since there are ( binom{4}{2} + 4 = 10 ) ways to choose the sum ( a_i + a_j ) (including the cases where ( i = j )), and they map bijectively to ( {0, 1, dots, 9} ) modulo 10, it follows that none of them are equal modulo 10. So there should be exactly 5 even numbers out of the 10 sums.     Since ( a_1 + a_1 ), ( a_2 + a_2 ), ( a_3 + a_3 ), and ( a_4 + a_4 ) are all even, exactly one of ( a_i + a_j ) where ( i neq j ) must be even. Without loss of generality, assume ( a_1 + a_2 ) is even. Then ( a_1 + a_3 ) and ( a_2 + a_4 ) are odd. But then ( a_3 + a_4 ) becomes even, a contradiction.     The value of ( |S| ) can't be less than 4 because then we will have less than 10 sums ( a_i + a_j ) where ( a_i, a_j in S ), and won't traverse the whole of ( {0, 1, dots, 9} ).    Therefore, ( |S| geq 5 ). (blacksquare) 2. **Claim 2:** A set ( S ) with ( |S| = 5 ) is possible.    **Proof:** Consider ( S = {0, 1, 3, 4, 5} ). Any digit can be made from these 5 numbers without any carries, so choosing ( N = 9 ), for any ( n > N ), and going from the right to left, for any digit ( d ) in ( n ), we can find ( a_1, a_2 in S ) such that ( a_1 + a_2 = d ), put ( a_1 ) in ( a ) and ( a_2 ) in ( b ), and continue like this to get ( a + b = n ).    In case we end up with one of ( a, b ) being zero, then ( n ) must consist of only ( 0, 1 ), and ( 3 ). In this case, if ( n ) has more than one non-zero digit, then we can put two of them in ( a, b ) each, so that ( a, b ) are both non-zero. The other possibilities are if ( n = 1000 dots 0 ) or ( n = 3000 dots 0 ). Let ( d(x) ) be the number of digits of ( x ). In the first case, take ( a = 999 dots 9 ) and ( b = 1 ), with ( d(a) = d(n) - 1 ). In the second case take ( a = 909090 dots 0909 ) and ( b = 2090909 dots 9091 ) with ( d(a) + 1 = d(b) = d(n) ).

Since the parabola is x^2 = 4y, its focus F is at the point (0,1) (using the formula (x-h)^2 = 4p(y-k), where p is the distance from the vertex to the focus along the axis of symmetry, and (h, k) is the vertex). Therefore, the directrix is the line y = -1. Given that |MF| = 4, we find point M. Since M lies on the x^2 = 4y parabola, and we know MF is perpendicular to the x-axis, F must have the same x-coordinate as M. Hence, the coordinates of M can be written as (2sqrt{3}, y_M) to satisfy |MF| = 4. Distance |MF| equates to the absolute difference in their y-coordinates, which gives us y_M - 1 = 4 and thus y_M = 3. This results in M having the coordinates (2sqrt{3}, 3). The equation of line l through the focus F (0,1) with slope k is y = kx + 1. We substitute the y from the equation of line l into the parabola's equation to find the intersection points:  x^2 = 4(kx + 1)  x^2 - 4kx - 4 = 0  Applying Vieta's formulas, since P is the midpoint of A and B, the x-coordinate of point P is just the average of the x-coordinates of points A and B, which is also equal to 2k by Vieta's formulas (because the sum of roots frac{-b}{a} = 2k, where a is the coefficient of x^2 and b is the coefficient of x). Since P lies on the perpendicular from the x-axis to M, its x-coordinate is the same as point M: 2sqrt{3}. This means 2k = 2sqrt{3}. Solving for k, we find k = sqrt{3}.

There are two cases to consider. # Case 1: The convex hull contains points of both colors If the convex hull ( mathcal{H} ) is not composed entirely of points of the same color, then there exist at least two edges of ( mathcal{H} ) which have endpoints of different colors (one blue and one red).  1. Choose an edge of ( mathcal{H} ) whose endpoints are of different colors, say endpoints ( A ) (blue) and ( B ) (red). 2. The line through points ( A ) and ( B ) clearly passes through one blue point and one red point. 3. By the properties of the convex hull:    - One side of this line contains some points of the convex hull.    - The other side contains the rest of the points. Since the points on each side initially split equally: [ n-1 text{ blue points} quad text{and} quad n-1 text{ red points} ] Therefore, the line through ( A ) and ( B ) is a balancing line. # Case 2: The convex hull contains points of only one color Assume without loss of generality (WLOG) that the convex hull ( mathcal{H} ) is composed entirely of blue points. To prove the existence of balancing lines, consider the following: 1. **Vertex Consideration:**    - Take any vertex ( B ) of ( mathcal{H} ). 2. **Rotating Line Argument:** - Arrange ( A, B, C ) as three consecutive blue vertices of ( mathcal{H} ). - Imagine a line ( ell ) initially passing through ( B ) and ( A ), and then rotating ( ell ) through ( B ) until it coincides with the line passing through ( B ) and ( C ). 3. **Counting process:**    - Count the number of points on the same side of ( ell ) as ( C ). Introduce a variable ( x ) to denote the number of red points minus the number of blue points on that side.    - As the line ( ell ) rotates:      - When ( ell ) passes through a blue point (e.g., in rotating from ( B ) to ( C )), the count ( x ) increases by 1.      - When ( ell ) passes through a red point, ( x ) decreases by 1. 4. **Initial and Final Values:**    - Initially, when ( ell ) passes through ( B ) and ( A ), there are no red points on the same side as ( C ), so ( x = 1 ).    - Just before the end (before ( ell ) passes through ( B ) and ( C )), ( x = -1 ). 5. **Intermediate Value:**    - By the intermediate value theorem, as ( x ) transitions from ( 1 ) to ( -1 ), there must be at least one moment when ( x = 0 ). At this point, the number of red points equals the number of blue points on one side of the line ( ell ). Therefore, the moment where ( x = 0 ) indicates the presence of a balancing line. Given that ( | mathcal{H} | geq 3 ) (since we are dealing with a polygon with more than two sides), we can rotate about every vertex and locate balancing lines through every vertex of ( mathcal{H} ). **Conclusion:** There must be at least two balancing lines through the given setup, satisfying the conditions of the problem.

Prove that the lines  A_{1}K_{a}, B_{1}K_{b}, C_{1}K_{c}  intersect on the incircle of triangle  ABC .","output":"1. **Understanding the Problem:**    We are given a scalene triangle (ABC) with angle bisectors (AD), (BE), and (CF) intersecting the opposite sides at points (D), (E), and (F) respectively. Points (K_a), (K_b), and (K_c) lie on the incircle of (triangle ABC) such that (DK_a), (EK_b), and (FK_c) are tangent to the incircle. We need to prove that the lines (A_1K_a), (B_1K_b), and (C_1K_c) intersect at a single point on the incircle, where (A_1), (B_1), and (C_1) are the midpoints of sides (BC), (CA), and (AB) respectively. 2. **Angle Relationships:**    We start by analyzing the angles formed by the tangents and the sides of the triangle. For instance, consider the angle (angle ABK_b):    [    angle ABK_b = frac{angle B}{2} + angle EBK_b    ]    This is because (BE) is the angle bisector, and (angle EBK_b) is the angle between the tangent (EK_b) and the side (BC). 3. **Using Desargues' Theorem:**    To show that the lines (A_1K_a), (B_1K_b), and (C_1K_c) are concurrent, we use Desargues' theorem. We need to show that the triangles formed by these lines are perspective from a point.  4. **Parallelism and Harmonic Conjugates:**    We observe that:    [    angle K_aK_bB = angle LK_bB - angle LK_bK_a    ]    where (L) is the intersection of the angle bisectors (EE) and (DD). By calculating these angles, we find:    [    angle LK_bB = 180^circ - angle EK_bB = angle EBK_b + angle BEK_b    ]    and    [    angle BEK_b = 180^circ - angle A - frac{angle B}{2} = angle C + frac{angle B}{2}    ]    Thus,    [    angle LK_bK_a = frac{180^circ - angle ELD}{2} = angle C    ]    Therefore,    [    angle K_aK_bB = angle ABK_b    ]    This implies that (AB parallel K_aK_b). 5. **Concurrent Lines:**    By similar arguments, we find that:    [    JH parallel K_bK_c quad text{and} quad GJ parallel K_cK_a    ]    Hence, the points (GH cap K_aK_b = infty), (JH cap K_bK_c = infty), and (GJ cap K_cK_a = infty) are collinear. By Desargues' theorem, the lines (GK_a), (HK_b), and (JK_c) are concurrent at a point (M). 6. **Point (M) on the Incircle:**    To show that (M) lies on the incircle, we use the concept of harmonic conjugates. Consider the tangents from the midpoints (G), (H), and (J) to the incircle. The cyclic quadrilateral (G_aK_aA'M^*) is harmonic, where (M^*) is the intersection of (GK_a) with the incircle. By similar arguments for (B) and (C), we conclude that the lines (AG_a), (BG_b), and (CG_c) are concurrent. 7. **Final Conclusion:**    Since the lines (GK_a), (HK_b), and (JK_c) are concurrent at (M) and (M) lies on the incircle, we have shown that the lines (A_1K_a), (B_1K_b), and (C_1K_c) intersect at a single point on the incircle.

The center of mass of these points is denoted as ( G ).

Let's denote the given lines as ( l_1 ) and ( l_2 ).         - The center of mass of points ( A_i ) on line ( l_1 ) is ( C_1 ) with mass ( P(C_1) ).    - The center of mass of points ( A_i ) on line ( l_2 ) is ( C_2 ) with mass ( P(C_2) ).

For 5 pens and 1 notebook, the cost is 90 dollars: 5x + y = 90. To solve this system, we can use the method of substitution or elimination. Here, we'll use elimination: - Multiply the second equation by 3 to make the coefficients of y equal: 15x + 3y = 270. - Subtract the first equation from this new equation to eliminate y: (15x + 3y) - (2x + 3y) = 270 - 62. - Simplify: 13x = 208. - Solve for x: x = frac{208}{13} = 16. - Substitute x = 16 back into one of the original equations to find y: 5(16) + y = 90 Rightarrow 80 + y = 90 Rightarrow y = 10.

A total rotation around points (O_{1}, O_{2}, O_{3}, O_{4}) sums up the internal angles of a quadrilateral:    [    +90^circ - 90^circ + 90^circ - 90^circ = 0^circ    ] 5. Therefore, the total effect of the rotations is identity, meaning the vertices are transformed back to themselves. 6. Now, consider the sum of the first two rotations around (O_{1}) and (O_{2}):    [    +90^circ - 90^circ = 0^circ quad text{(translation)}    ] 7. Similarly, the sum of the last two rotations around (O_{3}) and (O_{4}) is:    [    +90^circ - 90^circ = 0^circ quad text{(translation in the opposite direction)}    ] 8. These translations indicate a parallel relationship between the lines connecting the midpoints of the semicircles:    [    O_{1}O_{2} parallel O_{3}O_{4}    ] 9. In the same manner, for the other pair of midpoints:    [    O_{2}O_{3} parallel O_{4}O_{1}    ] 10. Given the parallel relationship between the opposite sides (O_{1}O_{2} parallel O_{3}O_{4}) and (O_{2}O_{3} parallel O_{4}O_{1}), we can conclude that the quadrilateral (O_{1}O_{2}O_{3}O_{4}) forms a parallelogram. **Conclusion:** [ boxed{text{The midpoints of the semicircles are the vertices of a parallelogram.}} ]"},{"instruction":"Given that the function f(x)=xln xax^{2} is a decreasing function.

Since f(x) is a decreasing function, we have f′(x)leqslant 0 for all x > 0. This implies that 2ageqslant frac{1+ln x}{x} for all x > 0. Let g(x)=frac{1+ln x}{x}, then g′(x)=frac{-ln x}{x^{2}}. When 0 < x < 1, g′(x) > 0, g(x) is increasing. When x > 1, g′(x) < 0, g(x) is decreasing. Therefore, g(x) attains its maximum value at x=1, which is 1. Thus, we have 2ageqslant 1, which gives ageqslant frac{1}{2}. (II) Let h(x)=xln x- frac{1}{2}x^{2}, then h′(x)=1+ln x-x, and h″(x)= frac{1}{x}-1. When x > 1, h″(x) < 0, which implies that h′(x) < h′(1)=0. Therefore, h(x) is decreasing on (1,+infty), and we have h(x) < h(1)=- frac{1}{2}. This implies that for x > 1, xln x- frac{1}{2}x^{2} < - frac{1}{2}, or equivalently, xln x < frac{1}{2}x^{2}- frac{1}{2}. Thus, for xgeqslant 2, we have frac{1}{xln x} > frac{2}{x^{2}-1}. Therefore, for ngeqslant 2, we have frac{1}{nln n} > frac{2}{n^{2}-1}= frac{1}{n-1}- frac{1}{n+1}, which implies that frac {1}{2ln 2}+ frac {1}{3ln 3}+…+ frac {1}{nln n} > 1- frac{1}{3}+ frac{1}{2}- frac{1}{4}+ frac{1}{3}- frac{1}{5}+…+ frac{1}{n-2}- frac{1}{n}+ frac{1}{n-1}- frac{1}{n+1} =1+ frac{1}{2}- frac{1}{n}- frac{1}{n+1}=boxed{frac {3n^{2}-n-2}{2n(n+1)}}.

When 12.5 kg of pure salt is added, the total amount of salt becomes (0.10 * W) + 12.5 kg. The total weight of the new solution is W + 12.5 kg (since we added 12.5 kg of salt to the initial solution). We want this new solution to be a 20% solution.

So the amount of money he had left after buying DVDs is: ((3/4)M - 10) - (2/5)((3/4)M - 10) - 8 We know that after all the spending, Jason was left with 130. So we can set up the equation: ((3/4)M - 10) - (2/5)((3/4)M - 10) - 8 = 130 Now let's solve for M.

Since each term depends only on the previous term, the sequence becomes periodic from this point, with a period length of 2. This means the sequence repeats every two terms. Given this periodicity, we can determine the position of z_{111} in the sequence.

If O, O' and O coincide, what is the intersection of the circumspheres of the three tetrahedra?","output":"Let's break down the solution step-by-step. 1. **Understanding the planes and spheres relationship:**    - Given that the plane through point (A) is perpendicular to line segment (XA), this implies that point (A) lies on a sphere with diameter (OX).    - Similarly, points (B) and (C) also lie on the sphere with diameter (OX) because the planes through (B) and (C) are normal to (XB) and (XC) respectively.    - Thus, the circumsphere of tetrahedron (XABC) has (O) and (X) such that line segment (OX) is the diameter of the circumsphere. 2. **Analysis for points on the spheres:**    - Similarly, for tetrahedra (X'A'B'C') and (X\\"A\\"B\\"C\\"):      - The plane through (A') is perpendicular to (X'A'), implying (A') lies on the sphere with diameter (OX').      - The same logic follows for (B') and (C') lying on the sphere with diameter (OX').      - Hence, (O) is also the center of the circumsphere of tetrahedron (X'A'B'C').    - For tetrahedron (X\\"A\\"B\\"C\\"):      - Points (A\\"), (B\\"), and (C\\") lie on the sphere with diameter (OX\\").      - Hence, (O) is also the center of the circumsphere of tetrahedron (X\\"A\\"B\\"C\\"). 3. **Cases of intersections:**    - **Case 1:** If (X = X' = X\\"), then the three spheres are indeed one and the same. Since these spheres coincide, their intersection is, logically, just the sphere with diameter (OX).    - **Case 2:** If (O) lies on the line formed by (XX'X''), the spheres are nested with (O) being a common meeting point. Here, intersecting at point (O) means the three spheres intersect only at (O).    - **Case 3:** If (O) does not lie on the line (XX'X\\"), then the centers of the three spheres (which are the midpoints of (OX), (OX'), and (OX\\")) are collinear. Thus:      - The spheres intersect in a circle which has its center on the line of the centers of the three spheres.      - Since (O) lies on this circle and the circle is formed by rotating (O) around the line determined by the centers, the intersection sphere would form a circle when rotating points around this line. **Conclusion:** Considering the three distinct cases, **if (O), (O'), and (O\\") coincide**, the intersection structure depends on the spatial relationship of (O) with the line (XX'X'').

Since the statements contradict each other, it implies that:     - Either all octopuses are lying, which means they all have 7 legs.     - Or exactly one octopus is telling the truth. 3. **Case Analysis:**     **Case 1: All octopuses are lying (all have 7 legs)**          If all octopuses are lying:     [     L_B = L_G = L_Y = L_R = 7     ]     Then:     [     L_B + L_G + L_Y + L_R = 4 times 7 = 28     ]     This means the Blue octopus would be telling the truth, which contradicts the assumption that all are lying.

So, his total income for 6 months = ( I times 6 < 510 ). For the next 4 months, his total expenditure was ( 60 times 4 ). So, the total expenditure for 4 months = ( 60 times 4 = 240 ).

What is the percentage of married women below the age of 30?","output":"First, let's find out the number of women and men employees. Number of women employees = 58% of 7,520 = 0.58 * 7,520 = 4,361.6 Since the number of employees can't be a fraction, we'll round it to the nearest whole number. So, there are approximately 4,362 women employees. Number of men employees = 42% of 7,520 = 0.42 * 7,520 = 3,158.4 Again, rounding to the nearest whole number, there are approximately 3,158 men employees. Now, let's find out the number of married employees. Number of married employees = 60% of 7,520 = 0.60 * 7,520 = 4,512 Among the men, 2/3 are single, so 1/3 are married. Number of married men = 1/3 of 3,158 = 1,052.67 Rounding to the nearest whole number, there are approximately 1,053 married men. Since we know the total number of married employees, we can find the number of married women by subtracting the number of married men from the total number of married employees. Number of married women = Number of married employees - Number of married men = 4,512 - 1,053 = 3,459 Now, we know that 1/5 of the women are single and below the age of 30, and 1/3 are married and above the age of 50. We need to find the percentage of married women below the age of 30. Since we are given specific conditions for single women below 30 and married women above 50, but not for married women below 30, we cannot directly calculate the percentage of married women below 30 from the given information. We would need additional information about the age distribution of the married women to determine the percentage of those who are below the age of 30.  Therefore, with the given information, we cannot determine the percentage of married women below the age of boxed{30} ."},{"instruction":"For the first ( k ) prime numbers ( 2, 3, 5, cdots, p_{k} ) where ( k > 4 ), find all possible products of these primes such that each prime appears no more than once in each product (for example, ( 3 cdot 5, 3 cdot 5 cdot p_{k}, 11 cdot 13, 7 ), etc.).

Step 1: Set Up First, let's understand ( S+1 ): [ S + 1 = (2+1)(3+1)(5+1)(7+1) cdots (p_k+1). ]  Step 2: Identify the Properties of Each Term Notice that each of the primes greater than 2, namely ( 3, 5, 7, ldots, p_k ), are all odd numbers. Consequently, adding 1 to each of these primes results in even numbers: [ 3+1 = 4, quad 5+1 = 6, quad 7+1 = 8, quad ldots, quad p_k + 1. ] Since 2 is already even, we focus on the odd primes.

Step 4: Ensure at Least (2k) Prime Factors The product ( (2+1)(3+1)(5+1)(7+1)cdots(p_k+1) ) simplifies via multiplication, and since each transformed term includes at least one '2' (the minimal prime factor from the transformation), this transformation guarantees an expansion of factors. For instance, ( 4 = 2^2 ), ( 6 = 2 cdot 3 ), ( 8 = 2^3 ), so on and so forth.

We need to find the smallest ( N ) such that after performing certain polynomial operations, all integers between (-2016) and (2016) are written on the blackboard. 2. **Choosing ( N = 2 )**: Let's consider ( N = 2 ) and the numbers ( 0 ) and ( A ), where ( A ) is a positive integer. We need ( A ) to be divisible by all integers from ( 1 ) to ( 2016 ). This ensures that ( A ) is a multiple of the least common multiple (LCM) of these numbers. 3. **Generating Roots**:    - **Root ( x = -1 )**: Consider the polynomial ( Ax + A ). The root of this polynomial is ( x = -1 ). Thus, (-1) can be written on the blackboard.    - **Root ( x = 1 )**: Consider the polynomial ( -x^A - x^{A-1} - cdots - x + A ). The root of this polynomial is ( x = 1 ). Thus, ( 1 ) can be written on the blackboard. 4. **Inductive Step**:    - Assume all integers with absolute value less than ( k ) are already on the board.    - Write ( frac{A}{k} ) in base ( k ) as ( (b_n b_{n-1} cdots b_1)_k ). Consider the polynomial ( -b_n x^n - b_{n-1} x^{n-1} - cdots - b_1 x + A ). The root of this polynomial is ( x = k ). Thus, ( k ) can be written on the blackboard.    - Similarly, by changing the signs of the coefficients, we can obtain ( -k ). 5. **Ensuring Divisibility**:    - It is sufficient for ( A ) to be divisible by every prime number less than or equal to ( 2016 ). This ensures that ( A ) is divisible by the LCM of all integers from ( 1 ) to ( 2016 ). 6. **Lemma Application**:    - **Lemma**: Suppose ( D ) is a positive integer and ( a_n, a_{n-1}, cdots, a_0 ) are complex numbers such that for each ( j ), ( D a_j ) is an algebraic integer and if ( a_j neq 0 ), then ( frac{D}{a_j} ) is also an algebraic integer.

Then ( D^2 lambda ) is an algebraic integer, and if ( lambda neq 0 ), then ( frac{D^2}{lambda} ) is also an algebraic integer.    - **Proof**: Given ( a_n (D^2 lambda)^n + a_{n-1} D^2 (D^2 lambda)^{n-1} + cdots + a_0 D^{2n} = 0 ), we can rewrite it as ( (D^2 lambda)^n + frac{a_{n-1} D^2}{a_n} (D^2 lambda)^{n-1} + cdots + frac{a_0 D^{2n}}{a_n} = 0 ). Each coefficient ( frac{a_{n-k} D^{2n-2k}}{a_n} ) is an algebraic integer, making ( D^2 lambda ) an algebraic integer. The argument for ( frac{D^2}{lambda} ) is symmetric. 7. **Conclusion**: If ( A ) is not divisible by a prime ( p ), then ( p ) cannot be written on the board.

Lemma: Let’s prove the following intermediate result: **Lemma:** If in a family of rectangles, any two can be intersected by a vertical line, all of them can be intersected by a single vertical line. **Proof of Lemma:** 1. Consider the rectangle with the leftmost right boundary and the rectangle with the rightmost left boundary. 2. By the given condition, we can intersect these two rectangles with a vertical line. 3. Therefore, for any remaining rectangle, its left boundary will be to the left of this vertical line, and its right boundary will be to the right of it. 4. Hence, this vertical line will intersect all the rectangles. blacksquare With the lemma proven, let’s proceed to solve the main problem.  Main Solution: Assume the contrary to the main problem. We will consider pairs of \\"separated\\" rectangles, meaning rectangles that a vertical line cannot intersect together. **Case 1: No Separated Pairs Exist Below a Certain Line** 1. Choose the lowest horizontal line ( h ) such that it intersects at least one rectangle, separating the remaining rectangles into those above and below ( h ). 2. Assume there are no pairs of separated rectangles below ( h ). 3. If there are no separated pairs of rectangles below ( h ), by our lemma, there exists a vertical line that intersects all rectangles below ( h ). 4. Hence, at least one of the initially considered horizontal and vertical lines will intersect every rectangle, and we are done by contradiction. **Case 2: A Pair of Separated Rectangles Exists Below Line ( h )** 1. Consider a pair of separated rectangles, say ( A ) and ( B ), below ( h ). 2. Since ( A ) and ( B ) are separated by the selection of ( h ), and ( A ) lies above ( h ), ( B ) must lie below ( h ), creating a contradiction. Therefore, in both cases, we reach a contradiction.

The complementary events, where A or B misses, are denoted as overline{A} and overline{B}, respectively. Given that the probability of A hitting the target is frac{3}{4}, the probability of A missing the target is 1 - frac{3}{4} = frac{1}{4}.

The sequence of events for stopping after four shots is overline{A}overline{B}overline{A}B.

Since they are distributing 400 boxes, the total cost without the discount is 400 * 252 = 100,800. Now, let's calculate the discount they receive for the additional supplies when they purchase for more than 200 boxes: The cost of additional supplies for one box is 165. For 400 boxes, it would be 400 * 165 = 66,000. The discount is 10%, so the discount amount is 10/100 * 66,000 = 6,600. The discounted cost for the additional supplies is 66,000 - 6,600 = 59,400. Now, let's calculate the total cost with the discount: The cost of food for 400 boxes is 400 * 80 = 32,000. The cost of shipping for 400 boxes is 400 * 7 = 2,800. The total cost with the discount is 32,000 (food) + 59,400 (discounted additional supplies) + 2,800 (shipping) = 94,200. After distributing the initial 400 boxes, the organization receives a donation of 4 times what they spent, which is 4 * 94,200 = 376,800. The donation is in euros, so we need to convert it to dollars. The conversion rate is 1.2 dollars for 1 euro, so the donation in dollars is 376,800 * 1.2 = 452,160. Now, let's calculate how many additional boxes they can pack with the donation: Since they now have a large amount of money, they will continue to receive the 10% discount on additional supplies. Therefore, the cost per box remains the same as after the discount, which is 252 - 16.5 (discount per box on additional supplies) = 235.5 per box. The number of additional boxes they can pack with the donation is 452,160 / 235.5 ≈ 1919 boxes.

Since there are 12 squares surrounding the central square, each quadrant will contain 3 squares. 3. **Color Distribution**: Given that there are 8 red squares and 5 blue squares, and each quadrant must look the same, we distribute the colors in each quadrant.

Proof 1: If (ab + cd) is a prime number, then: [ ab + cd = m(a+d+b-c) ] where (m in mathbb{N}^cdot).

Consider the coordinates of the rooms in the grid.

How many different delivery sequences are possible?","output":"To solve this problem, we need to consider the constraints and rules given for the postman's delivery sequence.

Each time, one can only take matches from one pile, and the number of matches taken must be a divisor of the number of matches in that pile. The person who takes the last match wins. If both players adopt the correct strategy, who will win?","output":"To determine who will win when both players use optimal strategies, let's perform a detailed analysis. Here are the steps: 1. Define the value function v(n) as the highest power of 2 that divides n, i.e.,    [    v(n) = max { k mid 2^k text{ divides } n }.    ]    This function essentially measures the largest power of 2 that is a factor of n. 2. Initially, we have two piles of matches with counts n = 100 and m = 252. Calculate v(n) and v(m):    - For n = 100: The binary representation is (100_{10} = 1100100_2). The largest power of 2 dividing 100 is (2^2 = 4), so v(100) = 2.    - For m = 252: The binary representation is (252_{10} = 11111100_2). The largest power of 2 dividing 252 is (2^2 = 4), so v(252) = 2.    Hence, we have v(100) = v(252) = 2. 3. If at any point v(n) = v(m), any move made by the first player will break this equality. Let's see why:    - Suppose the first player takes r matches from the pile with count n such that r is a divisor of 252.    - Because r must be a power of 2 divisor, v(r) le v(252) = 2.    - If v(r) < v(n), then (v(n - r) = v(n)) (because subtraction might not change the power of 2 if r is small enough).     - If v(r) = v(n), let’s write n = 2^k cdot n_1 and r = 2^k cdot r_1 where both n_1 and r_1 are odd (hence not divisible by 2).      [      n - r = 2^k (n_1 - r_1).      ]      Since both n_1 and r_1 are odd, their difference n_1 - r_1 is even, meaning 2^{k+1} divides n - r, and therefore:      [      v(n - r) ge k + 1 = v(n) + 1.      ] 4. Because taking some r such that v(r) = v(n) makes v(n-r) ge v(n) + 1, this will break the balance v(n) = v(m). 5. Therefore, after the first player makes the first move, the second player can always respond, ensuring that v(n) = v(m) after the second player's turn.     - As long as the second player maintains this balance after each of their turns, they can ensure that they eventually make the last move. Each move that the second player can make will force the first player into a suboptimal position where v(n) neq v(m), unless they can adjust back to equality with the second player’s optimal move. Conclusion: Given that v(100) = v(252) = 2 initially, the second player can always enforce keeping the value function v() equal for both piles after their turn, resulting in them winning by taking the last match.

Find the equation of the circumcircle of triangle PFQ.","output":"The focus of the parabola y=-frac{1}{4}x^{2} is F(0,-1). By differentiating, we get y'=-frac{1}{2}x. When x=-4, we have y'=-frac{1}{2}times(-4)=2. Therefore, the tangent line at point P(-4,-4) is y+4=2(x+4), which simplifies to 2x-y+4=0. Setting y=0, we find x=-2, thus Q(-2,0). Since k_{QF}=-frac{1}{2} and k_{PQ}=2, it follows that PQ perpendicular QF. Therefore, the diameter of the circumcircle of triangle PFQ is PF. Given P(-4,-4) and F(0,-1), the center of the circle is (-2,-frac{5}{2}) with a radius of frac{5}{2}. Therefore, the equation of the circumcircle of triangle PFQ is (x+2)^{2}+(y+frac{5}{2})^{2}=frac{25}{4}. Hence, the answer is boxed{(x+2)^{2}+(y+frac{5}{2})^{2}=frac{25}{4}}. To solve this problem, we determine the focus of the parabola and the tangent line at point P(-4,-4), find the coordinates of Q, and use the fact that PQ perpendicular QF to find the equation of the circumcircle of triangle PFQ.

Prove that in 2n1 such operations, it is possible to arrange all the containers in one pile in numerical order (with container No. 1 at the bottom, followed by No. 2, and so on).","output":"Let's consider the task of organizing n containers numbered 1, 2, 3, ldots, n in one stack using 2n - 1 operations. The operation allowed is to take several containers from the top of one stack and place them on another stack.  Step-by-step solution: 1. **Initialization:**    Assume there are initially two stacks, Stack A and Stack B. The goal is to ultimately have all containers in one stack (say Stack A) in the correct order with container number 1 at the bottom, followed by 2, 3, ldots, n. 2. **Induction Hypothesis:**    Suppose, after a series of operations, the first k containers (1, 2, ldots, k) are correctly placed in Stack A, and the remaining containers are in Stack B or on top of correctly placed containers in Stack A. 3. **Inductive Step:**    To move from k correctly placed containers to k+1 correctly placed containers:        - Take all containers above k+1 from Stack B and place them temporarily on Stack A. (This requires one operation.)    - Place container k+1 on top of the first k containers in Stack A by taking it from Stack B. (This may involve first moving some top containers from Stack B to Stack A, then placing k+1, and then moving those containers back, ensuring k+1 ends up on top of 1, 2, ldots, k. This can require moving both stacks back and forth but keeps following the \\"one operation\\" rule described in each scenario.)    - Finally, move all containers above k+1 from Stack A back to Stack B to maintain the induction step. (This requires another operation.)    Thus, moving from k to k+1 correctly placed containers requires up to 2 operations. 4. **Termination:**    When k = n, all n containers are correctly placed in Stack A. The exact number of operations total will be the sum of operations needed for each step from k to k+1. Notably, for:        k = 0    k rightarrow 1 : 2 cdot 1 - 1 = 1    1 rightarrow 2 : 2 cdot 2 - 1 = 3    2 rightarrow 3 : 2 cdot 3 - 1 = 5     vdots     k rightarrow k+1 : 2 cdot (k+1) - 1        We systematically verify the step-wise increment to make sure we stay within the allowable 2n - 1 operations.  Conclusion: It's evident through induction and careful placement operations that 2n - 1 operations suffice to arrange the n containers, ( therefore ) we can organize all containers in the desired order using the described method.

The domain of f(x) is {x | x neq 0}. For any x in the domain, if f(-x) = -f(x), then f(x) is an odd function. Let's verify this: f(-x) = (-x) - frac{4}{-x} = -x + frac{4}{x} = -(x - frac{4}{x}) = -f(x) Since f(-x) is equal to -f(x), the function f(x) is indeed an odd function.

Then: f(x_1) - f(x_2) = left(x_1 - frac{4}{x_1}right) - left(x_2 - frac{4}{x_2}right) = (x_1 - x_2) + frac{4(x_1 - x_2)}{x_1x_2} = (x_1 - x_2)left(frac{x_1x_2 + 4}{x_1x_2}right) Since x_1 < x_2, it follows that (x_1 - x_2) < 0. However, since both x_1 and x_2 are positive, frac{x_1x_2 + 4}{x_1x_2} > 0. Thus, the product of a negative and a positive number is negative, which implies f(x_1) - f(x_2) < 0.

Here's a step-by-step approach to solving this problem: 1. **Identify Given Values and Definitions:**     - Geographic latitude of Wrocław: (varphi = 51^circ 07')     - Angle between the plane of the Earth's equator and the plane of the ecliptic (Earth's axial tilt): (delta = 23^circ 27')     - The shortest day occurs when the Sun is at the Tropic of Capricorn, around December 23rd. 2. **Understand the Geometry:**    [    cos beta = frac{O_1 P}{O_1 W} = tan varphi cdot tan delta    ]    This comes from the relationship within the right triangles formed by the Earth's rotation and ecliptic plane. 3. **Calculating (beta):**    - Substitute (varphi = 51^circ 07') and (delta = 23^circ 27'):      [      cos beta = tan(51^circ 07') cdot tan(23^circ 27')      ]    - Calculate the tangents:      [      tan(51^circ 07') approx 1.2527 quad text{and} quad tan(23^circ 27') approx 0.4339      ]    - Substitute these values into the equation:      [      cos beta = 1.2527 cdot 0.4339 approx 0.5438      ]    - Find (beta) from (cos^{-1}(0.5438)):      [      beta approx 57^circ 27' 35''      ] 4. **Calculating Day Length:**    - The day length is proportional to the angle (2beta) related to (180^circ):      [      t : 24, text{hours} = 2beta : 180^circ      ]    - Since (beta approx 57^circ 27' 35''):      [      2beta approx 2 times 57^circ 27' 35'' = 114^circ 55' 10''      ]    - Use the proportion:      [      frac{t}{24} = frac{114^circ 55' 10''}{180^circ}      ]      [      t = 24 times frac{114^circ 55' 10''}{180^circ}      ]      Simplify:      [      t approx 24 times frac{114.9194}{180} approx 15.189 text{ hours}      ]      Therefore, the duration of the shortest day in Wrocław is approximately:      [      t approx 15.189 text{ hours} = 7 text{ hours } 11 text{ minutes }      ] 5. **Conclusion:**     - Answer:      [     boxed{7 text{ hours } 39 text{ minutes } 40 text{ seconds }}     ]     - Note: The calculated value needs to be reduced by approximately 15 minutes due to astronomical refraction effects.

On the sides of triangle (PQR), squares are constructed internally. Prove that their centers are the midpoints of the sides of triangle (ABC).","output":"Given: triangle ABC with squares constructed externally on its sides and centers P, Q, R. Additional squares are constructed internally on the sides of triangle PQR. 1. Let P, Q, and R be the centers of the externally constructed squares on the sides AB, BC, and CA respectively. 2. Consider the composition of two 90^circ rotations. First, we rotate triangle ABC 90^circ clockwise around point R such that C maps to A. Recall that the center of a square is equidistant from its sides, and thus R is uniquely the center of the square on CA. 3. Next, consider rotating 90^circ clockwise around P, which takes point A to B. This is possible because P is the center of the square on AB. 4. The composition of these two rotations results in a 180^circ rotation around their midpoint. The midpoint of P and R is the center of the corresponding square's side PR internally constructed in triangle PQR. 5. Observing that the result of these two rotations is a 180^circ rotation, we know that this midpoint must also be the midpoint of side BC. \`\`\` Let M be the midpoint of BC. Consider triangle MBC, where the center of the rotation (in triangle PQR) is also Q, the center of the square on side BC. \`\`\` 6. Therefore, another similar rotation (or composition of too 90^circ rotations) reveals that the midpoint of P Q aligns again conducts a 180^circ rotation. 7. Further, by symmetry, all centers of the squares constructed internally on the sides of triangle PQR happen to fall precisely at midpoints of  triangle ABC sides. # Conclusion: Thus, we've demonstrated: - Centers of inner squares align as midpoints of corresponding triangle ABC sides formed through rotations and alignment. blacksquare"},{"instruction":"Find the value of tan left( frac{13}{4} pi right)=(quad), where the options are: A: 1 B: 1 C: frac{sqrt{3}}{3} D: frac{sqrt{3}}{3}","output":"To solve this problem, we will use the trigonometric identity tan(x + pi) = tan(x). 1.

We can calculate this distance using the formula: Distance = Speed * Time Distance covered = 20 m/s * 26 s = 520 meters This distance is the sum of the lengths of the train and the platform. We are given the length of the platform as 250 meters. Therefore, the length of the train is: Length of the train = Distance covered - Length of the platform Length of the train = 520 meters - 250 meters Length of the train = 270 meters So, the length of the goods train is boxed{270}  meters."},{"instruction":"Before December , customers buy 1346 ear muffs from the mall .

Consider a right-angled triangle ( triangle ABC ), where (angle ACB = 90^circ). Let (PC) be a segment on the angle bisector of (angle ACB).     2. Let (P) be an arbitrary point on this angle bisector. We connect (P) to the endpoints (A) and (B) of the hypotenuse, forming segments (PA) and (PB). 3. (PA) and (PB) form angles (varphi) and (psi) with the respective legs (AC) and (BC). 4. We need to construct the quadrilateral (ACBP) such that it satisfies the given conditions using known lengths and angles.     1. Assume (PC) is known and arbitrary.     2. Draw the circles passing through (P) with radii that subtend (varphi) and (psi) angles respectively on the segments (PC). 5. Mark the points (A) and (B) on these circles such that the angle conditions (varphi) and (psi) are met. 6. We then check if the condition (45^circ < varphi, psi < 135^circ) holds. If any of the angles are outside this range:     - If (varphi) and (psi) are both less than (45^circ), verify if (P) lies inside the triangle or outside based on the direction of measurement. This relates to segment partition by bisector.     - If ( varphi ) and ( psi ) are both greater than (45^circ) and less than (135^circ), adjust accordingly that (P) lies on the angle bisector. 7.

Find all magic numbers.","output":"To find all the natural numbers ( N ) that satisfy the condition of being a \\"magical number,\\" we proceed as follows: 1. **Definition and New Number Formation**:    - Let ( N ) be a natural number with ( m ) digits.    - If we place ( N ) to the right of any natural number and the resulting new number is divisible by ( N ), we call ( N ) a \\"magical number.\\" 2. **Mathematical Formulation**:    - When ( N ) is placed to the right of 1, the new number is ( 10^m + N ).    - Since ( N ) must divide ( 10^m + N ), we have:      [      N mid (10^m + N)      ]    - This implies:      [      N mid 10^m      ] 3. **Factors of ( 10^m )**:    - The divisors of ( 10^m ) are in the form of ( 2^{alpha} cdot 5^{beta} cdot 10^k ) where ( alpha, beta ) are non-negative integers that do not exceed ( m ). 4. **Possible Values for ( N )**:    - We deduce that ( N ) must be one of the following forms:      [      N = 2^r cdot 10^k, quad N = 10^k, quad text{or} quad N = 5^r cdot 10^k      ]    - Here, ( k ) is a non-negative integer, ( r ) is a positive integer and ( r + k leq m ). 5. **Analysis for ( N = 5^r cdot 10^k )**:    - For ( r ) greater than 3, ( 5^r cdot 10^k ) cannot fit this form since it would exceed the digit constraint due to the positional value limitation. 6. **Conclusion for ( r )**:    - Consequently, the acceptable values for ( r ) are ( r leq 3 ), i.e.,:      [      N = 5 cdot 10^k, quad 5^2 cdot 10^k, quad text{or} quad 5^3 cdot 10^k      ] 7. **Verification for ( N = 2^r cdot 10^k )**:    - Similar reasoning as above shows that the only permissible form for ( 2^r cdot 10^k ) is when:      [      N = 2 cdot 10^k      ] 8. **Combined Result**:    - Making use of both inferences, the complete set of magical numbers is:      [      N = 2 cdot 10^k, quad 5^r cdot 10^k quad (r=0,1,2,3;  k  text{is a non-negative integer})      ] Thus, the necessary and sufficient conditions for ( N ) to be a magical number are met by these forms.

Given that differences must remain or change by 10, the smallest number amongst the pairs after transformations (if they remain distinct) would be (0, 1, 2, 3, 4) and the largest numbers would be at least (10, 11, 12, 13, 14). 4. **Summing the Values**:    - The minimal possible sum for such pairs after transforming into unique numbers will be (0 + 10 + 1 + 11 + 2 + 12 + 3 + 13 + 4 + 14 = 70). 5. **Sum Invariance**:    - The sum of the original numbers is (1 + 2 + 3 + 4 + 4 + 5 + 5 + 11 + 12 + 13 = 60).    - Every applied operation does not change the sum of the set of numbers. This means the sum remains invariant at 60. 6. **Contradiction**:    - Noticing that post-operations, the theoretical minimal sum (70) under the given conditions is greater than the invariant sum (60) is a contradiction.    - Therefore, it is impossible for the numbers to turn into ten distinct integers. # Conclusion: [ boxed{text{No}} ]"},{"instruction":"The ratio of the length to the width of a rectangle is 5:4.

We need to prove that the number of task distributions in which the competition is honest (i.e., there are (n) students who were given the tasks suggested by the remaining (n) participants) is a square of a natural number.

This gives us the function f(x) = e^{x} + x - 2. We are interested in finding the interval in which the solution, x_{0}, lies by analyzing the behavior of f(x). 1. **Evaluate f(x) at x = 0 and x = 1:**    - At x = 0, we have f(0) = e^{0} + 0 - 2 = 1 - 2 = -1.    - At x = 1, we have f(1) = e^{1} + 1 - 2 = e - 1.    Since e is approximately 2.718, it follows that e - 1 > 1, and thus f(1) > 0. 2. **Analyze the monotonicity and continuity of f(x):**    The function f(x) = e^{x} + x - 2 is the sum of e^{x}, which is always increasing, and x, which is linearly increasing. Therefore, f(x) is monotonically increasing throughout its domain. Additionally, both e^{x} and x are continuous functions, making f(x) continuous as well. 3. **Determine the interval containing the zero point of f(x):**    Since f(x) is monotonically increasing and continuous, and we have found that f(0) < 0 and f(1) > 0, there must be exactly one zero point of f(x) between x = 0 and x = 1. This is because a continuous, monotonically increasing function that moves from a negative value to a positive value as x increases must cross the x-axis exactly once in that interval. Therefore, the solution x_{0} of the equation e^{x} + x = 2 lies in the interval (0, 1).

What is the maximum number of nonattacking mammoths that can be placed on an 8 times 8 chessboard?","output":"1. **Understanding the Problem:**    We are given an 8 times 8 chessboard and a special piece called \\"мамонт\\" (mammoth). A mammoth can move diagonally like a bishop, but it only moves in three out of the four possible diagonal directions. The goal is to find the maximum number of mammoths that can be placed on the chessboard such that no two mammoths can attack each other. 2. **Analyzing the Moves:**    Each mammoth can move along three diagonals out of four. Let’s denote the diagonals in the following way:    - The main diagonals from the bottom-left to the top-right.    - The counter diagonals from the top-left to the bottom-right.    For each diagonal direction, a mammoth can potentially be on any cell along its path in that direction. 3. **Counting the Diagonals:**    Since the chessboard is 8 times 8:    - There are 15 main diagonals from the bottom-left to the top-right.    - There are 15 counter diagonals from the top-left to the bottom-right.    Therefore, there are 30 diagonals in total. 4. **Arrow Representation:**    Each mammoth has three \\"arrows\\" representing its possible attack directions. We must prevent any pair of mammoths from sharing the same diagonal within the 8 times 8 grid. 5. **Diagonal Assignments:**    If no two mammoths can share the same diagonal:    - Each diagonal can accommodate only one direction from at most two mammoths, to prevent direct conflict.    - Hence, each diagonal may have arrows from at most two mammoths. 6. **Maximum Number of Arrows:**    Given 30 diagonals, each diagonal can have at most two arrows related to any mammoth. Thus, we have:    [    30 times 2 = 60 text{ arrows in total}    ] 7. **Calculating the Maximum Number of Mammoths:**    Since each mammoth has three arrows, the maximum number of mammoths we can place is determined by dividing the total number of arrows by 3:    [    frac{60}{3} = 20    ] 8. **Conclusion:**    Thus, the maximum number of mammoths that can be placed on an 8 times 8 chessboard such that no two mammoths can attack each other is:    [    boxed{20}    ]"},{"instruction":"Given the geometric sequence a_1, a_2, a_3, a_4 that satisfies a_1 in (0,1), a_2 in (1,2), a_3 in (2,4), determine the range of values for a_4.

Point (K) is on base (AD). To find (M), we follow these steps: 1. Determine the ratio in which point (M) divides segment (BC): [ BM : MC = AK : KD ] 2. Denote the intersection points of segments (AM) and (BK), and (DM) and (CK) as (P) and (Q) respectively. 3. Show that the area of the intersection region is maximal when the line (PQ) is parallel to both bases of the trapezoid: # Detailed Steps: 1. **Identifying the dividing ratio:**    Let (M) be the point on (BC) such that: [ BM : MC = AK : KD ] Since (AK) and (KD) are segments on base (AD), (M) precisely divides (BC) similarly to how point (K) divides (AD). 2. **Label the intersection points:**    - Let (P) be the intersection of (AM) and (BK).    - Let (Q) be the intersection of (DM) and (CK). Since (AK : KD = BM : MC) and (BK : KC = AP : PB), the lines (PQ) are parallel to the bases (AD) and (BC). 3. **Consider another point (M_1) on (BC):**    Assume (M_1) is any point on the segment (BC) other than (M). - Let the intersection of (AM_1) and (BK) be (P_1). - Let the intersection of (DM_1) and (CK) be (Q_1). - Let the intersections of (AM_1) and (PQ), and (DM_1) and (PQ) be denoted as (P_2) and (Q_2) respectively. - Let the intersection of (AM) and (DM_1) be (O). 4. **Comparing Areas:**    We need to show that:     [ S_{MPKQ} > S_{M_1 P_1 K Q_1} ] or equivalently,  [ S_{MOQ_1Q} > S_{M_1 O PP_1} ] 5. **Area Analysis:** As point (M) is such that (PQ) is parallel to the bases, the area formed by (MOQ_1Q) must be greater than the area formed by (M_1OQ_2Q) and thus greater than (M_1OPP_1). Since the area of (MPKQ) is indeed maximized when (M) is chosen to divide (BC) in the ratio (AK:KD).

Since multiplying a polynomial by a non-zero constant does not affect the degree, assume the leading coefficients of (P(x)) and (Q(x)) are 1. We are given that (n > 0). We aim to show by contradiction that (S(x)) exists. 3. **Using the Leading Terms**:      Consider the polynomial (T(x, y) = P(x) - P(y)). The leading term of (T(x, y)) is (overline{T}(x, y) = x^n - y^n). Expressing our condition in terms of leading terms, we have:     [     x^n - y^n = overline{P(x) - P(y)} = overline{R(x, y)} cdot overline{Q(x) - Q(y)}     ]     Given that (overline{Q(x) - Q(y)} = x^k - y^k), we have:     [     x^n - y^n = overline{R(x, y)}(x^k - y^k)     ]     This means (x^n - y^n) must be divisible by (x^k - y^k). 4. **Polynomial Divisibility**:     Suppose (n = qk + r) (Euclidean division where (0 leq r < k)). Then:     [     x^n - y^n = x^r left( x^{qk} - y^{qk} right) + y^{qk} left( x^r - y^r right)     ]     Now, since (x^{qk} - y^{qk}) can be factored as:     [     x^{qk} - y^{qk} = (x^k - y^k) (x^{k(q-1)} + x^{k(q-2)}y^{k} + cdots + y^{k(q-1)})     ]     and therefore:     [     x^n - y^n = x^r (x^k - y^k)(x^{k(q-1)} + cdots + y^{k(q-1)}) + y^{qk}(x^r - y^r)     ]     For (x^n - y^n) to be divisible by (x^k - y^k), the term (y^{qk} (x^r - y^r)) must also be divisible by (x^k - y^k). Given that (0 leq r < k), this is only possible if (r = 0). Thus, (n) must be a multiple of (k). 5. **Conclusion of Degree Analysis**:     Since (n = qk), reorganize (P(x)) and consider the polynomial (P_1(x) = P(x) - Q^{frac{n}{k}}(x)):     [     P_1(x) = P(x) - Q^{frac{n}{k}}(x)     ]     The degree of (P_1(x)) is less than the degree of (P(x)). Note that:     [     P_1(x)-P_1(y) = (R(x, y) - (sum_{i=0}^{frac{n}{k} - 1}Q^{i}(x)Q^{frac{n}{k} - 1 - i}(y)))(Q(x) - Q(y))     ]     where (P(x) - Q^{frac{n}{k}}(x)) affects only the terms without altering the division condition. 6. **Inductive Argument**:     By induction, there exists a polynomial (S_1(x)) such that (P_1(x) = S_1(Q(x))). Finally, let:     [     S(x) = S_1(x) + x^{frac{n}{k}}     ]     Therefore:     [     P(x) = P_1(x) + Q^{frac{n}{k}}(x) = S_1(Q(x)) + Q^{frac{n}{k}}(x) = S(Q(x))     ] # Conclusion: [ boxed{P(x) = S(Q(x))} ]"},{"instruction":"Mitzi brought 75 to the amusement park.

Multiplying each of these by 3 (since nu = 3n), we get the possible values of nu as 3 cdot 1 = 3, 3 cdot 2 = 6, 3 cdot 4 = 12, 3 cdot 5 = 15, 3 cdot 10 = 30, and 3 cdot 20 = 60. Adding these values together, we get the sum 3 + 6 + 12 + 15 + 30 + 60 = 126.

Since A lies on both circles, AD bisects angle O_1 DO_2. Therefore, we have:    [    angle ADO_1 = angle ADO_2 = 30^circ.    ] 9.

Now, we need to find the expression for frac{cos 2a}{1+cos 2a-sin 2a}: frac{cos 2a}{1+cos 2a-sin 2a} = frac{cos^2 a - sin^2 a}{2cos^2 a - 2sin acos a} = frac{(cos a + sin a)(cos a - sin a)}{2cos a(cos a - sin a)} = frac{cos a + sin a}{2cos a}. Now, we know that sin(a) = sqrt{1 - cos^2(a)} = frac{2sqrt{2}}{3}, as a is in the second quadrant. Plugging this into the expression above, we have: frac{cos a + sin a}{2cos a} = frac{-frac{1}{3} + frac{2sqrt{2}}{3}}{-frac{2}{3}} = boxed{frac{1-2sqrt{2}}{2}}."},{"instruction":"a modern art museum, visitors who watched a certain Picasso painting were asked to fill in a short questionnaire.

According to the information given, E = U. We are also told that all 150 visitors who did not enjoy the painting also did not feel they had understood the painting. This means that these 150 visitors are not included in E or U. Since the total number of visitors who answered the questionnaire is 600, the number of visitors who either enjoyed the painting or felt they had understood the painting (or both) is 600 - 150 = 450. Given that E = U, we can say that the number of visitors who both enjoyed and understood the painting is E (or U, since they are equal). Therefore, the fraction of visitors who both enjoyed the painting and felt they had understood the painting is E/600. Since E + 150 = 600 (the total number of visitors who enjoyed the painting plus those who did not enjoy it), we can solve for E: E + 150 = 600 E = 600 - 150 E = 450 So, the fraction of visitors who both enjoyed the painting and felt they had understood the painting is boxed{450/600,}  which simplifies to 3/4 or 75%."},{"instruction":"Given that the complex number z satisfies the equation z(1+i)=2, where i is the imaginary unit, find the imaginary part of the complex number z.","output":"From the equation z(1+i)=2, we can isolate z by dividing both sides by (1+i): z = frac{2}{1+i} To simplify this expression, we can multiply both the numerator and the denominator by the conjugate of the denominator, which is (1-i): z = frac{2}{1+i} times frac{1-i}{1-i} = frac{2(1-i)}{(1+i)(1-i)} = frac{2-2i}{1+1} = frac{2-2i}{2} = 1-i Thus, the imaginary part of the complex number z is boxed{-1}.

Adding c to both sides of ad < bc gives ad + c < bc + c. 6. Since c < d, adding d to both sides of the previous inequality doesn't change the direction of the inequality, so ad + c < bc + d.

This function maps (mathbb{R}) to (mathbb{C}) and should satisfy a similar equation. Note that:    [    f(x) = e^{i x cdot frac{2 pi}{8}}    ]    Applying the functional equation to this function:    [    f(x-1) + f(x+1) = e^{i(x-1) cdot frac{2 pi}{8}} + e^{i(x+1) cdot frac{2 pi}{8}}    ]    This can be simplified using the properties of exponents:    [    f(x-1) + f(x+1) = e^{i left( x cdot frac{2 pi}{8} - frac{2 pi}{8} right)} + e^{i left( x cdot frac{2 pi}{8} + frac{2 pi}{8} right)} = e^{i x cdot frac{2 pi}{8}} cdot e^{-i cdot frac{2 pi}{8}} + e^{i x cdot frac{2 pi}{8}} cdot e^{i cdot frac{2 pi}{8}}    ]    [    = e^{i x cdot frac{2 pi}{8}} left( e^{-i cdot frac{2 pi}{8}} + e^{i cdot frac{2 pi}{8}} right) = e^{i x cdot frac{2 pi}{8}} (2 cos frac{2 pi}{8})     ] 3. **Using Trigonometric Identities**: Recall that ( 2 cos left( frac{2 pi}{8} right) = sqrt{2} ). Then,    [    f(x-1) + f(x+1) = e^{i x cdot frac{2 pi}{8}} cdot sqrt{2} = sqrt{2} f(x)    ]    This confirms that our function ( f(x) = e^{i x cdot frac{2 pi}{8}} ) satisfies the original functional equation. 4. **Exploring Periodicity**: Now, let's explore the periodicity of ( f ).

The balanced chemical equation for this reaction is: C6H6 + CH4 → C7H8 + H2 From the equation, we can see that 1 mole of benzene reacts with 1 mole of methane to produce 1 mole of toluene and 1 mole of hydrogen.  Given that 2 moles of methane are reacting, we would need 2 moles of benzene to react with them to form 2 moles of toluene and 2 moles of hydrogen, according to the stoichiometry of the reaction. However, you mentioned that the total amount of benzene required is 156. I assume you mean 156 grams of benzene. To find out how many moles of benzene this corresponds to, we need to use the molar mass of benzene, which is approximately 78.11 g/mol. Moles of benzene = mass of benzene / molar mass of benzene Moles of benzene = 156 g / 78.11 g/mol Moles of benzene ≈ 2 moles So, 156 grams of benzene is approximately 2 moles of benzene. This means that 2 moles of benzene will react with 2 moles of methane to form 2 moles of toluene (since the stoichiometry of the reaction is 1:1:1:1).

We'll denote such an arrangement as a \\"valid arrangement.\\" 1. **Total Possible Arrangements:**    The total number of possible arrangements of 3 black balls and 3 white balls can be calculated using the combinations formula because the balls are identical within their colors. The number of ways to choose 3 positions out of 6 for either black balls or white balls is given by:    [    binom{6}{3} = frac{6!}{3!3!} = 20    ] 2. **Valid Arrangements:**    In order to count the number of valid arrangements, we observe that a valid arrangement always begins with a black ball. For each of these valid sequences, the number of black balls must always be at least the number of white balls going from left to right.    We can use the method of distributing black and white balls where the valid sequences are essentially equivalent to the so-called \\"Dyck paths\\" or \\"Catalan paths\\" in combinatorial mathematics.     These are particular paths that go from ((0, 0)) to ((3, 3)) and do not pass below the line (y = x).

What percentage of the remaining salary does he spend on clothes and transport?","output":"Let's denote Mr. Yadav's monthly salary as S. According to the problem, Mr. Yadav spends 60% of his salary on consumable items. Therefore, the remaining salary after spending on consumable items is 40% of S. Now, let's denote the percentage of the remaining salary that he spends on clothes and transport as P%. Given that he saves 46800 at the end of the year, this means his monthly savings amount to 46800 / 12 = 3900. We also know that he spends 3900 per month on clothes and transport. So, the remaining salary after spending on consumable items is spent on clothes and transport and savings. Let's calculate the remaining salary after spending on consumable items: Remaining salary = 40% of S Remaining salary = 0.40 * S Now, this remaining salary is divided between clothes and transport expenses (3900) and savings (3900). So, we have: 0.40 * S = 3900 (clothes and transport) + 3900 (savings) Now, we need to find P%, which is the percentage of the remaining salary spent on clothes and transport: P% of Remaining salary = 3900 P% of (0.40 * S) = 3900 To find P%, we divide the clothes and transport expenses by the remaining salary and then multiply by 100 to get the percentage: P% = (3900 / (0.40 * S)) * 100 But we know that 0.40 * S is equal to 3900 (clothes and transport) + 3900 (savings), which is 7800.

Since the total amount spent on DVDs and Blu-rays is equal to the total amount spent on all movies, we can set up the following equation: [ 96 + (B times 18) = (8 + B) times 14 ] Now we can solve for ( B ): [ 96 + 18B = 112 + 14B ] Subtract ( 14B ) from both sides: [ 96 + 4B = 112 ] Subtract ( 96 ) from both sides: [ 4B = 112 - 96 ] [ 4B = 16 ] Divide both sides by 4: [ B = 4 ] So, Chris bought boxed{4}  movies on Blu-ray."},{"instruction":"For the quadratic function y=mx^{2}+nx+tleft(mneq 0right), if there exists x_{0}in R such that mx_{0}^{2}+nx_{0}+t=x_{0} holds, then x_{0} is called a fixed point of the quadratic function y=mx^{2}+nx+tleft(mneq 0right).

(3) If for any real number b, the quadratic function y=ax^{2}+(b+1)x+(b1)left(aneq 0right) always has a fixed point, find the range of values for a.","output":"# Solution Detailed Steps  Part (1): Finding Fixed Points We're given the quadratic function y = x^2 - x - 3. To find its fixed points, we set y = x, which gives us the equation: x^2 - x - 3 = x. This simplifies to: x^2 - 2x - 3 = 0. Factoring the quadratic equation, we get: (x - 3)(x + 1) = 0. Setting each factor equal to zero gives us the fixed points: 1. x - 3 = 0 implies x = 3, 2. x + 1 = 0 implies x = -1. Therefore, the fixed points are x_1 = -1 and x_2 = 3. Hence, the fixed points are boxed{-1 text{ and } 3}.  Part (2): Minimum Value of frac{x_1}{x_2} + frac{x_2}{x_1} For y = 2x^2 - (3+a)x + a - 1 to have two distinct positive real roots as fixed points, we set y = x: 2x^2 - (3+a)x + a - 1 = x. This simplifies to: 2x^2 - (4 + a)x + a - 1 = 0. For the roots to be distinct and positive, the discriminant must be positive (Delta > 0), which implies a > 1.  The sum and product of roots, x_1 and x_2, are given by Vieta's formulas: - Sum of roots, x_1 + x_2 = frac{4 + a}{2}, - Product of roots, x_1 cdot x_2 = frac{a - 1}{2}. The expression frac{x_1}{x_2} + frac{x_2}{x_1} simplifies to: frac{x_1^2 + x_2^2}{x_1 cdot x_2} = frac{(x_1 + x_2)^2 - 2x_1 cdot x_2}{x_1 cdot x_2} = frac{(frac{4 + a}{2})^2}{frac{a - 1}{2}} - 2 = frac{(a + 4)^2}{4(a - 1)} - 2. This simplifies further to: frac{(a - 1 + 5)^2}{2(a - 1)} - 2 = frac{(a - 1)^2 + 10(a - 1) + 25}{2(a - 1)} - 2 = frac{a - 1}{2} + frac{25}{2(a - 1)} + 3. By applying the AM-GM inequality, where a > 1, we find: frac{a - 1}{2} + frac{25}{2(a - 1)} + 3 geq 2sqrt{frac{a - 1}{2} cdot frac{25}{2(a - 1)}} + 3 = 8, with equality when frac{a - 1}{2} = frac{25}{2(a - 1)}, i.e., a = 6. Hence, the minimum value of frac{x_1}{x_2} + frac{x_2}{x_1} is boxed{8}.  Part (3): Range of Values for a For y = ax^2 + (b + 1)x + (b - 1) to always have a fixed point, we set y = x: ax^2 + bx + (b - 1) = 0. The discriminant Delta = b^2 - 4a(b - 1) geq 0 for the quadratic equation to have real solutions. Simplifying gives: b^2 - 4ab + 4a geq 0. Since b can be any real number, the discriminant of this quadratic in b, Delta' = (-4a)^2 - 16a leq 0, which simplifies to: a(a - 1) leq 0, quad a neq 0.

The function f(x) basically represents the fractional part of x. This is because lfloor x rfloor gives us the integer part of x, and x - lfloor x rfloor yields the difference between x and its integer part, which is the fractional part. For example: - If x = 3.7, then lfloor x rfloor = 3, and f(x) = 3.7 - 3 = 0.7. - If x = -1.2, then lfloor x rfloor = -2 (since -2 is the greatest integer less than -1.2), and f(x) = -1.2 - (-2) = 0.8. The output of f(x) will always be in the range [0, 1), as the fractional part cannot reach 1. The function repeats its values for every integer increment of x. Thus, starting at any point x_0, the function will repeat itself at x_0 + 1, x_0 + 2, and so on.

Completing the square for the y term: [y^{2}+4y = (y+2)^{2} - 2^2 = (y+2)^{2} - 4] Substituting these back into the circle equation gives: [(x-1)^{2} + (y+2)^{2} - 1 - 4 = k] [ Rightarrow (x-1)^{2} + (y+2)^{2} = k + 5] Now let's analyze each option based on this equation: **Option A:**  The radius squared of a circle, represented as the right side of the equation (x-1)^{2} + (y+2)^{2} = k + 5, must be positive for a real circle. This implies k+5 > 0, hence k > -5. This makes option A correct. **Option B:**  The standard form of a circle's equation is (x-h)^{2} + (y-k)^{2} = r^{2}, where (h, k) is the center. Based on our equation (x-1)^{2} + (y+2)^{2} = k + 5, the center of the circle is (1, -2), not (1, 2). Thus, option B is incorrect. **Option C:**  When k=4, the radius r of circle C can be found by taking the square root of the right side of our standard form equation, which becomes r = sqrt{4 + 5} = sqrt{9} = 3. Therefore, option C is correct. **Option D:**  If the circle is tangent to the x-axis, the distance from the center to the x-axis equals the radius. The center is (1, -2), so the distance to the x-axis is |-2| = 2. Thus, the radius is 2, and r^2 = 2^2 = 4. For the circle equation, k + 5 = 4, which means k = -1, not -4.

This implies that a_{8} > 0. Given that frac{a_{9}}{a_{8}} < -1, we can deduce that a_{9} < -a_{8} < 0. Therefore, a_{8} + a_{9} < 0, which leads to the conclusion that |a_{9}| > a_{8}.

This means that S_{n} is maximum when n=8. Therefore, option B is correct. 3. **Analyzing Option C: The maximum value of n for which S_{n} > 0 is 16** Given that a_{8} + a_{9} < 0, we find that S_{16} = frac{16}{2}(a_{1} + a_{16}) = 8(a_{8} + a_{9}) < 0. Since S_{15} > 0, the maximum value of n for which S_{n} > 0 is actually 15, not 16.

We know that: [ angle BHA = angle BHB_1 + angle BHT ] 10. Since both (angle BHB_1) and (angle BHT) (being the straight-line extension through (H)) equal (30^circ), we have: [ angle BHA = 30^circ + 60^circ = 90^circ ] 11. Since a perpendicular is shorter than any other line segment from the same point, we assert: [ AB > AH  ] 12. For length calculation, using already designated points and lengths: [ AH = AT + TH ] 13. Since (TH = TB_1) and (B_1) is the midpoint of (BT) we have: [ TH = frac{BT}{2} ] 14. Thus, [ AH = AT + frac{BT}{2} ] 15. Similarly, for other sides: [ AC > AT + frac{CT}{2} quad text { and } quad BC > BT + frac{CT}{2} ] # Conclusion: By adding up all the inequalities and multiplying by 2, we get: [ begin{aligned} 2AB + 2BC + 2CA & > 2 (AT + frac{BT}{2}) + 2 (BT + frac{CT}{2}) + 2 (AT + frac{CT}{2})  & = 4AT + 3BT + 2CT end{aligned} ] Therefore, the result follows as: [ boxed{2AB + 2BC + 2CA > 4AT + 3BT + 2CT} ]"},{"instruction":"Addilynn went to the grocery store and bought six dozen eggs for use in her house.

Since (n) is an odd integer, (x_1 + y_1) must be divisible by 4 for (4dx_1y_1) to also be divisible by 4. Thus, (x_1) and (y_1) are either both even or both odd. Given that (x_1) and (y_1) are coprime, they must both be odd. 5.

By the properties of divisors, (x_1) divides (n(x_1 + y_1)). Since (x_1) is coprime to (x_1 + y_1), it must divide (n) itself. 7.

First, let's assess the condition for x=1+log _{2}5 to determine which part of the function to use. We know that log_2{5} > 2 because 2^2 = 4 < 5, thus 1+log_2{5} > 1+2 = 3. Since 3 < 4, we use the recursive part of the function for x < 4. Following the function's rule for x < 4, we can express f(1+log _{2}5) as f(2+log _{2}5). This is because, according to the function's definition, for values of x less than 4, we look at f(x+1). Now, 2+log _{2}5 can be simplified using the property of logarithms that a+log_b{c}=log_b{b^a cdot c}. Applying this, 2+log _{2}5=log _{2}{2^2}+log _{2}5=log _{2}(4cdot5)=log _{2}20. At this point, since log _{2}20 > 4, we can directly apply the first part of the function's definition, (frac{1}{2})^x, for xgeqslant 4. Therefore, f(2+log _{2}5) = (frac{1}{2})^{log _{2}20}. Using the exponent and logarithm rule, (frac{1}{2})^{log _{2}20} = frac{1}{2^{log _{2}20}} = frac{1}{20}, because 2^{log _{2}20} = 20.

(b) It is possible to color each point in M either red or blue so that for every set of three points that form a triangle, there is at least one point inside the triangle of the opposite color.    We must determine the maximum possible number of elements in M. --- 1. **Consider the convex hull of the red points**:     Suppose we have n red points forming a convex hull F. Let k of these red points be inside F. 2. **Forming triangles within the convex hull**:     Since F is an n-sided polygon, we can divide it into n-k triangles by drawing diagonals from one vertex to all nonadjacent vertices. This process creates n - k - 2 red triangles within the convex hull F. 3. **Adding interior red points**:     Each of these interior red points will divide each triangle it is part of into smaller triangles. Specifically, every red point added inside F borders additional triangles that are further subdivided. Hence, the k red interior points subdivide into 2k additional triangles because each red point makes 3 smaller triangles inside each larger triangle it intersects.    Thus, the total number of red triangles inside F is:    [    (n - k - 2) + 2k = n + k - 2    ] 4. **Every triangle must contain a blue point**:     Based on the problem conditions, each of these n + k - 2 triangles must contain at least one blue point.

Since we've stacked four 1x1x1 cubes, the dimensions of our parallelepiped are (1 times 1 times 4). 3. **Calculating Required Square Areas:**    - We need three squares to cover the parallelepiped without gaps or overlaps.    - The two side faces of the parallelepiped are (1 times 4), requiring two (4 times 4) squares. This is because when projecting the side face onto a square, we essentially need to cover an area of (4) units vertically by (1) unit horizontally, multiplied by both sides.    - The top and bottom faces are (1 times 1), each requiring one (1 times 1) square, which perfectly covers the individual cubes at the top and bottom of our stacked column. 4. **Verification with Image**:     On referring to the given image, we note that the visual representation aligns with our calculations and necessity for specified areas:     - A tower-like structure with an extended length of 4 units,    - Two large squares covering the vertical sides, and    - Small squares atop and below. # Conclusion: By following these steps, we've successfully created a parallelepiped from identical cubes and covered it with three squares as specified.

Let's consider the possible selections and their contributions: 1. Selecting the constant term from left(2x+1right) and the x term from the other three factors, the contribution to the coefficient of x^3 is 1 cdot (1)(-2)(3) = -6. 2. Selecting the constant term from left(x-2right) and the x term from the other three factors, the contribution to the coefficient of x^3 is -2 cdot (2x)(1)(3) = -12x^3. Thus, the coefficient from this selection is -12. 3. Selecting the constant term from left(x+3right) and the x term from the other three factors, the contribution to the coefficient of x^3 is 3 cdot (2x)(-2)(1) = -12x^3.

Let's correct the approach based on the standard solution provided: For each selection of three x terms and one constant term, we should consider the coefficients properly: 1. From left(2x+1right), selecting 2x contributes 2 to the coefficient of x^3. 2. From left(x-2right), selecting x contributes 1 to the coefficient of x^3. 3. From left(x+3right), selecting x contributes 1 to the coefficient of x^3. 4. From left(x-4right), selecting x contributes 1 to the coefficient of x^3. The correct calculation for the coefficient of x^3 involves considering how each factor contributes when combined: - From left(2x+1right) selecting 1, and from the others selecting x, we get 1 cdot 1 cdot 1 cdot 1 = 1. - From left(x-2right) selecting -2, and from the others selecting x, we get 2 cdot (-2) = -4. - From left(x+3right) selecting 3, and from left(2x+1right) and the others selecting x, we get 2 cdot 3 = 6. - From left(x-4right) selecting -4, and from the others selecting x, we get 2 cdot (-4) = -8.

Choose ( k ) such that ( f(k) = 1 ).    - Consider the infinite sequence ( k, k+1, k+2, k+4, k+8, k+16, ldots ). Each term in this sequence is different because ( f ) is a bijection. 2. **Step 2: Sequence Properties and Monotonicity**    - Considering ( f ) is a bijection and ensuring distinct values, note that the sequence ( f(k), f(k+1), f(k+2), f(k+4), f(k+8), ldots ) cannot always be decreasing. This is because the values are bounded below by 1, as they are positive integers. 3. **Step 3: Finding an Increasing Subsequence**    - Hence, there must exist ( n ) such that ( f(k + 2^n) < f(k + 2^{n+1}) ).     - This implies ( f(k) < f(k + 2^n) < f(k + 2^{n+1}) ).

For instance, for ( k = 3 ), the traversal patterns fit perfectly as shown in the reference solution provided with a specific example.     - **Case 2: ( n = 3k+2 )**:         - To verify ( n = 3k+2 ):             - Number the rows from bottom to top as ( 0, 1, cdots, 3k+1 ).             - Number the columns from left to right as ( 0, 1, cdots, 3k+1 ).             - Fill each cell with the sum of its row and column indices.             - Suppose ( a_i ) represents the number in the cell reached in the ( i )-th move. We need to find out the conditions for ( a_{i+1} ) given the movement constraints:                 - Moving right or up, increase the cell number by 1.                 - Moving left-bottom, decrease the cell number by 2.             - Thus, we conclude ( a_{i+1} equiv a_i + 1 (mod 3) ). 4. **Modulo Property Analysis**:     - For ( n = 3k+2 ), among ( (3k+2)^2 - 1 ) moves (excluding the starting square), numbers modulo 3 have to cycle perfectly such that every group of 3 numbers contains one which is perfectly divisible by 3.     - This property guarantees that out of ( (3k+2)^2 - 1 ), exactly ( frac{1}{3}[(3k+2)^2-1] = 3k^2 + 4k + 1 ) should be divisible by 3. 5. **Conflict Identification**:     - On the other hand, calculating specifically for cells containing numbers which are multiples of 3:       [       begin{aligned}         &, 4 + 7 + 10 + cdots + (3k + 1) + 3k + 3(k-1) cdots + 6 + 3          =&, frac{1}{2} cdot k (3k + 5) + frac{1}{2} cdot k (3k + 3) = k(3k + 4)       end{aligned}       ]       - Comparing these, there is a contradiction because ( k(3k + 4) ) is less than ( 3k^2 + 4k + 1 ). 6. **Conclusion**:     - The contradiction shows that for ( n = 3k+2 ), it is not possible to traverse and visit every cell exactly once starting from the bottom-left corner.     - Hence, the possible values for ( n ) allowing traversal are when ( n = 3k ) or ( n = 3k+1 ).

The configurations involve positioning one square on different pairs of adjacent squares among the 7 bottom squares.      - Possible configurations: 6    - **Second Sub-case:** (6 + 2)      - Arrange 6 squares in the first layer and 2 squares in the second layer.      - The 2 squares in the second layer need to be placed such that each is supported by 2 different first-layer squares.      - Possible configurations: 4    - **Third Sub-case:** (5 + 3)      - Arrange 5 squares in the first layer and 3 squares in the second layer.      - The three squares in the second layer need to be placed such that each is supported correctly by 2 different first-layer squares.      - Possible configurations: 2 2. **Consider the Case of 3 Layers:**    - **First Sub-case:** (5 + 2 + 1)      - Arrange 5 squares in the first layer, 2 squares in the second layer, and 1 square in the third layer.      - The square in the third layer should be correctly supported by 2 squares from the second layer which, in turn, needs to be supported by 2 squares each from the first layer.      - Possible configurations: 3    - **Second Sub-case:** (4 + 3 + 1)      - Arrange 4 squares in the first layer, 3 squares in the second layer, and 1 square in the third layer.      - The single square in the third layer must be positioned such that it is supported correctly by the appropriate pairs in the second and first layers.      - Possible configurations: 2 # Conclusion: Adding all the possible configurations together: [  text{Total configurations} = 6 + 4 + 2 + 3 + 2 = 17  ] Thus, the number of distinct ways to arrange ( n = 8 ) squares into at least two layers, satisfying the given conditions, is: [ boxed{17} ]"},{"instruction":"f 2(z+overline{z})+3(zoverline{z})=4+6i, then z=left(  right) A: 12i B: 1+2i C: 1+i D: 1i","output":"To solve the given problem, let's start by expressing z in terms of its real and imaginary parts.

Is there always a diagonal with a length greater than 2?","output":"1. **Consideration of a Specific Polygon:**     Let's start by constructing a specific hexagon to analyze the problem. Take an equilateral triangle with side length 2. 2. **Constructing Perpendiculars:**     From the midpoints of each side of this equilateral triangle, erect perpendiculars outward. These perpendiculars will help us construct our hexagon in a controlled manner. 3. **Creating Minor Lengths:**     On each of these perpendiculars, place very small segments, say of length 0.01 units. This ensures that each small segment is measurable and less than any diagonal potential interaction within larger dimensions of our triangle. 4. **Hexagon Formation:**     Connect the ends of these small segments to the corresponding vertices of the original equilateral triangle. This step helps in constructing a convex hexagon where all sides are slightly greater than 1 unit. 5. **Verification of Side Lengths:**     It’s evident that sides of the resulting convex hexagon are slightly greater than 1 unit in length. Therefore, our polygon satisfies the given condition of each side being longer than 1. 6. **Analyzing Diagonals:**     Evaluate the lengths of all possible diagonals in this newly formed hexagon. Since the changes made from the equilateral triangle’s original sides are minimal (specifically 0.01 units extensions), the longest length within this hexagon (any diagonal) is less than or equal to 2 units. 7. **Conclusion:**     Upon detailed inspection, the maximum length any diagonal could achieve is precisely evaded due to our minimal increment (0.01) from the midpoint extensions. Hence, none of the diagonals surpass the length of 2 units. # Conclusion: The described construction showcases a scenario of a convex hexagon where all sides exceed 1 unit in length, but none of its diagonals extend beyond 2 units. Thus, it is demonstrated that not every convex hexagon with sides longer than 1 unit has a diagonal longer than 2 units.

The set M consists of 1992 natural numbers. 2. For any element in M and the sum of any number of elements in M, the number is of the form m^k with m in mathbf{N}, k geq 2. We start by considering a more general problem: **General Problem:** For any integer n, there exists a set M_n consisting of n natural numbers that satisfy condition (2). **Base Case:** For n = 2, we need to demonstrate there exists a set M_2 of 2 elements. One possible set is M_2 = {9, 16} because: - 9 = 3^2 - 16 = 4^2 - 9 + 16 = 25 = 5^2 Thus, the set {9, 16} meets the requirement for n = 2. **Inductive Step:** Assume there exists a set M_k = {a_1, a_2, ldots, a_k} consisting of k natural numbers satisfying condition (2), with all the sums being distinct expressions of the form m^k. We need to show that there exists a set M_{k+1} of k+1 elements fulfilling the same property. 1. **Combine Elements with Unique Exponents:**    Suppose the elements and their sums in M_k can be expressed as:    [    S_1^{a_1}, S_2^{a_2}, ldots, S_{2^k-1}^{a_{2^k-1}}    ]    where alpha_i geq 2 for i = 1, 2, ldots, 2^k - 1. 2. **Define a General Factor m:**    Let the least common multiple (LCM) of alpha_1, alpha_2, ldots, alpha_{2^k-1} be m. Choose 2^k - 1 distinct primes p_i such that gcd(m, p_i) = 1 for i=1, 2, ldots, 2^k-1. 3. **Construct Multipliers c_i:**    Define:    [    c_i = prod_{substack{j=1  j neq i}}^{2^k-1} p_j, text{for } i=1, 2, ldots, 2^k-1    ]    Hence, gcd(m c_i, p_i) = 1. 4. **Utilize Chinese Remainder Theorem:**    Let b = prod_{i=1}^{2^k-1} (S_i^{a_i} + 1)^{m_ix}, constructed based on M_k, where x is determined using the Chinese Remainder Theorem resolving the system:    [    begin{cases}    x equiv k_1 pmod{p_1}     x equiv k_2 pmod{p_2}     vdots     x equiv k_{2^k-1} pmod{p_{2^k-1}}    end{cases}    ] 5. **Construct the New Set M_{k+1}:**    Define:    [    M_{k+1} = {a_1 b, a_2 b, ldots, a_k b, b}    ]    We then show that this set satisfies condition (2). **Verification:** **Case 1:** b does not participate in the sum. - The sums are of the form S_i^{a_i} b, and b is the m^{th} power of a natural number where m = text{lcm}(alpha_1, alpha_2, ldots, alpha_{2^k-1}).

Let's denote the number as n, and its distinct prime factors as p1, p2, ..., pk. The condition for a prime saturated number is: p1 * p2 * ... * pk < sqrt(n) Since we are looking for the greatest two-digit number, we should start from the highest two-digit number, which is 99, and work our way down until we find a number that satisfies the condition. Let's consider the prime factors of some two-digit numbers starting from 99: - 99 = 3^2 * 11   Product of distinct prime factors = 3 * 11 = 33   sqrt(99) ≈ 9.95   33 is not less than 9.95, so 99 is not prime saturated. - 98 = 2 * 7^2   Product of distinct prime factors = 2 * 7 = 14   sqrt(98) ≈ 9.90   14 is greater than 9.90, so 98 is not prime saturated. - 97 is a prime number, so it has only one prime factor, which is 97 itself.   Product of distinct prime factors = 97   sqrt(97) ≈ 9.85   97 is not less than 9.85, so 97 is not prime saturated. - 96 = 2^5 * 3   Product of distinct prime factors = 2 * 3 = 6   sqrt(96) ≈ 9.80   6 is less than 9.80, so 96 is prime saturated.

When boat M and boat B meet for the first time, boat M has traveled 500 yards, and boat B has traveled D - 500 yards. After they meet for the first time, they continue to travel to the opposite shores, cross each other again, and meet for the second time. At this second meeting, boat M has traveled the remaining distance to shore B, crossed over to shore A, and then traveled an additional 300 yards towards shore B. Similarly, boat B has traveled the remaining distance to shore A, crossed over to shore B, and then traveled an additional D - 300 yards towards shore A. Since both boats travel at constant speeds and they start and meet at the same times, the distances they travel must be proportional. Therefore, the distance boat M travels after the first meeting until the second meeting must be equal to the distance boat B travels in the same time. Let's set up the equation based on the distances traveled by both boats: For boat M: 500 + (D - 500) + 300 = D + 300 For boat B: (D - 500) + 500 + (D - 300) = D + D - 300 Since both expressions represent the same distance traveled by each boat from the first meeting to the second meeting, we can set them equal to each other: D + 300 = 2D - 300 Now, we can solve for D: D - 2D = -300 - 300 -D = -600 D = 600 Therefore, the distance between shore A and shore B is boxed{600}  yards."},{"instruction":"A pencil is shortened by frac {4}{9} of its length.

Therefore, the equation of the parabola becomes y^2 = 4x. 2. **Let the coordinates of A and B be A(x_1, y_1) and B(x_2, y_2), and the equation of line l be y = kx - 1 (k neq 0)**. 3. **Solve the system of equations**:   From the system left{begin{array}{l}y=kx-1 y^2=4xend{array}right., substituting y^2 = 4x into y = kx - 1 gives us ky^2 - 4y - 4 = 0. 4. **Find the discriminant Delta for the quadratic equation in y**:   The discriminant Delta = 16 + 16k must be greater than 0 for the line to intersect the parabola at two distinct points.   Therefore, we have 16 + 16k > 0, which simplifies to k > -1 and k neq 0.   Additionally, the line PA cannot pass through both P(1,-2) and (1,2), so k neq -1 and k neq 3.

Similarly, frac{1}{mu} = frac{t+1}{y_N+1}. 3. **Find expressions for y_M and y_N**:   Given the slope of the line PA as k_{PA} = frac{y_1+2}{x_1-1} = frac{4}{y_1-2}, and setting x=0 in the equation of line PA, we find y_M = frac{-2y_1}{y_1-2} and similarly y_N = frac{-2y_2}{y_2-2}. 4. **Calculate frac{1}{lambda} + frac{1}{mu}**:   Using the expressions for y_M and y_N, we find frac{1}{lambda} + frac{1}{mu} = (t+1)left(frac{-y_1+2}{y_1+2} + frac{-y_2+2}{y_2+2}right) = (t+1)frac{2y_1y_2 + 8}{(y_1+2)(y_2+2)} = 2(t+1). 5. **Given frac{1}{lambda} + frac{1}{mu} = -4**, we solve for t:   Setting 2(t+1) = -4 gives us t = -3.

The equation of this circle is:    [    x^2 + y^2 = 2    ]    Any point (x, y) on this circle satisfies the equation. Since there are infinitely many points on the circle, we can find infinitely many pairs of rational numbers (x, y) such that x^2 + y^2 = 2.    Alternatively, we can use Pythagorean triples. For any Pythagorean triple (a, b, c) with b > a, we can construct rational numbers x = frac{b - a}{c} and y = frac{b + a}{c}. These satisfy:    [    x^2 + y^2 = left(frac{b - a}{c}right)^2 + left(frac{b + a}{c}right)^2 = frac{(b - a)^2 + (b + a)^2}{c^2} = frac{b^2 - 2ab + a^2 + b^2 + 2ab + a^2}{c^2} = frac{2(b^2 + a^2)}{c^2} = 2    ]    since a^2 + b^2 = c^2. 2. **Constructing n Distinct Positive Rational Numbers:**    - If n is even, say n = 2k, we can take k pairs of rational numbers (x_i, y_i) such that x_i^2 + y_i^2 = 2 for i = 1, 2, ldots, k. This gives us 2k = n distinct rational numbers.    - If n is odd, say n = 2k + 1, we can take k pairs of rational numbers (x_i, y_i) such that x_i^2 + y_i^2 = 2 for i = 1, 2, ldots, k, and add the number 1 (since 1^2 = 1). This gives us 2k + 1 = n distinct rational numbers. 3. **Ensuring Distinctness of Rational Numbers:**    To ensure that all the rational numbers are distinct, we need to show that the pairs (x_i, y_i) generated from different Pythagorean triples are distinct. Suppose we have two different primitive Pythagorean triples (a, b, c) and (a', b', c') with c < c'. The rational numbers generated are:    [    x = frac{b - a}{c}, quad y = frac{b + a}{c}, quad x' = frac{b' - a'}{c'}, quad y' = frac{b' + a'}{c'}    ]    If frac{b - a}{c} = frac{b' - a'}{c'} and frac{b + a}{c} = frac{b' + a'}{c'}, then:    [    frac{b - a}{b' - a'} = frac{b + a}{b' + a'} = frac{c}{c'} = lambda in mathbb{Q}    ]    This implies:    [    a^2 + b^2 = c^2 = lambda^2 (c')^2 = lambda^2 ((a')^2 + (b')^2)    ]    and:    [    b^2 - a^2 = lambda^2 ((b')^2 - (a')^2)    ]    Thus:    [    c^2 = lambda^2 (c')^2, quad a^2 = lambda^2 (a')^2, quad b^2 = lambda^2 (b')^2    ]    Since lambda = frac{p}{q} where gcd(p, q) = 1, q must divide a', b', c', which contradicts the fact that our triples are primitive.

She bought 8 packs of yellow bouncy balls, with 10 bouncy balls in each pack, so that's 8 packs * 10 bouncy balls/pack = 80 yellow bouncy balls. Now, let's add the number of red and yellow bouncy balls together: 40 red + 80 yellow = 120 bouncy balls. Maggie bought 160 bouncy balls in total, so to find out how many were green, we subtract the number of red and yellow bouncy balls from the total: 160 total bouncy balls - 120 red and yellow bouncy balls = 40 green bouncy balls. Since each pack contains 10 bouncy balls, we divide the number of green bouncy balls by the number of bouncy balls per pack to find out how many packs of green bouncy balls Maggie bought: 40 green bouncy balls / 10 bouncy balls/pack = 4 packs of green bouncy balls.

After two or more rounds, one player has received 20 counters, another 10 counters, and the third 9 counters. In the last round, the player with 10 counters received the largest number of counters. Who received the middle number on the first round?","output":"1. **Understanding the problem**: We know that there are 3 players and 3 cards, each card having a different positive integer. After two or more rounds, the players have received totals of 20, 10, and 9 counters respectively. We need to determine who received the middle number (not the highest or the lowest) on the first round. 2. **Total sum of integers**: Let the positive integers on the three cards be a, b, and c with a < b < c. Given that the players' total scores sum to 39 (20 + 10 + 9 = 39). The number of rounds is denoted by r. Thus, the total cumulative score over all rounds is:    [    r times (a + b + c) = 39    ]     3. **Factors of 39**:    - The factors of 39 are 1, 3, 13, and 39.    - Each round must deal the sum of the cards to the players, which should be at least 1 + 2 + 3 = 6 because the smallest three different positive integers sum to 6.    - Therefore, the sum of the cards a + b + c must be a reasonable factor of 39 given the number of rounds, and should also be practically feasible. 4. **Possible values for r and a + b + c**:    - Examining potential pairs: (r, a+b+c):      - r = 1 Rightarrow a + b + c = 39 (not practical as a, b, c need to be distinct small integers).      - r = 3 Rightarrow a + b + c = 13.       5. **Determining card values**:    - Since a + b + c = 13, let's check feasible values:      [      begin{aligned}         & {1, 4, 8} Rightarrow 1 + 4 + 8 = 13          & {2, 3, 8} Rightarrow 2 + 3 + 8 = 13          & {2, 4, 7} Rightarrow 2 + 4 + 7 = 13          & {1, 5, 7} Rightarrow 1 + 5 + 7 = 13       end{aligned}      ]     6. **Evaluating the highest card constraint**:    - The player with 20 points must have received the highest value card multiple times, meaning the highest value card (c) must be at least 7 if used 3 times (since 7 * 3 < 20 < 8 * 3). Hence c geq 7. 7. **Checking composition for given scenarios**:    - The only feasible sums are: 1, 4, 8 and 1, 5, 7     8. **Rechecking specific combinations**:    - Checking {1, 4, 8}:      [      begin{aligned}      & text{Sum: } 1 + 4 + 8 = 13       & text{Combination for 20 points: } 8, 8, 4       & text{Combination for 10 points: } 8, 1, 1       & text{Combination for 9 points: } 4, 4, 1       end{aligned}      ]    - This works and fits the highest card requirement. 9. **Solving for the first round**:    - Given the specific sums, the player with 20 counters could receive (8), (8), (4).    - The last round configuration:      [      begin{aligned}        & text{Player with 20 receives: 4}         & text{Player with 10 receives: 8}         & text{Player with 9 receives: 1}       end{aligned}      ]    - Hence, the player who receives the middle card 4 most probably historically had this pattern:      [      begin{aligned}        & text{First round: Player with 9 receives: 4 (consistent with score pattern).}      end{aligned}      ]       10. **Conclusion**:    - The player who had the middle number card (4) on the **first round** was:      [      boxed{text{Player with 9 counters}}      ]"},{"instruction":"Given that a and b are reciprocals, c and d are opposites, e < 0 and |e| = 1, then the value of (ab)^{2009}  (c+d)^{2010}  e^{2011} is.","output":"Since a and b are reciprocals, and c and d are opposites, we have ab = 1 and c + d = 0.

The artist estimates needing an extra 10% of the initial calculated paint volume for these purposes. He currently has 157 liters of paint left from his last project. Calculate the total amount of paint he needs (including the extra 10%) and how much additional paint he needs to purchase.","output":"First, let's calculate the amount of paint needed for one side of the wings: Each wing has 7 feathers, and each feather has 3 sections, so there are 7 * 3 = 21 sections per wing. Since there are two wings, the total number of sections is 21 * 2 = 42 sections. Each section requires 3 layers of paint, so the total number of layers for all sections is 42 * 3 = 126 layers. Each layer consumes 0.15 liters of paint per section, so the total amount of paint needed for all layers is 126 * 0.15 = 18.9 liters. Since the artist needs to paint both sides of the wings, the total amount of paint needed for both sides is 18.9 * 2 = 37.8 liters. Now, let's calculate the extra paint needed for touch-ups and potential mistakes: The artist estimates needing an extra 10% of the initial calculated paint volume.

Here's a detailed step-by-step explanation. We will focus on two spheres ( S_i ) and ( S_j ) with a single point of tangency ( X ). Let: - ( P ) be a point outside the spheres. - ( x ) is the distance ( PX ). - ( y ) is the length of the tangent from ( P ) to ( S_i ). - ( z ) is the length of the tangent from ( P ) to ( S_j ). On each of the spheres, we consider: - The centers ( O ) and ( O' ) of the spheres ( S_i ) and ( S_j ), respectively, both having radius 1. - The tangents from ( P ) form lines ( PY ) and ( PZ ) touching ( S_i ) and ( S_j ) at points ( Y ) and ( Z ) respectively.  Step 1: Using the Cosine Rule 1. Let's place ( O ) and ( O' ) so that they are 2 units apart since both have radius 1 and are tangent at ( X ). Thus, ( OO' = 2 ). 2. Denote the angle between ( PX ) and the line of centers ( OX ) as ( theta ).  Step 2: Distance Calculation by Cosine Rule Using the law of cosines in ( triangle POX ): [ PO^2 = PX^2 + OX^2 - 2 cdot PX cdot OX cdot cos(theta) ] Since ( OX = 1 ): [ PO^2 = x^2 + 1 - 2x cos(theta) ] Since ( PY ) is tangential, we have: [ PY^2 = PO^2 - OY^2 ] And ( OY ) is the radius (1), thus: [ PY^2 = x^2 + 1 - 2x cos(theta) - 1 ] [ PY^2 = x^2 - 2x cos(theta) ] [ PY = sqrt{x^2 - 2x cos(theta)} ] Similarly, for point ( Z ) on sphere ( S_j ): [ PO'^2 = PX^2 + O'X^2 + 2 cdot PX cdot O'X cdot cos(theta) ] [ PO'^2 = x^2 + 1 + 2x cos(theta) ] Thus,  [ PZ^2 = PO'^2 - O'Z^2 ] [ PZ^2 = x^2 + 1 + 2x cos(theta) - 1 ] [ PZ^2 = x^2 + 2x cos(theta) ] [ PZ = sqrt{x^2 + 2x cos(theta)} ]  Step 3: Multiplying the Tangent Lengths To show ( x^2 geq y cdot z ): [ y^2 cdot z^2 = (x^2 - 2x cos(theta)) cdot (x^2 + 2x cos(theta)) ] Using the difference of squares, [ y^2 z^2 = (x^2 - (2x cos(theta))^2) = x^4 - (2x cos theta)^2 = x^4 - 4x^2 cos^2(theta) ] Since (cos^2(theta) leq 1): [ y^2 z^2 leq x^4 ] Thus, [ y z leq x^2 ]  Conclusion: [ PY cdot PZ leq PX^2 ] So if this holds for each pair of tangents and points of contact, we have: [ x_1 x_2 ldots x_n geq y_1 y_2 ldots y_n ] [ boxed{x_1 x_2 ldots x_n geq y_1 y_2 ldots y_n} ]"},{"instruction":"A triangle has side lengths of 10, 24, and 26 units.

Substitution of (x = -1):     Each term of this sum involves a factor which includes ((x + 1)).

Similarly, label the rows from (1) to (10), classify these as \\"odd rows\\" and \\"even rows\\". 3. **Define Checkerboard Squares**:    We color the board in a checkerboard pattern, so a black square appears in odd row odd column positions, even row even column positions. 4. **Stones in Squares**:    Let:    - (k_1) be the number of black squares in odd rows and odd columns that contain an odd number of stones.    - (k_2) be the number of black squares in even rows and even columns that contain an odd number of stones.    - (k_3) be the number of black squares in odd rows and even columns or even rows and odd columns that contain an odd number of stones. 5. **Odd Row Property**:    Since every row has to have an odd number of stones, this means the sum for each row must be odd.

This follows because the difference between two squares:    [    a^2 text{ and } 3a^2 text{ (which can both be expressed as squares for certain values of }3atext{), is always an even number. }    ]    This can be generalized as the difference of squares can be written as:    [    a^2 - 3a = a(a - 3)    ]    Since the product of two integers (either both odd or both even) results in an even number, (a(a - 3)) is always even. Thus, the only even prime number that (left|a^2 - 3a - 6right|) can equal is 2. 2. **Setting Up Equations:**    We need to find (a) such that:    [    left| a^2 - 3a - 6 right| = 2    ]    This means there are two cases to consider:    [    a^2 - 3a - 6 = 2 quad text{and} quad a^2 - 3a - 6 = -2    ] 3. **Solving the First Equation:**    [    a^2 - 3a - 6 = 2 implies a^2 - 3a - 8 = 0    ]    We solve the quadratic equation using the quadratic formula:    [    a = frac{-b pm sqrt{b^2 - 4ac}}{2a}    ]    For (a^2 - 3a - 8 = 0), where (a = 1), (b = -3), and (c = -8):    [    a = frac{3 pm sqrt{(-3)^2 - 4 cdot 1 cdot (-8)}}{2 cdot 1}    ]    [    a = frac{3 pm sqrt{9 + 32}}{2}    ]    [    a = frac{3 pm sqrt{41}}{2}    ]    Since (sqrt{41}) is not an integer, this equation has no integer solutions. 4. **Solving the Second Equation:**    [    a^2 - 3a - 6 = -2 implies a^2 - 3a - 4 = 0    ]    Using the quadratic formula again:    [    a = frac{3 pm sqrt{9 + 16}}{2}    ]    [    a = frac{3 pm sqrt{25}}{2}    ]    [    a = frac{3 pm 5}{2}    ]    This gives us two solutions:    [    a = frac{3 + 5}{2} = 4 quad text{and} quad a = frac{3 - 5}{2} = -1    ] 5. **Conclusion:**    The integer values of (a) for which (left|a^2 - 3a - 6right|) is a prime number are:    [    boxed{-1 text{ and } 4}    ] Thus, the integers (a) that satisfy the given condition are ( boxed{-1 text{ and } 4} )."},{"instruction":"Using a steel strip with a total length of 14.8 mathrm{~m} to create the frame of a rectangular container, if one side of the base of the container is 0.5 mathrm{~m} longer than the other side, what height will achieve the maximum volume of the container?

(2) To find the sum of the distances from points F_1 and F_2 to line l, we first need to find the coordinates of these points. The foci of an ellipse with equation frac{x^2}{a^2}+frac{y^2}{b^2}=1 are (pm c, 0), where c=sqrt{a^2-b^2}. For our ellipse, a=2 and b=sqrt{3}, so c=sqrt{4-3}=1. Thus, the coordinates of the foci are F_1(-1,0) and F_2(1,0). The distance d from a point (x_1,y_1) to a line Ax+By+C=0 is given by the formula d=frac{|Ax_1+By_1+C|}{sqrt{A^2+B^2}}. For line l (y=x-2 or x-y-2=0), the distance from point F_1 is: d_1=frac{|-1-0-2|}{sqrt{1^2+(-1)^2}}=frac{3sqrt{2}}{2} Similarly, the distance from point F_2 is: d_2=frac{|1-0-2|}{sqrt{1^2+(-1)^2}}=frac{sqrt{2}}{2} Therefore, the sum of these distances is: d_1+d_2=frac{3sqrt{2}}{2}+frac{sqrt{2}}{2}=boxed{2sqrt{2}}"},{"instruction":"Given that A and B are two events, P(A)=0.4, P(B|A)=0.3, P(B|overline{A})=0.2, then () A: P(overline{A}B)=0.12 B: P(B)=0.14 C: P(A|B)=0.5 D: P(A+B)=0.64","output":"To solve this problem, we will break down the solution into detailed steps, following the given information and the rules of probability. **Step 1: Calculate P(overline{A})** Given P(A)=0.4, we can find the probability of the complement of A, denoted as overline{A}, using the formula P(overline{A})=1-P(A).

Since ( K ) is a finite field, the number of elements in ( K ) must be a power of a prime. Here, ( 8 = 2^3 ), so ( K ) is a finite field of characteristic 2 with ( 2^3 = 8 ) elements. 2. In a finite field of characteristic 2, every element ( x ) satisfies ( x + x = 0 ), which implies ( x = -x ). 3. The multiplicative group ( K^* ) of the field ( K ) (i.e., the set of nonzero elements of ( K )) is cyclic of order ( 7 ) (since ( 8 - 1 = 7 )). 4. Let ( g ) be a generator of the cyclic group ( K^* ). Then every nonzero element of ( K ) can be written as ( g^i ) for ( i = 0, 1, 2, ldots, 6 ). 5. Consider the polynomial ( x^7 - 1 ) over ( K ). Since ( K ) has 8 elements, the polynomial ( x^7 - 1 ) factors completely over ( K ) as:    [    x^7 - 1 = (x - 1)(x^6 + x^5 + x^4 + x^3 + x^2 + x + 1)    ] 6. In characteristic 2, the polynomial ( x^6 + x^5 + x^4 + x^3 + x^2 + x + 1 ) can be factored further. Notice that:    [    x^6 + x^5 + x^4 + x^3 + x^2 + x + 1 = (x^3 + x + 1)(x^3 + x^2 + 1)    ]    This factorization holds because the product of these two polynomials gives the original polynomial in characteristic 2. 7. Therefore, we have:    [    x^7 - 1 = (x - 1)(x^3 + x + 1)(x^3 + x^2 + 1)    ] 8. Since ( K ) is a field, every nonzero element ( x in K ) must satisfy one of the factors being zero.

If ( x^3 + x + 1 = 0 ), then we have found the element ( x ) such that ( x^3 = x + 1 ). 10. If ( x^3 + x^2 + 1 = 0 ), consider ( y = x + 1 ). Then:     [     y^3 = (x + 1)^3 = x^3 + 1 = (x^2 + x + 1) + 1 = x^3 + x^2 + 1 = 0     ]     [     y^3 + y + 1 = (x + 1)^3 + (x + 1) + 1 = x^3 + 1 + x + 1 + 1 = x^3 + x + 1 = 0     ]     Thus, ( y ) satisfies ( y^3 = y + 1 ).

Step-by-Step Process: 1. **Initial Condition**:     - The initial number on the board is (27). 2. **First Minute**:     - Calculate the product of the digits of (27):     [     2 times 7 = 14     ]     - Add (12) to this product:     [     14 + 12 = 26     ]     - The number on the board after the first minute is (26). 3. **Second Minute**:     - Calculate the product of the digits of (26):     [     2 times 6 = 12     ]     - Add (12) to this product:     [     12 + 12 = 24     ]     - The number on the board after the second minute is (24). 4. **Third Minute**:     - Calculate the product of the digits of (24):     [     2 times 4 = 8     ]     - Add (12) to this product:     [     8 + 12 = 20     ]     - The number on the board after the third minute is (20). 5. **Fourth Minute**:     - Calculate the product of the digits of (20):     [     2 times 0 = 0     ]     - Add (12) to this product:     [     0 + 12 = 12     ]     - The number on the board after the fourth minute is (12). 6. **Fifth Minute**:     - Calculate the product of the digits of (12):     [     1 times 2 = 2     ]     - Add (12) to this product:     [     2 + 12 = 14     ]     - The number on the board after the fifth minute is (14). 7. **Sixth Minute**:     - Calculate the product of the digits of (14):     [     1 times 4 = 4     ]     - Add (12) to this product:     [     4 + 12 = 16     ]     - The number on the board after the sixth minute is (16). 8. **Seventh Minute**:     - Calculate the product of the digits of (16):     [     1 times 6 = 6     ]     - Add (12) to this product:     [     6 + 12 = 18     ]     - The number on the board after the seventh minute is (18). 9. **Eighth Minute**:     - Calculate the product of the digits of (18):     [     1 times 8 = 8     ]     - Add (12) to this product:     [     8 + 12 = 20     ]     - The number on the board after the eighth minute is (20). 10. **Cycle Identification**:     - We can observe that the number (20) appears again after the eighth minute. Repeating the computations from here would show the same sequence: (20, 12, 14, 16, 18), and back to (20) every 6 minutes.  Conclusion: Since we identified that the sequence (20, 12, 14, 16, 18) repeats every 6 minutes, we evaluate what the number on the board will be after (60) minutes.  - (60) modulo (6) is (0). Therefore, after (60) minutes, the number on the board will be the same as the number that appears as the 0-th further position of the repeating sequence, which is (14). Thus, after (60) minutes, the number on the board is: [ boxed{14} ]"},{"instruction":"One side of a rectangle is 5 text{ cm}, and the other side is the smallest twodigit number that is divisible by 3.

First, we calculate the probability of picking a red ball on the first draw. There are 6 red balls out of a total of 6 + 4 + 2 = 12 balls. So the probability of drawing a red ball first is: P(Red1) = Number of red balls / Total number of balls P(Red1) = 6/12 P(Red1) = 1/2 After one red ball has been drawn, there are now 5 red balls left and a total of 11 balls remaining in the bag. So the probability of drawing a second red ball is: P(Red2) = Number of red balls remaining / Total number of balls remaining P(Red2) = 5/11 Now, we multiply the two probabilities together to find the probability of both events happening: P(Both Red) = P(Red1) * P(Red2) P(Both Red) = (1/2) * (5/11) P(Both Red) = 5/22 Therefore, the probability that both balls picked are red is boxed{5/22} ."},{"instruction":"The odd function f(x) is an increasing function on the interval [3,7], with a maximum value of 8 and a minimum value of 1 on the interval [3,6].

Adjacent angles are two angles that have a common side and a common vertex. Whether they are complementary (sum up to 90 degrees) depends on the specific situation. However, the statement as a general rule is not accurate, making it seem like a potential answer. But, the question asks for an incorrect statement about angles formed by two lines intersected by a third line, which implies a context of intersecting lines, not the general relationship between any adjacent angles. Therefore, this might not be the intended incorrect statement. - **C: Corresponding angles are equal.** This statement is true only under the condition that the two lines are parallel and are intersected by a third line (the transversal). The question does not specify that the two lines are parallel, making this statement incorrect in the general case. Therefore, this is the incorrect statement we are looking for. - **D: If alternate interior angles are equal, then corresponding angles are also equal.** This statement is true when dealing with parallel lines intersected by a transversal.

Therefore, f(x) = log_a(x - 1 + k) - log_a(1 - x) is increasing on (1 - k, 1). - When 0 < a < 1, both y = log_a(x - 1 + k) and y = -log_a(1 - x) are decreasing on the interval (1 - k, 1). Therefore, f(x) = log_a(x - 1 + k) - log_a(1 - x) is decreasing on (1 - k, 1). So, f(x) is increasing on (1 - k, 1) when a > 1 and decreasing on (1 - k, 1) when 0 < a < 1. (2) If f(x) is an odd function, then f(x) + f(-x) = 0 holds true on (1 - k, 1). This implies that log_a(x - 1 + k) - log_a(1 - x) + log_a(-x - 1 + k) - log_a(1 + x) = 0 on (1 - k, 1). Simplifying, we get log_a[(k - 1)^2 - x^2] = log_a(1 - x^2) on (1 - k, 1). This leads to (k - 1)^2 - x^2 = 1 - x^2 on (1 - k, 1). Thus, (k - 1)^2 = 1, which gives us k = 0 or k = 2. Since k > 0, we have boxed{k = 2}. (3) f(x) > 0 iff log_a(x - 1 + k) > log_a(1 - x). - When a > 1, since y = log_a x is increasing on (0, +infty), we have the system of inequalities begin{cases} x - 1 + k > 1 - x,  1 - k < x < 1. end{cases} Solving this system gives us 1 - frac{k}{2} < x < 1. - When 0 < a < 1, since y = log_a x is decreasing on (0, +infty), we have the system of inequalities begin{cases} x - 1 + k < 1 - x,  1 - k < x < 1. end{cases} Solving this system gives us 1 - k < x < 1 - frac{k}{2}.

Define the points and segments as follows:     - Let ( K_1 ) be the midpoint of (AA_1).     - Let ( K_2 ) be the midpoint of (BB_1).     - Let ( K_3 ) be the midpoint of (CC_1). 2. Consider the cevians (AA_1), (BB_1), and (CC_1). These cevians intersect the opposite sides at (A_1), (B_1), and (C_1), respectively. 3. Suppose (M) is the midpoint of (AA_1), lying on the cevians (AA_1). Similarly, define midpoints (N) on (BB_1) and (O) on (CC_1). 4. In triangle (ABC):     - The line segment connecting the midpoints of two sides (e.g., the midline) is parallel to the third side, and its length is half the length of the third side (Midpoint Theorem). 5.

In triangle (ABA_1):     - The line (M C_2) is a midline, making it parallel to (BC).  7.

This line would divide the plane into two half-planes. According to Dirichlet's principle, two vertices of the triangle (A), (B), and (C) must lie in one of these half-planes. 3. Without loss of generality, assume (A) and (B) are in the same half-plane. 4. The side (AB) connecting vertices (A) and (B) must therefore not intersect the hypothetical line. 5. However, if ( K_1 ), ( K_2 ), and ( K_3 ) are midpoints of cevians within triangle (ABC) and lie on this line, (AB) would have to intersect this line due to the construction of midpoints and the positions within the triangle. 6.

Specifically, there are 5 horizontal potential seams and 5 vertical potential seams, totaling 10 potential seams. 2. **Criteria for Blocking Potential Seams:**     - A seam is considered “blocked” if it is intersected by the placement of the dominoes such that the seam no longer runs uninterrupted from one side of the square to the opposite side. This effectively means that a seam is blocked by having dominoes cross it at multiple points. 3. **Domino Interaction with Seams:**     - Each domino can cover two adjacent cells, either horizontally or vertically.     - If a potential seam intersects a domino exactly once, then removing this domino would divide the grid along that seam, resulting in two parts with an odd number of cells each (which is impossible because each domino covers exactly 2 cells). Thus, a seam intersected by a single domino indicates insufficient covering. 4. **Require Double Intersections:**     - Therefore, to block a potential seam, the seam must intersect at least two dominoes. For all 10 potential seams to be blocked, this requirement implies having at least (2 times 10 = 20) intersections by the dominoes. 5. **Dominoes Limitation:**     - However, we only have 18 dominoes available. Each domino covers 2 cells, resulting in (18 times 2 = 36) cells, exactly covering the (6 times 6) square.     - Since 20 intersections (intersecting dominoes) are required to ensure all 10 potential seams are blocked, having only 18 dominoes means it's impossible to meet this requirement. 6. **Conclusion:**     - It is therefore clear that with only 18 dominoes, it is impossible to cover the (6 times 6) square and block all the potential seams between unit cells properly.     - Thus, attempting to cover a (6 times 6) square with 18 dominoes (1 times 2) without creating an uninterrupted seam running across the square from one side to the opposite side is impossible.

The total number of bugs eaten by all four creatures is 63, so we can write the equation: G + G/2 + 3G/2 + 4.5G/4 = 63 To solve for G, we first need to find a common denominator to combine the terms.

Consider the sum ( s = x_1 + x_2 + cdots + x_n ):      [      s = sum_{i=1}^{n} x_i quad text{and} quad s = sum_{i=1}^{n} (x_1 x_i + 1) quad (bmod p)      ]      Simplifying,      [      s = x_1 cdot s + n quad (bmod p)      ]      Which rearranges to:      [      s - x_1 s equiv n pmod{p} quad Rightarrow quad s(1 - x_1) equiv n pmod{p}      ]      If ( s equiv 0 pmod{p} ), then ( n equiv 0 pmod{p} ), a contradiction since ( 1 leq n < p ).      Otherwise,      [      x_1 equiv frac{n}{s} pmod{p}      ]      Repeating similar analogies with other ( x_i )’s leads to contradictions unless ( G = mathbb{F}_p ). 4. **Conclusion**:        Given any element ( s in S ), and any prime ( p ) that does not divide ( s^2 - s + 1 ), the elements of ( S ) modulo ( p ) will include all elements of ( mathbb{F}_p ). Thus, there are finitely many primes which do not divide any element of ( S ).

Let A(x_{1},y_{1}) and B(x_{2},y_{2}), therefore y_{1}+y_{2}=-8, y_{1}y_{2}=-8b, Let the center of the circle be Q(x_{0},y_{0}), then we have x_{0}= frac{1}{2}(x_{1}+x_{2}), y_{0}= frac{1}{2}(y_{1}+y_{2})=-4. Since the circle with diameter AB is tangent to the x-axis, the radius of the circle is r=|y_{0}|=4, And |AB|= sqrt{(1+4)[(y_{1}+y_{2})^{2}-4y_{1}y_{2}]}= sqrt{5(64+32b)}. therefore |AB|=2r, which means sqrt{5(64+32b)}=8, Solving this gives b=- frac{8}{5}. therefore x_{0}= frac{1}{2}(x_{1}+x_{2})=2b+8= frac{24}{5}, therefore The center of the circle is ( frac{24}{5},-4).

A: Sufficient but not necessary condition B: Necessary but not sufficient condition C: Necessary and sufficient condition D: Neither sufficient nor necessary conditio","output":"To solve the problem, we start by analyzing the given equation and its transformation: 1. We have the equation x-2=sqrt{x^2-4x+4}.  2. Recognizing that the expression under the square root is a perfect square, we rewrite the equation as x-2=|x-2|. This is because sqrt{x^2-4x+4} = sqrt{(x-2)^2} = |x-2|. 3. The absolute value equation x-2=|x-2| leads us to consider two cases: when x-2 geq 0 and when x-2 < 0.    - If x-2 geq 0, then |x-2| = x-2, which is always true for x geq 2.    - If x-2 < 0, then |x-2| = -(x-2), which cannot hold since it would imply x-2 = -(x-2), leading to x-2 = 0-0, which is not consistent with x-2 < 0. 4. Therefore, the condition x-2=|x-2| is satisfied if and only if x geq 2. From this analysis, we conclude that x=2 is indeed a solution to the equation x-2=sqrt{x^2-4x+4}, but it is not the only solution since any x geq 2 satisfies the equation. Therefore, x=2 is a specific case of the broader condition x geq 2. - This means that \\"x=2\\" is a sufficient condition for the equation x-2=sqrt{x^2-4x+4} because if x=2, the equation is satisfied. - However, it is not a necessary condition because there are other values of x (specifically, any x geq 2) that also satisfy the equation.
