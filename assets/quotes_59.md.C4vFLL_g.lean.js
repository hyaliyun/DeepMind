The total salary of all the workers can be calculated as: Total salary = Average salary of all workers * Total number of workers Total salary = 9500 * 12 The total salary of the 7 technicians can be calculated as: Total salary of technicians = Average salary of technicians * Number of technicians Total salary of technicians = 12000 * 7 Now, let's calculate the total salary of the rest of the workers: Total salary of the rest = Total salary - Total salary of technicians Total salary of the rest = (9500 * 12) - (12000 * 7) Now we can find the average salary of the rest of the workers by dividing the total salary of the rest by the number of the rest of the workers: Average salary of the rest = Total salary of the rest / Number of the rest of the workers Average salary of the rest = [(9500 * 12) - (12000 * 7)] / 5 Let's calculate it step by step: Total salary of all workers = 9500 * 12 = 114000 Total salary of technicians = 12000 * 7 = 84000 Total salary of the rest = 114000 - 84000 = 30000 Average salary of the rest = 30000 / 5 = 6000 So, the average salary of the rest of the workers is Rs. boxed{6000} ."},{"instruction":"takes Mina 90 seconds to walk down an escalator when it is not operating, and 30 seconds to walk down when it is operating.

First, identify the number of trees planted along the edges of rectangle (ABCD).     - The number of trees on edge (AD): 49 trees     - The number of trees on edge (AB): 25 trees 2. Note that the number of trees on opposite edges of the rectangle should be the same given the planting pattern. Therefore:     - Number of trees on edge (BC) = Number of trees on edge (AD) = 49 trees     - Number of trees on edge (CD) = Number of trees on edge (AB) = 25 trees 3. Thus, we can assume the dimensions of the rectangle (ABCD) are:     - (AD = BC = 49) (trees)     - (AB = CD = 25) (trees) 4. The trees are evenly spaced along the edges. For a given edge of length (L) with (n) trees, the space between the trees is (frac{L}{n-1}). 5. For a square (CEFG) with side equal to one dimension of the rectangle, let's assume (CE = EF = FG = GC). We need to calculate the number of trees planted around this square.     - Since (CEFG) is a square and aligns with (BC = 49), the number of trees per side = 49 6.

Therefore, we conclude that a neq 0. 2. The element 0 in the second representation must correspond to frac{b}{a} in the first representation.

Show that among them, we can find two disjoint subsets of integers with the same sum.","output":"1. **Determine the number of possible subsets**:        Given 10 integers, we can choose or not choose each integer to form a subset. Hence, the total number of subsets for 10 integers is:    [    2^{10} = 1024    ]        This includes all possible subsets, ranging from the empty subset to the subset containing all 10 integers. 2. **Evaluate possible sums of subsets**:    Each subset will have a sum of its elements, and we need to assess the range of these sums. The integers are two-digit numbers between 10 and 99. Specifically:        - The smallest possible sum (with the smallest integers, from 10 to the 10th smallest one, 19):      [      10 + 11 + 12 + 13 + 14 + 15 + 16 + 17 + 18 + 19 = 145      ]        - The largest possible sum (with the largest integers, from 90 to the 10th largest, 99):      [      90 + 91 + 92 + 93 + 94 + 95 + 96 + 97 + 98 + 99 = 955      ]        Hence, all possible sums of the subsets of these 10 integers fall in the range from 145 to 955. 3. **Apply the Pigeonhole Principle**:        Even though not every integer within this range will be reachable (145 to 955), there are fewer potential sums than there are subsets. Specifically, there are:        [    955 - 145 + 1 = 811    ]        possible sums within this range.        Since there are 1024 possible subsets but only 811 possible sums (and some sums outside this range might be feasible from subsets not starting at the smallest or largest sums calculated), it follows from the Pigeonhole Principle that multiple subsets must share the same sum. 4. **Find disjoint subsets**:        If two subsets (A) and (B) share the same sum, they may not be disjoint. However, they can be made disjoint by considering their intersection (C). Subsets (A setminus C) and (B setminus C) will then be disjoint subsets. 5. **Conclusion**:        By removing the common elements from (A) and (B), the remaining elements in these subsets ( A setminus C ) and ( B setminus C ) will be disjoint and still have the same sums.

From the given condition, a+ln x^{2}leqslant a|x| always holds, which is equivalent to a-at+2ln tleqslant 0 always holding for t > 0, Let h(t)=a-at+2ln t, then h'(t)= frac {2}{t}-a= frac {2-at}{t}, When aleqslant 0, h'(t) > 0, hence h(t) is monotonically increasing on (0,+infty), Since h(1)=0, for t > 1, h(t) > h(1)=0, which contradicts the given condition. When a > 0, h'(t)= frac {-a(t- frac {2}{a})}{t}, so for 0 < t < frac {2}{a}, h'(t) > 0; For t > frac {2}{a}, h'(t) < 0, Thus, h(t) is monotonically increasing on (0, frac {2}{a}) and monotonically decreasing on ( frac {2}{a},+infty), That is, h(t)_{max}=h( frac {2}{a})=a-2+2ln 2-2ln a. Therefore, to ensure h(t)leqslant 0 always holds for t > 0, it is only necessary that h(t)_{max}leqslant 0, i.e., a-2+2ln 2-2ln aleqslant 0, Let varphi(a)=a-2+2ln 2-2ln a, then varphi'(a)=1- frac {2}{a}= frac {a-2}{a}, So when 0 < a < 2, varphi'(a) < 0; when a > 2, varphi'(a) > 0, That is, varphi(a) is monotonically decreasing on (0,2) and monotonically increasing on (2,+infty). Also, varphi(2)=0, so the only a that satisfies the condition is 2, That is, a=2. 2. Proof: From (1), we know g(x)= frac {xf(x)}{x-a}= frac {2x+2xln x}{x-2}(x > 2), So g'(x)= frac {2(x-2ln x-4)}{(x-2)^{2}}, Let s(x)=x-2ln x-4, then s'(x)=1- frac {2}{x}= frac {x-2}{x}, Since x > 2, s'(x) > 0, that is, s(x) is monotonically increasing on (2,+infty); Also, s(8) < 0, s(9) > 0, So there exists x_{0}in(8,9), such that s(x_{0})=0, And when 2 < x < x_{0}, s(x) < 0; when x > x_{0}, s(x) > 0, That is, g(x) is monotonically decreasing on (2,x_{0}) and monotonically increasing on (x_{0},+infty). Therefore, g(x)_{min}=g(x_{0})= frac {2x_{0}+2x_{0}ln x_{0}}{x_{0}-2}= frac {x_{0}^{2}-2x_{0}}{x_{0}-2}=x_{0} (since 2ln x_{0}=x_{0}-4) That is, m=x_{0}, so f(m)=f(x_{0})=2+2ln x_{0}=x_{0}-2in(6,7), That is, boxed{6 < f(m) < 7}."},{"instruction":"Circles with radii 4 and 8 are externally tangent to each other and internally tangent to a larger circle.

This is because if ( a > b ), then ( p(a) + p(b) geq p(a-1) + p(b+1) ). 6. **Reducing to two consecutive integers:**    By repeatedly applying the transformation, we can reduce the sequence to consist of exactly two consecutive integers, say ( a ) and ( a+1 ), with multiplicities ( x ) and ( 100-x ) respectively. 7. **Formulating the inequality:**    Let ( a ) be the smaller integer and ( a+1 ) be the larger integer.

The maximum value of ( a ) is 99 because ( p(100) ) would exceed ( 100 cdot 99 cdot 98 cdots 79 ). 9. **Calculating the sum:**    If ( a = 99 ), then ( a+1 = 100 ). The sum of the sequence is:    [    99x + 100(100-x) = 10000 - x    ]    To satisfy the inequality, ( x ) must be such that ( 10000 - x leq 9900 ).

We need to prove that (det(AB - BA) = 0). 2. **Introduce New Matrices:**    Define ( P := A + B ) and ( Q := A - B ). Given that ( Q^2 = (A - B)^2 = O_n ), we know that ( Q ) is a nilpotent matrix. 3. **Express ( AB - BA ) in Terms of ( P ) and ( Q ):**    We have:    [    AB - BA = frac{1}{2}((A + B)(A - B) - (A - B)(A + B)) = frac{1}{2}(PQ - QP)    ]    Therefore:    [    4(AB - BA) = 2(QP - PQ)    ]    Let ( M := QP - PQ ).

Hence, the rank of ( Q ) is strictly less than ( frac{n}{2} ):    [    text{rank}(Q) < frac{n}{2}    ]    Consequently, the rank of ( M ) is at most twice the rank of ( Q ):    [    text{rank}(M) leq 2 cdot text{rank}(Q) < n    ]    Since ( text{rank}(M) < n ), ( M ) is not invertible, implying that ( det(M) = 0 ). 5. **Jordan Normal Form (JNF) Argument:**    Consider the Jordan normal form of ( Q ). Since ( Q ) is nilpotent, its Jordan blocks are either of size 1 or 2. Given that ( n ) is odd, there must be at least one Jordan block of size 1, corresponding to an eigenvalue of 0. This implies that there exists a non-zero vector ( x ) in ( ker(Q) ) that is not in ( text{Im}(Q) ). 6. **Invariant Subspace Argument:**    Let ( V ) be the subspace spanned by such vectors ( x ). Since ( M = QP - PQ ), it permutes the Jordan blocks of ( Q ). Therefore, ( V ) is ( M )-invariant. Choose ( x in V ) such that ( x neq 0 ). Then:    [    y = Mx = (QP - PQ)x = QPx    ]    Since ( y in V ) and ( y in text{Im}(Q) ), we have ( y = 0 ), leading to a contradiction if ( M ) were invertible. Thus, ( det(AB - BA) = 0 ).

He sold his baseball cards for 25, with 5% tax included. He got 10 for his baseball bat, excluding tax, and agreed to sell his 30 baseball glove at 20% off, with a 8% tax rate applied. He also sold two pairs of his baseball cleats for 10 each. One of the buyers paid him in euros, with an exchange rate of 1 USD = 0.85 EUR, and a tax rate of 10%. The second buyer negotiated a 15% discount on the cleats and paid in USD; taxes for this transaction were 7%. How much money did Grant make?","output":"Let's calculate each transaction separately: 1. Baseball cards: The price of 25 includes a 5% tax. To find the pre-tax price, we divide by 1.05 (100% + 5% tax = 105% = 1.05). Pre-tax price of baseball cards = 25 / 1.05 = 23.81 (rounded to two decimal places) 2. Baseball bat: The baseball bat was sold for 10, excluding tax, so the total amount received for the bat is 10. 3. Baseball glove: The glove was sold at 20% off the 30 price, so the discount is 20% of 30 = 0.20 * 30 = 6. Discounted price of the glove = 30 - 6 = 24. Now we need to add an 8% tax to the discounted price. Tax on the glove = 8% of 24 = 0.08 * 24 = 1.92. Total price received for the glove = 24 + 1.92 = 25.92. 4. First pair of baseball cleats: The buyer paid in euros with a 10% tax rate. The price in USD is 10. First, we calculate the pre-tax price in USD by dividing by 1.10 (100% + 10% tax = 110% = 1.10). Pre-tax price of cleats in USD = 10 / 1.10 = 9.09 (rounded to two decimal places) Now we convert this to euros using the exchange rate of 1 USD = 0.85 EUR. Amount in euros = 9.09 * 0.85 = €7.73 (rounded to two decimal places) 5. Second pair of baseball cleats: The buyer negotiated a 15% discount on the 10 price, so the discount is 15% of 10 = 0.15 * 10 = 1.50. Discounted price of the cleats = 10 - 1.50 = 8.50. Now we need to add a 7% tax to the discounted price. Tax on the cleats = 7% of 8.50 = 0.07 * 8.50 = 0.60. Total price received for the cleats = 8.50 + 0.60 = 9.10. Now, let's add up all the amounts received: Baseball cards = 23.81 Baseball bat = 10.00 Baseball glove = 25.92 First pair of cleats (in euros, converted to USD) = 9.09 Second pair of cleats = 9.10 Total amount made = 23.81 + 10.00 + 25.92 + 9.09 + 9.10 = 77.92 Grant made a total of boxed{77.92}  from selling his baseball gear."},{"instruction":"f point P (3,4) and point Q (a,b) are symmetrical about the line xy1=0, then (　　) A: a=1, b=2 B: a=2, b=1 C: a=4, b=3 D: a=5, b=2","output":"Let point Q (a, b) be the point symmetrical to point P (3, 4) with respect to the line x - y - 1 = 0.

This sequence is:    [    1, 2, 3, 4, ldots, 99, 100    ] 2. **Pairing and Swapping:**    Next, we divide these numbers into 50 pairs of consecutive numbers:    [    (1, 2), (3, 4), ldots, (99, 100)    ]    Within each pair, we swap the two numbers to get a new sequence:    [    2, 1, 4, 3, ldots, 100, 99    ] 3. **Verification of the Rearranged Sequence:**    - **Observation (a):**       In the rearranged sequence, any number at an odd position is greater by 1 than its position number, and any number at an even position is less by 1 than its position number. Specifically, the sum of any two adjacent numbers is equal to the sum of their positions.    - **Observation (b):**       Consider the sum of any n consecutive numbers in this sequence.            - If ( n ) is even, say ( n = 2k ), then the sum of the numbers will correspond to the sum of ( 2k ) positions, which simplifies as follows:        For example, the sum of positions ( i ) through ( i + 2k - 1 ):        [        sum_{j=i}^{i+2k-1} j = ki + k(i+1) + ldots + k(i+2k-1)        ]        This is:        [        = k times sum_{m=i}^{i+2k-1}m = k(i + i+1 + ldots + (i+2k-1))        ]        Which always yields an integer that is not divisible by ( 2k ), the amount of numbers summed.            - If ( n ) is odd, say ( n = 2k+1 ), the sum involves an alternating pattern within the rearrangement (each odd position is incremented by 1 and even decremented), meaning at minimum 1 number disrupts regularity, keeping the sums indivisible by ( n ). Further breaking it down dramatically:    - The sum of all natural numbers from ( n=a+1 ):        [        a+1 + a+2 + ldots + a+n = n a + frac{n(n+1)}{2}        ]        The divisibility depends on whether (n+1) is even, which was shown cannot work throughout. 4. **Conclusion:**    From the observations and verification, the sequence (2, 1, 4, 3, ldots, 100, 99) does indeed satisfy the condition that the sum of any ( n ) consecutive numbers does not divide ( n ) for any ( 2 leq n leq 100 ).

Since n starts from 0 (as ( 7 cdot 0 + 5 = 5 ) is the smallest number satisfying the condition and still within the positive range), the total number of valid n is ( 42 - 0 + 1 = 43 ). Thus, there are boxed{43} integers from 1 to 300 inclusive that are congruent to 5 (mod 7)."},{"instruction":"Consider the polynomial [P(x)=x^3+3x^2+6x+10.] Let its three roots be  a ,  b ,  c .

This is because if ( 2008 = mn ), then ( 0 = f(2008) = f(m) + f(n) ), and since ( f(m) ) and ( f(n) ) are non-negative, both must be zero. 3. **Divisors of 2008:**    - The prime factorization of 2008 is ( 2008 = 2^3 times 251 ).    - The divisors of 2008 are ( 1, 2, 4, 8, 251, 502, 1004, 2008 ).    - Therefore, ( f(d) = 0 ) for each divisor ( d ) of 2008. 4. **Analyzing Condition (3):**    - For ( n equiv 39 pmod{2008} ), we have ( n = 2008k + 39 ) for some integer ( k ).    - Given ( f(n) = 0 ) for all such ( n ), we need to show that this implies ( f ) is zero for all positive integers. 5. **Coprime Argument:**    - Suppose ( m ) is any positive integer coprime with 2008. Then there exists an integer ( a ) such that ( am equiv 1 pmod{2008} ) (by Bezout's identity).    - Consider ( n = 39a ). Then ( nm equiv 39 pmod{2008} ), so ( f(nm) = f(39a cdot m) = f(39) + f(a) + f(m) ).    - Since ( nm equiv 39 pmod{2008} ), we have ( f(nm) = 0 ). Thus, ( 0 = f(39) + f(a) + f(m) ).    - Given ( f(39) = 0 ) (from condition 3), we have ( 0 = f(a) + f(m) ). Since ( f(a) geq 0 ) and ( f(m) geq 0 ), it follows that ( f(a) = 0 ) and ( f(m) = 0 ). 6. **General Case:**    - If ( m ) is not coprime with 2008, let ( d = gcd(m, 2008) ). Then ( m = da ) where ( gcd(a, 2008) = 1 ).    - We have ( f(m) = f(da) = f(d) + f(a) ).    - Since ( d ) is a divisor of 2008, ( f(d) = 0 ). Also, since ( a ) is coprime with 2008, ( f(a) = 0 ).    - Therefore, ( f(m) = 0 + 0 = 0 ). 7. **Conclusion:**    - We have shown that ( f(n) = 0 ) for all positive integers ( n ).

The derivative of y = f(x) - g(x) = frac{1}{2}x^2 - aln x is y' = x - frac{a}{x}. The slope of the tangent line at x = 1 is k = 1 - a. According to the equation for the tangent line 6x - 2y - 5 = 0, we have the slope k = 6/2 = 3. Therefore, setting 3 = 1 - a gives us a = -2. Thus, we have:    [boxed{a = -2}] 2. For the function h(x) = f(x) + g(x) = frac{1}{2}x^2 + aln x, for the inequality frac{h(x_1) - h(x_2)}{x_1 - x_2} > 2 to hold for any two distinct positive numbers x_1 and x_2, the function m(x)=h(x) - 2x must be increasing on (0, +infty). This means its derivative m'(x) = h'(x) - 2 = x + frac{a}{x} - 2 must be non-negative for all x > 0. Therefore, a must be greater than or equal to the maximum value of x(2 - x), which is 1.

The inequality f'(x_0) + frac{1}{f'(x_0)} < g(x_0) - g'(x_0) is equivalent to x_0 + frac{1}{x_0} < a ln x_0 - frac{a}{x_0}, which simplifies to x_0 - aln x_0 + frac{1 + a}{x_0} < 0. Define the function m(x)=x-aln x+frac{1+a}{x}. We need to find when m(x_0) < 0 within the interval [1, e]. Taking the derivative m'(x) = 1 - frac{a}{x} - frac{1+a}{x^2} = frac{x^2 - ax - (1 + a)}{x^2} = frac{(x - a - 1)(x + 1)}{x^2}, we see that m(x) has a critical point at x = 1 + a. Now, we consider three cases:    i. If 1 + a leq 1, meaning a leq 0, then evaluate at m(1) = 2 + a < 0, which yields a < -2.        ii. If 1 < 1 + a leq e, meaning 0 < a leq e - 1, the minimum of m(x) occurs at 1 + a, setting m(1 + a) = 1 + a - aln(1+a) + 1 < 0.

If 1 + a > e, meaning a > e - 1, m(x) is decreasing in [1, e], and we only need m(e) < 0. This gives us a > frac{e^2 + 1}{e - 1}. Since e - 1 - frac{e^2 + 1}{e - 1} < 0, we have a > frac{e^2 + 1}{e - 1}.

Since he rests after every ( d ) miles, the number of rest periods will be ( frac{50}{d} - 1 ) (he doesn't rest after the last segment). The total time spent walking is the time it takes to walk 50 miles at 10 mph, which is ( 50 times 6 = 300 ) minutes. The total time spent resting is the number of rest periods times the duration of each rest period, which is ( (frac{50}{d} - 1) times 8 ) minutes.

Therefore,     [    leftlfloor (m-1) alpha_{1} rightrfloor = m-1 quad text{and} quad leftlfloor m alpha_{1} rightrfloor = m + 1.    ]    It follows that:    [    (m-1) delta < 1 quad text{and} quad m delta geq 1,    ]    meaning (m = leftlfloor alpha_{2} rightrfloor) since (alpha_{2} < alpha_{3} < ldots < alpha_{k}).

Consider (x), an arbitrary natural number not present in the sequence (leftlfloor alpha_{1} rightrfloor, leftlfloor 2 alpha_{1} rightrfloor, ldots). Then,     [    x = leftlfloor p alpha_{1} rightrfloor + 1.    ]    For the next term,    [    leftlfloor (p+1) alpha_{1} rightrfloor > leftlfloor p alpha_{1} rightrfloor + 1,    ]    which implies:    [    leftlfloor p + 1 + (p+1) delta rightrfloor > leftlfloor p + p delta rightrfloor + 1.    ]    Consequently,    [    leftlfloor (p+1) delta rightrfloor > leftlfloor p delta rightrfloor.    ] 7. Because both cases leave at least one gap between sequences of (alpha_1) and (alpha_2), we conclude that as the sequence progresses, each (x_k) can increment by (m) or (m+1), avoiding natural number overlap. 8.

For simplicity, let's assume we have 'white' and 'black' cells. **Step 2: Understanding Domino Pairing** - Each domino will cover one 'white' cell and one 'black' cell, and by the problem's condition, one of the cells will contain a number that is greater than the other cell. - Without loss of generality, consider each white cell to have the number (a) and its adjacent black cell to have the number (b) such that (a < b) or (a > b).  **Step 3: Minimizing the Sum within each Domino** - For the minimum sum, we set the smallest possible natural numbers for adjacent cells. - Assign numbers 1 and 2 to these adjacent cells.   - This means each domino formed by coloring scheme will have (1) and (2), giving each domino pair a sum of (1 + 2 = 3). **Step 4: Calculating Total Sum for the Grid** - The grid contains (100 times 100 = 10,000) cells. - Using dominoes, we have (frac{10,000}{2} = 5,000) domino pairs. - Since each domino pair contributes at least (3) to the sum, the minimum total sum is:   [   5,000 times 3 = 15,000   ] **Step 5: Feasibility and Construction** - To check if this sum is achievable, assign '1' to the cells of one color (say, white) and '2' to the cells of the other color (say, black) in a checkerboard pattern. - This assignment ensures every number (1) is less than all its neighbors (2) and vice versa, satisfying the given condition. **Conclusion:** Therefore, the minimum possible sum of all numbers in the (100 times 100) grid is: [ boxed{15000} ]"},{"instruction":"Mr. Sean has a veterinary clinic where he charges clients 60 to treat a dog, 40 to care for a cat, 70 to examine a parrot, and 50 to treat a rabbit.

This means that due to stoppages, the train's effective speed is reduced by 20 kmph. To find out how many minutes the train stops per hour, we need to calculate the time lost due to stoppages. First, let's find out the distance the train would cover in one hour without any stoppages: Distance without stoppages = Speed * Time = 60 kmph * 1 hour = 60 km Now, let's find out the distance the train actually covers in one hour with stoppages: Distance with stoppages = Speed * Time = 40 kmph * 1 hour = 40 km The difference in distance is the distance lost due to stoppages: Distance lost due to stoppages = Distance without stoppages - Distance with stoppages Distance lost due to stoppages = 60 km - 40 km = 20 km Now, we need to find out how much time it would take the train to cover this 20 km distance at its original speed (without stoppages): Time to cover 20 km = Distance / Speed = 20 km / 60 kmph To convert the speed to km per minute, we divide by 60 (since there are 60 minutes in an hour): Speed in km per minute = 60 kmph / 60 = 1 km/min Now, we can calculate the time to cover 20 km at the speed of 1 km/min: Time to cover 20 km = 20 km / 1 km/min = 20 minutes Therefore, the train stops for boxed{20}  minutes per hour due to stoppages."},{"instruction":"My threedigit code is 145.

Find the largest r such that for each pair of photos there is at least one person appearing in both.","output":"1. **Finding the upper bound:**    To find the upper bound of the number of photos (r), we need to consider the worst-case scenario, where no two photos have any person in common.        Suppose we have a set of n friends and consider all the possible subsets of friends (which represents all possible photos). Each friend's inclusion or exclusion can be represented by a binary choice, so there are (2^n) possible subsets (photos).    However, if every subset (photo) had to share at least one person with every other subset, then we cannot consider both a subset and its complement (i.e., it is not possible for a photo and its complement to both be part of our set of r photos).    Therefore, among the (2^n) possible subsets, we can include at most half of these to ensure that no two photos are complements of each other. This gives:    [    r leq frac{2^n}{2} = 2^{n-1}    ] 2. **Constructing a configuration with 2^{n-1} photos:**    To construct a configuration where we have exactly (2^{n-1}) photos and each pair of photos shares at least one person in common, we can use the following approach:    - Choose one specific person (say person A) who will be included in all photos. This ensures that every photo will have at least one person in common (person A).        - Now, with person A included in every photo, we consider the remaining (n-1) friends. Each subset of these (n-1) friends represents a different photo.    Since there are (n-1) friends and each subset corresponds to a distinct photo, there are (2^{n-1}) possible photos where each subset includes person A. This exactly matches the upper bound we derived.        Hence, having person A in all photos enables us to use (2^{n-1}) different non-empty subsets of the remaining (n-1) friends for a total of (2^{n-1}) photos. **Conclusion:**     [ boxed{2^{n-1}} ]"},{"instruction":"Find the maximum value of the expression: [ sin theta_1 cos theta_2 + sin theta_2 cos theta_3 + sin theta_3 cos theta_4 + sin theta_4 cos theta_5 + sin theta_5 cos theta_1, ] over all real numbers theta_1, theta_2, theta_3, theta_4, theta_5.","output":"We use the sine addition formula which states that sin(a + b) = sin a cos b + cos a sin b.

This leads to two potential cases:  Case a: [ 10x + y = (x + y)(x - y) = x^2 - y^2 ] Rewriting this, we get: [ 10x + y = x^2 - y^2 ] Rearranging terms: [ x^2 - 10x = y^2 + y ] We can observe whether this case results in feasible values by factoring parts.

Thus, this leads us to conclude that such an equality holds only under specific digit values, otherwise y > x and solutions fall outside the defined range.

This implies that the three smaller triangles must be congruent to each other. 2. **Analyze the congruence of the smaller triangles:**    - For the three smaller triangles to be congruent, they must have the same angles and side lengths. This means that the original triangle must be divided in such a way that the resulting triangles are identical in shape and size. 3. **Examine the possible configurations:**    - There are limited ways to dissect a triangle into three congruent triangles. One common way is to draw lines from each vertex of the original triangle to a point inside the triangle, forming three smaller triangles. This point is often the centroid or another significant point of the triangle. 4. **Consider the case of an equilateral triangle:**    - If the original triangle is equilateral, then each angle is 60^circ.

The same reasoning applies to the color and pattern attributes. 3. **Unique card determination:**    From the given conditions, for any pair of selected cards, there is exactly one unique third card that would make the trio a complementary combination. This is due to the fact that given two attributes, the third can either be the same as both or different from both. 4. **Counting complementary combinations:**    We established that for each unique pair of cards, there is one unique third card that would complete the complementary combination.

(Note: the second part, which involves the polynomial ( P(x) ), appears to be part of a different context or problem and is excluded based on the given instructions.)","output":"Given:  Point ( Y ) is the intersection of circle ( w_1 ) and median ( BM ). The tangent to ( w_1 ) at point ( Y ) intersects the line segment ( AC ) at the midpoint of the segment ( KL ). To prove:  We need to show that the tangent to circle ( w_1 ) at point ( Y ) intersects line ( AC ) at the midpoint of the segment ( KL ). 1. **Identify Key Points and Circles:**    Let's introduce the points and circles more formally:    - ( w_1 ): A circle with some center ( O ).    - ( w_2 ): The second circle with center ( U ).    - ( Y ): The intersection of circle ( w_1 ) with the median ( BM ).    - ( K ) and ( L ): Points on line ( AC ). 2. **Positioning the Center ( U ):**    Observing the circles, the center ( U ) of the second circle ( w_2 ) lies at the midpoint of the segment ( KL ). 3. **Symmetry of the Problem:**    Given that point ( Y ) lies on the second circle ( w_2 ), we need to show that segment ( UK ) is tangent to the first circle ( w_1 ) at point ( Y ), making circles ( w_1 ) and ( w_2 ) orthogonal. 4. **Orthogonality Conditions for Circles:**    Two circles are orthogonal if the radius of one at the point of tangency is perpendicular to the radius of the other. Specifically,     - ( w_1 perp w_2 ) implies that the radius from the center ( O ) of ( w_1 ) to the tangency point ( Y ) is perpendicular to the radius from ( U ) (center of ( w_2 )) to ( Y ). 5. **Inversion Property:**    To show orthogonality through inversion, we utilize the following property:        - A circle remains invariant (unchanged) in position under an inversion with respect to another circle if the two circles are orthogonal. 6. **Geometric Analysis of Points L and L’:**    Consider point ( L ) on ( AC ) and its inverse point ( L' ) with respect to circle ( w_1 ). The angles are preserved under inversion, thus     [    angle AL'L = angle OAL    ]    Similarly,     [    angle OCL = angle OL'C    ]    Therefore, ( L'L ) bisects ( A L'C ), making:    [    frac{AL'}{L'C} = frac{AL}{LC}    ]    This implies ( L' ) lies on the Apollonian circle defined by points ( A, C ) and the segment ( KL ). # Conclusion: By proving the segment ( UK ) is tangent to circle ( w_1 ) at ( Y ) and that ( L' ) lies on an Apollonian circle, we have shown the desired symmetry and tangency properties. Hence, the orthogonality condition ( w_1 perp w_2 ) is satisfied.

Squaring both sides of the inequality to remove the square root leads to:    [    n < (1 + varepsilon)^2    ]     5. We need to determine for what n the inequality sqrt{n} - 1 geq varepsilon holds:    [    sqrt{n} - 1 geq varepsilon     ]    This implies:    [    sqrt{n} geq 1 + varepsilon    ]    And, squaring both sides, we get:    [    n geq (1 + varepsilon)^2    ] 6. Further, expanding the binomial expression on the right:    [    (1 + varepsilon)^2 = 1 + 2varepsilon + varepsilon^2    ] 7. Thus, the inequality we derived is:    [    n geq 1 + 2varepsilon + varepsilon^2    ] 8. Therefore, for n larger than 1 + 2varepsilon + varepsilon^2, the inequality sqrt{n} - 1 geq varepsilon will not hold; that is, for n in this range, the inequality sqrt{n} - 1 < varepsilon holds true, thus proving our statement. 9. To link this with our conclusion, if we let k = 1 + 2varepsilon + varepsilon^2, then for all n > k, we have:    [    sqrt{n} - 1 < varepsilon    ] # Conclusion: [ boxed{k = 1 + 2varepsilon + varepsilon^2} ]"},{"instruction":"Garbage classification refers to a series of activities in which garbage is classified, stored, disposed of, and transported according to certain regulations or standards, so as to transform it into a public resource. It is the duty of every citizen to do a good job in garbage classification. It is known that the decomposition rate v of a certain type of garbage approximately satisfies the relationship v=acdot b^{t} (where a and b are positive constants) with time t (in months). After 6 months, the decomposition rate of this type of garbage is 5%, and after 12 months, the decomposition rate is 10%. Approximately how many months does it take for this type of garbage to completely decompose? A: 20 B: 28 C: 32 D: 40","output":"To solve this problem, we start by setting up the equations based on the information given. We know that the decomposition rate v of a certain type of garbage can be described by the equation v=acdot b^{t}, where a and b are constants, and t is the time in months. We are given two points on this curve: after 6 months, the decomposition rate is 5% or 0.05, and after 12 months, the decomposition rate is 10% or 0.1. This gives us two equations: 1. 0.05 = acdot b^{6} 2. 0.1 = acdot b^{12} From these equations, we can solve for a and b. Dividing the second equation by the first gives us: frac{0.1}{0.05} = frac{acdot b^{12}}{acdot b^{6}} Simplifying this, we get: 2 = b^{6} Taking the sixth root of both sides, we find: b = 2^{frac{1}{6}} Substituting b back into the first equation to solve for a, we get: 0.05 = acdot (2^{frac{1}{6}})^{6} Simplifying this, we find: 0.05 = acdot 2 So, solving for a, we get: a = frac{0.05}{2} = 0.025 Now, we have both a and b, and we can write the decomposition rate equation as: v = 0.025cdot 2^{frac{t}{6}} To find when the garbage completely decomposes, we set v = 1 (or 100%) and solve for t: 1 = 0.025cdot 2^{frac{t}{6}} Solving for 2^{frac{t}{6}}, we get: 2^{frac{t}{6}} = frac{1}{0.025} = 40 Taking the common logarithm of both sides gives us: frac{t}{6}log{2} = log{40} Since log{40} = 1 + 2log{2}, we can substitute this back into our equation: frac{t}{6}log{2} = 1 + 2log{2} Solving for t, we get: t = 6left(frac{1 + 2log{2}}{log{2}}right) Simplifying this expression, we find that t approx 32 months.

After giving Neil 6 games, Henry has 4 times more games than Neil. After receiving 6 games, Neil has N + 6 games. So, Henry has 4 times that amount, which is 4(N + 6). But we also know that after giving away 6 games, Henry has H - 6 games left. Therefore, we can set up the equation: H - 6 = 4(N + 6) Now we can substitute N with 7: H - 6 = 4(7 + 6) H - 6 = 4(13) H - 6 = 52 H = 52 + 6 H = 58 Henry originally had boxed{58}  games."},{"instruction":"Let g be a function satisfying g(xy) = g(x)y for all positive real numbers x and y.

After visiting a supermarket and a showroom, she had 26 dollars left. Olivia spent 49 dollars at the showroom, but she also received a 10% discount on her purchase. Additionally, she bought items at the supermarket that had a 7% sales tax applied. How much did she spend at the supermarket before the sales tax was added?","output":"Let's start by calculating how much Olivia spent in total after visiting both the supermarket and the showroom. She had 106 initially and was left with 26, so the total amount spent is: 106 - 26 = 80 Now, we know that Olivia spent 49 at the showroom, but she also received a 10% discount on her purchase. Let's find out the original price of the items before the discount was applied. Let the original price be ( P ). The discount amount is 10% of ( P ), which is ( 0.10P ). After the discount, Olivia paid 49, so we can write the equation: ( P - 0.10P = 49 ) Combining like terms, we get: ( 0.90P = 49 ) Now, we solve for ( P ): ( P = 49 / 0.90 ) ( P = 54.44 ) (rounded to two decimal places) This means the original price of the items at the showroom before the discount was 54.44. Now, let's find out how much Olivia spent at the supermarket. We know the total amount spent was 80, and we've just calculated that the amount spent at the showroom before the discount was 54.44. So, the amount spent at the supermarket including the sales tax is: 80 - 54.44 = 25.56 Let's call the amount Olivia spent at the supermarket before the sales tax ( S ). The sales tax is 7%, so the total amount spent at the supermarket including the sales tax is ( S + 0.07S ). We can write the equation: ( S + 0.07S = 25.56 ) Combining like terms, we get: ( 1.07S = 25.56 ) Now, we solve for ( S ): ( S = 25.56 / 1.07 ) ( S = 23.89 ) (rounded to two decimal places) So, Olivia spent boxed{23.89}  at the supermarket before the sales tax was added."},{"instruction":"w many integers fall between sqrt{10} and sqrt{90} on a number line?","output":"To solve the new problem, we first need to find the approximate positions of sqrt{10} and sqrt{90} on the number line. 1.

Next, we calculate the values of a, b, and c using the simplified function: - a = f(2^{0.3}) = (2^{0.3})^3 = 2^{0.9}, which is greater than 1. - b = f(0.3^2) = (0.3^2)^3 = 0.3^6, which lies in the interval (0,1). - c = f(log_{2}{0.3}) = (log_{2}{0.3})^3, which is less than 0 since log_{2}{0.3} is negative and raising a negative number to an odd power yields a negative result. Comparing these values, we find that a > 1 > b > 0 > c, which means a > b > c. Therefore, the correct relationship between a, b, and c is given by option D: c < b < a.

The number of triangles formed by ( n_i ) points in the ( i )-th group is given by the binomial coefficient ( binom{n_i}{3} ). 2. **Express the total number of triangles:**    The total number of triangles formed by all groups is:    [    sum_{i=1}^{10} binom{n_i}{3}    ]    where ( n_i ) is the number of points in the ( i )-th group. 3. **Simplify the binomial coefficient:**    Recall that:    [    binom{n_i}{3} = frac{n_i (n_i - 1) (n_i - 2)}{6}    ] 4. **Use the constraint that the total number of points is 100:**    [    sum_{i=1}^{10} n_i = 100    ] 5. **Apply the inequality for minimizing the sum of binomial coefficients:**    Using the convexity of the function ( binom{n_i}{3} ), the sum ( sum_{i=1}^{10} binom{n_i}{3} ) is minimized when the ( n_i ) values are as equal as possible.

It is known that ( R(3,3,3) = 17 ). 3. **Apply the Ramsey number to our problem:**    Since each group has 10 points and ( 10 < 17 ), it is possible to color the edges of each group with 3 colors such that no triangle is monochromatic. 4. **Conclude the proof:**    Therefore, there exists an arrangement where each segment can be colored with one of three given colors, and no triangle has all edges of the same color.

Consider adding (2y) times the second equation to (-3z) times the third equation to simplify and solve, we get: [ 6(x^2 y^2 + y^2 z^2 + z^2 x^2) - 49xyz + 2y(6 y (x^2 - z^2) + 5 x z) - 3z (2 z (x^2 - y^2) - 9 x y) = 0 ]    Simplifying, we use: [ 6(x^2 y^2 + y^2 z^2 + z^2 x^2) - 49xyz + 12 y^2 (x^2 - z^2) + 10 y x z - 6 z^2 (x^2 - y^2) + 27 x y z = 0 ] 4. **Factor or rearrange the simplified equation:** [ 6 x^2 y^2 + 6 y^2 z^2 + 6 z^2 x^2 - 49 x y z + 12 y^2 x^2 - 12 y^2 z^2 + 10 x y z - 6 z^2 x^2 + 6 z^2 y^2 + 27 x y z = 0 ] Combining similar terms we get: [ 12 x^2 y^2 - 12 z^2 x^2 + 12 y^2 z^2 - 12 x y z = 0 ] Simplify by dividing both sides by (6): [ 2 x^2 y^2 - 2 z^2 x^2 + 2 y^2 z^2 - 2 x y z = 0 implies x(xy + yz - z^2) - yz(x + z) = 0 ] Combining these we obtain: [ 3xy = 2z quad text{ or } quad z = frac{3xy}{2} ] 5. **Obtaining (z) value:**    Once we obtained (z = frac{3xy}{2}), substitute it back into the second equation to solve for (y) and the third to solve for (x):    Substitute ( z = frac{3xy}{2} )  into ( 6 y (x^2 - (frac{3xy}{2})^2) + 5 x (frac{3xy}{2}) = 0 ): [ 6 y(x^2 - frac{9x^2 y^2}{4}) + frac{15x^2 y}{2} = 0 ] Solve inside the parenthesis: [  6 y(x^2(1 - frac{9y^2}{4})) + frac{15x^2 y}{2} = 0   ] Dividing by ( x^2 y ): [ 6 (1 - frac{9y^2}{4}) + frac{15}{2} = 0  ] Multiplying by (4): [ 24 - 27 y^2 + 30 = 0 rightarrow 54 = 27 y^2 rightarrow y^2 = 2 ] Solving for (y): [ y = pm 1 ] 6. **Back Substitute to find x:** Substitute the value (z = frac{3 x y}{2}) and back and we will get: [ x^2 rightarrow 4 rightarrow x = pm 2; ] Similarly for (z): quad z = pm 3; Conclusion, the full set of non-zero solutions is: [ (x, y, z) = ( pm 2, pm 1, pm 3) ] Hence the solution set is: [  boxed{{(0,0,0), (2,1,3), (2,-1,-3), (-2,1,-3), (-2,-1,3)}} ]"},{"instruction":"f the permutation a_1, a_2, a_3, a_4, a_5 of 1, 2, 3, 4, 5 has the property that for 1 leq i leq 4, a_1, a_2, ldots, a_i does not form a permutation of 1, 2, ldots, i, then the number of such permutations is.","output":"1.

The definition provided is that a subset T of positive rational numbers is complete if, for any frac{p}{q} in T, it follows that both frac{p}{p+q} and frac{q}{p+q} also belong to T.  Step-by-Step Solution: 1. **Defining the Set H**:    Let's consider the set H of positive rational numbers that includes every positive rational number except 1 and frac{1}{2}:    [    H = mathbb{Q}^+ setminus left{1, frac{1}{2}right}    ] 2. **Checking Completeness of H**:    We need to verify that H is a complete subset. According to the problem's definition of completeness, for any frac{p}{q} in H:    - frac{p}{p+q} and frac{q}{p+q} should also belong to H.        Both frac{p}{p+q} and frac{q}{p+q} are positive rational numbers because p, q > 0. Furthermore:    - Neither frac{p}{p+q} nor frac{q}{p+q} can be 1 because p neq q.     - Also, neither frac{p}{p+q} nor frac{q}{p+q} can be frac{1}{2} under the same condition.    Therefore, H is indeed a complete subset by this definition. 3. **Identifying Specific Rational Numbers r**:    We need to find rational numbers r such that if r in T (a complete subset), then T must contain every rational number between 0 and 1.        The only elements excluded from H are 1 and frac{1}{2}. So, rational numbers r that might satisfy our condition are likely 1 and frac{1}{2}. Let's test these: 4. **Checking if r=1 and r=frac{1}{2} Satisfy the Condition**:    - Suppose 1 in T and T is complete. From the definition:      [      frac{1}{1+1} = frac{1}{2} in T      ]      This property is satisfied by the completeness of T.    - Now, suppose frac{1}{2} in T and T is complete. We use mathematical induction to show that T indeed contains every rational number between 0 and 1. 5. **Induction Basis for Completeness with r = frac{1}{2}**:    - Base Case: For n=2, frac{1}{2} in T by assumption.    - Inductive Step: Assume that for some n, all rational numbers of the form frac{k}{n}, where 1 leq k < n, are in T. We need to prove it for n+1.      Given frac{p}{n+1} in T for some p, we have:      [      frac{p}{p + (n+1)} = frac{p}{n+1} quad text{and} quad frac{n+1}{p + (n+1)}      ]      The completeness condition ensures frac{k}{n+1} belongs to T because their denominators p + (n+1) are greater than any individual denominator within n+1.      If both sides of reciprocal components of p ensure that every possibility is met, we find every rational value can be derived from prior values in the subset. Thus, through induction, any full subset from lbrace frac{q}{p}, frac{p}{p+q} rbrace includes all rational values between 0 and 1, confirming frac{1}{2} meets conditions similarly to 1 from completeness.

So, A = P + CI = 4000 + 1554.5 = 5554.5. Now we can plug the values into the formula and solve for r: 5554.5 = 4000(1 + r/1)^(1*2.3333) Divide both sides by 4000: 5554.5 / 4000 = (1 + r)^(2.3333) 1.388625 = (1 + r)^(2.3333) Now we take the (1/2.3333)th root of both sides to solve for (1 + r): (1.388625)^(1/2.3333) = 1 + r Now we calculate the root: 1 + r = (1.388625)^(1/2.3333) Using a calculator: 1 + r ≈ 1.15 Now we subtract 1 from both sides to solve for r: r ≈ 1.15 - 1 r ≈ 0.15 To express r as a percentage, we multiply by 100: r ≈ 0.15 * 100 r ≈ 15% Therefore, the annual interest rate is approximately boxed{15%} ."},{"instruction":"Given a sequence {a_n} with its first n terms sum S_n, where a_1=8 and a_n=3S_{n1}+8 for ngeqslant 2.

Since the mosaic is 10 feet tall and 15 feet long, the total area is: Area = Height x Length Area = 10 feet x 15 feet Area = 150 square feet Next, we need to find the area that each tile will cover. Since Mary needs 21600 tiles to cover the entire mosaic, we divide the total area by the number of tiles: Area per tile = Total area / Number of tiles Area per tile = 150 square feet / 21600 tiles Area per tile = 0.00694444444 square feet (rounded to the nearest billionth) Now, we need to convert the area per tile from square feet to square inches because we want to find the side length in inches.

The area of an equilateral triangle with side length a is given by the formula:     [    S = frac{sqrt{3}}{4} a^2    ]    Substituting a = 3,    [    S = frac{sqrt{3}}{4} times 9 = frac{9sqrt{3}}{4}    ] 3. If one of the tetrahedron's faces lies in the plane of projection, the area of the projection Pi will be equal to the area of that face:    [    Pi = S    ] 4. Consider the rotation of the tetrahedron around the common edge of these faces. For a rotation angle of 0<varphi<60^{circ}, the area of the projection is given by:     [    Pi = S cos varphi    ]    where cos varphi < 1 for 0<varphi<60^{circ} so:    [    Pi < S    ] 5. For a rotation angle of 60^{circ}<varphi<90^{circ}, the projections of both triangles contribute to Pi. The area of the projection is given by:    [    Pi = S cos varphi + S cos psi    ]    where psi = pi - pi/6 - varphi because the dihedral angle is 30^circ = pi/6:    [    psi = frac{5pi}{6} - varphi    ]    Thus,    [    Pi = S cos varphi + S cos left( frac{5pi}{6} - varphi right)    ] 6.

Since she needs 6 sessions, that's 3 sets of 2 sessions, which means she will take 2 breaks of 30 minutes each. Total time spent reading without breaks: 6 sessions * 50 minutes/session = 300 minutes Total time spent distracted: 6 sessions * 10 minutes/session = 60 minutes Total break time: 2 breaks * 30 minutes/break = 60 minutes Total time spent on the book: 300 minutes (reading) + 60 minutes (distracted) + 60 minutes (breaks) = 420 minutes Finally, let's convert the total time from minutes to hours: 420 minutes / 60 minutes/hour = 7 hours Jo will be reading the book for a total of boxed{7}  hours before she finishes it, considering her distractions and breaks."},{"instruction":"A train of a certain length is travelling at 45 km/h and can cross a bridge in 30 seconds.

We need to prove that one can either:    - Delete 990 rows such that each column contains at least one remaining 1.    - Delete 990 columns such that each remaining row contains at least one 0.    Let's define a \\"bad\\" row as one that intersects all selected columns with only 1's, and a \\"bad\\" column as one that intersects all selected rows with only 0's. 2. **Comparative Analysis of Initial Conditions**:    The table has a total of at least 500,000 cells. Without loss of generality, assume there are at least as many 1's as 0's. This assumption simplifies our subsequent considerations. 3. **Selection Process**:    Select a row where the number of 1's is at least half of the row length.

In this case, add any random rows until the total selected rows reach 10. Delete the remaining 990 rows.    - **Scenario 2**: Exactly 10 rows are selected. Given our principle of halving the bad columns (i.e., ( text{bad columns} leq 1000 / 2^{10} )), indicating zero bad columns remain. Delete all except the 10 selected rows.     - **Scenario 3**: Fewer than 10 rows selected, but every remaining row intersects the bad columns with more 0's than 1's. Hence, the bad columns contain more 0's upon intersection while continuing the iterative step for selecting columns. 6. **Iterative Columns Procedure**:    a.

This is because in the circle EGH, the angle subtended by chord EH at G equals the angle between the tangent at E and EH.  Step 2: Establishing Triangle Similarity We begin by noting that:  angle BAD = 180^circ - angle DCB = angle FCD  Since triangles FAB and FCD share a common angle at F and have this pair of equal angles, they are similar.   Step 3: Introducing the Transformation mathcal{T} We define a transformation mathcal{T} as follows: 1. Reflect at the bisector of angle DFC. 2. Followed by dilation centered at F with a factor frac{PA}{PC}. This transformation mathcal{T} maps: - F rightarrow F - C rightarrow A - D rightarrow B - H rightarrow G  Step 4: Mapping Points Under mathcal{T} Given the similarity triangle FCA sim triangle FDB, we have:  frac{FA}{PC} = frac{FB}{PD}  Under mathcal{T}, E maps to the point X, the fourth vertex of the parallelogram BEAX. Consequently, we have:  angle HEF = angle FXG  Since G is the midpoint of AB, it’s also the midpoint of the diagonal EX of parallelogram BEAX. Thus, points E, G, X are collinear with EX = 2 cdot EG.  Step 5: Symmetry and Parallelism in Parallelograms Denote Y as the fourth vertex of parallelogram DECY. Analogous arguments show that E, H, Y are collinear with EY = 2 cdot EH. By the Intercept Theorem:  HG parallel XY   Step 6: Symmetry of the Lines The transformation mathcal{T} ensures: - FX and FE are symmetric with respect to the angle bisector of angle DFC. - FY and FE are symmetric similarly. Thus, points F, X, Y are collinear, and so the symmetric properties lead to:  angle FXE = angle HGE   Conclusion Therefore, EF is tangent to the circle passing through points E, G, and H, as required. boxed{}"},{"instruction":"A triangular region is enclosed by the lines with equations y = x + 3, y = 3x + 9, and y = 2.

The truck travels at 12 ft/s and stops for 20 seconds at each pail. Initially, when Michael is at a pail, the truck is 150 feet away, heading towards him from the opposite direction. 2. **Positions and Movements**: Let M(t) be Michael's position at time t, and T(t) be the truck's position at time t. Set M(0) = 0 and T(0) = -150. 3. **Movement Analysis**:    - The truck travels the distance between pails in frac{150 text{ ft}}{12 text{ ft/s}} = 12.5 seconds.    - The truck stops for 20 seconds at each pail.    - Each complete cycle for the truck (travel plus stop) takes 12.5 + 20 = 32.5 seconds.    - In 32.5 seconds, Michael jogs 32.5 times 6 text{ ft/s} = 195 feet. 4. **Meeting Points**:    - Initial distance between them is 150 feet.    - After one cycle (32.5 seconds), Michael will be at 195 feet, and the truck, coming from the opposite direction, will be at 150 - 195 + 150 = 105 feet (after completing one stop and continuing to the next pail).    - The first meeting happens when Michael's travel equals the truck's net travel. Setting their positions equal gives: 6t = 12t - 195 (since truck moves faster but initially was 150 feet behind from the opposite direction). Solving gives t = 32.5 seconds, hence they meet when Michael is at 195 feet, which corresponds to passing the second pail at 300 feet. 5. **Conclusion**:    - They meet every 300 feet (since Michael travels 195 feet in one cycle, and during two cycles, he travels 390 feet, where the truck has traveled 390 feet but in the opposite direction). Since the path is long and straight, we consider how often this occurs every 300 feet. If Michael continues, they will keep meeting at multiples of 300 feet.

Let A', B', M', N', P', Q', E', F' denote the images of points A, B, M, N, P, Q, E, F under this transformation. 3. **Transformation Properties**:    Under the projective transformation:    - The image of point O (the center of circle S) becomes the center of new circles O'.    - Chords A'B', M'N', and P'Q' become diameters of the new circle since O' is their midpoint. 4. **Central Symmetry**:        Because A'B', M'N', and P'Q' are diameters, they undergo central symmetry about O'.

Being an even function means that f(-x) = f(x) for all x in mathbb{R}. 2. Having a period of pi means that f(x + kpi) = f(x) for any integer k. Using these properties, we can evaluate fleft(frac{5pi}{3}right) in the following way: First, notice that frac{5pi}{3} falls outside the given interval [0, frac{pi}{2}]. Since f(x) has a period of pi,  fleft(frac{5pi}{3}right) = fleft(frac{5pi}{3} - 2piright) = fleft(-frac{pi}{3}right).

Each vertex represents a seat at the table. 2. **Define the distance:**    - The distance between two vertices is defined as the length of the shortest path traveling through the edges of the polygon. Since the polygon is regular, the distance between two vertices (i) and (j) is (min(|i - j|, 60 - |i - j|)). 3. **Assume all distances are different:**    - Suppose that the distances between each man and his wife are all different. Then, these distances must be the set ({1, 2, ldots, 30}) because there are 30 men and 30 wives. 4. **Parity of distances:**    - If the distance between a man and his wife is odd, then one of them sits on an odd-numbered vertex and the other on an even-numbered vertex.    - If the distance is even, then both sit on vertices of the same parity (both odd or both even). 5. **Count the parity pairs:**    - There are 30 distances, and if they are all different, they must include 15 odd distances and 15 even distances.    - This means there are 15 pairs where the vertices have different parities (one odd, one even) and 15 pairs where the vertices have the same parity (both odd or both even). 6. **Contradiction:**    - However, in a regular polygon with 60 vertices, there are 30 odd-numbered vertices and 30 even-numbered vertices.    - If we have 15 pairs with different parities and 15 pairs with the same parity, this would imply that the number of odd and even vertices are not balanced, which is a contradiction because we have exactly 30 odd and 30 even vertices. 7. **Conclusion:**    - Therefore, the assumption that all distances are different must be false.

This results in an odd product. 5. **Identifying when the number of divisors is odd:**    The divisor counting function shows n^2 has an odd number of divisors if and only if n itself is a perfect square (because in that case, n^2 has an odd number of divisor pairs). 6. **Conclusion:**    Therefore, for the equation         frac{1}{x} + frac{1}{y} = frac{1}{n}        to have an odd number of solutions (x, y), the integer n must be a perfect square.  boxed{n text{ is a perfect square}}"},{"instruction":"f the price of a TV is first decreased by 20% and then increased by 55%, what is the net change in the price?","output":"Let's assume the original price of the TV is P.

Let's denote this radius as (a) (specifically chosen value of (a) will be defined later). Each circle will have a diameter of (2a). 3. **Handling Overlapping Circles**:    If any of these initial circles overlap, use the lemma to replace any two overlapping circles with a single circle that covers both. According to the lemma, the diameter of the new circle that covers both will be at most (d_1 + d_2). Repeat this process iteratively until no overlapping circles are left.        Let us describe this process in steps:        - Find two overlapping circles among the constructed circles around the points.    - Replace them with a single circle covering both.    - Each new circle has a diameter at most (2a + 2a = 4a).    - Continue this process until we have a system where no circles overlap. 4. **New System of Non-overlapping Circles**:        Eventually, we obtain a system of (k) circles, none of which intersects with any other. Ensure our system covers all points initially given. Additionally, the sum of their diameters should be calculated properly.

Since (2^{2^n} notequiv 1 pmod{p}), it directly follows that the exact order of 2 modulo (p) ((operatorname{ord}_{p}(2))) is (2^{n+1}). Thus: [ operatorname{ord}_{p}(2) = 2^{n+1} ] 5. Now, by Fermat's Little Theorem, (operatorname{ord}_{p}(2)) must divide (p-1): [ 2^{n+1} mid p - 1 ] 6. Consequently, ( p equiv 1 pmod{2^{n+1}} ). 7. This implies ( p equiv 1 pmod{8} ), since (n geq 2). 8. By the Quadratic Reciprocity Law, since ( p = 8k+1 ) for some integer ( k ), we conclude: [ left( frac{2}{p} right) = (-1)^{frac{(p^2 - 1)}{8}} = (-1)^k = 1 ] Therefore, (2) is a quadratic residue modulo ( p ).  Part (b): To show that (p equiv 1 pmod{2^{n+2}}): 1. Suppose (a) is an integer such that: [ a^2 equiv 2 pmod{p} ] 2. This implies the order of (a) modulo (p) (denoted ( operatorname{ord}_{p}(a) )) must be an even multiple of ( operatorname{ord}_{p}(2) ). 3. From part (a), we already have: [ operatorname{ord}_{p}(2) = 2^{n+1} ] 4. Hence, the order of (a) is: [ operatorname{ord}_{p}(a) = 2^{n+2} ] 5. By Fermat's Little Theorem again, (operatorname{ord}_{p}(a)) must divide (p-1), implying that: [ 2^{n+2} mid p - 1 ] [ p equiv 1 pmod{2^{n+2}} ]  Conclusion: Thus, we have shown both parts: 1. (2) is a quadratic residue modulo (p). 2. (p equiv 1 pmod{2^{n+2}}).

So, the total distance (D_tunnel) is: D_tunnel = Length of train + Length of tunnel D_tunnel = 330 m + 1200 m D_tunnel = 1530 m The time (T_tunnel) it takes to cross the tunnel is 45 sec. We can now calculate the speed (S) of the train using the formula: Speed = Distance / Time S = D_tunnel / T_tunnel S = 1530 m / 45 sec S = 34 m/sec Now that we have the speed of the train, we can calculate the time it takes to cross the platform.

Suppose, for the sake of contradiction, that there exists a rational number ( a = frac{d}{c} ) (where ( c ) and ( d ) are relatively prime integers) such that ( Pleft(left(frac{d}{c}right)^2right) = 1 ). 3. Since ( P(x) ) has integer coefficients and ( P(n^2) = 0 ), we can write ( P(x) = (x - n^2)Q(x) ) for some polynomial ( Q(x) ) with integer coefficients. 4.

Consider a convex polygon with a perimeter ( P ). 2. Arrange the sides of the polygon in descending order of their lengths on a line segment of length ( P ). 3. Let's place the longest side on one end and the next longest side on the other end of this segment. All other sides are placed between these two sides, ordered by decreasing length. 4. Note that since the polygon is convex, any single side of the polygon is less than half the perimeter, i.e., (P/2). This implies the midpoint ( O ) of the segment cannot lie on either of the two longest sides. 5. Now, consider the total length of all sides from the start up to the midpoint (O). Suppose (d_1, d_2, ldots, d_k) are the lengths of the sides from the start to a point just before (O) is reached. 6. By the definition of the midpoint, the sum of these lengths sums up to less than (P/2), leaving some side (d_{k+1}) possibly bisected by (O). Let’s denote this side’s length as (d_{mid}). 7. Depending on how the sides are arranged, (d_{mid}leqfrac{P}{2}), ensuring some side splits into two segments by the midpoint. The lengths of these new segments differ by no more than (d_{mid}). 8.

Each secant thus divides each of the semicircles (made by 2 radii) into two regions, but they also add intersections.     - Each additional pair of radii (as n increases by 1), adds two sectors, and the two intersecting secant lines can be positioned to slice through multiple new sections created by these radii. 2. **Estimating Increased Areas**:     - The secant lines, especially due to their intersecting nature, will dramatically increase the number of sections. Each sector created by the radii can potentially add new areas where the secants cross it and each other. 3. **Pattern Development and Formula Proposition**:     - Observing from smaller values of n, and considering the two secants are crossing each minimally once but generally more, the pattern in area increase would roughly align with an addition of a multiple of sectors and intersections more than what one secant achieves.     - A plausible estimate would be the areas increasing not just linearly with n but in a reinforced manner due to multiple intersections. A proposed formula might be 3n + 4 (to adjust for the additional cuts by another secant and their crossings). 4. **Verification with small values**:    - n=0, yields 4 areas (basic crossing).    - n=1, the radii divide the disk into 2 semi-circles; each secant arranged to optimally cross through sectors can divide these into further regions, considering an efficient crossing we can estimate up to 8 areas.    - Incrementally, each increase of n adds multiple new potential intersections because each new set of radii forms new sectors for the chords to cross. 5. **Conclusion**:    - The formula 3n + 4 aims to capture this additional complexity and the insights from our incremental area estimates. So, the new formula ensuring the maximum number of non-overlapping areas into which the disk can be divided by 2n equally spaced radii and two intersecting secant lines is 3n + 4.

This can be written as:    [    (p-1)! + 1 equiv 0 pmod{p}    ]    which implies:    [    (p-1)! + 1 = p^k    ]    for some integer ( k ). 2. **Rewriting the equation**: Given the equation ((n-1)! + 1 = n^k), we assume ( n ) is a prime number ( p ). Thus, we have:    [    (p-1)! + 1 = p^k    ] 3. **Simplify the equation**: Rearrange the equation to isolate the factorial term:    [    (p-1)! = p^k - 1    ] 4. **Divisibility condition**: Since ((p-1)!) is divisible by ( p-1 ), we can write:    [    (p-1)! = (p-1) cdot Q    ]    for some integer ( Q ).

Points ( P ) and ( Q ) lie on opposite sides of the plane containing the triangle ( triangle ABC ), satisfying ( PA = PB = PC ) and ( QA = QB = QC ). The dihedral angle between planes ( P-AB-Q ) is ( 120^circ ). We need to find a point ( O ) such that the distance from ( O ) to ( A ), ( B ), ( C ), ( P ), and ( Q ) is the same, denoted as ( d ). 2. **Representation and Intersection:**    Let ( D ) be the intersection of the line segment joining ( P ) and ( Q ) with the plane containing ( triangle ABC ). Equivalently, ( D ) is the centroid of ( triangle ABC ). 3. **Midpoint Calculation:**    Consider ( E ) as the midpoint of ( AB ). Since ( D ) is the centroid, ( D ) lies on the line connecting ( C ) and ( E ). The centroid ( D ) of an equilateral triangle divides the median in the ratio ( 2:1 ). Hence:    [    ED = frac{2 sqrt{3}}{3}, quad CD = frac{4 sqrt{3}}{3}    ] 4. **Coordinates and Planar Geometry:**    It's clear that point ( O ) (equidistant from the points ( A ), ( B ), ( C ), ( P ), and ( Q )) must lie on the line segment ( PQ ). 5. **Distance from ( O ) to Plane:**    Assume ( PD = x ) and ( QD = y ).

Since the incircles of triangles (AFG), (BDG), and (CDG) are congruent, they have the same inradius (r). This implies that the semi-perimeters of these triangles are equal. 3. **Medians and Centroid**:    - The centroid (G) of a triangle divides each median into a ratio of 2:1, with the longer segment being closer to the vertex. Let (m_a), (m_b), and (m_c) be the lengths of the medians from vertices (A), (B), and (C) respectively.

So, the price after the second discount = Price after first discount - (15% of Price after first discount) = Rs. 22,500 - (0.15 * Rs. 22,500) = Rs. 22,500 - Rs. 3,375 = Rs. 19,125 3. The third discount is a \\"buy one, get another at 20% off\\" type. Since the customer is only buying one watch, this discount does not apply. Therefore, the price remains the same after the third discount. Price after the third discount = Rs. 19,125 4. The fourth discount is unknown, and the final price paid by the customer is Rs. 14,700. Let's denote the fourth discount percentage as D%. So, the price after the fourth discount = Price after third discount - (D% of Price after third discount) Rs. 14,700 = Rs. 19,125 - (D/100 * Rs. 19,125) Now, let's solve for D: Rs. 14,700 = Rs. 19,125 - (D/100 * Rs. 19,125) Rs. 14,700 = Rs. 19,125 - (0.01D * Rs. 19,125) Rs. 14,700 = Rs. 19,125 - (0.01D * Rs. 19,125) Subtract Rs. 19,125 from both sides: Rs. 14,700 - Rs. 19,125 = - (0.01D * Rs. 19,125) - Rs. 4,425 = - (0.01D * Rs. 19,125) Divide both sides by - Rs. 19,125: Rs. 4,425 / Rs. 19,125 = 0.01D Calculate the left side: D = (Rs. 4,425 / Rs. 19,125) / 0.01 D = (0.2314049587) / 0.01 D = 23.14049587% The percentage of the fourth discount given to the customer is approximately boxed{23.14%} ."},{"instruction":"Given a triangle, let us define the “middle distance” from any line in the plane to the triangle as follows: If the line does not intersect the triangle, the middle distance is the sum of the distances from the vertices to the line.

Where are the lines located for which the middle distance to the triangle is a given value d?","output":"1. **Preparation**: We first show that the \\"median distance\\" of the lines passing through the centroid ( S ) of the triangle ( ABC ) from the triangle itself is 0.  2. **Centroid and Median**: Assume one such line ( e ) is a median, for instance ( AA' ), where ( A' ) is the midpoint of side ( BC ). The distance of ( A ) from ( e ) is 0 because it lies on the line ( e ). The distances ( B ) and ( C ) from ( e ), denoted ( BB_1 ) and ( CC_1 ) respectively, form two congruent right triangles ( A'BB_1 ) and ( A'CC_1 ) (equal hypotenuse and angles). Thus, ( BB_1 = CC_1 ), making the median distance difference truly 0.  3. **Other Lines through Centroid**: For any other line ( e_0 ) passing through the centroid ( S ), it may separate one vertex from the other two. Suppose ( e_0 ) separates vertex ( A ) from ( B ) and ( C ). The sum of the distances of ( B ) and ( C ) from ( e_0 ) will be equal to twice the distance from ( A' ) to ( e_0 ) due to the trapezoid properties in ( B_0C_0 parallel BC ) (projections of ( B ) and ( C ) onto ( e_0 )). Using the centroid properties, the distance ( AA_0 ) from ( A ) to ( e_0 ) is twice ( A'A'_0 ) due to triangle similarity and proportional division at the centroid (2:1 ratio). Hence, the median distance remains 0. ![](https://cdn.mathpix.com/cropped/2024_05_02_f0ee136eab4765cc9438g-1.jpg?height=425&width=786&top_left_y=541&top_left_x=667) 4. **Parallel Line Consideration**: Suppose ( e ) is parallel to ( e_0 ) and at a distance ( t ) from it. Line ( e ) could be generated by translating ( e_0 ) by ( t ) along the perpendicular direction. As a result, the distance from ( e ) to the vertices of the triangle changes by ( t ) depending on the side they lie relative to ( e_0 ). 5. **Distance Calculation**: If ( e_1 ) is on the same side of ( e_0 ) as ( B ) and ( C ), then the distance from ( A ) to ( e_1 ) becomes ( t_1 ) more, while the distances from ( B ) and ( C ) to ( e_1 ) become ( t_1 ) less each. This results in a net median distance change:    [    AA_1 - (BB_1 + CC_1) = 3t_1    ]    Similarly, if ( e_2 ) is closer to ( A ), the net change will be:    [    (BB_2 + CC_2) - AA_2 = 3t_2    ]    Thus, the net change due to moving the line ( t ) units translates to a median distance change of ( 3t ). 6. **Generalization of Absolute Value**: The observed ( t )-related changes are in the distance calculations involving absolute values. Addition of a distance ( t ) changes overall compact sum ( 3t ) without specific vertex consideration.  7. **Conclusion**: Given that the centroid shifted line produces ( 3t ) changes in median distance, lines with an exact median distance ( d ) are precisely those at a distance ( frac{d}{3} ) from the centroid of the triangle ( S ). These lines will exactly touch a circle centered at ( S ) with radius ( frac{d}{3} ).

Since the pond has irregular dimensions, we will calculate the volume using the average dimensions for length, width, and depth.

First, let's calculate the average dimensions: - Average length (L) = (18 m + 22 m) / 2 = 20 m - Average width (W) = (14 m + 16 m) / 2 = 15 m - Average depth (D) = (4.5 m + 5.5 m) / 2 = 5 m Now, let's calculate the volume for each layer of soil: - The first layer of soil has a depth of 2.5 m, so its volume (V1) is:   V1 = L * W * 2.5 m = 20 m * 15 m * 2.5 m = 750 m³ - The remaining depth for the second layer of soil is 5 m - 2.5 m = 2.5 m, so its volume (V2) is:   V2 = L * W * 2.5 m = 20 m * 15 m * 2.5 m = 750 m³ Now, we need to convert the densities from g/cm³ to kg/m³ to be consistent with the volume in cubic meters: - Density of the first layer (ρ1) = 1.8 g/cm³ = 1.8 * 1000 kg/m³ = 1800 kg/m³ - Density of the second layer (ρ2) = 2.2 g/cm³ = 2.2 * 1000 kg/m³ = 2200 kg/m³ Next, we calculate the weight of the soil for each layer: - Weight of the first layer (W1) = V1 * ρ1 = 750 m³ * 1800 kg/m³ = 1,350,000 kg - Weight of the second layer (W2) = V2 * ρ2 = 750 m³ * 2200 kg/m³ = 1,650,000 kg Finally, we add the weights of both layers to get the total weight of the soil extracted: - Total weight (W_total) = W1 + W2 = 1,350,000 kg + 1,650,000 kg = 3,000,000 kg Therefore, the total weight of the soil extracted from the pond is boxed{3,000,000}  kg."},{"instruction":"On the table, there are  1024  marbles and two students,  A  and  B , alternatively take a positive number of marble(s).

The limiting factor will be the number of 5s because there are always more factors of 2 than 5 in a factorial. Let's count the number of 5s in 170!: - Every multiple of 5 contributes at least one factor of 5. - Every multiple of 25 contributes an additional factor (since 25 = 5^2). - Every multiple of 125 contributes yet another factor (since 125 = 5^3).

First, we analyze the possible remainders of (2^p) modulo 15:     - (2^1 = 2)  which gives a remainder of 2.     - (2^2 = 4)  which gives a remainder of 4.     - (2^3 = 8)  which gives a remainder of 8.     - (2^4 = 16) which gives a remainder of 1 (since (16 equiv 1 pmod{15})).    Since (2^4 = 1 pmod{15}), the remainders will repeat every 4 cycles. Therefore, the possible remainders of (2^p) modulo 15 are (1, 2, 4,) and (8). 2. Next, we analyze the possible remainders of (5^q) modulo 15:     - (5^1 = 5) which gives a remainder of 5.     - (5^2 = 25) which gives a remainder of 10 (since (25 equiv 10 pmod{15})).

Thus, the remainders will alternate between 5 and 10 for odd and even powers, respectively. Additionally, (5^0 = 1 pmod{15}). Therefore, the possible remainders of (5^q) modulo 15 are (1, 5,) and (10). 3. Finally, we analyze the possible remainders of (19^r) modulo 15:     - (19 equiv 4 pmod{15}).     Therefore, analyzing further:     - (19^1 = 19) which gives a remainder of 4.     - (19^2 = 361) which gives a remainder of 1 (since (361 equiv 1 pmod{15})).     - (19^3 = 6859) which gives a remainder of 4 (since (19^3 = (19^2 times 19) equiv 1 times 4 = 4 pmod{15})).     - (19^4 = 130321) which gives a remainder of 1 (since (19^4 = (19^2)^2 equiv 1^2 = 1 pmod{15})).

However, not all lines that pass through the origin (with equal intercepts) can be represented in this form alone.

Let ( N ) be a ( k )-digit natural number. This means that ( 10^{k-1} leq N < 10^k ).  2. We need ( N ) to have the property that the first digits of ( N^2 ) match ( N ). Hence,    [    N cdot 10^{k-1} leq N^2 leq N cdot 10^k    ]    This implies that ( N^2 ) is a number with either ( 2k-1 ) or ( 2k ) digits. 3.

Then, we apply the conditional probability formula to find P(B|A). **Detailed Solution** Since event A requires \\"x+y is an even number\\", x and y must either both be odd or both be even. There are 3 even numbers (2, 4, 6) and 3 odd numbers (1, 3, 5) on a die, which gives us a total of 3 times 3 = 9 pairs for each case (both odd or both even), resulting in 9 + 9 = 18 favorable outcomes for event A out of 6 times 6 = 36 total possible outcomes. Thus, the probability of event A is: P(A) = frac{18}{36} = frac{1}{2}. Now, let's consider event B happening together with A. For x+y to be even with one even and one odd number, and x neq y, the possible pairs are (2,3), (2,5), (4,1), (4,3), (6,1), (6,5), and the reverse pairs: (3,2), (5,2), (1,4), (3,4), (1,6), (5,6). That is a total of 12 pairs. However, since B requires one to be even and different from the other, we must exclude the pairs where the numbers are the same (e.g., (2,2) or (4,4)). Thus, the probability of joint events A and B is: P(AB) = frac{12}{36} = frac{1}{3}. The above calculation for P(AB) assumes that x and y can take any value independently, which is not correct considering that event A is already known to have happened. Let's rectify this by reconsidering the pairs (2,4), (2,6), (4,2), (4,6), (6,2), (6,4) which are the only even pairs different from each other and summing up to an even number.

To determine for which value of n this probability is maximized, we compare V_n and V_{n+1}:    [    V_n < V_{n+1}    ]    [    frac{n cdot 5^{n-1}}{6^n} < frac{(n+1) cdot 5^n}{6^{n+1}}    ] 5.

From the inequality, we see the probability increases as long as n<5. Now we need to check ( V_5 ) and ( V_6 ). 7. Calculate ( V_5 ) and ( V_6 ):    [    V_5 = frac{5 cdot 5^4}{6^5} = frac{5 cdot 625}{7776} = frac{3125}{7776}    ]    [    V_6 = frac{6 cdot 5^5}{6^6} = frac{6 cdot 3125}{46656} = frac{18750}{46656}    ]    Simplify ( V_5 ) and ( V_6 ):    [    V_5 = frac{3125}{7776} approx 0.402    ]    [    V_6 = frac{18750}{46656} approx 0.402    ] 8.

The investor invested 1,700 in the first mutual fund, which earned a 9% profit. The profit from this investment can be calculated as follows: Profit from the first fund = 9% of 1,700 = 0.09 * 1,700 = 153 The total amount invested in both funds is 1,900, so the amount invested in the second mutual fund is: 1,900 - 1,700 = 200 The total profit from both funds is 52. Since we already know the profit from the first fund (153), we can calculate the profit from the second fund: Profit from the second fund = Total profit - Profit from the first fund Profit from the second fund = 52 - 153 = -101 However, it's not possible to have a negative profit as the total profit is positive. It seems there might be a mistake in the provided information. The profit from the first fund (153) is already greater than the total profit (52), which means the second fund must have incurred a loss, not a profit.

Speed of the first train in m/s = 90 km/h * (1000 m / 1 km) * (1 h / 3600 s) = 25 m/s Speed of the second train in m/s = 75 km/h * (1000 m / 1 km) * (1 h / 3600 s) = 20.83 m/s (approximately) Since the trains are moving towards each other, we add their speeds to get the relative speed.

Given that the coordinates of (A, B, C, D) are integers, point (E) will also have integer coordinates due to the property of integer grid points. 3. **Using the Law of Cosines**:    To use the Law of Cosines, observe the triangle (ACE) with ( angle CAE = 45^circ ):    [    CE^2 = AC^2 + AE^2 - 2(AC)(AE) cos 45^circ    ] 4. **Value substitution**:     Since (AC = 2BD), substitute this into the equation:     [     CE^2 = (2BD)^2 + AE^2 - 2(2BD)(AE) frac{sqrt{2}}{2}     ]     Simplifying the equation,     [     CE^2 = 4BD^2 + AE^2 - 2sqrt{2}BD cdot AE     ] 5. **Analyzing the terms**:    It is given that the distances in the coordinate plane between integer points are integers, which means (AC, BD, AE) are integers, so their squares are also integers. 6. **Rational and irrational terms**:    Notice that in the expression (4BD^2 + AE^2 - 2sqrt{2}BD cdot AE), the left side of the equation involves squared terms of distances, which must be integers. However, the term (2sqrt{2}BD cdot AE) is irrational unless (BD) and (AE) are zero, which cannot be the case as otherwise diagonals would not exist. 7. **Contradiction**:    Since the left-hand side (LHS) of the cosine law expression is an integer and the right-hand side (RHS) contains an irrational term unless the diagonals or areas are zero - which contradicts the assumption that there are actual lengths for (AC) and (BD) - we achieve a contradiction. # Conclusion: Hence, it is impossible to draw such a cyclic quadrilateral under the given conditions on a coordinate plane with all vertices having integer coordinates.

( f^{2000}(m) = f(m) ) Let's analyze each condition step by step. # Step 1: Analyzing Condition (a) Condition (a) states that ( f(m) = 1 ) if and only if ( m = 1 ). This implies that ( f(1) = 1 ) and for any ( m neq 1 ), ( f(m) neq 1 ). # Step 2: Analyzing Condition (b) Condition (b) involves the greatest common divisor (gcd). Let's rewrite it for clarity: [ d = gcd(m, n) implies f(m cdot n) = frac{f(m) cdot f(n)}{f(d)} ] To understand this, consider the prime factorization of ( m ) and ( n ). Let: [ m = p_1^{a_1} p_2^{a_2} cdots p_k^{a_k} ] [ n = p_1^{b_1} p_2^{b_2} cdots p_k^{b_k} ] Then: [ gcd(m, n) = p_1^{min(a_1, b_1)} p_2^{min(a_2, b_2)} cdots p_k^{min(a_k, b_k)} ] [ m cdot n = p_1^{a_1 + b_1} p_2^{a_2 + b_2} cdots p_k^{a_k + b_k} ] Using condition (b), we get: [ f(m cdot n) = frac{f(m) cdot f(n)}{f(gcd(m, n))} ] # Step 3: Analyzing Condition (c) Condition (c) states that ( f^{2000}(m) = f(m) ). This means that applying the function ( f ) 2000 times returns the original value. This implies that ( f ) is periodic with period dividing 2000. # Step 4: Combining Conditions From condition (b), we can infer that ( f ) is multiplicative. Let's assume ( f ) is defined on prime powers. Let ( p ) be a prime and ( k ) be a positive integer. Then: [ f(p^k) = f(p) cdot f(p^{k-1}) ] By induction, we can show that: [ f(p^k) = f(p)^k ] # Step 5: Using Condition (c) Since ( f ) is periodic with period dividing 2000, we need to find ( f(p) ) such that ( f(p)^{2000} = f(p) ). This implies: [ f(p)^{1999} = 1 ] The only natural number that satisfies this equation is 1. However, from condition (a), ( f(p) neq 1 ) for any prime ( p ). Therefore, we need to find another solution. # Step 6: Conclusion Given the constraints, the only possible solution that satisfies all conditions is: [ f(n) = n ] Let's verify: 1. ( f(1) = 1 ) and for ( m neq 1 ), ( f(m) neq 1 ). 2. ( f(m cdot n) = m cdot n = frac{m cdot n}{gcd(m, n)} cdot gcd(m, n) = frac{f(m) cdot f(n)}{f(gcd(m, n))} ). 3. ( f^{2000}(m) = m = f(m) ).

However, the height is not directly given; instead, we have the slant height (16 cm) and the angle between the base and the slant height (60 degrees). We need to find the vertical height (h) of the parallelogram, which is the perpendicular distance from the base to the opposite side. Since the slant height and the angle are given, we can use trigonometry to find the vertical height. The vertical height is the side opposite the angle in the right triangle formed by the slant height, the base, and the height of the parallelogram. Using the sine function, which is defined as the ratio of the opposite side to the hypotenuse in a right triangle, we have: sin(angle) = opposite / hypotenuse In this case, the opposite side is the height (h) we are trying to find, and the hypotenuse is the slant height (16 cm). The angle is 60 degrees. Plugging in the values, we get: sin(60 degrees) = h / 16 cm To find the height (h), we rearrange the equation: h = 16 cm * sin(60 degrees) Now, we calculate the sine of 60 degrees: sin(60 degrees) = √3 / 2 (approximately 0.866) So, the height (h) is: h = 16 cm * 0.866 h ≈ 13.856 cm Now that we have the height, we can find the area of the parallelogram: Area = base * height Area = 24 cm * 13.856 cm Area ≈ 332.544 cm² Therefore, the area of the parallelogram is approximately boxed{332.544}  square centimeters."},{"instruction":"Given that S_{5}=50, S_{1}, S_{2}, S_{4} form a geometric sequence, and S_{6}=3(a_{6}+2), choose any two of these three conditions and add them to the following question, then solve the problem.<br/>Question: For an arithmetic sequence {a_{n}} with a common difference of dleft(dneq 0right), where the sum of the first n terms is S_{n}, and it satisfies _____.<br/>(1) Find a_{n};<br/>(2) If b_{n}b_{n1}=2a_{n}(ngeqslant 2), and b_{1}a_{1}=1, find the sum of the first n terms of the sequence {frac{1}{{{b_n}}}} denoted as T_{n}.","output":"# Step-by-Step Solution  Part 1: Finding a_{n} Given conditions: - S_{5}=50 - S_{1}, S_{2}, S_{4} form a geometric sequence - S_{6}=3(a_{6}+2) From the formula for the sum of the first n terms of an arithmetic sequence, S_{n}=frac{n}{2}(2a_{1}+(n-1)d), we can derive the following equations based on the given conditions: 1. **Using S_{5}=50:**    [    S_{5}=50 Leftrightarrow 5a_{1}+10d=50 Leftrightarrow a_{1}+2d=10    ] 2. **For S_{1}, S_{2}, S_{4} forming a geometric sequence:**    [    S_{2}^{2}=S_{1}S_{4} Leftrightarrow (2a_{1}+d)^{2}=a_{1}(4a_{1}+6d) Leftrightarrow d=2a_{1}    ] 3. **Using S_{6}=3(a_{6}+2):**    [    S_{6}=3(a_{6}+2) Leftrightarrow 6a_{1}+15d=3(a_{1}+5d+2)    ] Choosing any two of these conditions to solve, we find that in all cases (1 and 2, 1 and 3, 2 and 3), the solution for a_{1} and d is consistent: - a_{1}=2 - d=4 Therefore, the general term a_{n} of the arithmetic sequence is: [ a_{n}=a_{1}+d(n-1)=2+4(n-1)=4n-2 ] Encapsulating the final answer for a_{n}: [ boxed{a_{n}=4n-2} ]  Part 2: Finding T_{n} Given: - b_{1}-a_{1}=1, with a_{1}=2, we find b_{1}=3. - b_{n}-b_{n-1}=2a_{n}=8n-4 for ngeqslant 2.

Therefore, banks perceive this as a reduced risk factor. 3. **Indirect Financial Contributions from Younger Relatives:**    - **Argument:** Often, younger relatives of pensioners might be interested in securing better credit terms through the pensioners.    - **Details:** This situation can result in the banks getting indirect financial input from these younger individuals, addressing their credit needs through the pensioner's more favorable conditions.  Deposit Placement: 1. **Pensioner’s Inclination to Save:**    - **Argument:** Many pensioners tend to save money both for their descendants and for future burial expenses.    - **Details:** Their fear of keeping large sums of money at home drives them to make deposits in banks. To attract pensioners, banks often raise interest rates on deposits for them. 2. **Regular Monthly Income for Planning Savings:**    - **Argument:** Despite being a small amount, the pension provides a stable monthly income.    - **Details:** This stability helps pensioners plan their expenditures and savings effectively, making them reliable long-term depositors for banks. 3. **Preference for Long-term Deposits:**    - **Argument:** The majority of pensioners prefer long-term deposits with higher interest rates compared to short-term deposits.    - **Details:** This preference is advantageous for banks as it provides them with more stable long-term funds to manage their financial operations. # Conclusion: In addition to the above reasons, it is worth noting that one-third of Russia’s population is of pension or pre-pension age. Therefore, attracting funds from such a large demographic group is appealing for banks despite the age-related risks. A considerable portion of pensioners also work, which further increases the reliability and attractiveness of their funds for banks. In summary: - The stable income and reliable financial habits of pensioners make them ideal candidates for both credit offerings and savings deposits. - Banks can benefit by offering slightly higher interest rates to attract substantial and stable long-term deposits from pensioners, who tend to plan their finances responsibly. Therefore, banks' policies of offering higher deposit rates and lower credit rates to pensioners can be justified by: 1. Pensioners’ reliable credit repayment behavior. 2. The stable and predictable nature of pension income. 3. The potential for indirect financial benefits from younger relatives. 4. Pensioners’ propensity to save. 5. The preference of pensioners for long-term deposits. 6. The significant portion of the demographic. boxed{10 text{ points}}"},{"instruction":"John buys a pair of earbuds that cost 200.

We then break this into two separate integrals:  int 3 , dx + int frac{5x^2 + 12x - 11}{(x+2)(x-2)(x-1)} , dx.  The first integral is straightforward:  int 3 , dx = 3x + C_1,  where (C_1) is an arbitrary constant of integration. Now we focus on the second integral. We need to decompose the rational function into partial fractions. Assume:  frac{5x^2 + 12x - 11}{(x+2)(x-2)(x-1)} = frac{A}{x+2} + frac{B}{x-2} + frac{C}{x-1}. \`\`\` Multiplying both sides by ((x+2)(x-2)(x-1)), we obtain:  5x^2 + 12x - 11 = A(x-2)(x-1) + B(x+2)(x-1) + C(x+2)(x-2).  Expanding and combining like terms, we get:  5x^2 + 12x - 11 = A(x^2 - 3x + 2) + B(x^2 + x - 2) + C(x^2 - 4).  Equating coefficients of (x^2), (x), and the constant term from both sides, we get the following system of equations:  begin{cases} A + B + C = 5,  -3A + B = 12,  2A - 2B - 4C = -11. end{cases} \`\`\` By solving this system, we add the first equation multiplied by 4 to the third equation:  2A - 2B - 4C + 4(A + B + C) = -11 + 20,  which simplifies to:  6A + 2B = 9.  Adding the second equation multiplied by 2 to the above result, we have:  -6A + 2B + 6A + 2B = 24 + 9, \`\`\` which simplifies to:  4B = 33 implies B = frac{33}{4}.  Substituting (B = frac{33}{4}) back into the first and second equations allows solving for (A) and (C): Substituting into (A + frac{33}{4} + C = 5), we get:  A + C = -frac{13}{4}. \`\`\` And,  -3A + frac{33}{4} = 12 implies A = -frac{5}{4}. \`\`\` Then,  -frac{5}{4} + C = -frac{13}{4} implies C = -2. \`\`\` Thus, the partial fraction decomposition gives:  frac{5x^2 + 12x - 11}{(x+2)(x-2)(x-1)} = -frac{5}{4(x+2)} + frac{33}{4(x-2)} - frac{2}{x-1}. \`\`\` Now we integrate each term separately:  int left( -frac{5}{4(x+2)} + frac{33}{4(x-2)} - frac{2}{x-1} right) , dx = -frac{5}{4} int frac{1}{x+2} , dx + frac{33}{4} int frac{1}{x-2} , dx - 2 int frac{1}{x-1} , dx. \`\`\` These integrals are straightforward logarithmic functions:  -frac{5}{4} ln|x+2| + frac{33}{4} ln|x-2| - 2 ln|x-1|. \`\`\` Combining all parts together, we have:  3x + C_1 - frac{5}{4} ln|x+2| + frac{33}{4} ln|x-2| - 2 ln|x-1| + C_2,  where (C_2) is another arbitrary constant.

Let's denote: - A D as the altitude from A - A L as the angle bisector from A - A M as the median from A Next, we extend the angle bisector A L to intersect the circumcircle of the triangle at point A_1.  Since M A_{1} is parallel to A D as a property of the circumcircle and angle bisectors, it follows that: [ angle M A_{1} A = angle L A D ] # Analysis of Angles: 1. **Case 1: angle A < 90^{circ}**    - **Angle between the median and the angle bisector**: When angle A is an acute angle, the median A M and the angle bisector A L make a smaller angle with each other compared to the case when angle A is obtuse.    - **Angle between the angle bisector and the altitude**: Conversely, the angle between the angle bisector A L and the altitude A D is larger when angle A is acute.        Thus, if angle A < 90^{circ}, the angle between the median and the angle bisector is smaller than the angle between the angle bisector and the altitude. 2. **Case 2: angle A > 90^{circ}**    - **Angle between the median and the angle bisector**: When angle A is an obtuse angle, the median A M and the angle bisector A L make a larger angle with each other.    - **Angle between the angle bisector and the altitude**: The angle between the angle bisector A L and the altitude A D is smaller when angle A is obtuse.        Hence, if angle A > 90^{circ}, the angle between the median and the angle bisector is larger than the angle between the angle bisector and the altitude. 3. **Case 3: angle A = 90^{circ}**    - This is a special case where the angles formed between the median, angle bisector, and altitude are equal due to the perpendicular nature of the triangle's base to the altitude from point A leading to a right-angled triangle.

With a+b < 0 and knowing b < 0, we explore the implications for a and b:    - If a and b have the same sign (both negative in this case), since a > b, it would mean |a| < |b| because b's negative value would be further from zero than a's.    - If a and b have opposite signs, given that b < 0, a must be non-negative to satisfy a > b. In this scenario, the absolute value comparison still holds: |a| < |b| because a+b < 0 implies that the magnitude of b must exceed that of a to result in a negative sum. Therefore, regardless of whether a and b share the same sign or not, the conditions lead us to conclude that b is a negative number and |b| > |a|.

Evaluating the derivative at -x yields:  f'(-x) = 3(-x)^2 - 2ax + (a-3) = 3x^2 - 2ax + (a-3)  Setting the expressions for f'(x) and f'(-x) equal to each other yields:  3x^2 + 2ax + (a-3) = 3x^2 - 2ax + (a-3)  This equation must be valid for all x, so by equating the coefficients of the powers of x, we find that 2ax = -2ax, which implies that a=0 since x can be any real number. Thus, the derivative simplifies to:  f'(x) = 3x^2 - 3  In particular, the derivative at the origin x=0 is f'(0) = -3. Therefore, the equation of the tangent line to y=f(x) at the origin is:  y = mx + b  where m is the slope of the tangent line at x=0, which is -3, and b is the y-intercept, which is 0 because the line is tangent to the origin.

Let's use an algebraic method by coding each boy as ( -1 ) and each girl as ( +1 ). 2. **Neighbor Calculations:**    Since we assumed no person has two girls as neighbors, each person must have neighbors ((-1, -1)) or ((+1, -1)). 3. **Summation of Neighbor Pairs:**    We sum the contributions of the pairs associated with the neighbors of each person twice. This gives us:     [    x cdot (-2) + y cdot (0) = 25 cdot (-1) + 25 cdot (+1)    ]    where ( x ) is the number of people who have 2 boys as neighbors, and ( y ) is the number of people who have one boy and one girl as neighbors. 4. **Equation Setup:**    We have the following system of equations:    [    x cdot (-2) + y cdot (0) = 0 quad text{and} quad x + y = 50    ] 5. **Solve for ( x ):**    From the first equation:    [    x cdot (-2) = 0    ]    Thus, we find:    [    x = 0    ] 6. **Substitute ( x ) back into the second equation:**    [    0 + y = 50    ]    Therefore:    [    y = 50    ] 7. **Conclusion from the Result:**    Since ( x = 0 ) and ( y = 50 ), all people have one boy and one girl as neighbors. This implies that there are alternating ((-1))'s and ((+1))'s, i.e., boys and girls alternately around the table. 8. **Check Consistency with the Given Problem:**    Now, we need to verify this situation with the initial setting of 25 boys and 25 girls. A continuous alternation would look like ((cdots, -1, +1, -1, +1, cdots)). Notice that alternating boys and girls around the table creates a contradiction:    - In this alternating sequence, each boy, and each girl are surrounded by members of the opposite sex, which means not all assumptions hold true. 9. **Contradiction Identified:**    Thus, the initial assumption that no person has two adjacent girls must be false because it forces an impossible configuration.  **Conclusion:** Hence, there must be at least one person who has two adjacent girls as neighbors.

Drawing two cards without replacement from a set of six cards results in binom{6}{2} = 15 unique pairs, as calculated by the combination formula binom{n}{r} = frac{n!}{r!(n-r)!}, where n is the total number of items, and r is the number of items to choose. The pairs are as follows: - left(1,2right), left(1,3right), left(1,4right), left(1,5right), left(1,6right) - left(2,3right), left(2,4right), left(2,5right), left(2,6right) - left(3,4right), left(3,5right), left(3,6right) - left(4,5right), left(4,6right) - left(5,6right) This results in a total of 15 possible pairs.

A product is a multiple of 4 if at least one of the numbers is a multiple of 4 or both numbers are even (since two even numbers multiply to give a multiple of 4).

So we can write another equation: a_1+3d=15 Now, we have a system of two equations: begin{cases} a_1+3d=15  55=frac{5}{2}(a_1+15+d) end{cases} Solving this system, we find a_1=3 and d=4. 3. Next, let's find a_{10} and a_{11} using the formula for an arithmetic sequence: a_{n}=a_1+(n-1)d So, a_{10}=3+(10-1)cdot4=39 a_{11}=3+(11-1)cdot4=43 4.

The formula for the slope of a line passing through two points (x_1,y_1) and (x_2,y_2) is given by: m=frac{y_2-y_1}{x_2-x_1} Using the values we found, we can calculate the slope: m=frac{a_{11}-a_{10}}{11-10}=frac{43-39}{1}=boxed{4}"},{"instruction":"Two real numbers x and y satisfy x  y = 5 and x^3  y^3 = 35.

(2)(i) Since g(x) = x - frac{a}{x}, therefore g'(x) = 1 + frac{a}{x^2}, From (1), when m = 2, x = sqrt{frac{m}{2}} = 1 is a critical point of the function f(x), so x = 1 is a critical point of the function g(x), therefore g'(1) = 1 + a = 0, solving this gives a = -1, Upon verification, when a = -1, the function g(x) reaches a minimum at x = 1, which is consistent with the problem statement, (ii) Since fleft(frac{1}{e}right) = -frac{1}{e^2} - 2, f(1) = -1, f(5) = -25 + 2ln 5, it is easy to see that f(5) < fleft(frac{1}{e}right) < f(1), For all x_1 in left[frac{1}{e}, 5right], f_{min}(x) = f(5) = -25 + 2ln 5, f_{max}(x) = f(1) = -1, From (i), we know g(x) = x + frac{1}{x}, therefore g'(x) = 1 - frac{1}{x^2}, When x in left[frac{1}{e}, 1right), g'(x) < 0; when x in (1, 5), g'(x) > 0, Thus, g(x) is decreasing on left[frac{1}{e}, 1right) and increasing on (1, 5). Since gleft(frac{1}{e}right) = e + frac{1}{e}, g(1) = 2, g(5) = 5 + frac{1}{5} = frac{26}{5}, And 2 < e + frac{1}{e} < frac{26}{5}, therefore g(1) < gleft(frac{1}{e}right) < g(5), Therefore, for all x_2 in left[frac{1}{e}, 5right], g_{min}(x_2) = g(1) = 2, g_{max}(x_2) = g(5) = frac{26}{5}. (i) When t + 1 > 0, i.e., t > -1, for all x_1, x_2 in left[frac{1}{e}, 5right], frac{f(x_1) - g(x_2)}{t+1} leqslant 1 always holds, Leftrightarrow t + 1 geqslant left[f(x_1) - g(x_2)right]_{max} Leftrightarrow t geqslant left[f(x_1) - g(x_2)right]_{max} - 1, Since f(x_1) - g(x_2) leqslant f(1) - g(1) = -1 - 2 = -3, therefore t geqslant -3 - 1 = -4, and t > -1, therefore t > -1. (ii) When t + 1 < 0, i.e., t < -1, for all x_1, x_2 in left[frac{1}{e}, 5right], frac{f(x_1) - g(x_2)}{t+1} leqslant 1 always holds, Leftrightarrow t + 1 leqslant left[f(x_1) - g(x_2)right]_{min} Leftrightarrow t leqslant left[f(x_1) - g(x_2)right]_{min} - 1, Since f(x_1) - g(x_2) geqslant f(3) - g(3) = -25 + 2ln 5 - frac{26}{5} = -frac{151}{5} + 2ln 5, therefore t leqslant -frac{151}{5} + 2ln 5 - 1 = -frac{156}{5} + 2ln 5, And t < -1, therefore t leqslant -frac{156}{5} + 2ln 5.

Since a tree with ( N=2002 ) cities is connected and free of cycles, it will have exactly ( N-1=2001 ) edges. Conclusively, the number of cities connected without a cycle ensures that there are 2002 cities eventually in a single connected tree structure. This tree, by definition, will have ( 2001 ) edges.

Evaluating this derivative at the point (4, e^{2}) gives us the slope of the tangent line:  m = y'(4) = frac{1}{2}e^{frac{1}{2}cdot 4} = frac{1}{2}e^{2}.  Using point-slope form, the equation of the tangent line at (4, e^{2}) is:  y - e^{2} = frac{1}{2}e^{2}(x - 4).

Given that f(x + 2) is an odd function, we can express this as: [ f(-x + 2) = -f(x + 2) tag{2} ] This indicates that f(x) is point-symmetric about the point (2, 0). From equation (1), if we let x = 1, we get: [ f(0) = f(2) = 4a + b tag{3} ] This is because, when x in [1,2], f(x) = ax^{2} + b and substituting x = 2 into this gives f(2) = 4a + b. Equation (2) leads us to: [ f(3) = -f(1) = -(a + b) tag{4} ] This is derived from substituting x = 1 into the given form of f(x) for x in [1,2], which yields f(1) = a + b. Given that f(0) + f(3) = 6, combining this with equations (3) and (4) we find: [ 4a + b - (a + b) = 6 ] Simplifying, we get: [ 3a = 6 Rightarrow a = 2 ] Using equation (3), we substitute a = 2 to find b: [ 4(2) + b = f(2) ] Since f(2) = 0 (from f(x+2) being an odd function implying f(2) = -f(2), hence f(2) = 0), we find: [ 8 + b = 0 Rightarrow b = -8 ] Thus, within the domain x in [1,2], the function f(x) is: [ f(x) = 2x^{2} - 8 ] Since f(x) is symmetric about x = 1 and point-symmetric about (2, 0), f(x) possesses a period of T = 4 times (2 - 1) = 4. This periodicity means f(x) = f(x + 4), leading us to conclude: [ f(5) = f(1 + 4) = f(1) = 2(1)^{2} - 8 = 2 - 8 = -6 ] Therefore, our final answer, encapsulated as requested, is boxed{C}."},{"instruction":"There are 2 sections, A and B, in a class.

Here, adjacent means that they share a common boundary segment, not just a point. 1. **Base Cases**: Consider maps with different numbers of regions and check the number of colors needed:    * For two adjacent regions, ( Gamma ) and ( mathcal{W} ), two colors are required because they share a boundary (Case 1).    * For three regions where all pairs are adjacent, three colors are necessary. Each region adjacent to both of the other two must have a unique color (Case 2).    * We must ensure that every new region added can still adhere to the coloring constraint without exceeding four colors. 2. **Adjacent Regions Analysis**:    * Consider a configuration of four regions ( Gamma, mathcal{W}, mathcal{K}, mathcal{Z} ). Imagine each is connected to each other (forming a complete graph ( K_4 )). Attempt to color these with four colors such that no two adjacent regions share the same color. 3. **Impossible Configurations**:    * For a ( K_5 ) (where each vertex is connected to every other), five colors might be assumed necessary, but this cannot appear in planar graphs. Therefore, it's impossible within the rules of map coloring on a plane. 4. **Suppose Four Adjacent Countries Config**:    * Any four complete adjacent regions can be colored exactly by four colors. This serves as our inductive step. 5. **Expanding to Larger Maps**:    * For any configuration, when extending a map by adding new regions, always ensure previous regions stay properly colored.    * Each new region added will be adjacent to some subset of existing regions. If adding the new region breaks the coloring rule (requiring a fifth color), adjust the coloring starting from this \\"conflict\\" backward until using only four colors. 6. **Proof Visualizations**:    * Diagrams like Cases 8-11 show configurations where regions can partially or fully connect.    * We can always go back and adjust if any new addition would supposedly require a fifth color, ensuring no five regions completely connected. 7. **Spanning and Redrawing**:    * If needed, configurations could be simplified by transforming (bridges or straighter lines) without violating the planarity.    * This recursive and adjustive coloring guarantees adherence without exceeding four colors. 8. **Conclusion**:    * Each step expanding the map, while ensuring previous regions adhere, does not exceed four colors since any assumed contradiction (need a fifth) would already be adjustable under four-color rule. The theorem asserts no map requires more than four colors as any posed configuration, through iterative adjustments and ensuring at each step can maintain the max four colors rule.

Squaring both sides, we get (sinalpha - cosalpha)^2 = 1 - 2sinalphacosalpha = frac{4}{9}. This implies 2sinalphacosalpha = frac{5}{9}. Now, (sinalpha + cosalpha)^2 = 1 + 2sinalphacosalpha = 1 + frac{5}{9} = frac{14}{9}. Since alpha is in the first quadrant, both sinalpha and cosalpha are positive, and so is sinalpha + cosalpha.

In qquad years, the sum of his father's and mother's ages will be 6 times Xiaoxiang's age.","output":"1. Let's introduce a variable ( x ) to represent the number of years into the future. 2. Currently, Xiaofei's age is 5 years, father's age is 48 years, and mother's age is 42 years. 3. In ( x ) years, Xiaofei's age will be ( 5 + x ) years. 4. Similarly, in ( x ) years, the father's age will be ( 48 + x ) years and the mother's age will be ( 42 + x ) years. 5. According to the problem, in ( x ) years, the sum of the father's and mother's ages will be 6 times Xiaofei's age at that time. 6. Set up the equation based on the problem's information:    [    (48 + x) + (42 + x) = 6 cdot (5 + x)    ] 7. Simplify the equation step by step:    [    48 + 42 + x + x = 6 cdot (5 + x)    ]    [    90 + 2x = 30 + 6x    ] 8. To isolate ( x ), move all terms involving ( x ) to one side:    [    90 + 2x = 30 + 6x    ]    [    90 - 30 = 6x - 2x    ]    [    60 = 4x    ] 9.
