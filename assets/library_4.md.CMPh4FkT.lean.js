Officials said earlier that only designs and manuals of plant equipment were leaked, and reactors' innermost networks were not compromised. South Korea has not ruled out North Korean involvement in the attack. Ms Park made no mention of any link between the North and the cyber attack but said the plants remained safe. She told officials in a cabinet meeting to check their preparations and inspect safeguards against cyber terrorism on the nation's key facilities, including nuclear reactors. She called the data leak a \\"grave situation that is unacceptable\\", and said there should have been \\"not a trace of lapse as a matter of national security\\", in remarks reported by Reuters. Yonhap reported that the hacker posted on Twitter on Tuesday afternoon four files of reactor-related information, including what appeared to be diagrams of facilities, and reasserted demands that reactors be suspended. Korea Hydro and Nuclear Power Co Ltd (KHNP) has been conducting large-scale drills at four nuclear power plant complexes. A hacker calling himself \\"president of the anti-nuclear reactor group\\" had posted blueprints of nuclear reactors on social media on Friday, in the latest in a series of postings since 15 December, and demanding some reactors be closed by Christmas. Officials have asked the US Federal Bureau of Investigation for help in finding the hacker, after discovering that IP addresses in multiple locations had been used, including South Korea, the US and Japan, reported The Korea Times. North Korea outage Ms Park in the same cabinet meeting also referred to the recent hacking of US movie studio Sony Pictures, saying it was a reminder of the \\"seriousness of cyber terrorism\\". The US has attributed the Sony hacking to North Korea over the film The Interview, and President Barack Obama has vowed the US would take a \\"proportionate response\\".

He loved both ranges, but liked the caves systems and blue holes in the Ozarks a bit more.  But I can use this background: About 10% of sedimentary rocks are limestones. The solubility of limestone in water and weak acid solutions leads to karst landscapes, in which water erodes the limestone over thousands to millions of years. Most cave systems are through limestone bedrock.  What is an answer for this question: Which mountains have a larger percent of sedimentary rock? The answer to this question is:","output":"It is not explicitly mentioned in the information given which of the two mountain ranges, the Ozarks or the Colorado Rockies, has a larger percentage of sedimentary rocks. Therefore, to answer the question, we need to look at the broader geological characteristics of these two ranges. The Colorado Rockies are known for their diversity of rock types, including granites, metamorphic, and sedimentary rocks. They incorporate a wide range of geological formations from the Precambrian to the modern era. However, the Rockies are notable for their igneous and metamorphic rock formations, which were formed due to tectonic activities and intense heat and pressure. On the other hand, the Ozarks, also known as the Ozark Plateau, are characterized by limestone and dolomite formations. The presence of numerous caves and blue holes in this area suggests a high content of limestone, a sedimentary rock. The solubility of limestone in water and weak acid solutions leads to the formation of karst landscapes, characteristic of regions abundant in limestone and other soluble rocks. Over thousands to millions of years, water erosion generates extensive cave systems found within limestone bedrock.  Therefore, based on the information available, it can be inferred that the Ozarks in Missouri likely have a larger percentage of sedimentary rock, particularly limestone, when compared to the Colorado Rockies. The prevalence of caves and blue holes in the Ozarks is a direct result of the high limestone content, as such features are typically formed through the process of water erosion acting on this type of rock over substantial periods of time."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

The athlete grips the shot put correctly: The first step is to ensure the athlete has a comfortable and proper grip on the shot put. This usually involves placing the shot put at the base of their fingers and resting it above their collarbone, close to their neck. The correct grip is vital for a successful throw. 2. The athlete takes an initial stance: The athlete spreads their feet shoulder-width apart and bends their knees slightly. They need a stable starting position to help generate power and maintain balance during the throw. 3. The athlete winds up: While keeping their elbow high and the shot put close to their neck, the athlete begins to wind up for the throw. This involves twisting their upper body slightly to the opposite direction of the throw (the left side for a right-handed thrower). This winding motion helps the athlete generate power and speed during the throw. 4. The athlete starts the throw: To initiate the throw, the athlete aggressively shifts their weight from their back foot to their front foot. This weight transfer is essential for generating the force necessary to propel the shot put. 5. The athlete releases the shot put: As the athlete transfers their weight and straightens their arm, they push the shot put forward and release it. It is crucial to maintain a proper release angle, which is usually about 45 degrees above the horizon, to achieve maximum distance. 6. The shot put flies through the air: After releasing the shot put, it soars through the air and covers the distance. 7. The athlete observes the throw: As the shot put is flying, the athlete follows its trajectory with their eyes to analyze its path, distance, and any potential improvements needed for future throws. 8.

Translate each phrase:    'If these tankers had been carrying biofuels' -> 'Jos nämä säiliöalukset olisivat kuljettaneet biopolttoaineita'    'then the damage would not have been as devastating' -> 'silloin vahingot eivät olisi olleet yhtä vakavia'    'God knows' -> 'Jumala tietää'    'and biofuels do not need to be transported across the oceans either' -> 'eikä biopolttoaineita tarvitse kuljettaa yli valtamerienkään' 3. Combine the Finnish phrases to form the translated sentence:    'Jos nämä säiliöalukset olisivat kuljettaneet biopolttoaineita, silloin vahingot eivät olisi olleet yhtä vakavia, Jumala tietää, eikä biopolttoaineita tarvitse kuljettaa yli valtamerienkään.' Translation: \\"Jos nämä säiliöalukset olisivat kuljettaneet biopolttoaineita, silloin vahingot eivät olisi olleet yhtä vakavia, Jumala tietää, eikä biopolttoaineita tarvitse kuljettaa yli valtamerienkään.\\""},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Process:  - Air is pulled into the lungs - Oxygen moves from the lungs into the bloodstream - Air is pushed through the vocal chords - A person talks - Other air is pushed out of the lungs into the environment.  Perturbation hypothesis: suppose oxygen is moved through the bloodstream happens, how will it affect the body is unable to filter air.  Does the supposed perturbation have an effect (direct or indirect) on the process?","output":"Based on the process outlined, when oxygen moves through the bloodstream it is part of the respiratory system, which plays a crucial role in transferring oxygen from the air we breathe into the blood and expelling carbon dioxide out of the body. The perturbation hypothesis you mentioned is to suppose that the body is unable to filter air. Air filtration primarily takes place in the nasal cavity and other upper respiratory tract structures such as the pharynx and trachea before entering the lungs. This filtration process helps in removing particles and pathogens from the air to ensure that clean air passes into the lungs. If the body is unable to filter air effectively, several potential consequences may arise: 1. Direct effect on the process (interaction between lungs and bloodstream): The presence of unfiltered air, which may contain pathogens, allergens, or pollutants, can irritate the respiratory system, causing inflammation, mucus production, or even infections. This may lead to poorer gas exchange in the lungs, reducing the efficiency of oxygen moving from the lungs into the bloodstream, and carbon dioxide being removed from the bloodstream. 2. Indirect effect on the process (talking and other respiratory functions): The inability to filter air effectively can also impact other parts of the respiratory process. Irritation or infection in the respiratory system may cause coughing, difficulty in breathing, or reduced airflow. This can impact a person's ability to talk, as the airflow required to produce sound at the vocal cords may be restricted or irregular. Additionally, this could cause discomfort or distress during speaking or breathing. In summary, the inability to filter air effectively can both directly and indirectly impact the outlined process of air moving through the respiratory system and a person talking. It can hinder the efficiency of oxygen and carbon dioxide exchange in the lungs, leading to reduced oxygen supply to the body, and can also affect the ease and quality of a person's speech. Ensuring proper filtration of air is necessary to maintain a healthy respiratory system and its related processes."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant that follows instruction extremely well.

Use evidence from the fact that birds with beaks of different shapes eat different foods to answer this question: \\"What requires nutrients to grow and heal, and use a bill type instrument to process them?\\"","output":"To answer the question \\"What requires nutrients to grow and heal, and use a bill type instrument to process them?\\", let's consider the evidence from the fact that birds with beaks of different shapes eat different foods. Step 1: Observing the relationship between beak shape and food choices In nature, we can observe that birds have a wide variety of beak shapes, and these shapes are closely related to their diets. For example, birds with sharp, hooked beaks (like raptors) eat primarily meat, while birds with slender, pointy beaks (like hummingbirds) eat nectar from flowers. Step 2: Understanding the function of the beak A bird's beak, also known as a bill, is a versatile instrument with several functions. One of the primary functions is processing and obtaining food, whether it's tearing apart flesh, cracking open seeds, or sipping nectar. In this way, the beak serves as a tool that helps birds acquire the nutrients needed for growth, healing, and overall survival. Step 3: Analyzing the need for nutrients All living organisms, including birds, require nutrients for growth, development, and healing. Nutrients, in the form of proteins, carbohydrates, fats, vitamins, and minerals, provide energy and support various physiological processes. Different birds have different nutritional requirements based on their size, metabolism, and life stage, and their beaks have evolved to help them efficiently obtain their preferred food sources and meet their specific needs. Step 4: Bringing the evidence together to answer the question Based on the evidence from the variety of beak shapes among birds and the relationship between beak function and food intake, it is clear that the answer to the question \\"What requires nutrients to grow and heal, and use a bill type instrument to process them?\\" is birds. More specifically, the different beak shapes allow birds to efficiently obtain the nutrients they need for growth, healing, and overall health."},{"instruction":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

(CNN) -- Cristiano Ronaldo provided the perfect riposte to FIFA president Sepp Blatter after scoring a hat-trick as Real Madrid beat Sevilla 7-3 on a night when Gareth Bale grabbed his first goals at the Bernabeu.  Days after Blatter had made a bizarre impersonation of the Portuguese while saying the star spent \\"a lot of money at the hairdressers\\", the 28-year-old scored his third career hat-trick against Sevilla to go top of the scoring charts in Spain with 11 goals.  He celebrated his first goal from the penalty spot with a military salute in a mocking response to Blatter's description of him as a \\"commander\\" last week.  The absorbing victory also allowed Real to put Saturday's defeat by Barcelona behind them, not just because of the three points but also because Bale, the most expensive footballer in history, began to repay some of his fee.  Making his first start as a home player at the legendary Bernabeu, the Welshman scored twice, made another two and also managed to complete his first 90 minutes in his seventh appearance for Madrid.  Despite Bale's largely anonymous display at Camp Nou, which was blamed on a lack of match practice, Real coach Carlo Ancelotti was wholly vindicated by his decision to keep faith in the 24-year-old, who curled home a fine opener before a free-kick was deflected in as he handed Real a 2-0 lead.  On a satisfying night for the hosts, for whom substitute Xabi Alonso made his first appearance of the season after injury, Karim Benzema also grabbed a brace as Real moved up to third in the table, six points behind Barca.

Since Robinson's father was in the Navy, the family moved many times. After his father retired from the Navy, the family settled in Woodbridge, Virginia, where Robinson excelled in school and in most sports, except basketball. He was 5 feet, 9 inches tall in junior high school; he tried his hand at basketball, but soon quit. Robinson announced he would retire from basketball after the 2002-03 season.  On June 15, 2003, in the finale of Robinson's career, the Spurs won another NBA title with an 88-77 victory over the New Jersey Nets in Game 6 of the 2003 NBA Finals. Turning back the clock, Robinson scored 13 points and grabbed 17 rebounds in his final game for the Spurs. He and the year's regular season and NBA Finals MVP Tim Duncan shared Sports Illustrated magazine's 2003 Sportsmen of the Year award.  Robinson averaged 21.1 points per game, 10.7 rebounds per game, 3 blocks per game, and 2.5 assists per game over 987 games in his NBA career. Also, he is one of only a very small group of players to have scored over 20,000 career points in the NBA, as well as being one of only four players to have recorded a quadruple-double (with 34 points, 10 rebounds, 10 assists, and 10 blocks against the Detroit Pistons on February 17, 1994).  He is also one of only six players to record 70 or more points in a single game with 71 points against the Los Angeles Clippers on April 24, 1994. Only Elgin Baylor (71 points), Wilt Chamberlain (70, 72, 73 twice, 78, 100 points), David Thompson (73 points), Devin Booker (70 points), and Kobe Bryant (81 points) have scored 70 or more points in a single game.  Robinson is also noteworthy for his harmonious relationship with Tim Duncan. Sportswriter Chris Sheridan noted that it was rare for someone like Robinson to have welcomed and mentored Duncan as willingly as he did. Answer the following question by taking a quote from the article: Did he do anything else important","output":"Yes, David Robinson did several important things in his career besides being a remarkable basketball player.

Additionally, Robinson is one of only four players to have recorded a quadruple-double in an NBA game and one of only six players to record 70 or more points in a singular game.  Off court too, Robinson left a mark by demonstrating a commendable camaraderie and mentorship with his team member Tim Duncan, as was observed by Sportswriter Chris Sheridan.  As stated in the given text, \\"He and the year's regular season and NBA Finals MVP Tim Duncan shared Sports Illustrated magazine's 2003 Sportsmen of the Year award\\" and \\"Sportswriter Chris Sheridan noted that it was rare for someone like Robinson to have welcomed and mentored Duncan as willingly as he did.\\" Also noteworthy is his achievement where \\"he is one of only a very small group of players to have scored over 20,000 career points in the NBA.\\"  In summary, David Robinson's contributions to basketball and his team were significant, transcending merely his on-court performances.

Answer the following question: Read the following paragraph and extract the answer for the question: What was the last name of the person Cobain told that he should just re-cord the record and do the same thing they did last year?  After the recording sessions were completed, Nirvana sent unmastered tapes of the album to several individuals, including the president of DGC's parent company Geffen Records Ed Rosenblatt and the group's management company Gold Mountain.  When asked about the feedback he received, Cobain told Michael Azerrad, \\"The grown-ups don't like it.\\"  He said he was told his songwriting was \\"not up to par\\", the sound was \\"unlistenable\\", and that there was uncertainty that mainstream radio would welcome the sound of Albini's production.  There were few people at Geffen or Gold Mountain who wanted the band to record with Albini to begin with, and Cobain felt he was receiving an unstated message to scrap the sessions and start all over again.  Cobain was upset and said to Azerrad, \\"I should just re-record this record and do the same thing we did last year because we sold out last year—there's no reason to try and redeem ourselves as artists at this point.  I can't help myself—I'm just putting out a record I would like to listen to at home.\\"  However, a number of the group's friends liked the album, and by April 1993, Nirvana was intent on releasing In Utero as it was.  According to Cobain, \\"Of course, they want another Nevermind, but I'd rather die than do that.  This is exactly the kind of record I would buy as a fan, that I would enjoy owning.\\"The band members began to have doubts about the record's sound.  During this time, Cobain admitted, \\"The first time I played it at home, I knew there was something wrong.  The whole first week I wasn't really interested in listening to it at all, and that usually doesn't happen.  I got no emotion from it, I was just numb.\\"  The group concluded that the bass and lyrics were inaudible and approached Albini to remix the album.  The producer declined; as he recalled, \\"[Cobain] wanted to make a record that he could slam down on the table and say, 'Listen, I know this is good, and I know your concerns about it are meaningless, so go with it.'  And I don't think he felt he had that yet...

He suffers from obsessive-compulsive disorder which, paired with his misanthropy, alienates nearly everyone with whom he interacts. He avoids stepping on sidewalk cracks while walking through the city due to a superstition of bad luck, and eats breakfast at the same table in the same restaurant every day using disposable plastic utensils he brings with him due to his pathological fear of germs. He takes an interest in his waitress, Carol Connelly (Helen Hunt), the only server at the restaurant who can tolerate his behavior. One day, Melvin's apartment neighbor, a gay artist named Simon Bishop (Greg Kinnear), is assaulted and nearly killed during a robbery. Melvin is intimidated by Simon's agent, Frank Sachs (Cuba Gooding, Jr.), into caring for Simon's dog, Verdell, while Simon is hospitalized. Although he initially does not enjoy caring for the dog, Melvin becomes emotionally attached to it. He simultaneously receives more attention from Carol. When Simon is released from the hospital, Melvin is unable to cope emotionally with returning the dog. Melvin's life is further altered when Carol decides to work closer to her home in Brooklyn so she can care for her acutely asthmatic son Spence (Jesse James). Unable to adjust to another waitress, Melvin arranges through his publisher (Linda Gehringer) whose husband is a doctor (Harold Ramis) to pay for her son's considerable medical expenses as long as Carol agrees to return to work. She is overwhelmed at his generosity, and they agree there will be no physical relationship. Meanwhile, Simon's assault and rehabilitation, coupled with Verdell's preference for Melvin, causes Simon to lose his creative muse. Simon is approaching bankruptcy due to his medical bills.

Article: One of the biggest problems for people who speak too quickly is that they often blur words together in a way that can be difficult to understand. Spend some time practicing how you enunciate words, especially when you string them together in a sentence. Don't skip over any words, not even the small ones. Enunciate each syllable of every word. Tongue twisters are designed to help you work out the muscles in your mouth, and improve your own pronunciation. Try various tongue twisters to help you warm up your voice before a speech, or just to help you slow down your vocal cadence in general.  Try saying, “The lips, the teeth, the tip of the tongue” over and over. Exaggerate each syllable. Repeat the words “rubber baby buggy bumpers.” Say each word clearly. Repeat the phrase again and again. While practicing your enunciation, try stretching your vowel sounds to add length to each word. This will help you speak more slowly and more clearly. Exaggerate it at first and add a short pause between each word. Over time, this will help you learn to not link your words together so intensely while still enunciating each word clearly.

Q:Given the following passage  \\"Just as Lee explores Jem's development in coming to grips with a racist and unjust society, Scout realizes what being female means, and several female characters influence her development. Scout's primary identification with her father and older brother allows her to describe the variety and depth of female characters in the novel both as one of them and as an outsider. Scout's primary female models are Calpurnia and her neighbor Miss Maudie, both of whom are strong willed, independent, and protective. Mayella Ewell also has an influence; Scout watches her destroy an innocent man in order to hide her desire for him. The female characters who comment the most on Scout's lack of willingness to adhere to a more feminine role are also those who promote the most racist and classist points of view. For example, Mrs. Dubose chastises Scout for not wearing a dress and camisole, and indicates she is ruining the family name by not doing so, in addition to insulting Atticus' intentions to defend Tom Robinson.

As a result, there also may be fewer marine organisms for humans to consume.  Two islands were situated in different oceans. Hill island  used fossil fuels and released a lot of carbon dioxide into the atmosphere, while Coral island was very protective towards the air and the ocean.  Which island contributed more to an increase in carbon dioxide levels? A:","output":"Hill island"},{"instruction":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

Check your user's manual to find it on your car. On Fords, there are usually 3 holes under your steering wheel. The smallest hole should be in the middle and is the access hole for your ignition.  On Chevrolet brand cars, the access hole can usually be found on the top of the steering wheel.  New cars that have electronic or push ignitions don’t have lock cylinders. If you don't have an ignition access hole, you'll need to remove the bottom of your steering wheel. Your key needs to be in the ignition or you won’t be able to release the lock cylinder. Keep the key in the ignition as you continue working. Do not turn on the car. You don't have to turn the key initially. As you push the Allen key into the hole, it should disengage the locking mechanism on the lock cylinder. You’ll have to keep the Allen key pressed into the hole as you move onto the next step. The Allen key disengages the locking mechanism in the lock cylinder. You should hear 2 clicks once the ignition disengages. Your car should not start. You can now release the Allen key from the hole. Keep the key in the ignition. The ignition, or lock cylinder, should pop out after you turn it. Pull on the key to pull the lock cylinder completely out of its casing. If the ignition is sticking, wiggle it back and forth until you free it from its hole. Push your new lock cylinder into the hole and twist it towards you. The spring should engage, locking the new cylinder into place. Your new lock cylinder is now installed. You should hear it click when your ignition locks in place.

The violent ambush that killed five Dallas police officers and wounded seven more could have been a lot worse, the city's police chief says. Dallas Chief of Police David Brown told CNN Sunday that the slain gunman told police negotiators he wanted to \\"kill white people, especially white officers.\\" Bomb making materials and a journal were found at Johnson's home during a search Friday. \\"The material were such that it was large enough to have devastating effects throughout our city and our North Texas area,\\" Brown said.

Since the shooting deaths of two black men by white police officers over two days last week, protests have been held across the country. Scores of demonstrators have been arrested, with one flash point being the southern city of Baton Rouge, Louisiana, where DeRay McKesson, one of the most prominent activists linked to the police reform protest movement Black Lives Matter, live streamed his own arrest. Police defended his arrest as a matter of public safety, but demonstrators told U.S. news outlets they believe McKesson was targeted. McKesson was freed on bond Sunday afternoon after being charged with obstructing a highway. \\"I remain disappointed in the Baton Rouge police, who continue to provoke protesters for peacefully protesting. There's a lot of work to be done, with this police department specifically,'' he said. But Louisiana Governor John Bel Edwards disagreed with McKesson's assessment.

Powell contended that it was not inconsistent to want to foster cooperation even with an organization like the Indonesian military, which has a history of human rights abuses. \\"If you get young officers, expose them to a military organization that is within a democratic political institution, such as the United States, then that rubs off on them,\\" he said. In Malaysia, Powell met with Prime Minister Mahathir Mohamad, who has led the country since 1981. The Malaysian foreign minister, Syed Hamid Albar, later told local reporters that Powell had proposed that American and Malaysian officials review the idea of forming a regional training center in Malaysia to coordinate antiterrorism activities. His brief stop in Malaysia also highlighted the moral ambiguities of the effort to prevent terrorism and its emphasis on cooperation with governments that the United States has often criticized. The United States once distanced itself from Mahathir for strong-arm tactics with political rivals, and human rights groups criticize him for arresting and jailing scores of suspected militants, including some who may be linked to al-Qaida, without trial. Powell said his discussions with Mahathir \\"touched on the case\\" of his former deputy, Anwar Ibrahim, who is serving a 15-year sentence on charges of sodomy and abuse of power after trials that Powell said the United States had \\"always felt\\" were flawed.

As he tries to lay low, he forms unexpected relationships with lovable small-town residents and uncovers hidden strengths, secrets, and dreams within themselves. Plot: Smith Williams, a 25-year-old man, has been struggling in life, bouncing around from job to job, and always dreaming of something better for himself. One fateful day, he gets a winning lottery ticket from a local store. However, this being a small town, word spreads quickly of the win, and soon enough, some shady characters, including Smith's estranged and greedy brother, Max, are in pursuit of him to claim the prize. Desperate to evade those pursuing him, Smith ducks into an old-fashioned, quirky ice-cream parlor named \\"Sweet Dreams\\" to lay low. This ice-cream parlor becomes the convergence point of various character arcs and relationships, providing a haven for personal growth. As he spends time in Sweet Dreams, Smith befriends the quirky and vibrant cast of characters. There's Marge, the plucky 60-year-old owner of the parlor, who hides a painful past and an unfulfilled dream of becoming a professional dancer; Jenny, a soft-spoken 15-year-old with a passion for painting and aspirations to study in an art school in a big city; and Chris, a mid-20s amateur musician working part-time, trying to catch a break in the industry. Each of these characters is just as plagued by their fears and insecurities as Smith, and they all find camaraderie in the ice-cream parlor. During his time at the parlor, Smith sees how the different characters in the town intersect: the young girl whose father disapproves of her passion for art, the musician who lacks the confidence to go after his dreams, and Marge, the parlor's owner, whose past as a talented dancer comes to light. The film also depicts a romantic subplot between Smith and Sarah, a single mother who works at the local grocery store. While hiding in the parlor, Smith starts to see the beauty in simple things, and he creates a plan to use his lottery winnings to help out those who have helped him. He encourages Jenny to apply for an art scholarship, helps Chris to find opportunities to showcase his music to a broader audience, and convinces Marge to participate in a local dance competition. In the climax, Max and his thugs finally track down Smith at Sweet Dreams. But with the fortification of community spirit and newfound friendships, a humorous yet heartwarming showdown takes place. Smith's friends, the townspeople, confront Max, and he eventually relents, realizing the value of true relationships over money. In the end, Smith and the others reach their personal goals and chase their passions with newfound courage. Sweet Dreams becomes a symbol of hope, and its patrons grow stronger than ever, each brave enough to face life's challenges head-on. With laughter, tears, and a whole lot of ice cream, \\"A Scoop of Destiny\\" serves as a heartwarming story about the power of friendship, love, and hope amidst times of adversity."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Stalin's death in 1953 was the biggest step toward Shostakovich's rehabilitation as a creative artist, which was marked by his Tenth Symphony. It features a number of musical quotations and codes (notably the DSCH and Elmira motifs, Elmira Nazirova being a pianist and composer who had studied under Shostakovich in the year before his dismissal from the Moscow Conservatory), the meaning of which is still debated, while the savage second movement, according to Testimony, is intended as a musical portrait of Stalin. The Tenth ranks alongside the Fifth and Seventh as one of Shostakovich's most popular works. 1953 also saw a stream of premieres of the \\"desk drawer\\" works. During the forties and fifties, Shostakovich had close relationships with two of his pupils, Galina Ustvolskaya and Elmira Nazirova. In the background to all this remained Shostakovich's first, open marriage to Nina Varzar until her death in 1954. He taught Ustvolskaya from 1937 to 1947. The nature of their relationship is far from clear: Mstislav Rostropovich described it as \\"tender\\". Ustvolskaya rejected a proposal of marriage from him after Nina's death. Shostakovich's daughter, Galina, recalled her father consulting her and Maxim about the possibility of Ustvolskaya becoming their stepmother. Ustvolskaya's friend Viktor Suslin said that she had been \\"deeply disappointed\\" in Shostakovich by the time of her graduation in 1947. The relationship with Nazirova seems to have been one-sided, expressed largely through his letters to her, and can be dated to around 1953 to 1956. He married his second wife, Komsomol activist Margarita Kainova, in 1956; the couple proved ill-matched, and divorced three years later. In 1954, Shostakovich wrote the Festive Overture, opus 96; it was used as the theme music for the 1980 Summer Olympics.

However, the latter was not completed to their satisfaction, and by December 2011, Clayton admitted it would not come to fruition. The sessions with Danger Mouse instead formed the foundation of U2's next album, and they worked with him until May 2013 before enlisting the help of producers Paul Epworth, Ryan Tedder, Declan Gaffney, and Flood. The band suspended work on the album late in 2013 to contribute a new song, \\"Ordinary Love\\", to the film Mandela: Long Walk to Freedom. The track, written in honour of Nelson Mandela, won the 2014 Golden Globe Award for Best Original Song. In November 2013, U2's long-time manager Paul McGuinness stepped down from his post as part of a deal with Live Nation to acquire his management firm, Principle Management. McGuinness, who had managed the group for over 30 years, was succeeded by Guy Oseary. In February 2014, another new U2 song, the single \\"Invisible\\", debuted in a Super Bowl television advertisement and was made available in the iTunes Store at no cost to launch a partnership with Product Red and Bank of America to fight AIDS.

Rory Hughes, Ratu Tagive, Lee Jones, Mark Bennett and Peter Horne all touched down before Tyler Morgan scored a late try for the visitors. The win moves Glasgow within six points of fifth-placed Ulster. The Dragons had just shipped 54 points to Leinster so their early lead must have come as a shock to Glasgow, Angus O'Brien, their fly-half, putting them ahead with the boot, and then putting in a lovely grubber kick to the corner that put Gregor Townsend's team on the back foot. Pinned in their own 22, Glasgow couldn't escape. When the Dragons came infield Landman stretched for the line, referee Andrew Brace with the help of his TMO giving the try even though it looked like Landman had got the ball down just short. O'Brien banged over the conversion to make it an unlikely 10-0 for the visitors who came into this on the back of 12 defeats in their 16 Pro12 games. Glasgow desperately needed a four-try bonus point win to keep their already slim semi-final hopes alive and they required a whole lot more ball to get it. Soon enough, they got on top. Tim Swinson and Brian Alainu'uese carried and carried and slowly ground the Dragons down. Nick Grigg, terrific throughout, got his first just before the half hour, spinning through weak Dragons defence to score. Then he added another, a lovely solo run where he ripped through an increasingly porous Dragons. Horne converted both and Glasgow were ahead at 14-10. They suffered the loss through injury of Richie Vernon just before half-time - poor Vernon has been cursed these past years - but they kicked on regardless. Just after the restart, Hughes blasted though more soft defending to get Glasgow's third, injuring himself in the process. Glasgow's precious bonus point try came seven minutes later when the excellent Horne picked out substitute Tagive with a crossfield kick and the Australian, on his home debut, strolled over. With Horne's conversion, Glasgow were home-free at 28-10. Jones piled on the pain for the Dragons with the fifth and Bennett sped away for the sixth. The holes were opening up all over the place for Glasgow at that point and after losing their last three in the Pro 12 they basked in all the space they were given. Horne's fifth conversion from six brought it to 40-10. Horne ran in the seventh to throw another seven-points into the mix. Morgan got one back for the Dragons at the end, converted by Dorian Jones, but this was another thumping for the Welsh side - and more than a century of points conceded in two games. For Glasgow, it was a needed confidence booster for the Warriors ahead of what promises to be a hugely testing Pro 12 run-in. They have Connacht at home next, then Munster and Leinster away either side of a visit from Zebre. They finish with Edinburgh at Scotstoun. They're going to have to win most if not all of those game to make the top four. This will at least give them a lot of heart for the hard road ahead.

Roger McGuinn), and David Crosby and first released as a single on March 14, 1966 (see 1966 in music). Musically influenced by Ravi Shankar and John Coltrane, \\"Eight Miles High\\", along with its McGuinn and Crosby-penned B-side \\"Why\\", was influential in developing the musical styles of psychedelic rock, raga rock, and psychedelic pop. Accordingly, critics often cite \\"Eight Miles High\\" as being the first bona fide psychedelic rock song, as well as a classic of the counterculture era. The song was subject to a U.S. radio ban shortly after its release, following allegations published in the broadcasting trade journal the Gavin Report regarding perceived drug connotations in its lyrics. The song's use of Indian and free-form jazz influences, along with its impressionistic lyrics, were immediately influential on the emerging genre of psychedelic rock. Accordingly, some authors and music historians, including Eric V. D. Luft, Domenic Priore, and Dwight Rounds, have described \\"Eight Miles High\\" as being the first bona fide psychedelic rock song. In his book Riot On Sunset Strip: Rock 'n' Roll's Last Stand in Hollywood, Priore cites \\"Eight Miles High\\" as being the record that kicked off the psychedelic craze, explaining \\"prior to 'Eight Miles High,' there were no pop records with incessant, hypnotic basslines juxtaposed by droning, trance-induced improvisational guitar.\\"  The song was responsible for the naming of the musical subgenre raga rock, when journalist Sally Kempton, in her review of the single for The Village Voice, used the term to describe the record's experimental fusion of eastern and western music. However, although Kempton was the first person to use the term raga rock in print, she had actually borrowed the phrase from the promotional material that the Byrds' press office had supplied to accompany the \\"Eight Miles High\\" single release. In a 1968 interview for the Pop Chronicles radio documentary, McGuinn denied that the song was in fact an example of raga rock, while Crosby, speaking in 1998, dismissed the term entirely, stating \\"they kept trying to label us; every time we turned around, they came up with a new one ... it's a bunch of bullshit.\\" Nonetheless, the experimental nature of the song placed the Byrds firmly at the forefront of the burgeoning psychedelic movement, along with the Yardbirds, the Beatles, Donovan and the Rolling Stones, who were all exploring similar musical territory concurrently.  Contemporary reviews for the single were mostly positive, with Billboard magazine describing the song as a \\"Big beat rhythm rocker with soft lyric ballad vocal and off-beat instrumental backing.\\" Record World magazine also praised the song, commenting \\"It's an eerie tune with lyrics bound to hypnotize. Will climb heights.\\" In the UK, Music Echo described the song as \\"wild and oriental but still beaty\\". The publication also suggested that with the release of \\"Eight Miles High\\" the Byrds had jumped ahead of the Beatles in terms of creativity, stating \\"[By] getting their single out now they've beaten the Beatles to the punch, for Paul [McCartney] admitted recently that the Liverpool foursome are working on a similar sound for their new album and single.\\" In recent years, Richie Unterberger, writing for the Allmusic website, has described \\"Eight Miles High\\" as \\"one of the greatest singles of the '60s.\\"  In 1999, the song was inducted into the Grammy Hall of Fame, an honor reserved for \\"recordings of lasting qualitative or historical significance that are at least 25 years old.\\" In 2004, Rolling Stone magazine ranked \\"Eight Miles High\\" at number 151 on their list of The 500 Greatest Songs of All Time and in March 2005, Q magazine placed the song at number 50 on their list of the 100 Greatest Guitar Tracks.

The fertilizer ends up in bodies of water, from ponds to oceans. Nitrogen is a fertilizer in the water. Since there is a lot of nitrogen, it causes algae to grow out of control. Pictured below is a pond covered with algae ( Figure below ). Algae use up carbon dioxide in the water. After the algae die, decomposers break down the dead tissue. The decomposers use up all the oxygen in the water. This creates a dead zone. A dead zone is an area in a body of water where nothing grows because there is too little oxygen. There is a large dead zone in the Gulf of Mexico ( Figure below ). The U.S. states outlined on the map have rivers that drain into the Gulf of Mexico. The rivers drain vast agricultural lands. The water carries fertilizer from these areas into the Gulf.  Bobby and Kenny are two prolific farmers from Arkansas who have ponds located down stream from their farm sites. Bobby recently received a large order of potatoes from a neighboring city. Because of this order, Bobby has dramatically increased the amount of fertilizer he is using on his farm. Kenny mainly grows tomatoes, which are not in season right now, so his use of fertilizer is currently low. Over the past month there has been a large amount of rain falling on both Bobby and Kenny's farms.  Who will cause more carbon dioxide to be used in the ponds near their farm? Answer:","output":"Given the provided information about Bobby and Kenny's farms and their respective fertilizer usage, it is clear that Bobby will cause more carbon dioxide to be used in the ponds near their farm. As mentioned, Bobby recently received a large order for potatoes from a neighboring city and has subsequently increased the amount of fertilizer used on his farm. Rain dissolves the fertilizer in the soil, enabling it to be carried away through runoff into nearby bodies of water, such as the ponds downstream from Bobby's farm. The increased amount of fertilizer, especially nitrogen, that enters the ponds promotes the rapid and uncontrollable growth of algae, known as algal blooms. During this process, the algae consume large amounts of carbon dioxide from the water to perform photosynthesis, effectively lowering the levels of carbon dioxide in the ponds.  Conversely, Kenny's fertilizer usage is currently low, as his primary crop, tomatoes, is not in season. The reduced fertilizer application on Kenny's farm would result in less runoff of nitrogenous compounds into the ponds near his farm, thus contributing to a less significant impact on algal growth and carbon dioxide consumption. After the algae in Bobby's pond die, decomposers break down their dead tissue and consume the oxygen in the water in the process. This leads to the creation of a dead zone, an area in a body of water where nothing grows due to the lack of oxygen. The larger concentration of decomposers and higher amount of decaying algae in Bobby's pond results in a significant increase in carbon dioxide consumption. In conclusion, Bobby's increase in fertilizer usage, along with the recent heavy rainfall, will result in a much higher consumption of carbon dioxide in the ponds near his farm when compared to Kenny and his limited fertilizer use. This is primarily due to the increased growth of algae caused by an influx of nitrogen-rich fertilizer runoff and the subsequent degradation of algae by decomposers, which consume both available oxygen and carbon dioxide in the process."},{"instruction":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

The set-up is completely bizarre for a show where the typical divisive practices of club-owners bottleneck the 'kiddie section' dead center in front of the stage, which is the 'no-fly zone' for alcohol.    This arrangement sets up the now-famous 'awkward 20 foot gap' between showpiece and fully-anticipatory-audience who is inebriated enough to dance and cheer instead of the tweener crowd in full cross-armed bashful gawkiness.  The drinking audience is so colossally detached from the musical climate of the show that it is truly insignificant whether or not they actually attended.    I went here with Graham C and Natalie G to see Voxtrot and Au Revoir Simone and all of  this foolishness climaxed when the three bandmates from ARS had to break the 21 and under barrier just to show headliners Voxtrot some love by peacocking around the dance floor in the general vicinity of the band.  No one else was willing to give up their beers to participate.  There is generally no alternative options when presented with the venue of  choice where a band you wanna hear is playing  ... but if its a band you only 'kinda wanna hear', its not really worth the hassle or boredom.  There's really no excuse for a club owner to have a crummy live music venue.

Firstly, the reviewer discusses the unusual set-up of the venue, with the underaged audience placed directly in front of the stage, while the alcohol-consuming audience members are forced to remain a considerable distance away. This arrangement is criticized for creating an 'awkward 20-foot gap' between the performers and the more enthusiastic, inebriated fans who are more likely to dance and cheer. They indicate that this structure hinders the overall atmosphere of the concert and leads to a disconnect between the performers and the audience. Next, the reviewer uses a specific experience to highlight this point, narrating a situation where the three bandmates of Au Revoir Simone had to break through the age barrier in order to support the headliners, Voxtrot, due to the rest of the audience remaining separate and unwilling to relinquish their drinks. This anecdote emphasizes the negative sentiment by showcasing the absurdity of the venue set-up and the implications it has on the show experience. Moreover, the reviewer implies that the disappointing experience may not be worth the effort when attending a concert of a band they only 'kinda wanna hear,' further solidifying the negative sentiment in the review. The closing statement reinforces this negativity, criticizing the club owner for having a poorly designed live music venue and implying that there is no excuse for such shortcomings. Overall, the sentiment of this review is characterized by dissatisfaction, frustration, and disappointment in the handling of the venue, live music experience, and atmosphere, leading the reviewer to suggest that the club is not worth attending for a band one is only somewhat interested in."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Answer based on context: Coming off their loss to the Colts, the Patriots returned home to face the Jets, who had lost six of their last eight games after defeating the Patriots in Week 2. After an exchange of punts to begin the game, the Patriots moved into Jets territory on their second drive with a 25-yard catch by Faulk. Two plays later, Edelman fumbled a direct snap as he went in motion, but recovered his fumble, setting up a 4th-and-1. Maroney then had a 2-yard run to convert, but on the next play fumbled; this time the Jets recovered it at their own 34-yard line. Four plays later, Sanchez was intercepted by Bodden at the Patriots' 47-yard line; Bodden returned the interception 53 yards for a touchdown, giving the Patriots a 7-0 lead. The Jets went three-and-out on their ensuing possession. The Patriots then began a 9-play, 76-yard drive, ending in a 4-yard touchdown pass from Brady to Moss, extending the Patriots lead to 14-0 on the final play of the first quarter. After another Jets punt, from their end zone after a Banta-Cain sack, the Patriots began their next drive from their own 41-yard line. Seven plays later, Maroney ran in from two yards out to give the Patriots a 21-0 lead. Following a 44-yard kickoff return by Dwight Lowery, the Jets again turned the ball over, with Sanchez throwing his second interception of the game to Bodden, who returned it seven yards to the Patriots' 48-yard line. The Patriots' next drive again reached the red zone, but this time the Patriots could not score a touchdown and were forced to settle for a 26-yard Gostkowski field goal, giving the Patriots a 24-0 lead. Another Jets punt gave the Patriots the ball with just over two minutes remaining. With just under a minute left in the half, Hanson's punt attempt was blocked by Eric Smith and returned four yards for a touchdown by the Jets' Brad Smith. With 45 seconds remaining, the Patriots quickly advanced downfield, but a 40-yard Gostkowski field goal attempt with 15 seconds left in the half fell wide right, keeping the Patriots' lead at 24-7 going into halftime. With possession at the start of the second half due to their deferral of the opening coin toss, the Jets moved 80 yards on 11 plays, scoring on a 29-yard pass from Sanchez to Cotchery. With a 10-point lead, the Patriots responded with an 11-play drive that reached the Jets' 49-yard line before sack eventually forced a punt. The Jets reached midfield on their next possession before punting as well, with Jets punter Steve Weatherford pinning the Patriots at their own 8-yard line. This forced another Patriots punt, on the first play of the fourth quarter, but the Patriots received the ball right back after Sanchez threw his third interception of the day, again to Bodden, at the Patriots' 26-yard line. The Patriots could not capitalize on the turnover though, and were again forced to punt. Three plays later, Sanchez threw his fourth interception of the game, this time to Meriweather, who returned it four yards to the Jets' 25-yard line. This set up an 8-play, 25-yard Patriots drive that ended in a 1-yard Maroney touchdown run, extending the Patriots' lead to 31-14. The Jets responded with a 37-yard kickoff return by David Clowney followed by a drive to the Patriots' 24-yard line. On a 1st-and-10, Sanchez was strip-sacked by Banta-Cain; the fumble was recovered by Burgess at the Patriots' 29-yard line. With 3:24 left in the game, the Patriots ran the clock down to 25 seconds before punting, giving the Jets the ball to end the game. With the 31-14 win, the Patriots improved their record to 7-3, while the Jets dropped to 4-6. Statistically, Welker had 15 catches for 192 yards on the game, second most in team history, trailing only Troy Brown's 16 receptions in an overtime game on September 22, 2002.

You will be given a task. You must generate a detailed and long answer. Choose the next sentence for this paragraph. Washington (CNN) -- Former Congresswoman Gabby Giffords is urging Arizona voters to supporter her successor, Rep. Ron Barber, who is locked in a tough race for re-election, with a personal video appeal. Giffords, who has been recovering since being seriously wounded in a 2011 shooting, speaks clearly into the camera as she says, \\"We expect our leaders to fight for us, not the special interests. Ron Barber is independent, he's courageous, and most of all he's Arizona through and through.\\" This ad from the political action committee founded by Giffords -- Americans for Responsible Solutions -- follows some controversy about a previous ad from the same group attacking Barber's opponent, Republican Martha McSally.  OPTIONS: - Americans for Responsible Solutions released a statement saying: \\"No organization or person -- no matter which party they say they represent -- should think they can come to Southern Arizona and pretend to speak for me ... - Arizona released a statement saying: \\"No organization or person -- no matter which party they say they represent -- should think they can come to Southern Arizona and pretend to speak for me ... - Barber released a statement saying: \\"No organization or person -- no matter which party they say they represent -- should think they can come to Southern Arizona and pretend to speak for me ... - CNN released a statement saying: \\"No organization or person -- no matter which party they say they represent -- should think they can come to Southern Arizona and pretend to speak for me ... - Gabby Giffords released a statement saying: \\"No organization or person -- no matter which party they say they represent -- should think they can come to Southern Arizona and pretend to speak for me ... - Giffords released a statement saying: \\"No organization or person -- no matter which party they say they represent -- should think they can come to Southern Arizona and pretend to speak for me ... - Martha McSally released a statement saying: \\"No organization or person -- no matter which party they say they represent -- should think they can come to Southern Arizona and pretend to speak for me ... - Republican released a statement saying: \\"No organization or person -- no matter which party they say they represent -- should think they can come to Southern Arizona and pretend to speak for me ... - Ron Barber released a statement saying: \\"No organization or person -- no matter which party they say they represent -- should think they can come to Southern Arizona and pretend to speak for me ... - Washington released a statement saying: \\"No organization or person -- no matter which party they say they represent -- should think they can come to Southern Arizona and pretend to speak for me ...","output":"Given the context of the paragraph, the most relevant next sentence would be one associated with either the person commenting on the situation lately or the organization involved in the controversy.  Since Gabby Giffords is the focus of the paragraph and was also involved in creating the controversial ad for Ron Barber, an option mentioning her reaction would add more information on her stance and further context to the story. Also, the existence of a statement would imply her continued involvement and interest in the ongoing political scenario. On the other hand, a comment from the organization \\"Americans for Responsible Solutions,\\" which aired the ad, would also provide a direct response from the group involved in the ongoing controversy. Given the interest in Gabby Giffords' personal appeal and involvement, a statement from her could offer a more potent overall addition to the story. Thus, the best option would be: - Giffords released a statement saying: \\"No organization or person -- no matter which party they say they represent -- should think they can come to Southern Arizona and pretend to speak for me... This sentence would escalate the situation by showing Giffords' defense against any allegation of her voice or cause being hijacked by political factions, reinforcing her tightly-knit connection to Arizona and the sentiment of protecting her and her successor's political intent and image from misrepresentation."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Article: At age 11, Ghulam was married off to 40-year-old Jaiz in a rural Afghan village, making her only one of more than 10 million young girls who are being forced to wed men old enough to be their fathers of grandfather every year. In an effort to start a global conversation about the devastating effects of early marriages, which are currently practiced in more than 50 developing countries, the United Nations designed October 11 as International Day of the Girl Child this year. Although child marriage is against the law in many countries, and international treaties forbid the practice, it is estimated that about 51 million girls below age 18 are currently married, often under the cover of darkness and in secret. In Afghanistan alone, it is believed that approximately 57 percent of girls wed before the legal age of 16. Various factors drive parents of child bridges to marry off their daughters, from the community's pressure to confirm to age-old cultural customs to economic considerations. In poor, developing nations, it is not uncommon for families to settle debts by offering their daughters as payment. Experts agree that early marriage denies the girl education and robs them of their childhood because most young wives, burdened by grownup responsibilities, do not get a chance to interact with their peers or carry on friendships outside the household. In many cases, the girls are lorded over by their husbands and in-laws, leaving them vulnerable  to domestic violence as well as physical, sexual and verbal abuse. Underage wives who are lucky enough to escape from their husbands end up living in poverty, or worse. Most girls who enter early marriages are expected to get pregnant right away, which often leads to tragedy for both the mothers, who are still children themselves, and their babies. Unless international organizations take steps to reverse the troubling trend, it is estimated that over the next decade, 100 million more girls--or about 25,000 girls a day ---will marry before they turn 18.

This remarkable film, directed by Frank Darabont and adapted from Stephen King's novella, \\"Rita Hayworth and Shawshank Redemption,\\" elevates the art of storytelling as it effortlessly weaves the characters' lives together, emphasizing the power of camaraderie and human connection. The story centers around Andy Dufresne (Tim Robbins), a successful young banker who is wrongly accused of murdering his wife and her lover. He is sentenced to two consecutive life terms at Shawshank State Prison, a brutal institution known for its harsh conditions and corruption. Inside those foreboding walls, Andy encounters a variety of characters, including the sadistic Warden Norton (Bob Gunton), who rules with an iron fist, and Red (Morgan Freeman), a cunning, seasoned inmate who becomes his closest friend and confidant. Darabont's direction effortlessly captures the nuanced emotions of the characters and the grim atmosphere of Shawshank without the need for excessive dialogue. His masterful use of visual storytelling and pacing allows the audience to immerse themselves in the story, feeling every victory alongside the characters and sharing their despair when hope seems lost. Tim Robbins delivers a mesmerizing performance as Andy Dufresne, a man whose inner resilience separates him from other prisoners. With a quiet, understated presence, Robbins expertly portrays a man who refuses to give up on his dreams despite the desolate environment he finds himself in. Equally extraordinary is Morgan Freeman, whose portrayal of Red breathes life into an already fascinating character. Freeman's magnetic performance, combined with Robbins' stoic portrayal, creates an indelible bond that solidifies their friendship as one of the most iconic in cinematic history. The film's real strength lies in its exploration of themes such as friendship, hope, and the human soul's indomitable spirit. \\"The Shawshank Redemption\\" delves into an emotional journey and shows the beauty of resilience in the face of adversity. Scenes like Andy playing Mozart over the prison loudspeakers or the unveiling of the carefully hidden project in the prison library are testaments to the fact that even in the darkest of places, the human spirit can triumph. One must also take a moment to admire the stunning cinematography by Roger Deakins. His masterful use of light, shadow, and color evoke the somber, gloomy mood of the prison while simultaneously highlighting the characters' internal struggles. Moreover, Thomas Newman's evocative and uplifting score contributes to the film's tonal depth, further enriching the emotional experience for the viewer. In conclusion, \\"The Shawshank Redemption\\" is an unforgettable cinematic masterpiece that serves as an invaluable testament to the power of hope, friendship, and the human spirit. With its compelling story, exceptional performances, and thought-provoking themes, this classic film stands the test of time and will continue to captivate and inspire generations of audiences."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant. You will be given a task. You must generate a detailed and long answer. Mechanical energy is a combination of the energy of motion or position. This type of energy describes objects that are moving or could move. A moving ball can have energy from motion. An arrow can also have the energy of motion. Both are types of mechanical energy. Can you think of some other examples? Where does the energy of motion come from? It comes from the energy created by position. This energy is stored energy. This means it is not moving yet, but it has the potential to move. How can you store energy? The arrow gains energy from the drawn bow. As the arrow is released, the bow releases its stored energy and puts the arrow into motion. Can you think of some other ways to store energy using position?  After reading the above, is \\"Potential energy\\" the correct answer to the question \\"What type of energy do a moving arrow or ball have?\\"? Options are: * no. * yes.","output":"No, the correct answer to the question \\"What type of energy do a moving arrow or ball have?\\" is not \\"Potential energy.\\" When a moving arrow or ball is considered, the energy involved in their motion is called \\"Kinetic energy.\\" Potential energy, on the other hand, refers to the stored energy in an object based on its position or condition. Let's consider some additional examples of mechanical energy: 1. A roller coaster: At the top of the track, the roller coaster has maximum potential energy because of its elevated position. As it starts to move downwards, this potential energy gets converted into kinetic energy. At the bottom of the track, the roller coaster has maximum kinetic energy due to its high speed, while the potential energy becomes minimal. 2. A stretched rubber band: A rubber band stretched between your fingers is an example of stored energy based on position. This energy is potential energy because it has not yet been converted into motion. When you release the rubber band, the potential energy is converted into kinetic energy as the rubber band returns to its original shape and moves rapidly. 3. A pendulum: When a pendulum is at its highest point, it possesses potential energy due to its elevated position. As it starts to swing back downwards, the potential energy is converted into kinetic energy. As it reaches the lowest point of its swing, the pendulum has maximum kinetic energy and its potential energy is minimal. This interconversion continues as the pendulum oscillates back and forth. In summary, mechanical energy comprises both potential energy and kinetic energy. The potential energy of an object is based on its position or condition while the kinetic energy is associated with its motion. In the examples of a moving arrow or a ball, the energy in motion is kinetic energy, not potential energy."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant. User will you give you a task.

He popularized the classification of birds on the basis of the quinarian system.  - Philosophy (from Greek , \\"philosophia\\", literally \\"love of wisdom\\") is the study of general and fundamental problems concerning matters such as existence, knowledge, values, reason, mind, and language. The term was probably coined by Pythagoras (c. 570  c. 495 BC). Philosophical methods include questioning, critical discussion, rational argument and systematic presentation. Classic philosophical questions include: Is it possible to know anything and to prove it? What is most real? However, philosophers might also pose more practical and concrete questions such as: Is there a best way to live? Is it better to be just or unjust (if one can get away with it)? Do humans have free will?  - Natural philosophy or philosophy of nature (from Latin \\"philosophia naturalis\\") was the philosophical study of nature and the physical universe that was dominant before the development of modern science. It is considered to be the precursor of natural science.  - The Quinarian system was a method of zoological classification which had a brief period of popularity in the mid 19th century, especially among British naturalists. It was largely developed by the entomologist William Sharp MacLeay in 1819. The system was further promoted in the works of Nicholas Aylward Vigors, William John Swainson and Johann Jakob Kaup. Swainson's work on ornithology gave wide publicity to the idea.

He was born at Darmstadt. After studying at Göttingen and Heidelberg he spent two years at Leiden, where his attention was specially devoted to the amphibians and fishes. He then returned to Darmstadt as an assistant in the grand ducal museum, of which in 1840 he became inspector. In 1829 he published \\"Skizze zur Entwickelungsgeschichte der europäischen Thierwelt\\", in which he regarded the animal world as developed from lower to higher forms, from the amphibians through the birds to the beasts of prey; but subsequently he repudiated this work as a youthful indiscretion, and on the publication of Darwin's \\"Origin of Species\\" he declared himself against its doctrines. The extensive fossil deposits in the neighbourhood of Darmstadt gave him ample opportunities for palaeontological inquiries, and he gained considerable reputation by his \\"Beiträge zur näheren Kenntniss der urweltlichen Säugethiere\\" (18551862).

A serial killer named Karl Hochman is known as \\"The Address Book Killer\\" due to his habit of stealing address books and choosing his victims from them. While he is working at a computer store, he obtains Terry Munroe's (Karen Allen) address book after another employee, who is demonstrating a scanner, copies a page of her address book into the computer. On a rainy night while heading home, Karl collides into a truck, which causes his car to go off the road and swerve down a trail in a cemetery as he laughs. In the emergency room he is put into an MRI machine. A surge from an electrical storm manages to transfer his soul into a computer. Now as a network-based entity, Karl continues to plot his killing spree using various objects connected to the electrical grid and computer networks. Karl opens the scanned page from Terry's address book and begins to kill all the names he finds there. Her co-worker, Frank Mallory, becomes the first victim when his microwave oven explodes. Another friend, Elliot Kastner, gets burned to death when a hand dryer turns into a flamethrower. Terry hires a babysitter, Carol Maibaum, to look after her son Josh.

Please answer the following question: The collaborative process between me and Claire Bridge has been good so far. Upon finding out her email address we had a brief email exchange culminating in me sending her a list of potential questions for the interview. Claire quite liked a lot of the questions, but overall there were too many, so we proceeded to reduce the number of questions to six main questions. These questions would then form the basis of the artist portrait, with an attempt to limit answers to no more than a minute, so little had to be cut for the final edit. The six questions we arrived at are as follows: How would you define creativity? What does it mean to you to be an artist? Do you feel a painting or piece of art can house an energy/a feeling from the original artist? Do you feel that your own works house this energy? Change and transformation are recurrent themes in your work. What are you exploring and why do these fascinate you? And recently we saw a change in your medium too, incorporating video works and photography. You seem to draw on many influences in your work, from quantum physics, astrophysics, to environmental ecology, psychology, philosophy and metaphysics. With titles like “Dark Matter”, “Touching Infinity”, “We are made of Stars”, “Rising tides” and “A drop in the ocean” or “Alchemy”. Can you tell us something more about the convergence of these ideas and influences? What continues to motivate and inspire you as an artist? We both felt these questions addressed the initial topic of exploring creativity, explored why Claire became an artist, gives insight into Claire’s work and practise and looks toward the future of Claire’s practice.

Sanjay rescues Abhi, but is enraged when his friends stop him from assaulting the kidnapper by questioning his authority to take law into his hands.

They could quickly come back should we see the dialogue momentum losing speed or North Korea not living up to its denuclearization commitment,” said Foreign Minister Kang. During a press briefing in Seoul, the foreign minister said she was in in close communication with U.S. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo about the drills directly following the Singapore summit. And while the announcement canceling the exercises came suddenly, Kang said, South Korea was also considering this option to keep diplomatic momentum moving forward following the U.S.-North Korea summit where Kim reaffirmed his commitment to the “complete denuclearization” of North Korea. The now cancelled Ulchi Freedom Guardian exercises normally held in August usually bring in 3,000 more American troops from abroad and involve 50,000 South Korean troops. No decision has yet been made whether the other large-scale joint exercise held in the spring would be suspended as well. At the Singapore summit Trump said he would cancel the “war games” that he said were both enormously expensive and “provocative,” as an act of good faith and in response to North Korea’s commitment to denuclearization, its continued suspension of nuclear and missile teats, and the recent closing of its nuclear testing site. North Korea has long called for the end of these joint military exercises that it says are offensive “rehearsals for war.” In the past U.S. officials refused to suspend the joint drills, that they defended as defensive in nature...

Gruveyman2 (comment below)you are a complete idiot...blinded by ignorance by the very city you have allegiance to. Its that whiny arrogance, that you are ironically claiming the film exudes about SF, that makes you seem like such the typical LA A**hole! The only reason you felt the film was so self congratulatory about SF is because you are jealous. Of course you don't know it because you are so LA jaded. First of all the film was completely factual about a beautiful city; what has been filmed there and what has been filmed by some of its more famous locals. It says nothing bad about LA; and these accomplished directors choose to live in a beautiful city over LA. They recognize that they went to film school in LA and are obviously proud of that fact. They recognize that SF is close to LA which is a benefit. The only negative thing that was said that relates to LA, was about the studio executives. The same studio executives that hated these guys movies when they first saw them, but then those same movies went on to be huge world-wide grossing films. So why wouldn't they have animosity towards the studio executive establishment and studio system? These are the only people they are trying to \\"disassociate from\\" and for good reasons! Don't be so sensitive! How can you say that Francis Ford Coppola is the \\"so called\\" San Francisco director? How is he not to be considered that? And who directed The Godfather? Coppola did. It was his vision that told the story on the screen that won it a best picture award. So what who gave him the job? He admits it in the documentary that he didn't even want to do the movie....so what's your point? And so what if Sophia wants to live in LA? And that proves your point how? And tell me how they are not truly independent when they are funding a lot of their own movies. Movies that are now considered classics. And, when they made movies from studio funding, one, it was LA that came to them and said we want you to make these pictures and two, they used the money that they made from doing these pictures to fund their own. They said exactly that in the film. \\"Your bitchy and self congratulatory whining would take on an air of greater self respect and credence if you never set foot on the ground you so claim to be superior to in this film.\\" How the hell can \\"bitchy-ness\\" and \\"self-congratulation\\" suddenly have an \\"air\\" of self respect and credence....if they never go to LA again? What a stupid and senseless comment! You inserted some big words in there....and just don't know how to use them! And, by the way, they never claimed nor implied they were superior to LA! So what if they are giving a guy from New York an award in LA....again what the hell is your point? So if they go to LA or New York they are hypocrites by simply preferring to live in SF? You make no sense. San Francisco is proud of itself and its heritage and the people who make it what it is today. This film just focused on one aspect...film-making. For you to take the time and type up such nasty comments about the city (not the movie! But the city and its people) only proves what it is we Northern Californians hate about people from LA!

The answer is:","output":"Citrus and Boltonia are not in the same family, as they belong to distinct plant families with varying characteristics, growth habits, and regions of origin. To deeply comprehend these differences, it is essential to investigate the primary features of both the Citrus and Boltonia plants, along with the unique characteristics of their respective families. Citrus is a category of fruit-bearing flowering plants that belong to the Rutaceae family. The Rutaceae family comprises approximately 160 genera and 2,000 species of evergreen trees and shrubs. These plants are typically found in warm temperate and tropical regions, including Southeast Asia, Australasia, and certain parts of America and Africa. The Citrus genus includes several well-known and economically important fruits, such as oranges, lemons, limes, grapefruits, and mandarins. The Rutaceae family's unique features include aromatic, glabrous, or glandular-dotted leaves, coupled with solitary or clustered, generally bisexual flowers. The fruits produced within this family are notably fleshy and contain many seeds. The Rutaceae family characteristically exhibits a rich fragrance due to the presence of volatile oils and compounds in the leaves, fruits, and other plant parts. It is vital to note that some members of the Rutaceae family have sensitive plant tissues, while others possess hairs that excrete oil when rubbed. On the other hand, Boltonia is a genus comprised of perennial plants belonging to the Asteraceae family. The Asteraceae family, also known as the sunflower or daisy family, is well-known for its enormous diversity—it consists of around 1,600 genera and more than 23,000 species. The Asteraceae family primarily consists of annual, biennial, or perennial herbs, along with shrubs and trees, spanning a wide variety of geographical locations. This family of plants is predominantly found in regions of North America, South America, and Europe, with some species thriving across Asia and Africa. Asteraceae plants are defined by their composite flower heads, combining many small flowers or florets onto a shared receptacle. This characteristic inflorescence results in the formation of seemingly large flowers. Boltonia, in particular, comprises several species with robust, erect-growing perennials, bearing showy flowers, largely in shades of white and light pink. A distinct characteristic of the Asteraceae family is the production of small, dry, and single-seeded fruits called achenes. In conclusion, Citrus and Boltonia are not in the same family. Citrus belongs to the family Rutaceae, exhibiting features such as aromatic leaves and fleshy fruits, and primarily thrives in warm temperate and tropical areas. Conversely, Boltonia is part of the Asteraceae family, recognized for its composite flower heads and herbaceous growth, with a geographical distribution largely spanning temperate climates. These fundamental differences between their families highlight the dissimilarities between Citrus and Boltonia plants."},{"instruction":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

Write an article that answers the following question: What happened first, the Battle of Saule or the St. George's Night Uprising?","output":"Title: The Battle of Saule and St. George's Night Uprising: Which One Came First? Hello, little friends! Today, we are going to learn about two important events in history. The first one is called the Battle of Saule, and the second one is called the St. George's Night Uprising. You may be wondering which one of these happened first. So, let's find out together! Imagine a big, beautiful tree. Its branches are covered with green leaves and colorful flowers. Each of these represents an event in history. If you look closely, you will see that some leaves are nearer to the tree's trunk. These are the older events that happened longer ago. The leaves that are farther away from the trunk are newer events that happened more recently. To learn which event happened first, we need to find out which one is closer to the trunk. In our case, the Battle of Saule is closer to the tree's trunk. It took place in the year 1236. Once upon a time, there were brave knights called the Teutonic Knights. They wanted to control the beautiful land called Lithuania. The people living there did not like this and fought back. That's how the Battle of Saule started. On one warm and sunny day, the Lithuanian army and the Teutonic Knights fought fiercely. The Lithuanians had a secret weapon: their strong bond and belief in their leader. Together, they defeated the Teutonic Knights. This battle was very important because it helped the Lithuanians stay independent and strong for many more years. Now, let's move to the St. George's Night Uprising. This is another leaf on our history tree, but it's a bit farther away from the trunk. It happened in the year 1343. This time, we go to a land called Estonia. The people in Estonia were not happy because some foreign rulers called the Teutonic Order and the Danish king were telling them what to do. They wanted to have freedom to live their lives the way they wanted. One evening, which was called St. George's Night, the people of Estonia decided to fight back. They started a big rebellion against the foreign rulers. Sadly, their fight was not successful, and the rebellion was stopped after a few years. Now that we know about these two events, we can tell that the Battle of Saule happened first because it was closer to the tree's trunk. It took place in 1236, which was a long, long time ago - 107 years before the St. George's Night Uprising in 1343. So, little friends, now you know the answer. The Battle of Saule happened before the St. George's Night Uprising. History can be like a giant tree with many exciting stories to tell. Each story is like a leaf that we can learn from and understand more about the world we live in."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant. You will be given a task.

Context: SEOUL — The recent U.S. missile strikes against Syria could increase pressure on North Korea to give up its nuclear weapons, or reinforce in Pyongyang the need for nuclear deterrence. The United States, France and Britain fired 105 missiles at three Syrian chemical weapons facilities on Saturday, in response to an alleged Syrian chemical weapons attack in the city of Douma that killed at least 40 people and wounded or sickened hundreds of others. The Syrian government has repeatedly denied any use of banned weapons. The combined military strike on Syria comes as the administration of U.S. President Donald Trump and the government of North Korean leader Kim Jong Un are preparing for an expected summit in late May or early June to discuss dismantling the North’s nuclear program in exchange for security guarantees. Trump’s willingness to use force against Syria can be seen to reinforce his “maximum pressure” campaign message, that in addition to imposing tough sanctions banning most North Korean exports, the U.S. would take military action, if necessary, to force Kim to terminate his nuclear program and end the continued development of a nuclear armed intercontinental ballistic missile that can reach the U.S. mainland. Calling the U.S. attack on Syria “a warning for Pyongyang,” the South Korean newspaper the Korea Joongang Daily, in an editorial on Monday said, “If Kim wants to be free from the fear of a potential raid, then he must be willing to denuclearize.” From this perspective the U.S. show of force in Syria will increase pressure on the leadership in North Korea to offer meaningful nuclear concessions at the Trump-Kim summit. “Unless it abandons at least part of its nuclear and missile capabilities then the Trump administration will not be satisfied,” said Bong Young-shik, a political analyst with the Yonsei University Institute for North Korean Studies in Seoul However the U.S. military strike on Syria could also reinforce concerns in North Korea that giving up its nuclear deterrent would make the...

Please write a short summary for the following article: NBC buys rights to ‘Harry Potter,’ ‘Fantastic Beasts’ franchises NEW YORK — Comcast’s NBCUniversal has acquired the rights to J.K. Rowling’s ‘‘Harry Potter’’ and ‘‘Fantastic Beasts’’ franchises from Warner Bros. in a move that could bolster ratings at its cable networks and attendance at its theme parks. The seven-year deal, which begins in July 2018, will make all eight ‘‘Harry Potter’’ films and the forthcoming ‘‘Fantastic Beasts’’ movies available on NBC’s portfolio of cable networks, which include USA and Syfy, according to a company statement Monday. It also lets NBC’s theme parks host fan events, movie screenings, and promotional activities tied to both franchises. Walt Disney Co.’s Freeform, formerly called ABC Family, currently has the rights to the Potter films. NBC will gain the rights to show the movies in an exclusive window. The ‘‘Fantastic Beasts’’ films will debut first on HBO and then be exclusive to NBC’s cable networks. The deal between NBCUniversal and Time Warner Inc.’s Warner Bros. is valued at about 200 million, though it could increase based on the success of the ‘‘Fantastic Beasts’’ films, according to a person familiar with the matter, who asked not to be identified discussing private deal terms. The movie ‘‘Fantastic Beasts and Where to Find Them,’’ the first in a trilogy of Potter spinoffs, will debut in November and is projected to make more than 200 million at the box office, according to Bloomberg Intelligence. Acquiring the Harry Potter films could lift viewership at USA and Syfy, which has been down this season. NBC’s Universal Studios Hollywood recently launched a new attraction called ‘‘The Wizarding World of Harry Potter.’’ It features a giant castle, magic wand shops, and a ride that simulates flying on a broomstick, as well as selling ‘‘Harry Potter’’ merchandise. The new attraction has lifted attendance and per-capita spending at the park, Comcast chief financial officer Mike Cavanagh said during a recent earnings call. The deal was first reported by the Wall Street Journal.","output":"Comcast’s NBCUniversal has acquired the rights to J.K. Rowling’s ‘‘Harry Potter’’ and ‘‘Fantastic Beasts’’ franchises from Warner Bros. in a deal worth approximately 200m. The agreement, which begins next summer, will permit all eight ‘‘Harry Potter’’ films and all the planned ‘‘Fantastic Beasts’’ movies to be shown on NBC’s portfolio of cable networks. NBC’s theme parks will also have permission to host events and promotional activities in relation to both franchises. The move has the potential to enhance ratings at the company's cable networks and boost attendance at its parks."},{"instruction":"In this task, you are given a context tweet and an answer.

A: Answer:","output":"The length and thickness of DNA chromosomes are determined by multiple factors, mainly the DNA content (base pairs), overall structure, and compaction. 1. DNA content (base pairs): The length of a chromosome depends on the number of base pairs (A-T and C-G pairs) in the DNA molecule. The more base pairs a DNA molecule has, the longer the chromosome will be. In humans, for instance, chromosomes vary in size and can have millions to hundreds of millions of base pairs. 2. Overall structure: Chromosomes are complex structures composed of DNA and various proteins, mainly histones. The DNA is wrapped around the histone proteins to form nucleosomes, with each nucleosome consisting of approximately 146 base pairs of the DNA helix. The string of nucleosomes is further condensed to form the chromatin fiber, which in turn coils and loops, eventually leading to the formation of a chromosome. 3. Compaction: The thickness of a chromosome is determined by the degree of compaction, also known as the 'packing ratio.' When DNA is coiled around histones and subsequently compacted, the linear length of the DNA molecule is significantly reduced, leading to a thicker chromosome. The packing ratio can vary, with higher order structures allowing greater compaction and, consequently, thicker chromosomes. Different levels of compaction occur during different stages of the cell cycle. For example, chromosomes are more compact during cell division, resulting in thicker and more easily distinguishable structures. In summary, the length and thickness of a DNA chromosome depend on the number of base pairs in the DNA molecule, its structure, and the degree of compaction. These factors are essential in determining both the size and shape of chromosomes, which in turn play crucial roles in the proper function and division of cells."},{"instruction":"Given the task definition and input, reply with output.

Justify was a chestnut colt, born on March 28, 2015. He was sired by Scat Daddy and was out of the mare Stage Magic, making him a descendant of legendary racehorses like Secretariat, Seattle Slew, and Northern Dancer. Justify was trained by Hall of Fame trainer Bob Baffert and was primarily ridden by jockey Mike Smith. Justify's Triple Crown journey started with the Kentucky Derby, held at Churchill Downs in Louisville, Kentucky, on May 5, 2018. The race is a Grade 1 Stakes race for three-year-old Thoroughbreds at a distance of 1¼ miles. Justify came into the Derby with an unbeaten record of 3-0, making him one of the favorites to win the race. He broke from gate 7 and prevailed in a thrilling contest, winning on a rain-soaked track in a time of 2:04.20. The second leg of the Triple Crown was the Preakness Stakes, held at Pimlico Race Course in Baltimore, Maryland, on May 19, 2018. The race is a Grade 1 Stakes race for three-year-olds and is run over a distance of 1 3/16 miles. Justify faced a smaller field of seven other horses in the Preakness but encountered challenging conditions, as heavy fog and a muddy track made visibility difficult. Justify led the race from start to finish and won by half a length, maintaining his perfect record and setting the stage for a potential Triple Crown bid. The final leg of the Triple Crown, the Belmont Stakes, was held at Belmont Park in Elmont, New York, on June 9, 2018. The Belmont Stakes is a Grade 1 Stakes race for three-year-olds, run over a distance of 1½ miles. This race is often called the \\"Test of the Champion,\\" as it is the longest of the three Triple Crown races and requires horses to demonstrate stamina and durability. Justify faced nine other contenders, but the race was a showcase for his talent and determination. He led the race from wire to wire, finishing 1¾ lengths ahead of the second-place horse, Gronkowski. With a winning time of 2:28.18, Justify became the 13th horse in history to win the Triple Crown, and only the second since 1978 when American Pharoah achieved the feat in 2015, also trained by Bob Baffert. In addition to the historic achievement, Justify became the first horse since Apollo in 1882 to win the Kentucky Derby without racing as a two-year-old, and he was the first undefeated Triple Crown winner since Seattle Slew in 1977. Following his Triple Crown triumph, Justify was retired on July 25, 2018, due to ankle injuries and swelling.

The Eagle in Cambridge is where Francis Crick interrupted patrons' lunchtime on 28 February 1953 to announce that he and James Watson had \\"discovered the secret of life\\" after they had come up with their proposal for the structure of DNA. The anecdote is related in Watson's book The Double Helix. and commemorated with a blue plaque on the outside wall. If it is possible to answer this question, answer it for me (else, reply \\"unanswerable\\"): Along with J. R. R. Tolkien, who was a noted member of the Inklings?","output":"Another noted member of the Inklings, alongside J. R. R. Tolkien, was the very significant author C. S. Lewis. Clive Staples Lewis, known as C. S. Lewis, and J. R. R. Tolkien were integral figures within the Inklings, a literary discussion group that met regularly from the early 1930s to late 1949 in pubs in Oxford, specifically The Eagle and Child and the Lamb and Flag. C. S. Lewis, a scholar and eventual professor of English literature at both the University of Oxford and then later at the University of Cambridge, was one of the key figures in this collective of imaginative authors and scholars. Best known for his series of seven fantasy novels, The Chronicles of Narnia, Lewis was also a prolific writer of fiction and non-fiction, a poet, a lecturer, and a Christian apologist. His works often were imbued with religious and philosophical themes and issues of morality and ethics, something that reflected in the conversations of the Inklings. The Inklings, while primarily associated with C. S. Lewis and J. R. R. Tolkien, also included several other significant members such as Charles Williams and Owen Barfield. However, Lewis and Tolkien were often noted as the lynchpins of the group, forging a strong friendship and camaraderie that not only fueled their individual authorial pursuits but also enriched the intellectual environment of the Inklings. While Tolkien was associated with high fantasy literature (The Lord of The Rings) and Lewis with philosophical allegories (The Chronicles of Narnia, The Screwtape Letters), the Inklings provided an atmosphere of hearty intellectual discussion and criticism, where these authors could sprout and nurture their ideas. Thus, it invigorated and fostered their unique perspectives on fantasy and imaginative literature while rooted in philosophical and religious discourse. This special combination of intellectual camaraderie and creative discussion made the Inklings an important corner of 20th-century literature and academia, with its impact seen and felt in the widely acclaimed and loved works of both C. S. Lewis and J. R. R. Tolkien."},{"instruction":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

In addition, you can lower the risk of cancer by avoiding carcinogens , which are substances that cause cancer. For example, you can reduce your risk of lung cancer by not smoking. You can reduce your risk of skin cancer by using sunscreen. How to choose a sunscreen that offers the most protection is explained below ( Figure below ).

Take time to smell the roses: In this sentence, \\"time\\" refers to a period or duration that one should allocate to leisurely relax and enjoy the simple pleasures in life, such as appreciating the beauty of roses. In this context, \\"time\\" implies being intentional in spending a certain amount of time on something pleasurable. Step 1: Analyze the context of \\"time\\" in the first sentence - Leisurely, allocating a certain duration for an enjoyable activity 2. I didn't have time to finish: In this sentence, \\"time\\" refers to the availability or lack of a sufficient duration to complete a certain task or activity. The use of \\"time\\" in this context does not necessarily imply relaxation or leisure. Instead, it conveys a sense of urgency or constraint. Step 2: Analyze the context of \\"time\\" in the second sentence - Availability, lack of sufficient duration to complete a task As the analysis shows, the word \\"time\\" is used in different contexts in the two sentences. In the first sentence, \\"time\\" refers to a period specifically set aside for leisurely activities, while in the second sentence, \\"time\\" refers to the availability or lack of a sufficient duration to complete a task.

Sentence 2: Bill Pickett , an American-African rodeo performer , also appeared in early western films for the same audience . Do these two sentences convey the same information?","output":"Yes, these two sentences convey the same information but in slightly different ways. Both sentences discuss Bill Pickett, who was an African-American rodeo performer, and his appearance in early Western films for the same audience.  In Sentence 1, the word 'actor' is used instead of 'performer' present in Sentence 2. Both words, however, can be synonymous, especially in the context of a rodeo, where the participants put on a show for an audience. 'Actor' and 'performer' would refer to someone who is involved in displaying their skills and talents in a live or recorded exhibition, depicting their role in the entertainment industry. Additionally, the structure of the sentences slightly differs. In Sentence 1, the word 'Also' is used at the beginning, implying that the information about Bill Pickett is likely a continuation or addition to a previous statement. In Sentence 2, the word 'also' is placed later in the sentence, with the phrase 'American-African rodeo performer' preceding it. Moreover, Sentence 1 uses the term \\"African-American\\" whereas Sentence 2 uses \\"American-African.\\" While these two phrasings both indicate the same ethnicity, it is worth noting that \\"African-American\\" is the more commonly used term in contemporary conversations.

This saying often attributed to(...) the late Duchess   of Windsor represents much of the strange spirit of our times. Being thin is assumed as such a virtue. The problem with such a view is that some people actually attempt to live by it. I myself have fantasies of slipping into narrow designer clothes. Consequently, I have been on a diet for the better --or worse-- part of my life. Being rich wouldn't be bad either, but that won't happen unless an unknown   dies suddenly in some distant land, leaving me millions of dollars. Where did we go off the track? When did eating butter become a sin , and a little bit of extra flesh unappealing, if not unpleasant? All religions have certain days when people stop from eating and overeating is one of Christianity's seven deadly sins. However, until quite recently, most people had a problem getting enough to eat. In some religious groups, wealth was a symbol of probable high morals, and fatness a sign of wealth and well-being. Today the opposite is true. We have shifted to thinness as our new mark of virtue. The result is that being fat -- or even only somewhat overweight -- is bad because it implies a lack of moral strength. Our obsession with thinness is also fueled by health concerns. It is true that in this country we have more overweight people than ever before, and that in many cases, being overweight correlates with an increased risk of heart and blood vessel disease. These diseases, however, may have as much to do with our way of life and our high-fat diets as with excess weight. And the associated risk of cancer in the digestive system may be more of a dietary problem -- too much fat and a lack of fiber -- than a weight problem. The real concern, then, is not that we weigh too much, but that we neither exercise enough nor eat well. Exercise is necessary for strong bones and both heart and lung health.

The statement \\"These folks have opposed every American military operation from Grenada to the Gulf War\\" does not provide enough information to definitively ascertain their stance on the military action in Afghanistan.  This statement mainly tells us about their opposition to U.S. military involvement from the period of the Grenada intervention that happened in 1983 to the Gulf War which happened in 1990-1991. However, the involvement of the U.S. military in Afghanistan did not start until after the terror attacks on September 11th, 2001, which is more than a decade after the Gulf War.  While it might be tempting to assume that these individuals' previous opposition would carry over to the military action in Afghanistan, it's not a certain conclusion, as people's views can evolve over time or vary depending on the context and nature of each operation.  The Afghanistan conflict had a different context and justification from previous wars such as Grenada and the Gulf War. It was largely framed as a response to an act of terrorism against the U.S. (9/11 attacks), while the earlier conflicts were largely about issues of regional security and Cold-War era politicking. Moreover, public opinion often varies depending on the specifics of the military conflict at hand.  So, to get a definitive answer, we would need more specific information about these individuals' views after the Gulf War, particularly their stance on the military action in Afghanistan. Without that, we cannot definitively conclude that \\"These folks have been opposed to the military action in Afghanistan.\\""},{"instruction":"Read the following context and choose the correct option to answer the question.

Answer the following question: As a mother, I’m right now navigating the hardest moment with my two daughters and my son … I was raped at 15 and molested by a teacher from 15–16 … it took 13 years of fighting before I saw any justice for those crimes and it paled in comparison to having to live with that trauma for the last 25 years. I thought I had moved past it for the most part, thanks to supportive family and lots of counseling and medication to treat my treatment resistant depression I’ve struggled over the last 25 years. I will be 40 this year. My son, the oldest, turned 15 this year … the same age I was when it began. I see how young he is and recognized for the first time just how young I had been when I was abused. That was really hard for me, emotionally. Now, I look at my two girls, ages 9 and 3, and worry for their safety - probably more than I should, but understandable given what I went through. We have had lots of “body safety” talks and my older daughter understands the very basics of what I went through, mainly because I have spent a great part of this past year writing a memoir about my experiences and have begun speaking publicly about what I went through and what it means to be a survivor. This is challenging because it’s hard to talk about and explain to a child in a way that they understand without making them fear the world. I struggle with this often. I’ve chosen to use it as an opportunity to teach them about activism and the power of speaking the truth, what it means to be a survivor instead of a victim. I hope they grow up and see just how strong their mother is and how she has worked in the community to raise awareness and help others.

Given the question \\"What will Quinn want to do next?\\", is \\"Hit his mom\\" a valid answer? Answer:","output":"No, \\"Hit his mom\\" is not a valid answer for the question \\"What will Quinn want to do next?\\" The initial statement suggests that Quinn didn't give any trouble to his mom after she disciplined him, which implies that his response to the situation was relatively compliant. Choosing to hit his mom would be contradictory to that description of his behavior. Instead, a more appropriate answer would be one that reflects Quinn's understanding of his actions and their consequences, as well as a willingness to behave positively moving forward. It is essential to consider that a child would likely not want to engage in an aggressive act against their parent, especially after receiving discipline. Possible responses to \\"What will Quinn want to do next?\\" could include: 1. Apologize: A child might want to apologize to their parent after being disciplined. This can indicate their understanding of their wrongdoing and their desire to make amends for their behavior. 2. Reflect on their actions: Quinn might want to take some time to think about why he was disciplined and consider ways to avoid engaging in the same troublesome behavior in the future. This self-reflection can be an essential part of learning and personal growth. 3. Seek comfort or reassurance: It is not uncommon for children to become upset or even frightened after being disciplined. They may seek physical or emotional comfort or reassurance from a parent, sibling, or another caregiver. 4. Engage in a more acceptable activity: Quinn might want to participate in a positive and productive activity, which can help demonstrate his understanding of appropriate behavior and his commitment to following the rules. 5. Make amends: If his actions impacted others, Quinn could want to find ways to make amends, whether by offering a sincere apology, fixing any damage caused, or performing a kind gesture to make up for his previous behavior. It is critical to foster a nurturing and supportive environment that encourages communication and understanding between Quinn and his mom.

Why or why not? Question 2: Does cold air kill germs? Are questions 1 and 2 asking the same thing?","output":"Question 1: Does cold air kill germs? Why or why not? Cold air does not directly kill germs, but it can help to slow their growth or make it difficult for them to survive. Germs, including bacteria and viruses, are microorganisms that can cause infections and illnesses. They are adapted to thrive in certain environments and temperatures. The optimal temperature range for most bacteria is between 20°C to 45°C (68°F to 113°F), while some viruses prefer cooler temperatures, such as around 34°C (93°F). Cold air negatively impacts germs in several ways: 1. Slower reproduction rate: Cold temperatures can slow the metabolism of germs, making them reproduce at a slower rate. This slow reproduction rate gives our immune system a better chance to fight off infections. 2. Inactivation: Extreme temperature changes, including exposure to cold air, may lead to the inactivation of some germs. The structure of some viruses and bacteria can be altered due to cold temperatures, which may render them harmless. However, this inactivation does not equate to the complete eradication of germs. 3. Indirect effects: Cold air can reduce the amount of moisture in the air, leading to a drier environment. Some germs, such as the influenza virus, are more easily transmitted in low humidity conditions, while others, like bacteria, may struggle to survive in a dry environment. Despite these factors, cold air does not universally kill all germs. Many germs can survive and remain active in cold environments, and some even thrive in them - for example, the Listeria bacteria can grow and multiply at refrigeration temperatures. It is crucial to remember that maintaining proper hygiene, disinfecting surfaces, and regularly washing hands are key practices to minimize the spread of germs, regardless of temperature or air conditions. Question 2: Does cold air kill germs? As previously explained, cold air does not directly kill germs. However, it may slow their growth, make it difficult for them to survive, or even lead to the inactivation of some germs. Comparison between questions 1 and 2: Both questions 1 and 2 are essentially asking the same thing, which is whether cold air kills germs or not. However, question 1 also seeks a detailed explanation of the reasons why cold air may or may not be effective against germs, while question 2 requires only a basic answer addressing the effectiveness of cold air in killing germs."},{"instruction":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

(Associated Press)      SYDNEY (AP) — In an almost incomprehensible twist of fate, an Australian woman who lost her brother in the disappearance of Malaysia Airlines Flight 370 learned on Friday that her stepdaughter was on the plane shot down over Ukraine.      Kaylene Mann's brother Rod Burrows and sister-in-law Mary Burrows were on board Flight 370 when it vanished in March. On Friday, Mann found out that her stepdaughter, Maree Rizk, was killed along with 297 others on Malaysia Airlines Flight 17, which U.S. intelligence authorities believe was shot down by a surface-to-air missile.      \\"It's just brought everyone, everything back,\\" said Greg Burrows, Mann's brother. \\"It's just ... ripped our guts again.\\"      Burrows said his family was struggling to understand how they could be struck by such horrible luck on two separate occasions with the same airline.      \\"She just lost a brother and now a stepdaughter, so...\\" he said of his sister, his voice trailing off.      Rizk and her husband Albert, of Melbourne, were returning home from a four-week holiday in Europe, said Phil Lithgow, president of the Sunbury Football Club, with which the family was heavily involved. Albert, a real estate agent, was a member of the club's committee, Maree was a volunteer in the canteen and their son, James, plays on the club's team.      \\"They were very lovely people,\\" Lithgow said. \\"You wouldn't hear a bad word about them — very generous with their time in the community, very community-minded, and just really very entertaining people to be with.\\"      The club members planned to wear black armbands and observe a minute of silence to honor the Rizks at their game on Saturday, Lithgow said.      Despite the twin tragedies, Burrows said he holds nothing against Malaysia Airlines.      \\"Nobody could predict they were going to get shot down,\\" he said. \\"That was out of their hands.\\" |||||","output":"A lady named Kaylene Mann from Australia had a very sad thing happen to her.

Use the following highlights to write an article: With no atmosphere, cloudy weather or even night, space is a perfect place to build our solar power stations. The concept has been around since the 1940s when science fiction posited the idea of a robot-manned power station. Some variants could provide as much as 1GW of energy beamed to receivers on Earth -- enough to power a large city. Some scientists say only the cost of putting payloads in space is preventing the idea becoming a reality. Article:","output":"Title: Harnessing the Power of Space-Based Solar Stations: A Solution to Earth's Energy Needs Introduction: Space, the mysterious and vast frontier, offers enormous potential for tackling the energy demands of our planet. As the limits of non-renewable resources become increasingly evident, researchers are looking for innovative sources of sustainable energy. One such promising concept is the establishment of solar power stations in space, an idea that has persisted since the 1940s. Perfect Environment for Solar Energy Harvesting: The many advantages of generating solar power in space have been acknowledged for decades. Unlike Earth, space presents an environment free of atmospheric interference, cloudy weather, or even night. The lack of these hindrances means solar power stations could operate at maximum efficiency, generating significantly more energy than terrestrial counterparts. The Science Fiction Dream Becoming a Reality: Once confined to the realms of fantasy, the concept of robot-manned solar power stations in space may soon become a reality. Equipped with advanced technology, these stations could beam back as much as 1GW of energy to Earth, enough to power a large city. This innovative idea is hailed as major paradigm shift in the way we generate and utilize solar power. Obstacles to Overcome: Despite the numerous advantages offered by space-based solar power stations, challenges persist. The most significant hurdle is the cost associated with transporting payloads into space. Space travel remains an expensive endeavor, hampering the potential for rapid development in this sector. Thus, advancing space exploration and transportation technology is essential to making this ambitious concept a reality. Conclusion: As humanity advances towards a more sustainable future, the quest for innovative and environmentally-friendly energy sources remains paramount. Space-based solar power stations offer a tantalizing solution to the current energy crisis. By overcoming the crucial obstacle of costly space transportation, we may soon witness the realization of what was once but a dream, unlocking endless possibilities for our planet's energy needs."},{"instruction":"You should describe the task and explain your answer.

Just 26% of people thought it was not very difficult to move between social classes, compared with 35% in 2005. NatCen said the poll showed the UK class divide \\"was alive and well\\". The social research specialists found that people who identify as working class were more likely to believe the divide between social classes was \\"fairly wide\\" or \\"very wide\\" (82%) compared with 70% of those who describe themselves as middle class. The British Social Attitudes survey has been carried out every year since 1983, with questions repeated periodically to assess how opinions change over time. This 2015 study aimed to find how people had responded to government austerity and how it affected perceptions of class, public spending and the workplace. Kirby Swales, director of the NatCen survey centre, said: \\"The class divide is alive and well in Britain and the economic instability and austerity of recent years seem to have sharpened our belief that it is difficult to move from one class to another... \\"Our findings certainly show that people who believe themselves to be working class are more likely to believe in a class divide than those who say they are middle class and more think it is difficult to move between classes than did in the past.\\" The report also found the majority of people considered themselves to be working class (60%) compared with 40% who identified as being middle class - the same proportion as in 1983. This is despite the fact it is estimated that only a quarter of the population are in working class occupations, the report's authors said. Some 47% of people in jobs classed as managerial and professional consider themselves working class. NatCen said class identity was closely linked to attitudes in other areas, with people who say they are working class being far more likely to be opposed to immigration, one of the defining issues of the EU referendum. The authors of the report's chapter on social class, Geoffrey Evans and Jonathan Mellon, said there appeared to be a \\"working class of the mind\\". They said: \\"Those in middle class occupations still think of themselves to a surprising degree as working class, and especially so if their family background was working class or they have never been to university. \\"And this sense of working class identity apparently means that they are less libertarian and less pro-immigrant, but not necessarily more left-wing - even though those with a working class identity are particularly likely to think that class differences and barriers remain important.\\" But 45% of those surveyed back a cut in benefits for unemployed people. Elizabeth Clery, research director of NatCen social research, said: \\"We have witnessed a big rise in support for higher public spending; support is now back to a level not seen since before the financial crash. \\"After seven years of austerity the public is clearly worried about the funding of the NHS and reckons that, for some groups at least, spending on benefits should be increased.\\" What is a summary of this text?","output":"The NatCen British Social Attitudes Report discovered that the class divide in the UK is considered wide by a large majority (77%) of the 4,328 people surveyed. Only 26% believed it was not very difficult to move between social classes, a drop from 35% in 2005. The study, which has been conducted annually since 1983, aimed to gauge how government austerity and economic instability have shaped perceptions of class differences and barriers. Interestingly, 60% of respondents identified themselves as working-class, despite only an estimated 25% of the population being in working-class occupations. These working-class individuals were more likely to hold anti-immigration views, but not necessarily more left-wing. The report suggests that a \\"working-class of the mind\\" has developed, reflecting a strong sense of working-class identity based on family background or a lack of university education."},{"instruction":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

There, Lincoln befriends a young African American boy, William Johnson (Anthony Mackie), and intervenes when he sees Johnson being beaten by a slaver. Because of his son's actions, Thomas is fired. That night, Lincoln sees Barts break into his house and attack Nancy. She falls ill the following day, and dies shortly afterwards. Thomas tells Lincoln that Barts poisoned Nancy.Nine years later, Lincoln decides to get revenge against Barts. He attacks Barts at the docks, but Barts, who is actually a vampire, overpowers him. However, before Barts can kill him, Lincoln is rescued by Henry Sturgess (Dominic Cooper). Sturgess explains that vampires exist, and offers to teach Lincoln to be a vampire hunter. Lincoln accepts and, after a decade of training, travels to Springfield, Illinois. During his training, Sturgess tells Lincoln that the vampires in America descend from Adam (Rufus Sewell), a vampire who owns a plantation in New Orleans with his sister, Vadoma (Erin Wasson). Sturgess also tells Lincoln of the vampires' weakness, silver, and presents him with a silver pocket watch.In Springfield, Lincoln befriends shopkeeper Joshua Speed (Jimmi Simpson), and meets Mary Todd (Mary Elizabeth Winstead). Though Sturgess warned him not to form any close relationships, Lincoln develops romantic feelings for Mary.Lincoln successfully finds and defeats Barts. Before dying, Barts reveals that Sturgess is also a vampire. Lincoln confronts Sturgess, who reveals that, several years ago, he was attacked and bitten by Adam.

GAO reports can cover various topics, such as financial audits, program evaluations, policy analyses, and legal opinions. When GAO conducts research and development work on its initiative, draft reports are sent to the relevant federal agency for comments before they are finalized. Under a718(b)(2), the Senate Governmental Affairs committee and the House Government Reform committee can request access to draft reports and provide their input as well during the review process. This provision creates a system of checks and balances, and allows these committees to have oversight and collaborate to ensure accuracy, relevance, and comprehensiveness of the information provided in the final reports.

Answer by taking a quote from the following article: Loki is a fictional character appearing in American comic books published by Marvel Comics. Created by writer Stan Lee, scripter Larry Lieber, and penciller Jack Kirby, a version of the character first appeared in Venus #6 (August 1949). The modern day incarnation of Loki first appeared in Journey into Mystery #85 (October 1962). He is the adopted brother and often the enemy of the superhero Thor. In the reality of Earth-982, Loki kidnaps several major superheroes including Thunderstrike (Kevin Masterson), The Stinger, Jolt, Jubilation Lee, Speedball, J2 and Mainframe after sending a fake distress call from the former Avengers mansion. He ties them up and takes them to Asgard where he wants to use Thunderstrike's mace's powers for himself, but Kevin disrupts the spell, absorbing the mace into himself and transforming into a new Thunderstrike in the process. Loki and his army of Trolls are defeated by the heroes, with help from Thor, now the King of Asgard, and Loki and his army retreated. Thunderstrike, Stinger, J2 and Mainframe decide to stay together as the new Avengers. The adult heroes decline to stay with the reformed team because of personal reasons.  Years later, Loki is bitter about the fact that he was the cause of the Avengers formation and wants to get his revenge. He starts kidnapping heroes, holding them prisoner in life sized crystals when Captain America, J2, Thunderstrike, Spider-Girl and Wild Thing show up through a portal they found in another universe. The heroes are quickly outnumbered by Loki's robots and he vows to end The Age of Heroes.  J2 and Spider-Girl escape but Captain America and Thunderstrike are chained and Loki plans to brainwash the heroes to send them back to Earth where they will become violent and turn against each so they will eventually destroy all the heroes. His plan is ruined by Thor when he shows up after figuring out why certain superheroes are acting so different. Together, Thor, Captain America, Hulk and Spider-Girl get Loki to surrender. Captain America notices a gem hanging on Loki's neck, and smashes it with his shield. Loki was using this gem to help turn the heroes evil but once the gem is destroyed, the heroes revert to normal. A furious Loki releases a deadly blast on Captain America, killing him. Thor uses his hammer and sends Loki into Limbo forever and the Hulk decides to join him to make sure that Loki remains there. After Captain America dies, Thor uses his hammer to grant Captain America's soul immortality. His soul floats into the skies, and creates a shiny new, bright star in the sky in the form of Captain America's shield, meant to always inspire the heroes and future generations to come.

Multi-choice problem: Are these two questions inquiring about the same information? Pick your answer from: 1. no; 2. yes;","output":"2. yes Forgetting someone quickly and easily may not always be possible as emotions and personal experiences can vary. However, the following steps can help in moving forward and ease the process of forgetting someone: 1. Acceptance: Accept and acknowledge the feelings you have towards the person and understand that it's normal. Admitting the situation will help you to deal with the reality, rather than trying to brush things under the carpet. 2. Distance: Create physical and emotional distance from the individual. This may entail avoiding places you used to frequent together, unfollowing them on social media, and minimizing the time spent talking or thinking about the person. 3. Support System: Surround yourself with friends and family who love and support you. Lean on them for emotional guidance and share your feelings with them. This will provide you with a sense of validation and empathy that might ease the pain. 4. Focus on personal growth: Use this time as an opportunity for self-reflection and improvement. Engage in activities that make you feel happy and fulfilled, such as hobbies, exercise, and pursuing new interests. 5. Create new memories: Go out and make new memories with friends, family, or even by yourself. This can help in filling the void left by the person you are trying to forget. Exploring new places and experiences can make a difference in your emotional well-being. 6. Set boundaries: It's important to establish clear boundaries with the person, especially if forgetting them is necessary for your mental health and well-being. Discuss your decision with them, if possible, and establish a sense of understanding about the space you both need. 7. Avoid triggers: Try to identify and avoid any potential triggers that remind you of the person, such as music, movies, or other shared interests. This can minimize the chances of slipping back into the thought patterns associated with the person. 8. Seek professional help: Sometimes, forgetting someone can become a challenging task. In these cases, working with a mental health professional, such as a therapist or counselor, can provide valuable guidance in navigating your feelings and finding healthy coping mechanisms. It's also essential to be patient with yourself. Healing takes time, and rushing through the process may not lead to lasting results. It is crucial to allow yourself to feel your emotions and recognize that it is a part of the journey towards a healthier emotional state."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

It's impossible to say. The paragraph you presented does not provide sufficient information about Eric's work to assess whether it's strenuous or not. The story solely discusses Eric's physical workout at the gym, his run, and how tired he was after such activities, leading him to fall asleep immediately. None of these details give any information about Eric's work, thus making it impossible to discern the level of strenuousness of his work. To accurately answer the statement, \\"Working isn’t that strenuous,\\" it would be essential to have some context about Eric's job. Does he have a desk job that requires minimal physical activity or is he engaged in manual labor? Are his workdays long, adding to mental fatigue? These are just a few examples of the kind of information we'd need. For example, if Eric’s job is physically demanding, that combined with an intense gym session might cause tremendous fatigue. Alternatively, if Eric's work is more on the cognitive side, the fatigue he experiences might be more of a physical nature due to his gym regimen.  In addition, we must also be aware that strenuousness is a subjective measurement. What might seem strenuous to one person might not be to another. Personal fitness levels, health status, recovery ability, and mental resilience all play a part in how strenuous a person perceives their work or workout to be. Therefore, given the information present, we cannot make any firm conclusions about the strenuousness of Eric's work.

Step 1: Understand the two choices. We have two choices for the text: Felicia or Sarah can be the one who spends a lot of money on hair care products. Step 2: Analyze the context for an appropriate choice. Since Felicia has brown curly hair, it is likely that maintaining her hair may require more hair care products. In contrast, Sarah is bald, which suggests that she may not need many hair care products as she has no hair to maintain. Step 3: Justify the choice. It logically follows that Felicia would be the one to spend a lot of money on hair care products because of the nature of her hair. It would not be sensible for Sarah to do so, as she is bald and has no hair to take care of. Step 4: Write the text based on the choice.

What is the solution?","output":"To solve the equation 49*s - 52*s + 663 = 36*s for s, we will follow these steps: Step 1: Combine like terms on the left side of the equation. 49*s and -52*s are like terms since they both have the variable 's'. We will combine these terms by subtracting 52*s from 49*s: (49 - 52)*s + 663 = 36*s (-3)*s + 663 = 36*s Step 2: Move the terms with the variable 's' to one side of the equation and the constant term to the other side. To do this, we will add 3*s to both sides of the equation to move all terms with 's' to the right side: (-3)*s + 3*s + 663 = 36*s + 3*s 663 = 39*s Step 3: Isolate the variable 's' by dividing both sides of the equation by 39. 663 / 39 = 39*s / 39 17 = s So, the solution is s = 17."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

The UMC traces its roots back to the revival movement of John and Charles Wesley in England as well as the Great Awakening in the United States. As such, the church's theological orientation is decidedly Wesleyan. It embraces both liturgical and evangelical elements. It has a connexional polity, a typical feature of a number of Methodist denominations.  - Gary L.

Founded in 1865 by Ezra Cornell and Andrew Dickson White, the university was intended to teach and make contributions in all fields of knowledgefrom the classics to the sciences, and from the theoretical to the applied. These ideals, unconventional for the time, are captured in Cornell's motto, a popular 1865 Ezra Cornell quotation: \\"I would found an institution where any person can find instruction in any study.\\"  - Richard F. Fenno, Jr. (born December 12, 1926) is an American political scientist known for his pioneering work on the U.S. Congress and its members.  - Publishing is the dissemination of literature, music, or informationthe activity of making information available to the general public.

Baumgartner and Bryan D. Jones, Richard Fenno, Allen Schick, Dennis Ippolito, Naomi Caiden, Irene Rubin, James D. Savage, Thomas Greitens and Gary Wamsley. Budget theory was a central topic during the Progressive Era and was much discussed in municipal bureaus and other academic and quasi-academic facilities of that time such as the nascent Brookings Institution.  - Dennis Stephan Ippolito ( born 1942 ) is a professor of political science at Southern Methodist University and considered a leading historian and expert on governmental budget theory . He has written several books on the topic including Why Budgets Matter : Budget Policy and American Politics , published by Penn State Press and Congressional Spending : A Twentieth Century Fund Report , published by Cornell University Press .  - Southern Methodist University (SMU) is a private research university in Dallas, University Park, and Highland Park, Texas. Founded in 1911 by the Methodist Episcopal Church, South, SMU operates satellite campuses in Plano, Texas, and Taos, New Mexico. SMU is owned by the South Central Jurisdiction of the United Methodist Church. Of the university's 11,643 students, 6,411 are undergraduates.  - The Methodist Episcopal Church, South, or Methodist Episcopal Church South (MEC,S), was the Methodist denomination resulting from the 19th-century split over the issue of slavery in the Methodist Episcopal Church (MEC). Disagreement on this issue had been increasing in strength for decades between churches of the North and South; in 1844 it resulted in a schism at the General Conference of the MEC held in Louisville, Kentucky.  - New Mexico is a state located in the southwestern region of the United States of America. It was admitted to the union as the 47th state on January 6, 1912. It is usually considered one of the Mountain States. New Mexico is fifth by area, the 36th-most populous, and the sixth-least densely populated of the 50 United States.  - Social science is a major category of academic disciplines, concerned with society and the relationships among individuals within a society. It in turn has many branches, each of which is considered a \\"social science\\". The main social sciences include economics, political science, human geography, demography, and sociology. In a wider sense, social science also includes some fields in the humanities such as anthropology, archaeology, jurisprudence, history, and linguistics. The term is also sometimes used to refer specifically to the field of sociology, the original 'science of society', established in the 19th century. A more detailed list of sub-disciplines within the social sciences can be found at Outline of social science.  - Dallas is a major city in the state of Texas and is the largest urban center of the fourth most populous metropolitan area in the United States. The city proper ranks ninth in the U.S. and third in Texas after Houston and San Antonio. The city's prominence arose from its historical importance as a center for the oil and cotton industries, and its position along numerous railroad lines. The bulk of the city is in Dallas County, of which it is the county seat; however, sections of the city are located in Collin, Denton, Kaufman, and Rockwall counties. According to the 2010 United States Census, the city had a population of 1,197,816. The United States Census Bureau's estimate for the city's population increased to 1,300,092 as of July 1, 2015.

The trouble is, he found a successful formula as the bumbling, ordinary guy-next-door type in Shawn of the Dead, Run Fat Boy Run etc, but it's starting to wear thin. Here his character has no discernible qualities, he's rude and obnoxious, and thinks he's funny when he frankly isn't.

Gas particles do not experience any force of attraction or repulsion with each other.   Q: What state of matter is characterized by tiny particles separated by large distances, which do not experience any force of attraction or repulsion with each other?   A: Choose your answer from: [1]. steam [2]. emissions [3]. liquids [4]. gas Answer:","output":"The state of matter characterized by tiny particles separated by large distances, which do not experience any force of attraction or repulsion with each other, is [4]. gas. In the given paragraph, it is described that gases consist of tiny particles that are far apart from each other. These particles are continuously moving and collide with other gas particles and the walls of their container. Additionally, they do not experience any force of attraction or repulsion amongst themselves. The relationship between the velocity of these gas particles and the temperature of the gas is also mentioned. This description clearly reflects the properties of a gas, which distinguishes it from other states of matter such as solids, liquids, and plasmas. Option [1] steam is not the correct answer because steam is essentially water in its gaseous form, which makes it a specific example of a gas, but not the general term for the type of matter discussed in the paragraph. Option [2] emissions refer to substances, often in the form of gases, released into the environment as a result of some industrial or vehicular processes. This term does not specifically describe the state of matter characterized by tiny particles with large distances between them and no forces of attraction or repulsion. Option [3] liquids do not fit the description provided in the paragraph, as liquid particles are closer together than gas particles and do experience forces of attraction and repulsion with one another. Therefore, based on the characteristics provided in the paragraph, the correct answer is [4]. gas."},{"instruction":"Information:  - Psychological horror is a subgenre of horror literature, film, television, and video games (as a narrative) which relies on the character's fears and/or psychological instability to frighten readers, viewers or players. On a few occasions, Psychological horror overlaps with the psychological thriller subgenre, making whatever story of the genre more unpleasant as well as terrifyingly suspenseful.  - The term \\"Cinema of Korea\\" (or \\"Korean cinema\\") encompasses the motion picture industries of North and South Korea. As with all aspects of Korean life during the past century, the film industry has often been at the mercy of political events, from the late Joseon dynasty to the Korean War to domestic governmental interference. While both countries have relatively robust film industries today, only South Korean films have achieved wide international acclaim. North Korean films tend to portray their communist or revolutionary themes.  - Horror film is a film genre that seeks to elicit a negative emotional reaction from viewers by playing on their fears. Inspired by literature from authors like Edgar Allan Poe, Bram Stoker, and Mary Shelley, horror films have existed for more than a century. The macabre and the supernatural are frequent themes. Horror may also overlap with the fantasy, supernatural fiction and thriller genres.  - Exorcism (from Greek , \\"exorkismos\\"  binding by oath) is the religious or spiritual practice of purportedly evicting demons or other spiritual entities from a person or an area they are believed to have possessed. Depending on the spiritual beliefs of the exorcist, this may be done by causing the entity to swear an oath, performing an elaborate ritual, or simply by commanding it to depart in the name of a higher power. The practice is ancient and part of the belief system of many cultures and religions.  - South Korea, officially the Republic of Korea (ROK), is a sovereign state in East Asia, constituting the southern part of the Korean Peninsula.  - In folklore and parapsychology, a Poltergeist (German for \\"noisy ghost\\") is a type of ghost or other supernatural entity which is responsible for physical disturbances, such as loud noises and objects being moved or destroyed. They are purportedly capable of pinching, biting, hitting, and tripping people. Most accounts of poltergeists describe the movement or levitation of objects such as furniture and cutlery, or noises such as knocking on doors.  - Precognition (from the Latin \\"præ-\\", \\"before\\" and \\"cognitio\\", \\"acquiring knowledge\\"), also called prescience, future vision, future sight is an alleged psychic ability to see events in the future.  - Korean horror is the term given to horror films made as part of the cinema of Korea . Korean horror features many of the same motifs , themes , and imagery as Japanese horror . Korean horror has been around since the early years of Korean cinema ; however , it was not until the late 1990s that the genre began to experience a renewal . Many of the Korean horror films tend to focus on the suffering and the anguish of characters rather than focus on the explicit \`\` blood and guts '' aspect of horror .  - Japanese folklorists and historians use \\"ykai\\" as \\"supernatural or unaccountable phenomena to their informants\\". In the Edo period, many artists, such as Toriyama Sekien, created \\"ykai\\" inspired by folklore or their own ideas, and in the present, several \\"ykai\\" created by them (e.g. Kameosa and Amikiri, see below) are wrongly considered as being of legendary origin.  - Horror is a genre of fiction which is intended to, or has the capacity to frighten, scare, disgust, or startle their readers or viewers by inducing feelings of horror and terror. Literary historian J. A. Cuddon has defined the horror story as \\"a piece of fiction in prose of variable length... which shocks or even frightens the reader, or perhaps induces a feeling of repulsion or loathing\\". It creates an eerie and frightening atmosphere. Horror is frequently supernatural, though it can be non-supernatural. Often the central menace of a work of horror fiction can be interpreted as a metaphor for the larger fears of a society.  - Shamanism (or ) is a practice that involves a practitioner reaching altered states of consciousness in order to perceive and interact with a spirit world and channel these transcendental energies into this world.  - Japanese horror is Japanese horror fiction in popular culture, noted for its unique thematic and conventional treatment of the horror genre in light of western treatments. Japanese horror tends to focus on psychological horror and tension building (suspense), particularly involving ghosts and poltergeists, while many contain themes of folk religion such as: possession, exorcism, shamanism, precognition, and ykai.  - Japan (\\"Nippon\\" or \\"Nihon\\" ; formally \\"\\" or \\"Nihon-koku\\", means \\"State of Japan\\") is a sovereign island nation in Eastern Asia. Located in the Pacific Ocean, It is lying off the eastern coast of the Asia Mainland (east of China, Korea, Russia) and stretching from the Sea of Okhotsk in the north to the East China Sea and near Taiwan in the southwest.   - Suspense is a feeling of pleasurable fascination and excitement mixed with apprehension, tension, and anxiety developed from an unpredictable, mysterious, and rousing source of entertainment. The term most often refers to an audience's perceptions in a dramatic work. Suspense is not exclusive to fiction. It may operate whenever there is a perceived suspended drama or a chain of cause is left in doubt, with tension being a primary emotion felt as part of the situation.  - Folk religion, alongside popular religion and vernacular religion, are terms used within religious studies and folkloristics to describe various forms and expressions of religion that are deemed distinct from the official doctrines and practices of organized religion. The precise definition of folk religion varies among scholars. Sometimes also termed popular belief, it consists of ethnic or regional religious customs under the umbrella of a religion, but outside of official doctrine and practices.

Summarize this article: While this may seem excessive, it's actually a vital part of removing fleas from your home. Since fleas lay eggs that may hatch after you've treated your pet, you need to remove the eggs and larvae that fall to the floor or on furniture. Vacuum every day for a few weeks to ensure that a new cycle of fleas won't trouble you.  Remember to throw the vacuum bag away in an outdoor dumpster or empty the bagless vacuum canister into the outdoor dumpster. If you leave the dirt in the vacuum bag or canister, the fleas can easily work their way back into your home.  Eggs and fleas can also get trapped in the fabric on couches, pet bedding and other upholstered furniture. Vacuum upholstery every day for a few weeks. Diatomaceous earth (DE) is a natural and safe alternative for killing fleas in your house. DE is similar in consistency to talcum powder.  It can be sprinkled on carpets, baseboards, and other places in your house. Let it sit for a few days and then vacuum it up. This type of insecticide will restrict the growth of fleas and eggs. Check that the product will kill fleas/eggs for up to 7 months. Strictly follow the instructions. Make sure to remove all pets from the area when you are applying this insecticide. Don't forget birds and other pets in cages. Be sure to also cover aquariums when using these products. Strip as much of the fabric off your couches, chairs, and bed as you can. Then, wash it in the hottest water your fabric will allow. This should kill fleas and their eggs. Gather up any clothes that may be lying around, especially piles of laundry. Fleas will nest in fabrics. Washing and drying on the hottest setting possible will kill fleas and eggs.","output":"The article emphasizes the importance of removing fleas from your home by focusing on various cleaning methods.

Given the question: Process:  - Thunderstorms form over the ocean - An area of low pressure causes rotation - Several thunderstorms come together around this area - The storm is fed by rising air from warm ocean water evaporating - When the wind speeds reach 74 mph the storm is considered a hurricane.  Perturbation hypothesis: suppose Thunderstorm start to accumulate happens, how will it affect MORE POWERFUL hurricanes.  Does the supposed perturbation have an effect (direct or indirect) on the process? The answer is:","output":"Yes, the supposed perturbation does have a direct effect on the process of hurricane formation. If thunderstorms start to accumulate more frequently or intensely, it may lead to the formation of more powerful hurricanes, and here's why: The gathering of several thunderstorms is essentially the initial phase of hurricane formation, and it's a necessary condition needed to create a storm system that has potential to develop into a full-blown hurricane. These thunderstorms, which begin over the warm waters of the ocean, can combine to form a larger body of rotating storm clouds around an area of low pressure, also known as a tropical disturbance. If this increase in thunderstorm aggregation happens, there will be more areas of rotation and, consequently, more opportunities for potential tropical disturbances to form. This not only increases the overall number of hurricanes, which in itself can be problematic, but it can also potentially lead to more powerful hurricanes. Here's where the role of the air and ocean water comes into play. In the normal creation of hurricanes, warm ocean waters evaporate, leading to the rise of hot moist air into the developing storm. As this air rises and cools, it forms clusters of powerful thunderstorms. The continual supply of heated moist air into the system 'feeds' the hurricane, helping it to grow and strengthen. Given thunderstorms are starting to accumulate more often under the perturbation hypothesis, this essentially means that there is a greater amount of hot, moist air being driven into the system. This air is the 'fuel' for the hurricane. Thus, more \\"fuel\\" would logically lead to stronger or faster developing hurricanes, given the right conditions. Furthermore, it's necessary to note that wind speed plays an integral role in the classification of storms. A storm is designated as a hurricane when the wind speeds reach 74mph. If thunderstorms are gathering more frequently, the collective energy derived from these systems could result in higher wind speeds thereby producing more powerful hurricanes. While this description simplifies a very complex atmospheric process, it is a reasonable expectation based on our current understanding of hurricane formation. However, other factors such as wind shear, temperature profiles, humidity levels, and many more can also impact hurricane formation and intensity, and these could potentially interact with the increase in thunderstorms in various ways. Therefore, while it is likely that an increase in thunderstorm aggregation will lead to more powerful hurricanes, it should be considered as part of a wider context of atmospheric conditions and influences. This is a clear demonstration of how changes, even on small scales, can affect larger, more complex systems."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant. You will be given a task.

Movie title: Y tu mamÃ¡ tambiÃ©n Movie plot: The film combines straightforward storytelling with periodic interruptions of the soundtrack, during which the action continues, but a narrator provides additional out-of-context information about the characters, events, or setting depicted. In addition to expanding on the narrative, these \\"footnotes\\" sometimes draw attention to economic/political issues in Mexico, especially the situation of the poor in rural areas of the country.The story itself focuses on two boys at the threshold of adulthood: Julio (Gael García Bernal), from a leftist middle-class family, and Tenoch (Diego Luna), whose father is a high-ranking political official. The film opens with scenes of each boy having sex with his girlfriend one last time before the girls leave on a trip to Italy. Without their girlfriends around, the boys quickly become bored.At a wedding, they meet Luisa (Maribel Verdú), the Spanish wife of Tenoch's cousin Jano, and attempt to impress the older woman with talk of an invented secluded beach called la Boca del Cielo (\\"Heaven's Mouth\\"). She initially declines their invitation to go there with them, but changes her mind following a phone call in which Jano tearfully confesses cheating on her.Although Julio and Tenoch have little idea where to find the promised beach, the three set off for it, driving through poor, rural Mexico. They pass the time by talking about their relationships and sexual experiences, with the boys largely boasting about their modest exploits, and Luisa speaking in more measured terms about Jano and wistfully of her first teenage love, who died in an accident.On an overnight stop she telephones Jano, leaving a \\"goodbye note\\" on his answering machine. Tenoch goes to her motel room looking for shampoo, but finds her crying. She seduces him, and he awkwardly but enthusiastically has sex with her. Julio sees this from the open doorway, and angrily tells Tenoch that he's had sex with his girlfriend.

With the first one, I was hired by and worked for the family. I picked the teen up from school every day and took care of him until he was in bed for the night. When he passed away, I took a job with the local school district. My client at the school had spastic quadriplegia. He could talk and was actually very smart, but he had no control over his arms or legs. He couldn’t walk. He was never going to walk. The law requires that special education students be put in the least restrictive classroom environment possible. Since this kid was smart and could communicate well, and wasn’t a discipline problem, he had all regular classes. His only accommodation was a one-on-one aide (me), and he was allowed to be late to classes without consequence because we sometimes had to stop in a special room, get him out of his chair, and stretch his legs a little. Basically ten minutes of physical therapy, two or three times per day. Anyway, since this kid was legally required to take all the classes a normal student his age would take, he had to take Physical Education (gym). And, legally, his aide (me) had to accommodate his participation in every class as much as possible, including gym. Most gym classes began with the students doing laps around the track, then participating in a team sport. He couldn’t do the team sport, but, according to the lawyers involved, he should participate in the “laps around the track” part of gym. So I had to push this kid in a wheelchair around the track for about 15 minutes each day, until the other kids were all done and off doing the next activity. Then he and I were able to leave gym class and go do some physical therapy in his own little room just for that. Because, you know… lawyers and rules.

Please answer the following question: What is the answer for the question: What albums did the original lead guitarist for the band that had a member die in August 1992 perform lead vocals on? from the following article ?  Lukather is the original lead guitarist for Toto, serving in that capacity for the band's entire history, as well as a lead and backing vocalist and composer. Lukather won three of his five Grammy Awards for work with Toto, twice as an artist and once as a producer. David Paich led the band's songwriting efforts during the development of 1978's Toto—he penned all but two of the album's tracks, including all four of its singles. Lukather also credits Jeff Porcaro for his leadership within the band during that period. However, Lukather's role in Toto evolved over time owing to the changing needs of the band. In August 1992, Jeff Porcaro collapsed while doing yard work at home and subsequently died of heart failure. The death profoundly affected Toto and Lukather in particular, who felt that he needed to step up and make sure the band kept going. Thus, he began taking more of a leadership role. Toto went through several lead vocalists over the years, including Bobby Kimball, Fergie Frederiksen, and Joseph Williams. After the 1990 dismissal of their fourth vocalist, Jean-Michel Byron, Toto was without a lead singer until around 1997; Lukather assumed most of the vocal duties for the band during that time. He performed lead vocals for every track on 1992's Kingdom of Desire and 1995's Tambu except for two instrumental tracks. The Tambu single \\"I Will Remember\\", co-written by Lukather and Stan Lynch, reached number 64 on UK charts. Some Tambu reviewers contrasted Lukather's vocals with those of former singers Kimball and Williams (and indeed, heavily criticized the entire album), some concert reviewers noted that he struggled vocally on certain songs, and a number of backup singers and guest vocalists accompanied the band's live shows during that period. It was not until Toto brought back Williams and Kimball to collaborate on 1998's Toto XX that Lukather returned predominantly to the role of backup vocalist.Lukather's songwriting contributions grew from a smattering of tracks on early Toto albums to co-writing... Answer:","output":"The original lead guitarist for the band Toto is Steve Lukather.

Bithiah, the Pharaoh's daughter, who had recently lost both her husband and the hope of ever having children of her own, finds the basket and decides to adopt the boy even though her servant, Memnet, recognizes the child is Hebrew and protests. Because she drew the infant out of the water, Bithiah decides to name the baby Moses.

Trump's barrage of insults comes as Comey engages in a publicity campaign for his book, \\"A Higher Loyalty: Truth, Lies, and Leadership,\\" which is set to be released next week. The memoir promises a deep look at Comey's fraught relationship with the U.S. president who fired him, and whom Comey has accused of interfering in the independence of the FBI. On Twitter, Trump said Comey should be prosecuted. Trump's comments are in line with an online campaign, organized by his supporters, to discredit Comey. The Republican National Committee on Thursday launched a new website, Lyin'Comey.com, which features quotes from prominent Democrats who have criticized the former FBI director in the past. The GOP plans to fact-check Comey's book and use the website for \\"rapid response\\" to highlight any \\"misstatements\\" or \\"contradictions,\\" Fox News reports. Comey's book blasts Trump as unethical and \\"untethered to truth'' and calls his leadership of the country \\"ego driven and about personal loyalty.'' The book also contains several personal jabs at Trump, including references to what Comey says are the \\"bright white half-moons\\" under Trump's eyes, which he surmises were the result of Trump using tanning goggles. Comey also casts Trump as a Mafia boss-like figure who sought to blur the line between law enforcement and politics, and tried to pressure him regarding his investigation into Russian election interference, according to multiple early reviews of the book. Trump fired Comey in May 2017, setting off a storm of charges from Democrats that the president sought to hinder an investigation into whether his campaign colluded with Russians. The firing led to the appointment of Robert Mueller as special counsel overseeing the Russia investigation. Mueller's probe has expanded to include whether Trump obstructed justice by firing Comey, an idea the president denies. Trump has...

I know that the answer to the question \\"Where did the revolution come from?\\" is in \\"Alexis de Tocqueville described the French Revolution as the inevitable result of the radical opposition created in the 18th century between the monarchy and the men of letters of the Enlightenment. These men of letters constituted a sort of \\"substitute aristocracy that was both all-powerful and without real power\\". This illusory power came from the rise of \\"public opinion\\", born when absolutist centralization removed the nobility and the bourgeoisie from the political sphere. The \\"literary politics\\" that resulted promoted a discourse of equality and was hence in fundamental opposition to the monarchical regime. De Tocqueville \\"clearly designates ... the cultural effects of transformation in the forms of the exercise of power\\". Nevertheless, it took another century before cultural approach became central to the historiography, as typified by Robert Darnton, The Business of Enlightenment: A Publishing History of the Encyclopédie, 1775–1800 (1979).\\". Can you tell me what it is? The answer to this question is:","output":"The French Revolution, which began in 1789, was the result of the radical opposition created between the monarchy and the intellectuals (men of letters) of the Enlightenment period during the 18th century. Alexis de Tocqueville, a prominent French historian and political theorist, described the revolution as an inevitable consequence of this opposition. During the 18th century, the rise of absolutist centralization removed the influence of the nobility and the bourgeoisie from the political sphere. This led to the emergence of \\"public opinion\\", which was formed and shaped by the ideas and discourse of the Enlightenment intellectuals. These men of letters, who promoted values like equality and liberty, held a sort of \\"illusory power\\" due to their contribution to the development of public opinion. This power, however, did not translate to concrete political authority. These intellectuals essentially became a \\"substitute aristocracy\\" that wielded considerable influence over the broader population but held no real political power. It was the collision of their ideas with the rigid structure of the monarchical regime, which sought to maintain its absolute power, that eventually fueled the French Revolution. It should be noted that this cultural approach to understanding the origins of the French Revolution became more prevalent in historiography after the publication of Robert Darnton's seminal work, \\"The Business of Enlightenment: A Publishing History of the Encyclopédie, 1775–1800\\" (1979)."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Most of the bad reviews came within a month of them opening. I don't know if they had a rocky start where they were trying to figure everything out, but if that's the case I'm glad I waited until today to try them.  I bought a dozen doughnuts for my office which included all the gourmet doughnuts and some of their specialty doughnuts as well. Their cake doughnuts have just the right bite to them, with the sweet potato doughnut being my favorite of this group. And even though they didn't invent the maple bar with bacon on it (some reviewer earlier seemed to hold this against them, as if anybody outside of Voodoo Donuts in Portland shouldn't even be allowed to make them) but they did it justice. To be honest, there wasn't a doughnut that didn't wow me.   As for the staff, they were all very friendly, courteous, polite and helpful. Whatever bugs they were working out when they opened, they have taken care of. I will definitely be back...probably much more than I should.   P.S. As for the reviewers who complained that most of the doughnuts were gone by 10:00 AM, maybe that says something about the quality of those doughnuts and maybe you should just try to get there before then to enjoy them. They open at 6:00 AM. How would this review be described in terms of sentiment?","output":"This review can be described as having a predominantly positive sentiment. The reviewer acknowledges the negative reviews from the early days of the establishment but goes on to praise the doughnuts they tried, including the gourmet and specialty doughnuts, and mentions their favorites. They also compliment the staff for their friendly, courteous, polite, and helpful demeanor, which indicates that any initial issues have been resolved. The reviewer further addresses other negative comments by suggesting that the demand for the doughnuts is evidence of their high quality. The use of words and phrases such as \\"glad\\", \\"just the right bite\\", \\"favorite\\", \\"wow\\", \\"very friendly\\", \\"courteous\\", \\"polite\\", \\"helpful\\", and \\"definitely be back\\" clearly demonstrate the positive sentiment in this review. The reviewer also encourages others to try the establishment by suggesting they arrive earlier to enjoy the doughnuts. Overall, the sentiment of the review is quite favorable towards the doughnut shop."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant. User will you give you a task.

Ozone depletion results in higher levels of UV radiation reaching Earth, and if there is an increase in UV radiation, the risks go up for all types of skin cancer. Given these facts, the risks of all types of skin cancer increases with increasing among the following options: - oxygen debt  - rays or beams  - electromagnetic energy  - scattered light  - temperature  - shadow boxing  - ozone depletion  - redshift A:","output":"Ozone depletion results in higher levels of ultraviolet (UV) radiation reaching Earth's surface, posing increased risks for all types of skin cancer. Among the options provided, the most relevant factors that can influence the risk of skin cancer are rays or beams, electromagnetic energy, scattered light, and ozone depletion. Let's discuss these factors and how they contribute to the increased risk of skin cancer. 1. Rays or beams: This term refers to the direct transmission of sunlight or artificial light sources. Since UV radiation is one of the main sources of skin cancer risk, increased exposure to UV rays or beams can lead to a higher risk of developing skin cancer. Protecting oneself from these rays, such as through using sunscreen, wearing protective clothing, and limiting exposure to sunlight, can mitigate the risk of skin cancer development. 2. Electromagnetic energy: The electromagnetic spectrum includes a wide range of energy types, including gamma rays, X-rays, ultraviolet (UV) radiation, visible light, infrared, microwaves, and radio waves. Among these, UV radiation, which is a type of electromagnetic energy, is the most harmful to our skin, leading to DNA damage and increasing the risk of skin cancer. Limiting exposure to electromagnetic energy, particularly UV radiation, is critical to reducing skin cancer risk. 3. Scattered light: Scattered light refers to sunlight that has been reflected or scattered by particles and surfaces in Earth's atmosphere. Scattered UV radiation contributes to the total UV exposure that reaches Earth's surface, increasing the risk of skin cancer. While it can be challenging to avoid scattered light specifically, taking measures to limit direct sunlight exposure, including seeking shade and wearing protective clothing, can help reduce skin cancer risk. 4. Ozone depletion: As mentioned earlier, the depletion of the ozone layer results in higher levels of UV radiation reaching Earth's surface. The ozone layer is essential for absorbing the majority of the Sun's harmful UV radiation. Factors that contribute to ozone depletion, such as the emission of chlorofluorocarbons (CFCs) and other ozone-depleting substances, exacerbate the risk of skin cancer. Supporting efforts to reduce ozone-depleting substances and taking measures to protect oneself from UV radiation are essential in reducing the risk of skin cancer. In conclusion, among the provided options, rays or beams, electromagnetic energy, scattered light, and ozone depletion are the most relevant factors that contribute to the increased risk of skin cancer. By being mindful of these factors and taking steps to reduce exposure to harmful UV radiation, individuals can decrease their risk of developing this potentially life-threatening disease."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Please answer the following question: Jason Munt said him and Carly Furnish got beamed up by a bunch of aliens just after he'd boldly gone with her in the car park woods. It was the boldly going bit people thought was bullshit. Carly Furnish was a good God-loving girl. Trouble was, she'd gone missing. And Jason Munt had a weird crescent-shaped branding in his back, and was sticking to his story. Jason got hauled in by the cops and told he was in a whole heap of trouble. He reported blinding lights and a feeling like floating. He described being strapped to a table by little green men. A cop slapped the table and shouted, 'there's a frigging girl out there.' Jason said he knew how it sounded - the little green men, the whole thing - but it's true: they were little and green, just like out of the comic books. He volunteered tests for drink and drugs. He came back negative on both counts. They left him to stew. He said the last he saw of Carly was her being sucked up in some kind of light ray. He said, 'she seemed asleep - all peaceful, like.' Jason could not explain why he'd been beamed back down to earth, yet they'd seemingly taken Carly all the way off home with them to the Planet Zog. There were plenty of people willing to reckon it proved aliens had mighty good taste, but it wasn't the time nor the place to say it out loud. The cops released Jason after two days of questions. He stuck to his story throughout. The desk sergeant said, 'mark my words, there's a lot of hate out there.' Jason headed straight home.

Article: Everybody knows that colors are connected with certain feelings. For example, why do some people paint the walls of their rooms yellow and others pink? The same is true in stores. They want us to feel something when we look at their products. Green, for example, tries to show the quality of a product: how good it is for us or for our environment. It also suggests that the product is healthier, has less fat and maybe fewer calories. Red, on the other hand is an aggressive color that is often used for packaging food. Red wants us to become hungry or thirsty. Purple is a kind of color that is often seen as royal. It indicates that it is something special. Producers use purple to show that something is of good quality. Blue is not very often found in food packaging because there are not very many foods that have a blue color. Colors can also have different meaning in different cultures and countries. For example, while the color white is used in many Western countries to represent purity and innocence, it is seen as a symbol of mourning in many Eastern countries. The Egyptian pharaohs  wore white crowns. A white sale is a sale of sheets, towels, and other bed and bath items. A white flag is the universal symbol for truce . A white elephant is a rare, pale elephant sacred  to the people of India, Thailand, Burma, and Sri Lanka. In these countries, something that is a white elephant is either a possession that costs more than it is worth to keep or an item that the owner doesn't want but can't get rid of. Consumers are aware that certain foods must have certain colors. When Pepsi brought out a crystal clear cola in 1992, it thought that consumers would buy it because clear meant pure and healthy. After a few months Pepsi found out that a cola had to be dark-colored. Crystal Pepsi failed and the company pulled it off the market.

Yet amid this lyrical symphony of baseball, an undercurrent of social unrest was palpable. Demonstrators had rallied outside, their collective anger directed at Ozzie Guillen, the Miami Marlins manager, who was returning from a five-game suspension for his controversial remarks regarding the former Cuban leader, Fidel Castro. A sigh ran through the stadium as Guillen finally emerged from the dugout and onto the field. His expression was severe, a marked contrast from the affable persona that he was widely known for. But as the stadium lights illuminated him, the man looked beneath his cap and a reflective silence fell across the field. The chanting of the demonstrators could be faintly heard in the backdrop, the sharp undercurrent of their voices contrasting against the typical ballpark ambience.  The first inning began and the game unfolded. Guillen's Marlins fought hard, their unity evident despite the surrounding controversy. Guillen's initial slip-up was replaced with a reassuring strength, reflecting the resilience of the team he was leading. The match moved into the ninth inning with the score tied. Seemingly, the universe itself had conspired to script a baseball game with all its dramas and uncertainties, giving Guillen an opportunity to regain his reputation, to redeem himself in the eyes of the Miami public. As the game approached its climax, waves of palpable tension flowed through the stadium, challenging the Marlins, challenging Guillen, but he stood unfazed. The former Cubs manager looked directly into the eyes of his Chicago Cub rivals, a determined expression replacing his earlier remorse. Leading his team from the front, displaying his innate strategic acumen, the Marlins finally took lead with an awe-inspiring home run - a symbol, perhaps, of overcoming larger adversities. At the end of the match, Ozzie Guillen's name echoed in the stadium, not in criticism, but in rally cries from the Marlins fans, praising his resilience and courage under fire. The huge screens flashed: Miami Marlins win. The overpowering sound of the cheers from the stadium drowned the voices of the protesters, at least for a moment.  Guillen, post-game, reflected on the win to the press: \\"We've had some hard days, but we handled them as a team, as a family. That's what the Marlins are about.\\" His words resonated, bearing a resonance that transcended mere sports rhetoric. The sentiment hit home, especially with the Cuban-American population, drawing a line of truce, a ray of tentative hope to heal, to recover, and to move forward together. The controversy surrounding Guillen's comments on the former Cuban Leader, Fidel Castro, didn't dissipate overnight. Yet with the Miami Marlins' victory and Guillen's robust leadership, that Tuesday night offered a glimmer of hope that baseball, indeed, could ignite change, could drive a conversation, could mend relationships.  In the end, Guillen was more than a team manager; he was a symbol of resilience and unity against unresolved social tensions. And that Tuesday night became an indelible part of Marlins' history, emblazoning Ozzie Guillen's legacy despite the controversy, carving a new twist in Miami's baseball tale."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

It is strongly recommended that vessel operators follow these guidelines for all kinds of whales. * Approach whales from the side, not from the front or the back. * Approach no closer than 100 metres, then stop the boat but keep the engine on. * Keep noise levels down-no horns, whistles or racing of engines. * Start your boat only after the whales are more than 100 metres from your vessel. * Leave the area slowly, gradually moving faster when you are more than 300 metres from the whales. * Approach and leave slowly, avoiding sudden changes in speed or direction. * Avoid disturbing groups of resting whales. * Keep at low speeds and remain in the same direction if travelling side by side with whales. * When whales are travelling close to shore, avoid crowding them near the shore or coming between the whales and the shore. * Limit the time spent with any group of whales to less than 30 minutes at a time when within 100 to 200 metres of whales. * If there is more than one vessel at the same observation spot, be sure to avoid any boat position that would result in surrounding the whales. * Work together by communicating with other vessels, and make sure that all operators are aware of the whale watching guidelines.

Article: Well-known companies are powered by their names and reputations. When people walk into a Pizza Hut in Tokyo, Rome, or Miami, they know exactly what they are getting. Through franchising, an investor   can make use of this brand power by opening a Pizza Hut of his or her own. The risk is low, and the rewards can be big. No wonder franchising is such a successful business model. Franchising had been around for more than 100 years, but its popularity took off in the 1950s. Leading the trend were fast food restaurant like McDonald's. These days, there are franchises in more than eighty-five industries, including dry cleaning, hotels and supermarkets. It's a very big business. In the US, there are some 760,000 franchises, totaling more than 1.5 trillion in yearly revenues (income). There are two sides in a franchise: the franchisor--the owner of the business system and the franchisee--the person who licenses the system. After signing a \\"franchise agreement\\", the franchisee pays a fee. He or she also pays for equipment, supplies, and, if necessary, building costs. The total investment usually ranges from 10,000 to 1,000,000. After the business opens, the franchisee also pays a percentage of sales revenues--called a royalty--to the franchisor. Marking fees must also be paid. In return, the franchisee receives many benefits. Training is among the most common ones. It includes everything from dealing with customers to understanding the company's standards. The franchisor also handles advertising. On top of that, there's the benefit of the brand reputation that the company has built up. All of these benefits make the risk of opening a franchise much smaller than that of starting a business from scratch. However, a franchise can also have drawbacks. If a customer at a single restaurant gets sick, it may hurt every franchise in the system. Running a franchise also means closely following the company's standards. So, one has to give up a degree of independence. You have to do things their way and trust that the system... Question: What is the most important factor to make a franchise successful? Answer: A:","output":"Brand power. The most important factor to make a franchise successful is brand power. In the article, it explains that well-known companies are powered by their names and reputations, and this is what attracts potential investors to open franchises. The brand power ensures that customers know exactly what they are getting when they walk into a franchised location, regardless of the city or country. This recognition and trust in the brand significantly reduce the risk of opening a franchise compared to starting a business from scratch. Additionally, the franchisee benefits from the company's advertising and established brand reputation, further contributing to the franchise's success."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

The chill of the January afternoon pierced her through, but it was fear, more than the cold, that made her limbs shake. Having just crossed over to the Left Bank, she glanced back over her shoulder and saw the towers and spires of the royal palace across the Seine. She felt as if hidden eyes there were watching her. Could anyone on the palace wall have seen her walk over the Petit-Pont? Not Amalric. He was still in the south, the King having just appointed him seneschal for Beziers and the surrounding country. But he had so many agents in Paris and allies at court. Except for Agnes, all the servants in the Gobignon town house were loyal to him. His aunt, Queen Blanche, was forever praising him to all who would listen. If Nicolette were involved in scandal, the White Queen would be furious, and would see to it that word reached Amalric. And if indeed he found out about her meeting the troubadour? Just a message, a song, let alone a meeting like this one, could mean death for her and Orlando. I should turn around right now, cross this bridge, and run back to the palace. The streets of the Latin Quarter were crawling with ruffians and criminals - it was insane for her to be walking here alone after sunset. The sight of the small knife she carried under her cloak might deter an attacker, but then she would be discovered. If I screamed for help, the whole palace would find out. Blanche would demand to know why I was here. No, she thought, her blood turning to ice, she would know why. But those eyes of his? to look into them again, was that not worth any risk? She stood, vacillating, in the shadows by a wooden house that overhung the Rue Saint-Jacques. I must see Orlando, she thought. Over a year now, and I have not been able to forget him.

Choices:  - accomplishment - injuries - enemies - rivalry - death  The rationale to choose \\"accomplishment\\" as the answer is that: Answer:","output":"People compete in sports primarily for the sense of accomplishment it provides. Accomplishments in sports can take various forms, such as personal achievements, team successes, and setting new records. Participating in sports allows individuals and teams to test their physical abilities, mental stamina, and strategic skills against others in a structured and organized manner. Sports offer numerous opportunities for individuals to set and achieve personal goals, which can range from improving personal fitness to mastering specific techniques. These personal achievements often lead to increased self-esteem and a sense of pride in one's abilities. Additionally, sports provide people the chance to compete with and against one another, fostering camaraderie and teamwork. Victories, both large and small, contribute to a sense of accomplishment and self-worth. Team sports, in particular, bring people together with a shared objective, encouraging them to work cooperatively toward a common goal. In team sports, success often depends on the collaborative efforts of all team members, and victory becomes a group accomplishment. This shared sense of achievement strengthens the bonds between teammates and creates lasting memories. Moreover, sports provide a universally recognized and respected platform for individuals to showcase their abilities and excel in their chosen field. Regional, national, and international competitions offer the highest level of recognition, often attracting top athletes from around the world. Success in these arenas can lead to fame, personal satisfaction, and a lasting legacy within the world of sports. While other choices, such as rivalry and injuries, may be associated with sports, they do not accurately capture the primary motivation for people to compete in sports. Rivalries can indeed make sports more engaging and motivate athletes to push their limits. However, rivalry alone does not explain why people start participating or competing in sports. Injuries, on the other hand, are often unfortunate side-effects of sports activities and don't serve as a reason for individuals to participate in sports. Enemies and death are not primary reasons or motivations for people to engage in sports; they are more related to negative aspects or consequences that can occur within the context of sports. In conclusion, the most accurate rationale for choosing \\"accomplishment\\" as an answer to why people compete in sports lies in the numerous opportunities for personal growth, team bonding, and increasing self-esteem that sports provide. Accomplishments enable individuals to showcase their talents, achieve personal and team goals, and receive recognition from others, ultimately leading to a richer and more fulfilling life experience."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

North Hunterdon High School grad takes a spin on 'Wheel of Fortune'      Published: Thursday, November 04, 2010, 8:27 AM      It’s “Wheel Loves L.A.” week on the popular game show. Tomorrow fans learn if the wheel also loves ’02 North Hunterdon grad Caitlin Burke.      Burke can’t say how she did until the show airs tomorrow on ABC at 7:30 p.m., but she can talk about how she got to spin the wheel on a show recorded on Sept. 3 in Los Angeles.      Burke and brother Tom IV grew up in Clinton Township, often watching games shows “Jeopardy” and “Wheel of Fortune” during dinner and competing against parents Robin and Tom. “I was always super competitive,” says Burke, and was regularly frustrated by her father’s skill at answering Jeopardy questions.      Successful contestants on “Wheel of Fortune,” she realized, had puzzle-solving skills that didn’t require a bank of stored knowledge, leveling the playing field. “After a while my parents told me I was really good at it,” she says of her ability to zero in on the right work or phrase.      One day in high school classmates took turns talking about their goals. \\"Someone would say, ‘I want to be a vet,’\\" says Burke. “I said, ‘I want to go on Wheel of Fortune.’\\"      But she also went off to college — Penn State, majoring in advertising with a minor in business — where she kept applying online to get on the show. It bothered her that the application called for name, address and phone number only; potential contestants have no room to explain their attachment to the game show.      After applying “dozens of times” and signing up for text alerts if the show were taping nearby, Burke was excited six months ago to learn that she’d been chosen for a “Wheel of Fortune” audition. On the appointed day and time she showed up, along with a “couple of hundred other people” at a hotel conference area. “I think this is what ‘American Idol’ is like,” she said of the crowd and its expectations.      Unlike the talent search TV show, the Wheel auditions started with group rounds followed by cuts then quizzes followed by cuts. Burke, a former competitive cheerleader, advanced far enough to finally get the opportunity to talk about herself. “Be yourself,” Burke advises. “Let your enthusiasm shine through.”      She said that the “handful” of people left at the end expected to hear from the show within a week if they’d been tapped for a taping in Las Vegas, or within a month if they were headed to Los Angeles.      Thirty days came and went and when there was no phone call or letter, Burke admits that she was so disappointed that she stopped watching the show. Then a thin envelope arrived. Fearing that it was a rejection letter, Burke opened it to learn that her taping would take place the Friday before Labor Day, two weeks away.      Contestants on “Wheel of Fortune” pay their own travel expenses and are allowed four guests in the audience. Burke’s mom, dad and brother all booked a flight, along with her boyfriend. Burke travels frequently to Los Angeles on business — she’s a fashion editor for international editions of Hearst publication magazines — and had a free flight because she’d been bumped from an overbooked plane.      Competing in front of an audience was just as exciting as Burke had imagined. “The wheel is so iconic. It’s something I always wanted to do!” she said. That prize wheel is also “very heavy:” contestants are coached on the “dos” and “don’ts.” For instance, no slippery hand lotion or rings on the hand that will spin the wheel. Lean in, pull it, then push away. “I was in a skirt and I was worried about having to lean over so much, but you don’t want a wimpy spin,” said Burke.      Extremely nervous before the cameras started rolling, Burke said that she knew that was her biggest hurdle to overcome. She did it by pretending that she was home, playing the game in her living room with friends. Then her competitive personality kicked in and she had to remind herself that “everyone can win,” telling herself to “wish everyone well” while hoping that she would do the best. ||||| This has to be the luckiest (and most ironic) \\"Wheel Of Fortune\\" guess ever made. With just one letter \\"L\\" and the clue \\"phrase,\\" a contestant named Caitlin makes a bold move (by \\"WoF\\" standards) and asks to solve the puzzle.

Movie title: The Kingdom Movie plot: The opening scene of the movie explains how oil drilling has transformed the Middle East and abroad in a timeline sequence. It portrays the conflicts that have risen since the late 1940's for the rightful ownership of the Oil Industry. This includes the United States's involvement in Iraq and al-Qaeda's growing network of terrorism. Eventually, it explains the 9/11 terrorism attacks and how 80% of the hijackers were Saudis. This raises serious questions on the relationship between Saudi and the United States. The plot begins with the current struggle of Saudi Arabia and the Kingdom's efforts to stand control of their country against terrorist extremists.During a game of softball played by American citizens in their oil company's housing compound, terrorists set off a bomb, killing many Americans, as well as Saudi State Police. The terrorists impersonated Saudi State Police members and while one team hijacked a car and started shooting residents of the area, another runs out onto the baseball diamond, pretending to aid the Americans, but then reveals that he is a suicide bomber and blows himself up, along with everyone near him. Sergeant Haytham of the Saudi State Police, disables the stolen SSP vehicle and kills the occupants. The FBI's Legal Attache in Saudi Arabia, Special Agent Francis Manner, calls up his colleague Special Agent Ronald Fleury (Jamie Foxx) to tell him about the attack. Shortly after this a second bomb explodes in the compound killing more people, including Manner.Back in the U.S., Fleury briefs his FBI team on the happenings in the Kingdom, and Special Agent Janet Mayes (Jennifer Garner), a forensic examiner, breaks down in tears upon hearing of Francis's death. Fleury whispers something into her ear which causes her to control her emotions. While the higher-ups deny them permission to visit, Fleury blackmails the Saudi ambassador into letting them use a Saudi plane to get into the country in order to conduct an investigation.

The building will be located in the prime Lujiazui Zone in Pudong , on a 30,000-square-metre site. The building was originally designed to be a 94-floor office tower with a height of 460 metres. The project broke ground in 1997 but was later halted as a result of the financial crisis in Southeast Asia. \\"As the economy warms up, we are more confident about Shanghai and the whole prefix = st1 /Chinaand we are working hard to get the Project restarted as soon as possible,\\" said Katsuyuki Takeuchi, vice-president and general manager of the  Shanghai World Financial Centre Company. Its parent company, Japan-based Moil Building Co. Ltd, established the Shanghaisubsidiary as the operator responsible for this ambitious project. The design, which is undergoing revision in apian, will accommodate international  high-tech  businesses, department stores, art galleries, clubs and a five-star hotel. Unlike the gloomy economies of theUnited States, Europe andJapan,Chinaenjoys a strong growth with brighter prospects, Takeuchi said. More capital and businesses are expected to flow into Shanghai, which aims to become a world centre for trade and the financial industry--with Lujiazui as its showpiece. The layout of Luijiazui includes three tall buildings, one of which is the completed JinmaoTower, each rising above 400 metres, as designed by local government after holding an international design competition early last decade. Other buildings nearby fall in height gradually, creating a special shape against the skyline. The Shanghai World Financial Centre will be built as the peak of the mountain. \\"The peak will be safe thanks to the perfect design, advanced technology and the stable social and political environment in Shanghai,\\" Takeuchi said, reassuring those who might be anxious about the safety of the soon-to-be world's tallest building. Options: A Because it is by the bank of the ChangjiangRiver. B Because it is going to be the highest building in China. C Because the economy of Chinais of a better future than of  other countries.

It is a masculine noun, and when paired with \\"většina,\\" it takes the genitive plural case, which is why it takes the form \\"průzkumů.\\" - ukazuje (shows) - This word is the 3rd person singular form of the verb \\"ukazovat,\\" which means \\"to show\\" or \\"to indicate\\" in English. - velkou (large) - This is an adjective meaning \\"large\\" or \\"big\\" in English. When it modifies a feminine noun in the accusative case, it takes the form \\"velkou.\\" - většinu (majority) - This is the feminine noun \\"většina,\\" meaning \\"majority\\" in English. To agree with \\"velkou,\\" it takes the accusative singular form, which is \\"většinu.\\" - proti (against) - This word is a preposition meaning \\"against,\\" \\"opposed to,\\" or \\"in opposition to\\" in English.

Ocean County resident and New Jersey police officer Lieutenant Laurel Hester, a 23-year veteran of the police force, has been diagnosed with terminal lung cancer, and expected to live only one year, she wishes to pass on her pension to her domestic partner of five years, Stacie Andree. Although New Jersey counties have the option to extend pension benefits to domestic partners, Ocean County Freeholders will not do this. In protest, the state's LGBT civil rights organization, Garden State Equality, organizes hundreds of people to speak out at each of the Freeholders' meetings. The crowds Garden State Equality organizes get bigger and more vociferous at each meeting.Among those speaking out are Laurel's police colleagues and Ocean County residents, describing Laurel's 25 years of exemplary work for the police department, and petitioning the Freeholders to allow her to pass on her pension to Stacie. Laurel's first police partner, Dane Wells, speaks about her and compares the situation to separate drinking fountains and seats at the back of the bus. Freeholder Joseph Vicari says that although they are \\"anguished\\" by Laurel's case, they are unable to change things because of state legislature and moves for an adjournment. The members of the public present are unhappy with this decision and some begin to chant \\"It's in your power\\".Outside the administration building, news reporter Ida Siegal explains the background to the case. In 2004 New Jersey passed the Domestic Partnership Benefits and Obligations Act which allows all gay and lesbian state employees to pass on their benefits, including the pension, to their domestic live-in lovers/partners.

In addition to having a fever, he exhibited symptoms of dehydration, including fatigue, confusion, and listlessness. His request to return to his unit was turned down by medical officers. The shells going over him bothered him. The next day he was worried about his buddy and became more nervous. He was sent down to the rear echelon by a battery aid man and there the medical aid man gave him some medicine which made him sleep, but still he was nervous and disturbed. On the next day the medical officer ordered him to be evacuated, although the boy begged not to be evacuated because he did not want to leave his unit.

Article: Your personality is the most important thing to work on, if you want to get people to enjoy being around you, but that doesn't mean that more superficial things should be ignored completely. Especially if you stink. If you want to be fun to be around, make sure you practice basic hygiene so others can stand to be in your presence.  Shower at least 4-5 times a week and change your clothes regularly. Change your socks and underwear every day. Wash your face, under your arms, and your hair regularly. Brush your teeth twice a day. . First impressions matter. If you're a 20 year old with an 8 year old's bowl cut, it's likely that you could be turning some people off of you before they even get a chance to know you. Get a haircut and learn to style your hair in a way that flatters your features and rounds out your face. Even if you go for an unkempt rockstar hair look, you've got to comb it every now and then. Nobody will want to hang out with you if you've got spiderweb growing in there. . While you don't need to wear what's popular, what's expensive, or what other people are wearing, it's true that you'll feel confident and happy if you're wearing clothes that make you feel confident and happy. That confidence will rub off on other people and make you fun to be around.  There's no one cool way to wear clothes, and what's cool will totally depend on who you are, how old you are, and your own sense of style. You can look cool wearing thrift store clothes or wearing clothes from the mall. Pick a style that makes you feel good. If you feel better and more confident when you rock a hoodie and skater shoes, do it. If you feel confident when you dress up, start dressing up every day. If you can't live without your Levi's, get five pair that match. . Develop a healthy interest in making your body work for you, in ways that make you proud. If you respect your body, people will see that you're a person worthy of being around. Find a physical activity that you enjoy and try to get in shape, as much as possible.  Not everybody has to play sports, or be cut rock climbers, but try to find something physical that you enjoy doing. Try doing free running, or skateboarding, or hiking, if you don't like traditional team-based sports. While it might seem like unhealthy vices like smoking, drugs, or alcohol can help you make friends, they won't help you keep friends in the long term, especially if you develop a problem with substance addiction. You want to be around people who have your best interest in mind, not people who want to screw it up. Practice healthy habits. . Nobody has a perfect body, or feels comfortable all day every day. But if you want people to enjoy being around you, try to put your self-consciousness and reservations about your body in the backseat and get comfortable being who you are. When you're young, it can be hard to figure out who exactly you are. Are you the kind of kid who picks up a guitar and dons a jean jacket and never takes it off? Are you the kind of kid who wears polo shirts and hangs out with the football team? Are you the kind of kid who games? There doesn't have to be a single answer to this question, and the more you're honest with yourself about your interests, your likes and dislikes, the more confident you'll be, and the more easily you'll be able to find friends who like you and want to be with you. Just because something is popular doesn't make it good. You don't have to be any particular way to fit in. If you love football and Magic: The Gathering equally, rep both at the same time.

As the man completes his cool-down routine, he expands his chest confidently and smiles into the camera, his actions speaking volumes about the transformative power of dedication and perseverance in any fitness journey. He addresses the camera, sharing words of encouragement and tips to stay motivated, hoping to inspire others to build healthy habits and make lasting improvements in their own lives. As he takes a step back from the camera, the man leaves viewers with a feeling of motivation and a renewed sense of possibility, demonstrating that anyone can achieve their goals, whether it involves fitness or any other aspect of life, through hard work, persistence, and a firm belief in oneself."},{"instruction":"Q: In this task, you are given a hateful post in Bengali that expresses hate or encourages violence towards a person or a group based on the protected characteristics such as race, religion, sex, and sexual orientation.

While it does mention that the seafood is great, the focus of the review is on the criticism of service and the perceived censorship of reviews. The reviewer even goes as far as downgrading the star rating due to the perceived negative experiences. To break down the review further, we can analyze its components: 1. \\"Don't criticize management too much in your review or they will have your review removed\\": This statement has a negative connotation since it suggests that management is open to censoring reviews, which can lead to a lack of transparency in terms of customer feedback. 2. \\"Great seafood\\": This part of the review is positive, commending the quality of the food offered. 3. \\"Atrocious service\\": This statement is clearly negative, expressing strong dissatisfaction with the level of service received. 4. \\"Was 3-star review, but is now 1 star for censorship\\": This part of the review is also negative, indicating that the reviewer felt compelled to lower their rating as a result of their supposed experience with censorship.

Adolf Hitler (German: ['adolf 'hItla] ( listen); 20 April 1889 - 30 April 1945) was a German politician who was the leader of the Nazi Party (Nationalsozialistische Deutsche Arbeiterpartei; NSDAP), Chancellor of Germany from 1933 to 1945 and Fuhrer (\\"Leader\\") of Nazi Germany from 1934 to 1945. As dictator, Hitler initiated World War II in Europe with the invasion of Poland in September 1939, and was central to the Holocaust. Hitler was born in Austria--then part of Austria-Hungary--and was raised near Linz. He moved to Germany in 1913 and was decorated during his service in the German Army in World War I. Adolf Hitler was born on 20 April 1889 in Braunau am Inn, a town in Austria-Hungary (in present-day Austria), close to the border with the German Empire. He was christened as \\"Adolphus Hitler\\". He was the fourth of six children born to Alois Hitler and his third wife, Klara Polzl. Three of Hitler's siblings--Gustav, Ida, and Otto--died in infancy. Also living in the household were Alois's children from his second marriage: Alois Jr. (born 1882) and Angela (born 1883). When Hitler was three, the family moved to Passau, Germany. There he acquired the distinctive lower Bavarian dialect, rather than Austrian German, which marked his speech throughout his life. The family returned to Austria and settled in Leonding in 1894, and in June 1895 Alois retired to Hafeld, near Lambach, where he farmed and kept bees. Hitler attended Volksschule (a state-owned school) in nearby Fischlham.  The move to Hafeld coincided with the onset of intense father-son conflicts caused by Hitler's refusal to conform to the strict discipline of his school. Alois Hitler's farming efforts at Hafeld ended in failure, and in 1897 the family moved to Lambach. The eight-year-old Hitler took singing lessons, sang in the church choir, and even considered becoming a priest. In 1898 the family returned permanently to Leonding. Hitler was deeply affected by the death of his younger brother Edmund, who died in 1900 from measles. Hitler changed from a confident, outgoing, conscientious student to a morose, detached boy who constantly fought with his father and teachers.  Alois had made a successful career in the customs bureau, and wanted his son to follow in his footsteps. Hitler later dramatised an episode from this period when his father took him to visit a customs office, depicting it as an event that gave rise to an unforgiving antagonism between father and son, who were both strong-willed. Ignoring his son's desire to attend a classical high school and become an artist, Alois sent Hitler to the Realschule in Linz in September 1900. Hitler rebelled against this decision, and in Mein Kampf states that he intentionally did poorly in school, hoping that once his father saw \\"what little progress I was making at the technical school he would let me devote myself to my dream\\".  Like many Austrian Germans, Hitler began to develop German nationalist ideas from a young age. He expressed loyalty only to Germany, despising the declining Habsburg Monarchy and its rule over an ethnically variegated empire. Hitler and his friends used the greeting \\"Heil\\", and sang the \\"Deutschlandlied\\" instead of the Austrian Imperial anthem.  After Alois's sudden death on 3 January 1903, Hitler's performance at school deteriorated and his mother allowed him to leave. He enrolled at the Realschule in Steyr in September 1904, where his behaviour and performance improved. In 1905, after passing a repeat of the final exam, Hitler left the school without any ambitions for further education or clear plans for a career. Did he live anywhere else during his childhood?","output":"Yes, Adolf Hitler lived in several places during his childhood apart from the ones mentioned previously. After the family's move to Passau, Germany, in 1892, they returned to Austria and settled down in Leonding in 1894. In 1895, Alois Hitler retired and moved the family to Hafeld, near Lambach, to try his hand at farming and beekeeping. However, their time in Hafeld was short-lived, as his father's farming attempts failed, and the family moved to Lambach in 1897. During his time in Lambach, Adolf Hitler attended a Catholic school and was actively involved in the church choir. He even considered becoming a priest at one point. In 1898, the family moved back to Leonding permanently. After the death of his younger brother, Edmund, in 1900, Hitler's behavior and performance in school began to deteriorate. His father continued to have expectations for Hitler to follow in his footsteps and work in the customs bureau. In 1900, he sent Hitler to the Realschule in Linz, hoping for him to pursue a technical education. However, Hitler's focus remained on his artistic ambitions. In September 1904, after further disagreements and deterioration in his behavior and performance, Hitler enrolled at the Realschule in Steyr. It was not until 1905 that he was able to finalize his secondary education, but with no clear plans for his future or further schooling. Throughout his childhood, the various locations exposed Hitler to different experiences and influenced his nationalistic sentiments, ultimately leading to his loyalty to Germany and disdain for the Habsburg Monarchy that ruled Austria at the time."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

On a side street merging   into this highway was a timid driver who was afraid to edge in and no one let her in. Some of the drivers backed up behind her and loudly blasted their horns. This made her more upset and nervous.  On the right of this side street, the signal on Pacific Coast Highway turned red and traffic stopped. A driver who saw what was happening to this woman stopped a few car lengths behind her car and motioned to her to pull in front of his car. She quickly did and as he waited, two more cars dashed in behind her car.  While the woman he'd helped waited for the signal to turn green, she sank into her driver's seat and was deeply relieved. Although this thoughtful man couldn't see it, her body language expressed her gratitude. If you've been in a traffic situation like the one she was in, you know how upsetting it can be.

This council consists of elected representatives from the city's different districts who collectively work together to create and enact laws, ordinances, and resolutions to guide the city's growth and development. The Manila City Council is composed of councilors elected from the city's six legislative districts. These elected officials serve three-year terms, and their primary responsibility is to address the issues of their constituents and represent their interests in the City Council. Working together, they represent the interests of the city's diverse communities and discuss potential by-laws, regulations, and policies that can improve the quality of life for Manilans.

The team intends to capture crime lord Tama Riyadi, who, along with his two lieutenants Andi and Mad Dog, owns the block and lets criminals around the city rent rooms under his protection. Arriving undetected, the team sweeps the first floors and subdues various criminal tenants; they also temporarily detain an innocent, law-abiding tenant delivering medicine to his sick wife in apartment #726. Continuing undetected to the sixth floor, the team is spotted by a young lookout, who passes on the message to another adolescent lookout just before he is shot dead by Wahyu; but the latter youth raises the alarm. Tama calls down reinforcements and the SWAT team are brutally attacked. Thugs snipe two officers guarding the perimeter, eliminate two more in the SWAT van, and ambush several officers patrolling the first five floors.

Context: WASHINGTON — Legal experts cast doubt Tuesday on a list of questions the special counsel purportedly wants to ask President Donald Trump, saying they would expect the veteran prosecutor to ask more and more pointed questions. The New York Times published the list of 44 questions it said special counsel Robert Mueller plans to pose to Trump as part of his investigation into Russian interference in the 2016 election. The newspaper reported that the list was compiled by Trump's lawyers based on questions that were read to them by special counsel investigators. The largely open-ended questions range from queries about Trump's firing of former national security adviser Michael Flynn and former FBI director James Comey, to general inquiries into what Trump knew about alleged coordination between his 2016 presidential campaign and Russia. While the list reflects the general line of questioning the special counsel's investigation is believed to be focused on, legal experts said the questions published are not what Mueller — or any prosecutor for that matter — would ask an interview subject. \\"It doesn't sound like questions that a prosecutor would typically ask, unless it was just a very general information-gathering type of inquiry, and they'd not limit themselves to only those question and reserve the right to ask follow-up questions,\\" said Eric Jaso, a partner at the Spiro Harrison law firm who served as an associate independent counsel during the Whitewater investigation of former President Bill Clinton. The questions, Jaso said, were likely written by Trump's own lawyers, based on a conversation with the special counsel about topics he wants to query. \\"If Mr. Mueller is going to interview the president, I suspect that he's going to ask rather pointed questions rather than having questions that would allow the president to basically give a narrative and potentially go far afield from the topics that they're trying to focus on,\\" Jaso said.

Generate a question that has the following answer:  A Boeing 747.  for the following movie plot:  Ex-fighter pilot and taxi driver Ted Striker (Robert Hays) became traumatized during an unnamed war, leading to a pathological fear of flying. As a result, he is unable to hold a responsible job. His wartime girlfriend, Elaine Dickinson (Julie Hagerty), now a flight attendant, leaves him. Striker nervously boards a Boeing 707 (Trans American Flight 209) from Los Angeles to Chicago on which she is serving, hoping to win her back, but she rebuffs him. After dinner is served, many of the passengers fall ill, and fellow passenger Dr. Rumack (Leslie Nielsen) deduces that the passengers have contracted food poisoning from the fish. The cockpit crew, including pilot Clarence Oveur (Peter Graves) and co-pilot Roger Murdock (Kareem Abdul-Jabbar), have also been affected, leaving no one to fly the plane. Elaine contacts the Chicago control tower for help, and is instructed by tower supervisor Steve McCroskey (Lloyd Bridges) to activate the plane's autopilot, a large inflatable pilot doll (listed as \\"Otto\\" in the end credits), which will get them to Chicago, but will not be able to land the plane. Rumack convinces Striker to fly the plane, though Striker feels unable to handle the pressure and the unfamiliar aircraft. McCroskey knows that he must get someone else to help take the plane down and calls Rex Kramer (Robert Stack), Striker's commanding officer in the war. Despite their hostile relationship, he is the best choice to instruct Striker. As the plane nears Chicago, Striker is overcome by stress and manages to land the plane only after a pep talk from Dr. Rumack.

Article: Mrs. Green's telephone number was three-four-six-three, and the number of the cinema near her house was three-four-six-four. So people often made a mistake and telephoned her when they wanted the cinema. One evening the telephone rang and Mrs. Green answered it. A tired man said, \\"At what time your last film begin?\\" \\"I'm sorry,\\" said Mrs. Green, \\"but you have the wrong number. This is not the cinema.\\" \\"Oh. It began twenty minutes ago,\\" said the man, \\"I am sorry about that. Goodbye.\\" Mrs. Green was very surprised, so she told her husband. He laughed and said, \\"The man's wife wanted to go to the cinema, but he was feeling tired, so telephoned the cinema. The man's wife heard him, but she didn't hear you. Now they will stay at home this evening and the husband will be happy.\\" Question: People often made a mistake and telephoned her when they wanted   _  . Options: A: to sleep B: the shop C: the cinema D: the visit A:","output":"The correct answer to this question would be C: the cinema. As it is mentioned in the article that Mrs. Green's telephone number was just one digit different from the number of the cinema near her house (three-four-six-three versus three-four-six-four), people often made the mistake of dialling her number when they actually intended to call the cinema. This is evident from the situation described where a tired man called her asking about the timing of the last film, mistakenly believing he has reached the cinema. Hence, option C is the one that fits the context appropriately.  Option A, to sleep, is not relevant to the details provided in the article, similarly, option B, the shop, doesn't match the context of the frequently made mistake as described in the article. It's clear throughout the writing that the calls Mrs. Green received were meant for the cinema, not a shop. Option D, the visit, is also incorrect as the article does not mention anything regarding people wanting to visit Mrs. Green or mistaking her number for someone they intended to visit. Further, we can reinforce the answer using the story of the tired man who thought he was calling the cinema to find out when the last show starts. Mrs. Green's husband finds humor in the situation by suggesting that the man was likely trying to convince his wife the movie had already started, hoping they would stay home instead since he was feeling tired. In conclusion, given the context described in the article as well as the direct evidence given by the callers' requests, option C (the cinema) is the most appropriate answer. The humor and irony of the story further establish the misunderstanding that Mrs. Green's phone number is the number for the cinema. It shows how a simple one digit phone number difference can lead to frequent, unintentional interruptions and some amusing situations."},{"instruction":"Q:This article: French painter Michel Marnet meets American singer Terry McKay aboard a liner crossing the Atlantic Ocean.

George Washington (February 22, 1732 - December 14, 1799) was an American statesman and soldier who served as the first President of the United States from 1789 to 1797 and was one of the Founding Fathers of the United States. He served as Commander-in-Chief of the Continental Army during the American Revolutionary War, and later presided over the 1787 convention that drafted the United States Constitution. As a driving force behind the nation's establishment he came to be known as the \\"father of the country,\\" both during his lifetime and to this day. Washington was born into the provincial gentry of Colonial Virginia to a family of wealthy planters who owned tobacco plantations and slaves, which he inherited. George Washington was the first child of Augustine Washington and his second wife Mary Ball Washington, born on their Popes Creek Estate near Colonial Beach in Westmoreland County, Virginia. He was born on February 11, 1731, according to the Julian calendar and Annunciation Style of enumerating years then in use in the British Empire. The Gregorian calendar was adopted within the British Empire in 1752, and it renders a birth date of February 22, 1732.  Washington was of primarily English gentry descent, especially from Sulgrave, England. His great-grandfather John Washington immigrated to Virginia in 1656 and began accumulating land and slaves, as did his son Lawrence and his grandson, George's father Augustine. Augustine was a tobacco planter who also tried his hand at iron manufacturing, and later he was the Justice of the Westmoreland County Court. In Washington's youth, his family was moderately prosperous and considered members of Virginia's \\"country level gentry\\" of \\"middling rank,\\" rather than one of the leading wealthy planter elite families. His wife Sally was also a friend of Washington and an early romantic interest, and maintained correspondence when she moved to England with her father, but most of the letters were intercepted by the British during the war.  Lawrence Washington inherited a plantation from their father on the Potomac River at Little Hunting Creek which he named Mount Vernon in honor of his commanding officer Vice Admiral Edward Vernon. Washington inherited Ferry Farm upon his father's death and eventually acquired Mount Vernon after Lawrence's death.  The death of his father prevented Washington from an education at England's Appleby Grammar School such as his older brothers had received. He achieved the equivalent of an elementary school education from a variety of tutors, as well as from a school run by an Anglican clergyman in or near Fredericksburg. His education totaled seven or eight years, while he lived with relatives at various places that included the Westmoreland and the Chotank regions of Virginia, as well as Ferry Farm and Mount Vernon. He was trained in mathematics, trigonometry, and surveying that developed a natural talent of draftsmanship and map making. He was also an avid reader and purchased books on military affairs, agriculture, and history, as well as the popular novels of his times. There was talk of securing an appointment for him in the Royal Navy when he was 15, but it was dropped when his widowed mother objected.  In 1751, Washington traveled with Lawrence to Barbados (his only trip abroad) in the hope that the climate would be beneficial to Lawrence's declining health, as he was suffering from tuberculosis. Washington contracted smallpox during the trip, which left his face slightly scarred but immunized him against future exposures to the disease. Lawrence's health failed to improve, and he returned to Mount Vernon where he died in the summer of 1752. His position as Adjutant General (militia leader) of Virginia was divided into four district offices after his death, and Washington was appointed by Governor Dinwiddie as one of the four district adjutants in February 1753, with the rank of major in the Virginia militia. He also became a freemason while in Fredericksburg during this period, although his involvement was minimal.

Can we repair a tube light or bulb which is dead? Choose your answer. Are these two questions paraphrases of each other? Available options: (a). no; (b). yes;","output":"(a). no These two questions are not paraphrases of each other. They address different aspects of the same subject: tube lights and CFL bulbs compared to regular bulbs. Let's answer each question separately. 1. Why is that a tube light or a CFL bulb has a constant glow where as the regular bulb doesn't? Tube lights and CFL bulbs have different working mechanisms compared to regular bulbs, which are incandescent bulbs. The constant glow in tube lights and CFL bulbs is due to the way they produce light. In a tube light, there is a phosphorescent coating on the inside of the glass tube which is filled with low-pressure mercury vapor. When an electric current passes through the vapor, it ionizes the gas and produces ultraviolet (UV) radiation. This UV radiation interacts with the phosphorescent coating, causing it to emit visible light. Since the UV radiation is continuously interacting with the phosphorescent coating, it results in a constant glow. CFL bulbs are compact versions of tube lights and follow the same principle of operation. They use an electronic ballast to regulate the flow of current, which is different from the magnetic ballasts used in tube lights. On the other hand, regular (incandescent) bulbs produce light by heating a thin filament wire (usually made of tungsten) until it glows due to a high temperature. When current flows through the filament, its resistance causes it to heat up and emit light. Incandescent bulbs cannot maintain a constant glow as efficiently as tube lights and CFL bulbs since they produce more heat than light (they have lower energy efficiency) and have a higher risk of burning out. 2. Can we repair a tube light or bulb which is dead? In most cases, it is not economically viable or practical to repair a dead tube light or bulb. However, one can sometimes fix certain issues in these lighting systems. For a tube light, if it is not lighting up due to a failing starter or ballast, these components can be replaced with new ones. The starter and ballast control the flow of electrical current in tube lights. If the issue is with either of these components, replacing them can restore the functionality of the tube light. In the case of a CFL bulb, repair is often not possible as these bulbs contain complex circuitry and are usually sealed. However, if the issue is with the ballast, which is external to the bulb in some cases, it can be replaced to see if the bulb lights up again. When it comes to incandescent bulbs, repair is usually not an option, as once the filament breaks or burns out, the bulb is no longer functional. Replacing the bulb with a new one is the best solution in this case. In conclusion, the constant glow in tube lights and CFL bulbs is a result of the distinct way they produce light compared to incandescent bulbs, and they are not paraphrases because they address the different aspects of this topic. While it is possible to fix certain issues in tube lights, repairing dead bulbs is typically not practical or economical, and replacement is often the more convenient option."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

This specialism of 19th-century academic art was among the special interests of this academic who taught at which University? Answer:","output":"To answer this complex question, we need to break it down into several parts: identifying the specialism of 19th-century academic art, pinpointing the academic particularly interested in this specialism, and determining the university at which they taught. 1. Identifying the specialism of 19th-century academic art: During the 19th century, academic art was characterized by its adherence to traditional artistic principles and techniques, with an emphasis on drawing, strict color palettes, and a flair for the dramatic. A notable specialism within this period was Neoclassicism, which focused on the revival of classical art from ancient Greece and Rome, and its ideals of beauty and harmony. Other specialisms, such as Romanticism, Historicism, and Orientalism, also held interest among 19th-century academic artists. 2. Pinpointing the academic particularly interested in this specialism: Several renowned academics were influential in shaping 19th-century academic art, including French painter and professor Jean-Léon Gérôme, who was particularly interested in Neoclassicism, Historicism, and Orientalism. Gérôme's works exemplified these specialisms, and he became a significant figure in the 19th-century art world, teaching and inspiring numerous artists throughout his career. 3. Determining the university at which they taught: Jean-Léon Gérôme taught at the prestigious École des Beaux-Arts in Paris, France. As a professor of painting, he educated students at this esteemed institution in the principles of academic art influenced heavily by Neoclassicism, Historicism, and Orientalism. Under his tutelage, many young artists developed their skills and went on to become successful painters following in the footsteps of their mentor. In conclusion, the specialism of 19th-century academic art under discussion is likely to be Neoclassicism, Historicism or Orientalism, with the notable academic being Jean-Léon Gérôme, who taught at the École des Beaux-Arts in Paris. The university in question here is the École des Beaux-Arts, an institution famous for its influence in shaping European art during the 19th century."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

(785 + 823 + 916)h = (521 - 76114) Since 785 + 823 + 916 = 2524, we can rewrite the equation as: 2524h = 521h - 76114 Now, in order to solve for h, we will isolate the variable h by eliminating the term with h on the right side of the equation. To do this, we subtract 521h from both sides of the equation. 2524h - 521h = 521h - 76114 - 521h Since 2524h - 521h = 2003h, we can now rewrite the equation as: 2003h = -76114 Next, we'll finish isolating the variable h by dividing both sides of the equation by 2003. h = (-76114) / 2003 Now, we will perform the division to find the value of h.  h ≈ -38.039 Therefore, the solution to the equation 785h + 823h + 916h + 76114 = 521h is h ≈ -38.039."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Step 1: Analyze the properties of vitamin C Vitamin C is known to be sensitive to light, heat, and air exposure. It can oxidize and lose its potency and effectiveness when exposed to these elements. Step 2: Assess the storage options. Option A suggests storing the face oil in a cool, dark place, which would protect it from heat and light exposure. Option B suggests storing it in a warm, sunlit place, which could increase the risk of oxidation due to heat and light exposure. Step 3: Choose the more reasonable method. Given that vitamin C is sensitive to light and heat, option A is the more reasonable method for storing vitamin C face oil. By minimizing exposure to light and heat, the face oil's effectiveness and potency can be preserved for a longer period."},{"instruction":"Given the question: Given this review: \\"I loved it Cool\\" Would you recommend this app to a friend?

Question: Title: Well Received Book by My 2 Year Olds Review: We bought this book for our toddler twin boys a few months before their first airplane ride. The book seems to focus on bringing the unfamiliar noises and experience of flying so that the child is prepared and less likely to fear the experience. Because our children happen to be fairly laid back, I thought the approach was unnecessary, and would have preferred a more \\"behind the scenes\\" view of flying: what's going on in the cockpit, the control tower, the ground crew, etc. Instead, it encourages the parent to enact the sound of flaps going down, the engine revving, etc.My kids enjoyed the book and I've had to read it hundreds of times. Does this product review convey a negative or positive sentiment? Answer:","output":"The product review conveys a mostly positive sentiment, with some minor suggestions for improvements. The reviewer begins by mentioning the context in which they bought the book - to prepare their twin boys for their first airplane ride. They then acknowledge that the book effectively focuses on familiarizing children with the noises and experiences associated with flying, which can help reduce fear and anxiety. However, the reviewer expresses a preference for a more \\"behind the scenes\\" perspective of flying, providing insights into what happens in the cockpit, control tower, and ground crew. This suggests that the book could have offered more comprehensive information about various aspects of air travel for children who are curious about these areas. Despite these suggestions for improvements, the review is predominantly positive, as the reviewer's children thoroughly enjoyed the book and the parent has had to read it repeatedly. This indicates that the book was indeed well-received by the 2-year-olds, as mentioned in the title, and that it has provided a positive reading experience for the children. In conclusion, while the reviewer has pointed out some potential enhancements, the overall sentiment conveyed in the review is positive, as the book has successfully engaged and entertained their 2-year-old boys."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant that follows instruction extremely well.

But I can use this background: In the U.S., the majority of electricity is produced by burning coal or other fossil fuels. This causes air pollution that harms the health of living things. The air pollution also causes acid rain and contributes to global warming. In addition, fossil fuels are nonrenewable resources, so if we keep using them, they will eventually run out. The main advantage of nuclear energy is that it doesn’t release air pollution or cause the other environmental problems associated with the burning of fossil fuels.

Please answer the following question: What were the names of the four men who were denied the Polar Medal?  Answer the above question based on the context below:  The rescued party, having had its last contact with civilization in 1914, was unaware of the course of the Great War. News of Shackleton's safe arrival in the Falklands briefly eclipsed war news in the British newspapers on 2 June 1916. The expedition returned home in piecemeal fashion, at a critical stage in the war, without the normal honours and civic receptions. When Shackleton himself finally arrived in England on 29 May 1917, after a short American lecture tour, his return was barely noticed.Despite McNish's efforts in preparing and sailing on the James Caird voyage, his prior insubordination meant that, on Shackleton's recommendation, he was one of four men denied the Polar Medal; the others whose contributions fell short of Shackleton's expected standards were John Vincent, William Stephenson and Ernest Holness. Most of the members of the expedition returned to take up immediate active military or naval service. Before the war ended, two—Tim McCarthy of the open boat journey and the veteran Antarctic sailor Alfred Cheetham—had been killed in action, and Ernest Wild of the Ross Sea party had died of typhoid while serving in the Mediterranean. Several others were severely wounded, and many received decorations for gallantry. Following a propaganda mission in Buenos Aires, Shackleton was employed during the last weeks of the war on special service in Murmansk, with the Army rank of Major. This occupied him until March 1919. He thereafter organised one final Antarctic expedition, the Shackleton–Rowett Expedition on Quest, which left London on 17 September 1921. From the Endurance crew, Wild, Worsley, Macklin, McIlroy, Hussey, Alexander Kerr, Thomas McLeod and cook Charles Green, all sailed with Quest.Shackleton died of a heart attack on 5 January 1922, while Quest was anchored at South Georgia. After his death the original programme, which had included an exploration of Enderby Land, was abandoned. Wild led a brief cruise which brought them into sight of Elephant Island. They anchored off Cape Wild, and...

Some characters have \\" nuclear \\" powers, which means that they've come in contact with some kind of substance that has given them super-human powers. This was especially popular during the 1940s in the \\" golden age \\" of comics when nuclear technology was on the rise. Can we draw the following conclusion? In the the post-depression era, it was common for superheros to get their powers from nuclear substances.","output":"Yes, it is generally accurate to conclude that, in the post-depression era, it was common for superheroes to get their powers from nuclear substances, particularly during the 1940s. This period, often known as the \\"Golden Age\\" of comics, saw an increased interest in nuclear technology, which impacted various areas of popular culture, including comic books. There are several reasons to explain this trend in using nuclear substances as sources of superpowers: 1. Technological advancements: During this time, the world was witnessing rapid advancements in science and technology, and people were fascinated with these new developments. The discovery of nuclear energy and atomic particle manipulation greatly impacted society. Integrating this concept into comic book stories was a way to tap into this fascination and curiosity. 2. Reflection of societal fears and hopes: The Golden Age was also a period of political instability, marked by the Great Depression, the Second World War, and the subsequent tensions of the Cold War. These events led to heightened fears of atomic warfare and the possibility of nuclear holocaust. By granting superheroes nuclear-derived powers, comic book creators could address these concerns while also offering readers the hope that such powers could be harnessed for good and would be under the control of virtuous individuals, who would use them to protect society from evil. 3. Creation of more dynamic and impactful characters: The idea of radioactive substances or accidents giving birth to superheroes offered an opportunity for writers and artists to create stronger, uniquely-abled, and more interesting characters. Nuclear powers often provided superheroes with a wide range of abilities, such as super-strength, flight, heat vision, and invulnerability, making them more appealing and thrilling to readers. Some famous examples of such superheroes include the radioactive Spider-Man, the atomic-powered Atom, the gamma ray-affected Incredible Hulk, and the nuclear hero Firestorm. Despite its dated concept today, the use of nuclear substances to create superheroes was a significant trend during the Golden Age of comics. It not only satisfied the curiosity nurtured by the era's technological advancements, but also addressed societal fears and hopes, while providing an engaging and fascinating array of characters to audiences who craved escapism and a sense of justice during a tumultuous period in history."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant, who knows every language and how to translate one language to another.

But knowing myself and my friends we wanted to drink a couple beers and do some fishing. We did just that. Later that night we had started out camp fire and cooked up some links before bed time. My drunk self wanted to keep the fire going all night to prevent wild animals from coming t our sight. Well at least I thought that’d help. So I needed a bunch of wood to do so. Everyone was asleep by this point but me. So I took myself out into the woods a little deeper to grab a full broken down tree.

Q:I have a new situation: John is studying the different states of matter. Today, he has a matter in three states in front of him, state A, state B, and state C. State A is in solid state. State B is in liquid state. And, state C is in gaseous state. He needs to determine the properties of each state.  But I can use this background: As Figure above shows, the distance between particles is much smaller for the solid and liquid states than for the gas state. In the solid state, particles are fixed in place, while particles are more free to move in the liquid and gas states. The particles in the solid and liquid states “stick together,” but in the gas state, they move freely about the container. In general, it requires energy to separate individual particles. If we want to make a solid adopt a liquid form, we can add energy in the form of heat, increasing the temperature of the substance. Conversely, if we want to convert a substance from a gas to a liquid or from a liquid to a solid, we remove energy from the system and decrease the temperature. Pressure also plays an important role in changes of state, which will be discussed later on. We will study these difference in greater detail in the chapter States of Matter.  What is an answer for this question: If energy is applied, state B would adopt which state, state A or state C?

The KMT considers both sides of the Taiwan Strait (including Taiwan), as (one) \\"China\\" and one country, whereas Taiwan's Democratic Progressive Party (DPP) considers only mainland China as \\"China\\" and Taiwan (ROC) as \\"Taiwan\\" and maintains that they are different countries.  - Henan is a province of the People's Republic of China, located in the central part of the country.

It is popular in Guangdong, Guangxi, Hong Kong, Macau and among the Chinese community in Southeast Asia. Like all versions of Chinese opera, it is a traditional Chinese art form, involving music, singing, martial arts, acrobatics, and acting. History. There is a debate about the origins of Cantonese opera, but it is generally accepted that opera was brought from the northern part of China and slowly migrated to the southern province of Guangdong in late 13th century, during the late Southern Song dynasty. In the 12th century, there was a theatrical form called the Nanxi or \\"Southern drama\\", which was performed in public theatres of Hangzhou, then capital of the Southern Song. With the invasion of the Mongol army, Emperor Gong of the Song dynasty fled with hundreds of thousands of Song people into Guangdong in 1276. Among them were Nanxi performers from Zhejiang, who brought Nanxi into Guangdong and helped develop the opera traditions in the south.  - Martial arts are codified systems and traditions of combat practices, which are practiced for a number of reasons: as self-defense, military and law enforcement applications, mental and spiritual development; as well as entertainment and the preservation of a nation's intangible cultural heritage.  - Chinese opera is a popular form of drama and musical theatre in China with roots going back to the early periods in China. It is a composite performance art that is an amalgamation of various art forms that existed in ancient China, and evolved gradually over more than a thousand years, reaching its mature form in the 13th century during the Song Dynasty. Early forms of Chinese drama are simple, but over time they incorporated various art forms, such as music, song and dance, martial arts, acrobatics, as well as literary art forms to become Chinese opera.  - Guangzhou , traditionally romanised as Canton, is the capital and largest city of the Province of Guangdong in southeastern China. Located on the Pearl River about north-northwest of Hong Kong and north of Macau, Guangzhou was a major terminus of the maritime Silk Road and continues to serve as a major port and transportation hub.  - Hangzhou, formerly romanized as Hangchow, is the capital and most populous city of Zhejiang Province in east China. It sits at the head of Hangzhou Bay, which separates Shanghai and Ningbo.

Education Secretary: Nicky Morgan said the Coalition would press ahead with its reforms to restore faith in A-levels among employers and universities. Education Secretary Nicky Morgan last night attacked Labour’s ‘flip flops’ over A-levels and pledged to push ahead with reforms to restore confidence in the exam. With this year’s exam results released tomorrow, she condemned her Labour counterpart for threatening to dismantle Coalition A-level reforms just two years after backing an overhaul. In a policy announcement yesterday, Labour education spokesman Tristram Hunt vowed to delay all A-level reforms until 2017 and allow teenagers once again to take controversial AS exams half-way through their courses. But the pledge came as details emerged of an interview with Mr Hunt two years ago, in which he decried AS-levels as a ‘waste of time’ and said he’d get rid of them because they created a ‘relentless examination system’. Mrs Morgan insisted the Coalition would press ahead with its reforms to restore faith in A-levels among employers and universities. ‘Parents, young people and teachers deserve better than Labour’s education flip-flops,’ she told the Mail. ‘Two years ago Tristram Hunt said he’d “get rid of AS-Levels” because they were a “waste of time”. Now he wants to keep them. ‘Labour’s plans to wind the clock back mean more exams and less learning. We agree with what Tristram said two years ago – that this is a waste of time. ‘Our reforms will ensure the qualifications young people work so hard for, once again, have the confidence of employers and universities.’ Under the current system, pupils sit AS-levels in the first year of the sixth-form and A2 exams in the second, with marks from both combining to produce the final A-level grade. Mrs Morgan’s predecessor, Michael Gove ordered AS-levels to be turned into standalone qualifications, with results no longer counting towards final A-level marks. Tests: Under the current system, pupils sit AS-levels in the first year of the sixth-form and A2 exams in the second, with marks from both combining to produce the final A-level grade (file picture) Most pupils will instead be examined at the end of their two-year A-level courses. Mr Gove also largely axed coursework and. ordered A-level courses to be rewritten with input from universities as. part of wider exam reforms due to be phased in from September 2015. Plans: Labour education spokesman Tristram Hunt vowed to delay all A-level reforms until 2017. But Labour disclosed yesterday it would delay all A-level reforms for two years to allow changes to GCSEs to bed in.  It will also scrap the centrepiece of the reforms – the downgrading of AS-levels. Mr Hunt, who will outline the plans in a speech next week, insisted the AS-level changes would ‘close the window of opportunity for many young people wanting to go to university’. The move would ‘turn the clock back on social mobility’ because disadvantaged pupils were in danger of losing out in university admissions without AS results behind them. ‘Having spoken to sixth formers across England, I know how valuable they find AS-levels in helping to shape their options and spur them on,’ he said. The pronouncement will fuel uncertainty in schools which are meant to start preparing to teach revamped A-levels from September this year, ahead of their introduction just four months after the May 2015 election. Dominic Cummings, who was a special adviser to Mr Gove, tweeted yesterday that Labour would in any case be unable to stop the reforms. What are highlight points for this article?","output":"1.

But, he adds, things soon got worse: The son who'd survived, Thomas \\"Bart\\" Whitaker, was later arrested and convicted for planning the attack with two friends, and he now awaits a Feb. 22 execution on Texas' death row. The Washington Post documents the elder Whitaker's rage in the hours just after the shootings, which had taken place as the four family members arrived home from a dinner out. As he stewed in his hospital bed, recovering from the bullet that had come within inches of his heart, Whitaker first vowed to \\"inflict pain\\" on the shooter, then started thinking on his faith and how God wouldn't want him to go down a path of vengeance. And so he decided then to forgive, \\"no matter who was responsible\\"—a promise made before finding out that Bart, in his early 20s, had helped mastermind the attack. Even though Whitaker and his extended family pleaded with the DA not to pursue the death penalty, prosecutors painted Bart as a sociopath who wanted his parents' money; he was convicted of two counts of first-degree murder and sentenced to die. The case of the now 38-year-old, who's been on good behavior behind bars and is about to earn his master's degree, underscores how victims should be folded into the process of doling out justice, Whitaker says. \\"This isn't just a case of a dad who is ignoring the truth about his son,\\" he says. \\"Believe me, I'm aware of what his choices have cost me.\\" The Whitakers have filed a petition with Texas' parole and pardons board to commute Bart's sentence to life in prison.","output":"Once upon a time, a man named Kent Whitaker had a wife, and two sons named Bart and Kevin.

But was it murder?  One of South Africa's toughest prosecutors, Gerrie Nel, has been fighting for most of this month to prove it was.  On Friday, one of the country's shrewdest defense lawyers, Barry Roux, was scheduled to begin convincing a judge that it wasn't.  Now he will have to wait.  The verdict will hinge on two questions:  Did the Olympic sprinter know his girlfriend was behind the door in the bathroom of his house when he fired four hollow-point bullets through it in the middle of the night?  And if he did not -- if he thought she was a burglar, as he insists -- did he act as a reasonable person would have?  Critical testimony will come from the only living person who was in the house at the time, the \\"Blade Runner\\" himself.

Did she fall back into her habits of self-indulgence, or did she run into ill-directed activity, selfish as her indolence, because only gratifying the passion of the moment?

Fantasize for a moment about living in the luxurious abode situated at 2708 North Lakeview Ave. in Chicago. Situated in the Windy City's coveted Lincoln Park neighborhood, this 7,000-square-foot home features six bedrooms, five baths and a ballroom. It's currently listed for 3.75 million. If that sounds like a bit much to cough up all at once, you could also consider renting the property for 170,000 a year. Now suppose you had the means to buy or rent. Which would you do? In Pictures: Best Cities To Quit Renting And Buy A Home One of the most useless truisms of the realty business used to go like so: \\"Renting is like throwing your money away.\\" Clearly this truism was patently false for buyers in 2006 and 2007. It turned out that buying a home in the U.S. in those years was like throwing money down a rat hole. Renting, by contrast, was a pretty savvy move. If you're pondering whether to buy or rent, you know the decision is partly an emotional one. If you detest landlords and have plenty of money to put toward a house, you may prefer the pride of ownership, regardless of how low rents go. On the other hand, if you plan to leave town in a year, the transaction costs involved in owning make it a prohibitive prospect. For most people, the choice is tougher. If you're settled in a hometown and want to make the financially smartest move, a few mathematical calculations should lead you toward an answer. First, you find a home you'd like to own and calculate its \\"capitalization rate.\\" A cap rate is the amount of rental income you would earn if you bought the house and leased it out to a stranger at the market rate. You express the amount as a percentage of what you'd pay for the house.

You will be given a task. You must generate a detailed and long answer. Sentence 1: The first Chechen war dealt the final disgrace. Sentence 2: The war ended with bloodshed. If the first sentence is true, then is the second sentence true?","output":"To determine whether the second sentence is true if the first sentence is true, we must analyze and understand the context and information provided in both sentences. Sentence 1: The first Chechen war dealt the final disgrace. This sentence implies a few things. Firstly, it refers to the first Chechen war, which occurred between 1994 and 1996, when Russia attempted to suppress the Chechen resistance seeking to gain independence from Russia. Secondly, it describes that this war led to the \\"final disgrace,\\" implying that the consequences of the conflict were considered humiliating or dishonorable for one of the parties involved, presumably Russia, who was unable to achieve their goal of maintaining territorial control over Chechnya. Sentence 2: The war ended with bloodshed. This sentence tells us that the war concluded with violence and loss of life. To analyze if this sentence is true if the first sentence is true, let's look at what we know about the first Chechen war and its ending. The first Chechen war was marked by intense fighting, numerous casualties on both sides, and the devastation of the Chechen capital, Grozny. After years of conflict, a truce was called in 1996, and a peace treaty was signed the following year. While the war did not conclude with the full independence of Chechnya, the Russian military was forced to withdraw, ultimately leaving Chechen rebels with de facto control of the region. Given the violent nature of the conflict and the fact that it eventually concluded with a ceasefire and a peace treaty, it can be inferred that the war did end with bloodshed. While the violence did not continue until the very last moment of the peace treaty signing, the fighting that took place throughout the conflict, including the weeks and months preceding the truce, can be reasonably considered as the concluding stages of the war. Considering the nature of the first Chechen war, one can deduce that both sentences are true. The \\"final disgrace\\" mentioned in the first sentence likely refers to how the war's outcome was unfavorable and humiliating for Russia, as they did not accomplish their objective and suffered significant losses. The second sentence is true in the sense that the end of the war was preceded by intense fighting and loss of life. Therefore, if the first sentence is true, the second sentence can also be considered true."},{"instruction":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

Question 1: Am I considered very blessed making 160,000 a year? Question 2: How do I make 100,000 in one year? Would the answer to these two questions be the same?","output":"Question 1: Am I considered very blessed making 160,000 a year? Answer 1: Whether an individual is considered \\"very blessed\\" making 160,000 a year is subjective and can depend on various factors such as geographical location, personal values, industry, and lifestyle preferences. However, from an objective financial standpoint, if we compare this income to global or national income standards, one could argue that making 160,000 per year is indeed a prosperous income. According to a 2021 survey conducted by the United States Census Bureau, the median household income in the United States was approximately 68,700 per year. Thus, earning 160,000 would place you in a significantly higher income bracket than the majority of Americans. Additionally, as per World Bank data, the global median income is much lower, at less than 10,000 per year. Despite this, it is essential to consider that the cost of living can vary across different regions, making this income more or less affluent depending on where you reside. In some high-cost metropolitan areas, 160,000 per year may be necessary for a relatively comfortable standard of living, whereas, in less expensive areas, it can afford luxuries and financial security. In conclusion, while personal values and location have a notable impact on the perception of being \\"very blessed,\\" earning 160,000 a year generally places an individual in a financially stable and prosperous position compared to most households and individuals globally. Question 2: How do I make 100,000 in one year? Answer 2: Making 100,000 in one year calls for strategic planning, dedication, and persistence. While there is no guaranteed method to achieve this goal, the following are valuable guidelines to pursue a six-figure income: 1. Education and skill development: Investing in your education will lead to higher-paying job opportunities. Pursue degrees or certifications in high-demand fields like technology, healthcare, or finance. Developing your skills can also be important, as specialized niches often command higher salaries. 2. Career advancement: Focus on career growth by seeking promotions or advancing within your industry. Be proactive in your professional development, attend networking events, and demonstrate a willingness to take on additional responsibilities. 3. Multiple income streams: Diversify your sources of income by considering part-time work, freelancing, or side hustles that capitalize on your existing talents and skills. This can include investments, rental property management, or entrepreneurship, among other opportunities. 4. Negotiation: Learn the art of salary negotiation to secure higher compensation packages or raises. Be prepared to showcase your strengths, accomplishments, and industry-standard wages to justify your salary requests. 5. Remote work opportunities: As remote work increases in prevalence, it may be worth looking for jobs based outside of your geographical area that pay higher salaries due to location. This can allow you to earn more without physically relocating. In conclusion, while the answers to these two questions are not the same, they both involve evaluating and understanding your income relative to living standards and personal expectations. Achieving a salary of 100,000 per year is an obtainable goal through hard work, career advancement, and diversified income sources."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

The special effects, including explosions and missiles, make the action look like a real thing.  \\"Independence Day\\"in 1996 took this type of movie one step further by blowing up the White House. This science fiction movie is about a war between human beings and aliens  from another planet. In the movie, the WorldTradeCentertowers are destroyed.

Soon after the attacks, many famous film companies stopped the planned releases of some of their new movies, especially if their films showed terrorist attacks or plane crashes. \\"Swordfish\\" was top of the American box office in June, 2001.

This limited-edition, seven-volume Bible offers a modern testament to the historical significance and power of sacred texts. Commissioned by a Benedictine abbey in Minnesota and completed in 2011, it has been in the possession of Pope Francis since April 2021. Now, the pontiff plans to return this priceless work of art to the United States, presenting it to lawmakers and the Library of Congress. The St. John's Bible: A Testament to Craftsmanship: A remarkable piece of fine art and sacred scripture, the St. John's Bible represents history and tradition in a modern context. It is thought to be the first hand-written and illuminated Bible produced since the invention of the printing press. Taking over a decade to craft, its completion in 2011 stands as a testament to the dedication and skill of the artisans and scholars involved. Comprising 1,150 pages, the St. John's Bible features English-language translations of biblical texts, rendered in elegant calligraphy by master calligrapher Donald Jackson. Beyond the written word, the Bible contains exquisite illuminations, a medieval technique of using gold leaf and vibrant pigments to decorate initial capital letters and accompany significant events in the text. These illuminations create a rich visual experience for readers and speak to the artistic heritage of sacred manuscripts. A Rare Treasure and Spiritual Symbol: The Apostles Edition of the St. John's Bible is one of only 12 sets in existence, making it an extremely rare and valuable cultural artifact. With this magnificent gift, Pope Francis honors the sacred tradition of Christianity while highlighting the importance of preserving and cultivating spiritual wisdom in contemporary society. Having received this exceptional Bible from St. John's Abbey and University in Minnesota, the pontiff's decision to present it to the US Congress and Library of Congress signifies the importance of promoting understanding, tolerance, and unity among different faiths and ideologies. By sharing this spiritually significant work, Pope Francis emphasizes the value of interfaith dialogue and cultural exchange. Implications for the US and the Global Community: Presenting the St. John's Bible to US lawmakers and the Library of Congress will enable greater access and appreciation for this stunning work of religious art. Housed in the Library of Congress, the Bible will join an extensive collection of historical texts, serving as a key resource for scholars, researchers, and religious seekers alike. Meanwhile, for US lawmakers, this valued gift serves as a reminder of the role public officials play in fostering unity, respect, and collaboration among diverse communities. Pope Francis, known for his advocacy of social justice and environmental concerns, further underlines the importance of compassionate and thoughtful leadership that transcends partisan politics. In a world grappling with cultural clashes, political divides, and religious tensions, the St. John's Bible embodies the universal values of love, truth, and beauty - messages that resonate across borders and beliefs.

Please tell me the sentiment of the following review: This story is told and retold and continues to be retold in every possibly way imagine. The immortal Charles Dicken's story has been recreated in every possible way imagine. I admit I have not seen the classic Alistair Sim version and I'm sure someday I will but I would be blown away if it touched even close to this amazing eighties version. I believe that if Dickens himself had created his story for film this would be it. The story is well known, I won't go into much detail because everyone has seen it in one form or another. A rich, stingy, mean, old man is visited by the Ghost of his former partner and warned about his mean ways. In order to straighten him out he is visited by three spirits, each which show him a different perspective of his life and the people he is involved with, past, present and future. Finally in seeing all this before him he realizes the error of his ways in a big way and attempts retribution for all the wrong he has done. George C. Scott is absolutely, undeniably perfect for this role. He takes hold of the Ebeneezer Scrooge role and makes it his own and creates an incredible character. He is not just a mean old man, but someone who has been effected by certain situations in his life that has made him bitter and angry at the world. There is compassion within him but he holds it below everything else and is very self involved. Scott delivers the role of perfection when it comes to Scrooge. Not only does the leading role make this film but everything else fits into place. This is a grand epic of Victorian England, Dickens England is recreated before our very eyes, the sights and the sounds and you can almost feel the breeze in your face and the smells of the market. Director Clive Donner brilliantly recreates this scene and leaves nothing to the imagination. I could watch this film on mute and be dazzled by the scenery. It's not spectacular scenery per se but it's real. The film takes us from the high class traders market to the very dismal pits of poverty and everything in between. The rest of the cast fits into their roles and brings their literary counterparts to life. Bob Cratchitt, played by David Warner and his entire family including and especially the young Tiny Tim played by Anthony Walters were wonderful. The Ghosts each had their own distinct personality and added to the dark mood of this story. A Christmas Carol is not a light story. Dickens wrote this story for a dark period in England's life and it's one of the few Christmas tales that is really dark, almost scary, and it has to be scary in order to scare a man who has been a miser for so many years into turning around. The dark feel to the story is captured in this film and is downright frightening and yet the end lifts your spirits and captures Christmas miracles. The score to this film is also something to be mentioned as it is epic and grand and beautiful to listen to whether it's the actual score or the Christmas music, everything fits together. Apparently Christmas movies are my favorite because I insist everyone see this Christmas Carol above all others. 10/10","output":"To determine the sentiment of this review, I will analyze the tone, words, and phrases used by the reviewer. 1. The first paragraph praises the Charles Dickens story and mentions the unique appeal of this eighties version, stating that \\"if Dickens himself had created his story for film this would be it.\\" This indicates a positive sentiment. 2.

Walking through my neighborhood on a fall afternoon reminds me of a time not too long ago when sounds of children filled the air, children playing games on a hill, and throwing leaves around in the street below. I was one of those children, carefree and happy. I live on a street that is only one block long. I have lived on the same street for sixteen years. I love my street. One side has six houses on it, and the other has only two houses, with a small hill in the middle and a huge cottonwood tree on one end. When I think of home, I think of my street. Only I see it as it was before. Unfortunately things change. One day, not long ago, I looked around and saw how different everything has become. Life on my street will never be the same because neighbors are quickly grown old, friends are growing up and leaving, and the city is planning to destroy my precious hill and sell the property to contractors. It is hard for me to accept that many of my wonderful neighbors are growing old and won't be around much longer. I have fond memories of the couple across the street, who sat together on their porch swing almost every evening, the widow next door who yelled at my brother and me for being too loud, and the crazy old man in a black suit who drove an old car. In contrast to those people, the people I see today are very old neighbors who have seen better days. The man in the black suit says he wants to die, and another neighbor just sold his house and moved into a nursing home. The lady who used to yell at us is too tired to bother any more, and the couple across the street rarely go out to their front porch these days. It is difficult to watch these precious people as they near the end of their lives because at once I thought they would live forever. The \\"comings and goings\\" of the younger generation of my street are now mostly \\"goings\\" as friends and peers move on. Once upon a time, my life and the lives of my peers revolved around home.

First, we want to combine the terms with 'n' in them. That's like taking some apple slices (25 * n) and some banana slices (-94 * n) and seeing how many fruit slices we have in total. (25 * n) + (-94 * n) = -69 * n. So our equation now looks like this: -69 * n + 414 = 0. Now, let's try to move the 414 (imagine it's a stack of Legos) to the other side of the equal sign. We can use subtraction to do that. If we subtract 414 from both sides, we get: -69 * n = -414 Now it's time to figure out what 'n' is! To do that, we'll divide both sides of the equation by -69 (imagine it's like sharing a cookie equally). n = -414 / -69 When we do the calculation, we find out that n is equal to: n = 6 So the solution to our little math puzzle is that n = 6.

Summarize this article: Defense Secretary Jim Mattis pauses before answering a reporter's question about the ambush of U.S. troops in Niger before a meeting with Israeli Defense Minister Avigdor Lieberman at the Pentagon, Thursday,... (Associated Press)      Defense Secretary Jim Mattis pauses before answering a reporter's question about the ambush of U.S. troops in Niger before a meeting with Israeli Defense Minister Avigdor Lieberman at the Pentagon, Thursday, Oct. 19, 2017, in Washington. (AP Photo/Alex Brandon) (Associated Press)      WASHINGTON (AP) — White House chief of staff John Kelly delivered an extraordinary denunciation of a Democratic congresswoman Thursday, accusing her of politicizing what he called a \\"sacred\\" presidential effort to console the grieving loved ones of a slain soldier.      Kelly, in an unexpected and emotional appearance in the White House briefing room, invoked the death of his own son, killed in Afghanistan in 2010, as he lashed out at Rep. Frederica Wilson of Florida, who earlier this week said that President Donald Trump had been disrespectful in his condolence call to the family of Sgt. La David Johnson, who was killed during an ambush in Niger.      Kelly, speaking slowly and forcefully, said he was \\"heartbroken\\" that Wilson overheard the conversation and used it to attack the president.      \\"I was stunned when I came to work yesterday and brokenhearted at what I saw a member of Congress doing,\\" Kelly said. \\"It stuns me. And I thought at least that was sacred.\\"      Kelly absolved Trump of blame, suggesting that the president did the best he could in one of the most challenging aspects of his job.      \\"If you're not in the family, if you have never worn the uniform, if you have never been in combat, you can't imagine how to make that phone call,\\" Kelly said.      Trump — who has frequently struggled showing empathy to those grieving, including those in Puerto Rico after the devastating hurricane — has emphatically rejected claims that he was disrespectful. But he ignited a storm of his own this week when he boasted about his commitment to calling service members' next of kin and brought Kelly into the controversy by wondering aloud if President Barack Obama had called the former Marine general after the death of Kelly's son.      Kelly confirmed Thursday that Obama had not called, but he made clear \\"that's not a criticism.\\"      \\"That's not a negative thing,\\" he said. \\"I don't believe all presidents call. I believe they all write.\\"      Kelly was not aware that Trump was going to reveal anything he'd said about the time after his son's death, according to a person familiar with the private conversations but not authorized to discuss them publicly.      Kelly did say that when Trump took office, he urged the president not to make those family calls, saying \\"I said to him, 'Sir there's nothing you can do to lighten the burden on these families.'\\"      But when Trump indicated he wanted to do so, Kelly revealed to him what General Joseph Dunford, now chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, told him when Robert Kelly was killed. Kelly recalled that Dunford said his son \\"was doing exactly what he wanted to do when he was killed. He knew what he was getting into. He knew what the possibilities were because we're at war.\\"      And Kelly added that Dunford told him that \\"when he died, he was surrounded by the best men on this earth, his friends. That's what the president tried to say to four families the other day.\\"      Kelly said the Defense Department is investigating into the details of the Oct. 4 ambush that killed four American soldiers.      Islamic militants on motorcycles brought rocket-propelled grenades and heavy machine guns, killing the four and wounding others after shattering the windows of unarmored U.S. trucks. The attack happened in a remote corner of Niger where Americans and local counterparts had been meeting with community leaders.      Kelly said Thursday that small groups of Americans are being sent overseas, including to Niger, to help train local people to fight the IS group \\"so that we don't have to send large numbers of troops.\\"      Hs speech was a rebuke to Wilson, who was in the car with the family of Sgt. Johnson when Trump called Tuesday. She said in an interview that Trump had told Johnson's widow that \\"you know that this could happen when you signed up for it ... but it still hurts.\\"      A spokeswoman said Wilson stood by her earlier comments. The congresswoman herself, asked by WSVN-TV in Florida about Kelly's remarks, replied only indirectly.      \\"Let me tell you what my mother told me when I was little,\\" Wilson said. \\"She said, 'The dog can bark at the moon all night long, but it doesn't become an issue until the moon barks back.'\\"      Kelly directed his criticism at Wilson, whom he also accused of grandstanding at the dedication of a Miami FBI office in 2015. But Johnson's aunt, who raised the soldier as her son, also told The Associated Press on Wednesday that Trump had shown \\"disrespect\\" to the family in the call they received as they drove to Miami's airport to receive the body. At the airport, widow Myeshia Johnson leaned in grief across the flag-draped coffin after a military guard received it.      The White House chief of staff said he was so upset by the congresswoman that he went to walk \\"among the finest men and women on earth,\\" a 90-minute visit to nearby Arlington National Cemetery, where he strode among the graves of fallen service members, including some who died under his command.      Kelly began his remarks by recounting in painstaking detail what happens after a solider is killed in overseas combat. The dead soldier's body is wrapped in a makeshift shroud by his colleagues, Kelly said, and then flown by helicopter to a nearby air base, where it is encased in ice. It is then flown to a second base, often in Europe, and put in more ice before it is transported to Dover Air Force Base in Delaware. The body is then embalmed and dressed in military uniform, complete with medals before heading home.      And, Kelly said, the next of kin are notified by a casualty officer, who \\"proceeds to break the heart of family members.\\"      Robert Kelly, 29, was killed when he stepped on a land mine in Afghanistan's remote Helmand province. His father, aware that the son accompanied almost patrols through mine-filled battlefields, had just days before warned the family of the potential danger, according to a report in The Washington Post.      Kelly on Thursday said that his family got calls from Robert's friends in Afghanistan attesting to his character. Those calls, he said as he fought back tears, were the most important.      After his dramatic opening statement, Kelly then took questions from reporters, asking first if any of them were Gold Star parents or siblings, meaning relatives of slain service members. When no one raised a hand, Kelly then said he would take questions only from those who knew a Gold Star family.      Kelly, whose frustrations with the distractions created by Trump on other subjects led him to deny last week that he was considering quitting, also bemoaned how the nation no longer held things sacred, from life to religion to women. He also said the sacredness over Gold Star families \\"left in the convention over the summer,\\" an apparent reference to the vocal campaign battle between the Khan family and Trump.      ___      Lemire reported from New York.

Frederica Wilson of being ‘selfish’ for attacking Trump’s language during the call.      White House chief of staff John Kelly on Thursday forcefully and emotionally defended President Donald Trump’s call to the widow of a U.S. soldier recently killed in Niger, accusing a Florida congresswoman of being “selfish” for attacking Trump’s language during the condolence call.      “I was stunned when I came to work yesterday morning and brokenhearted at what I saw a member of Congress doing,” Kelly told reporters at Thursday’s White House press briefing. “A member of Congress who listened in on a phone call from the president of the United States to a young wife — and in his way tried to express that opinion that he’s a brave man, a fallen hero.”      Story Continued Below      “He knew what he was getting himself into because he enlisted,” Kelly continued, referring to slain Sgt. La David Johnson. “There’s no reason to enlist. He enlisted, and he was where he wanted to be, exactly where he wanted to be with exactly the people he wanted to be with when his life was taken. That was the message.”      Rep. Frederica Wilson (D-Fla.), who had a personal relationship with Johnson through her program for disadvantaged black boys in Miami, recounted to reporters this week that Trump told Johnson’s widow in a condolence call that he knew what he signed up for, a remark she framed as an insensitive comment the commander in chief lobbed at a grieving widow.      She said she heard part of the conversation over speakerphone and said others were listening, too, including Johnson’s mother, who told The Washington Post that Trump had disrespected her family.      “John Kelly’s trying to keep his job,” Wilson told POLITICO on Thursday. “He will say anything.

Trump rejected the congresswoman’s account via Twitter on Wednesday morning, alleging that she “totally fabricated what I said” while claiming to have proof. Kelly, who was present during the president’s call, did not deny that Trump had said those words.      The former Marine general told reporters he initially advised Trump against making calls like those he made this week to the families of four soldiers who were killed earlier this month in an ambush in Niger. Kelly invoked his own experience of his son being killed in Afghanistan in 2010 to explain his view on the emotionally charged issue.      “If you elect to call a family like this, it is about the most difficult thing you could imagine. There’s no perfect way to make that phone call,” Kelly said. “When I took this job and talked to President Trump about how to do it, my first recommendation was he not do it. Because it’s not the phone call that parents, family members, are looking forward to.”      Kelly confirmed what Trump and later White House officials told reporters earlier this week: that former President Barack Obama did not call him after his son died after stepping on a landmine in Afghanistan.      “He asked me about previous presidents, and I said I can tell you that President Obama, who was my commander in chief when I was on active duty, did not call my family,” Kelly said. “That was not a criticism. That was just to simply say I don’t believe President Obama called. That’s not a negative thing. I don’t believe President Bush called in all cases. I don’t believe any president, particularly when the casualty rates are very, very high, that presidents call.”      Trump for days has been courting controversy over his handling of the Niger ambush and his treatment of the service members slain. He stayed silent on the Oct. 4 ambush until the issue was broached in a news conference Monday, when the president accused Obama and his predecessors of failing to call Gold Star families. The White House later maintained that Trump was accurate because previous presidents didn’t always opt to call, as some wrote letters or met personally with the families.      Trump stoked the furor when he invoked the death of Kelly’s son in a radio interview with Fox News on Tuesday, encouraging reporters to “ask General Kelly did he get a call from Obama.”      The president has been adamant that he has called “virtually” every Gold Star family who lost a loved one under Trump’s administration, though accounts have since surfaced challenging that notion.      Kelly detailed the process of what occurs when a soldier dies, from the immediate response from fellow service members to the casualty officer who “proceeds to break the heart of a family member” to contact from the commander in chief.      Kelly said the company commander, defense secretary, service chief and the president typically write letters to families.      “Typically the only phone calls the family receives are the most important phone calls they could imagine, and that is from their buddies,” Kelly said. “In my case, hours after my son was killed, his friends were calling us from Afghanistan telling us what a great guy he was. Those are the only phone calls that really matter, and yeah, the letters count to a degree, but there’s not much that really can take the edge off what a family member’s going through.”      That phone call can be especially difficult for a commander in chief like Trump, Kelly said. “If you’re not in the family, if you’ve never worn the uniform, if you’ve never been in combat, you can’t imagine how to make that call, but I think he very bravely does make those calls,” he said of the president.      Kelly said Trump had asked him what he should say to family members, so he told the president what his casualty officer said to him when his son was killed: “He was doing exactly what he wanted to do when he was killed. He knew what he was getting into by joining that 1 percent. He knew what the possibilities were because we’re at war, and when he died … he was surrounded by the best men on this earth, his friends.”      “That is what the president tried to say to the four families the other day,” Kelly explained. “It stuns me that a member of Congress would have listened in on that conversation — absolutely stuns me. And I thought at least that was sacred.”      The former homeland security secretary lamented that, in his estimation, women, religion and life are no longer considered sacred.      “I just thought the selfless devotion that brings a man or woman to die on the battlefield, I just thought that that might be sacred,” said Kelly, who added that he spent 90 minutes at Arlington National Cemetery to collect his thoughts.      Kelly, in his closing remarks, suggested that Wilson has a history of politicizing what should be sacred moments. He recalled attending a dedication for an FBI field office in Miami in 2015, recounting then-FBI Director James Comey’s memorial speech and remarks from three survivors of the 1986 firefight against drug traffickers that killed two agents.      “A congresswoman stood up, and in the long tradition of empty barrels making the most noise, stood up there in all of that and talked about how she was instrumental in getting the funding for that building,” Kelly said. “We were stunned — stunned that she had done it. Even for someone that is that empty a barrel, we were stunned. But, you know, none of us went to the press and criticized. None of us stood up and were appalled. We just said OK, fine.”      Kelly implored reporters to let this one issue remain sacred. “Let’s not let this maybe last thing that’s held sacred in our society, a young man, young woman going out and giving his or her life for our country, let’s try to somehow keep that sacred,” he said. “But it eroded a great deal yesterday by the selfish behavior of a member of Congress.”      Marc Caputo contributed to this report. ||||| Summary:","output":"White House Chief of Staff John Kelly has defended President Trump's condolence call to the widow of a US soldier killed in Niger, accusing a Floridian congresswoman of politicising the matter.

Another key development in the wake of the Forty Years' War was the emergence of a unified and powerful Arakan. The western littoral between the Arakan Yoma and the Bay of Bengal remained politically fragmented even after Pagan's fall. The coast was divided between at least two power centres at Launggyet in the north and Sandoway  in the south. The weakness became exposed between 1373 and 1429 when the region was first subject first to Avan and then to Peguan interference. Arakan was Pegu's vassal from 1412 at least until Razadarit's death in 1421. The restoration came in 1429 when the last king of Arakan, Saw Mon III, in exile since 1406, came back with an army provided by Sultan Jalaluddin Muhammad Shah of Bengal. Narameikhla again became king, though as a vassal of Bengal. The vassalage was brief. In 1437, Saw Mon's brother Khayi annexed Sandoway and Ramu, his overlord's territory, unifying the Arakan littoral for the first time in history.

In the late 1200s Marco Polo, the great explorer, is said to have seen rich Asians eating dishes of ice. Camels had brought the ice from distant mountains. Before it was served, the ice had been flavored with fruits. Marco Polo brought this new dish to Italy, In France cooks changed the ice recipe and made ice cream. At first, cooks tried to keep the recipe a secret. They wanted it to be a special dish for rich people. By the late 1700s, though, ice cream was sold throughout Europe and America. Some great Americans loved ice cream. George Washington was the first to buy a special machine for making it. When Thomas Jefferson returned from France, he brought an ice cream recipe home with him. Dolly Madison, wife of President James Madison, also liked ice cream, and she often served it at the White House. Actually, a famous brand of ice cream was even named after her. In the late 1800s, the ice cream industry began to grow. A way of keeping ice cream frozen had been found, so ice cream makers did not have to worry about ice cream melting anymore.

A. bed bath store  B. linen closet  C. walmart  D. bathroom sink  E. closet  The best answer is Answer:","output":"The best answer to the question \\"Where would you put a washcloth to clean it?\\" is D. bathroom sink. A washcloth is a small piece of fabric, typically made of cotton or a blend of other fibers, used for personal hygiene purposes. It is primarily used to wash one's face and body during bathing or as a tool for cleaning and wiping surfaces. To clean a washcloth, it is essential to have access to water, mild soap or detergent, and a suitable washing area. The bathroom sink is a practical and convenient location for this task, considering it is designed for washing hands, face, and other small personal items. In addition, the bathroom sink typically has faucets for regulating water temperature, making it easier to wash and rinse the washcloth thoroughly. Other options like A. bed bath store, C. Walmart, and E. closet are not appropriate places to wash a washcloth, as these locations are primarily concerned with the storage or sale of products, not their maintenance or cleaning. B. linen closet serves as a storage space for unused or clean linens, such as towels, washcloths, and bedsheets, rather than a place to clean them. Here's the recommended procedure for cleaning a washcloth in the bathroom sink: 1. Fill the sink with lukewarm water, just enough to submerge the washcloth completely. 2. Add a small amount of mild soap or detergent to the water. 3. Submerge the washcloth in the soapy water, gently rubbing and squeezing it to remove any dirt, stains, or residues. 4. Drain the sink and refill it with clean water for rinsing. 5. Rinse the washcloth thoroughly under running water or in the sink, squeezing it out several times to remove any soap residues. 6. Gently wring out the excess water from the washcloth. 7. Hang the washcloth to air-dry, preferably in a well-ventilated area, such as a towel rack or shower rod. In conclusion, the best location to clean a washcloth is the bathroom sink. It offers access to water, a suitable washing area, proper faucets for temperature control, and convenience when bathing or washing hands and face.

Nike spokeswoman Beth Gast said in a statement: \\"Tiger has apologized and made his position clear. Nike fully supports him and his family. We look forward to him returning to golf.\\" Peter Moore, president of EA Sports, said the company's relationship with Woods remains unchanged: \\"It was good to see Tiger address the public today, and we're supportive of his focus toward family and rebuilding his life.

His words stand on their own. We wish him and his family the best,\\" spokesman Michael Norton said in a statement. Not a single one of his remaining sponsors has aired a prime-time TV commercial starring Woods since Nov. 29, according to Aaron Lewis of Nielsen. That was two days after the crash that triggered the media frenzy over his extramarital affairs. By Steve DiMeglio, USA TODAY MARANA, Ariz.  Breaking nearly three months of silence, , his voice cracking and his eyes moistening at times, apologized Friday for having affairs and said he plans to return to the PGA Tour. When that will be, however, is unknown. Speaking for a bit more than 13 minutes from the clubhouse at TPC Sawgrass in Ponte Vedra Beach, Fla., near the PGA Tour's headquarters, Woods addressed about 40 people who were in the room, including his mother. His wife, Elin, was not obviously present. \\"Every one of you (in this room) has good reason to be critical of me,\\" said Woods, who was wearing a black suit and blue dress shirt. \\"I want to say to each of you, simply and directly, I am deeply sorry for my irresponsible and selfish behavior I engaged in. \\"As Elin pointed out to me, my real apology to her will not come in the form of words, it will come from my behavior over time,\\" Woods said. \\"We have a lot to discuss.

I just don't know when that day will be,\\" he said. \\"I don't rule out that it will be this year. When I do return I need to make my behavior more respectfully of the game.\\" The world's No. 1 golfer had not talked in public since his traffic accident on Nov. 27 triggered shocking revelations about his serial infidelity. His appearance Friday was tightly controlled. Only three reporters from wire services were allowed in the room where Woods faced a single camera. More than 200 credentialed media watched a live TV feed in the Sawgrass Marriott banquet room more than a mile away.

Golf is just like life, when you make a mistake, you learn from your mistake and move on stronger. That's the way he is. As a human being everyone has faults, makes mistakes and sins. We all do. But, we move on when we make a mistake and learn from it. I am upset the way the media treated him like he's a criminal. He didn't kill anybody, he didn't do anything illegal. They've being carrying on from Thanksgiving until now. That's not right.\\" Admitting he felt he \\"deserved to enjoy the temptations\\" that came with his fabulous success, Woods said he was solely responsible for his actions. \\"I am deeply sorry for my irresponsible and selfish behavior,\\" Woods said. Woods, his voice rising, also defended his wife. \\"I have a lot to atone for, but there is one issue I really want to discuss. Some people have speculated that Elin somehow hurt or attacked me on Thanksgiving night,\\" Woods said. \\"It angers me that people would fabricate a story like that. Elin never hit me that night or any other night. There has never been an episode of domestic violence in our marriage. Ever. \\"Elin has shown enormous grace and poise throughout this ordeal. Elin deserves praise, not blame. The issue involved here was my repeated irresponsible behavior. I was unfaithful. I had affairs. I cheated. What I did is not acceptable, and I am the only person to blame.\\" Woods also made a plea to the news media. \\"I have always tried to maintain a private space for my wife and children. They have been kept separate from my sponsors, my commercial endorsements. When my children were born, we only released photographs so that the paparazzi could not chase them,\\" Woods said. \\"However, my behavior doesn't make it right for the media to follow my 2 1/2-year-old daughter to school and report the school's location. They staked out my wife and they pursued my mom. Whatever my wrongdoings, for the sake of my family, please leave my wife and kids alone.\\" Woods said he was in treatment for 45 days and will return for more therapy, adding he has more work to do to resolve his personal problems. \\"I stopped living by the core values that I was taught to believe in,\\" Woods said. \\"I knew my actions were wrong, but I convinced myself that normal rules didn't apply. I never thought about who I was hurting. Instead, I thought only about myself. I ran straight through the boundaries that a married couple should live by. I thought I could get away with whatever I wanted to. I felt that I had worked hard my entire life and deserved to enjoy all the temptations around me. I felt I was entitled. Thanks to money and fame, I didn't have to go far to find them. \\"I was wrong. I was foolish. I don't get to play by different rules. The same boundaries that apply to everyone apply to me. I brought this shame on myself. I hurt my wife, my kids, my mother, my wife's family, my friends, my foundation, and kids all around the world who admired me.\\" As for his marriage, he said: \\"Every one of these questions and answers is a matter between Elin and me, issues between a husband and wife.\\" More than 1,750 miles away in Marana, Ariz., players still alive in the World Golf Championships-Accenture Match Play Championship welcomed Woods' message. \\"I think it was a sincere apology,\\" Luke Donald said at the Ritz-Carlton Golf Club in the hills north of Tucson. \\"He made it clear he wanted the media to leave his family alone, which I agree with. It sounds like he's getting the help he needs. Hopefully he'll be back on the golf course soon.\\" Stewart Cink, who lost to Woods in the Match Play Championship final in 2008, said Woods' speech was \\"heartfelt.\\" \\"It sounds like it's part of the recovery or the healing process that he has to go through,\\" Cink said. \\"I've got a couple of good friends at home that have gone through the alcohol abuse program with AA, and similar steps are taken in the healing process where you have to make amends to the people you've hurt, and you have to start the bridge to the other side. \\"It sounded like it was a difficult thing for him to do. Tiger's a tough guy, and like he said, he'll overcome this.\\" Ben Crane, who won the Farmers Insurance Open earlier this year at Torrey Pines in San Diego, where Woods won six Buick Invitationals and the 2008 U.S. Open, referred to one of his favorite stories in the Bible for his reaction to Woods' statement. \\"One of the first things that came to my mind is one of my favorite stories in the Bible which talks about a woman who has sinned and she's been a prostitute and everyone brings her before Jesus,\\" Crane said. \\"And they say shouldn't we stone her? Shouldn't we kill her for all these bad things that she's done? And Jesus says, yes, absolutely, stone her. But you without sin be the one to cast the first stone. \\"And you know what, I thought it was an amazing conference. I thought Tiger was very humble. And, you know what, I think we all love him as a golfer and as a family man. And we want to see what's best for him, and I think everything he did is going to help him get back soon and help him.\\" Notah Begay, a PGA Tour golfer and a friend of Woods' since the two met at Stanford University, was in the front row at the appearance. \\"I was emotional and got a little choked up,\\" Begay said. \\"The sincerity of his remarks and the thoughtfulness in his message was very apparent. It's tough to get any man in America just to go?to marriage counseling, let alone go into a 45-day rehabilitation. Plus he's going back (Saturday), and that tells me that he's trying to learn about the issues. \\"He's trying to learn about the thought processes that caused the actions, so that he can cut them off next time.\\" Butch Harmon, who coached Woods for 10 years, was at the Match Play watching his pupil, Nick Watney, play in the third round. Harmon said he had never seen Woods look so \\"humbled\\" in his life. \\"It was good to see him, that he is all right,\\" Harmon said. \\"Obviously, he appeared very humble. I think he has a long way to go before he plays again. Any type of rehab you go into is a long process and takes time, and he's just starting the process. I'm not sure he will play golf this year. \\"It was good to hear him say he wants to play golf again. I respect his right to privacy but I think he will have to answer some questions eventually. Bottom line, I don't think he has ever looked that humbled before. He is incredibly embarrassed, as he should be. He brought it on himself. \\"It was a very hard thing for him to do, which you could see in his speech and in his demeanor. It will be a long road back for him.\\" PGA Tour Commissioner Tim Finchem was in the room for Woods' appearance. Finchem believes Woods has taken a giant step forward in his road to healing and recovery. \\"I think if there's anything about Tiger Woods that's been evident over the last 14 years is that when he sets his mind to do something and he brings the attention and focus that he can to do something, he's been successful,\\" Finchem said. \\"And certainly that includes improvement in almost every area, whether it's his game, his business acumen, his presentation, his ability to talk on his feet. And he laid out this morning, I think, what he feels like he needs to deal with. \\"And from my personal perspective of watching him over the years, I give him an excellent chance to manage to do exactly that. I'll just take him for the roadmap that he laid out this morning and look forward to seeing how that progresses. … At the end of the day, he's a human being. We all make mistakes. We all have made mistakes. And when we're lucky, we learn from those mistakes and we get to be better people. And it seems to me that's the course that he is on.\\" You share in the USA TODAY community, so please keep your comments smart and civil.

Answer based on context: At the age of 32, Marshall won Supreme Court of the United States case Chambers v. Florida, 309 U.S. 227 (1940). That same year, he founded and became the executive director of the NAACP Legal Defense and Educational Fund. As the head of the Legal Defense Fund, he argued many other civil rights cases before the Supreme Court, most of them successfully, including Smith v. Allwright, 321 U.S. 649 (1944); Shelley v. Kraemer, 334 U.S. 1 (1948); Sweatt v. Painter, 339 U.S. 629 (1950); and McLaurin v. Oklahoma State Regents, 339 U.S. 637 (1950). His most famous case as a lawyer was Brown v. Board of Education of Topeka, Kansas, 347 U.S. 483 (1954), the case in which the Supreme Court ruled that \\"separate but equal\\" public education, as established by Plessy v. Ferguson, was not applicable to public education because it could never be truly equal. In total, Marshall won 29 out of the 32 cases he argued before the Supreme Court.

Summarize this article: The former station was closed and demolished in 2015 to make way for BBC Wales' new home at Central Square. The city council's new leader Huw Thomas said a replacement would be brought forward in fresh cabinet plans. It comes as BBC Wales' Week In Week Out programme asks how Cardiff will deal with an expected 80,000 new residents in the city over the next 20 years. \\"All will be revealed when I bring forward the cabinet paper in July - but be very clear - we will be delivering a bus station for Cardiff within my administration,\\" said Mr Thomas. The current council administration is in place for four years, but Mr Thomas insisted that was not the timetable to complete the new station. \\"It'll be less than that,\\" he stressed. The council has faced some criticism for allowing the previous bus station to be knocked down before a deal on its replacement was finalised with developers, Rightacres. Proposals for a bus station with 14 stands, cycle hub with 500 spaces and retail units on the site of the demolished Marland House and NCP car park were put to the council in February, but a decision was deferred ahead of local elections in May. Paul McCarthy, chief executive of Rightacres, told BBC Wales: \\"We've always said that this development wouldn't prejudice the delivery of a new bus station. \\"And there is a bus station coming. And I think that as part of 'the sell' [for the development], we presented that there would be a bus station, so we have a responsibility to deliver. \\"The way in which we deliver that, from a financial point of view, is that we have got to come up with the right mix of uses above the interchange, that makes it a positive equation. \\"At that point, we can deliver it.\\" But infrastructure, such as the bus station, is just one of the pressing issues facing the expanding city. According to Cardiff's local development plan, 41,000 new homes will need to be built over the next two decades - much of that on greenfield sites on the fringes of the city. One development, Plasdwr, will see 7,000 homes built by Redrow in the north-west of Cardiff, with the developer being asked to pay Â£28m towards improving transport networks, including bus and bike use. But Roger Tanner from Cardiff Civic Society said he feared the money was not enough - and would not deliver. \\"People don't like travelling by bus if they don't have to,\\" he said. \\"People will only use public transport if it's better than a private car, if it's reasonably priced and it's accessible. None of those things apply in this area.\\" A former planner himself, Mr Tanner said he feared the Plasdwr development would lead to \\"5,000 extra vehicle journeys\\" pulling on to already congested roads. But the city's council leader said he was confident there would be a change in how people commute. \\"We have to look at behaviour change, we have to look at delivering a modal shift in the way people travel around the city,\\" said Mr Thomas. He said he wanted to see a 50-50 split between car use and sustainable transport, including bus, bike and on foot. \\"What's critical is that we invest wisely to put those options before people and encourage them and give them the options to do that,\\" he added.","output":"Cardiff will get a new bus station, according to Huw Thomas, the city's council leader.

News article: Genesis founder Rutherford brings new Mechanics to Wilbur ‘It’s always worth mentioning that most band members start a solo career because they’re not happy in their main band,” Mike Rutherford says when asked why he’d stepped away from Genesis in 1985 to form a second band, Mike + the Mechanics. “In our case, we were having a gas with Genesis. But we’d been together for quite a few years, and it’s a bit like, let’s just try a bit of variety, make the page a little bit bigger. In a funny way, it helped keep Genesis going for a lot longer.” Rutherford, who’d penned the lyrics for such Genesis hits as “Follow You, Follow Me,” “Land of Confusion,” and “Throwing It All Away,” had already recorded two albums under his own name before founding the Mechanics. Fronted by singers Paul Carrack and Paul Young (who died in 2000), the new group launched its own string of hit singles, including “Silent Running (On Dangerous Ground),” “All I Need Is a Miracle,” and — biggest of all — “The Living Years.” That last song lent its name to Rutherford’s new memoir, in which he mingles his memories with passages from an unpublished memoir of his father, a career military man. Speaking by telephone from Tarrytown, N.Y., where a new Mechanics lineup would play that evening, Rutherford talked about the band, his memoir, and those pesky Genesis reunion rumors — which only intensified when Rutherford, Phil Collins, Tony Banks, Peter Gabriel, and Steve Hackett got together last year for “Genesis — Sum of the Parts,” a Showtime special now available on home video. Q. Genesis was at a peak of popularity in 1985 when you formed Mike + the Mechanics, and you’d also recorded under your own name. What prompted you to form a second band? A. Having sung on “Acting Very Strange,” I thought, you know what, I’m not a singer; I’m a songwriter, and I want a good voice to sing it. So I thought, let’s go and do what I like doing best, which is collaboration. I got a list of songwriters, and the first two were Chris Neil and B. A. Robertson — and that’s as far as I got [laughs]. Q. What prompted you to reunite the Mechanics now, and how did you find singers to fill the roles of Paul Carrack and Paul Young? A. We kind of stopped for about eight years after Paul Young — it was like the end of an era. Carrack and I thought, “We had a great time, that’s enough.” Then I wrote some songs four or five years ago that sounded a bit like Mechanics songs. And this time I knew what we needed: The Mechanics always had two singers, an R&B voice and a rock voice. I knew Andrew Roachford, who’s got a great R&B voice. Tim Howar has been in rock bands, and in the theater world, as well. Q. On the recent Genesis anthology “R-Kive,” Mechanics songs are set alongside Genesis tracks and solo cuts by Phil, Peter, Tony, and Steve. Was there a musical point you were all trying to make by gathering the flock under a single roof? A. The reason for doing it is a lot of people don’t tie it all in. People say to me, “Was Phil the drummer?” Or they say, “Was Gabriel in Genesis?” Or they say, “You’re in Mike + the Mechanics as well?” When we put the whole package together, it has a kind of continuity and shows the whole picture rather well, I think. Q. Genesis emerged from a smart, creative, and rebellious generation that came up in the wake of two world wars. When you mixed passages from your father’s unpublished memoir with your own experiences for your book, were you surprised to find connections with a father who’d had a distinguished military career? A. That’s one of the revelations in the book, really. You always reckoned that you didn’t share very much in terms of how your life went, but then doing the book, you realize that you did share more than you thought. You’re away from home a lot, managing children, managing home affairs, managing work, managing a team you work with. A book just about Genesis and what I’d done — it’s all out there, it’s all been written about. But I’ve had a huge fascination for a long time about that huge generational shift. The United Kingdom was an older, more established, stiffer country: empire days, commonwealth, two world wars. Until our era, young men at 21 wanted to become their fathers. There wasn’t any youth culture; there were no blue jeans and pop music and guitars. There was a huge change, I think. And in a sense, the story of what happened with the band against that backdrop is interesting. Q. Here we are in 2015, awash in renewed rumors about a Genesis reunion with Gabriel and Hackett. Why do you suppose people are so keen to see the five of you back together? A. I think people like a bit of history. First and foremost, as Peter said, we’re all still above the grass, which is a good starting point. There’s no plans for anything at the moment, that’s really the thing — but you never know what project might come along. The last tour with Phil wasn’t planned at all, really. Things just fall in a certain pattern, and you kind of just go with it. What are the most important parts of this news article?","output":"The news article is an interview with Mike Rutherford, founder of the bands Genesis and Mike + the Mechanics. The most important parts of this news article include: 1. Mike Rutherford explaining his decision to start a second band, Mike + the Mechanics, while still being a part of Genesis, stating that it was to explore variety and keep Genesis going for longer. 2. Rutherford discussing the specifics of the Mike + the Mechanics lineup, explaining the need for two singers with different vocal styles (R&B and rock). 3.

After menacingly circling around their bonfire a few times, Johnny dismounts and argues with Ali, revealed to be his ex-girlfriend. He destroys her stereo, prompting Daniel to stand up to him. Johnny quickly reveals that he knows martial arts, and he easily beats up Daniel, giving him a black eye. Daniel is humiliated and refuses Ali's help when she seems concerned. He attempts to hide the eye injury from Lucille by wearing sunglasses to school; when this fails, he lies and tells her that he fell off his bicycle. Daniel receives further humiliation during the soccer tryouts at his new school, when Bobby slide tackles Daniel, prompting Daniel to tackle him and land a punch to his face, which gets him expelled from the field.Although Daniel has some basic knowledge of martial arts via some YMCA self-defense classes, he decides he needs a refresher.

Write a title for this article: For decades, bypass surgery, in which surgeons improve blood flow to the heart by sewing new blood vessels to get around blocked ones, was done the same way. The heart was stopped while blood was pumped through a heart-lung machine to do the heart’s work. But doctors increasingly worried that the machine, the “pump,” might sometimes lead to strokes or memory problems or personality changes. Some privately called patients with those difficulties “pumpheads.” And so, in the last seven years, many surgeons began offering and patients increasingly demanded an alternative: off-pump surgery in which the machine was not used and doctors operated on a still-beating heart. Now, a large and rigorous study finds the old way is best. In the study, published Thursday in the New England Journal of Medicine, 2,203 patients were randomly assigned to have their bypass surgery on pump or off. Because the study was sponsored by the Department of Veterans Affairs, the patients were mostly men. A year later, those who had had off-pump surgery had poorer outcomes. Fewer bypasses stayed open and patients were more likely to have needed a repeat operation or to have had a heart attack or to have died. They were no less likely to have had strokes or difficulty thinking. “This is a big one,” said Dr. Eric Peterson, a Duke cardiologist who wrote an editorial accompanying the paper. “It’s a good study and the fact that it did not find superiority was key,” he added. Dr. Peterson added that he, like many cardiologists, expected off-pump procedures to be superior. Dr. Michael Lauer, director of cardiovascular sciences at the National Heart, Lung and Blood Institute, said he anticipated and hoped that the new study would dampen enthusiasm for off-pump surgery. “Bypass surgery is one of the most common operations in the world,” Dr. Lauer said. “As many as 20 percent of bypasses in the U.S. are being done off pump. This affects a lot of people.” Dr. Frederick L. Grover, the principal investigator for the study and a heart surgeon at the University of Colorado at Denver and the Denver V.A., said his group was analyzing the costs of the two types of operations. He said if there was a difference, it was slight. Patients who had their surgery off pump had fewer blood transfusions but spent slightly longer in the operating room. There were no significant differences between the two groups of patients in the time they spent in intensive care after their surgery or how long they spent on a ventilator or how long they spent in the hospital. Some surgeons who made off-pump surgery their specialty said they were not going to change. The results do not apply to them, they say, because they have extraordinary expertise. But others less invested in the technique said they would be doing less off-pump surgery. And that includes Dr. Grover. About 20 percent of the 225,000 to 250,000 people who have bypass surgery each year have it off pump. Off-pump surgery began to take off around 2002 when instrument makers began selling devices making the surgery seem feasible and animal studies indicated that heart-lung machines had the potential to cause problems. When they use a heart-lung machine, doctors clamp blood vessels closed, draining the heart of blood. They inject a near-freezing fluid into the heart. They redirect blood through tubes that can create tiny bubbles or small fragments of debris that might get into the brain. At first, it was not easy to do heart surgery without the pump. How, for example, do you hold part of a beating heart still while you work on it? Some surgeons improvised, using modified kitchen spoons and forks to hold the heart steady. And how do you sew blood vessels onto the back of the heart? Surgeons had to lift the heart to get to the back and then blood pressure would drop. Instrument makers soon provided special tools that made it easier to steady specific parts of the heart while surgeons worked. Some, like Dr. Aubrey C. Galloway, who is chairman of the department of cardiothoracic surgery at New York University Langone Medical Center, said he felt compelled to learn off-pump surgery and to do it primarily in high-risk patients. “There was a lot of market pressure and momentum behind this off-pump stuff,” Dr. Galloway said. “A lot of surgeons were pressured to do it in everyone. Patients were coming in and saying, ‘I’m worried about cognitive dysfunction.’ ” Now, he said, “the idea that people should go somewhere to get off-pump surgery is pretty much killed by this publication.” But Dr. Nirav Patel, a heart surgeon at Lenox Hill Hospital in New York, said he does off-pump surgery in 95 percent of his patients and he is not going to change. He said that even with the new equipment, off-pump surgery was difficult and that it had taken 100 cases before he got really good at it. He estimated that he had now done more than 1,400 off-pump operations and questioned whether the surgeons in the study had the necessary expertise. “I am an off-pump surgeon,” Dr. Patel said. “I am a big proponent of it.” It may be, Dr. Lauer said, that surgeons like Dr. Patel are so expert at the procedure that their results are different from those reported in the study. But, he adds, “from a policy point of view, what we really care about is how well will the procedure work in the hands of a typical surgeon.” The study involved typical patients and typical surgeons. Very few surgeons, Dr. Lauer said, “have achieved exceedingly high levels of expertise.” And, he added, the study shows that for all the reasoning about why off pump is generally better, “just because something makes sense doesn’t necessarily make it so.” Title:","output":"\\"Old Way of Heart Bypass Surgery Better Than New Off-Pump Method, Study Finds\\""},{"instruction":"Please answer the following question: I am trying to decide whether it's worth it to invest in this film proposal.

Article: As a public school superintendent , I believe the best way to prepare students for colleges and careers is to focus on providing instructional programs and opportunities that help them become good thinkers. To do this, teachers and actually everyone else in a community, should play a role as a \\"cognitive coach\\" to students, helping develop good thinkers among our youth. The best way for you to become a cognitive coach is to seek out and engage school children and adolescents in meaningful conversations. The objective here is to get kids talking about what they think, how they feel, and what they believe whenever and wherever you may find them. It may be in a classroom. It may be at the grocery store. It may be at a basketball game. It doesn't matter where as long as you engage students in a topical conversation and, hopefully, even a debate. Mainly, you want to encourage students to voice their opinion about things. Get them to take a position on \\"this thing, or that thing,\\" and ask them to support their position with evidence. Curiously enough, the simple process of engaging students in real life conversations and debates will serve to strengthen what they have learned in the classroom, and help them create their own knowledge about a subject or a topic. Learning indicates that a student has been exposed to material, understands the material, and can recall the information. Knowledge, on the other hand, goes beyond recall and includes information processing, application to other situations, consideration of meaning, and contrasting with other concepts. Naturally, the topic of conversation you engage in with one of your learners will differ from student to student, and in the level of complexity based on child's age and developmental level. Even a kindergartener has an opinion about things that are going on in his or her life. Engaging in conversation with any members of your learning community in ways that get at what they have learned and what they know will help them develop higher order reasoning...

My fraternal twins were born 2 months early. The staff had already stopped premature labor at six months gestation but it proceeded too quickly this time. Total labor 2.5 hours. Needless to say, they were tiny - female 2 lbs. 3 oz, male 3 lbs. 10 oz. Female was born dark blue - luckily, I was at the finest maternity hospital in this half of the State (McGee Women’s). They brought the female around to breathing, while I cried, thinking that she was dead. The twins were rushed to the NICU, too tiny to breast feed except with pumped milk through a feeding tube. Both were watched closely by doctors and nurses as they were not passing waste properly. The day it was decided that the male needed surgery, the female was discharged to home. The male was transferred to another very good hospital for surgery for a temporary colostomy. He was discharged to home after a week. What broke my heart was that I was allowed to visit him in the hospital but his older brother and twin sister were not allowed. Prior to his discharge, the staff instructed me in changing and maintaining his colostomy bag on a daily basis. He kept the colostomy bag until he was about 5 months old; back into the hospital for the colostomy reversal. The sign that I hung above their shared playpen said “Whatever doesn’t kill me, makes me stronger”. How did I cope with it? Mostly alone. The hospital offered group sessions for parents of severely premature infants. During the very first session, I had a zen realization that, once I realized that the circumstances were out of my control, I GAINED control of myself and my life. A bit like the Serenity Prayer. I shared that epiphany with the group and they looked at me like I had two heads. I had never heard of the Serenity Prayer and I’d been an atheist since age 13, so religion was not my go-to then, nor is it now. That realization helped. The twins are 37 now.

Help as much as you can. Information:  - Pop rock is rock music with a lighter, smoother approach that is more reminiscent of commercial pop music. Originating in the 1950s as an alternative to rock and roll, early pop rock was influenced by the beat, arrangements, and style of rock and roll (and sometimes doo wop), but placed a greater emphasis on professional songwriting and recording craft. The detractors of pop rock often deride it as a slick, commercial product, less authentic than rock music.  - Introducing The Beau Brummels is the debut album by American pop rock band the Beau Brummels. It was produced by Sly Stone, lead singer of Sly & the Family Stone. Unlike with most other debut albums of the era, ten of the twelve songs on this album are originals. The album peaked at number 24 on the U.S. \\"Billboard\\" 200 albums chart in 1965.  - Country rock is subgenre of popular music, formed from the fusion of rock and country. It was developed by rock musicians who began to record country-flavored records in the late-1960s and early-1970s. These musicians recorded rock records using country themes, vocal styles, and additional instrumentation, most characteristically pedal steel guitars. Country rock began with Bob Dylan and The Byrds, reaching its greatest popularity in the 1970s with artists such as Emmylou Harris, the Eagles, Michael Nesmith, Poco and Pure Prairie League. Country rock also influenced artists in other genres, including The Band, Grateful Dead, Creedence Clearwater Revival, The Rolling Stones, and George Harrison's solo work. It also played a part in the development of Southern rock.  - Lead guitar is a guitar part which plays melody lines, instrumental fill passages, guitar solos, and occasionally, some riffs within a song structure. The lead is the featured guitar, which usually plays single-note-based lines or double-stops. In rock, heavy metal, blues, jazz, punk, fusion, some pop, and other music styles, lead guitar lines are usually supported by a second guitarist who plays rhythm guitar, which consists of accompaniment chords and riffs.  - The British Invasion was a phenomenon that occurred in the mid-1960s when rock and pop music acts from the United Kingdom, as well as other aspects of British culture, became popular in the United States, and significant to the rising \\"counterculture\\" on both sides of the Atlantic. Pop and rock groups such as the Beatles, the Dave Clark Five, the Kinks, the Rolling Stones, Herman's Hermits, and the Animals were at the forefront of the invasion.  - A disc jockey (abbreviated DJ, D.J. or deejay) is a person who mixes recorded music as it is playing. Originally, the \\"disc\\" in \\"disc jockey\\" referred to gramophone records, but now \\"DJ\\" is used as an all-encompassing term to describe someone who mixes recorded music from any sources, including cassettes, CDs, or digital audio files on a CDJ or laptop. DJs typically perform for a live or broadcast audience, but DJs also create mixes that are recorded for later sale and distribution.  - Sal Valentino (born Salvatore Willard Spampinato, September 8, 1942) is an American rock musician, singer and songwriter, best known as lead singer of The Beau Brummels, subsequently becoming a songwriter as well. The band released a pair of top 20 U.S. hit singles in 1965, \\"Laugh, Laugh\\" and \\"Just a Little.\\" He later fronted another band, Stoneground, which produced three albums in the early 1970s. After reuniting on numerous occasions with the Beau Brummels, Valentino began a solo career, releasing his latest album, \\"Every Now and Then\\", in 2008.  - The harmonica, also known as a French harp or mouth organ, is a free reed wind instrument used worldwide in many musical genres, notably in blues, American folk music, classical music, jazz, country, and rock and roll. There are many types of harmonica, including diatonic, chromatic, tremolo, octave, orchestral, and bass versions. A harmonica is played by using the mouth (lips and tongue) to direct air into or out of one or more holes along a mouthpiece. Behind each hole is a chamber containing at least one reed. A harmonica reed is a flat elongated spring typically made of brass, stainless steel, or bronze, which is secured at one end over a slot that serves as an airway. When the free end is made to vibrate by the player's air, it alternately blocks and unblocks the airway to produce sound.  - \`\` Just a Little '' is a song by American rock group The Beau Brummels . The song is included on the band 's debut album , Introducing the Beau Brummels , and was released as its second single , following \`\` Laugh , Laugh '' . \`\` Just a Little '' became the band 's highest - charting U.S. single , peaking at number eight on the Billboard Hot 100 in June 1965 . It also reached the top 10 of the charts in Canada and Australia . Written by guitarist Ron Elliott with frequent collaborator Bob Durand , the song was produced by Sylvester Stewart , later known as Sly Stone . A live version of the song recorded during a 1974 concert was released on the band 's 2000 Live ! album . \`\` Just a Little '' has been covered by such artists as The Young Rascals , Them , Nils Lofgren , The Smithereens , and Frank Black .  - Beat music, British beat, or Merseybeat (after bands from Liverpool and nearby areas beside the River Mersey) is a pop and rock music genre that developed in the United Kingdom in the early 1960s. Beat music is a fusion of rock and roll (mainly Chuck Berry guitar style and the midtempo beat of artists like Buddy Holly), doo-wop, skiffle and R&B. The genre provided many of the bands responsible for the British Invasion of the American pop charts starting in 1964, and provided the model for many important developments in pop and rock music, including the format of the rock group around lead, rhythm and bass guitars with drums.  - Sly Stone (born Sylvester Stewart, March 15, 1943, Denton, Texas) is an American musician, songwriter, and record producer, most famous for his role as frontman for Sly and the Family Stone, a band which played a critical role in the development of soul, funk, rock, and psychedelia in the 1960s and 1970s. In 1993, he was inducted into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame as a member of the group.  - The Beatles were an English rock band, formed in Liverpool in 1960. With members John Lennon, Paul McCartney, George Harrison and Ringo Starr, they became widely regarded as the foremost and most influential act of the rock era. Rooted in skiffle, beat, and 1950s rock and roll, the Beatles later experimented with several musical styles, ranging from pop ballads and Indian music to psychedelia and hard rock, often incorporating classical elements and unconventional recording techniques in innovative ways. In the early 1960s, their enormous popularity first emerged as \\"Beatlemania\\", but as the group's music grew in sophistication, led by primary songwriters Lennon and McCartney, they came to be perceived as an embodiment of the ideals shared by the counterculture of the 1960s.  - \\"Laugh, Laugh\\" is a song by American rock group The Beau Brummels, written by guitarist Ron Elliott and produced by Sylvester Stewart, later known as Sly Stone. Released in December 1964 as the band's debut single, the song reached number 15 on the U.S. \\"Billboard\\" Hot 100 chart the following February. \\"Laugh, Laugh\\" was the first hit single to come out of the emerging San Francisco music scene in response to the British Invasion.  The song was later included on the band's first full-length album, \\"Introducing the Beau Brummels\\", released in April 1965.   - Psychedelic rock is a style of rock music that is inspired or influenced by psychedelic culture and attempts to replicate and enhance the mind-altering experiences of psychedelic drugs, most notably LSD. It may use novelty recording techniques, electronic instruments or effects, and sometimes draws on sources such as the ragas and drones of Indian music.  - Autumn Records was a 1960s San Francisco-based pop record label. Among the notable acts on its roster was The Beau Brummels, a band who released a pair of top 20 singles, \\"Laugh, Laugh\\" and \\"Just a Little\\".  - The Beau Brummels were an American rock band. Formed in San Francisco in 1964, the band's original lineup included Sal Valentino (lead vocals), Ron Elliott (lead guitar), Ron Meagher (bass guitar), Declan Mulligan (rhythm guitar, bass, harmonica), and John Petersen (drums). They were discovered by local disc jockeys who were looking to sign acts to their new label, Autumn Records, where Sylvester Stewartlater known as Sly Stoneproduced the group's early recording sessions.

Please briefly summarize this news article: Shy corncrake stages unexpected recovery in the Highlands and Islands Conservation groups, including RSPB Scotland, have since worked with farms and crofters to support the threatened species. Paul Walton, of RSPB Scotland, said the latest figures were “fantastic”, adding: “They are testament to the dedication of crofters, farmers, the conservationists working alongside them, and to the Scottish Government and SNH officials, who have helped target agricultural support to deliver this result for wildlife. \\"However, last year's fall in corncrake numbers was worrying and this bird remains highly vulnerable, so we can't afford to be complacent. Even though there has been an increase in numbers this year, we have so far failed to expand the corncrake's breeding range. \\"They are still found in only a few isolated areas of Scotland, mainly on the islands, so that's where we need to focus our efforts next. \\"We also need to bring together the methods we've used for corncrakes and apply them to other Scottish birds that are in trouble, like the curlew and the corn bunting, to help secure their future in Scotland.\\" Since 1991, a co-operative conservation programme has operated in corncrake areas with crofters providing cover vegetation at field edges, leaving grass fields un-cut or un-grazed until August, and using mowing operations that favour the birds' survival and breeding success. The corncrake population immediately stopped declining and began to recover in response to the subsidised programme, with numbers of calling males reaching a new high this season. The biggest single island population is on the Isle of Tiree, home to 396 calling males in 2014. Jamie Boyle, site manager for RSPB Scotland's Uist reserves, said: \\"The number of calling males that we've recorded this year has been very encouraging. \\"Corncrake populations really seem to have bounced back after a worrying decline in 2013, and that is a tribute to local crofters whose land management has provided these birds with the habitat they need to breed successfully. \\"The geographical spread is also extremely positive, particularly the robust population in Lewis which is an area that we were concerned about.” Summary:","output":"The corncrake, a threatened bird species in Scotland, has shown a surprising population recovery in the Highlands and Islands, thanks to conservation efforts by RSPB Scotland and local farmers and crofters.

Paul Walton, an official from RSPB Scotland, expressed the success as a testimony to the collaborative endeavors of farmers, crofters, conservationists, the Scottish Government, and SNH officials. However, he also warned against complacency, insisting on the need to expand the bird's breeding range beyond isolated areas, predominantly on islands.

The population, counted by the number of calling males, experienced a noteworthy peak this season. The largest concentration of corncrakes is on the Isle of Tiree, which recorded 396 calling males in 2014. RSPB official Jamie Boyle has revealed promising results this year, signifying a rebound in the corncrake population after a substantial dip in 2013. The geographical distribution of these birds has also broadened and is now particularly strong in Lewis, an area previously causing concern. Boyle commended local crofters whose land management practices offered the birds the right habitat for successful breeding. Also, Walton stated there is a need for these conservation methods, beneficial for the corncrake, to be deployed to support other vulnerable Scottish birds like the curlew and the corn bunting."},{"instruction":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

Article: The close-knit world of competitive Scrabble has been shaken by the revelation that one of the UK’s most high-profile players may have been sneaking a peek into the tile bag.      Former British champion Allan Simmons, 60, has been competing in Scrabble tournaments for more than 30 years and has written several books on the word game.      However, he has now been suspended from competition play after admitting that he “may have” broken rules designed to prevent cheating, The Times reports.      The rules of competitive play state that competitors must hold the tile bag no lower than shoulder height when they are selecting new tiles, to prevent any peeking - deliberate or inadvertent - at the letters inside.      A complaint was filed by one of Simmons’ opponents after a competition in June. An investigation by the Association of British Scrabble Players - which was co-founded by Simmons in 1987 - agreed that Simmons had performed “actions that led to a suspicion of cheating”.      In response, Simmons acknowledged that the tile bag “may not have always been strictly at shoulder height” during his tournament games.      Simmons also admitted that he might have violated another rule which dictates that players display their empty palm to their opponent before selecting a new tile, to prove that they are not employing any sleight-of-hand to slip unwanted letters back into the bag.      “While I believe I always showed an open hand before drawing fresh letters, if drawing one or two at a time I may not have always had an open hand for each dip in the bag,” he said.      The initial one-year ban was extended to three years after the director of the Scottish Masters competition also raised concerns about Simmons’ play in last year’s tournament.      However, the player insisted that any infraction of the rules was unintentional rather than an attempt to cheat.      Nonetheless, “the scandal was the talk of the association’s championships which ended in Nairobi yesterday,” says The Times.      Simmons told the newspaper that had decided to “rise above” the accusations rather than contest his suspension, which he said would be a “distraction” for the association.      “I had actually been winding down the number of tournaments I play anyway with a view to retiring,” he said. ||||| IT is a game where you have to watch your Ps and Qs, and a lot of other letters besides.      But now the genteel world of competitive Scrabble has been rocked after its Scottish champion was banned for allegedly cheating.      Allan Simmons, 60, The 2008 UK National Scrabble Champion, now has a large X next to his name after being told he can no longer play the boardgame competitively because he broke one of its fundamental rules.      When players draw new letters, it should be done in as open a fashion as possible with the bag held at shoulder height and the palms open to ensure there's no skulduggery going on.      The rule-book states: 'You must hold the tile bag as near as possible to shoulder level, and so that no tiles in the bag can be seen. Remove tiles in full view of your opponent.'      But Mr Simmons as found guilty by the Association of British Scrabble Players of 'actions that led to a suspicion of cheating' by keeping his bag lower than it should be and not showing his full hand.      READ MORE: Wordsmiths view for championship      Fellow competitor Lewis Mackay, 32, complained about Mr Simmons' breaching the rules following their match at the British Masters in Yarnfield, Gloucestershire, in June.      Mr Mackay said in his complaint that he was also concerned with Mr Simmons' techniques in last year's World Championship in Lille.      This led to Mr Simmons being banned for a year, only for the organisers of the Scottish Masters to contact the association with their own concerns, saying they had not raised the alarm before because of Mr Simmons standing in the game.      The 60-year-old is a highly-regarded scrabble author, co-writing every edition of Official Scrabble Words by Chambers, and Scrabble Trainer - published by HarperCollins which now produces the game's official wordlist.      Mr Simmons is a founding member of the ABSP and its president from 1988 to 1999, and chairman 2002-2006.      He has played Scrabble since he joined the London Scrabble League in the mid 70's.      He was Chairman of the Postal Scrabble Club in the 80's, organised Scrabble weekends from 1985-91 and has been running annual courses since 1985.      As a player, he won the British Matchplay four times (1987, 88, 91 and 2008) and the ABSP Masters twice (1994 and 2007). He has also played at five World Championships to-date.      He was also formerly a Scrabble newspaper correspondent, but lost this job after writing that his ban was akin to a footballer \\"getting a red card for a few seasons\\".      READ MORE: Scot hopes to clean up in major tournament      Mr Simmons has said he will not appeal against the decision, as he did not want to \\"distract\\" the association. He now plans to retire from competitive play.      However, he denied cheating, saying records of his games show he has suffered the same 'untimely bad luck from the bag as anyone else', The Times reports.      The former champion, who began playing competitively in the 1970s, said: \\"While I believe I always showed an open hand before drawing fresh letters, if drawing one or two at a time I may not have always had an open hand for each dip in the bag.      \\"Likewise, holding the bag may not have always been strictly at shoulder height. You have to remember that at the top level, games can be quite intense and there's a lot going through one's mind let alone remembering to religiously ensure tile drawing rules are followed meticulously.      \\"From the outset I have said that no one is beyond suspicion and complied fully with the investigative process.\\" ||||| Allan Simmons, right, admits that he may not always have held the tile bag at shoulder height as players are supposed to YUI MOK/PA; SUSANNAH IRELAND FOR THE TIMES      In the competitive world of vowels, consonants and blanks there are few bigger names than Allan Simmons.      A prolific author of Scrabble books, previous UK champion and former chairman of the World English-language Scrabble Players Association, he was at the top of the game. But now Britain’s best-known player, 60, has been banned from competitions for breaking the game’s rules.      The scandal was the talk of the association’s championships which ended in Nairobi yesterday.      At the heart of the controversy are the rules on selecting tiles from cloth bags used in timed matches. Before picking them, players must show opponents their palm with the fingers splayed to prove they are not secretly dropping unwanted letters into the bag.

The rules say you have to hold the bag with the letter tiles high up by your shoulder and show your empty hand to the other player before you pick new tiles. This is so no one can cheat by peeking or putting back the tiles they don't want. But Allan was not always doing this the right way, so he got banned from playing in competitions for a while. Even though he says he wasn't trying to cheat, he decided not to fight the ban and has plans to retire from competitive play."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant. User will you give you a task.

News article: Pennsylvania man who kicked, punched overheated horse charged A 20-year-old Pennsylvania man seen kicking and punching his overheated horse after it collapsed was charged Friday with animal cruelty, police said. The horse’s handler, Marvin Sensenig, could be seen in photos released by the Ephrata Police Department standing over the fallen animal in front of a wagon by the side of the road in Lancaster County Tuesday afternoon. Police said the horse had to be euthanized. A local resident had posted the same pictures to Facebook on Tuesday night, writing that she and her friend “watched as an Amish criminal beat a horse to the point it collapsed.” The post had been shared nearly 40,000 times Friday night, and an online petition to “help bring justice to this poor horse who had no voice” had drawn over 14,000 signatures. Mother accused of 'gifting' daughter to man denied bail request “The more people that know about it the more pressure to do something,” the petition said. “Perhaps then no other animal will share the same horrendous fate. Please put yourself in place of the poor horse, the fear, the agony that were his last moments.” Investigators said Sensenig had “used one horse to pull a farm wagon with a burden too great for a single horse,” according to charging documents cited by PennLive. “The horse became overheated due to the hot temperatures and collapsed onto the asphalt.” That’s when witnesses on Bethany Rd. in the borough 40 miles east of Harrisburg saw Sensenig kicking the horse in the stomach and the back of the head and punching it in the head, according to investigators. Firefighters hosed the animal down with water to try to cool it down, but the police officers and fire officials on the scene had to put it down.

Susan smoked for many years and is an admitted sun worshipper, whose habits Jeanne does not share. A new study of twins suggests you can blame those coarse wrinkles, brown or pink spots on too much time in the sun, smoking, and being overweight. Because twins share genes, but may have different exposures to environmental factors, studying twins allows an \\"opportunity to control for genetic susceptibility ,\\" Dr. Elma D. Baron, at Case Western Reserve School of Medicine in Cleveland, Ohio, and his colleagues explain in the latest issue of Archives of Dermatology. Their analysis of environmental skin-damaging factors in 65 pairs of twins hints that skin aging is related more to environment and lifestyle than genetic factors. But when it comes to skin cancer, the researchers say their findings support previous reports that both environment and genes affect skin cancer risk. Baron's team examined facial skin of 130 twins, 18 to 77 years old, who lived mostly in the northem Midwest and Eastern regions of the US, who were attending the Twins Days Festival in Ohio in August 2002. At this time, each of the twins also separately reported how their skin burned or tanned without sunscreen, their weight, and their history of skin cancer, smoking, and alcohol drinking. The study group consisted of 52 fraternal and 10 identical twin pairs, plus 3 pairs who were unsure of their twin status. From these data, the researchers noted strong ties, outside of twin status, between smoking, older age, and being overweight, and having facial skin with evidence of environmental damage. By contrast, sunscreen use and drinking alcohol appeared related to less skin damage. Baron and his colleagues say the current findings, which highlight ties between facial aging and potentially avoidable environmental factors--such as smoking, being overweight, and unprotected overexposure to the sun's damaging rays--may help motivate people to minimize these risky behaviors. Question: Which of the following is true according to the passage? Options: A: Jeanne and Susan share all the habits including smoking. B: Skin aging is related more to environment and lifestyle than genetic factors. C: Only identical twins can take part in the research. D: Sunscreen use cannot help people have less skin damage.

A: Jeanne and Susan share all the habits including smoking. - This is not true as the passage states that Susan smoked for many years and is a sun worshipper, which Jeanne does not share.

Trump's barrage of insults comes as Comey engages in a publicity campaign for his book, \\"A Higher Loyalty: Truth, Lies, and Leadership,\\" which is set to be released next week. The memoir promises a deep look at Comey's fraught relationship with the U.S. president who fired him, and whom Comey has accused of interfering in the independence of the FBI. On Twitter, Trump said Comey should be prosecuted. Trump's comments are in line with an online campaign, organized by his supporters, to discredit Comey. The Republican National Committee on Thursday launched a new website, Lyin'Comey.com, which features quotes from prominent Democrats who have criticized the former FBI director in the past. The GOP plans to fact-check Comey's book and use the website for \\"rapid response\\" to highlight any \\"misstatements\\" or \\"contradictions,\\" Fox News reports. Comey's book blasts Trump as unethical and \\"untethered to truth'' and calls his leadership of the country \\"ego driven and about personal loyalty.'' The book also contains several personal jabs at Trump, including references to what Comey says are the \\"bright white half-moons\\" under Trump's eyes, which he surmises were the result of Trump using tanning goggles. Comey also casts Trump as a Mafia boss-like figure who sought to blur the line between law enforcement and politics, and tried to pressure him regarding his investigation into Russian election interference, according to multiple early reviews of the book. Trump fired Comey in May 2017, setting off a storm of charges from Democrats that the president sought to hinder an investigation into whether his campaign colluded with Russians. The firing led to the appointment of Robert Mueller as special counsel overseeing the Russia investigation. Mueller's probe has expanded to include whether Trump obstructed justice by firing Comey, an idea the president denies. Trump has... According to the above context, answer the following question.

While they have some similarities, there are key differences in the order of events and institutions mentioned. Let's break down both sentences to better understand the distinctions: Sentence 1: He graduated from MIT in 1891, and then received a master 's degree from Harvard University in 1893. In this sentence, the individual graduated from the Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT) in 1891. After this achievement, he went on to pursue and receive a master's degree from Harvard University in 1893. The order of events is as follows: 1. Graduated from MIT (1891) 2. Received a master's degree from Harvard (1893) Sentence 2: He graduated from Harvard University in 1891 and received a Master 's degree in 1893 from MIT.

Kabul, Afghanistan (CNN) -- Afghan rage over the burning of Qurans by NATO troops continued Thursday even after a President Barack Obama apologized for the \\"error.\\" Afghanistan erupted in violent demonstrations after the troops burned the Islamic religious material at the beginning of the week. Two American troops were killed Thursday by a man wearing an Afghan National Army uniform, a U.S. official said, asking not to be named discussing casualties. The gunman is thought to have been acting in conjunction with a protest outside the base, the official said. In a letter delivered to Afghan President Hamid Karzai, Obama called the act \\"inadvertent,\\" Karzai's office and National Security Council spokesman Tommy Vietor said Thursday. \\"Any disciplinary action, if deemed warranted, will be taken by OPTIONS: - Afghan authorities after a thorough review of the facts pursuant to all law and regulation and in accordance with due process.\\" - Afghan National Army authorities after a thorough review of the facts pursuant to all law and regulation and in accordance with due process.\\" - Afghanistan authorities after a thorough review of the facts pursuant to all law and regulation and in accordance with due process.\\" - American authorities after a thorough review of the facts pursuant to all law and regulation and in accordance with due process.\\" - Americans authorities after a thorough review of the facts pursuant to all law and regulation and in accordance with due process.\\" - Barack Obama authorities after a thorough review of the facts pursuant to all law and regulation and in accordance with due process.\\" - CNN authorities after a thorough review of the facts pursuant to all law and regulation and in accordance with due process.\\" - Gingrich authorities after a thorough review of the facts pursuant to all law and regulation and in accordance with due process.\\" - Hamid Karzai authorities after a thorough review of the facts pursuant to all law and regulation and in accordance with due process.\\" - Islamic authorities after a thorough review of the facts pursuant to all law and regulation and in accordance with due process.\\" - Kabul authorities after a thorough review of the facts pursuant to all law and regulation and in accordance with due process.\\" - Karzai authorities after a thorough review of the facts pursuant to all law and regulation and in accordance with due process.\\" - NATO authorities after a thorough review of the facts pursuant to all law and regulation and in accordance with due process.\\" - National Security Council authorities after a thorough review of the facts pursuant to all law and regulation and in accordance with due process.\\" - Obama authorities after a thorough review of the facts pursuant to all law and regulation and in accordance with due process.\\" - Tommy Vietor authorities after a thorough review of the facts pursuant to all law and regulation and in accordance with due process.\\" - U.S. authorities after a thorough review of the facts pursuant to all law and regulation and in accordance with due process.\\"","output":"Given the context provided, the most appropriate option seems to be: \\"- American authorities after a thorough review of the facts pursuant to all law and regulation and in accordance with due process.\\" The rationale behind this choice can be comprehended better if we delve into the complexities and politico-legal implications surrounding the incident. The burning of the Islamic Qurans was inadvertently done by NATO troops, among which the United States plays a significant role. Hence, the grievous nature of this mistake, which resulted in violent protests and loss of life, necessitates a serious response from the responsible party's authoritative body - in this case, the American authorities.  It's also important to observe that President Barack Obama personally apologized and called the act \\"inadvertent\\", indicating a recognition of responsibility at a high level of American leadership. In accordance with international norms, it is the purview of the national authority of the troops involved (in this case, America), to evaluate, penalize, or exonerate members of their armed forces for their actions, rather than the authorities of the aggrieved nation - in this case, Afghanistan. In the light of historical precedence, any disciplinary action is generally taken by the troops' respective national authorities. As this incident involves American troops, it would be the responsibility of American authorities to conduct a thorough review. The assessment involves reviewing the facts pursuant to all laws, regulations, and in adherence to due process. Due process, as advocated by international norms, necessitates that the accused must be aware of the charges against them, have a chance to defend themselves, and have their case heard before an impartial body. Picking an option such as the Afghan authorities, the Afghan National Army, or other Afghan entities could imply that they are responsible for penalizing American troops, which is usually not the case. This does not imply that these authorities will not engage in the investigatory or paperwork process; it does, however, denote that the final decision and any disciplinary action, if deemed necessary, are likely to originate from the American authorities. Therefore, given the circumstances and considering international standards of responsibility and accountability for military personnel actions, the American authorities would be expected to undertake the review and any subsequent actions."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant that follows instruction extremely well.

The term was originally used by record companies to describe recordings marketed predominantly to urban African Americans, at a time when \\"urbane, rocking, jazz based music with a heavy, insistent beat\\" was becoming more popular. In the commercial rhythm and blues music typical of the 1950s through the 1970s, the bands usually consisted of piano, one or two guitars, bass, drums, saxophone, and sometimes background vocalists. R&B lyrical themes often encapsulate the African-American experience of pain and the quest for freedom and joy. Lyrics focus heavily on the themes of triumphs and failures in terms of relationships, freedom, economics, aspirations, and sex.  - Rolling Stones Records was the record label formed by the Rolling Stones members Mick Jagger, Keith Richards, Mick Taylor, Charlie Watts and Bill Wyman in 1970, after their recording contract with Decca Records expired. It was first distributed in the United States by Atlantic Records subsidiary Atco Records. Beginning in 1973 it signed a distribution deal with Atlantic Records. In 1986 Columbia Records started distributing it. In the UK, it was distributed by EMI. The label was initially headed by Marshall Chess, the son of Chess Records founder Leonard Chess. It was discontinued in 1992 when the band signed to Virgin Records, but the tongue-and-lips logo remains on all post-1970 Rolling Stones releases.  - \`\` Some Girls '' is the title track of English rock and roll band the Rolling Stone 's 1978 album Some Girls . It marked the third time a song on one of the band 's albums also served as the album 's title and is noted for its risque lyrics concerning the title 's \`\` some girls '' . Alongside previous Stones releases that courted controversy ( \`\` Under My Thumb '' , \`\` Brown Sugar '' , \`\` Star Star '' ) due to their apparently degrading lyrics towards women , \`\` Some Girls '' caused a ruckus among both feminists and civil rights activists over such lyrics as \`\` black girls just want to get fucked all night '' and \`\` Chinese girls are so gentle / They 're really such a tease '' . Mick Jagger and the band defended the song , saying the lyrics mocked actual stereotypical feelings towards women . Saturday Night Live cast member Garrett Morris commented on the controversy with a mock - editorial on the show 's Weekend Update segment : After giving the impression that he was going to openly criticize the Stones , he quoted a sanitized version of the \`\` Black girls just ... '' line , then stated \`\` I have one thing to say to you , Mr. Mick Jagger ... where are these women ? ! ? '' The song is demonstrative of the unconventional uses of steel guitars heard throughout the Some Girls album , with an unusual , droning , phased two - chord groove that 's among the Stones ' most unusual arrangements . The original cut of the song ran some 23 minutes and featured verses Jagger came up with as they went along . Harmonica player Sugar Blue provides some virtuosic blues - style solos on the track . The song was featured heavily on the Stones ' 1999 North American No Security Tour which concentrated on lesser - known songs from the band 's catalogue . A performance during the band 's 2006 leg of the A Bigger Bang Tour was captured for the 2008 live album Shine a Light .  - Rock and roll (often written as rock & roll or rock 'n' roll) is a genre of popular music that originated and evolved in the United States during the late 1940s and early 1950s, from African-American musical styles such as gospel, jazz, boogie woogie, and rhythm and blues, with country. While elements of rock and roll can be heard in blues records from the 1920s and in country records of the 1930s, the genre did not acquire its name until the 1950s.  - The Rolling Stones are an English rock band formed in London in 1962. The original line-up consisted of Brian Jones (rhythm guitar, harmonica), Mick Jagger (lead vocals), Keith Richards (lead guitar, backing vocals), Ian Stewart (piano), Bill Wyman (bass) and Charlie Watts (drums). Stewart was removed from the official line-up in 1963 but continued as a touring member until his death in 1985. Jones left the band less than a month prior to his death in 1969, having already been replaced by Mick Taylor, who remained until 1974. After Taylor left the band, Ronnie Wood took his place in 1975 and has been on guitar in tandem with Richards ever since. Following Wyman's departure in 1993, Darryl Jones joined as their touring bassist. Other touring keyboardists for the band have been Nicky Hopkins (196782), Billy Preston (through the mid 1970s) and Chuck Leavell (1982-present). The band was first led by Jones, but after teaming as the band's songwriters, Jagger and Richards assumed leadership while Jones dealt with legal and personal troubles.  - Some Girls is the 14th British and 16th American studio album by the Rolling Stones, released in 1978 on Rolling Stones Records. It reached number one on the \\"Billboard\\" 200 album chart, and became the band's top selling album in the United States, certified by the RIAA as having six million copies sold as of 2000. It was a major critical success, becoming the only Rolling Stones album to be nominated for a Grammy in the Album of the Year category. Many reviewers called it a classic return to form and their best album since 1972's \\"Exile on Main St.\\"  - Jazz is a music genre that originated amongst African Americans in New Orleans, United States, in the late 19th and early 20th centuries. Since the 1920s jazz age, jazz has become recognized as a major form of musical expression. It emerged in the form of independent traditional and popular musical styles, all linked by the common bonds of African American and European American musical parentage with a performance orientation. Jazz is characterized by swing and blue notes, call and response vocals, polyrhythms and improvisation. Jazz has roots in West African cultural and musical expression, and in African-American music traditions including blues and ragtime, as well as European military band music. Although the foundation of jazz is deeply rooted within the Black experience of the United States, different cultures have contributed their own experience and styles to the art form as well. Intellectuals around the world have hailed jazz as \\"one of America's original art forms\\".  - Popular music is music with wide appeal that is typically distributed to large audiences through the music industry. These forms and styles can be enjoyed and performed by people with little or no musical training. It stands in contrast to both art music and traditional or \\"folk\\" music. Art music was historically disseminated through the performances of written music, although since the beginning of the recording industry, it is also disseminated through recordings. Traditional music forms such as early blues songs or hymns were passed along orally, or to smaller, local audiences.  - Exile on Main St. is a double album by English rock band the Rolling Stones. It was released on 12 May 1972 by Rolling Stones Records and was the band's tenth studio album released in the United Kingdom. The record's music incorporates rock and roll, blues, soul, country, and gospel genres. Although it originally received mixed reviews, \\"Exile on Main St.\\" has since been considered to be the Rolling Stones' best work while being ranked on various lists as one of the greatest albums of all time.  - Blues is a genre and musical form originated by African Americans in the Deep South of the United States around the end of the 19th century. The genre developed from roots in African musical traditions, African-American work songs and European-American folk music. Blues incorporated spirituals, work songs, field hollers, shouts, chants, and rhymed simple narrative ballads. The blues form, ubiquitous in jazz, rhythm and blues and rock and roll, is characterized by the call-and-response pattern, the blues scale and specific chord progressions, of which the twelve-bar blues is the most common. Blue notes (or \\"worried notes\\"), usually thirds or fifths flattened in pitch, are also an essential part of the sound. Blues shuffles or walking bass reinforce the trance-like rhythm and form a repetitive effect known as the groove.

Originally, \\"nebula\\" was a name for any diffuse astronomical object, including galaxies beyond the Milky Way. The Andromeda Galaxy, for instance, was once referred to as the \\"Andromeda Nebula\\" (and spiral galaxies in general as \\"spiral nebulae\\") before the true nature of galaxies was confirmed in the early 20th century by Vesto Slipher, Edwin Hubble and others.  - In astronomy and physical cosmology, the metallicity or Z is the fraction of mass of a star or other kind of astronomical object that is not in hydrogen (X) or helium (Y). Most of the physical matter in the universe is in the form of hydrogen and helium, so astronomers use the word \\"metals\\" as a convenient short term for \\"all elements except hydrogen and helium\\". This usage is distinct from the usual physical definition of a solid metal. The rationale for the astronomical usage is that in the high-temperature and pressure environment of a star, atoms do not undergo chemical reactions and effectively have no chemical properties, including that of being a metal as usually understood. For example, stars and nebulae with relatively high abundances of carbon, nitrogen, oxygen, and neon are called \\"metal-rich\\" in astrophysical terms, even though those elements are non-metals in chemistry.  - AB Doradus Moving Group is a group of about 30 associated stars that are moving through space together with the star AB Doradus . A moving group is distinguished by its members having about the same age , composition ( or metallicity ) and motion through space . Hence they most likely formed in the same location . This group is located about 20 parsecs from the Earth and is the closest known co-moving group . The average space velocity of this group has components of U =  8 , V =  27 and W =  14 km / s. About 10 of these stars form a nuclear group within a volume roughly 10 parsecs across . The proximity of this moving group makes it useful for studies of shared stellar properties , as well as detection of companions through direct imaging . These can be used for refinement of young stellar models , for example .  - AB Doradus is a pre-main-sequence quadruple star system in the constellation Dorado. The primary is a flare star that shows periodic increases in activity.  - Dorado (English pronunciation: ) is a constellation in the southern sky.

Porky and a rival neighbor both plan to win the agricultural farm prize, Porky with his garden and the neighbor with his chickens. Porky carefully plans a box of seeds, one by one while the man is busy mixing a bunch of bottles of items together. Porky goes to retrieve something as the man feeds the brand new mixture into the feeding bin for his chickens. But when they try it out, they spit the food out in disgust and seek food elsewhere. Porky grabs his bottle of quick grow, a hair tonic he hopes would work on his garden. To his amazement, it does. But he says nothing of it and heads inside his house. The neighbor checks out his handy work and comments on it, allowing his chickens to come over and eat all of his fruits and vegetables. A little chick and a bigger chicken fight over a watermelon until it flings the chick away. The chick sadly retreats until it sees a bunch of spinach and decides to munch on it instead. The chick then comes back and punches the mean chicken before finishing the watermelon. (The chick eating spinach and then changing is a thinly-veiled Popeye reference).

Please briefly summarize this news article: At Indianapolis 500, Innovation Began With a Look Back When the 40 racecars lined up for the first Indianapolis 500, on May 30, 1911, 39 of them had something in common: There were two men onboard. In the 40th car sat Ray Harroun, all by himself. Harroun went on to win the race, at least in part because of the aerodynamic advantages his one-man car gave him. But that is not why other drivers protested before the race. They were worried about safety. One of the key jobs of the second man in a racecar, who was known as a riding mechanic, was to look backward and alert the driver to what was going on behind him. Harroun’s rivals were concerned that without this spotter, he might cause a pileup. Don’t worry, Harroun told officials. He had rigged a 3-inch-by-8-inch mirror in a makeshift case mounted above his dashboard. It was, quite possibly, the first rearview mirror on a motorcar. This week, 33 drivers are beginning to practice and qualify for the 100th Indianapolis 500, to be held on May 29, when solo drivers will cram themselves into the narrow cockpits of aerodynamic wonders that often average more than 160 miles per hour in the race. Harroun’s car in the first Indy 500, the Marmon Wasp, which averaged 74.6 m.p.h. in his victory, was ahead of its time in a number of ways. “You could save the weight of the second person, and the body could be more narrow,” said Donald Davidson, the official Indianapolis Motor Speedway historian. The Wasp was one of the few cars at the time to be streamlined, and in the 1960s, Davidson said, several astronauts inspected the Wasp, which is still on display at the speedway museum. “They were fascinated by the shape of the tail and asked, ‘How did they know to do this?’” Davidson said. The mirror also probably helped Harroun aerodynamically, producing downforce, Davidson said. Passenger cars began introducing rearview mirrors soon after the race; Davidson said he had never seen a photograph of one on a car before that date. “As far as we know,” he said, “Ray Harroun had the first rearview mirror on an automobile.” Harroun, who died in 1968, told Davidson he got the idea for the mirror while serving as a chauffeur in Chicago in 1904 for William Thorne, the president of Montgomery Ward. “Along came a horse-drawn taxicab,” Davidson said Harroun told him. “The fellow was sitting up on top with a top hat, and he noticed there was a pole sticking out with a mirror.” The other 39 drivers in the 1911 race stuck with two-seaters as Harroun circled the track alone for 6 hours 42 minutes 8 seconds. (Tony Kanaan won the 2013 race in a record 2:40:03.4, with an average speed of 187.4 m.p.h.) Riding mechanics, who in addition to being lookouts kept an eye on tire wear and would even hop out of the car and run back through the infield to get fuel, shared the danger with the drivers. S. P. Dickson, whom a New York Times article referred to as a mechanician, died during the race after his car lost a wheel, causing both occupants to be thrown out. The driver, Arthur Greiner, was lucky to escape with a broken arm. “Dickson was thrown against a fence 20 feet from the car and terribly mangled,” the Times reported. Four other riding mechanics sustained injuries in the race. Safety standards at races in that era were poor. Many of the spectators that day, estimated at more than 80,000, wandered into situations almost as dangerous as those facing the drivers. “The spectators swarmed across the infield when Dickson was killed and pressed close about his body and that of the unconscious Greiner,” The Times reported. “Soldiers had to club their guns to clear a space for the surgeons when the ambulance arrived. “The throng went wild with excitement after the first accident and rushed back and forth over the field when the other accidents were reported.” The drivers fell short of the fame of those today. Most of the drivers and the mechanics were employees of the company that manufactured the car, and races were often seen as battles between companies rather than men. Harroun compared himself to a jockey. “I didn’t win the 500 in 1911,” Harroun told Davidson. “Marmon won the 500. I just happened to be the driver.” The headline of the Times article about the first race read, “Marmon Car Wins.” Harroun, the only man to ride alone in that first Indy 500, was also the only one to do so for many years. Beginning the next year, the rules were changed to require the use of riding mechanics. They were mandatory until 1922 and then again from 1930 to 1937. But while he was winning the first Indy 500 in his innovative car, Harroun had a secret, which he related to Davidson in 1967. His innovative mirror had reassured his rivals that the race would be safe. But the brick track at the speedway made for a bumpy ride. “To tell you the truth, on the brick surface, I couldn’t see a damn thing in it,” Harroun said. “And no one knew it but me.” A version of this article appears in print on May 17, 2016, on page B9 of the New York edition with the headline: Innovation Began With a Look Back.

Answer the following question: The answer to the question: What were the two staff positions at the Elgin Cathedral that continued to grow? is inside the article: Elgin Cathedral is a historic ruin in Elgin, Moray, north-east Scotland. The cathedral—dedicated to the Holy Trinity—was established in 1224 on land granted by King Alexander II outside the burgh of Elgin and close to the River Lossie. It replaced the cathedral at Spynie, 3 kilometres (1.9 mi) to the north, that was served by a small chapter of eight clerics. The new and bigger cathedral was staffed with 18 canons in 1226 and then increased to 23 by 1242. After a damaging fire in 1270, a rebuilding programme greatly enlarged the building. It was unaffected by the Wars of Scottish Independence but again suffered extensive fire damage in 1390 following an attack by Robert III's brother Alexander Stewart, Earl of Buchan, also known as the Wolf of Badenoch. In 1402 the cathedral precinct again suffered an incendiary attack by the followers of the Lord of the Isles. The number of clerics required to staff the cathedral continued to grow, as did the number of craftsmen needed to maintain the buildings and surrounds. The cathedral went through periods of enlargement and renovation following the fires of 1270 and 1390 that included the doubling in length of the choir, the provision of outer aisles to the northern and southern walls of both the nave and choir. Today, these walls are at full height in places and at foundation level in others yet the overall cruciform shape is still discernible. A mostly intact octagonal chapter house dates from the major enlargement after the fire of 1270. The gable wall above the double door entrance that links the west towers is nearly complete and was rebuilt following the fire of 1390. It accommodates a large window opening that now only contains stub tracery work and fragments of a large rose window. Recessed and chest tombs in both transepts and in the south aisle of the choir contain effigies of bishops and knights, and large flat slabs in the now grass-covered floor of the cathedral mark the positions of early graves.

Answer the following question: What is the name of the lead single from the 10th album of the band that were content to work without deadlines?  Answer the above question based on the context below:  Following the mixed success of their musical pursuits in the 1990s, U2 sought to simplify their sound; the Edge said that with Pop, the group had \\"taken the deconstruction of the rock 'n' roll band format to its absolute 'nth degree\\". For their tenth album, All That You Can't Leave Behind, the group wanted to return to their old recording ethos of \\"the band in a room playing together\\". Reuniting with Eno and Lanois, U2 began working on the album in late 1998. After their experiences with being pressured to complete Pop, the band were content to work without deadlines. With Bono's schedule limited by his commitments to debt relief for Jubilee 2000 and the other band members spending time with their families, the recording sessions stretched through August 2000.Released in October of that year, All That You Can't Leave Behind was seen by critics as a \\"back to basics\\" album, on which the group returned to a more mainstream, conventional rock sound. For many of those not won over by the band's forays into dance music, it was considered a return to grace; Rolling Stone called it U2's \\"third masterpiece\\" alongside The Joshua Tree and Achtung Baby. The album debuted at number one in 32 countries and sold 12 million copies. Its lead single, \\"Beautiful Day\\", was a worldwide hit, reaching number one in Ireland, the UK, Australia, and Canada, while peaking at number 21 in the US. The song earned Grammy Awards for Song of the Year, Best Rock Performance by a Duo or Group with Vocal, and Record of the Year. At the awards ceremony, Bono declared that U2 were \\"reapplying for the job ... [of] the best band in the world\\". The album's other singles were worldwide hits as well; \\"Stuck in a Moment You Can't Get Out Of\\", \\"Elevation\\", and \\"Walk On\\" reached number one in Canada, while charting in the top five in the UK and top ten in Australia.

Given the question: What are the full names of the two individuals who conceived of a college for students drawn from a wide range of nationalities, with the aim of fostering international understanding?  Answer the above question based on the context below:  Hearst died in August 1951. The castle remained on the market for the following decade until bought in 1960 by Antonin Besse II, son of the late Sir Antonin Besse, and donated to the founding council of Atlantic College. Besse was a patron and honorary vice-president of the United World Colleges. The idea for an international school arose from a meeting between the educationalist Kurt Hahn, who founded Gordonstoun, and Air Marshal Sir Lawrence Darvall, the commandant of the NATO Defense College. They conceived of a college for 16–19-year-old students drawn from a wide range of nationalities, with the aim of fostering international understanding. With Rear-Admiral Desmond Hoare, the first headmaster, they persuaded Besse that the castle would make a suitable location for the first United World College, which opened in 1962 with fifty-six students.The first rigid-hulled inflatable boat was patented by Hoare at St Donat's in the 1960s. In an act of generosity, Hoare sold the patent for the boat to the Royal National Lifeboat Institution in 1973 for a notional £1; the RNLI's cheque was not cashed and remains at the castle. From 1963 until 2013 the castle hosted an RNLI lifeboat station which was credited with saving ninety-eight lives along the South Wales coast during its period of operation. The college's early years were financially precarious, but major fund-raising efforts led by Sir George Schuster strengthened the financial position in the mid-1960s.The fiftieth anniversary of the college in 2012 was celebrated with a  visit to the site by Queen Noor of Jordan, President of the United World Colleges Foundation. As at 2017, the college was home to 350 students from more than 90 countries. The Hearst Corporation maintains a connection with St Donat's through a sponsorship programme for students at the college. With a history of occupation from its construction in the late 13th century, St Donat's has been described as the oldest continuously inhabited castle in Wales.

Donald Trump And Nine Other Teetotalling Moguls \\"What are you drinking for?\\" asks Trump. Donald Trump, 420th on Forbes’ list of The World’s Billionaires and next week’s guest on Intelligent Investing With Steve Forbes, is no stranger to making a deal. Unlike many moguls, however, you won’t find him discussing business over a nice glass of scotch. Trump, known as much for his reality shows The Apprentice and Celebrity Apprentice as he is for his business acumen, is a teetotaler. “I don’t drink, and it’s very easy for me not to drink,” Trump told Forbes when they chatted in the Forbes Townhouse. “I tell people, ‘What are you drinking for?’ And they don’t even understand what I’m saying.” In Pictures: Ten Teetotalling Moguls. Trump isn’t alone in his decision to avoid booze; a fair number of powerful moguls and mavens have chosen to stay off the sauce for various reasons. Some choose not to drink because of health reasons – billionaire and Dole Food Company chairman David Murdock has a notoriously strict diet regimen, while Apple founder Steve Jobs has a history of liver problems. Others, like Stephenie Meyer, abstain for religious reasons; the Twilight author, who came in at #59 on the Forbes Celebrity 100 last year, is a devout Mormon. For Trump, teetotaling was ingrained in him by his older brother Fred, who struggled with alcoholism. “I learned a lot from my brother, Fred,” Trump told Forbes. “He set an example. It wasn’t, maybe, the example that people would think, but it really was, in its own way, an example. That here was this fantastic guy, who got caught up in the alcohol, and he ultimately died from alcoholism.” “I used to say that I didn’t drink because of Fred, I would never drink.” It should be noted that avoidance of liquor, for many of these magnates, doesn’t extend to business. Billionaire Warren Buffett, whose drink of choice is a strawberry milkshake, has invested in alcohol distributors like Empire Distributors. Media mogul Tyra Banks has been quoted as saying that holding a glass of wine (and not drinking it) makes her feel sexy. In fact, Trump himself markets a line of Trump Vodka.

Upon researching, InterLATA (Inter-Local Access and Transport Area) refers to telecommunications services that take place between different LATAs (Local Access and Transport Areas). LATAs are geographic regions in which telecommunications providers are permitted to offer their services per the Modified Final Judgment (MFJ). InterLATA services involve telecommunications provided between these regions. Now, I will analyze which category InterLATA Internet service falls under: 1. Entity - This term is not an object or a specific organization. 2. Abbreviation - InterLATA itself is an abbreviation, but the question is about InterLATA Internet service, which is a concept. 3. Description - This option seems most suitable as it deals with explaining the concept of InterLATA Internet service. 4. Human - This term does not represent any person. 5. Location - The term describes a type of service between specific locations but is not a location itself. 6. Numeric Value - There are no numbers or measurements involved. Based on the analysis, I conclude that the answer to the question \\"What is InterLATA Internet service?\\" would be a 'description', as it explains the concept of Internet services provided between different Local Access and Transport Areas."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Many have been subjected to arbitrary detention, extrajudicial executions or sexual violence, the report found. Since the beginning of 2012, the report found, Mali has faced a situation that has \\"questioned both the integrity of its territory as well as almost 20 years of political stability.\\" Fighters arriving from Libya in early 2012 fueled a Tuareg rebellion that included attacks against Malian outposts in the north of the country, the report said. The rebels are accused of violating international humanitarian law because they executed soldiers they caught in combat. According to Amnesty, the Malian army responded by bombing indiscriminately to civilian areas. Disaster looms for people of Mali as country is split by revolt. Adding to the country's woes, in March, a group of noncommissioned officers took power after a military coup. The new government suspended the constitution and arrested political leaders, Amnesty reported.

Write a title for this article: UNIONDALE, N.Y – Knocked from Sunday afternoon’s overtime loss to the New York Islanders after taking a hit to the left shoulder during the first period, forward Eric Fehr will miss at least the next two games of the Eastern Conference quarterfinals, Coach Barry Trotz said. The Washington Capitals officially listed Fehr with an upper-body injury, which Trotz was unrelated to the issue that shelved him for the final three games of the regular season. “I would say he’s out for the next two games and we’ll re-evaluate that,” Trotz said. “You can ask me two games from now.” A veteran currently serving as the checking line’s center after scoring 19 goals for the Capitals this season, Fehr left after forward Kyle Okposo leveled him into the glass, less than four minutes after the puck dropped. Fehr has battled shoulder issues during his career, undergoing surgeries in 2009 and 2011, and according to Trotz recently re-aggravated an existing issue that had lingered throughout the season. “He plays a pretty good role for us,” Trotz said. “He’s done a lot of stuff on the PK, five-on-five, been a little bit of a checking guy. He’s just been one of those quiet guys who’s got it done. Every team has guys like that and we have a couple of those guys. “It’s a loss but you’re going to lose people along the way in terms of a series for a game or two or even longer sometimes. You just deal with it. That’s what being a team is. If one guy’s out, other people step up and that’s how you get it done. That’s how you got it done all year.” Without Fehr at practice, Trotz moved forward Jay Beagle into Fehr’s center spot, surrounding him with Brooks Laich and Troy Brouwer. Forward Marcus Johansson also started practice but left before the Capitals took line rushes, roughly halfway through the 20-minute session, a decision made by the training staff connected to an injury Johansson incurred minutes after Fehr’s. Careening after a loose puck, Johansson leaned into forward Cal Clutterbuck to absorb contact. While Johansson went into the glass, Clutterbuck’s right skate kicked up and appeared to slice Johansson on the left calf. Johansson eventually hobbled into the locker room, but returned and finished the game. “A little bit of bumped and bruised yesterday, so he went for a skate,” Trotz said. “We told him the trainers were working with him. I expect him to be in warmup tomorrow and ready to go hopefully. Our trainers do a good job. Just like anything, you’ve got some stiffness, you’ve got to work it out. That’s what they’ll spend today doing that.” If Johansson and Fehr both sit Tuesday night for Game 4, rookies Andre Burakovsky and Michael Latta are expected to enter the lineup for their first and second career playoff games, respectively. Burakovsky rushed on a line with Evgeny Kuznetsov and Jason Chimera, while Latta centered the fourth line between Curtis Glencross and Tom Wilson. “That’s playoffs for you,” defenseman Karl Alzner said. “You’re going to have some big injuries at times. You could lose a guy for a month or lose a guy for a game. It’s just the way you deal with it and the way guys step up and we have a lot of really good players in this room.” Alex Prewitt covers the Washington Capitals.

The outer part, called the cortex, secretes hormones such as cortisol, which helps the body deal with stress, and aldosterone, which helps regulate the balance of minerals in the body. The inner part of each adrenal gland, called the medulla, secretes fight-or-flight hormones such as adrenaline, which prepare the body to respond to emergencies. For example, adrenaline increases the amount of oxygen and glucose going to the muscles. You can see an animation of this response at the link below.  I am facing a new situation today: John is a biologist, who studies animal species of tundra biome. He noticed that they behave in certain way when they secrete hormones from adrenal glands' cortex. On the other hand, they behave some other way when they secrete hormones from adrenal glands' medulla. He termed the first process as process A and latter process as process B.

Title: Friday the 13th Part VII: The New Blood Movie plot: As a young child, Tina Shepard witnesses her alcoholic father physically abusing her mother. The emotional trauma unlocks Tina's previously latent telekinetic powers, which result in her father's death at the bottom of Crystal Lake. Ten years later, Tina, now a teenager, is still struggling with the guilt surrounding the death of her father. Tina's mother, Amanda, takes her to the same lakeside residence so that her powers can be studied (and unknowingly exploited) by her psychiatrist, Dr. Crews. Dr. Crews begins a series of experiments (verbal assaults) designed to agitate Tina's mental state, forcing her powers to become more pronounced. After a particularly upsetting session with Dr. Crews, Tina runs from the cabin and to the dock thinking about her father's death. While thinking about him, she wishes he would come back. Instead, Tina's psychic powers breaks the chain around the neck of Jason Voorhees, the undead Crystal Lake serial killer. Tina's torment from her powers is increased as Jason emerges from the lake and his reign of terror descends on the area once again. Next door to the Shepard residence is a group of teens who are throwing a birthday party for their friend Michael: preppy Russell and his girlfriend Sandra, Ben and his girlfriend Kate, science fiction writer Eddie, stoner David, perky Robin, shy Maddie, and snobby socialite Melissa. Michael's cousin Nick, who has arrived just for the party takes a liking to Tina, much to the jealousy of Melissa, who bullies Tina. Tina tells Nick about Jason and has a vision of Jason murdering Michael. Meanwhile, Jason kills Michael in real life, along with Jane, and later kills another couple camping in the woods. While Tina goes off to find her mother and Nick goes with her, Jason proceeds to kill the other teens. Russell is killed with a hatchet to the face, and Sandra is pulled underwater while she is skinny-dipping. Jason stalks Maddie and kills her in the barn with a scythe, and then crushes Ben's skull with his bare hands before shoving a party horn... The answer is:","output":"Tina runs from the cabin after a particularly upsetting session with Dr. Crews. The session, which was designed to agitate Tina's mental state and force her powers to become more pronounced, deeply distressed her. This caused her to run towards the dock while reflecting on her father's death."},{"instruction":"Q:Carbon monoxide poisoning   causes death and injuries around the world. This gas is a problem in all parts of the world that experience cold weather. A few years ago, America's Centers for Disease Control (C. D. C.) studied deaths linked   with carbon monoxide poisoning. It found that the number of carbon monoxide deaths in the United States was greatest in January. The C.D.C. also found that carbon monoxide kills more than four hundred Americans each year. And, it said more than twenty thousand people are taken to hospital for treatment of health problems linked with the gas. Carbon monoxide is called the silent killer because people do not know it is in the air. The gas has no color, no taste and no smell. It does not cause burning eyes. And it does not cause people to cough. Yet, carbon monoxide gas is very deadly  . It steals the body's ability to use oxygen. Carbon monoxide makes it difficult for the blood to carry oxygen to body tissues  . It does this by linking with the blood. When the gas links with the blood, the blood is no longer able to carry oxygen to the tissues that need it. Damage   to the body can begin very quickly from large amounts   of carbon monoxide. How quickly this can happen depend on how long a person is breathing the gas and how much gas he or she breathes in. Carbon monoxide poisoning has warning signs . But people have to be awake to realize them. Small amounts of the gas will cause a person's head to hurt. He or she may begin to feel tired. Their stomachs may feel sick. The room may appear to be turning around. The person may have trouble thinking clearly. People develop serious headache as the amount of the gas continues to enter their blood. They will begin to feel very tired and sleepy. They may have terrible stomachache. Doctors say carbon monoxide influences people differently. For example a small child will experience health problems or die much sooner than an adult. The general health of the person or his or her age can also be important. What does the passage mainly talk about? A) Warning signs that carbon monoxide poisoning has. B) Reasons why carbon monoxide can cause person's death.

She looked just like she did most days back then--a glamour queen, a movie star (\\"Just like Lena Horne,\\" my friend Chloe had once said, \\"only darker--oh, sorry, Leah!\\"), but today her beauty somehow had a harder, more defiant edge to it. I could smell the expensive Dior perfume as soon as I opened the door, which surprised me, because my mom was usually fastidious about not getting perfume on her clothes. She was wearing her bug glasses--huge dark things with lenses that bulged out like fly eyes and reflected my face like a fun-house mirror. She had tied a yellow silk scarf around her hair and was taking deep pulls on a cigarette held between two immaculately manicured fingers. Only I knew about the nicotine stains she carefully covered with her special order \\"forest sable\\" cream each morning. Tiffany, a stupid but vicious senator's daughter who I had the misfortune of sharing a classroom with, suddenly dashed from inside the school, her face flushed. \\"Hello, Mrs. Wilson,\\" she called. Before my mother could respond, she giggled and ran back to three of her friends waiting beyond the door. I could hear them laughing, but I was glad I couldn't understand their words. They were all fascinated with my mother--the black housekeeper who dressed like Katharine Hepburn and drove a Cadillac, whose daughter's \\"light toffee\\" skin indicated that she might just like her coffee with a lot of cream. Sometimes I hated those girls. \\"Get in the car, Leah,\\" my mother said. Her already husky voice was pitched low, as though she'd been crying. That made me nervous. Why was she here? \\"Ma, Chloe was going to show me her dad's new camera.

Huck greets his father coldly. The two play heads-up. Loan shark Roy Durucher tells Huck that he plays poker as well as anybody, except for his reputation as a \\"blaster\\" (not patient enough) who always goes for broke. Roy proposes to stake Huck in the 10,000 main-event with a 60% — 40% split of any winnings, but Huck refuses. After failing to borrow money from his friend Jack, Huck goes to Suzanne's place hoping for a loan. Instead he runs into Billie, who gets a call confirming that she has landed a job singing at a club. Huck proposes a celebration and at Binion's Horseshoe he shows her how to play poker. L.C. arrives and shows Huck a wedding ring of Huck's late mother's that Huck had pawned and that L.C. has redeemed. Huck loses his winnings. Over dinner, he explains to Billie that his father stole from his mother before leaving her.

Police say he refused to drop a knife. Officer Jason Van Dyke has been charged with first-degree murder in the case. Chicago Mayor Rahm Emanuel has appealed for calm in the city. Mr Van Dyke has said through his lawyer and police union he had feared for his life. The shooting and subsequent protests have become the latest flashpoint in a national debate over violence against black men by police. Hundreds of protesters marched through the streets of the mid-western city late on Tuesday, in what police said were largely peaceful demonstrations. The five demonstrators that were arrested were charged with offences ranging from assaulting a police officer to weapons possession. \\"It is fine to be passionate but it essential to remain peaceful,\\" Mayor Emanuel told a news conference before the protests. Police are bracing for more protests in the coming days. Michael Brown: Police shot the unarmed teenager in Ferguson last year, setting off huge protests and unrest nationwide Eric Garner: Garner choked to death while under restraint by police in New York Tamir Rice: Police shot and killed the 12-year-old in Cleveland as he brandished a toy gun Walter Scott: A South Carolina police officer shot Scott numerous times in the back as he was running away Freddie Gray: The 25-year-old died after sustaining a severe spinal cord injury while in the custody of police in Baltimore A post-mortem examination showed McDonald had been shot at least twice in the back, and had hallucinogenic drugs in his system.

Possible A: oklahoma, new mexico, texas, mexico, great plains  Why is \\"new mexico\\" an answer aligned with human common sense? Answer:","output":"\\"New Mexico\\" is an answer aligned with human common sense because: 1. Geographical relevance: Llano Estacado, also known as the Staked Plains, is a region in the Southwestern United States that covers parts of New Mexico and Texas. Since the question mentions that he was bound for Llano Estacado, it makes sense that his end goal could be within that region. New Mexico is one of the states that is part of Llano Estacado, so choosing it as the destination is geographically plausible. 2. Contextual considerations: The other possible answers present in the list include Oklahoma, Texas, Mexico, and Great Plains. Among them, Texas is also part of Llano Estacado, but the user has specifically asked why \\"New Mexico\\" is an answer aligned with human common sense, so we focus on explaining the relevance of New Mexico in this context. 3. Eliminating unlikely options: Oklahoma and Great Plains are relatively further from the specific region of Llano Estacado. Mexico, while being geographically closer, is not part of the Llano Estacado region. Therefore, taking into account the geographical context, \\"New Mexico\\" stands out as a more reasonable answer aligned with human common sense. In conclusion, \\"New Mexico\\" is a sensible answer because it is geographically relevant, contextually appropriate, and more plausible compared to the other options presented. It is aligned with human common sense as it directly relates to the Llano Estacado region mentioned in the question."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant. User will you give you a task.

Article: A 16-year-old boy finds himself on a boat in the Pacific Ocean after escaping a shipwreck . Even worse, he is left with a huge tiger for company. But he manages to survive after 227 days of fighting against all the hardships of the sea. Pi, the lead character in Oscar-winning Ang Lee's new movie Life of Pi, went through an inspiring journey of growth and self-discovery. So did 19-year-old Suraj Sharma, the Indian actor who plays him. But it was a lucky chance that opened up the opportunity for the new star. Sharma was a regular student who lived with his mathematician parents in Delhi, India. As the director traveled to Mumbai to find his Pi, the teenager went along with his younger brother, who had acted in a couple of movies, to audition . But little did Sharma know that he would end up winning the role from 3, 000 hopefuls. Lee said he saw Pi in Sharma: \\"Not only does he have a compelling and wise look. He has this rare talent.\\" The director said that in the final round, Sharma gave one of the \\"most compelling readings we had. In the end, he was in tears.\\" Understandably, Sharma didn't want to _ . \\"He (Lee) had given me this opportunity. I had to give it my best,\\" Sharma told the Philippine Daily Inquirer. Sharma swam for four or five hours a day until he was completely comfortable with the water. He also worked on his body because he had to first gain weight and then quickly lose weight as the story developed. He even had rats run all over him to prepare for his role. Lee was impressed by the teenager, especially his endurance and patience in staying in a water tank for many hours each day. Sharma was only 16 when Lee signed him. After three years of shooting, Sharma said he had matured with Pi's journey. Question: The passage is intended to introduce   _  . Answer: A:","output":"The passage is primarily intended to introduce the inspiring story of Suraj Sharma, a then 19-year-old Indian actor who portrayed the lead role in Oscar-winning director Ang Lee's film, \\"Life of Pi\\". The article follows Sharma's intriguing journey from being an ordinary student in Delhi, living with his mathematician parents, to becoming the main character in a high-profile international movie.  The narrative touches on how Sharma lucked into this opportunity — his pivotal audition was originally planned as a supportive role for his younger brother. However, the director Ang Lee saw potential in him, identifying a \\"compelling and wise\\" look, as well as a unique talent that set him apart from the other 3,000 hopefuls. The passage also details Sharma's committed preparation for his role as Pi which led to mental and physical growth. Ensuring that he was completely comfortable in the water, swimming four or five hours each day, and adjusting his body weight for the plot progression were part of the grueling yet fruitful process. These efforts, beyond showcasing his dedication, also highlighted his toughness and patience as he spent hours in a water tank, tolerating rats running over him, and ultimately maturing along with Pi's journey. Additionally, the article serves to provide context and background to the plot of \\"Life of Pi\\" itself, including an overview of the storyline which revolves around the character Pi, a 16-year-old boy left alone with a tiger in the Pacific Ocean after surviving a shipwreck. This character undergoes a poignant journey of survival, growth, and self-discovery, introducing audiences to a thrilling survival tale with spiritual dimensions. In conclusion, the passage effectively introduces both the remarkable personal journey of Suraj Sharma into the world of cinema and the plot of the film \\"Life of Pi\\". It also showcases what the director Ang Lee saw in Sharma, and how he effectively brought the character of Pi to life."},{"instruction":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

Given the question: A friend asked me to answer this question: What is the first name of the person whose art also bears some stylistic resemblance to the work of European post-impressionists such as Vincent van Gogh?, using the article: Thomson was largely self-taught. His experiences as a graphic designer with Toronto's Grip Ltd. honed his draughtsmanship. Although he began painting and drawing at an early age, it was only in 1912, when he was well into his thirties, that he began to paint seriously. His first trips to Algonquin Park inspired him to follow the lead of fellow artists in producing oil sketches of natural scenes on small, rectangular panels for easy portability while travelling. Between 1912 and his death in 1917, Thomson produced hundreds of these small sketches, many of which are now considered works in their own right, and are mostly found in the Art Gallery of Ontario in Toronto, the National Gallery of Canada in Ottawa, the McMichael Canadian Art Collection in Kleinburg and the Tom Thomson Art Gallery in Owen Sound.Thomson produced nearly all of his works between 1912 and 1917. Most of his large canvases were completed in his most productive period, from late 1916 to early 1917. The patronage of James MacCallum enabled Thomson's transition from graphic designer to professional painter. Although the Group of Seven was not founded until after his death, his work was sympathetic to that of group members A. Y. Jackson, Frederick Varley, and Arthur Lismer. These artists shared an appreciation for rugged, unkempt natural scenery, and all used broad brush strokes and a liberal application of paint to capture the beauty and colour of the Ontario landscape. Thomson's art also bears some stylistic resemblance to the work of European post-impressionists such as Vincent van Gogh. Other key influences were the Art Nouveau and Arts and Crafts movements of the late nineteenth and early twentieth centuries, styles with which he became familiar while working in the graphic arts., what would be the answer ?

Answer the following question: Just minutes after Donald Trump fired Rex Tillerson on Tuesday, the president was blunt about his long-standing differences with his former secretary of state. “We disagreed on things,” Trump told reporters outside the White House, specifically pointing to friction over the Iran nuclear agreement. “I wanted to either break it or do something, and he felt a little bit differently,” Trump said. “We were really not thinking the same.” Trump reportedly had considered firing Tillerson for months. But the decision - and the abrupt way it was executed - represents a dramatic end to a strained relationship. Tillerson learned of his firing by an early-morning Trump tweet, according to Steve Goldstein, undersecretary of state. White House officials disputed that notion, and promptly fired Goldstein. The move left some of Trump's staunchest defenders with mixed feelings. “It’s all very Trumpian,” said James Carafano of the conservative Heritage Foundation, who helped staff the State Department as a member of Trump’s transition team. “When the president makes changes, he just abruptly makes them.” During his 14 months at the State Department, Tillerson had numerous policy differences with Trump - and the friction frequently played out in public. The animosity peaked in October, when news surfaced that Tillerson reportedly called Trump a “moron” following a July Pentagon meeting. Tillerson never explicitly denied the account. Tillerson also publicly disagreed with Trump’s decision to pull out of the Paris climate accord. He reportedly opposed Trump’s decision to move the U.S. embassy from Tel Aviv to Jerusalem. And Tillerson sometimes took a tougher stance than Trump on Russia — including this week, when he blamed Moscow for a suspected nerve agent attack in Britain. In return, Trump on numerous occasions publicly undermined his top diplomat, including in October when he tweeted Tillerson was “wasting his time” trying to negotiate with North Korean leader Kim Jong Un.

To me , he is a fourteen-year-old kid named Joe, with blond hair and blue eyes. To others, he is different. Where I see a kid who just needs a lot more attention, others see a mentally disabled boy, a kid who cannot walk or talk or think for himself. I see someone who just makes daily routine a bit less routine. Others see an annoyance, a bother. This is not to say that I have never felt resentful  toward Joe. He is my brother, and with that comes responsibility. \\"Gina, could you stay in tonight and watch your brother?\\" \\"Gina, do me a favor and feed him dinner and change his diaper  later, please?\\"\\"Could you come home right after school today and get Joe off the bus?\\" These are phrases that I have heard since I was twelve. And sure, they have made me resent my brother to a certain extent. I would think: that's not fair! Everyone else can stay after and be a member of this club, or get extra help from that teacher. Or, all my friends are going out tonight, why can't I?  And, how come I have to feed him? He is not my son! However, the small amount of resentment I feel toward my brother is erased a thousand times over by what I have learned from him. Besides making me responsible from a young age, and helping me be more accepting  of all kinds of people, he has taught me to be thankful for what I have. I know that there are moment in my life that I should cherish and that Joe will never experience. He will never laugh so hard that he cries. He will never feel the glory of a straight-A report card. He will never comfort a  best friend crying on his shoulder. And he will never know how much his family love him. Because he will never know, it is up to me to know, every second , how lucky I am. It is up to me to realize that life should be lived to its fullest, and that you should always, always be grateful that God, or whoever are the powers that be, gave you the ability to live your life the way you were meant to live it.

The growing field of \\"music treatment\\" is presenting increasing amounts of proof that point to the great powers of music. Emotional  benefits The right song can put anybody in a better state. Most people turn to certain songs to make them feel better. The main reason behind this is that music can express our feelings better than any other medium. In addition, we have favorite songs for particular situations because we turn to the music which has the best effect on us. Music and exercise Have you ever noticed how out of breath you get when listening to an exciting song while doing exercises at the gym? It has been suggested that exciting music can actually increase muscle tension  , while light music does the opposite. It has also been proved that music can improve motor skills. An experiment done on a group of pupils proved that children learning basic motor skills such as throwing ,catching and jumping while listening to music did better than those with no music. Chronic pain relief  Music also has the ability to reduce chronic pain. In fact, according to a paper published in the Journal of Advanced Nursing, music can reduce chronic pain by 21%. The paper reports that 60 patients in an experiment were divided into two groups--one group listened to music, and the other did not. The results showed that people who listened to music for an hour each day for a week improved physically and psychologically  while those who did not listen to music did not.

Explanation: When there is more flora (plants) in the surrounding environment, it might lead to fewer remains for the water to seep into. This is due to various reasons, such as increased competition for resources, more rapid decomposition of organic matter by microbes supported by the plants, or even the physical obstruction of water flow by the dense plant cover.

Answer the following question: What is wrong with him and why are his lips twisted as he did his best to hold his lunch ?","output":"In the given passage, Mago is portrayed as being on a ship, with his lips twisted as he tries to hold in his lunch. The different choices provided for understanding Mago's situation are: I. He is very hungry and he is trying to keep his stomach from making noise. II. None of the above choices. III. He doesn't want someone to steal his lunch bag. IV. He is unused to sea travel and he is nauseous. Analyzing the passage, we can deduce that Mago is not presented as being hungry. Instead, the passage conveys that he had a difficult time finishing his lunch, which means he is not likely to be focused on the noises his stomach may make. Therefore, option I is not applicable. Option II, 'none of the above choices,' can be excluded since we have other options to consider and evaluate. Regarding option III, there is no mention of the fear of someone stealing his lunch bag. The passage emphasizes the effort required for Mago to finish his meal and his struggle to keep the contents of his stomach in place. Hence, this option is not applicable. Option IV, \\"He is unused to sea travel and he is nauseous,\\" aligns with the context as described in the passage. As the ship lurches, Mago's focus is on keeping his stomach where it belongs. This indicates that the sea travel is causing him seasickness or nausea. The fact that he is leaning over the side of the ship while holding onto the railing and glaring at the waves also implies that the sea travel is not an enjoyable experience for him. Based on the passage, the most appropriate answer to the question is: Mago is suffering from nausea due to sea travel, which is causing his lips to twist as he tries to hold in his lunch.

The title says \\"A short book that took forever.\\" This implies that the customer might have found the book too long or slow, which indicates dissatisfaction. 2. The reviewer mentions working in the technical industry and watching a lot of Alias. This information shows that they had certain expectations about the book, and it could be relevant to their level of satisfaction with it. 3. The next sentence highlights that the book is about spies and IT, which seems to meet the reviewer's expectations, and they went out and bought it. So far, this point doesn't clearly imply satisfaction or dissatisfaction. 4. The reviewer notes that the book is technical and the protagonist becomes a spy, which is in line with their interests. However, they also mention that they kept waiting for the story to get more interesting. This implies dissatisfaction with the pacing or level of excitement in the story. 5. The closing remark suggests that the book is something you can get from the public library later on in life, which does not imply strong satisfaction or endorsement.

Samuel saved their money all year..","output":"Benjamin was able to attend Comic Con, but Samuel was not, because Benjamin saved their money all year, while Samuel, unfortunately, did not. This decision by Benjamin allowed him to fulfill their lifelong dream and indulge in the emotions, experiences, and visual spectacles at Comic Con, while Samuel had to stay back and hear about it from Benjamin's colorful stories and pictures. Throughout the year, Benjamin was extremely diligent in managing his finances. He kept track of his expenses and made sure not to spend money on less necessary items or impulse purchases, knowing that prioritizing his savings would pay off in the end. He cut back on eating out, prepared his meals at home, and even canceled his streaming services. Instead, he opted for cost-effective entertainment, such as going on hikes, watching movies with friends, and enjoying the outdoors to spend his free time. On the other hand, Samuel had a completely different approach to saving money. Despite Samuel agreeing that attending Comic Con was something they both wanted to experience together, he didn't fully take it upon himself to prioritize and plan it out ahead of time. Samuel's careless attitude and lack of discipline allowed him to indulge frequently in things such as lavish dinners, luxurious items, and expensive vacations. As a result, his savings suffered, and he was unable to save enough money to join Benjamin at the convention. While Benjamin was immersed in the excitement and glory of Comic Con, attending panels from their favorite authors, artists and actors, and meeting many like-minded fans, Samuel was left to ruminate on the missed opportunity. Samuel saw the photos that Benjamin sent him and heard all about the amazing experiences he had, such as ever-popular cosplay events, rare sightings of celebrities at the convention, and exclusive first looks at new movies, TV shows, and gaming announcements. Falling into regret, Samuel finally realized the significance of planning, setting realistic goals, and saving money for important events and experiences that would last a lifetime. Samuel vowed to himself that he would learn from the mistake of not attending Comic Con and would start planning to attend the next convention. He promised nothing would get in the way of getting to meet their favorite authors, seeing panels, and exploring the wonders of the event together with Benjamin. Thus, the story of Benjamin attending Comic Con without Samuel became a turning point in both of their lives. The event not only provided Benjamin with unforgettable memories, but it instilled a lesson in Samuel about the importance of financially planning and setting realistic goals in life. As they moved forward, Samuel began emulating Benjamin's responsible financial habits, and together, they planned future adventures to make sure they didn't miss out on extraordinary experiences like attending Comic Con ever again."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Generate a detailed description of this data.","output":"The data provided pertains to a customer rating of a location or establishment called \\"The Phoenix\\", as well as its geographical location in relation to the city centre. In this case, \\"The Phoenix\\" may refer to a business, such as a restaurant, hotel, or retail store, or perhaps an attraction site within the city. Let's further analyze and elaborate on these data points. Firstly, the customer rating for \\"The Phoenix\\" is 1 out of 5. This indicates that, based on a scale where 5 denotes the highest level of consumer satisfaction and 1 represents the lowest level of satisfaction, customers seem to have a predominantly negative opinion of this establishment or location. This low rating could be due to various factors, such as poor quality of products or services, inadequate customer service, unpleasant ambience, unsanitary conditions or any number of reasons. It is essential to consider that this rating constitutes just one feedback, which might be subjective based on individual preferences. Nevertheless, it serves as a cautionary note to potential visitors to perhaps review more comments or research further before deciding to visit \\"The Phoenix\\". The second piece of data reveals that \\"The Phoenix\\" is located within the city centre. The city centre, typically considered the commercial, cultural, and administrative core of a metropolitan area, is characterized by its high concentration of businesses, attractions, and amenities. Establishments located in the city centre generally benefit from a more prominent location and better accessibility, as it is usually well-connected to various modes of transportation which allow locals and tourists alike to visit and explore the area with ease. The fact that \\"The Phoenix\\" is situated in the city centre may provide it the unique opportunity to attract high foot traffic and cater to a diverse clientele, including local residents, workers, and tourists. However, this can be a double-edged sword, as there may be stiff competition from numerous other businesses operating in the area, particularly those catering to a similar target audience as \\"The Phoenix\\". Taking into consideration the low customer rating, there is a possibility that \\"The Phoenix\\" may struggle to differentiate its offerings and maintain a strong reputation in the bustling city centre. In summary, the data provided portrays \\"The Phoenix\\" as an establishment located in the city centre, with potential advantages thanks to its central location. However, at the same time, it has a notably low customer rating of 1 out of 5, suggesting that there is significant room for improvement in terms of customer experience. It is important to take this information into account, along with additional sources of data, feedback and context, to make an informed decision or offer recommendations about \\"The Phoenix\\" and its surrounding environment."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant that follows instruction extremely well.

Are these sentences conveying the same meaning? Pick your answer from: (i) no (ii) yes","output":"(i) no These sentences are not conveying the same meaning, but they are closely related concepts in the context of mutual fund trading and pricing. Late trading and forward pricing are two mechanisms that regulate the buying and selling of mutual fund shares. Let's take a closer look at both terms: 1. Late trading: Late trading refers to the practice of placing a buy (or sell) order for mutual fund shares after the regular trading hours, specifically after 4 p.m. ET, and still getting the order executed at the same day's closing net asset value (NAV). In other words, late trading allows an investor to benefit from any intra-day price changes even though their order was submitted after the market has closed. This practice can create an unfair advantage for the late trader, as they can act on information that other investors may not have access to yet. Late trading is considered illegal and is prohibited by the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC). 2. Forward pricing: Forward pricing is a regulatory requirement stipulated by the Investment Company Act of 1940. Under this law, mutual fund shares purchased after 4 p.m. ET must be priced at the next day's closing net asset value (NAV). The objective of forward pricing is to ensure fair and equal treatment for all investors by preventing any unfair advantages that might result from late trading practices. In essence, forward pricing requires that mutual fund transactions be priced only at the prevailing NAV at the close of the next trading day. In summary, although late trading and forward pricing both relate to the timing and pricing of mutual fund transactions, they do not convey the same meaning. Late trading is an illegal practice of executing orders after regular trading hours while still benefiting from the same day's closing NAV. In contrast, forward pricing is a lawful requirement that mandates mutual fund transactions placed after 4 p.m. ET to be priced at the next trading day's closing NAV, effectively preventing any unfair advantage that could arise from late trading practices."},{"instruction":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

With so many hotels in the area you would think they would value the business of frequent guests but I was wrong on that one.","output":"The sentiment of the given review is negative. It expresses dissatisfaction and disappointment in various aspects of the hotel experience. Several factors that contribute to this negative sentiment are: 1. Disagreement over quoted prices: The reviewer is frustrated that the hotel did not honor the prices they were initially given, which likely resulted in feelings of being misled or mistreated by the establishment. 2. Unreasonable front desk behavior: The reviewer's use of the term \\"unreasonable\\" suggests that they found the hotel staff to be unhelpful, inflexible, and unsympathetic to their concerns. The mention of arguing also indicates that the interaction was far from amicable and created a hostile atmosphere. 3. Lack of appreciation for frequent guests: The reviewer feels that the hotel does not value the business of returning customers, which is disheartening, especially when considering the numerous competing hotels in the area. This perceived lack of loyalty from the hotel is likely to make the reviewer feel undervalued and disregarded. 4. Emphasis on not returning to the hotel: The reviewer's use of phrases such as \\"never ever\\" and multiple exclamation points indicate the depth of their disappointment and their determination not to return to the hotel. This major decision demonstrates the severity of the negative sentiment. 5. Unrealized expectations: The reviewer had hoped the hotel would value the business of its frequent guests, but found their expectations unmet. The realization that their assumptions were mistaken adds to the negative sentiment expressed in the review. Overall, the strong negative sentiment of the review suggests that the reviewer had a particularly bad experience with this hotel and warns potential guests of the issues they might encounter. The numerous negative aspects covered in the review paint a clear picture of the dissatisfaction and frustration felt by the reviewer."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Those implements that help you through just about any prep process and make the kitchen feel like home. For many it’s a special chef’s knife that sits just right in the hand, a cutting board with the perfect amount of countertop acreage, or maybe a sauté pan that responds to the slightest change in flame. Me? I don’t feel completely right without my rice cooker. In the modern move toward purely functional and minimalist cooking rigs, a lot of cooks purge convenience appliances and gadgets for simpler, more versatile tools. These “unitaskers” (garlic presses, asparagus tongs and electric bread machines among them) usually go into a donation or yard-sale box a few years after their emergence from gift wrap. So some serious cooks scoff at my trusty rice cooker, asking, “Why not just use a little pot and be done with it?” The answer, for anyone raised in southern Louisiana, is simple. We use rice cookers precisely because they work every time. Period. No timers, no worries, no excuses. Measure once, push a button and get on with the other tasks at hand. (There are usually plenty.) For most of the dishes in our everyday repertory, a batch of bad rice means disaster. After spending a few solid hours cooking a good gumbo or simmering Aunt Agnes’s famous redfish court-bouillon, you think that we’re going to mess up the meal by serving it over gloppy rice? And rice, for such a simple food, is not terribly forgiving. Over the years, I’ve tried all the foolproof methods for cooking our cuisine’s foundational grain. The “2 to 1” formula. The “knuckle-deep in water” trick. The “soaking method.” Several “absorption techniques.” Toasting. Steaming. Boiling. Microwaving. Pilafing. And still, I find that each routine requires just enough time and attention that I’ll mess it up about 70 percent of the time. Set the “guaranteed” 20-minute timer and on a bad night you’ll end up with a gummy blob of starch. Set the burner too low, and you’ll be rewarded with crunchy grains in tepid, salty broth. Goose the flame a bit and you have a scorched, crusty mess. A million years ago when I was in college, my mother gave me my first rice cooker after fielding a few dozen requests on how to debug our most cherished of foods. It turns out that I’d managed to screw up rice in every way imaginable. (It’s my gift, she’d tell me.) Mama learned about the cooker from an older lady at work and figured it would be worth a shot. “Just scoop with this little cup,” she told me. “Pour water to the numbered line, and press go.” I did, and a whole new world opened up. A place where each little grain is tender and intact. A land where I have one more burner on my stove and one less timer to track. A chance to be a little less crazy when I have a dozen guests knocking at my door for Monday night red beans. Ask any cook: that “little less crazy” goes a long way, and can make a kitchen feel a lot more like home. Pableaux Johnson is a food writer and photographer based in New Orleans.

Some people think rice cookers are not necessary, but for the author, it is a very useful tool. Rice cookers make perfect rice every time and don't need a lot of attention.

Please answer the following question: The more similar the DNA molecules of different species are, the closer the relationship is likely to be.  Two species with dissimilar DNA should have a close or distant relationship? Answer:","output":"Two species with dissimilar DNA should have a distant relationship. Justification:  The premise of the question mentions that the more similar the DNA molecules of different species are, the closer the relationship is likely to be. In genetics, this similarity is often referred to as genetic similarity or DNA sequence homology. It is used to assess how closely species are related in terms of evolutionary descent.  By logical extension, if two species have dissimilar or significantly different DNA, they would not share a close relationship. In other words, the differences in their DNA suggest they do not share a recent common ancestor, thus making their relationship distant.  Genetic diversity (having dissimilar DNA) tends to increase the farther apart species are on the evolutionary tree, reflecting the accumulation of mutations and other genetic changes over time. Consequently, species with significantly different DNA sequences are typically quite distant in evolutionary terms."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant. You will be given a task.

In 2010,. the action of a friend changed Rachelle Friedman's life when an innocent. push into a pool at her bachelorette party left her a quadriplegic. Now. a wife and an advocate for people with spinal cord injuries, she is. hoping her life will be changed again by the actions of a friend — one. who has agreed to carry her first child. Rachelle,. 28, plans to become a mother with the help of Laurel Humes, a friend she. met while attending East Carolina University. Humes, 31, has agreed to. serve as a gestational surrogate for Rachelle and her husband, Chris. Chapman. Paralyzed bride: Rachelle Friedman became paralyzed from the waist down after a tragic accident at her bachelorette party more than four years ago. Pictured above at her Knightdale, North Carolina home on June 25. Starting a family: Friedman and her husband Chris Chapman (pictured on their wedding day three years ago) now plan on having a child through a surrogate. However, not all have been supportive of Rachelle's decision to get pregnant, considering her physical handicap. When Rachelle wrote about her desire to become a mother through surrogacy on her blog on March, she received some negative feedback. 'People. will say, \\"She can't be a mom; she's in a wheelchair.\\" That's a little. frustrating,' Rachelle said. 'No one judges a single mother or a single. father's physical ability to raise a kid, so why am I a hindrance? 'I can hold the baby. I'll be able to change diapers and feed it and comfort it and dress it,' she said. 'All. those things are going to take a little longer, but I can still do all. those things. ... I know plenty of people in wheelchairs who are parents. who are amazing parents.' Frustrating: Some have criticized Friedman's decision to become a mother through surrogacy, saying her physical handicap would impact her parenting abilities. Despite receiving some negative comments, the blog post also caught the attention of surrogate-to-be Humes, the former college friend who followed the couple's story on social media. 'When I. saw that Rachelle was looking for a surrogate, I thought, \\"You know,. this is something I really want to do,\\"' Humes said. '... She responded. right away and said, \\"Wow! That's the nicest thing anyone's ever offered. to do for me.\\"' Humes,. who lives in Asheville with her husband and their 2-year-old son, is. scheduled to travel to California next month for the embryo transfer. 'I. was just assuming we would have to hire someone,' said Rachelle, who. has established an account with gofundme.com to help cover expenses. 'I. think a lot of people were like, \\"What about one of the bridesmaids and. the girl who did it?\\" But none of those girls have ever been moms, ever been pregnant, are. just not in that mind-set, I guess. That alone didn't make me feel. comfortable. I wanted someone who had been pregnant before, who knew. what they were doing. Also, as far as the friend who was involved, I. didn't want this to start off with guilt.' For Humes, the prospect of surrogacy is exciting. 'I feel really good about it,' she said. 'They're going to be great parents, and I'm really excited to watch their family grow.' Rachelle and Chris also have not ruled out a second child. After the initial transfer, the couple plans to keep one embryo. 'In. 10 years, who knows where I'll be physically?' Rachelle asked. 'If. there's a cure in five years and I'm able to carry one, I would love to. have another one.' They are considering donating any remaining embryos to help change someone else's life. 'Having. the difficulty we're having,' Rachelle said, 'you know some couples. just struggle forever. So (for them) to have a healthy embryo,. eventually maybe I'll donate one.' Busy: In the four years since the accident, Friedman has gotten married, and published a book titled 'The Promise' Rachelle isn't letting the negativity get to her. More than four years after her tragic accident and nearly three years after her idyllic wedding, Rachelle's life is going well. In the last three months, she has secured a surrogate, traveled to California for in vitro fertilization and released a book, 'The Promise: A Tragic Accident, a Paralyzed Bride and the Power of Love, Loyalty and Friendship.' That book was not part of the plan when Rachelle received her degree in recreation management in 2008. Before the accident that left her paralyzed from the chest down, she worked as a program assistant at a seniors activity center and taught aerobics and line dancing. 'I never enjoyed writing,' Rachelle said. 'I never enjoyed having to write a paper, so it was really interesting that once I had something to say (I did).' In 'The Promise,' which she wrote with former journalist and media consultant Stephanie Krikorian, Rachelle has a lot to say. The book, released in May, not only retells the events of the now-famous accident following her bachelorette party but also shares the love story that brought her there. Promises: In her book, Friedman details the night of the accident but continues to protect the identity of the bridesmaid who pushed her into the pool. Rachelle met her very first boyfriend and the man who would become her husband during her freshman year at ECU, just before Halloween in 2004. Though she and Chris are both from Virginia Beach, and they would later learn that their paths had crossed many times, they never knew one another until both were off at college, 150 miles from home. The two were best friends long before any romance blossomed. 'My love story means so much to me, and everyone wanted the friend (bridesmaids) story,' Rachelle said of the book, which originally was to be titled 'The Pact,' a reference to the fact that neither she nor her bridesmaids have ever disclosed the identity of the bridesmaid who pushed Rachelle into the pool. Friedman and Chapman are thinking about donating their remaining embryos to another couple struggling to get pregnant. '(The Pact) made it sound like we all sat around and did like some blood promise to each other or something,' she said. 'We didn't sit there beside the pool and say this out loud. ... (The Promise) was supposed to mean not just my friends but also me and Chris.' 'The Promise' does expound on the reasons behind the unspoken agreement to keep silent about the friend responsible for the push, a young woman who struggled with debilitating guilt and depression for years after the accident. In the book, the names of all the women who were by the pool the night of the accident have been altered. 'None of us has ever revealed the name of the girl who playfully pushed me that night, and none of us ever will,' Rachelle wrote. 'Protecting her has always been too important, her feelings too important, the situation too fragile and fraught with potential pain. Besides, it could have been any one of us.' As the media relentlessly pursued the woman's identity, the decision to withhold her friend's name proved, at times, to be a costly one. One magazine offered to pay Rachelle for the revelation, and she turned down an interview with Oprah Winfrey after being told the talk show host wanted the bridesmaid in question to come on the show, too. Rachelle has learned to take both the criticism and the compliments in stride. 'I appreciate the compliments, I guess,' she said. 'People were like, \\"That's so amazing of you not to say anything.\\" ... I think I've done a lot of amazing things, but not throwing my friend to the wolves while she was depressed is not one of them.' Since the accident, Rachelle, a former lifeguard and cheerleader, has taken up wheelchair rugby and hand cycling. She has learned to surf and to drive again. She also has become a motivational speaker and an advocate for others with spinal cord injuries. Though Rachelle has had a chance to personally reach out to a fellow Knightdale resident who was paralyzed in a motorcycle accident, most of the encouragement she offers has been virtual. '(People) sent letter after letter to my Facebook inbox and my email,' she wrote. '... People wanted to relate to me and wrote things like \\"My son had this happen to him,\\" or \\"I am married to a quadriplegic.\\" They were trying to connect, and I quickly learned I had the strength to help them.' Fans of 'The Promise' already are asking if there will be a sequel on motherhood. Rachelle said she plans to blog about her experience and has not ruled out a second book.
