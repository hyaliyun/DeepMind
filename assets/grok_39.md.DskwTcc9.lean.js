Let's consider the function f(x) = 2x^3 - 2x defined on the interval [-1, 1]. 2. We will use the arithmetic and geometric mean inequality (AM-GM inequality), which states that for non-negative numbers a and b:         frac{a + b}{2} geq sqrt{ab}     3. Apply this inequality to the numbers a = x^2 and b = 1 - x^2 (noting that x^2 geq 0 and 1 - x^2 geq 0 for x in [-1, 1]):        frac{x^2 + (1 - x^2)}{2} geq sqrt{x^2 cdot (1 - x^2)}      4.

Inequality (5) implies that the values of f(x) on the interval [-1, 1] are bounded within the unit circle with radius 1 and centered at the origin (0, 0). Therefore, the maximum distance between any two points on the graph of f(x) is at most the diameter of this circle, which is 2. 7. Indeed, this maximum distance of 2 can be attained, for instance, by the points A = (-1, 0) and D = (1, 0). 8. To verify that the maximum distance is 2, consider the equality condition in the AM-GM inequality: equality holds if and only if x^2 = 1 - x^2, which yields x = pm frac{1}{sqrt{2}}. 9. This gives two more points: B = left(-frac{1}{sqrt{2}}, frac{1}{sqrt{2}}right) and C = left(frac{1}{sqrt{2}}, -frac{1}{sqrt{2}}right). 10.

Assuming a month has 4 weeks: Fiona's monthly pay is 800/week * 4 weeks/month = 3200/month. John's monthly pay is 600/week * 4 weeks/month = 2400/month. Now, let's add Fiona's and John's monthly pay to find the total pay for both of them: Total pay for Fiona and John = 3200 + 2400 = 5600. Now, let's find out how much is left for Jeremy's pay: Total pay for Jeremy = Total boss's expenditure - Total pay for Fiona and John Total pay for Jeremy = 7600 - 5600 = 2000. Now, let's calculate the number of hours Jeremy works per week: Jeremy's weekly pay = Total pay for Jeremy / 4 weeks/month Jeremy's weekly pay = 2000 / 4 = 500/week. Now, let's find out how many hours Jeremy works per week: Jeremy's hours per week = Jeremy's weekly pay / Pay rate per hour Jeremy's hours per week = 500 / 20/hour = 25 hours/week.

We want to find the probability that at least one of the two randomly chosen students is interested in investment banking. To do this, it's easier to calculate the probability that neither of the two students is interested in investment banking and then subtract that from 1 (the total probability). The probability that the first student chosen is not interested in investment banking is 5/20 (since there are 5 out of 20 who are not interested). If the first student is not interested, then there are 4 students not interested left out of the remaining 19 students.

The combined probability that both students chosen are not interested in investment banking is the product of the two individual probabilities: (5/20) * (4/19) = 1/4 * 4/19 = 1/19 Now, to find the probability that at least one of the two students is interested in investment banking, we subtract the above probability from 1: 1 - 1/19 = 19/19 - 1/19 = 18/19 So the probability that at least one of the two students chosen at random is interested in investment banking is boxed{18/19} ."},{"instruction":"The integer 9 can be represented as the sum of two consecutive integers: ( 9 = 4 + 5 ). Additionally, 9 can be written in two different ways as the sum of consecutive natural numbers: ( 9 = 4 + 5 = 2 + 3 + 4 ).  The question is whether there exists a natural number ( N ) such that: 1. It is the sum of 1990 consecutive integers. 2. It can be expressed in exactly 1990 different ways as the sum of consecutive integers.","output":"1. We start by analyzing the first condition. We need N to be the sum of 1990 consecutive integers. Let these integers be n, n+1, n+2, ldots, n+1989. The sum N of these integers is:    [    N = n + (n+1) + (n+2) + cdots + (n+1989)    ]    This can be expressed using the formula for the sum of an arithmetic series:    [    N = frac{1990}{2} times (2n + 1989)    ]    Simplifying, we get:    [    N = 995 times (2n + 1989)    ] 2. From the above expression, it is clear that N must be an odd number, since 2n+1989 is always odd. 3. Next, consider N to be written as the sum of k+1 consecutive natural numbers, starting with the smallest integer m. Then:    [    N = m + (m+1) + cdots + (m+k)    ]    Using the sum of an arithmetic series again, we get:    [    N = frac{k+1}{2} times (2m + k)    ]    Therefore:    [    2N = (k+1)(2m + k)    ]    From the initial condition, we also have:    [    1990(2n + 1989) = (k+1)(2m + k)    ] 4. To satisfy the second condition, we need N to be expressible as the sum of consecutive integers in exactly 1990 different ways. These (m, k) pairs must satisfy the above equation. For any valid pair (m, k), the integer k+1 must be a divisor of 2N. Also, it must hold that:    [    k+1 < sqrt{2N}    ] 5. Since the number of valid pairs (m, k) corresponds to the number of divisors of 2N that are less than sqrt{2N}, it's enough to find an N such that 2N has 1990 divisors. The factors of 995(2n + 1989) play a critical role here. 6. Analyze the prime factorization of 2N. Given:    [    2N = 1990 times (2n + 1989) = 2 times 5 times 199 times (2n + 1989)    ]    To make 2N have 3980 distinct divisors (because counting both divisors less than and greater than sqrt{2N} gives double the number of pairs), we need the following:    [    2N = 2^a times 5^b times 199^c times p_1^{d_1} times p_2^{d_2} times cdots times p_k^{d_k}    ]    where a, b, c, d_1, d_2, ldots, d_k are such that:    [    (a+1)(b+1)(c+1)(d_1+1)(d_2+1)cdots(d_k+1) = 3980    ] 7.

Since ( m-j leq m ), we have ( m geq frac{n+99}{m-j} ). 4. **Finding a Lower Bound for ( m ):**    - To find a lower bound for ( m ), we need to consider the smallest possible divisor from Vasya's list that can divide the largest number in Petya's list.    - The smallest possible divisor from Vasya's list is ( m-98 ).    - Therefore, ( m-98 ) must divide ( n+99 ). 5. **Formulating the Inequality:**    - Let ( d = m-98 ). Then ( d ) divides ( n+99 ), and we have ( m = d + 98 ).    - Since ( d ) divides ( n+99 ), we can write ( n+99 = kd ) for some integer ( k ).    - Thus, ( d = frac{n+99}{k} ). 6. **Substituting ( d ) into ( m ):**    - Substituting ( d ) into the expression for ( m ), we get:      [      m = frac{n+99}{k} + 98      ]    - To find a lower bound for ( m ), we need to minimize ( k ).

The general steps of analogical reasoning are: (1) Identify the similarities or consistencies between two types of things; (2) Use the properties of one type of thing to infer the properties of another type of thing, resulting in a clear proposition (conjecture)."},{"instruction":"Let {a_n} be a geometric sequence composed of positive numbers, and a_4a_7+a_5a_6=18, log_3a_1+log_3a_2+ldots+log_3a_{10}=　　() A: 12 B: 10 C: 8 D: 2+log_3 5","output":"Since in a geometric sequence, a_4a_7+a_5a_6=18,   it follows that a_4a_7=a_5a_6=a_1a_{10},   which means 2a_1a_{10}=18, thus a_1a_{10}=9,   then log_3a_1+log_3a_2+ldots+log_3a_{10}=log_3(a_1a_2ldots a_{10})=log_3(a_1a_{10})^5=5log_3 9=5times 2=10,   therefore, the correct choice is: boxed{B}   This problem mainly tests the application of properties of geometric sequences, combined with the rules of logarithmic operations for solving."},{"instruction":"Given the function f(x) = x^3  6x^2 + 3x + t, where t in mathbb{R}, (1) Find the interval of monotonic decrease for the function f(x).

For f(x) to be monotonically decreasing, f'(x) < 0,  3x^2 - 12x + 3 < 0.  Factor out a 3 to simplify the inequality:  x^2 - 4x + 1 < 0.  Solving this quadratic inequality can be achieved by finding the roots of the corresponding equation:  x^2 - 4x + 1 = 0,  which can be solved by textbf{completing the square} or using the quadratic formula:  x = frac{4 pm sqrt{16 - 4(1)(1)}}{2} = frac{4 pm sqrt{12}}{2} = 2 pm sqrt{3}.  So the function f(x) is decreasing in the interval boxed{(2 - sqrt{3}, 2 + sqrt{3})}. (2) To find when g(x) = e^x f(x) has only one extreme point, we first compute the derivative:  g'(x) = (3x^2 - 12x + 3)e^x + (x^3 - 6x^2 + 3x + t)e^x = (x^3 - 9x^2 + 9x + t + 3)e^x.  For g(x) to have only one extreme point, the polynomial x^3 - 9x^2 + 9x + t + 3 must have exactly one root that crosses the x-axis, meaning one sign change in the derivative g'(x). Let's consider the function h(x) = x^3 - 9x^2 + 9x + t + 3. Its derivative is:  h'(x) = 3x^2 - 18x + 9 = 3(x^2 - 6x + 3) = 3(x - 3)(x + 1).  The derivative h'(x) > 0 for x < -1 or x > 3, indicating sections where h(x) is increasing. Since h(x) increases both on the intervals (-infty, -1) and (3, +infty) and decreases on (-1, 3), for g(x) to have only one extreme point, the values of h(-1) and h(3) must have the same sign or one of them must be zero. We calculate:  h(-1) = (-1)^3 - 9(-1)^2 + 9(-1) + t + 3 = -1 - 9 - 9 + t + 3 = t - 16,   h(3) = (3)^3 - 9(3)^2 + 9(3) + t + 3 = 27 - 81 + 27 + t + 3 = t - 24.  For h(-1)h(3) to be non-negative, we must have either t - 16 geq 0 and t - 24 leq 0 or vice versa. However, this is impossible, so at least one of them must be zero, leading to t = 16 or t = 24. Hence, we have h(-1)h(3) geq 0, which implies that t leq 16 or t geq 24.

The number of students enrolled at school XX this year is 7 percent more than last year, so the increase in students at school XX is ( 0.07X ).

First, let's find the time for one revolution for each searchlight: - Searchlight A: 3 revolutions per minute (rpm) means it takes 1/3 of a minute for one revolution. Since there are 60 seconds in a minute, it takes 60 / 3 = 20 seconds for one revolution. - Searchlight B: 4 rpm means it takes 1/4 of a minute for one revolution, so 60 / 4 = 15 seconds for one revolution. - Searchlight C: 5 rpm means it takes 1/5 of a minute for one revolution, so 60 / 5 = 12 seconds for one revolution. Now, we need to find the least common multiple (LCM) of the times for one revolution to determine the period after which the pattern of illumination repeats itself. The LCM of 20, 15, and 12 seconds is 60 seconds. This means that every 60 seconds, the searchlights will be in the same position as they started. To find the probability that a man will stay in the dark for at least 15 seconds, we need to consider the intervals when all searchlights are not pointing at the same spot. However, since the searchlights are independent of each other and make different numbers of revolutions per minute, there is no simple period during which all searchlights are guaranteed to be off the man simultaneously for a continuous 15-second interval. The probability of the man staying in the dark for at least boxed{15}  seconds would depend on the specific timing and positioning of the searchlights, which is not provided in the question. Therefore, with the given information, we cannot calculate the exact probability. Additional information about the overlap of the searchlights' paths and the duration of darkness they create when not pointing at the same spot would be required to solve this problem."},{"instruction":"Given the onevariable quadratic equation x^{2}5x+m=0, if the equation has two real roots x_{1} and x_{2}, and satisfies 3x_{1}2x_{2}=5, then the value of the real number m is ____.","output":"To solve for the value of m in the given quadratic equation x^{2}-5x+m=0, where the equation has two real roots x_{1} and x_{2} satisfying 3x_{1}-2x_{2}=5, we proceed as follows: 1. **Relationship between roots and coefficients**: For a quadratic equation ax^{2}+bx+c=0, the sum of its roots x_{1}+x_{2}=-frac{b}{a}, and the product of its roots x_{1}x_{2}=frac{c}{a}. Applying this to our equation, we get x_{1}+x_{2}=5 and x_{1}x_{2}=m. 2. **Manipulating the given equation involving roots**: We are given 3x_{1}-2x_{2}=5. We can express this as 3(x_{1}+x_{2})-5x_{2}=5 by adding and subtracting 3x_{2} to the left side. Knowing that x_{1}+x_{2}=5, we substitute to get 3cdot5-5x_{2}=5. 3. **Solving for x_{2}**: Simplifying the equation from step 2 gives us 15-5x_{2}=5. Solving for x_{2}, we find -5x_{2}=-10, which simplifies to x_{2}=2. 4. **Finding m by substituting x_{2}**: Knowing that x_{1}x_{2}=m and x_{2}=2, we substitute x_{2} into the equation to find m.

Explain your answer.","output":"To check if Ruslan and Kolya can each pay 2006 rubles using the same number of coins but of different denominations (1, 2, 5 rubles), we need to analyze the conditions provided. 1. **Ruslan and Kolya have no coins of the same denomination**: This means that if one has coins of 1 ruble, the other doesn't have any coins of 1 ruble, and similarly for other denominations. 2. **Let's assume they both need to make 2006 rubles using the same number of coins**: Let ( k ) be the number of coins each of them uses. 3. **Analysis assuming possible denominations**:     - If Kolya has 5-ruble coins, then:         [         5 times k = 2006         ]         Clearly, ( 2006 / 5 = 401.2 ), which is not an integer. Thus, Kolya cannot pay using only 5-ruble coins.     - If Kolya has 1-ruble coins, then:         [         1 times k = 2006         ]         This makes ( k = 2006 ), meaning Kolya has 2006 coins of 1 ruble each.         - Then Ruslan must use a combination of 2-ruble and 5-ruble coins without any 1-ruble coins. The total number of coins must still be 2006. But the total value cannot be formed precisely because:             - The smallest denomination (2 rubles) combined would quickly reach a number exceeding 2006 rubles if other coins are included.         - Alternatively, Ruslan could not just use 5-ruble coins, as previously shown.     - Assume Kolya has 2-ruble coins:         [         2 times k = 2006         ]         This makes ( k = 1003 ). So Kolya needs 1003 coins of 2 rubles each. 4. **Result of each scenario**:     - Kolya successfully creates 2006 rubles using 1003 coins of 2 rubles each.     - If Ruslan needs to make a combination of 1 and 5-ruble coins:         [         x times 1 + y times 5 = 2006         ]         [         x + y = 1003         ]         Expressing it in terms of even and odd counts:         - With a mixed count of both 1-ruble (odd) and 5-ruble (odd) coins, the resulting ( x ) and ( y ) must alternatively sum to 2006 rubles, which is an even value. However:         [         x + y = text{odd } k = 1003         ]         This contradiction signifies the impossibility of forming 2006 rubles with an exact even mix meeting odd counts of either denominations. # Conclusion: Based on the above reasoning, it's clear that Ruslan and Kolya cannot both provide 2006 rubles using the same number of coins which are of different denominations.

Since both the train and the platform are 300 meters long, the total distance is: 300 meters (train) + 300 meters (platform) = 600 meters We are given that the train crosses this 600-meter distance in 36 seconds. To find the speed of the train, we use the formula: Speed = Distance / Time So the speed of the train is: Speed = 600 meters / 36 seconds = 16.67 meters per second Now, to find out how long it takes for the train to cross the signal pole, we only need to consider the length of the train, since the signal pole can be assumed to have negligible width compared to the length of the train. Using the speed we just calculated, we can find the time it takes to cross the signal pole (which is the same as the length of the train, 300 meters) with the formula: Time = Distance / Speed Time = 300 meters / 16.67 meters per second ≈ 18 seconds Therefore, it takes approximately boxed{18}  seconds for the train to cross the signal pole."},{"instruction":"Megan has lost Fatima's phone number again.

Let's write down the steps clearly. 1. **Understanding the Fibonacci Sequence**:    The Fibonacci sequence is defined by the recurrence relation:    [    F_1 = 1, quad F_2 = 1, quad text{and} quad F_{n+2} = F_{n+1} + F_n quad text{for} quad n geq 1    ] 2. **GCD of Fibonacci Numbers**:    For any integers ( m ) and ( n ), the GCD of two Fibonacci numbers has a special property. Specifically:    [    gcd(F_m, F_n) = F_{gcd(m, n)}    ]    This means that the greatest common divisor of Fibonacci numbers ( F_m ) and ( F_n ) is the Fibonacci number indexed by the greatest common divisor of ( m ) and ( n ). This result can be derived from properties such as the periodicity of Fibonacci numbers in modular arithmetic. 3. **Application to the Problem**:    To solve the given problem, we need the values:    [    gcd(F_{2017}, F_{99} F_{101} + 1)    ]    Based on the property of the GCD of Fibonacci numbers, we have to consider ( F_{99} times F_{101} + 1 ). 4. **Evaluate ( gcd(2017, 99 times 101 + 1) )**:    [    99 times 101 = 9999    ]    Therefore,    [    99 times 101 + 1 = 9999 + 1 = 10000    ]    We now need:    [    gcd(F_{2017}, F_{10000})    ] 5. **Further Simplification**:    Based on the GCD property of Fibonacci numbers:    [    gcd(F_{2017}, F_{10000}) = F_{gcd(2017, 10000)}    ]    We now find the GCD of ( 2017 ) and ( 10000 ). 6. **Calculate the GCD**:    Using the Euclidean algorithm:    [    begin{aligned}    10000 &= 4 times 2017 + 1932,     2017 &= 1 times 1932 + 85,     1932 &= 22 times 85 + 52,     85 &= 1 times 52 + 33,     52 &= 1 times 33 + 19,     33 &= 1 times 19 + 14,     19 &= 1 times 14 + 5,     14 &= 2 times 5 + 4,     5 &= 1 times 4 + 1,     4 &= 4 times 1 + 0.    end{aligned}    ]    So, the GCD of ( 2017 ) and ( 10000 ) is ( 1 ). 7. **Final Calculation**:    Thus,    [    gcd(F_{2017}, F_{10000}) = F_1 = 1    ] 8. **Verification**:    We need to ensure:    [    gcd(F_{2017}, F_{99} F_{101} + 1) = gcd(F_{2017}, F_{10000}) = 1    ] # Conclusion: [ boxed{1} ]"},{"instruction":"Let ( p ) be a prime, and let ( a_{1}, ldots, a_{p} ) be integers.

This corresponds to finding G_k where at least frac{1}{2}p vertices are not connected, thus representing distinct values. 3. **Counting Edges and Pigeonhole Argument**:    Each pair {i, j} with i neq j appears in exactly one G_k. That is, for any distinct i and j, there is a unique k modulo p making a_i + ik equiv a_j + jk pmod{p}. Thus, there are binom{p}{2} = frac{p(p-1)}{2} such pairs. By the pigeonhole principle, for some k, the number of edges in G_k is at most:    [    frac{1}{p} binom{p}{2} = frac{1}{p} cdot frac{p(p-1)}{2} = frac{p-1}{2}    ] 4. **Vertices and Components**:    The vertices of G_k can be part of either a connected component or an unconnected one. A graph's connected components and edges relate through the inequality:    [    text{Number of components} geq p - text{Number of edges}    ]    Applying this, for the graph G_k, the number of components is at least:    [    p - frac{p-1}{2} = frac{p+1}{2}    ] 5. **Conclusion**:    Thus, there exists k for which the numbers a_1 + k, a_2 + 2k, ldots, a_p + pk yield frac{p+1}{2} distinct remainders modulo p. Since frac{p+1}{2} geq frac{1}{2}p, we conclude that there are at least frac{1}{2}p distinct remainders.

Consider the central term of the row in Pascal's triangle. Based on previous definitions, denote the central term of the ( n )-th row as ( v_0 ). The terms to the right of ( v_0 ) can be denoted as ( v_1, v_2, ldots, v_k ). The right half of the ( 2k )-th row consists of the terms:    [    frac{k}{k+1}, frac{k-1}{k+2}, ldots, frac{2}{2k-1}, frac{1}{2k}    ]    By the definition of Pascal's triangle, the ratios between consecutive terms are given by:    [    frac{v_1}{v_0} = frac{k}{k+1}, quad frac{v_2}{v_1} = frac{k-1}{k+2}, ldots, quad frac{v_{k-1}}{v_{k-2}} = frac{2}{2k-1}, quad frac{v_k}{v_{k-1}} = frac{1}{2k}    ] 2. **Calculating the product of ratios**: Next, let's calculate the ratio ( frac{v_s}{v_0} ) for any integer ( s ) between 0 and ( k ):    [    frac{v_s}{v_0} = frac{v_1}{v_0} times frac{v_2}{v_1} times cdots times frac{v_s}{v_{s-1}} = frac{k}{k+1} times frac{k-1}{k+2} times cdots times frac{k-s+1}{k+s}    ] 3. **Rewriting the product**: We rearrange the terms in the products for a clearer form:    [    frac{v_s}{v_0} = frac{k}{k+s} times frac{k-1}{k+s-1} times cdots times frac{k-s+1}{k+1}    ] 4. **Bounding the product**: Observe that among all these factors, the largest term is the first factor and the smallest term is the last factor. Therefore, we can bound the product:    [    left(1 - frac{s}{k+1}right)^s leq frac{v_s}{v_0} leq left(1 - frac{s}{k+s}right)^s    ] 5. **Asymptotic estimation**: Notice that ( frac{1}{k+1} ) and ( frac{1}{k+s} ) both tend towards zero as ( k ) increases, simplifying our approximation:    [    left(frac{k+1-s}{k+1}right)^s leq frac{v_s}{v_0} leq left(frac{k}{k+s}right)^s    ] 6. **Result for even ( n )**: Since all the terms ( v_s ) for ( s = 0, 1, ldots, k ) are bounded by the largest central term in the row, and given that ( v_0 < frac{1}{sqrt{2k}} = frac{1}{sqrt{n}} ), we have:    [    v_s < frac{1}{sqrt{n}} quad text{for all} quad s = 0, 1, ldots, k    ] 7. **Extension to odd ( n )**: Now let ( n = 2k - 1 ). In a row with an odd number (no central term), the largest terms are the two middle terms, ( Z_n^{-1} ) and ( Z_n^{1} ). These are equal in magnitude, i.e.,     [    Z_n^{1} = frac{Z_n^{-1} + Z_n^{1}}{2} = Z_{n+1}^{0}    ]    Following the same argument presented earlier, we find ( Z_{n+1}^{0} < frac{1}{sqrt{n+1}} ). Consequently,     [    Z_n^{1} < frac{1}{sqrt{n+1}} < frac{1}{sqrt{n}}    ]    As ( Z_n^{1} ) and ( Z_n^{-1} ) are the largest in the row, all other terms in the row ( n ) are also less than ( frac{1}{sqrt{n}} ). **Conclusion**: For any row number ( n ), all elements in the ( n )-th row of Pascal's triangle are bounded above by ( frac{1}{sqrt{n}} ).

The distances AB and CD are both 39, and the length of segment PQ is 48. We need to find the sum overline{AR}+overline{BR}+overline{CR}+overline{DR}, where R is the midpoint of overline{PQ}. 2. **Radical Axis and Power of a Point**: Since P and Q lie on all four circles, segment PQ is the radical axis for any pair of these circles. The power of point R with respect to any circle is the square of the length of the tangent from R to the circle, which equals PR^2 = (frac{PQ}{2})^2 = 24^2. 3. **Setting Up Equations**: Let's consider circles A and B first.

Since R is the midpoint of PQ, and PQ is the radical axis, the sum of distances from R to each pair of opposite circle centers (which are equidistant from R) is equal to the distance between the centers, i.e., AB = CD = 39.

The gas is heated, causing the piston to accelerate uniformly with an acceleration a. The average power of the heater is P. We are to determine the maximum height the piston reaches above the edge of the vessel. The molar heat capacity of the gas at constant volume is c_{V}, and the acceleration due to gravity is g. 2. **Process Analysis:**    Since the piston moves uniformly, the process can be assumed to be isobaric (constant pressure). According to the first law of thermodynamics:    [    Q = p Delta V + n c_{V} Delta T    ]    Here, (p) is the pressure of the gas, (V) is the volume, and (n) is the number of moles of gas. 3. **Using the Ideal Gas Law:**    The relationship between pressure and temperature for an ideal gas undergoing an isobaric process gives:    [    p Delta V = n R Delta T    ]    where (R) is the ideal gas constant. 4. **Energy Consideration:**    The work done by the gas on the piston as it moves a distance (x) with uniform acceleration can be related to the kinetic energy theorem:    [    p Delta V = frac{1}{2} M (a tau)^2    ]    Here, (tau) is the time for which the piston moves under acceleration. 5. **Temperature Change Calculation:**    Using (p Delta V = n R Delta T), we get:    [    n Delta T = frac{M (a tau)^2}{2 R}    ] 6. **Heat Transferred:**    The total heat (Q) supplied is:    [    Q = frac{M (a tau)^2}{2} + frac{n c_{V} M (a tau)^2}{2 R}    ]    Simplifying, we obtain:    [    Q = frac{M (a tau)^2}{2} left(1 + frac{c_{V}}{R}right)    ] 7. **Relating Power and Time:**    The average power (P) relates to the heat supplied and time:    [    P = frac{Q}{tau} = frac{M a tau}{2} left(1 + frac{c_{V}}{R}right)    ] 8. **Velocity Consideration:**    At the vessel's edge, the velocity of the piston (v) is:    [    v = a tau    ] 9. **Free Space Motion:**    After exiting the vessel, the piston continues to move upwards with this velocity. The time, (tau'), it takes for the piston to reach its maximum height in free motion under gravity is:    [    v = g tau'    ]    Solving for (tau'), we get:    [    tau' = frac{v}{g} = frac{a tau}{g}    ] 10. **Maximum Height Calculation:**     The maximum height (h) reached above the edge of the vessel is given by the kinematic equation:     [     h = v tau' - frac{1}{2} g (tau')^2     ]     Substituting for (v = a tau) and (tau' = frac{a tau}{g}):     [     h = a tau cdot frac{a tau}{g} - frac{1}{2} g left(frac{a tau}{g}right)^2     ]     Simplifying:     [     h = frac{a^2 tau^2}{g} - frac{1}{2} frac{a^2 tau^2}{g} = frac{1}{2} frac{a^2 tau^2}{g}     ] 11. **Power Time Relationship:**     Using (P = frac{M a^2 tau}{2} left(1 + frac{c_{V}}{R}right)), solve for (tau):     [     tau = frac{2P}{M a^2 left(1 + frac{c_{V}}{R}right)}     ] 12. **Substitute (tau):**     Substitute (tau) in the height equation:     [     h = frac{1}{2} frac{a^2}{g} left( frac{2P}{M a^2 left(1 + frac{c_{V}}{R}right)} right)^2      ]     Simplify to find the maximum height:     [     h = frac{1}{2} frac{a^2}{g} cdot frac{4 P^2}{M^2 a^4 left(1 + frac{c_{V}}{R}right)^2} = frac{2 P^2}{M^2 g a^2 left(1 + frac{c_{V}}{R}right)^2}     ]. # Conclusion: [ boxed{h = frac{2 P^2}{M^2 g a^2 left(1 + frac{c_{V}}{R}right)^2}} ]"},{"instruction":"Twelve solid steel balls, each with a radius of 2 inches, are melted down to form a solid steel cylinder.

Next, we examine this condition:    [    mid text{ЛИ} - text{ПО} + text{НО} - text{ИН} mid = k cdot 10 + m cdot 9 equiv 0 pmod{101}    ]    where k and m are coefficients in the linear combination reflecting the digit pairs, simplifying further:    [   |9(text{НО} - text{ИН})| mod 10 = mid text{НО} - text{ИН} mid  pmod{101}   ] 6. Since different letters correspond to different digits, and the modulo result cannot be 0, we must check the equivalence regarding:    [   | text{НО} - text{ИН}| equiv 1 (pmod{10})   ]    Since this yields a value dependent on uniquely distinct digit placements, a contradiction emerges because a base difference per equivalence cannot consistently resolve to 1. 7. We achieve a contradiction by inspecting:    [    101 = | text{ЛИ} - text{ПО} + text{НО} - text{ИН}| leq 10|text{ЛИ} - text{ПО}| + 9     ]    eigenvalues are confined to a system exceeding summative bounds defined by 99:    [    10| text{ЛИ} - text{ПО}| + 9 leqslant 99    ] 8. Since our alternating pair sum criterion leads to an unresolvable contradiction under these modular conditions, a solution is not feasible within our rearrangement: **Conclusion:**  [ boxed{text{Нет}} ]"},{"instruction":"f  a, b, c ge 4  are integers, not all equal, and  4abc = (a+3)(b+3)(c+3)  then what is the value of  a+b+c  ?","output":"1.

If ( a ) and ( b ) are distinct, draw an edge between them. 2. **Assumption and Vertex-Edge Relationship**:    - Assume, for contradiction, that ( |V| le n^{0.666} ).    - The number of edges ( |E| ) is at least ( n - |V| ). For sufficiently large ( n ), this implies ( |E| ge n^{0.9995} ). 3. **Edge Pairs and Jensen’s Inequality**:    - Define an edge pair ((a, b, c)) as a set of edges ((a, b)) and ((b, c)).    - By Jensen’s inequality, the number of edge pairs is at least ( |V| binom{frac{2|E|}{|V|}}{2} ge n^{1.3325} ). 4. **Possible Pairs and Pigeonhole Principle**:    - The number of possible pairs of vertices ((a, c)) is at most ( binom{|V|}{2} le n^{1.332} ).    - By the pigeonhole principle, there exists at least one pair ((a, c)) such that there are ( m ge n^{0.0005} ) vertices ( b_1, b_2, ldots, b_m ) where all ((a, b_i, c)) are edge pairs. 5. **Distinct Solutions and Number of Factors**:    - Each edge pair ((a, b_i, c)) represents a distinct solution to the equation ((x - y)(x + y) = x^2 - y^2 = c - a), where ( |c - a| < n^2 ).    - It is known that for any (epsilon > 0), there exists an integer ( N_epsilon ) such that the number of distinct factors of ( k < N_epsilon ) is less than ( N_epsilon^epsilon ). 6. **Applying the Known Result**:    - Take (epsilon = 0.0002). For sufficiently large ( n > N_epsilon ), the number of distinct solutions to the equation is less than ( n^{2 cdot 0.0002} < n^{0.0005} ). 7. **Contradiction**:    - This contradicts the earlier finding that there are at least ( n^{0.0005} ) such solutions. Therefore, our assumption that ( |V| le n^{0.666} ) must be false. 8. **Conclusion**:    - Hence, there exists a positive integer ( N ) such that if ( n ge N ), then ( |A| > n^{0.666} ).

There must be some ( n in P ) such that all integers from ( 1 ) to ( q-1 ) divide ( n ), but ( q ) does not divide ( n ). 4. **Prime Power Form**:        Suppose ( q ) is not in the form of ( p^{alpha} ) where ( p ) is a prime number and ( alpha ) is a positive integer. Then, ( q ) can be factored into the product of smaller integers, say ( q = q_{1} q_{2} ) where ( 1 < q_{1} < q_{2} < q ) and ( gcd(q_{1}, q_{2}) = 1 ).    - If both ( q_{1} ) and ( q_{2} ) divide ( n ), then ( q ) would also divide ( n ) because ((q_{1}, q_{2}) = 1).    - Thus, ( q ) being the smallest integer not dividing ( n ), we must have ( q ) of the form ( p^{alpha} ). 5. **Selection of ( n ) for General ( q )**:        Suppose ( q = p^{alpha} ) for some prime ( p ) and ( alpha in mathbf{N}_{+} ).    - Let the primes less than ( p^{alpha} ) be ( p_{1}, p_{2}, ldots, p_{k} ).    - Choose ( alpha_{1}, alpha_{2}, ldots, alpha_{k} ) such that ( p_{i}^{alpha_{i}} > p^{alpha} ) for ( i = 1, 2, ldots, k ).    - Construct ( n ) as:      [      n = p_{1}^{alpha_{1}} p_{2}^{alpha_{2}} cdots p_{k}^{alpha_{k}} p^{alpha-1}      ]      Then, from the definition of ( f(n) ), it follows that ( f(n) = p^{alpha} ). 6. **Conclusion**:    Therefore, the range of ( f(n) ) is ( M ), which includes all positive integers of the form ( p^{alpha} ) where ( p ) is a prime and ( alpha ) is a positive integer.

This implies 2(a_{2}+a_{4})=q(a_{2}+a_{4}), where q is the common ratio. Thus, q=2, and the general term formula of the sequence is a_{n}=a_{1}q^{n-1}=2×2^{n-1}=2^{n}, i.e., a_{n}=2^{n}. (2) Given that the sequence {b_{n}} satisfies b_{1}+ frac {b_{2}}{2}+…+ frac {b_{n}}{n}=a_{n}(n∈N^{}), we have b_{1}+ frac {b_{2}}{2}+…+ frac {b_{n}}{n}+ frac {b_{n+1}}{n+1}=a_{n+1}. By subtracting these two equations, we obtain frac {b_{n+1}}{n+1}=a_{n+1}-a_{n}=2^{n+1}-2^{n}=2^{n}. Thus, b_{n+1}=(n+1)⋅2^{n}, i.e., b_{n}=n⋅2^{n-1}, for ngeqslant 2.

For a constant function, since there is no change in the function value (it's always the same no matter what the input is), the rate of change is zero.

Consider a pentagon ( A_1A_2A_3A_4A_5 ) inscribed in the circle, labeled in counterclockwise order. 2. **Consider the angles at the center:**    Each angle ( angle A_iOA_{i+1} ) is the central angle subtended by the side ( A_iA_{i+1} ). Since the pentagon is inscribed in the circle, each vertex lies on the circumference. 3. **Reflex angles consideration:**    If any of the angles ( angle A_iOA_{i+1} ) is reflex (i.e., greater than ( pi )), we can adjust the vertices to make the angle ( leq pi ) without decreasing the area. Therefore, we assume all angles ( angle A_iOA_{i+1} leq pi ). 4. **Area calculation using trigonometry:**    The area of the pentagon can be expressed as the sum of the areas of the five triangles ( triangle OA_iA_{i+1} ).

By Jensen's inequality for a concave function, the sum ( sum_{i=1}^{5} sin(angle A_iOA_{i+1}) ) is maximized when all the angles ( angle A_iOA_{i+1} ) are equal. 6. **Equal angles in a regular pentagon:**    If all the central angles ( angle A_iOA_{i+1} ) are equal, then each angle must be ( frac{2pi}{5} ). This configuration corresponds to a regular pentagon, where all sides and angles are equal. 7. **Conclusion:**    Since the area is maximized when all central angles are equal, the largest pentagon that can be inscribed in a circle of radius ( 1 ) is a regular pentagon.

If the length of the wood is denoted as x feet, the equation can be written as () A: frac{1}{2}(x+4.5)=x1 B: frac{1}{2}(x+4.5)=x+1 C: frac{1}{2}(x+1)=x4.5 D: frac{1}{2}(x1)=x+4.5","output":"To solve the problem, let's denote the length of the wood as x feet.

When the rope is folded in half and used to measure again, there is 1 foot of wood left, indicating that half of the rope's length is 1 foot shorter than the wood. Let's translate this information into an equation. The first scenario gives us the rope's length as x + 4.5 feet. When the rope is folded in half, its length becomes frac{1}{2}(x + 4.5).

For example, for the number 7, Damir wrote 0; for the number 105, he wrote (4); for the number 61, he wrote 5. What is the sum of all the numbers on the board?","output":"1. **Understanding the Problem Statement:**    For each natural number between 1 and 999, Damir subtracts the last digit from the first digit and records all the resulting 1000 differences on the board. For example, for the number 7, Damir writes down 0; for 105, he writes down -4; and for 61, he writes down 5. We need to find out what the sum of all recorded numbers on the board is. 2. **Single-digit Numbers Analysis:**    For single-digit numbers (i.e., 1 to 9), the first and last digit are the same. Therefore, the difference is always zero:    text{Difference} = text{Digit} - text{Digit} = 0    Thus, these do not contribute to the sum. 3. **Multi-digit Numbers Analysis:**    For numbers with more than one digit, we need to consider different cases.    **Case 1: Numbers where the first and last digit are the same:**       - These numbers will also result in a difference of zero, so they don't contribute to the sum.    **Case 2: Numbers that form pairs:**       - For numbers where the first digit (a) and the last digit (b) do not coincide, we can pair them with their reverse. For example, the pair (17, 71) produces the differences (1-7 = -6) and (7-1 = 6). These terms cancel each other out, contributing zero to the sum.       - Therefore, for any such pair ((a...b)) and ((b...a)), their contributions to the sum are zero because:        (a - b) + (b - a) = 0     4. **Numbers with No Pair:**    - The numbers that do not have pairs are those ending in 0. For example, (a0, a10, a20, ldots, a90). These numbers contribute their differences directly to the sum calculation:      - A number (a0) (where (a=1, 2, ldots, 9)) will contribute (a) directly.      - Numbers like (a10, a20,...a90) where the first digit (a) appears 10 times contribute (10a).      - Each (a) contributes (11a) in total:                  a + 10a = 11a          5. **Summing Up All Contributions:**    - Each digit (a = 1) to (9) contributes (11a) to the sum.    - Summing these contributions for each (a):        sum_{a=1}^{9} 11a = 11(1 + 2 + 3 + 4 + 5 + 6 + 7 + 8 + 9)        - Using the formula for the sum of the first (n) natural numbers: ( frac{n(n+1)}{2} ):        1 + 2 + 3 + cdots + 9 = frac{9 cdot 10}{2} = 45        - So, the total sum is:        11 cdot 45 = 495     **Conclusion:** The sum of all numbers recorded on the board is:  boxed{495}"},{"instruction":"Which of the following functions satisfies frac{f(x_{1})f(x_{2})}{x_{1}x_{2}} > 0 for any x_{1}, x_{2} in (0, +infty)?

Let's denote the angles of triangle ABC as 3alpha, 3beta, and 3gamma such that:     3alpha + 3beta + 3gamma = 180^circ Rightarrow alpha + beta + gamma = 60^circ  2. Let T be the intersection point of the lines AY and BX. 3. Since AZ and BZ are the angle bisectors of angle A and angle B respectively in triangle ATB, the line TZ is also an angle bisector of angle ATB. Therefore, we have:  angle ATZ = angle ZTB = frac{angle ATB}{2} = frac{180^circ - 2alpha - 2beta}{2} = frac{60^circ + 2gamma}{2} = 30^circ + gamma  4. Construct an equilateral triangle with one vertex at Z and the other two vertices on lines AT and BT. To do this, we draw two lines through point Z at an angle of 30^circ to ZT.    - Let U and V be the intersection points of these lines with segments AT and BT respectively. 5. Triangles TZU and TZV are congruent (they have equal angles and the common side TZ). This implies:  ZU = ZV  6. Consequently, triangle ZUV is isosceles with the angle at the vertex Z being 60^circ, making triangle ZUV equilateral. 7. Now to show that triangle ZUV coincides with triangle ZYX:    - Reflect point Z symmetrically with respect to lines AT and BT to get points P and Q respectively. 8.

Since angle PUV = angle UVQ and PU = ZU = ZV = QV, quadrilateral PUVQ is an isosceles trapezoid.  11. Letting a circle be inscribed in this trapezoid, it touches at all points indicating:  angle UZV = angle UPV = gamma, quad angle UVP = angle VUP = frac{180^circ - angle PUV}{2} = gamma  12. Therefore, angle PZQ = 180^circ - 3gamma.

From the law of sines:        a = d sin 3alpha, quad b = d sin 3beta, quad c = d sin 3gamma     2. For triangle BXC, applying the law of sines:        v = frac{a}{sin (180^circ - beta - gamma)} sin gamma = frac{d sin 3alpha}{sin (120^circ + alpha)} sin gamma = frac{d sin 3alpha}{sin (60^circ - alpha)} sin gamma     3.

Possible values for ( b ) (the last digit of (B)) are 1, 5, 7, 9. 3. **Formula for (A)**:    - If the last digit of (B) is ( b ), then (A) can be expressed as:       [      A = 10^8 cdot b + leftlfloor frac{B}{10} rightrfloor      ]      Here, ( leftlfloor frac{B}{10} rightrfloor ) represents (B) without its last digit. 4. **Finding the Largest (A)**:    - For (A) to be as large as possible, ( b ) should be the largest possible odd digit which is not a multiple of 3, i.e., ( b = 9 ).    - The largest 9-digit number ending in 9 is 999,999,999 but it is divisible by 3, so we decrement one digit that makes it still a nine-digit number and satisfies all conditions:      [      B = 999,999,989      ]    - Calculating for (A):      [      A_{text{max}} = 9 cdot 10^8 + leftlfloor frac{999,999,989}{10} rightrfloor       A_{text{max}} = 9 cdot 10^8 + 99,999,998       A_{text{max}} = 999,999,998      ] 5. **Finding the Smallest (A)**:    - For (A) to be as small as possible, ( b  ) should be the smallest possible odd digit which is not a multiple of 3, i.e., ( b = 1 ).    - The smallest 9-digit number greater than 666,666,666 ending in 1 is:      [      B = 666,666,671      ]    - Calculating for (A):      [      A_{text{min}} = 1 cdot 10^8 + leftlfloor frac{666,666,671}{10} rightrfloor       A_{text{min}} = 1 cdot 10^8 + 66,666,667       A_{text{min}} = 166,666,667      ] # Conclusion: The largest and smallest possible values of (A) are: [ boxed{A_{text{max}} = 999,999,998}, quad boxed{A_{text{min}} = 166,666,667} ]"},{"instruction":"A car company produced 3884 cars in North America, 2871 cars in Europe, 5273 cars in Asia, and 1945 cars in South America.

The smallest even multiple of 25 greater than 295 is 300 (since 300 is divisible by both 25 and 2). The largest even multiple of 25 less than 615 is 600 (since 600 is divisible by both 25 and 2). Now, we can find all the even multiples of 25 between 300 and 600 by adding 50 (which is 2 * 25) to each subsequent multiple starting from 300: 300, 350, 400, 450, 500, 550, 600 To find the sum of these numbers, we can use the formula for the sum of an arithmetic series: Sum = (n/2) * (first term + last term) where n is the number of terms. First, let's find the number of terms (n): n = (last term - first term) / common difference + 1 n = (600 - 300) / 50 + 1 n = 300 / 50 + 1 n = 6 + 1 n = 7 Now we can find the sum (k): k = (n/2) * (first term + last term) k = (7/2) * (300 + 600) k = (7/2) * 900 k = 7 * 450 k = 3150 Now we need to find the greatest prime factor of k (3150).

Consider a triangle ABC with bisectors AA_1 and BB_1. We need to show that the distance from any point ( M ) on the segment ( A_1B_1 ) to the line ( AB ) is equal to the sum of the distances from ( M ) to the lines ( AC ) and ( BC ). 2. Recall that a point on the angle bisector is equidistant from the sides of the angle it bisects. Therefore, let ( a ) be the distance from point ( A_1 ) to the lines ( AC ) and ( AB ). Similarly, let ( b ) be the distance from point ( B_1 ) to the lines ( AB ) and ( BC ). 3. Suppose point ( M ) divides ( A_1B_1 ) into two segments, such that ( A_1M : B_1M = p : q ), where ( p + q = 1 ). 4. Consequently, the distance from point ( M ) to the line ( AC ) is ( q cdot a ) because it inherits the weight ( q ) from segment ( A_1M ), and similarly, the distance from point ( M ) to the line ( BC ) is ( p cdot b ). 5. According to step 4, the task translates to proving that the distance from ( M ) to the line ( AB ) is the sum of these two distances, i.e., ( q cdot a ) and ( p cdot b ). 6. Referring to Problem 1.1, part (b), we recall that the distance from point ( M ) to a line is linearly distributed when the distances are weighted. Specifically, if ( p ) and ( q ) are the proportional segments on the bisector, then the distance from ( M ) to ( AB ) must indeed be the weighted sum of the distances from ( M ) to ( AC ) and ( BC ).

We define an operation where any arbitrary arithmetic sequence of 7 integers is added to the corresponding entries of any row or column. Is it possible, after a finite number of such operations, to obtain a table where each of the 7 rows consists of an arithmetic sequence?","output":"First, assume we can achieve the goal by using a finite number of operations as described. 1. Consider the 6 times 6 submatrix (a_{ij})_{1 leq i,j leq 6} of the given 7 times 7 matrix a_{ij} = (i^2 + j)(i + j^2). 2. By definition, the operations don't change the sum of the elements in the 6 times 6 submatrix modulo 6. Let us calculate the initial sum of all elements in the submatrix:        sum_{i=1}^{6} sum_{j=1}^{6} (i^2 + j)(i + j^2)     3. Expanding, we have:        sum_{i=1}^{6} sum_{j=1}^{6} (i^3 + ij^2 + j i^2 + j^3)     4. Summing over j first, we get:        sum_{i=1}^{6} left( sum_{j=1}^{6} i^3 + sum_{j=1}^{6} ij^2 + sum_{j=1}^{6} ji^2 + sum_{j=1}^{6} j^3 right)     5. Breaking this down further, we see:        sum_{i=1}^{6} left( 6i^3 + i sum_{j=1}^{6} j^2 + i^2 sum_{j=1}^{6} j + sum_{j=1}^{6} j^3 right)     6. Calculating each sum individually with n=6:        sum_{j=1}^{6} j = frac{6(6+1)}{2} = 21                sum_{j=1}^{6} j^2 = frac{6(6+1)(2 cdot 6 + 1)}{6} = 91            sum_{j=1}^{6} j^3 = left( frac{6 cdot 7}{2} right)^2 = 441     7. So we can rewrite our equation:        sum_{i=1}^{6} left( 6i^3 + i cdot 91 + i^2 cdot 21 + 441 right)     8. Summing over i:        6 sum_{i=1}^{6} i^3 + 91 sum_{i=1}^{6} i + 21 sum_{i=1}^{6} i^2 + 6 cdot 441     9. With n=6, the sums are:        sum_{i=1}^{6} i = 21                sum_{i=1}^{6} i^2 = 91            sum_{i=1}^{6} i^3 = 441     10. Putting these together modulo 6:          6 cdot 441 + 91 cdot 21 + 21 cdot 91 + 6 cdot 441 equiv 0 pmod{6}      11. Now, assume the transformed 7 times 7 matrix (b_{ij})_{1 leq i,j leq 7} has the form b_{ij} = c_{i} + (j-1)d_{i}, where c_i and d_i (for i=1,ldots,7) are integers. Consider its 6 times 6 submatrix:          sum_{i=1}^{6} sum_{j=1}^{6} b_{ij} = sum_{i=1}^{6} sum_{j=1}^{6} (c_{i} + (j-1)d_{i}) = sum_{i=1}^{6} 6c_{i} + sum_{i=1}^{6} d_{i} sum_{j=1}^{6} (j-1)           12. Calculating the inner sum sum_{j=1}^{6} (j-1):          sum_{j=1}^{6} (j-1) = 0 + 1 + 2 + 3 + 4 + 5 = 15      13. Thus, we have:          sum_{i=1}^{6} sum_{j=1}^{6} b_{ij} equiv sum_{i=1}^{6} 6c_{i} + 15 sum_{i=1}^{6} d_{i} equiv 3 sum_{i=1}^{6} d_{i} pmod{6}      14. This indicates that sum_{i=1}^{6} sum_{j=1}^{6} b_{ij} is congruent to either 0 or 3 modulo 6, but not 4 modulo 6. 15. Since the sum sum_{i=1}^{6} sum_{j=1}^{6} (i^2 + j)(i + j^2) was found to be 4 modulo 6, we conclude that it is impossible to rearrange the matrix such that each row forms an arithmetic progression. # Conclusion:  boxed{text{No}}"},{"instruction":"Find all functions ( f: mathbf{R} rightarrow mathbf{R} ) satisfying ( f(x) + f(y) neq 0 ) and [  frac{f(x)  f(xy)}{f(x) + f(x+y)} + frac{f(x)  f(x+y)}{f(x) + f(xy)} = 0  ] for all ( x, y in mathbf{R} ).","output":"Given the functional equation: [ frac{f(x)-f(x-y)}{f(x)+f(x+y)} + frac{f(x)-f(x+y)}{f(x)+f(x-y)} = 0 ] for all (x, y in mathbb{R}), we aim to find all functions (f: mathbb{R} rightarrow mathbb{R}) that satisfy this equation along with (f(x) + f(y) neq 0). 1. **Simplify the functional equation:**     Start by multiplying both sides of the given equation by ((f(x) + f(x+y))(f(x) + f(x-y))):     [     (f(x) - f(x-y))(f(x) + f(x-y)) + (f(x) - f(x+y))(f(x) + f(x+y)) = 0.     ]     This simplifies to:     [     (f(x)^2 - f(x-y)^2) + (f(x)^2 - f(x+y)^2) = 0.     ]          Combine like terms:     [     2 f(x)^2 - f(x-y)^2 - f(x+y)^2 = 0.     ] 2. **Introduce a new function:**     Define ( g(x) = f(x)^2 ).

When both pipes are open, the net rate at which the tank is filled is the rate of the first pipe minus the rate of the second pipe.

Observe that the difference between any two even numbers is even, and the difference between any two odd numbers is also even. The difference between an even and an odd number is odd.

This reasoning involves the avoidance of complete monochromatic subgraphs in the Ramsey Theory. 4. **Previous Considerations:**    - There exists a coloring method for the complete graph on 5 vertices, ( K_5 ), such that there is no monochromatic triangle.    - If fewer than 33 edges are colored, according to ( K_9 ), it’s theoretically possible (by the minimal nature) to arrange the edges and avoid a monochromatic triangle. 5. **Verification via Elimination Method:**    - Consider the process of progressively removing vertices while keeping track of edges:      - Start with ( K_9 ) and ensure at least one endpoint of each uncolored edge is removed.      - If, after removing vertices and their incident edges, fewer than 6 vertices remain, the argument falls that ( R(3, 3) = 6 ) ensures a monochromatic triangle within 6 remaining vertices if all pairs are necessarily colored. 6. **Conclusion:**    - By exclusion of fewer than 4 uncolored edges, at least 33 edges must be colored.    - Hence, the minimum number ( n ) that guarantees a monochromatic triangle is: [ boxed{33} ]"},{"instruction":"alculate the time it will take for a train that is 240 meter long to pass a bridge of 130 meter length , if the speed of the train is 50 km / hour ?","output":"To calculate the time it will take for the train to pass the bridge, we need to first determine the total distance the train needs to cover.

According to the given information, we have the following: - 50% failed in English. - 25% failed in both Hindi and English. - 50% passed in both subjects. Since 50% passed in both subjects, it means that 100% - 50% = 50% failed in at least one of the subjects. Now, we can use the principle of inclusion-exclusion to find the percentage of students who failed in Hindi. The principle of inclusion-exclusion states that for any two sets (in this case, the sets of students failing in Hindi and English), the size of the union of the sets is equal to the sum of the sizes of the individual sets minus the size of their intersection. In terms of percentages, this can be written as: Total percentage of failures in at least one subject = Percentage who failed in Hindi + Percentage who failed in English - Percentage who failed in both We know that the total percentage of failures in at least one subject is 50%, the percentage who failed in English is 50%, and the percentage who failed in both is 25%. We need to find H%, the percentage who failed in Hindi. So we have: 50% = H% + 50% - 25% Now, we solve for H%: 50% = H% + 25% H% = 50% - 25% H% = 25% Therefore, the percentage of students who failed in Hindi is boxed{25%} ."},{"instruction":"Three pairwise nonintersecting circles (omega_{x}, omega_{y}, omega_{z}) with radii (r_{x}, r_{y}, r_{z}) respectively lie on one side of the line (t) and touch it at points (X, Y, Z) respectively.

Kozhevnikov)","output":"1. **Initial Setup and Assumptions:**     - We are given three pairwise non-intersecting circles omega_{x}, omega_{y}, and omega_{z} with radii r_{x}, r_{y}, and r_{z} respectively.     - These circles are tangent to a common line t at points X, Y, and Z respectively, where Y is the midpoint of the segment XZ and r_{x} = r_{z} = r, and r_{y} > r.     - Define p as one of the internal common tangents to omega_{x} and omega_{y}, and q as one of the internal common tangents to omega_{y} and omega_{z}. 2. **Triangle Formation:**     - The tangents p, q, and t form a triangle ABC whose vertices are A, B, and C. 3. **Symmetry and Geometry:**     - Let q' be another internal common tangent to omega_{y} and omega_{z}, and t' the other external tangent common to these circles.     - Define A' and B' as the intersection points of t' with q and t respectively, and M and N as the intersection points of q' with t and t' respectively. 4. **Centers of Circles:**     - Denote the centers of the circles omega_{x}, omega_{y}, and omega_{z} by I_{x}, I_{y}, and I_{z} respectively. 5. **Symmetrical Properties:**     - Tangent p, upon reflection through the line joining the circle centers I_{y} and Y, maps to either q or q'. If p maps to q, then triangle ABC is isosceles, which contradicts the given condition. Hence, p and q' are symmetrical about I_{y}Y.     - Tangents q and q', as well as tangents t and t', are symmetrical about the line connecting the centers I_{y} and I_{z}.     - Thus, angle B'C'A' = angle NMB' = angle BAC and angle ACB = angle A'C'B' due to vertical angles. 6. **Triangles Similarity and Equality:**     - Therefore, triangles ABC and A'B'C' are similar by AA similarity criterion (angle-angle).     - Since omega_{y} is a common excircle tangent to corresponding sides of triangles AC and A'C', the similarity ratio is 1, making these triangles congruent.     - Thus, the incircles' radii in the triangles ABC and A'B'C' are equal. 7. **Conclusion:**     - The radius of the incircle of triangle ABC equals r, the radius of circles omega_{x} and omega_{z}. Hence, the radius of the inscribed circle in triangle ABC is [ r. ] (boxed{r})"},{"instruction":"Mike and John dined at the Taco Palace restaurant.

The sum of all elements in (mathbb{Z}_n) is:    [    sum_{k=0}^{n-1} k = frac{n(n-1)}{2}    ] 3. **Condition for Arrangeability:**    For ((mathbb{Z}_n, +)) to be arrangeable, there must exist an ordering of its elements such that:    [    {0, 1, 2, ldots, n-1} = {a_1 + a_2, a_2 + a_3, ldots, a_{n-1} + a_n, a_n + a_1} pmod{n}    ]    This implies that the sum of all elements in the set ({a_1 + a_2, a_2 + a_3, ldots, a_{n-1} + a_n, a_n + a_1}) must be congruent to the sum of all elements in ({0, 1, 2, ldots, n-1}) modulo ( n ). 4. **Sum of Pairwise Sums:**    The sum of the pairwise sums is:    [    (a_1 + a_2) + (a_2 + a_3) + cdots + (a_{n-1} + a_n) + (a_n + a_1)    ]    Each element (a_i) appears exactly twice in this sum, so:    [    2(a_1 + a_2 + cdots + a_n) = 2 sum_{k=0}^{n-1} k = 2 cdot frac{n(n-1)}{2} = n(n-1)    ]    Since (n(n-1)) is always divisible by (n), the sum of the pairwise sums modulo (n) is (0). 5. **Odd (n) Suffices:**    For (n) odd, we can take (a_k = k) for all (k). This means:    [    {0, 1, 2, ldots, n-1} = {1, 2, 3, ldots, n-1, 0}    ]    which is a cyclic permutation of the original set, thus satisfying the condition. 6. **Conclusion:**    Therefore, all positive integers (n) for which ((mathbb{Z}_n, +)) is arrangeable are the odd integers. # Part (b) 1. **Example of an Arrangeable Group of Even Order:**    Consider the group (D_4) (the dihedral group of order 8). The elements of (D_4) can be written as ({e, r, r^2, r^3, s, sr, sr^2, sr^3}), where (r) is a rotation and (s) is a reflection. 2. **Arrangeability of (D_4):**    We can arrange the elements of (D_4) as follows:    [    {e, r, r^2, r^3, s, sr, sr^2, sr^3}    ]    and consider the products:    [    {e cdot r, r cdot r^2, r^2 cdot r^3, r^3 cdot s, s cdot sr, sr cdot sr^2, sr^2 cdot sr^3, sr^3 cdot e}    ]    This set is a permutation of the original set, thus (D_4) is arrangeable. The final answer is ( boxed{ n } ) is odd for part (a) and (D_4) for part (b)."},{"instruction":"For how many n in {101, 102, 103, ..., 200} is the tens digit of n^2 even?

The centroid divides each median into two segments, one of which is twice the length of the other, specifically, the segment connecting the centroid to the midpoint of a side is one-third the length of the median, and the segment connecting the centroid to the vertex is two-thirds the length of the median. 2. **Analyze triangle areas involving the centroid**:    - The centroid divides triangle ABC into six smaller triangles of equal area. Therefore, the area of triangle AME is frac{1}{3} of the area of triangle ABC because it is composed of two of these six smaller triangles. 3. **Consider the midpoint N of AE**:    - Since N is the midpoint of AE, triangle ANM and triangle NME are congruent (by Side-Angle-Side congruence, as angle ANM = angle NME and AN = NE). Therefore, the area of triangle NME is equal to the area of triangle ANM. 4. **Calculate the area of triangle NME**:    - Since triangle ANM and triangle NME are congruent and together form triangle AME, the area of triangle NME is half the area of triangle AME. Thus, [NME] = frac{1}{2} times frac{1}{3} [ABC] = frac{1}{6} [ABC]. 5. **Re-evaluate the calculation**:    - The area of triangle NME is frac{1}{6} of triangle AME, not triangle ABC. Since triangle AME is frac{1}{3} of triangle ABC, the area of triangle NME is frac{1}{6} times frac{1}{3} = frac{1}{18} of triangle ABC. This contradicts the initial solution's conclusion. 6. **Correct the calculation**:    - Revisiting the relationships and calculations, we realize that triangle NME is indeed frac{1}{6} of triangle AME, but since triangle AME is frac{1}{3} of triangle ABC, the area of triangle NME is frac{1}{6} times frac{1}{3} = frac{1}{18} of triangle ABC. This discrepancy suggests an error in the initial solution's area distribution or a misunderstanding of the triangle relationships. 7. **Conclusion**:    - After re-evaluating, it appears there was a mistake in the initial solution's final area comparison. The correct proportion, based on the corrected analysis, should be recalculated, but given the options provided, none match frac{1}{18}. The closest provided option, based on the initial solution's method, would be boxed{textbf{(D)} frac{1}{12}}, assuming the error lies in the interpretation of the areas in the initial solution rather than the calculation itself."},{"instruction":"Chris has been saving his allowance to buy a new pair of soccer cleats and a ball.

Now, let's calculate the percentage increase in his savings after his birthday. The increase in his savings is the additional amount he received, which is 135. The original amount he had was 144. The formula for percentage increase is: Percentage Increase = (Increase / Original Amount) x 100 Plugging in the values we have: Percentage Increase = (135 / 144) x 100 Percentage Increase = 0.9375 x 100 Percentage Increase = 93.75% So, the percentage increase in Chris's savings after his birthday is boxed{93.75%} ."},{"instruction":"A quadrilateral inscribed in a circle with consecutive side lengths of 60, 90, 140, and 110 has a circle inscribed within it.

Let O be the center of the circle and EF be the diameter of the circle, lying along the line AD. 2. **Step-by-Step Analysis:**    - Since EF is the diameter of the circle and it lies on AD, we can label the trapezoid with vertices A, B, C, D. The circle touches AB and CD at points B and C respectively.    - Let's denote the points where the circle touches the sides AB and CD as B and C respectively. Since the circle is tangent to AB and CD, it implies that the perpendicular distance from O to AB and from O to CD is equal to the radius r of the circle. 3. **Using Similar Triangles:**    - Consider the right triangles formed by dropping perpendiculars from O to AB and CD. Let O be a point on AD implies O = (x, y).    - Since O lies on AD, we consider triangles triangle OAB and triangle OCD. Both triangles are right triangles with the perpendicular distances from O to AB and CD respectively equal to r. 4. **Median of the Trapezoid:**    - Trapezoid ABCD has its median equal to frac{AB + CD}{2}. Let M be the midpoint of AD.    - Since O lies on AD, and the circle is tangent to B and C, the distances OB and OC from O to AB and CD respectively are radii of the circle.     5. **Comparison with the Diameter:**    - To prove that the diameter of the circle is less than the median of the trapezoid, notice that the diameter EF = 2r.    - The median of the trapezoid can be expressed as frac{AB + CD}{2}, which takes into account the lengths of the parallel sides. 6. **Final Computation:**    - We need to prove that 2r < frac{AB + CD}{2}.    - Given the tangency points and the properties of the trapezoid, using triangle similarity and the fact that the perpendicular distances from O to AB and CD define radii of the circle, we can establish an inequality. 7. **Conclusion:**    - Since we have established the relationships between the radius, diameter, and the median of the trapezoid, it is evident that 2r, the diameter of the circle, is less than the median of the trapezoid which is frac{AB + CD}{2}.

From the geometric progression, we have: [ tan(alpha - beta)tan(alpha + beta) = tan^2 alpha ] This simplifies to: [ frac{tan alpha - tan beta}{1 + tan alpha tan beta} cdot frac{tan alpha + tan beta}{1 - tan alpha tanbeta} = tan^2 alpha ] Further simplification gives us: [ tan^2 alpha - tan^2 beta = tan^2 alpha(1-tan^2 alphatan^2beta) ] Solving this equation, we find that tan^2 beta(tan^4 alpha - 1) = 0, which implies tan alpha = 1 and thus alpha = frac{pi}{4}. Next, we let DC = a and BD = b. The trigonometric identities and the arithmetic progression give us: [ cot angle CBE = tan angle ABE = tan left( frac{pi}{4} + beta right) = frac{1+frac{a}{b}}{1-frac{a}{b}} = frac{b+a}{b-a} ] Given that 1, frac{b+a}{b-a}, and frac{b}{a} form an arithmetic progression, we find that frac{b}{a} = frac{b+3a}{b-a}. Setting b=ka and solving for k gives us: [ k^2 - 2k - 3=0 ] The positive solution for k is k=3. Therefore, b=frac{BE}{sqrt{2}} = 5 sqrt{2} and a = frac{5sqrt{2}}{3}. The area of triangle ABC is calculated as ab, which gives us: [ ab = 5sqrt{2} cdot frac{5sqrt{2}}{3} = boxed{frac{50}{3}} ]"},{"instruction":"A hunter and an invisible rabbit play a game in the Euclidean plane.

First, the invisible rabbit moves secretly and unobserved from its current point ( R_{n1} ) to some new point ( R_n ) with ( R_{n1} R_n = 1 ). 2. The hunter has a tracking device that returns an approximate position ( R_n' ) of the rabbit, so that ( R_n R_n' leq 1 ). 3.

Is there a strategy for the hunter that guarantees that after ( 10^9 ) such rounds the distance between the hunter and the rabbit is below 100?","output":"1. **Understanding the Problem**:     The hunter and the rabbit start at the same point. The rabbit can move 1 unit per round in any direction and is invisible to the hunter. The hunter receives an approximate position of the rabbit, which is within 1 unit of the rabbit's actual position. The hunter can also move 1 unit per round. We need to determine if there is a strategy for the hunter to ensure that the distance between the hunter and the rabbit is always less than 100 after (10^9) rounds. 2. **Assumptions**:    - Let (d_n) be the distance between the hunter and the rabbit after (n) rounds.    - The rabbit's moves can always keep it at most 1 unit away from the hunter's estimate (R_n'). 3. **Strategy Outline**:    - Since (d_n geq 100) would mean the rabbit has won, we must focus on ensuring (d_n < 100).    - The rabbit can choose its moves in such a way to increase (d_n). 4. **Key Idea**:    - The rabbit can always move in such a way that the distance between the rabbit and the hunter increases.    - Specifically, we'll show that the squared distance (d_n^2) can be increased by at least (frac{1}{2}) every 200 rounds. 5. **Geometric Visualization**:    - Suppose the rabbit and the hunter are at points (R_n) and (H_n) respectively.    - Let the line (r) be the line segment joining (H_n) and (R_n).    - Define points (Y_1) and (Y_2) which are 1 unit away from the line (r) and 200 units away from (R_n). 6. **Rabbit's Strategy**:    - The rabbit moves 200 hops towards (Y_1) or (Y_2).    - Because each hop is exactly 1 unit, the rabbit can maintain a constant distance from the line (r).    - If the radar readings always fall on (r), the hunter will not know if the rabbit is at (Y_1) or (Y_2). 7. **Analysis of Distance Increase**:    - Investigate the increase in (d_n^2) when the rabbit moves towards either (Y_1) or (Y_2).    - Compute the distance increase geometrically. 8. **Calculation**:    - Let (R') be 200 units to the right of (R_n).    - Define (varepsilon = ZR'), where (Z) is the midpoint of (Y_1Y_2).    - ( varepsilon approx 200 - sqrt{200^2 - 1} )    - ( varepsilon approx frac{1}{400} ) 9. **Increase in Quadratic Distance**:    - Since ( varepsilon geq frac{1}{400} ), we have:    [    y^2 geq d_n^2 + 2 varepsilon (200 - d_n)    ]    - Given (d_n < 100), (y^2 > d_n^2 + frac{1}{2} ). 10. **Conclusion**:    - After each 200 rounds, (d_n^2) can increase by at least (frac{1}{2}). 11. **Time Analysis**:    - The amount of rounds to exceed (100^2) can be computed as:    [    frac{100^2}{frac{1}{2}} cdot 200 = 4 cdot 10^6    ]    - Since (4 cdot 10^6 < 10^9), the rabbit can ensure (d_n geq 100) within (10^9) rounds. Therefore, the hunter cannot guarantee that the distance will stay below 100 after (10^9) rounds.

Since ( d(n)^3 = 4n ), it implies that ( 4n ) is a perfect cube. Let ( 4n = a^3 ) for some positive integer ( a ). Since ( 2 mid 4n = a^3 ), ( a ) must be even. Let ( a = 2k ) for some positive integer ( k ). Then, ( 4n = (2k)^3 = 8k^3 ), so ( n = 2k^3 ). 3. This implies that ( nu_2(n) ) (the exponent of 2 in the prime factorization of ( n )) is ( 1 ) modulo ( 3 ), and ( nu_p(n) ) is ( 0 ) modulo ( 3 ) for all primes ( p neq 2 ). 4.

However, if ( p neq 5 ), then ( nu_5left(frac{(nu_p(n)+1)^3}{p^{nu_p(n)}}right) geq 0 ), thus we need ( 5 in P ). 11. **Claim 3:** If ( k geq 2 ), then ( frac{(3k+1)^3}{5^{3k}} < frac{64}{125} ).     - **Proof:** It suffices to show that for all ( k geq 2 ), ( 5^{3k} > frac{125}{64}(3k+1)^3 ). For ( k = 2 ), we have ( 125^2 > frac{125}{64} cdot 7^3 ), since ( 125^2 cdot frac{64}{125} = 20^3 > 7^3 ). Now, assume that for some ( k geq 2 ), ( 5^{3k} > frac{125}{64}(3k+1)^3 ). Then,       [       5^{3(k+1)} = 125 cdot 5^{3k} > 125 cdot left(frac{125}{64}(3k+1)^3right) = frac{125}{64}(15k+5)^3 > frac{125}{64}(3k+4)^3 = frac{125}{64}(3(k+1)+1)^3       ]     - Thus, the inductive step is complete and so the claim is true.

If ( ell = 1 ), then we have ( P = {2, 5} ), since if ( P neq {2, 5} ), then we have by Claim 1 that     [     4 = prod_{p in P} frac{(nu_p(n)+1)^3}{p^{nu_p(n)}} = frac{(nu_2(n)+1)^3}{2^{nu_2(n)}} cdot frac{(nu_5(n)+1)^3}{5^{nu_5(n)}} cdot prod_{p in P setminus {2, 5}} frac{(nu_p(n)+1)^3}{p^{nu_p(n)}} < frac{(nu_2(n)+1)^3}{2^{nu_2(n)}} cdot frac{(nu_5(n)+1)^3}{5^{nu_5(n)}} = frac{(4+1)^3}{2^4} cdot frac{(3+1)^3}{5^3} = 4     ]     a contradiction.

Since BC is the polar of R with respect to omega_A, it moves projectively as R moves projectively (pole-polar transformation). 3. **Condition for Circumcenter and Centroid Coincidence**:    We wish to find all positions of R such that the circumcenter O of triangle ABC is also the centroid G of triangle PQR. Let T be the midpoint of PQ (which means that T is fixed). By homothety at T with ratio frac{1}{3}, we see that, as R varies, G moves on a fixed circle mathcal{C}. 4. **Projective Maps and Midpoints**:    Let M and N be midpoints of AB and AC respectively.

Thus, AI_A is the axis of mathcal{H}. The center of mathcal{H} is the midpoint of the two corresponding positions of O when R coincides with the arc midpoints of widehat{PQ}. 7. **Intersections of Hyperbola and Circle**:    We need to discuss the possible intersections of mathcal{H} with mathcal{C}. Note that G must lie inside triangle PQR, and if omega_A is the A-excircle of triangle ABC, then P and Q must lie on rays AB and AC, with R lying on minor arc widehat{PQ}. This means that when G equiv O, O lies outside triangle ABC. Thus, angle PAQ must be obtuse for the given condition to take place (this is a necessary condition, not sufficient). 8. **Movement of R and O**:    As R moves on minor arc widehat{PQ}, point O moves on one of the arms of mathcal{H} whose vertex is closer (in directed sense) to A than I_A. Since T lies between points A and I_A, mathcal{C} is cut by PQ into two parts with the minor segment towards A. Thus, mathcal{C} meets mathcal{H} in at most two points, which give our corresponding triangles. These two triangles will be symmetric with respect to line AI_A as this line is an axis for both mathcal{H} and mathcal{C}.

What are the conditions for the existence of such a triangle XYZ and how many possible solutions are there?

Denote these lines as follows:       - Through X': a_x, b_x, c_x        - Through Y': a_y, b_y, c_y       - Through Z': a_z, b_z, c_z     - Here, a_x is parallel to the side BC, b_x to CA, and c_x to AB, and similarly for a_y, b_y, c_y, a_z, b_z, c_z. 3. **Determining Valid Triangles:**     - To form a triangle XYZ that corresponds to X'Y'Z' with sides parallel to X'Y'Z', the sets of parallel lines must respect the permutation of indices: (x, y, z) take all permutations (a_x, b_y, c_z), (a_x, b_z, c_y), and so on.     - Hence, there are total (3! = 6) combinations or triangles formed by selecting one line each from the sets passing through X', Y' and Z' respectively. 4. **Analyzing Parallelism and Non-Intersection:**     - Out of 9 parallel lines in total, we can determine the positional relationship regarding the triangle X'Y'Z'. Some lines will intersect X'Y'Z', and some will not.     - Every point X', Y', and Z' will have one central line (among the sets of 3) that intersects the triangle X'Y'Z', while the remaining two lines will not intersect. 5. **Counting Valid Triangles:**     - We consider 6 non-intersecting lines distributed consistently into groups resulting in three primary patterns:       - (2, 2, 2): Each vertex contributes two non-intersecting lines.       - (1, 2, 3): One vertex contributes one non-intersecting line, one with two, and one with three.       - (0, 3, 3): One vertex has no non-intersecting lines, while the others have three each.     - For these arrangements, the number of triangles covering the interior of X'Y'Z' can be determined as either 2, 1, or 0 respectively. 6. **Transformation and Conclusion:**     - If the valid configurations of the triangles A_{1}'B_{1}'C_{1}' and A_{2}'B_{2}'C_{2}' (in the case of 2 solutions) are known, we can map them using similarity transformations to the original triangle ABC.     - Thus, the problem fundamentally has 2, 1, or 0 solutions depending upon the specific parallel and non-intersecting line configurations. If the triangle vertices' extensions are considered, there are generally 6 solutions. # Conclusion: The number of solutions to the problem is either 2, 1, or 0 if the triangle vertices are strictly on the sides.

For how many ( N ) between 1 and 2019 (inclusive) does the first player have a winning strategy?","output":"To solve the problem, we'll establish a criterion for when the first player has a winning strategy based on the number of tokens N, specifically whether N is a multiple of 3. 1. **Base Cases:**     - For N = 0, the first player loses since there are no tokens to remove. Hence, no moves can be made.     2. **General Case - Multiples of 3:**     - If N is a multiple of 3, we need to show that the first player does not have a winning strategy. Here’s why:         - Suppose N = 3k for some integer k.         - The available moves are to remove 2^n tokens for some nonnegative integer n. The values of 2^n are 1, 2, 4, 8, 16, etc.         - Removing 2^n tokens from 3k results in 3k - 2^n.         - None of the powers of 2 (2^n where n geq 0) is a multiple of 3.         - Therefore, 3k - 2^n cannot be a multiple of 3 after any valid move.         - This means after the first player's move, the number of remaining tokens is not divisible by 3, leaving an opportunity for the second player to always force the game back to multiples of 3, thus ensuring a win for the second player. 3. **General Case - Not Multiples of 3:**     - If N is not a multiple of 3, we need to show the first player has a winning strategy:         - Suppose N = 3k + 1 or N = 3k + 2 for some integer k.         - The first player can:             - If N = 3k + 1, the first player can remove 1 token, leaving 3k, a multiple of 3.             - If N = 3k + 2, the first player can remove 2 tokens, leaving 3k, again a multiple of 3.         - In either case, the first player can force the game into a state where the number of tokens left is a multiple of 3.         - As established above, if the remaining tokens are a multiple of 3, the second player is guaranteed to lose if both players play optimally. 4. **Counting the Winning Strategy Cases:**     - We need to count how many numbers between 1 and 2019 are not multiples of 3.     - Multiples of 3 between 1 and 2019:         - The sequence of multiples of 3 within this range are 3, 6, 9, ldots, 2019.         - This sequence is an arithmetic progression with the first term a = 3, common difference d = 3, and the last term l = 2019.         - The number of terms, n, is given by:           [           3n = 2019 Rightarrow n = frac{2019}{3} = 673           ]         - So, there are 673 multiples of 3 between 1 and 2019.          - The total number of integers from 1 to 2019 is:       [       2019       ]     - The number of integers that are not multiples of 3 would then be:       [       2019 - 673 = 1346       ] Thus, the number of N between 1 and 2019 for which the first player has a winning strategy is boxed{1346}."},{"instruction":"how many seconds will a train 180 meters long pass an oak tree , if the speed of the train is 54 km / hr ?","output":"First, we need to convert the speed of the train from kilometers per hour (km/hr) to meters per second (m/s) because the length of the train is given in meters.

Assume ( x ) has ( n ) digits in its decimal representation. 2. **Sequence Elements**:    Consider the sequence elements ( x + 10^n cdot d ) and ( x + 10^{n+1} cdot d ). Let’s denote these elements by ( b_1 ) and ( b_2 ) respectively.     Therefore,    [    b_1 = x + 10^n cdot d    ]    [    b_2 = x + 10^{n+1} cdot d    ] 3. **Decimal Representation of ( b_1 )**:    To understand the decimal representation of ( b_1 ), write ( d ) followed by ( n ) zeroes and then add ( x ). Since ( x ) has ( n ) digits, adding it to the last ( n ) zeroes of ( 10^n cdot d ) is equivalent to:    [    b_1 = d cdot 10^n + x    ]    When written out, ( b_1 ) appears as the digits of ( d ) followed by ( x ).  4. **Decimal Representation of ( b_2 )**:    Similarly for ( b_2 ):    [    b_2 = x + 10^{n+1} cdot d    ]    Here, ( b_2 ) is generated by appending ( x ) after the digits of ( d cdot 10^{n+1} ) and inserting an additional zero between ( d cdot 10^n ) and ( x ):    [    b_2 = d cdot 10^{n+1} + x    ] 5. **Digits Sum**:    Considering the above representations:    - For ( b_1 ): The sum of the digits is the digits of ( d ) plus the digits of ( x ).    - For ( b_2 ): The sum of the digits is the digits of ( d ), an additional zero, plus the digits of ( x ).    Clearly, the zero between ( d ) and ( x ) in ( b_2 ) does not affect the sum of the digits since adding zero does not change the total sum. Hence, the sums of the digits of ( b_1 ) and ( b_2 ) are equal. 6. **Conclusion**:    There exist ( b_1 ) and ( b_2 ) within any infinite arithmetic sequence of natural numbers, such that the sums of their digits are equal.

How many dogs are in the shelter?","output":"Let's denote the number of dogs as D and the number of cats as C. According to the problem, the ratio of dogs to cats is some number to 7, so we can write it as D/C = x/7, where x is the number of parts that correspond to dogs. We are also told that if 8 additional cats were taken in, the ratio of the number of dogs to the number of cats would be 15 to 11. This can be written as D/(C + 8) = 15/11. Now we have two equations: 1) D/C = x/7 2) D/(C + 8) = 15/11 From equation 1, we can express D as D = (x/7)C. Substituting D from equation 1 into equation 2, we get: (x/7)C / (C + 8) = 15/11 Cross-multiplying to clear the fractions, we get: 11(x/7)C = 15(C + 8) Expanding both sides, we get: 11xC = 105C + 120 Now, we can divide both sides by C to get: 11x = 105 + 120/C Since x must be an integer (because it represents the number of parts corresponding to dogs), and since 120 is not a multiple of 7, C must be a multiple of 7 for 120/C to be an integer. The smallest multiple of 7 that, when added to 105, gives a product that is a multiple of 11 is 7 itself (since 105 + 17 is not a multiple of 11, but 105 + 120/7 = 105 + 17 = 122, which is a multiple of 11).

Since we have found that C = 7, we can find the number of dogs (D) by multiplying the number of parts corresponding to dogs (x) by the number of cats (C): D = x * C D = 11 * 7 D = 77 Therefore, there are boxed{77}  dogs in the shelter."},{"instruction":"A train sets off at 2:00 pm at the speed of 70 km/h.

Let ( q ) denote the side length of the square we wish to inscribe such that it touches the two legs of the triangle. 2. **Initial Observations:**    Consider any square that fits within the right triangle. If the square does not touch any side of the triangle, it means we can always find a larger square by moving it until one of the sides touches the triangle. 3. **Square Touching Sides:**    If the square touches exactly one side of the triangle, it is possible to move the square inward such that it touches two sides of the triangle, contradicting the assumption that it was the largest possible square. Hence, a square touching only one side cannot be maximal. 4. **Square Touching Two Sides:**    If the square touches two sides of the triangle, consider the direction perpendicular to the included side. By shifting the square in this direction, it either touches three sides (thus becoming maximal) or it remains non-maximal, allowing for the possibility of further enlargement by shifting it inwards. 5. **Maximizing the Square with Three Sides Touching:**    Suppose the square touches three sides of the right triangle—let’s specifically consider it touching the two legs and hypotenuse indirectly. If possible, shift perpendicular to the plane of contact with the third side (hypotenuse). If such movement enlarges the square, it wasn't maximal to begin with. Lastly, if all four vertices of the square lie on the sides of the right triangle, specifically the leg sides, all possible configurations imply the largest possible inscribed square. 6. **Detailed Geometry of the Square:**    When the vertices of the square align to touch both (a) and (b) with minimal clearance to the hypotenuse, the side length (q) relates to the triangle's legs through:    [    q^2 = left(frac{1}{frac{1}{a^2} + frac{1}{b^2} + frac{1}{a^2 + b^2}}right)    ]    However, considering just the fundamental relation of (q) within the geometry:    [    q times a = q (a/b) times b    implies q = ab / (a + b)    ] 7. **Square Inside Entire Triangle:**    The maximal square we consider puts one vertex at the right-angle vertex of the triangle. This aligns the square optimally to utilize the triangles’ maximum surface. Hence:    [    q = frac{ab}{a + b}    ] 8. **Concluding the Formula:**    The above relation confirms any square utilizing (q) must sit tangentially across vertices to equate a right-angle vertex alignment. # Conclusion: [ boxed{ frac{ab}{a + b} } ] Ensures the most significant area for square fitting in a right triangle labeling such that ( q ) touching appropriately sides confirms maximal potential area.

This is important for understanding the relationship between cos (-80^{circ}) and cos (80^{circ}), and how we can relate them to k. **Method 1**:  Since cos (-80^{circ}) = k, this implies that cos (80^{circ}) = k as well due to the even property of the cosine function. We want to find sin (80^{circ}). Using the Pythagorean identity, sin^2 (theta) + cos^2 (theta) = 1, we can solve for sin (80^{circ}) as follows: sin (80^{circ}) = sqrt{1 - cos^2(80^{circ})} = sqrt{1 - k^2}.  We can then use this to find tan (100^{circ}) by realizing that tan (100^{circ}) = -tan (80^{circ}) since tangent is negative in the second quadrant (where 100^{circ} is located): tan (100^{circ}) = -tan (80^{circ}) = -frac{sin (80^{circ})}{cos (80^{circ})} = -frac{sqrt{1 - k^2}}{k}.  Hence, the answer is boxed{-frac{sqrt{1-k^2}}{k}}. **Method 2**:  Alternatively, we can directly compute tan (100^{circ}) using angle subtraction identities. Since 100^{circ} = 180^{circ} - 80^{circ}, we apply the identity for tan (theta - varphi): tan (100^{circ}) = frac{sin (180^{circ} - 80^{circ})}{cos (180^{circ} - 80^{circ})} = frac{sin (80^{circ})}{-cos (80^{circ})} = frac{sqrt{1-k^2}}{-k}.

Specifically, by placing dominoes horizontally in strategic positions, the first player ensures there will always be one cell left unreachable. 8. **Conclusion of Strategy**: By following this pattern, the first player can always ensure that the second player cannot fully cover the (2020 times 2020) board, thus guaranteeing a win for the first player.

The teacher's selected cells form a Master Sudoku if his student can determine them with the given information. How many Master Sudokus are there? *Proposed by T. Amdeberkhan, M. Ruby and F. Petrov*","output":"To solve the problem, we need to determine the number of Master Sudokus for a given ( n ). Let's break down the solution step by step. 1. **Understanding the Problem:**    - We have an ( n times n ) grid.    - The playing field consists of the cells on or below the main diagonal, which totals ( frac{n(n+1)}{2} ) cells.    - The teacher selects ( n ) cells such that:      - There is exactly one selected cell in each column.      - The number of selected cells in each row is given. 2. **Defining the Function ( f(n) ):**    - Let ( f(n) ) be the number of Master Sudokus for a given ( n ). 3. **Base Case:**    - For ( n = 1 ), there is only one cell, and it must be selected. Thus, ( f(1) = 1 ). 4. **Recursive Step:**    - Consider the cell selected in the ( n )-th column. Let it be in the ( k )-th row.    - If we remove the ( n )-th column and the ( k )-th row, we are left with an ((n-1) times (n-1)) grid.    - The problem reduces to finding the number of Master Sudokus for this ((n-1) times (n-1)) grid.    - The key insight is that the number of Master Sudokus for the ((n-1) times (n-1)) grid depends on the number of ways to select the cells in the remaining columns and rows. 5. **Recursive Formula:**    - The number of ways to select the cells in the remaining columns and rows is given by the sum of the number of ways to select the cells in the smaller grids.    - Therefore, we have:      [      f(n) = f(n-1) + f(n-2) + cdots + f(1) + 1      ]    - The ( +1 ) accounts for the case where the selected cell in the ( n )-th column is in the ( n )-th row. 6. **Inductive Proof:**    - We need to prove that ( f(n) = 2^{n-1} ) by induction.    - **Base Case:** For ( n = 1 ), ( f(1) = 1 = 2^{1-1} ).    - **Inductive Step:** Assume ( f(k) = 2^{k-1} ) for all ( k < n ).      [      f(n) = f(n-1) + f(n-2) + cdots + f(1) + 1      ]      Using the inductive hypothesis:      [      f(n) = 2^{n-2} + 2^{n-3} + cdots + 2^0 + 1      ]      This is a geometric series with the sum:      [      f(n) = 2^{n-1} - 1 + 1 = 2^{n-1}      ]    - Thus, by induction, ( f(n) = 2^{n-1} ).

The age of A is twice that of B, so ( A = 2B ). 3. The sum of their ages 3 years hence (in the future) is 66.

Given that D(x_{0}, 0) is the foot of the perpendicular from P to the x-axis, and M is the midpoint of segment PD, we can establish the following relationships: - Since M is the midpoint, we have x = x_0 and y = frac{y_0}{2}. - Given that P lies on the circle O: x^{2}+y^{2}=4, we substitute x_0 and y_0 to get x_0^2 + y_0^2 = 4.

To find the ratio of the money earned on the weekend to the money earned on a weekday, we divide the weekend earnings by the weekday earnings: 1,200 (weekend day) / 600 (weekday) = 2 So, the ratio of the money earned on the weekend to the money earned on a weekday is boxed{2:1} ."},{"instruction":"f two sides of a right triangle are 8 units and 15 units, what is the least possible length, in units, of the third side?

The derivative of the cubic function is f'(x) = 3ax^2 + 2bx + c (with a neq 0). For f(x) = ax^3 + bx^2 + cx + d to have an extremum, the discriminant of the quadratic derivative must be greater than 0. This requires 4b^2 - 4 cdot 3ac > 0, which simplifies to b^2 - 3ac > 0. Therefore, proposition ② is true. 3. For the function f(x) = mx^3 + (m-1)x^2 + 48(m-2)x + n to be an odd function, we must have m-1 = 0 and n = 0.

Simplifying the expression: [ a_{n+1}^2 = (k^2 a_n^2 + (k^2 - 1)a_n^2) + 2k a_n sqrt{(k^2 - 1)a_n^2 + 1} + 1, ] [ a_{n+1}^2 = (2k^2 - 1)a_n^2 + 2k a_n sqrt{(k^2 - 1)a_n^2 + 1} + 1. ] 5. Notice that the left-hand side of our recursion relation is a perfect square: [ a_{n+1}^2 - 2k a_n a_{n+1} + a_n^2 = 1. ] 6. Substituting (a_{n+1}^2) from our calculation: [ (2k^2 - 1)a_n^2 + 2k a_n sqrt{(k^2 - 1)a_n^2 + 1} + 1 - 2k a_n (k a_n + sqrt{(k^2 - 1)a_n^2 + 1}) + a_n^2 = 1, ] [ (2k^2 - 1)a_n^2 + 2k a_n sqrt{(k^2 - 1)a_n^2 + 1} + 1 - 2k^2 a_n^2 - 2k a_n sqrt{(k^2 - 1)a_n^2 + 1} + a_n^2 = 1. ] 7. Simplifying further: [ (2k^2 - 1)a_n^2 - 2k^2 a_n^2 + a_n^2 = 1, ] [ 2k^2 a_n^2 - 2k^2 a_n^2 = 1, ] [ 1 = 1. ] 8. Now, we have verified our recurrence relation holds true. We can further verify this by recalculating:     [ a_{n+2}^2 - 2k a_{n+1}a_{n+2} + a_{n+1}^2 - 1 = 0, ] which subtracts as follows: [ a_{n+2}^2 - a_n^2 - 2k a_{n+1}a_{n+2} + 2k a_n a_{n+1} = 0, ] simplifying this yields: [ (a_{n+2} - a_n)(a_{n+2} + a_n - 2k a_{n+1}) = 0. ] 9. Since the sequence ({a_n}) is strictly increasing, we conclude (a_{n+2} = 2k a_{n+1} - a_n): [ a_{n+2} = 2k a_{n+1} - a_n. ] 10.

To account for the wire thickness, we need to calculate the additional length added by the wire thickness for each loop and then multiply it by the number of loops (10). The additional perimeter added by the wire thickness for one loop is: Additional perimeter (P_add) = 2 * (5 mm + 5 mm) = 2 * 10 mm = 20 mm Since there are 1000 mm in a meter, we convert the additional perimeter to meters: P_add (in meters) = 20 mm / 1000 = 0.02 m Now, we multiply the additional perimeter per loop by the number of loops (10): Total additional length (L_add_total) = 10 * P_add L_add_total = 10 * 0.02 m L_add_total = 0.2 m Finally, we add the total additional length to the original total length to get the final length of the wire required: Final length of wire (L_final) = L_total + L_add_total L_final = 9440 m + 0.2 m L_final = 9440.2 m Therefore, the length of the wire required to go 10 times around the rectangular field, considering a wire thickness of 5 mm, is boxed{9440.2}  meters."},{"instruction":"At a social dance, each man danced with exactly four women, and each woman danced with exactly three men.

(1) If alpha is perpendicular to beta, by definition, plane alpha contains lines that are perpendicular to plane beta. Since these lines are perpendicular to beta, any line in plane alpha that does not intersect plane beta would be parallel to beta. Hence, alpha must have a line within it that is parallel to beta, which makes statement (1) true. (2) If plane alpha is not perpendicular to plane beta, this does not prevent the existence of a line within alpha that could be perpendicular to beta. It simply means that the plane alpha itself, as a whole, is not perpendicular to beta. The statement (2) is false because even if alpha is not perpendicular to beta, it might contain a line that is perpendicular to beta. Therefore, there can be lines within alpha that are perpendicular to beta.

Since l is a line and not a normal (a line perpendicular to a plane), it doesn't guarantee that the angles formed with planes alpha and beta are complementary. The angles could be complementary, but it's not a must. Therefore, statement (4) is false.

When the inlet pipe is open, it lets water in at a rate of 16 litres per minute, which is 16 * 60 = 960 litres per hour. With the inlet pipe open, the outlet pipe takes 10 + 8 = 18 hours to empty the tank. During this time, the inlet pipe is adding water to the tank at its rate of 960 litres per hour. So, in 18 hours, the inlet pipe adds a total of 18 * 960 litres of water to the tank. The effective rate at which the tank is being emptied when both pipes are open is the rate of the outlet pipe minus the rate of the inlet pipe. Since it takes 18 hours to empty the tank with both pipes in operation, the effective emptying rate is C/18 litres per hour. Now we can set up the equation: Outlet rate - Inlet rate = Effective rate (C/10) - 960 = C/18 To solve for C, we need to find a common denominator for the fractions, which is 90.

Show that it is possible to bijectively associate the wells to the houses such that connecting each well to its house with a straight line results in no intersecting paths.","output":"1. **Initial Setup**:    We have 2n points in the plane such that no three points are collinear. These points are divided into two sets:    - M = {M_1, M_2, ldots, M_n}, representing n houses.    - P = {P_1, P_2, ldots, P_n}, representing n wells.      2. **Optimal Route Assumption**:    We will consider a configuration of routes that minimizes the total length of all the straight-line connections between houses and wells. This means that the overall sum of the lengths of all the routes is minimal. 3. **Proof by Contradiction**:    Assume, for contradiction, that two routes intersect each other. Let the routes be M_i P_j and M_k P_l and let C be the point of intersection of these two routes. 4. **Modification of Routes**:    We can adjust these routes to create a new configuration by swapping the connections:    - Instead of M_i P_j and M_k P_l, consider the new routes M_i P_l and M_k P_j.       The configuration adjustment should look like the following:    [    begin{aligned}    &text{Original routes: } M_i - C - P_j quad text{and} quad M_k - C - P_l     &text{New routes: } M_i rightarrow P_l quad text{and} quad M_k rightarrow P_j    end{aligned}    ] 5. **Application of Triangle Inequality**:    - For points M_i, C, and P_l:      [      M_i P_l < M_i C + C P_l      ]    - Similarly, for points M_k, C, and P_j:      [      M_k P_j < M_k C + C P_j      ] 6. **Summation of Inequalities**:    By adding the two inequalities:    [    M_i P_l + M_k P_j < (M_i C + C P_l) + (M_k C + C P_j)    ]    Thus:    [    M_i P_l + M_k P_j < M_i P_j + M_k P_l    ] 7. **Contradiction**:    The above inequality shows that the total length of the new routes M_i P_l + M_k P_j is strictly less than the original routes M_i P_j + M_k P_l. This contradicts our initial assumption that the original configuration had the minimal total route length. 8. **Conclusion**:     Therefore, the assumption that the routes can intersect must be false. Hence, it is possible to connect the houses and wells in such a way that no two routes intersect. Hence, our conclusion is that there exists a bijective association between the houses and wells such that no two routes intersect. blacksquare"},{"instruction":"Let the function f(x) = |x + frac{8}{m}| + |x  2m| where m > 0.

Using standard angle bisector notations, we have: [  operatorname{tg} varepsilon_2 = frac{DD'}{ED'} = frac{CD sin gamma}{CE - CD cos gamma}  ] 2. **Expressing in Terms of Sides**:    Using the angle bisector theorem where D divides BC in the ratio frac{a}{b+c}, we substitute: [  frac{DD'}{ED'} = frac{frac{ab}{b+c} sin gamma}{frac{ab}{a+c} - frac{ab}{b+c} cos gamma}  ] 3. **Simplifying the Expression**: [ operatorname{tg} varepsilon_2 = frac{frac{ab sin gamma}{b+c}}{frac{ab}{a+c} - frac{ab cos gamma}{b+c}} = frac{a sin gamma + c sin gamma}{c (1 - cos gamma) + (b - a cos gamma)} ] Given the standard trigonometric identities, this simplifies to: [  operatorname{tg} varepsilon_2 = frac{c (sin alpha + sin gamma)}{c (1 - cos gamma + cos alpha)} ] 4. **Calculating (operatorname{tg} varepsilon_1)**:    For angle FEA = varepsilon_1, we have a similar relationship: [  operatorname{tg} varepsilon_1 = frac{sin alpha + sin gamma}{1 - cos alpha + cos gamma} ] 5. **Combination of Tangents**:     [ operatorname{tg} angle DEF = -operatorname{tg}(varepsilon_1 + varepsilon_2) = frac{sin alpha + sin gamma}{cos beta + frac{1}{2}} ] Additionally, from other triangle properties we derive: [  operatorname{tg} angle DEF = frac{sin alpha + sin beta}{cos gamma + frac{1}{2}} ] Setting these equal as required: [  frac{sin alpha + sin gamma}{cos beta + frac{1}{2}} = frac{sin alpha + sin beta}{cos gamma + frac{1}{2}} ] 6. **Manipulating the Identity**: If (frac{x}{y} = frac{z}{u}), then (frac{x - z}{y - u} = frac{x}{y}). Applying this we get: [  operatorname{tg} angle DEF = frac{sin gamma - sin beta}{cos beta - cos gamma} = cot left( frac{beta + gamma}{2} right) = operatorname{tg} left( frac{alpha}{2} right) ] 7. **Conditions on Angles**: Expressing in terms of known identities and symmetry: [ frac{sin beta + sin gamma}{cos alpha + frac{1}{2}} = -frac{sin alpha}{cos alpha} ] 8. **Simplifying the Inequality Relations**: Ultimately concluding with: [ sin beta + sin gamma + sin alpha = -frac{sin alpha}{2 cos alpha} ] Upon solving further: [  2sin alpha < sin alpha + sin beta + sin gamma < 2cos frac{alpha}{2} = frac{sin alpha}{sin frac{alpha}{2}} ] And hence, calculating bounds for sin frac{alpha}{2}: [  0 < z < sqrt{frac{5}{8}} approxeq 0.7905694 quad text{and} quad  4z(2z^2 - 1) < z < 2(z+1)(2z^2 - 1) ] Leading to: [  boxed{102^circ 39' 48.4'' < alpha < 104^circ 28' 39''} ] Conclusively, the angle angle BAC must lie between these bounds for DE = DF in the triangle ABC where AB neq AC."},{"instruction":"Find the matrix that corresponds to rotating about the origin by an angle of 150^circ counterclockwise.","output":"To solve this problem, use the rotation matrix formula: [ R(theta) = begin{pmatrix} cos theta & -sin theta  sin theta & cos theta end{pmatrix} ] For a 150^circ rotation, calculate cos 150^circ and sin 150^circ: [ cos 150^circ = cos (180^circ - 30^circ) = -cos 30^circ = -frac{sqrt{3}}{2} ] [ sin 150^circ = sin (180^circ - 30^circ) = sin 30^circ = frac{1}{2} ] Thus, the rotation matrix R(150^circ) is: [ R(150^circ) = begin{pmatrix} -frac{sqrt{3}}{2} & -frac{1}{2}  frac{1}{2} & -frac{sqrt{3}}{2} end{pmatrix} ] Conclusion: The matrix that rotates points around the origin by 150^circ counter-clockwise is  [ boxed{begin{pmatrix} -frac{sqrt{3}}{2} & -frac{1}{2}  frac{1}{2} & -frac{sqrt{3}}{2} end{pmatrix}}. ]"},{"instruction":"The base BC of triangle ABC is 1, and angle A equals alpha.

Here's the step-by-step solution: 1. **Fixing the Base**:     - Let's fix the base (BC) of triangle (ABC).     - The vertex (A) will then lie on the arc (BEC) constructed such that it spans angle (alpha) at vertex (A). 2. **Analyzing Different Cases Based on (alpha)**:      Case 1: (alpha < 90^{circ})     - The center (O) of the arc (BEC) will be located on the perpendicular bisector of the segment (BC) at point (D) (the midpoint of (BC)), positioned above the chord (BC).     - Let (A_1) and (A_2) be two points on the arc (CEC) such that (A_1) is closer to (C) than (A_2).     - Since (angle A_1 OD < angle A_2 OD), by the known theorem on triangles with the same sides but unequal angles, we have:       [       A_2 D > A_1 D > DC = frac{1}{2}       ]      Case 2: (alpha = 90^{circ})     - In this case, the points (O) and (D) coincide.     - Thus,        [       DA_1 = DA_2 = frac{1}{2}       ]      Case 3: (alpha > 90^{circ})     - Here, the center (O) of the arc (BEC) lies below the chord (BC).     - For points (A_1) and (A_2) on the arc (CEC), since (angle A_1 OD > angle A_2 OD), it follows:       [       A_2 D < A_1 D < DC = frac{1}{2}       ] 3. **Calculating the Maximum Possible Length**:     - When (A) coincides with the midpoint of the arc (BEC), triangle (ABC) becomes isosceles.     - The length of median (AD) can be calculated using:       [       AD = frac{1}{2} cot frac{alpha}{2}       ]       since (DC = frac{1}{2}) and the angle at (D) is (frac{alpha}{2}). 4. **Conclusion**:     - Based on the above cases, we conclude:            If (alpha < 90^{circ}):       [       frac{1}{2} < m_a leq frac{1}{2} cot frac{alpha}{2}       ]              If (alpha = 90^{circ}):       [       m_a = frac{1}{2}       ]              If (alpha > 90^{circ}):       [       frac{1}{2} cot frac{alpha}{2} leq m_a < frac{1}{2}       ] Hence, the possible values for the length of the median (AD) are boxed accordingly for each case. boxed{text{{If }} alpha < 90^{circ}: ; frac{1}{2} < m_a leq frac{1}{2} cot frac{alpha}{2}}  boxed{text{{If }} alpha = 90^{circ}: ; m_a = frac{1}{2}}  boxed{text{{If }} alpha > 90^{circ}: ; frac{1}{2} cot frac{alpha}{2} leq m_a < frac{1}{2}}"},{"instruction":"Show that ( n geq 2 ) is prime if and only if ( n ) divides ((n1)! + 1).

We need to show that n is prime.     - Assume n is not prime.     - This means n = ab where 1 < a leq b < n.     - Both a and b are factors of (n-1)! because (n-1)! is the product of all integers from 1 to n-1.     - Hence, a mid (n-1)! and b mid (n-1)!.     - Therefore ab mid (n-1)! implies n mid (n-1)! (since n = ab).     - But n mid (n-1)! + 1 gives a contradiction because n cannot simultaneously divide (n-1)! and (n-1)! + 1 since (n-1)! + 1 is always greater by 1.     - Hence, n must be a prime number.  Conclusion: n is prime if and only if n divides (n-1)! + 1. # Power of n: To determine for which n the expression (n-1)! + 1 is a power of n: 1.

Therefore, we have: [ 3a_{1} + 2a_{2} = 2 times frac{1}{2}a_{3} ] Substituting a_{2} = a_{1}q and a_{3} = a_{1}q^2 into the equation, we get: [ 3a_{1} + 2a_{1}q = a_{1}q^2 ] Since a_{1} > 0, we can divide the entire equation by a_{1} to simplify it: [ 3 + 2q = q^2 ] Rearranging the equation to set it to zero, we get: [ q^2 - 2q - 3 = 0 ] Factoring the quadratic equation, we find: [ (q - 3)(q + 1) = 0 ] Therefore, the solutions for q are: [ q = 3 quad text{or} quad q = -1 ] However, since q > 0, we discard q = -1.

Number the watchmen in order of decreasing rank: r_1, r_2, r_3, ldots 2. Each watchman r_i has sleep and duty periods of length r_i days which alternate. This means r_i watches for r_i days, then sleeps for r_i days, and this pattern repeats. 3. From the problem statement: [ r_{i+1} leq frac{r_i}{3} ] This implies that each rank is at least three times smaller than the previous one. 4. Consider the patterns of duty and sleep for each watchman. For instance: - Watchman r_1 (highest rank) has periods of r_1 days of duty and r_1 days of sleep. - Watchman r_2 (next rank) has periods of r_2 days of duty and r_2 days of sleep, but since r_2 leq frac{r_1}{3}, multiple (three or more) duty-sleep cycles of r_2 can fit into one cycle of r_1. 5. Therefore, the sleep period of any watchman r_i can be subdivided (entirely or nearly) into multiple (at least three) complete periods of sleep of watchman r_{i+1}. 6. Since the periods of sleep and duty for watchmen form decreasing nested intervals (due to the factor of 3), eventually, the smallest rank watchman r_n determines the base interval when everybody is either on duty or sleeping. 7. Observe the day's interval fitting into the sleeping schedule of smaller rank watchmen: - Assume r_n represents the smallest rank. - In particular, the r_n cycle contains a nested pattern where any point in time, following the period subdivisions downwards, at least one watchman will be sleeping. 8. Specifically, on any day falling into the smallest period of sleep, no overlapping duty periods exist, meaning no watchmen will be on duty. **Conclusion:** The team of watchmen organized in such a manner cannot ensure daily duty coverage since there will necessarily be days where all the watchmen are simultaneously in their sleep cycles due to how their duty-sleep periods recursively nest within each other.

For the odd-numbered stones: - There are 8 odd-numbered stones (1, 3, 5, 7, 9, 11, 13, 15). - We need to choose 5 out of these 8 stones. - The number of ways to choose 5 out of 8 stones is given by the binomial coefficient: binom{8}{5} = frac{8!}{5!(8-5)!} = frac{8!}{5!3!} - Calculate: binom{8}{5} = frac{8 times 7 times 6 times 5!}{5! times 3 times 2 times 1} = frac{8 times 7 times 6}{3 times 2 times 1} = 56 5. For the even-numbered stones: - There are 7 even-numbered stones (2, 4, 6, 8, 10, 12, 14). - We need to choose 5 out of these 7 stones. - The number of ways to choose 5 out of 7 stones is given by the binomial coefficient: binom{7}{5} = frac{7!}{5!(7-5)!} = frac{7!}{5!2!} - Calculate: binom{7}{5} = frac{7 times 6 times 5!}{5! times 2 times 1} = frac{7 times 6}{2 times 1} = 21 6. Adding the number of ways from each case, we get: binom{8}{5} + binom{7}{5} = 56 + 21 = 77 # Conclusion: The total number of ways to mark 5 stones so that there are an odd number of stones between any two marked stones is ( boxed{77} )."},{"instruction":"a 5 times 7 grid, the numbers 1, 2, and 3 are placed such that every 2 times 2 square contains all three distinct numbers.

First, we compute (a_0 mod 5): [ a_0 = 2016 equiv 1 pmod{5} ] 3. **Computing Subsequent Terms Modulo 5:** Next, we compute (a_1 mod 5): [ a_1 = a_0 + frac{2}{a_0} = 2016 + frac{2}{2016} ] Since (2016 equiv 1 pmod{5}), we have: [ a_1 equiv 1 + frac{2}{1} equiv 1 + 2 equiv 3 pmod{5} ] 4. **Continuing the Sequence:** Now, we compute (a_2 mod 5): [ a_2 = a_1 + frac{2}{a_1} = 3 + frac{2}{3} ] Since (3^{-1} equiv 2 pmod{5}) (because (3 cdot 2 equiv 1 pmod{5})), we have: [ a_2 equiv 3 + 2 cdot 2 equiv 3 + 4 equiv 7 equiv 2 pmod{5} ] 5. **Next Term in the Sequence:** We compute (a_3 mod 5): [ a_3 = a_2 + frac{2}{a_2} = 2 + frac{2}{2} ] Since (2^{-1} equiv 3 pmod{5}) (because (2 cdot 3 equiv 1 pmod{5})), we have: [ a_3 equiv 2 + 2 cdot 3 equiv 2 + 6 equiv 8 equiv 3 pmod{5} ] 6. **Observing the Pattern:** We continue this process and observe that the sequence alternates between 2 and 3 modulo 5: [ a_4 = a_3 + frac{2}{a_3} equiv 3 + 2 cdot 2 equiv 3 + 4 equiv 7 equiv 2 pmod{5} ] [ a_5 = a_4 + frac{2}{a_4} equiv 2 + 2 cdot 3 equiv 2 + 6 equiv 8 equiv 3 pmod{5} ] 7. **Conclusion on Quadratic Residues:** The sequence ((a_n mod 5)) is periodic with period 2, alternating between 2 and 3. Neither 2 nor 3 is a quadratic residue modulo 5. Therefore, (a_n mod 5) is never a square modulo 5. 8. **Final Conclusion:** Since a rational number squared must be a quadratic residue modulo any prime, and since (a_n mod 5) is never a quadratic residue, the sequence ((a_n)) does not contain a square of a rational number.

We are asked to find the maximum value of the function ( f(x) = sum_{i=1}^{n} sqrt[k]{p x_{i} + q} ). 2. We start by considering the function ( y = sqrt[k]{x} ) with ( k geqslant 2 ).

Given x in left(frac{7pi}{6omega}, 2piright], we can transform this interval as follows: [ omega x - frac{pi}{6} in left(omegaleft(frac{7pi}{6omega}right) - frac{pi}{6}, omega(2pi) - frac{pi}{6}right] = left(pi, 2piomega - frac{pi}{6}right] ] The cosine function, cos(omega x - frac{pi}{6}), has exactly 3 zeros within this transformed interval.

To show that M N remains parallel to a fixed plane as x varies and to determine the locus of the midpoint of M N, let's follow these steps: Consider a cube with edge length a. The faces of this cube include squares such as A B C D and A B E F. We focus on the diagonals A C and F B, and measure distances A M = F N = x from points A and F. Let: - MG be perpendicular to AD - NH be perpendicular to AF In this case, the triangles AGM and FHN are right-angled and isosceles with hypotenuse x. Since AG = GM and FH = HN irrespective of x, we have: MG = NH which means M N parallel GH . Since GH is constantly moving in the plane ADF, so too must M N. Therefore, M N is parallel to the plane ADF always. Now, since AB perp ADF (as ADF plane contains lines AD and AF which are perpendicular to AB), M N is also perpendicular to AB. Let the perpendicular plane passing through M N and parallel to AB intersect AB at T. Consequently: MT perp AB quad text{and} quad NT perp AB To find the locus of the midpoint O of M N: - The perpendicular projection of O on the ABCD plane (square) is MT midpoint and denoted as (O'). - The perpendicular projection of O on the ABEF plane is NT midpoint, denoted as (O''). The locus of O forms a geometry based on projections O' and O'', which follow the medians of triangles ABC and BAF.

To express M N^2 as a function of a and x, using the Pythagorean theorem: [ M N^2 = M T^2 + N T^2 = left( frac{AM}{sqrt{2}} right)^2 + left( frac{BN}{sqrt{2}} right)^2 ] Since AM = x and BN = a sqrt{2} - x, this becomes: [ M N^2 = left( frac{x}{sqrt{2}} right)^2 + left( frac{a sqrt{2} - x}{sqrt{2}} right)^2 ] Simplifying: [ = frac{x^2}{2} + frac{(a sqrt{2} - x)^2}{2} ] [ = frac{x^2}{2} + frac{2a^2 - 2ax sqrt{2} + x^2}{2} ] [ = x^2 - ax sqrt{2} + a^2 ] The function M N^2 in terms of a and x is: [ boxed{M N^2 = x^2 - ax sqrt{2} + a^2} ] This is a parabolic equation which, when plotted, shows that M N reaches its minimum when x = frac{a sqrt{2}}{2}. Here, M and N are midpoints of their respective squares, making M N minimal at: [ M N_{text{min}} = frac{a sqrt{2}}{2} ] 3. We need alpha and beta to be calculated when M N is minimal. When M N is minimal, x = frac{a sqrt{2}}{2}. In this configuration, the triangle AMN and BNM are equilateral. Thus: [ alpha = 60^circ quad text{and} quad beta = 60^circ ] Therefore: [ boxed{alpha = 60^circ text{ and } beta = 60^circ} ] 4. Let's express cos alpha and cos beta in terms of a and x.

Determine the monotonicity of h(x): - For x in (e^{-2}, a), h'(x) > 0, so h(x) is monotonically increasing. - For x in (a, +infty), h'(x) < 0, so h(x) is monotonically decreasing. 5. Check the sign of h(x) at specific points: - h(e^{-2}) = -e^{-2} - b < 0. - h(a) = aln a + a - b > 0. - For x > 1, h(x) < 3asqrt{x} - x.

This means b can be expressed as (2^u cdot 5^v). 2. **Relative Primes and Conditions**: If n is a suitable positive integer: - For all k < n, frac{n}{k} must be a finite decimal or an integer. - n-1 must be composed only of the factors 2 and 5 since frac{n}{n-1} must be a finite decimal, and n and n-1 are relatively prime.

The equation of the line AF_{2} can be written as frac{x}{c} + frac{y}{b} = 1, which simplifies to bx + cy - bc = 0. 2. The distance d from F_{1} to the line AF_{2} is given by d = frac{2bc}{sqrt{b^2 + c^2}} = sqrt{2}. - Simplifying, we get 2b^{2}c^{2} = b^{2} + c^{2}, which we denote as equation (1). 3. Given the eccentricity, we have e = frac{c}{a} = frac{sqrt{2}}{2}, implying a = sqrt{2}c, which we denote as equation (2). 4.

As a result, point ( P ) will map to a point ( D ) on the large circle such that the line ( BC ) coincides with the tangent to the large circle at point ( D ). Because the tangent at ( D ) is parallel to the tangent at ( P ), ( D ) must be the midpoint of the arc ( BC ) that does not contain ( A ). 3. Applying a similar reasoning to the other circle that touches ( S ): - ( S ) also maps to a corresponding point on the large circle. - The key insight here is the symmetry: both ( P ) and ( S ) map out tangents that place ( D ) precisely as the midpoint of the arc ( BC ). 4. Now, let's inspect ( angle D ): - Notice that triangles ( triangle BQD ) and ( triangle PBD ) share a common angle at ( D ). Further, since arcs ( BD ) and ( CD ) are congruent ((overarc{BD} = overarc{CD})), it follows that the angles at ( Q ) tracing those arcs are congruent, i.e., ( angle BQD = angle CQD = angle CBD ). - Thus, we establish that these triangles ( triangle BQD ) and ( triangle PBD ) are similar by AA similarity (( angle BQD = angle PBD ) and ( angle BDP ) is common). 5. With the above similarity established, consider the ratio: [ frac{DB}{DP} = frac{DQ}{DB} ] which implies: [ DB^2 = DP cdot DQ ] demonstrating a particular relation between these distances. 6. Repeat this reasoning for the other small circle, yielding an analogous relationship. 7. We now perform an inversion centered at ( D ) with radius ( DB ). Under this inversion: - Points ( P ) and ( Q ) interchange. - As ( DB ) represents the length of the tangent from ( D ) to both smaller circles, points of tangency remain fixed. 8. Therefore, the inversion fixes the point ( I ) (the common tangency point of the two smaller circles), enforcing ( DI = DB ). 9. Diagonally, ( DI ) needs to touch both smaller circles tangent-wise, pushing ( A ) onto ( DI ). Since ( D ) sits at the midpoint of arc ( BC ), ( DA ) bisects ( angle BAC ). 10. Analysing the angles: - ( angle ABI = angle BID - angle BAD ) - Given ( DB = DI ), ( angle BDI = angle DBI ) - Since ( angle BAD = angle CAD = angle CBD ), essentially transformation ( angle ABI = angle BID - angle BAD = angle IBD - angle CBD = angle IBC ). 11. Conclusively this verifies ( IB ) bisects ( angle ABC ). [ boxed{I text{ is the incenter of } triangle ABC.} ]"},{"instruction":"Which of the following pairs of shapes may not necessarily be similar?

Here, c < b < a and ac < 0 are satisfied. - Calculating, we find cb^2 = 0 and ab^2 = 0. - This leads to cb^2 = ab^2, not cb^2 < ab^2.

(1) Find the value of sin^2 frac{B+C}{2} + cos 2A; (2) If a = sqrt{3}, find the maximum area of triangle ABC.","output":"(1) First, we know that B+C = pi - A because the sum of the angles in a triangle is pi. So, we can rewrite the expression as sin^2 frac{pi - A}{2} + cos 2A. Now, using the half-angle identity for sine, we have sin^2 frac{pi - A}{2} = cos^2 frac{A}{2}. Applying the double-angle identity for cosine, we have cos 2A = 2cos^2 A - 1. Substituting these into the original expression, we get cos^2 frac{A}{2} + 2cos^2 A - 1. Next, we use the half-angle identity for cosine, cos frac{A}{2} = sqrt{frac{1 + cos A}{2}}, to simplify the first term. Substituting cos A = frac{1}{3}, we get cos^2 frac{A}{2} = frac{1+frac{1}{3}}{2} = frac{2}{3}. For the second term, we substitute cos A = frac{1}{3} directly, yielding 2cos^2 A = 2(frac{1}{3})^2 = frac{2}{9}. Combining these results, we get frac{2}{3} + frac{2}{9} - 1 = boxed{-frac{1}{9}}. (2) Given cos A = frac{1}{3}, we can find sin A using the Pythagorean identity: sin A = sqrt{1 - cos^2 A} = sqrt{1 - frac{1}{9}} = frac{2sqrt{2}}{3}. By the Law of Cosines, a^2 = b^2 + c^2 - 2bccos A. Substituting a = sqrt{3} and cos A = frac{1}{3}, we get sqrt{3} = b^2 + c^2 - frac{2}{3}bc. To maximize the area of the triangle, we need to maximize bc (since the area is given by frac{1}{2}bcsin A). This occurs when b = c, because b^2 + c^2 is constant and the geometric mean is always less than or equal to the arithmetic mean. In this case, we have b = c = frac{sqrt{3}}{sqrt{2}}. Therefore, the maximum area of triangle ABC is frac{1}{2}bcsin A = frac{1}{2}frac{sqrt{3}}{sqrt{2}}frac{sqrt{3}}{sqrt{2}}frac{2sqrt{2}}{3} = boxed{frac{3sqrt{2}}{4}}."},{"instruction":"an election, candidate Douglas won 64 percent of the total vote in counties X and Y.

Since there are 2V voters in county X, he won 0.76 * 2V = 1.52V votes in county X. To find out how many votes Douglas won in county Y, we subtract the votes he won in county X from his total votes: 1.92V (total votes) - 1.52V (votes in county X) = 0.40V (votes in county Y).

Determine all numbers N for which A can win independently of the moves of B . *(4th Middle European Mathematical Olympiad, Individual Competition, Problem 2)*","output":"1. **Initial Setup and Strategy for Perfect Squares:** - We need to show that if ( N = n^2 ), then player ( A ) can always win. - The divisors of ( N ) are ( 1, d_1, dots, d_k, n, g_1, dots, g_k, n^2 ), where ( g_i = frac{n^2}{d_i} ). - Each ( d_i ) is a divisor of ( n ), and thus ( d_i mid g_i ) for all ( i ). 2. **Partitioning the Divisors:** - After ( A ) erases ( N ) in the first move, we can partition the remaining numbers into ( k+1 ) pairs: ( (1, n), (d_1, g_1), dots, (d_k, g_k) ). - For every move of ( B ), ( A ) will erase the remaining number in the chosen pair. This ensures that ( A ) always has a move and will eventually win. 3. **Non-Square Numbers:** - We need to show that if ( N ) is not a perfect square, then ( B ) can always win. - Consider ( N = p_1^{alpha_1} p_2^{alpha_2} cdots p_k^{alpha_k} ), where ( k ) is the number of distinct prime factors. - If ( N ) is not a perfect square, the number of divisors of ( N ) is even. 4. **Induction on the Number of Prime Factors:** - Base Case: For ( k = 1 ), ( N = p_1^{alpha_1} ). If ( alpha_1 ) is odd, ( N ) is not a perfect square, and the number of divisors is even. - Inductive Step: Assume the statement is true for ( k-1 ) prime factors. Consider ( N = g cdot p_k^{alpha_k} ), where ( g ) has ( k-1 ) prime factors. - Partition the divisors of ( N ) into sets ( A_0, A_1, dots, A_{alpha_k} ), where ( A_i ) contains the divisors of ( g ) multiplied by ( p_k^i ). 5. **Strategy for ( B ):** - If ( B ) has a winning strategy for ( A_0 ), he can apply the same strategy to ( A_i ) for all ( i ). - Since the number of divisors of ( N ) is even, ( B ) can always force ( A ) into a position where ( A ) has no valid moves. Conclusion: - If ( N ) is a perfect square, ( A ) can always win. - If ( N ) is not a perfect square, ( B ) can always win.

Step-by-Step Analysis: - We aim to determine the fewest number of questions needed to guarantee finding at least two boxes containing white balls. - Let's consider the situation where we ask the following questions: (1,2), (1,3), ..., (1,2004), (2,3), (2,4), ..., (2,2004). Detailed Approach: 4. **If all answers are positive (indicating at least one white ball per query)**: This suggests that box 1 and box 2 both contain white balls. - If box 1 or box 2 contains a black ball, it would imply the presence of two black balls somewhere, forming a black pair. This would contradict our positive responses. 5. **If at least one answer is negative (indicating no white balls in the pair)**: - Suppose the answer to the question involving box 1 is negative (such as (1, k)). This indicates that box 1 contains a black ball. - In this case, any boxes from positive responses in pairs with box 1 would imply they contain white balls. Therefore, we can identify two boxes containing white balls. Consider the algorithm's efficiency: - Suppose a hypothetical algorithm claims to find two white balls in fewer questions. We will challenge this claim: - Answer positively to all such questions. - After at most 4004 questions, the player would point out a specific pair of boxes like (1, 2), assuming both have white balls. - Since such an algorithm assumes all possible pairs, fail the test by placing black balls in these specified boxes yet responding positively, creating a contradiction.

This simplifies to x^2 = a^2 - b, which has at most two solutions for x in R. This contradicts the requirement that the equality holds for all x in R. Therefore, f_1(x) = x is not a \\"Gamma-function\\". For f_2(x) = 3^x to be a \\"Gamma-function\\", there must exist a pair of real numbers (a, b) such that 3^{a+x} cdot 3^{a-x} = 3^{2a} = b. Therefore, the pair (a, 3^{2a}) satisfies the condition, and f_2(x) = 3^x is a \\"Gamma-function\\". (2) Given that f_3(x) = tan x is a \\"Gamma-function\\", there exists a pair of real numbers (a, b) such that tan (a+x) cdot tan (a-x) = b always holds. When a = kpi + frac{pi}{2}, k in Z, tan (a+x) cdot tan (a-x) = -cot^2 x, which is not a constant. Therefore, a neq kpi + frac{pi}{2}, k in Z. When x neq mpi + frac{pi}{2}, m in Z, we have frac{tan a + tan x}{1 - tan a cdot tan x} cdot frac{tan a - tan x}{1 + tan a cdot tan x} = frac{tan^2 a - tan^2 x}{1 + tan^2 a cdot tan^2 x} = b. This leads to (b tan^2 a - 1) tan^2 x + (tan^2 a - b) = 0. Solving this system of equations gives begin{cases} tan^2 a = 1 b = 1 end{cases}, which implies begin{cases} a = kpi pm frac{pi}{4}, k in Z b = 1 end{cases}. When x = mpi + frac{pi}{2}, m in Z and a = kpi pm frac{pi}{4}, k in Z, we have tan (a+x) cdot tan (a-x) = cot^2 a = 1. Therefore, the pairs of real numbers (a, b) that satisfy f_3(x) = tan x being a \\"Gamma-function\\" are (kpi pm frac{pi}{4}, 1), k in Z. (3) Since f(x) is a \\"Gamma-function\\" and there exist pairs of real numbers (0, 1) and (1, 4) that satisfy the condition, we have f(x) cdot f(-x) = 1 and f(1+x) cdot f(1-x) = 4. The latter equality can be rewritten as f(x) cdot f(2-x) = 4. When x in [1, 2], we have 2-x in [0, 1] and f(2-x) in [1, 2], which implies f(x) = frac{4}{f(2-x)} in [2, 4]. Hence, when x in [0, 2], we have f(x) in [1, 4]. Solving the system of equations begin{cases} f(x) cdot f(-x) = 1 f(1+x) cdot f(1-x) = 4 end{cases} yields begin{cases} f(-x) = frac{1}{f(x)} f(-x) = frac{4}{f(2+x)} end{cases}, which implies f(x+2) = 4f(x).

The formula for simple interest (SI) is: SI = P * R * T / 100 where R is the rate of interest per annum and T is the time in years. For compound interest (CI), the formula is: CI = P * (1 + R/100)^T - P Given that the rate of interest (R) is 10% per annum and the time (T) is 2 years, we can calculate the difference between compound interest and simple interest, which is given as Rs. 51.

A reporter from the Sports Newspaper wrote in his article that each participant in this tournament won as many games as they drew. Prove that the reporter was wrong.","output":"Step 1: Assume the point distribution system for each match. Let's consider the outcomes of matches: - A victory gives 2 points. - A draw gives 1 point. - A loss gives 0 points. Step 2: Analyze the given information. The problem states that each participant won as many games as they drew. Let: - ( W ) be the number of wins for each participant. - ( D ) be the number of draws for each participant. Given that ( W = D ) (wins equal draws), the total points ( P ) for each player can be expressed as: [ P = 2W + D ] But since ( W = D ): [ P = 2D + D = 3D ] Thus, the number of points each participant scored is a multiple of 3. Step 3: Calculate the total points in the tournament. In a round-robin tournament with 20 participants, every participant plays against every other participant exactly once. This results in: [ text{Total matches} = frac{20 times 19}{2} = 190 ] Each match results in a total of 2 points being awarded (either 2 points to one player if there is a win or 1 point to both players if there is a draw). Thus, the total points distributed among the participants is: [ text{Total points} = 2 times 190 = 380 ] Step 4: Analyze the total points in relation to the individual point requirement. For the journalist's statement to be correct, every individual participant’s points being a multiple of 3 means the total points for all participants combined must also be a multiple of 3. However, the calculated total points in the tournament are: [ 380 div 3 = 126 text{ R } 2 ] Since 380 is not divisible by 3, the total points are not a multiple of 3. This contradicts the condition that every participant's points are a multiple of 3. # Conclusion: Therefore, we can conclude that the correspondent made an error in their statement. (blacksquare) Step 1: Introduce the constant speed assumption. The key observation is to recognize that if the \\"remaining time\\" display on the computer remains constant, the average speed must be such that this condition holds true. When the display constantly shows 2 hours remaining, it means that the proportion between the distance covered and the remaining distance maintains a specific relationship based on the speed. Step 2: Establish the relationship between distance and speed. Let: - ( x(t) ) be the distance covered by Grisha at time ( t ). - ( v ) be the average speed. From the problem, we have: [ x(t) = v t ] And for the remaining distance: [ 100 - x(t) ] Since the display always shows 2 hours remaining: [ frac{100 - x(t)}{v} = 2 text{ hours} ] Step 3: Derive the equation for the distance covered. Rearrange the equation to find ( v ): [ v = frac{100 - x(t)}{2} ] Since ( x(t) = v t ): [ x(t) = left( frac{100 - x(t)}{2} right) t ] Solve for ( x(t) ): [ 2x(t) = t (100 - x(t)) ] [ 2x(t) = 100t - x(t)t ] [ 2x(t) + x(t)t = 100t ] [ x(t)(2 + t) = 100t ] [ x(t) = frac{100t}{2 + t} ] For ( t > 0 ). Step 4: Represent the function in an alternative form. To simplify, note that: [ x(t) = 100 - frac{200}{t + 2} ] Step 5: Interpret and plot the graph. The function ( x(t) = 100 - frac{200}{t + 2} ) represents a hyperbola shifted 2 units left and 100 units up. # Conclusion: The distance ( x(t) ) covered by Grisha at any time ( t ) is: [ x(t) = frac{100t}{t + 2} ] Thus, the graph of this function is part of a hyperbola.

In the expansion of (1+x)^n, the rth term is given by {C}_{n}^{r-1} x^{r-1}. Given that the 6th term has the largest binomial coefficient, we identify the binomial coefficient of this term as {C}_{n}^{5}, because the term's position is one more than the exponent in the binomial coefficient. 2. **Determining the Value of n**: For the 6th term's binomial coefficient to be the largest, and knowing that binomial coefficients increase to a maximum at the middle term(s) and then decrease symmetrically, we deduce that n=10. This is because, for any binomial expansion, the largest coefficient(s) appear in the middle.

Now, we need to check if pq + r, qr + p, and rp + q are pairwise relatively prime. 6. **Check if pq + r, qr + p, and rp + q are pairwise relatively prime:** - Since p, q, and r are distinct primes, pq + r, qr + p, and rp + q will be sums of products of distinct primes and another distinct prime. This ensures that the gcd of any two of these expressions will be 1, as they will not share any common prime factors.

Perform the following moves: 1. Slide the column containing ( c_1 ) and ( c_2 ) down by one space. 2. Slide the row now containing ( c_1 ) and ( c_3 ) to the right by one space. 3. Slide the column now containing ( c_2 ) and ( c_3 ) up by one space. 4.

Each vector has a magnitude of 1, and their directions are random.

According to the problem, when Claire divides her cupcakes into groups of 5, she has 3 remaining. This can be mathematically represented as: [N = 5x + 3] where x is an integer representing the number of groups. Similarly, when Claire divides her cupcakes into groups of 7, she has 4 remaining. This can be represented as: [N = 7y + 4] where y is an integer representing the number of groups. Given that both expressions equal N, we can set them equal to each other to find a relationship between x and y: [5x + 3 = 7y + 4] Simplifying this equation, we aim to find values of x and y that satisfy: [7y + 1 = 5x] We are also given that Claire has fewer than 60 cupcakes, which means N < 60.

By checking each value, we find that: - 15 = 5 times 3, which fits the form of 5x. - 50 = 5 times 10, which also fits the form of 5x.

Using all three digits, and making sure that each digit appears at least once: We can arrange the three different digits in 3! (3 factorial) ways, which is 3! = 3 times 2 times 1 = 6. 2. However, we need a four-digit number, so one digit must appear twice. We can choose which digit to repeat in 3 ways (digit 1, digit 2, or digit 3). 3. Let's denote the repeated digit by R and the other two unique digits by A and B. Because identical digits cannot be adjacent, the R digit has to be surrounded by A and B. We have two main cases for their arrangement: - Case 1 (A-R-R-B or B-R-R-A): This arrangement is not allowed as the repeated digit R is adjacent. - Case 2 (A-R-B-R or R-A-R-B or B-R-A-R or R-B-R-A): In this case, there are 4 arrangements for each of the choice for A, B, and R, where no two Rs are adjacent. 4. Since we have 3 ways to choose the repeated digit (R) and 3! ways to arrange A, B, and R initially, then multiplied by 4 arrangements from case 2: Total number of four-digit numbers = 3 times 3! times 4 = 3 times 6 times 4 = 72. However, we have to eliminate the cases where the repeated digits are adjacent (not allowed by the problem statement). There are only 2 such arrangements for each choice of R (R-R-A-B and B-A-R-R), which totals 3 times 2 = 6 arrangements. 5.

After the water evaporates, the cucumbers are 95% water and weigh 20 pounds. Since the cucumbers are now 95% water, the weight of the non-water part of the cucumbers is 5% of 20 pounds, which is 1 pound. Before the water evaporated, the weight of the non-water part was the same (since only water evaporates), so it was also 1 pound. This non-water part was (100 - P)% of the initial weight W. So we can write the equation: (100 - P)% of W = 1 pound Converting the percentage to a decimal, we get: (1 - P/100) * W = 1 Now we need to find the initial weight W of the cucumbers. Since the non-water part didn't change and was 1 pound both before and after the water evaporated, we can find the initial weight of the water in the cucumbers by subtracting this 1 pound from the total initial weight W: Initial weight of water = W - 1 pound After evaporation, the weight of the water is 95% of 20 pounds, which is 19 pounds. This means that the weight of the water decreased by W - 1 - 19 pounds. Since the only thing that changed was the water weight, we can set up the equation: W - 1 - 19 = W - 20 Now we can solve for W: W - 20 = 1 W = 21 pounds The initial weight of the cucumbers was 21 pounds.

Given that the chord AB has a length of 2sqrt{3}, we can use the formula for the distance from a point to a line to find the perpendicular distance d from the center C to the line l. The relationship between the chord length |AB|, the radius r, and the distance d is given by the Pythagorean theorem in the right triangle formed by the radius, half the chord, and the perpendicular distance from the center to the chord. Thus, we have: [ d = sqrt{r^2 - left(frac{|AB|}{2}right)^2} = sqrt{2^2 - left(sqrt{3}right)^2} = sqrt{4-3} = sqrt{1} = 1 ] Now, we consider two cases for the line l: ① **When the line l has an undefined slope and passes through (2,3)**, the only line that satisfies this condition is vertical, hence x=2. This line is 1 unit away from the center (1,1), which matches our calculated distance d=1. ② **When the line l has a defined slope and passes through (2,3)**, we let the equation of the line be y-3=k(x-2), or equivalently kx-y-2k+3=0. The distance d from the center (1,1) to this line is given by: [ d = frac{|k(1)-1-2k+3|}{sqrt{k^2+1}} = 1 ] Solving the equation for k gives k=frac{3}{4}. Thus, the equation of the line in this case is 3x-4y+6=0. Combining the results from both cases, we find that the equation of line l can be either x=2 or 3x-4y+6=0.

Since the point D(1,2) satisfies both equations, it confirms that the solution to the equation kx+b=mx+3 in terms of x is indeed x=1. Therefore, statement ① is correct. **Statement ②:** Given y_{2}=mx+3 and knowing it passes through D(1,2), we can deduce the nature of m. Since m affects the slope of the line, and it is given that m neq 0, we can infer that if m < 0, the function is decreasing, meaning as x increases, y decreases. For any two distinct points A(x_{a},y_{a}) and B(x_{b},y_{b}) on this graph, if x_{a} > x_{b}, then y_{a} < y_{b} due to the decreasing nature of the function. This implies (x_{a}-x_{b})(y_{a}-y_{b}) < 0. Therefore, statement ② is correct. **Statement ③:** Given |y_{1}-y_{2}|=b-3 and b > 3, we need to find the value of x that satisfies this condition. However, without specific functions for y_{1} and y_{2}, we cannot directly conclude that x=0 or x=2 solely based on the given condition. The standard solution indicates a misunderstanding or misinterpretation of how x is determined from the absolute difference of y_{1} and y_{2}. Therefore, statement ③ is deemed incorrect based on the provided solution. **Statement ④:** Given b < 3 and b neq 2, we analyze the condition for when x > 1. Since b is a constant term in y_{1}=kx+b, a smaller b compared to the constant term in y_{2}=mx+3 (which is 3) suggests that, for values of x > 1, the slope k (assuming k > m or k and m have different signs) will influence y_{1} to be greater than y_{2}. Therefore, statement ④ is correct based on the relationship between the slopes and intercepts of the two lines. **Conclusion:** Based on the analysis, the correct statements are ①, ②, and ④.

Using this conclusion to solve the following problem: Given a rectangle with a perimeter of 18cm, when the length of the rectangle is ______ cm, rotating it around one side forms a cylinder. The value of the volume of the cylinder when it is at its maximum is ______ cm^{3}.","output":"To solve this problem, we start by setting up the variables based on the given information. Let's denote the two sides of the rectangle as x and y. Given that the perimeter of the rectangle is 18cm, we can express this as 2(x+y)=18, which simplifies to x+y=9. We are also given that x > 0 and y > 0. Next, we consider the scenario where the rectangle is rotated around one side to form a cylinder. If we let the side with length x be the height of the cylinder, then the volume of the cylinder, V, can be expressed as V=pi xy^{2}. This is because the volume of a cylinder is given by the formula pi r^{2}h, where r is the radius of the base and h is the height. In our case, y acts as the diameter of the base, so frac{y}{2} is the radius, and x is the height. To maximize the volume, we can apply the inequality sqrt[3]{abc} leq frac{a+b+c}{3} for positive a, b, and c. By setting a=x, b=frac{y}{2}, and c=frac{y}{2}, we can rewrite the volume as V=4pi cdot x cdot frac{y}{2} cdot frac{y}{2}. Applying the inequality, we get: [ V = 4pi cdot x cdot frac{y}{2} cdot frac{y}{2} leqslant 4pi cdot left(frac{x+frac{y}{2}+frac{y}{2}}{3}right)^{3} = 4pi cdot left(frac{x+y}{3}right)^{3} ] Given that x+y=9, we substitute this into the inequality to find: [ V leqslant 4pi cdot left(frac{9}{3}right)^{3} = 4pi cdot 3^{3} = 108pi ] The equality holds if and only if x=frac{y}{2}, which is a condition for the maximum volume. Substituting x+y=9 into x=frac{y}{2}, we solve for y: [ x = frac{y}{2} Rightarrow 2x = y Rightarrow 3x = 9 Rightarrow x = 3 ] Thus, y = 2x = 6. Therefore, when the length of the rectangle is 6cm, rotating it around one side forms a cylinder with the maximum volume of 108pi , cm^{3}.

To find f(7), we use the definition of f(x): [ f(x) = frac{2x + 1}{x - 2} ] Substituting x = 7 into f(x), we get: [ f(7) = frac{2(7) + 1}{7 - 2} = frac{14 + 1}{5} = frac{15}{5} = 3 ] Therefore: [ g(2) = 3 ] 3.

This implies that each digit in a position (hundreds, tens, units) of one term will appear in the next position in the next term and eventually cycle back to its original position. 2. **Sum of the Sequence**: Let's denote the sum of all terms in the sequence as S. Each digit in the sequence contributes to the hundreds, tens, and units places equally. This is because the sequence cycles through the digits in such a way that each digit appears in each place exactly once per cycle. 3. **Expression for S**: Let k be the sum of the units digits of all terms in the sequence. Since each digit appears in the hundreds, tens, and units places equally, the sum of the tens digits and the sum of the hundreds digits are also k. Therefore, each term in the sequence contributes 100a + 10b + c where a, b, and c are the hundreds, tens, and units digits respectively. Summing over all terms, we get S = 111k because each digit contributes 111 times its value to the sum. 4. **Factorization of S**: Since S = 111k = 3 cdot 37k, it is evident that S is always divisible by 37 regardless of the value of k. 5. **Checking for Larger Primes**: To ensure that no larger prime factor always divides S, consider a specific sequence. For example, the sequence 123, 231, 312 results in S = 123 + 231 + 312 = 666 = 2 cdot 3^2 cdot 37. This shows that while 37 is a factor, no prime larger than 37 (such as 43) necessarily divides S. 6. **Conclusion**: Since S is always divisible by 37 and we have shown that no larger prime factor from the given options necessarily divides S, the largest prime factor that always divides S is boxed{37}."},{"instruction":"A collection of 10 cubes consists of one cube with edgelength k for each integer k, 1 le k le 10.

Specifically, we apply the following inequalities: [ ab leqslant frac{a^2 + b^2}{2} ] [ bc leqslant frac{b^2 + c^2}{2} ] [ ac leqslant frac{a^2 + c^2}{2} ] 3. **Step 3: Summing the inequalities** We now sum the three inequalities: [ ab + bc + ac leqslant frac{a^2 + b^2}{2} + frac{b^2 + c^2}{2} + frac{a^2 + c^2}{2} ] 4. **Step 4: Simplifying the summed inequalities** Combining the terms on the right-hand side, we get: [ frac{a^2 + b^2}{2} + frac{b^2 + c^2}{2} + frac{a^2 + c^2}{2} = frac{2a^2 + 2b^2 + 2c^2}{2} = a^2 + b^2 + c^2 ] Therefore, we have: [ ab + bc + ac leqslant a^2 + b^2 + c^2 ] This confirms our initial inequality: [ a^2 + b^2 + c^2 geqslant ab + bc + ca ] 5. **Step 5: Exploring the equality case** To determine when equality holds, we need each individual inequality to be an equality. From the inequalities: [ ab = frac{a^2 + b^2}{2} ] [ bc = frac{b^2 + c^2}{2} ] [ ac = frac{a^2 + c^2}{2} ] Equality holds if (ab = frac{a^2 + b^2}{2}), which implies (a = b).

Since AX is part of AB and CY is part of CD, and given that AX = CY, we can denote the length of AX and CY as 'k'. Therefore, AX = k and DY, which is the remainder of the side CD after subtracting CY, is CD - CY = 4032 - k.

For each ( k geq 1 ), either ( A_{k-1} subseteq A_k ) and ( |A_k - A_{k-1}| = 1 ) or ( A_{k-1} supseteq A_k ) and ( |A_{k-1} - A_k| = 1 ) Step-by-Step Proof: 1. **Base Case: ( n = 1 ):** - Consider ( S = {1} ). - The power set ( P ) of ( S ) is ( {emptyset, {1}} ). - Label ( A_1 = emptyset ) and ( A_2 = {1} ). - ( A_1 = emptyset ) - ( A_2 = {1} ) - Here, ( A_1 subseteq A_2 ) and ( |A_2 - A_1| = 1 ). 2. **Inductive Step: Suppose it is true for some ( n ):** - Let the set ( S ) have ( n ) elements. - Assume we can label the subsets ( A_1, A_2, ldots, A_{2^n} ) fulfilling the conditions. 3. **Extend to ( n+1 ) elements:** - Consider ( S' = S cup {n+1} ). - The power set ( P' ) of ( S' ) has ( 2^{n+1} ) subsets. 4. **Construction:** - Suppose ( S = {1, 2, ldots, n} ). - Let ( A_1, A_2, ldots, A_{2^n} ) be the subsets of ( S ) in an order satisfying the conditions. - Label ( A_{2^n+1}, A_{2^n+2}, ldots, A_{2^{n+1}} ) as follows: - For ( m = 1, 2, ldots, 2^n ): [ A_{2^n + m} = A_{2^n + 1 - m} cup {n+1} ] 5. **Verification:** - Initialize ( A_1, A_2, ldots, A_{2^n} ) correctly: - ( A_1 = emptyset ) - Each pair ( (A_{k-1}, A_k) ) satisfies either ( A_{k-1} subseteq A_k ) and ( |A_k - A_{k-1}| = 1 ) or ( A_{k-1} supseteq A_k ) and ( |A_{k-1} - A_k| = 1 ). - For the new sequence ( A_{2^n + 1}, ldots, A_{2^{n+1}} ): - ( A_{2^n + 1} = A_{2^n} cup {n+1} ) which transitions from the last subset in the original order. - Then continue using ( A_{2^n + m} ) ensures ( A_{2^n + m} supseteq A_{2^n + m-1} ) and ( |A_{2^n + m} - A_{2^n + m-1}| = 1 ). By extending this procedure, we can recursively build the sequences for any ( n ). # Conclusion: We have shown that we can label the elements of the power set ( P ) of a finite set ( S ) as required. The construction ensures that for each ( n geq 1 ), either ( A_{n-1} subseteq A_n ) with ( |A_n - A_{n-1}| = 1 ) or ( A_{n-1} supseteq A_n ) with ( |A_{n-1} - A_n| = 1 ). boxed{}"},{"instruction":"An increasing sequence (1, 3, 4, 9, 10, 12, 13, cdots) is formed by some positive integers, which are either powers of 3, or sums of different powers of 3.

Now, we can calculate the distance Pat covered while running. Distance running = Speed × Time Distance running = 8 miles/hour × 7/4 hours = 14 miles Finally, we can find the total length of the course by adding the distance covered while bicycling and the distance covered while running.
