As part of gaining trust, Selkirk becomes Jesse's skydiving partner. As they train for the heist, Selkirk secretly gathers information for his agency to take down the group. However, Jesse begins to suspect that there is a mole in their group, and decides to set a trap to flush them out. He intentionally rigs his own parachute with a subtle malfunction, planning to switch it with Selkirk's, falsify an accident report, and eliminate Selkirk from the operation. Selkirk, aware of the plan, decides to play along. On the day of their last jump before the heist, the team is in high spirits, unaware of the secret battle being played out between Selkirk and Jesse. Moments before the jump, Selkirk manages to swap the parachutes back, putting Jesse's life in real danger. While they are jumping, Selkirk's teammate, Diana, notices something is off about Jesse's parachute and, wanting to prove her loyalty, decides to switch chutes mid-air in a daring move. Unfortunately, she becomes injured in the process when her parachute fails to fully deploy. Now exposed and with time running out, Selkirk uses this incident to convince the group that Jesse was sabotaging the heist for his own gain.

Plant plankton, like all photosynthetic organisms, uses sunlight to convert carbon dioxide and water into glucose and oxygen through a process called photosynthesis. Here's a step-by-step breakdown of photosynthesis: 1. Plant plankton absorb sunlight (specifically, photons) through their pigments, such as chlorophyll. 2. This absorbed energy allows the plant plankton to convert water molecules into hydrogen and oxygen. 3. The hydrogen is then used to reduce carbon dioxide into glucose, which serves as the plant plankton's food source and can be stored or used for energy. 4. Oxygen is released as a byproduct of this process. Since plant plankton needs sunlight to make food and glucose results from the process of photosynthesis, we can conclude that the answer to what plant plankton need for food is: A: Sunlight"},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

În primul rând, trebuie să abordăm problema contextului crizei financiare la nivel mondial, în special în ceea ce privește zona euro. Criza a avut un impact semnificativ asupra multor economii europene, cu efecte dramatice asupra nivelurilor de creștere economică, ocupării forței de muncă și stabilității financiare. În acest cadru, moneda comună europeană, euro, a fost pusă sub presiune și a devenit problematică din cauza discrepanțelor economice și fiscale dintre statele membre. Cu toate acestea, în ciuda acestor provocări, euro a rămas relativ stabil în comparație cu alte valute importante, precum dolarul american. Rata de schimb dintre euro și dolarul american a fluctuat în timpul crizei, dar, în general, a rămas în jurul valorii de 1,30. Această stabilitate în fața dificultăților economice evidențiază avantajele unei monede comune într-o perioadă de incertitudine globală, deoarece permite cooperare și coordonare între statele implicate. Pe lângă cooperarea la nivel de politici monetare și controlul inflației, moneda comună facilitează și schimburile comerciale între țările din zona euro. Acest lucru poate ajuta la stimularea creșterii economice, deoarece companiile au acces la piețe mai mari fără necesitatea de a se confrunta cu riscurile fluctuației valutare și cu costurile tranzacțiilor. Această stabilitate nu poate fi, însă, garantată în mod absolut, deoarece există multe factori externi - cum ar fi volatilitatea piețelor financiare internaționale sau politica fiscală și bugetară a statelor membre - care pot afecta valoarea și percepția euro pe termen lung. Prin urmare, este esențial ca statele membre să acționeze într-un mod responsabil și să își îmbunătățească competitivitatea economică pentru a susține pe termen lung moneda comună și simultan să își consolideze instrumentele de gestionare a crizelor și mecanismele de solidaritate financiară. În concluzie, în ciuda crizei care afectează multe economii europene și a discrepanțelor dintre statele membre, euro se menține stabil, cu rata sa de schimb față de dolarul american rămânând în jurul valorii de 1,30. Cu toate acestea, este important ca statele membre să continue să promoveze politici economice solide și să coopereze pentru a proteja și consolida moneda comună în fața provocărilor viitoare."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

How can I quickly locate the most upvoted answer to a Quora question? Are these two questions inquiring about the same information?","output":"These two questions are related, but not inquiring about the exact same information. The first question is about if you should read all the answers before upvoting the most upvoted answer on Quora. The second question is focused on finding a quick way to locate the most upvoted answer on the website. Firstly, to address the question regarding whether to read all answers before upvoting the most upvoted answer for a question in Quora: It is a good practice to read multiple answers to a question on Quora before upvoting any answer. There are several reasons for this: 1. Diversity of opinions: Reading multiple answers allows you to understand different perspectives and opinions from various users. This helps in broadening your knowledge about the topic, as different people may come from diverse backgrounds and experiences, leading to a richer understanding of the subject. 2. Accuracy and completeness: Reading all or at least a significant number of answers allows you to evaluate the accuracy, depth, and completeness of the information provided. The most upvoted answer might not always be the best or the most accurate one. You should evaluate answers based on the quality of their content and the credibility of their sources. 3. Fairness: Upvoting without reading other answers might lead to an unfair advantage for popular or early answers. New or less popular answers might offer valuable insights but might go unnoticed if users upvote the most upvoted answer without considering others. Now, to address the second question: How can you quickly locate the most upvoted answer to a Quora question? 1. Browse the top answers: Quora typically displays answers based on their upvotes and relevance. So, the most upvoted answer often appears at the top or near the top of the answer list. However, you should still take a moment to scroll through the other answers to verify if the top answer is indeed the most upvoted one. 2. Sort by upvotes: If you want to display answers strictly in the order of the number of upvotes, you can do so by clicking on the \\"Sort by\\" button at the top right corner of the answer list. After clicking on the \\"Sort by\\" button, select \\"Upvotes\\" from the dropdown menu. The answers will then be arranged according to the number of upvotes they have received, with the most upvoted answer being at the top. In summary, while these two questions are related, they are asking different things. The first question promotes a thoughtful consideration of all answers, while the second provides a way to quickly locate the most popular answer. When using Quora, it is beneficial to read multiple answers to gain various perspectives and ensure you're upvoting the most accurate and comprehensive response."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Translate to English English:","output":"The global economic crisis will most likely only exacerbate the already deplorable situation in which these people find themselves. In recent years, the world has witnessed several economic crises affecting various regions and impacting people's lives in numerous ways. Individuals, businesses, and governments all experience the adverse consequences of economic downturns. In this particular context, the statement highlights how the global economic crisis is likely to intensify the difficulties faced by a specific group of people who are already struggling. It is essential to analyze the different aspects and reasons through which an economic crisis might worsen the living conditions of those suffering. Furthermore, understanding the potential strategies and possible solutions to tackle these crises can help mitigate their negative impact on vulnerable populations. 1) Unemployment: Economic crises often lead to job losses and reduced work hours across industries. The higher the unemployment rate, the more significant the financial stress individuals and families experience. People who were already struggling to make ends meet before the crisis may find themselves in even more dire straits as they lose their sources of income amidst the economic turmoil. 2) Decreased government spending: Governments typically face budget constraints during economic downturns, resulting in decreased spending on social welfare programs. This directly affects the support available to disadvantaged individuals, including healthcare, education, and unemployment benefits. With reduced governmental assistance, these people become particularly vulnerable to the devastating effects of a floundering economy. 3) Inflation: Inflation often ensues during economic crises as currency values may decrease, triggering price hikes on essential goods and services. These increased costs are especially burdensome for low-income families and individuals who may no longer afford necessities like food, housing, and healthcare. 4) Poverty: The combined consequences of unemployment, reduced government spending, and inflation can escalate the poverty rate. As more people slide below the poverty line, social inequalities and disparities widen. Those who were already struggling before a crisis are at the highest risk of falling deeper into poverty, leading to more significant hardships. 5) Mental health issues: Economic crises also impact mental health, as the stress and financial uncertainties that accompany them can contribute to anxiety, depression, and other psychological disorders. The lack of access to mental healthcare and support, particularly among vulnerable populations, exacerbates these issues. To mitigate the detrimental effects of an economic crisis, governments and organizations must implement policies and provide support for vulnerable populations. These measures may include increased funding for social welfare programs, unemployment benefits, job creation projects, and financial assistance for small businesses. Additionally, investing in education and healthcare can further contribute to the economic recovery and ensure that all citizens have access to essential services. In conclusion, the global economic crisis indeed threatens to exacerbate the already difficult circumstances faced by some people. Recognizing these impacts and understanding the need for increased support can help provide a foundation for recovery efforts and alleviate the suffering of those most vulnerable to the consequences of a faltering economy."},{"instruction":"Given the task definition and input, reply with output.

Write highlights for this article: By. Robert Hardman. PUBLISHED:. 20:56 EST, 3 January 2014. |. UPDATED:. 10:09 EST, 4 January 2014. Serenaded by a jazz band, a chapter of Hell’s Angels, his family and more old geezers than on the Old Kent Road, Ronnie Biggs made his last escape yesterday afternoon — to the hereafter. His wicker coffin draped in the flags of Britain and his adopted Brazil, the best-known — if least important — of the Great Train Robbers was almost a figure of suburban respectability as he took his final bow in the same North London crematorium as Sigmund Freud, George Bernard Shaw and the Maharaja of Cooch-Behar. But here, too, were all the trappings of a traditional gangland funeral — minus the horse-drawn hearse and gold knuckledusters. Scroll down for video. The Great Train Robber's coffin, draped with a Union Flag, a Brazilian flag and a scarf of his beloved Arsenal football team is carried into Golders Green Crematorium. Tribute: Biggs's granddaughter Ingrid and son Michael speak during the funeral service. Guests had been respectfully asked not to dress in black or wear ‘aggressive or offensive jewellery’. How thoughtful. The rules did not seem to apply to floral tributes, though. One mourner had sent one in the shape of Biggs’s trademark V-sign. Shakespeare. and the poems of Biggs the bard himself were liberally quoted in a. service that drew large numbers of shaven-headed men in leather coats. and a few hard-smoking women. How. many actually knew the man? One of the Hell’s Angels cheerfully. admitted he was just a ‘hanger on’, but said he was glad to be part of. it all. There was also a smattering of celebrities from showbusiness and. the criminocracy. Actor. Steven Berkoff arrived late — ‘the traffic was murder’ he told a. congregation not unfamiliar with the real thing — to deliver his. reflections on ‘a modern-day Ulysses’. Drug. smuggler-turned-author Howard Marks saluted ‘a man of great nobility’ while admitting he had never actually met Biggs in person. Celebrity. ex-gangster Dave Courtney arrived bearing a floral display in the shape. of a train and the succinct inscription ‘Gutted’. In loving memory: A copy of the order of service for the funeral of Ronnie Biggs. Send off: The Hells Angels bikers arrive at the funeral, leading the coffin to the crematorium. Armed. robber and certified madman Charles Bronson also sent a bouquet from. prison and a separate message that was read out during the service:. ‘Ronnie was an icon, a man’s man. Max respect to a diamond geezer.’ There. was a lot of this sort of stuff all afternoon and on into the night as. the mourners grew increasingly lachrymose at a boozer on the Finchley. Road. Also represented was. another strand of London criminal folklore in the form of Freddie ‘Brown. Bread’ Foreman, erstwhile henchman of the Kray twins. But. for all the clapped-out tough guy posturing and half-hearted clenched. fist salutes, the most genuine moment of the day was when Biggs’s son,. Michael, delivered a moving eulogy to the father who had, for many. years, raised him as a single parent in Rio. Acknowledging. that Biggs the villain had been a ‘petty crook who never had any real. success’, he spoke emotionally of the jazz-loving, samba-dancing,. Arsenal-mad champion of the underdog who became ‘my dad, my mum, my. entire family’. Tribute: A six-piece Dixie band joined the procession for the final part of the journey to the crematorium.Leading the hearse and funeral cars, it played songs including When the Saints Come Marching In. Defiance: Ronnie Biggs, seen last year when he made his final public appearance (left), gives a two-fingered salute. He was involved in the Great Train Robbery when he was much younger (right) in 1963. Michael was. the product of Biggs’s affair with a Brazilian dancer after he had fled. to Rio from Australia when his cover was blown in 1970. His. first wife, the devoted Charmian, remained in Australia with their two. surviving sons (another boy, Nicky, died in a car accident). She. still lives there, still bears his name and had sent her own recording. of Shakespeare’s sonnet — ‘Let me not to the marriage of true minds. Admit. impediments ...’  This was more than goodbye to a famous ex-con. This. was a farewell to that black-and-white world of old-style cops and. robbers, of ‘Slipper of the Yard’ and ‘Buster’ Edwards, of bygone heists. planned in smoke-filled pubs and exhaustively chronicled by Fleet. Street for the benefit of a more innocent world. The. Great Train Robbery remains the last criminal showstopper of modern. times which did not involve guns, knives, death, sex or drugs. The. 30-year sentence Biggs received would be inconceivable now. Final sendoff: Draped in both a British flag and a Brazilian flag - in honour of the South American country where he spent so many years on the run - Ronnie Biggs' coffin is taken to his funeral. Hells Angels: The bikers went in front of the funeral cortege as the coffin was driven to the crematorium. Tribute act: The bikers arrive at Ronnie Biggs' family's home in Barnet, north London, to make the journey to the crematorium. For. all the sentimental tosh  spoken about it yesterday, however, it was no. Ealing comedy. Train driver Jack Mills received a savage beating and. many of those involved were never the same again. Biggs. was not a key member of the  gang that seized more than £2.6 million. from the Glasgow-to- London mail train in August 1963. His job had merely been to supply a bent train driver to replace Mills (in the end, Biggs’s man was not even up to the task). Biggs himself once likened his role to that of ‘teaboy’. His. notoriety and enduring  celebrity followed his escape from Wandsworth. Prison to Australia and, latterly, Brazil, where he spent 31 years. raising his proverbial two fingers to British justice. Even after returning home in 2001, upon which he was immediately imprisoned, his attitude was much the same. Short. of cash and laid low by three strokes, he threw himself at the mercy of. the NHS and the British taxpayer, pleading: ‘I am a sick man. My last. wish is to walk into a Margate pub as an Englishman and buy a pint of. bitter.’ Defiant to the last: Thief Ronnie Biggs swears at photographers at the funeral of fellow Great Train Robber Bruce Reynolds last year. Living it up: Ronnie Biggs relaxes in Brazil in 1997 where he spent 36 years on the run from British justice before returning to get medical care. Notorious: Ronnie Biggs, who died last month, revelled in the fame his heinous crime brought him. In 2009, Britain was taken for another ride when Biggs was released from prison in the belief that he was about to die. Two. years later, he was still well enough to say that he was ‘proud’ to. have been one of the robbers, adding: ‘I would do it all again without. the slightest hesitation!’ Nine. months ago, hunched in a wheelchair at the funeral of gang leader Bruce. Reynolds, Biggs raised another two-fingered salute at the media. Yet. it was the media whom Biggs had to thank for the one thing that kept. the money rolling in long after his stolen loot ran out: the legend of. Ronnie Biggs. Yesterday, that legend came to an end, far from the dancing girls of the Copacabana, in Golders Green crematorium. As his son admitted fondly, the old rogue had not even left enough money to cover last night’s bar bill.","output":"The article by Robert Hardman memorializes the controversial figure of Ronnie Biggs, one of the renown yet least consequential members of the Great Train Robbers. His funeral was held in North London, attracting a motley crowd of relatives, Hell's Angels bikers, celebrities, and fans of criminal folklore. The display had all the characteristics of a traditional gangland funeral, with Biggs' coffin draped in both the British and Brazilian flags, representing his country of origin and his final place of refuge. Notable mentions at Ronnie Biggs' funeral include actor Steven Berkoff who described Biggs as a 'modern-day Ulysses'. Drug smuggler-turned-author Howard Marks spoke about Biggs as a man of 'great nobility', although Marks admitted that they had never met in person. Celebrity ex-gangster Dave Courtney, in a display of grief, brought along a floral tribute in the shape of a train.  As part of the funeral eulogy, Biggs' son, Michael, praised his father's role in his upbringing. After acknowledging his father's criminal past, he lauded Biggs' love for jazz music, samba dancing, and the Arsenal football team. He called him a man who championed the underdog, and, in his own words, referred to him as 'my dad, my mum, my entire family'.  The author refers to Biggs' funeral as a send-off to an era of old-style cops and robbers, chronicled by a simpler world, unaccustomed to violent criminal activities. Biggs' role in the Great Train Robbery, an event that did not involve guns, knives, death, sex or drugs, became a notoriety that followed him even after his escape to Australia and Brazil. Despite his reduced role in the actual crime, he became a widely recognized figure, largely for his audacious evasions from justice.  In a twist of irony, a penniless and ailing Biggs turned to the British healthcare system to care for him in his twilight years, in spite of him spending 31 years blatantly evading British jurisdiction. Released from imprisonment in 2009 under the assumption that he was nearing the end of his life, Biggs lived for several more years, still reveling in his infamous fame.  The article concludes by suggesting that the media was responsible for sustaining the legend of Ronnie Biggs. His death in North London, far from the glamour of Brazil, signaled the end of an era as well as that enduring legend."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant. You will be given a task.

In 1948, Mann began his professional football career, playing with the Detroit Lions and later the Green Bay Packers. Throughout his career from 1948 to 1954, he demonstrated outstanding athleticism on the field, which is evident from his stats. Mann's slight build (5 feet 11 inches tall, 172 pounds) didn't hold him back from achieving success in the field. Mann's exceptional performance earned him a spot in the Packers Hall of Fame, a prestigious honor that recognized his contribution to the team. His time spent playing for both the Detroit Lions and the Green Bay Packers helped shape the teams during those years. Unfortunately, on October 21, 2006, Bob Mann passed away in Detroit, Michigan. Despite his death, the legacy Bob Mann left behind as a trailblazing wide receiver in American football lives on. His time spent on the field playing for two remarkable NFL teams, as well as his induction into the Packers Hall of Fame, serves as testaments to his lasting impact on the sport."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Q:Write a multi-choice question for the following article, with the given choices and answer: Article: People think of ice cream as an American food. Yet, ice cream really came from Asia. In the late 1200s Marco Polo, the great explorer, is said to have seen rich Asians eating dishes of ice. Camels had brought the ice from distant mountains. Before it was served, the ice had been flavored  with fruits. Marco Polo brought this new dish to Italy, In France cooks changed the ice recipe  and made ice cream. At first, cooks tried to keep the recipe a secret. They wanted it to be a special dish for rich people. By the late 1700s, though, ice cream was sold throughout Europe and America. Some great Americans loved ice cream. George Washington was the first to buy a special machine for making it. When Thomas Jefferson returned from France, he brought an ice cream recipe home with him. Dolly Madison, wife of President James Madison, also liked ice cream, and she often served it at the White House. Actually, a famous brand  of ice cream was even named after her. In the late 1800s, the ice cream industry began to grow. A way of keeping ice cream frozen had been found, so ice cream makers did not have to worry about ice cream melting anymore.

Q: Article: New findings show that musical training affects the structure and function of different brain areas, how those areas communicate during the creation of music, and how the brain interprets and combines sensory  information. The findings were presented at Neuroscience 2013, the annual meeting of the Society for Neuroscience and the world's largest source of emerging news about brain science and health. These views suggest potential new roles for musical training including training plasticity in the brain, offering an alternative tool in education, and treating a range of learning disabilities. Today's new findings show that long-term high level musical training has a broader effect. Researchers found that musicians have a better ability to combine sensory information from hearing, touch, and sight. The age at which musical training begins influenced brain structure and its function. Beginning training before the age of seven has the greatest effect. Even older adults who took music lessons as children but haven't actively played an instrument in decades have a faster brain response  to a speech sound than those who never played an instrument, according to a study appearing November 6 in the Journal of Neuroscience. The finding suggests early musical training has a lasting, positive effect on how the brain deals with sound. \\"Playing a musical instrument is a multi-sensory and motive experience that creates emotions and movements--from finger tapping to dancing -- and engages pleasure and reward systems in the brain. It has the potential to affect brain function and structure when done over a long period of time,\\" said Gottfried Schlaug, MD, PhD, of Harvard Medical School, press conference speaker, also an expert on music. \\"As today's findings show, musical training brings about new processes within the brain, at different stages of life, and with a range of effects on creativity, cognition , and learning,\\" he added.

Plot title: Doctor Dolittle Movie plot: In early Victorian England, Matthew Mugg (Anthony Newley) takes his young friend Tommy Stubbins (William Dix) to visit eccentric Doctor John Dolittle (Rex Harrison) for a sick duck that Tommy had found in the streets, Dolittle, a former physician, lives with an extended menagerie, including a chimpanzee named Chee-Chee (Cheeta), a dog named Jip, and a talking parrot named Polynesia (the uncredited voice of Ginny Tyler). Dolittle claims that he can talk to animals. In a flashback, he explains that he kept so many animals in his home that they created havoc with his human patients, who took their medical needs elsewhere. His sister, who served as his housekeeper, demanded that he dispose of the animals or she would leave; he chose the animals. Polynesia taught him that different animal species can talk to each other, prompting Dolittle to study animal languages so that he could become an animal doctor. While treating a horse, Dolittle's lack of human empathy offends the horse's owner, General Bellowes (Peter Bull). Bellowes' niece, Emma Fairfax (Samantha Eggar), chides Dolittle for his irresponsibility and rudeness to her uncle. Matthew falls in love with her at first sight. After she has gone, Dolittle admits he also finds her attractive. A friend of Dolittle's sends him a rare Pushmi-pullyu, a creature that looks like a llama with a head on each end of its body. Dolittle takes the creature to a nearby circus, where the Pushmi-Pullyu becomes the star attraction. The doctor befriends a circus seal named Sophie who longs to return to her husband at the North Pole. Dolittle disguises her in women's clothing to convey her to the coast, and then throws her into the ocean. Fishermen mistake the seal for a woman, and have Doctor Dolittle arrested on a charge of murder. General Bellowes is the magistrate in his case, but Dolittle proves he can converse with animals by talking with Bellowes' dog. Though Dolittle is acquitted, the vindictive judge sentences him to a lunatic asylum. Dolittle's animal friends rescue him,... My question: Who do they mistake for hostile savages?

Biologists say a mysterious fungus is threatening to wipe out some isolated... (Associated Press)      NEW HAVEN, Vt. (AP) — Hidden on hillsides in a remote part of western Vermont, a small number of venomous timber rattlesnakes slither among the rocks, but their isolation can't protect them from a mysterious fungus spreading across the eastern half of the country that threatens to wipe them out.      In less than a decade, the fungus has been identified in at least nine Eastern states, and although it affects a number of species, it's especially threatening to rattlesnakes that live in small, isolated populations with little genetic diversity, such as those found in Vermont, New Hampshire, Massachusetts and New York.      In Illinois the malady threatens the eastern massasauga rattlesnake, which was a candidate for the federal endangered species list even before the fungus appeared.      Biologists have compared its appearance to the fungus that causes white nose syndrome in bats, which since 2006 has killed millions of the creatures and continues to spread across North America.      It's unclear, though, if snake fungal disease, \\"ophidiomyces ophiodiicola\\" was brought to the United States from elsewhere, as was white nose fungus, or if it has always been present in the environment and for some unknown reason is now infecting snakes, biologists say.      \\"I think potentially this could overwhelm any conservation effort we could employ to try to protect this last remaining population,\\" said Doug Blodgett, a biologist with the Vermont Department of Fish and Wildlife who has been studying the state's rattlesnake population for 15 years. \\"We don't have any control over it. It's just completely out there in the wild.\\"      Rattlesnakes were once found across much of the country, but habitat loss and efforts by fearful humans to wipe them out reduced their numbers, especially at the northern edges of their range.      In New Hampshire, the disease helped halve the population of rattlesnakes — now estimated at several dozen — after it was first spotted in 2006, although it was only afterward that scientists linked the fungus to the decline, officials said.      Vermont's population of timber rattlesnakes is down to two locations near Lake Champlain in the western part of the state with an estimated total population of several hundred.      An Associated Press reporter was allowed to accompany wildlife officials to a rattlesnake habitat on condition the exact location not be revealed out of concern that too much attention could further threaten them. Blodgett led an hours-long search for some of the elusive creatures until he found a pair hiding in a rocky crevice, though it wasn't clear if they were infected. Later, a healthy single snake was found on the forest floor.      The disease can cause crusty scabs and lesions, sometimes on the head.      Jeffrey Lorch, a microbiologist with the U.S. Geological Survey's National Wildlife Health Center in Madison, Wisconsin, said he's been getting reports of snake fungal disease from all over the eastern United States. Not every location is reporting that the disease is threatening snake populations.      \\"It does seem to be a disease that has different effects in different areas,\\" Lorch said.      The fungus poses a greater risk to snakes that reproduce slowly, such as rattlesnakes, which can live up to 30 years, experts say.      In Illinois every year the disease infects about 15 percent of the population of about 300 of massasauga rattlesnakes, most of which are in Clinton County, with a mortality rate of 80 to 90 percent, said Matt Allender, a wildlife veterinarian and epidemiologist at the University of Illinois who started noticing the fungus in 2011. The mortality rate in infected timber rattlesnakes is estimated between 30 and 70 percent, he said.      The fungus' impact on the massasauga is expected to play a part in the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service's determination on whether to list the snake as endangered, officials said.      \\"I think that in populations that have been shrunk due to other mechanisms, such as habitat loss, other environmental changes, those types of things, are more at risk of going extinct from snake fungal disease mainly because it's a smaller population,\\" Allender said. \\"They have less of a buffer to withstand these diseases.\\"      Part of the challenge in studying the disease is that snakes, especially venomous varieties, don't get much sympathy from the public, which makes funding studies harder. Snakes are also harder to find than, say, white-nose-infected bats where scientists can go into a cave and see tens of thousands of carcasses, Lorch said.      The fungus has been found in all five rattlesnake populations in Massachusetts, but it doesn't appear to have had the high mortality rate reported elsewhere, said Anne Stengle, a Ph.D. candidate at the University of Massachusetts who is overseeing a federal grant in nine states to study the fungus.      Since the initial hit, the decline in the Granite State's timber rattlesnakes appears to have stabilized and some are reproducing, said New Hampshire Fish and Game Biologist Mike Marchand.      \\"I'm at least optimistic that there are animals that are successfully surviving from year to year as well as reproducing,\\" Marchand said. \\"We had a pretty strong dip in the population.\\" ||||| A summary of this is?","output":"A mysterious fungal disease known as \\"ophidiomyces ophiodiicola\\" is threatening the already dwindling population of venomous timber rattlesnakes in the eastern United States, particularly in Vermont, New Hampshire, Massachusetts, and New York.

Summarize this article: At a winding-up hearing at the High Court, Orient owner Francesco Becchetti has been given until 12 June to pay off debts or sell the club. The League Two side were the subject of a winding-up petition brought by HM Revenue & Customs over unpaid taxes. Those debts have now been paid, but money is owed to four other creditors. Chief executive Alessandro Angelieri gave the court a statement saying Becchetti would invest £1m to pay off remaining debts in eight to 10 weeks. Adam Michaelson, legal adviser to the Leyton Orient Fans' Trust, told BBC Radio London: \\"It leaves the club in a state of significant uncertainty and frankly mortal danger. \\"In respect of a potential sale, we would call upon Mr Becchetti now to look to sell the club at the earliest possible opportunity and make good on the promise that he's made.\\" In January, Becchetti said he would be willing to consider selling the struggling League Two side, which he bought in 2014. The club's latest set of accounts, from the year ending 30 June 2015, showed the club had debts of £5,512,449 - more than the value of the club's assets of £5.5m. Analysis - Phil Parry, BBC Radio London So, with a sword of Damocles still swinging over their heads, Orient will have to battle on. Mathematically they still have a chance to avoid relegation, although form would suggest that is unlikely. They have eight games left, are seven points from safety and have picked up just three points from the last 24 available. Off the pitch, with outstanding bills yet to be paid, operations at Brisbane Road may be difficult. For example, a company which provides matchday stewards is on the list of creditors, and perhaps the remaining matchday programmes may not return to full size. As we wait to see if the extra £1m investment promised in court materialises, fans will continue to make preparations for all eventualities. The Fans' Trust has already raised more than £100,000 and are planning to keep Leyton Orient alive in some guise, including a possible 'phoenix club'. Meanwhile, all eyes will be peeled to see if talk of a buy-out comes to fruition.

Please answer the following question: It's often difficult to remember how or why you became friends with someone, especially if you've been friends with a person forever. But because of the very specific set of circumstances, I remember exactly how Barend and I became friends. This, of course, was long before he became famous for inventing the easy-foldable map, and infamous for the series of bodies he'd decided to bury in his backyard. Barend and I became friends because he had one of the most attractive shadows I'd ever seen. I remember gazing out over the playground, watching a waning sun scatter its dying light over the monkey bars, the metal skeleton contrasting against the turquoise sky, when I noticed this kid coming toward me. He was one of those mostly invisible characters; faded jeans, dirty jacket, snot caked on his upper lip. I probably wouldn't have noticed him if not for his shadow. For some reason, his shadow immediately caught my eye. Now, I'm not one for noticing shadows in general, never really noticed a shadow before or since, but this kid had the most incredible shadow I'd ever seen. I cannot even put in words what that means. What specific set of properties make an ordinary shadow into an incredible one, I'm not sure anyone can, but his shadow was like a piece of art; I didn't necessarily understand it, but I liked it. And that's why this boring looking kid and I first became friends. Our kindergarten games were harmless and boring, but when puberty hit, Barend began to change. We were both expected to change, but I guess some kids just change more than others. Bared didn't want to kill at first. Like many overachievers in the death game, his first brush with the craft came about more or less accidentally. All the elements had been in place, with all the players and attributes coming together as if gathered by some evil force, but, even then, I really had to push the kid. Immediately after the end of this text, author: - not enough information - will continue playing on the playground - will tell how Barend killed people - will tell about his lunch A:","output":"Taking into account the specifics of your request, the continuation of the story will involve us delving back into our playground days, recounting the gradual change in Barend and his descent into becoming a killer. One of our favorite games as children was playing 'Secret Agent'. We transformed from ordinary school kids to superhuman spies, saving the world from the dangerous villains we imagined. The most attractive aspect of this game was the element of danger and thrill it presented us. Little did I know then that this game was a prelude to the gloomy future Barend would end up having. Barend was a creative player, inventing intricate stories of international espionage missions where we had to use cunning tactics to defeat our enemies. He always took things a step further, executing imaginary enemies ruthlessly. As a child, I found it slightly disconcerting, but dismissed it as a product of an overactive imagination. During our teenage years, Barend's love for danger and thrill didn't subside. It only intensified, but this wasn't surprising. Most of our friends were diving headfirst into youthful rebellion; the more outgoing ones picked up skateboarding, surfing, and graffiti, while the more reserved ones like Barend seeped into the deeper corners of the internet, indulging in increasingly graphic and disturbing content. Barend’s first brush with killing wasn’t as dramatic as one might expect. It began with a pet hamster. It accidentally got crushed when Barend was rearranging his room. But the lack of remorse, the curious dissection, and the clandestine burial was what raised the alarms. I felt a creeping sense of discomfort, which only grew when a neighborhood cat mysteriously disappeared shortly after–only to be discovered weeks later in Barend’s backyard, similar clandestine burial. I don’t have a detailed account of each murder Barend committed. We drifted apart when he started delving into the macabre like a moth drawn to a flame. I couldn’t relate to, nor condone, his actions. But as the news unfurled the gruesome details of his misdeeds, I found myself haunted by the memory of the young boy with the fascinating shadow, and burdened with the knowledge that this was the same person. The playground now stands as an eerie reminder of Barend—once an eccentric friend, now a notorious serial killer—and the fading glow of our childhood innocence. Each rusted swing and neglected monkey bar harbors the memories of our naive games, which were once dominated by creativity and shadowed with beautiful innocence, only to be corrupted by the dark cloud of Barend's future endeavors. Lastly, during the interrogation, I recall a peculiar detail associated with Barend. When asked about routine hacking tools or weapons, he instead pointed towards his lunch, a heavily meat-based diet that was always his preference. He said it gave him the strength and the keen sense of death. This disturbing correlation between murderous tendencies and his food habits served as an obscure revelation into the complexity of his criminal mindset. So, that's the journey of how Barend, my playground friend, turned into a dreaded murderer. His shadow, once artwork, now symbolizes a grim silhouette of the horror his acts bestow, forever changing my perception of our past friendship."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Guidelines: 1. Include Fact1: Tony is asked to visit a notorious artist out of the church's concern about a blasphemous painting of a crucifix. 2. Include Fact2: The artist plans to exhibit the painting. 3. Include Fact3: Estella accompanies Tony on a visit to the artist's bucolic compound in the Blue Mountains. 4. Include Fact4: Members of a bohemian group have frank conversations about human sexuality. 5. Include Fact5: A husband walking nearby is disturbed by the scene's sexual content. Story: In a small town blessed with faith and tradition, Tony, a respected member of the local church, was approached by the elders with a delicate matter. They had recently heard troubling news about a notorious artist, who was working on a painting that potentially depicted a blasphemous rendition of the crucifix. The church, fearing the spiritual unrest that could ensue, decided to take action. Fact1: Tony is asked to visit notorious artist out of church 's concern about blasphemous painting of crucifix. They entrusted Tony with the responsibility of visiting the artist and expressing the church's concerns. Hoping to make the artist understand the possible consequences of the blasphemous art, they implored Tony to appeal to his sense of responsibility and judgment. Fact2: The artist plans to exhibit the painting. Upon receiving the task, Tony discovered that the artist was not only working on the painting but also planning to exhibit it in a prominent gallery in the city. He knew he had to act fast before the art would spark a controversy that could tear the community apart. To help him on his mission, Tony asked Estella, a wise and eloquent friend, to accompany him on the visit. She agreed, sensing the urgency of the matter and the potential harm that the painting could cause. Fact3: Estella accompanies him on visit to artist 's bucolic compound in Blue Mountains. The notorious artist lived in a beautiful, secluded compound tucked away in the lush, rolling hills of the Blue Mountains. Upon arrival, Tony and Estella were greeted by the enchanting natural surroundings and the distinct scent of lavender and pine. The artist's home appeared to be a paradise for artistic inspiration. As they made their way through the compound, they came across a bohemian group gathered in an open area, engaged in deep, philosophical discussions. They seemed to be friends or associates of the notorious artist. To Tony and Estella's discomfort, the group freely discussed matters of human sexuality, completely disregarding the limits set by decency and religious beliefs. Fact4: Members of bohemian group frank conversations about participate human sexuality. With determination and a shared sense of duty, Tony and Estella pressed on, trying to find the artist and achieve their goal. As they approached the artist's atelier, they noticed a husband walking nearby, who was clearly flustered and disturbed by the sexual content of the conversations he had just witnessed. Fact5: husband walking nearby is disturbed by scene 's sexual content. Tony and Estella wondered whether the sensibilities of other townspeople would be similarly affected upon encountering such unrestrained discourse about sexuality. They knew their mission was more essential than ever. Eventually, they reached the artist's quarters and presented their case, appealing to the artist's sense of reason and highlighting the importance of respecting community values. They emphasized that art, as a powerful medium, should be used to inspire and uplift rather than to provoke and offend. As the artist listened, he began to understand the gravity of their concerns and the potential impact of his controversial work on others. Realizing that his creativity could create discord in the community, the artist vowed to deal with his painting with more consideration and sensitivity. In the end, Tony and Estella's journey helped them understand the power of communication and empathy, demonstrating that when shared with love and openness, even the most difficult and contentious topics can be addressed with wisdom and understanding. The community remained strong in faith while embracing artists' contributions, finding a delicate balance between creative freedom and communal harmony."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Don't touch the handcuffs at all, and keep your hands still. Mom and dad always say, \\"don't touch things that aren't yours,\\" right?

Brechas en el muro How do you say this sentence in English?","output":"The sentence \\"Brechas en el muro\\" in Spanish translates to \\"Gaps in the wall\\" in English.  The term \\"brechas\\" means \\"gaps\\" or \\"cracks\\", usually referring to an opening or a space where there normally shouldn't be one, due to damage, design or weak points. Moreover, \\"en el muro\\" literally translates to \\"in the wall\\". Walls could be physical, referring to structures like bricks or plaster walls in houses or buildings, or metaphorical ones, like barriers or divisional aspects in a broader societal or psychological context.  For instance, in a building inspection, \\"brechas en el muro\\" could refer to physical damages that need repair. In societal terms, it might denote social, political, or ideological divisions, and the gaps could symbolize discrepancies or differences within a societal barrier that usually keeps people or ideas separated.

Please answer the following question: Six weeks after arriving in the United States, Hassan Abduraheem takes a seat in the back pew of Tar Wallet Baptist Church. Tucked into the woods along a country road in rural Virginia, the church holds about 50 worshippers. On this cold November Sunday, Abduraheem and his family of eight noticeably increase the congregation's size. They do their best to follow the unfamiliar English of the old Baptist hymns, which are very familiar to their new neighbors. And they share the hymns from their former home — Sudan. Standing in a single line in front of the altar, the family fills the church with Arabic song. \\"Unbelievable,\\" Abduraheem says repeatedly, as he describes his journey from a crowded prison cell in Sudan to a fixed-up house on the farm of his new pastor. \\"Unbelievable\\" seems like the only word that could describe the turn his life took, thanks to a Facebook post and a U.S. congressman. Abduraheem's work as a former pastor is not outlawed in his native Sudan, but Christians are a minority in a diverse country that has suffered through multiple civil wars. According to the United States Commission on International Religious Freedom, there has been \\"an escalation in the Sudanese government's persecution of Christians,” since the 2011 secession of South Sudan. Abduraheem says his work was spreading the gospel; the Sudanese government accused him of espionage, and he was detained along with two other pastors in December 2015. \\"The first day when they took us to the prison, they beat us,” he says softly.  Abduraheem was shifted from prison to prison. For five months, he wore the same clothes he was wearing when he was arrested. His eyes became damaged from the harsh prison light. Yet, despite constant interrogations, just two meals of beans a day and a tiny cell with barely enough room to sleep, he says the worst part of prison was not knowing. After what Abduraheem's story, how does he probably feel about being a Christian?  A. He now feels that he can be proud and open to being a Christian  B. He now feels that his religion doesn't do him any good  C. He now still feels reserved and doesn't share openly that he is a Christian  D. not enough information Answer:","output":"A. He now feels that he can be proud and open to being a Christian Hassan Abduraheem's story is a testament to the strength of his faith and his resilience in the face of adversity. Despite facing persecution, imprisonment, and harsh conditions in Sudan, he remained steadfast in his Christian beliefs. Now, having arrived in the United States—a country known for its freedom of religion and speech—the environment is much more conducive for him to openly practice and share his faith with others.  The fact that Abduraheem is attending Tar Wallet Baptist Church, openly participating in the hymns, and sharing his own Arabic songs from Sudan, all indicate that he now feels a newfound freedom and pride in being a Christian. Additionally, his journey to the United States—made possible through the help of a Facebook post and a U.S. congressman—may also contribute to his feelings of hope and gratitude, further reinforcing his faith and sense of openness. In this new environment, where his beliefs and rights are protected, Hassan Abduraheem can finally embrace and celebrate his faith without fear of persecution or punishment."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

In one sentence, describe what the following article is about: There are many types of meditation, so finding the one that works for you is important. Meditation has been shown to lower blood pressure, lessen anxiety, and much more.  If you’re looking for a way to rest without actually sleeping, meditation is a rewarding and mindful way of achieving that goal. Rather than laying on the coaching tossing and turning trying to feel rested, practicing meditation can actively improve your quality of rest. Work breaks into your day before you start to feel exhausted or overtired. If you keep pushing yourself until you actually start to feel awful, it will make it much harder to recover and feel rested. Work breaks into your life on a daily basis, a weekly basis, a monthly basis, and a yearly basis. Everyone needs time to recoup and recharge. This can be as easy as sitting outside for a few minutes before going back to work, taking one day to yourself a week, or a relaxing vacation. We all have a strong habit of discursive thinking, which means one thought flows to the next and then the next. This can be exhausting, and if you practice not thinking you can give your mind a valuable break.  Open your senses to what is happening around you and pay attention, but don't think about them. Just experience them. When you find yourself drifting back into a line of thought, notice this and go back to paying attention to what you are experiencing. Sleeping is the one time when we are really able to give our minds a rest. Although meditation can help, sleeping is absolutely necessary to feel rested. Don't sacrifice sleep for other activities because the odds are they won't benefit your well being and happiness nearly as much as those extra hours will. Sounds like running water, birds chirping, and even storms can help you relax and stop stressing about whatever is going through your head. You can find playlists of these online. Other great options include gongs, chimes, or whatever instrumental music you might like. The brain always wants some sort of sensory input , and by supplying these sounds you might be able to let go of the more stressful input that you are supplying.","output":"The article emphasizes the importance of finding the right type of meditation for an individual to achieve rest and relaxation, encourages incorporating regular breaks in daily life, advocates for adequate sleep, and suggests using calming sounds to help the mind let go of stress and achieve a peaceful state."},{"instruction":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

Rockefeller was the second of six children and eldest son born in Richford, New York to con artist William Avery \\"Bill\\" Rockefeller (November 13, 1810 - May 11, 1906) and Eliza Davison (September 12, 1813 - March 28, 1889). His siblings were Lucy (1838-1878), William Jr. (1841-1922), Mary (1843-1925) and twins Franklin (Frank) (1845-1917) and Frances (1845-1847). His father was of English and German descent while his mother was of Scots-Irish descent. Bill was first a lumberman and then a traveling salesman who identified himself as a \\"botanic physician\\" and sold elixirs. In 1859, Rockefeller went into the produce commission business with a partner, Maurice B. Clark, and they raised 4,000 (108,948 in 2017 dollars) in capital. Rockefeller went steadily ahead in business from there, making money each year of his career. While his brother Frank fought in the Civil War, Rockefeller tended his business and hired substitute soldiers. He gave money to the Union cause, as did many rich Northerners who avoided combat. Rockefeller was an abolitionist who voted for President Abraham Lincoln and supported the then-new Republican Party. As he said, \\"God gave me money\\", and he did not apologize for it. He felt at ease and righteous following Methodist preacher John Wesley's dictum, \\"gain all you can, save all you can, and give all you can.\\"  At that time, the Federal government was subsidizing oil prices, driving the price up from .35 a barrel in 1862 to as high as 13.75. This created an oil-drilling glut, with thousands of speculators attempting to make their fortunes. Most failed, but those who struck oil did not even need to be efficient. They would blow holes in the ground and gather up the oil as they could, often leading to creeks and rivers flowing with wasted oil in the place of water.  In this environment of wasteful boom, the partners switched from foodstuffs to oil, building an oil refinery in 1863 in \\"The Flats\\", then Cleveland's burgeoning industrial area. The refinery was directly owned by Andrews, Clark & Company, which was composed of Clark & Rockefeller, chemist Samuel Andrews, and M. B. Clark's two brothers. The commercial oil business was then in its infancy. Whale oil had become too expensive for the masses, and a cheaper, general-purpose lighting fuel was needed.  While other refineries would keep the 60% of oil product that became kerosene, but dump the other 40% in rivers and massive sludge piles, Rockefeller remained as thrifty and efficient as ever, using the gasoline to fuel the refinery, and selling the rest as lubricating oil, petroleum jelly and paraffin wax, and other by-products. Tar was used for paving, naphtha shipped to gas plants. Likewise, Rockefeller's refineries hired their own plumbers, cutting the cost of pipe-laying in half. Barrels that cost 2.50 each ended up only .96 when Rockefeller bought the wood and had them built for himself.  In February 1865, in what was later described by oil industry historian Daniel Yergin as a \\"critical\\" action, Rockefeller bought out the Clark brothers for 72,500 (equivalent to 1 million in 2017 dollars) at auction and established the firm of Rockefeller & Andrews. Rockefeller said, \\"It was the day that determined my career.\\" He was well positioned to take advantage of postwar prosperity and the great expansion westward fostered by the growth of railroads and an oil-fueled economy. He borrowed heavily, reinvested profits, adapted rapidly to changing markets, and fielded observers to track the quickly expanding industry.

The province has a saltwater coastline bordering Hudson Bay and more than 110,000 lakes, covering approximately 15.6 percent or 101,593 square kilometres (39,225 sq mi) of its surface area. Manitoba's major lakes are Lake Manitoba, Lake Winnipegosis, and Lake Winnipeg, the tenth-largest freshwater lake in the world. Some traditional Native lands and boreal forest on Lake Winnipeg's east side are a proposed UNESCO World Heritage Site.Manitoba is at the centre of the Hudson Bay drainage basin, with a high volume of the water draining into Lake Winnipeg and then north down the Nelson River into Hudson Bay. This basin's rivers reach far west to the mountains, far south into the United States, and east into Ontario. Major watercourses include the Red, Assiniboine, Nelson, Winnipeg, Hayes, Whiteshell and Churchill rivers. Most of Manitoba's inhabited south has developed in the prehistoric bed of Glacial Lake Agassiz. This region, particularly the Red River Valley, is flat and fertile; receding glaciers left hilly and rocky areas throughout the province.Baldy Mountain is the province's highest point at 832 metres (2,730 ft) above sea level, and the Hudson Bay coast is the lowest at sea level. Riding Mountain, the Pembina Hills, Sandilands Provincial Forest, and the Canadian Shield are also upland regions. Much of the province's sparsely inhabited north and east lie on the irregular granite Canadian Shield, including Whiteshell, Atikaki, and Nopiming Provincial Parks.Extensive agriculture is found only in the province's southern areas, although there is grain farming in the Carrot Valley Region (near The Pas). The most common agricultural activity is cattle husbandry (34.6%), followed by assorted grains (19.0%) and oilseed (7.9%). Around 12 percent of Canada's farmland is in Manitoba.

Title: Air Force One Movie plot: American and Russian Special Forces capture General Ivan Radek (JÃ¼rgen Prochnow), the dictator of a rogue terrorist regime in Kazakhstan that possessed stolen Soviet nuclear weapons, threatening to start a new Cold War. Three weeks after the mission, U.S. President James Marshall (Harrison Ford) attends a diplomatic dinner in Moscow, during which he praises the capture and insists the United States will no longer negotiate with terrorists. Marshall and his entourage, including his wife Grace (Wendy Crewson) and daughter Alice (Liesel Matthews), and several of his Cabinet and advisers, prepare to return to the United States on Air Force One. In addition, a number of members of the press corps have been invited aboard, including Russian terrorists and Radek loyalists disguised as journalists led by Ivan Korshunov (Gary Oldman). After takeoff, Secret Service agent Gibbs (Xander Berkeley), who has been a mole, enables Korshunov and his men to obtain weapons and storm the plane, killing many of the other agents and military personnel before taking the civilians hostage. Marshall is raced to an escape pod in the cargo hold while pursued by Korshunov's men but they are too late to capture him as the pod is ejected. Instead, Korshunov storms the cockpit and prevents the plane from making an emergency landing at Ramstein Air Force Base in Germany, and secures Grace and Alice separately from the other hostages. Several F-15s escort Air Force One as Korshunov has it piloted towards Radek-loyal airspace. Unknown to Korshunov, Marshall, a Vietnam War veteran and Medal of Honor recipient, has remained hidden in the cargo hold instead of using the pod and begins to observe the loyalists using his military training. Marshall manages to kill some of Korshunov's men and then uses a satellite phone to make contact with his Vice President Kathryn Bennett (Glenn Close), letting his staff know he is alive.

He was an absolute delight to work with…very solicitous of his wife all throughout, very cooperative with the staff, and very appreciative of the help we were giving the mother-to-be. The background was that after 7 years of marriage, and 2 tragic miscarriages, THIS pregnancy had come to full term, and the child—deliberately they did NOT want to know the gender—was healthy, and both “mom” and “dad” were excited about the upcoming birth. The child finally emerged, the MD held up the child, and “dad” blurted out “It’s a girl!! You wanted a girl!!! Oh my God, she’s beautiful!!” Then he buried his face on his wife’s shoulder and was sobbing for pure joy. The MD quickly put him to work…he was to cut the umbilical cord. “I’m not going to hurt her, am I??” MD assured him no, he wouldn’t. He made the cut, and came immediately over to the wife…”Honey…are you all right?? I didn’t hurt you??”” While the his daughter was being bathed and checked out by the APGAR nurse, he excited called out the various observations—she as healthy..she was pinking up…she was so beautiful “I can’t believe it.” When the nurse returned the little girl to “mom”, the three of them cuddled together, tears just pouring from his eyes…and we in the birthing suite were all getting teary-eyed ourselves.

All of their items get sold (except for the death ray which Megamind used to \\"kill\\" Metro Man in the original film). As for the De-Gun (Megamind's weapon of choice used for a number of different destructive functions) it gets sold to a boy named Damien, who accidentally uses it (in its dehydration mode) on his mother and turns her into a cube. Megamind tells Damien to soak the cube in water to get her back to normal, but unknown to Megamind, Damien decides not to do it and instead revels in his freedom from his mother.

Think like you are answering to a five year old. Summarize: It means hundreds of people who need a high level of nursing care will have to pay their care home charges in future. It follows revelations by the BBC that people in Scotland who should have been eligible for free care were being charged care home fees. Lawyers have told the BBC that the new proposals could be illegal. People who have certain severe medical conditions which require complex care are entitled to have that care paid by the NHS - even if it is delivered in a nursing home or in the person's own home. This is called \\"NHS continuing healthcare\\" and is in addition to the free personal care which is available to everyone in Scotland. However, last year the BBC revealed that the number of people getting all their care costs paid was falling in Scotland, whereas it was rising in England, in line with an ageing population. Following the BBC's investigation, Health Secretary Alex Neil promised to review the situation and urged anyone who felt they had been unfairly turned down for funding to contact him. That review has now accepted that the system in Scotland is not working. It said existing guidance was \\"no longer appropriate\\", \\"open to interpretation\\" and should be completely revised. It has recommended that no-one in a care home in future should have their care costs paid by the NHS. It said continuing care should only be available in facilities funded and managed by the NHS - hospitals or NHS run nursing homes. The report stated: \\"Only those individuals who are required to live in hospital should be exempted from charges relating to their accommodation. \\"All other individuals, whatever their age or disability should contribute to the funding of accommodation costs, should their financial situation permit.\\" Responding to the review, Mr Neil said: \\"This report makes a number of recommendations for reforming continuing care and putting in place a system which will be applied consistently and transparently by all NHS boards. \\"Where patients are assessed as needing this form of acute long-term care the expert group make clear that the most effective and safe way to deliver this is in a hospital setting. \\"This is welcome clarification and we'll now be working with health boards and Cosla to put in place new guidance to underpin this reform of NHS continuing care. He added: \\"We will now ensure it is applied fairly and equally to all patients across Scotland.\\" New guidance will come into force in April next year. Existing arrangements will remain in place for people who are already in receipt of continuing care. Last year, 1,711 people were receiving the care package - three quarters of whom were in NHS facilities, with the remainder in private nursing homes. Families of those affected told the BBC the report was \\"very disappointing but totally predictable\\"'. Opposition parties have criticised the review's recommendations. Scottish Labour's health spokesman Neil Findlay said: \\"The review will now create a two-tier system. \\"Scots suffering from long-term debilitating conditions after April next year will be worse off than current patients. That simply makes no sense. \\"In fact, in future, patients will be worse off than English patients in similar situations. Unless doctors rule that the patient should be in a hospital, the patient and their family will be liable for the costs.\\" Scottish Liberal Democrat health spokesman Jim Hume said: \\"This is not the outcome that anyone was expecting to the review into continuing care. This is a backwards step which goes against all that the Scottish government has said about spending to save. \\"By removing continuing care costs for people receiving treatment at home for complex care, the Scottish Government is effectively chaining people to a hospital bed when they could be in the community.\\"","output":"In simple words, many people in Scotland who need a lot of help from nurses will have to pay for their care in the future. This is because the old rules about who gets help paying for care are not clear and are being changed. Some people think these changes are not fair because these people still need lots of help, and their families will have to pay for it. The new rules will start next year and affect people who need help in nursing homes or their own homes."},{"instruction":"You are a teacher.

Firstly, we want to get rid of the -54*q and 32*q terms from the right side of the equation. To do this, we will add 54*q to both sides and subtract 32*q from both sides of the equation: -27*q + 54*q - 32*q = -54*q + 32*q - 65 + 54*q - 32*q 2.

Hypothesis: The man is in a shopping mall buying clothes. .Given the premise, can we conclude the hypothesis?","output":"No, the given premise does not support or lead to the hypothesis mentioned. Let's analyze both the premise and the hypothesis to understand why they don't have a logical connection. Premise: A man sits playing his accordion and has a suitcase filled with CDs that he is selling for 15.00. The premise focuses on a man who is playing the accordion and selling CDs at the same time. An accordion is a musical instrument, and the man appears to be a performer, most likely a street or public space performer. He has a suitcase filled with CDs, which could be recordings of his own music or that of others. The fact that he is selling these CDs for 15.00 each further supports the idea that he is engaging in a commercial activity, most likely to earn income or promote his music. Hypothesis: The man is in a shopping mall buying clothes. The hypothesis revolves around the idea that the man is in a shopping mall with the primary objective of buying clothes. Based on the premise, there is no indication or mention of a shopping mall, clothes, or the man's intention to purchase clothing items. With these analyses, it is clear that the premise does not provide any evidence or information to support the hypothesis. The premise primarily focuses on the man being a performer, engaging in a commercial activity by selling CDs, and does not suggest anything about him being in a shopping mall to buy clothes. Given the lack of connection between the premise and the hypothesis, it is not accurate or logical to conclude the hypothesis based on the provided premise. The man could be in a public space, perhaps on a busy sidewalk or in a park, where street performers are usually seen displaying their talents and selling their merchandise. It is essential to have supporting information or evidence that relates the man's activity to being in a shopping mall and buying clothes to arrive at such a hypothesis."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant that follows instruction extremely well.

Black money is like money that people hide from the government, so they don't have to pay taxes. When the 500 and 1000 Rs notes stop working, people with lots of black money will have a hard time using it. This is because they either have to exchange it at a bank, which can expose them, or use smaller notes, which is difficult with large amounts.

Reduce your activity level. Sleep more.\\" Article:","output":"**Title: The Ultimate Guide to a Healthier Lifestyle: Simple Tips for Long-lasting Well-being** As we navigate the complexities of modern life, taking care of our physical, mental, and emotional well-being is of paramount importance. With so many aspects of our lives demanding attention, a simple and practical approach to a healthier lifestyle is key. Thankfully, following a few basic recommendations can make a significant difference. In this article, we will delve into a handful of tips that can help you achieve and maintain a better state of health in the long run. **1. Increase your vegetable consumption to five to nine servings per day** Consuming a variety of vegetables is essential for obtaining the vitamins, minerals, and antioxidants necessary to support your immune system and overall health. Eating five to nine servings of vegetables daily ensures that you are consuming various nutrients to fuel your body. This not only keeps you satiated but also reduces the risk of developing specific diseases and promoting healthy digestion. Experiment with different types of vegetables, and incorporate them into your meals in a myriad of ways to avoid monotony. **2. Opt for lean proteins** Protein plays an essential role in building and repairing tissues, as well as maintaining our energy levels. Lean proteins, such as chicken, turkey, fish, legumes, and low-fat dairy products, provide the necessary nutrients without the excess saturated fats found in high-fat meats. By focusing on lean proteins, you can enjoy the benefits of protein-rich foods while avoiding unnecessary calories and promoting a healthy weight. **3. Consider supplementing with a multivitamin containing vitamin B12 and folate** Although a well-rounded diet should provide us with all the necessary nutrients, supplementation can sometimes be helpful in filling any nutritional gaps. A multivitamin supplement with vitamin B12 and folate can be beneficial for those who struggle to consume adequate amounts of these nutrients through their diet alone. Vitamin B12 is critical for maintaining healthy nerves and blood cells, while folate plays a significant role in DNA synthesis, red blood cell production, and preventing birth defects during pregnancy. **4. Stay hydrated by drinking more water** Water is vital to our health as it aids digestion, circulation, and temperature regulation, among other essential functions. Drinking sufficient water throughout the day can prevent dehydration and its side effects, such as fatigue, dizziness, and headaches. Additionally, proper hydration is known to support skin health. Aim to drink at least 8 glasses of water daily, more if you are physically active or live in a hot climate. **5. Reduce your activity levels if needed** While physical activity is generally a cornerstone of a healthy lifestyle, it is essential to listen to your body's cues. Overexertion can lead to injuries, burnout, and a weakened immune system. It is crucial to strike the right balance between staying active and giving your body the rest it requires to recover appropriately. Adjust your activity levels accordingly, and incorporate rest days as needed. **6. Prioritize sleep** Sleep is often overlooked in our quest for a healthier lifestyle. However, adequate sleep is vital for optimal brain function, physical well-being, and emotional stability. Aim for seven to nine hours of quality sleep each night to ensure your body gets the rest it needs to recover, rejuvenate, and function optimally. In conclusion, adopting a healthier lifestyle is not about drastic changes or rigid diets. Instead, it's about making conscious choices regarding our nutrition, activity levels, and self-care. By incorporating these tips into your daily routine, you can pave the way towards greater well-being and a truly fulfilling life."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

A:","output":"Richard Löwenthal was a prominent political scientist born on April 15, 1908, in Berlin, which was then part of the German Empire. His life was dedicated to understanding and analyzing the complex world of politics, particularly focusing on the post-totalitarianism interpretation of Soviet politics. This expertise made him an important figure in political science, as his unique perspective offered significant contributions to the study of the Soviet regime. Löwenthal's early years were spent in Berlin, where he was nurtured in a vibrant and intellectually stimulating environment. As he grew older, his passion for politics and political science drove him to pursue a career in this field, eventually establishing a reputation as an insightful and astute commentator on the pressing issues of his time. One of Löwenthal's most notable accomplishments was his argument for a post-totalitarianism interpretation of Soviet politics. This interpretation emphasized the gradual evolution of the Soviet regime toward a more complex and nuanced political system, rather than remaining a rigid totalitarian structure. This perspective was groundbreaking, as it provided a fresh way to analyze the developments in Soviet politics and contributed to a deeper understanding of the forces and dynamics at play within the USSR. Throughout his illustrious career, Richard Löwenthal was not only a political scientist but also an educator, sharing his knowledge and expertise with others through teaching and mentoring. His influence reached far and wide, inspiring generations of scholars and political analysts to engage in a more nuanced understanding of the political landscape. Sadly, Richard Löwenthal passed away on August 9, 1991, in Berlin, Germany.

Pavement was an American indie rock band that formed in Stockton, California in 1989. The group mainly consisted of Stephen Malkmus (vocals and guitar), Scott Kannberg (guitar and vocals), Mark Ibold (bass), Steve West (drums) and Bob Nastanovich (percussion and vocals). Initially conceived as a recording project, the band at first avoided press or live performances, while attracting considerable underground attention with their early releases. Gradually evolving into a more polished band, Pavement recorded five full-length albums and nine EPs over the course of their decade-long career, though they disbanded with some acrimony in 1999 as the members moved on to other projects. During the Slanted & Enchanted tour, Gary Young's eccentric behavior increased, and he would stage incidents such as handing out cabbage and mashed potatoes to fans at the door of the venue, doing handstands, drunkenly falling off his drum stool, and running around the venue while the rest of the band was playing. The band only understood how severe Young's drinking problem was after Pavement's first few tours. Malkmus later told Tape Op, \\"We knew that he was like a hippie and kinda flaky, but we didn't know he had such a bad drinking problem. We found out on that tour, because he really got sick from being nervous... That's why I let Bob be in the band...'Keep the beat going if Gary passes out.'\\" In 1993, Malkmus attempted to record some new songs at Young's studio with unsuccessful results. The singer later said, \\"We kind of wanted to not record with him anymore, but we were too nice to fire people or even really talk about it... We tried to record there, but it wasn't sounding good and he didn't have his studio ready and he was also in a drinking funk.\\"  At the conclusion of a 1993 tour of Australia, Japan, and Europe, the group held a meeting in a hotel room in Copenhagen during which Malkmus, Kannberg and Ibold remained silent while Nastanovich (Young's best friend at the time) argued with the drummer and informed him that his antics were unnecessary. Young ultimately agreed to leave the band. He was replaced by Steve West, who had been a fellow museum security guard at the Whitney Museum of American Art along with Malkmus and David Berman. West's debut performance was in 1993 at a Drag City festival in Chicago. Also that same year, the band contributed to the AIDS-Benefit Album No Alternative produced by the Red Hot Organization with their song \\"Unseen Power of the Picket Fence\\".  Pavement's second album Crooked Rain, Crooked Rain was released in 1994. The record was more indebted to the classic rock tradition than their debut. The single \\"Cut Your Hair\\" was the band's closest brush with the mainstream, and briefly enjoyed airplay on alternative rock radio and MTV. Pavement performed the song on The Tonight Show with Jay Leno. The video also aired on \\"Career Day\\", a season five episode of Beavis and Butt-head, who termed it \\"buttwipe music\\" and also wanted the band to \\"try harder.\\"  The lyrics from another single from the album, \\"Range Life\\", criticized alternative rock stars The Smashing Pumpkins and the Stone Temple Pilots. Malkmus has insisted over the years that the line is meant to be light-hearted and is sung from the point of view of the aging hippie character in the song. Later live versions of the track had the singer substituting \\"The Spice Girls\\", \\"Counting Crows\\", or others for \\"Stone Temple Pilots\\". In response Smashing Pumpkins leader Billy Corgan threatened to drop his band from their slot headlining the 1994 Lollapalooza Festival if Pavement was allowed to play. Corgan and Malkmus would trade barbs through the press for several years afterwards.

Many young people end up in a job that they are not suited to do. \\"Chance\\" may play a more important part than \\"decision\\". So here are a few steps to help you think about jobs. First, it is important to recognize what kind of person you are and what special qualities make you different from everyone else. The most important thing is to know your interests and skills. But the point is that there is a difference between an interest and a skill. If you like art and enjoy looking at pictures, it is an interest. But if you can draw a horse that looks like a horse rather than a big dog, that is a skill. The best job is one that uses your skills in doing something together with your interests. As well as this,  it is an advantage if you believe that a particular job is worth doing in the world. To examine your skills and abilities still further, ask yourself this question: in the following three areas--skills with people, skills with information or skills with things -- which are your best skills? After that, the next step is research. To find out as much as possible about different kinds of work, go to the library and read books, magazines and newspapers. Ask your friends about the work they do. If you are interested in banking, it is better to talk to a bank clerk of twenty-four, rather than a bank manager of sixty-four.

Please answer the following question: This article: While travelling, Nielsen discovered and then turned against Richard Wagner's music dramas, heard many of Europe's leading orchestras and soloists and sharpened his opinions on both music and the visual arts. Although he revered the music of Bach and Mozart, he remained ambivalent about much 19th-century music. In 1891 he met the composer and pianist Ferruccio Busoni in Leipzig; they were to maintain a correspondence for over thirty years. Shortly after arriving in Paris in early March 1891 Nielsen met the Danish sculptor Anne Marie Brodersen, who was also travelling on a scholarship. They toured Italy together and married in St Mark's English Church, Florence, on 10 May 1891 before returning to Denmark. According to Fanning, their relationship was not only a \\"love match\\", but also a \\"meeting of minds\\"; Anne Marie was a gifted artist and a \\"strong-willed and modern-minded woman, determined to forge her own career\\". This determination would strain the Nielsens' marriage, as Anne Marie would spend months away from home during the 1890s and 1900s, leaving Carl, who was susceptible to opportunities with other ladies, to raise their three young children in addition to composing and fulfilling his duties at the Royal Theatre.Nielsen sublimated his anger and frustration over his marriage in a number of musical works, most notably between 1897 and 1904, a period which he sometimes called his \\"psychological\\" period. Fanning writes, \\"At this time his interest in the driving forces behind human personality crystallized in the opera Saul and David and the Second Symphony (The Four Temperaments) and the cantatas Hymnus amoris and Søvnen\\". Carl suggested divorce in March 1905 and had considered moving to Germany for a fresh start, but despite several extended periods of separation the Nielsens remained married for the remainder of the composer's life.Nielsen had five children, two of them illegitimate. He had already fathered a son, Carl August Nielsen, in January 1888, before he met Anne Marie.

Options: - juggling - trees - chess set - flying - castle  Explain why a human would choose \\"castle\\" to answer the question above: A:","output":"A human would choose \\"castle\\" to answer the question above for the following reasons: 1. The question is related to a rook, which is a piece in the game of chess. This eliminates juggling, trees, and flying as suitable options, as they are not directly related to chess or the rook piece. 2. The remaining options are 'chess set' and 'castle'. Although a rook is a part of a chess set, the question is looking for a name that a child might mistakenly use for a rook. This means that 'chess set' doesn't fit as a suitable answer. 3. The rook is often depicted as a small tower or fortress in most chess sets, and it resembles a castle in shape and design. When a child looks at the rook, they might associate its appearance with a castle and, hence, call it that. Therefore, a human would choose \\"castle\\" as the best explanation to answer the question, because children might mistakenly call a rook a \\"castle\\" due to its resemblance to one."},{"instruction":"Read the following article and select the best answer.

Write an article using the following points: The man, 30, was missing when police arrested 10 suspects in December. Police: He was part of an alleged ring that stole passports in Spain and sent them to Thailand. The passports were forged in Thailand and supplied to groups linked to al Qaeda. Article:","output":"Title: Missing 30-Year-Old Man Found To Be Part of International Passport Counterfeiting Ring Linked to al Qaeda Introduction: In a shocking revelation, a 30-year-old man, who went missing when police arrested 10 individuals in December, has been found to be a member of an international counterfeiting ring. This alleged ring has been accused of stealing passports in Spain and sending them to Thailand. Once in Thailand, the passports were forged and later distributed to groups with links to terrorist organization al Qaeda. (Step 1: Present the main findings from the given points in a concise and structured manner. The aim is to provide the reader with a clear understanding of the topic at hand.) The Discovery: The man, whose identity has not been released, eluded arrest when the police apprehended the 10 suspects involved in the operation last December. Thanks to the ongoing investigation by the Spanish authorities, he was eventually tracked down and subsequently arrested. Preliminary reports suggest that the accused was a key player in the passport theft ring, which targeted unsuspecting Spanish citizens and stole their passports. (Step 2: Elaborate on the discovery and provide additional context to the given points, such as the anonymous identity of the 30-year-old man and the nature of his role in the counterfeiting ring.) The Modus Operandi: The stolen passports were shipped to Thailand, where they were expertly forged and altered to make them suitable for use by individuals reportedly linked to al Qaeda. The forged passports were then dispatched to various terrorist cells around the globe, enabling these individuals to evade detection and execute their nefarious activities without raising any suspicions. (Step 3: Explain how the stolen passports were used, processed, and distributed as forged documents that facilitated the activities of groups connected to al Qaeda.) International Cooperation: This particular case highlights the importance of international partnerships and intelligence-sharing in combating global terrorism and illegal activities. In a joint effort against criminally-run operations, such as this counterfeiting ring, law enforcement agencies from several countries have been collaborating to track down and dismantle the network, prevent the distribution of forged passports, and apprehend the criminals involved. (Step 4: Emphasize the significance of global cooperation and the role it plays in tackling and eliminating criminal activities that might contribute to terrorism.) Conclusion: This case serves as a stark reminder of the intricate web of illegal activities and networks that support terrorism worldwide. It underscores the urgency in strengthening international security measures and intelligence-sharing in order to thwart terrorists and their facilitators. As countries fight against terrorism and strive to ensure public safety, it has become increasingly important to pay attention to the seemingly innocuous criminal operations that might feed and strengthen larger, more dangerous organizations. (Step 5: Reiterate the main points of the article and provide closing thoughts on the significance of the counterfeiting ring's exposure, highlighting the need for continued vigilance and international cooperation in combatting terrorism.)"},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant, who knows every language and how to translate one language to another.

Some people will tell you to wait 3 days before you text someone when you get their number. However, after that much time, they might think you’re not interested. Instead of playing games, text the person as soon as you feel like it. That will show them that you’re already thinking of them, and they may be attracted to your straightforward approach. However, do avoid texting anyone too late at night or too early in the morning. You might wake them up, which they probably won’t appreciate. When you’re talking to your crush, you want them to know how thoughtful and clever you are. Using a lot of abbreviations, acronyms, and internet slang might make you seem unoriginal, and they can make your texts hard to read. Try sticking to regular spelling and correct grammar, instead.  Sprinkling a few acronyms into your texts is fine. For instance, “OMG I have to tell you something!” is fine, whereas, “OMG u rnt going 2 believe what I heard” probably isn’t going to win your crush’s heart. Read your texts before you send them to try to catch any typos, as well. When you’re first texting someone you like, don’t weigh them down with all the problems in your life. Instead, keep your texts positive, clever, or funny. That will show your crush that you’re a positive person who’s fun to be around.  For instance, you might send your crush jokes, cute stories about your day, or funny memes you come across. Avoid too much sarcasm, since it might not come across the right way in a text. Over time, you can gradually open up to your crush, especially if you see them doing the same thing. When you like someone, it can be tempting to read into every text they send you, looking for any sign of how they feel. However, the best way to know for sure whether your crush likes you is just to spend time talking to them. It will become clear in time, so just relax and have fun, and let things develop naturally. For instance, just because your crush sends you short texts doesn’t necessarily mean they’re mad at you or that they don’t like you. They may just be busy. If you’re constantly sending long blocks of texts and your crush is only sending you back short texts (or not texting you back at all), they’re probably busy, and they might get aggravated if you keep blowing up their phone. You don’t have to send exactly 1 message for every 1 message they send, but do try to keep it to a close ratio. Don’t text the person to ask them why they’re not texting you. That can come across as desperate or pushy. If they’re not answering, give them some space. If your crush is always the one who has to say goodbye first, they might start to feel like you like them more than they like you. Give them a chance to miss you by ending the conversation a little earlier than they expect. If you’re ending the conversation because you have somewhere to go, make sure to mention that so they know you have a busy, well-rounded life! Leave your crush hanging by saying something like, \\"Oh, remind me tomorrow to tell you about my job interview!\\" Summary:","output":"When texting someone you're interested in, remember to be straightforward and text them when you feel like it, rather than waiting for a certain amount of time to pass. Keep your messages positive, clever, or funny, and avoid using too many abbreviations or internet slang. Don't overanalyze their texts, and give them space if they're not responding promptly. Maintain a balanced conversation and occasionally be the one to end the conversation first, so they have a chance to miss you.

Daher begrüße ich heute die durch Ehrgeiz gekennzeichnete Abstimmung über den Bericht Lucas, der ein ganzes Maßnahmenpaket zur Bekämpfung der Umweltauswirkungen der Luftfahrt vorsieht, unter anderem insbesondere die Abschaffung der Befreiung von der Mehrwertsteuer auf Treibstoff für den Luftverkehr. Translate to English English:","output":"Today, I welcome the ambitious vote on the Lucas report, which proposes a comprehensive package of measures to combat the environmental impact of aviation, including in particular the abolition of the exemption from value-added tax on aviation fuel. The Lucas report, named after its initiator, addresses the urgent need to mitigate the environmental repercussions of aviation, which has experienced significant growth over recent years. This growth has resulted in notable consequences such as increased greenhouse gas emissions, noise pollution near airports, and threats to biodiversity. To tackle these negative impacts, the Lucas report suggests a broad range of actions that can be implemented by relevant parties, including governments, aviation companies, and regulatory bodies. One key proposal within the report is the abolition of the value-added tax (VAT) exemption on aviation fuel. Currently, aviation fuel is exempt from tax in many countries, which allows the industry to maintain low prices and offers little incentive to reduce consumption or invest in cleaner alternatives. The Lucas report posits that removing this exemption will promote the development of more environmentally friendly fuels and technologies, as well as even out the playing field for other forms of transportation that are subject to taxes on their fuels. In addition to the VAT adjustment on aviation fuel, the Lucas report does not shy away from presenting further impactful measures. These include: 1. The imposition of a tax on frequent flyer programs to deter excessive air travel and encourage more sustainable transportation choices. 2. The implementation of a carbon pricing mechanism for the aviation industry to internalize the cost of emissions and create an incentive for airlines to reduce their carbon footprint. 3. The introduction of tighter emission standards for new aircraft and retrofitting measures for existing fleets to promote greater fuel efficiency and reduce pollution. 4. The allocation of funds for research and development on innovative technologies and alternative fuels with lower environmental impacts. 5. The harmonization of regulations and standards at the international level to ensure more consistent and effective action against aviation's negative environmental consequences across the globe. The ambitious vote on the Lucas report reflects a growing recognition of the urgent need to address the environmental challenges posed by the aviation industry. By adopting a comprehensive package of measures, which includes the abolition of VAT exemption on aviation fuel, the report illustrates a strong commitment to taking positive steps towards a more sustainable and environmentally-conscious future for air transportation."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

If another ship does not come and help them and they do not have enough food or water, they will die. Most people believe we must not drink sea water. They believe that if we do, we shall be very ill because of all the salt in the water. A doctor called Alain Bombard did not believe this. He thought that people could stay alive by drinking sea water and eating small fish, animals and plants from the sea. On 19 October 1953, he set out in a small boat to cross the Atlantic Ocean . He did not take any food or water with him. Every day Dr. Bombard drank just a little sea water. He also caught fish and they had water in them. He drank this water. He could not cook the fish, so he ate them as they were. He took small plants from the sea, which gave him more food. Dr. Bombard became hot, tired and quite ill, but after 65days at sea he was still alive.

Nearly a year after Sept. 11, the Legal Aid Society-the lawyers for New York's poor and homeless-remains, well, homeless. The nonprofit has been barred from returning to its 90 Church St. headquarters, across from the World Trade Center site, because of environmental concerns. Legal Aid has uncomfortable company. More than 11,500 New Yorkers continue to work out of temporary space, according to analysis by Manhattan-based real estate brokerage TenantWise.com Inc. and Crain's New York Business. That's 8% of the 137,000 workers who lost their offices or access to them when the Twin Towers collapsed. Legal Aid's 450 displaced attorneys and staffers have spent the past 12 months spread among previously unused spaces-some unused for good reason-in the nonprofit's other offices. It could be another year and a half before they return to their old desks. They have contended with difficult working conditions as demand for Legal Aid's services is on the rise because of Sept. 11 and the deteriorating economy.

Article: The works of Shakespeare and Wordsworth are boosters to the brain and better therapy than some guide books, researchers say this week. Scientists, psychologists and English academics at Liverpool University have found that reading the works of the Bard and other classical writers has a beneficial effect on the mind, catches the reader's attention and triggers moments of self-reflection. Using scanners  , they monitored the brain activity of volunteers as they read works by William Shakespeare, William Wordsworth, T.S Eliot and others. They then \\"translated\\" the original texts into more \\"straightforward\\", modern language and again monitored the readers' brains as they read the words. Scans showed that the more \\"challenging\\" essays and poetry set off far more electrical activity in the brain than the much plainer versions. Scientists were able to study the brain activity as it responded to each word and record how it was \\"activated\\" as the readers encountered unusual words, surprising phrases or difficult sentence structure. This \\"activation\\" of the mind lasts longer, shifting the brain to a higher speed, encouraging further reading. The research also found that reading poetry, in particular, increases activity in the right hemisphere of the brain, helping the reader to reflect on their own experiences, which they compare with what they have read. This, according to the researchers, meant that the classic works were more useful than guide books. Philip Davis, an English professor believes \\"The research shows the power of literature to shift thinking patterns, to create new thoughts, shapes and connections in the young and adults alike.\\" Question: What is the possible benefit of reading classic works according to the study?

The regions or provinces where \\"beys\\" ruled or which they administered were called \\"beylik\\", roughly meaning \\"khanate\\", \\"emirate\\" or \\"principality\\" in the first case, \\"province\\" or \\"governorate\\" in the second (the equivalent of duchy in other parts of Europe). Today, the word is still used informally as a social title for men (somewhat like the English word \\"mister\\" and the French word \\"monsieur\\", which literally means \\"my lord\\"). Unlike \\"mister\\" however, it follows the name and is used generally with first names and not with last names.  - Anatolia (from Greek , '  \\"east\\" or \\"(sun)rise\\"; in modern ), in geography known as Asia Minor (from '  \\"small Asia\\"; in modern ), Asian Turkey, Anatolian peninsula, or Anatolian plateau, is the westernmost protrusion of Asia, which makes up the majority of modern-day Turkey. The region is bounded by the Black Sea to the north, the Mediterranean Sea to the south, and the Aegean Sea to the west. The Sea of Marmara forms a connection between the Black and Aegean Seas through the Bosphorus and Dardanelles straits and separates Anatolia from Thrace on the European mainland.  - Begum, begam, baigum or beygum (, ) is a female royal and aristocratic title from Central and South Asia. It is the feminine equivalent of the title \\"baig\\" or \\"bey\\", which in Turkic languages means \\"higher official\\". It usually refers to the wife or daughter of a \\"beg\\". The related form \\"begzadi\\" (daughter of a \\"beg\\") also occurs.  - Malhun Hatun (died November 1323, other names \\"Mal Hatun, Mala Hatun, Kameriye Sultana\\") was the first wife of Osman I, the leader of the Ottoman Turks and the founder of the dynasty that established and ruled the Ottoman Empire. She was the mother of the next and second ruler of the Ottoman State, Orhan. Biography. It has been recognized by many historians that she was the daughter of the Anatolian Turkish Bey, \\"Ömer Bey\\", although there had been some speculations that she was the daughter of Sheikh Edebali. Other sources say that she was the daughter of Ömer Abdülaziz Bey, Seljuk vizier of Anatolia.  - Erturul (Erorl; often with the title \\"Gazi\\") (died c. 1280) was the father of Osman I, the founder of the Ottoman Empire. While his historicity is proven by coins minted by Osman I which identify Erturul as the name of his father, nothing else is known for certain about his life or activities. According to Ottoman tradition, he was the son of Suleyman Shah, leader of the Kay tribe of Oghuz Turks, who fled from eastern Iran to Anatolia to escape the Mongol Conquests. According to this legend, after the death of his father, Erturul and his followers entered the service of the Seljuks of Rum, for which he was rewarded with dominion over the town of Söüt on the frontier with the Byzantine Empire. This set off the chain of events that would ultimately lead to the founding of the Ottoman Empire. Like his son, Osman, and their future descendants, Erturul is often referred to as a \\"Ghazi\\", a heroic champion fighter for the cause of Islam.  - Orhan Ghazi ben Osman ( Ottoman Turkish :    , Turkish : Orhan Gazi ; 1281 -- March 1362 ) was the second bey of the nascent Ottoman Empire ( then known as the Ottoman Beylik or Emirate ) from 1326 to 1362 . He was born in Söüt , the son of Osman I and Malhun Hatun . His grandfather was Erturul , and his grandmother was Halime Sultan . In the early stages of his reign , Orhan focused his energies on conquering most of northwestern Anatolia . The majority of these areas were under Byzantine rule and he won his first battle , at Pelekanon , against the Byzantine Emperor Andronikos III Palaiologos . Orhan also occupied the lands of the Karasids of Balkesir and the Ahis of Ankara . A series of civil wars surrounding the ascension of the nine - year - old emperor John V Palaiologos benefited Orhan greatly . In the Byzantine civil war of 1341 -- 1347 , the regent John VI Kantakouzenos married his daughter Theodora to Orhan and employed Ottoman warriors against the rival forces of the queen dowager , allowing them to loot Thrace . In the Byzantine civil war of 1352 -- 1357 , Kantakouzenos used Ottoman forces against John V himself , granting them the use of a European fortress at Çimpe around 1352 . A major earthquake devastated Gallipoli ( modern Gelibolu ) two years later and Orhan 's son Süleyman Pasha occupied the town , giving the Ottomans a strong bridgehead into mainland Europe .  - The Oghuz, Oguz or Ghuzz Turks were a western Turkic people who spoke the Oghuz languages from the Common sub-division of Turkic language family. In the 8th century, they formed a tribal confederation conventionally named the Oghuz Yabgu State in central Asia. The name \\"Oghuz\\" is a Common Turkic word for \\"tribe\\". Byzantine sources call the Oghuz the Uzes (, \\"Ouzoi\\"). By the 10th century, Islamic sources were calling the Muslim, as opposed to shamanist or Christian, Oghuz the Turkmens. By the 12th century this term had passed into Byzantine usage and the Oghuzes were overwhelmingly Muslim.

Q:Given the background: Retinitis is inflammation of the retina in the eye, which can permanently damage the retina and lead to blindness. The retina is the part of your eye that is also known as the \\"sensing tissue.\\" Retinitis may be caused by a number of different infectious agents. Retinitis, also called Retinitis pigmentosa, has a prevalence of one in every 2,500-7,000 people. This condition is one of the leading causes that leads to blindness in patients in the age range of 20–60 years old.  and the situation: Local hospital has launched a program to check if a patient has Retinitis. Resident ophthalmologist David is in charge of this program. In the first day of the program he checked two patients, patient A and patient B. The test result showed that patient A had Retinitis, but patient B did not have Retinitis. Then next day  David checked two other patients, patient C and patient D. Patient C was 40 years old, but patient D was 80 years old. He found both patient C and D had Retinitis.  Answer the following question: For which patient Retinitis will not be one of the leading causes of blindness, patient C or patient D? A:","output":"To answer the question, I need to identify for which patient Retinitis will not be one of the leading causes of blindness. Here are the steps I take to determine this: Step 1: Review the background information on Retinitis. Based on the background information provided, Retinitis is one of the leading causes of blindness in patients between the ages of 20 and 60. Step 2: Analyze the provided information on patient C and patient D. Patient C is 40 years old and has Retinitis. Patient D is 80 years old and has Retinitis. Step 3: Decide the relevance of the background information to patient C and patient D. Patient C is within the age range of 20-60 years, so Retinitis is considered one of the leading causes of blindness for them. Patient D is older than the age range mentioned (80 years old), so it is less likely that Retinitis is one of the leading causes of their blindness. Based on the analysis, Retinitis is not one of the leading causes of blindness for patient D because they fall outside the age range provided in the background information."},{"instruction":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

You must generate a detailed and long answer. Summarize the following: You should never bribe a child to get them to do what you want. This teaches them a terrible behavior, which is that listening to you is negotiable. There will be many times when the temptation is strong but you should do whatever you can not to give in. Sometimes this means letting your child throw a tantrum in a grocery store and that's okay. The other customers will have a rough few minutes and go on with their lives but your child will learn good behavior for a lifetime. For example, when they throw a fit in the store about wanting a candy bar, don't say that they can have cake when they get home if they stop crying. All this does is teach them that if they cry at the store, they'll quickly earn themselves a treat. When your child does do something bad, do not give them attention for that behavior. This teaches them that in order to get your attention, they need to be naughty. Instead of acknowledging this behavior, even to yell at them, ignore them. When paired with hugs, kisses, and attention for good behavior, your child will quickly learn to behave.  A bad example would be: grabbing their hands and yelling at them for doing something wrong or making them sit next to you for misbehaving at church. Instead, completely ignore them when they start throwing a tantrum. If you're at home put them in another room and then close the door. It doesn't need to be locked or slammed, it just needs to break contact. This will show the child that yelling is not the way to get your attention. Remember that to your toddler, the world is very big and pretty much 24/7 stress. Imagine how you feel when your boss makes a major change to how things work in your office. Now multiply that times thirty and imagine it happening every day for years. That's what it's like for your toddler. You have to be understanding and try not to overwhelm them with too many changes at once.  Introduce schedule, lifestyle, and home changes gradually. You should also try to keep to a routine. When you have a routine, your child knows what to expect as is better able to handle small and gradual changes, like learning to use the toilet. For example, don't start potty training the same week they start at a new pre-school. In fact, waiting as much as a month before making another change can be necessary. Wait until they seem comfortable with one change before making another. If you have older children, you may be frustrated that your toddler doesn't do what the older child does or did. However, it's important to remember that your toddler hasn't learned those behaviors yet and won't be ready for them for awhile. Be ready to accommodate and work with their individual needs. For example, your toddler will probably need to have a different bedtime routine than an older child. They will probably wake up earlier and should not be expected to quietly entertain themselves on a weekend morning while you try to sleep in. Another common trigger for tantrums in toddlers are issues with stimulation. When they get bored, they don't have the mental ability that adults do to keep themselves entertained. Be understanding of this and try to find ways to keep them stimulated while you're out and away from the toys that usually keep them occupied.  Keep a favored toy only for boredom emergencies, when you know you're both going to be stuck for awhile. This will keep your child entertained. You want to avoid making them overstimulated too. Too much stimulation, especially right before bed, can be a bit much for them and lead to breakdowns. Having a bunch of your friends over, making a major scheduling change, or even letting them watch TV can leave your little one feeling lost.","output":"Bribing a child to comply with your wishes is not a recommended parenting practice, as it teaches the child that your authority is negotiable and promotes negative behavior. Avoid giving into the temptation to bribe, even when faced with tantrums in public places. Instead of acknowledging or rewarding bad behavior, focus on providing affection and attention for good behavior, which will help guide the child in the right direction. Ignoring tantrums and not reinforcing negative behavior will teach the child that acting out will not get them the attention they seek. When at home, it's helpful to separate them from the situation briefly by placing them in another room, emphasizing that their disruptive behavior will not yield any response from you. Toddlers experience constant changes and stressors in their lives, making it crucial for parents to be understanding and patient. Introducing changes gradually, maintaining a routine, and accommodating their individual needs will help them cope better. In addition, avoid comparing them with older siblings, as toddlers are still learning behaviors and may not be ready for certain expectations. When dealing with stimulation issues for toddlers, strike a balance between preventing boredom and avoiding over-stimulation. Carry a favorite toy for emergency situations when the child might feel bored, but also be mindful of reducing exposure to high-energy activities and chaotic environments that could lead to meltdowns. In summary, effective parenting means avoiding using bribes and promoting good behavior with affection and attention. Ignoring negative behavior, being patient with changes, accommodating the child's individual needs, and regulating stimulation will contribute to their overall development and help them learn to behave in a manner that's beneficial to both the child and the parent."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

To justify my response:  1. Extensive historical records support this claim. It's established knowledge within the domain of geography and history.  2. Vasco da Gama led the first expedition that sailed directly from Europe to India, departing from Portugal in 1497 and reaching Calicut (now Kozhikode) in India in 1498. 3. This was a significant discovery because it linked Europe and Asia by an ocean route, connecting the Atlantic and the Indian oceans and therefore, the West and the Orient. It was crucial for trade and cultural exchange. 4. This happened during the Age of Discovery, a period in history when Europeans significantly expanded their understanding of the world through maritime exploration.

In one sentence, describe what the following article is about: You shouldn't feel pressured to bulk up a survey with questions. The more questions you ask, the less likely it is that a customer will finish the survey. As a rule of thumb, ask no more than 10 questions, and preferably fewer. For example, you might only want to know someone's overall experience. In that situation, you can simply ask, “Please rate your overall experience on a scale of 1 to 10, with 1 being the worst and 10 the best.” You can glean more information from a customer if you ask questions that can't be answered with a “yes” or “no.” For example, don't ask, “Were you happy with your experience?” Instead, you can ask, “What would you change about our business to improve it?” The second question can't be answered with a \\"yes\\" or \\"no.\\" If you use open-ended questions, you must decide where to put them. Some experts suggest putting them at the front of the survey so they are answered first. However, recent research suggests that open-ended questions can make a customer more positive than they normally would be when filling out the rest of the survey. Accordingly, you might want to put them at the end. You'll only waste people's time if you ask a bunch of irrelevant questions. Instead, you can segment your customer base. For example, you don't need to ask recent customers their opinions about your customer support, since they probably haven't used support yet.  Segment your customer base any way you want. For example, if you offer many different services, you can segment them based on the service they use. Alternately, you can segment customers based on how long they have done business with you. One reason so few people offer feedback is that they don't really think you care. However, you should assure customers that you will respond promptly if they have a problem. Write, “We will respond ASAP to any concerns.” Remember to follow through.

The audience is provided with an insight into the world of the opening section's primary characters while concurrently observing the public re-emergence of a psychic, Simon Silver (Robert De Niro). The ending of the film's first half is signified by the sudden death of Matheson from a chronic vascular condition at the same time that one of Silver's comeback performances takes place; an incident that is particularly significant due to the death of a former nemesis of Silver, a skeptic who investigated the psychic's work, under similar circumstances. Matheson also had a previous encounter with Silver. She recounted a public meeting when Silver had, for an instant, got the best of her by bringing up the subject of her son's spirit (her son was in a vegetative coma and on life support). Matheson agrees only to appear on a televised panel in anticipation of Silver's return. Prior to her death, Matheson refuses to co-operate with Buckley's insistent call to undertake another investigation of Silver, warning Buckley against such an undertaking due to her previous experience with the psychic. However, following Matheson's death, the assistant becomes increasingly obsessed with investigating Silver for the purpose of exposing the popular psychic as a fraud. During Buckley's efforts to reveal Silver's large-scale trickery, a series of inexplicable events occurs â electronic devices explode, dead birds appear, and Buckley's laboratory is vandalised. Buckley's paranoia intensifies, as he believes Silver is behind these incidents.

Anand and Sujata Kumar, from New Jersey, are suing the Taney Youth Baseball Association. They couple filed a lawsuit last week claiming Mr Kumar, 73, was injured on May 18 last year as they watched their grandson play at Trolley Works Field. Taney Dragons' Mo'ne Davis pitches to a Nevada batter during a Little League World Series game at Lamade Stadium on August 20 in South Williamsport, Pennsylvania.

The couple say the association should not have allowed players to practice near the stands. The lawsuit states the incident occurred during a 'game of toss and catch' between two boys who who were practising outside the fence and 'negligently close' to the stands. The Philadelphia Daily News first reported the lawsuit on Tuesday, saying the incident left Mr Kumar 'disabled and disordered'.

Please write a short summary for the following article: Illegal immigrants working in UK face six months in prison, ministers announce It means that instead of being taken to detention centres, illegal migrants will be processed through the courts before being taken to jail. Ministers believe it will act as a deterrent and prevent thousands of migrants attempting to gain access to the UK from European ports including Calais. • If Britain bends to pressure, where would we put a quota of migrants? • Couple wed for 45 years claim immigration officials do not believe marriage is genuine As part of the new measures, off-licences, curry houses, Chinese restaurants and other takeaway firms will face closure if they are found to be employing illegal workers. The Government will also consider extending these powers to cover minicab firms, the Home Office said. It came as Eurotunnel services were on Monday hit by serious delays after migrants were found on French rail track near Calais. Migrants in France Photo: AFP Trains were held up by an hour after the migrants went on to the track in the area around Frethun station. Mr Brokenshire said: “Anyone who thinks the UK is a soft touch should be in no doubt – if you are here illegally, we will take action to stop you from working, renting a flat, opening a bank account or driving a car.” He added: “Through our new Immigration Bill, illegal workers will face the prospect of a prison term and rogue employers could have their businesses closed, have their licences removed, or face prosecution if they continue to flout the law.” The decision to impose prison sentences on illegal immigrants is a major shift in Government policy and shows the level of concern in Downing Street about the influx of foreigners coming to the UK. In the weeks after the general election, David Cameron vowed to make the UK a “less attractive place to come and work”. He announced plans to allow the police to seize wages from foreign workers and said that they would face deportation without appeal if they are in the UK illegally. However, he made no mention of potential prison sentences. It is thought that the migrant crisis in southern Europe and well as the increasing numbers of foreigners attempting to reach the UK from Calais have forced ministers to intensify the planned crackdown. Under the new rules, any employer suspected of flouting immigration laws could see their business closed for up to 48 hours while they prove right to work checks have been conducted on staff.

The Home Office said that any pub, off-licence or late-night takeaway that fails to comply with immigration laws or employs illegal workers could also be stripped of their licence to operate. Summary:","output":"The government in the UK has announced that illegal immigrants working in the country could face six months in prison.

Deeply affected by the insult and a feeling of rootlessness, he decides to go back to the land of rajput where his true rajput lineage will be respected. While on an aimless journey, Narasingh is picked up by Sukharam who is a local Marwari businessman with a record of smuggling and human trafficking. Sukharam (Charuprakash Ghosh) offers him a handsome fee to transport some goods which actually is opium. The realisation of the immoral trade puts Narshing in a compromising position, but he decides to join hands with Sukharam anyway. After all no one he saw was truly following the path of law and morality, not even his ideal and beloved Neeli (Ruma Guha Thakurta). Neeli runs away with the crippled lover of hers and Narasingh's deep distrust of women deepens. As a result, even after knowing that Gulabi is a victim of Sukharams trafficking he forces her to sleep with him without any emotional involvement. At this point he is almost on the verge of becoming the one he used to hate, the lawless ones who also fail to face the world. Gulabi (Waheeda Rehman), on the other hand is a melancholy, demonstrative and beautiful village widow. Gulabi is instinctively drawn to Narsingh. In spite of losing her dignity, she still looks at the bright side of life and has trust that Narshing is not immoral. She is attracted to him from the...

By Darren Boyle An elephant which appeared in Oliver Stone's epic movie Alexander has been killed by poachers in Thailand.. The 50-year-old elephant was poisoned by poachers who then sawed-off its tusks at the Ayutthaya Elephant Palace. As well as appearing in the movie starring Colin Farrell and Angelina Jolie the elephant named Klao was found dead yesterday at the nature reserve. The elephant was found on Friday at the Ayutthaya Elephant Palace after it was attacked by ivory poachers The elephant was worth £70,000 according to local media reports. The Bangkok Post reported that Thai police arrested one man who is believed to be a drug addict in connection with the crime. Staff at the","output":"Ayutthaya Elephant Palace were devastated by the loss of Klao, who had been an integral part of their family for many years. Klao had not only captured the hearts of millions through his role in Oliver Stone's movie but had also served as a gentle ambassador for the conservation of Asian elephants – a species facing significant threats from habitat loss, human-wildlife conflict, and poaching for their ivory tusks. Upon discovering Klao's lifeless body, the caretakers notified local authorities, who immediately launched an investigation into the heinous crime. The rapid arrest of the suspect, a drug addict, sheds light on the desperate measures to which individuals looking to fund their habits may resort. In addition, this incident highlights the ongoing battle against illegal wildlife trade that threatens the survival of many endangered species. In response to this tragedy, authorities and conservation organizations called for an increase in anti-poaching efforts and better protection measures for elephants in the region. They demanded enhanced funding and resources for park rangers and wildlife protection units, as well as the strengthening of legal frameworks to tackle wildlife crimes more effectively. Furthermore, they urged for educational campaigns to raise awareness of the plight of Asian elephants, highlighting the negative impact of the ivory trade on both wildlife and local communities. To honor Klao's memory, the Ayutthaya Elephant Palace organized a memorial service, attended by the staff, local residents, and representatives from various conservation organizations. Visitors who had encountered Klao on their trips to the reserve shared their cherished memories of him, recalling his majestic presence and gentle nature. A tribute was also paid to Klao and other elephants tragically lost to poaching in the form of a touching video montage. In the wake of Klao's death, the Ayutthaya Elephant Palace and its partners in conservation worked tirelessly to combat the illegal wildlife trade, ensuring that no elephants in their care would suffer a similar fate. They also pledged to continue spreading awareness about the need for effective conservation measures and the importance of responsible ecotourism. Klao's legacy will live on through the collective efforts of the Ayutthaya Elephant Palace, the wider community, and the many people who were touched by his life. His story serves as a stark reminder of the urgent need to protect and preserve the dwindling populations of Asian elephants and other endangered species in the face of ongoing threats such as habitat destruction and the illegal wildlife trade. Through a combination of increased public awareness, effective policy and law enforcement, and conservation initiatives, Klao's memory will continue to inspire action toward a more sustainable future for these magnificent creatures and their fragile ecosystems."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Atherosclerosis is a disorder of the arteries in which cholesterol and other materials are deposited on the interior of the arterial wall. These deposits lead to the formation of plaques that can restrict or even block the flow of blood through these blood vessels (see Figure below ). A decrease in the flow of blood can lead to high blood pressure and a lowered oxygen supply to the heart muscle. A complete blockage of blood flow to parts of the heart (a heart attack) can cause significant damage due to oxygen deprivation, in some cases leading to death.  Two teams of researchers studied different diseases. team Alpha studied people with cholesterol, while team Beta studied people with Parkinson's disease.  Which team studied more people with cholesterol and other materials deposited on the interior of the arterial wall? A:","output":"Team Alpha studied more people with cholesterol and other materials deposited on the interior of the arterial wall. This is because their research specifically focused on individuals with cholesterol-related issues, which are directly linked to the development of atherosclerosis, as described in the given information. Atherosclerosis involves the buildup of cholesterol deposits and other materials on the arterial wall, forming plaque that can restrict or block blood flow. This can lead to high blood pressure, reduced oxygen supply to the heart, and potentially severe consequences like heart attacks and death. On the other hand, Team Beta studied people with Parkinson's disease, which is a neurological disorder that primarily affects movement and coordination. Although Parkinson's disease might have some overlapping risk factors with cardiovascular diseases, its primary focus is not on cholesterol or atherosclerosis.

Write highlights for this article: After Marco Rubio won his inaugural Senate race in 2010 in Florida, he became the latest star of the Republican Party. The young, insurgent candidate was so impressive, talk of a presidential future quickly ensued. He entered the Senate with high expectations, having won his race with the support of the new tea party movement while simultaneously appealing to mainstream conservatives. But his journey has not been without roadblocks. Leadership on controversial topics has slowed his rise. Now, Rubio, 43, is working to right his perceived wrongs and shed his stereotypes as takes up the mantle once adorned by doing the work to launch a presidential run. Boosting his presence. The freshman senator is doing all the things necessary to make himself known. He's traveling to early presidential nominating states, heading overseas to beef up his foreign policy credentials, appearing on national TV to boost his name recognition and formulating policy ideas to demonstrate substance. On Wednesday, he delivered a \\"major address\\" on economic mobility and challenges facing the middle class. Little new came from it. It was a culmination of previously announced ideas and legislation he's already introduced this year and weaved in personal stories of childhood poverty as the son of Cuban immigrants and accounts of people struggling to make it in the middle class. \\"Too  many are starting to believe the American Dream is no longer possible for people like them,\\" he said. Alex Conant, Rubio's spokesman, said the senator has been developing these ideas \\"for months,\\" since the 50th anniversary of the War on Poverty earlier this year. It's a comprehensive speech but one that could be delivered on the floor of the Senate, a place where any of the 100 members go to offer their policy prescriptions. Instead, Rubio's speech was aimed at garnering as much attention and clout as possible. In an attempt to appeal to the right, he spoke a few blocks from Capitol Hill at conservative Hillsdale College, which stresses the teaching of \\"constitutional principles.\\" A coordinated media campaign that includes post-speech interviews is geared toward bolstering the significance of the speech. An alternative. Rubio's efforts to raise his profile and prove his substance is also an effort at differentiating himself from Democrats. His economic address comes the same week that President Barack Obama's summit on working families and the Clinton Global Initiative conference in Colorado that focused on jobs and the economy. It was attended by former secretary of state and potential Democratic presidential candidate Hillary Clinton. Hillary Clinton on wealth missteps: 'My record speaks for itself' Rubio's address contrasted the ideas they presented and, instead, took up themes Democrats have largely rejected, including a private option for Medicare and gradually raising the retirement age for Social Security. They are popular ideas within the Republican Party that would arguably save federal dollars. On jobs and economic mobility, Rubio detailed his ideas that include tax reform and tax credits for mothers obtaining an education and income-based student loan payments. He also backed a reduction of regulations and taxes and the repeal of Obamacare that he says prohibits employers from hiring, a far different platform from his Democratic counterparts. Kevin Madden, a former adviser to 2012 presidential candidate Mitt Romney, said Rubio is trying to fill a void. \\"He recognizes the Republican Party is very hungry for leaders who want to serve as a counterpoint to President Obama on the big policy issues,\\" he said. To beef up his foreign policy resume, the member of the Foreign Relations Committee has put himself out front on related matters. He appeared on the Sunday talk shows to discuss the U.S. response to the chaos in Iraq where he backed air strikes, a position Obama hasn't pursued. A crowded field. But to get where he'll contrast his ideas against a Democratic presidential candidate, he needs to differentiate himself from his fellow Republicans. Rubio is doing what other potential presidential candidates have done. Sen. Rand Paul has delivered numerous policy speeches throughout the country; Gov. Chris Christie has been active outside New Jersey in his role as head of the Republican Governors Association; former Florida Governor Jeb Bush has begun strategically appearing at national conferences. They, and a dozen other potential candidates, have also traveled to early nominating states of Iowa, New Hampshire, South Carolina and Nevada. Rand Paul: Will his star continue to rise? There lies the problem: Rubio is just one of many climbers trying to reach the same summit. As many as four governors, three senators, a former senator and two former governors are contemplating a 2016 run. Rubio faces a difficult slog to rise above the noise that the Republican race is already making. In a June CNN poll, Rubio pulled 8% among potential GOP presidential candidates. His support is low, but he fell smack in the middle of the large pack and not much worse than the most popular potential candidate, Paul, who garnered 14%. In a fractured Republican Party that consists of social conservatives, fiscal conservatives, tea party activists and pragmatists, Rubio will have to find his niche. Rubio's rising star. After he won his Senate race, Rubio was the face of the tea party. He was considered one of the more conservative to enter the Senate. But as the Republican establishment struggled to embrace the tea party, he became the glue. Party leaders saw potential and a future in Rubio. He's young, He's Hispanic and he's telegenic. \\"It's a great day for the conservative cause. New people with new thinking, new ideas -- 21st century solutions,\\" Jeb Bush said immediately after his victory. But politics is a volatile profession. Rubio's folly. Rubio's stock within the Republican Party plummeted last year when he held up the mantle for the Republican Party on immigration reform. He was part of a group of eight senators that forged an agreement, leading to the passage of comprehensive immigration reform. While he was dubbed \\"The Republican Savior\\" by Time Magazine for his work on a solution that has been unable to pass Congress for nearly a decade, conservatives called the bill  amnesty for undocumented immigrants and conservative Erick Erickson called Rubio a \\"disappointment\\" on his blog Red State. \\"While some of us will be able to forgive Marco Rubio's rather rapid shift toward the very position he once vocally opposed, others probably will not be so forgiving,\\" Erickson wrote. Bob Vander Plaats, CEO of The Family Leader, a social conservative organization in Iowa that has a large amount of political influence in the critical presidential caucus state, said people \\"really backed away\\" from Rubio after immigration. Rubio, he said, is going to have to explain himself to Iowa Republicans. Iowa voters are \\"a very discerning lot,\\" Vander Plaats said. \\"They're willing to forgive. They're willing to try to understand.\\" Although his immigration position was likely to appeal to independent voters and even Democrats, the outrage proved the position was unpopular among the base, which he needs in a presidential primary. After the immigration fallout, Rubio felt the heat and backed away from the national spotlight. He laid low and made little noise. Rubio's return. Rubio has mostly avoided the topic of immigration except to pivot away from the bill he helped pass through the Senate by endorsing a fragmented approach in the Republican-led House. He maintained his latest stance again Wednesday when he said a solution for the millions of undocumented immigrants can't happen before the border is secure and a worker verification system is in place. Since 2014 rolled around, Rubio has been carefully crafting his image as a well-rounded, versatile leader in the Republican Party. He has repeatedly appeared on the business channel CNBC to discuss economic policies without mentioning immigration. A smart move, Madden said, because \\"it's dangerous when you make your name on one issue.\\" Madden, who has been watching his campaign, said Rubio is making the right moves, not only in the policy arena but the political one, too. \\"He's not making 2014 about Marco Rubio but making it about candidates across the country,\\" Madden said. Rubio was the first of the possible presidential candidates to endorse Iowa Senate candidate Joni Ernst. He traveled to the state to fundraise and campaign for her. His endorsement and her subsequent win helps him build relationships and a national infrastructure in critical states. Media. Check. Policy. Check. Politics. Check. Now Rubio has the long, treacherous trek of finding the voters who support him. \\"Slow and steady wins the race,\\" Madden said. How many ways can Romney say no to 2016? Highlights:","output":"- Marco Rubio, once a rising star of the Republican Party, has faced challenges on his political journey, partly due to leadership on controversial issues. - Rubio has been working to correct his image and increase his presence by traveling to early presidential nominating states, strengthening his foreign policy credentials, and formulating policy ideas. - Rubio delivered a \\"major address\\" on economic mobility and challenges facing the middle class, integrating personal stories of his own childhood poverty as the son of Cuban immigrants. - Rubio is aiming to raise his profile and differentiate himself from Democrats by speaking at conservative events and proposing alternative policy ideas, such as a private option for Medicare. - Among potential GOP presidential candidates, Rubio garnered 8% support in a June CNN poll, placing him in the middle of the pack, and will need to find his niche in a fractured Republican Party."},{"instruction":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

Is the premise \\"Shoppers walk through an outdoor market.\\" true if \\"A group of shoppers walking at a market while purchasing items.\\"?","output":"Yes, the premise \\"Shoppers walk through an outdoor market\\" can be interpreted as true if the statement given is \\"A group of shoppers walking at a market while purchasing items\\". Although the second statement provides more specific context, it doesn't negate the premise stated in the first sentence.  To break it down further, the two sentences share several key components, which confirm the truth of the initial premise: 1. Shoppers/Group of Shoppers: Both statements involve the presence of shoppers, hence, there is no contradiction here. The second statement's use of 'group of shoppers' still falls under the purview of 'shoppers' in the initial premise. 2. Walk/Walking: The first premise states that the shoppers are walking, while the second statement also confirms this by mentioning that the shoppers are walking at a market.  3. Market: In both instances, the location is a market, wherever and whatever that may be, and does not contradict the initial premise. For the part of \\"outdoor\\" in the first statement, it may not be explicitly mentioned in the second statement whether the market is indoor or outdoor. However, unless it's noted that the market is indoors, the possibility remains that the market could be outdoors as well.  It's also worth mentioning that the additional information of the shoppers purchasing items does not contradict the initial premise. The basic action – shoppers walking in a market – is present in both scenarios. The shoppers' activity of purchasing is simply an added detail and doesn't change the primary action of them being present and walking in the market.  So, given all the comparable factors and unless further specifics indicate otherwise, one could conclude that the premise 'Shoppers walk through an outdoor market' holds true in the context of 'A group of shoppers walking at a market while purchasing items.'"},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

It follows all the principles of syntax, morphology, semantics, and pragmatics, which are key areas in linguistics. Let's break them down to understand this more clearly: 1. Syntax: In terms of sentence structure, it follows the English language clause structure of subject-verb-object \\"The spy (subject) became (verb) too friendly with his new contacts (object).\\" 2. Morphology: The sentence employs appropriate morphemes, which are the smallest meaningful units in a language. All words are in their correct forms, within the plural and singular, tense, and comparison. 3. Semantics: The sentence is meaningful and understandable. \\"The spy\\" is a fully comprehensible subject. \\"Became too friendly\\" is a verb phrase that communicates a clear action and condition. \\"With his new contacts\\" serves as an adverbial phrase modifying the verb phrase, giving us additional information about with whom the subject became friendly. 4. Pragmatics: Looking at the context, supposing we understand who the \\"spy\\" and \\"new contacts\\" are, this sentence communicates a complete, clear idea about their relationship. The sentence also maintains the correct usage of articles, and there are no punctuation errors or misplaced modifiers which could potentially alter its intended meaning.

We usually order quite a few dishes and they are always very good.  I am a really picky Fried Rice eater and like mine a certain way;  lots of veggies, egg and cooked darker brown.  So many places don't do it the way I like it and the way that I grew up used to it.  Mandarin chef is one of the closest I have found.  Today, I ordered a lunch special of Honey Chicken (usually an entree we order for dinner) and it came with fried rice (not the usual with stuff in it), a crab puff, a vegetable egg roll, and soup.  The price is right for 5.99.  You just can't get all that somewhere else.  The food is always tasty and I will always go back to Mandarin Chef. How would this review be described in terms of sentiment?","output":"This review would be described as having a positive sentiment. That means the person really likes Mandarin Chef and enjoys their food, delivery, and prices. They are very happy with this place!"},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant. You will be given a task.

In the second sentence, the index is said to have risen to 50.7 as well, bouncing back from a one-month contraction in March at 47.9. 4. The second sentence provides additional information that there was a one-month contraction in March. Now, let's analyze the findings: Since both sentences mention the same subject and provide the same information about the index of non-manufacturing activity rising to 50.7 from 47.9 in March, the core information is consistent. The additional detail provided in the second sentence about a one-month contraction in March does not contradict the information given in the first sentence.

Read this fact: \\"riding a bike does not cause pollution\\" Now answer this question: \\"which form of transportation has zero emissions?\\"","output":"Bicycle riding is indeed a form of transportation that does not cause pollution, as it generates zero emissions during use. Cycling is a sustainable and eco-friendly mode of transport that relies solely on human physical effort to propel the bicycle. Thus, it helps in reducing the carbon footprint, protecting the environment, and improving air quality.  However, besides cycling, there are other forms of transportation that have minimal or zero emissions. Some of them include: 1. Walking: Like cycling, walking is another form of active transportation that does not produce any emissions. It is the most basic and energy-efficient mode of transport, beneficial for both the environment and personal health. 2. Electric Vehicles (EVs): Electric cars, motorcycles, and bicycles are powered by electricity, typically from a rechargeable battery. When charged using energy from renewable sources like solar, wind, or hydroelectric power, EVs are considered zero-emission vehicles. This contributes to cleaner air and a reduction in greenhouse gas emissions. 3. Public Transportation (Electric Buses and Trains): Electric buses and trains produce no tailpipe emissions when running on electricity sourced from renewable or low-carbon resources. They contribute to reduced congestion and fewer vehicles on the road, further decreasing air pollution. 4. Solar-Powered Vehicles: Some vehicles, mostly experimental or prototypes, rely solely on solar power to operate. Solar panels installed on the surface of the vehicles harness the sun's energy and convert it into electricity, which powers the vehicle's motors. These vehicles have zero emissions. 5. Human-Powered Vehicles (HPVs): HPVs comprise a variety of transportation options, such as skateboards, scooters, rickshaws, and pedal boats, all relying on human muscle power and generating zero emissions. 6. Sailboats: Sailboats use wind power to navigate through water and have no engines or fuel requirements. When relying entirely on the wind for propulsion, sailboats are considered a form of zero-emission transportation. Although multiple forms of transportation have zero or very low emissions, it is important to consider other factors such as manufacturing, maintenance, and disposal processes that might have environmental impacts. However, using these low-emission transportation options contributes significantly toward reducing greenhouse gas emissions, conserving resources, and preserving the environment for future generations."},{"instruction":"Question: Pick the option in line with common sense to answer the question.

Solve -37*b + 159*b + 618 = -968 for b. Solve this problem.","output":"Alright, let's solve this problem step by step.  First, we have a math problem with b's. Our goal is to find what number b is. The problem looks like this:  -37 * b + 159 * b + 618 = -968 Now, let's combine the parts with b's together. So, we will add -37 * b and 159 * b. Imagine that you have -37 apples and someone gives you 159 apples. You'll count them, and you'll have 122 apples. So, our problem will now look like this: 122 * b + 618 = -968 Next, we want to remove the 618 from this equation to make it simpler. To do this, we need to subtract 618 from both sides of the equation. Subtracting 618 from the left side will leave us with just the 122 * b: 122 * b = -968 - 618 Now we find what (-968 - 618) is equal to. If you have a room that is -968 degrees cold, and then it gets even colder, by 618 degrees, the room's temperature will be -1,586 degrees: 122 * b = -1,586 Now we just need to find out what number b is. To do this, let's divide both sides of our equation by 122: b = -1,586 / 122 When we do the division, we will get: b = -13 So, the value of b is -13."},{"instruction":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

Given the question: I can use this background: Blood vessels help regulate body processes by either constricting (becoming narrower) or dilating (becoming wider). These actions occur in response to signals from the autonomic nervous system or the endocrine system. Constriction occurs when the muscular walls of blood vessels contract. This reduces the amount of blood that can flow through the vessels (see Figure below ). Dilation occurs when the walls relax. This increases blood flows through the vessels.  Now, I have a new situation: The blood vessels of two different people are being studied at a laboratory. Jim's blood vessels are narrowing, and Bob's blood vessels are widening.

The word \\"admit\\" in the two sentences has different meanings, although they share the same root word. 1. In the first sentence, \\"To admit evidence in the trial of a cause\\", the word \\"admit\\" means to allow, accept, or permit something (in this case, evidence) to be considered or included in a legal or formal proceeding. This context usually pertains to legal issues, when dealing with a court of law, a judge, or jurors who are assessing and deciding on the outcome of a case. Essentially, the admission of evidence in the trial means that the information becomes part of the court proceedings and can be used to determine the case's outcome. 2. In the second sentence, \\"This pipe admits air\\", the word \\"admit\\" is used in the context of allowing or permitting a substance (air) to pass through a particular space (the pipe).

Background: The Roots is an American hip hop band, formed in 1987 by Tariq \\"Black Thought\\" Trotter and Ahmir \\"Questlove\\" Thompson in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, United States. The Roots are known for a jazzy and eclectic approach to hip-hop featuring live musical instruments. Malik B., Leonard \\"Hub\\" Hubbard, and Josh Abrams were added to the band (formerly named \\"The Square Roots\\"). Since its first independent album-length release the band has released 10 studio albums, two EPs, two collaboration albums (with other artists), and also collaborated on recordings and in live shows with a wide variety of artists in many musical genres. Context: The Roots' original lineup included Tariq \\"Black Thought\\" Trotter (MC) and Ahmir \\"Questlove\\" Thompson (drums), classmates at the Philadelphia High School for Creative and Performing Arts. As they began to play at school and on local streets, they added bassist Josh \\"The Rubberband\\" Abrams, who went on to form the jazz group The Josh Abrams Quartet. They later added another MC, Malik Abdul Basit-Smart (\\"Malik B.\\") and Leonard Nelson \\"Hub\\" Hubbard (bass), and Scott Storch (keyboards). Kenyatta \\"Kid Crumbs\\" Warren (MC) was in the band for Organix, the Roots' first album release. Another MC, Dice Raw, joined the band in cameo appearances on later albums. The band filled Storch's position with Kamal Gray (keyboards), who continues in that capacity. Kamal Gray did not play with the Roots on Late Night With Jimmy Fallon between April or May and early September 2012. His absence was not publicly explained, however on the September 17, 2012 (NBC's 'Late Night' 700th) episode, Gray returned to the group. Beatboxer Rahzel was a band member from 1995 to 1999. Alongside Rahzel was turntablist/vocalist Scratch, who also DJ'd in live concerts. However Scratch left abruptly in 2003. Malik B. left the group in 1999 due to personal reasons but continued to record, making occasional cameos on some albums. Guitarist Ben Kenney, had a brief stint with the group and contributed to the Phrenology album, but left to join Incubus as bassist. Percussionist Frank Knuckles joined the lineup in 2002 and guitarist Kirk \\"Captain Kirk\\" Douglas replaced Kenney. Vocalist Martin Luther toured with the Roots in 2003 and 2004 and contributed to the Tipping Point album. The group announced in August 2007 that its longtime bassist Leonard Hubbard was leaving. Owen Biddle was the band's bassist in 2007-2011.  The band announced on August 25, 2011 that Owen Biddle left the band, replaced by Mark Kelley. On The Tonight Show Starring Jimmy Fallon, James Poyser plays additional keyboards.  Because most of the band members hail from Philadelphia and its surrounding area, they showed their support for the Phillies during the 2009 World Series against the Yankees, displaying Phillies memorabilia when performing on Late Night with Jimmy Fallon. On the episode which aired the day after the Yankees clinched the title, Questlove stated \\"No comment!\\" on the show's intro (when he usually states the episode number), and had a Yankees logo purposely displayed upside-down on his drumset. In 2010, the group showed support for the Flyers during their run to the Stanley Cup Final by having the team logo on their drumset, and again in 2014 when the Flyers faced the New York Rangers in the first round of the playoffs on The Tonight Show Starring Jimmy Fallon.  In April 2017, Frank Knuckles left the Roots due to family issues, and has not appeared on The Tonight Show since then. Later in August 2017, Knuckles sued Questlove, Black Thought and the band manager Shawn Gee over unpaid royalties.

I have a test where I am given the following article, what is an answer for the question: What is the full name of the person who greatly valued the familial connections of Sissinghurst? ?  Vita Sackville-West, poet, author, and gardener, was born at Knole, about 25 miles from Sissinghurst, on 9 March 1892. The great Elizabethan mansion, home of her ancestors but denied to her through agnatic primogeniture, held enormous importance for her throughout her life. Sissinghurst was a substitute for Knole, and she greatly valued its familial connections. In 1913 Sackville-West married Harold Nicolson, a diplomat at the start of his career. Their relationship was unconventional, with both pursuing multiple, mainly same-sex, affairs. After breaking with her lover Violet Trefusis in 1921, Sackville-West became increasingly withdrawn. She wrote to her mother that she would like \\"to live alone in a tower with her books\\", an ambition she achieved in the tower at Sissinghurst where only her dogs were regularly admitted. From 1946 until a few years before her death, Sackville-West wrote a gardening column for The Observer, in which, although she never referred directly to Sissinghurst, she discussed a wide array of horticultural issues. In an article, \\"Some Flowers\\", she discussed the challenge of writing effectively about flowers: \\"I discovered this only when I started to do so. Before ... I found myself losing my temper with the nauseating phraseology ... and sickly vocabulary employed.\\" In 1955, in recognition of her achievement at Sissinghurst, \\"bending some stubborn acres to my will\\", she was awarded the Royal Horticultural Society's Veitch Medal. Her biographer Victoria Glendinning considers Sissinghurst to be Sackville-West's \\"one magnificent act of creation\\".

Question: \\"In what situations would someone with the condition in which a person's airways become inexplicably inflamed and produce mucus experience the condition more acutely?\\"  Context: \\"Asthma is characterized by recurrent episodes of wheezing, shortness of breath, chest tightness, and coughing. Sputum may be produced from the lung by coughing but is often hard to bring up. During recovery from an attack, it may appear pus-like due to high levels of white blood cells called eosinophils. Symptoms are usually worse at night and in the early morning or in response to exercise or cold air. Some people with asthma rarely experience symptoms, usually in response to triggers, whereas others may have marked and persistent symptoms.\\"  Answer: The answer to this question is:","output":"Someone with asthma may experience the condition more acutely in situations where they are exposed to certain triggers that cause their airways to become more inflamed and produce mucus. Some of the common situations or triggers include: 1. Exposure to allergens: Asthma symptoms may worsen when an individual comes into contact with allergens like pollen, dust mites, mold spores, and pet dander. In this situation, the immune system overreacts to these allergens, causing the airways to become inflamed and produce mucus. 2. Respiratory infections: Viral or bacterial respiratory infections, such as the common cold or bronchitis, can cause a person's asthma symptoms to become more severe. In this situation, the immune system's response to the infection leads to increased inflammation and mucus production in the airways. 3. Exercise: Exercise-induced asthma occurs when asthma symptoms become more pronounced during or after physical activity. In this situation, the airways may become more sensitive to changes in temperature and humidity, leading to increased inflammation and mucus production. 4. Exposure to cold air: Breathing in cold air can cause asthma symptoms to worsen. Cold air can cause the airways to constrict, making it difficult for the person to breathe and leading to increased inflammation and mucus production. 5. Emotional stress: Stress and strong emotions can trigger asthma symptoms in some individuals. During times of emotional stress, the body may respond by releasing chemicals that cause the airways to constrict and produce more mucus. 6. Chemical irritants and air pollution: Exposure to irritants like tobacco smoke, air pollution, or chemical fumes can cause asthma symptoms to become more acute. In this situation, the airways may become inflamed and produce mucus in response to the irritants. 7. Certain medications: Some medications, including beta-blockers, aspirin, and nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs), can trigger asthma symptoms in some individuals. In these situations, the medications may cause the airways to constrict or become inflamed, leading to increased symptoms. By recognizing and avoiding these triggers, those with asthma can minimize the frequency and intensity of their symptoms. However, it is essential for individuals with asthma to work with their healthcare provider to develop a comprehensive management plan, including medications and lifestyle adjustments, to better control their condition."},{"instruction":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

Upper respiratory infections make you cough, sneeze, and feel yucky in your nose and throat. Felicia was very good at listening to her mommy and daddy when they told her to wash her hands, cover her mouth when she coughed, and wear warm clothes when it was cold outside. That's why Felicia didn't get sick that year. But, poor little Betty forgot to follow some of these important rules. She sometimes played outside without her warm coat and didn't remember to always wash her hands before eating. So one day, Betty caught an upper respiratory infection, which meant she felt very sick. Because they were such great friends, Felicia and her family felt terrible for Betty. They decided to make a care package with comforting items like hot soup, warm blankets, fun coloring books, and soft tissues. Felicia even made a beautiful get-well-soon card to cheer Betty up. As Betty rested and took care of herself, she eventually felt better. Even though she was sick that year, the kindness of her best friend, Felicia, made her feel loved and cared for. After that, Betty always remembered to follow the important rules of staying healthy and made it her mission to help other kids in the town learn these rules too. And from that day on, Felicia and Betty went on many more adventures, and they both agreed that staying healthy is a very important part of having fun together. And they lived happily ever after.

Summarize: The             World Anti-Doping Agency  (WADA) has accredited the facility which will test athletes for banned substances. The laboratory, based in Essex, has been tested over two years to make sure it is up to international standards. \\"Ensuring athletes come to London with confidence in the anti-doping programme is very important,\\" said Olympic gold medallist Jonathan Edwards. The move comes as the British Olympic Association (BOA)             awaits a decision  over the right to continue imposing lifetime Olympic bans on British athletes who have served suspensions for taking performance-enhancing drugs. The BBC's home of 2012: Latest Olympic news, sport, culture, torch relay, video and audio The Court of Arbitration for Sport (Cas) is expected to rule this week. The BOA challenged a ruling from WADA that its by-law was unenforceable. The by-law was introduced more than 20 years ago and has kept a number of British athletes out of past Olympics. If it is revoked it could mean that banned athletes - sprinter Dwain Chambers and cyclist David Millar - would be eligible for London 2012 selection. The facility in Harlow, operated by             King's College London , is estimated to be the size of seven tennis courts and will carry out more tests than at any previous Olympics. It will operate 24 hours a day during the games, ensuring that every medallist and more than half of all competitors will be tested. Pharmaceutical firm GlaxoSmithKline (GSK) has donated and equipped the lab, which it says is the major part of its Â£20m contribution to the games. \\"The WADA accreditation is a green light signal that the lab is ready,\\" said Jonathan Harris, head of anti-doping at Games organisers Locog. The laboratory underwent a series of rigorous tests including several site visits from WADA's science department and accrediting body ISO/IEC. Assessments focussed on the facility, equipment, procedures and staffing during three formal inspections and dummy sample testing. Over 1,000 Locog staff and a team of 150 anti-doping scientists will test up to 6250 samples during the Games. WADA president John Fahey said that accreditation meant the laboratory would operate to the highest standards during the Games. \\"Doping athletes must know that there is a very good chance they will be tested this summer,\\" he said. \\"Everything scientifically possible - and with the assistance of growing intelligence - will be done to make sure that their efforts to cheat are detected by the experts.\\" The facility will be led independently by Professor David Cowan from King's College London. \\"We have demonstrated that everything is in place and we are well prepared to deliver robust testing for the Games,\\" he said. \\"This accreditation provides recognition of our ability to operate an effective laboratory.\\" In 2011 GSK signed a long-term agreement with WADA to share information about medicines in development with a view to developing early detection methods.

Dan candied apples, pears, plums and quince. Joey candied ginger, peaches, pineapple and oranges but had some humidity in the room the fruit didn't turn out right.  But I can use this background: Sugaring is a food preservation method similar to pickling. Sugaring is the process of desiccating a food by first dehydrating it, then packing it with pure sugar. This sugar can be crystalline in the form of table or raw sugar, or it can be a high sugar density liquid such as honey, syrup or molasses.  The purpose of sugaring is to create an environment hostile to microbial life and prevent food spoilage. Sugaring is commonly used to preserve fruits as well as vegetables such as ginger. From time to time sugaring has also been used for non-food preservations. For example, honey was used as part of the mummification process in some ancient Egyptian rites.  A risk in sugaring is that sugar itself attracts moisture. Once a sufficient moisture level is reached, native yeast in the environment will come out of dormancy and begin to ferment the sugars into alcohol and carbon dioxide. This leads to the process of fermentation. Although fermentation can be used as a food preservation method, it must be intentionally controlled, or the results will tend to be unpleasant.

An intensive performing schedule saw them headline other package tours throughout the year with acts such as the Yardbirds and Mickey Finn. Tensions began to emerge within the band, expressed in incidents such as the on-stage fight between Avory and Dave Davies at The Capitol Theatre, Cardiff, Wales, on 19 May. After finishing the first song, \\"You Really Got Me\\", Davies insulted Avory and kicked over his drum set. Avory responded by hitting Davies with his hi-hat stand, rendering him unconscious, before fleeing from the scene, fearing that he had killed his bandmate. Davies was taken to Cardiff Royal Infirmary, where he received 16 stitches to his head. To placate the police, Avory later claimed that it was part of a new act in which the band members would hurl their instruments at each other.Following a mid-year tour of the United States, the American Federation of Musicians refused permits for the group to appear in concerts there for the next four years, effectively cutting off the Kinks from the main market for rock music at the height of the British Invasion.  Although neither the Kinks nor the union gave a specific reason for the ban, at the time it was widely attributed to their rowdy on-stage behaviour. It has been reported that an incident when the band were taping Dick Clark's TV show Where The Action Is in 1965 led to the ban. Ray Davies recalls in his autobiography, \\"Some guy who said he worked for the TV company walked up and accused us of being late. Then he started making anti-British comments.

The arrest comes on the same day Chamberlain appeared to post a lengthy screed online detailing his history of heartbreak, professional failure and struggle with depression. Questions have emerged whether it was meant to be a suicide note. 'You're reading this. That means we probably don't know each other anymore, and I oweeveryone an explanation,' he writes to an unidentified subject. 'I've timed this note on a Hootsuite delay, and now it's live, which means I wasn't around to stopit from posting.' He makes no mention of violence, but only says: 'I got dark. I got real dark. I explored myriad ways I could put an end to what I was going through. I binged-watched dark TV, sometimes didn't get off the couch for days.' Chamberlain also took to Twitter to deny the allegations against him: 'A panicked update to my letter that should have posted by now. Nothing they're reporting is true. No \\"stashes.\\" Not \\"armed and...' The tweet trails off.

The region includes most of the state of New York, excluding New York City and its environs, as well as Long Island, though the precise boundary is debated. Upstate New York includes the major cities of Buffalo, Rochester, Albany, and Syracuse.  - Raquette Lake is the source of the Raquette River in the Adirondack Mountains of New York State. It is near the community of Raquette Lake, New York. The lake has 99 miles (160 km) of shoreline with pines and mountains bordering the lake. It is located in the towns of Long Lake and Arietta, both in Hamilton County.  - South Africa, officially the Republic of South Africa (RSA), is the southernmost country in Africa. It is bounded on the south by of coastline of Southern Africa stretching along the South Atlantic and Indian Oceans, on the north by the neighbouring countries of Namibia, Botswana and Zimbabwe, and on the east and northeast by Mozambique and Swaziland, and surrounding the kingdom of Lesotho. South Africa is the 25th-largest country in the world by land area, and with close to 56 million people, is the world's 24th-most populous nation. It is the southernmost country on the mainland of the Old World or the Eastern Hemisphere. It is the only country that borders both the Atlantic Ocean and the Indian Ocean. About 80 percent of South Africans are of Sub-Saharan African ancestry, divided among a variety of ethnic groups speaking different Bantu languages, nine of which have official status. The remaining population consists of Africa's largest communities of European (white), Asian (Indian), and multiracial (coloured) ancestry.  - An inholding is privately owned land inside the boundary of a national park, national forest, state park, or similar publicly owned, protected area. In-holdings result from private ownership of lands predating the designation of the park or forest area, or the expansion of the park area to encompass the privately owned property.  In the United States, the main causes of inholdings is that all of the Federal land-management agencies were formed over a century after the government sold and issued land grants to private citizens to fund the administration of the United States. When the park system was formed, many of these now-called \\"in-holdings\\" had been in private ownership for generations and not available for sale when the park was formed.  Over the last several decades, conservation groups have lobbied the United States Congress to acquire private residences especially within designated wilderness areas, either by direct purchase or via land exchange which trades the inholding for other federal lands located outside of national parks or wilderness areas.  - The Adirondack Park is a part of New York's Forest Preserve in Upstate New York, United States. The park's boundary corresponds to the Adirondack Mountains. Unlike most preserves, about 52 per cent of the land is privately owned inholdings heavily regulated by the Adirondack Park Agency. This area contains 102 towns and villages, as well as numerous farms, businesses, and an active timber harvesting industry. The year-round population is 132,000, with 200,000 seasonal residents. The inclusion of human communities makes the park one of the great experiments in conservation in the industrialized world.  - The lake's popularity derives from its remoteness, climate and beauty, as well as its notoriety as the location of the murder of Grace Brown in 1906. Alleged ghost sightings and subsequent media attention have added to the allure.  - The Adirondack Mountains form a massif in the northeast of Upstate New York in the United States. Its boundaries correspond to the boundaries of Adirondack Park. The mountains form a roughly circular dome, about in diameter and about high. The current relief owes much to glaciation.   - The Pigeon Lake Wilderness Area , an Adirondack Park unit of the forest preserve , lies in the town of Webb , Herkimer County , and the towns of Long Lake and Inlet in Hamilton County . It is bounded on the north by Stillwater Reservoir and large blocks of private land in the vicinity of Rose Pond , Shingle Shanty Pond and Upper Sister Lake ; on the east by a private road from Brandreth Lake to North Point and by Raquette Lake ; on the south by private lands along the Uncas Road ; and on the west by the Big Moose Road , private lands near Big Moose Lake , Thirsty Pond , Twitchell Lake , Razorback Pond , and the Remsen to Lake Placid railroad tracks . The terrain consists of low , rolling hills , with the exception of West Mountain near the eastern boundary . There are many brook trout ponds and streams and a considerable expanse of swampland along the courses of Sucker Brook and Beaver Brook . The forest cover runs to mature or near - mature mixed softwoods and hardwoods , with some dense spruce - balsam types near the summit of West Mountain and in the swamplands . Old - growth white pine can be found in the vicinity of Pigeon Lake and a few other places . It is easily accessible to the public from the south , southeast and southwest , but to a lesser extent from the west and north because of posted private lands . The chief attractions for the public are the trout ponds , which entice fishermen as well as campers who frequent scenic spots around Cascade Lake , Queer Lake , Constable Pond , Pigeon Lake and Gull Lake . It is also a popular area for hunters during the big game season . The New York State Department of Environmental Conservation maintains Brown Tract Pond Campground on the southeast perimeter . Motorboats are now banned from operating on Brown Tract Ponds to provide a more compatible situation for canoes and other non-motorized boats utilized by the campers .  - Raquette Lake is a hamlet in the Town of Long Lake in Hamilton County, New York, United States.  - Wilderness or wildland is a natural environment on Earth that has not been significantly modified by civilized human activity.

The country geographically comprises two main landmassesthat of the North Island, or Te Ika-a-Mui, and the South Island, or Te Waipounamuand numerous smaller islands. New Zealand is situated some east of Australia across the Tasman Sea and roughly south of the Pacific island areas of New Caledonia, Fiji, and Tonga. Because of its remoteness, it was one of the last lands to be settled by humans. During its long period of isolation, New Zealand developed a distinct biodiversity of animal, fungal and plant life. The country's varied topography and its sharp mountain peaks, such as the Southern Alps, owe much to the tectonic uplift of land and volcanic eruptions. New Zealand's capital city is Wellington, while its most populous city is Auckland.  - A wilderness area is a region where the land is in a natural state; where impacts from human activities are minimalthat is, as a wilderness.

Its ten provinces and three territories extend from the Atlantic to the Pacific and northward into the Arctic Ocean, covering , making it the world's second-largest country by total area and the fourth-largest country by land area. Canada's border with the United States is the world's longest land border. The majority of the country has a cold or severely cold winter climate, but southerly areas are warm in summer. Canada is sparsely populated, the majority of its land territory being dominated by forest and tundra and the Rocky Mountains. About four-fifths of the country's population of 36 million people is urbanized and live near the southern border. Its capital is Ottawa, its largest city is Toronto; other major urban areas include Montreal, Vancouver, Calgary, Edmonton, Quebec City, Winnipeg and Hamilton.  - The Adirondack Park Agency (APA) was created in 1971 by New York Governor Nelson Rockefeller as a governmental agency that performs long-range planning for the future of the Adirondack Park. It oversees development plans of private land-owners as well as activities within the Adirondack Forest Preserve. Development by private owners must be reviewed to determine if their plan is compatible with the park. The agency is headquartered in Ray Brook, New York.  - Grace Mae Brown (March 20, 1886  July 11, 1906) was an American skirt factory worker whose murder caused a nationwide sensation, and whose life inspired the fictional character Roberta Alden in the Theodore Dreiser novel, \\"An American Tragedy\\", as well as the Jennifer Donnelly novel, \\"A Northern Light\\".

Identify the key components:    - Subject: Elephants    - Action/Verb: grazing    - Object(s): grasses    - Setting/Location: in the wild Now, I will justify the identified words as the most salient words: - \\"Elephants\\": The subject of the sentence signifies the main focus, which is important for understanding the overall context. In this case, the sentence is talking about elephants, making it a salient word. - \\"grazing\\": The action or verb tells us what the subject is doing. Here, the elephants are grazing, so this action is crucial in understanding the activity being described. Therefore, \\"grazing\\" is also a salient word. - \\"grasses\\": This word indicates the object or element upon which the action is being performed.

My oldest son, 9-year-old Salem, asked me several times where we would go to buy a backpack, while my other son, 6-year-old Abdullah, asked what school would be like this year. For the last three years, school was a nightmare for many children and their parents as violence increased and there were more attacks on schools and teachers. As a result, many parents prevented their children from going to school. One of six children in this country did not attend primary school in 2009. Many kids who did attend school were accompanied by a parent for the entire day to make sure nothing happened to their children. For poor families or those with large families, back to school can be an expensive time. The government gives some help to those living in poor neighborhoods, and school bags, note books and other items  are given for free. Most of the merchants who sell notebooks and pens now sell their products out on the street instead of in stores. They sit on the ground and lay their items on the ground or they have a small table to sell their goods. The bags cost between 10 and 20, while clothes and shoes cost between 20 and 30.

Nurse Ratched is a character in which 1975 film?","output":"Nurse Ratched is a character in the 1975 film \\"One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest.\\" This movie is based on the novel by Ken Kesey, who published it in 1962. The film was directed by Miloš Forman and stars Jack Nicholson as Randle P. McMurphy, a convict who fakes insanity to escape the hard labor of prison sentence and ends up in a mental institution. Nurse Mildred Ratched, played by Louise Fletcher, is the main antagonist in the story. The movie delves into life within the mental institution, highlighting the oppressive control Nurse Ratched has over her patients. She represents the oppressive nature of authority and bureaucracy within the mental healthcare system. Her manipulative and tyrannical methods serve as a commentary on the mistreatment of patients within these institutions. Throughout the film, McMurphy clashes with Nurse Ratched as he encourages his fellow patients to question the authority and defy the dehumanizing rules enforced by her. While Nurse Ratched's methods are frequently criticized as cruel, she believes them to be necessary to maintain order and discipline among the patients. This power struggle between McMurphy and Nurse Ratched creates tension and drama in the story, as both characters resist bending to the other's will. \\"One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest\\" received widespread critical acclaim and numerous awards upon its release. It was the second movie in history to win all five major Academy Awards, which includes Best Picture, Best Director, Best Actor (Jack Nicholson), Best Actress (Louise Fletcher), and Best Adapted Screenplay (Lawrence Hauben and Bo Goldman). The film also won numerous Golden Globe and BAFTA awards. In addition to its commercial and critical success, \\"One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest\\" left a lasting impact on the portrayal of mental health and authority in film. Nurse Ratched's character, in particular, remains a memorable representation of the abuse of power within institutional systems. Her character has been widely discussed in various contexts, such as literary studies, sociology, and mental health awareness campaigns. Overall, \\"One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest\\" is an influential film with a powerful and unforgettable villain in Nurse Ratched, whose character continues to serve as a talking point in discussions around mental health and societal control."},{"instruction":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

A:","output":"Question: In the context of the passage, explain the differences between early electromechanical digital computers and their all-electric successors by referring to their components, operating speed, and provide a relevant example of an electromechanical computer. Answer: The passage describes the evolution of early digital computers, highlighting the shift from electromechanical to all-electric designs. Early electromechanical digital computers primarily used electric switches and mechanical relays to perform calculations. These components operated at a significantly lower speed compared to their successors. One of the landmark examples of an electromechanical relay computer is the Z2, created by German engineer Konrad Zuse in 1939. On the other hand, all-electric computers replaced the electromechanical components with faster and more efficient alternatives, specifically vacuum tubes. This upgrade led to a considerable increase in the operating speed of these computers and marked a significant advancement in digital computing technology. Overall, the main differences between electromechanical digital computers and all-electric computers lie in the components used in their design and their respective operating speeds, as exemplified by the Z2 as an early electromechanical computer."},{"instruction":"Given the question: Given the following context:  Joseph and Mary lived with their son Joseph, Jr. and his family in a small house while theirs was being built. Mary Priestley was primarily responsible for the design of the couple's new home and her family inheritance may have helped finance it, but she died before it was completed. By 1797, Joseph's laboratory was completed—the first part of the home to be finished. It was the first laboratory that \\"he had designed, built, and outfitted entirely himself\\" and was probably the first \\"scientifically-equipped laboratory\\" in the United States. Joseph continued his scientific and scholarly work in his new laboratory, identifying carbon monoxide (which he called \\"heavy inflammable air\\"). In 1798 Joseph Jr., his wife, and their children moved into the new house with Joseph Priestley. The house also held Priestley's library, which contained about 1600 volumes by his death in 1804 and was one of the largest in America at the time. The Priestley family held Unitarian church services in the drawing room and Joseph educated a group of young men until the local Northumberland Academy that he helped found was completed.The house proper was completed in 1798, with a Mr. Jones of Northumberland employed acting as master carpenter.

Movie plot title: The Tree of Life Movie plot: Tree of Life is a period piece centered around three boys in the 1950s. The eldest son (Hunter McCracken none SAG) of two characters (Brad Pitt and Jessica Chastain) witnesses the loss of innocence.The movie, which exists as a metaphysical meditation and a lyrical poem, focuses at a microcosmic level on the story of Jack, a jaded, middle aged man (played by Sean Penn) scarred by the memories of an oppressive upbringing by his father (Brad Pitt), as well as the untimely death of his younger brother.We trace the evolution of an eleven-year-old boy in the Midwest, Jack, one of three brothers. At first all seems marvelous to the child. He sees as his mother does, with the eyes of his soul. She represents the way of love and mercy, where the father tries to teach his son the world's way, of putting oneself first. Each parent contends for his allegiance, and Jack must reconcile their claims. The picture darkens as he has his first glimpses of sickness, suffering and death. The world, once a thing of glory, becomes a labyrinth.Framing this story is that of adult Jack, a lost soul in a modern world, seeking to discover amid the changing scenes of time that which does not change: the eternal scheme of which we are a part. When he sees all that has gone into our world's preparation, each thing appears a miracle precious, incomparable. Jack, with his new understanding, is able to forgive his father and take his first steps on the path of life.The story ends in hope, acknowledging the beauty and joy in all things, in the everyday and above all in the family -- our first school -- the only place that most of us learn the truth about the world and ourselves, or discover life's single most important lesson, of unselfish love.

Please answer the following question: I'm taking a test and have to guess the right answer to the question after the article. Article: Parents often think that time spent with their kids will gradually decrease in adolescence. But a new study suggests that while teens try to avoid spending a lot of time together with their parents, private parent-child meetings may actually increase in their early adolescent years. And that may raise a teenager's self-esteem   and social confidence, especially if it is the time that spent with Dad, the researchers added. The researchers created a long-term study in which they invited families in 16 school districts in central Pennsylvania to participate. In each family, a teenager, a younger sibling  , their mother and their father were interviewed at home and then asked about their activities and self-worth five times over a period of seven years. The study authors were surprised to discover that when fathers spent more time alone with their teenagers, the kids reported they felt better about themselves. Something about the father's role in the family seemed to improve self-esteem among the teenagers in the study, said study co-author Susan McHale, a professor of human development at Pennsylvania State University. \\"Time with Dad often involves joking, teasing, and other playful interactions. Fathers, compared to mothers, were more involved in leisure activities and had more peer-like interactions with their children, which is crucial for youth social development,\\" the study showed. But Marta Flaum, a psychologist in Chappaqua, New York, said, \\"How these findings reflect the real world is a real question.

The main emphasis lies on creating a gap, which will allow the elastic to slide through with ease, and adopting suitable sewing techniques for stretchy fabrics. In order to create a gap for the elastic, the article suggests sewing the hems close to the raw or cut edge of the fabric, permitting enough space for the elastic band. Attention to this detail is crucial to ensure proper hemming and elastic insertion. As the hems are sewn, sewing pins are usually placed to secure the fabric's position. Once the seam is successfully stitched, the sewing pins can be removed.  To avoid any loose threads that could potentially damage the garment or become entangled, the article recommends tying the ends of the threads into tight knots and trimming excess thread close to the fabric. This not only provides a clean finish but also ensures the longevity of the sewn garment. Furthermore, selecting the appropriate stitch when sewing stretchy fabrics plays a vital role in maintaining the fabric's elasticity and ensuring that the stitching can withstand stretching. The recommended stitch for these types of materials resembles a straight stitch interspersed with V-shaped stitches. This pattern provides a combination of durability and flexibility, as it allows the stitch to expand along with the fabric without breaking or causing tension in the material. In summary, the article provides valuable guidance on sewing elastic into garments, emphasizing the importance of creating a gap for the elastic, using appropriate stitching techniques, and finishing the task properly. These tips, if followed correctly, can enhance the effectiveness and durability of elastic bands in garments and ensure a comfortable, well-fitted final product."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Colin Shaddick, who heads the company, said, \\"Women are logging on in record numbers ---online shopping has certainly played a big role in this.\\" The study found that average annual spending online is PS700 a year for each Internet shopper.  The draw of the Internet is especially strong for collectors. Business lecturer Stephen Hall, who has been buying and selling books since he was a child, now has a collection worth PS40,000.  He is passionate about the opportunities offered by shopping online. \\"You can find a book in minutes that you could spend months hunting down at auctions or second-hand bookshops,\\" he said. \\"It can easily become addictive, and all the collectors I know use the Internet. I suspect you do waste money because you are less likely to send back a book to Little Rock, Arkansas, than take it back to the high-street shop.\\" Like Stephen Hall, most of us can shop online sensibly---but for some it provides an easy, anonymous and accessible way to feed their habit. It also provides secrecy---a central part of any addiction. Dr Samantha Haslett, a psychologist and expert in addiction at the Promos counseling centre, said, \\"It's compulsive in the same way as alcohol and gambling, and addicts find themselves completely unable to stop themselves, despite debt mounting...

Secretary of State Hillary Clinton on Monday tried to douse a political firestorm over the deadly assault on a U.S. diplomatic mission in Libya, saying she's responsible for the security of American diplomatic outposts. \\"I take responsibility,\\" Clinton told CNN in an interview while on a visit to Peru. \\"I'm in charge of the State Department's 60,000-plus people all over the world, 275 posts. The president and the vice president wouldn't be knowledgeable about specific decisions that are made by security professionals. They're the ones who weigh all of the threats and the risks and the needs and make a considered decision.\\" But she said an investigation now under way will ultimately determine what happened at the U.S. Consulate in Benghazi, where Ambassador Chris Stevens and three other Americans were killed on September 11. \\"I take this very personally,\\" Clinton said. \\"So we're going to get to the bottom of it, and then we're going to do everything we can to work to prevent it from happening again, and then we're going to work to bring whoever did this to us to justice.\\" VP debate left unanswered national security questions. The attack took place in the eastern Libyan city that was the cradle of that country's 2011 revolution. Obama administration officials initially blamed a mob inflamed by a U.S.-produced movie that mocked Islam and its Prophet Mohammed, but later said the storming of the consulate appears to have been a terrorist attack. With criticism growing, Vice President Joe Biden said during last week's vice presidential debate that the White House did not know of requests to enhance security at Benghazi, contradicting testimony by State Department employees that requests had been made and rejected. After the debate, the White House said the vice president did not know of the requests because they were handled, as is the practice, by the State Department. Fact Check: Benghazi security. \\"In the wake of an attack like this, in the fog of war, there's always going to be confusion,\\" Clinton said. \\"And I think it is absolutely fair to say that everyone had the same intelligence. Everyone who spoke tried to give the information that they had. As time has gone on, that information has changed. We've gotten more detail, but that's not surprising. That always happens.\\" She added, \\"What I want to avoid is some kind of political gotcha or blame game.\\" \\"I know that we're very close to an election,\\" Clinton said. \\"I want to just take a step back here and say from my own experience, we are at our best as Americans when we pull together. I've done that with Democratic presidents and Republican presidents.\\" Her remarks drew a quick response from three Republicans on the Senate Armed Services Committee, including ranking member John McCain. Clinton's statement of responsibility was \\"a laudable gesture, especially when the White House is trying to avoid any responsibility whatsoever,\\" the Arizona senator said in a joint broadside with Sens. Lindsey Graham of South Carolina and Kelly Ayotte of New Hampshire. However, they added, \\"The security of Americans serving our nation everywhere in the world is ultimately the job of the commander-in-chief. The buck stops there.\\" Stevens, State Department computer expert Sean Smith and security contractors Glen Doherty and Tyrone Woods died in the Benghazi assault, which State Department officials now say was the work of dozens of armed men. Clinton also described a desperate scene in the State Department during the hours of the attack, as staff tried to find out what had happened. \\"This was a many-hour ordeal that we were all involved in, and I was deeply concerned as you would obviously assume, to hear about an attack,\\" she said. Not only was the picture coming out of Libya murky, but also, \\"Then we couldn't find Ambassador Stevens, and we were trying desperately to figure out what happened to him and to Sean Smith and to the others who were there.\\" Actress sues filmmaker. Clinton said her mission now is to make sure such an attack will never happen again, and also to ensure the work of American diplomats won't be stopped even in dangerous areas like Benghazi. \\"We can't retreat.

We have to be engaged,\\" she said. \\"We can't hang out behind walls.\\" She said Stevens, who came to Benghazi on a cargo ship to start building ties with rebel leaders during last year's revolt, \\"knew that more than anybody.\\" Special forces assessed security at Benghazi.

Professor Kessler is even brought onto a daytime news show, in which he is interviewed by newscaster Nathalie Lake (Sarah Jessica Parker). Nathalie's boyfriend Jason Stone (Michael J Fox) notes that she seems to be flirting with the Professor, when the news transmission goes out completely, and all television signals are blocked by a transmission from the Martians.In the wake of this transmission, The President, Kessler, and several Generals hold a meeting in their war room to analyze what they know about the Martians.

I have a test where I am given the following article, what is an answer for the question: What is the first name of the person who turned to musical journalism after a failed student career in Oxford and London? ?  Philip Arnold Heseltine (30 October 1894 – 17 December 1930), known by the pseudonym Peter Warlock, was a British composer and music critic. The Warlock name, which reflects Heseltine's interest in occult practices, was used for all his published musical works. He is best known as a composer of songs and other vocal music; he also achieved notoriety in his lifetime through his unconventional and often scandalous lifestyle. As a schoolboy at Eton College, Heseltine met the British composer Frederick Delius, with whom he formed a close friendship. After a failed student career in Oxford and London, Heseltine turned to musical journalism, while developing interests in folk-song and Elizabethan music. His first serious compositions date from around 1915. Following a period of inactivity, a positive and lasting influence on his work arose from his meeting in 1916 with the Dutch composer Bernard van Dieren; he also gained creative impetus from a year spent in Ireland, studying Celtic culture and language. On his return to England in 1918, Heseltine began composing songs in a distinctive, original style, while building a reputation as a combative and controversial music critic.  During 1920–21 he edited the music magazine The Sackbut. His most prolific period as a composer came in the 1920s, when he was based first in Wales and later at Eynsford in Kent. Through his critical writings, published under his own name, Heseltine made a pioneering contribution to the scholarship of early music. In addition, he produced a full-length biography of Frederick Delius and wrote, edited, or otherwise assisted the production of several other books and pamphlets. Towards the end of his life, Heseltine became depressed by a loss of his creative inspiration. He died in his London flat of coal gas poisoning in 1930, probably by his own hand.

But have you ever thought about taking pictures of them? Ken Libbrecht did. He is a physics professor from California. Although the weather in California is usually warm and sunny, Ken's hobby is taking pictures of snowflakes. He travels to cold areas like Alaska and Canada to find snowstorms and take pictures of the snowflakes. \\"They are often beautiful, and every snowfall brings new surprises,\\" says Ken. Ken takes pictures of snowflakes with a high-quality digital camera. He uses a microscope   to make the tiny snowflakes larger. To get the best images, Ken built a special photo-microscope just for snowflakes. He collects flakes by letting them fall onto a piece of foam board  . The pictures must be taken outdoors, so Ken wears lots of clothes to stay warm. But his fingers often get cold, because it's difficult for him to take pictures of a tiny snowflake with gloves. Each snowflake has shapes and patterns   that make it as unique   as a person's fingerprint. The hobby of snowflake photography is also unique. Next time a snowstorm blows through your town, take a closer look at the flakes before you gather them into a snowball. See if you can notice their unique patterns. Millions of snowflakes are waiting for you! ,. Question: Why do Ken's fingers often get cold? Yes or no, is the answer \\"Because he doesn't wear gloves.\\"? A:","output":"Ken Libbrecht's fingers often get cold because it is difficult for him to take pictures of tiny snowflakes with gloves on. This implies that he might either wear gloves that are not suitable for such delicate work or he doesn't wear gloves at all while taking the photographs, in order to have better control and precision. So, the answer \\"Because he doesn't wear gloves\\" can be considered partially accurate, as it is not explicitly stated if he doesn't wear gloves or if he wears gloves that are not suitable for the task. However, the main reason his fingers get cold is due to the challenges he faces in handling the delicate task of photographing snowflakes, which requires precision and often exposes his fingers to the cold weather."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Please answer the following question: What was the first name of the person made the Grand Tour in his youth?  Answer the above question based on the context below:  Holkham was built by 1st Earl of Leicester, Thomas Coke, who was born in 1697. A cultivated and wealthy man, Coke made the Grand Tour in his youth and was away from England for six years between 1712 and 1718. It is likely he met both Burlington—the aristocratic architect at the forefront of the Palladian revival movement in England—and William Kent in Italy in 1715, and that in the home of Palladianism the idea of the mansion at Holkham was conceived. Coke returned to England, not only with a newly acquired library, but also an art and sculpture collection with which to furnish his planned new mansion. However, after his return, he lived a feckless life, preoccupying himself with drinking, gambling and hunting, and being a leading supporter of cockfighting.  He made a disastrous investment in the South Sea Company and when the South Sea Bubble burst in 1720, the resultant losses delayed the building of Coke's planned new country estate for over ten years. Coke, who had been made Earl of Leicester in 1744, died in 1759—five years before the completion of Holkham—having never fully recovered his financial losses. Thomas's wife, Lady Margaret Tufton, Countess of Leicester (1700–1775), would oversee the finishing and furnishing of the house.Although Colen Campbell was employed by Thomas Coke in the early 1720s, the oldest existing working and construction plans for Holkham were drawn by Matthew Brettingham, under the supervision of Thomas Coke, in 1726. These followed the guidelines and ideals for the house as defined by Kent and Burlington. The Palladian revival style chosen was at this time making its return in England. The style made a brief appearance in England before the Civil War, when it was introduced by Inigo Jones. However, following the Restoration it was replaced in popular favour by the Baroque style.

A). file to open up so she was able to access the information. B). cursor to open up so she was able to access the information.","output":"Brittany clicked on the file with her cursor, causing the file to open up so she was able to access the information. The choice \\"A\\" is the most appropriate continuation of the sentence because it emphasizes the logical sequence of actions in the context of computer usage. When Brittany uses her cursor to click on the file, the direct result should be the file -not the cursor- opening. The cursor is simply a digital tool Brittany uses to interact with the graphical user interface of her operating system. Its purpose is navigation and selection. On the other hand, the file is an object that Brittany interacts with using her cursor. Once a file is clicked or double-clicked (depending on the system settings), the file opens, revealing its content, whether that be text, image, video, audio, or program data. Therefore, once Brittany clicked on the file with her cursor, the file would open up, revealing whatever information it contained. Brittany might be searching for a piece of important data, about to edit a document, about to execute a software program, or she could be opening a media file for some much-deserved relaxation time. It's also possible that she's organizing files, in which case she would be routinely opening and closing files to check their contents. Choice \\"B\\" - The cursor opening up so she was able to access the information - is not a typical or logical sequence that happens in computing. Cursors do not open or close; they just move, click, and sometimes change form depending on their current function or the application in use. But they don’t contain a file type data to provide access to the information. This is why the next sentence to \\"Brittany clicked on the file with her cursor, causing the ...\\" should optimally be choice \\"A\\": \\"file to open up so she was able to access the information.” It’s the more logical and technically sound progression to the sentence."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Both sentences describe the impact of the Haymarket affair and how it led to a significant increase in the level of social consciousness or awareness among many individuals, as communicated by Goldman in her letters to historian Max Nettlau. In Sentence 1, the term \\"social consciousness\\" is used to describe the increased awareness of social issues, injustices, and inequalities that people began to recognize after the Haymarket affair. Social consciousness refers to the collective understanding and sensitivity individuals have towards societal problems and the need for change or reform in response to those issues. In Sentence 2, the term \\"social awareness\\" is employed, which generally implies the same concept as social consciousness: an increased understanding of social problems and the mutual desire for change. However, social awareness may be considered a broader term, encompassing not only the ability to identify societal issues but also the interpersonal skills that help individuals to act in an empathetic and ethical manner when interacting with others. Despite the slight variation in terminology, both sentences communicate the idea that the Haymarket affair was instrumental in enlightening numerous people about social matters, ultimately initiating the need for change and improvement in society.

Rights activists hold out hope that U.S. President Donald Trump will confront Kim at their expected Singapore meeting in June about ongoing atrocities in North Korea, including a network of political prison camps and widespread government sanctioned abuses in the country. Benedict Rogers, with Christian Solidarity Worldwide, a religious freedom oriented organization, urges President Trump to emulate former President Ronald Reagan who once publicly called on the leader of the Soviet Union to tear down the Berlin Wall that separated democratic West Germany and the Communist East. “Mr. Trump’s message should be, Mr. Kim if you seek peace, come to the gates of the prison camps, open the prison camps, tear down the walls of the prison camps,” said Rogers at a North Korea human rights conference in Seoul on Thursday. It is unclear if human rights will be part of the agenda at the U.S.-North Korea nuclear summit, if it happens. U.S. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo and high-ranking North Korean official Kim Yong Chol have been meeting this week in New York to overcome the main obstacle to the summit; the gap between the U.S. demand for rapid and complete denuclearization and North Korea’s more phased in approach that would provide early sanctions relief. Brad Adams, the Asia director at the advocacy group Human Rights Watch said in a statement on Thursday, “Whatever the outcome of nuclear talks, human rights-related sanctions should remain in effect until North Korea changes the way it treats its people.” The United Nations has passed 13 resolutions addressing human rights abuses in North Korea, most recently in March of this year at the United Nations Human Rights Council in Geneva.

Liverpool and its surrounding areas form the fifth largest metropolitan area in the UK, with an estimated population of over 2.24 million in 2011. The local authority is Liverpool City Council, which is the most populous local government district within the metropolitan county of Merseyside and the largest within the Liverpool City Region.  - Hard rock is a loosely defined subgenre of rock music that began in the mid-1960s, with the garage, psychedelic and blues rock movements. It is typified by a heavy use of aggressive vocals, distorted electric guitars, bass guitar, drums, and often accompanied with pianos and keyboards.  - \\"Beatlemania\\" is a term that originated and was coined during the early 1960s to describe the intense fan frenzy directed towards the English rock band the Beatles. The phenomenon began in 1963 and continued past the group's break-up in 1970, despite the band ceasing public performances in 1966.  - John Winston Ono Lennon, (born John Winston Lennon; 9 October 19408 December 1980) was an English singer and songwriter who co-founded the Beatles, the most commercially successful band in the history of popular music. With fellow member Paul McCartney, he formed a celebrated songwriting partnership.  - Skiffle is a music genre with jazz, blues, folk and American folk influences, usually using homemade or improvised instruments. Originating as a term in the United States in the first half of the 20th century, it became popular again in the UK in the 1950s, where it was associated with artists such as Lonnie Donegan, The Vipers Skiffle Group, Ken Colyer and Chas McDevitt. Skiffle played a major part in beginning the careers of later eminent jazz, pop, blues, folk and rock musicians and has been seen as a critical stepping stone to the second British folk revival, blues boom and British Invasion of the US popular music scene.  - Richard Starkey, (born 7 July 1940), known professionally as Ringo Starr, is an English musician, singer, songwriter and actor who gained worldwide fame as the drummer for the Beatles. He occasionally sang lead vocals, usually for one song on an album, including \\"With a Little Help from My Friends\\", \\"Yellow Submarine\\" and their cover of \\"Act Naturally\\". He also wrote the Beatles' songs \\"Don't Pass Me By\\" and \\"Octopus's Garden\\", and is credited as a co-writer of others, including \\"What Goes On\\" and \\"Flying\\".  - The counterculture of the 1960s refers to an anti-establishment cultural phenomenon that developed first in the United Kingdom (UK) and the United States (US) and then spread throughout much of the Western world between the early 1960s and the mid-1970s, with London, New York City, and San Francisco being hotbeds of early countercultural activity. The aggregate movement gained momentum as the American Civil Rights Movement continued to grow, and became revolutionary with the expansion of the US government's extensive military intervention in Vietnam. As the 1960s progressed, widespread social tensions also developed concerning other issues, and tended to flow along generational lines regarding human sexuality, women's rights, traditional modes of authority, experimentation with psychoactive drugs, and differing interpretations of the American Dream. Many key movements related to these issues were born, catalyzed, or advanced within the counterculture of the 1960s.  - This article is a list of cover versions recorded and released by the Beatles as a band or solo artists .  - Rock and roll (often written as rock & roll or rock 'n' roll) is a genre of popular music that originated and evolved in the United States during the late 1940s and early 1950s, from African-American musical styles such as gospel, jazz, boogie woogie, and rhythm and blues, with country. While elements of rock and roll can be heard in blues records from the 1920s and in country records of the 1930s, the genre did not acquire its name until the 1950s.  - The Beatles were an English rock band, formed in Liverpool in 1960. With members John Lennon, Paul McCartney, George Harrison and Ringo Starr, they became widely regarded as the foremost and most influential act of the rock era. Rooted in skiffle, beat, and 1950s rock and roll, the Beatles later experimented with several musical styles, ranging from pop ballads and Indian music to psychedelia and hard rock, often incorporating classical elements and unconventional recording techniques in innovative ways. In the early 1960s, their enormous popularity first emerged as \\"Beatlemania\\", but as the group's music grew in sophistication, led by primary songwriters Lennon and McCartney, they came to be perceived as an embodiment of the ideals shared by the counterculture of the 1960s.  - A ballad is a form of verse, often a narrative set to music. Ballads derive from the medieval French \\"chanson balladée\\" or \\"ballade\\", which were originally \\"danced songs\\". Ballads were particularly characteristic of the popular poetry and song of the British Isles from the later medieval period until the 19th century. They were widely used across Europe, and later in the Americas, Australia and North Africa. Ballads are 13 lines with an ABABBCBC form, consisting of couplets (two lines) of rhymed verse, each of 14 syllables.  - George Harrison, (25 February 1943  29 November 2001) was an English guitarist, singer, songwriter, and music and film producer who achieved international fame as the lead guitarist of the Beatles. Often referred to as \\"the quiet Beatle\\", Harrison embraced Hindu mythology and helped broaden the horizons of his fellow Beatles as well as their Western audience by incorporating Indian instrumentation in their music. Although most of the Beatles' songs were written by John Lennon and Paul McCartney, most Beatles albums from 1965 onwards contained at least two Harrison compositions. His songs for the group included \\"Taxman\\", \\"Within You Without You\\", \\"While My Guitar Gently Weeps\\", \\"Here Comes the Sun\\" and \\"Something\\", the last of which became the Beatles' second-most covered song.  - Sir James Paul McCartney, (born 18 June 1942) is an English singer-songwriter, multi-instrumentalist, and composer. With John Lennon, George Harrison, and Ringo Starr, he gained worldwide fame with the rock band the Beatles, largely considered the most popular and influential group in the history of pop music. His songwriting partnership with Lennon is the most celebrated of the post-war era. After the band's break-up, he pursued a solo career and formed the band Wings with his first wife, Linda, and Denny Laine.

The answer is:","output":"The perturbation hypothesis you provided, which is a climate warming up, may have indirect effects on blood glucose levels, but it is not directly related to the process you described. The process mentioned is a physiological response that occurs within the body to maintain blood sugar levels, and is mainly influenced by factors such as diet, physical activity, and hormonal regulation. However, a warmer climate could potentially have indirect effects on blood sugar levels. For example, it could lead to changes in food production and availability, impacting a person's dietary choices and potentially influencing their blood sugar levels. Additionally, warmer temperatures might encourage people to be more physically active, which can help in maintaining healthy blood sugar levels. In some cases, extreme heat could also lead to dehydration and stress, potentially impacting blood sugar regulation.

Even though electronic espionage may cost U.S. firms billions of dollars a year, most aren't yet taking precautions, the experts said. By contrast, European firms will spend 150 million this year on electronic security, and are expected to spend 1 billion by 1992. Already many foreign firms, especially banks, have their own cryptographers, conference speakers reported. Still, encrypting corporate communications is only a partial remedy. One expert, whose job is so politically sensitive that he spoke on condition that he wouldn't be named or quoted, said the expected influx of East European refugees over the next few years will greatly increase the chances of computer-maintenance workers, for example, doubling as foreign spies. Moreover, he said, technology now exists for stealing corporate secrets after they've been \\"erased\\" from a computer's memory. He said that Oliver North of Iran-Contra notoriety thought he had erased his computer but that the information was later retrieved for congressional committees to read. No personal computer, not even the one on a chief executive's desk, is safe, this speaker noted. W.

Somehow, with time, they couldn't keep up with the other teams, and they stopped being the best. But something amazing happened in 2016! Northern Ireland's football team got really good again! They had a very important match against a team called Greece. Guess where the match was? In a special place called Windsor Park, where lots of people came to watch the game. Everyone was really happy, excited, and, believe it or not, very emotional! Why emotional? Well, imagine how your mommy and daddy would feel if they saw you doing something amazing after trying really hard for a long time. That's how the people felt - very proud of their team! And guess what? Northern Ireland's team won the game against Greece! Hooray! Because they won, they got to be a part of something called Euro 2016. Euro 2016 is like a big party where the best football teams from different countries in a place called Europe come together to play and see who is the best of the best. So, after waiting for 30 whole years, Northern Ireland's football team became one of the best teams again, and they got to play in the exciting Euro 2016! All the people in Northern Ireland were very happy, and everyone had a great time celebrating the big win. And that's the end of our happy story, little friends!"},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant. Provide a detailed answer so user don’t need to search outside to understand the answer. Detailed Instructions: In this task, you are given a passage and a question regarding that passage. You must determine whether or not the question is answerable from the given passage. If a question is answerable, output should be 'True', otherwise 'False'. You must not consider any other information that is not provided in the passage while labelling True or False. Problem:Passage: In the meantime, on August 1, 1774, an experiment conducted by the British clergyman Joseph Priestley focused sunlight on mercuric oxide (HgO) inside a glass tube, which liberated a gas he named \\"dephlogisticated air\\". He noted that candles burned brighter in the gas and that a mouse was more active and lived longer while breathing it. After breathing the gas himself, he wrote: \\"The feeling of it to my lungs was not sensibly different from that of common air, but I fancied that my breast felt peculiarly light and easy for some time afterwards.\\" Priestley published his findings in 1775 in a paper titled \\"An Account of Further Discoveries in Air\\" which was included in the second volume of his book titled Experiments and Observations on Different Kinds of Air. Because he published his findings first, Priestley is usually given priority in the discovery. Question: What chemical did Priestley use in his experiments on oxygen? Solution:","output":"True"},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant. You will be given a task. You must generate a detailed and long answer. Given the question: What is the final step of the following process: -  Solution caves are formed in limestone and similar rocks by the action of water - After a rain, water seeps into cracks and pores of soil and rock - The water percolates beneath the land surface - Some of the water reaches a zone where all the cracks and pores in the rock are already filled with water - Rainwater absorbs some carbon dioxide as it passes through the atmosphere and even more as it drains through soil and decaying vegetation - The water combines chemically with the carbon dioxide - A weak carbonic acid solution is formed The answer is:","output":"The final step of the process is the dissolution of limestone and formation of solution caves. Once the rainwater has absorbed carbon dioxide from the atmosphere and soil, forming a weak carbonic acid solution, it continues to permeate through the subsurface rock layers, especially in limestone and similar soluble rocks such as dolomite and marble.  As the weak carbonic acid solution comes into contact with the limestone rock, it reacts chemically, dissolving the calcium carbonate (CaCO3) that the rock primarily consists of. This process is known as carbonation. The chemical reaction can be represented as follows: CaCO3 (limestone) + H2CO3 (carbonic acid) → Ca(HCO3)2 (calcium bicarbonate) The calcium bicarbonate formed in this reaction is soluble in water, unlike calcium carbonate. Over time, as more and more of the limestone rock dissolves, the cavities and fissures within the rock expand, creating larger voids and interconnected passageways. This continuous dissolution and erosion of the limestone leads to the formation of solution caves, which may later merge with other caves to form extensive cave systems. Apart from creating solution caves, this process also leads to the formation of various secondary cave features, such as stalactites, stalagmites, columns, and flowstone, as the calcium carbonate precipitates from the dripping or flowing water and re-crystallizes. The caves and their unique formations subsequently attract tourists, scientists, and cavers, offering numerous opportunities for exploration, research, and appreciation of Earth's natural beauty. In summary, the final step of the given process is the dissolution of limestone by the weak carbonic acid solution, ultimately resulting in the formation of solution caves and speleothems (cave features) within the soluble rock."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Q:This article: Mr. Dinkle and Jack (Abbott and Costello) look for work at the Cosman Employment Agency. Jack makes advances to Cosman employee Polly, but he is thwarted by the arrival of her boyfriend, a towering police officer. Polly assigns Dinkle and Jack to babysit for Eloise Larkin's brother and infant sister, while Eloise and her fiancé are out for the evening. The babysitting duties are complicated by the fact that Donald is something of a prodigy, as well as a self-proclaimed \\"problem child\\". The dull-witted Jack is soon outclassed by the child, and an attempt to lull the boy to sleep by reading the fairy tale Jack and the Beanstalk (Jack's \\"favorite novel\\") aloud fails when Jack stumbles over the larger words. Bemused by Jack's incompetence, Donald reads the story instead—a role-reversal made complete when Jack falls asleep as Donald reads. In his slumber, Jack dreams that he is the young Jack of the fairy tale. In his dream Jack learns that the Giant, who lives in a castle in the sky, has stolen all of the land's wealth and food. The situation obliges the kingdom's princess to marry The Prince of a neighboring kingdom, whom she has never met. Jack must also make sacrifices, when his mother sends him to sell the last family possession, their beloved cow \\"Henry\\", to the local butcher, Mr. Dinklepuss. Along the way Jack meets The Prince, disguised as a troubador (who is kidnapped by the Giant soon afterward). The unscrupulous Dinklepuss pays Jack five \\"magic\\" beans for the cow.

Please briefly summarize this news article: Obama's Supreme Court pick meets with first GOP senator Sen. Mark Kirk on Tuesday became the first Republican senator to meet with Merrick Garland, President Obama’s Supreme Court nominee. The senator from Illinois, who is facing a competitive re-election this fall, slammed his GOP colleagues, some of whom have flatly refused to meet with Garland or even consider holding confirmation hearings. “I think we should do our jobs,” Kirk told reporters after the meeting, adding that he hoped other Republicans will follow his lead. “We need a rational, adult, open-minded consideration of the process.” Kirk is perhaps the most endangered Senate Republican facing re-election in November. And when it comes to the battle over Obama's pick to fill the court vacancy, Kirk has been an outlier. He's one of just three Senate Republicans to say the Senate Judiciary Committee should hold hearings on Garland. And he's one of two GOP senators -- along with Susan Collins, R-Maine -- to say the full chamber should vote on the nominee. \\"I think when you just say I'm not going to meet with him and all, that's too closed-minded,\\" Kirk said Tuesday. Republicans, led by Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell, R-Ky., insist that Obama's successor should fill the Supreme Court vacancy after American voters have a say in November. The death last month of conservative Justice Antonin Scalia created the court opening, and Obama is pressing to make his third appointment to the high court. \\"By leading by example, I'm showing what a rational, responsible guy would do that really wants the constitutional process to go forward,\\" Kirk said. The senator called Garland \\"one of the most eminent jurists in the country.\\" Democrats have been insisting that the Senate go through the regular confirmation process for Garland, the chief judge of the U.S. Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit. With most public opinion polls showing majorities favoring action on Garland, the Democrats' goal is to force GOP senators to buckle under pressure or make some of them facing re-election pay the price on Election Day. At least 13 Senate Republicans have said they'd be willing to meet with the federal judge, though many said they would tell him that he won't get a vote. Earlier this month, Kirk said on a Chicago radio program that the Senate should \\"man up and cast a vote.\\" Garland has met with seven Democratic senators. The Associated Press contributed to this report. Summary:","output":"On Tuesday, Senator Mark Kirk became the first Republican senator to meet with President Obama's Supreme Court nominee, Merrick Garland.

Moreover, the post highlights Hafez's confidence in Syria's ability to triumph over any invading forces, stating, \\"They don't know our land like we do, no one does, victory is ours in the end no matter how much time it takes.\\" The supposed Facebook page's credibility stems from the numerous people who \\"like\\" it, which allegedly includes other members of the Assad family and the children and grandchildren of high-ranking officials in the country. Nevertheless, the authenticity of the Facebook page remains uncertain. Within the page, \\"Hafez\\" claims to play for Barcelona's soccer team, to have attended Oxford University, and to have previously been in a relationship, which seems unlikely for an 11-year-old. Regardless of whether the page is authentic or not, David Kenner of Foreign Policy argues that the sentiments expressed on it are a plausible representation of the beliefs of the Assad family. The existence of this Facebook page, whether official or not, signals the intensity of emotions surrounding the ongoing Syrian conflict and the complex web of interests at play in the region. With tensions running high, it serves as a reminder that the stakes are elevated, and as a result, any seemingly trivial statement or action from key figures could potentially escalate the situation. While some might dismiss an 11-year-old's views or the legitimacy of such social media posts, the fact that the story has garnered attention from influential publications demonstrates that the potential impact of online activity should not be underestimated."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant that follows instruction extremely well.

The father, in an attempt to save his family, tries to hold the storm cellar door down, but gets sucked into the tornado and killed. Watching in horror are the man's wife and his daughter Jo, who, despite the horror of the storm and losing her father, is entranced by the funnel.The film cuts to the present day and meteorologists at the National Severe Storms Laboratory (NSSL) are discussing a building storm system over Oklahoma which could produce a record outbreak of tornadoes.Meanwhile, retired storm chaser Bill Harding (Bill Paxton) and his fiancée Dr. Melissa Reeves (Jami Gertz) are heading out to meet Bills former storm-chasing team to get the final divorce papers from Bills soon to be ex-wife, Dr. Jo Harding (Helen Hunt) who, since the day her father died, has sworn to hunt down as many tornadoes as possible, not wanting the same fate to happen to someone else. Besides Jo, the team consists of the eccentric Dusty Davis (Philip Seymour Hoffman), Robert Rabbit Nurick (Alan Ruck) navigator, Laurence (Jeremy Davies) photographer, Joey (Joey Slotnick), Alan Sanders (Sean Whalen) Rabbits driver, Tim \\"Beltzer\\" Lewis (Todd Field), Haynes (Wendle Jospeher) who rides with Beltzer, and Jason \\"Preacher\\" Rowe (Scott Thomson).Jo, who is still in love with Bill, tries to stall because she does not want the marriage to end. Jo then tells Bill she wanted him out on the field because his idea for a tornado-analyzing device called 'Dorothy' has been built. They will put it in the path of a tornado to measure it from inside. Four of the so-called \\"Dorothy\\" weather machines have been built. Haynes tells them of storm activity, and they head out. Bills rival team shows up, led by Dr. Jonas Miller (Cary Elwes) with his assistant Eddie (Zach Grenier).According to Bill, Jonas is in the storm-chasing business \\"for the money, not the science.\\" Bill sees Jonas giving an interview to some local reporters and finds out that Jonas has stolen his idea for the... My question: What does the team adds from the soda cans? A:","output":"The team adds aluminum can winglets from the soda cans to the sensors inside \\"Dorothy.\\" These winglets are small, lightweight pieces cut from the aluminum cans, which are then attached to the individual sensors within the weather analyzing device. The purpose of these winglets is to help the sensors become airborne and stay inside the tornado when it comes into contact with \\"Dorothy.\\" By having the sensors be lightweight and easily caught and carried by the powerful winds, it allows the device to collect vital data from inside the tornado for a longer period of time. This data is crucial for the team's research on tornadoes, allowing them to better understand the inner workings of these natural disasters and, in turn, improve early warning systems to save lives. The addition of these soda can winglets is an ingenious and resourceful solution that helps the team overcome a significant obstacle in their mission to collect tornado data."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Paragraph: In Hamburg, Jarrah had a succession of living accommodations, but he apparently never resided with his future co-conspirators. It is not clear how and when he became part of Atta's circle. He became particularly friendly with Binalshibh after meeting him at the Quds mosque in Hamburg, which Jarrah began attending regularly in late 1997. The worshippers at this mosque featured an outspoken, flamboyant Islamist named Mohammed Haydar Zammar. A well-known figure in the Muslim community (and to German and U.S. intelligence agencies by the late 1990s), Zammar had fought in Afghanistan and relished any opportunity to extol the virtues of violent jihad. Indeed, a witness has reported hearing Zammar press Binalshibh to fulfill his duty to wage jihad. Moreover, after 9/11, Zammar reportedly took credit for influencing not just Binalshibh but the rest of the Hamburg group. In 1998, Zammar encouraged them to participate in jihad and even convinced them to go to Afghanistan. Owing to Zammar's persuasion or some other source of inspiration, Atta, Binalshibh, Shehhi, and Jarrah eventually prepared themselves to translate their extremist beliefs into action. By late 1999, they were ready to abandon their student lives in Germany in favor of violent jihad. This final stage in their evolution toward embracing Islamist extremism did not entirely escape the notice of the people around them. The foursome became core members of a group of radical Muslims, often hosting sessions at their Marienstrasse apartment that involved extremely anti-American discussions. Meeting three to four times a week, the group became something of a \\"sect\\" whose members, according to one participant in the meetings, tended to deal only with each other. Atta's rent checks for the apartment provide evidence of the importance that the apartment assumed as a center for the group, as he would write on them the notation \\"Dar el Ansar,\\" or \\"house of the followers.\\" In addition to Atta, Binalshibh, Shehhi, and Jarrah, the group included other extremists, some of whom also would attend al Qaeda training camps and, in some instances, would help the 9/11 hijackers as they executed the plot: Said Bahaji, son of a Moroccan immigrant, was the only German citizen in the group. Educated in Morocco, Bahaji returned to Germany to study electrical engineering at the Technical University of Hamburg-Harburg. He spent five months in the German army before obtaining a medical discharge, and lived with Atta and Binalshibh at 54 Marienstrasse for eight months between November 1998 and July 1999. Described as an insecure follower with no personality and with limited knowledge of Islam, Bahaji nonetheless professed his readiness to engage in violence.  Question: \\"The four became somewhat of a sect meeting 3 to 4 times a week and what was it that Atta would write on the rent checks?\\" Answer: \\"House of the followers\\" Based on the paragraph, is this answer correct","output":"Yes, the answer \\"House of the followers\\" is correct.

orthodox jews of that sect live by the letter of the torah in everything they do and how they subjugate the women to accept their vision of god 's law from only the male 's view . that if they ever got control of the country , their intolerant attitude would subjugate the country the same way the women are . the story takes place in jerusalem 's jewish quarters called mea shearim , where we are taken down sinewy back streets with placards pasted on the walls , and into the crowded apartments and prayer rooms where the protagonists live out their idea of the proper jewish life , which is much different than the way most jews live in israel . this is a controversial film , in that the women are unhappy and the male attitudes are to such an extreme patriarchal ones , that the film is bound to anger most viewers , no matter their belief . it is a slow - moving , meticulous film , that grabs hold of you by the collar and never lets go . the force of what is seen , though filmed in an objective manner , never taking a cheap shot at the hasidim , is nevertheless bound to leave questions about the nature of such a practice of strict observance . the film is meant to be critical of such a rigid people , as it implies how they kill the spirit of everything they touch and with their extreme phobic attitudes , it makes it impossible for them to unite the country when they ca n't at present live in harmony with their own people , and it would be even more impossible to imagine them living with their arab neighbors in peace . the film opens as meir rises at dawn and goes through his prayer ritual , where every prayer is made to the virtues of god . he even thanks god that he did n't make him a woman . his wife rivka accepts the fate she was born into and looks at him from the next bed where she sleeps separately according to hasidic custom . she looks at him with glistening eyes , not questioning the laws or rebelling against her secondary role and how her religion keeps her from studying the talmud and having all the modern conveniences of life , and from seeing movies and tv . meir is a talmudic scholar . his father ( abu warda ) is a rabbi at the yeshiva . he has been married for ten years and his wife has not been able to give him a child . since the hasidim look upon a woman 's role in life being only to conceive children , and cook and clean house for the man , while the man 's role is to spend his time in prayer , therefore there is an insurmountable problem in this otherwise loving marriage . she receives an anonymous letter that states \\" a woman without a child is no better than dead . \\" meir 's response , is that it is written like that in the talmud . meir 's father tells him that the marriage contract must be broken : \\" a man who dies without progeny rips a page from the torah . \\" all the blame is placed on rivka , who is thought of as unpure as the reason for her being barren . she will go through countless ritual baths to cleanse herself , as her rigid mother ( koenig ) dunks her in the holy water and says a ritual prayer for the 12 times she is dunked as an homage to the 12 tribes of israel . their religion does n't permit them to be examined extensively by a doctor . rivka goes on the sly and finds out that it is her husband who is sterile , but she can not tell him that because of their religion . so when meir 's father chooses a younger woman for his son , she is exiled to live alone in a cold apartment in the same jewish quarters . rivka 's spirited younger sister malka does not want to get married but wants to live a more liberated life . she has a long time romantic relationship with a fellow hasidic yaakov . but , because of the way they were both raised , she is still a virgin . when yaakov joined the israeli army to fight in lebanon , something his sect is not allowed to do , he is thereby banished from the sect even though he is still a believer . he now works as a singer in a nightclub . malka 's mother is worried that her daughter wo n't get married , so she arranges with the rabbi for her to marry yossef , someone whom she does n't love . yossef is a very stern follower of the order , he is also a political activist who drives around the city in a sound - truck with a bull - horn urging jews to stick together and fight their godless enemies . the two sisters are close and languidly discuss their options , with rivka telling her sister to accept the marriage , it will make her happy ; but , while malka is reluctantly forced into accepting it , she has other plans to ruin this bogus marriage . the harshest scene in the film is on malka 's wedding night . yossef prays to god for a child and then robotically gets malka to spread her legs , and without the least bit of affection , only a nervousness shown on his part for the function he supplies , as he goes inside her and rams her hard , thrusting away until the act is completed and then retiring without a word or gesture of love . the sisters have choices , like everyone else in life does . but the choices are obliterated by one 's beliefs , circumstances , and inward nature , and how difficult it is to carry out those choices if it goes completely against the way one is brought up . for the sisters , the choices are life or death ones . gitai by closing in on the daily rituals , tight living quarters and close - knit community , has shown how difficult these choices are for those who have never seen another world and have been kept in the dark all their life . the film ends with the forlorn malka walking atop of jerusalem and looking down upon it as an outsider would , and everything seems strange to her , all the things she once thought of as being set in stone are now harsh memories , as she has made her choice , and the price of that choice is very heavy indeed .","output":"N"},{"instruction":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

In the first scenario, where people have access to playing games during holidays, we cannot make the conclusion that they will have to deal with the pain. The provided statement offers an opportunity for those individuals to participate in games (e.g., golf, as suggested by \\"tee off there\\") during their holidays, which can contribute to a more enjoyable and satisfactory experience. In this case, the pain of not having access to games while on holiday could be avoided. However, the second scenario is when people don't have access to playing games during their holidays. In this situation, the conclusion might be more accurate. If a person feels that holidays aren't the same without a game, they may experience disappointment, dissatisfaction, or even emotional pain due to the lack of games or engaging activities. They will, in essence, have to \\"deal with the pain.\\" Given that the statement only provides information about the first scenario and does not clarify whether all people feeling this way will have access to games during their holidays, it is not possible to conclusively determine whether or not they will have to experience the pain. Both situations can exist, and hence we cannot draw a definitive conclusion."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant. You will be given a task. You must generate a detailed and long answer. Q:Generate a question that has the following answer:  By police.  for the following movie plot:  Shane Cooper (Ryan Kwanten), a young police officer, relocates to the small town of Red Hill with his pregnant wife Alice (Claire van der Boom). On his first day on the job, he is shown hostility from Old Bill (Steve Bisley), the head of the police force, for being unable to find his gun and getting shot on duty when he couldn't bring himself to fire his weapon on an armed boy. Shortly afterwards, the police learn that Jimmy Conway (Tom E. Lewis), a convicted murderer who was arrested by Old Bill for killing his wife, has escaped from prison. Knowing that Jimmy will return to town to seek revenge, Old Bill orders his officers and a group of civilians to arm themselves and shoot Jimmy on sight. Old Bill's men prove to be no match for Jimmy, who remorselessly kills officers and armed civilians. The convict encounters Shane but lets him live. When Shane finds Old Bill, he confronts Bill over the fact that Jimmy spared his life and learns that Bill has refused to call for backup from a nearby town. Shane draws his gun on Bill, but again finds himself unable to fire it and is subsequently knocked out and handcuffed to a table. Shane escapes and uses a satellite phone at Gleason's farm to contact the nearby police for backup. During the call Shane discovers Gleason (Cliff Ellen) on the verge of hanging himself; when Shane talks to him, the farmer reveals that Jimmy Conway is innocent of the murder of his wife. The murder was the work of Old Bill and his men, who set fire to Jimmy's house after raping and killing his wife, revenge for Jimmy's interference in a proposed railroad extension that would have gone through Red Hill. Gleason informs Shane that he has a written document of what really happened, before committing suicide. Now knowing the real reason why Jimmy returned to Red Hill, Shane returns home to get his gun, which Alice found while he was on duty. Near the outskirts of town, Old Bill sets stacks of hay on fire to attract Jimmy's attention. Jimmy arrives and kills Bill's last remaining deputies, but is...

The authorities had been closely monitoring the situation, anticipating any possible unrest among the labor force and took swift action to prevent the escalation of the situation. The protest was aimed to take place at one of the city's major industrial zones, with thousands of workers coming together to voice their concerns and dissatisfaction with the current working conditions and policies. Aside from the usual complaints involving low wages and long hours, the workers expressed concerns about safety measures in their workplace and the impact of these conditions on their overall well-being. Upon becoming aware of the plans for the protest, the Beijing police took proactive steps in order to avoid any unwanted incidents. Firstly, law enforcement officers were dispatched to the planned protest site, prepared to handle any disturbances and maintain public order. Additionally, the Beijing police engaged in open dialogue with the workers in an effort to understand their grievances and find a peaceful resolution. By engaging in constructive communication, the police managed to reach a compromise with worker representatives which included the promise of further discussions and potential improvements to the working conditions in the region. This helped to effectively pacify the frustrated workers, ultimately leading to the prevention of the protest. With this successful intervention, the Beijing police have once again demonstrated their commitment to maintaining stability and order within the city. However, the underlying issues that led to the planned protest cannot be ignored. There is a clear need for further dialogue and collaboration between workers, employers, and local authorities to find long-lasting solutions in order to prevent future incidents."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

James Spears, the Great Titan of the chapter, said the group would be rallying to protest “the Confederate flag being took down for all the wrong reasons.”      Story Continued Below      “It’s part of white people’s culture,” he added.      Brian Gaines, who runs the South Carolina Budget and Control Board, which oversees reservations, confirmed the scheduling in an email to POLITICO Monday. He added that the group submitted the request on June 23 and, because his office allows any group, regardless of ideology, to reserve the grounds on a first-come, first-serve basis, the KKK will be able to hold its rally.      The event is planned for July 18 from 3-5 p.m., just over one month after Dylann Roof allegedly entered a historic church in Charleston and shot to death nine African-Americans during a Bible study meeting. Reports indicate Roof was attempting to incite a race war and had read 34 various materials from white supremacist groups online before plotting his crime.      Roof’s use of the Confederate battle flag in photos posted online before the massacre set off a national debate over the flag and other Confederate iconography on public grounds throughout the South — leading South Carolina Gov. Nikki Haley, along with a bipartisan cast of state and federal lawmakers, to call last week for the flag’s removal. The South Carolina Legislature is expected to decide on the Confederate symbol’s fate early next month.      The KKK’s Pelham chapter liberally employs the Confederate flag on its website and has changed its home page to highlight its opposition to the flag’s removal. “Say No to Cultural Genocide,” the group’s site reads, adding, “most groups out there and especially white people are to [sic] cowardly to stand up for their heritage.”      When asked for his opinion on the charges facing Roof, Spears said, “I feel sorry for the boy because of his age and I think he picked the wrong target. A better target for him would have been these gang-bangers, running around rapping, raping and stealing.” ||||| Write a summary.","output":"A man named Dennis Prokopec was arrested because the police think he may have started a fire at his ex-fiancee's house.

Should I validate this answer? A:","output":"While the suggested answer provides valuable information about KFC's global presence, it does not specifically answer your original question: \\"Where is the greatest concentration of KFC in the world?\\"  The mention of KFC being the world's second-largest restaurant chain (in terms of sales) after McDonald's and its having over 18,000 outlets in 120 countries and territories is accurate and informs us about its extensive worldwide presence, but these details do not reveal where the highest concentration of KFC restaurants is. The highest concentration or greatest number of KFC stores can be defined in different ways, such as the most KFC units in a country or the most KFC units per capita.  For instance, if we consider the total number of units or restaurants, the United States, the birthplace of KFC, tops the list. However, China may be the leader when it comes to the number of units and sales volume outside the U.S. If we want to look at the number of KFC units per capita, then small countries with a significant number of KFC outlets, such as Trinidad and Tobago, could be potential candidates. In conclusion, for the verification of the given answer, it falls short of fully addressing the question of the highest concentration of KFC outlets.

It was established in 1998 as the Mitteilungen aus dem Museum für Naturkunde in Berlin, Geowissenschaftliche Reihe and originally published on behalf of the Museum für Naturkunde by Wiley-VCH; since 2014 it has been published by Copernicus Publications. The editors-in-chief are Martin Aberhan, Dieter Korn, and Florian Witzmann (Museum für Naturkunde).  - Eurasia is the combined continental landmass of Europe and Asia. The term is a portmanteau of its constituent continents. Located primarily in the Northern and Eastern Hemispheres, it is bordered by the Atlantic Ocean to the west, the Pacific Ocean to the east, the Arctic Ocean to the north, and by Africa, the Mediterranean Sea, and the Indian Ocean to the south. The division between Europe and Asia as two different continents is a historical and cultural construct, with no clear physical separation between them; thus, in some parts of the world, Eurasia is recognized as the largest of five or six continents. In geology, Eurasia is often considered as a single rigid megablock. However, the rigidity of Eurasia is debated based on the paleomagnet data.  - Naval warfare is combat in and on the sea, the ocean, or any other major body of water such as a large lake or wide river.  - The United States Navy (USN) is the naval warfare service branch of the United States Armed Forces and one of the seven uniformed services of the United States. The U.S. Navy is the largest, most capable navy in the world, with the highest combined battle fleet tonnage. The U.S. Navy has the world's largest aircraft carrier fleet, with ten in service, two in the reserve fleet, and three new carriers under construction. The service has 323,792 personnel on active duty and 108,515 in the Navy Reserve. It has 274 deployable combat vessels and more than 3,700 aircraft in active service .  - The Triassic is a geologic period and system which spans 50.9 million years from the end of the Permian Period million years ago (Mya), to the beginning of the Jurassic Period Mya. The Triassic is the first period of the Mesozoic Era. Both the start and end of the period are marked by major extinction events. The Triassic was named in 1834 by Friedrich von Alberti, after the three distinct rock layers (\\"tri\\" meaning \\"three\\") that are found throughout Germany and northwestern Europered beds, capped by marine limestone, followed by a series of terrestrial mud- and sandstonescalled the \\"Trias\\".  - The United States Armed Forces are the federal armed forces of the United States. They consist of the Army, Marine Corps, Navy, Air Force, and Coast Guard. The President of the United States is the military's overall head, and helps form military policy with the U.S. Department of Defense (DoD), a federal executive department, acting as the principal organ by which military policy is carried out. From the time of its inception, the military played a decisive role in the history of the United States. A sense of national unity and identity was forged as a result of victory in the First Barbary War and the Second Barbary War. Even so, the Founders were suspicious of a permanent military force. It played an important role in the American Civil War, where leading generals on both sides were picked from members of the United States military. Not until the outbreak of World War II did a large standing army become officially established. The National Security Act of 1947, adopted following World War II and during the Cold War's onset, created the modern U.S. military framework; the Act merged previously Cabinet-level Department of War and the Department of the Navy into the National Military Establishment (renamed the Department of Defense in 1949), headed by the Secretary of Defense; and created the Department of the Air Force and National Security Council.  - A reserve fleet is a collection of naval vessels of all types that are fully equipped for service but are not currently needed, and thus partially or fully decommissioned. A reserve fleet is informally said to be \\"in mothballs\\" or \\"mothballed\\"; an equivalent expression in unofficial modern U.S. naval usage is \\"ghost fleet\\". In earlier times, and especially in British usage, these ships were said to be \\"laid up in ordinary\\".  - An aircraft carrier is a warship that serves as a seagoing airbase, equipped with a full-length flight deck and facilities for carrying, arming, deploying, and recovering aircraft. Typically, it is the capital ship of a fleet, as it allows a naval force to project air power worldwide without depending on local bases for staging aircraft operations. Aircraft carriers are expensive to build and are critical assets. Carriers have evolved since their inception in the early twentieth century from wooden vessels used to deploy balloons to nuclear-powered warships that carry numerous fighter planes, strike aircraft, helicopters, and other types of aircraft.   - Sturgeon is the common name for the 27 species of fish belonging to the family Acipenseridae. Their evolution dates back to the Triassic some 245 to 208 million years ago. The family is grouped into four genera: \\"Acipenser\\", \\"Huso\\", \\"Scaphirhynchus\\" and \\"Pseudoscaphirhynchus\\". Four species may now be extinct. Two closely related species, \\"Polyodon spathula\\" (paddlefish) and \\"Psephurus gladius\\" (Chinese paddlefish, possibly extinct) are of the same order, Acipenseriformes, but are in the family Polyodontidae and are not considered to be \\"true\\" sturgeons. Both sturgeons and paddlefish have been referred to as \\"primitive fishes\\" because their morphological characteristics have remained relatively unchanged since the earliest fossil record. Sturgeons are native to subtropical, temperate and sub-Arctic rivers, lakes and coastlines of Eurasia and North America.  Sturgeons are long-lived, late-maturing fishes with distinctive characteristics, such as a heterocercal caudal fin similar to that of sharks, and an elongated spindle-like body that is smooth-skinned, scaleless and armored with 5 lateral rows of bony plates called scutes. Several species can grow quite large, typically ranging 712 feet (2-3 m) in length. The largest sturgeon on record was a Beluga female captured in the Volga estuary in 1827, weighing and long. Most sturgeons are anadromous bottom-feeders which migrate upstream to spawn but spend most of their lives feeding in river deltas and estuaries. Some species inhabit freshwater environments exclusively while others primarily inhabit marine environments near coastal areas, and are known to venture into open ocean.  - Scaphirhynchus is a genus of sturgeons native to the United States of America. All species in this genus are considered to be threatened. The pallid sturgeon is Endangered and the Alabama sturgeon is Critically Endangered.  - Acipenseriformes is an order of basal ray-finned fishes that includes the sturgeons and paddlefishes, as well as some extinct families.  - An aircraft is a machine that is able to fly by gaining support from the air. It counters the force of gravity by using either static lift or by using the dynamic lift of an airfoil, or in a few cases the downward thrust from jet engines.  - The lead ship, name ship, or class leader is the first of a series or class of ships all constructed according to the same general design. The term is applicable to military ships and larger civilian craft.  - In biology, a common name of a taxon or organism (also known as a vernacular name, English name, colloquial name, trivial name, trivial epithet, country name, popular name, or farmer's name) is a name that is based on the normal language of everyday life; this kind of name is often contrasted with the scientific name for the same organism, which is Latinized. A common name is sometimes frequently used, but that is by no means always the case.  - Pseudoscaphirhynchus is a genus of fishes in the Acipenseridae family. The three species, all of which are threatened, are restricted to Central Asia.  - FOSSIL is a standard protocol for allowing serial communication for telecommunications programs under the DOS operating system. FOSSIL is an acronym for \\"Fido Opus SEAdog Standard Interface Layer\\". \\"Fido\\" refers to FidoBBS, \\"Opus\\" refers to Opus-CBCS BBS, and \\"SEAdog\\" refers to a Fidonet compatible mailer. The standards document that defines the FOSSIL protocol is maintained by the Fidonet Technical Standards Committee.  - USS Sturgeon ( SSN - 637 ) , the lead ship of her class of nuclear - powered attack submarines , was the third ship of the United States Navy to be named for the sturgeon .  - The United States of America has seven federal uniformed services that commission officers as defined by Title 10, and subsequently structured and organized by Title 10, Title 14, Title 32 and Title 42 of the United States Code.  - A ship is a large buoyant watercraft. Ships are generally distinguished from boats based on size, shape and cargo or passenger capacity. Ships are used on lakes, seas, rivers, and oceans for a variety of activities, such as the transport of people or goods, fishing, entertainment, public safety, and warfare. Historically, a \\"ship\\" was a sailing vessel with at least three square-rigged masts and a full bowsprit.  - North America is a continent entirely within the Northern Hemisphere and almost all within the Western Hemisphere. It can also be considered a northern subcontinent of the Americas. It is bordered to the north by the Arctic Ocean, to the east by the Atlantic Ocean, to the west and south by the Pacific Ocean, and to the southeast by South America and the Caribbean Sea.

Pneumonia, in some cases, can quickly spread from one sheep to another and result in deaths. Take the afflicted sheep and put them in a quarantine separate from the rest of the herd making sure they do not share grazing land, food, or water supplies.","output":"Monitoring the sheep's condition closely  Keep a close eye on the sheep's behavior, respiratory rate, temperature, and overall activity level. Normal temperature for sheep ranges from 102°F to 104°F (38.8°C to 40°C); a higher temperature usually indicates an infection. Other symptoms to monitor can include coughing, rapid or labored breathing, nasal discharge, and a decrease in appetite. Additionally, observe for potential secondary infections that may arise due to a suppressed immune system. Administer antibiotics and supportive care as recommended  Consult a veterinarian to complete an examination, diagnose pneumonia, and recommend treatment options, which may include administering antibiotics and anti-inflammatory medications. Follow the vet's prescription strictly and administer the drugs at the correct dosage and frequency to maximize their effectiveness. For supportive care, you can provide extra care like ensuring the quarantined sheep has a clean, dry, comfortable, and well-ventilated space for rest, which can help prevent further respiratory distress. Ensure proper nutrition and hydration  Pneumonic sheep may lose their appetite and may not eat as much as they should be. Monitor their food intake and provide them with fresh, high-quality hay, and easily digestible food that does not require them to consume bulky amounts. Proper hydration is crucial, so maintain a reliable water source that is clean and easily accessible for the sick sheep.  Supplement additional vitamins and minerals  With consultation from your veterinarian, consider giving the sick sheep vitamin and mineral supplements to boost their immune system and improve the chances of a successful recovery. Vitamin E and selenium are crucial for sheep's immune health and can be supplemented when approved by a vet. Check and maintain proper barn ventilation  Environment plays a significant role in the development of pneumonia, as sheep can become susceptible to pathogens from poor air quality, excessive dust or ammonia levels, and high humidity. Ensure your barn or shelter is well-ventilated and clean, creating optimal living conditions for your sheep. Regularly remove any buildup of feces and damp bedding. Keep a close watch on the rest of the flock  Despite removing the sick sheep from the herd, it is still essential to monitor the rest of the flock for similar signs and symptoms. Take preventive measures, maintain proper hygiene, sterilize feeding supplies, and promptly remove a sick sheep if any more pneumonia cases arise. Follow-up with the veterinarian  After providing proper care and medication for a prescribed period, you must follow up with your veterinarian for further evaluation. The vet may perform a physical examination and, if necessary, additional diagnostic tests to confirm the sheep's recovery and ensure it is safe to reintegrate the healed sheep back into the flock. Implement preventive measures  To reduce the chances of a future occurrence of pneumonia amongst your flock, maintain proper vaccinations and deworming, provide good living conditions, avoid excessive exposure to dust, and ensure proper ventilation. Regular health checks and keeping an eye on any changes in behavior can further aid in early detection and prompt treatment to avoid severe consequences for your flock."},{"instruction":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

By March 2011, the market share of OS X in North America had increased to slightly over 14%. Whether the size of the Mac's market share and installed base is relevant, and to whom, is a hotly debated issue. Industry pundits have often called attention to the Mac's relatively small market share to predict Apple's impending doom, particularly in the early and mid-1990s when the company's future seemed bleakest. Others argue that market share is the wrong way to judge the Mac's success. Apple has positioned the Mac as a higher-end personal computer, and so it may be misleading to compare it to a budget PC. Because the overall market for personal computers has grown rapidly, the Mac's increasing sales numbers are effectively swamped by the industry's expanding sales volume as a whole. Apple's small market share, then, gives the impression that fewer people are using Macs than did ten years ago, when exactly the opposite is true. Soaring sales of the iPhone and iPad mean that the portion of Apple's profits represented by the Macintosh has declined in 2010, dropping to 24% from 46% two years earlier. Others try to de-emphasize market share, citing that it is rarely brought up in other industries. Regardless of the Mac's market share, Apple has remained profitable since Steve Jobs' return and the company's subsequent reorganization. Notably, a report published in the first quarter of 2008 found that Apple had a 14% market share in the personal computer market in the US, including 66% of all computers over 1,000. Market research indicates that Apple draws its customer base from a higher-income demographic than the mainstream personal computer market.

U.S. Olympic swimmers Gunnar Bentz (R) and Jack Conger are mobbed by the media and onlookers while leaving the police station after questioning in Rio de Janiero. (Photo: Chris McGrath/Getty)      RIO DE JANEIRO — A day after leaving Brazil, American swimmer Gunnar Bentz offered an apology for his role in a late-night incident that drew international attention after teammate Ryan Lochte claimed they had been robbed at gunpoint and local police called that a fabrication.      But Bentz also said surveillance videos from the gas station where the incident occurred appear to be missing camera angles and scenes that support the four U.S. swimmers' accounts. And he supported Lochte's account that money was demanded from the swimmers at gunpoint before they were allowed to leave.      In a statement released by the University of Georgia, where Bentz is a junior, he provided details of the account he gave Rio police after he and teammate Jack Conger were pulled off a plane on Wednesday and prevented from leaving the country.      Bentz' version largely supports what Lochte has asserted about the swimmers being in a cab that was approached by armed men who flashed a badge and pointed guns at them, but his statement also rejected Lochte's initial version. And Bentz was critical of Lochte, who Bentz said got into a “heated verbal exchange” with security guards.      “Without question, I am taking away a valuable life lesson from this situation,” Bentz wrote in a statement where he apologized to the U.S. Olympic Committee, USA Swimming, Team USA athletes and the university. “In everything I do, I am representing my family, my country and my school,” he said. “I will not take that responsibility lightly.”      In his statement, Bentz admits the swimmers, who had been drinking at a party and were on their way back to the Olympic Village, stopped at a gas station to use the restroom but instead relieved themselves behind the building. Bentz said Lochte was the one who “pulled to the ground a framed metal advertisement that was loosely anchored to the brick wall.”      Vandalism denied      Bentz said he did not see anyone trash the restroom at the station, or even enter it. Fernando Veloso, Rio's chief of police, had said the swimmers vandalized the station's restroom – allegedly breaking open the door, causing damage to a mirror and ripping a soap dispenser off the wall.      \\"There was a locked door out back and I did not witness anyone breaking it open,\\" Bentz said. Bentz said there was no damage to the restroom to the best of his knowledge.

USA TODAY      After the four men had returned to the vehicle, according to Bentz’s account, two men approached the vehicle and told them to get out. As Conger and Jimmy Feigen walked away, a security guard held up his badge and drew his handgun, Bentz said.      Bentz said he called his teammates back, and a second guard pointed his gun at the swimmers.      \\"Again, I cannot speak to his actions, but Ryan stood up and began to yell at the guards,” Bentz said. “After Jack and I both tugged at him in an attempt to get him to sit back down, Ryan and the security guards had a heated verbal exchange, but no physical contact was made.”      Bentz’s statement aligned with that of a witness, Fernando Deluz, a disc jockey who told the Globo television network that he became an impromptu translator. Deluz said the only discussions between the swimmers and the guards were about minor damage — the sign that was knocked off a wall.      Bentz said through an interpreter, one of the guards holding a gun on them demanded that the swimmers pay for knocking the sign down to be allowed to leave. He said he gave them 20 and Feigen gave them 100 Reals, which is about 33.      “They lowered the guns and I used hand gestures to ask if it was okay to leave and they said yes,” he said.      Incomplete videos      Bentz stressed that he was never a suspect in the matter and that he has not made any false statements to Rio authorities.      Bentz’s account refutes Lochte’s original story that the taxi the swimmers were riding in was pulled over. But it closely matches the version Lochte gave on Wednesday to NBC's Matt Lauer, as it appears on the video that the guards did stop the cabbie from pulling away. Lochte said when the cabbie refused to go and the armed men approached the car, he thought they were being robbed, Lauer said .      Bentz’s statement also refutes one by Veloso that two women were with the swimmers. Bentz said the swimmers and driver were the only ones in the cab.      Bentz also questioned whether the videos released so far show a complete account of what happened.      “Videos of this situation have been emerging the last several days” he said. “However, I am confident that some video angles have not been shown that would further substantiate my account. I also believe some scenes have been skipped over.”      PHOTOS: Every U.S. medal won at Rio Olympics ||||| (CNN) The following is a statement from U.S. Olympic swimmer Gunnar Bentz released by the University of Georgia on Friday. (Bentz's statement was released hours after fellow Olympian Ryan Lochte apologized for his behavior over the weekend at a Rio de Janeiro gas station.)      \\"I want to offer a sincere apology to the United States Olympic Committee, USA Swimming, the extraordinary women and men of Team USA, and the University of Georgia. Being a member of the Olympic Swimming Team was an honor and a dream come true. The accomplishments of my teammates were awe-inspiring and I'm so pleased I got to see them up close. I regret this situation has drawn attention away from the Olympics, which have been hosted so incredibly well by Brazil and its citizens.      \\"While I am anxious to put this matter behind me and rejoin my Georgia teammates in classes, practices and competitions, I feel compelled to stress several key points.      1. I was never a suspect in the case from the beginning (Brazilian law enforcement officials saw me only as a witness).      2. I never made a false statement to anyone at any time.      \\"I also want to be forthright about the details of what transpired last Sunday. What follows is consistent with the account I gave to the Brazilian authorities when I was interviewed for the first and only time on Thursday in Rio de Janeiro:      \\"After attending an event with several swimmers from different nations, I left in a taxicab along with U.S. swimmers Jack Conger, Jimmy Feigen and Ryan Lochte around 6 a.m. On the way back to the Olympic Village, we pulled into a convenience store to use the restroom. There was no restroom inside, so we foolishly relieved ourselves on the backside of the building behind some bushes. There was a locked door out back and I did not witness anyone breaking it open. I am unsure why, but while we were in that area, Ryan pulled to the ground a framed metal advertisement that was loosely anchored to the brick wall. I then suggested to everyone that we needed to leave the area and we returned to the taxi.      \\"Two men, whom I believe to have been security guards, then instructed us to exit the vehicle. No guns were drawn during this exchange, but we did see a gun tucked into one of the guard's waistband. As Jimmy and Jack were walking away from the vehicle, the first security guard held up a badge to me and drew his handgun. I yelled to them to come back toward us and they complied. Then the second guard drew his weapon and both guards pointed their guns at us and yelled at us to sit on a nearby sidewalk.      \\"Again, I cannot speak to his actions, but Ryan stood up and began to yell at the guards. After Jack and I both tugged at him in an attempt to get him to sit back down, Ryan and the security guards had a heated verbal exchange, but no physical contact was made.      \\"A man that I believe to be a customer approached us and offered to help as he spoke both English and Portuguese. Understandably, we were frightened and confused during this time. Through the interpreter, one of the guards said that we needed to pay them in order to leave. I gave them what I had in my wallet, which was a 20 bill, and Jimmy gave them 100 Reals, which is about 50 in total. They lowered the guns and I used hand gestures to ask if it was okay to leave and they said yes. We walked about a block down the street and hailed another taxi to return to the Village.      \\"Videos of this situation have been emerging the last several days. However, I am confident that some video angles have not been shown that would further substantiate my account. I also believe some scenes have been skipped over. Additionally, I would like to stress that our original taxi was not pulled over; the only occupants of the taxi were the four of us and the driver; and to my knowledge, there was no damage done to the door or the inside of the restroom.      \\"I am so thankful for the love and support of my family, my friends and my teammates during this time. Without question, I am taking away a valuable life lesson from this situation. In everything I do, I am representing my family, my country and my school. I will not take that responsibility lightly.\\" ||||| What is a shorter version of the above article?","output":"Gunnar Bentz, an American swimmer, has apologized for his role in a late-night incident where teammate Ryan Lochte claimed they were robbed at gunpoint, but the local police called that a lie.

Given the question: Question: what causes photo red eye I found the following answer on Google: The effect appears in the eyes of humans and animals that have tapetum lucidum . Is that a correct answer? Yes or no. The answer is:","output":"Yes, the answer you found on Google is partially correct, but it is not complete. Photo red-eye is a phenomenon that occurs in photography when light from the camera flash reflects off the retinas of human or animal subjects, causing their eyes to appear red or glowing in the captured image. The tapetum lucidum is a layer of reflective tissue found in the eyes of many nocturnal animals, which contributes to improved night vision by allowing the light to be reabsorbed by the photoreceptor cells. When a camera flash illuminates the eyes, the light reflects off the tapetum lucidum as well as the blood vessels in the retinas, creating the red-eye effect. However, the red-eye effect is not solely due to the presence of the tapetum lucidum, as humans do not have this reflective layer and still experience red-eye in photos. The primary cause of red-eye in humans is the reflection of light from the camera flash off the blood-rich retina at the back of the eye. Several factors can contribute to the red-eye effect: 1. Pupil size: In low-light conditions, the pupils dilate to allow more light to enter the eye. When the camera flash is bright and sudden, the pupils do not have enough time to constrict, causing more light to be reflected off the retina and resulting in the red-eye effect. 2. Angle of the flash: If the camera flash is positioned close to the lens and aimed directly at the subject's eyes, the chances of red-eye occurring are higher. To minimize red-eye, ensure the flash is at an angle to the subject or use an external flash that can be positioned away from the camera lens. 3. Camera settings and features: Many cameras offer red-eye reduction features that emit a brief pre-flash or series of flashes before capturing the photo. This causes the subject's pupils to constrict, thereby reducing the amount of light that can be reflected off the retina. 4. Distance to the subject: Red-eye is more likely to occur when the subject is close to the camera, as the amount of reflected light that reaches the camera sensor is higher. To minimize the red-eye effect, photographers can utilize red-eye reduction features, adjust camera angles, use off-camera or bounce flash, or increase the ambient light in the scene. Additionally, photo editing software can often be used to correct red-eye after the image has been captured."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant. You will be given a task.

Q:Process:  - The blood sugar drops in a body - Cells in the pancrease release glucagon - The liver in response turns the glucagon into glucose - And releases it into the blood - The blood sugar levels are restored.  Perturbation hypothesis: suppose blood sugar increases happens, how will it affect more glucose is made.  Does the supposed perturbation have an effect (direct or indirect) on the process? A:","output":"When blood sugar increases, the pancreas and liver go through a different process than the one described in the original process, but the perturbation does have a direct effect on the overall regulation of blood glucose levels in the body. Here's an overview of the process when blood sugar increases: 1. Blood sugar levels rise, such as after consuming a meal with carbohydrates. 2. The increased blood sugar is detected by cells in the pancreas called beta cells. 3. In response, these beta cells release a hormone called insulin. 4. Insulin helps cells in the body to take up the glucose from the blood for use as energy or for storage as glycogen or fat. 5. As cells take in glucose, blood sugar levels reduce back to normal. Now, addressing the perturbation hypothesis: If blood sugar increases, more glucose is not directly synthesized from glucagon, as that would counteract the body's efforts to bring blood sugar levels back down. However, this situation does indirectly affect the overall glucose regulation process and emphasizes the importance of the balance between insulin and glucagon. Insulin and glucagon work in tandem to maintain blood glucose levels within a normal range. When blood sugar increases, insulin lowers it by promoting glucose uptake by cells. Conversely, when blood sugar drops, glucagon raises it by stimulating the liver to convert stored glycogen into glucose, which is then released into the bloodstream. In summary, the supposed perturbation has a direct effect on the blood glucose regulation process, but not on the original process involving glucagon. When blood sugar increases, the body utilizes insulin to lower blood sugar levels rather than creating more glucose from glucagon. The balance between insulin and glucagon helps maintain stable blood sugar levels in the body."},{"instruction":"You are a teacher.

This is especially true for the home run records, which have witnessed some of the biggest moments in baseball history. One such memorable milestone is Mark McGwire's impressive single-season home run record, which was eventually surpassed by an equally talented and dedicated athlete - Barry Bonds. Mark McGwire's 1998 Major League Baseball Season Mark McGwire, playing as a first baseman for the St. Louis Cardinals in the 1998 MLB season, went on an extraordinary home run rampage that year. He was locked into a fierce competition for the home run title with Sammy Sosa of the Chicago Cubs. McGwire finished the season with a staggering 70 home runs, breaking the previous record of 61 held by Roger Maris since 1961. McGwire's record-breaking home run came on September 8, 1998, when he hit a low pitch off Chicago Cubs pitcher Steve Trachsel. With that single swing, he etched his name in the history books and became an instant legend. The competition with Sosa, dubbed the \\"Home Run Race of 1998,\\" is widely credited with reviving interest in Major League Baseball following the 1994 strike. Barry Bonds: The Man Who Broke the Record While Mark McGwire basked in the glory of his record-setting performance, a powerful force was emerging on the baseball horizon – a left fielder for the San Francisco Giants named Barry Bonds. Bonds had already built a reputation as one of the best hitters of his generation. He was a 3-time National League MVP, a multiple Gold Glove, and Silver Slugger Award winner, and a 12-time All-Star. Entering the 2001 Major League Baseball season, there was a palpable sense that Bonds might have what it takes to challenge and even surpass McGwire's home run record. As the season progressed, Bonds started building up momentum, hitting home runs with incredible regularity. The Turning Point: September 2001 In the final month of the season, Bonds was swinging for the fences like a man on a mission, amassing home runs at an unprecedented pace. On October 5, 2001, in a game against the Los Angeles Dodgers, Bonds broke the single-season home run record with his 71st homer of the year. Bonds didn't stop there – by the season's end, he'd hit an astonishing 73 home runs, shattering McGwire's record by a wide margin. His performance earned him his fourth National League MVP award, solidifying his place in the pantheon of baseball greats."},{"instruction":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

Fill the container with water: Pour cold, filtered water into the container until it's full. It's important to use filtered water to avoid any impurities that may affect the taste and quality of your lime water. 4. Stir the mixture: Use a long spoon or stirrer to gently mix the lime slices with the water. This helps to distribute the lime flavor throughout the water more evenly and ensures better infusion. 5. Refrigerate the lime water: Allow the lime water to chill in the refrigerator for at least 2-4 hours. This gives the lime flavor enough time to infuse into the water. For a more intense lime flavor, you can let it sit overnight. 6. Serve the lime water: When you're ready to enjoy your lime water, pour it into a glass with ice, and if desired, add a splash of sparkling water for a refreshing twist. You may also garnish your glass with a fresh lime wedge or a sprig of mint. 7. Store leftover lime water: Keep any remaining lime water in the refrigerator, covered with a lid or plastic wrap. For the best flavor and freshness, consume the lime water within 1-2 days. In addition to being a refreshing and delicious drink, lime water also has numerous health benefits. It's a great source of vitamin C, which helps boost your immune system and supports healthy skin. Lime water also aids digestion, reduces inflammation, and may even help with weight loss. Enjoy this delightful beverage as part of a balanced diet and reap the benefits of its invigorating taste and health-promoting properties."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

A: Options: [+] kinetic; [+] homeostasis; [+] pulmonary; [+] osmotic; A:","output":"Salts are important in maintaining the osmotic balance of the blood. Osmotic balance refers to the regulation of the movement of water and solutes across cell membranes to maintain stable concentrations of electrolytes, salts, and other substances within the body. This balance is crucial for the proper functioning of cells, tissues, and organs.

Question 1: If an 'empty' space is a superfluid and you rolled a bowling ball through it, would it roll on forever as it moves through and displaces the superfluid? Question 2: In space, if I turn ON a Fan and then turn it OFF, will the blades keep rotating forever? Would the answer to these two questions be the same?","output":"Okay, let's break these down one by one, painted with the colors of a 5-year-old's imagination.  Question 1: Imagine you have a toy truck and a big tub of honey. If you try to move the truck through the honey, it would be hard, right? But if that honey was magic, and let things pass through without stopping them, your truck would slide all along without stopping. It's kind of the same with a 'superfluid' and the bowling ball: a superfluid is like magic honey, allowing things to slide forever without slowing down! Question 2: Picture again your toy fan. You set it spinning and then stop giving it power, does it spin forever? Well, on Earth it doesn't, because air (which is invisible) slows it down, and so does the friction in the fan's parts. But if you were playing in space, which doesn't have air like earth, and if there was no friction, your fan might just go on spinning, because there's nothing to slow it down! So, to answer your final question, the superfluid and space situation are similar but not exactly the same. What's common in both scenarios though, is the lack of things (like air or friction) that normally stop or slow down things from moving, so that's why the bowling ball could roll on forever in superfluid and the fan blades could keep spinning forever in space."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant. User will you give you a task. Your goal is to complete the task as faithfully as you can. While performing the task think step-by-step and justify your steps. How do you do this: Make pop corn.","output":"To make popcorn, follow these step-by-step instructions: Step 1: Gather necessary ingredients and utensils. - You will need popcorn kernels, cooking oil (vegetable, canola, or coconut oil), a large heavy-bottomed pot with a lid, salt or desired seasonings, and measuring spoons. Step 2: Measure and heat the oil. - Pour about 2-3 tablespoons of cooking oil into the pot. This amount should be enough to lightly cover the bottom of the pot. Heat the oil over medium heat. Be cautious not to set the heat too high to avoid burning the oil. Step 3: Test the oil temperature. - To ensure the oil is hot enough, drop one or two popcorn kernels into the pot and cover it with the lid. When you hear those kernels pop, the oil is ready for the rest of the popcorn kernels. Step 4: Add popcorn kernels. - Measure 1/3 to 1/2 cup of popcorn kernels, depending on how much popcorn you'd like to make. Remember that the popcorn will expand significantly as it pops, so adjust the amount accordingly. Carefully pour the kernels into the hot oil and use a spoon to distribute them evenly across the bottom of the pot. Step 5: Cover and shake the pot. - Once the kernels are in the pot, quickly place the lid on top. Using potholders or oven mitts to protect your hands, gently shake the pot back and forth while holding the lid to ensure the kernels are evenly coated with oil and heat. This will help the popcorn cook more evenly and prevent burning. Step 6: Listen for popping sounds. - As the popcorn kernels heat up, they will begin to pop. Continue shaking the pot back and forth occasionally as the popping continues. When the popping sound begins to slow down significantly or has a few seconds in between pops, it's time to remove the pot from heat. Step 7: Remove the pot from heat and wait. - Take the pot off the stove and let it sit for about 30 seconds, allowing any remaining kernels to pop. Keep the lid on to prevent any stray kernels from flying out. Step 8: Season and enjoy. - Carefully remove the lid from the pot, allowing any trapped steam to escape. Be cautious not to burn yourself with the steam. Season the popcorn with salt or any desired seasonings and gently shake or mix to evenly distribute the flavoring. Serve the popcorn in a large bowl and enjoy!"},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant. You will be given a task. You must generate a detailed and long answer. Read the following context and answer the question. Context: I was lucky enough to get three acne skincare packs from Aphelia Cosmetology for guest reviewers with acne to trial for me. I think that this is important because the treatment of acne is such a personalised journey that it is good to hear about the results of the skincare from a variety of people. In the third review of this series, Nalini from The Made Up Maiden has reviewed this acne set for me. Nalini is 30 and has troublesome skin. She has tried many products to fix it without a lot of luck. Here is Nalini's review: I've always thought the journey to clear skin can be quite a complicated one. There are just so many things that affect the condition of your skin; genetics, skincare, diet, hormones, weather, stress...the list is endless. In my case, both parents had acne when they were younger, and I had hopes that my acne would fade once I left my teens. My skin isn't completely horrendous, but I do have some minimal scarring on my cheeks (which goes away after a little while), and the odd large pimple on my chin during those hormonal times, which goes away after a while but is still really frustrating when it happens! I'm 30 years old, so it looks like these problems are here to stay. I have contemplated taking hormonal pills or medication aimed at reducing acne, but decided that the possible side effects haven't really been worth the benefit. As a result, I was really keen to explore the Aphelia Cosmetology range and see if it lives up to the promise of helping with acne troubled skin. I would classify my skin as combination, the t-zone gets a little oily towards midday, while the rest of my skin is pretty much classified as 'normal'. I received the following items.

Your goal is to complete the task as faithfully as you can. While performing the task think step-by-step and justify your steps. Given the background: Catalytic converters in cars increase the rates of several important reactions. Unburned hydrocarbons can more easily be converted to carbon dioxide and water in the presence of a catalyst. Additionally, carbon monoxide (a harmful gas produced by incomplete combustion of fuel) is further oxidized to carbon dioxide, and nitrous oxide compounds (which contribute to smog and acid rain) are transformed back into nitrogen and oxygen gases. By passing car exhaust over these catalysts before their release into the air, the emissions from a combustion engine are made into much less harmful substances, resulting in a much cleaner atmosphere.  and the situation: John is an automotive enthusiast. He was visiting the auto show in his city. Two cars caught his attention, car A and car B. Car A was newer and it had catalytic converter. On the contrary, car B was older and didn't have catalytic converter. But he found the design of older car more attractive.  Answer the following question: Which car would emit less unburned hydrocarbons, car A or car B?","output":"To determine which car emits less unburned hydrocarbons, we need to consider the presence of the catalytic converter in the cars. Step 1: Identify the key difference between the two cars - In this case, it is the presence of a catalytic converter in car A and the lack of one in car B. Step 2: Understand the function of a catalytic converter in relation to unburned hydrocarbons - A catalytic converter helps convert unburned hydrocarbons into less harmful substances, such as carbon dioxide and water. Step 3: Compare the two cars based on the information - Since car A has a catalytic converter and car B does not, it is logical to conclude that car A would more effectively convert unburned hydrocarbons, reducing their emissions. Based on these steps, Car A would emit less unburned hydrocarbons compared to car B due to the presence of a catalytic converter, which helps to convert such emissions into less harmful substances."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Five of the country's leading internet service providers (ISPs) are taking part in the Copyright Alert System (CAS), which they say is designed to educate rather than punish users. Suspected persistent copyright infringers will receive six warnings, after which their internet access may be limited but not cut off. Campaigners are calling for an independent body to oversee the scheme. One group, called Demand Progress, has warned that ISPs \\"want to serve as judge, jury, and executioner\\". But organisers have indicated that once users received six alerts they would be considered outside the system. In other words, they are unwilling to change their behaviour, so nothing else would be done. The scheme was supposed to launch last year, but organisers announced a last-minute delay, which they blamed on Hurricane Sandy disrupting final tests. Verizon, Time Warner, Cablevision, Comcast and AT&T are all taking part in the initiative, which is co-ordinated by the Center For Copyright Information (CCI) - a group representing rights holders in the media industries. \\"Over the course of the next several days... our content partners will begin sending notices of alleged peer-to-peer copyright infringement to ISPs, and the ISPs will begin forwarding those notices in the form of copyright alerts to consumers,\\" announced the CCI's executive director Jill Lesser. \\"Consumers whose accounts have been used to share copyrighted content over P2P networks illegally (or without authority) will receive alerts that are meant to educate rather than punish, and direct them to legal alternatives. And for those consumers who believe they received alerts in error, an easy-to-use process will be in place for them to seek independent review of the alerts they received.\\" The ISPs are being left to determine their own responses to users who either ignore six warnings or fail to challenge the evidence against them and it is not yet clear exactly how each will act. Verizon initially said in a FAQ that it would slow users' access speed down to 256Kbps, \\"a little faster than typical dial-up speed\\" for up to three days - but later deleted the information from its site. The original version can still be read via a snapshot Google took of the page. A spokeswoman was unable to explain the change at this time. Time Warner said it planned to limit internet access to a pop-up showing a telephone number which the user must call. After a conversation with a customer service representative their service would be restored, it said. AT&T said it would require its uses to \\"review materials on an online portal that will educate them on the distribution of copyrighted content online\\" after four alerts before they could continue to use the internet. \\"Because customer privacy is paramount, we will not share or release our customers' names or other personally identifiable information to the content owners,\\" Brent Olson, AT&T's vice president of public policy added. The Electronic Frontier Foundation (EFF) has raised several concerns about the scheme. It notes that the CCI states that \\"subscribers are responsible for making sure their internet account is not used for copyright infringement\\" and that the ISPs urge users to restrict access to their wi-fi connections. \\"This seems designed to undermine the open wi-fi movement,\\" said the EFF, referring to efforts to encourage users to share their wi-fi connections with others. It is suggested that free internet access can make locations more tourist-friendly and aid the emergency services. \\"Open wireless is widely recognised to be tremendously beneficial to the public.\\" It added that it believed an independent body should vet the process. Meanwhile the UK has favoured a proposed \\"three strikes\\" policy. Under telecom regulator Ofcom's draft code, users who receive three warnings within 12 months would have anonymous information about their activities passed to copyright holders which could then seek court orders to discover their identities. The policy had been due to come into effect in March 2014, but has been delayed after a House of Lords committee queried whether the Digital Economy Act - which the code is part of - complied with Treasury rules. The government subsequently withdrew the legislation. A spokesman for the Department for Culture Media and Sport said it would \\"reintroduce the statutory instrument as soon as possible\\". The first warning letters are unlikely to sent before the second half of 2014 as a consequence.

The green, red and white of the Mexican flag will be everywhere as tens of thousands of Mexican-Americans and other Chicagoans gather to celebrate the Fifth of May or Cinco de Mayo. That is the day the Mexican army defeated the French invasion against all the odds in the Battle of Puebla in 1862. In Pilsen, they will mark the occasion with a parade of elaborate floats, mariachis, local beauty queens and talented horsemen. And, being a celebration of Mexico, you'll be able to find good food, music and chelas (beer). Particularly the beers. \\"In Chicago, the Cinco de Mayo is a marketing ploy to sell alcohol,\\" says Vincent Rangel, the President of the Mexican Civic Association of Illinois, and long-time resident of the city. \\"I've been in Chicago for 63 years, and we're dumbfounded at how the date has taken on a life of its own. Especially when you consider that it's really not celebrated in Mexico, unless you're actually from Puebla.\\" That, says Mr Rangel, is the great irony of the raucous Cinco de Mayo party in the United States: it's a far bigger affair north of the border than it is in Mexico itself. These days, it has an important political dimension too. President Barack Obama celebrated the Cinco de Mayo with a group of prominent Hispanic leaders on the Rose Lawn. They were served tuna ceviche and lamb in tamarind mole as President Obama used the occasion to garner support for the Dream Act, a bill to grant legal status to undocumented young people. Meanwhile in Mexico City, the day is likely to pass off like any other Saturday. Few bars will be doing anything out of the ordinary, and there is no sense that this is the \\"Day of Mexican Pride\\" as it has been dubbed in the United States. Apart from in one particular neighbourhood towards Mexico City's international airport, Penon de los Banos. Here, the recreation of the Battle of Puebla has been held for decades and all day the small barrio will reverberate to the sounds of muskets, canons and blood-curdling battle cries. And, of course, there will be a huge event in Puebla itself. The picturesque city is where, 150 years ago to the day, the Mexican army under the command of General Ignacio Zaragoza, supported by indigenous warriors carrying machetes, drove out the French troops of Napoleon III. \\"Mexico was between two fires,\\" says Juan Pablo Salazar, the official historian of Puebla. \\"Either we embraced the United States or we embraced Europe.\\" At that fork in the road, he says, the Battle of Puebla was crucial in determining the future direction of Mexico by choosing to defend its fledgling sovereignty from the invading forces. The nature of the victory was crucial too. \\"The French assumed they'd flatten everyone, particularly the indigenous tribes who had no military technology,\\" the historian says. But the Indians, supporting a vastly outnumbered Mexican army, came out to fight from all over Puebla. \\"They were very poor, simple people and they fought with their souls. You can imagine the political importance the United States made of the victory. It was a way of telling France: 'This is ours, America is for the Americans'.\\" The tale of the outnumbered and weaker Mexicans claiming an unlikely victory against one of the most powerful militaries in the world adds to the romance of the Cinco de Mayo, says Juan Pablo Salazar. It is a story which has been celebrated by successive Mexican governments for a century and a half. On Saturday, thousands of modern-day soldiers will take time away from military matters in Mexico to recreate the battle in front of President Felipe Calderon. Back in the US, there are still a lot of misconceptions about the Cinco de Mayo, says Mexican-born Chicago resident, Vincent Rangel. \\"Most people think it's Mexican Independence Day,\\" he chuckles. (That's actually on 16 September.) \\"We home-grown Mexicans laugh a bit at the half-price margaritas and the buckets of Corona beer for five dollars. I know of Irish pubs that have Cinco de Mayo specials, it's bizarre.\\" But, he adds, for fear of sounding like a killjoy, the older generation aren't trying to rain on the parade. \\"I think it's encouraging when people ask us 'What is this Cinco de mayo thing all about?' \\" \\"I explain to my friends who are Germans or Poles or Jewish that, for me at least, it's a moment for quiet reflection about the great sacrifice people made 150 years ago to get us to this point.\\" What is a summary of this text?","output":"The Cinco de Mayo celebration on the 5th of May, honoring the day the Mexican army defeated the French in the Battle of Puebla in 1862, has become a significant event for Mexican-Americans and other Chicagoans. Parades, festive floats, mariachis, and good food are part of the celebration, but criticisms abound, stating that the event has been commercialized for alcohol sales in Chicago. Curiously, Cinco de Mayo celebrations are more grandiose in the United States than in Mexico itself, with only Puebla and few parts of Mexico City commemorating the day. The battle was significant for determining Mexico's sovereignty and future direction, with the unlikely victory against the powerful French army being celebrated by successive Mexican governments. Despite misconceptions about the event, the Cinco de Mayo serves as a moment of reflection on the sacrifices made 150 years ago to achieve their sovereignty."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant that follows instruction extremely well.

The U.S. Senate Judiciary Committee approved a bill Thursday that would protect from arbitrary dismissal the special counsel investigating Russian interference in the 2016 U.S. election. The measure, backed by 10 Democrats and four Republicans, would codify Justice Department regulations that the special counsel can only be fired by the attorney general or a designee for \\"misconduct, dereliction of duty, incapacity, conflict of interest, or other good cause.\\" The proposal would give the special counsel 10 days to challenge a dismissal in court. If a court determines the firing was not for \\"good cause,\\" the special counsel would be reinstated. The measure would also require the Justice Department to notify Congress when a special counsel is appointed and to report the findings of an investigation. While marking a strong show of support for Special Counsel Robert Mueller who is under frequent attack by President Donald Trump and some Republicans, the bill is unlikely to become law in the face of Republican opposition. Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell said last week that Trump will not fire Mueller and that there was no need to bring the measure to the Senate floor for a vote. House Speaker Paul Ryan has also opposed the idea. The legislation was introduced by four Senators earlier this month after Trump's sharp criticism of an FBI raid on his personal lawyer's home and office rekindled fears that Trump may fire Mueller and Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein, who supervises Mueller. Mueller is heading the federal investigation into Russia's electoral interference and possible collusion with the Trump presidential campaign.

Think like you are answering to a five year old. A dutch oven or high-sided cast iron pan are your best bets, as they retain heat well and have big sides to prevent splattering oil. This is cold oil, not hot, as this process heats up the oil and fries simultaneously. This simulates the double-fry method mentioned above. As the oil heats up it leaches moisture from the potato, which allows the later heat (once the oil is up to temperature) to actually fry the chip. The oil will begin to bubble up around the fries, which is a good sign. These bubbles aren't actually oil, but escaping water molecules. You should be able to easily pierce the potatoes with a fork. This means they've softened enough to really start frying. The bubbling in the oil should crank up significantly, and after 20-25 minutes you should notice that the fries are starting to get golden brown and delicious looking. A few more minutes and they'll be perfect. Remove the fries from the hot oil with a slotted spoon or wire strainer, then pat dry with paper towels. Don't let excess oil stick around -- it leads to soggy fries. Once you're done patting, season liberally with salt and serve. Summary:","output":"To make yummy fries, use a dutch oven or a big pan with high sides. Fill it with cold oil and put the potato slices inside. The oil will get hot and cook the potatoes at the same time. You'll see little bubbles that show the water is coming out of the potatoes and they're getting soft. When they look a little brown all over and are easy to poke with a fork, they're ready. Carefully take the fries out of the oil, dry them with a paper towel to remove extra oil, and then sprinkle salt on top.

Select the topic that this about: The International Olympic Committee joined the investigation yesterday into allegations that Marion Jones, the American gold-medal sprinter, had used anabolic steroids and other illegal bodybuilding drugs.","output":"The International Olympic Committee (IOC) recently announced its involvement in the investigation into allegations that Marion Jones, the American gold-medal sprinter, had used anabolic steroids and other illegal bodybuilding drugs. The issue of doping in sports, specifically the use of anabolic steroids and performance-enhancing drugs, has long been a matter of concern for the global athletic community. The involvement of the IOC in this case reflects the committee's commitment to ensuring fairness and transparency in sports, as well as upholding the values of the Olympic Games. Marion Jones is an accomplished American sprinter who has won several Olympic medals in her career, including gold medals in the 100 meters, 200 meters, and 4x400 meter relay events during the 2000 Sydney Olympics. However, allegations of doping offences have cast a shadow over her achievements, leading to widespread skepticism and the need for a thorough investigation. Anabolic steroids are synthetic substances that are similar to testosterone, a naturally occurring hormone that is responsible for promoting the growth of skeletal muscles and the development of male sexual characteristics. Athletes and bodybuilders use anabolic steroids to enhance their physical strength, increase muscle mass, and improve their performance. However, the use of such substances is illegal in competitive sports and can lead to serious health risks and long-term damage. The allegations against Marion Jones came to light after the exposure of the BALCO doping scandal. The Bay Area Laboratory Co-Operative (BALCO) was found to be providing anabolic steroids and other performance-enhancing drugs to various athletes, leading to widespread repercussions in the sports world. Marion Jones was one of the many athletes under suspicion due to her association with BALCO founder, Victor Conte. The IOC's decision to join the investigation demonstrates its commitment to maintaining the integrity of the Olympic Games by eliminating doping and other unethical practices. The investigation will be extensive, as it will involve collaborating with various national and international agencies such as the World Anti-Doping Agency (WADA), the United States Anti-Doping Agency (USADA), and other sporting organizations. The IOC will also be reviewing past test results, interviewing witnesses, and scrutinizing available evidence to determine if Marion Jones did indeed use performance-enhancing drugs during her career. If found guilty, Marion Jones could face severe consequences, such as being stripped of her Olympic medals and being banned from future athletic competitions. Moreover, the incident would serve as a grim reminder of the importance of ensuring fair competition among athletes. It is important to note that while the investigation is ongoing, Marion Jones has the right to defend herself and present her side of the story. The involvement of the IOC signifies the seriousness of the matter, and the committee will likely spare no effort to uncover the truth. At the same time, the case highlights the importance of continued vigilance against doping in the world of sports and the need for stricter regulations to prevent athletes from seeking an unfair advantage through the use of illegal substances. In conclusion, the International Olympic Committee's involvement in the Marion Jones doping investigation showcases their determination to uphold the values of the Olympic Games and maintain a fair and transparent environment in sports. The case of Marion Jones underscores the ongoing battle against the use of anabolic steroids and other illegal bodybuilding drugs in athletics and emphasizes the importance of ethical conduct in sports to preserve the spirit of competition."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

During the 1999 Russian Presidential elections, the two leading candidates are Igor Komarov, a former Colonel of the KGB, and Nikolai Nikolayev, a retired General of the Russian Army. When a car bomb explodes outside one of Komarov's pharmaceutical companies, and a virus is stolen from inside, an investigation by the FSB ensues headed by FSB agents Sonia Astrova and Andrei Kasanov. Their investigation is obstructed by the Director of the FSB, Anatoly Grishin. A British Embassy worker from Moscow, Sir Nigel Irvine, tracks down Jason Monk, a former CIA operative, who ran double agents in the Soviet Union and convinces him to investigate the incident. Once in Moscow, Jason finds an old friend, Viktor Akopov, who agrees to hide Jason from Komarov's men. Viktor steals a residue sample of the bomb used and his scientist friend Tonkin tells him that the explosive used, Semtex H, has a direct traceable link to the FSB. Tonkin is soon killed by Vladimir Dorganosov, the man who attacked Komarov industries and stole the bioweapon. Sonia and Andrei locate Leonid Zaitzev, a cleaner who worked at the Komarov Industries plant and saw Dorganosov steal the virus. As they question him, Grishin appears, arrests Zaitzev and fires Sonia and Andrei. Zaitzev is later killed by Dorganosov while in custody. Sonia goes home to find Jason waiting for her, and agrees to help him access the FSB network. However, they are shot at by Dorganosov, and a car chase ensues. They go to Andrei's house where they find him already dead. After the chase, Dorganosov demands the rest of his payment from his contractor, who is revealed to be Anatoly Grishin. While they are arguing, Komarov himself arrives and orders Grishin to kill Dorganosov. Answer:","output":"Igor Komarov"},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant. User will you give you a task.

Options: - stockpile - buy - plentitude - superabundance - oversupply  The answer is \\"stockpile\\" because A:","output":"When you want to gather weapons, you would choose to \\"stockpile\\" them. This is because stockpiling involves the accumulation and storage of a large quantity of items, such as weapons, in a particular place. This action is often done in preparation for future use or emergencies. By stockpiling weapons, you can ensure that you have a sufficient supply when needed. The other options are not relevant to the context of gathering weapons: - Buy: This refers to the act of purchasing items, not gathering or storing them. - Plentitude: This signifies having an abundance or large quantity of something but doesn't describe an action related to weapons. - Superabundance: Similar to plentitude, this implies having an excess of something but doesn't describe the action of gathering or storing weapons. - Oversupply: This means having more of something than is needed or desired but, again, does not describe the action of gathering or storing weapons."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Dennis was better at expressing their feelings than Benjamin because","output":"Dennis was better at expressing their feelings than Benjamin because he had spent considerable time intentionally developing his emotional intelligence and practicing various forms of communication. This difference between the two individuals can be attributed to multiple factors, which include not only their respective personality traits but also their upbringing, experiences, and the ways in which they have chosen to cultivate these skills. From a young age, Dennis showed a natural proclivity for understanding and empathizing with others' emotions. His parents encouraged this behavior by consistently validating his emotions, teaching him how to label them, and helping him develop the tools necessary to express them constructively. This positive reinforcement instilled in Dennis a strong sense of self-awareness and emotional literacy, which allowed him to navigate social situations effectively and build strong connections with the people around him. As Dennis continued to grow and develop, he consistently sought out opportunities to hone these skills further. He participated in group therapy, emotional intelligence workshops, and other forms of interpersonal development programs that focused on fostering empathy, active listening, and emotional self-awareness. This education provided Dennis with even more strategies and tools to express his feelings in a healthy manner. In addition to this formal education, Dennis made a conscious effort to practice expressing his feelings in his day-to-day life. He set goals for himself, such as maintaining a regular journal-writing practice to explore his emotions and clearly articulating his thoughts and emotions to his friends and family. By practicing these habits, Dennis refined his ability to gauge his own emotions with clarity and precision, as well as the emotions of others. In contrast, Benjamin never quite received the same level of emotional support growing up. His family environment discouraged open expression of emotions, leading him to suppress his feelings and struggle with understanding the emotions of others. Without the early foundation of emotional literacy that Dennis had, Benjamin found it difficult to navigate social situations and forge strong connections with others. Furthermore, Benjamin did not actively seek out opportunities to develop his emotional intelligence and communication skills. While he may have been aware of the potential benefits of doing so, the lack of initial support created a barrier that made it difficult for him to prioritize emotional growth in the same way Dennis did. As a result, Benjamin's ability to understand and express his feelings remained underdeveloped compared to Dennis. Due to these experiences and personal choices, Dennis became better at expressing his feelings than Benjamin over time. Dennis' commitment to emotional growth and willingness to engage in self-reflection have allowed him to become a more empathetic, understanding, and effective communicator when it comes to articulating his feelings. Meanwhile, Benjamin’s lack of emotional support, minimal practice, and differing priorities have left him struggling to connect with others and express his emotions openly. This divergence in emotional intelligence and communication skills is ultimately what sets Dennis apart from Benjamin in terms of expressing their feelings."},{"instruction":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

Summarize: These are commonly sold at stores that sell moving supplies, including U-Haul locations. You’ll also be able to find mattress covers at a local hardware store. They commonly sell for about 5–10 USD.  During the process of being moved, the sides and top of your mattress may come in contact with floors, stairs, the ground outside, and the inside of a moving van (or the top of your car). You can use a plastic mattress cover to prevent your mattress from collecting dirt and permanent stains.  If you’re simply moving the mattress from one room to another within the same house or apartment, you don’t need to purchase or use a mattress cover. Before you begin to package and move the mattress, it needs to be lifted off of the bed frame or box spring it’s been resting on. Also remove any blankets or quilts. You can probably move the mattress with the fitted sheet and mattress pad still on, but remove all other sheets. Start by standing the mattress on its side and slipping the end farthest from the zipper over the base of your mattress. Work the cover up over the mattress by tugging on the top of the cover, and then on the bottom. Keep sliding the cover up until the entire mattress is inside. If you have someone with you, ask them to hold the head of the mattress a few inches up in the air. Once your mattress is completely in the moving cover, you can adjust the corners of the cover as needed. Make sure that there are no spots where the plastic is stretched thin around the mattress inside and might tear. Then, zip the bag closed. If your mattress cover doesn’t have a zipper, you’ll need to use packaging tape to make sure that the cover is completely sealed. Fold over the top flap of the plastic cover, and tape down all of the loose edges so no dust can make its way inside. Before you begin to move the mattress, make sure that you have a clear path to the vehicle or rental truck you’ll be placing the mattress in. Clear any boxes or furniture out of the path you’ll be walking through, and prop doors open so you won’t have to open them while holding the mattress.  Even if you’re only moving the mattress from one room to another within a house or apartment, still clear a path. You could easily trip over a stray side table or chair. If there is more than one route outside, figure out which route to take before you begin walking. Communicate this to the person helping you move the mattress.","output":"Mattress covers can be found at stores selling moving supplies or local hardware stores for around 5-10 USD.

In the early 19th century, the role of Utrecht as a fortified town had become obsolete. The fortifications of the Nieuwe Hollandse Waterlinie were moved east of Utrecht. The town walls could now be demolished to allow for expansion. The moats remained intact and formed an important feature of the Zocher plantsoen, an English style landscape park that remains largely intact today. Growth of the city increased when, in 1843, a railway connecting Utrecht to Amsterdam was opened. After that, Utrecht gradually became the main hub of the Dutch railway network. With the industrial revolution finally gathering speed in the Netherlands and the ramparts taken down, Utrecht began to grow far beyond the medieval centre. In 1853, the Dutch government allowed the bishopric of Utrecht to be reinstated by Rome, and Utrecht became the centre of Dutch Catholicism once more. From the 1880s onward neighbourhoods such as Oudwijk, Wittevrouwen, Vogelenbuurt to the East, and Lombok to the West were developed. New middle class residential areas, such as Tuindorp and Oog in Al, were built in the 1920s and 1930s. During this period, several Jugendstil houses and office buildings were built, followed by Rietveld who built the Rietveld Schröder House (1924), and Dudok's construction of the city theater (1941).

This move comes as several significant gains within the industry have been observed in recent months. Analysts have speculated that this initiative could further solidify Lloyds' presence in the financial sector, creating a more comprehensive and competitive banking institution. Abbey National, known primarily as Abbey, is a reputable bank within the UK banking market. With a longstanding history dating back to 1849, Abbey has cultivated an unwavering commitment to customer satisfaction and growth. Its highly sought-after services include personal banking, mortgages, savings accounts, as well as insurance products. With its robust portfolio of offerings, acquiring Abbey would markedly expand Lloyds' current range of services. Lloyds Banking Group, one of the Big Four clearing banks of the United Kingdom, is no stranger to strategic acquisitions. As one of the oldest banks in the UK with over 250 years of operation, Lloyds continually proves its dedication toward achieving excellence in the financial sector. The acquisition of Abbey National will not only enhance Lloyds' product offerings but also allow the group to tap into Abbey's consumer base of over 18 million customers. Ongoing developments within the UK banking sphere have prompted Lloyds to reconsider their initial offer. As major competitors in the sector continue to expand and innovate, increasing their bid for Abbey National marks a strategic move to stay ahead. Sources within Lloyds have expressed increased optimism over the success of the proposed acquisition; however, the exact amount of the revised bid remains undisclosed. The potential acquisition of Abbey National would mark yet another milestone in Lloyds' ambitious journey to become the leading financial institution in the United Kingdom. With a focus on customer satisfaction and reliable services, the combined efforts of these two banking giants could deliver exceptional financial solutions to both current and future clients. Notwithstanding any challenges that may arise during the acquisition process, Lloyds Banking Group aims to ensure a smooth transition for the customers and employees of both organizations. With the close collaboration of Lloyds' top executives and Abbey's management team, this merger promises a seamless integration that would uphold the core values and long-standing traditions of both banks. In conclusion, Lloyds Banking Group's reported decision to increase their bid for Abbey National reflects their unyielding determination to strengthen their position in the UK banking sector. By acquiring the esteemed Abbey, Lloyds could provide enhanced services and customer experiences that uphold the storied legacies of both organizations. However, there are undoubtedly many critical factors and nuances to consider in this potential acquisition. As more details emerge from this strategic move, stakeholders and industry specialists alike will be watching closely to see how the financial landscape responds to the formidable union between Lloyds Banking Group and Abbey National."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

News article: HARRISBURG - In her 93 years, Philadelphian Viviette Applewhite said, she had missed her chance to vote for president just once - and that was because she could not find her polling place despite spending 12 hours looking.      This fall might mark the second time, Applewhite testified Wednesday in Commonwealth Court, because a new state law says she must bring photo identification to the polls in order to vote. And thanks to a purse-snatcher, she hasn't got much in the way of photo ID.      Applewhite, who came to court in a motorized wheelchair and testified of having once marched with the Rev. Dr. Martin Luther King Jr., said voting \\"gives me the right to help people and myself.\\"      She was one of the first witnesses in a state case that has drawn national attention. The American Civil Liberties Union of Pennsylvania and other groups are asking a judge to knock the state's tough new voter-ID law off the books before it can be used in the Nov. 6 election.      Attorneys for Applewhite and nine other voters argued Wednesday that the law violated the state constitution by imposing unfair burdens on voters and could disenfranchise as many as a million or more Pennsylvanians - especially those who are old, poor, or disabled.      The lawyers also disputed the law's stated purpose of preventing vote fraud, and repeatedly pointed to state officials' written stipulation that they planned to present no evidence of in-person voter impersonation, either in Pennsylvania or elsewhere, nor evidence that \\"in-person voter fraud is likely to occur in November 2012 in the absence of the photo-ID law.\\"      That leaves only one explanation for the Republican-backed law, the civil liberties groups contend: to help sway elections in favor of one political party, in a presidential election year and in a state often described as a key battleground.      In court, ACLU lawyers pointed to a widely quoted June 23 remark by State House Majority Leader Mike Turzai (R., Allegheny) at a Republican Party meeting. Turzai said the new voter-ID law \\"is going to allow Gov. Romney to win the state of Pennsylvania.\\" Turzai's spokesman later said he simply meant the law leveled the playing field for GOP presidential candidates.      \\"The real purpose of this law is partisan advantage,\\" said David Gersch, a Washington-based lawyer representing Applewhite and the other plaintiffs.      Gersch added: \\"We will show that the integrity of the electoral process is not enhanced by turning away people at the ballot box.\\"      The state's lawyer, Senior Deputy Attorney General Patrick Cawley, argued that the law was not burdensome. He said having a photo ID has become \\"a widespread part of American life,\\" adding that voters have been given ample time and opportunity to obtain the necessary identification to vote.      Cawley said the Department of State, which oversees Pennsylvania elections, was conducting a massive public-education campaign to let all voters know what was required. That campaign will include a blast of radio, television, and print ads, as well as letters notifying voters of the new law.      He noted, too, that the state Department of Transportation is providing free photo IDs to those who need one. And because those IDs require some voters to dig up several official documents, such as birth certificates, he pointed out what the state announced Friday - a new voting-only ID card that would require less paperwork to obtain.      \\"A great many hurdles have already been removed from the path of voters who want to vote,\\" Cawley argued.      He said writing laws to regulate elections was very much within the legislature's purview. And he downplayed the significance his adversaries were attaching to the state's written stipulation that it would not offer evidence of past voter fraud.      That stipulation, Cawley said, merely acknowledges that the legislature needed no proof of such crimes to pass the new law.      \\"We are not here to judge the wisdom of the voter-ID law,\\" said Cawley, adding that the burden was on civil liberties groups to prove that the law would cause \\"irreparable harm.\\"      The decision on whether to enjoin the law before the presidential election lies with Judge Robert Simpson, who reminded everyone at the start of what is expected to be five to seven days of hearings that he would not have the last word.      He said he expected to decide by mid-August - and also expected his decision to be appealed to the state Supreme Court. \\"Take heart,\\" said Simpson. \\"I am not the last level of review.\\"      He heard testimony from six voters who said they faced real hurdles in getting the photo IDs the law requires.      Cawley asked witnesses if they knew their Social Security numbers; each did. That would help them obtain the new ID cards the state is promising. The plaintiffs' lawyers asked each if they had received notification of the new law from the state. Only one had.      Applewhite said she was born Viviette Brooks but got a new last name when the father of her boyfriend for 22 years, Thomas Applewhite of Mississippi, adopted her.      \\"They wanted to make sure I got the property and things when everybody died,\\" she testified.      Her lawyers said Applewhite would not be able to obtain a PennDot photo-ID card because her purse was snatched several years ago - and along with it, her Social Security card, a photo ID from the State of Virginia, and her birth certificate.      She testified that she had spent five years trying to replace the stolen documents and that only her birth certificate had been found. ||||| A similar strategy has succeeded in Missouri and Wisconsin, where judges have relied on voting rights protections enshrined in state constitutions to block laws that require voters to present photo identification.      Voting rights advocates are scrambling to fight a rush of legislation adopted over the past two years that, among other changes, curtail the availability of early voting and impose new requirements on voter-registration efforts.      Most attention has been focused on requirements that voters show photo identification, a measure that strikes many people as a common-sense notion that voters prove they are who they say they are. Many states require some method of identification, but 10, including Pennsylvania, have passed laws requiring specific kinds of government-issued IDs.      “The integrity of the electoral process is not enhanced by turning away people at the ballot box,” said David Gersch, an attorney for 10 individuals and three groups, including the NAACP and the League of Women Voters. “Voting is not a privilege. It’s a right.”      Although the court battles are waged in lawyers’ words, the partisan import of the laws is impossible to ignore. President Obama’s supporters argue that the legislation could cause serious harm to his reelection campaign. And all but one of the new measures have come in states with Republican-led legislatures. Democratic governors have vetoed some changes.      Lawyers challenging the Pennsylvania law asked Simpson to note that state House Majority Leader Mike Turzai (R) listed the law as an accomplishment at a meeting of GOP activists.      “Voter ID — which is going to allow governor Romney to win the state of Pennsylvania — done,” he said.      Sponsors say the laws are needed to combat voter fraud and assure the public that only qualified voters’ ballots will be counted. In opening arguments Wednesday, Senior Deputy Attorney General Patrick Cawley told Simpson that “widespread disenfranchisement will not happen” and that “nothing could be more rational” than requiring a voter to show a photo ID.      But evidence of the kind of voting fraud the laws would discourage is elusive. Pennsylvania stipulated before the trial that it could not show evidence of such fraud in the past and that it is unlikely to occur in the absence of the law.      Opponents say the laws disproportionately affect minorities, the poor and the elderly, who even in a modern world sometimes lack photo identification and the legal documents and means that would allow them to obtain it. ||||| What is a shorter version of the above article?","output":"In Harrisburg, Pennsylvania, 93-year-old Viviette Applewhite testified against a new state law that requires voters to present photo identification at the polls, as she no longer possesses a valid photo ID due to a purse-snatcher.

The state's lawyer maintains that the law is not burdensome and that having a photo ID is a common aspect of American life. The decision on whether the law should be enforced lies with Judge Robert Simpson, who expects to reach a decision by mid-August, but noted that his decision may be appealed to the state Supreme Court."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Please answer the following question: Given the below context:  The movie is set in 1985, in the fictional town of Quatssack, New Hampshire. Quatssack seems like a nice, ordinary town, but it harbors a dark and deadly secret: it is the home of the Children of the Yeti, an evil cult that worships a yeti that lives in the woods. The yeti was captured in the Himalayas and brought to the town as an old man′s sideshow, but had escaped, and is reportedly the last of its kind. Each night, Debra, one of its members, lures young men to the cult with the intention of offering it up to the yeti as a means of keeping it sexually sated. The movie opens up with such an example, with Debra and Raymond, the cult′s leader, looking on while laughing sadistically. Five college students—fraternity brothers Adam and Dick, their girlfriends Sally and Emily, and a fifth member named Joe—are coming to Quatssack on a camping trip, unaware of the town′s secrets. On their first night, Joe is killed while going to the bathroom in the woods, and since he was the one who had the car keys, the remaining four cannot leave town. The old man, who now owns a hideous-looking creature called \\"Tentacle Boy\\" and displays it as a sideshow, informs them of the yeti that he used to own now living somewhere in the woods. Emily goes into a nearby church to pray for Joe′s safety, and while she is in there, she is discovered by a priest as a \\"Chosen One\\" that was prophesied to take down the Children of the Yeti. She accepts her destiny, and the priest gives her supplies for her mission. Meanwhile, Adam, Dick, and Sally, who are waiting for Emily outside, are ambushed by a redneck demanding the whereabouts of the Chosen One. Emily emerges from the church and shoots the redneck with a crossbow, and despite his seemingly near-fatal wound, demands that the redneck take them to the cult′s location. Only Adam and Emily follow the redneck; Sally is sent back to their campsite, while Dick had left earlier, having met Debra.  Guess a valid title for it!

In an interview with Vanity Fair, Cher expressed her love and support for Chaz, while admitting the difficulty she still has using the correct pronouns. Chaz Bono, who was born as Chastity to Cher and her former husband, the late Sonny Bono, started his transition process in 2008. Cher acknowledges her son's strength and resilience, stating, \\"If I woke up tomorrow in a guy's body, I would just kick and scream and cry and f***ing rob a bank, because I cannot see myself as anything but who I am—a girl.

Chaz has also appeared on the reality show Dancing with the Stars, as well as the documentary Becoming Chaz, which chronicles his gender transition. In her Vanity Fair interview, Cher also discusses other aspects of her life, including her parenting skills, her relationship with Sonny Bono, her thoughts on Meryl Streep, and her attitude towards drugs.

In Sentence 1, the statement suggests that several of Byron's ancestors are poisoned, along with Edward. Here, the main subject being described as poisoned is Byron's ancestors, and Edward is included as an additional person affected. The focus is on the harmful event that has happened to Byron's ancestors, with Edward Trencom being a part of that event. Sentence 2, on the other hand, implies that the poisoning has happened to several of Edward's ancestors, along with Byron. In this case, the primary victims are Edward's ancestors, while Byron is added as an extra person who had also been poisoned in whatever event took place. The focus shifts to Edward Trencom's ancestors and their misfortune, with Byron simply being connected to the event. To summarize, the key difference lies in which character's ancestors are the main subject of the poisoning incident. In the first sentence, it focuses on Byron's ancestors, while in the second sentence, the focus had shifted to Edward's ancestors.

Somerset Maugham stories which comprise the film. The author still turns up to introduce the episodes, but there’s no epilogue this time around; by the way, while the script of the original compendium gave sole credit to R.C. Sheriff, here Maugham himself also lent a hand in the adaptation, as well as Noel Langley (though it’s unclear whether they contributed one segment each or else worked in unison). As can be expected, much of the crew of QUARTET has been retained for the second installment – though this also extends to at least three cast members, namely Naunton Wayne, Wilfrid Hyde-White and Felix Aylmer (the last two had bit parts in the episode from QUARTET entitled “The Colonel’s Lady”). While TRIO ultimately emerges to be a lesser achievement than its predecessor (slightly unbalanced by the third story which takes up more than half the running-time), it’s still done with the utmost care, acted with verve by a stellar cast and is solidly enjoyable into the bargain. “The Verger” tells of a church sexton (James Hayter) – for which the story’s title is another word – who’s dismissed after 17 years of service by the new parish priest (Michael Hordern) simply because he’s illiterate. Rather than rest on his laurels, despite his age, he not only takes a wife (his landlady, played by Kathleen Harrison) but opens a tobacconist shop strategically placed in a lengthy stretch of road where no such service is offered – and, with business flourishing, this is developed into a whole chain. The last scene, then, sees him pay a visit to bank manager Felix Aylmer who, not only is surprised to learn of Hayter’s lack of education, but is prompted to ask him what his other interests were – to which the wealthy (and respected) tobacconist replies, with some measure of irony, that he had the calling to be a verger!  The second episode, “Mr. Know-All”, is the shortest but also perhaps the most engaging: a voyage at sea is utterly beleaguered by the insufferable presence of a pompous young man (Nigel Patrick), British despite his foreign-sounding name of Kelada, who professes to be an authority on virtually every subject under the sun. Naunton Wayne and Wilfrid Hyde-White are the two passengers who have to put up with him the most – the latter because he shares a cabin with the man and the former in view of Patrick’s attentions to his pretty wife (Anne Crawford). During a fancy-dress party, however, the passengers decide to enact their ‘revenge’ on Kelada by having one of them impersonate him (a jest which he naturally doesn’t appreciate)!; still, it’s here that he contrives to show a decent side to his character – told by Crawford that the necklace she’s wearing is an imitation, Wayne challenges Patrick to name its price…but the latter realizes immediately that it’s the genuine article and that this would compromise Crawford’s position if he were to tell, so Kelada allows himself to be publicly ridiculed rather than expose the fact that the woman probably has a secret admirer!  As can also be deduced from the title, “Sanatorium” deals with the myriad patients at such a place – run by Andre' Morell; the protagonist is a new intern, Roland Culver, who wistfully observes the various goings-on. The narrative, in fact, highlights in particular three separate strands of plot – one humorous (the ‘feud’ between two aged Scots long resident at the sanatorium, played by Finlay Currie and John Laurie), one melodramatic (the erratic relationship between disgruntled patient Raymond Huntley and long-suffering but devoted wife Betty Ann Davies) and one bittersweet (the romance between naïve but charming Jean Simmons and dashing cad Michael Rennie which, in spite of having pretty much everything against it including the fact that Morell has diagnosed Simmons as a ‘lifer’ while Rennie only has a few years left to him, leads the couple to the altar).

Write an article that answers the following question: How many points were converted from Phillips interception?","output":"Title: How Many Points Were Converted From Phillips' Interception? Hey little buddy! I heard you have a question about something that happened in a football game. You want to know how many points were converted from Phillips' interception, right? I'll be more than happy to help you understand! First, let's talk about what an \\"interception\\" is. In the game of football, one team tries to pass the ball to their teammates. But sometimes, a player from the other team, like Phillips, can be sneaky and catch the ball instead. When this happens, we call it an \\"interception\\" because they've stopped the other team's progress. Now, when a player intercepts the ball, it doesn't automatically give their team points. After the interception, Phillips' team gets a chance to start playing from that spot on the field. They will then try to move the ball down to the other end, and if they can cross the goal line, they might score some points! There are a few ways to score points in football: 1. Touchdown: When a team gets the ball into the other team's end zone, they score a touchdown, which is worth 6 points. 2. Extra Point: After scoring a touchdown, the team can kick the ball through the goal posts to earn 1 extra point. 3. Two-point Conversion: Instead of kicking the ball for an extra point, the team can try to get the ball back into the end zone again for 2 extra points. 4. Field Goal: If a team can't score a touchdown, they might try to kick the ball through the goal posts from further away. That's called a field goal, and it's worth 3 points. So, to find out how many points were converted from Phillips' interception, we would need to know what happened after the interception. Did his team score a touchdown? Did they get any extra points or a field goal? Remember, an interception by itself doesn't give a team any points. The points come from what the team does after they get the ball. I hope that helps you understand the game a little bit better, and maybe now you can find the answer to your question by looking at what happened during that specific game.

I attended a boarding school for badly behaved children and it had its fair share of bullies who had been expelled from mainstream schools. But this particular bully had even the teachers running scared. When he went off on one, it could take up to four teachers or members of care staff to get him under control. On my first night at boarding school, he stamped on someone’s face and left them permanently disfigured. I never saw anything that bad again but it stayed with me and I could never sleep properly in that school again. On another occasion, it blew up and there were several members of staff restraining him when he farted. To see the teachers all moaning and groaning and huffing and puffing whilst trying to hold him down was hilarious, literally tears in their eyes. He was unpredictable and he didn’t care. I once saw him swing a hammer at another pupil and throw snooker balls at another, and he used to punch as if he was throwing something, so it would result in a painful blow. Eventually, the staff couldn’t cope with him as they were just as scared as we were. He was removed from the school and placed in a secure unit. The night he left, several of us cried with relief.

Meanwhile, Johnny Madrid, a dangerous local outlaw, escapes from the gallows and kidnaps his hangman's beautiful daughter, Esmeralda. Madrid receives assistance from Reece, a young woman who wants to become Madrid's apprentice as an outlaw. With the hangman and a local posse on their trail, Madrid meets with his gang.

Question: where is mint mark on liberty standing half I found the following answer on Google: Weinman's design of Liberty striding towards the Sun for the half dollar proved difficult to perfect, and Treasury Secretary William G. McAdoo , whose department included the Mint, considered having Barber create his own design. Is that a correct answer? Yes or no. The answer to this question is:","output":"No, the provided information does not directly answer the question about the location of the mint mark on a Liberty Standing half dollar. While it offers interesting background information about the coin's design process, it does not specifically address the mint mark's location. Regarding the mint mark on a Liberty Standing Half Dollar, it is important to understand the role and significance of mint marks on coins. Mint marks indicate which U.S. Mint facility produced a particular coin, and can often contribute to a coin's rarity and value. The Liberty Standing Half Dollar, also known as the Walking Liberty Half Dollar, was produced from 1916 to 1947. The coin's obverse, or front side, features a design by sculptor Adolph A. Weinman of Lady Liberty striding towards the Sun, hence its name. Now, let's address the question. The mint mark's location on a Liberty Standing Half Dollar depends on the specific year it was produced: 1. For coins minted from 1916 to 1917, the mint mark is located on the obverse side, near the bottom-left edge, just below the motto \\"IN GOD WE TRUST.\\" 2. For coins minted from 1917 to 1947, the mint mark is located on the reverse side, or back side, near the bottom-left edge, below the branch held by the eagle. Three different U.S. Mint facilities produced the Liberty Standing Half Dollar during its minting period: Philadelphia (no mint mark), Denver (mint mark \\"D\\"), and San Francisco (mint mark \\"S\\"). Keep in mind that not every year's half dollar was minted at all three facilities, with some years exclusive to only one or two mints. In conclusion, the mint mark's location on a Liberty Standing Half Dollar varies depending on the year it was produced, and it is crucial to note where to look to determine the exact origins and value of the coin in question."},{"instruction":"Explain how you used the definition to come up with the answer.

In English, this sentence translates to \\"I am going to marry this woman.\\" This sentence clearly indicates an individual's intention to marry a specific woman. The verb 'ožením' is in the future tense, suggesting a commitment or plan that will happen in the forthcoming time. On top of this, the use of 'Touhle ženou' (this woman) signifies his clear intent regarding who the person he plans to marry is, as opposed to an abstract or non-identified person. It is also worth noting that the Czech language, like other Slavic languages, uses the reflexive pronoun 'se' before verbs in many instances, similar to the way 'myself' or 'itself' might be used in English, which further emphasizes that the speaker is the one undertaking the action of the verb. So in this case, it intensifies the fact that the speaker intends to marry the woman of his own accord. In sum, this sentence is a strong, direct statement of intention regarding his future marital plans. Additionally, the sentence might convey not only a future plan, but also a strong emotional bond, desire and dedication towards the said woman. This might be perceived in a romantic context, where the speaker voluntarily declares his future steps, indicating that he has made a long-term, profound decision about his life that involves a deep relationship with the woman in question, who could be his girlfriend, fiancée, or someone he has deep feelings for."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Summarize this article: Trolley Man: Michael Rogers has been the silent hero since the Melbourne attack. The homeless man who decided to arm himself with a trolley and stand with police against a terrorist (7News)      Trolly man : Michael Rogers has been the silent hero since the Melbourne attack (7News) 2:04      A bystander dubbed “the trolley man” for taking on an armed terrorist with a shopping cart during the deadly terror attack in Melbourne says he is “no hero” as his story comes to light.      Michael Rogers, 46, attempted to help police officers stop Hassan Khalif Shire Ali during Friday’s Bourke Street terror attack. One person had already been stabbed to death and another two were injured.      Mr Rogers, who is homeless with few possessions, began ramming a shopping trolley into the terrorist in a bid to help.      “I threw the trolley straight at him, and I got him. I didn’t quite get him down, though. I’m no hero,” Mr Rogers told Seven News’ Robert Ovadia from the scene of the attack.      Mr Ovadia later told the program, “people think he deserves some sort of award for being a hero. He doesn’t see himself necessarily as a hero but believes he did help save lives and defend his city as well.”      Subscribe to news.com.au’s From The Newsroom podcast      A GoFundMe has since been set up for Mr Rogers, raising 105,130 at time of publication.      The fundraiser was created by Melbourne Homeless Collective, a registered charity that supports people experiencing homelessness.      “All funds donated to this campaign will go directly to Mr Rogers to help get him back on his feet,” the page reads.      “He’s a hero in our eyes and he can do what he feels best with any funds he receives. He risked his own life that day for nothing in return and you can’t put a price on that.”      The charity had originally set a goal of 5000 but has since said it will no longer set a target due to the overwhelming amount of support.      “We’re absolutely blown away by everyone’s generosity and spirit in helping our hero ‘Trolleyman’ get back on his feet,” the charity said.      “We don’t actually have a set target to reach but due to the incredible generosity we’ve seen so far we’ll keep increasing the total accordingly.      “We’ve far surpassed our original goal. Let’s aim for the sky. Our hero absolutely deserves it.”      The Sunday Herald Sun tracked down Mr Rogers on a park bench, amid a nationwide bid to find the humble hero, just 24 hours after he risked his life to save others.      The newspaper reported that Mr Rogers is homeless, but wasn’t concerned when his phone was smashed during the fight, despite not having the means to replace it.      Mr Rogers was one of two bystanders who stepped in as the killer tried to claim more victims in the city. Witness footage of the incident uploaded to social media showed Mr Rogers running to one side of the street to get the trolley before pushing it towards Ali who was wielding a knife and lunging at police.      A man with a shopping trolley twice tried to ram the man to stop him. Another was wielding a chair. Incredible bravery @theheraldsun pic.twitter.com/w473DKA4wr — Josh Fagan (@faganjosh) November 9, 2018      The trolley appeared to startle Ali before the man who pushed it tripped and fell to the ground. The terrorist then ran across the road, followed by police, as Mr Rogers got up and gave chase, pushing his cart towards the attacker a second time.      His actions gained him widespread praise on social media by users who dubbed him “trolley man” and called for him to receive a medal or be made Prime Minister of Australia. Mr Rogers was reportedly unaware of the attention being heaped on him for his actions.      One witness said she spoke to Mr Rogers at the scene and he told her his actions were “just instinctive to help the police protect the safety of others”, the Herald Sun reports.      Mr Rogers told 7 News that he believes he did help save lives.      “I’ve seen the trolley to the side so I’ve picked it up and I ran, threw the trolley straight at him, got him, but didn’t get him down,” he said.      “I did that motion quite a number of times but it just wasn’t getting him down.”      ⚡️ Melbourne: “I threw the trolley straight at him, and I got him. I didn't quite get him down, though. I’m no hero” - Michael Rogers. 7 News has spoken exclusively to “trolley man”, a bystander being hailed a hero following Friday’s terror attack. #TrolleyMan #7News pic.twitter.com/K0v3OXAwe0 — 7 News Sydney (@7NewsSydney) November 10, 2018      Moments later, Ali was shot in the chest by police, before he died in hospital last night.      Prime Minister Scott Morrison said the Somali-born attacker, from Melbourne’s northwestern suburbs, had violated the nation’s trust.      “The greatest threat of religious extremism in this country is the radical and dangerous ideology of extremist Islam,” he said.      Mr Morrison said Ali was one of about 400 people on a national ASIO terror watch list.      “Here in Australia we would be kidding ourselves if we did not call out the fact that the greatest threat of religious extremism in this country is the radical and dangerous ideology of extremist Islam,” Mr Morrison said.      “There is a special responsibility on religious leaders to protect their religious communities and to ensure dangerous teachings and ideologies do not take root here.”      In a press conference on Saturday, Victoria Police confirmed Ali had been known to intelligence agencies for years, but he was not being actively monitored prior to the attack.      They said his passport was cancelled in 2015 after ASIO determined he was planning to travel to Syria. ||||| Uodate 17/11/2018 We’ve reached our goal!

Given the question: Before winning his first NBA championship with the warriors, who joined the All-Championship team after the 2003 Atlantic 10 Men's Basketball Tournament? The answer is:","output":"Before winning his first NBA championship with the Golden State Warriors, Jameer Nelson joined the All-Championship team after the 2003 Atlantic 10 Men's Basketball Tournament.  Jameer Nelson, a talented point guard, played college basketball for the Saint Joseph's University Hawks in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, where he had an illustrious career. He was a part of the Atlantic 10 Conference, a league known for producing numerous professional basketball players. In the 2002-03 season, Nelson helped lead the Saint Joseph's Hawks to an impressive performance in the regular season and eventually the Atlantic 10 Men's Basketball Tournament. In the 2003 Atlantic 10 Tournament, the Hawks had a remarkable run, making it to the championship game against the University of Dayton Flyers. Throughout the tournament, Nelson showcased his exceptional basketball skills and leadership qualities that would later help him succeed in the NBA. Although the Hawks ultimately lost to Dayton in the championship game, Nelson's performance did not go unnoticed. As a result of his outstanding play and significant contributions to the team's success, Jameer Nelson was named to the All-Championship team after the 2003 Atlantic 10 Men's Basketball Tournament. This achievement added to his already impressive college basketball resume, which included being named the 2003-04 National College Player of the Year and a two-time consensus First Team All-American. Following his college career, Jameer Nelson was drafted by the Denver Nuggets in the first round of the 2004 NBA Draft with the 20th overall pick. However, his draft rights were traded to the Orlando Magic, where he would spend the majority of his NBA career. Over the years, he developed into an All-Star caliber player, earning a spot on the Eastern Conference All-Star team during the 2008-09 season. In 2018, Nelson achieved his first NBA championship with the Golden State Warriors, adding a professional championship to his collection of basketball accomplishments. Despite not having a significant role on that championship team, his journey from starring in college basketball to achieving success in the NBA is a testament to his hard work, dedication, and passion for the sport."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Input: 相比之下，旅鼠显着地着色并且对掠食者甚至人类观察者表现得很积极。 Output:","output":"Par rapport à cela, le rat de voyage est nettement coloré et se montre très actif même en présence de prédateurs et d'observateurs humains.  Explanation: Here is a step-by-step process to this translation: 1. 相比之下 --> Par rapport à cela: Translates literally to \\"Compared to this,\\" but a closer French idiom would be \\"Par rapport à cela\\" which means \\"In comparison to this\\". 2. 旅鼠 --> le rat de voyage: This term translates directly to \\"travel rat\\", but in French, the adjective comes after the noun, so it becomes \\"le rat de voyage\\". 3. 显着地着色 --> est nettement coloré: \\"显着的\\" means 'obviously' or 'noticeably' and \\"着色\\" means 'colored'. So combined, it means \\"noticeably colored\\", a phrase which can be translated to French as \\"est nettement coloré\\". 4. 并且 --> et: This conjunction simply translates to \\"and\\"     5. 对掠食者 --> face aux prédateurs: This phrase means \\"towards predators\\". But, in French, an equivalent phrase would be \\"face aux prédateurs\\" which translates to 'in the face of predators'. 6. 甚至人类观察者 --> même les observateurs humains: \\"甚至\\" implies 'even' and \\"人类观察者\\" translates to 'human observers'. The expression 'even human observers' in French can be stated as \\"même les observateurs humains\\". 7. 表现得很积极 --> se montre très actif: This phrase translates to \\"appears very active\\". The word \\"表现\\" means 'display' or 'show', \\"得很\\" implies 'very' and \\"积极\\" translates to 'positive' or 'active'. All of these words together can be translated to 'shows great positivity' or 'appears very active'. The French equivalent would be \\"se montre très actif\\" which literally means 'shows itself to be very active'."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant. User will you give you a task.

Found the following article online, use it to answer the question: What was the name of the opera that made its debut in Bratislava in 1990?  In the latter years of the 20th century the opera was a regular feature in many European cities, and was still breaking new ground; in 1990 it made its debut at the Slovak National Theatre in Bratislava. Vienna saw it for the first time in 1994, at the Vienna Volksoper, in what John Rockwell in the New York Times described as \\"an awkwardly updated production\\", though well performed. The opera had not so far proved particularly popular in the United States, where since the Met premiere of 1916, performances had been rare compared with Europe. Lyric Opera of Chicago staged it in 1966, but waited until 1998 before reviving it. In 1980 the New York City Opera mounted a production based on the 1863 edition, and staged it again in 1983 and 1986. Reviewing the 1986 production, Henahan wrote that despite the inept libretto the work was saved by the \\"melodic suppleness and warmth\\" of Bizet's score.San Diego Opera first staged the work in 1993, but it was this company's 2004 production, designed by Zandra Rhodes, that generated new levels of enthusiasm for the opera throughout the United States. In the following few years this production was shown in seven other U.S. opera houses; in October 2008 James C. Whitson, in Opera News, reported that worldwide, \\"between 2007 and 2009, half of all major production of the piece have been or will be ... in the U.S.\\". San Diego's director, Ian Campbell, suggested that his company's 2004 production was \\"created at a time when it seemed many U.S. opera companies were looking for a not-too-expensive production with melody, and a little off the beaten track .... [Our] Les pêcheurs de perles fitted the bill. In January 2008 the opera received its first performance in Sri Lanka, the land of its setting. The conductor, Benjamin Levy, directed a large group of singers and musicians, mostly young and local.  In October 2010, after an interval of more than 120 years, the opera was reintroduced to London's Royal Opera House. Two concert performances were given using a new edition of the...

Article: Do you get angry when your friends sing loudly while you are trying to work, or when your best friend does not wait for you after school? If you do, you need to take control of your feelings and stop getting angry so easily. Getting angry with people can cause you to lose friends. Gray Gerber, an American high school teacher, has written My Feelings Are Like Wild Animals to help you control your feelings. It tells teens how to stay cool when bad things happen to them. The book says that getting angry only makes problems worse. It can never make them better. Getting angry is not a natural way to act, the book says. It is just a bad habit, like smoking. The book says you can control your anger easily. All you have to do is tell yourself not to be angry. When a baby falls over, he only cries if people are watching him. Like a baby, you should only get angry if you are sure it is the right thing to do. The book gives many tips to help you if you get angry easily. Here are our tips: (1)Keep a record. Every time you get angry, write down why you are angry. (2)Ask your friends to stop talking to you when you get angry. This will teach you not to be angry. (3)Do something different. When you get angry, walk away from the problem and go somewhere else. Try to laugh. Question: What does the passage tell us? - Both smoking and getting angry are bad habits. - Getting angry is not a natural way to act. - When you get angry, just cry like a baby. - How to control our feelings and it's important. Answer:","output":"The passage primarily tells us about the importance of controlling our feelings, particularly anger. It identifies both smoking and getting angry as detrimental habits that we can consciously overcome. The passage points out that getting angry is not a natural response, but rather a learned behavior that can be unlearned. It discourages acting out in anger, suggesting that it worsens situations instead of improving them. The passage also provides tips on how to manage anger, which include keeping a record of instances when one got angry, requesting friends to refrain from interacting when one is angry, and advising to divert attention or physically move away from an infuriating environment. Therefore, the passage mainly covers how to control our feelings and illustrates its importance. However, the passage does not suggest crying like a baby when one is angry, rather it uses the analogy of a baby's behavior to underscore the point that we should only get angry when it is absolutely justifiable."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Available options: + negative. + positive.Would the following phrase be considered positive or negative? attempts to fuse at least three dull plots into one good one .","output":"The phrase \\"attempts to fuse at least three dull plots into one good one\\" can be considered both positive and negative depending on how it is interpreted and the context in which it is used. Here is a detailed analysis of both the positive and negative aspects of this phrase. Positive interpretation: 1. Effort: The phrase implies that someone is putting an effort to improve the quality of something (in this case, a storyline). They are not merely settling for dull plots but attempting to combine them to create something better. This attitude of striving for betterment can be considered positive. 2. Creativity: Combining three dull plots into one could require innovative ideas and creativity. This showcases the individual's or the team's creative and problem-solving skills, which can be perceived as a positive aspect. 3. Potential improvement: The phrase suggests that there is room for improvement, and the final output might have a chance of being better than the initial dull plots. This potential for improvement can be seen as positive, as it demonstrates progress and a willingness to elevate the original material. Negative interpretation: 1. Dull plots: The most notable aspect of this phrase is the use of the term \\"dull plots,\\" which implies that the storylines being combined are not interesting or engaging. This can be considered a negative point. 2. Lack of individual quality: By referencing the need to combine three dull plots into one good one, the phrase suggests that none of the original plots is strong enough to stand on its own. This lack of individual quality can be perceived as a weakness, indicating a negative aspect. 3. Uncertainty of success: The phrase only mentions the \\"attempt\\" to fuse these plots, not the successful fusion of them. This means it is uncertain whether the final product would indeed be a good one, and the attempt could potentially prove futile, making this aspect negative. In conclusion, the phrase \\"attempts to fuse at least three dull plots into one good one\\" contains elements that can be considered both positive (effort, creativity, potential improvement) and negative (dull plots, lack of individual quality, uncertainty of success). The overall interpretation of this phrase would depend on the context, tone, and intention behind its usage."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

They regularly talk to each other about what they are growing and share gardening tips. Bobby is out working in his garden when Ned comes over to chat. Ned mentions that the garden at his house is currently flooded, but he's not sure why since it didn't rain. He asks him if Bobby's garden experienced the same thing. Bobby replies that his garden is not currently flooded. He does mention that he did see Ned's daughter walking around near Ned's garden carrying a hose turned on to full power.  Given the paragraph above, please answer correctly the following question:   Is Ned's garden at more or less risk of hypoxia than Bobby's garden?  Hint: Diffusion of carbon dioxide and oxygen is approximately 10,000 times slower in water than in air. When soils are flooded, they quickly lose oxygen, becoming hypoxic (an environment with O2 concentration below 2 mg/liter) and eventually completely anoxic where anaerobic bacteria thrive among the roots. Water also influences the intensity and spectral composition of light as it reflects off the water surface and submerged particles. Aquatic plants exhibit a wide variety of morphological and physiological adaptations that allow them to survive, compete, and diversify in these environments. For example, their roots and stems contain large air spaces (aerenchyma) that regulate the efficient transportation of gases (for example, CO2 and O2) used in respiration and photosynthesis. Salt water plants (halophytes) have additional specialized adaptations, such as the development of special organs for shedding salt and osmoregulating their internal salt (NaCl) concentrations, to live in estuarine, brackish, or oceanic environments. Anaerobic soil microorganisms in aquatic environments use nitrate, manganese ions, ferric ions, sulfate, carbon dioxide, and some organic compounds; other microorganisms are facultative anaerobes and use oxygen during respiration when the soil becomes drier. The activity of soil microorganisms and the chemistry of the water reduces the oxidation-reduction potentials of the water. Carbon dioxide, for example, is reduced to methane (CH4) by methanogenic bacteria. The physiology of fish is also specially adapted to compensate for environmental salt levels through osmoregulation. Their gills form electrochemical gradients that mediate salt excretion in salt water and uptake in fresh water.

Earvin \\"Magic\\" Johnson Jr. (born August 14, 1959) is an American retired professional basketball player and current president of basketball operations of the Los Angeles Lakers of the National Basketball Association (NBA). He played point guard for the Lakers for 13 seasons. After winning championships in high school and college, Johnson was selected first overall in the 1979 NBA draft by the Lakers. He won a championship and an NBA Finals Most Valuable Player Award in his rookie season, and won four more championships with the Lakers during the 1980s. Johnson and Larry Bird were first linked as rivals after Johnson's Michigan State squad defeated Bird's Indiana State team in the 1979 NCAA finals. The rivalry continued in the NBA, and reached its climax when Boston and Los Angeles met in three out of four NBA Finals from 1984 to 1987. Johnson asserted that for him, the 82-game regular season was composed of 80 normal games, and two Lakers-Celtics games. Similarly, Bird admitted that Johnson's daily box score was the first thing he checked in the morning.  Several journalists hypothesized that the Johnson-Bird rivalry was so appealing because it represented many other contrasts, such as the clash between the Lakers and Celtics, between Hollywood flashiness (\\"Showtime\\") and Boston/Indiana blue collar grit (\\"Celtic Pride\\"), and between blacks and whites. The rivalry was also significant because it drew national attention to the faltering NBA. Prior to Johnson and Bird's arrival, the NBA had gone through a decade of declining interest and low TV ratings. With the two future Hall of Famers, the league won a whole generation of new fans, drawing both traditionalist adherents of Bird's dirt court Indiana game and those appreciative of Johnson's public park flair. According to sports journalist Larry Schwartz of ESPN, Johnson and Bird saved the NBA from bankruptcy.  Despite their on-court rivalry, Johnson and Bird became close friends during the filming of a 1984 Converse shoe advertisement that depicted them as enemies. Johnson appeared at Bird's retirement ceremony in 1992, and described Bird as a \\"friend forever\\"; during Johnson's Hall of Fame ceremony, Bird formally inducted his old rival.  In 2009, Johnson and Bird collaborated with journalist Jackie MacMullan on a non-fiction book titled When the Game Was Ours. The book detailed their on-court rivalry and friendship with one another.

A:","output":"Yes, both XLR8R and Dragon magazines are publications that cater to different interests and niches. While they share the basic characteristic of being magazines, their content, target audience, and purpose differ significantly. Here's an overview of each magazine to provide more context: XLR8R Magazine: XLR8R (pronounced \\"accelerator\\") is a magazine that primarily focuses on electronic music, technology, culture, and the individuals who impact these fields. Founded in 1993 by Andrew Rawnsley and Jennifer Howell in San Francisco, California, the magazine initially covered a range of diverse musical genres like hip-hop, indie rock, and electronic music. Over time, XLR8R's focus narrowed to predominantly electronic music and related culture, giving rise to its unique identity. The publication covers various aspects of electronic music, including interviews with artists, album and event reviews, news, and exclusive music releases. Additionally, XLR8R explores the technology used by DJs and music producers, offering insights into the latest gear, software, and techniques. Though XLR8R initially began as a print magazine, it transitioned to an online-only format in 2011. The digital platform continues to attract a large audience of music enthusiasts, industry professionals, and musicians seeking the latest insights into the world of electronic music. Dragon Magazine: Dragon Magazine, on the other hand, was a publication dedicated mainly to role-playing games (RPGs), specifically focusing on the popular game \\"Dungeons & Dragons\\" (D&D). Launched in 1976 by TSR, Inc., the magazine aimed to provide a platform for game-related content, including articles, artwork, and stories. Dragon Magazine catered to players, dungeon masters, and fans of the D&D role-playing game, offering valuable resources such as new game mechanics, background information on characters and settings, dungeon and adventure modules, and tips for enhancing gameplay. It also featured articles that delved into general fantasy themes and other role-playing games. The magazine initially began as a bi-monthly publication, but its growing popularity led to a monthly release schedule. In 2007, the print version of Dragon Magazine was discontinued, and its content was transitioned to an online format as part of Wizards of the Coast's digital initiative. It was eventually discontinued in 2013 due to a strategic rebranding and has now been replaced by Dragon+, a mobile app supplementing the Dungeons & Dragons experience. In conclusion, both XLR8R and Dragon magazines are indeed publications, but they cater to distinctly different interests. XLR8R focuses on electronic music and culture, while Dragon Magazine was devoted to role-playing games, more specifically the Dungeons & Dragons fantasy game. Despite their contrasting niches, both publications have contributed to their respective fields and cultivated passionate communities around their content."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Although noble gases are chemically nonreactive, their electrons can be energized by sending an electric current through them. When this happens, the electrons jump to a higher energy level. When the electrons return to their original energy level, they give off energy as light. Different noble gases give off light of different colors. Neon gives off reddish-orange light, like the word “Open” in the sign below. Krypton gives off violet light and xenon gives off blue light.  and the situation: A scientist, John, has two containers of the same noble gas. John sends electricity through container A.

First lady’s reaction to heckler appropriate and understandable I don’t blame first lady Michelle Obama for her response to a heckler at a private fundraiser for the Democratic Party Tuesday. No one heckled first lady Michelle Obama at this Springfield, Mo. event. (Diana Reese for The Washington Post) Obama was in the middle of an impassioned speech about the changes that her husband has worked toward to improve the lives of our children. She was saying, “Right now, today, we have an obligation to stand up for those kids. And I don’t care what you believe in, we don’t –” When she was rudely interrupted. The first lady continued, “One of the things I don’t do well is this.” Then she left the podium to confront the heckler, face-to-face. Some claim what followed was a childish temper tantrum on the part of the first lady. I say she stood up for herself and for the paying audience’s right to hear the rest of her remarks. The audio from the event is difficult to make out, but according to the pool reporter at the event, Obama said, “Listen to me or you can take the mike, but I’m leaving. You all decide. You have one choice.” The heckler was escorted out and Obama returned to her speech. “So let me make the point that I was making before: We are here for our kids.” The audience applauded. Obama sounded, to me, very much like the “mom-in-chief” that she’s said is her primary role. Salon’s Mary Elizabeth Williams pointed out the first lady reacted in a mom-like way. “It was the determined tone of a woman who, swear to God, will turn this car around right now if you can’t control yourselves.” The heckler, later identified as Ellen Sturtz, 56, a lesbian activist from GetEqual, wants President Obama to sign an executive order that would prohibit discrimination against sexual orientation or gender identity by federal contractors. She paid 500 for admission to the event held at the home of a lesbian couple. In a statement from GetEqual, Sturtz said, “…as the First Lady was talking about our children’s future and ensuring that they have everything they need to live happy and productive lives, I simply couldn’t stay silent any longer.” I’m all for free speech. And for ending discrimination of all kinds. But was this the appropriate time or place for Sturtz to push her agenda? Don Q. Beggs, a friend of mine in Kansas City, Mo. and a friend who happens to be gay and who agrees with Sturtz’s position, didn’t think so. “As a gay person, I was disappointed that the heckler targeted the first lady who doesn’t set policy, targeted the first lady because she is for equality, and targeted the first lady during an improper forum (on children’s issues),” Beggs told me. He stressed, “I do, however, agree with the heckler – just not the time and place.” Change has been a constant theme of the Obama Administration since the campaign. Change was a theme of Michelle Obama’s speech Tuesday night. But change sometimes takes time. And patience. And maybe it wouldn’t hurt to be polite when you want something.

In 2010, he accused the Belgian of having 'a loathing for the very concept of the existence of nation-states', adding: 'Perhaps that's because you come from Belgium, which is pretty much a non-country.'  Ordered by EU officials to apologize, MEP Farage said: 'The only people I am going to apologize to are bank clerks.' He was fined £2,400 but has carried on mocking Belgians and the man he called 'Rumpy Pumpy'. It is interesting to note that Farage has a connection to the very area he mocks through his ancestors who lived in the region before Belgium even existed as a nation. This demonstrates how complex and interconnected the histories of European countries and their people can be, despite political differences that may arise between nations like the UK and Belgium in the present day."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

How to pay your rent with a credit card  Ask if your landlord accepts credit card payments.  Some landlords, especially those who are part of major rental companies, accept credit card payments with little to no hassle. However, many small and independent landlords do not because of the additional fees involved.","output":"In this paragraph, the author is discussing how to pay rent using a credit card. The first step is to inquire if the landlord accepts credit card payments. Moving forward, various scenarios may unfold, which can be elaborated as follows. 1. The landlord accepts credit card payments: If the landlord accepts credit card payments, it is important to find out the specific procedure and requirements. This could involve setting up an online account through the rental company's website or utilizing a third-party service that processes the payments. In this case, make sure to ask about any additional fees, associated risks, and the turnaround time for your payment to be processed and applied to your rental account. 2. The landlord does not accept credit card payments directly but recommends a third-party payment platform: If your landlord does not accept credit card payments directly but allows tenants to use a third-party platform (like Plastiq, RentMoola, or RadPad), you will need to set up an account on that platform. Research the chosen platform, sign up, link your credit card, and follow the instructions to make your rent payment. Keep in mind that these platforms often charge fees, which could range from 2% to 3% or more of the transaction amount. Weigh the advantages and disadvantages of this option before deciding if it is right for you. 3. The landlord does not accept credit card payments: If your landlord does not accept credit card payments, discuss alternative payment options. These may include paying by check, direct bank transfer, or a money order. If you are insistent on using your credit card, explore the possibility of services that allow you to make payments for a fee and send a check on your behalf. Always consider the cost and convenience of these methods in comparison to more traditional payment methods. 4. Weigh the pros and cons of using a credit card for rent: Using a credit card to pay your rent has both advantages and drawbacks. On the plus side, you may be able to earn rewards or cash back, build your credit, and leverage the spending power in case of a temporary cash crunch. On the downside, additional processing fees can be expensive, and mismanaging your finances or failing to pay off your credit card balance could lead to debt and negatively impact your credit score. Analyze your financial situation and habits before using a credit card for rent payments. 5. Keep track of your payments and communicate with your landlord: Regardless of the method you choose to pay your rent, be sure to keep records of all transactions, such as confirmation emails or receipts. Maintain open communication with your landlord to ensure your payments are received and credited on time. Notify the landlord of any issues that might arise, such as delays in processing or disputes over fees. In summary, the next steps involve finding out if your landlord accepts credit card payments, exploring third-party platforms, discussing alternative payment methods, weighing the pros and cons, and keeping track of your transactions. Evaluating your options and making an informed decision will help you maintain a positive relationship with your landlord and avoid unnecessary costs and complications."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Does it follow that \\"The Holy Sepulchre is the stone slab where Jesus' body was placed.\\"?","output":"Yes, it does follow that \\"The Holy Sepulchre is the stone slab where Jesus' body was placed.\\" The Holy Sepulchre, also known as the Church of the Holy Sepulchre or the Church of the Resurrection, is a famous and sacred Christian site located in the Old City of Jerusalem. The site is believed to be the place where Jesus Christ was crucified, buried, and resurrected. This site holds immense religious and historical significance for Christians worldwide, as it commemorates the pivotal events in Jesus' life, which are central to Christian theology. The Holy Sepulchre is not just a single stone slab. It is a church complex housing numerous significant locations related to Jesus' crucifixion and resurrection. The stone slab, referred to as the \\"Stone of Anointment\\" or the \\"Stone of Unction,\\" is where Jesus' body is believed to have been anointed and prepared for burial. This stone is an integral part of the Church of the Holy Sepulchre and holds immense religious value for devout Christians who visit the site. There are several other prominent locations within the Church of the Holy Sepulchre complex, such as: - Golgotha: Also known as Calvary, this is the site where Jesus was crucified. The exact spot is now marked by an altar inside the church. Visitors can reach a touch hole beneath the altar that allows them to touch the rock believed to be at the exact place of Christ's crucifixion.    - The Tomb of Christ: The marble-encased tomb, also known as the Edicule, is believed to be the spot where Jesus' body was buried and later resurrected. The current structure surrounding the tomb dates back to the early 19th century, but the site itself has been a destination for Christian pilgrims since the 4th century.    - The Chapel of St. Helena: This chapel is dedicated to St. Helena, mother of Emperor Constantine, who was responsible for the construction of the original church. It is believed that Helena discovered the True Cross, the cross on which Jesus was crucified, during her visit to Jerusalem.    - The Prison of Christ: Though not universally accepted, some traditions suggest that the Church of the Holy Sepulchre houses the prison cell where Jesus was detained before his crucifixion. The Church of the Holy Sepulchre has gone through several transformations throughout its history, suffering from fires, earthquakes, and various reconstructions. Today, it remains a focal point for Christian pilgrims from various denominations, including Roman Catholic, Greek Orthodox, Armenian Apostolic, and others who come to venerate the events of Jesus' death and resurrection. So, in summary, it is accurate to state that \\"The Holy Sepulchre is the stone slab where Jesus' body was placed,\\" but it is essential to recognize that the Holy Sepulchre encompasses much more than just the stone slab, representing a significant religious site with a rich history."},{"instruction":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

The dancing isn't as important in this film as in other Astaire movies so the comedy and acting shine through. See this movie if you can, it may be light but it is still completely amusing. So I know that many people hate black and white films, they think old movies can't really be funny, this movie should make them change their minds. No one I know can watch this movie without being at least mildly amused. The only problem with the film: Fred Astaire singing without dancing.

David Monroe Shoup (30 December 1904 - 13 January 1983) was a decorated general of the United States Marine Corps who was awarded the Medal of Honor in World War II, became the 22nd Commandant of the Marine Corps, and, after retiring, became one of the most prominent critics of the Vietnam War. Born in Indiana to an impoverished family, Shoup joined the military for financial reasons. Rising through the ranks in the interwar era, he was twice deployed to China during the Chinese Civil War. He served in Iceland at the beginning of U.S. involvement in World War II, and as a staff officer during the Pacific War. David Monroe Shoup was born on 30 December 1904 in Battle Ground, Indiana. His family lived on a farm in Ash Grove, but moved to Covington to live on a new farm in 1916. At age 12 he was enrolled in Covington High School, a competitive high school with an advanced curriculum. Shoup was an excellent student, maintaining high marks in French, English, physics, and history. Additionally, he was involved in several extracurricular activities, including basketball, and was class president in his senior year. He graduated in 1921. He later affectionately referred to his impoverished upbringing as that of an \\"Indiana plowboy.\\" Regarded by friends as very sociable, he met Zola De Haven in his freshman year and later said he had been instantly attracted to her. They were both very competitive in academics and athletics, and the two dated throughout high school; they were married in 1931.  After high school, Shoup attended DePauw University where he was one of 100 awarded the Edward Rector Scholarship, giving him full tuition. Majoring in mathematics, he joined the Delta Upsilon fraternity and maintained high marks, narrowly failing the selection criteria for Phi Beta Kappa Society. He was on the track and field and rifle teams, and also competed in the wrestling and football teams. He won the Indiana and Kentucky Amateur Athletic Union marathon in 1925. He waited tables, washed dishes and worked in a cement factory to help pay his expenses. Lack of funds compelled him to take a year off after his junior year to teach school, and his expenses were further strained when he contracted a severe case of pneumonia and incurred hospital bills. He opted to enroll in the Reserve Officers Training Corps (ROTC) to offset his living expenses, and later recalled that this was the only reason he joined the military. He graduated from DePauw in 1926.  From an early age, Shoup was molded by the progressive ideas of Indiana politicians, sympathizing with rural progressives fighting against the interests of big businesses. He developed an anti-imperialist attitude, and his skepticism about American foreign policy, influenced by his small-town background, made him an outspoken opponent of the unnecessary use of military force. He felt the use of troops for economic or imperialist consideration was wrong, a viewpoint he would carry for his entire career.

I taught the kitten the way Pa taught me: I threw him into water where he could not stand, and I watched, ready to grab him if he went under. Tiger did not thrash desperately like me. He merely paddled urgently for the edge of the plastic pool with his head high and his thin legs churning. Little Bit said, \\"Dog paddle,\\" and we all laughed. \\"Tiger paddle,\\" I said, and we all laughed some more, even Jordy. That was probably when Ma noticed the kitten swimming lessons and stopped them. Our swimming lessons happened in two places. When Pa took us, we went to Hawkins Springs behind Mrs. DeLyons' Fountain of Youth Motor Hotel. When Ma took us, we drove to Mermaid Springs State Park, where we would sometimes meet Mr. Drake. I liked Mermaid Springs better because I felt safe there. Ma could not swim, so she never made me jump off a dock into deep water, and she always insisted that I wear an orange styrofoam cylinder on my back like a skindiver or spaceman. Ma usually sat on a towel on the grass near the beach, reading a magazine or a book while tanning her legs. Every now and then she would call to us not to go too far or not to splash each other. When she wore her one-piece red swimming suit, she would come in up to her waist, then lower herself to her shoulders, being careful not to get her hair wet. On the rarest occasions, she would wear a swimming cap and float on her back in the shallow water. Often she stayed in her shorts and shirt, adding sunglasses and removing shoes as her concession to summer and the beach. Where did Pa take them for lessons?

Here's why: 1. Food Quality: I ordered their signature \\"Sloppy Deluxe\\" burger, expecting a juicy and flavorful meal. However, the beef patty was overcooked, dry, and lacking in taste. The vegetables seemed like they had seen better days, being wilted and discolored. To top it off, the bun was stale and almost inedible. 2. Service: The waitstaff seemed uninterested in providing a pleasant dining experience. It took nearly 20 minutes for our waiter to take our order and an additional 45 minutes for our food to arrive, with no apology for the wait. We also had to ask for refills on our drinks several times before someone attended to our request. 3. Atmosphere: The restaurant's atmosphere was not appealing at all. The lighting was too dim, making it difficult to read the menu or even see our food once it arrived. The music choice was loud and distracting, making conversation nearly impossible. 4. Pricing: For the poor quality of the food and the overall dining experience, I found it quite overpriced. Given the subpar offerings, I would have expected a lower price point. 5. Cleanliness: Lastly, the restaurant's cleanliness left much to be desired. I couldn't help but notice a layer of dust covering the windowsills and the tabletops felt sticky, suggesting they hadn't been cleaned properly. In conclusion, my visit to The Sloppy Burger was a major letdown. The food, service, atmosphere, pricing, and cleanliness all fell short of expectations.

In typography, Durer depicts the geometric construction of the Latin alphabet, relying on Italian precedent. However, his construction of the Gothic alphabet is based upon an entirely different modular system. The fourth book completes the progression of the first and second by moving to three-dimensional forms and the construction of polyhedra. Here Durer discusses the five Platonic solids, as well as seven Archimedean semi-regular solids, as well as several of his own invention. In all these, Durer shows the objects as nets. Finally, Durer discusses the Delian Problem and moves on to the 'construzione legittima', a method of depicting a cube in two dimensions through linear perspective. It was in Bologna that Durer was taught (possibly by Luca Pacioli or Bramante) the principles of linear perspective, and evidently became familiar with the 'costruzione legittima' in a written description of these principles found only, at this time, in the unpublished treatise of Piero della Francesca. He was also familiar with the 'abbreviated construction' as described by Alberti and the geometrical construction of shadows, a technique of Leonardo da Vinci. Although Durer made no innovations in these areas, he is notable as the first Northern European to treat matters of visual representation in a scientific way, and with understanding of Euclidean principles. In addition to these geometrical constructions, Durer discusses in this last book of Underweysung der Messung an assortment of mechanisms for drawing in perspective from models and provides woodcut illustrations of these methods that are often reproduced in discussions of perspective.

When we moved in a month ago, Mary wanted to get a dog to keep out burglars. However, we finally decided that it would be cheaper to put an iron grille in front of the door and get a burglar alarm. Last week, I went to a shop and bought an alarm for just over PS200. It consists of a control unit with three smaller units. I put the control unit in the lounge and put the other units in place by the front door, back door and lounge windows. That night I soon fell asleep because I was confident that no one could get into our house undetected. At about 1:50 a.m. I woke up suddenly and heard the siren. It was like an ambulance driving right through our bedroom. I couldn't leave the siren on all night. I went downstairs in the dark. When I reached the bottom of the stairs, I switched on the light and looked around. Oh my gosh. The back door was unlocked. I rushed to lock it and it was just at that exact moment that the 'burglar' disappeared behind a curtain. Guess what?

That's what looks good to me in the sheriff's department. It's Western. It's Wyoming,' he said. Haskell argues the new uniform is for safety and uniformity reasons.","output":"Title: Western Cowboy Hat Controversy Leads to Deputy's Retirement in Sublette County Introduction: In Sublette County, Wyoming, a change in the local sheriff's department dress code has led to the retirement of a long-serving deputy. Known for its Western vibe, the county is now witnessing a showdown between tradition and modernity in law enforcement attire. Body: Last month, newly-appointed Sublette County Sheriff Stephen Haskell imposed a change in the dress code within the department. This revamp was aimed at promoting safety and uniformity, but for some, it struck a blow against Western pride and tradition. The decision caused Deputy Gene Bryson, a veteran with 28 years in the department and 40 years in law enforcement, to retire last Friday. For Bryson, who is 70-years-old, the cowboy hat represented more than just a simple accessory. \\"I've had a cowboy hat on since 19. That's what looks good to me in the sheriff's department. It's Western. It's Wyoming,\\" he said. The cowboy hat encapsulates the spirit of the West, which is deeply entwined with the identity of both Sublette County and Wyoming as a whole. Despite the sentiment behind the deputy's decision, Sheriff Haskell remained unwavering in his stance. He argued that the new uniform was implemented for safety and uniformity reasons. While the traditional dress may be associated with pride and heritage, Haskell maintained that modern law enforcement requires a more streamlined and consistent look. The proposed uniform includes tactical attire and black baseball caps, which many believe will help project a unified front and foster a sense of camaraderie among officers. However, not everyone in the community supports the change. Some residents see the cowboy hat as an emblem of Western resilience and a cornerstone of the region's culture. For them, the shift to tactical gear represents a departure from the values and traditions they hold dear. Conclusion: The controversy surrounding the new dress code in Sublette County highlights the delicate balance between preserving local heritage and adapting to contemporary needs. As the clash between Deputy Gene Bryson's cowboy hat and Sheriff Stephen Haskell's modern uniform illustrates, traditions can often be difficult to let go. However, striking a compromise that acknowledges and respects both sides may be key to moving forward as a united law enforcement community in Sublette County and beyond."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Answer a question about this article: The health benefits of dogs can result from contact with dogs in general, and not solely from having dogs as pets. For example, when in the presence of a pet dog, people show reductions in cardiovascular, behavioral, and psychological indicators of anxiety. Other health benefits are gained from exposure to immune-stimulating microorganisms, which, according to the hygiene hypothesis, can protect against allergies and autoimmune diseases. The benefits of contact with a dog also include social support, as dogs are able to not only provide companionship and social support themselves, but also to act as facilitators of social interactions between humans. One study indicated that wheelchair users experience more positive social interactions with strangers when they are accompanied by a dog than when they are not. In 2015, a study found that pet owners were significantly more likely to get to know people in their neighborhood than non-pet owners. What do humans get exposed to with pets that may help them not get sick?","output":"Humans get exposed to immune-stimulating microorganisms when they are in contact with pets, specifically dogs. These microorganisms play a significant role in boosting the immune system, thereby potentially helping humans not get sick. The hygiene hypothesis suggests that exposure to a diverse array of these microorganisms, which are commonly found in the environment as well as on the pets, can protect against allergies and autoimmune diseases. These immune-stimulating microorganisms help humans develop a more robust and well-regulated immune response. By being exposed to these microbes, the human immune system gets trained to better differentiate between harmful and harmless substances. This, in turn, lowers the chances of unnecessary inflammatory responses, which are at the root of allergies and autoimmune diseases. In summary, contact with pets, specifically dogs, exposes humans to immune-stimulating microorganisms, which can be beneficial in strengthening the immune system, reducing the risk of allergies and autoimmune diseases, and ultimately improving overall health."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

But more than 100,000 people - most of them women - do not reach that threshold, because they work for several employers. The government said that it is planning to review the issue later this year. A separate study shows that women still receive far smaller pensions than men. According to the insurance company Zurich, the average woman will have £47,000 less in her pension pot than a man by the time she retires. Citizens Advice said that 72,000 women were missing out on auto-enrolment pensions, which require employers to pay a pension automatically, unless a worker deliberately opts out. The charity said too many people were being shut out of the opportunity to be paid a pension. \\"Many people - particularly women - work several part time jobs, which helps them manage commitments like childcare or study,\\" said Gillian Guy, the chief executive of Citizens Advice. \\"But while in many cases they earn over £10,000, and pay tax on this combined income, they don't have access to a workplace pension and miss out on the opportunity to save for their retirement.\\" The government said in December that it would examine the issue of workers with multiple jobs when it reviews the auto-enrolment programme later this year. \\"There's more to do - especially for people with more than one job - and we're currently reviewing the policy to see how it can be improved,\\" a spokesperson for the Department of Work and Pensions said. The Zurich analysis found that between 2013 and 2016 men received 7.8% of their salary in pension contributions on average, compared to women receiving 7%. It said men tend to work in sectors with more established or generous pension schemes. In addition, women are more likely to take career breaks. \\"This difference in the contributions that they receive from their employer presents a serious - and growing - problem,\\" said Rose St Louis, Zurich's head of partnership development. \\"The triple effect of smaller salaries, career breaks for women and lower contribution rates needs to be addressed: we can't ignore a £47,000 shortfall,\\" she said.","output":"Over 100,000 workers, mainly women, miss out on auto-enrolment pensions due to working multiple jobs and not meeting the £10,000 annual earnings threshold from a single employer, creating significant gender disparities in pension savings."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

The following article contains an answer for the question: What is the first name of the person who depicted dignified aspects of war? , can you please find it?   In late 1854 or early 1855 James Robertson married Beato's sister, Leonilda Maria Matilda Beato. They had three daughters, Catherine Grace (b. 1856), Edith Marcon Vergence (b. 1859), and Helen Beatruc (b. 1861).In 1855 Felice Beato and Robertson travelled to Balaklava, Crimea, where they took over reportage of the Crimean War following Roger Fenton's departure. Beato was ostensibly Robertson's assistant, however the unpredictable conditions of a war-zone forced Beato to assume a more active role. In contrast to Fenton's depiction of the dignified aspects of war, Beato and Robertson showed the destruction and death. They photographed the fall of Sevastopol in September 1855, producing about 60 images. Their Crimean images dramatically changed the way that war was reported and depicted.In February 1858 Beato arrived in Calcutta and began travelling throughout Northern India to document the aftermath of the Indian Rebellion of 1857. During this time he produced possibly the first-ever photographic images of corpses. It is believed that for at least one of his photographs taken at the palace of Sikandar Bagh in Lucknow he had the skeletal remains of Indian rebels disinterred or rearranged to heighten the photograph's dramatic impact (see events at Taku Forts). He was also in the cities of Delhi, Cawnpore, Meerut, Benares, Amritsar, Agra, Simla, and Lahore. Beato was joined in July 1858 by his brother Antonio, who later left India, probably for health reasons, in December 1859. Antonio ended up in Egypt in 1860, setting up a photographic studio in Thebes in 1862. A:","output":"The first name of the person who depicted the dignified aspects of war is Felice Beato.

Is The Holy Roman Empire comprised many petty states numbering more than 300 around 1796. a good answer to this question?","output":"Yes, the statement \\"The Holy Roman Empire comprised many petty states numbering more than 300 around 1796\\" is a good starting point for answering the question. However, to provide a more detailed answer, it is important to expound on the nature of the Holy Roman Empire, its fragmentation, and the role of these petty states within the empire. The Holy Roman Empire was a multi-ethnic and complex political entity that existed from 962 to 1806 in Central Europe. At its peak, it included present-day Germany, the Netherlands, Belgium, Luxembourg, Switzerland, Austria, the Czech Republic, parts of Italy, and eastern France. It was neither a centralized state nor a unified empire, but rather a loose confederation of sovereign territories under the nominal control of a Holy Roman Emperor, who was elected by the prince-electors. The Empire was characterized by a highly fragmented political landscape, in which local rulers held considerable autonomy and power. By the late 18th century, around 1796, the Holy Roman Empire was a patchwork of more than 300 petty states, each with its own ruler, administration, and laws. These states varied greatly in size, population, and power, ranging from large and influential states like the kingdoms of Bavaria and Saxony, to small ecclesiastical territories and independent city-states. The Holy Roman Empire's fragmentation can be traced back to its inception, when the decentralization of power was a key element of its governance structure. The Empire did not have a uniform legal or administrative system, which often led to internal competition and conflicts among its various territories. The volatilities between states were further exacerbated by the religious conflicts, notably the Protestant Reformation in the early 16th century and the subsequent Thirty Years' War (1618-1648), which greatly weakened the central authority and left local rulers to manage their own affairs. The Reichsdeputationshauptschluss (Imperial Recess) of 1803, often referred to as the \\"secularization\\" and \\"mediatization\\" of the Empire, saw the reorganization and redistribution of many of the small ecclesiastical territories, secularized monasteries and imperial cities within the realm. It was an attempt to simplify and consolidate power within the Empire. However, the Holy Roman Empire itself would be dismantled shortly thereafter, following Napoleon Bonaparte's campaigns in Central Europe. In 1806, the last Holy Roman Emperor, Francis II, abdicated the throne and declared the dissolution of the Empire. In summary, the Holy Roman Empire was indeed comprised of more than 300 petty states around 1796. To fully understand this answer, it is essential to recognize the Empire's complex history, the decentralization of authority, and the impact of religious and political conflicts in shaping its highly fragmented political landscape."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

After the jailer died, the mute girl of his grows up to be a beautiful and voluptuous woman. The marques, now an old and disgusting looking widower, makes sexual advances toward her and she bites him and runs off. He then finds out who she is and has her thrown into the dungeon until she changes her mind about his advances. The beggar now is old and has gone completely mad. Shortly after she is thrown in with him, the beggar rapes her. She is let out and the marques pulls his old tricks again until she stabs him to death. The young mute ran until she passed out in a distant forest and was found by a kind man. He and his wife take care of her until she has the beggar's baby. The problem is that he is born on Christmas Morn at Midnight. That bears an awful curse that takes her life and causes her baby son to wear the mark of the beast. Years later, the young boy, still being raised by the couple, escapes their home some nights. On those nights, live stock is always slaughtered by a powerful beast. The couple finds out that it is Leon, their adopted son. A local priest tells then that he is a werewolf and that only love can calm the savage beast. The couple heeds the priest's advice and love keeps the beast at bay. Until that is, when Leon becomes a man and moves away for work. He falls for a young lady but then the beast takes over and Leon's demon emerges and starts to kill his fellows and his loves interest's fiance. As the death toll rises, the other prophecy of the priest comes true. \\"Whatever weakens the spirit will strengthen the wolf\\" .Finally, the hunter becomes the hunted, and Leon, the werewolf is killed, and killed by his own father.

Flight is the primary means of locomotion for most bird species and is used for breeding, feeding, and predator avoidance and escape. Birds have various adaptations for flight, including a lightweight skeleton, two large flight muscles, the pectoralis (which accounts for 15% of the total mass of the bird) and the supracoracoideus, as well as a modified forelimb (wing) that serves as an aerofoil. Wing shape and size generally determine a bird species' type of flight; many birds combine powered, flapping flight with less energy-intensive soaring flight. About 60 extant bird species are flightless, as were many extinct birds. Flightlessness often arises in birds on isolated islands, probably due to limited resources and the absence of land predators. Though flightless, penguins use similar musculature and movements to \\"fly\\" through the water, as do auks, shearwaters and dippers.\\". Can you tell me what it is?

I like to think it was in the heart of Florida, because it was, and is, in my heart. Its name was Dogland. Some people say you can know others if you know the central incidents that shaped their lives. But an incident is an island in time, and to know the effect of the island on those who land there, you must know something about the river they have traveled. And I must warn you before we begin, I don't know that river well. I visit that time and place like a ghost with poor vision and little memory. I look up the river and see fog rolling in. I look down the river, and the brightness of the approaching day blinds me. I see shapes moving behind me and beyond me, but who they are and what they do, I cannot say. I will tell what I know is true, and I will invent what I believe is true, and that, I think, is all you can ask any storyteller to do. I learned the Nix family history from the stories Pa told. Even at the age of four, I suspected that Pa's stories might not be perfectly true. When Pa said we Nixes came to North America as indentured servants working our way out of debtor's prison, Grandma Bette would make a face and say he couldn't know that. When he said we Nixes had Lakota and Ojibwe blood in our veins, Grandma Bette would say she wasn't prejudiced, but it simply wasn't so: she and Pa and his brothers and sisters were dark because her people were Black Dutch, from a part of Holland where everyone had black hair and black eyes. And then Grandma Bette wouldn't say a word for half an hour or more, a very long time for Grandma Bette to be quiet.

Growing up, she cut everyone in our family’s hair; she dyed mine whenever I wanted, and whatever crazy color I wanted, too. Until I was a senior in high school, I had never been to a salon. I don’t even remember why I went this time. Mom was going to have her hair done, and I had tagged along. She asked if I wanted a cut too and I said why not? So while Mom was getting her hair done I looked through the books and picked out a cute pageboy style that I liked. Finally it was my turn and after talking with the stylist and showing her what I wanted, she led me to the shampoo station. Now, as everybody who has ever been to a salon knows, you sit back in the chair with your neck in the indentation and they wash your hair. But I had never been to a salon. When mom washed my hair after dyeing it, I always leaned over the sink. So … I started to climb into the chair and lean over the sink here, too. My mom was mortified and the stylist couldn’t figure out what in the heck I was doing. Mom calls out, “No, Jennifer … you sit in the chair.” I look over my shoulder at her and then realize what I’ve done. Red-faced, I stand up and then turn around to sit and lean back in the chair. I honestly wanted to die right there. I’m pretty sure the stylist thought I was developmentally delayed or something because she talked to me for the rest of the time like one would talk to a three-year-old. Mom tried to explain that I’d never been to a salon before, but I think that just made the situation worse. Thankfully I’ve been to many salons now and understand how everything works, but I’ve never returned to THAT one. Question: What career is Jennifer aiming for? Options:  A. Nutritionist  B.

A:","output":"Answer: Yes, the description provided is indeed a reasonable answer to the question about an agent's job role in the film industry. However, to offer a more detailed and comprehensive answer, let's delve deeper into the roles and responsibilities of talent agents in the film industry. A talent agent, also known as a booking agent or talent representative, serves as an intermediary between artists or professionals in the entertainment industry and potential employers or opportunities. Their primary function is to identify, negotiate, and secure work engagements for their clients, which include actors, authors, film directors, musicians, models, producers, professional athletes, writers, and other professionals in the realm of entertainment.  In the film industry, a talent agent's job role typically involves the following responsibilities: 1.

They attend industry events, film festivals, and showcases to discover new talents and establish connections with potential clients. 2. Career Development: Talent agents provide guidance and advice to their clients on various aspects related to their careers in the film industry. They help actors in selecting appropriate roles and filmmakers in identifying suitable projects that align with their artistic vision and brand. They also advise clients on building their professional skills, creating a public image, and expanding their professional networks. 3. Promotion and Marketing: A key aspect of an agent's job is to promote their clients and their work. Agents create marketing materials, such as portfolios, showreels, and press kits, to showcase their clients' talents. They also utilize their networks and connections within the entertainment industry to garner exposure and secure opportunities for their clients. 4. Negotiation and Contract Management: Talent agents are responsible for negotiating contracts and agreements on behalf of their clients. They handle discussions with production companies, studios, and other potential employers to ensure that their clients receive fair compensation and favorable working conditions. They also work closely with entertainment lawyers in navigating the legal aspects of contracts and agreements. 5. Schedule Coordination: Agents work with their clients to manage their schedules and ensure that they are not overbooked or conflicting with other commitments. They coordinate audition times, meetings with filmmakers and producers, and various publicity and promotional events. 6. Problem Solving and Conflict Resolution: Talent agents often act as a liaison between their clients and various stakeholders in the film industry, such as production companies, studios, and other professionals. They handle grievances, disputes, and other issues that may arise during the course of projects or work engagements. 7. Networking and Relationship Building: An essential aspect of an agent's job is to establish and maintain relationships with key players in the entertainment industry, including producers, casting directors, studio executives, and other agents. These connections enable agents to stay abreast of new projects, potential job opportunities, and industry trends. In summary, an agent's job role in the film industry involves a combination of talent acquisition, career development, promotion and marketing, negotiation and contract management, schedule coordination, problem-solving and conflict resolution, and networking and relationship building. Their primary goal is to ensure that their clients receive the best possible opportunities for professional growth and success in the competitive world of film and entertainment."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Summarize: A letter signed by the prime minister on the green baize table of the cabinet room yesterday afternoon makes real the consequences of Britain's vote to leave the European Union nine months ago. Once the document arrives in Brussels at lunchtime, passed formally into the hands of the European Council, the triggering of Article 50 begins the process of Britain leaving the European Union - a partnership of nations in which the UK has played its own role for more than four decades - for good, or ill. The prime minister will promise later to represent every person in the country during what are likely to be fraught negotiations, including those EU nationals who have made their homes here, whose future is still uncertain. Theresa May will also urge the country to come together, hoping this moment could spell the end of a fractious debate between Leave and Remain. The government's main priorities are clear - withdrawing from European law, controlling immigration and striking a free trade deal from outside the European single market. Yet there are tensions in Parliament, in the prime minister's own party, between Holyrood and Westminster, and of course, among the public over what Britain's future could, or should look like outside the European Union. She, and we, have two years to work it out. Theresa May of course was a Remainer to start with, if not the most full-throated advocate for the EU during the referendum campaign. But after the bloody Tory infighting in the campaign's immediate aftermath, she is sometimes described as being the \\"last grown-up left standing\\". There are doubts in Westminster about the government's capacity to deal with the complexities of what lies ahead, doubts about the Tory Party's capability of sticking together when it gets tough, doubts about the opposition's ability to carry out the kind of intense scrutiny required while this vital set of decisions are debated and discussed over the next two years or so. Above all perhaps, doubts about whether what Theresa May is asking for is even vaguely realistic. What she does or does not achieve in these negotiations will determine her, and the country's, future. Summary:","output":"The decision of the United Kingdom to leave the European Union, a decision made nine months prior, is solidified by a letter signed by Prime Minister Theresa May. Once this letter reaches Brussels, it formally instigates the commencement of Article 50, initiating the formal exit of the UK from the EU, a group of countries it has been partners with for more than 40 years. Prime Minister May pledges to represent all UK citizens during these potentially tense negotiations, including EU individuals who reside in the UK and who face a particularly unsure future. She will also make a nationwide call for unity, seeing this moment as an opportunity to end the rife and divisive debate between those who wished to leave and those who preferred to remain in the EU. The government has outlined its main focuses for future negotiations - the withdrawal from EU law, control over immigration, and securing a free trade agreement outside of the constraints of the European single market. However, the road ahead is not without obstacles. Disagreements exist within Parliament, within the Prime Minister's party, between Holyrood and Westminster, and among the public regarding what form the UK's future outside of the EU should take. There is a two-year window to resolve these issues.  Despite being initially in favor of remaining in the EU, Prime Minister May has emerged as a crucial figure in the Tory Party. She is often referred to as the \\"last grown-up left standing\\" following bitter conflicts within the Party after the referendum. However, there are concerns within Westminster about the government's ability to manage the complexities that lie ahead. Doubts exist about the Party's internal unity, the opposition's capacity to provide intense scrutiny during this crucial decision-making period, and overall, whether Prime Minister May's goals for the negotiation outcomes are even feasible. The results of these negotiations will indubitably shape the political and national future of both May and the UK itself."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant. User will you give you a task.

Alexis-Charles-Henri Clerel de Tocqueville (French: [aleksi SaRl aRi kleRel d@ tokvil]; 29 July 1805 - 16 April 1859) was a French political thinker and historian best known for his works Democracy in America (appearing in two volumes: 1835 and 1840) and The Old Regime and the Revolution (1856). In both of these, he analyzed the improved living standards and social conditions of individuals, as well as their relationship to the market and state in Western societies. Democracy in America was published after Tocqueville's travels in the United States, and is today considered an early work of sociology and political science. Tocqueville was active in French politics, first under the July Monarchy (1830-1848) and then during the Second Republic (1849-1851) which succeeded the February 1848 Revolution. He retired from political life after Louis Napoleon Bonaparte's 2 December 1851 coup, and thereafter began work on The Old Regime and the Revolution. He argued that the importance of the French Revolution was to continue the process of modernizing and centralizing the French state which had begun under King Louis XIV. The failure of the Revolution came from the inexperience of the deputies who were too wedded to abstract Enlightenment ideals. Tocqueville was a classical liberal who advocated parliamentary government, but was skeptical of the extremes of democracy.

Are these two questions asking the same thing?","output":"First answer: Carbon monoxide is a gas that we can't see, smell, or taste. When people breathe it in, it takes the place of the oxygen our bodies need. This can make us feel dizzy, sleepy, or give us a headache. If a person breathes in too much carbon monoxide, they might fall asleep and not wake up. It's not like a boo-boo that hurts, but it's still dangerous because it doesn't let our bodies work properly. Second answer: Some cars make more carbon monoxide than others, especially older cars that don't work as well or don't have special parts called \\"catalytic converters\\" to help clean the air coming out of the car. Bigger cars with larger engines might also make more carbon monoxide because they need more fuel to go. It's important to take care of our cars and follow rules to help keep the air clean for everyone. These two questions are not the same thing.

Known for his excellent track-record, Detective Wallace is a living legend in the city, single-handedly putting away many notorious criminals. Wallace's personal life, however, is in shambles. His relationship with his estranged wife, Jessica, is tense, due to his long hours on the job, and their daughter, Emily, barely knows her father. Act 2: Detective Wallace is assigned to head a new task force designed to bring down Vincent De Luca, a powerful mob boss recently named \\"Public Enemy Number One\\". Wallace, eager to prove his mettle, eagerly embarks on the mission, recruiting a team of dedicated officers, including the talented but inexperienced Officer Sarah Baker. As the task force delves deeper into the criminal underworld, they begin to unravel the complex web of corruption that De Luca has built around himself. Sarah also discovers that fugitive drug lord, Eduardo Sanchez, is in a secret partnership with De Luca. This alliance, however, is something that not even Wallace was aware of, and it raises the stakes for the task force. Act 3: As Wallace's team closes in on De Luca, a new twist emerges. The Sentinel division receives anonymous tips linking Wallace to illegal activities and bribery connected to De Luca's organization. The Chief of Police immediately suspends Wallace and begins a covert investigation, assigning Sarah to head the case against her mentor. Overwhelmed by a mix of loyalty and pursuit of justice, Sarah is torn. However, she's determined to find the truth. As she investigates, Sarah uncovers evidence pointing to a potential setup by De Luca and Sanchez to set Wallace up as the fall guy, eliminating the primary threat against their operations. Act 4: Wallace, feeling betrayed by his own unit, decides to take matters into his own hands. He contacts Jessica, his ex-wife, to help him find the truth. Jessica, a former investigative journalist facing her own struggles, reluctantly agrees to help. Unbeknownst to them, the corruption goes higher up than they ever imagined. The Chief of Police is secretly in league with De Luca and Sanchez – setting up Wallace is part of a larger plan aimed at controlling the city's law enforcement. Act 5: Working together, Wallace and Jessica expose the sinister connections in an effort to clear Wallace's name and save the city from the control of De Luca and Sanchez. Sarah confronts the Chief of Police, who tries to frame her as well, but ultimately fails. In a climactic finale, Wallace and the task force raid De Luca's hideout, leading to a deadly confrontation between Wallace, De Luca, and Sanchez. The Chief of Police is arrested as the truth is revealed. As the dust settles, Wallace receives recognition for his bravery. He receives an honourable discharge, but decides to retire from police work to rekindle his relationship with Jessica and Emily.

While the reviewer did not provide any details about the themes, storytelling, characters, or overall production of the film, they particularly berate the ending, calling it \\"utterly incompetent.\\"  This phrase indicates considerable dissatisfaction, as it strongly criticizes the movie's resolution for being inept, unfit, or unable to achieve the intentions or expectations set up by the rest of the film. The word \\"utterly\\" amplifies this negativity, suggesting it was not only inadequate but overwhelmingly so.  It's important to note that despite this negative comment, we can't fully comprehend the reviewer's overall take on the film, as they did not provide details on other aspects of the movie that could have been satisfactory. Aspects such as cinematography, film editing, sound design, character development, acting performances, among others, can significantly influence the general perception of a movie, in addition to the conclusion. However, taking the critique for its face value, it's safe to say that this critic had significant negative impressions towards the movie's ending, which would likely color their perspective of the film as a whole negatively.

Write a question about the following article: In a rematch of their only loss so far this season, the Patriots faced the Buffalo Bills in a road game. After taking the opening kick, the Bills raced 70 yards all the way to the Patriots 5, but the Patriots defense kept Buffalo out of the end zone, forcing them to kick a 23-yard field goal. On the ensuing kickoff, Walt Powell forced Matthew Slater to fumble, but Shea McClellin recovered for the Patriots at their own 30. The Patriots drained over half of the remainder of the first quarter, going 70 yards to score on a 9-yard touchdown pass from Brady to Amendola. After a Bills three-and-out, the Patriots were given good field at the Bills 45. An offensive pass interference penalty on Amendola moved the ball back to the Patriots 45, but a holding penalty on Robert Blanton of the Bills moved the ball to mid field. A two-yard run by Blount and incomplete pass brought up a 3rd-and-8 from the Bills 48, and Brady hit Edelman with a 47-yard bomb to the 1-yard line, but the gain was nullified on an ineligible man downfield penalty on Marcus Cannon moving the ball back to the Patriots 47. Then Brady hit Hogan on a 53-yard touchdown bomb, increasing the lead to 14-3. Four possessions later, the Bills raced 59 yards in just 5 plays, scoring on a Mike Gillislee 3-yard touchdown rush. After Amendola returned the ball 24 yards to the Patriots 21, the Patriots countered, using just four plays and Brady found Gronkowski on a 53-yard touchdown, increasing the lead to 21-10. The Bills raced 44 yards in 11 plays to the Patriots 31 on their ensuing possession, but Carpenter missed a 49-yard field goal after it hit the upright. Taking over at their own 39, a 6-yard pass to White, a 15-yard pass to Amendola, and a 7-yard pass to Edelman led the Patriot to Bills 33 and Gostkowski kicked a 51-yard field goal, giving the Patriots a 24-10 lead at halftime. Amendola kicked off the second half with fireworks, returning the kick 73 yards to the Bills 24. Two plays later, Brady hit Edelman for a 12-yard touchdown pass, extending the lead to 31-10. The Bills didn't quit, though, using a marathon 75-yard, six minute drive, concluding with Taylor splitting the defense for a 26-yard touchdown run, making it a game again with a 31-17 score. The Patriots countered right back, engineering an 11-play, 75-yard drive with LeGarrette Blount chalking up a 1-yard touchdown run, increasing the lead to 38-17 late in the third quarter. Using Reggie Bush 35 yard kick return, the Bills drove 50 yards to the Patriots 10 in just 4 plays, but on the first play of the fourth quarter, a Taylor pass bounced off the fingertips of Charles Clay and the Bills turned the ball over on downs. The Patriots put the game away on their next drive, marching 76-yards in 13 plays, taking 7:49 off the clock, with Gostkowski adding a 32-yard field goal, giving the Patriots a 41-17 lead with just 7:06 remaining in the game. The Bills drove 52 yards to the Patriots 32 on their next drive, but turned the ball over on downs when Robert Woods was tackled 1-yard short of the first down by Malcolm Butler. The Bills forced a Patriots punt and raced 66 yards in 6 plays, scoring a touchdown on a 1-yard touchdown run by Jonathan Williams with a two-point conversion on a two-yard pass from backup quarterback EJ Manuel to Nick O'Leary trimming the score to 41-25, but only 0:30 remained. After recovering the onside kick, the Patriots took a knee to win the game. Brady was 22/33 for 315 yards and had four touchdown passes to four different receivers (Danny Amendola, Chris Hogan, Rob Gronkowski and Julian Edelman); LeGarette Blount added a running touchdown and Stephen Gostkowski a field goal. Heading into their bye week, the Patriots improved to 7-1, the best record in the league.","output":"How did the Patriots' defense contribute to their win against the Buffalo Bills, and how did Tom Brady's performance with four touchdown passes to different receivers impact the final score of 41-25 in favor of the Patriots?"},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Given the background: In grassland, much of the organic matter added to the soil is from the deep, fibrous, grass root systems. By contrast, tree leaves falling on the forest floor are the principal source of soil organic matter in the forest. Another difference is the frequent occurrence in the grasslands of fires that destroy large amounts of aboveground material but stimulate even greater contributions from roots. Also, the much greater acidity under any forests inhibits the action of certain soil organisms that otherwise would mix much of the surface litter into the mineral soil. As a result, the soils under grasslands generally develop a thicker A horizon with a deeper distribution of organic matter than in comparable soils under forests, which characteristically store most of their organic matter in the forest floor (O horizon) and thin A horizon.  and the situation: In the Kenya-Tanzania border Kenyan grassland gradually merges into Tanzanian forest. Though they had similar soil to start with millions of years ago, today they are two different habitats. At present, Kenya has one of the largest contiguous grassland in Africa. On the other hand, Tanzania boasts one of the largest forest cover in Africa.  Answer the following question: In which place plant roots would play greater role in soil development, Kenya or Tanzania? Answer:","output":"In Kenya, plant roots would play a greater role in soil development as compared to Tanzania. This is because, in the grasslands of Kenya, a significant portion of the organic matter that contributes to soil development comes from the deep, fibrous root systems of grasses. These root systems extend far into the soil, contributing to the overall structure and fertility of the soil by breaking up compacted soil layers and creating pathways for water and nutrients to reach deeper levels. In contrast, in the Tanzanian forests, the principal source of soil organic matter is fallen tree leaves on the forest floor. Although tree roots also contribute to soil development, their impact is comparatively less compared to the extensive grass root systems in grasslands. Furthermore, the Kenyan grasslands experience frequent fires, which destroy aboveground plant material but actually stimulate even greater contributions from roots. The increased root growth following fires helps in the development of a thicker A horizon (topsoil layer) with a deeper distribution of organic matter. In Tanzanian forests, the soil organic matter is mostly stored in the O horizon (forest floor layer) and a thinner A horizon due to the greater acidity, which inhibits the action of certain soil organisms that would otherwise mix surface litter into the mineral soil. In summary, plant roots, specifically those of grasses, play a greater role in soil development in Kenya than in Tanzania due to the grassland ecosystem and the impact of fires stimulating root growth and soil organic matter distribution."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

They describe different responsibilities and roles of the ninth and tenth Baronets, suggesting different contexts or times, which significantly changes the content and meaning conveyed by each. To give a detailed understanding, let's break each sentence down: In Sentence 1, \\"The tenth Baronet was Lord Lieutenant of Denbighshire, and the ninth Baronet served as Lord Lieutenant of Denbighshire and Clwyd.\\" Here, the tenth Baronet is described as being the Lord Lieutenant of Denbighshire alone while the ninth Baronet served as the Lord Lieutenant not just of Denbighshire but also of Clwyd. Conversely, Sentence 2 states \\"The ninth Baronet was Lord Lieutenant of Denbighshire, and the tenth Baronet served as Lord Lieutenant of Denbighshire and Clwyd.\\" In this sentence, the story is flipped. The ninth Baronet is stated to be the Lord Lieutenant of Denbighshire alone, while the tenth Baronet is reported to have been the Lord Lieutenant of both, Denbighshire and Clwyd. The roles of the ninth and tenth Baronets have been swapped between sentences. Thus, the functions, years, or periods in question for the ninth and tenth Baronets must also be different. The two sentences, therefore, report on two different scenarios or moments in history and their information is not interchangeable.

PUBLISHED:. 10:33 EST, 3 December 2013. |. UPDATED:. 12:14 EST, 3 December 2013. A woman whose family was wiped out in a car crash said 'I lost my everybody' in the collision. Elber Twomey was the only survivor after the crash which took the lives of her husband, their son and their unborn child. The suicidal driver of the other vehicle was also killed. 'I lost my everbody': Elber Twomey criticises the police who she blames for causing the crash which killed her husband, her son and her unborn child in Torquay, Devon. Yesterday Mrs Twomey, who was 24 weeks pregnant at the time, said her family would still be alive if police hadn’t pursued the car of 26-year-old Marek Wojiechowski. Emergency services were contacted after he left his wife a suicide note, and when his car was spotted, an officer gave chase, switching on his flashing lights and siren. Wojiechowski then ‘deliberately’ drove straight into the Twomeys family’s VW Golf during their holiday in Torquay, Devon. Oisin Twomey, who was 16 months old, died at the scene. Crash scene: A father, a son and his wife's unborn child all died following this crash in Torquay, Devon, in July last year. Marek Wojiechowski deliberately crashed his vehicle into the Twomey family's VW Golf. Grief: Elber Twomey with her husband Con on their wedding day. He died 10 months after a crash which killed their toddler son. His father Con, 39, died later ten months later in hospital after suffering serious brain injuries. Yesterday Mrs Twomey, who was hospitalised for months and lost her unborn daughter, spoke after the inquest of her son and the Polish taxi-driver. She believes that police driver’s approach was ‘completely wrong’ and caused Wojiechowski to panic. Speaking on the last day of the inquest in Torquay, she said of the day of the crash in July 2012: ‘I lost my everybody. ‘Up to 2.46pm on July 6th I had not a care in the world. ‘I was on holiday with my darling husband and best friend Con, our beautiful little man, baba Oisin and our beautiful unborn daughter. At 2.47pm our wonderful life ended.’ She continued:’I will always be of the opinion that the manner in which the police dealt with Marek that horrific day was completely wrong. ‘I believe that a more cautious and considered response by the police is necessary to protect lives. The lack of this caution has cost me my entire family.’ She continued: ‘I believe it was a misjudgement by the police officer involved to request Marek to stop. ‘He was not driving erratically, he did not have his wife and children with him and he had not indicated that he would end his life by using his car. ‘While I don’t blame the police officer involved personally for my tragic story, I do blame the police service.’ The inquest heard that Wojiechowski had agreed to split with his wife Agnieszka and left a four-page suicide note. Accident victim: Oisin Twomey, aged 16 months, who died at the scene following the crash in Torquay, Devon, last year. She raised the alarm when she found the letter and CCTV cameras recorded him circling a roundabout and driving in a continuous two-mile loop. Police response driver PC Ben Bickford spotted a black car driving in the opposite carriageway and followed to see if it was Wojiechowski. Suicidal: Marek Wojciechowski who caused the crash which wiped out a young family. He drove between 70 and 80 mph to catch up and flashed his lights to signal the driver to pull over. PC Bickford told a previous hearing of the inquest: ‘When I saw that he wasn’t going to stop I pulled back. I am not a trained pursuit driver. The driver was aware of my presence. ‘As we approached the single carriageway he made a deliberate act of accelerating and driving straight into the other carriageway.’ Wojiechowski, a former chef, was arrested at the scene but died from his injuries later that day in hospital. Mr Twomey was transported back to a hospital near his native Cork in Ireland but died in May this year. In a narrative verdict, a. jury of 10 said that both Oisin and Wojiechowski died because the. Pole had ‘suddenly steered his car across the road into the opposite. carriageway and accelerated into oncoming traffic in an attempt to. commit suicide.’ Coroner. for Plymouth, Torbay and South Devon, Ian Arrow said the police officer. involved did all he could but he planned to write to the Association of. Chief Police Officers to ask for a review. He. said: ‘Particular review should be given to how police officers should. approach and deal with distressed or vulnerable individuals. It may. require further with health care professionals.’ Chief Superintendent and head of operations for Devon and Cornwall Police, Jim Nye, said after the inquest that the police officer acted appropriately and in line with national guidelines. Mrs Twomey said she rejected the findings of an IPCC report that said ‘no learning outcomes or organisational learning was identified’ from the tragedy. Highlights:","output":"1.

Both the music and the lyrics intend to evoke a sense of despair, dread, and impending doom. The genre is strongly influenced by the early work of Black Sabbath, who formed a prototype for doom metal with songs such as \\"Black Sabbath\\", \\"Children of the Grave\\", \\"Electric Funeral\\" and \\"Into the Void\\". During the first half of the 1980s, a number of bands from England (Pagan Altar, Witchfinder General), the United States (Pentagram, Saint Vitus, Trouble) and Sweden (Candlemass, Count Raven) defined doom metal as a distinct genre.  - Speed metal is an extreme subgenre of heavy metal music that originated in the late 1970s from new wave of British heavy metal (NWOBHM) roots. It is described by AllMusic as \\"extremely fast, abrasive, and technically demanding\\" music.  - Death metal is an extreme subgenre of heavy metal music. It typically employs heavily distorted and low-tuned guitars, played with techniques such as palm muting and tremolo picking, deep growling vocals and screams, aggressive, powerful drumming featuring double kick or blast beat techniques, minor keys or atonality, abrupt tempo, key, and time signature changes and chromatic chord progressions. The lyrical themes of death metal may invoke slasher film-stylized violence, religion (sometimes Satanism), occultism, Lovecraftian horror, nature, mysticism, mythology, philosophy, science fiction, and politics, and they may describe extreme acts, including mutilation, dissection, torture, rape, cannibalism, and necrophilia.  - Nuclear Assault is an American thrash metal band from New York City, formed after bassist Dan Lilker left Anthrax in 1984. After releasing five full-length albums and touring relentlessly throughout the 1980s and early 1990s, Nuclear Assault split up in 1995. They briefly reunited in 1997 and again in 2002, and are still active today.  - Dimmu Borgir (or or ) is a Norwegian symphonic black metal band from Oslo, Norway, formed in 1993. The name is derived from Dimmuborgir, a volcanic formation in Iceland, the name of which means \\"dark cities\\" or \\"dark castles/fortresses\\" in Icelandic, Faroese and Old Norse. The band has been through numerous lineup changes over the years; guitarist Silenoz and vocalist Shagrath are the only original members who still remain with guitarist Galder being a longstanding member.  - Black metal is an extreme subgenre and subculture of heavy metal music. Common traits include fast tempos, a shrieking vocal style, heavily distorted guitars played with tremolo picking, raw (lo-fi) recording, unconventional song structures, and an emphasis on atmosphere. Artists often appear in corpse paint and adopt pseudonyms.  - Hardcore punk (often abbreviated to hardcore) is a punk rock music genre that originated in the late 1970s. It is generally faster, harder, and more aggressive than other forms of punk rock. Its roots can be traced to earlier punk scenes in San Francisco and Southern California which arose as a reaction against the still predominant hippie cultural climate of the time and was also inspired by New York punk rock and early proto-punk. New York punk had a harder-edged sound than its San Francisco counterpart, featuring anti-art expressions of masculine anger, energy and subversive humor. Hardcore punk generally disavows commercialism, the established music industry and \\"anything similar to the characteristics of mainstream rock\\" and often addresses social and political topics.  - Extreme metal is a loosely defined umbrella term for a number of related heavy metal music subgenres that have developed since the early 1980s. It has been defined as a \\"cluster of metal subgenres characterized by sonic, verbal and visual transgression\\". The term usually refers to a more abrasive, harsher, underground, non-commercialized style or sound associated with the speed metal, thrash metal, death metal, black metal and doom metal genres. With the exception of doom metal, all of these genres are characterized by fast tempos, attesting to their roots in hardcore punk, which has also fused with extreme metal in the forms of crossover thrash, crust punk, grindcore, sludge metal and metalcore. Though many extreme sub-styles are not very well known to mainstream music fans, extreme metal has influenced an array of musical performers inside and outside of heavy metal.  - Thrash metal is an extreme subgenre of heavy metal music characterized by its fast tempo and overall aggression. The songs usually use fast percussive beats and low-register guitar riffs, overlaid with shredding-style lead work. The lyrics often deal with social issues and reproach for The Establishment, using direct and denunciatory language, an approach borrowed from hardcore punk.  - Grindcore is an extreme genre of music that originated in the early to mid-1980s. It draws inspiration from some of the most abrasive-sounding genres  including hardcore punk, thrash metal, crust punk, industrial, death metal and noise rock. Grindcore is characterized by a noise-filled sound that uses heavily distorted, down-tuned guitars, grinding overdriven bass, high speed tempo, blast beats, and vocals which consist of growls and high-pitched shrieks. Early groups like Napalm Death are credited with laying the groundwork for the style. It is most prevalent today in North America and Europe, with popular contributors such as Brutal Truth and Nasum. Lyrical themes range from a primary focus on social and political concerns, to gory subject matter and black humor.  - The Netherlands  is the main constituent country of the Kingdom of the Netherlands. It is a densely populated country located in Western Europe with three island territories in the Caribbean. The European part of the Netherlands borders Germany to the east, Belgium to the south, and the North Sea to the northwest, sharing maritime borders with Belgium, the United Kingdom, and Germany. The largest cities in the Netherlands are Amsterdam, Rotterdam, The Hague and Utrecht. Amsterdam is the country's capital, while The Hague holds the Dutch seat of government and parliament. The name \\"Holland\\" is used to refer informally to the whole of the country of the Netherlands.  - Metal Blade Records is a heavy metal record label founded by Brian Slagel in 1982.

Something as simple as a smile can show friendliness in one culture, embarrassment in another, impatience in a third. Even silence means different things in different places. If you want to avoid making some mistakes when traveling abroad, you should pay attention to the following.  Touch Britain, along with much of Northern Europe and the Far East, has a \\"non-contact\\" culture. In those countries, there is very little physical contact  in people's daily talks. Even brushing someone's arm by accident is the reason for an apology. However, in the high-contact cultures of the Middle East, Latin America, and southern Europe, physical touch is a big part of daily life. What's more, there are different standards for who touches whom and where. In much of the Arab world, men hold hands and kiss each other in greeting, but would never do the same with a woman. In Thailand and Laos, it is taboo  to touch anyone's head, even children's. In South Korea, elders can touch younger people with force when trying to get through a crowd, but younger people can't do the same. Eye contact In most Western countries, frequent eye contact is a sign of confidence and attentiveness . We may think that a conversation partner who looks away is either not listening to us or lying. Of course, this is not the standard around the world. In many Asian, African, and Latin American countries, the unbroken  eye contact would be considered impolite and rude. These cultures consider avoiding eye contact a sign of respect for bosses and elders. In these parts of the world, children won't look at an adult who is speaking to them, and nor will employees look at their bosses.

She had been searching for new ways to reach more people with her art and make it accessible to a broader audience. One day, Emma's close friend, Jack, mentioned that his uncle owned a popular restaurant in town, and he thought it would be a great idea if Emma showcased her artwork there. Excited about this opportunity, Emma eagerly agreed and started preparing for her big debut. As the day of the exhibition neared, Emma worked tirelessly on a series of paintings inspired by the restaurant's theme and menu. She decided to incorporate the vibrant colors and textures of various dishes into her artwork, hoping to create an intimate connection between her paintings and the restaurant that would be hosting them. On the day of the event, everything was going according to plan. The restaurant was packed with patrons admiring Emma's beautiful creations while enjoying their meals. The atmosphere was lively and festive, with the smell of delectable dishes filling the air. Amidst the buzz, Emma felt a strong sense of accomplishment and happiness as people praised her talent and dedication. The event was running smoothly until a sudden and unfortunate accident occurred. One of the waiters, in a moment of distraction, tripped and spilled a tray of red wine, splattering it all over one of Emma's most impressive pieces.

The restaurant owner rushed to Emma's side, apologizing profusely for the incident and offering to compensate her for the damaged piece. However, Emma insisted that the artwork was a part of the experience, and that accidents happen for a reason. She decided to embrace the moment and adapt her painting to incorporate the wine stains, transforming it into a serendipitous collaboration between herself and the restaurant staff. As Emma continued to work on the wine-stained canvas, the audience was intrigued by her resilience and adaptability. The restaurant-goers who had previously enjoyed her work now had a newfound appreciation for her creativity and courage.

Brazil routed Japan in Singapore thanks to a quite magnificent individual performance from star striker and captain Neymar. The forward bagged all four of their goals - including a perfect hat-trick - in a 4-0 victory and he was brilliant throughout. For his first goal, Brazil's favourite son rounded the goalkeeper and slotted home, and then coolly passed one into the back of the net and completed his hat-trick with a rebound before heading in his fourth and final strike with just nine minutes remaining. Host commentator A lovely left-footed outside-of-the-foot pass through the middle splits open the","output":"Japan defense line. Neymar runs onto the ball, brilliantly controlling it with the outside of his right foot. Japan's goalkeeper, trying to narrow the angle, comes running off his line, but the Brazilian starlet is too quick and composed for him. He gently touches the ball past the advancing keeper with his left foot and then rounds him with ease. With the goal at his mercy and Japanese defenders desperately trying to rush back, Neymar keeps his cool and effortlessly slots the ball into the empty net. The Singapore crowd erupts in applause, appreciating the genius of the Brazilian maestro. That’s Neymar's first goal. For his second goal, Neymar showcases amazing vision and composure. After some brilliant build-up play by Brazil, the ball comes to Neymar who is positioned about 20 yards from the goal. He takes one look at the goal, and instead of power, he opts for accuracy. He passes the ball as if he were a pool player choosing a precise angle and the ball finds its way into the bottom right of the net, leaving the keeper flatfooted. His coolness under immense pressure is absolutely awe-inspiring. That's his second goal. For the third goal, Neymar once again displays his striker's instincts as he pounces on a rebound. With a powerful shot from outside the box, the Japanese goalkeeper manages to parry away the initial effort. But the ball ricochets straight to Neymar, who puts his foot through it from close range and completes his hat trick. His anticipation and opportunistic effort perfectly manifest his brilliance.  Finally, the fourth goal comes from a header. As the Brazil midfielder swings in a perfect cross from the right flank, Neymar positions himself well among the Japanese defenders. He makes a well-timed leap, meets the ball with precision and his header finds the bottom corner of the goal. The ball nestles in the net and completes Neymar's magnificent virtuoso display. Relentless from start to finish, Neymar demonstrates why he's been so highly rated. His exuberance, commitment, and sheer soccer brilliance lights the game up, as he leads Brazil to an emphatic 4-0 victory over Japan. His sensational performance perfectly demonstrates how one player can single-handedly lead the team to victory, making this match a perfect display of Neymar in his prime."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Continue iterating through the outer list until all inner lists have been processed. 6. Return the list of maximum numbers. Here is a justification of the steps: - Step 1: We need a list where we will store the maximums. Initializing it will help us to keep track of the sequence of maximum numbers in the order of the internal lists. - Step 2 & 5: In order to determine the maximum number of each list, we iterate through the outer list, processing one inner list at a time. - Step 3: For each inner list, we determine the maximum number by iterating through its elements and using a temporary variable to store the maximum number found so far. This ensures that we are accurately identifying the true maximum number within each list. - Step 4: We add the maximum number found in each inner list to max_numbers. - Step 6: Once the maximum numbers have been determined for all inner lists, we return the max_numbers list as output.

Like many farmers in the Midwest, Poskin is concerned about getting caught in the middle of a trade war, as Trump ramps up economic pressure on China.

The trade tensions have also rattled global markets, which until recently had performed strongly. Trump's tariff decision was meant to punish Chinese companies that benefit from unfair access to U.S. technology. U.S. businesses have long bristled at Beijing's requirement that they transfer technology to Chinese companies as a condition of entering the Chinese market. U.S. businesses have also had their technology stolen through cyberattacks. \\"We have a tremendous intellectual property theft situation going on,\\" Trump said during the signing ceremony Thursday.
