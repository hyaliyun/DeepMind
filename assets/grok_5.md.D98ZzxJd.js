You will be given a task. You must generate a detailed and long answer. Question: I'm taking a test and have to guess the right answer to the question after the article. Article: Parents have widely different views on the problem of pocket money. Four new fathers were asked this question and this is how they answered. Ashish Khanna: Although many argue that pocket money helps develop children's sense of value, I don't agree. I wouldn't give my child any pocket money. First of all, I never got pocket money and I seem to have a good value for money. If my child ever needed something and I felt it was a reasonable   request, I would buy it for him. Sharad Sanghi: No, I wouldn't give my child pocket money because I don't want to create the perception   of \\"her\\" money and \\"my\\" money. Besides, if I refuse to buy her something that I think is bad for her, she may buy it with her pocket money _ In this way, I would lose control over my child's requests. I feel it also encourages children to care more about money than anything else. I don't want my child to start judging other children by the amount of money or pocket money they have. Rakesh Shah: Yes, I would give my child pocket money because I feel that children should learn to spend money properly. I will give him a fixed amount every month and if he spends the money before the month is over, he will learn a lesson and not spend money so freely. He will learn what his limitations   are and feel the difficulty when he has to pay for something that is over his own pocket. Rajiv Patel: Yes, I would give my child pocket money because it is important that he learns to manage money. But I would not give it to him on a weekly or monthly basis. He would have to earn it. If he helped me finish some of my jobs or helped his mother with housework, I would reward him. This helps him realize that \\"money does not grow on trees\\" and it requires hard work to earn money. Question: What do Rakesh Shah and Rajiv Patel have in common? Options: A: They want their children to learn to manage money from an early age. B: They ask their children to get pocket money by working. C: They teach their children the difficulty of making money. D: They allow their children to spend money freely.

Melatonin is a natural hormone produced by your pineal gland located in your brain. It acts like a neurotransmitter, or chemical messenger, to activate certain pathways in your brain. - It forms an barrier between your brain cells and the body that's responsible for producing melatonin hormone. You'll find that getting regular periods to regulate your mood can prevent you from being able to follow a normal schedule.; - If you don't take melatonin, it can suppress the melatonin secretion. The hpv vaccine (ive) is the first dose for 30 people to develop melatonin.; - Once this phase begins, your brain reacts with melatonin and shifts up from there, producing pain and a neurotransmitter. These neurotransmitters are thought to relieve symptoms, but melatonin has drawbacks as well.; - Its role in establishing a sleep cycle has been recognized; however, recent research indicates it may be involved in other body functions as well. In the usa, melatonin is available over-the-counter as a dietary supplement and is therefore not regulated by the fda.;","output":"Its role in establishing a sleep cycle has been recognized; however, recent research indicates it may be involved in other body functions as well. In the usa, melatonin is available over-the-counter as a dietary supplement and is therefore not regulated by the fda. Explanation: - The first option is wrong because melatonin does not form a barrier between brain cells and the body. It helps regulate sleep and can improve mood, but it doesn't prevent following a normal schedule. - The second option is incorrect because it mixes unrelated information about the hpv vaccine and melatonin secretion. Melatonin is a natural hormone, not related to vaccines. - The third option is not correct because it talks about brain reacting with melatonin and producing pain, which does not make sense. Melatonin is usually associated with sleep regulation and does not cause pain. So, the correct answer is about melatonin's role in establishing a sleep cycle, its possible involvement in other body functions, and its availability as an over-the-counter supplement."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant, who knows every language and how to translate one language to another.

Information:  - A character-oriented terminal is a type of computer terminal that communicates with its host one character at a time, as opposed to a block-oriented terminal that communicates in blocks of data. It is the most common type of data terminal, because it's easy to implement and program. Connection to the mainframe computer or terminal server is achieved via RS-232 serial links, Ethernet or other proprietary protocols.  - In system programming, an interrupt is a signal to the processor emitted by hardware or software indicating an event that needs immediate attention. An interrupt alerts the processor to a high-priority condition requiring the interruption of the current code the processor is executing. The processor responds by suspending its current activities, saving its state, and executing a function called an \\"interrupt handler\\" (or an interrupt service routine, ISR) to deal with the event. This interruption is temporary, and, after the interrupt handler finishes, the processor resumes normal activities. There are two types of interrupts: hardware interrupts and software interrupts.  - A computer terminal is an electronic or electromechanical hardware device that is used for entering data into, and displaying data from, a computer or a computing system. Early terminals were inexpensive devices but very slow compared to punched cards or paper tape for input, but as the technology improved and video displays were introduced, terminals pushed these older forms of interaction from the industry. A related development was timesharing systems, which evolved in parallel and made up for any inefficiencies of the user's typing ability with the ability to support multiple users on the same machine, each at their own terminal.  - The IBM 3270 is a class of block oriented computer terminal (sometimes called \\"display devices\\") introduced by IBM in 1971 normally used to communicate with IBM mainframes. The 3270 was the successor to the IBM 2260 display terminal. Due to the text colour on the original models, these terminals are informally known as \\"green screen\\" terminals. Unlike a character-oriented terminal, the 3270 minimizes the number of I/O interrupts required by transferring large blocks of data known as data streams, and uses a high speed proprietary communications interface, using coaxial cable.  - vi is a screen-oriented text editor originally created for the Unix operating system. The portable subset of the behavior of vi and programs based on it, and the ex editor language supported within these programs, is described by (and thus standardized by) the Single Unix Specification and POSIX.  - IBM mainframes are large computer systems produced by IBM since 1952. During the 1960s and 1970s, the term mainframe computer was almost synonymous with IBM products due to their marketshare. Current mainframes in IBM's line of business computers are developments of the basic design of the IBM System/360.  - Coaxial cable, or coax (pronounced ), is a type of cable that has an inner conductor surrounded by a tubular insulating layer, surrounded by a tubular conducting shield. Many coaxial cables also have an insulating outer sheath or jacket. The term coaxial comes from the inner conductor and the outer shield sharing a geometric axis. Coaxial cable was invented by English engineer and mathematician Oliver Heaviside, who patented the design in 1880. Coaxial cable differs from other shielded cable used for carrying lower-frequency signals, in that the dimensions of the cable are controlled to give a precise, constant conductor spacing, which is needed for it to function efficiently as a transmission line.  - The text-only monochrome IBM 2260 cathode ray tube (CRT) video display terminal (Display Station) plus keyboard was a 1964 predecessor to the more-powerful IBM 3270 terminal line which eventually was extended to support color text and graphics.  - XEDIT is a visual editor for VM / CMS using block mode IBM 3270 terminals .

Republicans hope to jump-start their drive to expand the Senate majority Tuesday night by nominating challengers against Democratic senators in three states that President Donald Trump carried. But one of those primaries could instead take a deep-red state off the table for the GOP.      The marquee race is in West Virginia, where Washington Republicans are hoping to deny once-imprisoned coal baron Don Blankenship the GOP nomination to face Democratic Sen. Joe Manchin. President Donald Trump on Monday called on GOP primary voters to reject Blankenship and choose another candidate because Blankenship “can’t win” a general election against Manchin in November.      Story Continued Below      There are also primaries Tuesday in Indiana, North Carolina and Ohio — all of which are certain to define the political landscape, with incumbents facing primary challenges and another House special election brewing in Ohio, where both parties are also choosing candidates for governor.      Polls close at 7 p.m. in Indiana and at 7:30 p.m. in North Carolina, Ohio and West Virginia. Here are POLITICO’s 7 things to watch:      1. Can Republicans dodge the Blankenship bullet?      The last-minute push to scuttle Blankenship’s bid — including Trump’s tweet on Monday — is a good barometer of GOP concern. While there’s been no public polling in the final two weeks of the race, internal surveys indicate Blankenship has bounced back into contention for the Republican nomination after an initial GOP barrage knocked him off his perch in April.      There’s also concern that the two other major candidates — Rep. Evan Jenkins and state Attorney General Patrick Morrisey — will split the anti-Blankenship vote evenly. Trump’s tweet notably did not take sides, instead urging voters to back either alternative.      Blankenship’s baggage is obvious: He was convicted of violating safety standards in the Upper Big Branch mine disaster, which killed 29 miners, and was released from jail only a year ago. After his release, he settled in Nevada, not West Virginia. More recently, he’s referred to Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell (Ky.) in television ads as “Cocaine Mitch” and made racially charged comments about McConnell’s family.      Manchin has won five statewide elections in his career: one for secretary of state, two for governor, a special election for Senate and a full term two years later. Seeking reelection in a state Trump carried by a whopping 42 percentage points, Manchin could be in the fight of his political life — unless the GOP nominates the wrong candidate.

Seeking the Trump mantle in Indiana      Trump hasn’t weighed in on the GOP Senate primary in Indiana, but he’s been a frequent presence on the campaign trail.      Mike Braun, the favorite, is a self-funder who says Trump “paved the way” for a candidate who has spent most of his career in business, not politics. Rep. Todd Rokita has been traveling the state with a cardboard cutout of the president, and he donned a red Make America Great Again hat in a recent campaign ad. Rep. Luke Messer wants to nominate Trump for the Nobel Peace Prize in 2019, based on the early negotiations with North Korea over its nuclear weapons program.      In recent days, Messer and Rokita have attacked Braun, citing his long history of voting in Democratic primaries. But Trump’s trajectory — the president was a long-time donor to Democratic political candidates before running as a Republican — casts doubt on whether that is still grounds for excommunication in Trump’s GOP.      3. House of pain      Trump’s call to “drain the swamp” is running head-long into the ambitions of up-and-coming GOP politicians.      Jenkins, Messer and Rokita enter the Tuesday primaries as underdogs and could find their political careers on ice if they fall short. Each is ambitious: Rokita, first elected in the 2010 Republican wave, has the longest tenure in the House of the three. Jenkins switched parties to challenge then-Rep. Nick Rahall (D-W.Va.) in 2014.      Across the map, Republicans are counting on House members in a number of key races this fall. National Republicans believe Rep. Martha McSally is the party's best nominee for a Senate seat in Arizona, over one of her bomb-throwing conservative primary challengers. Rep. Kevin Cramer (R-N.D.) is the party’s likely nominee against Sen. Heidi Heitkamp (D-N.D.) in a state Trump carried by 36 points. Rep. Marsha Blackburn (R-Tenn.) will try to keep retiring Sen. Bob Corker’s seat in GOP hands in Tennessee.      One GOP House member likely to prevail on Tuesday in his bid for a nomination for higher office: Rep. Jim Renacci, who is seeking to challenge Sen. Sherrod Brown (D-Ohio) this fall. Renacci has Trump’s endorsement in the primary against self-funding businessman Mike Gibbons.      4. Another wild special election in Ohio      A proxy battle between former House colleagues has stirred up the special election to replace Rep. Pat Tiberi in Ohio, pitting old foes against each other in this Republican primary.      Rep. Jim Jordan, a co-founder of the House Freedom Caucus, has lined up behind Melanie Leneghan in the Republican primary, while Tiberi is boosting state Sen. Troy Balderson. Multiple outside groups are involved on both sides, and Jordan and Tiberi appeared in dueling TV ads for their endorsed candidates. Tim Kane, a first-time candidate and veteran who’s self-funding his bid, could also win, having avoided the increasingly bitter back-and-forth between Balderson, Leneghan and their allies.      But Balderson backers say that if Leneghan gets the GOP nomination, she’ll put Ohio’s 12th District — a Republican seat for decades — at risk in the Aug. 7 special election, by alienating suburban Columbus voters in a district that President Donald Trump won by 11 points in 2016.      Republicans are closely watching the Democratic primary, where Franklin County Recorder Danny O’Connor led the pack in fundraising. O’Connor told POLITICO in March that he wouldn’t be supporting Nancy Pelosi’s leadership, a move that mirrors Rep. Conor Lamb’s strategy in southwestern Pennsylvania.      5. Contrasting styles in Democrats’ biggest primary      The Democratic gubernatorial primary in Ohio has basically come down to two contenders: Richard Cordray, the buttoned-up former Consumer Financial Protection Bureau chief, and Dennis Kucinich, the left-leaning former congressman. Cordray has support from a broad range of “establishment” Democrats as well as Sen. Elizabeth Warren, and he has talked up his time protecting Americans’ wallets at the CFPB, but Kucinich has framed himself as the only candidate who can energize grassroots progressives in the primary — and blue-collar voters in the general. A number of Bernie Sanders backers have jumped behind Kucinich, including the nonprofit group Our Revolution.      Both candidates have hit each other for various progressive apostasies — Cordray’s old “A” rating from the NRA, Kucinich’s words of praise for Trump in the past — but the primary has largely been a contest about which type of populism best fits the political moment in the Democratic Party, and whether the candidates can muster sufficient enthusiasm from general election voters to give Democrats a new foothold in the heart of the Midwest this November.      Cordray has more money, endorsements and support in the sparse public polling that’s been available — but Kucinich has lurked within striking distance.      6. GOP congressmen face primary challengers in North Carolina — again      Republican Reps. Robert Pittenger and Walter Jones face stiff primary challenges on Tuesday, though Republicans watching the races expect both to survive. Pittenger opponent Mark Harris and Jones foe Scott Dacey have tried to question the members’ commitment to the Trump agenda — a strategy Republican primary opponents are using throughout the country.      If Pittenger and Jones weather their GOP challengers, they’ll face distinctly different post-primary paths. Jones, who represents a deep red district in eastern North Carolina, would coast in the general election, and has said he won’t run for reelection in 2020.      But Pittenger, unlike Jones, will go on to face a serious general election fight in the Charlotte suburbs, an area that’s trended away from Republicans in the last year. Democrat Dan McCready, a veteran and businessman, outraised both Pittenger and Harris, holding more cash on hand ahead of November.      7. What are the latest signs of Democratic enthusiasm?      Democrats have been turning out at higher-than-usual rates in 2017 and 2018 so far, propelling them to victories in special elections in southwestern Pennsylvania and Alabama, as well as dozens of state legislative seats. Turnout in Tuesday’s primaries will provide yet another window into Democratic enthusiasm in a handful of House races that are expected to be competitive in November.      “If you’re not seeing the increased Democratic enthusiasm and energy on their side, you’re not paying attention,” said Matt Borges, former chairman of the Ohio Republican Party. “Primary turnout will give us some indication as to what that looks like here.”      In particular, political operatives are watching turnout around Columbus and Cincinnati, Charlotte and Raleigh, all home to swaths of suburban voters — and potentially vulnerable Republican House incumbents. ||||| Republican voters rallied behind candidates aligned with President Trump and party leaders in a trio of pivotal Senate primaries Tuesday, reinvigorating the GOP’s bid to hold and possibly expand on its majority in midterm elections.      State Attorney General Patrick Morrisey won in West Virginia, defeating Rep. Evan Jenkins and divisive candidate Don Blankenship. Wealthy businessman Mike Braun prevailed in Indiana, defeating a pair of congressmen by emulating the president with an outsider campaign. In Ohio, Rep. James B. Renacci clinched his nomination with the support of the president.      In his concession speech, Blankenship blamed his loss on Trump’s decision to come out against him instead of support him.      “Thanks for playing, @DonBlankenship. #WVSen,” Team Mitch, the account for Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell (R-Ky.), sarcastically tweeted Tuesday night.      The results capped a dramatic final week in which Trump used his Twitter bully pulpit to persuade voters not to pick Blankenship and throw away a shot at a winnable race. Republicans are defending a fragile 51-49 Senate majority, which they are increasingly framing as a last line of defense against a Democratic takeover of Congress.      Trump’s unpopularity in the suburbs and exurbs where Republicans have built their House majority has led GOP leaders to conclude that the lower chamber of Congress may be all but gone in November. That has spurred them to wage an urgent campaign to hold the Senate to protect Trump and his agenda next year. But Trump’s unpredictable nature and the swirl of controversies surrounding him has made their task more difficult.            Former Massey Energy CEO Don Blankenship, who is campaigning for the Republican nomination for U.S. Senate in West Virginia, right, speaks with an attendee during a campaign event in Bluefield, W.Va. (Luke Sharrett/Bloomberg News)      The rise of Braun and the tone of the Republican campaigns in all three states underscored the deep animosity toward Washington that has persisted in the GOP even after Trump’s election. Braun ran in Trump’s mold, deriding the “swamp” and using his more traditional opponents as foils. Morrisey ran an ad in which a mountain smashes the U.S. Capitol.      Tuesday’s vote kicked off a busy stretch of the midterm primary season, with more than two dozen additional states set to vote before July 4.      In Ohio, the Democratic establishment prevailed as former Consumer Financial Protection Bureau director Richard Cordray captured the gubernatorial nomination, defeating former congressman Dennis Kucinich.      In all three states and North Carolina, House primaries offered a lens into the battle for control of the lower chamber of Congress. Rep. Robert Pittenger (R-N.C.) became the first sitting House member to lose in a primary this year. With almost all of the vote tallied, he trailed Mark Harris, a former Baptist pastor in Charlotte, and conceded the race.      In West Virginia, a wild Senate primary with three leading candidates hurtled to its conclusion with Trump and other top Republicans trying to stop Blankenship, a former coal executive who has served a year in prison and has used racial epithets to describe black people and those of Chinese descent.      View Graphic Another House Republican falls short in a bid for higher office      With more than 90 percent of the vote tallied, Morissey led Jenkins 35 percent to 29 percent. Blankenship was a distant third at 20 percent.      Another three-way contest wrapped up in Indiana, where Braun, a distributing and logistics executive, loaned his campaign more than 5 million of his own money en route to defeating Reps. Luke Messer and Todd Rokita.      Braun sought to draw a sharp contrast with Rokita and Messer. In one ad, he erected cardboard cutouts of his opponents, both pictured wearing dark suits and red ties. In the ad, he asked people to try to tell them apart.      West Virginia and Indiana represent two of the Republican Party’s best chances to bolster its Senate majority in November. They are part of a GOP firewall of 10 states Trump won and a Democratic senator is defending.      Fears about nominating a candidate outside the mainstream escalated in recent weeks, particularly in West Virginia.      Republican leaders had worried that a win by Blankenship would cost them a plum shot at defeating Sen. Joe Manchin III (D). Trump won West Virginia by about 42 percentage points in 2016.      They were also concerned that the controversies surrounding Blankenship might spread to other key battlegrounds, dragging down Republican candidates across the country. It has caused painful memories of Roy Moore, the Alabama Republican who lost a long-held Republican seat last year after The Washington Post reported that he made unwanted sexual advances to teenage girls when he was in his 30s.      In the West Virginia Senate race, Republican leaders spent weeks warning that voting for Blankenship would be the wrong choice for a simple reason: He would be a weak candidate in the general election. They were hopeful that enough voters like Tom Vogel of Charleston would show up Tuesday. Vogel said he voted for Morrisey.      “Don Blankenship is just not going to win in November. And Morrisey is the better man anyway. He has the conservative views that I have,” Vogel said.      Mitchell Eggleston of Charleston said he voted for Jenkins — as a means of stopping Blankenship.      “I just can’t vote for Don Blankenship. There is no doubt that he was responsible for that mine accident. I don’t get into the details of politics, but I just think that he should not be involved in the state at all,” he said.      Robert Ehman of Charleston, W.Va., who voted for Blankenship, called him an “honest man” and brushed aside his imprisonment for conspiring to violate mine safety regulations after an explosion at one of his company’s mines killed 29 people in 2010.      “I think we need someone like him that’s a fresh face,” Ehman said.      Blankenship aggressively attacked McConnell in his campaign. He labeled him “Cocaine Mitch” in ads, referring to a drug bust on a ship owned by the company his father-in-law started.      He has called McConnell’s­ ­father-in-law, who was born in China, a “wealthy China person” and called out his “China family.” McConnell’s wife, Elaine Chao, is the secretary of transportation. She immigrated to the United States from Taiwan as a child.      Blankenship defended his language to a Roll Call reporter, saying, “We’re confused on our staff as to how it can be racist when there’s no mention of a race. There’s no race. Races are negro, white caucasian, Hispanic, Asian.”      He also faced an onslaught from mainstream Republicans. An organization called Mountain Families PAC that has ties to McConnell allies ran advertisements criticizing Blankenship, highlighting how badly GOP leaders wanted to defeat him.      Trump took to Twitter on Monday after McConnell encouraged him to speak out, urging voters not to pick Blankenship and reminding them of the Alabama debacle.      Braun will take on Sen. Joe Donnelly, a centrist Democrat who has been long been a top target of Republican strategists. Trump won Indiana by 19 points.      In the Ohio governor’s race, Cordray will face state Attorney General Mike DeWine, who defeated Lt. Gov. Mary Taylor for the Republican nomination. Gov. John Kasich (R), whose moderate views have put him at odds with many in his party, is term-limited.      Party strategists were watching a handful of House primaries Tuesday, including a competition for an open seat outside Columbus that triggered a showdown between moderate and conservative Republicans.      Renacci, who was the front-runner for the Republican nomination headed into Tuesday’s vote, will face Democratic Sen. Sherrod Brown.      Vice President Pence’s older brother Greg Pence, meanwhile, won the Republican nomination in Indiana’s 6th District.      Afi Scruggs in Cleveland, Daniel Heyman in Charleston, W.Va., and David Weigel, Michael Scherer and Mike DeBonis in Washington contributed to this report. ||||| Write a summary.","output":"Midterm Republican primaries have shown support for candidates aligned with President Trump and party leaders in critical Senate elections, indicating a revitalization in efforts to build the GOP's majority.

If the question is unanswerable, say \\"unanswerable\\". Compared to other team sports, the National Football League preseason is very structured. Every NFL team plays exactly four pre-season exhibition games a year, two at home and two away, with the exception of two teams each year who play a fifth game, the Pro Football Hall of Fame Game. These exhibition games, most of which are held in the month of August, are played for the purpose of helping coaches narrow down the roster from the offseason limit of 90 players to the regular-season limit of 53 players. While the scheduling formula is not as rigid for preseason games as they are for the regular season, there are numerous restrictions and traditions that limit the choices of preseason opponents; teams are also restricted on what days and times they can play these games. Split-squad games, a practice common in baseball and hockey, where a team that is scheduled to play two games on the same day splits their team into two squads, are prohibited. The NFL has played exhibition games in Europe, Japan, Canada, Australia (including the American Bowl in 1999) and Mexico to spread the league's popularity (a game of this type was proposed for China but, due to financial and logistical problems, was eventually canceled). The league has tacitly forbidden the playing of non-league opponents, with the last interleague game having come in 1972 and the last game against a team other than an NFL team (the all-NFL rookie College All-Stars) was held in 1976. Exhibition games are quite unpopular with many fans, who resent having to pay regular-season prices for two home exhibition games as part of a season-ticket package. Numerous lawsuits have been brought by fans and classes of fans against the NFL or its member teams regarding this practice, but none have been successful in halting it.[citation needed] The Pro Bowl, traditionally played after the end of the NFL season (since 2011 is played the week prior to the Super Bowl), is also considered an exhibition game.

Given the following context:  While dancing at the Palais Royale in Akron, Ohio, Bubbles, a cynical blonde chorine, and Judy O'Brien, an aspiring young ballerina, meet Jimmy Harris, the scion of a wealthy family. Both women are attracted to Jimmy, a tormented young man who is still in love with his estranged wife Elinor. Back in New York, Bubbles finds work in a burlesque club, while Madame Basilova, the girls' teacher and manager, arranges an audition for Judy with ballet impresario Steve Adams. En route to the audition, Madame Basilova is run over by a car and killed, and Judy, intimidated by the other dancers, flees before she can meet Steve. As she leaves the building, Judy shares an elevator with Steve, who offers her a cab ride, but she is unaware of who he is and rejects his offer. Soon after, Bubbles, now called Tiger Lily the burlesque queen, offers Judy a job as her stooge in the Bailey Brothers burlesque show and, desperate, she accepts. One night, both Jimmy and Steve attend the performance, and Judy leaves with Jimmy and tears up the card that Steve left for her. The next night, while at a nightclub with Judy, Jimmy has a fistfight with his ex-wife's new husband, and the next day their pictures appear in the newspaper. Bubbles, furious with Judy for stealing Jimmy, appears at the girl's apartment, where she finds Jimmy drunk on the doorstep and sweeps him away to the marriage bureau. Meanwhile, Steve's secretary, Miss Olmstead, also sees Judy's picture in the paper and identifies her as the dancer who had come to audition. That night, Steve attends Judy's performance at which the audience is given a lecture by Judy about the evils of viewing women as objects. This is followed by a fight between her and Bubbles over Jimmy. Hauled into night court, Judy is sentenced to ten days in jail but is bailed out by Steve. The next day, when Judy goes to meet her benefactor, she recognizes Steve, who hails her as his new discovery and promises to make her a star.  answer the following question:  What is the full name of the person who accepts a job in the Bailey Brothers burlesque show out of desperation?

Lindsey was much stronger than Megan since  Select from: -Lindsey was a gym rat who worked out at least five days a week. -Megan was a gym rat who worked out at least five days a week.","output":"Lindsey was much stronger than Megan since Lindsey was a gym rat who worked out at least five days a week. While both Lindsey and Megan were dedicated to their fitness routines, Lindsey's commitment to consistently pushing her limits in the gym and focusing on strength-building exercises had given her an undeniable advantage in terms of physical prowess. Not only did Lindsey prioritize weightlifting, incorporating various functional movements targeting different muscle groups, but she also followed a meticulously planned workout program that maximized muscle hypertrophy and strength gains. From heavy compound lifts like squats, deadlifts, and bench presses to isolation exercises targeting smaller muscles, Lindsey made sure her workouts were well-rounded and comprehensive. This allowed her to excel in comparison to her peers, including Megan. On the other hand, Megan, while also a frequent gym-goer, had a different focus in her workouts. She spent more time on cardiovascular endurance and flexibility exercises, which contributed to her overall fitness but did not necessarily result in the same level of strength that Lindsey had achieved. Megan's typical workout routine involved a mix of high-intensity interval training (HIIT), steady-state cardio, and yoga – all of which were fantastic for her general well-being, but simply did not yield the same raw power that Lindsey had cultivated. Moreover, Lindsey made a point of adhering to proper nutrition and supplementing her diet to support her strength training regimen. This included consuming an optimal balance of macronutrients like protein, carbohydrates, and fats, as well as monitoring her micronutrient intake to ensure that her body was receiving all the essential vitamins and minerals necessary for growth and recovery. By contrast, Megan maintained a healthy but slightly less structured diet that, while beneficial for her overall health, did not give her the same edge in the strength department. Outside of the gym, Lindsey also took advantage of various recovery techniques to further enhance her strength gains. These included practices like foam rolling, massage, and proper sleep, in addition to staying hydrated and managing stress levels. Megan, while conscious of these factors to some degree, did not place as much emphasis on them, which may have contributed to the difference in their strength capabilities. In summary, Lindsey was much stronger than Megan due to her unwavering commitment to rigorous and purposeful strength training, a well-planned and nutrient-dense diet, and a focus on optimizing recovery. Despite sharing a love for fitness, the marked contrast between the two women's workout routines, goals, and priorities ultimately put Lindsey at the forefront when it came to sheer physical strength."},{"instruction":"You are a teacher.

The company, retaining the title \\"Sadler's Wells Opera\\", opened at the Coliseum on 21 August 1968, with a new production of Mozart's Don Giovanni, directed by Sir John Gielgud. Though this production was not well received, the company rapidly established itself with a succession of highly praised productions of other works. Arlen died in January 1972, and was succeeded as managing director by Lord Harewood.The success of the 1968 Mastersingers was followed in the 1970s by the company's first Ring cycle, conducted by Goodall, with a new translation by Andrew Porter and designs by Ralph Koltai.  The cast included Norman Bailey, Rita Hunter and Alberto Remedios. In Harewood's view, among the highlights of the first ten years at the Coliseum were the Ring, Prokofiev's War and Peace, and Richard Strauss's Salome and Der Rosenkavalier. The company's musical director from 1970 to 1977 was Charles Mackerras. Harewood praised his exceptional versatility, with a range \\"from The House of the Dead to Patience.\\" Among the operas he conducted for the company were Handel's Julius Caesar starring Janet Baker and Valerie Masterson; five Janáček operas; The Marriage of Figaro with pioneering use of 18th century performing style; Massenet's Werther; Donizetti's Mary Stuart with Baker; and Sullivan's Patience. The company took the production of the last to the Vienna Festival in 1975, along with Britten's Gloriana. Sir Charles Groves succeeded Mackerras as musical director from 1978 to 1979, but Groves was unwell and unhappy during his brief tenure. Starting in 1979, Mark Elder succeeded Groves in the post, and described Groves \\"immensely encouraging and supportive\\".A long-standing concern of Arlen and then Harewood was the need to change the company's name to reflect the fact that it was no longer based at Sadler's Wells theatre.

After a brief dream sequence, Ivan Bondarev, a 12-year-old Russian boy, wakes up and crosses a war-torn landscape to a swamp, then swims across a river. On the other side, he is seized by Russian soldiers and brought to the young Lieutenant Galtsev, who interrogates him. The boy insists that he call \\"Number 51 at Headquarters\\" and report his presence. Galtsev is reluctant, but when he eventually makes the call, he is told by Lieutenant-Colonel Gryaznov to give the boy pencil and paper to make his report, which will be given the highest priority, and to treat him well. Through a series of dream sequences and conversations between different characters, it is revealed that Ivanâs mother and sister (and probably his father, a border guard) have been killed by German soldiers. He got away and joined a group of partisans. When the group was surrounded, they put him on a plane. After the escape, he was sent to a boarding school, but he ran away and joined an army unit under the command of Gryaznov. Burning for revenge, Ivan insists on fighting on the front line. Taking advantage of his small size, he is successful on reconnaissance missions. Gryaznov and the other soldiers grow fond of him and want to send him to a military school. They give up their idea when Ivan tries to run away and rejoin the partisans. He is determined to avenge the death of his family and others, such as those killed at the Maly Trostenets extermination camp (which he mentions that he has seen).

A:","output":"Given the list of answer choices and the context provided, the best answer would be \\"volume.\\" When using a measuring cup for sugar, you are measuring its volume. A measuring cup is a common kitchen utensil designed to measure the amount, or volume, of various ingredients required for a recipe. Using a measuring cup ensures that the correct amount of a particular ingredient, such as sugar, is added to the recipe. This is important for achieving the right taste, texture, and overall quality of the final product. Sugar, being an organic substance, is available in various forms, depending on the level of crystallization and processing. For instance, granulated sugar typically consists of small, regular-shaped crystalline particles, while powdered, or confectioners', sugar features even smaller and more finely ground crystals. Despite these differences, a measuring cup can still accurately measure the volume needed for each type of sugar. It is important to note that measuring volume differs from measuring other characteristics of a substance like decibels (a unit of sound intensity), density (mass per unit volume), length, and height. In the context of the question, these other answer choices are not applicable. Additionally, a kernel refers to an individual seed or grain, Joules is a unit of energy, and liquid references a fluid substance that doesn't have a fixed shape but rather takes the shape of its container. While these choices may be relevant in different contexts, they do not relate to measuring sugar with a measuring cup. In summary, when using a measuring cup for sugar, you are primarily measuring its volume, ensuring the precise amount needed for your recipe."},{"instruction":"Detailed Instructions: In this task, you will be presented with a text, a pronoun from the text, and two candidate names.

Article: There are a variety of reasons why you need tooth extraction surgery. Some of them include:  Teeth are blocking others from coming in. Baby teeth have not fallen out to give space for permanent teeth. Tooth has decayed past the point of salvaging. A decayed tooth presents a risk of infection to the rest of the mouth. A need to create space before an orthodontic treatment. If you are getting your adult teeth pulled, they will not grow back. Your oral surgeon should explain to you why tooth extraction is the best and only way to treat your problem. They will need to know all the vitamins, prescriptions, and over-the-counter medications you may be taking. These medications could impact the type of anesthetic they use when prepping you for surgery.  Let your doctor know about any allergies or general health issues you may have, in particular any problems relating to your heart or blood. Local anesthetics can sometimes cause reactions with certain medicines. Your oral surgeon should get local x-rays of the area where they will be operating. This provides them with the best plan to extract your tooth. If you’re having your wisdom teeth taken out, the oral surgeon will take a panoramic x-ray, which takes a picture of all of your teeth. This is especially important if the wisdom teeth are impacted and may require delicate work around the jaw. Depending on the severity of your tooth extraction, you may be pretty out of it when you come to consciousness. This will severely impair your ability to drive, so it’s important to have transportation arranged beforehand.  You may be able to get a friend or family member to drive you. If possible, find someone who can stay with you after the surgery. Getting a ride with a taxi or ride service is probably not the best option. You will likely need to fast the night before surgery. This reduces the risk of inhaling the contents of the stomach into the lungs while you’re out.  The standard amount of time to fast before surgery is eight to 12 hours, but your doctor should let you know how long is necessary. At the very least, you should not drink or eat anything after midnight. If you are diabetic or take any prescribed medicines, follow your normal routine. Verify this with your oral surgeon before doing so. You may be prescribed antibiotics if you have a weakened immune system or if you have an infection when it’s time for surgery. If you have any illness up to a week prior to the surgery, tell your oral surgeon. They may want to reschedule your appointment until you are better. What is a summary?","output":"Summary: Tooth extraction surgery may be necessary for various reasons, such as overcrowding, decay, or orthodontic treatment. Prior to surgery, the patient should inform the oral surgeon of any medications, allergies, and health issues. X-rays will be taken to plan the extraction, and the patient should arrange for transportation and possible post-surgery care. Fasting before the surgery is usually required, while diabetics or those on prescribed medicines should follow their normal routine and consult their surgeon. Antibiotics may be prescribed for those with weakened immune systems or infections. If a patient becomes ill close to the surgery date, they should inform their oral surgeon, who may reschedule the procedure."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

With a variety of cuts and styles to choose from, these pants provide the perfect balance between style and practicality. Whether you are dressing for a business meeting, casual outing, formal event, or hitting the gym, here are some ways you can incorporate maroon pants into your wardrobe repertoire. Step One: Understanding the Types of Maroon Pants First, let us explore the different cuts of maroon pants available to help you select the perfect pair for your desired look. 1. Trouser-cut maroon pants: These pants are designed with a wider leg opening and are typically made of a more structured material, such as a thick woven fabric. They are an ideal choice for a business look when paired with a blazer or button-down shirt. Adding a muted color palette for your top and accessories will keep the focus on these trousers and ensure that you look professional and polished. 2. Maroon skinny jeans: If you are looking for a more casual look, maroon skinny jeans are the way to go. They offer a snug fit and usually come in stretch denim for added comfort. Maroon skinny jeans can be easily paired with a simple t-shirt or sweater, ankle boots or sneakers, making them a go-to option for a casual day out or relaxed evening. 3. Straight-cut maroon pants: The straight-cut maroon pants provide a timeless, polished look. They are typically fitted around the waist and thighs but gradually loosen towards the ankles. Pair them with ballet flats or low heels and a blouse or knit top for a sophisticated outfit, perfect for a dinner party or formal gathering. 4. Maroon leggings: As athleisure wear continues to gain popularity, do not neglect the opportunity to incorporate maroon leggings into your wardrobe. These versatile pants provide both style and comfort, making them perfect for a rigorous workout or a casual stroll around town. Pair them with your favorite sports bra or workout top and sneakers for an energetic look that can easily transition to a casual coffee date. Step Two: Accessorizing Your Maroon Pants To further elevate your maroon pants, consider adding the right accessories. For a business look, a statement belt can add a touch of flair to your trouser-cut maroon pants, while a classic watch or minimalist jewelry will keep the ensemble professional. For casual or athleisure outfits, try a colorful scarf, bold earrings, or a chic crossbody bag to add some contrasting color. Conclusion Incorporating maroon pants in a variety of cuts and styles is an excellent way to add versatility to your wardrobe. By carefully selecting the right pair for your desired look, and adding appropriate accessories, you will have a flawless outfit for any occasion. So go ahead and experiment with trouser-cut, skinny, straight-cut, or leggings-style maroon pants and discover the endless possibilities they bring to your fashion game."},{"instruction":"You are a teacher.

Think like you are answering to a five year old. Article: In their natural habitat, bettas live in murky, stagnant water. Although they can survive in very small, cramped tanks, it’s healthier for the fish to give it a larger environment. Look for a tank that is holds around five gallons of water, as this will give the fish plenty of space. Do not keep your betta in a tank smaller than one gallon. Since betta fish breathe air directly from the top of the water, your tank does not need a filtration system. In fact, it’s better if the tank doesn’t have one—the current created by the filtration is stressful to bettas. . Wash the fish tank thoroughly and then rinse the gravel carefully in hot tap water. Do not use soap or detergent on the gravel. Then layer the gravel carefully at the bottom of the tank. Rinse any decorations and put them into the tank.  The tank does not necessarily have to be a traditional fish tank; any large container will do. It’s important that you include gravel in the fish tank. Opt for a neutral color, and for relatively small-grained gravel. The neutral color will calm your betta, and bacteria that build up on the gravel will digest your fish’s waste and keep the water relatively clean. Do not use mineral water in the tank, since it lacks important minerals that your betta fish will need. It’s important that, when filled with tap water, your fish tank will have plenty of surface area at the top. Betta fish do breathe underwater like most fish, but come up to the surface for an extra gulp of air at times.  For this reason, a narrow-topped container like a wine bottle does not make a suitable tank for a betta. A conditioner will remove chlorine (which is unhealthy for fish) from your tap water, and also filter out other impurities and heavy metals. Follow the instructions on the conditioner bottle, and remember to add this as you fill the tank with water. You’ll also need to add conditioner every time you change the water in the fish tank (roughly once a week).  If you bought your betta at a pet store, you should have received a water conditioner specifically made for bettas. If you were not given one, you’ll need to purchase a conditioner on your own. Conditioners should be available at any pet store, and can also be easily purchased online. The amount of conditioner that you use will vary based on the size of your fish tank. Follow the directions on the bottle regarding the amount of conditioner to use, and the amount of time to let it mix in the water before it’s safe for your fish.  If you live in a rural area where the tap water is not chlorinated, you may not need to use a conditioner. Some conditioners get rid of heavy metals though, so you can use it if you need. What is a summary of what this article is about?","output":"This article is about taking care of betta fish by setting up a good and healthy environment for them.

Please answer the following question: So a couple of weeks ago I was lucky enough to be invited to The Body Shop® blogger event at my local store in Coppergate, York. It had been organised by blogger Indigo Rosee, in collaboration with the store. The evening had been set up to showcase the new limited edition Christmas make-up collection and also promote the huge sale that the store had on. There were some amazing deals! We were welcomed with prosecco and nibbles and then had a few minutes to browse the store and take some photos. I received a great demonstration of the new make-up products which includes a funky black eyeliner pen with a star stamp on one end which EVERYONE tried out! I always really love The Body Shop® Christmas make-up collections, and I think it’s a shame that it’s a brand that is sometimes forgotten when it comes to make-up. Then everyone was treated to a hand spa and massage using some of the Spa Of The World products. They’re truly luxurious, I recently reviewed the new Firming Ritual collection recently and absolutely loved it. I then had a look round some of the offers that the store was promoting, a lot of the Shower Gels and Body Butters were on sale (I just LOVE The Body Shop® Body Butters) and there were lots of gift sets too. It was a great opportunity to chat with the staff too, to ask questions about new products and find out what their favourites are. I also spent a lot of time looking at the 2017 beauty advent calendars. This year The Body Shop® are offering 3 different advent calendars starting from just £45.

Such a band was Strange Fruit.\\" Thus begins the opening dialog of Hughie, (Billy Connolly) as he launches into a brief history of the British band: in the late 1970's Strange Fruit, consisting of guitarist Brian Lovell (Bruce Robinson), his brother and lead singer Keith, keyboard player Tony Costello (Stephen Rea), bassist Les Wickes (Jimmy Nail) and drummer Beano Baggot (Timothy Spall) were HUGE. When Keith died of a drug overdose, he was replaced on vocals by Ray Simms (Bill Nighy). Watched over by road-dog Hughie and Girl Friday Karen (Juliet Aubrey), they soldiered on until the disastrous appearance at the open-air Wisbech (U.K.) Rock Festival, when lightning struck the stage during their opening number. The already-contentious band members decided it was a sign and immediately broke up forever (all this in the first five minutes of the film). Forever, that is, until in the present (OK, 1998) Tony is spotted on Ibeza (he now stocks condoms in the restrooms at the resorts there) by the son of the Wisbech promoter, who wants to put together a 20th anniversary reunion concert with all the original acts. Tony seeks out Karen, now a divorced mother who coordinates conferences for a major hotel, suggesting a possible reunion. She is ambivalent, as is Les (now a successful roofer with a family) and Ray (a struggling solo artist with a demanding second wife -- Swedish -- and a mansion he can't afford). Beano, working in a floral nursery and hounded by the Inland Revenue (the U.K.'s IRS) is the only immediately enthusiastic bandmate. They arrange a meeting, where Karen informs them that she's tracked Brian and found his music royalties are being distributed per a bequest in his will, provoking Beano to compassionately ask if that means \\"the silly sod's dead?\\" The band again soldiers on. Hughie shows up to complete... Answer:","output":"In the movie \\"Still Crazy,\\" the ghost that delivered a positive message is likely Keith, the original lead singer of the band Strange Fruit. Keith had died of a drug overdose before being replaced by Ray Simms. Though the movie does not explicitly mention a ghost delivering a message, it can be inferred that Keith's spirit might have impacted and united the band members on their journey."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Julien disengages the handbrake of the bus without hesitation, and the bus full of children rolls down a hill. Their game has begun: the box changes its owner after each completed dare. Between the son of wealthy Belgian parents and the daughter of poor Polish immigrants a lasting friendship develops.

Q: Answer the following question given this paragraph:   Plant Organ Systems In plants, just as in animals, similar cells working together form a tissue. When different types of tissues work together to perform a unique function, they form an organ; organs working together form organ systems. Vascular plants have two distinct organ systems: a shoot system, and a root system. The shoot system consists of two portions: the vegetative (nonreproductive) parts of the plant, such as the leaves and the stems, and the reproductive parts of the plant, which include flowers and fruits. The shoot system generally grows above ground, where it absorbs the light needed for photosynthesis. The root system, which supports the plants and absorbs water and minerals, is usually underground. Figure 30.2 shows the organ systems of a typical plant.   Q: When different types of tissues work together to perform a unique function, what do they form?

Sissi cares for her patients to the effect that they appear to be her extended family (in fact, she states that her own father is a patient in the hospital). As such, she has little experience of life outside the hospital. Meanwhile, Bodo, living with his brother, applies for a funerary job but is quickly dismissed because of his inability to control his emotions. He later robs a grocery store and during the ensuing chase indirectly causes a truck to hit Sissi. Taking cover from the police underneath the truck, Bodo finds Sissi, who cannot speak or breathe. In order to save her life, he performs an emergency tracheotomy. Once Sissi is in medical care, they are separated without Sissi ever learning his name. The circumstances of her accident prevent Sissi from re-adjusting to her mundane life at the hospital, as she obsesses about tracking down her saviour. One of her patient friends, who had accompanied her on the day of her accident, helps her do so. She manages to track down Bodo, who is not interested in maintaining contact with her or any other woman. We see several times how Bodo, in a semi-conscious state, embraces a hot stove, having to be restrained by his brother Walter. It later becomes clear that Bodo is hallucinating (or perhaps dreaming) about his deceased wife, having never fully recovered from her death. Walter tells Sissi that Bodo's wife was killed in an explosion at a filling station, while Bodo was in the washroom. After Walter finishes his explanation, Bodo arrives and throws Sissi out. Walter, employed as a security guard at a local bank, involves Bodo in a planned robbery (in preparation for their impending move to Australia together).

Premise: \\"LSC initially stressed the importance of state plan\\" If this premise is true, what does that tell us about whether it entails the hypothesis \\"LSC first came out explaining the state plan is very important. \\"?","output":"If the premise \\"LSC initially stressed the importance of state plan\\" is true, it provides valuable information regarding the hypothesis \\"LSC first came out explaining the state plan is very important.\\" We can proceed to analyze the relationship between the premise and the hypothesis in greater depth. The premise asserts that, from the beginning, LSC placed emphasis on the significance of the state plan. This could involve outlining the key components of the state plan, stressing its relevance to achieving specific goals, and advocating for its implementation or adoption. In other words, LSC made it clear since the initial stages that the state plan was an important element of its overall strategy or approach. The hypothesis, on the other hand, states that \\"LSC first came out explaining the state plan is very important.\\" This implies that, when LSC was just being introduced or presented to the public, it was already advocating for the importance of the state plan. The hypothesis suggests that the primary message delivered by LSC at its inception was centered around the significance of the state plan. By comparing the premise and the hypothesis, we can observe that both statements focus on the notion that LSC prioritized the importance of the state plan from the outset. The key difference between the two is that the premise merely asserts this fact, while the hypothesis adds the context of LSC's public introduction. Consequently, if the premise is indeed true, it provides substantial support for the overall validity of the hypothesis. In conclusion, if we accept the premise \\"LSC initially stressed the importance of state plan\\" as true, it strongly suggests that the hypothesis \\"LSC first came out explaining the state plan is very important\\" is also likely to be true. Both statements convey a similar message, emphasizing that LSC identified the state plan as a critical component of its approach right from the beginning. Although the hypothesis provides additional context, it is not contradictory to the premise, and, in fact, the premise lends credence to the hypothesis."},{"instruction":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

This way, you'll have a place to put all the clutter you find. 4. Clean One Room at a Time When we start cleaning, it's important to focus on one room first. This will make the task less overwhelming. Pick a room to clean (like the living room or your bedroom) and finish it before you move on to the next one. 5. Sort Your Stuff As you clean, you'll find all sorts of things: toys, clothes, books, and more. To make things easier, put them in different piles. For example, make one pile for toys that you want to keep and another for toys that you want to give away. This will make it easier for Mommy and Daddy to know what to do with your things. 6. Make It a Fun Cleaning Day Cleaning can be tiring, but it doesn't have to be boring! Try to get as much done in one day as possible by making it a fun experience. Play some music, sing songs, or make up cleaning games. The more fun you have, the quicker the time will fly by, and before you know it, your house will be super clean!

The man spent the weekend in the house with the body before letting the deputy in after police received calls from her acquaintances saying they hadn't heard from her for several days, the prosecutor said. Friends of the woman had gone to the home, but Charles Wilkinson wouldn't let them in, Murphy said. Further details on the time and cause of death won't be determined until after an autopsy is conducted Monday afternoon, he said. However, a felony complaint filed with the town court and seen by the Daily Gazette indicates Wilkinson choked his wife to death at about 10 p.m. Friday. Sheriff's deputies were called to the house for a welfare check by the couple's adult son who lives ion the Boston area. 'The responding deputy was greeted at the door by Charles Wilkinson. After a period of discussion at the door Charles Wilkinson allowed the deputy to enter the residence at which time the deputy located the body of Kathleen Wilkinson deceased on the floor of a first-floor bedroom,' the sheriff's statement continued. They could see no obvious cause of death. Scene: Wilkinson spent the weekend in the house, pictured, with the body before letting the deputy in after police received calls from her acquaintances saying they hadn't heard from her for several days, prosecutors said. Wilkinson was charged with second-degree murder and was being held in the county jail without bail. Murphy said he didn't know whether Wilkinson had a lawyer. Authorities have yet to determine a motive for the slaying, despite lengthy interviews with Wilkinson. Wilkinson retired after 13 years with the Nassau County Police Department in 1984. He then worked as a painter and most recently as a part-time security guard at the nearby GlobalFoundries computer chip plant. The couple had lived in Malta for about 10 years and have two adult children who live in the Boston area, Murphy said. Kathleen Wilkinson worked as a teachers' aide on Long Island, but hadn't worked since the couple moved to Malta. The slaying occurred in a tidy suburban development a few miles south of Saratoga Springs. Neighbors spoke highly of the couple and said they weren't aware of any domestic issues, Murphy said. There was also no history of prior domestic violence calls to police from the home. 'We're very lucky to have very few murders,' he said. 'Certainly it's very disturbing to have it happen in a very quiet neighborhood.' Wilkinson is being held Saratoga County Jail in lieu of bail. Second degree murder carries a potential sentence of 25 years to life in prison. Sorry we are not currently accepting comments on this article.

Presley's only child, Lisa Marie, was born on February 1, 1968, during a period when he had grown deeply unhappy with his career. Of the eight Presley singles released between January 1967 and May 1968, only two charted in the top 40, and none higher than number 28. His forthcoming soundtrack album, Speedway, would rank at number 82 on the Billboard chart. Parker had already shifted his plans to television, where Presley had not appeared since the Sinatra Timex show in 1960. He maneuvered a deal with NBC that committed the network to both finance a theatrical feature and broadcast a Christmas special.Recorded in late June in Burbank, California, the special, simply called Elvis, aired on December 3, 1968. Later known as the '68 Comeback Special, the show featured lavishly staged studio productions as well as songs performed with a band in front of a small audience—Presley's first live performances since 1961. The live segments saw Presley dressed in tight black leather, singing and playing guitar in an uninhibited style reminiscent of his early rock and roll days. Director and co-producer Steve Binder had worked hard to produce a show that was far from the hour of Christmas songs Parker had originally planned. The show, NBC's highest rated that season, captured 42 percent of the total viewing audience. Jon Landau of Eye magazine remarked, \\"There is something magical about watching a man who has lost himself find his way back home. He sang with the kind of power people no longer expect of rock 'n' roll singers. He moved his body with a lack of pretension and effort that must have made Jim Morrison green with envy.\\" Dave Marsh calls the performance one of \\"emotional grandeur and historical resonance\\".By January 1969, the single \\"If I Can Dream\\", written for the special, reached number 12. The soundtrack album rose into the top ten. According to friend Jerry Schilling, the special reminded Presley of what \\"he had not been able to do for years, being able to choose the people; being able to choose what songs and...

The kind of behavior that occurs only after experience or practice and describes most human behaviors is learned behavior. As mentioned in the paragraph, unlike innate or inherited behaviors which are present from birth, learned behaviors are developed through experience or practice. They are not biologically pre-programmed, but rather acquired over time as an individual interacts with their environment. The example given of teaching a dog to sit on command is a classic illustration of a learned behavior, as the dog is not innately aware of the need to sit when hearing the command and must learn the desired response through practice and reinforcement. Similarly, humans acquire most of their behaviors and skills through various forms of learning, such as observation, imitation, and trial-and-error, making learned behavior a key characteristic of human behavior."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Context: As I mentioned in my previous post on Sacré-Coeur, one of the other places I didn’t get a chance to see when I was in Paris last summer was the catacombs so I wanted to be sure to fit in a visit this time around. Long Queue vs Online Tickets You can either wait in line to get in or buy tickets online for specific time slots to bypass the line. Wait times can be anywhere from 30 minutes to 3+ hours and in the summer time, it’s common to wait for hours. I definitely recommend buying a ticket online. Keep in mind that they have a limited number of tickets for each time slot, so don’t wait too long to buy or you may be stuck in that loooooong line. We got quite a few less-then-friendly looks from those in the line when we bypassed the entire queue and went right in. C’est la vie (insert Gallic shrug here). For some inexplicable reason, the site says you must print your tickets if you buy them online. Given that most visitors to the catacombs are tourists with limited or no access to a printer, this seems particularly silly, but what can you do? Luckily, we were in a hotel with a small business center so we printed our tickets there. Online tickets cost quite a bit more (27€ compared to 12€ for adults and 10€ for those age 26 or under). Totally worth it if that works with your budget. Online tickets also come with an audio guide. If you buy tickets at the door, the guide is an extra 5€.

Answer the following question: Given the following context:  Up to c. 1210, continental Arthurian romance was expressed primarily through poetry; after this date the tales began to be told in prose. The most significant of these 13th-century prose romances was the Vulgate Cycle (also known as the Lancelot-Grail Cycle), a series of five Middle French prose works written in the first half of that century. These works were the Estoire del Saint Grail, the Estoire de Merlin, the Lancelot propre (or Prose Lancelot, which made up half the entire Vulgate Cycle on its own), the Queste del Saint Graal and the Mort Artu, which combine to form the first coherent version of the entire Arthurian legend. The cycle continued the trend towards reducing the role played by Arthur in his own legend, partly through the introduction of the character of Galahad and an expansion of the role of Merlin. It also made Mordred the result of an incestuous relationship between Arthur and his sister Morgause and established the role of Camelot, first mentioned in passing in Chrétien's Lancelot, as Arthur's primary court. This series of texts was quickly followed by the Post-Vulgate Cycle (c. 1230–40), of which the Suite du Merlin is a part, which greatly reduced the importance of Lancelot's affair with Guinevere but continued to sideline Arthur, and to focus more on the Grail quest. As such, Arthur became even more of a relatively minor character in these French prose romances; in the Vulgate itself he only figures significantly in the Estoire de Merlin and the Mort Artu. During this period, Arthur was made one of the Nine Worthies, a group of three pagan, three Jewish and three Christian exemplars of chivalry. The Worthies were first listed in Jacques de Longuyon's Voeux du Paon in 1312, and subsequently became a common subject in literature and art.  answer the following question:  What are the two names for the Middle French prose work that made up half of the entire Lancelot-Grail Cycle?

King and the SCLC were criticized by some for ending the campaign with promises that were too vague and \\"settling for a lot less than even moderate demands\\". In fact, Sydney Smyer, president of the Birmingham Chamber of Commerce, re-interpreted the terms of the agreement. Shuttlesworth and King had announced that desegregation would take place 90 days from May 15.  Smyer then said that a single black clerk hired 90 days from when the new city government took office would be sufficient. By July, most of the city's segregation ordinances had been overturned.  Some of the lunch counters in department stores complied with the new rules. City parks and golf courses were opened again to black and white citizens.  Mayor Boutwell appointed a biracial committee to discuss further changes.  However, no hiring of black clerks, police officers, and firefighters had yet been completed and the Birmingham Bar Association rejected membership by black attorneys.The reputation of Martin Luther King Jr. soared after the protests in Birmingham, and he was lauded by many as a hero. The SCLC was much in demand to effect change in many Southern cities. In the summer of 1963, King led the March on Washington for Jobs and Freedom where he delivered his most famous speech, \\"I Have a Dream\\".

Today, we will talk about an important topic. The NHS, or National Health Service, is a big, important thing in England. It's like a group of super heroes who help people when they are sick or hurt. But sometimes, the government – that's the group of people who make big decisions for the country – treats the NHS like it's a sad, failing business or a bank. And that's not good. An important journal, filled with really smart people who write about important things, said that the government should stop doing that. Now, let's talk about why treating the NHS differently is important. 1. No Money? No Problem! When we talk about a business or a bank, making money is a big thing, right? But the NHS is about helping people. So, if the government treats the NHS like a business, they might forget that it's not always about money. 2. Saving the Superheroes! This group of health superheroes is amazing, isn't it? They work very hard to keep everyone healthy and happy. But if the government treats the NHS like a sad business, our heroes might not get enough support to keep on being super. 3. Keeping People Happy and Healthy The most important thing about the NHS is making sure everyone can see a doctor or nurse when they need to. The government should remember that and treat the NHS in a way that helps everyone have access to good healthcare. In conclusion, the government should treat the NHS like the special, helpful thing it is – not like a failing business or bank.

This was the first sushi restaurant I have visited in years, and the very first one I've visited in Arizona.  The friend I went with said it was the best sushi restaurant in the east valley (some poll or other said so), thus we decided to take a stab at it.  And, to be honest, I mainly wanted to taste miso soup again (one of my favorite soups on the planet).  We walked in and it looked like any typical asian restaurant.  To one side was a long bar, where you can sit and eat, or sit and drink saki or beer.  To the other side was a long row of booths.  We decided to booth it up.  We sat down and shrugged... seemed fine so far.  The decor looked a little cheap, but the more hole-in-the-wall a place is, the more likely I will like it.  So, we both order a Japanese beer, take out the sushi list, and just go to town.  We order just about one of everything, including bowls of miso soup.  I was surprised that the sushi came out one at a time.  We'd dig into one, and once we were almost done and forming our opinions about it, another one would come out.  That was kinda fun.  Every kind we decided to get was exquisite, and reminded me of my favorite sushi joint in Minneapolis, Kikugawa (and believe you me - I've tried EVERY sushi restaurant in the Minneapolis/Saint Paul metro area).  Not only was the sushi tasty but it was *beautiful*.  They must have really talented sushi chefs working for them, because it was wonderful.  This was also the first time I got \\"deep fried\\" sushi.  If you haven't tried it... DO IT!  We got a deep fried roll that had crab, avocado, cream cheese, cucumber, and rice... wow.  Mind blown (can you tell I really love certain things??).  If I can find other friends who would like to go out to a sushi restaurant in the east valley, this restaurant will definitely be revisited by me!  (Plus, surprise, they gave us free dessert!  Yay watermelon!) Is this review positive or negative? Options are: * negative. * positive. Answer:","output":"* positive. This review is positive because the person enjoyed their experience at the sushi restaurant. They liked the sushi, found it beautiful and tasty, and even got a free dessert. The other option, negative, is incorrect because the review doesn't focus on any negative aspects of the restaurant."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant. You will be given a task.

If you are destined to dine at Westgate I recommend the sushi joint or Yard House. How would this review be described in terms of sentiment? Select from:  --negative.  --positive.","output":"The review provided can be described as predominantly negative in terms of sentiment for several reasons.  Firstly, the review mentions that the \\"cute waitresses\\" are the only positive or attractive aspect of the bar, which implies that there may not be much else to offer in terms of the overall experience. While this comment might be perceived as slightly positive, the term \\"cute\\" may not directly imply the quality of service provided or the overall customer satisfaction, but rather focus solely on the appearance of the waitresses. Secondly, the reviewer states that \\"the food is sub par bar fare.\\" The adjective \\"sub par\\" denotes that the food is below average, suggesting a lack of satisfaction or disappointment in the quality of the dishes offered. This negative remark is followed by a similar observation regarding the drinks - they are described as \\"always weak,\\" implying dissatisfaction with the potency or flavor of the beverages. Lastly, the reviewer concludes by recommending alternative dining options within the same location (Westgate). By suggesting that customers consider eating at the sushi joint or Yard House instead, the reviewer implies these establishments may offer a better overall experience than the discussed bar. Recommending alternative venues reinforces the negative sentiment of the review because it further indicates that the bar does not meet the expectations or needs of its customers. In conclusion, the review can be characterized as negative due to its critical assessment of the food, drinks, and overall experience at the bar, coupled with the recommendation to visit other establishments instead. Although there is a mention of a potentially positive aspect (the appearance of the waitresses), it does not outweigh the numerous negative points made throughout the review."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

He had picked out the perfect spot, right above the fireplace, and had even invited a few friends over to help with the installation. But as they unpacked the TV from its box, Tim realized that the TV was much smaller than he had anticipated. Disappointed, Tim scratched his head, wondering what to do. The TV would look ridiculous mounted on the wall due to its size, and the mounting kit he had purchased wouldn't even hold the smaller TV securely. After a moment, his friend Alice suggested that they search for a solution online. The group agreed, and they began to research alternative mounting options for small TVs. They discovered that there were adjustable TV wall mounts, designed to hold TVs of various sizes. These mounts could easily support Tim's smaller flat screen, and would allow it to be mounted securely without looking out of place. Feeling hopeful, Tim and his friends decided to visit a nearby electronics store to see if they could find one of these adjustable mounts. At the store, they found a wide selection of TV mounting options. Tim was initially overwhelmed by the choices, but Alice reminded him to look for an adjustable mount that could hold TVs of different sizes. They found a few models that seemed suitable, and after reading the descriptions and comparing the prices, they settled on one that suited Tim's needs and budget. With the adjustable mount in hand, they returned to Tim's house. They carefully followed the instruction manual, customizing the mount to fit Tim's smaller TV. After some trial and error, they finally managed to securely fasten the TV on the wall, above the fireplace. To their delight, it looked perfect, despite its size. Feeling proud of their accomplishment, Tim and his friends decided to test out the new setup by having a movie night. They browsed through Netflix, searching for a film that they could all enjoy. After some debate, they agreed on an action-packed thriller with impressive visual effects, which would work perfectly for testing the newly-mounted TV. As the movie played, Tim couldn't help but feel a sense of satisfaction. Although the TV was smaller than he had initially wanted, the new wall mount had made it look just right in its spot above the fireplace. The adjustable mount had saved the day, and Tim realized that sometimes, solutions can be found even when things don't initially turn out as planned. The movie night was a success, and Tim's friends congratulated him on creating a cozy and stylish viewing area. They all agreed to make it a regular event, and Tim found himself looking forward to many more nights spent enjoying his newly-mounted TV with his friends. The smaller screen size no longer mattered — they had made it work, and it had become the perfect focal point for his living room."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

(CNN) -- A German citizen of Afghan descent was the source of much of the information on a potential \\"Mumbai-style\\" terror plot in Europe, a German counterterrorism official said Wednesday.

The German government is increasingly concerned about the number of","output":"its citizens who are becoming radicalized and joining extremist groups abroad, posing a significant threat to national security. The number of individuals traveling to conflict zones like Afghanistan and Pakistan has risen in recent years, prompting authorities to intensify their efforts in monitoring and combating such activities. According to German intelligence agencies, many of these individuals are being recruited through social media and online forums, as well as in radical mosques and religious centers across the country. It is believed that they are often lured by the promise of a sense of belonging, purpose, and the opportunity to fight for a cause they believe in. As a response to this growing concern, the German government has implemented several prevention and deradicalization programs to target those who may be at risk of radicalization. One such program, dubbed \\"EXIT Germany,\\" focuses on providing support, assistance, and counseling to individuals who wish to leave extremist groups and reintegrate into society. Other initiatives include increased surveillance of online activities, working closely with religious leaders and communities, and strengthening international partnerships to share intelligence and resources in the fight against terrorism. Despite these efforts, the challenge of addressing radicalization remains an ongoing struggle, not just for Germany but for many countries across the globe. As violent extremism continues to evolve and adapt, so too must the strategies and tactics employed by governments and security agencies to identify, intercept, and neutralize potential threats. In the case of Ahmed Sidiqi, his arrest and subsequent cooperation with authorities have provided valuable intelligence on the planned \\"Mumbai-style\\" terror plot in Europe, potentially saving countless lives and thwarting the plans of extremist groups.

Does it follow that \\"They were never able to regain positions of responsibility.\\"?","output":"No, it does not necessarily follow that \\"They were never able to regain positions of responsibility.\\" The statement \\"It took a long time for them to be readmitted to positions of responsibility\\" implies that they eventually managed to regain those positions, but it took a significant amount of time and effort. There are many factors that may have contributed to the prolonged time it took for them to regain positions of responsibility. Some factors may include changes in the social, political, or economic landscape, a need to prove their worth and capability to hold those positions, or barriers such as a bias or discrimination. In some cases, individuals face challenges in recovering from past mistakes, rebuilding their reputation, or acquiring new skills that are relevant to the positions they seek. It is not uncommon for people to face setbacks in their professional lives, and the time it takes for them to bounce back depends on various factors. However, the fact that it took a long time for them to be readmitted to positions of responsibility indicates that, ultimately, they were able to demonstrate their competence and regain the trust and confidence of those who had the authority to grant them those positions. This shows the importance of perseverance and adaptability in overcoming obstacles and achieving goals, especially when faced with significant challenges. The journey to regaining positions of responsibility may have involved learning from past mistakes, investing in self-improvement, and building a new network of professional connections. In conclusion, the statement \\"It took a long time for them to be readmitted to positions of responsibility\\" does not imply that they were never able to regain those positions. It only informs us about the considerable amount of time it took for them to achieve this goal. Their eventual success in regaining positions of responsibility serves as an example of the power of persistence, adaptability, and personal growth in overcoming adversity and achieving success."},{"instruction":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

You see, Neil and Kenneth were friends who were learning how to become special heroes. Neil was going to be a very powerful one, with all kinds of amazing abilities, like flying and lifting super heavy things. Because he was going to be so strong, Neil needed lots and lots of practice to learn how to use his powers properly. On the other hand, Kenneth had a different type of power. His job was to make people laugh, and you know, laughter is like a fun magic power that can heal and make people happy. Although it was still a very important job, Kenneth didn't need as much training because making people laugh was not as complicated as flying or lifting heavy things. So, Neil's training involved running, jumping, and practicing how to use his strength safely. He had to learn to control his powerful abilities so that he wouldn't accidentally hurt someone or break things. His trainer, Mr. Superstrong, was always by his side, helping him become the best hero he could be. Kenneth, on the other hand, spent most of his training with Ms. Gigglepants, learning different jokes, funny faces, and silly ways to entertain people. Even though it wasn't as hard or intense as Neil's training, Kenneth knew that making people laugh was his way of helping others and being a special kind of hero. Even though their trainings were different, Neil and Kenneth were still the best of friends, always cheering each other on and being there for each other. Sometimes, after a long day of training, they would sit together and share stories about all the adventures they hoped to have as heroes. Ultimately, both Neil and Kenneth became amazing heroes who saved the world in their own unique ways. When they worked together, Neil's strength and Kenneth's laughter proved to be a powerful team that brought happiness and safety to everyone around them.

The premise states that many people are sitting at a long dinner table at a formal event. This directly fulfills the hypothesis, which predicts that people are sitting at a table at the gathering.  The relationship between the premise and the hypothesis can be explained further by breaking down each component. Premise: Many people sit at a long dinner table at a formal event. Key elements: 1. Many people are involved 2. A long dinner table is present 3. The event is formal in nature Hypothesis: People are sitting at a table at the gathering. Key elements: 1. People are involved 2. A table is present 3. The gathering is taking place When comparing the key elements of the premise to those of the hypothesis, we find that they align well.  1. The premise specifies \\"many people,\\" which is consistent with the broader term \\"people\\" in the hypothesis.  2. Both the premise and the hypothesis contain the presence of a table, with the premise elaborating on the table being a \\"long dinner table.\\" This added detail strengthens the connection between the two statements. 3.

The film then cuts forward in time to a small European village where a series of mysterious murders are taking place. The villagers readily assemble in mob form, with torches, at the house of Professor Kristan after every murder. The villagers suspect that a giant bat is to blame for the murders. Kristan gives the villagers advice on staying safe, and assures them a scientific explanation exists. However, in subsequent scenes, Kristan himself is revealed to be the murderer. He is seized by attacks (triggered by darkness) which transform him into a trance-like state of murderousness. After he commits a murder, he awakens from the trance with no memory of the deed, believing himself merely to have fainted.  Kristan's obliviousness is further enabled by the intervention of his loyal hunchback Zan, the only person aware of Kristan's condition. Zan follows Kristan when he is in his trances, ensuring the professor is not discovered. An old friend of Kristan's, Dr. Bizet, arrives to visit, and soon suspects what is happening.

Think like you are answering to a five year old. Background: Ronald Wilson Reagan was born on February 6, 1911 in an apartment on the second floor of a commercial building in Tampico, Illinois. He was the younger son of Nelle Clyde (nee Wilson; 1883-1962) and Jack Reagan (1883-1941). Jack was a salesman and storyteller whose grandparents were Irish Catholic emigrants from County Tipperary, while Nelle was of half English and half Scottish descent (her mother was born in Surrey). Reagan's older brother, Neil Reagan (1908-1996), became an advertising executive. Context: After completing 14 home-study Army Extension Courses, Reagan enlisted in the Army Enlisted Reserve and was commissioned a second lieutenant in the Officers' Reserve Corps of the Cavalry on May 25, 1937.  On April 18, 1942, Reagan was ordered to active duty for the first time. Due to his poor eyesight, he was classified for limited service only, which excluded him from serving overseas. His first assignment was at the San Francisco Port of Embarkation at Fort Mason, California, as a liaison officer of the Port and Transportation Office. Upon the approval of the Army Air Forces (AAF), he applied for a transfer from the cavalry to the AAF on May 15, 1942, and was assigned to AAF Public Relations and subsequently to the First Motion Picture Unit (officially, the \\"18th Army Air Force Base Unit\\") in Culver City, California. On January 14, 1943, he was promoted to first lieutenant and was sent to the Provisional Task Force Show Unit of This Is the Army at Burbank, California. He returned to the First Motion Picture Unit after completing this duty and was promoted to captain on July 22, 1943.  In January 1944, Reagan was ordered to temporary duty in New York City to participate in the opening of the Sixth War Loan Drive, which campaigned for the purchase of war bonds. He was reassigned to the First Motion Picture Unit on November 14, 1944, where he remained until the end of World War II. He was recommended for promotion to major on February 2, 1945, but this recommendation was disapproved on July 17 of that year. While with the First Motion Picture Unit in 1945, he was indirectly involved in discovering actress Marilyn Monroe. He returned to Fort MacArthur, California, where he was separated from active duty on December 9, 1945. By the end of the war, his units had produced some 400 training films for the AAF.

Multi-choice problem: Choose from the options at the end, and answer how do you do this: To prepare the avocado pit for planting, Pick your answer from:  -- boil the pit in water in a pan for 15 minutes..  -- wash the pit under warm running water..","output":"To prepare the avocado pit for planting, you should wash the pit under warm running water. Here is a detailed, step-by-step process on how to prepare the avocado pit for planting: 1. Remove the pit: Start by eating or scooping the avocado fruit out, leaving the pit. Be gentle as you don't want to damage the pit during this process. 2. Clean the pit: Once you have the pit, you should wash it under warm running water to remove any remaining fruit residue. Use your fingers or a soft cloth to rub off any avocado flesh and rinse it until the pit is clean. 3. Identify the top and bottom of the pit: Observe the pit to determine which end is the top and which is the bottom, as the roots will grow from the bottom, while the stem will grow from the top. The bottom of the pit is usually the broader, rounder part, while the top is more tapered and pointy. 4. Soak the pit (optional): You can opt to soak the pit in a bowl of water for a few hours or overnight to provide some initial hydration before planting. 5. Pierce the pit: Take three or four toothpicks and insert them around the circumference of the pit, about halfway down. These toothpicks will serve as supports to suspend the pit over a container of water. 6. Prepare the container: Fill a jar, glass, or small vase with enough water that the bottom of the avocado pit can be submerged when the toothpicks are resting on the container's rim. 7. Suspend the pit in the container: With the toothpicks resting on the container's rim, the bottom of the avocado pit should be submerged in the water. Make sure to monitor the water level and replenish it if the level drops below the pit's base. 8. Provide sunlight: Place the container in a warm location with indirect sunlight, such as a bright windowsill. Avocado pits typically require moderate sunlight to facilitate growth. 9. Wait for root and stem growth: It may take several weeks or even months for the pit to start growing roots and a stem. Regularly change the water, preferably every week, to prevent the risk of mildew or mold growth and maintain a clean environment. 10. Transplant the avocado sprout: Once the roots are well established, and the stem is around 6-7 inches tall, you can transfer the avocado pit to a pot with soil. Bury the pit half-way into the soil, leaving the upper portion exposed. 11. Ensure proper care: Continue to provide the avocado plant with plenty of sunlight, well-draining soil, and water when the soil feels dry to the touch. In conclusion, to prepare an avocado pit for planting, you should wash the pit under warm running water, rather than boiling the pit in water in a pan for 15 minutes. Boiling the pit can damage the delicate tissues inside that are necessary for germination and growth."},{"instruction":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

(AP) — When the call went out for a doctor on board, the U.S. surgeon general says he gladly stepped in to help with a medical emergency on a commercial flight.      Dr. Jerome Adams, an anesthesiologist, said he assisted someone on a Delta Air Lines jet as he prepared to fly Wednesday to Jackson, Mississippi.      Adams tweeted that a call went out requesting a doctor.      A person lost consciousness when the plane was on the ground in Fort Lauderdale, Florida, and Adams and two nurses responded, said Kate Migliaccio-Grabill, a Department of Health and Human Services spokeswoman.      The patient woke up, and Adams determined it was best for the plane to return to the gate and for the patient to go to a hospital for further evaluation. Adams also called the patient's spouse to explain what happened, the spokeswoman said.      Adams tweeted that the patient was doing well and, like a good public health service doctor, he was happy to assist.      Adams was on a flight from Fort Lauderdale to Atlanta to catch a connecting flight to Mississippi's capital city, where he has public events Thursday, including a panel discussion on opioid abuse.      Mississippi Gov. Phil Bryant tweeted back at the surgeon general: \\"Nice job, Dr. Adams!\\" |||||","output":"U.S. Surgeon General Dr. Jerome Adams assisted in a medical emergency on a Delta Air Lines flight, responding to a call for a doctor on board.

Article: You want to have fun and adventure and so you decide to travel somewhere to do it. Sounds like a simple enough thing. And basically it is. But what is adventure? That is the key here and the answer can be different for different people. For those who love sports, adventure travel can have a whole different meaning than for those who like history. The physical travel types that you can find include such adventure travel as white water rafting  , kayaking or climbing and hiking to some mountains somewhere. To the hiker, backpacking across Ireland might be their adventure. For this type of person, adventure travel almost always includes something physical. Often the goal is to push their body's limits and test their individual endurance  . For those who less want to climb mountains, adventure travel might mean traveling to Nepal and taking in the local festivals. Wine tasting in Italy is also vacation adventure for the more relaxed traveler who enjoys peace and comfort. Anything that is opposite to the normal scope   of the traveler's lifestyle defines   adventure. Adventure travel is not necessarily a one-size-fits-all type of vacation. Adventure depends on the person's physical limits, how much money the person has and what the person enjoys doing. Going _ the normal is adventurous for many. If your life is quite busy, then sitting on a beach in the moonlight with your family might be adventure for you. The point is not what you do but that you have a good time and that it is an adventure for YOU -- not for the person next to you. Do not sit home this year when vacation time rolls around. Go beyond your normal routine and try something new. If you usually spend your vacation sun-bathing on a beach, try hiking, instead, through the mountains.

You can directly copy and paste a span from the story or the question while answering the given question. Q: Background Paragraph: Mantle melting can come about three ways: (1) when the temperature rises, (2) if the pressure lowers (which lowers the melting point), and (3) if water is added, which lowers the melting point. Two of these (1 and 3) might explain why there are volcanoes at convergent plate boundaries: the temperature of the subducting plate increases as it sinks into the hot mantle (1). Sediments lying on top of the subducting plate contain water. As the sediments subduct, the water rises into the overlying mantle material. This lowers the melting temperature of the mantle (3). When the mantle above the subducting plate melts, volcanoes form above it. This leads to volcanoes in an island arc or continental arc.  Story: Ben and Mike both studied earthquakes, while Mike was more interested specifically in mantle melting and related phenomena.  Question: Which person studied less about volcanoes at convergent plate boundaries? A:","output":"Part #1: Causal or qualitative relationships in the background paragraph. Usage: \\"Mantle melting can come about three ways: (1) when the temperature rises, (2) if the pressure lowers (which lowers the melting point), and (3) if water is added, which lowers the melting point.\\" This part explains the three ways that mantle melting can occur, which includes temperature, pressure, and water. It sets the foundation for understanding the topic of mantle melting and its connection to volcanoes. Part #2: The story's use of concepts or relationships mentioned in the background paragraph. Usage: \\"Ben and Mike both studied earthquakes, while Mike was more interested specifically in mantle melting and related phenomena.\\" This part tells us who the characters are and what they study.

Answer the following question: If I tell you that Bicep contraction occurs when fibers get shorter, and ask you the question \\"what gets contracted when fibers get shorter?\\", is the correct answer \\"nerves\\"? Possible answers:  * Yes  * No Answer:","output":"No, the correct answer is not \\"nerves.\\" When fibers get shorter during a bicep contraction, it is the muscle fibers that are contracting.  In more detail, muscles are composed of different types of fibers known as muscle fibers (not to be confused with nerves); these are elongated, multinucleated cells that consist mainly of actin and myosin filaments. Bicep contractions occur as a result of the interaction between these actin and myosin filaments within the muscle fibers. This interaction is regulated by a complex set of biochemical processes involving various proteins and ions such as calcium. When a motor nerve impulse reaches the muscle, it triggers the release of calcium ions from storage structures inside the muscle cell, called the sarcoplasmic reticulum. The increased intracellular calcium concentration binds to a protein called troponin, which is located on the actin filaments. This binding causes a conformational change in another protein called tropomyosin, moving it away from its blocking position on actin and exposing the myosin-binding sites on the actin filaments. This exposure allows the myosin heads to bind to the actin filaments, forming cross-bridges between them. Then, utilizing energy from adenosine triphosphate (ATP), the myosin heads tilt or \\"ratchet,\\" pulling the actin filaments toward each other, an action called the power stroke. This shortens the muscle fibers, resulting in muscle contraction. Following contraction, ATP binds to myosin, causing it to detach from actin, and the cycle repeats as long as the calcium concentration remains elevated. Once the nerve signal stops and the calcium concentration returns to its normal level, the muscle fibers relax and return to their original length. So in conclusion, when fibers get shorter during a bicep contraction, it is the muscle fibers that are contracting, not nerves."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant. You will be given a task.

Prefectural level cities form the second level of the administrative structure (alongside prefectures, leagues and autonomous prefectures). Administrative chiefs (mayors) of prefectural level cities generally have the same rank as a division chief of a national ministry. Since the 1980s, most former prefectures have been renamed into prefectural level cities.  - In geometric measurements, length is the most extended dimension of an object. In the International System of Quantities, length is any quantity with dimension distance. In other contexts \\"length\\" is the measured dimension of an object. For example, it is possible to cut a length of a wire which is shorter than wire thickness.  - Ili or Yili Kazakh Autonomous Prefecture  in northernmost Xinjiang is the only Kazakh autonomous prefecture in China.  - A shape is the form of an object or its external boundary, outline, or external surface, as opposed to other properties such as color, texture, or material composition.  - An \\"oil field\\" or \\"oilfield\\" is a region with an abundance of oil wells extracting petroleum (crude oil) from below ground. Because the oil reservoirs typically extend over a large area, possibly several hundred kilometres across, full exploitation entails multiple wells scattered across the area. In addition, there may be exploratory wells probing the edges, pipelines to transport the oil elsewhere, and support facilities.  - The surface area of a solid object is a measure of the total area that the surface of the object occupies. The mathematical definition of surface area in the presence of curved surfaces is considerably more involved than the definition of arc length of one-dimensional curves, or of the surface area for polyhedra (i.e., objects with flat polygonal faces), for which the surface area is the sum of the areas of its faces. Smooth surfaces, such as a sphere, are assigned surface area using their representation as parametric surfaces. This definition of surface area is based on methods of infinitesimal calculus and involves partial derivatives and double integration.   - China, officially the People's Republic of China (PRC), is a unitary sovereign state in East Asia. With a population of over 1.381 billion, it is the world's most populous country. The state is governed by the Communist Party of China, and its capital is Beijing. It exercises jurisdiction over 22 provinces, five autonomous regions, four direct-controlled municipalities (Beijing, Tianjin, Shanghai, and Chongqing), and two mostly self-governing special administrative regions (Hong Kong and Macau), and claims sovereignty over Taiwan. The country's major urban areas include Shanghai, Guangzhou, Beijing, Chongqing, Shenzhen, Tianjin and Hong Kong. China is a great power and a major regional power within Asia, and has been characterized as a potential superpower.  - Quantity is a property that can exist as a magnitude or multitude. Quantities can be compared in terms of \\"more\\", \\"less\\", or \\"equal\\", or by assigning a numerical value in terms of a unit of measurement. Quantity is among the basic classes of things along with quality, substance, change, and relation. Some quantities are such by their inner nature (as number), while others are functioning as states (properties, dimensions, attributes) of things such as heavy and light, long and short, broad and narrow, small and great, or much and little. A small quantity is sometimes referred to as a quantulum.  - Volume is the quantity of three-dimensional space enclosed by a closed surface, for example, the space that a substance (solid, liquid, gas, or plasma) or shape occupies or contains. Volume is often quantified numerically using the SI derived unit, the cubic metre.

Steven Lee Lukather (born October 21, 1957) is an American guitarist, singer, songwriter, arranger and record producer, best known for his work with the rock band Toto. A prolific session musician, Lukather has recorded guitar tracks for more than 1,500 albums representing a broad array of artists and genres. He has also contributed to albums and hit singles as a songwriter, arranger and producer. Lukather has released seven solo albums, the latest of which, Transition, was released in January 2013. The 1989 album Lukather came about after Toto had been recording and playing for 11 years, and the consensus among the band members was to take a break. As Lukather had written a number of songs that did not appear on Toto albums, he decided to pursue a solo album, with the intention of presenting a dimension of his music that fans would be unfamiliar with. He collaborated with many notable musicians, including Eddie Van Halen, Richard Marx, Jan Hammer, Steve Stevens, and fellow Toto members Jeff Porcaro and David Paich. Lukather has said that the album was produced very simply, and that a lot of ambient studio noise--counting off on various tracks, for instance--is audible on it. He also credits bands Pink Floyd, Cream, Led Zeppelin, and guitarists Jimi Hendrix, David Gilmour, Jeff Beck, and Eric Clapton as influences on the album. The single \\"Swear Your Love\\" came from the album.  Candyman, recorded and mastered from March 1993 through November 1993, was a collaboration of musicians who were for the most part also in Lukather's band Los Lobotomys. Toto familiars Simon Phillips and David Paich participated as well as David Garfield, John Pena, Chris Trujillo, Lenny Castro, Larry Klimas, Fee Waybill, Richard Page, and Paul Rodgers. Lukather recorded the album in mostly live takes with little overdubbing. Some international fans were confused about whether Candyman was a Steve Lukather album or a Los Lobotomys album. The Japanese and US releases of Candyman were under the Los Lobotomys name rather than Lukather's; the Japanese release also featured a version of the Hendrix song \\"Red House\\". The European release of Candyman was credited to Lukather alone. Additionally, the touring band for the album was sometimes introduced as \\"Steve Lukather and Los Lobotomys\\" and sometimes as just \\"Los Lobotomys\\". The song \\"Borrowed Time\\" was released as a single in Europe and included \\"Red House\\" as a B-side.  Lukather describes 1997's Luke as a much different and more \\"introspective\\" album than his previous two solo efforts. The album is a concentrated collection of many of Lukather's musical influences, and he deliberately let those influences come out on the album. Luke is an experimental album, and like Candyman it was recorded mostly in live sessions with minimal overdubbing and processing afterwards. Luke also features instrumentation not heard on previous Lukather albums: pedal steel, Harmonicas, Mellotrons, and experimental guitar, bass, and drum sounds. The US version of Luke includes a version of the Jeff Beck song \\"The Pump\\". The song \\"Hate Everything About U\\" was released as a single.

Write an article based on this summary: Conservationists and the green energy industry are demanding the Scottish government sets a new target to ensure half the country's power comes from renewables by 2030.","output":"Title: Scottish Conservationists and Green Energy Industry Call for New Renewable Energy Target by 2030 Introduction The importance of renewable energy cannot be overstated in today's world where climate change is an ever-growing threat. Scotland, with its abundant natural resources, has the potential to capitalize on renewable energy sources and set an example for other nations in embracing green power. Conservationists and green energy industry members are urging the Scottish government to take stronger action and set an ambitious target for the nation's renewable energy output. They want to see at least 50% of the country's power supply generated from renewable sources by 2030. Scotland's Potential in Renewable Energy Scotland is blessed with a dynamic landscape and climate, offering various opportunities for clean energy solutions. From wind and wave power to hydroelectric and solar energy, there are numerous ways Scotland could tap into its rich environmental heritage to mitigate the damaging effects of fossil fuels on the environment and contribute to global sustainability goals. The Benefits of a New Target Setting an ambitious target for renewables will not only help address climate change concerns, but also come with potential economic benefits for Scotland. Investments in renewable energy infrastructure can pave the way for new job opportunities, revitalizing local economies and ensuring the nation remains competitive on a global scale. Moreover, green energy solutions can lead to energy security, reducing the reliance on imported fossil fuels, as well as keeping energy prices affordable for consumers. Current Progress and Challenges Scotland is already making progress in the renewable energy sector. According to the Scottish government’s recent Energy Strategy report, 97.% of the nation's electricity demand was met by renewables in 2020. However, exceeding these figures through accelerated efforts will require collaboration between conservationists, the green energy industry, and the Scottish government. Key challenges include securing financial backing for renewable energy projects, modernizing the energy grid infrastructure, addressing concerns from local communities about the visual impact of wind turbines, and ensuring that wildlife and ecosystems are not negatively affected by these energy developments. United Call for Action As the demand for action from various stakeholders in the environmental and energy spheres increases, it is essential for the Scottish government to consider these voices and set a target that reflects both ecological stewardship and economic sustainability. A united front of conservationists, green industry players, and the general public can drive home the importance of this issue and provide a solid foundation for clean energy progress in Scotland. Conclusion With a wealth of natural resources available to them and the support of key industry players and conservationists, Scotland is well-positioned to achieve a renewable energy target that will significantly decrease its carbon footprint and contribute to global climate goals. It is now up to the Scottish government to seize this opportunity and make a commitment to leading the nation into a greener future by ensuring that half of the country's power comes from renewable sources by 2030."},{"instruction":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

Movie title: Don't Say a Word Movie plot: In 1991, a gang of thieves steal a rare 10-million gem, but, in the process, two of the gang double-cross their leader, Patrick Koster (Sean Bean) and take off with the precious stone. Ten years later, on the day before Thanksgiving, prominent private practice Manhattan child psychiatrist, Dr. Nathan R. Conrad (Michael Douglas), is invited by his friend and former colleague, Dr. Louis Sachs (Oliver Platt), to examine a disturbed young lady named Elisabeth Burrows (Brittany Murphy) at the state sanatorium. Having been released from prison on November 4, Patrick and the remaining gang members break into an apartment which overlooks Nathan's apartment, where he lives with his wife Aggie (Famke Janssen) and daughter Jessie (Skye McCole Bartusiak). That evening, Patrick kidnaps the psychiatrist's daughter as a means of forcing him to acquire a six-digit number from Elisabeth's memory. As Nathan visits Elisabeth, she is reluctant at first, but he gains her trust laterâespecially when he reveals that his daughter has been kidnapped and will be killed if he doesn't get the number they want. Dr. Sachs admits to Nathan that the gang who kidnapped Jessie also kidnapped his girlfriend to force him to acquire the number from Elisabeth. Sachs is then visited by Detective Sandra Cassidy (Jennifer Esposito) who reveals to him that his girlfriend has been found dead. Meanwhile, Aggie hears Jessie's voice and realizes the kidnappers reside in the apartment nearby. The kidnappers send one of them to kill Aggie while the others escape with Jessie, but Aggie sets an ambush and kills him. After Nathan takes Elisabeth out of the sanatorium, she remembers certain events regarding the gang. It is revealed that Elisabeth's dad was a member of the gang that committed the robbery ten years prior and that he double-crossed them and took the stolen gem. However, other members of the gang later found him and ordered him to reveal where he had hidden the gem, subsequently pushing him in front of a subway train. The gang members were...

The player who committed the foul is then required to exit the game for a predetermined amount of time and sit in an area off the field, typically labeled 'the penalty box.' They must remain in this penalty box for a specific duration, leaving their team with one less player on the field thus giving the opposing team an advantage. This is known as a power play. While it's true that physical contact does occur in other sports such as football, there is no 'penalty box' concept in football or in running races.

News article: ‘People love the gory ones,” a newspaper editor tells Edgar Allan Poe (John Cusack) early on in “The Raven,” and presumably that line was part of the producers’ original pitch meeting. I’m guessing the phrase “ ‘Se7en’ meets ‘Sherlock Holmes’” was tossed about, too. A grimly preposterous serial-killer thriller set in 19th-century Baltimore, this riff on the final days of the author of “The Tell-Tale Heart” and other masterpieces of the macabre might qualify as literary desecration if it weren’t so silly.      Cusack’s Poe — conceived here as close cousin to Robert Downey Jr’s Holmes — is a talented wreck whose best days are behind him but who can still rear up and spit in the eye of the philistines, of which there are many in 1849 Baltimore. They include his editor (Kevin McNally) and Captain Hamilton (Brendan Gleeson), wealthy and extremely hostile father to Poe’s beloved Emily (Alice Eve).      A depraved murderer is stalking the city, killing citizens in ways that copycat the author’s famous stories. A gruesome early highlight is the longtime Poe rival (John Warnaby) who gets the pit-and-pendulum treatment in disgusting detail. “But I’m only a critic!” he shrieks before expiring. I felt much the same way.      Initially a suspect, Poe ends up joining forces with the police inspector on the case, the manly Detective Fields (Luke Evans). The two race desperately from one horrific crime scene to the next — at a masked ball, in a church, backstage at a theater, in the sewers of Baltimore — and they’re led hither and thither by a mastermind whose cunning and resources seem increasingly far-fetched. “The Masque of the Red Death,” “The Cask of Amontillado,” “The Mystery of Marie Roget” — so many tales to choose from. “The Premature Burial” is reserved for Emily, who in Eve’s performance treats the ordeal as a particularly bad hair day.      “The Raven” has been directed by James McTeigue (”V for Vendetta”) with dark style and at galloping speed, neither of which disguise the fact that the movie often doesn’t make a lick of sense. If it were content to lighten up and admit it was trash, there might be some fun to be had, but the dialogue by Ben Livingston and Hannah Shakespeare mistakes the florid for the eloquent. (“God gave him a spark of genius and quenched it with misery,” someone says about Poe.) The jolts are effective in their Pavlovian way; it’s everything else that lets you down.      Sadly, the overripe notion of Edgar Allan Poe, action hero, never takes off. Cusack wants to give a serious performance — historically inaccurate goatee and all — in a movie that isn’t built for it. (Let’s hope Benjamin Walker in this summer’s “Abraham Lincoln: Vampire Hunter” doesn’t have the same problem.) The star is pale enough to qualify for a Tim Burton movie but he’s awfully well-fed to play late-stage Poe, and he never summons up the glint of madness you get in photographs of the author. Behind the blowhard arrogance, Edgar seems eminently sane ­— not exactly what’s called for.      What “The Raven” lacks in narrative invention it makes up for by pushing the audience’s face in blood, guts, and hacked flesh. You get that the filmmakers are going for a modern take on Poe’s Gothic vision, but their approach has no poetry and barely any prose. After the “Holmes” movies, “The League of Extraordinary Gentlemen,” and this, the steampunk-action genre may be played out.

Fields Luke Evans      Emily Alice Eve      Col. Hamilton Brendan Gleeson      Maddox Kevin McNally            Relativity Media presents a film directed by James McTeigue. Written by Ben Livingston and Hannah Shakespeare. Running time: 111 minutes. Rated R (for bloody violence and grisly images). Printer-friendly »      E-mail this to a friend »      On Oct. 3, 1849, Edgar Allan Poe was found wandering the streets of Baltimore, raving and incoherent. He died on Oct. 7, at age 40. His death was about as much of a surprise as the passing of such modern icons as Kurt Cobain and Amy Winehouse. Poe was an acute alcoholic, particularly fond by the notorious spirit absinthe. He also used opium and who knows what other substances, and as a man supported only by his writings, may have been badly nourished. This is a lifestyle known to lend itself to incoherent wanderings.      \\"The Raven,\\" a feverish costume thriller, attempts to explain Poe's death by cobbling together spare parts from thrillers about serial killers. It should not be mistaken for a movie about Edgar Allan Poe, although to be sure, he buys a drink for a man in a tavern who is able to complete this line of poetry: \\"Quoth the raven…\\" When I heard that John Cusack had been cast for this film, it sounded like good news: I could imagine him as Poe, tortured and brilliant, lashing out at a cruel world. But that isn't the historical Poe the movie has in mind. It is a melodramatic Poe, calling for the gifts of Nicolas Cage.            The film opens with Poe on a Baltimore park bench, beneath a tree limb holding a large, malevolent raven. Mad magazine would know what to do with that image. Then it flashes back to Poe, broke and in serious need of a drink, bursting into a tavern and expecting to imbibe on credit. He boasts of his fame, issues \\"The Raven\\"-quoting challenge and immediately establishes himself as a disappointment to those who find Poe a complex and fascinating man.            Poe wrote fiction that is read for pleasure to this day. He has possibly inspired more movies than anyone except Shakespeare. In \\"The Raven,\\" we quickly meet one of his editors, Henry Maddox (Kevin McNally), editor of a trashy Baltimore tabloid, who orders Poe to return to the lurid horror tales he's famous for, instead of his more introspective recent stuff. Poe soon finds the inspiration for macabre material.            Two women are discovered murdered in a locked room. Emmett Fields (Luke Evans), the detective on the case, discovers that the killer must have escaped in the same way used in Poe's \\"The Murders in the Rue Morgue.\\" It has slipped from Fields' memory that the killer in that tale was an orangutan, but never mind: Poe becomes a suspect. Shortly after, a man is discovered sliced in two in the manner used in Poe's \\"The Pit and the Pendulum.\\" It is a grievous death: The victim cries out that he is too insignificant to justify such a laborious means of death; after all, he screams, \\"I'm only a critic.\\"            Now Poe and Fields find themselves working in tandem, since the killer is apparently a man willing to go to much trouble to draw attention to the works of Poe. A rich young woman named Emily (Alice Eve) is kidnapped, and ransom notes demand that Poe write an account of their investigation for Henry Maddox's scandal sheet. \\"The Raven\\" now indulges in a plot that will remind you of any number of serial-killer movies, in which we're expected to believe that a madman goes to astonishing trouble while killing a lot of people simply to devise an elegant puzzle for the hero to solve. This can work nicely, as in \\"Se7en,\\" but in \\"The Raven,\\" it is all concoction, a device to link Edgar Allan Poe with modern serial-killer formulas and shovel in a great deal of special-effects violence.            The use of sensational effects may be a temptation for a director like James McTeigue, whose first feature, \\"V for Vendetta\\" (2005), was actually pretty good. They create a problem of proportion for a period film like this, where personality and atmosphere should create suspense; extreme violence is unnecessary, although I realize that at least some Friday-night moviegoers will be hoping for it and have only a vague notion of when 1849 might have been. ||||| What is a shorter version of the above article?","output":"\\"The Raven\\" is a film set in 19th-century Baltimore, portraying a fictional tale of Edgar Allan Poe's final days interwoven with a serial-killer thriller.

Question: What is the full professional name of the person who sand lead vocals in his bands cover of \\"Act Naturally\\"?  Answer the above question based on the context below:  Sir Richard Starkey  (born 7 July 1940), known professionally as Ringo Starr, is an English musician, singer, songwriter and actor who gained worldwide fame as the drummer for the Beatles. He occasionally sang lead vocals with the group, usually for one song on each album, including \\"With a Little Help from My Friends\\", \\"Yellow Submarine\\", \\"Good Night\\", and their cover of \\"Act Naturally\\". He also wrote and sang the Beatles' songs \\"Don't Pass Me By\\" and \\"Octopus's Garden\\", and is credited as a co-writer of others, including \\"What Goes On\\" and \\"Flying\\". Starr was afflicted by life-threatening illnesses during childhood, and he fell behind in school as a result of prolonged hospitalisations. He briefly held a position with British Rail before securing an apprenticeship at a Liverpool equipment manufacturer. Soon afterwards, he became interested in the UK skiffle craze and developed a fervent admiration for the genre. In 1957, he co-founded his first band, the Eddie Clayton Skiffle Group, which earned several prestigious local bookings before the fad succumbed to American rock and roll by early 1958. When the Beatles formed in 1960, Starr was a member of another Liverpool group, Rory Storm and the Hurricanes. After achieving moderate success in the UK and Hamburg, he quit the Hurricanes and joined the Beatles in August 1962, replacing Pete Best. Starr played key roles in the Beatles' films and appeared in numerous others. After the band's break-up in 1970, he released several successful singles including the US number-four hit \\"It Don't Come Easy\\", and number ones \\"Photograph\\" and \\"You're Sixteen\\". In 1972, he released his most successful UK single, \\"Back Off Boogaloo\\", which peaked at number two. He achieved commercial and critical success with his 1973 album Ringo, which was a top-ten release in both the UK and the US.

Summarize the following: Not all hiking trips will be the same and there are varying styles of backpacks that can meet the demands of these differences.  Depending on the length of your hike and the gear you need to carry you will need to purchase a backpack with the correct frame style.  Backpacks with external frames are mainly used for heavy and asymmetrical loads. An internal frame backpack might be right for you if you need to maintain stability and don't need to carry heavy items. Frame-less backpacks are for those hikers who don't need to carry much gear with them and like to move quickly on their hike. Hiking backpacks will need to be fitted exactly to the size of your torso.  Any backpack that isn't the right size won't fit correctly and will be uncomfortable or may cause injury.  Measure your torso's length and hip width before you buy your backpack to ensure a great fit.  Measure your torso's length by starting from the top bump at the base of your neck down to your hip level. Measure your hips to make sure that the hip belt will fit.  Your hip measurement will be taken just above where your pants normally rest. Before you load up your backpack and head out hiking you will need to properly fit your backpack.  Try wearing your backpack and then making adjustments using the straps on your backpack where needed.  There will generally be four main areas to adjust including the hip-belt, shoulder straps, load lifters, and sternum straps.  The hip-belt should fit snugly around your hips and will support much of the weight. Shoulder straps should pull the bag tight against your back but not actually carry much of the weight. Some backpacks will have load-lifting straps.  These should relieve the weight from your shoulders and help keep it properly distributed. The sternum strap will pull the weight up and away from your shoulders and should fight tightly and comfortably across your chest. When it comes to hiking backpacks, it is ideal to visit a store where you can try on the backpacks in person.  Although you might know your measurements, each backpack might fight differently in actuality.  Try on plenty of backpacks before purchasing one to make sure you find the right fit. If you are unable to visit a store you may still be able to try a backpack and return it free of charge if the manufacturer allows for it.","output":"Hiking trips can be quite varied in terms of duration and the type of gear required, making it essential to choose a backpack with the appropriate frame style. There are three primary backpack frame styles, each designed to cater to specific hiking needs: external frames for heavy and asymmetrical loads, internal frames for maintaining stability without carrying heavy items, and frame-less backpacks for lightweight gear and agility. In order to ensure a comfortable and well-fitted backpack, hikers must accurately measure their torso length and hip width before making a purchase. The torso length is measured from the base of the neck to the hip level, while the hip measurement is taken just above where one's pants typically rest. Having the correct backpack sizing is crucial in preventing discomfort and possible injuries. Once the backpack has been purchased, it is important to properly adjust it for a comfortable fit. This typically involves tweaking four main adjustment areas: hip-belt, shoulder straps, load lifters, and sternum straps. The hip-belt should fit snugly around the hips, taking on most of the weight, while shoulder straps should help keep the bag close to the back without bearing much weight. Load-lifting straps, if present, are designed to alleviate shoulder weight and maintain even distribution. Lastly, the sternum strap should fit tightly across the chest, lifting the weight away from the shoulders. To ensure the most accurate fit, it is recommended that hikers visit a store to try on backpacks in person. This allows for a better understanding of how each backpack fits and accommodates individual measurements. However, if visiting a store is not possible, some manufacturers may offer a try-and-return policy that allows customers to return the backpack free of charge if it is not a suitable fit. Overall, selecting and adjusting the right backpack is essential for a comfortable and successful hiking experience."},{"instruction":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

How dare you charge me a resort fee for wifi and other amenities when the internet NEVER worked, no coffee maker in the room, cable tv would digitize the picture to the point of making it unwatchable, and the rooms don't have a mini fridge.  Sat at a slot machine for 40 minutes and never saw a cocktail waitress. I had to get up and pay for a luke warm Corona.  Bartenders walked by us 3 times before we got up and left the bar.  Wallpaper was peeling off our hotel room wall. In the sports book, the chair I was sitting in looked like it had been chewed on by a dog. The stuffing was coming out of it.  The players club perks are a joke. After gambling over 2000.00 we only earned 2.50 in resort credits!!! Man is that a perk or what?? This place stunk!!!

The complaints about WiFi, coffee makers, cable TV, and mini-fridges convey that the author is unhappy with the available amenities. 4. The mention of not seeing a cocktail waitress after 40 minutes at a slot machine conveys frustration with the service. 5.

AP - The bullet-riddled body of a kidnapped Turkish engineer was found Wednesday in eastern Afghanistan, a day after he was snatched with his driver and interpreter by a band of armed men, officials said. What is this text about?","output":"This text is a news summary about a tragic incident that occurred in eastern Afghanistan. The main subject is the unfortunate discovery of the lifeless body of a Turkish engineer who had been kidnapped earlier. The events described took place over two days, with the kidnapping being carried out by a group of armed individuals, who also abducted the engineer's driver and interpreter at the same time. In order to further understand the context of this summary, it is important to highlight the key points: 1. Kidnapping Incident: The Turkish engineer, alongside his driver and interpreter, was abducted by a group of armed men in eastern Afghanistan. This suggests that the event happened in an area of continuing conflict and possible instability, with armed groups resorting to kidnapping as a form of violence and intimidation. 2. Victim: The primary victim in this case is a Turkish national who was working as an engineer in Afghanistan. This highlights a potential risk for foreign professionals working in conflict-affected areas due to their vulnerability to being targeted by such armed groups. It also demonstrates that engineers and others involved in infrastructure development are not immune to the dangers that prevail in regions marred by conflict. 3. Discovery of the Body: The engineer's body was found riddled with bullets, indicating that he had been brutally murdered after his abduction. This outcome not only further emphasizes the potential danger faced by foreign professionals working in conflict zones, but also underscores the ruthlessness and brutality employed by the armed men involved in the kidnapping. 4. Status of the Other Abductees: The news summary only specifically mentions the discovery of the Turkish engineer's body but does not provide details on the condition or whereabouts of the driver and interpreter who were kidnapped alongside him. This leaves open questions about their status, outcome, and the motivations behind the armed group's actions. 5. Officials' Involvement: The information about the incident was provided by officials, suggesting that law enforcement and other authorities are aware of and addressing the situation. However, the limited details shared about the case also raise questions about the effectiveness of the authorities in dealing with such crimes in the region. In conclusion, this news summary highlights a troubling incident in eastern Afghanistan where a Turkish engineer was brutally murdered after being kidnapped along with his driver and interpreter. The case underscores the dangers faced by professionals in conflict-affected areas and brings attention to the challenges faced by local authorities in preventing and addressing such crimes."},{"instruction":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

Sentence 1 states that \\"David Plotz foretold Brown's departure in a recent Slate Assessment.\\" This suggests that David Plotz, presumably a writer or analyst, predicted that Brown would be leaving a specific organization or group, and this prediction was published in a Slate Assessment. The main focus of this sentence is the prediction of Brown's departure. Sentence 2 states that \\"They had a heads up about them joining the team.\\" This implies that someone (they) was given prior notice or information about a person or individuals (them) joining a team. The main focus of this sentence is the prior knowledge of someone's arrival or inclusion in a team. Based on the provided information, it is difficult to assert that the second sentence is true if the first sentence is true. The two sentences seem to be addressing two different scenarios - one pertaining to a departure and the other concerning an arrival or joining of a team. For the second sentence to be true based on the first sentence, there should be an explicit link between Brown's departure and the subsequent joining of the team by someone else. However, the connection between these two events is not made clear in either of the given sentences. In conclusion, since there isn't a clear reference or connection between Brown's departure and the joining of the team by someone else, we cannot firmly establish the truthfulness of the second sentence based on the truth of the first sentence.

In their words: \\"We could however, send them checks for minuscule sums of money—sums so small they couldn’t fund as much as a minute of the recipients’ existence—and see who would bother to bank these teensy amounts of money.\\" Spy thought \\"some subterfuge\\" would be necessary—it'd be suspicious to get a check from the magazine that lampooned so many of the intended recipients. This was specifically true for Trump, who Spy once famously referred to as a \\"short-fingered vulgarian.\\" So, they created a fully funded and incorporated company called National Refund Clearinghouse, which allowed them to open a checking account. Then they drafted a letter explaining that the check was a refund for a small overcharge that had occurred in 1988—what the celebrities had been overcharged for was never mentioned. They sent the checks out (initially for 1.11) to 58 well-known people like Cher, Henry Kissinger, and, of course, Donald Trump. Of the 58, 26 cashed the checks—Donald included. The magazine drafted a followup letter and checks for 0.64 to those 26 people to see who would take more free money. Thirteen—including Donald Trump—deposited the checks worth two quarters, a dime, and four pennies into their banks. Then they went for one last score: in honor of those 13 people, 13 more checks for 0.13. Two people cashed them: a Saudi arms dealer named Adnan Khashoggi, and Donald Trump. Seriously.” I really don’t know if this is the most “cheapskate” thing, on just CRAZY fiscal responsibility. But if I had to pick, this would get my vote… resources: Splinter - The truth hurts Spy Magazine probably felt what about the celebrities who cashed the checks?

You will be given a task. You must generate a detailed and long answer. Q: Answer the following question given this paragraph:   The number of protons in an atom is called its atomic number. This is also unique for each element.   Q: The atomic number is the same as the number of what in an atom?   A: A:","output":"The atomic number in an atom is the same as the number of protons within the nucleus of that atom. An atomic number is an important identifier for a chemical element as it helps to define their distinct identity and characteristics. Each element has a unique atomic number, which represents the fundamental property of an atom, thereby distinguishing one element from another. Protons are subatomic particles with a positive electric charge, and they exist in the nucleus of an atom along with neutrons (which have no charge). The arrangement of electrons, which are negatively charged particles that circle the nucleus in specific energy levels or electron shells, is also dependent on the number of protons in the nucleus. Since electrons have a negative charge equal to the positive charge of a proton, the overall electric charge of the atom is neutral, with the quantity of protons and electrons being equal in a stable, uncharged atom. To summarize, the atomic number is the same as the number of protons in an atom and is used to identify and differentiate chemical elements based on their unique properties and characteristics. The atomic number also helps to determine the configuration of electrons around the nucleus, playing a crucial role in the atom's behavior, reactivity, and interactions with other species."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Captured Moments by Will Shetterly I remember Papa's stopbox, a teal blue Tiempo Capturado that Mama brought home for his birthday. It was huge and inefficient, and she should never have spent so many pesos on a toy, but Papa would not let her return it. He used it to preserve baby tomatoes, cucumbers, and strawberries in translucent cubes that he stored in the pantry for spring-time meals in the middle of winter. Mama kept her mink jacket, a family hand-me-down, safe from time in a stopbox, and lent the capturador to my uncle for his stamp collection. Sometimes they would let us little ones to seal a treasured toy or a last piece of birthday cake until we begged them for its release, usually a few hours after enclosing it. When my father died, a year after my mother, my sisters and I cleaned out their apartment. We found our baby shoes protected in stopboxes. I took mine home, where they sat above my computer while I worked on my first play. One night when I did not believe love had ever existed for anyone, I used my own capturador, a sleek titanium Sanyo Tardar Ahora, to undo the stopbox. Bringing my face close to the shoes, I breathed deeply of air that my parents had trapped while closing up that symbol of their love for me. The instant would have been improved had my baby shoes been cleaned before they were encased. But as soon as I coughed, I laughed, and I did not try to kill myself that night.

Answer by taking a quote from the following article: Garibaldi was born and christened Joseph-Marie Garibaldi on 4 July 1807 in Nice, which had been directly annexed by First French Empire in 1805, to Ligurian family of Giovanni Domenico Garibaldi from Chiavari and Maria Rosa Nicoletta Raimondo from Loano. In 1814, the Congress of Vienna returned Nice to Victor Emmanuel I of Sardinia; nevertheless, France re-annexed it in 1860 by the Treaty of Turin, which was ardently opposed by Garibaldi. Garibaldi's family's involvement in coastal trade drew him to a life at sea. Garibaldi returned to Italy amidst the turmoil of the revolutions of 1848 in the Italian states and offered his services to Charles Albert of Sardinia. The monarch displayed some liberal inclinations, but treated Garibaldi with coolness and distrust. Rebuffed by the Piedmontese, he and his followers crossed into Lombardy where they offered assistance to the provisional government of Milan, which had rebelled against the Austrian occupation. In the course of the following unsuccessful First Italian War of Independence, he led his legion to two minor victories at Luino and Morazzone.  After the crushing Piedmontese defeat at Novara (23 March 1849), Garibaldi moved to Rome to support the Republic recently proclaimed in the Papal States, but a French force sent by Louis Napoleon (the future Napoleon III) threatened to topple it. At Mazzini's urging, Garibaldi took command of the defence of Rome. In fighting near Velletri, Achille Cantoni saved his life. After Cantoni's death, during the Battle of Mentana, Garibaldi wrote the novel Cantoni il volontario.  On 30 April 1849 the Republican army, under Garibaldi's command, defeated a numerically far superior French army. Subsequently, French reinforcements arrived, and the siege of Rome began on 1 June. Despite the resistance of the Republican army, the French prevailed on 29 June. On 30 June the Roman Assembly met and debated three options: surrender, continue fighting in the streets, or retreat from Rome to continue resistance from the Apennine mountains. Garibaldi made a speech favoring the third option and then said: Dovunque saremo, cola sara Roma. (Wherever we may be, there will be Rome).  A truce was negotiated on 1 July, and on 2 July Garibaldi withdrew from Rome with 4,000 troops. The French Army entered Rome on 3 July and reestablished the Holy See's temporal power. Garibaldi and his forces, hunted by Austrian, French, Spanish, and Neapolitan troops, fled to the north with the intention to reach Venice, where the Venetians were still resisting the Austrian siege. After an epic march, Garibaldi took momentary refuge in San Marino, with only 250 men still following him. Anita, who was carrying their fifth child, died near Comacchio during the retreat. How did the war end?","output":"The war ended with the French prevailing on 29 June.

It traces its roots back to the Puritans in England, where Evangelicalism originated, and then was brought to the United States.

Given the question: Q: Instead of a nervous system, plant responses are generally controlled by what type of molecules, which serves as chemical messengers?    Choices:  - receptors  - enzymes  - sugars  - hormones  A: The answer is:","output":"- Hormones Plant responses are generally controlled by hormones, which serve as chemical messengers in various aspects of plant growth, development, and overall function. Unlike animals that have a complex nervous system to regulate their responses, plants rely on hormones to convey information within them and coordinate essential processes. Plant hormones are organic substances that are produced by plants in small amounts. They help to regulate a wide array of physiological activities, such as growth and development, reproductive activities, cellular processes, and responses to environmental stimuli. Some of the major plant hormones include auxins, gibberellins, cytokinins, abscisic acid, and ethylene. Here's a brief overview of their roles: 1. Auxins - These hormones are responsible for promoting cell elongation, stimulating tissue growth, and coordinating processes related to phototropism (plant growth in response to light) and gravitropism (plant growth in response to gravity). Auxins are also crucial in managing apical dominance, where the main shoot of a plant inhibits the growth of lateral (side) shoots. 2. Gibberellins - These hormones play a vital role in cell growth and elongation, stem elongation, seed germination, flowering initiation, and fruit development. Gibberellins work in conjunction with auxins to support many key growth processes in plants. 3. Cytokinins - These hormones act as the primary regulators of cell division, differentiation, and overall development. Additionally, cytokinins help maintain overall plant health by delaying senescence (aging) in leaves and regulating nutrient allocation. 4. Abscisic Acid (ABA) - This hormone plays a significant role in plant adaptation to environmental stress, such as high or low temperatures, drought, and salinity. ABA is essential in processes like stomatal closure (to reduce water loss through transpiration) and seed dormancy (to delay germination under unfavorable conditions). 5. Ethylene - A gaseous hormone, ethylene is involved in regulating fruit ripening, flower wilting, and leaf senescence. It is also responsible for the \\"triple response\\" mechanism that allows seedlings to navigate around obstacles in dark environments, such as soil. In conclusion, plant responses are mainly controlled by hormones, which serve as chemical messengers and play a vital role in regulating various processes like growth, development, reproduction, and adaptation to environmental conditions. These complex signaling molecules allow plants to manage their physiological activities without the need for a centralized nervous system."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

With many Americans growing increasingly dissatisfied with his handling of various issues, political analyst Gloria Borger suggests the president must be wondering how he ended up in this predicament. By delving into the crux of the matter, one can identify Obama's decision to back former President George W. Bush's surveillance policies as a pivotal factor contributing to his decreasing support. This article will highlight the importance of President Obama leading the debate over security and surveillance policies rather than merely listening to it, emphasizing his need to take proactive measures to win back public trust. The Predicament: Supporting Bush's Surveillance Policies One might be tempted to ask, \\"Why is President Obama's approval rating plummeting despite his promises of change?\\" The answer lies in his unexpected support for the controversial surveillance policies enacted by his predecessor, George W. Bush. This decision has left many Americans feeling betrayed, given Obama's campaign emphasized transparency and civil liberties. In the aftermath of the 9/11 terrorist attacks, the Bush administration implemented several surveillance measures designed to identify and prevent potential threats to national security. These policies, however, were met with significant criticism, as they were seen as an infringement on citizens' privacy and civil liberties. When Obama took office, many expected him to dismantle these controversial policies. Instead, the president not only continued to support them but expanded some of these programs. As a result, Obama's perceived commitment to transparency and civil liberties was called into question, contributing to his dwindling approval ratings. The Need for Leadership: Obama's Role in the Security Debate In light of the public's growing discontent with his administration's surveillance policies, President Obama must take the initiative in leading the debate over national security and striking a balance between ensuring the safety of the nation and respecting individual privacy rights. By merely listening to the debate on national security policies and deferring to others, President Obama effectively loses the opportunity to guide the narrative and address citizens' concerns directly. Displaying proactive leadership in the ongoing debate is essential for the president to regain public confidence and demonstrate that he values and respects the civil liberties of Americans. The Path Forward: Striking a Balance Between Security and Privacy To win back the trust of the American public, President Obama must act swiftly in reassessing the current surveillance policies and finding a balance between the protection of national security and honoring civil liberties. This involves reevaluating the extent to which the government monitors private communications and seizing the opportunity to lead the conversation on the necessity of surveillance programs in today's world. A prime example of striking this balance is establishing stricter guidelines and increased oversight for surveillance programs, ensuring that the government's watchful eye does not overstep the boundaries of personal privacy. By communicating these changes to the public, President Obama can assure the people that their rights will be protected while still maintaining the measures necessary to ensure national security. Conclusion In conclusion, President Obama's approval ratings will continue to suffer as long as he avoids addressing the concerns surrounding his support of George W. Bush's surveillance policies. By taking the lead in the security debate and working towards policies that balance national security with civil liberties, Obama has the opportunity to win back public trust and restore his administration's credibility. Upholding the values of transparency and civil rights, which he had professed during his election campaign, is crucial for President Obama to reestablish his image as a leader who is genuinely committed to the prosperity and safety of the nation."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

(Quique Kierszenbaum/Getty Images)      Israel arrested at least 25 members of the Palestinian militant group Hamas in a raid early Monday morning, according to the BBC.      It's reported three members of the Palestinian parliament — Hatem Kafisha, Mohammad Al-Tal and Ahmad Atoun — were also arrested.      Israel considers Hamas a terrorist group, and though the government confirmed the arrests to the Associated Press, they did not give specifics on why the arrests were made.      \\"Overnight 25 Palestinians were arrested all over the West Bank,\\" the Israeli army said.      The AP also reported that among those detained was an unidentified man responsible for reconciliation talks between Hamas and its political and secular opponent Fatah.      Hamas denounced the arrests, saying they undermine Palestinian reconciliation efforts between themselves and President Mahmoud Abbas' Fatah Party, according to Haaretz.      Dr. Hanan Ashrawi, an executive committee member of the multi-party group Palestinian Liberation Organization, strongly condemned the arrests of Palestinian lawmakers.      “With such arbitrary arrests, Israel has violated international law and the most basic norms of human rights,\\" Ashrawi said in a press release Monday.      \\"Israel is not above the law. Therefore, we call on all parliaments — Arab, European and international — to hold Israel accountable and to ensure the release of Palestinian lawmakers,\\" he con      Today's raid is not unprecedented.

Bank designed to foil efforts to reconcile with Fatah.      Hamas legislator Ahmed Attoun. Photo: Sam Sokol      Defiant Hamas leaders in the Gaza Strip said that the arrest of the movement’s political representatives in the West Bank by the IDF was designed to sabotage efforts to achieve reconciliation with Fatah.      Hamas spokesman Fawzi Barhoum said that the arrests won’t “obstruct Hamas’s role in defending the Palestinians and their lands and holy sites.”      Barhoum said the arrests were primarily designed to foil efforts to achieve reconciliation between Fatah and Hamas.      The IDF crackdown on the Hamas leadership came as representatives of the movement and Fatah prepared to launch fresh reconciliation talks in Cairo in a bid to end their dispute.      Hamas legislator Salah Bardaweel condemned the IDF crackdown, but also criticized the Palestinian Authority for detaining Hamas supporters in the West Bank.      Bardaweel called on the Egyptians to exert pressure on Israel to secure the release of the Hamas men.      Palestinian sources said the Hamas officials were arrested in pre-dawn raids on their homes in Nablus and Hebron.      An IDF spokeswoman confirmed that 23 Hamas members were taken into custody out of a total of 25 arrests made Monday. The arrests occurred in Nablus, Ramallah, Kalkiliya, and Hebron.      Speaking to The Jerusalem Post, a senior defense source said the arrests were part of a wider effort to prevent Hamas from assembling an infrastructure in the West Bank.      “It’s part of the ‘lawn mowing’ that is required to stop Hamas from converting street popularity and its motivation into organizational achievements,” the source added.      Among those arrested, according to Palestinian sources, are three Hamas legislators: Ahmed Attoun, Mohamed al-Tal and Hatem Kafisheh.      Ahmad Attoun was elected to the Palestinian Legislative Council in 2006. He was exiled to the West Bank from Israel two years ago after being detained in the Jerusalem neighborhood of Sheikh Jarrah.      He had been living in the headquarters if the Red Cross there for over a year in order to avoid arrest due to his refusal to renounce his allegiance with Hamas.      The IDF also arrested top Hamas figures Adnan Asfour, Baker Bilal and Omar al-Jabarini.      In recent days, the Palestinian Authority security forces in the West Bank also arrested several Hamas operatives, including some who had just been released from Israeli prison.      PLO Executive Committee member Dr. Hanan Ashrawi on Monday condemned the arrest of several Palestinian lawmakers, calling the arrests “arbitrary” and accusing Israel of “deliberately breaching international law and conventions relating to the immunity of democratically elected Palestinian officials.”      “It is apparent the Israeli government is implementing a policy of intimidation and power politics to meddle in Palestinian domestic affairs and to undermine reconciliation efforts,” she said.      She called on the international community to “hold Israel accountable and to ensure the release of Palestinian lawmakers.”      Sam Sokol and Jerusalem Post staff contributed to this report. ||||| Write a summary.","output":"In February 2013, the Israeli army arrested 25 Hamas members, including three parliamentarians, during a nighttime operation in the West Bank.

Please answer the following question: Information:  - Classical music is art music produced or rooted in the traditions of Western music, including both liturgical (religious) and secular music. While a more accurate term is also used to refer to the period from 1750 to 1820 (the Classical period), this article is about the broad span of time from roughly the 11th century to the present day, which includes the Classical period and various other periods. The central norms of this tradition became codified between 1550 and 1900, which is known as the common-practice period. The major time divisions of Western art music are as follows:  European art music is largely distinguished from many other non-European and some popular musical forms by its system of staff notation, in use since about the 16th century. Western staff notation is used by composers to indicate to the performer the pitches (e.g., melodies, basslines, chords), tempo, meter and rhythms for a piece of music. This can leave less room for practices such as improvisation and \\"ad libitum\\" ornamentation, which are frequently heard in non-European art music and in popular-music styles such as jazz and blues. Another difference is that whereas most popular styles adopt the song (strophic) form, classical music has been noted for its development of highly sophisticated forms of instrumental music such as the concerto, symphony, sonata, and mixed vocal and instrumental styles such as opera which, since they are written down, can sustain larger forms and attain a high level of complexity.  - Canadian Idol was a Canadian reality television competition show which aired on CTV, based on the British show \\"Pop Idol\\". The show was a competition to find the most talented young singer in Canada, and was hosted by Ben Mulroney. Jon Dore was the \\"roving reporter\\" for the first three seasons (appearing in comedy skits throughout the show). Elena Juatco (a season 2 contestant) assumed the role for season four, Dave Kerr had the role in season five and Jully Black in season six.  - Pop Idol is a British television music competition created by Simon Fuller which ran on ITV from 2001 to 2003. The aim of the show was to decide the best new young pop singer (or \\"pop idol\\") in the UK based on viewer voting and participation. Two series were broadcastone in 20012002 and a second in 2003. \\"Pop Idol\\" was subsequently put on an indefinite hiatus after series judge Simon Cowell announced the launch of \\"The X Factor\\" in the UK in April 2004.  - Jazz is a music genre that originated amongst African Americans in New Orleans, United States, in the late 19th and early 20th centuries. Since the 1920s jazz age, jazz has become recognized as a major form of musical expression. It emerged in the form of independent traditional and popular musical styles, all linked by the common bonds of African American and European American musical parentage with a performance orientation. Jazz is characterized by swing and blue notes, call and response vocals, polyrhythms and improvisation. Jazz has roots in West African cultural and musical expression, and in African-American music traditions including blues and ragtime, as well as European military band music. Although the foundation of jazz is deeply rooted within the Black experience of the United States, different cultures have contributed their own experience and styles to the art form as well. Intellectuals around the world have hailed jazz as \\"one of America's original art forms\\".  - Tyler Hamilton is a pop singer best known for placing seventh in the first season of Canadian Idol . He is also a member of the classical music group \`\` Due Voci . '' The group has recently released their first studio album in June 2010 .  - Blues is a genre and musical form originated by African Americans in the Deep South of the United States around the end of the 19th century. The genre developed from roots in African musical traditions, African-American work songs and European-American folk music. Blues incorporated spirituals, work songs, field hollers, shouts, chants, and rhymed simple narrative ballads. The blues form, ubiquitous in jazz, rhythm and blues and rock and roll, is characterized by the call-and-response pattern, the blues scale and specific chord progressions, of which the twelve-bar blues is the most common. Blue notes (or \\"worried notes\\"), usually thirds or fifths flattened in pitch, are also an essential part of the sound. Blues shuffles or walking bass reinforce the trance-like rhythm and form a repetitive effect known as the groove.

Background: Unfortunately, the layer of good ozone is being destroyed by air pollution. The chief culprits are chlorine and bromine gases. They are released in aerosol sprays, coolants, and other products. Loss of ozone has created an ozone hole over Antarctica. Ozone depletion results in higher levels of UV radiation reaching Earth. In humans, this increases skin cancers and eye cataracts. It also disturbs the nitrogen cycle, kills plankton, and disrupts ocean food webs. The total loss of the ozone layer would be devastating to most life. Its rate of loss has slowed with restrictions on pollutants, but it is still at risk.  Paragraph: Keith is an environmental scientist. He was studying the loss of ozone layer and its effect on different species. His data showed that in the beginning or twentieth century there were hardly any loss of ozone layer. He categorized that time period as time A. Further inquiry revealed that things didn't go well at the end of twentieth century - when there were severe loss of ozone layer. He categorized that time as time B.  Given the paragraph above, please answer correctly the following question: Would skin cancer be more prevalent or less prevalent in time A than in time B? The answer to this question is:","output":"Skin cancer would be less prevalent in time A than in time B. This is because the paragraph states that there was hardly any loss of the ozone layer in the beginning of the twentieth century (time A), while there was severe loss of the ozone layer at the end of the twentieth century (time B).

Identify the subject and verb: In this case, \\"Are you tracking\\" is the verb phrase and \\"Ms. Roth\\" is the subject. 2. Determine the Czech equivalents: The verb \\"to track\\" translates to \\"sledovat\\" in Czech, and the pronoun \\"you\\" translates to \\"Vy\\". 3. Conjugate the verb: Since we're addressing \\"you\\" (Vy) in the second person plural, we need to conjugate the verb accordingly. This gives us \\"sledujete\\" for \\"are you tracking\\". 4. Translate the subject: In Czech, it is common to use the last name with a gender-specific suffix to denote respect or politeness. In this case, the female suffix \\"-ová\\" is added to the last name \\"Roth\\" to form \\"Rothová\\". Since we're addressing a female, we'll add \\"slečna\\" before the last name, which means \\"Ms.\\" in English. 5.

Process:  - Acid rain leaches aluminum from clay particles in soil - Aluminum flows into streams and lakes - Acid rain dissolves minerals and nutrients in soil - Washes them away so plants can&#x27;t benefit from them - PH in soil and water gets affected which can kill plants and animals - Acid rain in fog at higher elevations can strip foliage off trees.  Perturbation hypothesis: suppose stronger fuel type happens, how will it affect more Aluminum is taken from the soil.  Does the supposed perturbation have an effect (direct or indirect) on the process? A:","output":"The perturbation hypothesis in this scenario suggests a stronger fuel type that potentially has more sulfur and nitrogen compounds when burned. This would lead to increased emissions of sulfur dioxide (SO2) and nitrogen oxides (NOx), which are primary precursors to the formation of acid rain. The increased acid rain formation due to stronger fuel types would have the following effects on the process: 1. Enhanced leaching of aluminum: More acid deposition in the soil would enhance the leaching of aluminum from clay particles. This can happen because the increased acidity would dissolve the aluminum-containing minerals more efficiently, releasing even more aluminum ions into the soil. 2. Increased aluminum in streams and lakes: As a consequence of enhanced leaching, the concentration of aluminum in streams and lakes would also increase. High concentrations of aluminum can be toxic to aquatic organisms, including fish, leading to a decline in biodiversity and affecting the entire aquatic ecosystem. 3. Greater loss of minerals and nutrients: The increased presence of acid rain would lead to the dissolution of more minerals and nutrients in the soil, washing them away before plants can absorb and benefit from them. This would lead to reduced plant growth and productivity, as well as decreased soil fertility. 4. Lower pH in soil and water: The higher amounts of acid rain would cause a more significant drop in the pH of both soil and water. Lower pH levels can be harmful to plants and animals, as they may not be able to tolerate the acidic conditions. This could lead to the death of plants, invertebrates, and other sensitive species. 5. Stripping of foliage at higher elevations: Higher concentrations of acid rain in fog in mountainous regions can cause even more severe damage to vegetation. The acid droplets in fog can strip foliage off trees, leading to reduced growth, susceptibility to pests and pathogens, and eventual tree death. In summary, the perturbation hypothesis with a stronger fuel type would likely lead to more aluminum being taken from the soil and cause further adverse effects on ecosystems due to higher acidity levels from increased acid rain. The perturbation would have a direct effect on the process, leading to amplified negative consequences in affected areas."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant. You will be given a task.

Please tell me if those questions are the same.  + no.  + yes.","output":"Yes, both questions are essentially the same. They both inquire about the effects of banning 500 and 1000 rupee notes on the Indian economy. Now let's discuss the effects of this ban in detail: On November 8, 2016, the Indian government, led by Prime Minister Narendra Modi, announced the demonetization of 500 and 1000 rupee notes. This action was taken with the primary goal of curbing corruption, black money, tax evasion, and counterfeit currency. The decision had a significant impact on various aspects of the economy. 1. Cash-based businesses and industries: The sudden withdrawal of high-denomination currency notes led to a significant cash crunch in the economy. Businesses and industries that primarily operated on a cash basis, such as real estate, gold and jewelry, retail, and unorganized sectors, were negatively impacted due to the sudden liquidity shortage. 2. Banking Sector: Banks experienced a surge in deposits as people rushed to exchange their old notes for new ones. This led to increased liquidity within the banking system, enabling banks to reduce lending rates. However, the initial days following the announcement witnessed longer queues, chaos, and a spike in transaction charges pertaining to ATM usage and online transactions. 3. Inflation and GDP: In the short term, demonetization led to a decrease in consumer spending, as people faced difficulties making daily transactions with limited access to the new currency. This reduced demand resulted in a temporary decrease in inflation but also impacted India's GDP, witnessing a slowdown in the growth rate. 4. Tax Compliance: Demonetization improved tax compliance by incentivizing the use of digital payments and making it difficult for individuals and businesses to evade taxes. It resulted in an increased number of income tax return filings and a wider tax base, promoting transparency and accountability in the economy. 5. Effect on Counterfeit Currency: Banning the 500 and 1000 rupee notes helped curb the circulation of counterfeit currency, as the new notes introduced enhanced security features that were difficult to replicate. This directly impacted terror funding and other illegal activities financed through counterfeit currency. 6. Digitalization and Financial Inclusion: To counter the cash shortage, the government heavily pushed for digital payments, promoting cashless transactions through the use of banking cards, mobile wallets, and other digital platforms. This accelerated the adoption of digital payment systems, enhancing financial inclusion, and increasing the use of formal banking channels. 7. Influence on the Parallel Economy: The immediate effect of demonetization was a significant crackdown on the parallel or black economy. The ban on high-denomination notes forced those holding unaccounted cash to either declare it and face penalties or lose its value. This move, to some extent, curtailed the black market and reinforced the formal economy. In conclusion, the ban on 500 and 1000 rupee notes in India had multiple effects on the economy. While it did negatively impact some sectors and caused temporary inconvenience to the public, the long-term benefits included improved tax compliance, reduced counterfeit currency circulation, increased digitalization, and a consolidation of the formal economy. The overall impact of demonetization is a multifaceted and complex subject, with both pros and cons that continue to be debated among policymakers and economists."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant that follows instruction extremely well.

Write an article based on this summary: Opposition parties have questioned why an investment deal worth up to £10bn signed by Scotland's first minister and a Chinese consortium was \\"kept quiet\\". Article:","output":"Title: Scotland's First Minister Faces Scrutiny Over Hushed £10bn Investment Deal with Chinese Consortium Introduction Scotland's first minister, Nicola Sturgeon, has come under scrutiny from opposition parties as details emerge concerning a potentially massive investment deal worth up to £10bn, signed with a Chinese consortium. Critics argue that the deal, which has the potential to significantly boost Scotland's economy, has been intentionally \\"kept quiet.\\" As the controversy grows, questions are being raised about transparency in the Scottish government and the nature of the deal itself. Background A two-year-old memorandum of understanding (MoU) between the Scottish government and a consortium comprising two major Chinese companies - SinoFortone and China Railway No.3 Engineering Group – was recently discovered by the media. The document outlines potential investments in a range of sectors including infrastructure, transportation, and renewable energy, all with the aim of fostering economic growth in Scotland. The two Chinese companies involved in the consortium are significant entities in their home country. SinoFortone is a major investor which specializes in infrastructure projects, while China Railway No.3 Engineering Group is one of the largest construction and engineering firms in China. Their combined expertise and financial resources can undoubtedly make a substantial impact on Scotland's economy and facilitate much-needed development. Controversy Over the Quiet Deal Despite the potential benefits of the deal, controversy has arisen primarily due to its lack of publicity. Opposition parties have expressed concern regarding the seemingly secretive nature of the agreement. They argue that such a significant deal, potentially involving vast sums of money and consequential development projects, should have been made public to ensure transparency and accountability. The lack of information and public consultation about the deal has fueled speculation and concern. Some fear that the agreement may be tilted in favor of the Chinese consortium, potentially jeopardizing national interests. Additionally, there are concerns about the environmental and social implications of the projects resulting from the deal, which remain unclear due to the lack of available information. Government's Defense In response to the criticism, the Scottish government has defended its actions, stating that it did not attempt to hide the deal. A government spokesperson stated that the MoU was publicly available in the Scottish Parliament's information center but acknowledged that the government did not actively seek to publicize it. The Scottish government maintains that the MoU merely represents a starting point for establishing and building relationships for potential future collaborations, and does not guarantee any specific projects or investments. Furthermore, the government insists that any project emerging from the deal would be subject to the necessary transparency, scrutiny, and regulatory safeguards. Conclusion As the controversy around the £10bn investment deal continues to unfold, the Scottish government is under increasing pressure to provide greater information and transparency. The potential for the deal to have a significant impact on Scotland's economy cannot be denied; however, the process by which it has been approached calls into question the government's commitment to openness and accountability. With both the potential benefits and risks associated with the secretive nature of this agreement, the issue has underscored the need for transparency and public consultation in such major deals. Failure to meet these expectations may not only damage the credibility of the Scottish government but also undermine the long-term potential of the investment agreement itself."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Please answer the following question: Q: The timing of events in what cycle - which lasts just minutes in fruit fly embryos - is controlled by mechanisms that are both internal and external to the cell?    Choices:  - circadian cycle  - carbon cycle  - life cycle  - cell cycle  A: Answer:","output":"The timing of events in the cell cycle, which lasts just minutes in fruit fly embryos, is controlled by mechanisms that are both internal and external to the cell. The cell cycle is a series of stages that a cell goes through in order to divide and produce new cells. It is crucial for the growth, development, and maintenance of all living organisms. In fruit fly embryos, the cell cycle is particularly rapid, taking only a few minutes to complete. However, despite this rapid pace, the events within the cell cycle must be carefully regulated for the organism to develop properly. This regulation involves a complex interplay between internal and external cellular mechanisms.  Internal mechanisms, or cell-autonomous mechanisms, refer to the processes within a cell that govern the progression of the cell cycle. These mechanisms rely on a complex network of proteins and enzymes that interact with each other to ensure proper timing and coordination of cell division events. One internal regulation system is the molecular checkpoint system. This system uses protein complexes to monitor critical events such as DNA replication, chromosome segregation, and other processes that need to be completed before the cell moves on to the next phase of the cycle. For instance, the G1 checkpoint ensures that the cell has adequate energy and resources before proceeding to DNA synthesis (S phase), while the G2 checkpoint ensures that DNA replication is complete before initiating cell division (mitosis). External mechanisms, or cell-non-autonomous mechanisms, involve factors outside the cell that can impact cell cycle progression. These external factors are often mediated through cell signaling pathways. Signaling molecules, such as growth factors, are essential for coordinating cell growth and division across different cells in developing tissues. In the case of fruit fly embryos, external mechanisms might include signals from neighboring cells or tissues, as well as environmental factors that influence cell division and differentiation. For example, one well-studied signaling pathway in fruit flies is the Notch signaling pathway, which plays a crucial role in cell-fate determination and tissue organization. In conclusion, the rapid cell cycle observed in fruit fly embryos depends on the intricate balance between internal and external mechanisms that work together to regulate the timing of events within the cycle. Both cell-autonomous and cell-non-autonomous processes collaborate to ensure proper cell division, coordination, and overall development of the organism. While all the possible choices (i.e., circadian cycle, carbon cycle, life cycle) play a vital role in biological systems, it is the cell cycle that specifically addresses the question's context of timing and cellular regulatory mechanisms."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

I am verifying the answers generated by an automatic system to the following question: what is an irregular heartbeat pvc Suggested answer: In a PVC, the ventricles contract first and before the atria have optimally filled the ventricles with blood, which means that circulation is inefficient. Should I validate this answer?","output":"Step 1: Understand the question and the provided answer Before validating the answer, it's essential to comprehend the question asked. The question is about \\"irregular heartbeat PVC.\\" PVC stands for Premature Ventricular Contraction, which is a type of irregular heartbeat. The provided answer describes an aspect of PVC where the ventricles contract before they are fully filled with blood by the atria. Step 2: Verify the accuracy of the information To validate the answer, I will check if the information in the response aligns with reputable sources. According to the American Heart Association, PVCs occur when ventricular contractions happen early, causing heartbeats to be out-of-sync. This causes the ventricles not to be filled with blood properly, which agrees with the provided answer. Step 3: Determine if the answer is comprehensive To be comprehensive, the answer should cover the essential aspects and accurately describe PVC. The given answer effectively explains how PVCs cause an inefficient circulation due to early ventricular contractions. However, the answer could be improved by also mentioning that PVCs are typically not harmful for healthy individuals but could be concerning for those with heart issues. Step 4: Validate the answer Based on my analysis, the provided answer is correct but could be more comprehensive. You can validate the answer if your intention is to confirm the correctness. However, you may consider adding more context to make the answer more comprehensive. For example: \\"In a PVC, the ventricles contract first and before the atria have optimally filled the ventricles with blood, which means that circulation is inefficient. Generally, PVCs are not harmful for healthy individuals, but they can be a cause for concern in those with underlying heart issues.\\""},{"instruction":"Explain how you used the definition to come up with the answer.

Kevin Jeffrey Clash (born September 17, 1960) is an American puppeteer, director and producer whose characters include Elmo, Clifford, Benny Rabbit, and Hoots the Owl. Clash developed an interest in puppetry at an early age and began performing for local TV children's shows in his hometown of Baltimore, Maryland, as a teenager. In the early 1980s, he began working in Captain Kangaroo and began performing in Sesame Street in 1984. He was the fifth puppeteer to perform Elmo, the character he became the most famous for and became an executive producer and director for the show. Captain Kangaroo was cancelled in 1984 after 29 seasons, and Great Space Coaster ended, freeing up Clash to work on projects with Henson such as the film Labyrinth and Sesame Street. Clash started working at Sesame Street for ten episodes in 1983, mostly performing nondescript, stand-in puppets known as Anything Muppets. Some of his earliest characters included the saxophone-playing Hoots the Owl (based on Louis Armstrong), the infant Baby Natasha, and inventor Dr. Nobel Price. After 1985, Elmo, a furry red monster, became his main character. Four puppeteers, including Richard Hunt, had performed Elmo previously, but it was Clash's development, with a falsetto voice, that established the character. He based Elmo's character on the preschool children that attended his mother's daycare in Baltimore and upon his own personality and the personality of his parents. Clash followed the advice of fellow puppeteer Frank Oz, who told Clash to always \\"find one special hook\\" for each character. Clash decided that the central characteristic for Elmo should be that he \\"should represent love\\".  After the height of Elmo's popularity, especially the \\"Tickle Me Elmo\\" craze in 1996, Clash's responsibilities at Sesame Street increased. He recruited, auditioned, and trained its puppeteers, and became the senior Muppet coordinator, a writer, director, and co-producer of the \\"Elmo's World\\" segment of the show. Clash worked with and mentored the puppeteers of Sesame Street's international co-productions. He found working with the co-productions \\"a lot of fun\\" and \\"very rewarding\\". He worked on the 1985 feature film Follow That Bird. In 2007, he was promoted to senior creative adviser for the Sesame Workshop. Until 2011, he was the sole performer as Elmo in all his public relations appearances, making his schedule, as he called it, \\"crazy\\". Cheryl Henson, president of the Jim Henson Foundation, called him \\"essential\\" to the show.  Clash worked on the first film version of Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles, in 1990 and the sequel, Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles II: The Secret of the Ooze, which was dedicated to Henson, in 1991, voicing Master Splinter. He performed in several productions with Jim Henson Productions, including as the Muppet Clifford in The Jim Henson Hour (1989), and performing the puppetry for Frank Oz's characters (Miss Piggy, Fozzie Bear, Sam the Eagle, and Animal) in Muppet Treasure Island (1996). Clash performed in the films Muppets from Space (1999) and The Muppets' Wizard of Oz (2005), and the TV series Muppets Tonight (1996--1998), in which he reprised Clifford, who served as the show's host. He performed characters and worked behind the scenes on the sitcom Dinosaurs. In 1999, Clash worked on a film starring Elmo, The Adventures of Elmo in Grouchland.  In 2006, Clash published his autobiography, co-written by Gary Brozek and Louis Henry Mitchell, entitled My Life as a Furry Red Monster: What Being Elmo Has Taught Me About Life, Love and Laughing Out Loud. His life was featured in the 2011 documentary Being Elmo: A Puppeteer's Journey.

This question aims to determine the intelligence level of cats and dogs. Intelligence is a complex and multi-faceted attribute that varies within individuals of the same species. However, studies have suggested that dogs might have a greater capacity for learning and problem-solving compared to cats. This is due to their evolutionary history as hunting and working animals which required advanced social and cognitive skills. Nonetheless, cats are skilled as well, especially in areas related to stealth, agility, and independence. Question 2: Which is better: dog or cat? This question is subjective and depends on individual preferences. Some people might find dogs as better pets due to their loyalty, obedience, and social nature. Others may prefer cats for their low maintenance, independence, and quiet demeanor. The answer to this question largely relies on personal experiences and values. Now let's evaluate the available options: (1). no (2). yes The question asks if the answer to both questions would be the same.

Article: While success is surely sweeter than failure, it seems failure is a far better teacher, and organizations that fail spectacularly often flourish more in the long run, according to a new study by Vinit Desai, assistant professor of management at the University of Colorado Denver Business School. Researchers have found that people missing their goals perform much better in the long run. That is because they gain more knowledge from their failures than their successes and the lessons are more likely to stay longer in their minds. \\"We found that the knowledge gained from success was often fleeting while knowledge from failure stuck around for years,\\" said professor Desai, who led the study. \\"But companies often ignore failure. Managers may fire people or turn over the whole workforce while they should treat the failure as a learning opportunity.\\" Prof Desai compared the flights of the space shuttle Atlantis and the Challenger. During the 2002 Atlantis flight, a piece of insulation   broke off and damaged the left solid rocket booster   but didn't influence the program. There was little investigation. The Challenger was launched next and another piece of insulation broke off. This time the shuttle and its seven-person crew were destroyed. The disaster led to a major investigation resulting in 29 changes to prevent future disasters. The difference in response in the two cases came down to this: Atlantis was considered a success and the Challenger a failure. \\"Despite crowded skies, airlines are extremely reliable,\\" he said. \\"The number of failures is extremely small. And past researches have shown that older airlines, those with more experience in failure, have a lower number of accidents.\\" Prof Desai doesn't recommend finding out failure in order to learn. Instead, he advises organizations to analyze small failures to collect useful information rather than wait for major failures. Question: Fewer accidents happen to older airlines in that   _  .

While we can gather some information from the premise, it is insufficient to confirm or refute the hypothesis directly. Let's discuss this in more detail. In the premise, we learn that the man is admiring art in a museum. This indicates that the museum is open to visitors and has exhibits on display. However, we do not get any information about other visitors or the overall state of the museum.  For the hypothesis that \\"the museum is totally empty and abandoned,\\" it seems to contradict the fact that the man is admiring art in the museum because it suggests that a visitor is present. However, \\"totally empty\\" could potentially be interpreted as empty of other visitors or staff. But even with this interpretation, there is still insufficient information in the premise to confirm or refute this possibility. Additionally, the term \\"abandoned\\" in the hypothesis would typically mean that there is no ongoing maintenance or management in the museum. This would be unlikely in a museum where someone is visiting and admiring art. One could assume that if the museum is open to visitors, it must be functioning to some extent, even if it is not bustling with people. However, the premise does not provide any information regarding the museum's management, maintenance, or overall state. In conclusion, the premise \\"A man is admiring art in a museum\\" does not tell us whether the hypothesis \\"The museum is totally empty and abandoned\\" is true or not. While some aspects of the hypothesis appear to contradict the premise, other aspects could be consistent with it if given a certain interpretation.

Would \\"In 1958 the modern one-piece Cup was designed with a five-band barrel which could contain 13 winning teams per band.\\" be a reasonable answer? Answer:","output":"The process of determining the number of series in hockey before the Stanley Cup can be a bit complicated, as it has changed over the years. However, to answer your question as accurately as possible, we must consider the current format of the NHL playoffs and the historical context of the Stanley Cup. Currently, a total of four playoff series are played before a team is awarded the Stanley Cup. These series are: 1. Division Semifinals: The top four teams from each of the four NHL divisions qualify for the playoffs, and the first round consists of a series of four best-of-seven matches within each division. The first seed faces the fourth seed, while the second and third seeds compete against each other. 2. Division Finals: The two remaining teams in each division face off against each other in another best-of-seven series, with the winners being crowned division champions and moving on to the next round. 3. Conference Finals: The two division champions within each conference (Eastern and Western) then play against each other in a best-of-seven series, with the winner moving on to the Stanley Cup Final. 4. Stanley Cup Final: The Eastern Conference and Western Conference champions compete in a final best-of-seven series, with the winner being awarded the Stanley Cup. Now, regarding the statement \\"In 1958, the modern one-piece Cup was designed with a five-band barrel which could contain 13 winning teams per band,\\" this information refers to the physical design of the Stanley Cup trophy. The original Cup had a base with rings, and each year, the winning team's information was engraved onto one of these rings. The 1958 design change created a larger trophy with additional space for more winners' engravings without significantly altering the iconic look of the Cup. While the statement you provided is accurate in terms of the Cup's design, it does not directly address the number of series played in hockey before the Stanley Cup is awarded. However, understanding how the playoffs are structured and the historical context of the Stanley Cup is essential for appreciating the significance of the trophy and the challenges that teams face on their quest for hockey's ultimate prize."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

If \\"A large group of people have formed a line outside.\\", can we conclude \\"A group of people line up behind the great Cthulhu for a raging party.\\"?","output":"No, we cannot conclude that \\"A group of people line up behind the great Cthulhu for a raging party\\" based solely on the statement \\"A large group of people have formed a line outside.\\" While the first statement describes a group of people lining up outside, it does not provide any information or context to determine the reason for the line or the presence of the great Cthulhu. The statement \\"A large group of people have formed a line outside\\" is a general observation that could apply to various scenarios. It could be that these people are waiting in line for a bus, attending a public event, or queuing for a store opening. There are a multitude of possible reasons that can cause people to form a line, and without additional information, it is impossible to determine their intentions or motivations. The second statement, \\"A group of people line up behind the great Cthulhu for a raging party,\\" is a specific and imaginative scenario involving the fictional cosmic entity created by H.P. Lovecraft. It is important to recognize that Cthulhu is a character from popular literature, rather than an entity that could realistically host a party. Consequently, this statement is more likely to be a creative interpretation or a metaphorical expression than a literal description of the situation. To conclude that the group of people was, in fact, lining up for a party hosted by the great Cthulhu, we would need more information to substantiate the connection between the line and the party. For instance, if there was a known event or gathering themed around the Cthulhu mythos and expected to be a \\"raging party,\\" it might be reasonable to make such an assumption. However, without any context that corroborates the connection, it would be purely speculative. In summary, while both statements describe a group of people forming a line, the reason for their formation cannot be determined from the initial statement alone. Additional information would be needed to link the line outside to the great Cthulhu and a raging party, and without any such context, the two statements cannot be conclusively connected."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

You will be given a task. You must generate a detailed and long answer. Please answer the following question: Here's a question and a few possible answers:   Q: What happens to kids when visiting museums of old dinosaur bones? Possible A: crowding, retrospection, amazement, being bored, excited  Why is \\"amazement\\" an answer aligned with human common sense? Answer:","output":"\\"Amazement\\" is an answer aligned with human common sense for several reasons when considering what happens to kids when they visit museums of old dinosaur bones. Firstly, it is important to understand the factors that contribute to the general appeal of dinosaurs and the context in which children experience them at the museum.  1. Intrigue and fascination: Dinosaurs are a subject of great curiosity and fascination for many people, especially children. Their sheer size, unique appearance, and the fact that they ruled the Earth millions of years ago create an aura of mystery and wonder. When children come face-to-face with actual fossils and bones of these giant creatures, it is a direct encounter with natural history, which often evokes a sense of amazement. 2. Educational experience: Visiting a museum and viewing dinosaur bones offer an educational experience for children by exposing them to new information about the Earth's past, various species, and the evolution of life. The amazement they experience can also inspire further learning, research, and exploration into paleontology, evolution, and other related fields. The connection between amazement and education is aligned with human common sense, as it signifies a deepening of knowledge and understanding. 3. Visual impact: The presentation and aesthetic appeal of dinosaur bones in museums play a significant role in generating amazement among children. The bones are usually arranged and displayed in a manner that showcases their monumental size, intricate details, and the relationships between different species or time periods in an accessible and engaging fashion. The visual impact of these displays can leave children in awe. 4. Imagination and creativity: Encountering dinosaur bones in a museum setting allows children to exercise their imagination and creativity. They can imagine what these creatures looked like, how they behaved, their environment, and the dynamic world they inhabited. This imaginative process is an essential part of fostering cognitive development and is closely tied to the human sense of amazement. 5. Emotional connection: As humans, we are social beings who are often drawn to the stories of others. The story of dinosaurs and their ultimate extinction resonates with people on an emotional level, which can elicit a sense of amazement as we ponder the vastness and complexities of life on our planet. For children, the emotional connection is further enhanced by the depiction of dinosaurs in popular culture, such as movies, games, and books. In conclusion, the answer \\"amazement\\" is aligned with human common sense because it encapsulates the various factors that contribute to the experience of visiting a museum with old dinosaur bones. From fascination and education to imagination and emotional connection, amazement is a natural and intuitive response for children who are exposed to these awe-inspiring exhibits that offer unique insights into our planet's history and the magnificent creatures that once roamed Earth."},{"instruction":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation. Think like you are answering to a five year old. Math problem: Solve -2815*f + 13524 = -3781*f for f. What is the solution?","output":"Okay, little buddy! Let's solve this math problem together. We want to find out what \\"f\\" is. Here's the problem: -2815*f + 13524 = -3781*f First, let's add 2815*f to both sides of the equation to move all \\"f\\" terms to one side. We do this by changing the -2815*f to a positive 2815*f: -2815*f + 2815*f + 13524 = -3781*f + 2815*f Now, on the left side, -2815*f and 2815*f cancel each other out, so we have: 13524 = -3781*f + 2815*f Next, let's combine the \\"f\\" terms on the right side: 13524 = (-3781 + 2815)*f Now we find the result of -3781 + 2815: 13524 = -966*f Finally, let's find out what \\"f\\" is by dividing both sides by -966: 13524 ÷ -966 = -966*f ÷ -966 It simplifies to: f = -14 So, the solution for \\"f\\" is -14.

Plot title: Under Siege 2: Dark Territory Movie plot: Casey Ryback has retired from the United States Navy and is a chef at the Mile High Cafe in Denver, Colorado. Casey is taking his estranged niece Sarah to Los Angeles to visit the grave of Sarah's father. Sarah and Casey board the Grand Continental, a train traveling from Denver to Los Angeles through the Rocky Mountains. Armed mercenaries, led by former U.S. government computer hacker and computer genius Travis Dane and mercenary leader Marcus Penn, hijack the train. Dane worked on Grazer One, a top-secret military satellite particle weapon designed to destroy underground targets. The military fired Dane because of his mental instability; Dane later faked his suicide. The mercenaries take the train's passengers and staff hostage, herding them into the last two cars. Casey kills one mercenary, then slips away. Among the hostages are two former Department of Defense colleagues who worked with Dane. Dane threatens them with torture unless they reveal the codes to take over Grazer. Despite giving up the codes, they are thrown from the train into a deep valley and killed. Middle Eastern terrorists have offered Dane 1 billion to destroy the Eastern seaboard by using Grazer to target a nuclear reactor located under the Pentagon. Dane demonstrates Grazer to investors by destroying a Chinese chemical weapons plant. After one investor offers an additional 100 million, Dane destroys an airliner carrying the investor's ex-wife. The U.S. government has difficulty locating Dane or Grazer. When officials destroy what they think is Grazer, Dane explains the NSA's premier intelligence satellite was destroyed instead.

First, we will create a table to store the lengths of LCS up to the current elements in both lists, and then we will use that table to reconstruct the LCS. Below are the steps to achieve this: 1. Create a table \`dp_table\` of dimensions (n+1) x (m+1), where n is the length of list A, and m is the length of list B. Initialize all elements in the table to 0. 2. Iterate through the elements in both lists A and B. If the current elements in both lists are the same, then set \`dp_table[i+1][j+1] = dp_table[i][j] + 1\`, otherwise set \`dp_table[i+1][j+1] = max(dp_table[i+1][j], dp_table[i][j+1])\`. 3. After populating the \`dp_table\`, iterate through it in reverse order to reconstruct the LCS. If the current element is the same in both lists, add it to the LCS and move diagonally up and left.

What is the best way to: Make jar labels easier to remove.","output":"The best way to make jar labels easier to remove involves using various techniques and materials to loosen the adhesive bond between the label and the jar surface. You often have to deal with stubborn labels on jars that may need repurposing, recycling, or simply cleaning. To simplify this task, follow these step-by-step instructions using different methods that work best for you: 1. Warm soapy water method: a. Fill a sink or basin with warm water and add a few drops of dish soap. b. Immerse the jar completely, ensuring that the label is submerged in water. Let it soak for 30 minutes to an hour. c. Remove the jar and use a sponge or a cloth to gently rub off the label. The warm soapy water should have loosened the adhesive, making it easier to remove.  d. If the label doesn't come off in one piece, repeat the soaking process.  e. Once the label is removed, clean off any residue with a sponge or cloth. 2. Heat application: a. Using a hair dryer, apply heat directly to the label for 30-60 seconds. Keep the hair dryer 2-4 inches away from the jar surface. b. The heat will loosen the adhesive, allowing you to peel off the label with your fingers or a plastic scraper. c. If the label doesn't come off entirely, reapply heat and continue scraping gently.  d. After the label is removed, clean the remaining adhesive residue with warm soapy water or rubbing alcohol. 3. Vinegar or rubbing alcohol method: a. Moisten a cloth or paper towel with white vinegar or rubbing alcohol.  b. Place the moistened cloth on the label, ensuring that it covers the entire area. c. Let it sit for 10-15 minutes, allowing the vinegar or rubbing alcohol to dissolve the adhesive. d. Gently remove the label with a sponge, cloth, or plastic scraper.  e. Clean the remaining adhesive residue with a damp cloth and soapy water or rubbing alcohol. 4. Oils (cooking oil, baby oil, or Goo Gone): a. Apply a small amount of oil to a cloth or paper towel. b. Rub the oil onto the label, covering the entire surface. c. Let it sit for 10-15 minutes, allowing the oil to penetrate and loosen the adhesive. d. Gently peel off the label with your fingers or a plastic scraper. e. Clean the remaining adhesive residue with a cloth and warm soapy water or rubbing alcohol. 5. Freezing method (works best for self-adhesive labels): a. Place the jar in the freezer for at least an hour. b. After an hour, remove the jar and try peeling off the label immediately. The adhesive should become brittle and easier to remove when it's frozen. c. If necessary, use a plastic scraper to gently lift the label. d. Clean off any residual adhesive with a cloth and warm soapy water or rubbing alcohol. Remember to avoid using sharp objects like knives, as they may damage the jar surface or cause accidents. Choosing the most effective method will depend on the type and strength of adhesive used on the label.

Question: Why caused the saucepan to explode ?","output":"To determine the cause of the saucepan explosion, let's examine the sequence of events you described step by step and hypothesize why it happened: 1. You left the green beans cooking too long: This may have led to the green beans burning and producing smoke. Prolonged heating can cause the temperature inside the saucepan to rise significantly. 2. The buildup of heat and pressure: As the green beans continue to cook while giving off smoke, there could be a buildup of steam and pressure inside the saucepan. The lid, being tightly sealed, could be preventing this excess heat and pressure from escaping. 3. The glass lid shatters: With the increasing pressure and temperature inside the saucepan, the glass material of the lid is subjected to both thermal and mechanical stresses. If the lid is not made of heat-resistant or tempered glass, it may not be able to withstand these stresses. Based on these steps, we propose that the saucepan's glass lid exploded due to the buildup of heat and pressure inside the saucepan, caused by the prolonged cooking of the green beans.

Explicând în detaliu, am ales să susțin această măsură deoarece fondurile puse la dispoziție prin Fondul European de Ajustare la Globalizare (EGF) pot oferi o mână de ajutor esențială pentru angajații afectați de schimbările socio-economice din cadrul pieței muncii. Acest fond, înființat în 2006 de către Comisia Europeană, are drept scop să sprijine lucrătorii care au pierdut locurile de muncă datorită globalizării și evoluțiilor structurale ale economiei mondiale. Cazurile Belgiei și Irlandei reflectă dificultățile pe care le întâmpină angajații din aceste țări din cauza globalizării și a crizei economice și financiare.

These scientists are increasingly concerned about the potential long-term effects of global warming on our natural environment and on the planet. Of particular concern is how climate change and global warming caused by anthropogenic, or human-made releases of greenhouse gases, most notably carbon dioxide, can act interactively, and have adverse effects upon the planet, its natural environment and humans' existence. It is clear the planet is warming, and warming rapidly. This is due to the greenhouse effect, which is caused by greenhouse gases, which trap heat inside the Earth's atmosphere because of their more complex molecular structure which allows them to vibrate and in turn trap heat and release it back towards the Earth. This warming is also responsible for the extinction of natural habitats, which in turn leads to a reduction in wildlife population.The most recent report from the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (the group of the leading climate scientists in the world) concluded that the earth will warm anywhere from 2.7 to almost 11 degrees Fahrenheit (1.5 to 6 degrees Celsius) between 1990 and 2100.  and the situation: Jessica and Milly are two politicians currently in the running for governor of their city. They are in the process of having a debate that is being broadcast on local television. Mike, an avid environmentalist who is trying to decide who to vote for, has been watching the entire debate. He feels the most important issue when voting is saving the planet and the animals on it. The question that was just asked by the moderator was \\"what do you think should be done with the Earth's atmosphere?\\" Jessica responds that she thinks we should emit more anthropogenic gases. She believes that will lead to the best outcome for the world. Milly states that we need to decrease the amount of carbon dioxide and other gases in the atmosphere.  Answer the following question: Will the number of animals increase or decrease under Milly's plan? The answer to this question is:","output":"The number of animals is likely to increase, or at least be better preserved, under Milly's plan. By advocating for a decrease in carbon dioxide and other greenhouse gas emissions, Milly is promoting a plan that addresses the issue of global warming and climate change, which is responsible for the extinction of natural habitats and reduction in wildlife population. Therefore, her plan would be more effective in protecting and preserving the ecosystem and animal species."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant. User will you give you a task.

Which is this about? This is the time of the year when Americans nationwide are gobbling up gobblers at grocery stores for holiday dinners. But out on Darrell French #39;s","output":"ranch in southwestern North Dakota, the gobblers aren't just found in the meat aisle – they're roaming the countryside and flourishing in their natural environment. Darrell French's ranch is a haven for these magnificent birds, and it provides an ideal setting to delve deeper into the life of wild turkeys and the rich American tradition of hunting and consuming them, especially during the holiday season. Wild turkeys, unlike their domesticated counterparts, are much more agile and have a more diverse diet. Unlike domesticated turkeys, which are often bred for their breast size and weight, wild turkeys have a more balanced proportion of white and dark meat. As a result, their meat has a richer, more nuanced flavor and is a delicacy among many Americans. During the holiday season, demand for turkey meat skyrockets as families gather together to celebrate and enjoy traditional dishes such as roasted turkey, stuffing, and cranberry sauce. Many people take this opportunity to purchase fresh, free-range turkey meat from local farms and ranches, such as Darrell French's. The appeal of these locally sourced birds lies in their improved taste, texture, and overall quality compared to mass-produced supermarket turkeys. At Darrell French's ranch, the turkeys roam freely and engage in their natural behaviors. They can forage for their preferred diet, which consists of wild berries, seeds, insects, and grasses. This type of diet contributes to the unique flavor of their meat, which is praised for its gamey taste. Additionally, the turkeys have a healthy lifestyle and adequate exercise due to their freedom to roam, which also helps their muscles develop naturally, giving the meat a firmer texture. Moreover, wild turkeys play a significant role in the ecosystem. They help disperse seeds and control insect populations, promoting biodiversity. Furthermore, they serve as prey for species such as coyotes, foxes, and birds of prey, helping to maintain a balance in the food chain. Turkey hunting is another deep-rooted American tradition, particularly during the fall season. Hunters, like those who frequent Darrell French's ranch, play a critical role in controlling turkey populations and preventing overpopulation. This sustainable form of hunting helps maintain a healthy balance between the turkey population and the surrounding ecosystems. Darrell French's ranch represents an ideal model of responsible wildlife management and agriculture.

Choose the next sentence.The 'confessed killer' of the murdered Miss Honduras beauty queen smiled chillingly into the camera on his way to the cells last night, as his victims' grieving mother warned that the suspect's family will try to buy his freedom. Teresa Muñoz told MailOnline she feared that Plutarco Antonio Ruiz, detained for the murders of Maria Jose and Sofia Alvarado, will never be brought to justice in a country where corruption is rampant. The bodies of the two sisters were found buried in a river bank near the spa where they had disappeared a week earlier. Police believe Sofia's boyfriend Ruiz shot her in the head in a jealous rage, before shooting Maria Jose twice in the back. They say he has confessed to the deaths. But she believes that OPTIONS: - Aris Maldonado's status as a model and beauty queen is the only reason the deaths are being taken seriously. - Elizabeth Alvarado's status as a model and beauty queen is the only reason the deaths are being taken seriously. - Honduras's status as a model and beauty queen is the only reason the deaths are being taken seriously. - MailOnline's status as a model and beauty queen is the only reason the deaths are being taken seriously. - Maria Jose's status as a model and beauty queen is the only reason the deaths are being taken seriously. - Plutarco Antonio Ruiz's status as a model and beauty queen is the only reason the deaths are being taken seriously. - Ruiz's status as a model and beauty queen is the only reason the deaths are being taken seriously. - Sofia's status as a model and beauty queen is the only reason the deaths are being taken seriously. - Sofia Alvarado's status as a model and beauty queen is the only reason the deaths are being taken seriously. - Teresa Muñoz's status as a model and beauty queen is the only reason the deaths are being taken seriously. - Ventura Diaz's status as a model and beauty queen is the only reason the deaths are being taken seriously.","output":"- Maria Jose's status as a model and beauty queen is the only reason the deaths are being taken seriously. - Sofia Alvarado's status as a model and beauty queen is the only reason the deaths are being taken seriously.

Therefore, it would make sense that the importance given to their deaths is due to their stature as models and beauty queens.

It is important to note that Georgia here refers to a town in Vermont, and not the U.S. state of Georgia. 3. Occupation/Positions held: Alvah Sabin held two prominent roles in his career:    a. Secretary of the State of Vermont: He worked as the secretary for the government of the state of Vermont;    b. Representation of Vermont's Third Congressional District: Additionally, Alvah Sabin represented the state's third Congressional District, which means he served as a member of Congress for that area. 4.

In this context, the statement suggests that the Commission's aspirations to enhance the integration and regulation of financial markets should not be examined in isolation. Instead, a comprehensive evaluation should take into account all potential consequences and implications associated with these goals. This involves analyzing the possible ramifications of proposed regulations, examining the different scenarios that may emerge, and ensuring a proper and robust surveillance mechanism is in place to monitor the situation effectively.

To the tourist, things look back to normal. Yet as the state's junior U.S. senator lamented in February, \\"I can tell you right now Nevada is nowhere close to a normal economy.\\" Nevada's unemployment remains the second-highest in the nation, nearly 9%. The housing market there still languishes. New Federal Reserve Chair Janet Yellen acknowledged to Nevada Republican Sen. Dean Heller that full recovery for Nevada glimmers \\"years away.\\" Nevada's troubles are more than a local concern. They reveal something important about the condition of the whole U.S. economy. As more states legalized casinos, the OPTIONS: - CNN casino industry -- and especially the Las Vegas industry -- responded by moving up-market. - David Frum casino industry -- and especially the Las Vegas industry -- responded by moving up-market. - Dean Heller casino industry -- and especially the Las Vegas industry -- responded by moving up-market. - Frum casino industry -- and especially the Las Vegas industry -- responded by moving up-market. - Janet Yellen casino industry -- and especially the Las Vegas industry -- responded by moving up-market. - Las Vegas casino industry -- and especially the Las Vegas industry -- responded by moving up-market. - Nevada casino industry -- and especially the Las Vegas industry -- responded by moving up-market. - Republican casino industry -- and especially the Las Vegas industry -- responded by moving up-market. - U.S. casino industry -- and especially the Las Vegas industry -- responded by moving up-market.","output":"As more states legalized casinos, the Nevada casino industry -- and especially the Las Vegas industry -- responded by moving up-market. This meant an increased focus on luxury offerings, from five-star dining establishments to high-end retail outlets and cutting-edge entertainment options, in an effort to attract visitors with more disposable income. With competition on the rise, the aim was to provide an all-encompassing, unique entertainment experience that went beyond the traditional gaming-centric model. However, this upscale move also signifies a certain desperation on the part of the Nevada gaming industry. As the allure of gambling diminishes across the U.S and more states are opening their doors to casinos, it becomes less of an exclusive activity that you could only do in places like Las Vegas. This has led to casinos looking for other ways, such as becoming a high-end tourist destination, to maintain their revenue.  Yet, even this solution is proving not to be sufficient for a full economic recovery. As the state's junior U.S. senator highlighted, Nevada is still grappling with significantly high unemployment rates and a sluggish housing market, a scenario that Federal Reserve Chair Janet Yellen acknowledges will potentially take years to overturn.  The situation in Nevada, particularly that of Las Vegas, is indicative of wider issues in the U.S. economy. Despite apparent markers of success - crowded casinos, sold-out shows - there exist undercurrents of economic instability. This suggests that the health of the U.S economy might not be as robust as surface indicators might imply, but rather nuanced, thereby requiring multi-faceted solutions for sustainable growth and recovery. It is a strong reminder that economic progress can’t just be viewed on the surface level, but requires deeper analysis and understanding."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant that follows instruction extremely well.

Please answer the following question: This article: \\"Single Ladies (Put a Ring on It)\\" was written by Beyoncé, Terius \\"The-Dream\\" Nash, Thaddis \\"Kuk\\" Harrell, and Christopher \\"Tricky\\" Stewart, and was produced by Nash and Stewart. Beyoncé recorded the song in May 2008 at the Boom Boom Room Studio in Burbank, California, and it was mixed by Jaycen Joshua and Dave Pensado, with assistance from Randy Urbanski and Andrew Wuepper. Nash conceptualized \\"Single Ladies\\" after Beyoncé's secret marriage to hip hop recording artist Jay-Z in April 2008. Stewart commented that the song was \\"the only public statement that [Beyoncé and Jay-Z had] ever made about marriage\\", and that while in the studio recording the song Beyoncé had remained tightlipped, even to the point of removing her wedding band. Beyoncé's marriage inspired Nash to compose a song about an issue that affected many people's relationships: the fear or unwillingness of men to commit. In an interview with Billboard magazine, Beyoncé added that she was drawn to the song because of the universality of the topic, an issue that \\"people are passionate about and want to talk about and debate\\". She stated that although \\"Single Ladies\\" is a playful uptempo song, it addresses an issue that women experience every day.In \\"Single Ladies\\", Beyoncé portrays her alter ego Sasha Fierce, which appears on the second part of I Am... Sasha Fierce. The song was released simultaneously with \\"If I Were a Boy\\"; as lead singles, they were meant to demonstrate the concept of the dueling personalities of the singer. This reinforced the theme of the album, which was created by placing its ballads and uptempo tracks on separate discs. The singles debuted on US radio on October 8, 2008; \\"Single Ladies\\" did so on mainstream urban New York radio station Power 105.1. Both singles were added to rhythmic contemporary radio playlists on October 12, 2008; \\"Single Ladies\\" was sent to urban contemporary playlists the same day, while \\"If I Were a Boy\\" was instead classified for contemporary hit radio.

How is \\"You.\\" said in Czech?","output":"In Czech, \\"You.\\" is translated as \\"Ty.\\" The Czech language, like many other Slavic languages, distinguishes between formal and informal pronouns for addressing people. \\"Ty\\" is singular and informal, used when addressing someone you know well, like a close friend, a family member, or someone younger than you. When addressing someone formally or someone you don't have a close relationship with, you would use \\"Vy,\\" which signifies politeness and respect. This is typically used in professional settings, when speaking to strangers, or those who hold a higher position or status. Furthermore, Czech is an inflected language, which means the endings of words change depending on their grammatical function in a sentence. This may result in a slight variation of the pronoun \\"Ty\\" in different contexts. For example: Nominative (Subject of the sentence): Ty Accusative (Direct object of the sentence): Tě or Tebe Dative (Indirect object of the sentence): Tobě Genitive (Showing possession): Tvůj (masculine), Tvoje (neuter), Tvá (feminine) Instrumental (Used with prepositions): S tebou Prepositional (Used with prepositions): O tobě These variations should be considered when forming sentences in Czech to express the appropriate meaning and maintain grammatical correctness.

We have the equation: 2107*u - 136 = 2124*u Think of 'u' as the number of candies you have. Step 1. Our goal is to find out how many candies ('u') you have. To do that, we need to have all the candies on one side of the equation. So, we'll move the 2107 candies next to the 2124 candies. To do that, we'll subtract 2107 candies from both sides: 2107*u - 2107*u - 136 = 2124*u - 2107*u This simplifies to: -136 = 17*u Step 2. Now, we have -136 = 17 * candies (u).

In the past, few members of the Church of England would have seen any incongruity in concurrently adhering to Anglican Christianity and practicing Freemasonry. In recent decades, however, reservations about Freemasonry have increased within Anglicanism, perhaps due to the increasing prominence of the evangelical wing of the church. The former Archbishop of Canterbury, Dr Rowan Williams, appeared to harbour some reservations about Masonic ritual, whilst being anxious to avoid causing offence to Freemasons inside and outside the Church of England. In 2003 he felt it necessary to apologise to British Freemasons after he said that their beliefs were incompatible with Christianity and that he had barred the appointment of Freemasons to senior posts in his diocese when he was Bishop of Monmouth.

What might be the first step of the process? A:","output":"The first step of the process in a dishwasher, as described above, begins with the heating element that heats the water. This is a crucial initial step, as it helps to ensure that the water is at the right temperature to effectively clean the dishes and break down any grease or stubborn food particles.  In most dishwashers, this process starts when the user selects a cleaning cycle and initiates the dishwasher's operation. The heating element located at the bottom of the dishwasher begins to heat up, increasing the water temperature to the level necessary for the selected cycle (usually between 120°F to 160°F / 49°C to 71°C). This higher temperature not only aids in the removal of dirt and food particles on the dishes but also helps to kill harmful bacteria and sanitize the dishes. Heating the water is a critical step as it prepares the dishwasher for the subsequent phases of cleaning and ensures that the dishes will be cleaned most effectively. The heated water is then ready for the next stage in the process, which involves the pump forcing the water upward through the pipes connected to the spinning paddles. The forced water pressure will cause the paddles to spin, mimicking the action of a sprinkler and ensuring that the dishes receive a thorough, even cleaning."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Complete the following sentence. they had a big struggle to fit the shoes into the sacks, the","output":"The main issue they faced was that the shoes were small in comparison to the sacks that were available for use. The problem seemed insurmountable at first because there was a significant difference in the sizes of the shoes and the sacks, which made it incredibly difficult for them to adequately fit the shoes into the sacks without wasting a lot of space or risking damage to the shoes. They had a big struggle to fit the shoes into the sacks, primarily due to the disproportionality between the sizes of the two items. The shoes, while small and delicate, needed to be stored securely and without being crushed or deformed during transport or storage. The sacks, on the other hand, were meant to carry larger and bulkier items, making them ill-suited for the job at hand. There were several potential solutions that they considered to address this issue: 1. Using padding or cushioning materials within the sacks, such as bubble wrap, foam, or tissue paper, to fill the extra space and protect the shoes from damage. This would allow them to use the spacious sacks while preventing the shoes from moving around too much and possibly getting damaged. 2. Replacing the oversized sacks with smaller sacks or bags that were specifically designed for shoes. This would eliminate the need for any additional filling material and would ensure a snug fit for all pairs of shoes, regardless of their size. 3. Creating customized sacks or compartments within the larger sacks to hold the shoes. This could be achieved by sewing or attaching separate compartments within the sack to accommodate each pair of shoes, thereby reducing the amount of available space, maintaining the structural integrity of the shoes, and ensuring that they remain secured during transport or storage. 4. Utilizing a stacking method and organizing the shoes strategically within the sacks to maximize the use of space. By carefully arranging the shoes in a manner that would reduce the amount of empty space between them, they could potentially consolidate a considerable number of shoes within one sack, making the overall process more efficient and less cumbersome. In the end, they might decide to employ a combination of these strategies to overcome the challenge of fitting the small shoes into the significantly larger sacks. By either adapting the sacks themselves, seeking out alternative storage solutions, or carefully arranging the shoes in a precise manner, they would be able to surmount this hurdle and achieve their goal of securely storing and transporting the shoes without compromising their integrity or functionality."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Article: My neighbor Mrs. Gargan first told me about it. \\"Have you seen the tree?\\" She asked as I was sitting in the backyard enjoying the autumn twilight  . \\"The one down at the corner,\\" she explained. \\"It's a beautiful tree--all kinds of colors. All the passers-by stop to have a look. You ought to see it.\\" I told her I would, but I soon forgot about the tree. Three days later, I was jogging down the street when a splash of bright orange caught my eyes. For an instant, I thought someone's house had caught fire. Then I remembered the tree. I approached the tree to look at it closely. There was nothing remarkable about the shape of the tree. It was a medium-sized maple. But Mrs. Gargan had been right about its colors. Like the mess of an artist's palette , the tree blazed a bright crimson on its lower branches and burned with vivid yellows and oranges in its center, and deep red at its top. Through these colors were light green leaves as yet untouched by autumn. Walking closer I noticed several bare branches near the top, their small black branches scratching the air like claws. The fallen leaves lay like a red carpet around the trunk. As I was amazed at this beauty, I thought of Ralph Waldo Emerson's comments about the stars. \\"If the constellations appeared only once in a thousand years, imagine what an exciting event it would be. But because they're up there every night, we barely give them a look,\\" he made a remark in Nature. I felt the same way about the tree. Because its beauty will last only a week, it should be especially precious to us. And I had almost missed it. Once in the 19th century when a man noticed a brilliant display of northern lights in the sky over Massachusetts, he rang a church bell to alert the whole town's people. That's what I felt like doing about the tree. I wanted to awake the countryside to its wonder.

More than 500 men and women from 52 countries around the world are competing in four-a-side matches between 10 and 15 July. And city shoppers, workers and visitors have descended on George square to take in some of the 416 matches. Over the course of the week crowds are expected to reach 100,000, with Nicola Sturgeon even taking time out of her busy schedules to cheer from the sidelines. The first minister said the Homeless World Cup would energise and engage people who, for whatever reason, have become socially excluded. I took in Wednesday's matches and the heavy showers did nothing to dampen the player's spirits with a glut of goals. Spectators donned ponchos in the stands and gathered around the big screen to watch Scotland's women defeat the USA 11-1. In the opposite stand, Argentina and England fans exchanged some friendly chants as England's women narrowly saw off their opponents, winning 3-2. Office workers gathered at the windows of the square's surrounding buildings to watch the action. Men and women who are used to going unnoticed in everyday life have been thrust into the limelight as they represent their respective nations in their bid to become Homeless World Cup champions. In typical Scottish fashion we were treated to a complete change in weather conditions on Thursday, with matches kicking off in glorious sunshine. And fans seemed to be taking advantage as crowds gathered in bigger numbers than the day before. Party atmosphere Families arrived with young football fans in their favourite team colours. David Henderson, 74, from Cumbernauld, had his two grandchildren with him who are aspiring footballers themselves. Mr Henderson said it was great to see everyone out and integrating with each other. \\"This is my second time here. I was here on Tuesday and as soon as I said to my grandkids they wanted to come,\\" he said. \\"The atmosphere is good and it shows you the people from Glasgow just all integrate and get wired in.\\" The atmosphere was certainly lively as workers on their lunch break began to drift into George Square to take in one of the 14-minute matches. James, 33, from London, is in Glasgow on business this week and had no idea the Homeless World Cup was taking place until he was walking past and decided to take in Wales v Australia. He said: \\"It is fantastic. What a party. Everyone is just really happy and chilled.\\" There were plenty of goals in the match with Wales running out eventual 7-3 winners. As lunchtime approached the stands began to fill for Ireland v Northern Ireland. Fans were not left disappointed as this tight affair finished 4-4. Matches ending in a draw are decided by penalties - players dribble towards the goalkeeper unopposed before taking their shot on goal. Ireland ran out eventual winners of the game scoring two penalties to one. The Homeless World Cup was co-founded by Mel Young, who also co-founded the Big Issue and is the chairman of Sportscotland. He said the players from around the world have been warmly welcomed by team Scotland and the people of Glasgow. \\"Our players are remarkable ambassadors for humanity, they are facing some of the toughest life challenges, and in their own way dealing with them,\\" he said. \\"We hope spectators will continue to come out in their numbers as the competition reaches it's climax over the next couple of days.\\" Scotland are bidding to be crowned world champions for the third time having previously won the cup in both 2007 and 2011. The Scotland squad are selected from the Street Soccer Scotland national football programme which supports socially disadvantaged men and women. Former Manchester United manager Sir Alex Ferguson is the national ambassador for the organisation which has also helped to provide reserve players to other national teams who have lost squad members through injury. Scotland's players are picked by team manager and former Rangers star Ally Dawson, 58, who first became involved in the Homeless World Cup when it began in Graz, Austria in 2003. He said his players were getting a great deal out of the event and that it was a great opportunity for them to learn about different cultures. The former player, who was capped for Scotland five times, said there was a \\"buzz about the place\\" and that everyone had been friendly and was getting behind the team. \\"People see how good Glasgow is and how open and friendly it is and everyone has a smile on their face,\\" he added. Dawson says the commitment and work rate of the players has been fantastic and that they believe in one another and work well together. At the moment, Scotland's men sit third in Group A with the woman's team sitting second and one point behind leaders Kyrgyzstan in Group B. They will have to continue their impressive run of form as tournament favourites Mexico top their groups in both men's and women's tournaments. The finals will be played on Saturday.","output":"More than 500 men and women from 52 countries are participating in the Homeless World Cup, a four-a-side football tournament held in Glasgow, attracting spectators including the First Minister, with Scotland aiming for its third victory having previously won the cup in 2007 and 2011, and as the tournament progresses, the stands continue to fill with fans."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

While being nimble suggests quick and light movements, only describes a part of what is needed to be a good climber. Dexterity, on the other hand, implies a level of skill and control in executing precise movements with the hands, which is an essential aspect of climbing. It involves grip strength, fine motor skills, and the ability to maneuver through complex hand and finger positions. Sam might have had dexterity but lacked other important factors to excel in climbing. To provide context for each option: 1. Fingers - While fingers are crucial in climbing, simply having fingers does not guarantee success in the activity. It is about using the fingers effectively that truly matters. 2. Skill - Although Sam may have possessed some skill, he was mentioned specifically as not being good at climbing. Thus, this option would not be the most suitable answer. 3. Muscles - Having muscles is another important aspect of climbing, but it is a more general term that would not capture the specific attribute we are trying to highlight in Sam. Moreover, being nimble does not necessarily imply muscular strength. 4. Strength - Strength is necessary for climbing, but Sam's nimbleness does not necessarily correlate to his strength, which might be inadequate for climbing. Additionally, strength alone does not equate to being skillful in climbing.

The lawyers continued to sue Christopher Cole, a founder of Peregrine Systems, even though they “had no evidence implicating him in the fraud scheme,” the Second Court of Appeals in Los Angeles ruled in a decision released Friday. (Law.com reported the case today.) The decision is interesting for a couple of reasons. First, it represents a rare example of a court holding lawyers to the same high standards of professional behavior that lawyers impose, through litigation, on doctors, accountants, engineers and other professionals. As the court noted, “an attorney has a responsibility to avoid frivolous or vexatious litigation.” And the court refused to let some of the lawyers off the hook simply because they were attorneys of record and claimed ignorance of the actual details of the case. As superlawyer Stanley Chesley learned last year in a case involving fraudulent fen-phen claims, attorneys of record, like doctors signing off on a chart, bear responsibility for whatever happens later. The court even reversed a lower court’s award of 7,895 in fees to the attorneys who were sued. The award itself seems curious given how rare it is for other types of professionals to win fees when plaintiffs lose their cases against them. Cole sued Patricia A. Meyers Associates, Kiesel Boucher & Larson and San Diego lawyer Robert P. Ottilie in 2010, accusing them of defamation and malicious prosecution for accusing him of participating in the fraud that brought down Peregrine in 2002. The fraud lawsuit against Cole was dismissed in 2007. The lawyers brought an anti-SLAPP action to block Cole’s suit and won at the trial-court level, with the judge even awarding them attorneys fees as provided under the law. Anti-SLAPP laws are designed to protect people from being sued over activities that are in the public interest, such as protesting a plant expansion, or possibly bringing litigation. The appeals court disagreed this case was in the public interest, however, ruling that they attorneys’ claims “fail to demonstrate that the fraud allegations against Cole were supported by probable cause at any time.” Cole had long since left active management at the time the fraud occurred at Peregrine, the court said, and there was no evidence his sales of millions of shares of stock, which netted him 28 million, were motivated by illegal inside information. “The attorneys drew logically flawed inferences from known facts or stretched those facts to fit their fraud-based theories,” the court concluded. Boucher’s lawyer Jonathan Cole (no relation to the plaintiff) told Law.com the case will have “a chilling effect on the practice of law. “Lawyers who want to associate with other lawyers in some sort of limited capacity now need to invest time and expense — probably at the client’s expense — to conduct some type of probable cause due diligence analysis before they step into the case.” Yes, well. That is what it means to be a professional. Write a one or two sentence summary.","output":"A court in California has reinstated a lawsuit against lawyers who pursued a fraud case without evidence. This ruling shows that lawyers can be held to the same high standards of behavior as other professionals, such as doctors and accountants."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant that follows instruction extremely well.

Context: I’ve learnt a great amount throughout this studio, first and foremost I was taught: how the art world functions, how specific galleries such as Gertrude St Contemporary run and how artists earn a living. The studio also provided me with basic filmmaking skills such as how to: create a shooting schedule, write a shooting script, set up three-point lighting, conduct an interview, utilise visual storytelling and edit a short film. Throughout the shooting process with my artist I also developed my abilities regarding how to use a: Sony Zoom H2N (and other such handy recorders), a lapel mic, my own Canon EOS 60D and Adobe Premiere Pro editing software. Overall I think the studio functioned quite successfully, it was great to be in a studio with nineteen people who all were interested in the same topics as you. I felt that overall, the studios had a very happy and supportive environment, and you walked away knowing a great deal about the art world and how to make short documentaries. The project itself taught me a great deal about how to work with talent, as well as my group members. Having to work independently forced me to be completely all over every aspect of the shoot, whether that be choosing which questions to ask, deciding what to focus on, where I wanted the shoot to happen, deciding what gear to use, getting to the shoot, carrying all the gear, what I wanted to shoot, managing the audio, managing the lighting, managing the camera set-ups, managing the talent, editing the film, and finding a great soundtrack for it. I’m a pretty self-conscious person and I often doubt the decisions I make or ask someone else for their opinion (should I shoot this angle, or what do you think of this question etc.). Working independently pushed me to go with my gut instincts, to make decisions and to not seek others approval. It forced me to develop my aesthetic as a filmmaker and to own the work that I ended up producing, so ultimately I was really glad with how everything panned out. Question: Why was the narrator self-conscience?

In the 19th century its main predecessor was a leader in Evangelicalism. Founded in 1968 by the union of the Methodist Church (USA) and the Evangelical United Brethren Church, the UMC traces its roots back to the revival movement of John and Charles Wesley in England as well as the Great Awakening in the United States. As such, the church's theological orientation is decidedly Wesleyan. It embraces both liturgical and evangelical elements.  The United Methodist Church is the largest denomination within the wider Methodist movement, which has approximately 80 million adherents across the world. In the United States, the UMC ranks as the largest mainline Protestant denomination, the largest Protestant church after the Southern Baptist Convention, and the third largest Christian denomination. As of 2014, worldwide membership was about 12 million: 7.2 million in the United States, and 4.4 million in Africa, Asia and Europe. It is a member of the World Council of Churches, the World Methodist Council, and other religious associations.

Please answer the following question: Write a multi-choice question for the following article, with the given choices and answer: Article: Magic is believed to have begun with the Egyptians, in 1700 BC. A magician named Dedi of Dedsnefu was reported to have performed for the pharaoh, or the king. He was also known to have entertained the slaves who built the pyramids. The \\"Cups and Balls\\" trick which he was particularly good at is still performed by magicians all over the world today. The ancient Greeks and Romans were also fascinated by the idea of magic. Actually, one of their main interests was the art of deception . This explains why at that time the priests  even built magic devices into their temples. These devices made it possible for doors to open by themselves and wine to flow magically out of statues' mouths. This was done mainly to convince people that the priests were powerful. Magic, however, was not well accepted before the 1800s. Magicians were thought of as freaks  and were only allowed to perform in a circus . It was in the 19th century that the magician Robert Houdin came along and changed people's views and attitudes about magic. It was also because of Robert Houdin that many magicians were able to add Dr. or MD to their names. Today magicians try hard to find new ways to show their practiced skills. Magic is now entertainment for families all over the world. Options: A Magic began about 3,700 years ago. B Dedi of Dedsnefu performed magic for kings only.

A detailed answer to the question is as follows: The crime that is estimated to cost over one trillion U.S. dollars every year worldwide is corruption. Corruption is a dishonest or illegal behavior conducted by individuals, groups, or organizations to gain an unfair advantage or illegitimate personal benefits. It takes many forms, such as bribery, embezzlement, nepotism, extortion, and money laundering. The economic impact of corruption is immense, with the World Economic Forum estimating the cost of corruption at about 2.6 trillion, or roughly 5% of the global GDP. The negative effects of corruption extend beyond economic consequences, as it also undermines legitimate institutions and processes, weakens good governance, raises the cost of essential services, and deepens inequalities, thereby eroding public trust and threatening social cohesion. Furthermore, corruption can discourage foreign investment, skew public spending, and distort markets, exacerbating poverty and undermining development. In order to counteract corruption, measures such as increasing transparency, strengthening legal frameworks, promoting good governance practices, fostering public engagement and access to information, and building a strong culture of accountability and integrity are crucial. Some international organizations, like Transparency International and the United Nations Office on Drugs and Crime (UNODC), work tirelessly to fight corruption and assist countries in implementing effective anti-corruption strategies. Though the mentioned statement about political funding practices highlights one aspect of corruption, it does not comprehensively answer the question about the crime that costs over one trillion U.S. dollars every year worldwide. The crime in question is, in fact, the broader issue of corruption."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant. You will be given a task. You must generate a detailed and long answer. What happens next? How to get along with your boyfriend  Make time to talk to each other.  The best way to get along is to keep the lines of communication open at all times. If you live together, you might catch up on your day during dinner.","output":"If you don't live together, you can make it a habit to check in with each other via texts, video calls, or phone calls throughout the day. Make sure to have open and honest conversations about each of your thoughts, feelings, and any concerns that may arise in the relationship. This will help build trust and understanding, as well as make it easier to resolve conflicts when they arise. Show an interest in their hobbies and activities. Being genuinely interested in your boyfriend's hobbies and activities is another great way to get along with him. You don't have to become an expert in everything he does, but try learning about it and participating in it whenever possible. This will show your boyfriend that you value his interests and are willing to invest your time and energy in something that makes him happy. Respect their personal space and boundaries. Just as you need your own personal space and time, so does your boyfriend. Respecting each other's boundaries is crucial in maintaining a healthy relationship. Understand that your boyfriend may need time alone to recharge or focus on his hobbies and interests, and it is essential to support that. The same goes for you; make sure to prioritize your own self-care and personal interests to maintain a balanced and fulfilling relationship. Be supportive and encouraging. Partners who support and encourage each other's dreams and aspirations tend to have healthier and happier relationships. Be your boyfriend's biggest cheerleader and make sure to express your belief in his abilities. Celebrate his successes with him and be there for him during his failures. This will not only help you get along with him, but it will also strengthen your emotional connection. Invest time in shared interests and hobbies. While it's important to have your individual interests and hobbies, sharing some common hobbies can bring you even closer. These can range from going for walks, watching movies, cooking, and traveling to partaking in engaging activities such as painting, dancing, or playing sports. This will provide an opportunity for you both to bond and enjoy quality time together. Resolve conflicts in a healthy manner. Disagreements and arguments are inevitable in any relationship. The key to resolving conflicts is to approach them with understanding, patience, and open-mindedness. Always be willing to listen to your boyfriend's point of view without judging or dismissing his feelings. Find ways to compromise and reach a mutual understanding that benefits both parties. Be affectionate and expressive with your love. Physical and verbal expressions of love are important in any relationship. Hug, hold hands, and cuddle with your boyfriend when you are together and send loving messages and compliments when you're apart. This will help reinforce your bond and strengthen your emotional connection. Keep the romance alive. Just because you are now in a relationship does not mean that you should let romance take a back seat. Surprise your boyfriend with a special date night, write a heartfelt note, or do something spontaneous from time to time. This will keep the excitement alive in your relationship and prevent the infamous relationship rut. Be honest and trust each other. Trust and honesty are the cornerstones of any healthy relationship. Make sure to uphold these values consistently in your relationship. Whenever problems arise, never hesitate to bring them up to your boyfriend and discuss them openly. Trust that he will value your openness and honesty, and do the same in return. Always remember that the key to getting along with your boyfriend is to be a good listener, have open and honest communication, and to strive to meet each other's needs while respecting individual boundaries. Be supportive, invest in shared experiences, and continue to prioritize and foster love and romance in your relationship."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant. You will be given a task.

This article: The highlight of Doubleday's career came after 7 February 1845 when a young man, who later admitted having spent the prior week \\"indulging in intemperance\\", smashed the Portland Vase, an example of Roman cameo glass and among the most famous glass items in the world, into hundreds of pieces.

Only 37 small splinters, most from the interior or thickness of the vase, were left out; the cameo base disc, which was found to be a modern replacement, was set aside for separate display. A new base disc of plain glass, with a polished exterior and matte interior, was diamond-engraved \\"Broke Feby 7th 1845 Restored Sept 10th 1845 By John Doubleday\\". The British Museum awarded Doubleday an additional £25 (equivalent to £2,500 in 2016) for his work.At the time the restoration was termed \\"masterly\\" and Doubleday was lauded by The Gentleman's Magazine for demonstrating \\"skilful ingenuity\\" and \\"cleverness ... sufficient to establish his immortality as the prince of restorers\\". In 2006 William Andrew Oddy, a former keeper of conservation at the museum, noted that the achievement \\"must rank him in the forefront of the craftsmen-restorers of his time.\\" Doubleday's restoration would remain for more than 100 years until the adhesive grew increasingly discoloured. The vase was next restored by J. W. R. Axtell in 1948–1949, and then by Nigel Williams in 1988–1989. contains an answer for the question: What is the last name of the person who by 10 September he had glued the Portland Vase whole again?, what is it ? Answer:","output":"The last name of the person who had glued the Portland Vase whole again by 10 September is Doubleday. His full name is John Doubleday, and he was responsible for the restoration of the vase after it was severely damaged in 1845."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Information:  - The High Fens , which were declared a nature reserve in 1957, are an upland area, a plateau region in the province of Liège, in the east of Belgium and adjoining parts of Germany, between the Ardennes and the Eifel highlands. The High Fens are the largest nature reserve or park in Belgium, with an area of ; it lies within the German-Belgian natural park \\"Hohes Venn-Eifel\\", in the Ardennes. Its highest point, at above sea level, is the Signal de Botrange near Eupen, and also the highest point in Belgium. A tower high was built here that reaches above sea level. The reserve is a rich ecological endowment of Belgium covered with alpine sphagnum raised bogs (not \\"fens\\" as the name would imply) both on the plateau and in the valley basin; the bogs, which are over 10,000 years old, with their unique subalpine flora, fauna and microclimate, are key to the conservation work of the park.  - Brussels South Charleroi Airport ( BSCA ) , also called Charleroi Airport or Gosselies Airport , ( IATA : CRL , ICAO : EBCI ) is an international airport located in Gosselies , a part of the city of Charleroi , 46 kilometres ( 29 mi ) south of central Brussels , in Wallonia ( Belgium ) .

Wallonia is primarily French-speaking, and accounts for 55% of the territory of Belgium, and a third of its population. Unlike Flanders, the Walloon Region was not merged with the French Community of Belgium which is the political entity that is responsible for matters related mainly to culture and education. The German-speaking minority in the east forms the German-speaking Community of Belgium, which has its own government and parliament for culture-related issues.  - Gosselies is a section of the Belgian town of Charleroi within the Walloon region in the Province of Hainaut. Located in the north of Charleroi, it was a municipality of its own before the merger of the municipalities in 1977.

The airport covers an area of of land and features two passenger terminals with a capacity of approximately 65 million passengers per year, four runways and extensive logistics and maintenance facilities.  - In Belgium, the French Community refers to one of the three constituent constitutional linguistic communities. Since 2011, the French Community has used the name Federation Wallonia-Brussels, which is controversial because its name in the Belgian constitution has not changed and because it is seen as a political statement. The name \\"French Community\\" refers to Francophone Belgians, and \\"not\\" to French people residing in Belgium. As such, the French Community of Belgium is sometimes rendered in English as \\"the French-speaking Community of Belgium\\" for clarity.  - An international airport is an airport that offers customs and immigration facilities for passengers travelling between countries. International airports are typically larger than domestic airports and often feature longer runways and facilities to accommodate the heavier aircraft commonly used for international and intercontinental travel.

The friend had a habit of looking at everything positively that happened in his life and saying \\"This is good\\". One day the king and his friend were out hunting. The friend would prepare the guns for the king. The friend did something wrong in preparing one of the guns, and after the gun from his friend, the king fired it and his thumb  was blown off. On seeing the situation the friend said as usual, \\"This is good!\\" The king replied, \\"No, this is not good!\\" He was very angry and sent his friend to jail . About a year later, the king was hunting in a forest. Cannibals  caught him and took him to their village. As they were going to kill him, they noticed that the king was missing a thumb. They never ate anyone who was less than whole, so they sent the king back. When he returned home, he felt sorry for his treatment of his friend. He went quickly to the jail to speak with his friend. \\"You were right\\", he said. \\"It was good that thumb was blown off.\\" And he told the friend all that had just happened. \\"And so I am very sorry for sending you to jail for so long. It was bad for me to do this.\\" \\"No,\\" his friend replied, \\"this is good!\\" \\"What do you mean? How could it be good that I sent my friend to jail for a year?\\" \\"If I had not been in jail, I would have been with you, and I would have been eaten!\\"","output":"Question:  According to the article, which of the following best describes the events and their consequences? A) The king and his friend went hunting. The friend prepared the gun improperly, leading to the king's thumb being blown off when fired.

The following year, while the king was again hunting, he got captured by cannibals but was released because of his missing thumb. Recognizing the unintentional benefit, the king apologized to his friend for his imprisonment.  B) The king was hunting with his friend, whose positive outlook irritated the king, leading to the friend's imprisonment. The king's thumb was then blown off by a faulty gun prepared by his friend. The king was captured by cannibals that released him due to his missing thumb. Afterwards, the king apologized to his friend. C) The king and his friend were hunting. The improper preparation of the gun by the friend had led to the king's thumb being blown off, which saved him from being eaten by cannibals the next year. However, because of his anger, the king imprisoned his friend who had actually saved his life.  D) The king, annoyed by his friend's positivity, sent him to prison. The friend wrongly prepared a gun which resulted in the king losing his thumb. The king got captured by cannibals while hunting, but was saved because of his missing thumb and regretted imprisoning his friend.  Correct Answer:  A) The king and his friend went hunting.

Write an article that answers the following question: Which group lost more combatants, the Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps or the Armed Forces of the Islamic Republic of Iran?","output":"Title: Comparing the Losses: Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps vs. Armed Forces of the Islamic Republic of Iran Once upon a time, in a land far away called Iran, there were two very important groups that helped keep the country safe. These groups were called the Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps (we'll call them the 'Guard') and the Armed Forces of the Islamic Republic of Iran (we'll call them the 'Army'). They sometimes had to fight to protect their country, and sometimes they lost people in these fights. Now, some people wonder which group has lost more people, the Guard or the Army? To understand this, let's see what each group does: 1. The Guard: They are like superheroes protecting Iran. They keep the country safe from any bad people and help keep everything running smoothly. 2. The Army: This group is also like superheroes, but they focus on defending the country in case someone tries to attack them. Both groups have fought in different battles, but it's hard to count how many people were lost in each fight. There were many battles and wars, like the one called the Iran-Iraq War, which was fought many years ago and lasted eight long years. From what we know, it seems that the Guard has had more losses than the Army. This is because the Guard is often involved in more dangerous missions where they need to go to faraway places and be close to the bad guys. The Army usually stays closer to home and is focused on defending the country. In conclusion, although we can't say exactly how many people each group has lost, it is likely that the Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps (the Guard) has lost more combatants than the Armed Forces of the Islamic Republic of Iran (the Army). Remember, both groups are working hard to protect and defend their country, and each person's sacrifice is important in keeping Iran safe."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

If It's also the route taken by patriotic, civic, and religious processions, most notably the Hogueras de San Juan parade held every June., can we conclude that \\"The Hogueras de San Juan parade takes this route every June.\\"?","output":"Yes, based on the provided information, we can conclude that \\"The Hogueras de San Juan parade takes this route every June.\\" It is noted that the route in question is also used for patriotic, civic, and religious processions, which further reinforces its significance and prominence as a location for various cultural and community events. The Hogueras de San Juan parade, also known as the \\"Bonfires of Saint John,\\" is an annual event celebrated in various parts of Spain in honor of Saint John the Baptist. Typically taking place between June 20th and 24th, it coincides with the summer solstice, when the days are longest and the nights are shortest. The festivities consist of lighting bonfires, burning effigies called \\"ninots,\\" and numerous parades, as well as fireworks, music, and dancing. The celebration is deeply rooted in Spanish tradition and is held to ward off evil spirits, cleanse the soul, and bring good fortune for the coming year. Given the context mentioned, it is even more apparent that the route chosen for this event is of great importance. By incorporating patriotic, civic, and religious processions along the way, the Hogueras de San Juan parade in June effectively showcases the rich history, cultural diversity, and shared values of the community it represents. The blending of various beliefs, traditions, and practices in this single event demonstrates a spirit of unity and harmony among the participants. Such a convergence of cultural elements can also contribute to a strengthened sense of identity, pride, and heritage for those who engage in the parade. Moreover, the annual recurrence of this tradition plays a crucial role in fostering social cohesion and in providing an opportunity for people from different backgrounds to come together and celebrate their shared history.

Shenandoah is an American country music group founded in Muscle Shoals, Alabama in 1984 by Marty Raybon (lead vocals, acoustic guitar), Ralph Ezell (bass guitar, backing vocals), Stan Thorn (keyboards, backing vocals), Jim Seales (lead guitar, backing vocals), and Mike McGuire (drums, background vocals). Thorn and Ezell left the band in the mid-1990s, with Rocky Thacker taking over on bass guitar; Keyboardist Stan Munsey joined the line up in 1995. The band split up in 1997 after Raybon left. Seales, Munsey, Thacker and McGuire reformed the band in 2000 with lead singer Brent Lamb, who was in turn replaced by Curtis Wright and then by Jimmy Yeary. The band achieved its biggest hit in 1990 with the three-week number-one single \\"Next to You, Next to Me.\\" Written by then-solo singers Robert Ellis Orrall and Curtis Wright, this was the first of five singles from Shenandoah's third album, Extra Mile. \\"Ghost in This House,\\" \\"I Got You\\" (co-written by Teddy Gentry of the band Alabama) and \\"The Moon Over Georgia\\" all peaked in the Billboard top ten between late 1990 and mid-1991, with the latter two reaching number one on Gavin Report; \\"When You Were Mine,\\" the fifth single, stopped at number 38 on Billboard in 1991. Also that year, the band won the Academy of Country Music's Vocal Group of the Year award.  Alanna Nash of Entertainment Weekly gave Extra Mile a B rating, saying that it was \\"unflinchingly commercial\\" but adding that \\"the band goes beyond Alabama's jingoistic flag-waving and Restless Heart's vapid mood-brighteners to showcase intelligent ballads and jaunty rhythm numbers.\\" An uncredited review in the Pittsburgh Post-Gazette said that the band \\"proved that no matter how overcrowded the field is, there's always room for quality.\\"  Extra Mile earned a gold certification in the United States.  Following the release of Extra Mile, a band from Kentucky threatened to sue Shenandoah over the use of the name Shenandoah. After a financial settlement was made with the Kentucky band, two other bands filed lawsuits over Shenandoah's name. The lawsuits depleted the money earned by the band on the road, which led to the band asking the label and their production company to all pay one-third of their legal costs. The production company refused, and Shenandoah was forced to filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy in early 1991 after paying more than 2 million dollars on court settlements and legal fees. Although the lawsuits allowed Shenandoah to keep its name, the bankruptcy filing terminated the contract with Columbia after a 1992 Greatest Hits package. The production company's officials then filed a lawsuit against the band, claiming that it had tried to void its agreement with them. After Shenandoah's departure, there were no other bands on Columbia's Nashville division; as a result, producer Larry Strickland assembled three musicians to create a new band called Matthews, Wright & King in an attempt to keep a commercially successful band on the label.

The Dr. Gridlock column receives hundreds of letters each month from motorists and transit riders throughout the Washington region. They ask questions and make complaints about getting around a region plagued with some of the worst traffic in the nation. The doctor diagnoses problems and tries to bring relief. Dr. Gridlock appears in The Post's Metro section on Sunday and in the Extra section on Thursday. His comments also appear on the Web site's Get There blog. You can send e-mails for the newspaper column to drgridlock@washpost.com or write to Dr. Gridlock at 1150 15th St. NW, Washington, D.C. 20071. Dr. Gridlock: Hello, travelers, let's get to your questions about getting around this region. Metro Web site lies re: Train Times, D.C.: Why doesn't the Metro Web site sync with actual train schedules? I'm often leaving my office at Metro Center late and night, and I hate waiting 15 minutes for a train! So I figured I could look up when the next train was coming and be there to meet it. Except there is no relation to the Metro Web site and actual train schedules! Why??? Dr. Gridlock: I can tell you how it's supposed to work. Here's what Metro says about using its Web site, www.metroopensdoors.com, to get real time information on trains: From the home page, go to the \\"Maps and Stations\\" page and click on \\"Find a Stop/Station.\\" You'll see a list of stations. Click on the on yours. Then click to \\"Next Train Arrival\\" to get the arrival times of the next three trains headed in each direction. What you'll see looks like the electronic display boards on the platforms. The page refreshes every 30 seconds. Arlington, Va.: A big thank you to the Arlington County Police Officer who was pulling over people driving in the breakdown lane on 66-West this morning. This is a chronic problem in the a.m. between Lee Highway and Glebe Road, so it was nice to see someone take some action against it. Dr. Gridlock: It's a frustrating thing to drive I-66, especially at rush periods and especially inside the Beltway, where it's only two lanes. The state is looking at some improvements in the westbound direction that don't involve expanding the right of way. Driving in the breakdown lane is no solution. It's a dangerous thing for those who do it and for other motorists. Fairfax, Va.: This may be more of a Metro question but... Recently the overflow parking lot at the Vienna station closed down. Although Metro offered options of where else to park your car (then take a bus to the station) none are very convenient for me. Several times now I have arrived at the station at around 8, only to find there is no parking (except for all the empty \\"reserved\\" spaces). Metro claims that a new parking deck is being built in 2007, but what do they plan to do about all the new traffic this will cause, and all the back-up this will cause on the trains? Dr. Gridlock: Metro and local governments are planning to add more parking across the region, but construction is not keeping pace with demand. My letter-writers are particularly vexed about the closings of parking areas in some places to make way for construction around Metro stations. Vienna is a case in point. I talked to a group of retired federal workers in the Vienna-Oakton area last week who said they don't even think about taking the train. They like to do their traveling outside of rush hour, and of course, you can't get a parking space at the Vienna Station. Meanwhile, Metro wants to add more reserved parking and overbook it, like airlines overbook seats because they know some people won't show up. I hear from some people frustrated because they've been on the waiting list for reserved parking forever, but I also hear from others who see empty reserved spaces they can't use when everything else is full. Chesapeake Beach, Md.: Why isn't there a bullet train between Baltimore and Washington? Fifteen minutes station to station -- something really revolutionary and modern. Dr. Gridlock: If you go to http://www.bwmaglev.com/, you can read more about the proposal to build a maglev train line between Baltimore and Washington. But the thing is, this would cost about 4 billion to build (and I think the estimate would prove to be low). So what would a one-way ticket cost? Maybe 40? Maybe tourists would use it, or people in a desperate hurry on one particular day. But it's not a solution for commuters. We'd be better off extending Metro's Green Line up that way, building a new light rail line, or enhancing commuter bus service. Can you please let us know the rules regarding bicycles on the escalators when the elevators are down? I am always seeing strollers on the escalators and no one bats an eye... Dr. Gridlock: Here's Metro's rule: \\"Cyclists shall be required to use elevators to access mezzanines and platforms. Escalators and stairs shall not be used except when special requests (for emergency reasons) have been granted by Metro Station Managers, Metro Transit Police, or city/county police or fire officials. Cyclists shall allow other passengers to exit before placing bicycles in or taking bicycles out of the elevators.\\" Metro doesn't want to take a chance on a bike slipping from the riders hands and tumbling down the steps. It's crazy for people to take a chance with a stroller, too. Metro's Web site has a list of stations where the elevators are out of service, so surprises should be rare. Jacksonville, Fla. (but recently D.C.): What do you mean by saying that Porcari \\"knows\\" that Maryland doesn't have enough money to build any new stuff? If they can afford the ICC, why can't they afford other stuff? Dr. Gridlock: What I said on my \\"Get There\\" blog this morning was that incoming Maryland transportation secretary John Porcari Porcari \\"knows that Maryland doesn't have the money or the room to build a lot of big new stuff in the densely populated Washington-Baltimore corridor.\\" I also quoted Porcari saying that his top priority is to make sure that projects under construction or near construction actually get done. That would include the intercounty connector highway, for example. Probably would not include a 4 billion maglev link between Washington and Baltimore. Back on metro after 20 years!: I hope I am not beating a dead horse, but I have noticed some particularly foul odors in Metro stations recently. The odors smell part dead animal, or part burning brakes or some other mechanical piece burning. I notice the smells waiting in stations, but not on trains themselves. Sometimes the smell is enhanced when a train enters the station. Has anyone else noticed or commented on these odors? Dr. Gridlock: If you experienced what a lot of other riders have experienced in the past couple months, Metro says you're smelling the new brake pads. Metro knows the odor is a problem and is working with the manufacturer to fix this. Fairfax, Va.: Can you ask your readers how busy Chain Bridge Road from McLean through Tysons into Vienna is during rush hour? Is it busy throughout the day, or can I get across town better before a certain time in the early morning and early evening? As bad as it may be, is it better than taking the beltway to I66W to get to Vienna instead of Chain Bridge Road? Fairfax, Va.: When the funding finally gets finished for Metro to Tysons/Dulles, do you think we'll finally see movement on rail to Centreville down the median of I-66? Dr. Gridlock: I hope we don't have to wait that long for some way of pushing transit farther out the I-66 corridor. The 4 billion rail to Dulles project won't be finished till 2015, which might be optimistic. Burke, Va.: Why do states constantly think that throwing money at a problem will solve it??? Spending billions of dollars on transportation is NEVER going to solve the source or the problem: That people cannot afford to live where they work. Until the government figures out a way to create affordable housing near work centers, all of the money in the world is not going to solve the traffic problem! Dr. Gridlock: I agree with what you said. More money is not going to solve the problem. But I do believe that all across this region, we've got to spend a lot more money to help solve it. The problem is so big, it requires a big, complex solution. Make our transportation planning and construction problems more rational, more transparent, more efficient. Coordinate transportation planning and land use planning (like you said, more affordable housing near work centers). But if you just plan better for land use, you haven't solved the problem either. We still have to build roads and transit and sidewalks and bike paths to match up with a smarter design for our communities. Arlington, Va.: Is there any information about how the closing of the Arlington Cemetery station this weekend went? I live in Rosslyn and I do know that the shuttle buses were there, but I decided not to bother to head to Pentagon City because of the business of going in and out of the Pentagon Station both ways, although I suppose riding down to L'Enfant Plaza and switching might have worked. Dr. Gridlock: I haven't heard any complaints -- yet -- about the changes Metrorail imposed this weekend because of the major track work around Arlington Cemetery Station. What say you all? This was a fairly large-scale reorganization. Because of the weekend work, the Yellow Line was extended and the Blue Line was diverted away from the Rosslyn tunnel. Capitol Hill, D.C.: The Montgomery County Planning Board recently approved recommendations to build a bikeway along the entire 18 mile ICC. Right now, the state is only going to build along 7.7 miles (non-contiguous). Did Porcari say anything about the bikeway (since he believes that \\"a proper transportation network offers people choices -- drive, ride transit, bike, walk.\\") Dr. Gridlock: Capitol Hill refers to my interview with incoming MD transportation secretary John Porcari. I didn't ask Porcari specifically about the unfunded portion of the ICC bikeway, but I've got to believe that if he can find a way to extend it along the entire route, he'll do that. During the interview, Porcari frequently mentioned his enthusiasm for the region's bike trails and the need to use every opportunity to expand them. He noted with some pride -- because he was involved in the planning -- that the new Wilson Bridge will be accessible to bikers. Chain Bridge into Vienna: Is a mess. Beltway is by far the better option. Or, take the backroads from McLean to Rt 7 and hop on 66 there. Dr. Gridlock: A response to the traveler's question above. Rockville, Md.: \\"Spending billions of dollars on transportation is NEVER going to solve the source or the problem: That people cannot afford to live where they work.\\" How much is this versus choose not to live near where they work? I work in downtown D.C. I have some coworkers who live in West Virginia. It's not cost of living (per se). They want to have acres upon acres on which to play on the weekends. They can't buy that here (since it doesn't exist) but they could (if they wanted) buy a nice house with a decent yard close in but, it wouldn't be what they wanted. Dr. Gridlock: That's the problem with Americans. They're never going to do exactly what you tell them. They're going to decide for themselves what's best for them and their families. I do believe in good planning as a partial solution to our transportation problems, but it's unrealistic to think we're going to eliminate the solo driver and get everyone living in areas dense enough to support transit. What is the absolute latest I could leave the D.C. area to get to NYC relatively hassle-free? Is 1:00 pushing it? Dr. Gridlock: Questions about long-distance travel times always vex me, because there's no way to account for what's going to happen to you between here and there. Will the weather change? Will there be a lane-closing accident on I-95 in Delaware? How long will the backup be at Delaware's toll plaza? Also, when you're making a long-distance trip during daylight, you're likely to wander into somebody else's rush period in the congested Northeast corridor. A Delaware highway official pointed out to me that the stretch of I-95 through his state may seem like long-distance pavement to us in Washington, but it's Main Street for New Castle County. (You think I'm obsessing on Delaware?) Washington, D.C.: Re: trains to BWI. Why build a new train? Why extend Metro? There actually is a train that goes there from D.C. and New Carrollton already. The train is called MARC. Granted, the service is awful unless you are going southbound in the a.m. or northbound in the p.m. Oh, and forget about weekends and holidays. But expanding existing service of trains that go from Metro stops to BWI and Baltimore seems to be a lot cheaper than building new tracks or inventing mag-lev trains. The various governments (I'm lumping all transit authorities, state, city, feds together here) should recognize the existing commuter rail networks such as MARC and VRE as reasonable ways to transport large numbers of people around the area, not just a way to get people into D.C. for work. The model should be more along the lines of Long Island RR or NJ Transit, with frequent service even on the weekends, rather than simply 9-5 commuters. Dr. Gridlock: I think improved weekday service on MARC and VRE should be a very high transportation priority. But it's not going to do everything we need -- at least not soon. MARC has to operate on tracks owned by CSX and Amtrak. There are only so many trains that can run on those lines. At a town hall meeting in Montgomery County last week, Porcari was asked if MARC service could run on weekends. Porcari noted that it would require renegotiation of agreements with the rail owners, plus a significant increase in the operating subsidy for MARC. Better equipment and more reliable service would be a good place to start improving MARC. Alexandria, Va.: Is there a resource online that displays what time the Metro stations with parking become full in the morning? Personally, I am interested in the Virginia stations. Thanks! Dr. Gridlock: There's no source I know of. Definitely not anything official from Metro that would help you on a given day. Maybe readers have some suggestions, though? Reston, Va.: Re:Chain Bridge Road From McLean into and through Tyson's it's \\"not that bad\\", assuming that everything is going smoothly. (No accidents, mistimed lights, random cop on the corner, etc.) But 123 into Vienna (after Old Courthouse) is usually a bear, primarily due to volume of both cars and traffic lights. Dr. Gridlock: That's another response to reader question above on best route. Washington, D.C.: Any idea on what the ICC will be signed as when it's complete? Will it be an extension of I-370 or will it have a number at all? Dr. Gridlock: David Buck, spokesman for the Maryland State Highway Administration, tells me that the intercounty connector will be designated as MD 200. Washington, D.C.: I used to work in McLean. I'd suggest that the reader seeking to go to Vienna consider taking the Toll Road west to Spring Hill, go left after the tollbooth, then right on Westpark Drive (the light at the top of the hill after passing the apartments), and follow that until you hit 123 next to the \\"Toilet Bowl Building.\\" Then go right onto 123. This avoids the mall traffic. In my experience 123 was worst during the evening rush hour but was okay during midday, but that was a few years ago. Dr. Gridlock: Another response to the travel question above. (What I've found is that our readers are an army of researchers and they're very willing to help fellow sufferers on the roads and rails. This is a very powerful force.) Arlington, Va.: re: travel between D.C. and NYC -- I've tried, and there is no way to travel during the day and miss rush hour everywhere. If you are actually going to NYC (vs. the suburbs), you stand a chance if you leave D.C. around 9:30 a.m. If you're passing through D.C. to Long Island or Westchester, you'll hit rush hour on the other side of the city. Really your best best is to wait after the p.m. rush ends in D.C., and the later you leave, the better -- you'd be amazed how much traffic is still on the NJ Turnpike at midnight. I usually wait until 9 p.m. before I head out. Dr. Gridlock: Another example of the research army. This was in response to the question about how late you can leave for New York and still avoid a big hassle. By the way, in doing some columns of holiday travel advice, I came to the conclusion that the time you leave outweighs the importance of the route you take in most cases. If you're traveling in the Northeast corridor of during holiday periods, you'll get more benefit from a very early or very late departure than you will from a \\"shortcut.\\" Delaware: I think you are so right to obsess about the backups in Delaware. They really need to stop considering their stretch of I-95 as part of a local Main Street, and start thinking of it as a piece of a vital commercial corridor that connects the entire eastern seaboard. A corridor that is consistently brought to a crashing halt in Delaware. Why don't they have high speed EZ-Pass lanes, similar to the N.J. turnpike, where you can drive through at 55 mph? That facility added to the Delaware Memorial Bridge and to the absurd little toll plaza they use to extort payment from all travelers would help immeasurably. Dr. Gridlock: And I should ask the Del. folks why they can't go for a one-way toll, like so many other turnpike and bridge authorities do. Must be a revenue reason. Probably something about the ease of getting around that toll plaza near the Maryland border. To earlier post (I-66, police officer..) There is a public workshop concerning the westbound I-66. Washington Lee HS, next Tuesday Jan. 23, 7-8:30. Dr. Gridlock: Thanks, Arlington, and I'll mention that in my Road Watch column as well. That meeting is about several ways the state has come up with to ease westbound travel without expanding the right of way on I-66 inside the Beltway. Washington, D.C.: Dr. Gridlock, I'm sure you've heard these comparisons before. I visited NYC a couple of weeks ago and couldn't help but marvel at how much more efficient the subway system is there. My sister was able to go online and figure out the best way for me to get from the city to Queens so that I could be picked up by my in-laws. Not only did it work, but it was a lot quicker than I expected -- on a Saturday! While the trains are not as luxurious as Metro's, they are relatively clean and seemingly run like clockwork and quite frequently -- for a Saturday. I also noticed there is a flat rate and no turnstiles when exiting the station. When will Metro get with the program? Also, do we trade off more luxurious trains and cleaner stations for trains that don't run frequently on weekends, evenings and holidays? Dr. Gridlock: In terms of transit in the U.S., there's New York and then there's everything else. Though it's a century old, the NYC system has lots of natural advantages. The region is so densely populated it can support an enormous transit system. Also, it was built with express tracks, that not only speed travel but also allow the subway managers to work the trains around problems. Still, our Metro system is one of the finest I've seen in my travels. We all want to see it get better, but that shouldn't blind us to this great resource. By the way, the \\"Trip Planner\\" on Metro's Web site is pretty good at helping you get around the region by transit. I use it a lot. Reston, Va.: Anyone want to do an actual headcount of Delaware tags on 95 IN Delaware? I worked there for several years and most folks avoid it like the combination of the plague and Ebola. Dr. Gridlock: Maybe it's like Yogi said: \\"Nobody goes there anymore. It's too crowded.\\" Around here, we say \\"never again\\" after a bad drive on the Beltway or a crushing experience on the Orange Line. But the next day, we're back in the rut because we haven't found a better way. Tysons Corner, Va.: I have written with this question but have never seen it in your column. I commute to Herndon from Tysons on the Toll Road. Frequently, a Fairfax County bus exits the Dulles Access Road doing 65 or 70, then has to careen over four lanes of traffic in time to get off at its Toll Road exit. I see the same thing the other direction, as buses get onto the Toll Road then swoop to the left to get on the Access Road. This seems like an accident looking for a time to happen. Why are buses allowed to use the Dulles Access Road? And why are they routed so as require such challenging lane changes? Dr. Gridlock: That's not a good maneuver for anybody, let alone a bus. That set up must have been designed for an era with far fewer cars trying to jam through. It is pretty common, though, to give buses access to the fastest possible route. They have access to the carpool lanes, they'll have access to the tolled intercounty connector in Maryland and to the High Occupancy/Toll lanes when they're built from Springfield to American Legion Bridge. Northern Virginia: Dear Dr. Gridlock, Recently I moved to the Ashburn area and commute to Reston. When I travel on Loudoun County Parkway to Waxpool (this is a really big intersection), two things I see every day: 1. People run the red light...not just by a smidgen, but blowing right through it 2. People turning right onto Waxpool from Loudoun County Parkway do so on red from the middle turn lane, even though there is a sign saying \\"No Turn on Red from This Lane\\". But really it's so small that people miss it, or people honk if someone actually stops on red in this lane. Just needed to vent, that is all. Dr. Gridlock: Thought I'd share that vent with the group. \\"Northern Virginia's\\" frustrations are pretty common across the region. Waldorf, Md.: Commuter buses are only as good as the roads they travel. There are plenty of commuter buses coming up to D.C. from Southern Maryland each day, but they sit in the same horrific traffic on 5/301 and into D.C. that I do in my car. I would take the bus if there were dedicated lanes and a consistent schedule. Any talk from Porcari about those types of improvements (or any improvements for that matter) for the fast-growing Southern Maryland region? Dr. Gridlock: First, give the man a chance. He isn't even in Annapolis yet. But I can tell you this: When we were talking about improvements in Maryland's transportation system, Porcari talked specifically about the addition of commuter buses to serve Southern Maryland. We also talked a bit about the need for a Route 301 bypass around Waldorf. I think you've got a guy coming into this job who brings experience from his first round under Gov. Glendening and an awareness of what Maryland travelers are looking for in terms of improvements. Dr. Gridlock: Travelers, I need to head off to a briefing on a transportation project many of you will be interested in. Once again, I've got far more good questions and comments on my screen than I could get to today. I'll make a printout and try to address some of them on the \\"Get There\\" blog or in upcoming Dr. Gridlock columns.

Question: What cause indian language to be abandoned in schools Context: Orientalist scholars of the 18th century like Sir William Jones marked a wave of enthusiasm for Indian culture and for Sanskrit. According to Thomas Trautmann, after this period of \\"Indomania\\", a certain hostility to Sanskrit and to Indian culture in general began to assert itself in early 19th century Britain, manifested by a neglect of Sanskrit in British academia. This was the beginning of a general push in favor of the idea that India should be culturally, religiously and linguistically assimilated to Britain as far as possible. Trautmann considers two separate and logically opposite sources for the growing hostility: one was \\"British Indophobia\\", which he calls essentially a developmentalist, progressivist, liberal, and non-racial-essentialist critique of Hindu civilisation as an aid for the improvement of India along European lines; the other was scientific racism, a theory of the English \\"common-sense view\\" that Indians constituted a \\"separate, inferior and unimprovable race\\".

This may be because, in their opinion, black is related to darkness and white to purity. However, that is not always the case. Did you know that the same one color may mean something differently in different places of the world? In the English-speaking world, black is the color of mourning--people wear black at the funeral. Red is concerned with danger or bloodshed . Yellow is the word for fear. If you are afraid, you are yellow. Yet none of these sayings is true outside the English-speaking world. In China and Korea white is the color of mourning. In Russia, China and some other countries, red stands for beauty, life and excellence. In Italy and Germany, you are yellow with anger, not with fear. Even within the English-speaking area, it is not difficult to find color contradictions .A redcap in the United States is a porter in a railway station. In Britain, however, a redcap is a military policeman. Both names are logical, because both men wear red caps.

Architecture One such reaction to the cold aesthetic of modernism and Brutalism is the school of metaphoric architecture, which includes such things as biomorphism and zoomorphic architecture, both using nature as the primary source of inspiration and design.

Metaphoric architecture is like using the shapes and designs we see in nature to create buildings. It makes the buildings look nice and interesting. Here are two examples of metaphoric architecture: 1. Biomorphism: This is when people design buildings based on the shapes we see in plants, animals, or even our own bodies. Imagine a building looking like a giant leaf or a flower – that's biomorphism. 2. Zoomorphic Architecture: This is when people design buildings that look like animals.

Question: Write a multi-choice question for the following article: Article: As more and more books become movie adaptations  , I can't help but think how this will affect English classes in America. Thinking back to my years in middle and high school -- ten years ago, I would be rewarded if I had read a number of classics. Today, a majority of those books are now also movies Life of Pi, The Great Gatsby, Much Ado About Nothing and Anna Karenina, to name a few. Even modern books such as The Hunger Games and Harry Potter have been adapted for the big screen. In discussion with my students, I often hear them say they are not going to read books because movies will come out soon, which makes me wonder what effect movie adaptations have on modern-day students. Will the Common Core State Standards (CCSS) encourage them to read books more carefully or to use movies to improve their understanding of the text? The CCSS requires students to provide text-based evidence when reading and discussing a book. By focusing on such evidence, teachers can pull specific details from a book that may have not made the final cut when the book was adapted for the big screen. For instance, after reading and watching The Hunger Games, there were a number of details from the book that were missing from the film -- many people were disappointed with Rue's meek   movie role. A student who failed to read The Hunger Games would not quite understand Rue's impact on the games in the same way as someone who had read the book and remembered all the details that went into her death. I am not saying the CCSS will stop students from cutting corners, but I believe if teachers use the support the CCSS provides, it can be a great roadway to ensure all students are digging deep into texts and not just hitting the play button. Answer:","output":"Question: Based on the article, what effect might the Common Core State Standards (CCSS) have on students' engagement with books that have been adapted into movies? A) Encourage students to avoid reading the books and only watch the movies B) Discourage students from watching any movie adaptations C) Promote deeper engagement with the text by asking for text-based evidence in discussions D) Require teachers to show all adaptations in class to supplement the reading material Answer: C) Promote deeper engagement with the text by asking for text-based evidence in discussions Explanation: According to the article, the Common Core State Standards (CCSS) emphasizes the use of textual evidence to support discussion and analysis in classes. This feature of the CCSS may lead to a greater emphasis on the books themselves, even if movie adaptations are available, thus encouraging students to read and engage with the text more carefully."},{"instruction":"You should describe the task and explain your answer.

Faster than a speeding bullet A new chapter in the history of motoring is set to be written in the near future when the Bloodhound SSC (supersonic car) is wheeled out in a bid to break the world land speed record by cracking the magic 1,000mph barrier. If it is successful, it will travel faster than a Magnum .375 bullet. The current record was set in 1997 when Wing Commander Andy Green, OBE, took the jet-propelled Thrust SSC to more than 763mph in the Black Rock desert, Nevada. Since 2008, Green and former land speed record-holder Richard Noble have been helping to run the multi-million-pound Bloodhound project and develop the car. Bloodhound itself uses a prototype Rolls-Royce EJ200 Eurofighter jet engine and a hybrid rocket – with a Cosworth Formula One motor thrown in for good measure to act as an “auxiliary” power supply and to run the rocket’s oxidiser pump. Green, who will drive the car, will sit feet forward in its aircraft-like cockpit where he is expected to experience a force of 2.5G as Bloodhound travels from standstill to 1,000mph in a terrifying 55 seconds. Slowing it down, meanwhile, will result in deceleration forces of up to 3G as a combination of air brakes, parachutes and finally disc brakes are deployed to bring the Bloodhound SSC to a safe standstill. A hi-tech digital screen and a mass of electrical switches will enable Green to operate the car’s myriad mechanisms, but the two most important instruments at his disposal will be instantly recognisable, taking the form of a pair of traditional-looking, analogue dials mounted on the dashboard pods to either side of Bloodhound’s multifunction steering wheel. Developed and supplied by Rolex, these highly accurate units comprise a speedometer featuring a scale of zero to 11 (and marked with the all-important legend “x100”), together with a matching chronograph and time clock. Despite the ability of digital technology to slice a second into mind-bogglingly small fractions, it has been established that the human brain is quicker to process information provided by a traditional analogue dial. So, while the central electronic screens will inevitably be more accurate, the Rolex instruments are there to provide at-a-glance data and serve as a fail-safe back-up in the event of a significant systems failure. Green will use them during two critical phases of the record bid: firstly, to time the all-important braking sequences required to slow Bloodhound down before it reaches the end of the 20km track; and, secondly, to keep track of time during the turnaround between the two runs, which must be made in order for the land speed record attempt to be officially recognised. Bloodhound, which is being built in Bristol, is expected to be fully assembled by the middle of next year in advance of a series of shakedown runs and speed tests in the UK. The world land speed record attempt, meanwhile, is set to take place in 2016 in the Hakskeen Pan desert in the north-west corner of South Africa. The figures behind Bloodhound’s twin dials Rolex has created the two cockpit instruments pictured above for Bloodhound: the speedometer and the chronograph stopwatch. The brand supplied Sir Malcolm Campbell with chronograph wristwatches for several of his attempts on the land speed record during the 1930s. If the Bloodhound SSC achieves 1,000mph, it will represent the largest margin by which the world land speed record has ever been broken. Bloodhound will cover its own length in less than three-hundredths of a second, a speed equivalent to four-and-a-half football pitches per second or 150 metres in the blink of an eye. Bloodhound’s three engines will produce 135,000 horsepower, the equivalent to 180 Formula 1 cars. Driver Andy Green must allow Bloodhound to decelerate naturally down to 800mph, the highest speed at which he can apply the air brake. At 600mph, he can deploy the parachutes, which will provide 9 tonnes of drag, and the friction brake only at 200mph. What was this article about?","output":"This article is about a super-fast car called Bloodhound SSC, which will try to break the world land speed record by going faster than 1,000 miles per hour! It will be faster than a bullet. The current record is 763 miles per hour, set in 1997. The car has special engines to help it go really fast, and the driver, Andy Green, will sit in a part that looks like an airplane cockpit. They plan to do some practice runs next year and try to break the record in 2016 in a big desert in South Africa."},{"instruction":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

Answer the following question: A friend asked me to answer this question: What was the first names of Tchaikovsky's two biographers?, using the article: Balakirev's despotism strained the relationship between him and Tchaikovsky but both men still appreciated each other's abilities. Despite their friction, Balakirev proved the only man to persuade Tchaikovsky to rewrite a work several times, as he would with Romeo and Juliet. At Balakirev's suggestion, Tchaikovsky based the work on Balakirev's King Lear, a tragic overture in sonata form after the example of Beethoven's concert overtures. It was Tchaikovsky's idea to reduce the plot to one central conflict and represent it musically with the binary structure of sonata form. However, the execution of that plot in the music we know today came only after two radical revisions. Balakirev discarded many of the early drafts Tchaikovsky sent him and, with the flurry of suggestions between the two men, the piece was constantly in the mail between Moscow and Saint Petersburg.Tchaikovsky allowed the first version to be premiered by Nikolai Rubinstein on March 16, 1870, after the composer had incorporated only some of Balakirev's suggestions. The premiere was a disaster. Stung by this rejection, Tchaikovsky took Balakirev's strictures to heart. He forced himself to reach beyond his musical training and rewrote much of the music into the form we know it today. Romeo would bring Tchaikovsky his first national and international acclaim and become a work the kuchka lauded unconditionally. On hearing the love theme from Romeo, Stasov told the group, \\"There were five of you; now there are six\\". Such was the enthusiasm of the Five for Romeo that at their gatherings Balakirev was always asked to play it through at the piano. He did this so many times that he learned to perform it from memory.Some critics, among them Tchaikovsky biographers Lawrence and Elisabeth Hanson, have wondered what would have happened if Tchaikovsky had joined Balakirev in 1862 instead of attending the Conservatory. They suggest that he might have developed much more quickly as an independent composer, and offer as proof the fact that Tchaikovsky did not..., what would be the answer ?

(AP Photo/Evan Vucci) (Associated Press)      WASHINGTON (AP) — Taking a swing at Hillary Clinton, President Donald Trump retweeted a mock video that shows him smacking a golf ball that — in the next frame — seemingly strikes her in the back before she stumbles and falls down while boarding a plane. It's the latest sign that Trump's campaign fury hasn't faded.      Trump retweeted the brief video on his official Twitter account Sunday. It appears to be a doctored version of news footage from 2011 that shows the then-secretary of state falling after climbing the airplane stairs. The re-edited video appears to have superimposed images of a golf ball that is shown hitting Clinton.      The tweet says, \\"Donald Trump's amazing golf swing #CrookedHillary.\\"      A Clinton spokesman declined comment. The White House issued no immediate comment, and Trump aides have said in the past that his tweets \\"speak for themselves.\\" The assessment from Rep. Adam Schiff, D-Calif.: \\"juvenile.\\"      Back in July, Trump vented his rage against the media by posting someone else's doctored anti-CNN video that showed Trump pummeling a man in a business suit — the man's face obscured by the CNN logo — outside a wrestling ring.      Trump has stepped up his criticism of Clinton since the Democratic presidential nominee re-emerged in the spotlight to promote her new book about the 2016 campaign. She is unsparing in her assessment of Trump, calling him \\"a clear and present danger to the country and the world.\\"      The 2016 election is a source of major pride for Trump, who often cites his electoral vote victory as evidence of campaign prowess and popularity with Americans. He is quick to challenge or criticize anything that undercuts that premise. Trump has established a commission to investigate his unsubstantiated claims that millions of people voted illegally in 2016, when Clinton won the popular vote by nearly 2.9 million votes.      \\"It is distressing though to have a president that, frankly, will tweet and retweet things as juvenile as that,\\" Schiff said on ABC's \\"This Week\\" on Sunday. \\"It doesn't help, I think, in terms of his stature. It doesn't help in terms of the stature of our whole country.\\"      Clinton's book assigns blame for her presidential loss on several factors, including interference from Russian hackers, accusations leveled at her by former FBI Director James Comey and even her gender. The White House has criticized the book, with spokeswoman Sarah Huckabee Sanders calling it \\"sad\\" that the last chapter of Clinton's public life will be defined by selling books with \\"false and reckless attacks.\\"      In a pair of tweets last week, Trump took direct aim at Clinton.      \\"Crooked Hillary Clinton blames everybody (and every thing) but herself for her election loss. She lost the debates and lost her direction!\\" Trump wrote.      Referring to Clinton's past description of some Trump supporters, he later tweeted: \\"The 'deplorables' came back to haunt Hillary. They expressed their feelings loud and clear. She spent big money but, in the end, had no game!\\"      ___      Follow Hope Yen on Twitter at https://twitter.com/hopeyen1 ||||| It’s not the first time one of the president’s tweets has made light of violence. Last month he retweeted an image of a train running over a cartoon person with a CNN logo over its head. A White House official said at the time that the tweet had been posted inadvertently, and the image was deleted.      In July, Mr. Trump posted a video of him body slamming a man with a CNN logo superimposed over his head.      The post with the golfing GIF on Sunday was just one of several eclectic tweets that Mr. Trump sent, hours before his trip to New York, where he will address global leaders.      In one, he referred to a conversation with President Moon Jae-in of South Korea. “Asked him how Rocket Man is doing,” Mr. Trump wrote.

Think like you are answering to a five year old. Summarize: And at busy times, this can mean standing in queues or hanging around for ages waiting for the restaurant bill to arrive. All that could be about to change. \\"Payments are vanishing inside apps,\\" explains Dave Birch, a payments expert at Consult Hyperion. \\"That's where all the interesting stuff is going on.\\" Take the Starbucks or Hailo apps for example. They let customers pay for products and services via apps linked to bank services - there's no need for physical interaction with a terminal at all. And at Starbucks, that means you don't have to join a queue for the till before you get your coffee. Apple, Google and Samsung have all anticipated the significance of this and offer in-app payments via their own apps. And MasterCard's Qkr! app, available for both Android and iOS phones - and most types of payment card - enables customers to settle the food and drinks bill without the need to bother staff, saving time and hassle. So far only Wagamama, ASK Italian and Zizzi restaurants have integrated their systems with the Qkr! app, but MasterCard says the Carluccio's chain and Young's brewery pubs will be \\"coming soon\\". The idea that our phones - indispensable, of course - could take on the functionality of our wallets has long been the dream of smartphone makers. And tap-to-pay functionality has certainly been gathering momentum from a slow start. In the UK, contactless payments topped the one billion mark in 2015, according to the UK Card Association. Market research outfit TrendForce is forecasting steady growth in the mobile payments market over the next four years. In the US, big firms like retailer Wal-Mart and bank JPMorgan Chase & Co. are launching mobile payment apps this year. And Android Pay, which allows owners of Android smartphones to tokenise their credit or debit cards and pay with their phones at contactless terminals, will launch in the UK \\"in the next few months\\", promises Google. But services like Android Pay, Apple Pay and Samsung Pay all rely on the contactless payment infrastructure - embedded near-field communication (NFC) chips communicating transaction data with a payment terminal. Yet NFC isn't exactly new technology, and adoption rates for some of these services have not been stellar so far. Plus, US contactless infrastructure lags behind that of Europe. Which is why alternative approaches - such as in-app payments - that do away with the need for point-of-sale hardware completely are causing such excitement. This approach is also being adopted for easy person-to-person payments. For example, Paykey provides a keyboard update for iOS and Android that enables users to send payments to one another while chatting via apps such as Facebook, Twitter, WhatsApp and Instagram. Paykey hasn't launched yet, but founder Daniel Peled explains that the transaction doesn't happen via the messenger app at all - but rather by using the smartphone's onscreen keyboard to direct functions which actually occur within the user's banking app. \\"Everything [the user] can do within the banking app, he can do within the keyboard, our keyboard,\\" he says. The payee doesn't need to have Paykey installed to receive the money - but he or she would need to be a member of the Paym database, which links UK bank accounts to mobile phone numbers. The Paym service currently has 3.2m users. Other person-to-person apps, like Venmo, are also hoping to corner the market for such transactions. And when EU regulation comes into force in 2018 requiring banks to provide access to data for third party app developers, companies like Facebook or Twitter may well start incorporating payment functionality within their own apps. \\"Once you can connect Facebook directly to your bank account, why would you go to your bank app?\\" asks Mr Birch. But there's another issue at stake with mobile payment apps, besides convenience and functionality: security. \\"Mobile apps are miniature web apps, so there are many vulnerabilities associated with those,\\" says Tom Kellermann, chief executive of security investment fund Strategic Cyber Ventures. Around half of mobile payment apps have not had their code effectively audited for security flaws prior to release, he believes. Users are also at risk of having banking credentials stolen after downloading malicious payment apps masquerading as official ones, he warns. Mr Kellermann says his advice to users would include: Security issues aside, there can be no doubt that the smartphone is transforming the way we pay for things and send money to each other. But don't write off cash and cards just yet, says Ann Cairns, president of international markets at MasterCard. She points out that around 85% of the world's transactions are still in cash. \\"And that figure isn't going down,\\" she says. There is also a great deal of costly infrastructure in place to handle card payments, so retailers will be reluctant to jettison all that immediately. But as ever cheaper smartphones come onto the market, mobile payments are only set to grow. Follow Technology of Business editor @matthew_wall on Twitter. Summary:","output":"Right now, when we go to busy places, we sometimes have to wait in lines to pay for things. But soon, our phones might be able to help us skip those lines. Some people who study these things, like Dave Birch, believe that payments are moving into apps, which means paying for things will become faster and easier. When you use apps like the ones from Starbucks or Hailo, they let you pay for things without having to interact with a machine. Big companies like Apple, Google, and Samsung also see how important this is, so they made their own ways to pay in apps. As more people start using their phones to pay, it will change the way we spend money and send it to our friends. But we should also remember to keep our information safe when using these kinds of apps."},{"instruction":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

Article:Six minors are still with top Laos side Champasak United, after it imported 23 under-age players from West Africa to an unregistered football academy in February, global players' union FIFPro told the BBC. Fifa regulations prohibit the movement of players to a foreign club or academy until they are 18. The club, based in the southern city Pakse, denies any wrongdoing. \\"Fifa is in contact with several member associations in order to gather all information to assess the matter and safeguard the interests of the minors,\\" a Fifa spokesperson told the BBC. FIFPro, which has investigated the case for four months and which helped release 17 of the 23 players three months ago, said in a statement it \\"suspects this case is not one of its kind, but probably the tip of the iceberg\\". It has been claimed that Champasak United, a newly-formed club which plays in Laos's top league, intends to profit by selling the players in future. In a clear breach of the world football governing body's rules, the club has fielded overseas players as young as 14 and 15 in league games this season. One 14-year-old player, Liberia's Kesselly Kamara, who scored in a full league game, says he was forced into signing a six-year deal before playing for the senior team. His contract promised him a salary and accommodation, but Kamara says he was never paid and had to sleep on the floor of the club's stadium - as did the rest of the travelling party. \\"It was very bad because you can't have 30 people sleeping in one room,\\" Kamara, who is now playing for a club back home in Liberia's top league, told the BBC. All those who travelled to join the \\"IDSEA Champasak Asia African Football Academy\\" did so after being invited by former Liberia international Alex Karmo, who captained the club at the time. Young players gratefully accepted the invitation, since Liberia lacks a football academy of its own, despite being the only African country to have produced a Fifa World Footballer of the Year - George Weah in 1995. \\"It's a fictitious academy, which was never legally established,\\" said Liberian journalist and sports promoter Wleh Bedell, who led the group to Laos in February but who has since returned. \\"It's an 'academy' that has no coach nor doctor. Karmo was the coach, the business manager, everything. It was completely absurd.\\" Following initial pressure from both FIFPro and Fifa, Champasak released 17 teenagers from the original party, with Kamara among them, by early April. But six minors chose to remain. FIFPro says that all have since signed contracts presented to them by Karmo, who describes himself as a \\"manager for players from Africa in Champasak\\", and club president Phonesavanh Khieulavong. \\"Today we have criminal activists threatening world football and the young players, so it's important to work together. Fifa will have to be on top of this battle\\" Anti-trafficking campaigner Jean-Claude Mbvounim Can Fifa end child trafficking? These appear to allow Champasak to pay the boys nothing at all, while also demanding that unrealistic conditions be met should the teenagers want to leave. Karmo says the players are fed three times a day and paid every month. \\"We don't give the [minors] professional contracts, just a contract that gives them bonuses,\\" Khieulavong told the BBC. Neither Khieulavong nor Karmo denied the presence of minors at the academies, although Karmo claimed there was just one - a 16-year-old from Guinea. The BBC understands there are five more minors from Liberia at the club. Along with eight senior players (six Liberians, a Ghanaian and Sierra Leonean), all are living in conditions described as \\"deplorable and disturbing\\" by Bedell. For five months, they have been sleeping on meagre mattresses in a vast room that lacks any glass on its windows and a lock on the door. \\"It's hard to live in a place with no windows. It made sleeping very difficult, because you are thinking about your life,\\" said Kamara. \\"Players are in this wild place that is reminiscent of the civil crisis in Liberia when people left their homes and were displaced, [taking shelter] in a makeshift building or auditorium,\\" Bedell, who experienced his country's civil wars of 1989-96 and 1999-2003, told the BBC. The minors' freedom of movement is restricted by the fact that they became illegal immigrants in March after their visas ran out. They are hoping to receive work permits but these are unlikely to arrive since all are underage. Karmo, who insists that he did pay Kamara, admits nine of the 14 Africans do not have work permits but asserts that they have the right documentation to stay in Laos. \\"Nobody is illegal. Everybody is legal,\\" he told the BBC. With the club having held their passports since their arrival, the boys rarely leave the stadium where they both live and train twice a day. Despite the situation, not everyone wants the minors to leave Laos. \\"I don't want him to come back to Liberia until he succeeds in his dream,\\" said Bella Tapeh, the mother of one 17-year-old still in Pakse. Some of those who have returned to Liberia have told the BBC they were poorly fed, rarely paid and received no medical assistance from the club despite contracting malaria and typhoid because of the conditions. One also described their existence at Champasak United as akin to \\"slave work\\". \\"This is a very serious situation,\\" Stephane Burchkalter, a FIFPro official, told the BBC. \\"It is shocking to FIFPro that a club from Laos, which - with all due respect - is a very small football country, can lure minor players from Liberia without Fifa noticing.\\" One NGO, Culture Foot Solidaire, estimates that 15,000 teenage footballers are moved out of West Africa every year - many of them illegally. FIFPro has also called on Fifa to take action against the Laos Football Federation, which has so far failed to discipline Champasak for its alleged breach of the rules. Evidence of clubs breaking regulations on signing international players under 18 is rare but European champions Barcelona are currently serving a transfer ban for this very offence. Meanwhile, the parents of 12 boys found themselves in financial difficulty after taking loans to pay 550 towards the cost of the trip to Laos, with one case currently in the hands of Liberian police. There are three exceptions to Fifa's rules on the movement of players under the age of 18, but none of them apply in this case. A summary of the above article is?","output":"Sure, sweetie. This is a story about a soccer team in a place called Laos. This team, named Champasak United, asked a bunch of kids from another place called West Africa to come play soccer for them. But, they broke some rules because they moved the kids, who are younger than 18, to a different country, which is against the rules set by FIFA. FIFA is like a big boss who makes sure everyone plays soccer fairly and nicely. The team is in trouble as it's not treating these kids well. A boy named Kesselly Kamara, who is only 14 years old, said he had to live in not-so-nice conditions and they didn't pay him as promised when he signed up. There were kids who got to leave, but there are still some young players stuck there. These kids want to get better at soccer and had hoped that going to this soccer team in Laos would help them, but it turned out to be not what they expected.  So, this story is about how even the love for soccer should be fair and protective of everyone, especially when it comes to young kids who dream of becoming good players. It's also about the need for the big bosses at FIFA to keep a close eye on teams everywhere to make sure they're treating major and minor players well."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Math Problem Solve 122*b = -275*b + 76*b - 4494 for b.","output":"Step 1: Combine the like terms on the right side of the equation. Given the equation: 122 * b = -275 * b + 76 * b - 4494 Right side will become: (-275 * b + 76 * b) - 4494 -275 * b and 76 * b are like terms because they both have \\"b\\" as their variable. We can add their coefficients: -275 + 76 = -199 Now the right side becomes: -199 * b - 4494 So, the updated equation is: 122 * b = -199 * b - 4494 Step 2: Isolate the variable \\"b\\" In order to isolate \\"b\\", we need to move all terms with \\"b\\" on one side of the equation. Let's move -199 * b to the left side of the equation by adding 199 * b to both sides: (122 * b) + (199 * b) = (-199 * b) - 4494 + (199 * b) On the right side, -199 * b and + 199 * b will cancel each other out (they sum up to 0), and on the left side we need to add the coefficients of both terms: 122 + 199 = 321 Now, the equation becomes: 321 * b = -4494 Step 3: Solve for \\"b\\" To solve for \\"b\\", we need to isolate it. We can do this by dividing both sides of the equation by 321: (321 * b) / 321 = -4494 / 321 On the left side, the 321 in the numerator and the denominator will cancel each other out (321 / 321 = 1), leaving us with: b = -4494 / 321 Step 4: Simplify the fraction Now let's simply the fraction -4494 / 321: b ≈ -14 So, b is approximately equal to -14."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

How is \\"The investigation lasted eight months.\\" said in Turkish?","output":"\\"The investigation lasted eight months\\" can be translated into Turkish as \\"Soruşturma sekiz ay sürdü.\\" To provide more context and further explanation: In Turkish, the order of words in a sentence is often Subject-Object-Verb (SOV), whereas it is usually Subject-Verb-Object (SVO) in English. In this case, \\"the investigation\\" is the subject (soruşturma), \\"eight months\\" is the object (sekiz ay), and \\"lasted\\" is the verb (sürdü). Let's break down the Turkish sentence: 1. Soruşturma: This word translates to \\"investigation\\" in English. It is a noun that refers to the process of examining a situation or event to uncover facts or determine the truth. 2. Sekiz: This word translates to \\"eight\\" in English, which is a number used to quantify the duration of the investigation. 3. Ay: This word translates to \\"month\\" in English. In this context, it refers to the unit of time that the investigation lasted. In Turkish, when a number is used to quantify something, it is placed just before the noun it is quantifying, without the need for a preposition (unlike in English where we use \\"for\\" in this context). 4. Sürdü: This word is the past tense form of the verb \\"sürmek,\\" which means \\"to last\\" or \\"to continue.\\" In this context, \\"sürdü\\" indicates that the action of the investigation lasting or continuing happened in the past. So, when we put all of these words together in the correct Turkish syntax, we get \\"Soruşturma sekiz ay sürdü,\\" which is a direct translation of \\"The investigation lasted eight months\\" in English."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

First he visited London. To his dismay, it was overcast all night. Then he flew to Rome. There the sky was as clear as you could get at night. David was very happy about it.  In which place the Earth's surface would cool down slower, London or Rome?  Hint: Because of its temperature, the atmosphere emits infrared radiation. For example, on clear nights Earth's surface cools down faster than on cloudy nights. This is because clouds (H2O) are strong absorbers and emitters of infrared radiation. This is also why it becomes colder at night at higher elevations. A:","output":"The Earth's surface would cool down slower in London, where it was overcast all night.

Q: Answer the following question given this paragraph:      Q: In atherosclerosis, thickening of an arterial wall due to this can restrict blood flow through the artery?   A: Pick from: +low blood pressure. +high blood pressure. +digestion. +plaque formation. A:","output":"In atherosclerosis, the thickening of an arterial wall due to plaque formation can restrict blood flow through the artery. Atherosclerosis is a progressive condition in which fatty deposits, mainly composed of cholesterol, calcium, and other substances, accumulate on the inner walls and form plaque. Over time, these plaques may become larger and thicker, leading to a narrowing of the arterial lumen and a reduction in blood flow. High blood pressure, also known as hypertension, is considered a significant risk factor for developing atherosclerosis. It can cause damage to the arterial walls, making them more susceptible to plaque formation. As the arteries become narrower, the heart has to work harder to pump blood, which in turn increases blood pressure even more. This cycle can lead to a variety of complications, including heart attacks, strokes, and peripheral artery disease. Low blood pressure is not directly related to the development of atherosclerosis but may be a consequence of advanced atherosclerosis when blood flow is significantly reduced. Digestion is not directly related to the development of atherosclerosis. However, a diet high in saturated fats and cholesterol can contribute to the formation of plaques in the arteries. In summary, atherosclerosis is characterized by the thickening of arterial walls due to plaque formation, which restricts blood flow through the artery. High blood pressure is a significant risk factor for developing this condition, while low blood pressure and digestion are not directly tied to atherosclerosis, although lifestyle and dietary habits may also play a role in its development."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant that follows instruction extremely well.

Question: Read the following context and choose the correct option to answer the question. Context: Manny had Bob Marley cranking on the stereo, his van was full of passengers, and the air conditioning was working after a long week of giving him trouble. The sun beat down on the wet-looking asphalt road that ran along the harbor, next to the concrete waterfront. It curved along in front of the brightly colored Dutch Colonial warehouses of Charlotte Amalie, which were now converted restaurants and jewel shops. Tourists in day-glo shirts and daubs of sunscreen rubbed over peeling skin crowded both sides of the waterfront road. Manny slowed somewhat, keeping an eye on them. On the sidewalk by the shops a tall black man stood by a food cart. The hand-painted wooden sign hanging from the cart's side had faded letters. The man wore a grand suit with tails, like an orchestra conductor, and a top hat perched on his shaved head. A cigar burned in his mouth. For a brief second he held Manny's attention. Then the food cart's owner stepped forward and the strangely dressed man disappeared. Manny looked at the other side of the road. A white girl with oval shaped sunglasses and pink leather pants stepped off the sidewalk into the road in front of his van. He slammed on the brakes, trying to dodge her, but the van couldn't respond that fast. Her ponytail flew up towards the windshield and her head struck the star-shaped hood ornament. She bounced along the asphalt. Manny weaved the van to a stop, with swearing from the passengers in the back. He opened the door and stepped out into the heat. Get up, stand up, the radio cried out, and that was what Manny hoped would happen. He hoped that she would at least just stir and be okay. But she just lay there. Question: Where was Manny driving?

Question: Who is the producer who assists in making the film? Title: Udayananu Tharam Movie plot: Udayananu Tharam is the story of Udayabhanu (Mohanlal), a worshipper of films and an immensely talented assistant film director, who yearns to write and direct his own movie at a time when the industry is filled with dubious filmmakers. Rajappan Thengummoodu (Sreenivasan) is a rather crooked friend of Udayabhanu and an aspiring and failed actor. As Udayabhanu finally prepares to shoot his first movie based on his own script, he discovers to his horror that Rajappan has stolen his manuscript, and shooting is underway with Rajappan playing the lead, which eventually propels him to stardom. Udhayabhanu soon finds himself faced with a career and personal crisis, with his faltering relations with his superstar wife Madhumati (Meena Durairaj) contributing to the latter. Later, with the help of producer Babykuttan (Mukesh), Udayabanu prepares to direct another film, but he is forced to cast Rajappan as the hero since he was the star with most screen value at that time. Rajappan takes up the offer, since he is also at a plateau of his career, but refuses to co-operate and throws tantrums and causes maximum trouble when possible. He spends most of his time actively flirting with the actresses in the film. Towards the end of the shoot - using a perceived insult as a ruse, Rajappan leaves the set leaving the movie unfinished with the hope that this will destroy Udayabanu's career for ever. But Udayabanu devises clever tactics and shoots the remaining scenes with Rajappan without him even being aware of it.

We can also term it as \\"self-raising\\". In slow parenting children are allowed to do what they think proper and parents just keep a watch over the child. Curiosity of the child leads to exploring and discovering things. Parents provide little help only when it's too necessary, otherwise keep themselves away from the child and just have a look on him/her: This brings about a feeling of self-dependency and they are encouraged to solve their problems. This is a natural way of learning. When a child is left to learn in a natural environment, the child's natural development takes place. Influence of any materialistic way doesn't let the mind develop naturally. Watching TV, playing video games or joining classes of dance, swimming or any other sports will not let the mind develop naturally. Here creativity of their mind is developed. They explore ideas. The logic behind this is that the kids of animals learn by nature, so can our kids. So let our children play in the garden, to watch flowers, plants, birds, butterflies and other gifts of nature. In the classes of dance, swimming etc. their creativity is influenced and their natural creativity is suppressed  . In these classes they are overburdened and can't train their creativity. So let them play in the open air or garden without any burden instead of joining classes. Generally parents give toys to their children and explain how to operate them. But those parents who believe in slow parenting give toys and observe how the children are managing them. Their skill to learn and understand comes out. Maybe the process is slow, but it will be their exploration, which will make them self-dependent, and self-capable to learn. In slow parenting, parents    _   . A) set limits to what their children do B) keep a close watch over their children C) give the whole directions to what their children do D) give their children freedom to do what they think proper The answer to this question is:","output":"D) give their children freedom to do what they think proper. Slow parenting is based on the principle of allowing children to learn and grow at their own pace, without excessive interference from parents or external sources. In this approach, parents provide a supportive and nurturing environment where their children can explore and discover things on their own, guided by their interests and curiosity. Parents who practice slow parenting understand the value of self-directed learning and the importance of giving their children the freedom to make their own choices and decisions. They believe that by allowing their children to pursue their passions, they are fostering a sense of self-reliance, confidence, and creativity. In slow parenting, parents act as observers and guides, stepping in only when necessary to provide assistance or set boundaries for safety. They trust the natural development of their children and believe that they possess the innate ability to learn and grow in a healthy and organic way. This approach contrasts with more traditional, structured methods, where parents may set strict schedules and impose numerous rules and expectations on their children. By choosing option D, parents who practice slow parenting give their children the freedom to explore the world around them, to make mistakes, and to learn from their experiences. This ultimately empowers the children to become resilient, resourceful, and independent individuals who are better equipped to navigate the challenges of life."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Background: Dorothy Jane Roberts (May 8, 1929 - September 5, 1984) was an American author, poet, self-proclaimed psychic, and spirit medium, who claimed to channel an energy personality who called himself \\"Seth.\\" Her publication of the Seth texts, known as the Seth Material, established her as one of the preeminent figures in the world of paranormal phenomena. The Yale University Library Manuscripts and Archives maintains a collection entitled Jane Roberts Papers (MS 1090), which documents the career and personal life of Jane Roberts, including journals, poetry, correspondence, audio and video recordings, and other materials donated after her death by Roberts' husband and other individuals and organizations. Context: Seth's effect upon New Age thinkers has been profound. The title jacket of \\"The Nature of Personal Reality, A Seth Book,\\" published in 1994 (Amber-Allen/New World Library), contains testimonials from some of the most notable thinkers and writers within the movement. Marianne Williamson, Deepak Chopra, Shakti Gawain, Dan Millman, Louise Hay, Richard Bach, and others express the effect the Seth Material had upon their own awakening. In words similar to Williamson's they state: \\"Seth was one of my first metaphysical teachers. He remains a constant source of knowledge and inspiration in my life.\\" Catherine L. Albanese, professor of religious history at the University of Chicago, stated that in the 1970s the Seth Material \\"launched an era of nationwide awareness\\" of the channeling trend. She believes it contributed to the \\"self-identity of an emergent New Age movement and also augment[ed] its ranks.\\"  John P. Newport, in his study of the impact of New Age beliefs on contemporary culture, described the central focus of the Seth material as the idea that, for each individual: \\"you create your own reality.\\" (Briefly summarized, our beliefs generate emotions which trigger our memories and organize our associations. Eventually those beliefs become manifested in our physical lives and health.) Newport wrote that this foundational concept of the New Age movement was first developed in the \\"Seth Material.\\" Historian Robert C. Fuller, a professor of religious studies at Bradley University, wrote that Seth filled the role of guide for what Fuller called \\"unchurched American spirituality,\\" related to concepts of reincarnation, karma, free will, ancient metaphysical wisdom, and \\"Christ consciousness.\\"  Some writers noted, \\"Husband Robert Butts stated that similarities exist between Seth's ideas and those of various religious, philosophical, and mystical doctrines from the Near, Middle, or Far East... and we've done a little reading on Buddhism, Hinduism, Zen, and Taoism, for example, not to mention subjects like shamanism, voodooism, and obeah.\\"  The late amateur physicist Michael Talbot wrote, \\"To my great surprise--and slight annoyance--I found that Seth eloquently and lucidly articulated a view of reality that I had arrived at only after great effort and an extensive study of both paranormal phenomena and quantum physics.\\" Question: What did this have to been. Whats the answer?","output":"The question seems to be seeking clarification on the significance and impact of the Seth Material, channeled by Jane Roberts, on New Age thinking and other fields of study.  The answer can be summarized as follows: 1. The Seth Material, with its core message of \\"you create your own reality,\\" played a crucial role in shaping the central beliefs of the New Age movement. 2. Many prominent figures in the New Age movement, such as Marianne Williamson, Deepak Chopra, Shakti Gawain, and others, credit Seth as a source of knowledge and inspiration. 3. The Seth Material helped launch the era of nationwide awareness of the channeling trend and contributed to the self-identity and expansion of the New Age movement, according to Catherine L. Albanese. 4. Historian Robert C. Fuller describes Seth's teachings as aligning with \\"unchurched American spirituality,\\" connected to ideas such as reincarnation, karma, free will, ancient wisdom, and \\"Christ consciousness.\\" 5. There are similarities between Seth's teachings and various religious, philosophical, and mystical doctrines from the Near, Middle, and Far East, acknowledged by Jane Roberts' husband, Robert Butts. 6. Late amateur physicist Michael Talbot found that Seth's view of reality matched his own understanding after an extensive study of paranormal phenomena and quantum physics. In conclusion, the Seth Material by Jane Roberts has had a significant impact on the New Age movement and has been influential for both prominent thinkers and individuals interested in spirituality, metaphysics, and the nature of reality."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Scout and Jem's mother died before Scout could remember her, Mayella's mother is dead, and Mrs. Radley is silent about Boo's confinement to the house. Apart from Atticus, the fathers described are abusers. Bob Ewell, it is hinted, molested his daughter, and Mr. Radley imprisons his son in his house until Boo is remembered only as a phantom. Bob Ewell and Mr. Radley represent a form of masculinity that Atticus does not, and the novel suggests that such men as well as the traditionally feminine hypocrites at the Missionary Society can lead society astray. Atticus stands apart as a unique model of masculinity; as one scholar explains: \\"It is the job of real men who embody the traditional masculine qualities of heroic individualism, bravery, and an unshrinking knowledge of and dedication to social justice and morality, to set the society straight.\\" The answer to this question is:","output":"Atticus.

Barjatya after the movie Main Prem Ki Deewani hoon, then a year back now I saw promos for Vivah which looked good. But I didn't want to waste my hard earned money watching it in cinema. When the film first came out on DVD I rented it and watched and I loved the movie and took back my words for Sooraj. I just finished watching it yesterday again and this time I thought I have to review this movie. Sooraj R. BarjatyaGot it right this time, okay I was not a huge fan of Hum App Ke Hai Kaun. But I have always loved Manie Pyar kiya, after Manie Pyar kiya to me I think Vivah is Barjatyas best work. I hardly ever cry in a movie but this movie made me feel like crying. If you have ever been in love before then there will be many moments that will touch you in this movie, the movie is just too sweet and will have you falling in love with it, my view a much underrated movie. The story of this movie you might call desi and very old times, but to me it seemed modern because the two couples which are getting an arrange marriage are aware it's an old tradition. It's done in present times, lots of people don't believe in this arrange marriage, but I do. The journey between the engagement and wedding which will always be special and this movie shows it clearly. When Prem meets Poonam for the first time, they show it how it is and that's reality and my parents where saying that's how they got married and it showed it in a way which is so real yes people the way Prem and Poonam meet in this movie is how most marriages happen. It was a very sweet, you feel nervous yet excited, the song \\"Do Ajnabe\\" shows that very well. Getting back to the story yes it's a journey which you soon get glued to between Prem and Poonam (Shahid Kapoor and Amrita Rao) and there families. A twist occurs in this movie which is really good, the last 30mins you all will be reaching for the tissue box. What makes this film so amazing is the chemistry between Prem and Poonam, how they fall for each other is too sweet. Simple boy and Simple Girl, when they first meet during and after the song \\"Do Anjane Ajnabe\\" It's very sweet to watch, She hardly says anything and Prem does all the talking being honest with her about his past and the girl he liked and him smoking. Then it leads on to them all having a family trip and then that's when they really do fall for each other. It makes you just want to watch the couple and watch all the sweet moments they have. Another factor is that Poonam chichi is really mean to her and you feel sorry for Poonam because she has been treated bad and makes you want to see her happy and when she finally finds happiness, you too start feeling happy with her the movie basically makes you fall in love with Poonam more then just Prem. When she finds happiness through Prem you want her to stay happy and also hope nothing goes wrong because the character is shown as a sweet simple girl. Which brings me to performances and Amrita Roa as Poonam is amazing in the movie, her best work till date you will fall in love with this innocent character and root her on to find happiness. Shahid Kapoor as Prem is amazing too, he is Poonam support in the film, he is her happiness the movie, together they share an amazing chemistry and I have never seen a cuter couple since SRK and Kajol. If Ishq Vishk didn't touch you to telling you how cute they are together this surely will. \\"Mujhe Haq hai\\" the song and before that is amazing chemistry they show. Scenes which touched me was when Prem takes Poonam to his room and shows her that's where they will be staying and he opens her up and they have a moment between them which is too sweet. Again if you have ever been in love with someone that much these scenes you can defiantly connect to. The film is just the sweetest thing you will see ever. The direction is spot on, to me a good movie is basically something that can pull me in and stop me believe for this hours what is being seen here is fake and there is a camera filing them. To me this film pulled me in and for those three hours I felt really connected to the movie.

When you plug it in it only gets better I am not sorry I bought this! Not one bit it is amazing!!!!!!! Would you say this review depicts the product in a flattering or unflattering light? A:","output":"This review certainly depicts the product in a flattering light. The reviewer expresses their satisfaction and enthusiasm for the guitar they bought by using emphatic words and phrases, such as \\"amazing\\" and \\"not sorry I bought this.\\" Additionally, the reviewer highlights several aspects of the product and the purchasing experience that contributed to their positive perception. Firstly, the reviewer mentions that they paid 700 for the guitar, which is a relatively significant investment for a musical instrument. By sharing this information, the reviewer indirectly indicates that the guitar is of high quality and possibly justifies its price. Secondly, the reviewer compliments the store for setting up the guitar before they purchased it. This suggests that the store provided excellent customer service, which may positively influence potential buyers' perception of both the retailer and the product. When discussing the guitar's performance, the reviewer states, \\"When you plug it in, it only gets better,\\" implying that the sound and overall experience of using the guitar exceed their expectations. This statement underscores the guitar's exceptional performance, which is a key factor for buyers when deciding on a musical instrument. Finally, the reviewer's repeated use of exclamation marks and enthusiastic wording conveys their excitement and satisfaction with the product. This further strengthens the positive image of the guitar, as potential buyers may assume that if someone is this enthusiastic about their purchase, the product must be worth considering. In conclusion, this review paints the guitar in a highly flattering light, emphasizing the positive aspects such as excellent customer service from the store, the product's high quality and performance, and the reviewer's sheer satisfaction with their purchase. This favorable review can significantly impact potential buyers' perception of the guitar and may be influential in their decision-making process."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

The use of \\"no\\" at the beginning may allude to the reviewer countering a negative assumption or idea about the movie. The following phrase, \\"i love it,\\" clearly demonstrates a positive sentiment towards the movie, expressing enjoyment and appreciation for it. Adding the word \\"hell\\" before the next statement intensifies the emotion of the speaker, displaying that they have strong positive feelings about the movie. However, the concluding phrase, \\"I dunno,\\" introduces an element of doubt or uncertainty regarding their own feelings or reasons for loving it. This may indicate that the reviewer is experiencing confusion about the source of their affection or can't pinpoint what specific aspects of the movie evoke their strong emotions. Overall, the sentiment leans more towards the positive end of the spectrum, as the sentence primarily highlights the reviewer's love for the movie.

Write a summary based on this article: For more than 10 years, it was something Mindy McGillivray said she shared only with a close circle of family and friends.      That changed Sunday night. Donald Trump was asked during the presidential debate about when he bragged that he kissed women without their consent and grabbed their genitals – remarks captured on audio that surfaced last week.      Photographer Ken Davidoff and his friend, Mindy McGillivray, at Mar-a-Lago on Jan. 24, 2003.      News | WFXT      Trump apologized for the remarks and dismissed them as “locker room talk.” But the debate moderator, CNN’s Anderson Cooper, asked Trump to clarify: “Have you ever done those things?”      “No, I have not,’’ Trump replied.      Watching at home in Palm Springs, McGillivray said she rose from her couch and yelled at the TV screen: “‘You liar!’’’      Read more of The Palm Beach Post's coverage of Donald Trump      McGillivray, 36, said she was groped by Trump at Mar-a-Lago 13 years ago. She said she never reported it to authorities.      Many McGillivray says she is leaving country      But her companion that day, photographer Ken Davidoff, vividly remembers when McGillivray pulled him aside moments after the alleged incident and told him, ‘’Donald just grabbed my ass!’’      The New York Times reported Wednesday that two other women came forward to say Trump groped them — one who sat next to him on a flight 30 years ago and another who encountered him outside an elevator at Trump Tower.      The Post has reached out to the Trump campaign for comment about McGillivray’s story.      More Trump news: Trump sex-brag tape released on eve of second debate | Heartland verdict: Trump’s still in it      According to Davidoff, it was Jan. 24, 2003, when he and his father, the late Palm Beach society photographer Bob Davidoff, took photos at Mar-a-Lago during a concert by Ray Charles. Bob Davidoff for years was the Kennedys’ favored photographer in Palm Beach.      Ken Davidoff said he brought his friend McGillivray to help him during the concert. Her job was to keep numbered name plates of everyone the Davidoffs photographed.      The Davidoffs were the official photographers of Mar-a-Lago, a deal they got only after Trump demanded he get 20 percent of their proceeds, Ken Davidoff said.      McGillivray, who was 23 at the time, said it was one of five or six times she helped Davidoff on photo shoots at Mar-a-Lago.      “Ken says, ‘We’re going to get backstage. Ray Charles is going to be there.’ He was one of my idols,’’ she recalled. “Ken wanted to get a picture of me and Ray, but that didn’t happen because he had all these bodyguards.’’      After the show, Davidoff and McGillivray were standing in a pavilion behind the main house in the middle of a group of people. To their left was Regis Philbin and his wife, Joy, according to Davidoff. To McGillivray’s immediate right was Trump and his fiancée, Melania.      “Ray already performed. He’s ready to leave. He’s saying his goodbyes to everyone,’’ McGillivray recalled.      “All of a sudden I felt a grab, a little nudge. I think it’s Ken’s camera bag, that was my first instinct. I turn around and there’s Donald. He sort of looked away quickly. I quickly turned back, facing Ray Charles, and I’m stunned.’’      McGillivray said she remembers saying to herself, ‘’‘OK, am I going to say something now and make a scene or be quiet?’ I chose to stay quiet.’’      Davidoff said he did not witness the alleged groping but he said he has never had any reason to doubt McGillivray.      Asked about the possibility that what she felt was Trump or someone accidentally bumping into her, McGillivray said no. “This was a pretty good nudge. More of a grab,’’ she said. “It was pretty close to the center of my butt. I was startled. I jumped.’’      She said she had had another encounter with Trump about two years earlier at Mar-a-Lago, when she helped Davidoff photograph a New Year’s Eve party in 2001.      She was walking out of a restroom “and Donald caught me right before I headed downstairs. He goes, ‘It’s a cool evening, isn’t it?’’’ she said, mocking his voice. “He had this debonair tone. He was totally flirting,’’ she said.      “And then here comes Melania to save the day. She sees me. She had this shawl on because it was cold on New Year’s. And she whips the shawl behind her neck and storms off into the bathroom. I made a quick pivot and went straight downstairs and he went after her.’’      Related: Full presidential election coverage            After the alleged groping incident, McGillivray never encountered Trump again. She said the incident is something she and her family and the Davidoffs would bring up periodically over the years, sometimes joking about it.      When Trump entered the presidential race, she said she started telling the story to more friends. One day last week, Davidoff came across a photo his father took that night in 2003 of Trump and Charles.      “He sent it to me and was like, ‘Remember that night?’ ‘Oh, yeah. I remember that night,’’’ McGillivray said.      When Trump told Cooper during the debate Sunday that he never groped a woman, McGillivray said she started to consider sharing her story. With Davidoff’s help, she reached out separately to The Palm Beach Post and to a Hillary Clinton campaign office on Lake Worth Road.      She knows her past may be scrutinized. She told The Post she has numerous traffic infractions over the years and two felony arrests. She was arrested when she was 17 for breaking into a school and got probation. And in 2012, she was arrested on DUI and child neglect charges because a child was in the car. She was adjudicated guilty of a misdemeanor.      She is registered to vote as having no party affiliation. She said she would have loved to see Bernie Sanders win the Democratic nomination but she will vote for Clinton.      It’s important “to set a good example for my daughter,’’ she told The Post. “It’s a respect issue for all women. If something like this happens to you, you should speak up.’’      Staff researcher Melanie Mena contributed to this story. ||||| The New York Times' general counsel has just informed Donald Trump's lawyer, in scathing terms, that it will not retract its story about two women who claim that Trump touched them inappropriately.      In a letter to Trump attorney Marc E. Kasowitz sent Thursday, New York Times general counsel David McCraw wrote, of the request that the Times retract the story, \\"We decline to do so.\\"      McCraw then laid into Kasowitz and his client, writing, \\"The essence of a libel claim, of course, is the protection of one's reputation. Mr. Trump has bragged about his non-consensual sexual touching of women. He has bragged about intruding on beauty pageant contestants in their dressing rooms. He acquiesced to a radio host's request to discuss Mr. Trump's own daughter as a 'piece of ass.' Multiple women not mentioned in our article have publicly come forward to report on Mr. Trump's unwanted advances.\\"      He continued: \\"Nothing in our article has had the slightest effect on the reputation that Mr. Trump, through his own words and actions, has already created for himself.\\"      Times sources told CNNMoney there were spontaneous bursts of applause for McCraw when he walked through the paper's newsroom on Thursday afternoon.      Related: Read full letter by the New York Times      Trump said at a Thursday afternoon rally in Florida that \\"we are preparing\\" a suit against The Times.      Nothing has been filed yet. \\"Lawyers are doing the due diligence needed to file such a massive suit,\\" a Trump campaign official said on condition of anonymity.      Legal experts have doubts that Trump will actually file such a suit.      The Times story featured two women, Jessica Leeds and Rachel Crooks, who said that Trump made inappropriate physical advances on them. CNN has not been able to independently confirm their accounts.      When Times reporter Megan Twohey interviewed Trump by phone Tuesday night, \\"he threatened to sue us if we published these allegations,\\" Twohey told CNNMoney. She quoted Trump as saying that \\"none of this ever took place.\\" She said Trump shouted at her and called her \\"a disgusting human being.\\"      Twohey also received a legal letter from a Trump attorney Wednesday afternoon. The Times published the story online shortly before 7 p.m. Eastern.      \\"I think it is pretty evident this story falls clearly in the realm of public service journalism, and discussing issues that arose from the tape and his comments since it surfaced,\\" Times executive editor Dean Baquet told CNNMoney.      The legal threats continued Wednesday night. \\"NYT editors, reporters, politically motivated accusers better lawyer up,\\" a Trump campaign official said.      Shortly after midnight Thursday, a lawyer representing Trump, Marc E. Kasowitz, sent a letter to Baquet saying \\"your article is reckless, defamatory and constitutes libel per se.\\"      \\"We hereby demand that you immediately cease any further publication of this article, remove it from your website and issue a full and immediate retraction and apology. Failure to do so will leave my client with no option but to purse all available actions and remedies,\\" Kasowitz wrote.      The letter lacks any substantive facts to cast doubt on the Times story, and is not a lawsuit.      In his response to Kasowitz, McCraw -- who canceled his \\"annual update on newsroom law\\" session that he was going to hold for staffers on Thursday -- also wrote, \\"The women quoted in our story spoke out on an issue of national importance -- indeed, an issue that Mr. Trump himself discussed with the whole nation watching during Sunday night's presidential debate.... It would have been a disservice not just to our readers but to democracy itself to silence their voices.... If Mr. Trump disagrees, if he believes that American citizens had no right to hear what these women had to say and that the law of this country forces us and those who would dare to criticize him to stand silent or be punished, we welcome the opportunity to have a court set him straight.\\"      What might happen next?      Along with the potential suit against the Times, high-ranking sources within the Trump campaign also said they were \\"drafting\\" a lawsuit against The Palm Beach Post, which published a separate story.      A lawyer for Trump similarly threatened to sue The Times when it published several pages of his 1995 tax return earlier this month, but did not follow through.      If the Trump campaign does proceed with lawsuits in this case, it would be a break from past practice, and it will give both the Times and the Post the opportunity to pursue discovery and request information on Trump's entire sexual history, because Trump would have the burden of proving falsity and actual malice.      In the Times story, Leeds alleges that Trump, whom she says she had never met before, grabbed her breasts and tried to put his hand up her skirt while the two were on an airplane more than three decades ago. Crooks, who worked in Trump Tower at a company that Trump did not own, says Trump kissed her outside an elevator after she introduced herself. The Post features a woman named Mindy McGillivray who says she was groped by Trump at Mar-a-Lago when she was 23.      Twohey said Crooks, who was was initially reluctant to speak publicly, reached out to the newspaper after it published a story in May titled \\"Crossing the Line: How Donald Trump Behaved With Women in Private.\\"      Leeds, the other woman in the Times article, contacted the newspaper after Sunday's debate, when Trump was asked by CNN's Anderson Cooper if he had ever done the things he described in that video.      \\"No, I have not,\\" Trump said.      Michael Barbaro, who co-bylined the story with Twohey, tweeted Wednesday night, \\"This story might not have happened unless @andersoncooper had asked the pointed questions he did at debate.\\"      The Times report comes in the wake of the release of a 2005 recording in which Trump boasted about being able to kiss women and grope them in ways that would amount to sexual assault.      In a statement on the Times' report earlier on Wednesday night, Trump spokesman Jason Miller said the \\"entire article is fiction.\\"      \\"For the New York Times to launch a completely false, coordinated character assassination against Mr. Trump on a topic like this is dangerous,\\" Miller said in the statement. \\"To reach back decades in an attempt to smear Mr. Trump trivializes sexual assault, and it sets a new low for where the media is willing to go in its efforts to determine this election.\\"      Late Wednesday night, People Magazine also published a report by one of its writers, Natasha Stoynoff, in which she alleged that she had been physically attacked by Trump at Mar-a-Lago while writing a profile on Trump's one-year wedding anniversary to his wife Melania. CNN has not been able to independently confirm her account.      The Trump campaign did not respond to request for comment regarding that story, but a Trump spokesperson told People, \\"This never happened. There is no merit or veracity to this fabricated story.\\"      On Thursday morning, Trump also took to Twitter to say, \\"Why didn't the writer of the twelve year old article in People Magazine mention the 'incident' in her story. Because it did not happen!\\"      A lawyer for Melania Trump sent a letter to People, demanding only that certain lines be removed from the story. Those sentences depicted a friendly encounter between Mrs. Trump, her son Baron and Stoynoff some time after the alleged incident with Trump.      Melania Trump's lawyers insist that the encounter never happened and want that section of the story retracted and an apology issued.      People Magazine editor-in-chief Jess Cagle responded in a statement, writing, \\"We are grateful to Natasha Stoynoff for telling her story. Ms. Stoynoff is a remarkable, ethical, honest and patriotic woman, and she has shared her story of being physically attacked by Donald Trump in 2005 because she felt it was her duty to make the public aware. To assign any other motive is a disgusting, pathetic attempt to victimize her again. We stand steadfastly by her, and are proud to publish her clear, credible account of what happened.\\" ||||| Summary:","output":"Mindy McGillivray claims she was groped by Donald Trump 13 years ago at Mar-a-Lago when she was doing work as an assistant for a photographer at an event.

Let's break down the two questions to better understand their nuances: 1. What do you know at 70 that you wish you knew at 45? This question specifically targets an individual who is currently 70 years old or older. It prompts them to reflect on the knowledge and insights they have gained in the past 25 years and to consider which ones of those they wish they had had when they were 45 years old. The age gap mentioned highlights the idea that a considerable amount of learning and life experiences have occurred between these two points, which might have led to new realizations and understandings about life, relationships, career, health, and personal growth. 2. What one thing do you wish you had known about life when you were in your 20s? This question focuses on the lessons that people wish they had known earlier in life, specifically during their 20s. This is a more generalized inquiry that does not require the individual to necessarily be at any specific older age. Instead, it invites people of all ages to share a piece of wisdom they wish they had known during their 20s, which might have significantly influenced their life choices, decisions, and paths. This could encompass various aspects of life, such as relationships, career, finances, and personal development. In conclusion, while both questions center around reflecting on life experiences and the wisdom gained from them, they differ in terms of the age group they address and the specific timeframe between the two life stages. The first question targets individuals who are 70 years old or older and focuses on insights gained between the ages of 45 and 70, whereas the second question is more open to people of all ages and emphasizes the knowledge they wish they had had during their 20s."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant that follows instruction extremely well.

Though Orfeu has just been paid, he would rather use his money to get his guitar out of the pawn shop for the carnival. Mira finally offers to loan Orfeu the money to buy her ring. When Orfeu goes home, he is pleased to find Eurydice staying next door with Serafina. Eurydice has run away to Rio to hide from a strange man who she believes wants to kill her. The man â Death dressed in a stylized skeleton costume â finds her, but Orfeu gallantly chases him away. Orfeu and Eurydice fall in love, yet are constantly on the run from both Mira and Death. When Serafina's sailor boyfriend Chico (Waldemar De Souza) shows up, Orfeu offers to let Eurydice sleep in his home, while he takes the hammock outside. Eurydice invites him to her bed. Orfeu, Mira, and Serafina are the principal members of a samba school, one of many parading during Carnival. Serafina decides to have Eurydice dress in her costume so that she can spend more time with her sailor. A veil conceals Eurydice's face; only Orfeu is told of the deception.

Multi-choice problem: Are these two questions inquiring about the same information? Choose your answer from:  - no.  - yes.","output":"Yes, these two questions are inquiring about the same information. Now, to address the issue mentioned in the questions about experiencing a period twice in one month, there could be several reasons for this occurrence: 1. Irregular cycles: Especially during puberty or perimenopause, hormonal changes can lead to irregular menstrual cycles. This might result in more frequent periods within a month or a few days apart from each other. 2. Hormonal imbalances: Sometimes, hormonal imbalances in the body can lead to irregular periods. Different hormones govern your menstrual cycle, and an imbalance in these hormones can alter your cycle's regularity. Polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS) and thyroid-related issues are some common causes of hormonal imbalances that could lead to two periods in one month. 3. Changes in birth control: If you have recently started taking, discontinued, or changed a form of birth control, your body may be adjusting to hormonal fluctuations. This might temporarily cause irregular periods. 4. Stress: High levels of stress can influence your body's hormone production and lead to irregular periods. Managing stress can help in restoring hormonal balance and promote more regular menstrual cycles. 5. Emergency contraception: If you have recently taken emergency contraception, such as the morning-after pill, it can cause changes in your cycle and potentially lead to two periods in one month. 6. Uterine polyps or fibroids: Growths in the uterus, such as polyps or fibroids, may alter your menstrual cycle and lead to irregular bleeding patterns, including more frequent periods. 7. Endometriosis: This condition occurs when the tissue lining your uterus grows outside the uterus, which can lead to painful or irregular periods. In some cases, endometriosis could cause you to have two periods in one month. 8. Infections: Certain infections, particularly of the cervix or pelvic region, might cause irregular bleeding that could be mistaken for a second period within the same month. If you consistently experience two periods within a month, it is important to consult your physician or a healthcare professional.

Many of the more revealing moments in this volume will be familiar to readers of Obama’s own memoir, “Dreams From My Father”; a host of earlier books about Obama and his family; and myriad profiles of the former president that have appeared in newspapers and magazines over the years. Garrow has turned up little that’s substantially new — save for identifying and interviewing an old girlfriend from Obama’s early Chicago years, who claims that by 1987, “he already had his sights on becoming president.”      In the absence of thoughtful analysis or a powerful narrative through line, Garrow’s book settles for barraging the reader with a cascade of details — seemingly in hopes of creating a kind of pointillist picture. The problem is that all these data points never connect to form an illuminating portrait; the book does not open out to become the sort of resonant narrative that Robert A. Caro and Ron Chernow have pioneered, in which momentous historical events are deftly recreated, and a subject’s life is situated in a time and a place. Instead, Garrow has expended a huge amount of energy — his bibliography, including interviews with more than a thousand people, runs to 35 pages — on giving us minutely detailed accounts of early chapters of Obama’s life, like his years at Harvard Law School, his time in Chicago as a community organizer, and his work in the Illinois State Senate. Garrow gets to Obama’s presidency only in an epilogue.      Image Barack Obama as a Harvard student in 1990. Credit Joe Wrinn/Harvard University, via Associated Press      While the Chicago chapter sheds valuable light on Obama’s connection with black residents and his developing sense of vocation, many of the other sections that try to chronicle his day-to-day life feel extraneous and absurdly long-winded, as if Garrow wanted to include every last scrap of information he’d unearthed. Are we really interested in what numerous Obama classmates, colleagues and passing acquaintances remember about his personality — that he struck them as cool or friendly, arrogant or voluble, cheerful or detached? Do we really want to read repetitious discussions about his cigarette consumption and poker-playing habits? |||||","output":"Sasha and Malia Obama, the daughters of former US president Barack Obama and his wife Michelle, marked their final days in the White House by holding a pizza and slumber party, according to their mother.

Given the question: Given the following passage  \\"Four boarders at his parents' apartments became Chopin's intimates: Tytus Woyciechowski, Jan Nepomucen Białobłocki, Jan Matuszyński and Julian Fontana; the latter two would become part of his Paris milieu. He was friendly with members of Warsaw's young artistic and intellectual world, including Fontana, Józef Bohdan Zaleski and Stefan Witwicki. He was also attracted to the singing student Konstancja Gładkowska. In letters to Woyciechowski, he indicated which of his works, and even which of their passages, were influenced by his fascination with her; his letter of 15 May 1830 revealed that the slow movement (Larghetto) of his Piano Concerto No. 1 (in E minor) was secretly dedicated to her – \\"It should be like dreaming in beautiful springtime – by moonlight.\\" His final Conservatory report (July 1829) read: \\"Chopin F., third-year student, exceptional talent, musical genius.\\"\\",  answer the following question. Note that the answer is present within the text.  Question: How did she influence him? The answer is:","output":"The student Konstancja Gładkowska influenced Chopin, or Frederic Chopin - the noted Polish composer and piano virtuoso - predominantly in his creative output of music. According to the passage, it is apparent that Chopin was significantly moved by Gładkowska's singing talent which fuelled his imagination and shaped his artistic creation. This is evident when in letters to his close associate, Tytus Woyciechowski, Chopin acknowledged that certain portions of his works were inspired by his fascination for Gładkowska.  One explicit instance mentioned in the text is the slow movement (Larghetto) of his Piano Concerto No. 1 (in E minor) which was secretly dedicated to her. In a letter dated 15 May 1830, Chopin described his emotional state while composing the piece as being similar to 'dreaming in beautiful springtime – by moonlight.' This suggests that his feelings for Gładkowska influenced the mood and emotional depth of his music, contributing to the dream-like and romantically serene character of the composition. This shows Gładkowska's tangible influence on his creativity. Therefore, it can be inferred from the text that Gładkowska's effect on Chopin was profoundly psychological and emotional. Her presence and talent inspired Chopin, instigating him to produce pieces of music that echoed his internal emotions associated with her. This intrinsically demonstrates how she marked a significant influence on him. She served as a muse that sparked creativity in Chopin, culminating in him composing beautiful pieces of music that encapsulated his emotions for her, lending them a sense of genuine and profound depth. This observation ultimately underscores her extensive impact on his artistic creations."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant that follows instruction extremely well. Help as much as you can.

Write a \\"negative\\" movie review (Options are: * negative. * positive.).","output":"Title: A Cinematic Calamity - \\"The Lost Cause\\" If movies were an investment, \\"The Lost Cause\\" would send its investors to the depths of bankruptcy. The film initially promised to bring a fresh perspective to the stale realm of cliche-ridden blockbusters, but instead, it drowned in its own sea of ineptitude. From the very first frame, the audience is subjected to a cacophony of dreadful acting, abysmal dialogue, and an unfathomable plot that gives the impression of being created by a malfunctioning slot machine. The movie's convoluted narrative revolves around the protagonist, Jack Exemplar, played by an excruciatingly wooden John Fauxtalent. The character seems to be a random hodgepodge of classic action heroes, without any of the charm that made them unforgettable. While Jack goes on an epic quest to uncover a long-lost treasure – a narrative format that was surely stolen from the classics – the film manages to make even this age-old formula insufferable. The countless clichés that clutter the movie feel as though they were meticulously collected from the waste bins of better films before being repurposed for this catastrophe. As we follow Jack on his forced odyssey, we are introduced to an assortment of characters designed to break the mold but instead, end up shattering all patience. From the cunning-yet-stereotypical femme fatale played by Bella Stereotype to the comic relief sidekick played by Tom Unfunnybone, the actors appear to have graduated from a school of acting where subtlety and range were optional subjects. Helming this disaster is the criminally overconfident director, Alan Egotrip, who seems singularly focused on elevating the film's artificial nature. It is evident that the director struggled throughout to make a coherent vision of this movie, resulting in a final product that feels like a botched Frankenstein monster. Instead of exploring the material and portraying a genuine artistic origin, Egotrip indulges in an obscene number of random slow-motion sequences and deliberately prolonged extreme close-ups that serve no purpose whatsoever. Amid the unsatisfactory performances and lackluster direction, the film's writing is its most outstanding flaw. The script is a veritable minefield of contrived situations, wooden dialogue, and ludicrous character motivations. Watching the film, one must wonder if the screenwriter's computer had a vendetta against originality – an unseen digital saboteur hell-bent on creating the most incoherent screenplay imaginable. The special effects and production design are equally disappointing. Rather than utilizing the unlimited visual possibilities of the film medium, the CGI and set pieces are seemingly borrowed from the worst online tutorials available. The color palette is an eyesore, and the feeble attempt at realism leaves the viewer questioning the sanity of the film's art department. In conclusion, \\"The Lost Cause\\" is a perfect storm of terrible acting, abominable writing, and unfortunate direction. The audience, who must endure this descent into cinematic depravity, is left wondering how such a calamity managed to find funding and a place on the silver screen. It is a production that signals dark days ahead for movies, as if a dire warning of dreadful cinematic experiences to come. This is a film best left to gather dust in a forgotten corner of the entertainment world, a shameful relic of Hollywood's lowest moments."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Additionally, a basement can offer protection from temperature fluctuations and natural elements that could damage the toys over time. Comparing the given options: 1. Bed - An incorrect answer as beds are not usually meant for long-term storage. Placing the toys under the bed would also mean they are still accessible, which is not the intention for storing old toys as Sam is moving out to college. 2.

You will be given a task. You must generate a detailed and long answer. Mike lives in a cold mid-western city, where there is not much predator prey interaction. Mike noticed that in his city some squirrels have darker coat, while others have lighter coat. He also knew that darker coats are more suitable in cold environment with less predator prey interaction. He started thinking why the squirrels developed different coat colors.  Would darker squirrels have greater or smaller chance of survival than lighter squirrels?  Hint: New species develop naturally through the process of natural selection . Due to natural selection, organisms with traits that better enable them to adapt to their environment will tend to survive and reproduce in greater numbers. Natural selection causes beneficial heritable traits to become more common in a population and unfavorable heritable traits to become less common. For example, a giraffe’s neck is beneficial because it allows the giraffe to reach leaves high in trees. Natural selection caused this beneficial trait to become more common than short necks. A:","output":"Mike's observation of squirrels having different coat colors in his cold mid-western city can be explained through the process of natural selection. Natural selection is the primary driving force for the evolution of species, as it favors the survival of individuals with traits that are suited to their environment. In this case, we can evaluate the survival chances of darker squirrels compared to lighter squirrels by considering various factors such as predation, thermoregulation, and camouflage. In a cold environment, darker coats might provide the squirrels with an advantage in thermoregulation. Dark colors absorb more solar radiation, which helps the animal retain heat better in colder climates. This effect might contribute to the increased survival rate of darker squirrels in freezing conditions. Darker-furred squirrels could benefit from this since heat retention is an essential factor for maintaining body temperature and sustaining energy levels necessary for survival. However, coat color also plays a significant role in providing camouflage to squirrels, helping them hide from predators. In a snowy environment, the lighter squirrels would potentially have an advantage in blending in with the white backdrop, making it harder for predators to detect them. This could favor the lighter squirrels' survival in areas with heavy snow and increased predator-prey interactions during winter months. As Mike mentioned, there is not much predator-prey interaction in his city. In this context, the importance of camouflage to escape predators diminishes, and the thermoregulation provided by the darker coat could have a more substantial impact on squirrels' survival. Consequently, the darker squirrels would likely have a greater chance of survival in this specific area. However, various factors could affect the development of squirrels' coat color, such as genetic variations within the squirrel population. Further investigation and observation are necessary to determine whether these coat colors result from natural selection or genetic mutation. Ultimately, it is essential to consider the multiple factors at play when examining the survival chances of squirrels with different coat colors, as it is a complex and multifaceted question. In conclusion, in Mike's cold mid-western city, where there is less predator-prey interaction, darker squirrels may have a greater chance of survival due to their enhanced ability to thermoregulate and maintain body heat in freezing conditions. However, other factors such as genetic variation and predator population dynamics could also affect these squirrels' survival, making it a multifaceted and exciting topic to explore."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Answer the above question based on the context below:  Stefan Lochner (the Dombild Master or Master Stefan; c. 1410 – late 1451) was a German painter working in the late \\"soft style\\" of the International Gothic. His paintings combine that era's tendency toward long flowing lines and brilliant colours with the realism, virtuoso surface textures and innovative iconography of the early Northern Renaissance. Based in Cologne, a commercial and artistic hub of northern Europe, Lochner was one of the most important German painters before Albrecht Dürer. Extant works include single-panel oil paintings, devotional polyptychs and illuminated manuscripts, which often feature fanciful and blue-winged angels. Today some thirty-seven individual panels are attributed to him with confidence. Less is known of his life. Art historians associating the Dombild Master with the historical Stefan Lochner believe he was born in Meersburg in south-west Germany around 1410, and that he spent some of his apprenticeship in the Low Countries. Records further indicate that his career developed quickly but was cut short by an early death. We know that he was commissioned around 1442 by the Cologne council to provide decorations for the visit of Emperor Frederick III, a major occasion for the city. Records from the following years indicate growing wealth and the purchase of a number of properties around the city. Thereafter he seems to have over-extended his finances and fallen into debt. Plague hit Cologne in 1451 and there, apart from the records of creditors, mention of Stephan Lochner ends; it is presumed he died that year, aged around 40. Lochner's identity and reputation were lost until a revival of 15th-century art during the early 19th-century romantic period. Despite extensive historical research, attribution remains difficult; for centuries a number of associated works were grouped and loosely attributed to the Dombild Master, a notname taken from the Dombild Altarpiece (in English cathedral picture, also known as the Altarpiece of the City's Patron Saints) still in Cologne Cathedral....

Paragraph: Hundreds of thousands of years before China was to become the world's longest-running civilization, the prologue was enacted by means of the flicker of a carefully tended fire. Peking Man, a forebear of Homo sapiens, achieved a mastery of fire. We might call it the first Chinese invention. Not that he devised flint and steel, matches, or any other way of creating fire. Peking Man simply learned how to capture flame, perhaps from a forest fire, and keep it alight. He thus enjoyed two revolutionary luxuries: light and heat. Technologically and sociologically, it was a phenomenal breakthrough: with fire, communities could live year 'round in one cave, in which cooking and even smelting could be pursued. And so, by 600,000 b.c., about 50 km (31 miles) southwest of present-day Beijing, the ancestors of mankind were ready to settle down. Several hundred thousand years later, when Marco Polo reached the capital of China, he was astonished by a further development in fire technology. The Chinese, he announced, used black stones dug out of mountains as fuel. Europeans did not yet have a word for \\"coal,\\" nor had they discovered a use for it. The First Dynasty The confluence of mythology and history in China took place around 4,000 years ago during what is referred to as the Xia (Hsia) Dynasty. This was still the Stone Age, but the people are thought to have made silk from thread produced by the worms they cultivated on the leaves of their mulberry trees. And written language (which evolved as early as 4,500 to 5,000 years ago) was already in use, originally by oracles and then by official scribes — China's first scholars. During the second of the quasi-legendary dynasties, the Shang (from about the 16th to 11th centuries b.c.), the Chinese developed an interest in art. Careful geometric designs as well as dragon and bird motifs adorned bowls and implements. And with the arrival of the Bronze Age, the Chinese created bronze vessels of such beauty and originality that, until modern times, archaeologists refused to believe they were cast 3,000 years ago. The Shang Dynasty gave rise to the concept of one Chinese nation under one government.  Question: \\"What development in fire technology did Marco Polo discover when he reached the capital of China?\\" Answer: \\"Black stones dug out of mountains\\" Based on the paragraph, is this answer correct","output":"Yes, the answer is correct. When Marco Polo reached the capital of China, he discovered that the Chinese used black stones dug out of mountains as fuel. These black stones refer to coal, which was an advanced development in fire technology at that time compared to what Europeans were using."},{"instruction":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

Text: A Durham University academic, Vikki Boliver, published a report in 2015 claiming that the prestigious position of the Russell Group was not based on evidence, but rather successful marketing. Only the universities of Oxford and Cambridge were significantly more elite than the majority of \`\`old'' universities when a grouping analysis was performed using data on academic selectivity, research activity, teaching quality, socio-economic exclusivity and economic resources. The other 22 members of the Russell Group sit in a second tier of universities along with 18 other \`\`old'' universities (University of Aberdeen, University of Bath*, University of Keele, University of Dundee, University of East Anglia*, Goldsmiths*, Heriot-Watt University, University of Kent, Lancaster University*, University of Leicester*, Loughborough University*, University of Reading*, Royal Holloway*, University of St Andrews*, SOAS*, University of Strathclyde, University of Surrey* and University of Sussex*), mostly comprising former members of the defunct 1994 Group (shown by asterisks). Another 13 \`\`old'' universities and 52 \`\`new'' universities made up a third tier, with a fourth tier of 19 \`\`new'' universities. Within each tier, the differences between the institutions were less significant than the differences between the tiers. This reflected an earlier result from 2010 that, when the \`\`Golden Triangle'' universities (defined in the study as Oxford, Cambridge, Imperial, LSE, and UCL) were omitted, the remaining (then) members of the Russell Group were outperformed by the (then) members of the 1994 Group.

Pick your answer from:  a). Yes.  b). No. Answer:","output":"b). No. Caverns are not formed by pure oxygen. In the scenario you provided, a cavern is formed by carbon dioxide in groundwater seeping through rock and dissolving limestone. A detailed explanation of cavern formation in this case can be found below. The mechanism underlying the formation of caverns is the chemical process of dissolution. When slightly acidic rainwater, containing dissolved carbon dioxide (CO2), infiltrates the ground, it enters the soil and percolates downwards, further dissolving more CO2. This is because the groundwater combines with additional CO2 from decaying plant matter and respiration from organisms, resulting in a weak carbonic acid solution (H2CO3).  When this acidic groundwater reaches the bedrock made of limestone (a calcium carbonate, or CaCO3-rich rock), a slow chemical reaction takes place. The carbonic acid reacts with the calcium carbonate in the limestone to form calcium bicarbonate (Ca(HCO3)2). This newly formed calcium bicarbonate is soluble in water, thus dissolving the limestone and causing it to be carried away by the groundwater. Over an extended period, the repetitive process of dissolution enlarges the existing subterranean channels and fissures in the limestone, eventually leading to the formation of caves or caverns. In summary, the correct answer to the question, \\"what forms caverns by seeping through rock and dissolving limestone?\\" is carbon dioxide in groundwater, and not pure oxygen."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Question: What is the answer for the question: What is the last name of the person whose father died in 1819? from the following article ?  Bennett was born in Sheffield, Yorkshire, the third child and only son of Robert Bennett, the organist of Sheffield parish church, and his wife Elizabeth, née Donn. In addition to his duties as an organist, Robert Bennett was a conductor, composer and piano teacher; he named his son after his friend William Sterndale, some of whose poems the elder Bennett had set to music. His mother died in 1818, aged 27, and his father, after remarrying, died in 1819. Thus orphaned at the age of three, Bennett was brought up in Cambridge by his paternal grandfather, John Bennett, from whom he received his first musical education. John Bennett was a professional bass, who sang as a lay clerk in the choirs of King's, St John's and Trinity colleges. The young Bennett entered the choir of King's College Chapel in February 1824 where he remained for two years. In 1826, at the age of ten, he was accepted into the Royal Academy of Music (RAM), which had been founded in 1822. The examiners were so impressed by the child's talent that they waived all fees for his tuition and board.Bennett was a pupil at the RAM for the next ten years. At his grandfather's wish his principal instrumental studies were at first as a violinist, under Paolo Spagnoletti and later Antonio James Oury. He also studied the piano under W. H. Holmes, and after five years, with his grandfather's agreement, he took the piano as his principal study. He was a shy youth and was diffident about his skill in composition, which he studied under the principal of the RAM, William Crotch, and then under Cipriani Potter, who took over as principal in 1832. Amongst the friends Bennett made at the Academy was the future music critic J. W. Davison. Bennett did not study singing, but when the RAM mounted a student production of The Marriage of Figaro in 1830, Bennett, aged fourteen, was cast in the mezzo-soprano role of the page boy Cherubino (usually played by a woman en travesti). This was among the few failures of his career at the RAM. The Observer wryly commented, \\"of the... Answer:","output":"The last name of the person whose father died in 1819 is Bennett.

Bea was diagnosed with this disease when she was five months old. Since then, the hospital has become her second home, medicines for food, and all kinds of treatments her friends.

How would you consider the linguistic integrity of the preceding sentence?","output":"To analyze the linguistic integrity of the given sentence, I will perform a step-by-step evaluation. Step 1: Identify the sentence structure. The sentence appears to be structured as \\"Subject + Verb + Object.\\" Here, \\"John\\" is the subject, \\"placed\\" is the verb, and \\"him busy\\" is the object. Step 2: Analyze the subject. \\"John\\" functions as a proper noun and is an acceptable subject. Step 3: Analyze the verb. \\"Placed\\" is a transitive verb, which means it requires a direct object to make sense. Based on the sentence structure, \\"him busy\\" should function as the direct object. Step 4: Analyze the object. \\"Him\\" is an object pronoun, which works as an object in a sentence. However, the use of the adjective \\"busy\\" following \\"him\\" is an issue and appears to be an error. Step 5: Consider possible corrections. A grammatically correct version of the sentence might be either \\"John kept him busy\\" or \\"John placed him in a busy state.\\" In these examples, the verb \\"kept\\" is more suitable for describing an influence on someone's state of busyness, while \\"placed him in a busy state\\" would use the original verb \\"placed\\" with the correct object phrase. Step 6: Determine linguistic integrity. The linguistic integrity of the original sentence is low, as it contains errors in the object section of the sentence, making it hard to understand its intended meaning. With corrections like those suggested above, the linguistic integrity can be improved."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant. User will you give you a task.

Given those answer options, answer the question: I’ve learnt a great amount throughout this studio, first and foremost I was taught: how the art world functions, how specific galleries such as Gertrude St Contemporary run and how artists earn a living. The studio also provided me with basic filmmaking skills such as how to: create a shooting schedule, write a shooting script, set up three-point lighting, conduct an interview, utilise visual storytelling and edit a short film. Throughout the shooting process with my artist I also developed my abilities regarding how to use a: Sony Zoom H2N (and other such handy recorders), a lapel mic, my own Canon EOS 60D and Adobe Premiere Pro editing software. Overall I think the studio functioned quite successfully, it was great to be in a studio with nineteen people who all were interested in the same topics as you. I felt that overall, the studios had a very happy and supportive environment, and you walked away knowing a great deal about the art world and how to make short documentaries. The project itself taught me a great deal about how to work with talent, as well as my group members. Having to work independently forced me to be completely all over every aspect of the shoot, whether that be choosing which questions to ask, deciding what to focus on, where I wanted the shoot to happen, deciding what gear to use, getting to the shoot, carrying all the gear, what I wanted to shoot, managing the audio, managing the lighting, managing the camera set-ups, managing the talent, editing the film, and finding a great soundtrack for it. I’m a pretty self-conscious person and I often doubt the decisions I make or ask someone else for their opinion (should I shoot this angle, or what do you think of this question etc.). Working independently pushed me to go with my gut instincts, to make decisions and to not seek others approval. It forced me to develop my aesthetic as a filmmaker and to own the work that I ended up producing, so ultimately I was really glad with how everything panned out.

Objective: ice Which of the following solutions is more sound in terms of naive physics reasoning?","output":"Before I begin, I must clarify that there is no mention of specific solutions in your question; hence, I will assume you are asking about the general concept of naïve physics reasoning and its soundness in different solution types. I will then discuss and compare problem-solving methods that may better align with naïve physics reasoning. Naïve physics is an aspect of human cognition, proposing that humans have an intuitive and often unconscious understanding of the world's physics. This understanding governs how we predict and react to everyday physical objects and their behaviors, including elements like water and ice. There are several types of problem-solving approaches. Some major distinctions include: 1. Analytical Approach: In this approach, problems are solved through logic, analysis, and critical thinking. This method heavily relies on a step-by-step thought process, scientific knowledge, and the application of principles and theories. While this approach may provide more scientifically accurate and sound solutions, it's not necessarily aligned with naïve physics reasoning, as it does not rely on intuitive pre-existing knowledge. 2. Heuristic Approach: This approach is characterized by trial and error, using shortcuts or rules of thumb to find solutions quickly. Heuristics may lead to inaccurate and scientifically unsound solutions. However, they reflect the naïve physics reasoning better because heuristics are based on the intuitive understanding of our physical environment. 3. Expert Intuition: Expert intuition is a type of decision-making that comes from extensive experience in a specific field. While it seems spontaneous, only an expert can achieve such a level of decision-making. Due to in-depth knowledge and experience in a subject, experts can often make decisions that are based on sound reasoning without being explicitly analytical. In terms of naïve physics reasoning, an ideal solution type should align with human intuition and experience while providing a scientifically sound solution. The heuristic approach seems to align better with naïve physics reasoning directly, as it relies on intuition and common sense. However, it may sometimes lead to incorrect conclusions. A more sound approach in terms of naïve physics reasoning might be combining expert intuition with an analytical approach. By doing this, an expert can provide a solution that is both scientifically sound and based on experience. The expert can also correct any inconsistencies with the naïve physics reasoning by applying their analytical abilities. In summary, while the heuristic approach aligns well with naïve physics reasoning, it might not always provide sound solutions. Combining expert intuition with an analytical approach can lead to more sound solutions in terms of naïve physics reasoning, as it combines the strengths of both methods. This combined approach allows experts to rely on their extensive experience while ensuring that their solutions are scientifically sound and align with the principles of naïve physics."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

U.S. President Donald Trump filed his annual financial disclosure form this week with the Office of Government Ethics, the U.S. government's ethics watchdog. Under U.S. law, all top government officials are required to file annual financial disclosure documents with the agency. In Tuesday's 92-page filing, Trump acknowledged that he'd reimbursed his personal lawyer, Michael Cohen, last year for more than 100,000 for unspecified expenses incurred in 2016. Trump’s lawyers have previously said the president reimbursed Cohen for 130,000 that Cohen paid to an adult film star to keep her quiet about a sexual tryst she said she had with Trump 10 years earlier. Trump has denied having the tryst but recently confirmed reimbursing Cohen to stop “false and extortionist accusations” about it. The financial disclosure did not say why Trump had not listed the payment in his previous financial filing, but the ethics agency said the reimbursement constituted a loan that should have been reported. That has set off a firestorm of criticism and calls for an investigation into whether Trump violated federal law by omitting the payment from his 2017 disclosure. The controversy has overshadowed other details in Trump's financial disclosure, which is the only publicly available snapshot into the president's finances — his debts, assets and income from dozens of companies and partnerships around the world. Here are six noteworthy takeaways from the report: Golf losses. Trump, an avid golfer who frequently visits his golf courses, sometimes in the company of world leaders, listed 17 golf companies in his disclosure form, with 13 reporting losses. Overall, golf-related revenue plunged to 210 million from nearly 300 million from the previous reporting period. However, the president's struggling golf courses in Turnberry, Scotland, and Doonbeg, Ireland, improved their earnings, with income at the Turnberry property growing to more than 20 million from 14 million. Trump plans to travel to Scotland during his visit to Britain this summer. According to the above context, answer the following question. What is most probably the case regarding why Trump did not make payment to the adult star directly?","output":"Based on the given context, it is not explicitly mentioned why Trump did not make the payment to the adult star directly. However, it can be inferred that he reimbursed his personal lawyer, Michael Cohen, who then paid the adult film star.

Originally setting his sights on the Indianapolis 500, Cole realizes that \\"To win in Indy I'd need a great car, but stock cars are all the same\\". He is recruited by Chevrolet dealership tycoon Tim Daland to race for his team in the NASCAR Winston Cup Series. Daland brings former crew chief and car builder Harry Hogge out of retirement to lead Cole's pit crew. After Cole sets a fast time in a private test at Charlotte Motor Speedway, Hogge builds him a new Chevrolet Lumina. In his first few races, Cole has difficulty adjusting to the larger NASCAR stock cars and communicating with his crew, while being intimidated on the track by Winston Cup Champion and dirty driver Rowdy Burns; these obstacles, combined with crashes and blown engines, prevent Cole from finishing the races. Discovering that Cole does not understand common NASCAR terminology, Harry puts him through rigorous training. This pays off at the Darlington race, when Cole uses a slingshot maneuver from the outside line to overtake Rowdy and win his first race.

Answer the following question: Found the following article online, use it to answer the question: What two wars was Stafford a favorite of many of the servicemen?  While Stafford was still working for Dorsey, Johnny Mercer told her, \\"Some day I'm going to have my own record company, and you're going to record for me.\\" She subsequently became the first solo artist signed to Capitol after leaving the Pied Pipers in 1944. A key figure in helping Stafford to develop her solo career was Mike Nidorf, an agent who first heard her as a member of the Pied Pipers while he was serving as a Captain with the United States Army. Having previously discovered artists such as Glenn Miller, Artie Shaw, and Woody Herman, Nidorf was impressed by Stafford's voice, and contacted her when he was demobilized in 1944. After she agreed to let him represent her, he encouraged her to reduce her weight and arranged a string of engagements that raised her profile, and confidence.The success of Stafford's solo career led to a demand for personal appearances, and from February 1945 she embarked on a six-month residency at New York's La Martinique nightclub. Her performance was well-received—an article in the July 1945 edition of Band Leaders magazine described it as \\"sensational\\"—but Stafford did not enjoy singing before live audiences, and it was the only nightclub venue she ever played. Speaking about her discomfort with live performances, Stafford told a 1996 interview with The New Yorker's Nancy Franklin, \\"I'm basically a singer, period, and I think I'm really lousy up in front of an audience—it's just not me.\\"Stafford's tenure with the United Service Organizations (USO) during World War II—which often saw her perform for soldiers stationed in the U.S.—led to her acquiring the nickname \\"G.I. Jo\\". On returning from the Pacific theater, a veteran told Stafford that the Japanese would play her records on loudspeakers in an attempt to make the U.S. troops homesick enough to surrender. She replied personally to all the letters she received from servicemen. Stafford was a favorite of many servicemen during both World War II and the Korean War; her recordings received extensive airplay on the American...

Think like you are answering to a five year old. Summarize the following: Only a trained, qualified medical professional should attempt to transport a bedridden person. Do not attempt to do this at home or in a medical setting if you are not trained and qualified to do so. Before you start moving the person, you need to make sure they are aware of what you're doing. Tell them exactly what you're going to do and why (they need to be transported) before you start the process of transporting them. In addition, talk to them as you perform each step so they know what to expect. If the person is able to sit in wheelchairs for short periods, you may be able to transport them yourself. To begin, make sure the wheelchair is next to the bed with the seat facing you. The side of the wheelchair should be close to the bed. The wheelchair needs to be stable and ready for the person to sit. Set the brakes so that the wheelchair doesn't move around. Pull the footrests up towards the wheels so that the person has a clear path to the seat. When trying to move someone, you also need to protect yourself, particularly your back and legs. Make sure you keep your legs shoulder-width apart with your knees bent. Also, don't bend at the waist. Rather, keep your spine in a natural position. Keep in mind that it can take some strength to move someone. Have someone assist you if you're not sure you can do it by yourself. If the person can't sit up themselves, you'll need to help lift them to sitting. Place an arm behind their back. Place your other arm under their knees, looping it in so you can pull them towards you. Turn the person's lower body towards the edge of the bed while simultaneously lifting from the top. You should end up with the person sitting up with their feet on the floor. Let the person sit for a moment, as the process can make them dizzy. Place your legs around the patient's outside leg (the one not near the wheelchair). Keeping your back straight, bend at the knees. Grasp the patient by placing your arms under theirs, going around the chest. Grasp your own hands in the back. Lift the patient up. if needed. If the person cannot support their weight at all, you should use a Hoyer lift to transport them. Start by placing the sling under the person by rolling them to one side and positioning it under them. Adjust the leg loops around the thighs, crossing them underneath for security.  Move the lift into place. The legs position under the bed, while the top of the lift (the cradle) moves over the bed to attach to the sling. Push the lift in as far as it will go. Do not lock the brakes. Attach both sides of the sling to the appropriate sides of the cradle. Once the sling is attached, lift the person up slowly until they are just above the mattress. Swing their legs out towards the lift to clear the edge. Gently move the person away from the mattress, lowering the bed if you need to do so. Turn the person towards the seat. The patient should try to provide as much support as they can with their legs. Lower them gently when they're legs hit the edge of the seat. Tell them to grab the arms of the wheelchair to help if they can.  A gait belt can give you something to grasp. You put it around the patient's waist and then use it to help lift them.  If you're using a Hoyer lift, position the person over the wheelchair using the lift. Gently lower them into the wheelchair. A van with a wheelchair lift will work best. However, in a car, you can do a similar transfer as you did to the bed. Lift the person, in the same way, setting them down on the seat of the car. Place one arm behind their back and one arm under their legs to pivot them into the car. Help them buckle in. Summary:","output":"Moving a bedridden person should only be done by a trained medical professional. To move someone, explain what you're going to do and why, and keep talking to them during the process. If the person can sit, you might use a wheelchair. Make sure the wheelchair is stable and ready, and protect your own back by keeping legs shoulder-width apart and bending your knees. Help the person sit up and lift them into the wheelchair if needed. If the person can't support their weight, use a Hoyer lift with a special sling to help lift them. A gait belt can also help with lifting. When moving the person to a car, you can do a similar transfer as with the wheelchair.

San Diego had gone ahead with 1:56 to play on a 1-yard touchdown run by Oliver. Verrett's first career interception helped the Chargers extend their winning streak to five, while Oakland suffered its 11th straight defeat. The Chargers 5-1 start to begin the season was their best since 2002. Carr threw a 77-yard TD pass to Andre Holmes in the opening minute of the game, and he and Rivers both threw two touchdowns in the first half for a 14-14 tie at halftime. In the third quarter, a 54-yard Novak field goal was nullified by a Chargers holding penalty. On fourth-and-35, Weddle threw an incomplete pass on a fake punt, giving the Raiders excellent field position; Oakland then scored on a 47-yard TD pass from Carr to Brice Butler. The Chargers responded with a Gates score on a 1-yard pass from Rivers, and the game was tied at 21 to begin the fourth quarter. Oakland took the lead again after Carr found Holmes for a 6-yard TD with 10 minutes left.

Verrett had left the game earlier in the third quarter after tearing his left labrum in three places while diving for a pass. Oliver ran for 101 yards in the game, and Rivers threw for 313 yards and three touchdowns. For Rivers, it was an NFL-record fifth straight game with at least a 120 passer rating.

Insomnia is a sleep disorder that makes it difficult for a person to fall and stay asleep or to feel well-rested after waking up. This condition can affect one or both individuals in the couple, causing them to struggle with settling down for rest at night. Insomnia can arise from various factors including stress, anxiety, medical conditions, or even poor habits that interfere with their sleep-wake cycle. Due to this, the couple might find it challenging to establish a regular sleep schedule and synchronize their bedtime routines. Consequently, this sleep disorder interferes with their ability to easily transition from their daily activities to bedtime. While pregnancy, making love, rest, and infants can also impact a couple's bedtime routine in various ways, these options do not necessarily limit the couple's ability to go to bed. For instance: - Pregnancy: Although it might introduce physical discomfort and sleep disturbances for expectant mothers, it generally does not prevent a couple from going to bed. - Making love: This intimate activity often relaxes and strengthens the emotional bond between partners, potentially promoting a restful night's sleep. However, there might be cases where it could interfere with the couple's intention to sleep. - Rest: This option wouldn't hinder a couple from going to bed, as it is suggestive of relaxation and recuperation, which aligns with the purpose of sleep. - Infant: The presence of a newborn might affect the couple's sleep schedule due to nighttime feedings or disturbances, yet it doesn't prevent them from attempting to go to bed. Instead, they might need to adjust their routines and expectations surrounding sleep. In summary, insomnia is the most logical option that prevents a couple from going to bed, as it directly affects their ability to fall asleep and stay asleep, impacting their overall well-being."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Living things need non-living matter as well as energy. What do you think matter is used for? One thing is to build bodies. They also need it to carry out the processes of life. Any non-living matter that living things need is called a nutrient. Carbon and nitrogen are examples of nutrients. Unlike energy, matter is recycled in ecosystems. You can see how in Figure 3.11. Decomposers release nutrients when they break down dead organisms. The nutrients are taken up by plants through their roots. The nutrients pass to primary consumers when they eat the plants. The nutrients pass to higher level consumers when they eat lower level consumers. When living things die, the cycle repeats.

Step 3: Analyze the options provided Now we need to determine which among the given options is the source that promotes the creation of serotonin through ultraviolet light: (1) Jupiter: Jupiter is a planet and does not emit sunlight, so it cannot be responsible for creating serotonin. (2) Venus: Similar to Jupiter, Venus is a planet and is not a source of sunlight or ultraviolet light, so it cannot stimulate serotonin production. (3) The Sun: The Sun is the primary source of sunlight and ultraviolet light. The exposure to its light is what stimulates serotonin production in the human body. (4) The Moon: The Moon does not produce sunlight, but it reflects sunlight from the Sun.

Answer the above question based on the context below:  The identity of the donor has not been established, although a number of suggestions have been advanced over the last 200 years. Harbison suggests the work's small scale indicates that it functioned as a portable altarpiece rather than as a private devotional work, and thus was commissioned by or for a member of the clergy. Other art historians have argued that the donor may have been a Genoese merchant. This belief has been fed by the triptych's similarity to Giovanni Mazone's Virgin and Child altarpiece in Pontremoli, Tuscany, which may place it in the Italian region of Liguria at latest by the end of the 15th century. Damaged coats of arms on the inner frames have been linked to the Giustiniani family, known for establishing trade links with Bruges in the 14th and 15th centuries. If not commissioned by that family, historical record place the work at least in their possession by the end of the century. In the early 1800s, Frances Weale attempted to place Michele Giustiniani as the donor, however later historical research has been unable to verify his presence in Bruges around 1437, and he seems to have returned to Italy by 1430.Mid-twentieth century technical examination revealed the Giustiniani coats of arms may have been painted over an earlier heraldic design, perhaps as early as the 15th century, whose signifiance and history is now lost. Dhanens theorises that a member of the Giustiniani family may have established other associations with St. Michael and St. Catherine, advancing that they were a member of the Italian Rapondi family, whose trading house in Paris was named after St. Catherine. Their daughter, also named Catherine, married the Italian merchant Michel Burlamacchi (Bollemard in Flemish) from Lucca, who was active in Bruges. From this Dhanens theorises the piece was commissioned as a wedding gift for the couple. Documents show weavers in Wervik paid taxes to Catherine Rapondi and in September 1434, when Michele Burlamacchi was tax collector in that town, van Eyck received a stipend funded...

From Babylon, Alexander went to Susa, one of the Achaemenid capitals, and captured its legendary treasury. He sent the bulk of his army to the Persian ceremonial capital of Persepolis via the Royal Road. Alexander himself took selected troops on the direct route to the city. He had to storm the pass of the Persian Gates (in the modern Zagros Mountains) which had been blocked by a Persian army under Ariobarzanes and then hurried to Persepolis before its garrison could loot the treasury. On entering Persepolis, Alexander allowed his troops to loot the city for several days. Alexander stayed in Persepolis for five months. During his stay a fire broke out in the eastern palace of Xerxes and spread to the rest of the city. Possible causes include a drunken accident or deliberate revenge for the burning of the Acropolis of Athens during the Second Persian War.

If I tell you that Speciation occurs by a process called natural selection, and ask you the question \\"what occurs by a process called natural selection?\\", is the correct answer \\"competition\\"? Answer:","output":"No, the correct answer to the question \\"what occurs by a process called natural selection?\\" is not \\"competition.\\" Although competition plays a role in natural selection, it is not the main outcome or process being described by this term. Natural selection is a key mechanism of evolution that refers to the process by which organisms with heritable traits that are advantageous for their survival and reproduction in a given environment are more likely to pass those traits on to their offspring. In natural selection, organisms with favorable traits have a higher chance of survival and are more likely to reproduce, thus passing on their beneficial traits to future generations. As a result, the frequency of these advantageous traits becomes more common within a population over successive generations. This process helps explain how species adapt to changing environments and ultimately leads to the formation of new species, known as speciation. While competition can influence natural selection (e.g., through competition for limited resources, mates, or territory), it is only one component. Other factors, such as predation, environmental changes, and genetic mutations, also play critical roles in the process of natural selection."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

(June 2015) (Learn how and when to remove this template message) When North Carolina secedes from the Union on May 20, 1861, the young men of a rural, provincial, North Carolina backwater known only as Cold Mountain hurry to enlist in the Confederate military. Among them is W.P. Inman (Jude Law), a carpenter who has fallen in love with Ada (Nicole Kidman), a minister's daughter, and finds their whirlwind courtship interrupted by the American Civil War. Three years later, Inman finds himself in the trenches of Petersburg, Virginia, during the Battle of the Crater. Union soldiers tunneling beneath Confederate fortifications detonate over 300 kegs of gunpowder, in a futile attempt to undermine the position prior to their assault. As the ill-fated attack begins, Oakley (Lucas Black) an old acquaintance of Inman's from Cold Mountain, is impaled on a bayonet and mortally wounded. Inman rescues him from the fighting and takes him to a field hospital. Later that day Oakley dies in the hospital, with Inman and Stobrod Thewes (Brendan Gleeson) beside him. The next night, Inman, along with his Cherokee friend Swimmer (Jay Tavare), are sent to flush out surviving Union troops trapped behind their lines. During the raid, a burst of friendly fire kills Swimmer and seriously injures Inman. As Inman lies in the hospital near death, he has a letter from Ada read to him in which she pleads with him to stop fighting, stop marching, and come back to her. Inman recovers, andâwith the war drawing ever closer to an inevitable Confederate defeatâdecides to go home to Cold Mountain. On his journey he meets the corrupt preacher Reverend Veasey (Philip Seymour Hoffman), who is about to drown his pregnant slave lover. Inman stops Veasey, and leaves him tied up to face the town's justice. Exiled from his parish, Veasey later rejoins Inman on his journey. They help a young man named...

I doubt that I will ever go back there . So we went up to The Cafe in the north part of Ames . ( picture blow ) The Cafe is one of the nicest places in Ames to eat . Why will I never go back to that restaurant .","output":"Based on your experience, there are several reasons why you may never go back to that restaurant: 1. Poor hygiene: You mentioned that the table was dirty upon arrival. This reflects on the overall cleanliness of the establishment, and it signals that the management may not prioritize proper sanitation and hygiene. Since cleanliness in a restaurant is essential, especially concerning food safety, it is understandable that this aspect alone would discourage you from returning. 2. Inefficient service: The fact that other guests who arrived after you were greeted and instructed on how to order, while you were not, shows that there might be inconsistencies and inefficiency in the service provided. Patrons expect to be treated fairly and to receive timely attention from the staff at a restaurant, and being overlooked leads to dissatisfaction. 3. Limited menu options: It seems that when you finally decided on an item to order, the restaurant had run out of what you wanted. Running out of menu options can be indicative of poor planning on the management’s part or a limited supply of ingredients. It also leads to frustration for customers who are denied their desired dish. 4. Inattentiveness to guests' needs: From your experience, it appears that the staff did not go above and beyond to cater to your needs when you told them the table was dirty. Good customer service is dependent on showing attentiveness to guests' concerns, and you may feel that the restaurant failed to demonstrate this. 5. Negative first impression: In the hospitality industry, it is often said that first impressions are crucial. Since your experience was characterized by various negative aspects, such as uncleanliness, inefficient service, and limited options, you may doubt the restaurant's ability to not only improve but also provide you with a satisfactory dining experience in the future. 6. Better options available: You mentioned finding a different restaurant, The Cafe in the north part of Ames, which you described as one of the nicest places to eat in the area. When there are better establishments available that provide a high-quality dining experience, it is natural that you would prefer to go there instead of returning to a restaurant with a negative track record. In conclusion, the combination of these factors has significantly impacted your decision and created a reluctance to return to that particular restaurant. It is essential for businesses, especially in the competitive food industry, to prioritize cleanliness, customer service, and menu availability to retain customers and generate positive feedback. The lack of these attributes in the restaurant you visited has led to your decision to not return and search for better alternatives like The Cafe in the north part of Ames."},{"instruction":"Explain how you used the definition to come up with the answer.

Write a text based on \\"beijing residents keep cool headed on consumption\\" Text:","output":"Title: \\"Beijing Residents Maintain Levelheaded Approach to Consumption: A Blend of Tradition and Sustainability\\" Introduction: In recent years, Beijing has experienced rapid urbanization and economic growth, which in turn has led to increased consumption among citizens. Surprisingly, its residents have managed to adopt a level-headed approach to consumerism, skillfully blending traditional Chinese values with modern sustainability practices. This has helped in mitigating the adverse environmental and socio-economic impacts brought about by excessive or impulsive consumption. The Roots of a Mindful Consumption in Beijing: The philosophy of frugality and sustainable living runs deep in Chinese culture. The teachings of ancient Chinese philosophers, such as Confucius and Lao Tzu, emphasize the importance of balance and moderation in all aspects of life. These time-tested principles have been passed down through generations, and are still evident in the daily lives of Beijing residents. Beijing's residents have etched these values in their consumption patterns. They are known to prioritize practicality, longevity, and functionality of products over extravagance or unnecessary extravagance. This attitude comfortably fits in with the current global trend of promoting mindful consumerism to combat the environmental challenges posed by overconsumption. Adapting Old Values to Modern Lifestyles: In contemporary Beijing, residents continue to uphold traditional values and apply them to a rapidly changing society. Here are some examples of how they have successfully integrated time-honored principles with modern living standards: 1. Utilizing public transportation: Beijing residents are avid users of public transport, including the extensive subway and bus systems. This reduces the need for personal transportation, resulting in fewer resources used and a decline in pollution. It is in line with the ancient Chinese belief in living in harmony with the environment. 2. Food and cooking: Beijing locals embrace family recipes that have been passed down through generations. The Chinese ethos of using every part of an ingredient to minimize waste aligns well with modern sustainability practices. Moreover, Beijing citizens are known to carefully plan their meals and grocery shopping, ensuring that they do not overbuy or let food go to waste, hence, reducing their carbon footprint. 3. Repair and reuse: Rather than discarding damaged items, Beijing residents are more inclined to repair and restore them to their original condition, prolonging their lifespan. This approach is rooted in the traditional Chinese belief that favors resourcefulness and creativity to work around challenges and scarcity. 4. Supporting local businesses and artisans: Beijing residents are proud of their age-old handicrafts and traditional products, which symbolize the rich cultural history of China. They prefer to purchase goods from local artisans or small businesses, not just to support the traditional ways of production but also to strengthen the local economy while maintaining a sustainable consumption pattern. The Role of the Beijing Government in Supporting Mindful Consumption: The local government in Beijing plays an essential role in promoting and sustaining a level-headed approach to consumption. They have implemented eco-friendly policies, such as encouraging sustainable architecture, promoting recycling, and offering incentives for businesses that adopt green practices. Moreover, the government is investing in urban planning and public transportation to maintain a city infrastructure that supports sustainable living, allowing residents to make responsible consumption choices more easily. Conclusion: Beijing has provided a unique example of how a traditional mindset and values can be adapted to modern life. The residents of this vibrant city have successfully combined ancient wisdom with contemporary sustainability practices, setting an example for cities worldwide. It is a testament to the flexibility and resilience of both the people and their culture, and proof that ancient philosophies still have a vital role to play in addressing contemporary issues."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Mae Carol Jemison was born in Decatur, Alabama, on October 17, 1956, the youngest child of Charlie Jemison and Dorothy Green. Her father was a maintenance supervisor for a charity organization, and her mother worked most of her career as an elementary school teacher of English and math at the Beethoven School in Chicago. The family moved to Chicago, Illinois, when Jemison was three years old, to take advantage of the better educational and employment opportunities there. Jemison says that as a young girl growing up in Chicago she always assumed she would get into space. In the spring of 1996, Jemison filed a complaint against a Texas police officer, accusing him of police brutality during a traffic stop that ended in her arrest. She was pulled over by Nassau Bay, Texas officer Henry Hughes for allegedly making an illegal U-turn and arrested after Hughes learned of an outstanding warrant on Jemison for a speeding ticket. In the process of arresting her, the officer twisted her wrist and forced her to the ground. In her complaint, Jemison said the officer physically and emotionally mistreated her. Jemison's attorney said she believed she'd already paid the speeding ticket years ago. She spent several hours in jail and was treated at an area hospital after release for deep bruises and a head injury. Jemison said in a televised interview that the incident has altered her feelings about police there. \\"I always felt safe and comfortable [around the police]. I don't feel that way anymore at Nassau Bay and that's a shame,\\" she said. Jemison filed a lawsuit against the city of Nassau Bay and officer Hughes.  In 2007, diagnostic test provider Gen-Probe Inc. announced that they would not accept the resignation of Jemison from their board of directors. Jemison had failed to be re-elected to the board in a vote of the shareholders of the company at the company's May 31 annual stockholders meeting. The company said it believed that Jemison's failed re-election was the result of a recommendation by advisory firm Institutional Shareholder Services that shareholders vote against her due to her poor attendance at board meetings. Gen-Probe determined that Jemison's two absences in 2006 were for valid reasons and said Jemison had attended all regular and special board and committee meetings since September.

Article:House of Representatives Majority Whip Steve Scalise was one of five injured in the early morning ambush at a park in Alexandria, Virginia. The attacker, identified as Illinois native James T Hodgkinson, 66, was killed after a firefight with police. The injured included two officers with non-life-threatening wounds. Hodgkinson was self-employed until recently and worked as a home inspector. He had campaigned for former Democratic presidential candidate Bernie Sanders. A Facebook account that appears to belong to Hodgkinson is filled with anti-Republican and anti-Trump posts. Mr Sanders, a Vermont senator, said he was \\"sickened by this despicable act\\" and condemned Hodgkinson's actions. President Trump described the attack as a \\"very, very brutal assault\\". \\"We may have our differences, but we do well in times like these to remember that everyone who serves in our nation's capital is here because, above all, they love our country,\\" he added. The president visited Mr Scalise - who was shot in the left hip and is in a critical condition after surgery - at the MedStar Washington Hospital Center on Wednesday evening, describing him as a \\"patriot and a fighter\\". The hospital said Mr Scalise had suffered fractured bones, internal organ injuries and severe bleeding and would require further operations. What we know about James T Hodgkinson The lawmakers were practising for the annual congressional ballgame that organisers vowed would go ahead as planned on Thursday at Nationals Park, home of Major League Baseball team the Washington Nationals. Alexandria police said the FBI was taking over the investigation into the shooting, which began shortly after 07:00 (11:00 GMT) on Wednesday morning at Eugene Simpson Stadium Park. As well as Mr Scalise, two police officers who protect him, Krystal Griner and David Bailey, lobbyist Matt Mika and Zack Barth, a congressional aide for Texas lawmaker Roger Williams, were injured. Mr Barth, a former staffer for two Republican congressmen, was shot in the chest, according to witness Arizona Senator Jeff Flake. Mr Flake told reporters he was at bat during the shooting and the victims were \\"sitting ducks\\". Senator Mike Lee, a Utah Republican, said someone at the baseball field had used a belt as a tourniquet on Mr Scalise, who is the number three House Republican. South Carolina congressman Jeff Duncan said the suspect had asked him whether Republicans or Democrats were practising, before shots rang out. Kentucky Senator Rand Paul told Fox News: \\"I do believe without the Capitol Hill police it would have been a massacre. \\"We had no defence at all. The field was basically a killing field.\\" He said they were lucky that Mr Scalise was present because he has a security detail owing to his congressional seniority. US lawmakers receive police protection while they are at the Capitol building, but only certain high-ranking House and Senate figures - believed to number about 10 in total - have a round-the-clock security detail wherever they are. Just a handful of top congressional leaders used to have that privilege, but it was broadened after 9/11 to include the whips, according to The Hill. However, other members can get protection too if, for example, threats have been made. Some of those not eligible for constant protection carry guns in their home districts if the state laws allow it, and lawmakers can also organise local police protection for their events. When Democrat representative Gabrielle Giffords was shot in January 2011 in Arizona while speaking to constituents, no police were providing security. The latest shooting has triggered a fresh debate around the issue. Mo Brooks, an Alabama Republican, told CNN he was on third base during the baseball game when he saw Mr Scalise, who was on second base, shot. He said Mr Scalise had a bullet hole in his leg, but was saying: \\"I'm OK, I'm OK.\\" Mr Brooks said everyone on the field scattered as 50 to 100 shots were fired. He said a gunfight had ensued between the shooter and the congressmen's police security detail, who were armed with pistols. Mr Brooks, who took refuge behind a batting cage, said the gunman was armed with a rifle and was \\"blasting away\\" from behind the dugout. Mr Brooks said congressmen Chuck Fleischmann, of Tennessee, Ron DeSantis, of Florida, and Jeff Duncan, of South Carolina, were among 15-25 other lawmakers at the game. Asked by a CNN host if the attack was deliberate, Mr Brooks replied: \\"Well, it sure as heck wasn't an accident! \\"He was going after elected officials, congressmen.\\" Mr Brooks continued: \\"The only weapon I had was a baseball bat and that's not the kind of fight you want to engage in.\\" Ohio congressman Brad Wenstrup, who served in Iraq as a combat surgeon from 2005-06, provided medical care at the scene. He said the attack had lasted for at least 10 minutes, adding: \\"He had a lot of ammo.\\" Alexandria Police Chief Michael Brown said his officers had responded and engaged the shooter within three minutes. The last member of Congress to be targeted by a gunman was Democrat Gabrielle Giffords, who was shot in the head as she met constituents in Tucson, Arizona, in January 2011.  She survived, but six others died in that incident. Ms Giffordsâ€ Summarize the main points of that article.","output":"House of Representatives Majority Whip Steve Scalise was critically injured in an early morning shooting at a park in Alexandria, Virginia. The attacker, 66-year-old James T Hodgkinson, was killed after exchanging gunfire with police. In addition to Scalise, two police officers, a lobbyist, and a congressional aide were injured. The lawmakers were practicing for the annual congressional baseball game, scheduled to take place later in the week. Hodgkinson, who had campaigned for Bernie Sanders, was reportedly vocally anti-Republican and anti-Trump. President Trump denounced the shooting as a \\"very, very brutal assault\\"."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant. You will be given a task. You must generate a detailed and long answer. Given the question: Question: When picking up drinks, what kind requires you to hold them by the neck?  Choices:  - glass - shoulder - body - guillotine - bottle  The rationale to choose \\"bottle\\" as the answer is that: The answer is:","output":"\\"bottle\\" The rationale for choosing \\"bottle\\" as the answer when picking up drinks that require you to hold them by the neck lies in the understanding of the different options provided and the characteristics of each choice in relation to holding a beverage container. Here is a detailed examination of each choice and why bottle is the most appropriate answer: 1. Glass: While it is true that beverage glasses exist in various shapes and sizes, their intended method of being held is not by the neck. Beverage glasses such as wine glasses, pint glasses, and highball glasses are typically held by their base or body for stability and to keep the drink at the desired temperature. Holding a glass by the neck is not practical or ergonomic. 2. Shoulder: The term \\"shoulder\\" in this context is not directly related to a beverage container or the way to hold one. It may refer to the body part, but this choice does not align with the given question. 3. Body: The body of a beverage container, such as a can, bottle, or glass, typically refers to the main or cylindrical part of the container. While it is common to hold the body of a can or glass to drink from it, the specific question asks for a type of drink that requires holding it by the neck. 4. Guillotine: A guillotine is a historical beheading apparatus and not related to beverage containers or how to hold them. Therefore, it is an irrelevant choice for this question. 5. Bottle: Bottles, such as those used for beer or wine, have a distinctive neck that is narrower than their body. This design allows for better control and grip, preventing the bottle from slipping out of your hand. Holding a bottle by its neck also helps maintain the temperature of the drink inside, as your hand does not come into contact with the main body of the container. Thus, it is a practical and intended way to hold a bottle while drinking from it. In conclusion, the rationale for choosing \\"bottle\\" as the answer for the given question lies in its design, where a narrow neck is present, providing better control, grip, and temperature preservation compared to the other choices. The other options do not fulfill the requirements of the question, with some being unrelated to beverage containers, and others not having a neck specifically designed for holding the drink."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

You will be given a task. You must generate a detailed and long answer. Article: A well-balanced diet of whole foods, fresh fruits, and plentiful vegetables can do wonders for your skin. A healthy body means healthy skin! In turn, healthy skin is more likely to be free of blemishes, imperfections, uneven complexion issues, and red or dry patches.  Eat fruits and vegetables of all colors to ensure you get a rich variety of vitamins and minerals. Eat foods that are rich in vitamin C, which can help make your skin paler. Vitamin C also promotes skin elasticity because it helps the body with collagen production.  Consume foods and drinks that are high in antioxidants. This can help fight the signs of aging, including dull, discolored, and wrinkled skin. There is such a thing as too much water, but your skin and body still need to be hydrated for proper health. Drink when you are thirsty, especially if you are exercising. Hydrating your skin should help keep it from becoming dry and flaky, and it may even promote a \\"glowing\\" appearance. Cardiovascular exercise is great for your heart and lungs, and it also promotes circulation. Strong circulation is essential for healthy skin. Exercise also reduces stress, which can help alleviate conditions that cause redness (e.g. acne and eczema.) People who suffer from skin conditions like rosacea, psoriasis, or eczema should exercise in cool environments to avoid flare-ups. Moisturize before and after a workout to keep the skin happy. To take care of your skin: wash it daily with a gentle cleanser, exfoliate once or twice a week, and moisturize daily. Exfoliation helps remove dead skin cells, which can leave your skin looking fresher and cleaner. Dirt can often contribute to darker-looking skin. Like exercise, a skin massage can promote healthy circulation. Before bed, take a few moments to massage lotion or aloe vera thoroughly into your skin.
