Write a summary based on this article: If you’ve ever walked barefoot on asphalt on a hot summer day, you know that it gets pretty darn hot. It also does a really great job of sharing all that stored heat with its surroundings.      That can make a huge difference in the temperature in areas where there’s a lot of blacktop around. In the heavily-paved neighborhoods of Los Angeles, for example, the heat island effect is a very real concern.      L.A. Street Services is working on a fix. The workers in that picture aren’t cleaning up a spill, they’re spreading a white (actually very, very light gray) topcoat on several L.A. roadways. Hitting control-I on the color palette makes a big difference — as much as 10 degrees on a summer afternoon, according to Street Services.      Streets in all 15 of L.A.’s electoral districts have been coated as part of the pilot project. If the results are anywhere near as positive as they’ve been elsewhere in California, crews will no doubt be whitewashing a whole lot more.      A similar test in Canoga Park, a city of 60,000 about 30 miles from Los Angeles, saw the temperature on one stretch of road reduced from 93 to 70 degrees. In Encino, a parking lot that was coated dropped from a blistering 160 degrees down to a much more bearable 130.      This isn’t the first push L.A. has made to combat the heat island effect. Three years ago residents were offered rebates for doing the very same thing to their roofs, with some experts saying that the change from black to white could reduce average temperatures in California by as much as two degrees.      That might not seem like much, but every notch on the thermometer helps these days. Los Angeles broke 90 degrees four times in July, and the monthly average has climbed more than 3.5 degrees over the past 5 years.

Think like you are answering to a five year old. Bin Laden and his aides did not need a very large sum to finance their planned attack on America. The 9/11 plotters eventually spent somewhere between 400,000 and 500,000 to plan and conduct their attack. Consistent with the importance of the project, al Qaeda funded the plotters. KSM provided his operatives with nearly all the money they needed to travel to the United States, train, and live. The plotters' tradecraft was not especially sophisticated, but it was good enough. They moved, stored, and spent their money in ordinary ways, easily defeating the detection mechanisms in place at the time. The origin of the funds remains unknown, although we have a general idea of how al Qaeda financed itself during the period leading up to 9/11. General Financing As we explained in chapter 2,  Bin Laden did not fund al Qaeda through a personal fortune and a network of businesses in Sudan. Instead, al Qaeda relied primarily on a fund-raising network developed over time. The CIA now estimates that it cost al Qaeda about 30 million per year to sustain its activities before 9/11 and that this money was raised almost entirely through donations. For many years, the United States thought  Bin Laden financed al Qaeda's expenses through a vast personal inheritance.  Bin Laden purportedly inherited approximately 300 million when his father died, and was rumored to have had access to these funds to wage jihad while in Sudan and Afghanistan and to secure his leadership position in al Qaeda. In early 2000, the U.S. government discovered a different reality: roughly from 1970 through 1994,  Bin Laden received about 1 million per year-a significant sum, to be sure, but not a 300 million fortune that could be used to fund jihad. Then, as part of a Saudi government crackdown early in the 1990s, the  Bin Laden family was forced to find a buyer for Usama's share of the family company in 1994. The Saudi government subsequently froze the proceeds of the sale. This action had the effect of divesting  Bin Laden of what otherwise might indeed have been a large fortune. Nor were  Bin Laden's assets in Sudan a source of money for al Qaeda. When  Bin Laden lived in Sudan from 1991 to 1996, he owned a number of businesses and other assets.  Question: \\"To fund a jihad, how much of Bin Laden's personal inheritance could have gone to the terrorists?\\" Answer: \\"30 million per year until 1994\\" Is this answer correct?","output":"I'm going to explain this in a very simple way so that a five-year-old can understand.  Bin Laden was a man who wanted to plan an attack on America with his group called Al Qaeda. They needed money to do this. People used to think Bin Laden had a lot of money from his family (around 300 million) to spend on the attack.  But, the truth is, Bin Laden did not have that much money. He got about 1 million a year from his family, until 1994 when the government took his money away. So, he couldn't use his own money for the attacks.  Instead, Bin Laden and Al Qaeda got money from other people who wanted to help. They raised about 30 million every year to plan the attack.  So, the answer is \\"Bin Laden couldn't use his personal inheritance to fund the attack. Al Qaeda got money from donations, raising about 30 million per year.\\""},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant. You will be given a task. You must generate a detailed and long answer.

Options: - joy - addiction - relaxation - fatigue - headaches A:","output":"Mandy was watching television because she had a long day and she could not do much else due to her current state. Given the context, the most suitable option to answer the above question is fatigue. Fatigue is a feeling of extreme tiredness, weariness, or exhaustion, often resulting from physical or mental exertion. In Mandy's case, her long day likely involved various activities that drained her energy, leaving her feeling fatigued. As she was fatigued, Mandy found it difficult to engage in other activities or tasks that might require more effort or concentration. Watching television is a passive activity that does not demand much energy or attention, making it a suitable choice for someone experiencing fatigue, like Mandy. The other options provided do not align with the given context as well as fatigue does: 1. Joy: While Mandy may have experienced moments of joy during her day, it does not explain why she could not do much else but watch television. 2. Addiction: Addiction refers to a compulsive, uncontrollable dependence on a substance or behavior. Mandy's decision to watch television was due to her fatigue, not an addiction. 3. Relaxation: Though watching television can be a relaxing activity, the context of the question implies that Mandy was unable to do much else because of a specific condition rather than just a desire for relaxation. 4. Headaches: Although headaches can limit a person's ability to perform certain tasks, there is no mention of Mandy experiencing any pain or discomfort in the given scenario.

The movie then shifts to Michael Burrows, a criminal profiler for the San Francisco Police Department. Shot in documentary style, the film is ostensibly a dissertation by a film school grad that follows Michael throughout the story. Fired from the police force after his hematophobia allows a serial killer to get away, Michael wallows in a deep depression for several weeks before coming up with a way to combine his Darwin Awards obsession with his talent for profiling. He will help insurance companies detect people more likely to accidentally end their own lives, so they are not sold insurance policies. After impressing an insurance company manager with his profiling talent, Michael is paired up with Siri, a specialist in strange insurance cases. Siri and Michael travel the country on behalf of the company, investigating several legendary examples of stupidity, such as the JATO rocket car. A pair of men attempting to ice fish become frustrated and use a stick of dynamite to blast a hole in the ice. The problem is their dog plays fetch with the lit dynamite and runs it back to their brand-new SUV. As they investigate the cases, Michael tries to pinpoint a common factor for these people.

They go to Porky's, a nightclub out in the Everglades, believing that they can hire a prostitute to satisfy their sexual desires. Porky takes their money but humiliates the kids by dumping them in the swamp. When the group demands their money back, the sheriff, who turns out to be Porky's brother, arrives to drive them away, but not before his minions extort the rest of their money and cause them more embarrassment. After Mickey (who returned to Porky's for revenge) is beaten so badly he has to be hospitalized, the gang becomes hellbent on exacting revenge on Porky and his brother, eventually succeeding in sinking his establishment in the swamp. Porky and his men, joined by the sheriff, chase after the group, but they make it across the county line (out of Porky's brother's jurisdiction), where they are met by a group of the local police officers, one of whom is Mickey's older brother Ted, and the high school band. After Ted repeatedly damages Porky's car, he says that all charges against Porky for driving an unsafe vehicle will be dropped if the night's events are forgiven. Because the boys were too young to be legally allowed in Porky's in the first place, Porky and his brother have no choice but to agree. The film ends with the group getting their revenge and Pee Wee finally losing his virginity. In a subplot, the boys also peep on female students in their locker room shower.

Eugene and Tucker are 18 years old and about to graduate. Little has changed though as Tucker continually checks out girls and makes perverted remarks while Eugene is still disgusted and tells Tucker to cut it out as he now has a girlfriend and feels uncomfortable checking out other girls. Candace walks by and Tucker makes a sexual joke about her epilepsy, causing her to beat him up.Eugene goes to speak at an assembly with his girlfriend Cindi Whitehall (Raquel Alessi) while Tucker watches in the crowd. They inform the middle school kids listening that they are abstinent and they are trying to encourage everyone to be abstinent to prevent the spread of STDs. Eugene tells them about his brother who had sex too early and got an STD as a result and then shows them a picture of it, horrifying the kids.Later that night, Eugene climbs up a tree and sits outside Cindi's window and proclaims his love for her. He then suggests they go to a party after prom to have fun. Cindi casually asks if this means that they are finally going to have sex but Eugene firmly states no, saying that he does not want the same thing that happened to his brother to happen to him. Cindi looks disappointed but agrees. Eugene then realizes his mistake and calls her and promises her that they will have sex at the party.As Eugene is getting ready for prom, a limo drives up, courtesy of Tucker.

Recently, the OHCHR has deployed a regional adviser to Central Asia, a first in the organization's history. This move not only signifies the UN's commitment to safeguarding human rights but also serves as an opportunity to foster better relations among Central Asian nations. Central Asia consists of the five former Soviet republics - Kazakhstan, Kyrgyzstan, Tajikistan, Turkmenistan, and Uzbekistan - which have been grappling with various human rights issues since gaining independence in the early 1990s. The five countries share several cultural, historical, and economic ties, as well as a common legacy of human rights challenges. By deploying a regional adviser, the OHCHR aims to foster more effective cooperation between national actors and the international community, promote adherence to international human rights standards, and increase support for practical implementation of required reforms. Several areas of concern have been identified in the region, such as freedom of expression, association, and assembly. Central Asian countries have faced scrutiny for limiting these rights, which has caused a chilling effect on civil society and stifled the work of human rights defenders. Additionally, issues like rule of law, good governance, and sustainable development are central to Central Asia's human rights framework. The regional adviser's role will be to work closely with governments, civil society organizations, international partners, and other stakeholders to advance human rights in each country, as well as address concerns on a regional level. This would include offering technical assistance, facilitating dialogue between national and international actors, and working to build capacity for human rights organizations in the region. By establishing a strong foundation of human rights protection in Central Asia, the UN hopes to create a more stable and just society in the region. As a regional adviser for Central Asia, their mission will be to embark on a comprehensive and proactive approach to addressing human rights issues and promote long-lasting, positive change. It is anticipated that this unprecedented move will generate synergies between countries and contribute to fostering a culture of human rights in Central Asia."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

The cat ended up squeaky clean.","output":"Once upon a time in a little garden, there lived a fluffy gray cat named Whiskers. Whiskers loved to roll around in the grass and play with her favorite toy mouse all day long. One day, Whiskers discovered a big, muddy puddle in the middle of the garden. It had rained a lot the previous day, and the dirt had turned into wet, gooey mud. Whiskers was very curious about this strange new thing, so she decided to get closer. As she approached the puddle, she saw her reflection in the water. It looked like another cat! Whiskers thought that maybe she had found a new friend and excitedly tapped the water with her paw. Splash! The water splashed all over Whiskers, and now she was all wet and muddy. \\"Oh dear, I don't like this at all,\\" thought Whiskers as she tried to shake off the mud. But the more she shook, the more stuck the mud became in her fluffy fur. Whiskers didn't know what to do, and she started to meow loudly for help. Thankfully, her best friend Tommy, a small boy who lived in the house nearby, heard her cries and came running to her rescue. Tommy saw Whiskers covered in mud and knew he had to help her get clean again. He gently picked her up and carried her to his house where he prepared a warm, bubbly bath. Whiskers, as a cat, usually didn't like water. But this time, she knew she needed the bath to be clean and fluffy again. With a bit of hesitation, Whiskers jumped into the bathtub, and Tommy carefully started washing her with soap and a soft towel. Tommy was very gentle and made sure not to get any water in Whiskers' eyes or ears. He rinsed off all the soap and mud from Whiskers' fur, and she could feel herself getting cleaner and cleaner. As the last of the muddy water swirled down the drain, Whiskers began to purr to show her appreciation. Once Whiskers was completely clean, Tommy dried her off with a soft, fluffy towel. Whiskers felt so much better and was so grateful to Tommy for rescuing her from the mud. The cat ended up squeaky clean, and they happily went back to playing in the garden – but this time, Whiskers stayed away from the muddy puddles!"},{"instruction":"Q: In this task, you are given two phrases: Head and Tail, separated with <sep>.

Kevin, on the other hand, recently moved to Toronto which just finished a several month long tree planting initiative that has drastically lowered the amount of air pollutants in the city.  Who is less at risk for having a heart attack?  Hint: Air pollution can also indirectly cause other health issues and even deaths. Air pollutants can cause an increase in cancer including lung cancer, eye problems, and other conditions. For example, using certain chemicals on farms, such as the insecticide DDT (dichlorodiphenyltrichloroethane) and toxic PCBs (polychlorinated biphenyl), can cause cancer. Indoors, pollutants such as radon or asbestos can also increase your cancer risk. Lastly, air pollution can lead to heart disease, including heart attack and stroke. Answer:","output":"Based on the provided information and taking into account the effects of air pollution on human health, Kevin, who recently moved to Toronto, is less at risk for having a heart attack compared to Michael who moved to Xinjiang. Xinjiang, as mentioned, has a large amount of air pollutants due to the chemical manufacturing industry. These pollutants can cause a variety of health issues, including increased risk of cancer (lung cancer, in particular), eye problems, and other conditions. Additionally, the use of certain chemicals, like DDT and toxic PCBs, can lead to even more severe health complications. Exposure to air pollution is also linked to cardiovascular diseases, such as heart attacks and strokes. Fine particulate matter (PM2.5), nitrogen dioxide (NO2), sulfur dioxide (SO2), and ozone (O3) are some of the key air pollutants that adversely affect heart health. These pollutants can cause inflammation, oxidative stress, blood vessel constriction, and reduced oxygen-carrying capacity, all of which contribute to heart attack risk. On the other hand, Toronto has recently undertaken a tree-planting initiative that has significantly reduced air pollution levels in the city. Trees are well-known air purifiers: they absorb pollutants like NO2, SO2, and PM2.5, and release oxygen in return. This improvement in air quality greatly lowers the risk of heart attacks among residents like Kevin. Moreover, trees provide numerous other health benefits, apart from their air-purifying abilities. They help cool down urban areas, reducing heat-related health problems, and provide spaces for physical activity, relaxation, and social interaction, all of which contribute to better overall physical and mental well-being. In conclusion, Kevin, living in Toronto, is less at risk for having a heart attack due to the city's improved air quality following the tree-planting initiative. On the contrary, Michael faces higher health risks, as he resides in Xinjiang, which is burdened with considerable air pollution from the chemical manufacturing industry. These air pollutants can lead to both respiratory and cardiovascular problems, making him more susceptible to heart attacks and other health complications. Therefore, it is crucial for regions like Xinjiang to implement pollution control measures to protect the health of their citizens and environment."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant that follows instruction extremely well.

Chinese Influences: The Japanese were forced out of the Korean peninsula in the sixth century, but not before the Koreans had bequeathed to the Yamato court copies of the sacred images and scriptures of Chinese Buddhism. Just as Christianity introduced Mediterranean culture into northern Europe, so Buddhism brought Chinese culture into Japanese society. Throughout the seventh and eighth centuries numerous Japanese monks, scholars, and artists made the perilous trip west across the Sea of Japan to study Chinese religion, history, music, literature, and painting — later to be brought back for further development in Japan. An outstanding figure of this time was Prince Shotoku, who in 604 developed the \\"Seventeen-Article Constitution,\\" outlining a code of human conduct and the ideals of state as a basic law for the nation. He also established relations with the Sui dynasty in China. Through him, the Japanese imperial court developed Chinese patterns of centralized government, with its formal bureaucracy of eight court ranks. The Chinese calendar was used to calculate the year of Japan's foundation by counting back the 1,260 years of the Chinese cosmological cycle. Thus, 660 b.c. is still the official date celebrated nationwide. At this early stage in its history Japan was already (for the most part) only nominally ruled by the emperor. De facto power was exercised by the militarily and economically strongest family. The Sogas had promoted Buddhism as an imperially sanctioned counterweight to the native Shinto religion, along with the new Chinese customs, to weaken the influence of their more conservative rivals. But they in turn were ousted in a.d. 645 by Nakatomi Kamatari, founder of the great Fujiwara clan, which was to rule Japanese affairs for hundreds of years and provide prominent advisers to the emperor even up to the 19th century.

What term is used in Belgium and the Netherlands to refer to an institution like a German Fachhochschule?","output":"In Belgium and the Netherlands, the term \\"Hogeschool\\" is used to refer to an institution that is similar to a German Fachhochschule. Hogescholen are higher education institutions that offer professional bachelor and master's degree programs, typically focusing on applied sciences, arts, education, and business studies. These institutions emphasize practical, vocational training, and applied research, preparing students for careers in various industries and sectors. Like their German counterpart Fachhochschulen, Hogescholen aim to bridge the gap between traditional academic universities and the practical demands of the professional world. The programs offered at Hogescholen are designed to equip students with the knowledge, skills, and experiences needed to excel in their chosen field. Students at Hogescholen engage in hands-on projects, internships, and real-world case studies, allowing them to apply their theoretical knowledge in practical contexts. It is important to note that there might be some differences between the institutions in Belgium and the Netherlands. In Belgium, Hogescholen are mainly found in the Flemish Community, where they are called \\"Hogeschool\\" or \\"Haute École\\" in French. They offer professional bachelor's degrees, academic bachelor's degrees, and master's degrees.

In addition to the dollar the coinage act officially established monetary units of mill or one-thousandth of a dollar (symbol ₥), cent or one-hundredth of a dollar (symbol ¢), dime or one-tenth of a dollar, and eagle or ten dollars, with prescribed weights and composition of gold, silver, or copper for each. It was proposed in the mid-1800s that one hundred dollars be known as a union, but no union coins were ever struck and only patterns for the 50 half union exist. However, only cents are in everyday use as divisions of the dollar; \\"dime\\" is used solely as the name of the coin with the value of 10¢, while \\"eagle\\" and \\"mill\\" are largely unknown to the general public, though mills are sometimes used in matters of tax levies, and gasoline prices are usually in the form of X.XX9 per gallon, e.g., 3.599, sometimes written as 3.599⁄10. When currently issued in circulating form, denominations equal to or less than a dollar are emitted as U.S. coins while denominations equal to or greater than a dollar are emitted as Federal Reserve notes (with the exception of gold, silver and platinum coins valued up to 100 as legal tender, but worth far more as bullion). Both one-dollar coins and notes are produced today, although the note form is significantly more common. In the past, \\"paper money\\" was occasionally issued in denominations less than a dollar (fractional currency) and gold coins were issued for circulation up to the value of 20 (known as the \\"double eagle\\", discontinued in the 1930s). The term eagle was used in the Coinage Act of 1792 for the denomination of ten dollars, and subsequently was used in naming gold coins. Paper currency less than one dollar in denomination, known as \\"fractional currency\\", was also sometimes pejoratively referred to as \\"shinplasters\\". In 1854, James Guthrie, then Secretary of the Treasury, proposed creating 100, 50 and 25 gold coins, which were referred to as a \\"Union\\", \\"Half Union\\", and \\"Quarter Union\\", thus implying a denomination of 1 Union = 100.

After finding the element with the maximum absolute value you should return the value of that element before you applied the absolute value. Teacher: Now, understand the problem? Solve this instance: [ 67.37  -33.152] Student:","output":"Yes, I understand the problem. To solve the instance, we will follow these steps: 1. Find the absolute value of each element in the list. 2. Compare the absolute values and track the element with the highest absolute value and its actual value (sign intact). 3. Return the value of the element with the highest absolute value. Let's solve it: 1. The absolute values of the elements are:    67.37 => 67.37 (as it's already positive)    -33.152 => 33.152 (multiplied by -1 to make it positive) 2. Comparing the absolute values, 67.37 is higher than 33.152. So, the element with highest absolute value is 67.37. 3. Therefore, the answer is 67.37."},{"instruction":"You should describe the task and explain your answer. While answering a multiple choice question, first output the correct answer(s).

By Daily Mail Reporter PUBLISHED: 16:55 EST, 10 May 2013 | UPDATED: 13:20 EST, 13 May 2013 Central Park West will soon be missing an unlikely inhabitant to its rarefied row of multi-million dollar homes as NASCAR great Jeff Gordon puts his 30 million Manhattan condo on the market. The four-time NASCAR Cup Series champion will likely be driving away from the place even richer than when he purchased the Central Park adjacent digs in 2007 for a mere 9.67 million. And 30 million is just the asking price since many well-heeled Manhattanites (or wannabe Manhattanites) will undoubtedly be clamouring for a spot in the highly sought-after building at 15 Central Park West.

Explanation: The house belongs to Jeff Gordon, the NASCAR champion. So it makes sense that the sentence would say, \\"The great room in Jeff Gordon's 3,454-square-foot residence...\\" The other options are wrong because: - Brazilian's residence, Daily Mail's residence, and Manhattanites’s residence are not the topic of the news story - Central Park's or Central Park West’s residence isn't accurate because the story didn't say that the park owns a house. - Manhattan's residence isn't correct because Manhattan is a place, not a person who can own a house. - NASCAR’s and NASCAR Cup Series's residence are wrong because NASCAR and NASCAR Cup Series is a car racing body and a championship, not a person who can own a house."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Please answer the following question: Process: - Air goes into the lungs - The lungs remove oxygen from the air - Oxygen diffuses from alveoli in the lungs to the bloodstream - Hemoglobin in red blood cells attaches to the oxygen - Red blood cells carry oxygen all around the body - Oxygen diffuses into cells from capillaries.  Question: suppose the lungs remove more oxygen happens, how will it affect more oxygen diffuses into cells from capillaries.  How does the supposed perturbation influence the second effect mentioned. Answer by more, less or no effect A:","output":"If the lungs remove more oxygen from the air, it implies that there is more oxygen available to diffuse from the alveoli in the lungs into the bloodstream. This is because the rate at which oxygen is absorbed by the blood in the lungs is primarily dependent on the concentration of oxygen in the alveoli. When more oxygen is present in the alveoli, more will diffuse into the bloodstream due to the increased concentration gradient. This would then allow more oxygen to bind to the hemoglobin in red blood cells, assuming that there is not already a saturation of oxygen binding sites. Most of the oxygen in the blood is carried by hemoglobin, and each molecule of hemoglobin can carry up to four oxygen molecules. Consequently, if more oxygen is entering the bloodstream, and there is capacity available in the hemoglobin, more oxygen will be carried all around the body. This would subsequently result in more oxygen diffusing into cells from capillaries (assuming capacity is available within the cells). Oxygen diffuses from the capillaries into body cells down a concentration gradient, meaning it moves from areas of high oxygen concentration to areas of low oxygen concentration. If there is more oxygen being carried in the capillaries, then there will be a greater concentration of oxygen, leading to an increased rate of diffusion into the cells. Therefore, if the lungs were to remove more oxygen from the air, leading to an increased concentration in the bloodstream and more being delivered to body cells, this process would indeed result in more oxygen diffusing into cells from the capillaries. However, this process is dependent on several factors including the availability of binding sites on hemoglobin and the ability of cells to utilize the increased amount of oxygen.    Although the overall impact might be more oxygen diffusing into cells from capillaries, it’s important to note that the human body has a sophisticated regulatory system that ensures oxygen levels are balanced. If too much is present, mechanisms kick into gear to return these levels to normal. So in a healthy state, the process is tightly regulated and the initial increase of oxygen intake would eventually be balanced out by these systems."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Summarize this article: Omega-6 is another polyunsaturated fatty acid, found in vegetable oils like corn, cottonseed, soybean, safflower, and sunflower.  Studies indicate that reducing consumption of omega-6 while increasing omega-3 produces health benefits, however.  A 1:1 ratio of omega-6 to omega-3 would be excellent, but even a 2-4:1 ratio is better than the average American's diet. To improve your ratio, eat more fish and less fried fast foods, potato chips, cookies, donuts, etc. Choosing the right kind of fish is the first step.  Preparing it in a way that preserves omega-3 amounts without introducing excessive unhealthy fats or sodium (while also tasting delicious) is an important next step for regular fish consumption.  Bake or grill your fish instead of frying, which adds undesirable omega-6 to your omega-3. To reduce amounts of mercury and other toxins, remove the skin and outer fat of your fish, where such toxins tend to reside in higher concentrations.  If you intend to drain your canned tuna, choose tuna packed in water.  Omega-3 adheres to oils far better than water, so less of it will go down the drain when you empty the can. Maybe you've never been much of a fish person, or maybe you can't get your kids to eat any fish that isn't in the form of a frozen, fried stick.  Get creative and you can slip more omega-3-rich fish into your dinner menu.  Try replacing meat in dishes with fish.  Grilled kebabs, for instance, can easily be switched from beef or chicken to salmon or tuna. Many people recoil at the thought of anchovies, but they are very high in omega-3 and blend easily into many dishes.  Finely chopped anchovies practically melt into sauces, for instance, and impart a savory and umami -- not fishy -- flavor.  Try adding them to your pasta sauce next time. Algae isn't fish, but it is where much of the omega-3 in fish comes from.  Edible algae like seaweed or kelp are high in DHA, one of the component parts of omega-3.  Cut out the middleman every once in a while, or better yet, pair a high omega-3 fish with its favorite food on your plate. Fish-based omega-3 contains DHA and EPA, both of which have demonstrated health benefits.  The benefits of non-fish based omega-3 foods, which contain ALA, are less definitive but strongly indicative. 2.2-4.4 g of ALA is recommended for a 2,000 kcal/day diet. Good sources of ALA-based omega-3 include soybeans, canola, walnuts, flaxseeds, and ALA-enriched foods like eggs and occasionally peanut butter (among other foods). If you have difficulty consuming enough omega-3 rich foods, have medical conditions that would benefit from higher omega-3 consumption, are pregnant, or are just interested in increasing your omega-3, talk to your healthcare professional about supplements.  Omega-3 supplements most often come in the form of fish oil caplets.  Some people complain that these have an unpleasant, fishy aftertaste, but there are a wide variety of fish oil options (with a wide variation in quality control), so do some research and find one that works for you.  Most people have to worry about too little omega-3, but overconsumption of omega-3 can be a problem for some, as it can cause bleeding problems.  Do not consume an average of more than 3 grams per day without consulting your physician. Summary:","output":"Omega-6 is a polyunsaturated fatty acid found in many vegetable oils, and while it is important for health, maintaining a balanced ratio with omega-3 is crucial. Healthier ratios can be achieved by consuming more omega-3-rich foods such as fish, specifically prepared in ways that do not introduce excessive unhealthy fats or sodium. Suggestions include grilling or baking fish instead of frying and using anchovies or other high omega-3 fish in different recipes. Non-fish based sources of omega-3 include edible algae, soybeans, canola, walnuts, flaxseeds, and certain ALA-enriched foods, while omega-3 supplements offer another alternative for those unable to consume enough omaga-3 rich food. Despite the benefits, caution is advised, as overconsumption of omega-3 can lead to bleeding problems. Consultation with a healthcare professional is recommended for individuals seeking to increase their omega-3 intake."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant. You will be given a task.

Available options:  (1). yes.  (2). it is not possible to tell.  (3). no.","output":"(3). no. Based on the provided premise, it seems that Stephanopoulos did not emphasize that the rape charge must be considered at face value. Instead, he rephrased the rape charge as a question about the relevance of candidates' private lives. By doing so, he shifted the focus from the specific rape charge itself to a more general discussion regarding the significance of private life matters when assessing political candidates. This indicates that Stephanopoulos did not necessarily assert the importance of considering the rape charge at face value, but rather questioned the extent to which such issues should influence voters and the public in evaluating a candidate's suitability for office. The premise suggests that Stephanopoulos reframed the topic in a way that invites a broader conversation about the appropriate boundaries between public and private life for political figures, rather than insisting on the need to focus solely on the rape charge itself. In this context, the hypothesis that \\"Stephanopoulous emphasized that the rape charge must be considered at face value\\" is not accurate, as the actual emphasis appears to be on the general relevance of personal matters in evaluating political candidates, rather than on the specific rape charge alone.

I’m sitting at the airport on a Sunday morning waiting for my flight to Las Vegas for the now-annual pilgrimage to the NamesCon conference. A few years ago, Vegas was one of my “bucket list” places – one of those iconic cities that one should visit at least once in their life. For me, once was enough. This is now my 4th (I think?) trip to Vegas, and while the city has a lot to offer, it’s just not my cup of tea. For one thing, I’m not a gambler, like at all. I don’t have anything against it, I just don’t enjoy it. It either feels pointless or stressful to me. The city itself makes me a little sad – in some cases, it reeks of desperation. Last time I was there, my cab driver entertained me with stories of how she was working 3 jobs to save up enough to join some mega-massive bingo game. She won a small jackpot a few years back and that allowed her to work only one job for a few months. She was hoping to win again so she could cut back to 1 or 2 jobs. I wondered how many people do similar things – gambling their money away, in big or small chunks, in the hopes of that big score and in the process, putting themselves in a not-great financial situation. I suppose as long it makes them happy, then it’s all OK, but I can’t help but think someone like my cab driver might be happier overall if she only worked 1 job instead of 3, instead of working extra jobs to save up money to gamble her way to financial freedom. But that’s for her to decide, not me.  The juxtaposition of extreme and in-your-face wealth and the homeless people on the Strip also makes me sad. It’s difficult to see people begging for food and sleeping on the street while all around you, millions of dollars are poured into creating a massive playground with every type of indulgence possible. But I’m the first to say that I’ve enjoyed staying in some of the nicer hotel properties there and eating several excellent meals at some of the finer restaurants in the area, so I’m not exactly helping to solve the problem.

Step 1: Combine like terms -32979*g and 33016*g are like terms because they both have the variable g. We can add them together: -32979*g + 33016*g = (33016 - 32979) * g = 37 * g  Now the equation becomes:  37*g - 111 = 0 Step 2: Isolate the variable g  To find the value of g, we need to isolate the variable on one side of the equation. We can do this by adding 111 to both sides of the equation: 37*g - 111 + 111 = 0 + 111 37*g = 111 Step 3: Solve for g Now that we have isolated the variable g, we can divide both sides of the equation by 37 to find the value of g: 37*g / 37 = 111 / 37 g = 3 So, the solution for the equation -32979*g + 33016*g - 111 = 0 is g = 3."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

You've been doing the same thing too long. Your company isn't likely to be promoting anyone soon because it has just gone through a major downsizing, merger or takeover. You have two choices: Quit and start over somewhere else, assuming there is somewhere else to go; or look closer to home, right in your current company, to see what other ways your talents can be put to use. Getting out of your career rut requires a mental tow truck. Rev up your brain and consider these points:. 1. Adjust your pace. If you told a 500-meter sprinter who was 250 meters into the race that he was now going to be running a mile, what's the first thing he'd do? Of course, he would change his tempo. He'd stride differently, pace himself differently. The first thing any sensible employee does in a downsized company is to do the same. Realize the path between promotions may now be longer. The rules have changed in mid-race. Tear out your hair and curse the gods if you think it'll help, but the worst thing you can do is make believe it didn't happen. 2. Analyze your competition. More than ever, it's important to know whom you're up against for those few remaining slots. What are the other people doing? What are they overlooking? Is the next promotion slated to go to somebody outside the company to bring in \\"fresh blood\\" and \\"new perspectives\\"? Analyze yourself, too. How marketable are you in the outside world? Get to know your value and your options. 3. Look for sideways growth. If you can't grow going up, can you build your credentials and experience through lateral moves that would teach you new skills? If you're dead-ended in programming, explore the prospects in marketing. There's never been a company yet that didn't need more sales. Give yourself an alternative route. It's a great way to improve your promotion odds long term. 4. Study the corporate culture. Does the company favor a certain way of doing things? Is there a corporate style? When you study the way the winners do it and compare that to the way you do it, you may not like what you see, but you'd better see it. 5. Take a look at your personal risk factor. Sure, there are ways to move up faster, but before you leap, look at the risks involved. If your advancement opportunities are fewer, you may have to find ways to stand out from the rest of the pack. You may fall flat on your face trying, but are you willing to take the chance? Do you have any bold new ideas to propose? Will you take on projects that really stretch your abilities? You can get yourself noticed, and you may get ahead in the process, but your risk of failure increases, too. I'm for trying. Go the extra mile. It's never crowded. You'll fail some of the time. If you don't, you're not trying hard enough. If you want to be the leader of the pack, you have to be willing to stick your neck out in front of the others. Sometimes it's risky not to take risks. 6. Draw up your plan. Add up all the factors: pace, competition, long-term growth options, risk and the hard facts about advancement. Then put down your plan, in writing. 7. Measure your results. If you can, share your plan with your boss, and then measure your own progress on a fixed schedule. If you still don't seem to be going places, it's time to tune up the résumé and look around for a new track to run on. It's been said that the hardest part of climbing to the top of the ladder is getting through the crowd at the bottom. I would add that the first step is the hardest one to take.

President Donald Trump’s decision to reverse a policy of separating families coming across the U.S. southern border came in the wake of a political firestorm that fired up opposition Democrats and alarmed even some Republicans. At the very least, it likely set the stage for immigration to be a key issue in November. Trump was in combat mode Wednesday during a political rally in Duluth, Minnesota, where he vowed to make immigration a central focus in the upcoming congressional campaign. “If you want to create a humane, lawful system of immigration then you need to retire the Democrats and elect Republicans to finally secure our borders,” Trump said to an enthusiastic crowd, some chanting, “Build the wall!” Just hours earlier, the president reversed his controversial policy of separating children from their parents by signing an executive order in the White House. “We are going to have strong, very strong, borders. But we are going to keep the families together,” he said. Trump decided to back away from the controversial policy of separating families after an outcry from around the country that included protests in several states, including Arizona, Texas, Pennsylvania and Massachusetts. Also driving the outrage was a recording of children crying out for their parents released by the investigative journalist group ProPublica. The separation policy drew condemnation from Republicans including former first lady Laura Bush and a host of Democrats. “We should be able to agree that we will not keep kids in child internment camps indefinitely and hidden away from public view,” said Maryland Democratic Congressman Elijah Cummings. “What country is that? This is the United States of America!” Advocates for a tough border policy sided with the president including Art Arthur of the Center for Immigration Studies.

Context: A federal judge on Thursday rejected efforts by Texas to stop the resettlement of Syrian refugees within its borders. The ruling comes days after presumptive Republican presidential nominee Donald Trump called to block non-citizen Muslims from entering the U.S. following the Orlando nightclub massacre. Even before the attack, Americans were divided, mostly along party lines, on the issue of refugees from war-torn countries in the Middle East. A survey conducted in late May by the Brookings Institution found of those polled, just 38 percent of Republicans supported taking in refugees from Syria and the Middle East, compared with 77 percent of Democrats. But among Trump supporters, an overwhelming 77 percent said they oppose taking in refugees. So who are these people who cause such a divide among Americans, triggering feelings of dread and suspicion in some and feelings of empathy and hospitality in others? Millions have been forced to flee the bloody conflicts in Syria, Iraq, Libya and other Middle Eastern nations. In 1951 the United Nation's Refugee Convention defined a refugee as someone who \\"owing to a well-founded fear of being persecuted for reasons of race, religion, nationality, membership of a particular social group or political opinion, is outside the country of his nationality, and is unable to, or owing to such fear, is unwilling to avail himself of the protection of that country.\\" By the end of 2014, there were 19.5 million refugees worldwide, according to the United Nations, 14.4 million of whom were under the mandate of the United Nations Human Rights Council. This was an increase of 2.9 million from 2013. The remaining 5.1 million refugees were registered with the United Nations Relief and Works Agency.

Background: A burlesque is a literary, dramatic or musical work intended to cause laughter by caricaturing the manner or spirit of serious works, or by ludicrous treatment of their subjects. The word derives from the Italian burlesco, which, in turn, is derived from the Italian burla - a joke, ridicule or mockery. Burlesque overlaps in meaning with caricature, parody and travesty, and, in its theatrical sense, with extravaganza, as presented during the Victorian era. \\"Burlesque\\" has been used in English in this literary and theatrical sense since the late 17th century. Context: The word first appears in a title in Francesco Berni's Opere burlesche of the early 16th century, works that had circulated widely in manuscript before they were printed. For a time, burlesque verses were known as poesie bernesca in his honour. 'Burlesque' as a literary term became widespread in 17th century Italy and France, and subsequently England, where it referred to a grotesque imitation of the dignified or pathetic. Shakespeare's Pyramus and Thisbe scene in Midsummer Night's Dream and the general mocking of romance in Beaumont and Fletcher's The Knight of the Burning Pestle were early examples of such imitation.  In 17th century Spain, playwright and poet Miguel de Cervantes ridiculed medieval romance in his many satirical works. Among Cervantes' works are Exemplary Novels and the Eight Comedies and Eight New Interludes published in 1615. The term burlesque has been applied retrospectively to works of Chaucer and Shakespeare and to the Graeco-Roman classics.  Burlesque was intentionally ridiculous in that it imitated several styles and combined imitations of certain authors and artists with absurd descriptions. In this, the term was often used interchangeably with \\"pastiche\\", \\"parody\\", and the 17th and 18th century genre of the \\"mock-heroic\\". Burlesque depended on the reader's (or listener's) knowledge of the subject to make its intended effect, and a high degree of literacy was taken for granted.  17th and 18th century burlesque was divided into two types: High burlesque refers to a burlesque imitation where a literary, elevated manner was applied to a commonplace or comically inappropriate subject matter as, for example, in the literary parody and the mock-heroic. One of the most commonly cited examples of high burlesque is Alexander Pope's \\"sly, knowing and courtly\\" The Rape of the Lock. Low burlesque applied an irreverent, mocking style to a serious subject; an example is Samuel Butler's poem Hudibras, which described the misadventures of a Puritan knight in satiric doggerel verse, using a colloquial idiom. Butler's addition to his comic poem of an ethical subtext made his caricatures into satire.  In more recent times, burlesque true to its literary origins is still performed in revues and sketches. Tom Stoppard's 1974 play Travesties is an example of a full-length play drawing on the burlesque tradition. Question: what other works were made as burlesque? Answer:","output":"Other works made as burlesque include: 1. \\"Don Quixote\\" by Miguel de Cervantes – A satirical novel that ridicules the chivalric romances popular in its time and pokes fun at the various social and moral norms of Spanish society. 2. \\"Gulliver's Travels\\" by Jonathan Swift – This work is often considered a burlesque due to its use of humor, satire, and exaggeration to critique the political and social climate of 18th-century England. 3. \\"The Beggar's Opera\\" by John Gay – A satirical ballad opera that mocks the conventions of traditional Italian opera and the society of its time. 4. \\"The Loves of the Triangles\\" by George Canning, George Ellis, and John Hookham Frere – A parody of Erasmus Darwin's poem \\"The Loves of the Plants,\\" mocking the idea of imbuing plants with human-like romantic characteristics and satirizing the scientific language and theories of the day. 5. \\"The Dunciad\\" by Alexander Pope – A mock-heroic poem that satirizes the literary culture of 18th-century England by depicting a world dominated by Dullness and her agents, who represent the mediocre writers and critics Pope disdained. 6. \\"Candide\\" by Voltaire – A philosophical satire that employs humor, exaggeration, and irony to critique various social, religious, and philosophical issues. 7. \\"Northanger Abbey\\" by Jane Austen – Though primarily a coming-of-age novel, it can also be considered a burlesque as it satirizes and parodies the Gothic novels popular during Austen's time. 8. \\"The Threepenny Opera\\" by Bertolt Brecht and Kurt Weill – A satirical musical play that challenges the traditional notions of opera and critiques capitalism and corruption. 9. \\"Sweeney Agonistes\\" by T.S. Eliot – A modernist dramatization that employs burlesque elements, such as absurdity and dark humor, to confront the disillusionment of post-World War I society. These are just a few examples of works made as burlesque, encompassing various styles, time periods, and forms, from novels and poetry to plays and musicals."},{"instruction":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

This article: Holst's absorption of folksong, not only in the melodic sense but in terms of its simplicity and economy of expression, helped to develop a style that many of his contemporaries, even admirers, found austere and cerebral. This is contrary to the popular identification of Holst with The Planets, which Matthews believes has masked his status as a composer of genuine originality. Against charges of coldness in the music, Imogen cites Holst's characteristic \\"sweeping modal tunes mov[ing] reassuringly above the steps of a descending bass\\", while Michael Kennedy points to the 12 Humbert Wolfe settings of 1929, and the 12 Welsh folksong settings for unaccompanied chorus of 1930–31, as works of true warmth.Many of the characteristics that Holst employed — unconventional time signatures, rising and falling scales, ostinato, bitonality and occasional polytonality — set him apart from other English composers. Vaughan Williams remarked that Holst always said in his music what he wished to say, directly and concisely; \\"He was not afraid of being obvious when the occasion demanded, nor did he hesitate to be remote when remoteness expressed his purpose\\". Kennedy has surmised that Holst's economy of style was in part a product of the composer's poor health: \\"the effort of writing it down compelled an artistic economy which some felt was carried too far\\". However, as an experienced instrumentalist and orchestra member, Holst understood music from the standpoint of his players and made sure that, however challenging, their parts were always practicable. According to his pupil Jane Joseph, Holst fostered in performance \\"a spirit of practical comradeship ... none could know better than he the boredom possible to a professional player, and the music that rendered boredom impossible\\". contains an answer for the question: What was the last name of Holst's pupil?, what is it ?

Repeated pesticide use on an insect population can result in some of the insects becoming resistant to that pesticide over time. Which process is responsible for the pesticides no longer being effective on the insects?","output":"The process responsible for pesticides no longer being effective on an insect population after repeated use is known as pesticide resistance. This is a result of both the principles of natural selection and genetic variation within the insect population. Here is a detailed explanation of this process: 1. Genetic variation: Insect populations, like all living organisms, have genetic variation among individual members. This variability is a result of random mutations that occur in the DNA of each individual over time. Some of these mutations may confer a selective advantage to an individual, while others may be neutral or even harmful. 2. Exposure to pesticide: When a pesticide is applied to an insect population, it targets specific proteins, enzymes, or biological pathways in the insects, effectively killing or inhibiting their growth. Most of the individuals within the population will be susceptible to the pesticide and die as a result of exposure. 3. Survival of resistant individuals: Due to genetic variation, a small percentage of the insect population may possess a mutation that confers resistance to the pesticide. This resistance can be in the form of reduced sensitivity to the pesticide, altered target sites making it difficult for the pesticide to bind, or the ability to detoxify or metabolize the pesticide more effectively. These resistant individuals will survive the pesticide application while their susceptible peers die off. 4. Reproduction of resistant individuals: Following the reduction in population size after pesticide application, the remaining resistant individuals will reproduce to replenish the population. Since they possess a selective advantage over the susceptible individuals, their offspring will inherit the resistance traits, and the proportion of resistant insects within the population will increase. 5. Repeated pesticide use: When the same pesticide is applied to the insect population repeatedly, it creates a strong selective pressure that favors resistant insects. Over time, the prevalence of resistant individuals within the population increases, reducing the overall efficacy of the pesticide. 6. Resistance spread: Insects are known for their high reproductive rates and ability to disperse, which means that resistant individuals can quickly spread their genes throughout the population, further contributing to the reduced effectiveness of the pesticide. To summarize, pesticide resistance develops as a result of genetic variation within an insect population combined with the selective pressure exerted by the repeated application of a pesticide. This process leads to the survival and reproduction of resistant individuals at the expense of susceptible ones, ultimately reducing the efficacy of the pesticide, and making it less effective in controlling the insect population. As a result, it is essential for pest management programs to employ integrated strategies and rotate the use of different pesticide classes to delay the development of resistance and sustain their effectiveness in controlling insect pests."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Is the sentiment of the following sentence positive or negative? cheesy dialogue","output":"The sentiment of the sentence \\"cheesy dialogue\\" is generally considered negative. The adjective \\"cheesy\\" is used to describe something that is of low quality, clichéd, or lacking originality. It often indicates that the speaker finds the dialogue in question to be trite, predictable, or corny. Therefore, the sentiment is negative since it presents a critical view of the dialogue mentioned. When the term \\"cheesy\\" is applied to something, it implies that the thing being referred to does not meet the standards expected by the person making the statement. It can be used to criticize various aspects of popular culture, such as movies, books, music, and even products or advertising. In this case, it is specifically referring to dialogue, which can either be spoken or written words exchanged between two or more characters in a story, movie, or play. Dialogue is a crucial component of any narrative since it allows the audience to learn about characters, follow the plot, and understand the relationships between the characters. Cheesy dialogue can hinder the audience's connection to the story, making it harder for them to engage with the material. It can also give a sense of laziness or carelessness on the part of the creators, which can negatively impact the overall impression of the work. However, it is essential to consider the context in which the sentence is being used, as the same phrase might be intended to have a different connotation based on who is uttering it and in what situation. For example, if someone appreciates cheesy or campy content for its humorous or nostalgic value, the sentiment could be seen as more positive or neutral. Nonetheless, the most common interpretation of this phrase would be negative due to the implications of poor quality and lack of creativity. In conclusion, the sentiment of the sentence \\"cheesy dialogue\\" is typically seen as negative, as it expresses dissatisfaction or disdain for the quality of the dialogue in question. It suggests that the dialogue is unoriginal and does not meet the speaker's standards for engaging and compelling content. However, context plays a crucial role in understanding the exact sentiment conveyed, so it is essential to consider the circumstances in which the phrase is used before judging whether it is entirely negative, positive, or neutral."},{"instruction":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

Scientists at Washington University, Indiana University and University of California found that listeners could accurately tell the height of speakers, just by their voices. And the key to this mystery is a sound known as the subglottal resonance . It _ with height and helps us build a mental picture of a person. \\"The best way to think about subglottal resonances is to imagine blowing into a glass bottle with water. The less water in the bottle, the lower sound,\\" said John Morton, a scientist at Washington University. And it's the same for humans. The frequency of the subglottal resonance depends on the height. The taller we are, the deeper the resonance frequency is. In order to find out whether people could identify the resonance, scientists did experiments. A number of same-sex pairs of different heights were told to read the same sentence aloud. It was played back to listeners who had to choose which one of the pairs was taller. Then, other listeners had to rank the speakers from the shortest to the tallest. The listeners were able to identify the tall people 62.17% of time, much higher than a lucky guess. Why not try the experiment yourself? Find out if your tall friends have deeper voices.

Paragraph :  Inhaling, or breathing in, increases the size of the chest, which decreases air pressure inside the lungs.  Question:   If Mona is running a race and her chest expands, what happens to the amount of air pressure in her lungs increases or decreases? A:","output":"When Mona is running a race and experiences chest expansion, the amount of air pressure in her lungs decreases. This phenomenon occurs due to the inhalation process. As Mona breathes in, her chest increases in size, causing the volume within her lungs to expand as well.  According to Boyle's Law, which describes the relationship between the pressure and volume of a gas at a constant temperature, as the volume of a container (in this case, Mona's lungs) increases, the pressure within the container decreases, and vice versa. This inverse relationship between volume and pressure ensures that, as Mona's chest expands, the pressure inside her lungs decreases. The decreased air pressure inside her lungs generates a pressure gradient between the atmosphere and the lungs. The atmospheric pressure then becomes greater than the pressure inside her lungs. As a result, fresh air from the environment flows into Mona's lungs, providing her with the necessary oxygen for respiration and energy production, essential for her muscles to keep running during the race. In summary, when Mona runs a race and her chest expands, the air pressure inside her lungs decreases due to the increase in lung volume according to Boyle's Law. This allows her to intake oxygen-rich air to meet her body's increased demand for respiration and energy production during physical activity."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

One being that it is set in a depressing time and place, and the way Greene depicts his characters, at times, made me sick and I had to put the book down just imagining what they looked like. I really felt depressed while reading this book. It was not uplifting at all. And as Faulkner said in his Nobel Prize Speech 'it is the duty of the writer to uplift the audience and help their spirits soar high.' This book didn't even increase my pulse. Does this product review convey a negative or positive sentiment? Answer:","output":"The product review undeniably conveys a negative sentiment. The reviewer explicitly shares their dissatisfaction with multiple aspects of the book, which varies from its setting to its character depiction.  Firstly, they mention that the book is placed in a 'depressing time and place'—a factor which doesn't seem to resonate well with their reading preferences. This detail points us towards the recipient's unpleasant experience, thus contributing to the overall negative sentiment they're conveying.  Secondly, the writer’s manner of portraying characters appears to have had a profoundly unsettling effect on them. It's mentioned that certain descriptions were so appalling that they felt 'sick' and were obliged to put the book down. An overt show of such strong repulsion emphasizes the negative sentiment driving the review. Finally, the reviewer articulates their unhappiness with the book's failure to uplift them or intrigue them in any manner. They even cite a quote by William Faulkner to highlight this disappointment, reiterating the book's inability to fulfill what they perceive as a crucial function of literature—to help uplift the reader's spirit and incite noticeable emotions. The fact that the book didn't excite them or increase their pulse further underscores the extent of their dissatisfaction. In conclusion, the book review expresses a solidly negative sentiment. The reviewer's choice of language, their reaction to the book's various features, and their overall disenchanted reading experience make it amply clear that they didn't derive enjoyment or positive insights from the book. Looking from their perspective, the book seems to be a far cry from their expectations—something that they characterize as 'terrible' and even 'boring.'"},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

What character has been played by Howard Marion Crawford, Jude Law, Nigel Bruce and, in 2012, Martin Freeman What is the answer?","output":"The character that has been played by Howard Marion Crawford, Jude Law, Nigel Bruce, and, in 2012, Martin Freeman is Dr. John H. Watson, who is a prominent figure in the Sherlock Holmes series written by Sir Arthur Conan Doyle. He is typically depicted as Sherlock Holmes's best friend and assistant. Howard Marion-Crawford, a British actor, portrayed Dr. Watson in the 1954 television series \\"Sherlock Holmes\\" where the iconic detective was played by Ronald Howard. Crawford offered a classic interpretation of Watson, portraying him as a competent sidekick to Holmes.  Nigel Bruce, another English actor, was famous for his portrayal of Dr. Watson in both the film and radio adaptations of Sherlock Holmes between 1939 and 1946. Bruce's interpretation of Watson is perhaps one of the most recognized, with his portrayal emphasizing the character's unfaltering loyalty, though he also emphasized Watson as a rather bumbling and comedic figure. His on-screen chemistry with Basil Rathbone, who played Holmes, is still celebrated today. Jude Law assumed the highly-acknowledged role as Dr. Watson in Guy Ritchie's more recent cinematic adaptations of Sherlock Holmes in 2009 and its sequel in 2011. Law's Watson was capable, reliable, and savvy, providing a strong counterbalance to Robert Downey Jr's quirky interpretation of Holmes.  In 2012, Martin Freeman took over the role of Watson in the BBC series \\"Sherlock\\", set in modern-day London. Freeman's Watson, a war veteran and a medical doctor, is shown to be not just an assistant but an equal who contributes significantly to the crime-solving duo. His subtle portrayal presents a multifaceted Watson who is compassionate yet tough, intelligent yet humble, and provides the required grounding to Benedict Cumberbatch's high-functioning sociopath version of Sherlock Holmes. Overall, the character of Dr. Watson has been depicted in numerous ways, with each actor bringing their own interpretation and strengths to the role. Despite the varying portrayals, there are consistencies in every depiction of Dr. Watson, and these primarily revolve around his unwavering loyalty to Holmes and his integral role in their investigations."},{"instruction":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

Please answer the following question: Process: - The carafe is filled with water - The water is poured into the machine at the back - Coffee beans are put into a grinder - The grinder is activated - A filter is put into the coffee maker - The ground coffee is put into the filter - Sometimes a bit of salt is added to the grounds to bring out flavor - The top of the machine is closed - The power is turned on - The water passes through the grounds and becomes coffee.  Question: suppose the water leaking out happens, how will it affect the water levels increasing.  How does the supposed perturbation influence the second effect mentioned. Answer by more, less or no effect Answer:","output":"If the water in the carafe is filled and there is a leakage when it is poured into the machine at the back, this will lead to a decrease in the overall water levels in the coffee machine reservoir. This is because not all of the water intended for the coffee-making process is effectively making its way into the machine, with a portion being lost due to the leakage. The reduced water levels in the machine reservoir will have a direct influence on the second effect mentioned, which is the process of the water passing through the coffee grounds to become coffee. With less water available in the reservoir, the amount of water that can pass through the coffee grounds is limited, resulting in less coffee being produced overall. The lower water levels also mean that the grounds may be under-extracted, which could lead to weaker, less flavorful coffee. Furthermore, the reduced water levels may also affect the infusion of salt added to the grounds (if used) to enhance the flavor. As less water passes through the coffee grounds and salt, the extraction of flavor-enhancing minerals may be reduced, which may lead to a lessened effect of the salt on the taste of the coffee. In summary, the leakage of water in the described coffee-making process will lead to a decrease in the water levels in the coffee machine reservoir. This perturbation has a direct effect on the subsequent stages of the brewing process, resulting in less coffee being produced and potentially weaker, less flavorful coffee. The influence of the salt, in this case, may also be less pronounced due to the lower water levels and reduced extraction of flavor-enhancing minerals."},{"instruction":"You are a teacher.

In its early days the orchestra secured profitable recording contracts and important engagements including the Glyndebourne Festival Opera and the concerts of the Royal Philharmonic Society. After Beecham's death in 1961 the orchestra's fortunes declined steeply; it battled for survival until the mid-1960s, when its future was secured after an Arts Council report recommended that it should receive public subsidy; a further crisis arose in the same era when it seemed that the orchestra's right to call itself \\"Royal\\" could be withdrawn. Since Beecham's death the RPO has had seven chief conductors, including Rudolf Kempe, Antal Dorati, Andre Previn and Vladimir Ashkenazy, and most recently Charles Dutoit. In 1932 the conductor Sir Thomas Beecham had founded the London Philharmonic Orchestra (LPO), which, with the backing of rich supporters, he ran until 1940, when finances dried up in wartime. Beecham left to conduct in Australia and then the US; the orchestra continued without him after reorganising itself as a self-governing body. On Beecham's return to England in September 1944 the LPO welcomed him back, and in October they gave a concert together that drew superlatives from the critics. Over the next months Beecham and the orchestra gave further concerts with considerable success, but the LPO players, now their own employers, declined to give him the unfettered control he had exercised in the 1930s. If he were to become chief conductor again it would be as a paid employee of the orchestra. Beecham responded, \\"I emphatically refuse to be wagged by any orchestra ... I am going to found one more great orchestra to round off my career.\\" In 1945 he conducted the first concert of Walter Legge's new Philharmonia Orchestra, but was not disposed to accept a salaried position from Legge, his former assistant, any more than from his former players in the LPO. His new orchestra to rival the Philharmonia would, he told Legge, be launched in \\"the most auspicious circumstances and eclat\\".  In 1946 Beecham reached an agreement with the Royal Philharmonic Society: his new orchestra would replace the LPO at all the Society's concerts. He thus gained the right to name the new ensemble the \\"Royal Philharmonic Orchestra\\", an arrangement approved by George VI. Beecham arranged with the Glyndebourne Festival that the RPO should be the resident orchestra at Glyndebourne seasons. He secured backing, including that of record companies in the US as well as Britain, with whom lucrative recording contracts were negotiated. The music critic Lyndon Jenkins writes:  Naturally, it quickly became known that he was planning another orchestra, at which the cry \\"He'll never get the players!\\" went up just as it had done in 1932. Beecham was unmoved: \\"I always get the players,\\" he retorted. \\"Among other considerations, they are so good they refuse to play under anybody but me\\".

Please answer the following question: The primary role of red blood cells in the circulatory system is to transport oxygen to the tissues. The actual carrier of oxygen molecules is the protein hemoglobin, which binds to the oxygen and moves it throughout the body, releasing it in areas where the concentration of dissolved oxygen is low. A certain mutation in the gene for hemoglobin causes a slight change in the structure of this crucial protein, resulting in a disease called sickle-cell anemia. For people with this mutation, the hemoglobin produced by their red blood cells has a tendency to clump together, distorting the shape of the red blood cells and giving rise to the crescent-shaped cells seen above. By understanding the changes in structure that are the underlying cause of this disease, we have developed various ways to treat and manage this illness.  Doctor Jones studied two teams of workers. Team one had healthy people with normal red blood cell levels, but team two had people with sickle-cell anemia. the differences in health parameters were amazing and obvious.

Given the question: I have a test where I am given the following article, what is an answer for the question: Who has the right to have the accusation tried by a jury of nine jurors? ?  In Sweden, juries are uncommon; the public is represented in the courts by means of lay judges (nämndemän). However, the defendant has the right to a jury trial in the lower court (tingsrätt) when accused of an offense against the fundamental laws on freedom of expression and freedom of the press. If a person is accused of e.g. libel or incitement to ethnic or racial hatred, in a medium covered by the fundamental laws (e.g. a printed paper or a radio programme), she has the right to have the accusation tried by a jury of nine jurors. This applies also in civil (tort) cases under the fundamental laws. A majority of at least six jurors must find that the defendant has committed the alleged crime. If it does not, the defendant is acquitted or, in a civil case, held not liable. If such a majority of the jurors hold that said crime has in fact been committed, this finding is not legally binding for the court; thus, the court (three judges) can still acquit the defendant or find him/her not liable. A jury acquittal may not be overruled after appeal. In Swedish civil process, the \\"English rule\\" applies to court costs. Earlier, a court disagreeing with a jury acquittal could, when deciding on the matter of such costs, set aside the English rule, and instead use the American rule, that each party bears its own expense of litigation. This practice was declared to violate the rule of presumption of innocence according to article 6.2. of the European Convention on Human Rights, by the Supreme Court of Sweden, in 2012. The answer is:","output":"In Sweden, a person accused of an offense against the fundamental laws on freedom of expression and freedom of the press, such as libel or incitement to ethnic or racial hatred in a medium covered by the fundamental laws (e.g. a printed paper or a radio programme), has the right to have the accusation tried by a jury of nine jurors.

Question: suppose less birth control pills used happens, how will it affect MORE igneous rock forming.  How does the supposed perturbation influence the second effect mentioned. Answer by more, less or no effect Answer:","output":"To analyze the relationship between the use of birth control pills and the formation of igneous rocks, we need to consider the steps and factors involved in both processes: 1. Birth control pill usage: This is related to human population control and management. It directly affects the number of births and indirectly impacts resource usage, including any potential impact on the geological processes. 2. Igneous rock formation: As described in the given process, igneous rocks are formed from the cooling and solidification of magma. Factors affecting igneous rock formation mainly include volcanic activity, temperature, pressure, and the composition of the magma. Considering these two processes, there is no apparent direct connection between the use of birth control pills and the formation of igneous rocks. It's worth noting that human activities may have indirect effects on the planet's geology, climate, and ecosystems.

Options: - television - attic - corner - they cannot clean corner and library during football match they cannot need that - ground  Explain why a human would choose \\"television\\" to answer the question above: A:","output":"A human would choose \\"television\\" as the answer to the question above for several reasons. The question refers to preventing glare during a big football game and the context of watching a football game gives us a solid clue to choose \\"television\\" among the given options. Firstly, watching a football game, especially a big one, is typically an activity enjoyed by spectators on a television screen. Whether they are at home, at a friend's house or in a sports bar, the most common and convenient way for people to watch the game is on a television. This allows them to view the game comfortably, follow all the action closely, and even hear the commentary for a more informed and immersive experience. Secondly, glare can be a significant issue while watching a football game on a television screen, especially if the screen is dusty or the room has direct sunlight or bright LED lights shining on it. Glare on the television screen may cause difficulty in seeing the game clearly or may create an uncomfortable viewing experience. In order to fully enjoy the big football game, it is crucial to have a clear and unobstructed view of the screen without any glare obstructing the visuals. Among the options provided, cleaning an attic, a corner, or a library are irrelevant to the context of watching a football game and preventing glare. The ground, on the other hand, could refer to the football stadium, but it is not the responsibility of an individual watching the game to clean the stadium. Moreover, cleaning the stadium would not prevent glare for those watching the game from home or elsewhere on television. Therefore, it makes perfect sense for a human to choose \\"television\\" as the answer since cleaning the dust off a television helps reduce glare on the screen, providing a better and more enjoyable viewing experience during the big football game. By ensuring that the television screen is clean and dust-free, the viewer can enjoy the football match without any distractions, focusing on the excitement that the game brings."},{"instruction":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

His parents were Rabbi Mayer Samuel Weisz (1829-1892) and Cecilia Steiner (1841-1913). Houdini was one of seven children: Herman M. (1863-1885) who was Houdini's half-brother, by Rabbi Weisz's first marriage; Nathan J. (1870-1927); Gottfried William (1872-1925); Theodore (1876-1945); Leopold D. (1879-1962); and Carrie Gladys (1882-1959), who was left almost blind after a childhood accident. Weisz arrived in the United States on July 3, 1878, on the SS Fresia with his mother (who was pregnant) and his four brothers. In 1904, the London Daily Mirror newspaper challenged Houdini to escape from special handcuffs that it claimed had taken Nathaniel Hart, a locksmith from Birmingham, five years to make. Houdini accepted the challenge for March 17 during a matinee performance at London's Hippodrome theater. It was reported that 4000 people and more than 100 journalists turned out for the much-hyped event. The escape attempt dragged on for over an hour, during which Houdini emerged from his \\"ghost house\\" (a small screen used to conceal the method of his escape) several times. On one occasion he asked if the cuffs could be removed so he could take off his coat. The Mirror representative, Frank Parker, refused, saying Houdini could gain an advantage if he saw how the cuffs were unlocked. Houdini promptly took out a pen-knife and, holding the knife in his teeth, used it to cut his coat from his body. Some 56 minutes later, Houdini's wife appeared on stage and gave him a kiss. Many thought that in her mouth was the key to unlock the special handcuffs. However, it has since been suggested that Bess did not in fact enter the stage at all, and that this theory is unlikely due to the size of the 6-inch key Houdini then went back behind the curtain. After an hour and ten minutes, Houdini emerged free. As he was paraded on the shoulders of the cheering crowd, he broke down and wept. Houdini later said it was the most difficult escape of his career.  After Houdini's death, his friend Martin Beck was quoted in Will Goldston's book, Sensational Tales of Mystery Men, as admitting that Houdini was bested that day and had appealed to his wife, Bess, for help. Goldston goes on to claim that Bess begged the key from the Mirror representative, then slipped it to Houdini in a glass of water. It was stated in the book The Secret Life of Houdini that the key required to open the specially designed Mirror handcuffs was 6 inches long, and could not have been smuggled to Houdini in a glass of water. Goldston offered no proof of his account, and many modern biographers have found evidence (notably in the custom design of the handcuffs) that the Mirror challenge may have been arranged by Houdini and that his long struggle to escape was pure showmanship.  This escape was discussed in depth on the Travel Channel's Mysteries at the Museum in an interview with Houdini expert, magician and escape artist Dorothy Dietrich of Scranton's Houdini Museum.  A full-sized design of the same Mirror Handcuffs, as well as a replica of the Bramah style key for it, is on display to the public at The Houdini Museum in Scranton, Pennsylvania. This set of cuffs is believed to be one of only six in the world, some of which are not on display.

Given the question: I have a new situation: Two villages experienced flooding this spring. Berg village used many sandbags to protect from the dam overflowing. Creek village didn't use any sandbags, they were caught by surprise.  But I can use this background: People protect areas that might flood with dams. In dire situations, they use sandbags ( Figure below ). Dams are usually very effective, but high water levels sometimes cause a dam to break. In that case, flooding can be catastrophic. Flood waters can also overflow a dam. People may line a river bank with levees to protect against floods. These are high walls that keep the stream within its banks during floods. Flood protection in one location sometimes causes problems elsewhere. For example, a levee in one location may just force the high water upstream or downstream. This will lead to flooding in a different location. Sometimes water gets so high that the river must be allowed to flood.  What is an answer for this question: Which village was more affected by the dam overflowing? The answer is:","output":"Creek village was more affected by the dam overflowing. The background information provided highlights various flood protection measures that people employ to protect areas from flooding. In the case of Berg village and Creek village, both experienced flooding due to the dam overflowing this spring. However, their response to the situation and subsequent impacts varied greatly. Berg village was proactive in their approach and used sandbags to protect their area from the dam overflowing. Sandbags are a common and effective method of flood protection. They can be stacked to create a temporary barrier that helps to prevent or reduce water flow into the protected area. While sandbags may not completely eliminate the risk of flooding, they can certainly mitigate the level of potential damage by decreasing the amount of water that enters the community and protecting vital infrastructure or buildings. On the other hand, Creek village did not use any sandbags to protect their area, as they were caught by surprise. Without this added protection, Creek village was likely more vulnerable to the full force of the flood waters and may have experienced a higher degree of damage and destruction. The lack of sandbags would have allowed water to flow more freely into the community, resulting in a greater amount of water infiltration, damage to structures, and potential danger to residents. Furthermore, high walls like levees mentioned in the background information are also employed to protect against floods, but it is not clear if either village used such a protection measure. If neither village had levees, then Creek village being unprotected by sandbags added to their vulnerability during the dam overflow. In conclusion, given their lack of preparation and absence of sandbag barriers to protect their area during the dam overflow, Creek village was more affected by the flooding than Berg village. While Berg village's proactive use of sandbags likely reduced the overall impact of the flood in their area, Creek village was more exposed and therefore faced more significant consequences from the overflow."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Read this article and answer this question Still looking for their first win of the season, the Browns went home for a Week 4 AFC North duel with the Cincinnati Bengals in Round 1 of 2009's Battle of Ohio. Due to quarterback Brady Quinn's poor performance in the season thus far, head coach Eric Mangini named quarterback Derek Anderson the starter. Cleveland would trail early in the first quarter as Bengals quarterback Carson Palmer completed a 5-yard touchdown pass to wide receiver Chad Ochocinco. The Browns would continue to struggle in the second quarter as defensive end Robert Geathers returned a fumble 75 yards for a touchdown. Cleveland would respond with Anderson completing a 1-yard touchdown pass to tight end Steve Heiden. The Browns would tie the game in the third quarter with Anderson's 1-yard touchdown run. Afterwards, Cleveland would take the lead in the fourth quarter with a 26-yard and a 31-yard field goal from kicker Billy Cundiff. However, Cincinnati answered with Palmer hooking up with Ochocinco again on a 2-yard touchdown run (with a blocked PAT). In overtime, both teams went back and forth with their possessions. In the end, the Bengals emerged victorious with kicker Shayne Graham kicking the game-winning 31-yard field goal.

You will be given a task. You must generate a detailed and long answer. John sang a song and danced to the music. How would you consider the linguistic integrity of the preceding sentence? Options are:  -unacceptable.  -acceptable.","output":"The linguistic integrity of the preceding sentence, \\"John sang a song and danced to the music,\\" can be categorized as acceptable. Here is the detailed analysis to support this classification based on several linguistic dimensions: 1. Syntax: The sentence follows the standard subject-verb-object (SVO) structure commonly used in English sentences. \\"John\\" serves as the subject, \\"sang\\" as the main verb, and \\"a song\\" as the object in the first part of the sentence. The sentence's second part follows a similar pattern with \\"danced\\" as the verb and \\"the music\\" as the object. Overall, the syntactical structure is sound and allows readers or listeners to understand the actions performed by the subject. 2. Semantics: Semantically, the sentence conveys a clear meaning. The verbs \\"sang\\" and \\"danced\\" succinctly convey the actions John is performing, while the objects \\"a song\\" and \\"the music\\" specify what he is singing and dancing to, respectively. The conjunction \\"and\\" connects these two parts, effectively communicating that John performed both actions simultaneously or consecutively. As a result, the sentence has a coherent and intelligible semantic structure. 3. Grammar: Grammatically, the sentence uses proper verb tenses, articles, and pronouns. The past tense forms of the verbs \\"sing\\" and \\"dance\\" are utilized correctly to depict John's actions in the past. The indefinite article \\"a\\" preceding \\"song\\" and the definite article \\"the\\" preceding \\"music\\" exemplify appropriate usage as well. Hence, the grammar in this sentence is correct and consistent. 4. Punctuation: The punctuation within the sentence is also fitting. The full stop (period) at the end marks the sentence's conclusion, and no other punctuation marks are necessary since the sentence's meaning is concise and readily comprehensible. The sentence does not contain any complex structures that might require additional punctuation. 5. Readability and Style: The sentence is easily readable and adheres to a simple, clear style. Using two verbs (\\"sang\\" and \\"danced\\") and their respective objects (\\"a song\\" and \\"the music\\") allows the reader or listener to quickly grasp John's actions without confusion. The conjunction \\"and\\" also helps maintain a smooth narrative flow by linking the two related actions. Given the above analysis, the linguistic integrity of the sentence is acceptable as it has a well-structured syntax, conveys a clear meaning, follows grammatical rules, uses appropriate punctuation, and has an easily digestible style."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Ma had put a stack of clean clothes at the foot of the bed for me. I dressed without caring what I put on. The only important items were my cowboy boots and my Roy Rogers belt with two holsters for cap guns, even though I only had one cap gun left, and its trigger was broken. When I used the toilet, I sat on the front edge of the seat, watching the water beneath me, and scooted off as soon as I was done. I had seen a cartoon in a book at Grandpa Abner's that showed a fish leaping out of a toilet bowl and a woman staring at it with big eyes. I thought that was funny and I knew it was impossible, but I didn't think there was any reason to take chances. Ma called, \\"Little Bit has to use the bathroom.\\" I yelled, \\"I'm almost done.\\" Ma called, \\"Are you off the toilet?\\" I yelled, \\"Yes!\\" Ma opened the door and brought Little Bit in.

Tomin A:","output":"Title: The Enigma of Vala Genre: Romance, Sci-Fi, Adventure Plot: Part 1: Introducing the Protagonists In the year 2137, the Earth is now facing overpopulation and resource depletion. Due to this impending crisis, an advanced international space organization, called the Global Aerospace Alliance (GAA), embarks on a mission to search for habitable planets in an effort to ensure humanity's survival.  Vala Crain is a brilliant and skilled astronaut from the GAA, selected to be the mission's technical lead. With a profound sense of exploration and a strong desire to contribute to this mission's success, she is fearless, taking on each challenge with determination and grace.  Tomin Dallas, a highly regarded aerospace engineer, is assigned to work alongside Vala. Despite being a reserved and introverted person, Tomin's passion for engineering space travel technology has earned him a position in the GAA mission.  Part 2: The Mission  As Vala and Tomin work closely during preparation for the mission, they begin to develop strong feelings for each other. However, due to the intensity and high stakes of their work, they feel it is inappropriate to act on these feelings and maintain a strictly professional relationship.  With the spaceship \\"The Genesis\\" ready for launch, all crew members are invited to a farewell party before leaving Earth. Despite their undeclared fascination for each other, Vala and Tomin share a dance and a deep conversation about their hopes and fears. Their bond deepens, as they embrace the uncertainty of the perilous journey ahead. Part 3: The Enigma As the mission progresses, The Genesis approaches an undiscovered and intriguing planet hidden behind a nebula, which they name Enigma. The crew members, captivated by the prospect of finding a new home, send a landing crew, including Vala and Tomin, to further investigate its potential habitability. Upon landing on Enigma, the crew discovers that the planet holds a secret - it has a unique property that cures every known illness, diseases and even aging. This astounding revelation leads to divided opinions among the crew members, with some believing that they shouldn't disrupt this unique ecosystem, while others argue that they could save humanity and rejuvenate Earth with its healing powers. Part 4: The Pivotal Moment With the dilemma weighing heavy on them, Vala reaches the tipping point and questions whether humanity deserves the power to utilize such a resource at the cost of Enigma's purity. Tomin, torn between his love for Vala and his commitment to humanity's survival, is asked by Vala to make a decision. Despite the magnitude of the situation, he chooses to ask Vala to stay with him on Enigma, abandoning their mission and letting Earth fend for itself. Part 5: The Resolution This proposal deeply shakes Vala, whose sole purpose since childhood has been to protect Earth and contribute to humanity's survival. She struggles with the thought of leaving behind her life's work, despite her genuine love for Tomin. In the end, she recognizes that there is more to living than solely focusing on one's duty, and that love and happiness should be a part of it. She agrees to stay with Tomin on Enigma, but with one condition: they must work together towards finding a solution that protects Enigma while benefiting humanity. The movie ends with Vala and Tomin, hand in hand, as they begin a new life on Enigma, devoted to each other and their shared mission to find a solution for the coexistence of humanity and the newly discovered planet."},{"instruction":"Explain how you used the definition to come up with the answer.

Hundreds of... (Associated Press)      The mob of men beat 27-year-old Farkhunda before throwing her body off a roof, running over it with a car, setting it on fire and throwing it into a river near a well-known mosque.      The attack was apparently sparked by allegations that Farkhunda, who like many Afghans has just one name, had set fire to a Quran. But Afghanistan's most senior detective said no evidence had been found to support those claims.      Video of the assault taken with cellphones has circulated widely since the attack on Thursday. The killing has shocked many Afghans and led to renewed calls for justice and reform.      \\"We want justice for Farkhunda, we want justice for Afghan women. All these injustices happening to Afghan women are unacceptable,\\" said a prominent women's rights activist who goes by the name Dr. Alima.      \\"In which religion or faith is it acceptable to burn a person to death? Today is a day of national mourning and we will not keep quiet.\\"      President Ashraf Ghani, now in Washington on his first state visit to the United States since taking office in September, condemned the killing as a \\"heinous attack\\" and ordered an investigation.      Following allegations that police stood by and did nothing to stop the killing, Ghani told reporters before leaving for the U.S. that the incident revealed \\"a fundamental issue\\" — that security forces are too focused on the fight against the Taliban insurgency to concentrate on community policing.      Many rights activists, however, said the killing cut to the core of how women are treated as second-class citizens in Afghan society.      Despite constitutional guarantees of equal rights and advances in access to health and education, for many women in Afghanistan little has changed since the 2001 U.S.-led invasion ended the Taliban's harsh rule. Girls are routinely married off as children, traded as chattels and then rarely permitted to leave their homes without a male relative.      Hundreds of people gathered at a graveyard Sunday in the middle-class suburb near Farkhunda's home. With the permission of her father, the women in black carried her coffin from an ambulance to an open-air prayer ground, and then to her grave, rituals that are usually attended only by men.      \\"She is a sister to you all, and it is your duty to bury her,\\" Farkhunda's brother Najibullah, standing graveside, told the crowd.      Several politicians, officials and senior police officers addressed the funeral, which was broadcast live. Men formed a chain around the women pallbearers to offer protection and support.      The attack appeared to have grown out of a dispute between Farkhunda, a veiled woman who had just finished a degree in religious studies and was preparing to take a teaching post, and men who sold amulets at Shah-Do Shamshera shrine, where the killing happened.      She regarded the amulet sellers as parasites and told women not to waste their money on them, friends and family said. Her father, Mohammed Nadir, said the men responded by making false accusations that she had torched a Quran.      \\"Based on their lies, people decided Farkhunda was not a Muslim and beat her to death,\\" he said. The Interior Ministry said it was providing extra protection for the family.      The head of the ministry's criminal investigation directorate, Gen. Mohammad Zahir, said 13 people had been arrested in connection with the killing, including two men who sold amulets. The Interior Ministry said 13 policemen had been suspended pending investigation.      Zahir said authorities were \\"unable to find any single iota of evidence to support claims that she had burned a Quran.\\"      \\"She is completely innocent,\\" he said.      ___      Follow Lynne O'Donnell on Twitter at www.twitter.com/lynnekodonnell ||||| Image copyright AP Image caption Women's rights and civil society activists helped bury Farkhunda at the funeral in Kabul      The coffin of a woman, killed by a mob in Kabul on an apparently false charge, has been carried by women, marking a break with Afghan funeral customs.      Hundreds of people attended a funeral for the woman, named as Farkhunda, demanding her killers be punished.      Farkhunda had been accused of burning the Koran, but an official investigator said there was no evidence for this.      The attack on the woman, as well as the alleged failure of police to intervene, have been heavily criticised.      Afghan President Ashraf Ghani said he had ordered an investigation into the killing.      Footage of the attack, filmed on mobile phones, has been widely circulated on social media.      Image copyright Reuters Image caption The mourners demanded justice for Farkhunda      Image copyright Reuters Image caption A relative said Farkhunda, seen here on a placard at the funeral, was training to become a teacher      A mob, largely made up of men, attacked the woman with sticks and stones, beating her to death before setting her body alight, while police reportedly looked on.      Witnesses said the crowd had accused the woman of burning a copy of the Koran.      The attack, near the Shah-Du-Shamshaira mosque and shrine, is thought to have been the first of its kind in Afghanistan.      At the funeral on Sunday, women's activists carried the coffin, breaking with tradition as men usually perform that role.      An interior ministry official in charge of investigating the case said he had found no evidence that the woman had burnt the Koran.      \\"Farkhunda was totally innocent,\\" Gen Mohammad Zahir told reporters. He said 13 people, including eight police officers, had been arrested.      Image copyright AFP Image caption A blackened area by the river marks the spot where the woman's body was burned      Image copyright Getty Images Image caption The woman was attacked outside the Shah-Du-Shamshaira mosque in Kabul      Earlier claims that the woman was mentally ill have also been contradicted by a relative and a neighbour.      Farkhunda's brother told Reuters news agency that his sister was training to be a religious teacher. He said her father had said she was ill after hearing of her death, out of a desire to protect the rest of the family.      A neighbour of the family, interviewed by the Associated Press, also said the woman had no history of mental problems and had been training as a teacher.      The US has spent millions of dollars on programmes designed to empower and educate Afghan women.      However, women in much of the country still suffer discrimination, and attacks on them often go unpunished. ||||| KABUL A woman killed by an angry mob in front of police in the Afghan capital last week for allegedly burning a copy of Islam's holy book was wrongly accused, Afghanistan's top criminal investigator said on Sunday.      Mobile phone footage circulating on social media shows police at the scene did not save the 27-year-old woman, Farkhunda, who was beaten with sticks and set on fire by a crowd of men in central Kabul in broad daylight on Thursday.      \\"Last night I went through all documents and evidence once again, but I couldn’t find any evidence to say Farkhunda burnt the Holy Koran,\\" General Mohammad Zahir told reporters at her funeral on Sunday. \\"Farkhunda was totally innocent.\\"      The top criminal investigator promised to punish all those involved and said 13 people, including eight police officers, had already been arrested.      The killing was condemned by the Afghan president and other officials, but also drew praise from some quarters, including from a prominent cleric, who asserted the men had a right to defend their Muslim beliefs at all costs.      Farkhunda was a teacher of Islamic studies, according to her brother, who denied media reports that she had been mentally ill. He said this was a made-up defense by their father, who wanted to protect the family after police told them to leave the city for their own safety.      \\"My father was frightened and made the false statement to calm people down,\\" said Najibullah, who is changing his second name to Farkhunda in memory of his sister.      Hundreds of people attended her funeral on Sunday chanting \\"we want justice\\" and her coffin was carried by women.      The United States and other countries have spent millions of dollars in Afghanistan on promoting the rule of law, justice and women's rights since the Taliban were ousted in 2001.      Under the strict Islamist rule of the Taliban, women could neither attend school nor were they allowed to work, and were forbidden from leaving the house without a male guardian.      The last decade has seen much progress: Millions of girls now attend school and women can enter employment, particularly in major cities. But in some rural areas, little has changed and hardwon rights are at risk of being reversed as aid and foreign troops are withdrawn.

News article: AstraZeneca Is Launching a Massive Gene Hunt With This Genome Pioneer AstraZeneca, working with genome pioneer Craig Venter, is launching a massive gene hunt in the most comprehensive bet yet by a pharmaceutical firm on the potential of genetic variations to unlock routes to new medicines. The initiative, announced on Friday, involves sequencing up to 2 million human genomes—the complete set of genetic code that acts as the software of life—including 500,000 DNA samples collected by AstraZeneca in global clinical trials. Financial details of the 10-year project were not disclosed but Mene Pangalos, head of early drug development, said the company would be investing “hundreds of millions of dollars.” AstraZeneca azncf aims to identify rare genetic mutations involved in every kind of disease by scanning DNA from volunteers who agreed to have their genomes sequenced and to provide access to detailed medical records. The project is made possible by a dramatic fall in the cost of genetic sequencing. It took government-funded scientists 3 billion and 13 years to sequence the first human genome by 2003. Today, it costs around 1,000 and takes just three days. AstraZeneca will work with Venter’s U.S. company Human Longevity Inc (HLI), which will sequence the genomes, including 1 million from HLI’s database, and use machine-learning software to find patterns in genetic variations. The British group, which is establishing an in-house Centre for Genomics Research in Cambridge, where it is relocating its global headquarters, has also partnered with the Wellcome Trust Sanger Institute and Finland’s Institute for Molecular Medicine. AstraZeneca is not the first drugmaker to start amassing troves of human DNA in this way but Venter, one of the first scientists to sequence the human genome, said it was the biggest commitment to date by any pharmaceutical company. Regeneron Pharmaceuticals signed a deal with Pennsylvania’s Geisinger Health System two years ago to sequence partial genomes of some 250,000 volunteers, while Roche’s Genentech unit signed a deal last year for HLI to sequence tens of thousands of genomes. “The big thing here is the magnitude of what we are trying to do,” Pangalos said. “This takes it to a completely different level and I think it is going to be relevant of every therapeutic area.” Until now, the field of genomics has largely failed to live up to the hype of hoped-for medical breakthroughs, although more recently genetic understanding has been crucial in the development of some cancer treatments. Now, thanks to industrial-scale sequencing and advances in gene editing that allow scientists to quickly test the effects of genetic variations, progress is expected to accelerate. Venter believes it could also unleash a new era of forensics, with HLI trying to predict what people might look like from their DNA. AstraZeneca’s decision to embed genomics across its research and development follows a push last year by the company to expand gene testing into areas including heart disease and asthma. “I believe we really have finally turned the corner and genomics will become central in drug development efforts,” said David Goldstein, a genetics expert from Columbia University, who chairs AstraZeneca’s Genomics Advisory Board.

MPEG audio may use bitrate switching on a per-frame basis, but only layer III decoders must support it. VBR is used when the goal is to achieve a fixed level of quality. The final file size of a VBR encoding is less predictable than with constant bitrate. Average bitrate is VBR implemented as a compromise between the two: the bitrate is allowed to vary for more consistent quality, but is controlled to remain near an average value chosen by the user, for predictable file sizes. Although an MP3 decoder must support VBR to be standards compliant, historically some decoders have bugs with VBR decoding, particularly before VBR encoders became widespread.

Premise: The girl had practically told him he wasn't in his own world. Hypothesis: He'd been told that he was in a different world. Does the premise entail the hypothesis?","output":"Step 1: Identify the main components of the premise and hypothesis. Premise: The girl had practically told him he wasn't in his own world. Main components: girl, told, not in his own world Hypothesis: He'd been told that he was in a different world. Main components: told, different world Step 2: Analyze the relationship between the main components. The premise involves the girl telling the subject that he is not in his own world. The hypothesis involves the subject being told that he is in a different world. Step 3: Assess if the premise entails the hypothesis. In logical terms, \\"not in his own world\\" is equivalent to \\"in a different world\\" since both imply the subject's current location is not the world he belongs to. The premise, that the girl told him he wasn't in his own world, supports the idea that he has been told he's in a different world, which is the hypothesis.

So, this sentence says: \\"Nutritional maintenance with a feeding tube and multiple feedings of a high-caloric diet will be necessary if the dog is unable to eat or drink without significant regurgitation.\\" Let's break it down so it's easier to understand.  Nutritional maintenance means keeping the dog's body healthy with good food, like when mom makes sure we eat all our fruits and veggies. A feeding tube is a special tool the vet uses to give food to the dog when it's having trouble eating on its own, like when we use a straw to drink our juice. A high-caloric diet means lots of food with lots of energy, like when we have a big dinner before a big day at kindergarten. Regurgitation means throwing up. So if the dog can't eat or drink without throwing up a lot, it will need this special care. Nasty, huh?"},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant. User will you give you a task.

Context: The long-awaited takeover of Universal Pictures by MCA, Inc. happened in mid-1962 as part of the MCA-Decca Records merger. The company reverted in name to Universal Pictures. As a final gesture before leaving the talent agency business, virtually every MCA client was signed to a Universal contract. In 1964 MCA formed Universal City Studios, Inc., merging the motion pictures and television arms of Universal Pictures Company and Revue Productions (officially renamed as Universal Television in 1966). And so, with MCA in charge, Universal became a full-blown, A-film movie studio, with leading actors and directors under contract; offering slick, commercial films; and a studio tour subsidiary launched in 1964. Television production made up much of the studio's output, with Universal heavily committed, in particular, to deals with NBC (which later merged with Universal to form NBC Universal; see below) providing up to half of all prime time shows for several seasons. An innovation during this period championed by Universal was the made-for-television movie.

It’s a lot safer too....I think the answer is","output":"(ii) The easiest solution is to temporarily attach a “carrier board” of the same thickness, edge to edge, using pieces of double-sided tape every 6 in. It’s a lot safer too. The reason why the second answer is more reasonable is because of the following considerations and benefits it presents: 1. Flexibility: By temporarily attaching the carrier board, you provide yourself the flexibility to remove it when it is no longer needed. This is especially helpful if you only require the additional width for a few cuts or if your workshop space is limited. 2. Preservation of board integrity: Permanently attaching a carrier board may result in damage to the original board if it ever needs to be removed. On the other hand, temporary attachment ensures the preservation of the original board and carrier board for future use or other projects. 3. Safety: Both options mention that attaching a carrier board provides a safer way to make long cuts. However, a temporary attachment reduces the likelihood of errors or accidents, especially if the carrier board becomes damaged or no longer serves its purpose effectively. 4. Easy adjustments and alignments: With a temporary attachment, adjustments to the boards can be easily made without the risk of damaging the board or the need for a complete fix to the carrier board. This method also allows you to make more accurate cuts by making small adjustments as needed while cutting through the narrow boards. 5. Cost-effective and resourceful: Since the carrier board is not permanently attached, it can be repurposed for other woodworking projects. This not only makes the most out of your existing materials but also cuts down on the overall cost of your projects. 6. Versatility: By temporarily attaching a carrier board to your narrow boards, it's easier to interchange or replace them when needed, given the different dimensions and requirements of each project you work on. To conclude, while both options might seem viable at first glance, temporary attachment of a carrier board to the narrow board emerges as the more reasonable method to make long cuts due to its flexibility, preservation of board integrity, safety, easy adjustments and alignments, cost-effectiveness, and versatility. By using this method, you can achieve your goal in a more efficient and secure manner."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant. You will be given a task.

The company, retaining the title \\"Sadler's Wells Opera\\", opened at the Coliseum on 21 August 1968, with a new production of Mozart's Don Giovanni, directed by Sir John Gielgud. Though this production was not well received, the company rapidly established itself with a succession of highly praised productions of other works. Arlen died in January 1972, and was succeeded as managing director by Lord Harewood.The success of the 1968 Mastersingers was followed in the 1970s by the company's first Ring cycle, conducted by Goodall, with a new translation by Andrew Porter and designs by Ralph Koltai.  The cast included Norman Bailey, Rita Hunter and Alberto Remedios. In Harewood's view, among the highlights of the first ten years at the Coliseum were the Ring, Prokofiev's War and Peace, and Richard Strauss's Salome and Der Rosenkavalier. The company's musical director from 1970 to 1977 was Charles Mackerras. Harewood praised his exceptional versatility, with a range \\"from The House of the Dead to Patience.\\" Among the operas he conducted for the company were Handel's Julius Caesar starring Janet Baker and Valerie Masterson; five Janáček operas; The Marriage of Figaro with pioneering use of 18th century performing style; Massenet's Werther; Donizetti's Mary Stuart with Baker; and Sullivan's Patience.

Q:Write a multi-choice question for the following article, with the given choices and answer: Article: Sitting on the peaceful coast of Galapagos Islands, Ecuador, watching the sun move quietly into the sea, you shouldn't forget that Charles Darwin (1809-1882) arrived here in 1835. He stayed on the islands for five weeks, observing various animals. This finally inspired   his famous work,On the Origin of Species. You can certainly follow Darwin's footsteps and enjoy a trip from four to seven days to the islands. The islands are certainly a paradise   for wildlife, as there are no natural killers on the islands and the number of boats and visitors is under government control. Though you cannot walk freely as Darwin did about 200 years ago, each day is as impressive as it could be. The most well-known animals of the Galapagos is the giant tortoise , which can be seen moving slowly around the highlands of Santa Cruz, the second largest island in the archipelago . Some of these creatures are so old that they might have been seen in their youth by Darwin himself. Despite strict control over activities and timing, your stay on the Galapagos will be remembered as a chain of incomparable pictures: diving with sea lions that swim and play within inches of you; feeling small sharks touch your feet as you swim; and, most magically, seeing a whale and her baby surface with a great breath of air. Travelling between the islands and observing the wildlife that so inspired Darwin, you will feel as though you are getting a special view of an untouched world. At night you will sleep on board the ship, leaving the wildlife in complete occupation of the islands, which are as undisturbed now as they have been since the beginning of time.

Write an article based on this \\"Eat more foods high in omega-3s. Try intermittent fasting. Incorporate curcumin into your diet. Increase your intake of blueberries. Use supplements. Avoid foods high in sugar and high fructose corn syrup (HFCS).\\" Article:","output":"Title: 6 Lifestyle Changes to Boost Brain Health Introduction Incorporating certain dietary and lifestyle changes can boost brain health and improve cognitive performance. Many people are unaware of the simple changes they can make to maintain a healthy mind and slow down cognitive decline. In this article, we will explore six science-based recommendations that can lead to improved memory, sharper focus, and enhanced well-being. These changes include consuming more foods rich in omega-3s, trying intermittent fasting, adding curcumin to your diet, increasing blueberry intake, using supplements, and avoiding high-sugar foods and high fructose corn syrup (HFCS). 1. Eat More Foods High in Omega-3s Omega-3 fatty acids are essential nutrients that play an important role in maintaining brain function and overall health. These nutrients can be found in fatty fish such as salmon, mackerel, and sardines, as well as plant-based sources like walnuts, flax seeds, and chia seeds. Research has shown that increased omega-3 intake can improve memory, combat depression, and reduce the risk of cognitive decline. Aim to include at least two servings of fatty fish per week or incorporate plant-based omega-3 sources into your daily meal plan. 2. Try Intermittent Fasting Intermittent fasting (IF) is a popular eating pattern that involves cycling between periods of eating and fasting. Research suggests that IF may promote brain health by reducing inflammation, increasing the production of brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF), and promoting autophagy, a process that clears damaged cells from the brain. There are several methods of IF, such as the 16/8 method (fasting for 16 hours and eating during an 8-hour window), so choose the one that works best for your lifestyle and consult with a healthcare professional before starting. 3. Incorporate Curcumin into Your Diet Curcumin, the active component in the spice turmeric, has been shown to possess powerful anti-inflammatory and antioxidant properties. A growing body of research indicates that curcumin may help to protect the brain from neurodegenerative diseases such as Alzheimer's, improve mood, and support cognitive function. Incorporate turmeric in your diet by adding it to curries, soups, or even smoothies. Consider a high-quality curcumin supplement as well, but consult with a doctor before starting any new supplement regimen. 4. Increase Your Intake of Blueberries Blueberries are not just a delicious fruit, but they also pack a powerful punch for brain health. Rich in antioxidants known as flavonoids, blueberries can help to reduce inflammation, protect the brain from oxidative stress, and improve memory and cognitive function. Add blueberries to your diet by enjoying them as a snack, topping your oatmeal or yogurt, or incorporating them into smoothies and salads. Aim for at least one serving of blueberries per day to maximize their benefits. 5. Use Supplements While a well-balanced diet can provide many of the nutrients needed for optimal brain health, supplements can help fill any gaps. Popular brain-boosting supplements include omega-3 fatty acids, B vitamins, and antioxidants such as vitamins C and E. Before starting any new supplement regimen, consult with a healthcare professional to determine which supplements are most appropriate for your needs and to ensure there are no potential interactions with medications you may be taking. 6. Avoid Foods High in Sugar and High Fructose Corn Syrup (HFCS) A diet high in sugar and HFCS has been linked to an increased risk of cognitive decline, poor memory, and the development of conditions such as Alzheimer's and dementia. To promote brain health and reduce the adverse effects of sugar on cognition, limit your intake of added sugars, and avoid foods with HFCS. This may include cutting down on sugary beverages, candy, baked goods, and processed snacks. Conclusion Boosting brain health and cognitive performance may be as simple as incorporating a few key dietary and lifestyle changes. By focusing on nutrient-rich foods, adopting healthy eating patterns, and avoiding foods that contribute to cognitive decline, you can take the first steps toward a sharper and more vibrant mind. Remember to consult with a healthcare professional before starting any new dietary or supplement regimen."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant. User will you give you a task.

Article: In 1880, Bell received the Volta Prize with a purse of 50,000 francs (approximately US250,000 in today's dollars) for the invention of the telephone from the Académie française, representing the French government. Among the luminaries who judged were Victor Hugo and Alexandre Dumas. The Volta Prize was conceived by Napoleon Bonaparte in 1801, and named in honor of Alessandro Volta, with Bell receiving the third grand prize in its history. Since Bell was becoming increasingly affluent, he used his prize money to create endowment funds (the 'Volta Fund') and institutions in and around the United States capital of Washington, D.C.. These included the prestigious 'Volta Laboratory Association' (1880), also known as the Volta Laboratory and as the 'Alexander Graham Bell Laboratory', and which eventually led to the Volta Bureau (1887) as a center for studies on deafness which is still in operation in Georgetown, Washington, D.C. The Volta Laboratory became an experimental facility devoted to scientific discovery, and the very next year it improved Edison's phonograph by substituting wax for tinfoil as the recording medium and incising the recording rather than indenting it, key upgrades that Edison himself later adopted. The laboratory was also the site where he and his associate invented his \\"proudest achievement\\", \\"the photophone\\", the \\"optical telephone\\" which presaged fibre optical telecommunications, while the Volta Bureau would later evolve into the Alexander Graham Bell Association for the Deaf and Hard of Hearing (the AG Bell), a leading center for the research and pedagogy of deafness.

Read the following paragraph and extract the answer for the question: What is it that Frank Culpepper will have none of and, instead, decide to kill the rustlers?  Ben Mockridge is a young man proud of his 4 handgun and enamored of \\"cowboyin'\\". He asks Frank Culpepper if he can join his cattle drive to Fort Lewis, Colorado. Culpepper (a reformed gunslinger) reluctantly agrees and sends Ben to the cook to be his \\"little Mary\\". Ben quickly discovers that the adults have little interest in young'ns, and no interest in \\"showing him the ropes\\". Culpepper nevertheless assigns Ben tasks the greenhorn handles poorly—or simply fails at—repeatedly causing serious trouble. After rustlers stampede the herd, Culpepper tracks them to a box canyon. When the rustlers' leader demands 50 cents a head for having rounded up and taken care of the cattle, Culpepper will have none of it. He and his hands kill the rustlers, not hesitating to gun down disarmed men, or repeatedly shoot anyone still moving. They lose four of their own in the fight. Culpepper directs Ben to a cantina a day's ride off, to find Russ Caldwell. Before he can reach the cantina, Ben is accosted by trappers who take his horse and gun. Once Ben finds Caldwell, he and three of his buddies agree to join the drive. When they cross the trappers' path, there is no parlaying—they immediately kill the trappers and take their possessions. When Ben stands night watch, he's unprepared for a one-eyed man trying to steal the horses. Instead of immediately shooting him, Ben lets the man distract him with his talk, and is overcome by another thief. Culpepper is outraged at Ben's stupidity.

Are these two sentences paraphrases of each other?","output":"No, these two sentences are not paraphrases of each other, although they share similarities in terms of subject matter and structure. They contain different information in terms of the years mentioned, which leads to discrepancies in their meanings. Let's break down the key differences between the two sentences: 1. Ferguson stayed in Monrovia until his death in 1916 in Liberia. In this sentence, we learn that Ferguson stayed in Monrovia until he passed away in 1916. Monrovia is situated within Liberia. Therefore, the sentence informs us that Ferguson lived in Monrovia, Liberia, until his death in 1916. 2. Ferguson remained in Liberia, Monrovia, in 1916 until his death in 1968. This sentence notes that Ferguson was in Monrovia, Liberia, in 1916 and stayed there until his death in 1968. It emphasizes the presence of Ferguson in Monrovia, Liberia, in 1916 and that he continued to live there until he died in 1968, which is a different year from the first sentence. In summary, these sentences convey different information about when Ferguson died and thus are not paraphrases of one another. The first sentence states Ferguson died in 1916, while the second sentence indicates his death occurred in 1968."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant. You will be given a task.

Would the following phrase be considered positive or negative? fails to fulfill its own ambitious goals","output":"To determine whether the phrase \\"fails to fulfill its own ambitious goals\\" is positive or negative, let's break down the meaning of the phrase step-by-step: 1. \\"Fails\\" - This indicates a negative result, as it implies unsuccessful performance or lack of achievement. 2. \\"to fulfill\\" - This suggests the inability to complete or achieve something, which typically carries a negative connotation. 3. \\"its own\\" - This part of the phrase implies self-ownership, meaning the subject was trying to achieve something for itself. 4. \\"ambitious goals\\" - This part implies that the goals were challenging and could be seen as admirable. Now, consider the overall tone and impression created by combining these elements. While the \\"ambitious goals\\" part may carry positive undertones, the overall focus is on the subject's failure to achieve them, emphasizing a lack of accomplishment. Combining the negative connotations regarding the failure with the subject's own goals, the entire phrase has a negative slant. Justification: The overall essence of the phrase, when put together, emphasizes the failure to achieve ambitious goals, which creates a more negative connotation."},{"instruction":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

Solve -795*r - 216 = -777*r for r.","output":"Okay, let's solve this step by step, like a puzzle, to find the value of 'r'. Here's the math problem: -795*r - 216 = -777*r 1. First, we need to move all 'r' terms to one side of the equation. Let's move the -777*r from the right side to the left side. We do this by adding 777*r to both sides:      -795*r + 777*r - 216 = -777*r + 777*r 2. Now our equation looks like this:      (-795 + 777)*r - 216 = 0 3. Now, let's solve -795 + 777:       -18*r - 216 = 0 4. Next, we need to move 216 to the right side of the equation. We do this by adding 216 to both sides:       -18*r - 216 + 216 = 0 + 216 5. Now our equation looks like this:       -18*r = 216 6. Finally, we need to find the value of 'r'. To do that, we'll divide both sides by -18:       -18*r / (-18) = 216 / (-18) 7. Now our equation looks like this:        r = -12 So, after solving the puzzle, we find out that the value of 'r' is -12."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant. You will be given a task.

The March 2000 edition had a French issue , and in 2002 a bound edition appeared .","output":"Yes, the two sentences are conveying the same meaning, although they have a slightly different structure and choice of words. Let's break down the similarities and differences between the two sentences to better understand their meaning. 1. \\"The March 2000 issue had a French edition\\": This part of the sentence states that there was a unique version of the March 2000 issue, which was translated into French, implying the existence of a separate edition in the French language. 1. \\"The March 2000 edition had a French issue\\": This part conveys the same message as the first sentence, but the words \\"edition\\" and \\"issue\\" are reversed. The meaning remains the same – there was a unique French version of the March 2000 edition. 2. \\"and a hardcover 'limited' edition appeared in 2002\\": This part of the first sentence implies that a special \\"limited\\" edition was published in 2002, and its distinct feature was that it had a hardcover binding, rather than the usual softcover. 2. \\"and in 2002 a bound edition appeared\\": This part of the second sentence conveys a similar message as the first, with a slight difference. The term \\"bound edition\\" is used here instead of \\"hardcover 'limited' edition\\". The word \\"bound\\" can refer to any type of bookbinding, including hardcover, but it does not specifically mention that it was a limited edition. However, the context suggests that the bound edition is likely a limited or special edition of the publication. In conclusion, while there are minor changes in the way the two sentences are structured, and the word choice differs somewhat, the overall meaning remains the same. Both sentences communicate that a French version of the March 2000 issue/edition was published, and in 2002, a special edition with a more durable binding (likely a limited hardcover edition) was produced."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

I can't imagine there is one honest movie goer not able to acknowledge the fine director in Le Locataire, yet both parts of the dyptic may not be thoroughly satisfactory to most people, myself included. Polanski is very good at making us feels the inner torture of his characters (Deneuve in Repulsion and himself in Le Locataire), starting with some lack of self-assurance soon to turn gradually into psychological uneasiness eventually blossoming into an irreversible physical malaise. The shared ordeal for the characters and audience is really dissimilar from the fright and tension of horror movies since there's no tangible supernatural element here. While horror movies allow for some kind of catharsis (be it cheap or more elaborate) Polanski sadistically tortures us and, if in his latter opus the dark humour is permanent, we are mostly on our nerves as opposed to on the edge of our seats. Suspense, horror, all this is a matter of playing with the audience's expectations (alternatively fooling and fulfilling them), not literally with people's nerves. In my book Rosemary's Baby is a far greater achievement because sheer paranoia and plain rationality are in constant struggle: the story is about a couple moving in a strange flat, while we are forced to identify with a sole character. What's more if the fantasy elements are all in the hero's mind the situation is most uncomfortable since we, the viewers, are compelled to judge him, reject him while we have been masterfully lured (\\"paint 'n lure\\") into being him.","output":"This person's opinion about the movies \\"Repulsion\\" and \\"Le Locataire\\" (The Tenant) directed by Roman Polanski is mostly positive.

Their final trick appears to transport one of the audience members to the vault of their bank, the CrÃ©dit RÃ©publicain in Paris, where stacks of new euro bills are stored. At the magicians' commands, the fans in the vault activate, drawing the bills into the vents and then showering the Las Vegas crowd with them. The euros are shown to be real, and the vault in Paris is found to be empty of its recent shipment of euros, leading FBI agent Dylan Rhodes (Mark Ruffalo), and Interpol agent Alma Dray (MÃ©lanie Laurent), to be partnered and investigate the Horsemen.

He received his education at the Frank Anthony Public School, Bangalore and completed his bachelor's degree in Commerce from Sri Bhagawan Mahaveer Jain College. He received training in snooker from former national Snooker champion Arvind Savur. Advani made his international competitive debut at the Asian Billiards Championship 2002, held at Bangalore, in which he finished as a finalist. After an amateur World Snooker Champion title win in 2003, he won the IBSF World Billiards Championship in 2005 at Qawra, Malta, where he became the first to achieve a \\"grand double\\" by winning both the time and point formats, a feat he repeated at the 2008 event in Bangalore. He is the only Indian to have won the amateur world title in both snooker and billiards.  He is also the youngest person to have won all these world titles in English billiards, for a record 8 times. Advani also remains the only person to have won all five national, regional, and world billiards tournaments in a single season, a feat he achieved by winning the Indian Junior National Championship and Senior National Championship, the Asian Billiards Championship, and both the World Billiards Championship (point format) and World Billiards Championship (time format).

Choose the correct sentiment from candidates: Choose from: (A). negative (B). positive TEXT:In a famous essay he wrote about Charles Dickens, George Orwell points out that many readers always regretted that Dickens never continued writing like he did in PICKWICK PAPERS: that is, he did not stick to writing funny episodic novels for the rest of his career. This would not have been too difficult for Dickens. His contemporary Robert Surtees did precisely that, only concentrating on the misadventures of the fox hunting set (MR. FANCY ROMFORD'S HOUNDS is a title of one of his novels). Among hunters and horse lovers Surtees still has a following but most people find his novels unreadable. Dickens was determined to show he was more than a funny man (and don't forget, his first book, SKETCHES BY BOZ, was also a funny book). So Dickens third book is OLIVER TWIST (which got pretty grim at points). Orwell says that for any author to grow they have to change the style of their books. Dickens would definitely (and successfully) have agreed to that. But Orwell overlooked the genre writer who transcends his fellows. Surtees, as I said, is a genre writer concentrating on hunting - but not everyone is interested in hunting. But P.G.Wodehouse saw himself as an entertainer, poking fun at the upper reaches of the British social system. His Earl of Emsworth is prouder of raising the finest pig in England than being...well Earl of Emsworth! His Psmith is always prepared to counterattack when he is supposed to be submissive to an unfair superior. His Stanley Uckridge will always have a \\"perfect\\" scheme that should net a huge profit (but always manages to come apart at the end). And best of all, his Jeeves will always put his brilliant brain to work rescuing the inept Bertie Wooster, his boss. Since Wodehouse had a limited view of his mission as a writer - he was there to do cartoon figures of fun for the entertainment of the world - his books never lost their glow. They served (and still serve) their purposes. In fact, compared Wodehouse with his far more serious contemporary Evelyn Waugh, who also wrote funny books, but of a more intellectual type. The best of Waugh remains among the high points of 20th Century British literature: BRIDESHEAD REVISITED, DECLINE AND FALL, and the rest. But in his determination to make his points, if his points failed to interest the reader the book frequently collapsed. For every VILE BODIES there was some failure late in his career like THE ORDEAL OF GILBERT PINFOLD. While Wodehouse could do lesser hack work too, his falling did not go as far as Waugh's did. Wodehouse also was a gifted lyricist (when you hear \\"Bill\\" in the score of SHOWBOAT, it is not Kern and Hammerstein's tune, but Kern and Wodehouse's tune transposed from \\"Oh Lady, Lady\\" a dozen years earlier). He was a handy dramatist too. So it is pleasing to see that he took his novel A DAMSEL IN DISTRESS and turned it into the screenplay here. It has the normal Wodehouse touches. That perfect butler Keggs (Reginald Gardiner in a wonderful performance) is a scoundrel in rigging a \\"friendly\\" gambling game of chance among the staff of the stately home he heads. He is also unable to refrain, occasionally, from singing Italian opera - despite Constance Collier's attempts to control his impulse. This is typical Wodehouse characterization. So is the way the love affair between Lady Alyce and Jerry keeps going well and going down due to the antics of Keggs and young Albert, both of whom want to win that game of chance pot of cash. Wodehouse always does that type of plot switch, with antagonists switching their point of view depending on their present state of interest. Wodehouse was also lucky here to have Burns and Allan to work with. It is generally considered that of all the films they made as supporting actors together (such as SIX OF A KIND and WE'RE NOT DRESSING) George and Gracie did their best support with Fred Astaire. The Fun House sequence, which includes the song \\"Stiff Upper Lip\\", is wonderful, as is an earlier sequence where the three do a \\"whisk broom\\" dance (that Astaire learned from Burns). But Gracie's marvelous illogical logic is used by Wodehouse in scenes with Gardiner (see how she manages to confuse him into giving her more money than her change deserves to be - only Albert happens to notice Keggs/Gardiner's mistake, and looks at Gardiner as though he's either stupid or mad). Her dialog with Lady Caroline (Collier)'s son Reggie (Ray Noble, the British band leader)leading him to imagine that he will marry her, but saying goodbye to Gracie as she drives off with George to get married is wonderful too. The film supposedly failed at the box office because of the lack of Ginger Rogers in it, and the weakness of Joan Fontaine. Fontaine is not doing a remarkable job in the role, but the flaw is really Wodehouse's - he didn't make the character very interesting. But the film can stand without that, given the other performers and their characters, Gershwin's music, and Wodehouse's marvelous sense of fun.","output":"(B). positive"},{"instruction":"Explain how you used the definition to come up with the answer.

Please answer the following question: U.S. President Donald Trump’s plan to impose tariffs of 25 percent on steel and 10 percent on aluminum has met criticism from his Republican allies in Congress, many of whom worry the measures could trigger a trade war that damages U.S. businesses. But the president does have supporters among some Senate Democrats from states where voters are concerned about the long-term loss of American manufacturing jobs. “This welcome action is long overdue for shuttered steel plants across Ohio and steelworkers who live in fear that their jobs will be the next victims of Chinese cheating,” Senator Sherrod Brown, a Democrat from Ohio, said in a statement released after the plan was announced. “If we fail to stand up for steel jobs today, China will come after other jobs up and down the supply chain tomorrow.” American labor unions have also broadly favored Trump’s proposed tariffs, saying they have been complaining for years that foreign countries frequently subsidize their own steel industries, putting American competitors at a disadvantage. Economists have been mostly critical of the plan, saying that overall it will hurt American manufacturers, some of whom may be targeted by trading partners for retaliatory sanction. They argue that the benefits to steel and aluminum workers are outweighed by job losses among Americans in other industries. A test of how much the issue is resonating with American voters comes next week, when voters in Pennsylvania’s 18th congressional district, vote in a special election to fill a vacated seat. Many voters are looking to the president to fulfill his campaign promise of protecting manufacturing jobs in America’s heartland. The race for the seat left vacant by Rep.

You must generate a detailed and long answer. Summarize this article in one sentence. Dip the end of a paintbrush into the liquid latex and paint it onto your actor’s skin. Apply the latex in a shape that looks like a natural wound so it doesn’t appear fake on camera. Spread the latex thin enough over the surface so you can barely see the skin underneath it.  You can buy liquid latex at costume stores or online. If you or someone on your film has a latex allergy, you can use white school glue instead though it may not hold as well. Lay a piece of toilet paper over the surface of the liquid latex. Press the toilet paper so it’s flat against the skin without any bubbles or deformation. Once the toilet paper is applied, carefully tear the edges of the toilet paper by hand so it matches the shape of the latex you applied. You can also use tissues if you don’t have any toilet paper. Dip your paintbrush back in the liquid latex and paint around the edges of the paper you applied so they don’t lift off of the skin. Then carefully paint over the surface of the toilet paper so the wound looks shiny and fresh. Let the latex dry completely, which should only take about 5-10 minutes. Use a hair dryer if you want to make the liquid latex dry faster. Once the latex is dry, use your fingernail or pin to tear through the center of the toilet paper. Pull the edges of the tear to the side to bunch the toilet paper up to make your wound look like it’s deep and sticking out of the skin. Keep working with the edges of the tear until you’re happy with the shape.  Be careful not to accidentally stab the person you’re applying the wound to if you’re using a pin or sharp object to tear the paper. If you don’t know what you want your wound to look like, then look up images from other horror movies or actual wounds to get ideas for reference. Follow the mixing directions on a package of gelatin and stir it until it has a syrupy consistency. Use a brush or a butter knife to apply the gelatin in thick lumps around the fake wound. Stretch the gelatin and move it around randomly to shape it. The gelatin will quickly set and dry in place. Test the temperature of the gelatin on your hand before applying it since it could be hot when you mix it. When you’re applying wounds, crush up some oatmeal or corn flakes and attach them with liquid latex. Let the latex dry completely before painting over the oatmeal to make it look like a wound. The oatmeal or corn flakes will give the wound a bumpier texture and make it seem more realistic. Use a powder or cream foundation that matches the skin tone of your actor and apply it over the entire wound as a base coat. Make sure none of the toilet paper shows through the foundation or your wound will look fake. Blend the edges of the wound into the skin with a blending sponge so it looks realistic. A foundation airbrush will give your fake wound the smoothest application, but any applicator will work for painting your wound. Use a makeup brush to add in different shades of blue, brown, purple and black around the edges of your wound. Work from the lightest to the darkest colors so they’re easier to blend. Keep painting the wound until you’re satisfied with how it looks.  You can buy makeup kits with color palettes meant for wounds from a costume shop or online. Look up pictures of the actual wound you’re trying to create so it looks authentic. Be aware that you may see some graphic images during your search. If you aren’t getting a close-up shot of the wound on camera, then you don’t need to spend time making a lot of details while you’re applying the makeup. Take some of the fake blood you’ve made and paint it on the inside of the wound so it looks it’s bleeding. Apply a thick layer of the blood on the inside of the wound so it appears wet and fresh on camera. Then, use a sponge to add some blood spatter around the outer edges of the wound so it seems like it’s dripping out. Test how the wound looks on camera to see if you need to apply more blood.

The answer is:","output":"Moon revolving around Earth. To provide a detailed explanation, the appearance of the Moon's different shapes, also known as lunar phases, is primarily caused by the Moon's revolution around the Earth. As the Moon orbits our planet, the portion of its surface illuminated by the Sun changes relative to our viewpoint on Earth. There are eight main lunar phases, and they occur in a continuous cycle approximately every 29.5 days, known as a lunar month. These phases are determined by the Moon's position in its orbit around the Earth, and the way the Sun's light reflects off the lunar surface. The main phases are: 1. New Moon: The Moon lies between the Earth and the Sun, with the dark side facing Earth. This phase is not visible as it receives no direct sunlight from our perspective. 2. Waxing Crescent: A thin, sliver of sunlight begins to illuminate the Moon's right side, as it moves away from the Sun in its orbit. 3. First Quarter: Half of the Moon's right side is illuminated, forming a shape that resembles a semicircle. 4. Waxing Gibbous: More than half of the Moon's right side is illuminated, and the illuminated portion continues to grow. 5. Full Moon: The Moon is on the opposite side of the Earth to the Sun. The entire visible side is illuminated, creating a bright, round shape in the night sky. 6. Waning Gibbous: The illumination of the Moon starts to decrease. More than half of its left side is illuminated, but less than during the Full Moon phase. 7. Third Quarter: Half of the Moon's left side is illuminated, forming a shape that looks like a mirror image of the First Quarter. 8. Waning Crescent: The illuminated portion of the Moon continues to shrink, leaving a thin crescent shape of light on the left side. In conclusion, the different shapes of the Moon that appear in the sky are caused by the Moon revolving around the Earth. The Sun's light reflects differently on the lunar surface depending on the Moon's position during its orbit. This phenomenon results in the lunar phases, which we observe from Earth as the Moon's various shapes."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant. You will be given a task.

The other answers are not relevant to this situation: - The first answer talks about treating a nosebleed and using sterile bandage sleeves, which is not related to removing a liquid bandage. - The second answer mentions washing hands before, during, and between bandage removal procedures, but this question is about removing a liquid bandage, which is generally a one-time process. - The fourth answer talks about wiping hands under running water and rinsing with sterile water, which is not a proper way to wash hands for this situation. A proper handwashing technique is required to remove bacteria and prevent infection."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant. You will be given a task. You must generate a detailed and long answer.

And at the center of it all, President Donald Trump. “Can we do one question at a time? Wait! One question at a time,\\" the president scolded reporters. Trump launched a new attack on the Russia probe in the wake of a critical report on the Hillary Clinton email investigation by the inspector general of the Department of Justice. “I did nothing wrong. There was no collusion. There was no obstruction,\\" he said. \\"The IG (inspector general) report yesterday went a long way to show that, and I think that the Mueller investigation has been totally discredited.” But the report in question only dealt with how the FBI handled the Clinton email controversy. It was critical of the man Trump fired as FBI director, James Comey, but rejected the notion of a politically-directed effort aimed at Trump. “This report did not find any evidence of political bias or improper considerations actually impacting the investigation under review,\\" announced current FBI Director Christopher Wray. Democrats also took note of the report. “Anyone who is hoping to use this report to undermine the Mueller probe or prove the existence of a ‘deep state’ conspiracy against President Trump will be sorely disappointed,\\" Senate Democratic leader Chuck Schumer said.  During his lengthy encounter with reporters Friday, Trump also defended his recent summit meeting with North Korean leader Kim Jong Un. “They are doing so much for us, and now we are well on our way to get denuclearization,\\" he said. \\"And the agreement says there will be total denuclearization. Nobody wants to report that. I got along with him great. We have a great chemistry together.

Answer the following question: Information:  - Christianity is a monotheistic religion based on the life and teachings of Jesus Christ, who serves as the focal point for the religion. It is the world's largest religion, with over 2.4 billion followers, or 33% of the global population, known as Christians. Christians believe that Jesus is the Son of God and the savior of humanity whose coming as the Messiah (the Christ) was prophesied in the Old Testament.  - The International Pentecostal Holiness Church ( IPHC ) or simply Pentecostal Holiness Church ( PHC ) is a Pentecostal Christian denomination founded in 1911 with the merger of two older denominations . Historically centered in the Southeastern United States , particularly the Carolinas and Georgia , the Pentecostal Holiness Church now has an international presence . In 2000 , the church reported a worldwide membership of over one million -- over three million including affiliates . Heavily influenced by two major American revival movements -- the holiness movement of the late 19th century and the Pentecostal revival of the early 20th century -- the church 's theological roots derive from John Wesley 's teachings on sanctification . Several ministers who were raised in the Pentecostal Holiness Church have come to have greater name recognition than the church itself , such as Oral Roberts , an internationally known charismatic evangelist ; Charles Stanley , a former president of the Southern Baptist Convention ; and C.M. Ward , a former Assemblies of God radio preacher .  - Apostolic succession is the method whereby the ministry of the Christian Church is held to be derived from the apostles by a continuous succession, which has usually been associated with a claim that the succession is through a series of bishops. This series was seen originally as that of the bishops of a particular see founded by one or more of the apostles. According to historian Justo L. González, apostolic succession is generally understood today as meaning a series of bishops, regardless of see, each consecrated by other bishops, themselves consecrated similarly in a succession going back to the apostles. But, according to documentation produced by the Joint International Commission for Theological Dialogue Between the Catholic Church and the Orthodox Church, the sees (\\"cathedrae\\") play \\"an important role in inserting the bishop into the heart of ecclesial apostolicity\\".  - A Christian denomination is a distinct religious body within Christianity, identified by traits such as a name, organisation, leadership and doctrine. Individual bodies, however, may use alternative terms to describe themselves, such as church or sometimes fellowship. Divisions between one group and another are defined by authority and doctrine; issues such as the nature of Jesus, the authority of apostolic succession, eschatology, and papal primacy may separate one denomination from another. Groups of denominations  often sharing broadly similar beliefs, practices, and historical ties  are sometimes known as \\"branches of Christianity\\" or \\"denominational families\\".  - Jesus (; c. 4 BC  c. AD 30/33), also referred to as Jesus of Nazareth or Jesus Christ, was a Jewish preacher and religious leader who became the central figure of Christianity. Christians believe him to be the Son of God and the awaited Messiah (Christ) prophesied in the Old Testament. Virtually all modern scholars of antiquity agree that Jesus existed historically, although the quest for the historical Jesus has produced little agreement on the historical reliability of the Gospels and on how closely the biblical Jesus reflects the historical Jesus. Jesus was a Galilean Jew who was baptized by John the Baptist and subsequently began his own ministry, preaching his message orally and often being referred to as \\"rabbi\\". He was arrested and tried by the Jewish authorities, and was crucified by the order of Pontius Pilate, the Roman prefect. Jesus debated fellow Jews on how to best follow God, performed healings, taught in parables and gathered followers. After his death, his followers believed he rose from the dead, and the community they formed eventually became the Christian Church.

Though prehistoric remains from the Paleolithic, Neolithic, and Bronze Ages have been unearthed in the Manzanares Valley, prior to Madrid's sudden elevation to capital city in 1561 its history was rather undistinguished. Over a period of many centuries crucial in Spanish history, Madrid's significance was negligible. The Romans built their most advanced outpost on the Iberian peninsula, but left nothing of consequence in Madrid. Armies of North African nomads, intent on disseminating Islam, invaded the peninsula in a.d. Within 10 years, they had overrun most of Spain. If Madrid played any role in these pivotal events, no record of it remains. The first solid references to this obscure settlement on the Castilian plateau, guarded by the looming Guadarrama mountain range, appear in the 9th century. The Arabic name for \\"place of many springs,\\" variously recorded as Magerit, Mayrit or Magrit, eventually evolved into Madrid. The hamlet entered historical chronicles for its military significance; it was located near the main line of resistance to the Christian reconquest. Over centuries of struggle, the defending Moorish army built a full-scale fort, or Alcázar, on the heights of Madrid commanding the Manzanares valley. After several unsuccessful skirmishes, the Christian forces of Alfonso VI captured Madrid in 1083. The Alcázar became a fort of the crown of Castile. During a counter-offensive in 1109, the town was overrun by the Moors, but the Christianized fortress held. The Moors were expelled from the town, but they remained in control of southern Spain for almost four centuries. Meanwhile, Madrid enjoyed brief prominence in 1308 when king Ferdinand IV and his Cortes, an early version of parliament, held a formal meeting in the fledgling town. From then on, the kings of Spain began to visit Madrid, where the air was invigorating and the hunting excellent. Ferdinand and Isabella, the Catholic monarchs that united all the provinces of Spain, first visited Madrid in 1477.  Question: \\"Who overtook the Romans?\\" Answer: \\"Armies of African Nomads\\" Is this answer correct? Choices: - no. - yes....I think the answer is","output":"Yes, the answer is correct.

Select from:  +Yes;  +No; If I tell you that Mammals breathe by relaxing the lungs, and ask you the question \\"what breathes by relaxing the lungs?\\", is the correct answer \\"mammals\\"? Answer:","output":"Yes, the correct answer is \\"mammals.\\"  To provide a more detailed and long explanation, let us first understand the process of breathing in mammals. Respiration in mammals, including humans, is a vital process to deliver oxygen to cells and tissues while removing waste products such as carbon dioxide. The respiratory system in mammals involves multiple organs and structures, including the nose, mouth, pharynx, larynx, trachea, bronchi, bronchioles, and lungs. Breathing is a two-step process encompassing inspiration (inhaling) and expiration (exhaling). The diaphragm, a large, dome-shaped muscle beneath the lungs, plays a significant role in the breathing process, working in concert with the external and internal intercostal muscles that are present between the ribs. During inspiration, the diaphragm contracts and flattens, thereby increasing the thoracic cavity's volume and creating a pressure gradient that draws the air into the lungs. At the same time, the external intercostal muscles contract, raising the ribs and further expanding the thoracic cavity. As a result, the lungs expand, allowing oxygen to enter the alveolar sacs, where the gas exchange process takes place. Oxygen from the inhaled air diffuses into the tiny capillaries surrounding the alveoli while carbon dioxide diffuses from the capillaries into the alveoli, ready to be exhaled. Expiration, on the other hand, is a passive process driven primarily by the elastic recoil of the lungs and the relaxation of the diaphragm and external intercostal muscles. Once these muscles relax, the diaphragm resumes its original dome-shaped position, and the ribs lower, reducing the thoracic cavity's volume. This decrease in volume causes the pressure inside the lungs to rise slightly above the atmospheric pressure, and the carbon dioxide-laden air is expelled from the lungs. Thus, mammals breathe by expanding and relaxing their lungs, allowing this vital gas exchange to take place continuously and effectively. The statement \\"Mammals breathe by relaxing the lungs\\" refers to the expiration process in which the lungs return to their resting state after the diaphragm and external intercostal muscles relax. Consequently, the correct and more complete answer to the question \\"what breathes by relaxing the lungs?\\" would be \\"mammals,\\" particularly during the expiration phase of the breathing process."},{"instruction":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

Hypothesis: That guy sucked and was never there for me during the toughest years of college. Is the hypothesis entailed by the premise?","output":"The hypothesis is not entailed by the premise given. Entailment in logic and reasoning means that from a certain premise, we can deduce or conclude another statement because the latter follows necessarily or logically from the former. In other words, if the premise is true, then the entailed hypothesis must also be true. In order to assess whether the hypothesis is entailed by the premise, we need to examine both statements in detail. Premise: The other one is my closest friend in college, who has been there with me through the last four tough years. The premise establishes the following information: 1. The subject (the other one) is the speaker's closest friend in college. 2. This friend has been with the speaker throughout their college journey, particularly during the last four tough years. Based on this premise, we are led to believe that the speaker has a strong bond with the subject and that they have had each other's support during difficult times in college. Hypothesis: That guy sucked and was never there for me during the toughest years of college. The hypothesis states: 1. The subject (that guy) was not a good friend, implied by the statement \\"sucked.\\" 2. The subject was never present or supportive during the speaker's difficult years in college. The hypothesis contradicts the premise by asserting that the subject was never there for the speaker during their toughest years of college and was not a good friend in general. Since the hypothesis contradicts and does not logically follow from the premise, it is not entailed by it. The premise presents the subject as a supportive, close friend who has been there for the speaker through trying experiences. In contrast, the hypothesis suggests that the subject was not supportive, implying a lot of negative assumptions about their relationship.

On my seventh birthday, my parents bought me a second-hand ZX Spectrum and, in a foretaste of my life to come, I immediately set about learning how to use it to get attention. It's a sign of how rapidly technology develops that my crappy Spectrum, with its 48k of memory, already had 12k more storage power than the computer that had guided the Apollo 11 moon landing eighteen years earlier* With power like that, there seemed to be no limit to what I could do. While my other computer-owning peers would sit for hours while their tape drives squawked away loading 'Manic Miner' or 'Bubble Buster' I was more fascinated by learning to write my own programs. The first of these consisted of just two lines of code* that made the word 'shit' appear again and again on my screen, to the huge amusement of my friends and the irritation of my parents, who obviously had more educational motives for bringing a computer into the house. From that day on, the possibilities offered by technology to both subvert the norm and get attention had me hooked. Years later, at secondary school, I convinced my English teacher, Mr Coen, to teach me desktop publishing, ostensibly to work on the official school magazine, but in reality to produce an alternative underground version - complete with less than flattering articles about teachers and fellow pupils and distributed via the publicly accessible shared hard drive that was supposed to be used for collaborative coursework. That particular stunt got me banned from the school computer room for half a term. And then, in 1997, I discovered the Internet. Throughout history, every fame-hungry media dickhead has found his preferred medium for pursuing fame and wealth (in that order). For Tony Parsons - and Hitler, for that matter - it was books. William Randolph Hearst chose newspapers. Don Imus and Howard Stern preferred radio. For Nick Griffin it's inflammatory leaflets. For Tracy Emin it's art. Or at least an approximation of it.

He said at a press conference the world's cities consume 75 percent of the world's energy and produce 80 percent of the emissions which cause climate change. \\"The problem of our planet is an urban problem,\\" Johnson said.     He said the British capital wants to use the Olympics \\"to drive the greening and the improvement of our city\\" and noted that London is committed to reduce carbon dioxide emissions by 60 percent by 2025.     Johnson said the key measure was being taken to solve problems relating to housing and commercial buildings, which accounted for 70 percent of carbon dioxide emissions in London. This involved retrofitting  -- installing lagging -- in large numbers of public buildings.     Johnson proclaimed himself a \\"passionate cyclist\\" and said he would push ahead with cycle superhighways around London.     London's air quality problem, he said, was caused by vehicle emissions from 8,300 worn and used diesel  buses, which could be replaced by low-carbon vehicles. In addition, there were also 32,000 taxis running on diesel fuel, which could be replaced by electric vehicles.

The World unites to stop the invaders, and build The Jaeger Program: a series of giant mechanical 'monsters,' intended to stop the creatures.Original tests to have one pilot per Jaeger prove unsuccessful, as the test subjects were not able to handle the stress and strain of controlling such a huge robot by themselves.

Pretty soon, the world is enthralled by the Jaegers and their pilots. They become celebrities, and even have merchandise made.

The Emperor Diocletian (r. 284–305) split the empire into separately administered eastern and western halves in 286; the empire was not considered divided by its inhabitants or rulers, as legal and administrative promulgations in one division were considered valid in the other.[C] In 330, after a period of civil war, Constantine the Great (r. 306–337) refounded the city of Byzantium as the newly renamed eastern capital, Constantinople. Diocletian's reforms strengthened the governmental bureaucracy, reformed taxation, and strengthened the army, which bought the empire time but did not resolve the problems it was facing: excessive taxation, a declining birthrate, and pressures on its frontiers, among others. Civil war between rival emperors became common in the middle of the 4th century, diverting soldiers from the empire's frontier forces and allowing invaders to encroach. For much of the 4th century, Roman society stabilised in a new form that differed from the earlier classical period, with a widening gulf between the rich and poor, and a decline in the vitality of the smaller towns. Another change was the Christianisation, or conversion of the empire to Christianity, a gradual process that lasted from the 2nd to the 5th centuries.

Please briefly summarize this news article: Hers - A CHILD HAS HER FIRST BRUSH WITH 'CRIME' - NYTimes.com ICOMMITTED my first white-collar crime in second grade. Like many white-collar criminals, I persist in believing that I acted for an honorable cause and that the lessons crime taught me were not necessarily the ones society would have me learn. Things began innocently enough. A priest bearing a stack of magazines and some charts came to every classroom in the school. ''Mission magazines,'' he explained. In their pulp pages nurse-nuns battled fierce bacteria in steaming jungles and brave priests struggled to persuade cannibals to look for new sources of protein. This was edge-of-the-seat stuff in our far-north Michigan town, which was so small and isolated that coins never showed up until the year after the dates on their faces. The charts that came with the magazines were for fund raising. They had thermometers printed on them, like the United Way thermometers that sprout every year on courthouse lawns. At the top was a goal of 5, and the thermometer's ''degrees'' were marked in nickels. ''Pagan babies,'' the priest told us. Each 5 would buy one pagan baby. The money would feed the baby and, more important, would guarantee that the baby would be baptized and thereby rescued from spending eternity in limbo. Because our second grade was such a special class, the priest said, he brought two thermometers. He could tell we were sacrificing and persevering enough to save two pagan babies. He suggested we make a contest of it; the boys could race the girls to 5. The impropriety of buying babies never occurred to me, nor did I grasp the ethnocentric hauteur of a concept like ''pagan'' babies. I just wanted to help. I was unnerved by the magazine pictures of children swollen with hunger - I who never felt like cleaning my plate. The boys-against-girls contest appealed to my sense of urgency in the matter. And, I admit, to my basest competitive instincts. My first thought was that the girls slightly outnumbered the boys. If we worked fast we could win. But when the priest asked who would make the first contribution, I began to see what we were up against. Pockets, for one thing. Little boys have four pockets in their pants and two in their shirts, and one thing they carry in them is money. (None of the girls would have purses until spring, when we made our first communion and needed them for regulation religious equipment like rosaries.) Not one girl had money. Mrs. Davey, our teacher, colored the first red degrees on the boys' thermometer. Undaunted, I went home for lunch and told my mother about the pagan babies. She said I could take a nickel. I supposed that every girl was home doing the same and our thermometer would soar past the boys'. For lunch we'd had egg-salad sandwiches -one of the few things I liked - and it pleased me to think the pagan babies would soon be having egg salad, too. I ran back to school and forced my nickel upon Mrs. Davey. She announced that everyone who had brought money for pagan babies should go stand by the thermometers. To my amazement almost no one went. It was a big class, a postwar bumper crop of 60, but there were only five of us at the thermometers. Didn't the rest of them care? Didn't they know that the bloated stomachs and inside-out navels in those horrible photographs belonged to real children? Worst of all, only one other girl gave money. From the back of the room the thermometers burned into me all afternoon: 48 cents boys, 10 cents girls. During recess I did some lobbying. The pagan babies would die without our money for food, I pointed out, and because they hadn't been baptized they couldn't go to heaven. It would be our fault. But nobody believed it. Africa and Asia seemed unimaginably far away, starvation even farther. At home I told my mother what had happened and asked if I could take a dollar. She said another nickel. When I accused her of being just one more person who didn't care about pagan babies, she said the fund raising was a class project and the whole class should chip in. Contributions dribbled in for the next few days. Finally, after Mrs. Davey plugged the enterprise, the girls went into action. One day we even took the lead - 3.42 girls, 3.39 boys. Here was the glorious proof of what I'd known all along: girls could beat boys. Then Robert stepped forward with 50 cents. This was the greatest philanthropy we'd seen, and someone asked where he'd gotten the money. His paper route, he said. My pride blew away like a dead leaf in a cold wind.After school I told my mother I needed a paper route. She said paper boys were like altar boys -they were always boys. It wasn't fair, she agreed, but she doubted that we could change the world before the pagan baby campaign ended. If only my father were home. He wouldn't let me be beaten by Robert's paper route. But he worked on a ship on the Great Lakes and would be away for days. Besides, it seemed demeaning to ask for money now that I knew Robert earned his. Imagine having money to spend however you wanted, with no need to account to anyone! I racked my brain to think how I might acquire the same freedom, but because the pagan babies needed help fast, all my thoughts came back to a single possibility: crime. Stealing was a sin, of course, but how could it be wrong to steal for pagan babies? That night while my mother gave my little sister a bath I took 40 cents from her wallet. To avoid suspicion at school, I gave half in the morning, half in the afternoon. Mrs. Davey didn't ask any questions. The most interesting thing about crime was that it was so easy. Over the weekend everybody seemed to forget about pagan babies, and in the days that followed contributions tapered off to almost nothing. I kept bringing nickels, quietly, in the hope that Robert wouldn't notice that the girls were catching up. But he did. He loved playing the last tycoon, waiting until everyone else had given money, then fishing in his pockets and counting out just what was needed to put the boys ahead. I stole only once more for the pagan babies. I gave it up not out of guilt or fear but because I sensed that Robert would always come up with more than I could steal. And once I understood the impossibility of winning, I wanted to lose as invisibly as possible. I didn't want Robert to have the faintest idea the contest mattered to me. After the boys won, I tuned out. I don't know how long it took the girls to finish buying their pagan baby. I was preoccupied with dreams of the day when I would be big enough to rake leaves or babysit so I would never again know the humiliations suffered by women of dependent means.","output":"The article narrates the author's experience of participating in a fundraising contest as a child, titled \\"Pagan Babies,\\" in which their second-grade class raised money to save and baptize children in need. The priest visiting their school provided charts with thermometers indicating the progress towards the 5 goal for each child, and the class was split into boys and girls to compete against each other. The author, a girl, faced the challenge of not having money as readily available as the boys and engaged in what she considered \\"white-collar crime\\" by stealing money from her mother's wallet to contribute to the cause. Despite her efforts and those of her classmates, the boys' team won the contest. Reflecting on the experience, the author mentions dreaming of the day she would be independent and able to earn her own money to avoid the humiliation of being dependent on others."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant that follows instruction extremely well.

In 1603, that changed when the King of Scotland inherited the Crown of England, and consequently the Crown of Ireland also. The subsequent 17th century was one of political upheaval, religious division and war. English colonialism in Ireland of the 16th century was extended by large-scale Scottish and English colonies in Ulster. Religious division heightened and the King in England came into conflict with parliament. A prime issue was, inter alia, over his policy of tolerance towards Catholicism. The resulting English Civil War or War of the Three Kingdoms led to a revolutionary republic in England. Ireland, largely Catholic was mainly loyal to the king. Following defeat to the parliaments army, large scale land distributions from loyalist Irish nobility to English commoners in the service of the parliamentary army created the beginnings a new Ascendancy class which over the next hundred years would obliterate the English (Hiberno-Norman) and Gaelic Irish nobility in Ireland. The new ruling class was Protestant and British, whilst the common people were largely Catholic and Irish. This theme would influence Irish politics for centuries to come. When the monarchy was restored in England, the king found it politically impossible to restore all the lands of former land-owners in Ireland. The \\"Glorious Revolution\\" of 1688 repeated similar themes: a Catholic king pushing for religious tolerance in opposition to a Protestant parliament in England. The king's army was defeated at the Battle of the Boyne and at the militarily crucial Battle of Aughrim in Ireland. Resistance held out, and a guarantee of religious tolerance was a cornerstone of the Treaty of Limerick. However, in the evolving political climate, the terms of Limerick were superseded, a new monarchy was installed, and the new Irish parliament was packed with the new elite which legislated increasing intolerant Penal Laws, which discommoded both Dissenters and Catholics. If it is possible to answer this question, answer it for me (else, reply \\"unanswerable\\"): Why did the King of England have issues with parliment in the 17th century?","output":"Okay little buddy, let me explain it to you. In the 17th century, there was a King of England who had some disagreements with a group called the Parliament. The Parliament is like a big team of people who help to make decisions for the country. One of the main reasons the King and the Parliament had issues was because of different beliefs about religion. The King wanted to be more accepting of a religion called Catholicism, but the Parliament had many people who were Protestants and they didn't want to be too friendly with Catholics. Because they couldn't agree on this subject, it led to lots of arguments and eventually a big fight called the English Civil War.

Nolte bows out to join his brothers in The Last, and Navetta, Stevenson, and Lombardo record the Descendents' debut single. Stevenson's high school classmate Milo Aukerman joins the band as lead singer, and the new lineup builds a local following through their catchy and melodic songs, energetic live shows, and Aukerman's image as a nerd.

Options: - ocean - soccer game - fishing gear - fisherman's boat - fishing boat  Explain why a human would choose \\"soccer game\\" to answer the question above: The answer is:","output":"A human would choose \\"soccer game\\" to answer the question above because it is the most contextually appropriate option. In the context of the question, a net most likely refers to a goal net, which is a commonly used item in soccer games.  In a soccer game, the players, specifically goalkeepers, are often positioned next to the net as they try to defend their team's goal. Soccer is a popular sport, and people would easily associate the presence of someone standing near a net (goalpost) with a soccer game. While the other options - ocean, fishing gear, fisherman's boat, and fishing boat - may also involve nets, those nets are usually meant for catching fish or other types of marine life, not for people to stand next to. In these aquatic scenarios, people may work with or handle nets but are not necessarily standing next to them in the same way as in a soccer game. Therefore, considering the context and common associations, a human would choose \\"soccer game\\" as the answer because it presents the most likely scenario where a person can be found standing next to a net."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Options: - sweating - having fun - smiling - increased heart rate - anger  Explain why a human would choose \\"sweating\\" to answer the question above: The answer to this question is:","output":"Sweating An uncomfortable consequence of jumping rope is indeed sweating. Although it might not be the first thing that comes to mind when people think of discomfort while jumping rope, the discomfort caused by sweating cannot be overlooked. In the given options, \\"having fun,\\" \\"smiling,\\" and \\"anger\\" are feelings or emotions that don't necessarily cause physical discomfort during the activity of jumping rope. However, \\"increased heart rate\\" might be uncomfortable for some, but it is a normal physiological response to increased activity, and it is actually beneficial to boost cardiovascular health. Let's delve deeper into why a human would choose \\"sweating\\" as the answer to the question above: 1. Excessive sweating: When a person engages in physical activities like jumping rope, their body generates heat, and to maintain a normal temperature, the body starts to sweat. Excessive sweating can make a person feel uncomfortable, as the clothes they are wearing gradually become wet and heavy and stick to their skin. The increased dampness might lead to chafing and irritation, especially in sensitive areas. 2. Odor: Sweat itself is odorless, but the presence of moisture on warmer areas of the body, like the armpits, groin, and feet, creates a perfect environment for bacteria to thrive. Bacterial breakdown of sweat, oils, and dead skin cells may produce an unpleasant smell, making the person self-conscious and uncomfortable around others. 3. Skin irritation: As mentioned earlier, sweating can lead to chafing, irritation, and in some cases pruritus, commonly known as itchiness, due to dampness and the friction between skin and clothes or shoes. This can result in redness, inflammation, and discomfort, which might not be easily ignored by a person during physical activities. 4. Slippery hands: Sweating can also cause the palms of the hands to become damp or moist, which may result in a reduced grip on the rope. This can pose a challenge while trying to maintain a consistent jump rope rhythm and might affect a person's performance, leading to frustration and discomfort. 5. Increased perspiration: Some people naturally tend to perspire more than others, and jumping rope only increases the amount of sweating they experience. So, individuals who sweat profusely might prefer low-intensity activities and might consider the amount of sweating they experience while jumping rope to be uncomfortable. In conclusion, although jumping rope is a fun and excellent cardiovascular workout, it can also lead to some uncomfortable consequences like sweating. A human would choose \\"sweating\\" as the answer to the question because it causes physical discomfort like skin irritation, sweaty clothes, and possible odor, which can make the entire experience of jumping rope less enjoyable and more uncomfortable. Additionally, these consequences can contribute to the negative feelings of self-consciousness and may affect a person's confidence while exercising."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Write a multi-choice question for the following article, with the given choices and answer: Article: I love charity shops and so do lots of other people in Britain because you find quite a few of them on every high street. The charity shop is a British institution, selling everything from clothes to electric goods, all at very good prices. You can get things you won't find in the shops anymore. The thing I like best about them is that your money is going to a good cause and not into the pockets of profit-driven companies, and you are not damaging the planet, but finding a new home for unwanted goods. The first charity shop was opened in 1947 by Oxfam. The famous charity's appeal to aid postwar Greece had been so successful that it had been flooded with donations. They decided to set up a shop to sell some of these donations to raise money for that appeal. Now there are over 7,000 charity shops in the UK. My favorite charity shop in my hometown is the Red Cross shop, where I always find children's books, all 10 or 20 pence each. Most of the people working in the charity shops are volunteers, although there is often a manager who gets paid. Over 90% of the goods in the charity shops are donated by the public. Every morning you see bags of unwanted items outside the front of shops, although they don't encourage this, rather ask people to bring things in when the shop is open. The shops have very low running costs, and all profits go to charity work. Charity shops raise more than PS110 million a year, funding medical research, overseas aid, supporting sick and poor children, homeless and disabled people, and much more. What better places to spend your money? You get something special for a very good price and a good moral sense. You provide funds to a good cause and step lightly on the environment. Options: A its convenient location B its great variety of goods C its spirit of goodwill D its nice shopping environment Answer: C its spirit of goodwill Question: A:","output":"Which aspect of charity shops is most appealing to the author of the article?

Dome mountains are interesting to tourists because they are very massive, of volcanic origin and excellent for climbing.  and a hint : About 10% of sedimentary rocks are limestones. The solubility of limestone in water and weak acid solutions leads to karst landscapes, in which water erodes the limestone over thousands to millions of years. Most cave systems are through limestone bedrock.  Please answer this question : Which mountain has a higher percentage of sedimentary rocks? Answer:","output":"Based on the given information and hint, the White mountains have a higher percentage of sedimentary rocks compared to Dome mountains. This is because the White mountains are characterized by the presence of caves, stalactites, stalagmites, and karst phenomena, which are primarily formed in limestone regions. As stated in the hint, about 10% of sedimentary rocks are limestones, and the solubility of limestone in water and weak acid solutions leads to karst landscapes, where water erodes the limestone over thousands to millions of years. Since most cave systems are formed through limestone bedrock, it is evident that the White mountains would have a higher percentage of sedimentary rocks in their composition. On the other hand, Dome mountains are described as being very massive, of volcanic origin, and excellent for climbing. The volcanic origin of Dome mountains points towards a predominantly igneous rock composition rather than sedimentary rocks. While it is possible that some sedimentary rocks may be present in certain Dome mountains, the overall percentage of sedimentary rocks in these mountains would be significantly less compared to the White mountains. In conclusion, the White mountains have a higher percentage of sedimentary rocks in their composition due to factors such as the presence of cave systems, karst landscapes, and the fact that they are primarily formed in limestone regions. Dome mountains, with their volcanic origin, would have a lower percentage of sedimentary rocks in comparison."},{"instruction":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

Five test projectiles were successfully fired at Fort Sill, Oklahoma, with high spec camera kit tracking missiles moving at a velocity of 9600 km/h. A standard artillery shell flies through the air at 3200 km/h, which easily eclipses the speed of sound (1235 km/h) and makes the iconic Tomahawk missile (885 km/h) look like an antiquated tortoise. The rail gun is essentially an electric circuit, with its main components being a pair of parallel rails and a power supply. A current flows through one rail and back through the other, which generates a magnetic field.

Firstly, the reviewer mentions that the actress is \\"accomplished,\\" which suggests that she is skilled and has a history of successful performances. This not only highlights her professional achievements but also establishes her credibility in the context of the movie. In addition, the reviewer describes the role as \\"big\\" and \\"juicy,\\" which are positive adjectives that signify that the role is significant, rich, and offers ample opportunities to showcase the actress's talents. A big, juicy role usually indicates that the character has depth and complexity, which tends to be a desirable feature in movies, allowing the actor or actress to express their artistry better.

It is, however, important to acknowledge that a comprehensive review would likely consider other aspects of the movie, such as plot, cinematography, and direction, among others.

Think like you are answering to a five year old. Which entity is this text about? James Black was born in Hackensack, New Jersey on 1 May 1800. James' mother died when he was very young and he had difficulty getting along with his stepmother. Black ran away from home to Philadelphia, Pennsylvania at age 8 and was apprenticed to a silversmith. At age 18 he migrated westward and took jobs on the Ohio and Mississippi rivers. During his travels, Black had befriended Elijah Stuart. Stuart opened a tavern at Washington and Black was hired by a local blacksmith named William Shaw. Black, due to his previous training, worked on firearms and knives while Shaw concentrated on horse shoes, wagon wheels, and the like. Black would later become a partner in the business with Shaw. Stuart's tavern would become famous as the place where Davy Crockett, Jim Bowie, and William B. Travis created the plan for an independent Texas and Black would go on to create some of the world's finest knives. Black fell in love with his partner's daughter, Anne Shaw, and was forced out of the partnership when Shaw would not allow the marriage. Backed by the note he had received from the dissolved partnership Black purchased some land along the Cossatot River and established a blacksmith's shop, dam, and mill.  Black's endeavor came to an end when he was thrown off of his land. Local officials claimed that the land was Indian treaty land and that Black could not legally inhabit it. Black then discovered that the note he had received from William Shaw for his share of the partnership was actually worthless. Black set up his own blacksmithy in competition with Shaw's and married Shaw's daughter in 1828 despite Shaw's objections and also convinced Shaw's son to join him in his business. Black was soon recognized as the best blacksmith in the area which had a bad effect on his father-in-law's competing shop.  Black and his wife had three sons and a daughter during this period: William Jefferson in 1829, Grandison Deroyston in 1830, Sarah Jane in 1832, John Colbert in 1834, and Sydinham James in 1835.

According to Minnesota House of Representatives analyst Jim Cleary, \\"there appear to be at least two clearly distinguishable definitions of the term 'racial profiling': a narrow definition and a broad definition... Under the narrow definition, racial profiling occurs when a police officer stops, questions, arrests, and/or searches someone solely on the basis of the person's race or ethnicity... Under the broader definition, racial profiling occurs whenever police routinely use race as a factor that, along with an accumulation of other factors, causes an officer to react with suspicion and take action.\\"  - The Holocaust (from the Greek ': \\"hólos\\", \\"whole\\" and \\"kaustós\\", \\"burnt\\"), also referred to as the Shoah\\"' (Hebrew: , \\"HaShoah\\", \\"the catastrophe\\"), was a genocide in which Adolf Hitler's Nazi Germany and its collaborators killed about six million Jews.

How does photosynthesis compare to cellular respiration? Do those questions have the same meaning? Choose your answer from: -no. -yes.","output":"Yes, the questions have the same meaning. Photosynthesis and cellular respiration are vital processes for most organisms on Earth. Despite being seemingly opposite in nature, these two processes share a few similarities and many differences. Let's explore the similarities and differences between photosynthesis and cellular respiration in detail. Similarities: 1. Both involve the exchange of gases: In both processes, gases are involved as reactants and products. Photosynthesis consumes carbon dioxide and releases oxygen. In contrast, cellular respiration consumes oxygen and releases carbon dioxide. 2. Biochemical pathways: Both processes involve complex biochemical pathways. Photosynthesis mainly consists of light-dependent reactions (where energy from sunlight is captured) and the Calvin cycle (the synthesis of organic molecules). Cellular respiration includes glycolysis, the citric acid cycle (Krebs cycle), and the electron transport chain, all of which break down organic molecules to release energy. 3. Role of ATP: Both processes involve the production or consumption of Adenosine Triphosphate (ATP), the energy currency of cells. Photosynthesis generates ATP to store energy in glucose molecules. In cellular respiration, breaking down glucose releases stored energy in the form of ATP. 4. Presence of electron transport chain: Both photosynthesis and cellular respiration involve an electron transport chain, a series of protein complexes within a membrane. This chain facilitates the transfer of electrons, enabling the conversion of sunlight or energy stored in glucose into ATP. Differences: 1. Location in the cell: Photosynthesis occurs in chloroplasts, organelles found in plant cells containing chlorophyll pigments. Cellular respiration takes place in the mitochondria of almost all eukaryotic organisms (plants, animals, fungi, and protists). 2. Energy source: Photosynthesis is an anabolic process that uses sunlight as the primary energy source to combine carbon dioxide and water to produce glucose and oxygen. Cellular respiration is a catabolic process that breaks down glucose using oxygen, releasing energy in the form of ATP, water, and carbon dioxide. 3. Energy conversion: Photosynthesis is an endergonic process that stores energy in glucose molecules, while cellular respiration is an exergonic process that releases energy from glucose molecules. 4. Necessity of sunlight: Photosynthesis requires sunlight as the primary energy source. In contrast, cellular respiration can occur in the presence or absence of light, as long as glucose and oxygen are available. 5. Types of organisms: Photosynthesis occurs only in photoautotrophic organisms like plants, algae, and some bacteria, which can synthesize their own food. Cellular respiration occurs in nearly all living organisms, including autotrophs that produce their own food and heterotrophs that consume other organisms for energy. In summary, photosynthesis and cellular respiration are two essential physiological processes with many similarities and differences. Both involve exchanging gases, biochemical pathways, and the use of ATP. They also both utilize electron transport chains in their processes. However, they differ in their location, energy source, energy conversion processes, dependence on sunlight, and the types of organisms in which they occur."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant that follows instruction extremely well.

Movie plot title: Antichrist Movie plot: Prologue[edit] A couple makes passionate love, as their toddler, Nic, climbs up to the bedroom window and falls to his death. Chapter One: Grief[edit] The mother collapses at the funeral, and spends the next month in the hospital crippled with atypical grief. The father, a therapist, is skeptical of the psychiatric care she is receiving and takes it upon himself to treat her personally with psychotherapy. But it is not successful, and so when she reveals that her second greatest fear is nature, he decides to try exposure therapy. They hike to their isolated cabin in a woods called Eden, where she spent time with Nic the previous summer while writing a thesis on gynocide. He encounters a doe which shows no fear of him, and has a stillborn fawn hanging halfway out of her. Chapter Two: Pain (Chaos Reigns)[edit] During sessions of psychotherapy, she becomes increasingly grief stricken and manic, often demanding forceful sex to escape the pain. The area becomes increasingly sinister to the man, including acorns rapidly pelting the metal roof, awakening with a hand covered in swollen ticks, and finding a self-disemboweling fox that tells him, \\"chaos reigns.\\" Chapter Three: Despair (Gynocide)[edit] In the dark attic the man finds the womanâs thesis studies: terrifying pictures of witch-hunts, and a scrapbook in which her writing becomes increasingly frantic and illegible. She reveals that while writing her thesis, she came to believe that all women are inherently evil. The man is repulsed by this and reproaches her for buying into the gynocidal beliefs she had originally set out to criticize. In a frenzied moment, they have violent intercourse at the base of an ominous dead tree, where bodies are intertwined within the exposed roots. He suspects that Satan is her greatest, and hidden fear. Through the autopsy and old photos, he becomes aware that she had been systematically putting Nicâs shoes on the wrong feet, resulting in pain and deformity.

If potential buyers have similar needs and preferences, this review might warn them of potential issues they could face, making them reconsider their purchase. While the reviewer acknowledged that most reviews for the product were good, it is essential for potential buyers to consider a variety of reviews, including both the positive and negative ones, to get a well-rounded perspective of the product. Consistent negative reviews should be carefully evaluated before making any purchase decisions.

George's sheriff's officials accused in theft from union A grand jury charged two Prince George's County sheriff's officials Thursday with conspiring to steal more than 20,000 from the deputies' union when they were officers for the organization. The criminal indictment was brought by State Prosecutor Robert A. Rohrbaugh. According to the indictment, Wendy Tyler, who until Thursday was an acting sheriff's captain, served as president of the union that represents deputies from September 2005 to October 2007. Capt. Nancy Ridgely was first vice president of the union for the same term, the indictment says. During those two years, Tyler was entitled to receive quarterly checks totaling 10,400 from the Prince George's County Deputy Sheriff's Association, Fraternal Order of Police Lodge #112, the indictment says. Tyler instead received 13 union checks for 22,124, the indictment says. The union requires the signature of two officers to draw checks on the union's bank account, according to the indictment. Ridgely signed 12 of the 13 checks paid to Tyler, the indictment says. Ridgely, who supervises the sheriff's department's public information office, did not return a phone call. Tyler, who had been working as an acting captain in the department's domestic violence unit, also did not return a phone call. William C. Brennan, Ridgely's attorney, said, \\"My client adamantly denies these allegations and will vigorously contest these charges.\\" Sheriff Michael Jackson, a candidate in the Democratic primary for county executive, did not return phone calls. Col. Paul A. Drula, Jackson's second-in-command, said, \\"As we've said before, it's a union issue involving union funds, not government funds. It's between union members.\\" Tyler and Ridgely will be placed on administrative leave with pay pending the outcome of the charges, Drula said. During her leave, Tyler will revert to the rank of lieutenant, Drula said. The indictment also accuses Tyler of making purchases of more than 10,000 for nonunion purposes with her union-issued credit card. The bills for those personal purchases were paid for with union funds, the indictment says.","output":"Two sheriff's officials in Prince George's County were accused of stealing over 20,000 from the deputies' union.

Please write a short summary for the following article: Bill de Blasio leads Democratic primary vote tally for NYC mayor, but Bill Thompson still threatens runoff; Joe Lhota wins GOP primary Bill de Blasio, the city’s 6-foot-5-inch public advocate, claimed a towering victory Tuesday in the Democratic race for mayor — but former Controller Bill Thompson refused to give up until “every vote” is counted. With 98% of the precincts reporting, it could not clear early Wednesday whether de Blasio had won the Democratic nomination — or whether Thompson had corraled just enough support to force a runoff in three weeks. And it could be a week or even more before the final vote count is decided. The latest tally showed de Blasio had 40.2% of the vote, just a whisker more than the 40% needed to win the nomination without a runoff. Thompson had 26%. But with tens of thousands of votes outstanding — including 19,000 paper ballots — it appeared that it would take the city’s embattled Board of Elections days, if not a week, to sort it all out. Introduced by his 16-year-old son, Dante, and 19-year-old daughter, Chiara, who had been showcased throughout his campaign, de Blasio took the stage at his raucous victory party at the Bell House in Gowanus, Brooklyn, as if the Democratic nomination had been settled. RELATED: LIVE BLOG! NEW YORK PRIMARY ELECTION DAY “We are better as a city when we make sure that everyone has a shot,” he said, reprising his campiagn mantra of bringing the income gap in New York. “We begin tonight.” But Thompson was far from ready to concede. “Every voice in New York City deserves to be heard,” the former city controller declared. “We’re going to wait for every vote to be counted,” he said. “This is far from over!” And with that, his supporters at the Eventi Hotel in Chelsea broke into chants of “Three more weeks! Three more weeks!” PHOTOS: NEW YORK CITY PRIMARY DAY 2013: CANDIDATES CAST THEIR BALLOTS A runoff, if necessary, would be held Oct. 1. “I’m confident,” said Rep. Gregory Meeks (D-Queens), a Thompson backer. City Council Speaker Christine Quinn had 15.5%, Controller John Liu had 7% and scandal-scarred former U.S. Rep. Anthony Weiner had 4.9% — all finishing far out of the money. Whoever becomes the Democratic nominee will face Republican Joe Lhota in November for the right to lead the city after 12 years of Mayor Bloomberg’s reign. Lhota, a former MTA chairman and deputy mayor under Rudy Giuliani, outdistanced billionaire John Catsimatidis Tuesday for the Republican nomination. RELATED: ELECTIONS BOARD COULD TAKE WEEK BEFORE DETERMINING NEED FOR RUNOFF In the Democratic primary for city controller, Manhattan Borough President Scott Stringer defeated Eliot Spitzer, who was attempting a political comeback after resigning as governor in 2008 amid a prostitution scandal. There also were primaries Tuesday to determine the nominees for other citywide offices, borough presidencies and dozens of City Council races. But the battle to carry the Democratic banner in the November election took center stage Tuesday, as it has all year. The tallest man on the campaign trail, de Blasio exuded confidence as city residents headed to the polls. Grinning from ear to ear, the 52-year-old de Blasio soaked up the love from a cheering crowd as he and his wife, Chirlane McCray, cast their ballots at the Park Slope public library. RELATED: DE BLASIO SEEKS DECISIVE WIN IN DEMOCRATIC PRIMARY He even felt comfortable enough to park his not-so-secret weapon, Dante, at school, instead of trotting him out on one last bid for votes. The de Blasio campaign caught fire after the candidate made Dante and his fabulous Afro a focal point of his underdog campaign. De Blasio kept up his anti-Bloomberg rhetoric to the end, saying he represents a clear change in direction for the city from a mayor who is “out of touch with the people’s wishes.” “I present the most progressive view for this city, and I think the choice is clear in the Democratic primary,” de Blasio told cheering supporters. “He is going to win,” said voter Paulette White, 47. “Everyone in Park Slope is voting for you, Bill.” RELATED: DANTE DE BLASIO'S CLASSMATES IGNORE HIS LOCAL CELEB STATUS By the time the polls closed at 9 p.m., the Edison Research exit poll showed de Blasio in the lead. While de Blasio was coasting, Thompson scrambled to avoid another bitter disappointment, after coming surprisingly close to unseating Bloomberg in the last mayoral race four years ago. The only African-American candidate, Thompson completed a marathon 24-hour campaign blitz, battling to keep black voters from defecting to de Blasio, who is white. After stumping through the night, and voting in the morning, he took a nap, and hit the trail again. “I got a few hours of sleep, I feel good,” the 60-year-old Thompson said as he pressed the flesh in Flatbush, Brooklyn. “I’m hearing some very good things about turnout.” RELATED: BRONX CAMPAIGNERS DIDN'T GO 'ROUND HUNGRY Once a long shot to win the Democratic primary, de Blasio languished in fourth place for much of the year, with barely 10% of the vote. But he began to make his move in late July when Weiner’s candidacy imploded amid another sexting scandal and voters began hunting for an alternative. Then de Blasio cut the TV ads featuring his interracial family that turned his telegenic son into an unlikely star. De Blasio got enthusiastic receptions wherever he roamed Tuesday in a final push to get out the vote. Despite all the hoopla surrounding a 10-month campaign that featured 150 forums and more than 15 million in television advertising, turnout appeared to be spotty across the city — somewhere around 21% in the Democratic primary for mayor. The results represented a disappointing end for Liu, whose candidacy was upended by a fund-raising scandal. And the results likely ended the once-promising political career of Weiner. With Greg B.

After primary loss, Tea Party stirs Georgia GOP runoff May 20, 2014: Georgia Republican Senate candidate Jack Kingston and his wife Libby arrive for an election-night watch party in Atlanta.AP When Rep. Jack Kingston and former Dollar General CEO David Perdue advanced to a Republican runoff in Georgia's Senate race, the Tea Party was left without a favored candidate. Yet the state's sizeable Tea Party crowd isn't staying on the sidelines. Tea Partyers now appear to be rallying behind Kingston, an 11-term congressman from Savannah who has the backing of the U.S. Chamber of Commerce and a history of supporting federal projects in his district. It's the pragmatic side of the Tea Party and says as much about the movement as it does about Kingston, whose voting record has been very conservative in recent years. \\"We're more concerned with people's attitudes since the rise of the Tea Party,\\" said Sal Russo, chief strategist of the Tea Party Express, one of the largest Tea Party groups in the country. His group has yet to endorse in the July 22 Georgia runoff. The Georgia race is one of at least two instances in which the national business group and the Tea Party are finding common ground. The chamber and Russo's group also have backed Republican Rep. Steve Daines in his bid for a Senate seat in Montana, a key pickup opportunity for the GOP. Nationally, Republicans are pushing for a net gain of six seats to claim a majority in the Senate and can't afford to lose the Georgia seat. Democrats have rallied behind Michelle Nunn, daughter of former Sen. Sam Nunn, and see her as one of their best chances to thwart GOP ambitions. The Tea Party hasn't fared that well in early primaries this year, although those were largely uphill races against well-funded Republican incumbents. And victories earlier this month by Tea Party-backed candidates in Nebraska and West Virginia Republican primaries are helping to reinvigorate the movement, which some had written off amid a difficult campaign season. In Nebraska, the primary victory by Republican Senate candidate Ben Sasse should help his party in November retain the open seat -- he is immediately considered the favorite for the seat held by retiring GOP Sen. Mike Johanns. In West Virginia, former Maryland GOP chairman Alex Mooney won the Republican primary with spending help from such outside groups as the Madison Fund, the Senate Conservatives Fund and Tea Party Express. The Georgia race was a free-for-all and pitted three congressmen against Perdue and former Georgia Secretary of State Karen Handel. Handel and Rep. Paul Broun of Athens drew the most Tea Party support, with Handel carrying the endorsement of Tea Party favorite Sarah Palin and the Tea Party Express. Handel finished a close third, while Broun trailed in fifth. In recent years, Kingston has moved steadily to the right with votes against raising the debt ceiling and a bipartisan budget bill. While campaigning, he points to a record of cutting spending as a member of the House Appropriations Committee. Perdue's outsider message, of running against Washington and career politicians, would seem an easier sell with Tea Party activists seeking candidates willing to take on the establishment. But some of the first-time candidate's comments during the campaign may have set off alarms, and he faced sustained criticism as the front-runner in the final weeks before the primary. He won with 31 percent of the vote to Kingston's 26 percent. In one instance, Perdue argued he didn't mean raising taxes when he said both spending cuts and increased revenue would be needed to deal with the nation's debt. Perdue said he was talking about efforts to grow the economy, but his original comment prompted the conservative group FreedomWorks for America to declare: \\"Elect a Conservative, Not Perdue.\\" Handel on Wednesday backed Kingston and urged her nearly 133,000 supporters in the primary to do the same. One of Handel's chief supporters, Julianne Thompson with the Atlanta Tea Party, also endorsed Kingston. Perdue's campaign said the fact a few high-profile Tea Party activists are supporting Kingston doesn't mean rank-and-file members will fall in line. The Associated Press contributed to this report.

Offering a slight twist, however, the offer is this time made to a retiring Sheriff Buford T. Justice (Jackie Gleason), betting 250,000 against his badge on his ability to transport a large stuffed fish from an eatery in Florida to Texas.Unlike the two earlier films, Big and Little Enos this time seem to be quite active in their desire to see Buford fail in his goal. After Buford dodges their many traps (especially after he destroyed their milk truck, which drenched them and disabled their engine), they then go so far as to actually attempt to hire the Bandit (as a distraction) to stop him. Deciding that the Bandit is too egotistical and hard to manage, they hire Cledus \\"Snowman\\" Snow (Jerry Reed) as his replacement. Accepting the offer, Cledus parks his Peterbilt 359 and climbs behind the wheel of a black and gold 1983 Pontiac Trans Am.He later picks up Dusty (Colleen Camp), who quits her job as a \\"bookkeeper\\" for a used car dealership, but not before attempting to wreck her boss' business (a seedy used car dealership) by badmouthing him in the middle of broadcasting a live TV commercial.The scene of Cledus picking up Dusty in the middle of the road is almost an exact repeat of how Bo picked up Frog in the 1977 film. Cledus manages to catch up with Buford on an interstate, where he then lassoes Buford's fish off of the Justices' police cruiser; Buford needs the fish to retrieve his 250,000. Buford then begins a hot pursuit of Cledus, with another local officer who attempts to take charge of the situation. Not long after the local officer is disabled, Buford becomes disabled as well when sand is dumped on his squad car.The pursuit quickly resumes as Buford catches up to the duo after Cledus and Dusty stop at a redneck bar to pick up... The answer is:","output":"In the movie 'Smokey and the Bandit Part 3', various key plot elements set the stage for an intriguing and high-stakes comedy chase. Given this detailed account of the movie plot, a potential question for discussion could be: \\"How does the dynamic between Big and Little Enos and Sheriff Buford T. Justice evolve throughout 'Smokey and the Bandit Part 3'? Despite Big and Little Enos' active involvement in trying to thwart Justice's quest, how do unexpected alliances and characters such as Cledus 'Snowman' Snow and Dusty add complexity to the plot? Discuss how their introductions play into the unfolding action and humor of the storyline. Also, consider the significance of Sheriff Justice's badge bet and the large stuffed fish in the broader context of the overall film plot.\\" Alternatively, another question could be: \\"Analyze the role and impact of Cledus 'Snowman' Snow as a replacement for the Bandit in changing the dynamics of 'Smokey and the Bandit Part 3'. How does his character and interaction with Dusty and Justice ignite the central conflict? Comment on the meaning and effect of the repeated scene of Snowman picking up Dusty, paralleling how Bo picked up Frog in the 1977 film.\\" One more question could be: \\"How are satirical elements used in 'Smokey and the Bandit Part 3' to amplify the humor and tension in the film? Consider the scene where Dusty badmouths her boss on live TV or the numerous times Justice dodges the traps set by Big and Little Enos. Additionally, talk about the implications, comic elements, and motivations behind the transport of the large stuffed fish.\\" The different facets of the plot, including the wager placed on Sheriff Buford T. Justice's ability, the introduction of new characters, and the various humorous instances present an excellent opportunity for in-depth discussion and analysis of the film."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

The founding members were New Zealander Neil Finn (vocalist, guitarist, primary songwriter) and Australians Paul Hester (drums) and Nick Seymour (bass). Later band members included Neil Finn's brother, Tim Finn, and Americans Mark Hart and Matt Sherrod. Originally active from 1985 to 1996, the band had consistent commercial and critical success in Australia and New Zealand and international chart success in two phases, beginning with their self-titled debut album, which reached number twelve on the US Album Chart in 1987 and provided the Top Ten hits Context: Crowded House were midway through a US tour when Paul Hester quit the band on 15 April 1994. He flew home to Melbourne to await the birth of his first child and indicated that he required more time with his family. Wally Ingram, drummer for support act Sheryl Crow, temporarily filled in until a replacement, Peter Jones (ex-Harem Scarem, Vince Jones, Kate Ceberano's Septet) was found. After the tour, the Finn Brothers released their album Finn in November 1995. In June 1996, at a press conference to announce the release of their greatest hits album Recurring Dream, Neil revealed that Crowded House were to disband. The June 1996 concerts in Europe and Canada were to be their final performances.  Recurring Dream contained four songs from each of the band's studio albums, along with three new songs. The album debuted at number one in Australia, New Zealand and the UK in July 1996. Early copies included a bonus CD of live material. The album's three new songs, which were released as singles, were \\"Instinct\\", \\"Not the Girl You Think You Are\\" and \\"Everything Is Good for You\\", which featured backing vocals from Pearl Jam's Eddie Vedder. Paul Hester returned to the band to play drums on the three new tracks.  Worried that their goodbye had been too low-key and had disregarded their home fans, the band performed the Farewell to the World concert on the steps of the Sydney Opera House on 24 November 1996, which raised funds for the Sydney Children's Hospital. The concert featured the line-up of Neil Finn, Nick Seymour, Mark Hart and Paul Hester. Tim Finn and Peter Jones both made guest appearances. Support bands on the day were Custard, Powderfinger and You Am I. The concert had one of the highest live audiences in Australian history with the crowd being estimated at between 120,000 and 250,000 people. Farewell to the World was released on VHS in December 1996. In 2007, a double CD and a DVD were issued as to commemorate the concert's tenth anniversary. The DVD featured newly recorded audio commentary by Finn, Hart and Seymour and other new bonus material. Question: Why did Paul decide to quit?. Whats the answer?","output":"Paul Hester, the drummer of Crowded House, decided to quit the band in 1994 because he wanted to be home in Melbourne for the birth of his first child and spend more time with his family."},{"instruction":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

You must generate a detailed and long answer. Please answer the following question: You are given a new situation: Rob is an environmental scientist. He is studying the effect of insect species on environment. For his study he chose four locations, location A, location B, location C and the entire globe, which he denoted as location D. He noticed location A's loss of biodiversity is temporary , but location B's loss is permanent. Location C's loss of biodiversity yet to be determined.  and a hint : Biodiversity loss is the extinction of species (plant or animal) worldwide, and also the local reduction or loss of species in a certain habitat.  The latter phenomenon can be temporary or permanent, depending on whether the environmental degradation that leads to the loss is reversible through ecological restoration / ecological resilience or effectively permanent (e.g. through land loss). Global extinction has so far been proven to be irreversible.  Even though permanent global species loss is a more dramatic phenomenon than regional changes in species composition, even minor changes from a healthy stable state can have dramatic influence on the food web and the food chain insofar as reductions in only one species can adversely affect the entire chain (coextinction), leading to an overall reduction in biodiversity, possible alternative stable states of an ecosystem notwithstanding. Ecological effects of biodiversity are usually counteracted by its loss. Reduced biodiversity in particular leads to reduced ecosystem services and eventually poses an immediate danger for food security, also for humankind.[1]  Please answer this question : Which location's biodiversity loss likely to be permanent, location C or location D? Answer:","output":"Based on the information provided and the definitions of biodiversity loss, it is more likely that location D's biodiversity loss will be permanent. There are several reasons for this conclusion. First, let's discuss the nature of biodiversity loss at each of the locations: 1. Location A: The loss of biodiversity is temporary, indicating that the environmental degradation at this location is reversible through ecological restoration or ecological resilience. This means that the species that have disappeared from this habitat can eventually return or re-establish themselves in the area. 2. Location B: The loss of biodiversity is permanent, meaning that the environmental degradation that has occurred at this location cannot be reversed. The species that have disappeared from this habitat are unlikely to return or re-establish themselves in the area. 3. Location C: The loss of biodiversity has yet to be determined, which means that we do not currently have enough information to assess whether the environmental degradation is reversible or not at this location. 4. Location D (entire globe): Global extinction has so far been proven to be irreversible, and the global loss of species is a more dramatic phenomenon than regional changes in species composition. Now, when comparing location C and location D, we must consider that the global loss of biodiversity is an irreversible process. While we do not have enough information about location C to know whether its environmental degradation is reversible, we do know that global extinction, as in location D, is irreversible. Additionally, the global loss of biodiversity poses an immediate danger to food security and ecosystem services not just for a specific region, but for all of humanity. This makes location D's biodiversity loss more significant, with far-reaching consequences. Taking all these factors into account, it is more likely that location D's biodiversity loss will be permanent in comparison to location C. However, it is crucial that additional research and examination be conducted within location C, to better understand the specifics of its biodiversity loss and work toward possible restoration or mitigation measures if necessary."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant that follows instruction extremely well.

But what about local bike shops ? Is City Bike booming at their expense? At Gotham Bikes in Tribeca, a manager who gave his name as \\"Ben W.\\" said the shop has seen an increase in its overall sales due to the bike-share program. \\"It's getting more people on the road, more people learning about the sport and getting involved,\\" he said. An employee at Danny's Cycles in Gramercy said Citi Bike is a good option for people in a city famed for its traffic jams and aggressive drivers. \\"They can try out a bike without buying one:' James Ryan said. Rentals are not a big part of the business at either Gotham Bikes or Danny's Cycles. But for Frank's Bike Shop, a small business on Grand St., the bike-share program has been bad news. Owner Frank Arroyo said that his rental business has decreased by 90% since Citi Bike was launched last month. Arroyo's main rental customers are European tourists, who have since been drawn away by Citi Bikes. However, Ben said the bike-share is good for bike sales at his shop. \\"People have used the bike-share and realized how great it is to bike in the city, then decide that they want something nicer for themselves,\\" he noted. Christian Farrell of Waterfront Bicycle Shop, on West St. said at first he was concerned about bike-share, though, he admitted, \\"I was happy to see people on bikes.\\" Farrell's early concerns were repeated by Andrew Crooks, owner of NYC Velo, at 64 Second Ave. \\"It seemed like a great idea, but one that would be difficult to put into use:' Crooks said of Citi Bike.

Commands are lowercase and encapsulate the logic of the sequence of actions. Actions are individual steps that serve as the building blocks for a command. There are only six actions: 'I_LOOK', 'I_WALK', 'I_RUN', 'I_JUMP', 'I_TURN_LEFT', and 'I_TURN_RIGHT'. These actions respectively align with the commands 'look', 'walk', 'run', 'jump', 'turn left', and 'turn right'. For commands, 'left' and 'right' are used to denote the direction of an action. opposite turns the agent backward in the specified direction. The word 'around' makes the agent execute an action while turning around in the specified direction. The word 'and' means to execute the next scope of the command following the previous scope of the command. The word 'after' signifies to execute the previous scope of the command following the next scope of the command. The words 'twice' and 'thrice' trigger repetition of a command that they scope over two times or three times, respectively. Actions and commands do not have quotations in the input and output.

The given sequence of actions, when executed, results in the command 'walk around right', which makes the agent walk while turning around right. Part #5: Executing commands using 'and' Usage: I_TURN_LEFT I_LOOK I_TURN_LEFT I_LOOK -> 'turn left and look' This example demonstrates the usage of the word 'and'. The given sequence of actions, when executed, results in the command 'turn left and look', which makes the agent execute the turn-left action and then the look action. Part #6: Executing commands using 'after' Usage: I_TURN_LEFT I_LOOK I_TURN_RIGHT I_LOOK -> 'turn right and look after turn left' This example demonstrates the usage of the word 'after'. The given sequence of actions, when executed, results in the command 'turn right and look after turn left', which tells the agent to execute the turn-right action and look action only after executing the turn-left action. Part #7: Triggering command repetition using 'twice' and 'thrice' Usage: I_JUMP I_JUMP -> 'jump twice' This example demonstrates the usage of the word 'twice'. The given sequence of actions, when executed, results in the command 'jump twice', which tells the agent to execute the jump action two times in a row."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

They swim circles around him as he pours magic potions into the water.

When a large bottom trawler comes towards her, the goldfish swims away from the jellyfish in an attempt to escape but is quickly pulled into the mess of garbage and debris that the trawler picks up in its net. She becomes trapped within a glass jar but manages to escape the net and make it towards shallow water. Meanwhile, a young boy named Sosuke (English: Frankie Jonas Japanese: Hiroki Doi) runs down the hillside path from his home to the water's edge to play with his toy boat.

Build a movie plot around this: who is the owner of the home Gloria The answer to this question is:","output":"Title: \\"Gloria's Revelation\\" Genre: Mystery, Drama, Suspense Plot Summary: In a quaint yet charming suburban neighborhood, lies a sprawling Victorian mansion shrouded in secrecy and surrounded by beautifully manicured gardens. The locals have given the mansion a nickname, \\"Gloria's Home.\\" Strange occurrences have been happening for several decades, but nobody seems to have met the owner, Gloria. As the mysterious events unfold, intertwined lives of the neighborhood unravel, secrets are unveiled, and the shocking truth about Gloria's home and the elusive owner is ultimately revealed. Act 1: The story starts by introducing the main character, Sarah, a young freelance journalist, who has recently moved to the town to escape her troubled past while recovering from a failed relationship. Sarah quickly becomes intrigued by the neighborhood gossip surrounding Gloria's Home. After witnessing peculiar events around the mansion, she decides to pitch an investigative story to her editor about the mysterious house and its owner. Sarah begins to collect testimonies about the strange occurrences within the neighborhood, including unusual noises, misplaced items, suspicious shadows, and the unexplained disappearance of pets. She also learns about the decades-long whispers that involve similarly odd events occurring in the mansion. As her investigation deepens, she uncovers a myth suggesting Gloria's Home as the potential epicenter of the town's bizarre encounters. Act 2: Eager to get to the bottom of this mystery, Sarah conducts archival research in the local library. She discovers that Gloria was a wealthy heiress who moved into the mansion in the 1920s. As her research continues, she stumbles upon the town's dark secret: years ago, a tragic accident occurred at a factory owned by Gloria's family, leading to the loss of many lives. Gloria disappeared from the public eye shortly after and was rumored to be grieving in private over the accident. With this newfound knowledge, Sarah decides to seek entry to Gloria's Home. One night, she sneaks into the mansion under the cover of darkness. Inside the dimly lit house, Sarah finds herself in a labyrinth of rooms, showcasing an exquisite blend of antiques and modern artistry. She begins to feel an eerie presence, which grows stronger as she explores deeper. Act 3: While navigating her way through the mansion, Sarah stumbles upon a hidden room. The room contains pictures and personal items belonging to the victims of the factory accident. As she further investigates, Sarah discovers evidence that suggests Gloria had been providing financial support to the victims' families for decades without their knowledge. In a shocking twist, Sarah learns that Gloria has passed away, leaving the mansion in control of her granddaughter, Amelia. Amelia, who has been living in the town under an alias and is now the mysterious \\"owner\\" of Gloria's Home, has continued her grandmother's secret philanthropy. Uncovering the true identity of Amelia and the real story behind Gloria's Home, Sarah is torn between revealing the truth and respecting the family's decades-long secret. Conclusion: Conflicted, Sarah decides to confront Amelia, who confesses everything and explains her desire to keep her family's legacy alive and support the community in any way possible. Moved by Amelia's story, Sarah makes a difficult choice to keep their secret while advocating for better conditions for those affected by the tragedy. The movie ends with Sarah writing an article about the town, focusing on rebuilding their spirits and lifting the cloud of mystery over Gloria's Home. Despite not revealing Amelia's identity, Sarah manages to promote unity, forgiveness, and progress in the community while honoring Gloria's memory."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Read the following context and choose the correct option to answer the question. Context: We all present these glossy lives to the world; coffee cups presented to dewy sunrises, champagne in airport lounges, luxurious restaurants that cost more than they should and share the blue skies days of exploration. I’m as guilty as anyone. But, what about behind those scenes? Those days where the wind is so strong you can’t instastory for talking (I’m looking at you Cornwall), when travel mistakes happen (like in Vienna where I accidentally booked our trip a day short) or when everyone asks you what your next trip will be and you sheepishly have to answer ‘er, not sure’. So I thought I’d get a few things off my chest, and confess a few of the reasons why I probably shouldn’t be calling myself a travel blogger. And yes, these are all very much first world problems. 1. I hate photographs of myself. Ironic, no? Especially when one of the first rules of blogging is all about the cult of personality. I just don’t like them. I wish I did, but there are few times that I fancy a photo and even less when I like the result. 2. We nip into a MacDonalds at least once every trip. It has now become a tradition between nicer restaurants to nip in and order a Big Mac and fries at some point of our trip – but especially in Europe for some reason. Why do their MacDonalds meals taste better? 3. Pastels aren’t really my shade. Again, I wish I could be super girly, twirling in gossamer skirts painted in spring shades but I’m just not. My colour palette is decidedly autumnal/jewel hued and usually sticks to a scarf draped around my neck in a hopefully fashionable manner. And I’m totally ok with that. 4. I once travelled all the way to New Zealand and back (stopping in 3 countries enroute) without a lens cap on my brand new, fairly expensive camera. This is in no way a #humblebrag about the trip, but a comment on how impractical I can be – and how careful I also am.

Genetic engineers Clive Nicoli and Elsa Kast hope to achieve fame by splicing animal DNA to create hybrids for medical use at the company N.E.R.D. (Nucleic Exchange Research and Development). Their work previously yielded Fred, a dog-sized vermiform creature intended as a mate for their female specimen, Ginger. After successfully mating them, Clive and Elsa plan to create a human-animal hybrid that could revolutionize science. Their employers Joan Chorot of N.E.R.D. and William Barlow forbid them from doing this. Instead, they are to find and extract proteins used for commercial drug production from Fred and Ginger. Clive and Elsa, however, disobey their superiors and pursue their own agenda in secret, developing a viable prepubescent female creature. Although they had planned to terminate the hybrid before it reached full term, Elsa persuades Clive to let it live. They discover that she is aging at a vastly accelerated rate. Elsa discovers that the creature is undergoing mental development such as that of a young human child. Elsa names the creature \\"Dren\\" after the creature spells out NERD, having seen the letters on Elsa's shirt. After moving Dren to a new location for fear of discovery, they find she has a dangerously high fever. In an attempt to save her they place her in a large industrial sink filled with cold water. Later on Clive fully submerges Dren in the sink, and in doing so discovers that Dren is amphibious, but remains ambiguous in whether he tried to save Dren or kill her. While studying Dren, Elsa and Clive neglect their work with Fred and Ginger. At a highly publicized presentation of their work, Fred and Ginger savagely fight to the death. It is subsequently discovered that Ginger had spontaneously changed to a male, but Elsa and Clive failed to notice because they were focused on Dren.

In a desperate bid to prevent the situation from spiraling out of control, the government of the Central African Republic has appealed to the international community for help in staving off the rebel advances. The involvement of representatives from central Africa, the United States, and Japan in the current discussions signifies the global concern for the situation and the urgency required in resolving it. During the talks, diplomats are expected to explore possible solutions for restoring peace and stability in the region, as well as addressing the grievances raised by the rebels. This collaborative approach, bringing together nations from different parts of the world, underlines the need for collective action in the face of such regional crises.

Draw Inuyasha's bangs, and two long, pointy lumps of hair on each side of his head. After drawing the head shape and shoulder and chest area for Inuyasha, the most natural next step is to add details to the face and hair. In this step, begin by drawing the eyebrows, which should be mostly straight, with slight angles towards the center. The eyes should be almond-shaped and consistent with the anime style, meaning they should be quite large and expressive. Next, draw the nose, which should be simply represented by a small curved line. For the mouth, sketch a straight line with a small curve at one end to illustrate his characteristic smirk. The detailing of Inuyasha's face is essential as it will help give life to the character. Now, focus on Inuyasha's hair. Start by drawing his bangs, which should consist of numerous, irregular strands of hair that are a mix of short and long. These should cover a considerable portion of his face, falling around the eyes and eyebrows region. After that, move on to the two long, pointy clumps of hair on each side of his head. These clumps should start at the top of his head and extend down past his shoulders. The shape of these distinctive clumps represents his dog demon ears, which are a crucial aspect of his character design.

The report estimates 830,000 graduate-level Stem experts and 450,000 technicians will be needed by 2020. In the UK some 23,000 engineers are graduating every year. But India is producing eight times as many, and China 20 times as many.

Jean-Philippe Rameau (French: [Zafilip Ramo]; (1683-09-25)25 September 1683 - (1764-09-12)12 September 1764) was one of the most important French composers and music theorists of the 18th century. He replaced Jean-Baptiste Lully as the dominant composer of French opera and is also considered the leading French composer for the harpsichord of his time, alongside Francois Couperin. Little is known about Rameau's early years, and it was not until the 1720s that he won fame as a major theorist of music with his Treatise on Harmony (1722) and also in the following years as a composer of masterpieces for the harpsichord, which circulated throughout Europe. Along with Francois Couperin, Rameau is one of the two masters of the French school of harpsichord music in the 18th century. Both composers made a decisive break with the style of the first generation of harpsichordists, who confined their compositions to the relatively fixed mould of the classical suite. This reached its apogee in the first decade of the 18th century with successive collections of pieces by Louis Marchand, Gaspard Le Roux, Louis-Nicolas Clerambault, Jean-Francois Dandrieu, Elisabeth Jacquet de la Guerre, Charles Dieupart, and Nicolas Siret.  Rameau and Couperin have different styles. They seem not to have known one another (Couperin was one of the official court musicians while Rameau was still an unknown; fame would only come to him after Couperin's death). Rameau published his first book of harpsichord pieces in 1706 while Couperin (who was fifteen years his senior) waited until 1713 before publishing his first \\"ordres.\\" Rameau's music includes pieces in the pure tradition of the French suite: imitative (\\"Le rappel des oiseaux,\\" \\"La poule\\") and character (\\"Les tendres plaintes\\", \\"L'entretien des Muses\\") pieces and works of pure virtuosity that resemble Scarlatti (\\"Les tourbillons,\\" \\"Les trois mains\\") as well as pieces that reveal the experiments of a theorist and musical innovator (\\"L'Enharmonique\\", \\"Les Cyclopes\\"), which had a marked influence on Daquin, Royer, and Jacques Duphly. The suites are grouped in the traditional way, by key.  Rameau's three collections appeared in 1706, 1724 and 1726 or 1727, respectively. After this, he only composed a single piece for the harpsichord: \\"La Dauphine\\" (1747). Other works, such as \\"Les petits marteaux,\\" have been doubtfully attributed to him.  During his semiretirement in the years 1740 to 1744, he wrote the Pieces de clavecin en concert (1741), which some musicologists consider the pinnacle of French Baroque chamber music. Adopting a formula successfully employed by Mondonville a few years earlier, these pieces differ from trio sonatas in that the harpsichord is not simply there as basso continuo to accompany other instruments (the violin, flute or viol) playing the melody but has an equal part in the \\"concert\\" with them. Rameau also claimed that the pieces would be equally satisfying as solo harpsichord works--although this statement is far from convincing, since the composer took the trouble to transcribe five of them himself--those where the lack of other instruments would show the least. What were some of his pieces?","output":"Jean-Philippe Rameau composed many beautiful pieces of music in his lifetime. Some of his famous pieces are: 1. \\"Le rappel des oiseaux\\" - This piece is inspired by bird sounds and is for the harpsichord. 2. \\"La poule\\" - A fun and lively piece, it imitates the sounds and movements of a chicken. 3. \\"Les tendres plaintes\\" - This piece is gentle and emotional, representing the tenderest of complaints. 4. \\"L'entretien des Muses\\" - A sweet and melodic piece that is like a conversation between the mythical Muses. 5. \\"Les tourbillons\\" - A fast and virtuosic piece, imitating whirlwinds. 6. \\"Les trois mains\\" - A challenging piece for the harpsichord, written as if played by three hands. 7. \\"L'Enharmonique\\" - A piece that shows Rameau's skills as a musical theorist and innovator. 8. \\"Les Cyclopes\\" - Inspired by the one-eyed mythological creatures, this piece is energetic and rhythmic. 9. \\"La Dauphine\\" - Composed in honor of the Dauphine (wife of the heir to the French throne), it is a beautiful and elegant piece. 10. \\"Les petits marteaux\\" - Though its attribution to Rameau is uncertain, this piece imitates the small hammer sounds found in some musical instruments. Additionally, Rameau wrote the \\"Pieces de clavecin en concert\\" (1741), which is considered one of the pinnacles of French Baroque chamber music. These compositions showcase the harpsichord as an equal partner with other instruments like violin, flute, and viol."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant. You will be given a task.

Although successful in Melbourne, \\"Neighbours\\" underperformed in the Sydney market and struggled for months before Seven cancelled it. The show was immediately bought by rival network Ten. After taking over production of the show, the new network had to build replica sets because Seven destroyed the originals to prevent its rival from obtaining them. Ten began screening \\"Neighbours\\" on 20 January 1986, taking off where the previous series left off and commencing with episode 171. \\"Neighbours\\" has since become the longest running drama series in Australian television and in 2005, it was inducted collectively into the Logie Hall of Fame.

The term coconut can refer to the whole coconut palm or the seed, or the fruit, which, botanically, is a drupe, not a nut. The spelling cocoanut is an archaic form of the word. The term is derived from the 16th-century Portuguese and Spanish word \\"coco\\" meaning \\"head\\" or \\"skull\\", from the three indentations on the coconut shell that resemble facial features.  - A mammary gland is an exocrine gland in mammals that produces milk to feed young offspring. Mammals get their name from the word \\"mammary\\". The mammary glands are arranged in organs such as the breasts in primates (for example, humans and chimpanzees), the udder in ruminants (for example, cows, goats, and deer), and the dugs of other animals (for example, dogs and cats). Lactorrhea, the occasional production of milk by the glands, can occur in any mammal, but in most mammals lactation, the production of enough milk for nursing, occurs only in phenotypic females who have gestated in recent months or years. It is directed by hormonal guidance from sex steroids. In a few mammalian species, male lactation can occur.  - Coconut milk is the liquid that comes from the grated meat of a brown coconut . It should not be confused with coconut water . The color and rich taste of coconut milk can be attributed to the high oil content . Most of the fat is saturated fat . Coconut milk is a very popular food ingredient used in Southeast Asia , South Asia , Southern China , the Caribbean and north of South America .  - Coconut water is the clear liquid inside young green coconuts (fruits of the coconut palm). In early development, it serves as a suspension for the endosperm of the coconut during the nuclear phase of development. As growth continues, the endosperm matures into its cellular phase and deposits into the rind of the coconut meat.  - Milk is a pale liquid produced by the mammary glands of mammals. It is the primary source of nutrition for infant mammals (including humans who breastfeed) before they are able to digest other types of food. Early-lactation milk contains colostrum, which carries the mother's antibodies to its young and can reduce the risk of many diseases. It contains many other nutrients including protein and lactose.    'coconut milk' is related to which object entity through the relation of 'natural product of taxon'?

Deputy Chief Operating Officer James Murdoch faced aggressive questioning from British lawmakers over his handling and account of the company's phone-hacking scandal.      While Mr. Murdoch in one instance altered details of earlier testimony, he again insisted that he didn't know until late last year the extent of illicit activities at the company's former News of the World tabloid.      Enlarge Image Close Associated Press News Corp.'s James Murdoch, seen in a video image, said 'it is appalling' News of the World had an investigator follow lawyers for hacking victims.      In his second appearance this year before a parliamentary committee probing hacking, Mr. Murdoch on Thursday deflected suggestions that he bungled the company's management of the scandal over the U.K. newspaper's illegal interception of voice-mail messages during the reporting process. The scandal has led to the resignation of senior News Corp. executives, the closure of the newspaper and more than a dozen arrests.      Mr. Murdoch denied that he misled the committee in prior testimony in July and accused former News Corp. employees—News of the World editor Colin Myler and lawyer Tom Crone—of giving misleading testimony. In statements to the Guardian newspaper Thursday, Mr. Myler said his testimony had been \\"accurate and consistent.\\" Mr. Crone called Mr. Murdoch's testimony \\"disingenuous.\\"      Mr. Murdoch conceded that News Corp.'s handling of the phone-hacking affair had been undermined by the company's inclination to reject legitimate criticism as persecution from rivals. It was \\"the tendency for a period of time to react to criticism or allegations as hostile or motivated commercially or politically,\\" Mr. Murdoch said. \\"What we didn't do, I think, necessarily, is reflect as dispassionately as we might have.\\"      Web of Connections Learn more about who's who and how they're all connected in the scandal over allegations of voice-mail interceptions and corrupt payments to police. View Interactive More photos and interactive graphics      One member of Parliament compared News Corp.'s U.K. newspaper unit to organized crime. \\"You must be the first mafia boss in history who was not aware that he was running a criminal enterprise,\\" said Tom Watson, a Labour politician and one of News Corp.'s harshest critics.      Mr. Murdoch called the comment inappropriate and offensive. News Corp. owns The Wall Street Journal.      In revisiting the details of his handling of the hacking scandal, Mr. Murdoch altered one aspect of his July testimony related to what he knew in 2008 about an email that prompted News Corp. to pay roughly £700,000, or about 1 million, in a settlement to a soccer-union official hacked by the News of the World. Mr. Murdoch authorized the payment in mid-2008.      The email—containing transcripts of hacked voice mails—appeared to contradict News Corp.'s longstanding assertion that phone hacking at the tabloid had been isolated to one reporter jailed for the practice in 2007. The email mentioned the names of two other reporters on the tabloid's staff, including reporter Neville Thurlbeck. It is now known as the \\"for Neville\\" email.      In July, testifying alongside his father, News Corp. Chairman and Chief Executive Rupert Murdoch, James Murdoch was asked whether in 2008 he saw or was \\"made aware of the 'for Neville' email, the transcript of hacked voice-mail messages?\\"      \\"No, I was not aware of that at the time,\\" he replied. That remark subsequently prompted Messrs. Myler and Crone to release a statement disputing Mr. Murdoch, saying they had informed him of the email.      On Thursday, Mr. Murdoch said he had been made aware of the email but that it hadn't been shown to him and he hadn't been briefed on its significance.      The email \\"was mentioned to me as evidence that was important with respect to it being a transcript of a voice-mail interception that proved that it was on behalf of the News of the World,\\" Mr. Murdoch said. But he clarified that it was mentioned to him only as a reason why the case should be settled and was never referred to as the \\"for Neville\\" email.      \\"The suspicion that perhaps other individuals were involved at the News of the World was not described to me, and the email was not shown to me either,\\" Mr. Murdoch said.      Mr. Murdoch has maintained that he became aware of broader problems at the tabloid only late last year, when new information surfaced in civil suits against the company.      After the hearing Thursday, a News Corp. spokesman said: \\"Mr. Murdoch's testimony has been clear and consistent that he was told of sufficient evidence to justify settling the case but given no indication that further investigation was necessary.\\"      Mr. Crone, the former News of the World lawyer, disputed that characterization. \\"The simple truth is that he was told by us in 2008 about the damning email and what it meant in terms of wider News of the World involvement,\\" Mr. Crone said in a statement to the Guardian newspaper. \\"It seems he now accepts he was told of the email, of the fact that it contained transcripts of voice-mail interceptions and that those interceptions were authorized by the News of the World.\\"      The News of the World—which was Britain's most popular weekly before it was closed in July—is the subject of three criminal investigations in the U.K.      Legislators on Thursday also questioned Mr. Murdoch about revelations that the tabloid hired a private investigator to follow two lawyers representing phone-hacking victims—surveillance that was commissioned while Mr. Murdoch was overseeing the paper.      Mr. Murdoch said he wasn't aware at the time that the surveillance had been commissioned, but he apologized that it had happened. \\"I want to say for the record that it is appalling, and it's something the company should never condone,\\" he said. He said Mr. Crone and another News of the World employee had commissioned the surveillance.      Mr. Crone didn't address the surveillance in his statement to the Guardian and didn't respond requests for comment for this article. In testimony in September, Mr. Crone denied ordering the surveillance.      Mr. Murdoch didn't work at News Corp. when most of the phone hacking allegedly occurred. He joined the company in late 2007 to run its operations in Europe and Asia, leaving the chief executive post at British Sky Broadcasting Group PLC, a U.K. pay-television company partially owned by News Corp. When he joined News Corp., he took on oversight of the company's British newspapers.

During questioning by MPs, Labour's Tom Watson suggested its UK arm had adopted the \\"omerta\\" code of silence.      Mr Murdoch said that was \\"offensive and not true\\" and said he was not made aware in 2008 that phone hacking went beyond one rogue reporter.      He also said two former executives had given MPs \\"misleading\\" evidence.      The clash with Mr Watson, who has pursued the company over the phone hacking scandal, came halfway through the two and a half hour session.      'Bound by secrecy'      Mr Murdoch repeatedly told the committee he had not been made aware of details suggesting phone hacking went beyond Clive Goodman - the former News of the World royal reporter jailed in 2007 - when he authorised a large out-of-court settlement to footballers' union leader Gordon Taylor in June 2008.      Mr Watson asked if he was familiar with the code of \\"omerta\\" - where people \\"bound together by secrecy\\" pursued their objectives \\"with no regard for the law\\" and suggested that was \\"an accurate description of News International in the UK\\".      You must be the first mafia boss in history who didn't know he was running a criminal enterprise Tom Watson MP      Mr Murdoch replied: \\"Absolutely not. I frankly think that is offensive and that's not true.\\"      The MP said the company was facing a series of allegations around hacking and told him: \\"You must be the first mafia boss in history who didn't know he was running a criminal enterprise.\\"      Mr Murdoch said that was \\"inappropriate\\" and said while it was a \\"matter of great regret\\" that \\"things went wrong\\" at the newspaper, when evidence had come to light \\"we acted... with great zeal and diligence to get to the bottom of issues to improve the processes to make sure they didn't happen again\\".      The BBC's political editor Nick Robinson, in the hearing, reported that a fellow MP said \\"oh come on\\" when Mr Watson made his mafia claim, whilst others on the committee sighed or \\"tutted\\".      Out-of-court settlement      Earlier in the hearing Mr Murdoch said he had not been shown a copy of the \\"For Neville\\" email - assumed to refer to former NoW chief reporter Neville Thurlbeck, which contained transcripts of voicemail messages revealing that Gordon Taylor's phone had been hacked - at a June 2008 meeting with legal manager Tom Crone.      At that meeting he agreed to authorise an increase in the out-of-court offer to Mr Taylor.      It was not shown to me at the time, nor was it described to me in those terms in any way James Murdoch      He said he was given \\"sufficient information to authorise the increase of the settlement offer\\" but added: \\"The nature of the so-called 'For Neville' email... any wider spread or evidence or suspicion of wider spread of wrongdoing - none of these things were mentioned to me.\\"      Mr Murdoch denied misleading the committee at a hearing in July, when he said he had not been aware of the email.      Two former NoW executives - former editor Colin Myler and former legal manager Tom Crone - have said they \\"did inform\\" Mr Murdoch of it at the time but he told the committee on Thursday: \\"I believe their testimony was misleading.\\"      MP Tom Watson said Neville Thurlbeck told him that Mr Crone had said he had shown the email to Mr Murdoch - something Mr Crone did not confirm when he gave evidence to the committee.      Mr Murdoch replied: \\"I really can't say what Mr Crone or Mr Thurlbeck may have discussed but my recollection is very clear.\\"      He was also asked whether he knew about a legal opinion given to the company by solicitors Farrer and Co in 2008 which stated there is \\"a powerful case that there is (or was) a culture of illegal information access used at NGN [News Group Newspapers] in order to produce stories for publication\\".      Mr Murdoch told MPs on Tuesday: \\"It was not shown to me at the time, nor was it described to me in those terms in any way.\\"      He said \\"clearly\\" some within the company knew about the legal advice and the \\"for Neville\\" email - but \\"none of those things were made available or discussed with me\\".      In a statement on Thursday, Mr Thurlbeck said he had compiled a dossier in his defence which \\"cleared my name and incriminated others\\" and claimed it had been \\"suppressed\\" by the News of the World.      Mr Thurlbeck is on police bail after being arrested on suspicion of unlawfully intercepting voicemail messages and has lodged a claim for unfair dismissal against News International.      The Sun      Mr Murdoch also said the recent arrest of a journalist on the Sun was a matter of \\"great concern\\" but said he had \\"no knowledge\\" of other News International papers being involved in phone hacking, aside from the News of the World      He did not rule out having to close The Sun if it was proved to have been involved but said he did not want to prejudge the outcome of investigations: \\"I shouldn't rule any corporate reaction to behaviour of wrongdoing out. That will be a decision taken at the time.\\"      He also apologised for The Sun's coverage of the 1989 Hillsborough tragedy, in which 96 Liverpool football fans died saying: \\"I am aware of the concerns and the hurt it caused and it is something we are very sorry for, and I am as well.\\"      Mr Murdoch also said revelations that his company had used a private detective to spy on lawyers acting for phone hacking victims in 2010 was \\"appalling\\" and \\"unacceptable\\" and apologised to committee member Mr Watson, who had also been put under surveillance in the past.      He also said the use of private investigators on his company's papers had since been \\"severely restricted\\".      In July, the News of the World was shut down after it was found to have hacked into the voicemail messages of prominent people, including murdered teenager Milly Dowler. The Metropolitan Police estimate about 6,000 may have had their phones hacked since 2002.      The row has put pressure on James Murdoch's position at News Corp - with nearly 35% of News Corporation investors voting against him being re-elected to the board last month. ||||| What is a one-paragraph summary of the above article?","output":"James Murdoch, who was the Deputy Chief Operating Officer of News Corp, faced questioning from British lawmakers about how he handled the company's phone-hacking scandal. He insisted that he did not know about the extent of the illegal activities at the News of the World tabloid until late the previous year. The scandal caused senior News Corp executives to resign, the closure of the newspaper, and multiple arrests."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant. User will you give you a task.

Sadly I don't remember the book anymore, but I do recall that I was captivated by the stories of Edgar Wallace. This Film represents a typical German Production of low quality. It does not hold my attention - although the story itself is good, it is just badly adabted. At the center of the misery are the characters that are overly simplyfied and exaggerated - they have no nuances in their performances. Even the well known and liked German Actors Joachim Fuchsberger and Eddy Aren't cannot rescue this poor spectacle. However there's hope ...

Translate to English","output":"Of course, if we give up temporary premises, we must be sure that the financing details are sorted out properly. When considering giving up temporary premises, such as rented office spaces or temporary commercial locations, it is essential to ensure that all financing details have been properly taken care of. This includes examining current financial commitments, future expenses, and overall financial stability of the business. First, evaluate the current financial obligations tied to the temporary premises. This will involve reviewing rental or lease agreements, existing contracts with suppliers, and any related insurance policies. It is essential to understand the terms and conditions associated with these agreements, including potential penalties for early termination or other breaches of contract. Next, consider the costs associated with moving out of the temporary premises and into a more permanent location. This may include expenses like hiring movers, purchasing or leasing new equipment, or renovating the new space to meet the needs of the business. At this stage, it is crucial to obtain accurate estimates of these costs and ensure that adequate funds are available to cover them. Furthermore, assess the overall financial stability of the business and its ability to generate the necessary funds for a smoother transition to a permanent location. This includes reviewing revenue projections, profit margins, and current cash flow. Be sure to take into account any seasonal fluctuations in revenue or other factors that may impact the business's financial status and create a contingency plan for these uncertainties. Finally, explore potential financing options to support this move. It may be helpful to consult with financial advisors, banks, or other lenders to discuss credit lines or loans, or to consider alternative funding methods like crowdfunding or angel investments. In summary, it is essential to be certain that the financial details are properly handled when giving up temporary premises and transitioning to a new, permanent location. Prioritizing financial stability, understanding contractual obligations, estimating costs, and seeking out adequate financing options will ensure a successful relocation."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Choose from:  (1). unacceptable;  (2). acceptable;","output":"(2). acceptable The given sentence - \\"I shaped the dough.\\" - is both syntactically and semantically acceptable. Let's break it down to understand why: Syntactic acceptability evaluates whether a sentence is structured correctly according to the grammatical rules of a language. In this case, the sentence is structured correctly in English: 1. The subject of the sentence is \\"I,\\" which is a pronoun referring to the speaker.  2. The verb of the sentence is \\"shaped,\\" which is the past tense of the verb \\"to shape.\\" It is an appropriate verb to describe an action that took place in the past. 3. The object of the sentence is \\"the dough,\\" which is a noun phrase comprised of the definite article \\"the\\" followed by the noun \\"dough.\\" The object of the verb \\"shaped\\" refers to the thing that was shaped, which is \\"the dough\\" in this case.  Overall, the sentence follows the standard subject-verb-object (SVO) word order and adheres to the grammatical rules of English. Therefore, it is syntactically acceptable. Semantic acceptability evaluates whether a sentence makes sense and conveys a clear meaning. The sentence communicates a clear action: the speaker (I) molded or formed the dough into a particular shape. This action is commonly done while making bread, pastries, or other baked goods, and it is a logical statement in the context of food preparation. Thus, the sentence is semantically acceptable as it conveys a clear and coherent meaning. Combining both syntactic and semantic acceptability, the sentence \\"I shaped the dough.\\" is deemed acceptable in both aspects."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Article: by: Sarah Bleau Updated: Jan 21, 2016 - 11:22 AM      Day seven of the search for two-year-old Noah Chamberlin began at 1:19 p.m., seven days to the minute of when he was reported missing.      It also began with seemingly hopeful news from Madison County Sheriff John Mehr.      Related Headlines PHOTOS: Vigil held as search for Noah Chamberlin continues      \\"We've got some leads that we have recovered and that's one reason…I'll just tell you that's one reason why we believe he's still there,” Sheriff Mehr said.      >> PHOTOS: Vigil held as search for Noah Chamerlin continues      Madison County Fire Chief Eric Turner said they have expanded their search grid to beyond 1,000 acres. He added they will take some of the equipment from the search to use for the upcoming potential winter weather.      \\"We want to get it out of there before the weather comes in because, like the sheriff alluded to, if we have a bad snowstorm coming here we might need that equipment elsewhere,\\" said Turner.      The Madison and Chester County sheriffs added search dogs came from Hunstville, Alabama Wednesday. Mehr explained the dogs have not and may not pick up a scent because two-year-old Noah is so small and not leaving enough of a scent.      Chester County Sheriff Blair Weaver said they have new search crews combing through areas they have already searched, in an effort to get a fresh perspective.      The same evening, nearly 200 people came together for a prayer vigil for Noah and his family.      \\"What if you were in that place? How would you want to be treated and what would you want done? You would want somebody to pray and lift you up, you want somebody to respect privacy,\\" Pastor Andy Morris, who's known the family for six years, told the crowd.      Morris said he met with the family just before the vigil.      \\"They're still very hopeful, still very faithful, they believe Noah is going to be found,\\" Morris said. \\"This family is heartbroken, this family is searching day and night because they desire for their loved one to come back home.\\"      Sheriff Weaver said earlier in the afternoon that the rumors about Noah's family - specifically citing those about his father's criminal history and his grandmother's relationship - need to stop.      He said they've looked into the family and added they are good citizens. Weaver also said time spent investigating rumors and speculation is hindering more constructive search efforts.      Noah went missing last Thursday afternoon while on a nature walk in the Chester County woods with his grandmother. He was added to the National Center for Missing and Exploited Children's website this week. ||||| As the search for 2-year-old Noah Chamberlin continues, a community is rallying around the search and praying he is found safe.      As the search for 2-year-old Noah Chamberlin continues, a community is rallying around the search and praying he is found safe.      Major developments in the search for missing 2-year-old to be announced at 4 p.m.      Two-year-old Noah Chamberlin went missing January 14, but the search for him has not let up.      Hundreds of law enforcement officials have remained relentless in the search and are swarming Chester County to find the missing boy. The toddler disappeared nearly a week ago while walking with his grandmother and sister in the woods near his home in Pinson, Tennessee, just 11 miles outside of Jackson.      Chester County Sheriff Blair Weaver is still calling the search for Noah a search and rescue operation, despite seemingly deadly conditions in the woods Noah was lost in and the search being in its seventh day.      Law enforcement officials said during a press conference Wednesday they have reason to believe Noah will be found.      \\"We've got some leads we've recovered, and that's one reason we feel he's still there,\\" they said.      Leaders would not elaborate on what type of leads or evidence they found. When pressed for how 'realistic' it is Noah will be found alive, investigators responded by saying they would not give up hope.      \\"We still believe he is out there and evidently a lot of people do too, because they're coming to help us. We appreciate the support; we appreciate the help,\\" Weaver said. \\"We haven't stopped and we're not going to stop.\\"      The Scale of the Search      Weaver said they are expecting to scale back the search for Noah on Friday due to inclement weather.      Currently, numerous resources and tools have been brought in to assist in the search for Noah, but many of those may be pulled out on Friday to help the county deal with winter weather.      Search leaders said even if they have to scale back the amount of equipment being used, that will not signify an end in the search. They are adamant they will not quit searching for Noah.      Officials searched throughout the night Tuesday and expanded the area from the 1,000 acres previously searched up through Tuesday.      Volunteers      The terrain is muddy and one man even flew to Tennessee from California to help officials search for Noah.      Volunteers are anxious to get back out to search for Noah. However, officials are not allowing volunteers to return to the search due to the hazards of the weather. Volunteers could get injured if they search during this time.      \\"They're doing everything in God's power to find this child,\\" search volunteer Gerald Parish said. \\"Everything that you can think of, they've thought of.\\"      Parish has been out searching and has seen it firsthand. He said he's surprised they haven't found Noah, but at the same time, he admits the area he went missing in is vast and hard to search.      Suspicions Arise      Many people aren't as forgiving as Parish--some are getting suspicious about Noah's disappearance.      TBI officials said they are still not doing an investigation and are only assisting in the search.      Law enforcement said FBI and TBI have thoroughly vetted family members and have cleared the family. They do not believe the past history has anything to do with the missing child.      Noah's father has been in trouble for narcotics in San Bernardino, California, but has no recorded problems in Tennessee.      TBI said it can only investigate if a district attorney requests an investigation, which has not happened yet.      A district attorney from a different county with zero ties to this case said state law prohibits the Chester County District Attorney from asking for a TBI investigation unless there is reasonable cause to suspect criminal activity.      He said being unable to find Noah is not evidence of criminal activity.      Additionally, Child Protective Services with the Department of Children's Services said they could not comment on if they have any past history with the family, but they did say they are not currently involved with the family at this time.      \\"Sheriff Weaver is telling us that they [family] would prefer not to address the media at this time. Maybe they're waiting for a result,\\" Tom Mapes,Madison County Sheriff's Department, said.      While frustration may be mounting for those following the search for Noah, others said every effort possible is being made to bring the little boy home.      \\"They're doing everything humanly possible that they can do to find this child,\\" Parish said.      Wednesday night prayer vigil for Noah      The community came together Wednesday and instead of church services, they gathered for a prayer vigil in Noah's honor.      One of the pastors said he would not be surprised if the entire gymnasium at Chester County High School is full of people wanting to pray for the toddler.      It's been a tough seven days for the community. People have donated their time and money to help find Noah. Now, they're coming together through faith with an evening prayer vigil. All of them will be praying for a miraculous rescue that would bring Noah home.      \\"Regardless of the outcome--trusting in God and trusting that he is in control, that he ultimately has control of Noah's life--that, I believe, is the main source for the comfort of prayer,\\" Pastor John Gaters of Pinson Baptist Church said.      While people were praying, law enforcement were searching.      At a time when many would be losing hope, the Chester County community is staying faithful to pray for a miracle.      \\"The game plan remains the same. The goal is to find him,\\" Mapes said.      Many gathered together at the school to pray for Noah and for a safe return and for answers.      \\"I'll just be glad when they have answers,\\" Angela Harris said      \\"I'm just grateful that the community we live in people come together, they'll help, come together and help,\\" Tim Roland said.      The community is also rallying behind Sheriff Blair Weaver, who continues to search relentlessly for the toddler.      Weaver said at some point, the search will need to be scaled back and that could begin after Wednesday night.      Rough Terrain and Dropping Temperatures      The dropping temperatures and rough terrain are making the search for little Noah even more difficult.      \\"It is rough country. You could step off into the hole and not even know it's there,\\" Charles Wooley said.      Wooley has spent all of his 70-plus years living in the area, and he said sinkholes are an easy way to break a leg.      \\"Here's how they normally start: as the water runs, it can get deeper and deeper and deeper,\\" Wooley said.      Sinkholes are all over Wooley's farm. He said the woods where Noah went missing has much rougher terrain than his, so navigating over the hills and gulleys and through the trees is tricky.      Sometimes the holes are completely covered in grass.      He said those woods would be tough to survive in, even for a trained adult.      \\"If they dropped in there--and sometimes dirt and mud could fall on them--you'd never know he's there,\\" Wooley said.      To make it more difficult, Wooley said it rained in the area Thursday night after Noah went missing.      \\"If the soil in the hole underneath is soupy enough, or loose, they could keep on going,\\" Wooley said.      That is why he believes thousands of people and dogs with all kinds of equipment have not found Noah in seven days of searching.      He is worried it could end up being the reason they never do.      \\"Losing a child has to be one of the most horrible things a parent could face,\\" Wooley said. \\"It's just a sad situation and you can't put it any other way.\\"      Searchers have been using special cameras to look inside sinkholes for the past few days.      But, there are so many of them, it could take a while to check every one.      Copyright 2016 WMC Action News 5.

I was prescribed Hydrocodone for the pain before the surgery but complained about not being able to sleep . So after the surgery my Dr. prescribed Oxycodone . What must have happened before the person required surgery ?","output":"Before the person required surgery for their torn cartilage in the right knee, several events and factors might have contributed to the injury and the decision for surgical intervention. Here is a detailed account of possible events leading up to the surgery: 1. Initial Injury: The person may have experienced a traumatic event or participated in an activity that put stress on the knee joint, leading to the tear in the cartilage. This could involve sports, accidents, or a sudden twist or impact on the knee. Common sports that can cause knee injuries include soccer, basketball, skiing, and running. 2. Onset of Symptoms: After the initial injury, the person likely started experiencing symptoms such as pain, swelling, stiffness, and reduced range of motion in the affected knee. They might also have felt a locking or catching sensation when trying to move the joint. 3. Initial Consultation: The individual probably sought medical advice from a healthcare professional due to the persistent symptoms. The physician might have conducted a physical examination, assessed the knee's range of motion, and palpated the joint to identify any abnormalities. 4. Diagnostic Tests: To confirm the diagnosis of torn cartilage, the healthcare professional may have ordered additional imaging tests, such as an X-ray, MRI, or CT scan, to get a detailed view of the knee joint and surrounding structures. This would help determine the extent of the injury and rule out any other possible conditions. 5. Non-Surgical Treatment: In some cases, prior to deciding on surgery, the physician may have recommended conservative treatment options to manage the pain and inflammation, such as rest, ice, compression, elevation (RICE), and over-the-counter pain medications. Additionally, the person might have been advised to use crutches, a knee brace, or participate in physical therapy to strengthen the muscles around the knee joint and improve mobility. 6. Evaluation of Treatment Progress: After attempting non-surgical treatment options, the healthcare professional likely assessed the person's progress to determine if the symptoms had improved or if further intervention was required. This might include follow-up appointments, physical examinations, and additional imaging tests. 7. Decision for Surgery: If conservative treatment options failed to alleviate the symptoms or if the cartilage tear was severe, the healthcare professional might have determined that surgery was necessary to repair the damage and prevent further complications. This decision would have been based on factors such as the person's age, activity level, pain tolerance, and overall health. 8. Preoperative Appointment: Prior to surgery, the person would have had a preoperative consultation to discuss the surgical procedure, potential risks and complications, and necessary preparations. The physician may have also ordered preoperative tests, such as blood work, to ensure the individual was fit for surgery. In summary, the person likely experienced an injury that led to a tear in the cartilage of their right knee. They would have undergone several steps to diagnose the issue and attempt non-surgical treatments before ultimately requiring surgery. During this process, they were prescribed Hydrocodone for pain management but requested an alternative medication due to sleep-related side effects. Consequently, their doctor prescribed Oxycodone following the surgery."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant. User will you give you a task.

Question: Read the following paragraph and extract the answer for the question: What was the full birth name of the person who was declared the third-greatest Indonesian musician of all time?  Chrismansyah Rahadi ([xrisˈmanʃah raˈhadi]; 16 September 1949 – 30 March 2007), born Christian Rahadi but better known by his stage name of Chrisye ([xəˈriʃə]), was an Indonesian progressive pop singer and songwriter. In his 40-year career he won many awards and accolades; in 2011 Rolling Stone Indonesia declared him the third-greatest Indonesian musician of all time. Born in Jakarta of mixed Chinese-Indonesian descent, Chrisye became interested in music at an early age. At high school he played bass guitar in a band he formed with his brother, Joris. In the late 1960s he joined Sabda Nada (later Gipsy), a band led by his neighbours, the Nasutions. In 1973, after a short hiatus, he rejoined the band to play in New York for a year. He briefly returned to Indonesia and then went back to New York with another band, the Pro's. After once again returning to Indonesia, he collaborated with Gipsy and Guruh Sukarnoputra to record the 1976 indie album Guruh Gipsy. Following the success of Guruh Gipsy, in 1977 Chrisye recorded two of his most critically acclaimed works: \\"Lilin-Lilin Kecil\\" by James F. Sundah, which eventually became his signature song, and the soundtrack album Badai Pasti Berlalu. Their success landed him a recording contract with Musica Studios, with whom he released his first solo album, Sabda Alam, in 1978. Over his almost 25-year career with Musica he recorded a further eighteen albums, and in 1980 acted in a film, Seindah Rembulan. Chrisye died in his Jakarta home on 30 March 2007 after a long battle with lung cancer. Known for his stiff stage persona and smooth vocals, Chrisye was critically acclaimed in Indonesia. Five albums to which he contributed were included in Rolling Stone Indonesia's list of the 150 Best Indonesian Albums of All Time; another four of his songs (and a fifth to which he contributed) were classified as some of the best Indonesian songs of all time in a later issue of the same magazine. Several of his albums received certification of silver or gold. He received two lifetime...

Thomas Dagget, a Catholic seminary student, loses his faith when he sees disturbing visions of a war between angels. Years later, Thomas is a detective with the Los Angeles Police Department. Two angels fall to Earth: one, Simon, enters Thomas' home and warns him of coming events, before disappearing. The second, Uziel, a lieutenant of the angel Gabriel, is killed in an altercation with Simon. Investigating the disturbance, Thomas finds in Simon's apartment the obituary of a recently deceased Korean War veteran named Colonel Arnold Hawthorne and the theology thesis about angels which Thomas himself wrote in seminary. Meanwhile, in Chimney Rock, Arizona, Simon finds the dead veteran awaiting burial and sucks the evil soul out of the body.The medical examiner informs Thomas that Uziel's body is like nothing he has seen before: it has no eyes, no signs of bone growth, hermaphroditism, and the same blood chemistry as an aborted fetus. Among the personal effects found on the body is an ancient, hand-written Bible, which includes an extra chapter of the Book of Revelation that describes a second war in heaven and prophecy that a \\"dark soul\\" will be found on Earth and used as a weapon.Unknown to Thomas, Gabriel arrives on Earth. Needing a human helper, Gabriel catches Jerry, a suicide, in the moment of his death and keeps him in a state of limbo. Unhappily dominated by Gabriel, Jerry retrieves Uziel's belongings from the police station while Gabriel destroys Uziel's body in the morgue. After finding Hawthorne's obituary, Gabriel and Jerry head for Chimney Rock. Before Gabriel arrives, at the local reservation school Simon hides Hawthorne's soul in a little Native American girl, Mary, who immediately falls ill and is taken care of by her teacher, Katherine.After finding Uziel's burnt body, all evidence of its oddity now lost, Thomas hurries to Chimney Rock. When Gabriel realizes Hawthorne's soul is missing, he confronts Simon. Gabriel says Hawthorne's soul will tip the balance to whichever side possesses it. Should the rebellious angels win, Heaven will become like Hell with earth in its thrall. Simon refuses to reveal its location, and Gabriel kills him, ripping out his heart. Mary shows signs of possession by the evil soul; she suddenly recounts an incident from Hawthorne's harrowing war experiences in first-person perspective. Meanwhile, Thomas examines Simon's remains and questions Katherine. In Hawthorne's home, he finds evidence of war crimes. Thomas visits a church to reflect and is shaken by a verbal confrontation with Gabriel. He is beginning to understand the nature of the jealous angels who hate humans because God loves them most.At school, Katherine finds Gabriel questioning the children. After he leaves, she rushes to Mary's home and finds Thomas there. As Mary's condition worsens, Katherine takes Thomas to an abandoned mine where she had seen Gabriel. Inside, they find angelic script and experience together a terrible vision of the angelic war. They rush back to Mary's home, only to find Gabriel and Jerry there. Thomas kills Jerry, who thanks him for the release. Katherine stops Gabriel temporarily when her wild gunshot misses him and blows up Mary's trailer home. The three protagonists flee to a Native American site where Mary can be exorcised. In a hospital ICU ward, Gabriel recruits a new unwilling assistant, Rachel, just as she dies of a terminal illness. He needs her because he doesn't know how to drive.That night, Lucifer confronts Katherine and tells her that \\"other angels\\" have taken up this war against mankind, and since then, no human souls have been able to enter Heaven. He knows of Gabriel's plot to use Hawthorne's soul to overthrow the obedient angels, and he knows that if Gabriel wins, under his influence Heaven will ultimately devolve into another Hell. That's unwanted competition. The next day, Lucifer appears to Thomas and advises him to use Gabriel's lack of faith against him. Gabriel arrives and attempts to disrupt the exorcism ritual. Thomas kills Rachel, and he and Katherine fight Gabriel.Lucifer appears first encouraging the tribe to complete the exorcism. Then he confronts Gabriel telling him that his war is based upon arrogance, which is evil, making it Lucifer's territory. Gabriel taunts Lucifer about his past when he fell from grace; Lucifer tells Gabriel he needs to go home and rips out his heart. Simultaneously Mary expels out Hawthorne's soul, a rancid cloud of evil. The \\"enemy ghost\\" starts to attack the people but a bright light from Heaven immediately destroys it. With the threat to his evil kingdom eliminated, Lucifer tells Thomas and Katherine to \\"come home\\" with him. They staunchly refuse. \\"I have my soul...and my faith,\\" declares Thomas.

Los Angeles (CNN) -- Robin Thicke's summertime hit \\"Blurred Lines\\" is an illegal rip-off of Marvin Gaye's \\"Got to Give It Up,\\" Gaye's children claim in court documents filed Wednesday. Fans, journalists and music experts immediately recognized similarities between Gaye's 1977 hit and the 2013's summertime smash, Gaye's heirs contend. The controversy is a high-stakes legal fight involving an alleged conflict of interest with Sony-ATV, the music publisher half-owned by Michael Jackson's estate. Gaye's heirs not only accuse Thicke and \\"Blurred Lines\\" co-writers Pharrell Williams and \\"T.I.\\" Clifford Harris Jr. of copying Gaye's song, but they also contend Sony-ATV failed to meet its responsibility to protect the copyright. The Gaye family contracted with Sony-ATV after the singer-songwriter's death to administer his music catalog, but it also represents","output":"Thicke, Williams, and Harris Jr., leading to an inherent conflict of interest that the family believes has compromised the publisher's capacity to properly defend their father's intellectual property. The crux of the court case, therefore, revolves around whether \\"Blurred Lines\\" unlawfully borrowed key aspects from \\"Got to Give It Up\\" and whether Sony-ATV's handling of the matter with respect to their dual-sided clientele constitutes a significant breach of fiduciary duty. The implications of such a case are immense, reaching far beyond the involved parties and potentially affecting the entire music industry. As the copyright infringement allegations against Thicke, Williams, and Harris Jr. continue to surface, the intricacies of each claim draw considerable attention to the ongoing debate surrounding the originality in music, the potential line between inspiration and theft, and the responsibility of publishers in safeguarding the rights of their clients. The Gaye family's impassioned battle to preserve the legacy of their father's work is indicative of deeper tensions within the artistic community, where the line between acceptable borrowing of musical elements and plagiarism remains fraught with ambiguity. This highly publicized case has the potential to set a precedent for future copyright disputes, as it raises questions about the legal safeguards that should be implemented to prevent publishers from becoming caught in the middle of conflicting interests. In particular, the court proceedings may offer clarity on the potential consequences of dual representation by a single publishing house, emphasizing the need for more robust guidelines and transparent negotiations to ensure equal protection for all parties involved. Beyond the legal and financial implications, the impact of this case on the careers of Thicke, Williams, and Harris Jr., as well as the reputation of Michael Jackson's estate and Sony-ATV, is also notable. With intertwining interests and damages that could amount to millions of dollars, the outcome of this dispute will likely reverberate throughout the industry and may lead to further examination and potential reform of copyright laws and music publishing practices. As the case unfolds, it is clear that the Gaye family remains steadfast in their pursuit of justice in defense of their father's legacy. Embroiled in contentious legal battles and public scrutiny, the underlying message is that creative integrity and the preservation of artistic works are essential in an industry that thrives on the power of music. One thing is certain: as the world watches, the outcome of this case will shape the future course of music copyright law and its enforcement for years to come."},{"instruction":"You should describe the task and explain your answer.

Q: Passage: According to the Yuanshi, the Yuan fleet set out with an estimated 15,000 Mongol and Chinese soldiers and 1,600-8,000 Korean soldiers in 300 large vessels and 400-500 smaller craft along with several thousand sailors, although figures vary considerably depending on the source and many modern historians consider the numbers exaggerated. The primary port for the operation was Quanzhou in Fujian, then the center of China's maritime trade. They landed on Komodahama beach on Tsushima Island on October 5, 1274. Sō Sukekuni, governor of Tsushima, led a cavalry unit of 80 to defend the island, but he and his outnumbered unit were killed in the engagement. The Mongols and Koreans subsequently invaded Iki. Tairano Takakage, the Governor of Iki, fought the invaders with about 100 of his cavalrymen, but he killed himself after his unit was defeated. The Mongol forces landed on November 19 in Hakata Bay, a short distance from Dazaifu, the ancient administrative capital of Kyūshū. The following day brought the Battle of Bun'ei , also known as the \\"First Battle of Hakata Bay\\". The Japanese coalition force opposing them included 120 armed samurai each with a warband and likely numbered between 3,000 and 6,000 strong. Later accounts have both sides believing themselves to be drastically outnumbered by the enemy; the Yuanshi provides an estimate of 102,000 for the Japanese force, while the Japanese Hachiman Gudokun describes the invaders as outnumbering the Japanese 10 to 1. Conlan argues that the Yuanshi's account of the battle suggests that both the Japanese and Yuan forces were of similar size. Conlan estimated that both armies numbered around 3,000 each .

This is due to the supranational nature of community institutions, particularly the Commission and Parliament. In other words, the involvement of these European institutions is key to addressing certain issues within member countries without directly interfering with their internal politics. The Commission, Council, and Parliament all hold specific powers and responsibilities within the European Union, which enable them to ensure adherence to EU laws, policies, and standards. The European Commission, for instance, is responsible for proposing legislation, implementing decisions, and overseeing the application of EU treaties. In this capacity, it can take action to address any violations or discrepancies among the member states. Similarly, the European Parliament serves as a democratic forum where members represent their respective citizens, ensuring that their interests are considered and acted upon. The Council of the European Union, on the other hand, represents the interests of EU member governments and works with the Parliament to coordinate policies, adopt legislation, and negotiate international agreements. In this role, it has the power to ensure that actions taken by member states align with EU guidelines and overarching objectives. By utilizing these supranational institutions, the European Union can address various issues within its member countries without directly intervening in their internal decision-making processes. Such an approach respects the sovereignty of each nation while also fostering cooperation, unity, and accountability within the Union.

Her husband Frank (Jean Sorel) is a lawyer working for Brighton's practice. They all live together in a large apartment with Joan (Edy Gall), Frank's teenage daughter from a previous marriage. Carol has been visiting a psychoanalyst (George Rigaud) because of a string of disturbing dreams she's been having featuring her decadent neighbor, Julia Durer (Anita Strindberg). Julia's frequent, late-night parties infuriate and yet excite Carol, evoking images of wild sex-and-drug orgies. During a meeting between Edmund and Frank, they talk about their recent court cases in which Edmund asks Frank if he has been unfaithful to Carol, which Frank denies. Then a phone call is made by an anonymous woman who claims to Edmund that she has damaging information about his family. But unknown to everyone, Frank is indeed having an affair with his personal secretary Deborah whom he meets after work at her country house for some romantic tryst. Carol's dreams continue which become more complicated during scenes that appear to be dreams or hallucinations. Describing her latest one to her psychoanalyst, they depict a lesbian encounter between the two women, culminating in Carol grisly stabbing the seductive Julia to death. In an enigmatic coda to the dream sequence, Carol sees two kaftan-clad hippies (Mike Kennedy and Penny Brown) who have apparently witnessed the whole thing without intervening. The following day, it's revealed that Julia Durer has indeed been murdered. Inspector Corvin (Stanley Baker) from Scotland Yard arrives to take charge of the investigation. The room and condition of the dead body are identical to their depiction in the dream sequence. To make matters even more incriminating, there is a discarded fur coat near the body.

Mass deaths at about 25 separate colonies have been reported since the weekend, including at Mt Ommaney, Redbank, Boonah, Palmwoods, Laidley and Gatton.      RSPCA spokesman Michael Beatty says the heatwave was a significant hit to the population of bats across the state.      \\"The heatwave was basically a catastrophe for all the bat colonies in south-east Queensland,\\" he said.      \\"That's obviously going to have a pretty disturbing impact on those colonies and those colonies are vital to our ecosystem.\\"      The smell of bat carcasses has caused problems for locals.      The Scenic Rim Regional Council, west of Brisbane, has organised rubbish collectors to clear up the carcasses of about 2,000 bats.      Residents near Boonah's Athol Terrace lookout say they have been putting up with the stench of the dead animals for four days.      Hundreds of bats also lie dead in trees and nearby bushes, and are being eaten by maggots.      The council today advised local residents it will not send workers into nearby bushland to collect the remaining bat carcasses, as it could cause further disruption to the nearby colony.      One resident has told the ABC she is receiving anti-viral treatment after being scratched by a baby bat while clearing the dead animals out of her tree with a rake.      Further north, Lockyer Valley Regional Council says it also faces a massive task of cleaning up thousands of dead bats from around Laidley and Gatton.      Sunshine Coast Regional Council has sent workers out to collect thousands more dead bats near Palmwoods.      At least 16 people across south-east Queensland are receiving anti-viral treatment after coming into close contact with a bat.      Queensland Health is advising people not to touch the animals and to call authorities for help in clearing them away.      Sammy Ringer from Bat Rescue echoed those concerns, saying it was best to call a wildlife volunteer or a vet.      \\"Don't touch them, they're stressed,\\" she said.      \\"If they do bite or scratch you and break the skin you can get a vaccination, you can get a shot for the lyssavirus.\\"      Topics: local-government, phenomena, environmental-impact, boonah-4310, southport-4215, maroochydore-4558      First posted ||||| Queensland heatwave: Brisbane set to roast as weekend temperatures soar      Updated      The scorching heatwave gripping much of Queensland is being felt in Brisbane today, with residents set to roast in temperatures of up to 41 degrees Celsius.      At 9:25am, the mercury had already hit 35.1C, with the apparent temperature hovering at 37.4C, according to the Bureau of Meteorology website.      By 1:00pm, the temperature had risen to 38C, although the apparent temperature was 41C.      Queensland's interior has been sweltering through record-breaking heat in recent days, along with parts of Central Australia and north-western New South Wales.      The heatwave continued as a Bureau of Meteorology report revealed 2013 was the hottest year on record in Australia.      The mass of hot air causing the extreme weather again led to searing temperatures in central and western Queensland on Friday.      St George topped the temperature list with 47.2C, while Winton and Longreach also had scorchers at 46.4C and 46.3C respectively.      Charleville followed on 46.1C, while Blackall, Roma and Thargomindah all recorded temperatures just above 45C.      Brisbane's top for Friday was 34.3C, but the mercury is predicted to reach 41C today as northerly winds push the heatwave south.

Queenslanders have also been urged to put their health first during the current heatwave.      Last summer, paramedics responded to more than 350 cases of heat-related illness across the state.      Steven Clarke from Queensland Ambulance says drinking plenty of water is the key.      Mr Clarke says families should ensure loved ones are coping with the heat, with the elderly particularly vulnerable.      \\"For the elderly and people with chronic illnesses, especially with kidney problems, diabetic problems, obese people, they need to take extra care,\\" he said.      \\"Probably a critical point to make is family need to check their loved ones - grandad and grandma living on their own - they need to ring them up, they need to go around and visit them and make sure they are doing the right thing.

Article: We've reached a strange--some would say unusual--point. While fighting world hunger continues to be the matter of vital importance according to a recent report from the World Health Organization (WHO), more people now die from being overweight, or say, from being extremely fat, than from being underweight. It's the good life that's more likely to kill us these days. Worse, nearly l8 million children under the age of five around the world are estimated to be overweight. What's going on? We really don't have many excuses for our weight problems. The dangers of the problem have been drilled into us by public-health campaigns since 2001 and the message is getting through--up to a point. In the 1970s, Finland, for example, had the highest rate of heart disease in the world and being overweight was its main cause. Not any more. A public-health campaign has greatly reduced the number of heart disease deaths by 80 per cent over the past three decades. Maybe that explains why the percentage of people in Finland taking diet pills doubled between 2001 and 2005, and doctors even offer surgery of removing fat inside and change the shape of the body. That has become a sort of fashion. No wonder it ranks as the world's most body-conscious country. We know what we should be doing to lose weight--but actually doing it is another matter. By far the most popular excuse is not taking enough exercise. More than half of us admit we lack willpower. Others blame good food. They say: it's just too inviting and it makes them overeat. Still others lay the blame on the Americans, complaining that pounds have piled on thanks to eating too much American-style fast food. Some also blame their parents--their genes. But unfortunately, the parents are wronged because they're normal in shape, or rather slim. It's a similar story around the world, although people are relatively unlikely to have tried to lose weight. Parents are eager to see their kids shape up. Do as I say--not as I do. Question: The example of Finland is used to illustrate   _  .

Color Me Badd is an American contemporary R&B group that was formed in Oklahoma City, Oklahoma. The original members of the group were lead singer Bryan Abrams (born November 16, 1969), second tenor Mark Calderon (born September 27, 1970), second tenor Sam Watters (born July 23, 1970) and baritone Kevin Thornton (born June 17, 1969). They formed in 1985 and broke up in 1998 before reuniting in 2010, with various lineups since. As of 2016, they operate as a trio with Abrams, Calderon and Adam Emil. Kevin Thornton left the group in October 1998 to pursue the ministry. He became a licensed minister, and has since served as an evangelist, youth pastor and worship leader at his home church, Without Walls Church, in Fort Worth, Texas. He operates Kevin Thornton Ministries in Texas. In 2008, he released a solo album, Conversions, blending contemporary hip-hop/rap with gospel and soul music.  Sam Watters pursued a career as a record producer, achieving success producing for Jessica Simpson, Celine Dion, Fantasia, Anastacia, Natasha Bedingfield, Kelly Clarkson, 98 Degrees, Blake Lewis, and others. Watters is a member of the production/songwriting team The Runaways, which also includes Rico Love, Wayne Wilkins, Ryan Tedder, and Louis Biancaniello. He married R&B singer and former American Idol contestant Tamyra Gray in 2006.  Mark Calderon worked with artists such as Stevie Brock, whose 2002 remake of \\"All 4 Love\\" reached number 1 on the Disney charts; and with IPV, who is signed with Wright Entertainment and had songs played on the television series House and Knight Rider. In 1992, Calderon married Lisa Smedley-Calderon, who was formerly Color Me Badd's fashion stylist.  In 2001, Bryan Abrams released a solo album entitled Welcome to Me. In 2007, he co-starred on the VH1 reality TV series Mission: Man Band, which also included former boy band members Jeff Timmons of 98 Degrees, Chris Kirkpatrick of *NSYNC and Rich Cronin of Lyte Funkie Ones, seeing if they could make it as a new group. The show was canceled after seven episodes. In 2007, after being approached by Violent J and Shaggy 2 Dope, Abrams co-wrote and recorded an appearance on the Insane Clown Posse song \\"Truth Dare\\", which was released on the compilations Psychopathics from Outer Space 3 (2007) and Featuring Freshness (2011). In 2010, Abrams wrote three songs for Kool & the Gang, singing lead on all three tracks.  On August 22, 2000, Giant Records released the compilation album The Best of Color Me Badd. What else did they work on during this time?","output":"Color Me Badd was a group of four friends who sang songs together. They were Bryan, Mark, Sam, and Kevin. They made music from 1985 to 1998, and then came back together in 2010. But, Kevin is not part of the group anymore. When the group was not together, the members did different things. Kevin decided to help people by talking about God. He also made music that talks about God. Sam made music for other famous singers like Jessica Simpson and Celine Dion. Mark worked with other musicians too, like Stevie Brock and IPV. Bryan made his own music and was part of a TV show where people from other music groups tried to make a new group together. In 2000, a CD with their best songs was made for people to remember and enjoy their music.

Charles Michael \\"Chuck\\" Schuldiner (May 13, 1967 - December 13, 2001) was an American singer, songwriter, and guitarist. He founded the pioneering band Death in 1983. Schuldiner is often referred to as \\"The Godfather of death metal\\", and his obituary in the January 5, 2002 issue of UK's Kerrang! magazine said that \\"Chuck Schuldiner was one of the most significant figures in the history of metal.\\" Schuldiner was born on May 13, 1967, on Long Island, New York to a Jewish father of Austrian descent and a mother from the American South, a convert to Judaism. Both of his parents were teachers. In 1968, his family moved to Florida.  Schuldiner was the youngest of three children: he had an older brother named Frank and an older sister named Bethann. He started playing guitar at the age of 9; his 16-year-old brother had died and his parents bought him a guitar, thinking it would help with his grief. He took classical lessons for less than a year in which his teacher taught him \\"Mary had a Little Lamb\\", which he did not like very much, and almost stopped completely, until his parents saw an electric guitar at a yard sale and bought it for him. The young Schuldiner immediately took to the instrument. After getting amps, he never stopped playing, writing and teaching himself. Schuldiner was known to spend the weekend in the garage or his room playing his guitar, but was limited to three hours on weekdays when school was in session. Schuldiner first played in public in his early teens.  Schuldiner was originally inspired by Metallica, Iron Maiden, Kiss and classical jazz, among others. He was particularly interested in the metal movement known as NWOBHM - New Wave of British Heavy Metal - and cited bands of that genre among his favorites. He frequently cited French band Sortilege as his personal favorite metal group. Slayer, Celtic Frost, Possessed, Mercyful Fate/King Diamond and Metallica were later influences he would apply more to his own band. Later in his career, Schuldiner frequently cited progressive metal bands such as Watchtower, Coroner and Queensryche as influences. The official Schuldiner website, Empty Words, quotes Schuldiner's mother making the claim that he enjoyed all forms of music except country and rap. He also enjoyed jazz and classical music in addition to metal and British alternative acts such as Lush.  Schuldiner performed well in school before becoming bored with education, and eventually dropped out. He later regretted this decision. He has stated that if he had not become a musician, he would have liked to have become a veterinarian or a cook.

Please answer the following question: Found the following article online, use it to answer the question: What is the first name of the person who conceptualized \\"Single Ladies\\" after Beyoncé's secret marriage to hip hop recording artist Jay-Z?  \\"Single Ladies (Put a Ring on It)\\" was written by Beyoncé, Terius \\"The-Dream\\" Nash, Thaddis \\"Kuk\\" Harrell, and Christopher \\"Tricky\\" Stewart, and was produced by Nash and Stewart. Beyoncé recorded the song in May 2008 at the Boom Boom Room Studio in Burbank, California, and it was mixed by Jaycen Joshua and Dave Pensado, with assistance from Randy Urbanski and Andrew Wuepper. Nash conceptualized \\"Single Ladies\\" after Beyoncé's secret marriage to hip hop recording artist Jay-Z in April 2008. Stewart commented that the song was \\"the only public statement that [Beyoncé and Jay-Z had] ever made about marriage\\", and that while in the studio recording the song Beyoncé had remained tightlipped, even to the point of removing her wedding band. Beyoncé's marriage inspired Nash to compose a song about an issue that affected many people's relationships: the fear or unwillingness of men to commit. In an interview with Billboard magazine, Beyoncé added that she was drawn to the song because of the universality of the topic, an issue that \\"people are passionate about and want to talk about and debate\\". She stated that although \\"Single Ladies\\" is a playful uptempo song, it addresses an issue that women experience every day.In \\"Single Ladies\\", Beyoncé portrays her alter ego Sasha Fierce, which appears on the second part of I Am... Sasha Fierce. The song was released simultaneously with \\"If I Were a Boy\\"; as lead singles, they were meant to demonstrate the concept of the dueling personalities of the singer. This reinforced the theme of the album, which was created by placing its ballads and uptempo tracks on separate discs. The singles debuted on US radio on October 8, 2008; \\"Single Ladies\\" did so on mainstream urban New York radio station Power 105.1. Both singles were added to rhythmic contemporary radio playlists on October 12, 2008; \\"Single Ladies\\" was sent to urban contemporary playlists the same day, while \\"If I Were a Boy\\" was instead classified for contemporary hit radio. The two songs were released as a double A-side...

According to this legend, Earth is supposed to somehow destroy this empire. Step 2: Assess the quote by Trevize Trevize expresses disbelief at how a dying world could be a potential threat to the entire empire. This skepticism shows that Trevize may be looking for a logical explanation or clarification regarding the matter. Step 3: Address Trevize's concerns In response to Trevize's doubts, I could provide more details about the legend to help him understand its basis and relevance. Step 4: Elaborate on the legend \\"At the core of the legend, it is believed that the people of Earth were gifted with immense intellect, cunning, and adaptability. As the environment grew uninhabitable, they went on to apply their incredible skills to devise a plan of retribution. This plan was said to be so ingenious that it would lead to the empire's eventual collapse.\\" Step 5: Offer a reason for the legend's existence \\"Believers of the legend argue that it is a reminder of the consequences faced by those who underestimate the power of a collective cause.

I’ll be honest, and admit that did we encounter a couple of challenging and scary situations – a truck driver changing lanes not allowing me enough time to enter a motorway (I luckily just popped into a shoulder lane), getting lost in the middle of Dallas skyscrapers (we jammed every device we had onto navigation), accidentally assuming a road was much narrower than it really was (luckily the road was relatively quiet so I just guided her nimbly over to the correct lane) and dodging some of the twits who pulled out in front of us – one with a trailer full of wood – but overall it really was fine.

The digestive system is the body system that digests food. It digest food in two ways, mechanically and chemically. Both help in the process of turning food into nutrients.

Clearly, clothes those street dancers wear show their personalities   and clothing styles. Now let us take a look at street dancers' clothing styles. Tops If you look into the clothing styles of street dancers, you will notice that there is a large difference between the tops that men and women wear. For men, they often wear a large T-shirt with probably a jacket at times. However, for women, they often wear tank tops (T) . Bottoms Today, the street dancers still prefer wearing large jeans and a lot of men also wear Capri pants  . However, women start to wear mini skirts or shorts. Nowadays knee-high socks are also a popular new look for the women. Footwear For any street dancer, shoes are important. Any pair of shoes that produces the slightest sound can destroy  the performance. So they need a pair of shoes that allows them to move freely. In fact, street dancers' clothing has to be something that allows for a lot of comfort   and that shows personalities. The two points are important for any street dancer.

A. sew  B. create art  C. express yourself  D. sing and dance  E. write  The best answer is A:","output":"The best answer to this question is indeed a matter of perspective, as everyone has unique talents and the term \\"creativity\\" can mean different things to different people. However, considering the options provided, the best answer is B. create art. To elaborate on why this answer may be the best, it's important to understand that creativity is an innate quality that everyone possesses. Artists, throughout history, have demonstrated an impressive ability to showcase their creative expression through various art forms. Whether it's painting, sculpting, drawing, or any other visual art, the ability to create art has often been regarded as a highly desirable skill that not many can master. Although all the options listed portray some level of creativity, creating art professionally requires a deeper commitment to honing one's skills and talents. Artists must have a strong sense of imagination, a natural inclination towards aesthetics, and a keen understanding of human emotions. By dedicating their time to create evocative and meaningful pieces of art, artists can make a lasting impact on society as a whole. Option A, sewing, is indeed a creative talent that many people possess. However, it is typically seen more as a craft, hobby, or necessary skill for daily life rather than a vocation that relies primarily on creative expression. Sewing can also be quite functional and not always considered an art form. Option C, expressing oneself, is a basic human need but is not always synonymous with making a living. While one could argue that being a public speaker, influencer, or life coach falls under this category, they are not always associated with creativity in the same way as those mentioned in creating art or writing. Option D, singing and dancing, can be considered creative professions for those exceptionally gifted in these areas. However, these talents are often seen as more related to performance arts rather than original creative output, as performers often interpret and share the creative work of others such as singers performing songs written by someone else or dancers performing choreographed pieces created by a choreographer. Option E, writing, is also a form of creative expression and plays a crucial role in educating, entertaining, and inspiring people. However, writing often requires a different set of skills, such as analytical and communication abilities. Furthermore, writing can encompass various styles and purposes, from technical and functional writings to fictional storytelling, which diversify the idea of creativity within the writing profession. In conclusion, while all these options show different aspects of creativity, creating art involves a higher level of self-expression and emotional exploration, allowing the artist to make a living by creating lasting, impactful work. Therefore, the best answer is B. create art."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant. User will you give you a task. Your goal is to complete the task as faithfully as you can.

Here is a goal: Make a book holder for children's books. How would you accomplish this goal?","output":"To accomplish the goal of making a book holder for children's books, you can follow these steps: 1. Ideation and Planning:  Before you start making the book holder, brainstorm some design ideas and think about what features and functionalities you would like it to have. For instance, do you want a simple open-shelf design, a closed cabinet, or one with compartments for different book sizes? Make sure your design is ergonomic, easily accessible by the child, and visually appealing. 2. Materials and Tools: Once you have a clear vision of what you want your book holder to look like, gather all the necessary materials and tools required. Some popular material choices include wood, plywood, MDF, or plastic. The tools needed may include a saw, screwdriver, hammer, measuring tape, level, pencil, drill, screws, wood glue, sandpaper, and a paintbrush or roller. 3. Measurements: Measure the space where you plan to place the book holder and decide on the dimensions based on the available area and the number of books you wish to store. Keep in mind children's height and accessibility while deciding the dimensions. 4. Cutting the Material: Following your plan, start by marking and cutting the material according to the desired dimensions. Make sure to use the appropriate saw and safety gear during this process. Cut all the necessary pieces such as shelves, sides, back, and top if applicable. 5. Sanding: Before assembling the pieces, it's essential to sand their edges and surfaces. This step helps create a smooth finish and avoid any rough edges that could be harmful to children. 6. Assembly: Lay out all the cut pieces and, following your design, begin assembling your book holder. You can use wood glue to attach the parts, screws to secure them, and a level to ensure the shelves are straight. If your design includes slots or dividers, install them now. If it has doors, attach them with hinges and add the handles. 7. Finishing touches: Inspect your assembled book holder for any imperfections, then sand as needed. Fill any gaps or holes with wood filler, smooth with a fine-grit sandpaper, and clean off any dust using a damp cloth. 8. Painting or Staining: Choose a paint or stain color that complements the room's decor and is safe for children. Apply a primer if needed, and then paint or stain the book holder following the manufacturer's instructions. You may need multiple coats to get the desired finish. Allow the paint or stain to dry completely. 9. Adding Personal Touches: You could further personalize the book holder by adding stickers, decals, or stencils that represent the child's interests. Another option is using chalkboard paint on one side, allowing the child to draw and write directly on the book holder. 10. Positioning and Organizing: Once the paint is dry, move the book holder to its designated spot and fill it with children's books. Organize the books by size, series, or favorite categories, making sure the most frequently used ones are easily accessible. By following these steps, you'll create a beautiful, functional, and safe book holder that encourages children to read and tidy up after themselves."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant that follows instruction extremely well.

I can use this background: Thermoclines, or sudden changes in temperature. Where the air temperature is higher than the water temperature, shallow water may be warmed by the air and the sunlight but deeper water remains cold resulting in a lowering of temperature as the diver descends. This temperature change may be concentrated over a small vertical interval, when it is called a thermocline.[3][4] Where cold, fresh water enters a warmer sea the fresh water may float over the denser saline water, so the temperature rises as the diver descends.[3] In lakes exposed to geothermal activity, the temperature of the deeper water may be warmer than the surface water. This will usually lead to convection currents.[3]  Now, I have a new situation: The underwater fishing teams picked their spots early. Team Bob went at the mouth of the river, where the freshwater met the salty seawater in the hope that more turbidity from the river and more nutrients will attract more fish. Team Dan went south where they knew there was less of a thermocline, so they could catch fish without taking risks.  Answer this question please: Which team had their crew members to fewer risks than necessary? A:","output":"Team Dan had their crew members exposed to fewer risks than necessary because they chose a location with less of a thermocline, allowing them to catch fish without encountering sudden changes in temperature. This makes their diving and fishing experience safer and more predictable than Team Bob, who were fishing at the mouth of the river where freshwater met the salty seawater, causing possible temperature changes and turbidity."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Group says it is disappointed with EU Commission's 'confrontational' approach. EU antitrust breaches can incur fines up to 10 per cent of global turnover.","output":"Title: Visa Europe Faces Regulatory Challenges Over Debit Card Fees Introduction Visa Europe, one of the leading payment processing companies, is under scrutiny as it grapples with the European Union regulators concerning its debit card fees. Although the company has tried to make amends by agreeing to certain terms, the recent confrontational approach by the European Commission has raised concerns among all stakeholders. Background Back in 2010, Visa Europe tried to address the issues surrounding its debit card fees by settling with regulators. By agreeing on various terms, the company hoped that it would avoid any more disputes about the charges that are imposed to millions of consumers who use their services. However, it seems that the situation is far from resolved, as the European Commission has recently adopted a more confrontational stance towards Visa Europe. Visa Europe's disappointment with the EU Commission Visa Europe has expressed its disappointment with the European Commission's confrontational approach towards their debit card fee policies. The company's representatives have argued that the aggressive stance of the regulatory body could potentially derail the progress made since the initial agreement in 2010. Moreover, Visa Europe believes that the efforts they have made to comply with the regulations have not been fully acknowledged by the regulators. EU antitrust breaches and potential fines When it comes to EU antitrust breaches, the stakes are high, as companies that violate these regulations can incur significant fines. In fact, charges can be as high as 10 per cent of their global turnover, which is by no means an insubstantial sum. Therefore, any organization, including Visa Europe, needs to take these regulations seriously and address the issues promptly and efficiently. The impact on consumers and businesses The ongoing tension between Visa Europe and the European Commission poses potential risks for consumers and businesses alike. As the payment processing landscape is continuously changing, it is essential that all stakeholders work together to promote a fair and transparent pricing environment. This would not only ensure the protection of consumer rights but also encourage healthy competition among payment processing companies. Looking ahead The dispute between Visa Europe and the European Commission regarding debit card fees highlights the complexities that arise in the modern financial landscape. On one hand, payment processing companies need to generate revenue to support their services; on the other hand, regulators must safeguard consumers and ensure fair competition among businesses. It is crucial that all parties involved, including the European regulatory bodies, try to collaborate on finding a balance that benefits everyone. Only then can the future of payment processing in Europe remain secure and promote innovation and efficiency within the industry. In the meantime, Visa Europe must continue to engage with regulators and demonstrate its commitment to providing transparent and fair services to its customers. Conclusion The ongoing regulatory challenges faced by Visa Europe is a testament to the dynamic nature of the financial and payment processing industry. With the European Commission adopting a confrontational approach, it is now crucial for both parties to find a mutually beneficial solution to ensure the continued growth and stability of the European payment processing market. Furthermore, striking a balance between revenue generation and consumer protection will likely be at the heart of any resolution concerning debit card fees."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Title: The Adventures of Tartu Movie plot: Screenshot depicting London during the Blitz in 1940 British Captain Terence Stevenson (Robert Donat) accepts an assignment even more dangerous than his everyday wartime job of defusing unexploded bombs. Fluent in Romanian and German and having studied chemical engineering, he is parachuted into Romania to assume the identity of Captain Jan Tartu, a member of the fascist Iron Guard. He makes his way to Czechoslovakia to steal the formula of a new Nazi poison gas and sabotage the chemical plant where it is being manufactured. However, his contact is arrested before he can arrange for a job in the factory. Tartu is instead assigned work as a foreman at a munitions factory, where he is issued a German uniform. He is billeted in the house of Anna Palacek (Phyllis Morris) and her daughter Pavla (Glynis Johns), who works in the plant; also living there are German Inspector Otto Vogel (Walter Rilla) and the lovely Maruschuka Lanova (Valerie Hobson), who lives well by making herself popular with the German officers. That day Pavla shoots a German who earlier had had the man she loved executed. Tartu provides her with an alibi, winning her trust, and then reveals himself as a secret agent. Needing to get into the chemical plant, he asks her help to contact the Czech underground, and is surprised when she contrives for him and Maruschuka to go on a date. They talk guardedly but make it clear they are both working against the Nazis. At work the next day, Pavla is seen attempting sabotage. She whispers to Tartu to protect himself by denouncing her. He does, and she is summarily executed. The factory manager rewards Tartu by arranging the transfer he wants, to the chemical plant. The same day, Maruschuka contacts Dr. Novotny (Martin Miller), the leader of the local resistance group, and says she trusts Tartu.

The fundamental principle underlying this view is that older political and mental structures exist which exercise greater influence on the spatial-social identity of individuals than is understood by the contemporary world, bound to and often blinded by its own worldview - e.g. the focus on the nation-state. Definitions of regions vary, and regions can include macroregions such as Europe, territories of traditional states, or smaller microregional areas. A geographic proximity is the often required precondition for emergence of a regional identity. In Europe the regional identities are often derived from the Migration Period, but for the contemporary perspective are related to the 1918-1920 time of territorial transformation, and another in the post-Cold War period.  - France, officially the French Republic, is a country with territory in western Europe and several overseas regions and territories.

Carbon dioxide is known as a greenhouse gas , since it lets in light energy but does not let heat escape, much like the panes of a greenhouse. The increase of greenhouse gasses in the atmosphere is contributing to a global rise in Earth’s temperature, known as global warming or global climate change.  I am facing a new situation today: Greg is an environmental scientist. He wants to know how earth's atmosphere differed in two different time. To that end, he selected two time periods, time A and time B. Time A is set in the year one thousand when using fossil fuels was not very common. Time B is set in the year two thousand when fossil fuels are used in large quantities.  Using the knowledge I acquired from the background article, how should I answer correctly the following question regarding my new situation: In which time more carbon dioxide would be realeased into the atmosphere, time A or time B? The answer to this question is:","output":"Time B would have more carbon dioxide released into the atmosphere compared to Time A. This is due to the increased usage of fossil fuels in the year 2000 (Time B) as opposed to the year 1000 (Time A), when the burning of fossil fuels was not very common. The extensive use of fossil fuels, such as coal, oil, and natural gas, during Time B has led to a significant increase in carbon dioxide emissions. These emissions are a result of human activities, including industrialization, transportation, and energy production. In contrast, during Time A, human activities were primarily based on agriculture and had minimal impact on carbon dioxide levels in the atmosphere. The burning of fossil fuels in Time B releases more carbon dioxide into the atmosphere than is absorbed by processes like photosynthesis. This additional carbon dioxide acts as a greenhouse gas, trapping heat and contributing to the observed increase in global temperatures, known as global warming or global climate change. As a result, Time B has a greater release of carbon dioxide into the atmosphere, leading to more significant climate change impacts compared to Time A."},{"instruction":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

By 2012,the world may need to cope with as many as 50 million people who have fled their homeland,not for political or economic reasons but because the environment has been so badly changed that it cannot support life. The statement has been released by the United Nations to mark UN Disaster Reduction Day. More people are made homeless by environmental disasters than by war,according to the research by the Red Cross. That reality is proved by the earthquake in Pakistan. The widely publicized disaster has brought aid from the global community,according to Janos Bogardi,director of the United Nations University Institute for Environment and Human Security. \\"If we can move swiftly in and give them a new start where they are,then they may stay in the area. Otherwise,they become environmental refugees. Environmentalrelated migrations are most acute in SubSaharan Africa,but they also affect millions of people in Asia and India. Meanwhile,the United States is witnessing increased pressure from victims of mismanaged and worsening soil and water conditions in Mexico and Latin America.\\" he says. Janos Bogardi says these refugees suffer from the impact of gradual environmental change--global warming,sea level rise,air and water pollution and more intense storms,floods and droughts that degrade the land. This is a slow process,but unfortunately a process that is very difficult to go backwards once final damage is done. Janos Bogardi says they are calling on the global community to recognize the serious situation of environmental refugees and to work together to lessen the impact of environmental disaster. What may be the best title of the passage? A) 50 Million environmental refugees by 2010 B) Environmental refugees--an international problem C) The cause of environmental disasters D) Global aid pouring in Answer:","output":"B) Environmental refugees--an international problem"},{"instruction":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

Information:  - The Marxophone is a fretless zither with a system of metal hammers added for ease of playing . It features two octaves of double melody strings in the key of C major ( middle C to C '' ) , and four sets of chord strings ( C major , G major , F major , and D7 ) . Sounding somewhat like a mandolin , the Marxophone 's timbre is also reminiscent of various types of hammered dulcimers . The player typically strums the chords with the left hand . The right hand plays the melody strings by depressing spring steel strips that hold small lead hammers over the strings . A brief stab on a metal strip bounces the hammer off a string pair to produce a single note . Holding the strip down makes the hammer bounce on the double strings , which produces a mandolin - like tremolo . The bounce rate is somewhat fixed , as it is based on the spring steel strip length , hammer weight , and string tension -- but a player can increase the rate slightly by pressing higher on the strip , effectively moving its pivot point closer to the lead hammer . Numerically coded sheet music prepared specifically for the Marxophone indicates when and in what order to play melody and chord strings . This type of music , similar to tablature , was produced for those who could not read standard notation . A rectangular piece of metal provides a backstop for the spring steel hammers , displays the name Marxophone and the patent number , and has clips that hold sheet music . It also marks the 15 keys by letter ( C , D , etc. ) , by number ( 1 - 15 ) and in standard musical notation . When the instrument is moved or stored , the metal rectangle bends down , holding the keys against the strings , so the Marxophone can fit into its case -- which is the size of a large briefcase .  - A plectrum is a small flat tool used to pluck or strum a stringed instrument. For hand-held instruments such as guitars and mandolins, the plectrum is often called a pick, and is a separate tool held in the player's hand. In harpsichords, the plectra are attached to the jack mechanism.  - Music is an art form and cultural activity whose medium is sound and silence, which exist in time. The common elements of music are pitch (which governs melody and harmony), rhythm (and its associated concepts tempo, meter, and articulation), dynamics (loudness and softness), and the sonic qualities of timbre and texture (which are sometimes termed the \\"color\\" of a musical sound). Different styles or types of music may emphasize, de-emphasize or omit some of these elements. Music is performed with a vast range of instruments and vocal techniques ranging from singing to rapping; there are solely instrumental pieces, solely vocal pieces (such as songs without instrumental accompaniment) and pieces that combine singing and instruments. The word derives from Greek  (\\"mousike\\"; \\"art of the Muses\\"). In its most general form, the activities describing music as an art form include the production of works of music (songs, tunes, symphonies, and so on), the criticism of music, the study of the history of music, and the aesthetic examination of music. Ancient Greek and Indian philosophers defined music as tones ordered horizontally as melodies and vertically as harmonies. Common sayings such as \\"the harmony of the spheres\\" and \\"it is music to my ears\\" point to the notion that music is often ordered and pleasant to listen to. However, 20th-century composer John Cage thought that any sound can be music, saying, for example, \\"There is no noise, only sound.\\"  - F major (or the key of F) is a major scale based on F, with the pitches F, G, A, B, C, D, and E. Its key signature has one flat, B.  - A soprano is a type of classical female singing voice and has the highest vocal range of all voice types. The soprano's vocal range (using scientific pitch notation) is from approximately middle C (C) = 261 Hz to \\"high A\\" (A) =880 Hz in choral music, or to \\"soprano C\\" (C, two octaves above middle C) =1046 Hz or higher in operatic music. In four-part chorale style harmony, the soprano takes the highest part, which usually encompasses the melody.  The soprano voice type is generally divided into the coloratura, soubrette, lyric, spinto, and dramatic soprano. The lyric soprano is the most common female singing voice.  - Mandobass is the largest (and least common) member of the mandolin family, sometimes used as the bass instrument in mandolin orchestras. It is so large that it usually isn't held in the lap, but supported on a spike which rests on the floor. The neck-scale length on a full-size mando-bass is similar to that of a standard orchestral double bass viol: about 43\\" (110 cm). The instrument is otherwise similar to the smaller, higher-pitched members of the mandolin family, having a fretted neck, a headstock with geared tuning machines, and a large resonating body oftenbut not alwaysshaped like that of other mandolins.  - Lute can refer generally to any string instrument having the strings running in a plane parallel to the sound table (in the HornbostelSachs system), more specifically to any plucked string instrument with a neck (either fretted or unfretted) and a deep round back, or more specifically to an instrument from the family of European lutes.  - In music, unison is two or more musical parts sounding the same pitch or at an octave interval, usually at the same time.  - C major (or the key of C) is a major scale based on C, with the pitches C, D, E, F, G, A, and B. Its key signature has no flats and no sharps.  - The harp is a stringed musical instrument which has a number of individual strings running at an angle to its soundboard, which are plucked with the fingers. Harps have been known since antiquity in Asia, Africa, and Europe, dating back at least as early as 3500 BC. The instrument had great popularity in Europe during the Middle Ages and Renaissance, where it evolved into a wide range of variants with new technologies, and was disseminated to Europe's colonies, finding particular popularity in Latin America. While some ancient members of the harp family died out in the Near East and South Asia, descendants of early harps are still played in Burma and in Sub-Saharan Africa, while other defunct variants in Europe and Asia have been revived by musicians in the modern era.  - The mandocello is a plucked string instrument of the mandolin family. It has eight strings in four paired courses, tuned in fifths like a mandolin, but is larger, and tuned CC-GG-dd-aa (low to high in pitch). It can be described as being to the mandolin what the cello is to the violin.  - G major (or the key of G) is a major scale based on G, with the pitches G, A, B, C, D, E, and F. Its key signature has one sharp, F.  - The mandola (US and Canada) or tenor mandola (Ireland and UK) is a fretted, stringed musical instrument. It is to the mandolin what the viola is to the violin: the four double courses of strings tuned in fifths to the same pitches as the viola (C-G-D-A low-to-high), a fifth lower than a mandolin. The mandola, although now rarer, is the ancestor of the mandolin, the name of which means simply \\"little mandola\\".  - The major scale or Ionian scale is one of the most commonly used musical scales, especially in Western music. It is one of the diatonic scales. Like many musical scales it is made up of seven notes: the eighth duplicates the first at double its frequency so that it is called a higher octave of the same note (from Latin \\"octavus\\", the eighth).  - In musical notation, a key signature is a set of sharp, flat, and rarely, natural symbols placed together on the staff. Key signatures are generally written immediately after the clef at the beginning of a line of musical notation, although they can appear in other parts of a score, notably after a double barline.  - The cello (; plural cellos or celli) or violoncello is a bowed string instrument with four strings tuned in perfect fifths. The strings from low to high are generally tuned to C, G, D and A, an octave lower than the viola. It is a member of the violin family of musical instruments, which also includes the violin and viola.  - A mandolin (; literally \\"small mandola\\") is a musical instrument in the lute family and is usually plucked with a plectrum or \\"pick\\". It commonly has four courses of doubled metal strings tuned in unison (8 strings), although five (10 strings) and six (12 strings) course versions also exist. The courses are normally tuned in a succession of perfect fifths. It is the soprano member of a family that includes the mandola, octave mandolin, mandocello and mandobass.  - The octave mandolin is a fretted string instrument with four pairs of strings tuned in fifths, G, D, A, E (low to high), an octave below a mandolin. It has a 20 to 23-inch scale length and its construction is similar to other instruments in the mandolin family. Usually the courses are all unison pairs but the lower two may sometimes be strung as octave pairs with the higher-pitched octave string on top so that it is hit before the thicker lower-pitched string. Alternate tunings of G, D, A, D and A, D, A, D are often employed by Celtic musicians.    What is the relationship between 'marxophone' and 'plucked string instrument'?","output":"The relationship between the Marxophone and plucked string instruments lies in the fact that they are both types of stringed musical instruments. However, the way they produce sound and the mechanisms involved in playing them differ significantly. The Marxophone is a fretless zither with a system of metal hammers added for ease of playing. It features two octaves of double melody strings in the key of C major, and four sets of chord strings. The player typically strums the chords with the left hand, while the right hand plays the melody strings by depressing spring steel strips that hold small lead hammers over the strings. The hammers bounce off the strings to produce the Marxophone's unique sound, which is somewhat similar to a mandolin and various types of hammered dulcimers. On the other hand, plucked string instruments are a class of musical instruments where strings are plucked using fingers, fingernails, or a plectrum. Examples of plucked string instruments include guitars, mandolins, ukuleles, and harps. In these instruments, sound is produced when the strings vibrate after being plucked. In summary, the Marxophone and plucked string instruments are both stringed musical instruments, but they have different approaches to creating sound. The Marxophone uses a hammer mechanism to strike the strings, whereas plucked string instruments involve directly plucking the strings with fingers or a plectrum."},{"instruction":"Facts:   - residence: san francisco , california , united states    - spouse: fatema akhund -lrb- 2009 -- present -rrb-    - occupation: internet entrepreneur      - education: computer science    - children: aniya sophia akhund -lrb- born 2011 -rrb-    - birth date: 16 april 1984    - name: immad akhund    - ethnicity: pakistani    - nationality: british    - birth place: karachi , pakistan    - religion: islam    - alma mater: clare college university of cambridge   Based on these bullet points, write a short biography describing the life of immad akhund .","output":"Immad Akhund is a prominent British internet entrepreneur who hails from Pakistani ethnicity.

What is the name of the drilling fluid that is significantly more expensive than untreated petroleum fuels?  Answer the above question based on the context below:  Drilling fluids are necessary for borehole stability in deep cores, and can also be used to circulate cuttings away from the bit.  Fluids used include water, ethanol/water and water/ethylene glycol mixtures, petroleum fuels, non-aromatic hydrocarbons, and n-butyl acetate. Water is the cheapest and cleanest option; it may be present on the glacial surface or may be created by thermal drilling.  In cold ice some form of antifreeze is necessary, or heat must be reapplied by reaming the hole periodically. Ethanol and water.  Ethanol acts as an anti-freeze in water; at sufficient concentrations it can reduce the freezing temperature of the mixture to well below any temperature likely to be encountered in ice drilling.  The concentration must be chosen to prevent the liquid freezing and also to maintain the borehole against the ice overburden pressure.  Because the density of the mixture decreases with lower temperatures, vertical convection will develop in boreholes where temperatures decrease with depth, as the lighter mixture rises.  This causes slush to form in the borehole, though successful drilling is still possible.  Ethanol is one of the cheapest options for a drilling fluid, and requires less storage space than other options because in use it is diluted with water.  A Soviet expedition left an 800 m borehole in Antarctica filled with ethanol and water at an ice temperature of −53 °C; after 11 months the borehole remained open and drilling was resumed with no problems.  A problem with this option is that the mixture will penetrate cores that have cracks. Ethylene glycol and water was used at Camp Century in 1966 in the lower part of the hole to dissolve the cuttings. Petroleum fuels.  This includes diesel, jet fuel, and kerosene. They are inexpensive and easily available, and were once in common use; disadvantages include flammability and the aromatics they contain, which are a health hazard. Non-aromatic hydrocarbons.

It was so tall that it touched the sky. People from all over the world came to see this amazing building and to work in it. One day, something very naughty happened. Four grown-up men decided to do something they were not supposed to do. They put on special backpacks called parachutes and climbed to the top of the World Trade Center. A parachute is a big piece of cloth that is attached to ropes and a backpack. When people jump off a high place and open the parachute, it helps them gently float down to the ground, just like a feather. Now, jumping off a building with a parachute is very dangerous and against the rules, but these men didn't care about that. They jumped off the building and floated down to the ground using their parachutes. Some people saw them, and they were very surprised. They told the people in charge, called authorities, and these men got in big trouble. The authorities found out who these men were, and they arrested them. That means they took them to a place where people go when they break the rules, so they can be taught a lesson and understand that what they did was wrong. Now all the kids can remember this story, and when they grow up, they will know that it's important to follow rules and stay safe, so they don't get in trouble like these four men did.

The given equation is 65 = 14v + 23. To isolate the term with the variable v, subtract 23 from both sides of the equation: 65 - 23 = 14v + 23 - 23 This simplifies to: 42 = 14v Step 2: Divide both sides of the equation by 14. Now that the term with the variable v is isolated, divide both sides of the equation by 14 to solve for the value of v: 42 ÷ 14 = 14v ÷ 14 This simplifies to: 3 = v So, the solution for the given equation 65 = 14v + 23 is v = 3."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Bradley Manning verdict: guilty on most charges but not on 'aiding the enemy' - live updates Colonel Denise Lind, the military judge presiding over the court martial of the US soldier, delivered her verdict in curt and pointed language, writes Ed Pilkington from Fort Meade: “Guilty, guilty, guilty, guilty,” she repeated over and over, as the reality of a prolonged prison sentence for Manning on top of the three years he has already spent in detention dawned. The one ray of light in an otherwise bleak outcome for the Army private was that he was found not guilty of the single most serious charge against him - that he knowingly “aided the enemy”, in practice al-Qaida, by disclosing information to the WikiLeaks website that in turn made it accessible to all users including enemy groups. Lind’s decision to avoid setting a precedent by applying the swingeing “aiding the enemy” charge to an official leaker will invoke a sigh of relief from news organisations and civil liberties groups who had feared a guilty verdict would send a chill across public interest journalism. Lind also found Manning not guilty of having leaked an encrypted copy of a video of a US airstrike in the Farah province of Aghanistan in which many civilians died. Manning’s defence team had argued vociferously that he was not the source of this video, though the soldier did admit to later disclosure of an unencrypted version of the video and related documents. The judge also accepted Manning’s version of several of the key dates in the WikiLeaks disclosures, and took off some of the edge from other less serious charges. But the overriding toughness of the verdict remains: the soldier was found guilty in their entirety of 17 out of the 22 counts against him, and of an amended version of four more. Once the counts are cumulatively added up, the prospects for the Army private are bleak. Barring reduction of sentence for mitigation, which becomes the subject of another mini-trial dedicated to sentencing that starts tomorrow, he will face a substantial chunk of his adult life in military custody. The consequences for Manning, and for the wider world of whistleblowing and official leaking in the digital age, will take time to sink in. Write a one or two sentence summary.","output":"Bradley Manning was found guilty on most charges but acquitted of the most serious charge, 'aiding the enemy,' in a military trial presided over by Colonel Denise Lind.

Given the question: Given the background: Most ants are generalist predators, scavengers, and indirect herbivores, but a few have evolved specialised ways of obtaining nutrition. It is believed that many ant species that engage in indirect herbivory rely on specialized symbiosis with their gut microbes to upgrade the nutritional value of the food they collect and allow them to survive in nitrogen poor regions, such as rainforest canopies. Leafcutter ants (Atta and Acromyrmex) feed exclusively on a fungus that grows only within their colonies. They continually collect leaves which are taken to the colony, cut into tiny pieces and placed in fungal gardens. Ergates specialise in related tasks according to their sizes. The largest ants cut stalks, smaller workers chew the leaves and the smallest tend the fungus. Leafcutter ants are sensitive enough to recognise the reaction of the fungus to different plant material, apparently detecting chemical signals from the fungus. If a particular type of leaf is found to be toxic to the fungus, the colony will no longer collect it. The ants feed on structures produced by the fungi called gongylidia. Symbiotic bacteria on the exterior surface of the ants produce antibiotics that kill bacteria introduced into the nest that may harm the fungi.  and the situation: Bess and Dee were two entomologists. they were studying ants. Dee liked to learn more about leaf cutter ants, while Bess learned all she could about all other ants.  Answer the following question: Which person read more about ants which build fungal gardens? The answer is:","output":"Dee read more about ants which build fungal gardens. This is because Dee focused on learning more about leafcutter ants (Atta and Acromyrmex), which are known to feed exclusively on a fungus that grows only within their colonies. These ants are responsible for building fungal gardens by collecting leaves, cutting them into tiny pieces, and placing them in the gardens to cultivate fungus as their food source. Bess, on the other hand, learned about all other ants in general, and her study might not be focused on the ants that build fungal gardens as much as Dee's."},{"instruction":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

The proud parents-to-be were all smiles as they made their way down the carpet. But the actor, 37, only had eyes for his leading lady — and once we saw the mom-to-be’s fitted, floor-length frock we knew why. Lively, 27, showed off her growing bump in a beautiful butter-hued gown from Gucci’s Resort 2015 collection, complete with a plunging embellished neckline. And while the Preserve founder accessorized with Lorraine Schwartz jewels, it was her gorgeous glow that really took her evening look to another level. On Thursday, Lively told PEOPLE she’s having to switch up her pregnancy ensembles to accommodate her growing bump. “Have you seen me!?” she joked. “I’m gonna amp up my style by wearing things that are stretchier — because that’s all that fits!” Although the couple haven’t announced whether they’re expecting a baby girl or boy, Reynolds already has a few names in mind. “I don’t want a name that’s anything pretentious or, like, Hollywood-y.

The sporf is no innovation; back in 1940 the \\"sporf\\" was born. It took me until 2015 to notice this one thanks to its rather pleasant design. The sporf is a little like most strategy documents that I come across.

With the sporf, things would get messy trying to use the spoon and knife and the same time. The knife and fork work quite well in sequence but physics prevents me using both at the same time as I can with the older technologies of knife and fork.

Although research has been inconclusive, some findings have indicated that electronic communication negatively affects adolescents' social development, replaces face-to-face communication, impairs their social skills, and can sometimes lead to unsafe interaction with strangers. A 2015 review reported that “adolescents lack awareness of strategies to cope with cyberbullying, which has been consistently associated with an increased likelihood of depression.” Studies have shown differences in the ways the internet negatively impacts the adolescents' social functioning. Online socializing tends to make girls particularly vulnerable, while socializing in Internet cafés seems only to affect boys academic achievement. However, other research suggests that Internet communication brings friends closer and is beneficial for socially anxious teens, who find it easier to interact socially online. The more conclusive finding has been that Internet use has a negative effect on the physical health of adolescents, as time spent using the Internet replaces time doing physical activities.

They lay eggs that can be fertilized either inside or outside of the body. In most fish, the eggs develop outside of the mother's body. In the majority of these species, fertilization also takes place outside the mother's body. The male and female fish release their gametes into the surrounding water, where fertilization occurs. Female fish release very high numbers of eggs to increase the chances of fertilization.  Paragraph: Two different rivers were stocked with adult fish. Red river had a lower fish population because the fish had hardly reproduced naturally. Black river had doubled it's fish population in two years because they reproduced naturally.  Given the paragraph above, please answer correctly the following question: Which of the two rivers had fewer fish lay eggs outside of the body? Answer:","output":"Based on the information provided, it cannot be determined which of the two rivers had fewer fish lay eggs outside of the body. The difference in fish population could be due to other factors such as differing environmental conditions, availability of food resources, or reproductive success rates after the eggs have been laid. Therefore, it is not possible to conclude which river had fewer fish lay eggs outside of the body."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant. User will you give you a task.

Is India constantly supporting the people of Baluchistan for gaining freedom from Pakistan? How can India help Balochistan in order to get freedom from Pakistan and their tyranny? OPT: 1). no. 2). yes.","output":"1) In order to determine if these questions have the same meaning, let's analyze both questions step-by-step: - The first question asks if India is currently and consistently supporting the people of Baluchistan in their quest for independence from Pakistan. This question specifically focuses on whether this support is constant and ongoing. - The second question asks how India can assist Balochistan in achieving freedom from Pakistan and its oppressive regime. This question is more focused on potential ways India could support Balochistan, rather than determining if the existing support is constant like the first question. Based on our analysis, we can see that while both questions are related to India's support for Baluchistan's independence, they do not have the exact same meaning. The first question is about the consistency of the support, while the second question focuses on exploring potential ways for that support. So, the appropriate answer is: 1).

Larger pieces, like belt buckles, may need up to ten. All the sprues should meet at the same place. They will need to be attached to a sprue base. The sprues all meet together, and you attach the mold to the sprue base where all the sprues meet. This allows the wax to melt through the bottom of the base and leave the mold.

Victoria marked the fiftieth anniversary of her accession on 20 June with a banquet to which 50 kings and princes were invited. The following day, she participated in a procession and attended a thanksgiving service in Westminster Abbey. By this time, Victoria was once again extremely popular. Two days later on 23 June, she engaged two Indian Muslims as waiters, one of whom was Abdul Karim. He was soon promoted to \\"Munshi\\": teaching her Hindustani, and acting as a clerk. Her family and retainers were appalled, and accused Abdul Karim of spying for the Muslim Patriotic League, and biasing the Queen against the Hindus. Equerry Frederick Ponsonby (the son of Sir Henry) discovered that the Munshi had lied about his parentage, and reported to Lord Elgin, Viceroy of India, \\"the Munshi occupies very much the same position as John Brown used to do.\\" Victoria dismissed their complaints as racial prejudice.

Please briefly summarize this news article: No. 20 Lady Vols need to regroup quickly after stunning loss or risk falling out of Top 25 In Tennessee's first season without Pat Summitt, the Lady Vols soon could drop out of the Top 25 for the first time in over a quarter-century. The No. 20 Lady Vols began the post-Summitt era Friday with a stunning 80-71 loss at Chattanooga. Now they don't have much time to recover from their first season-opening loss since 1999, as they continue their road trip Sunday at No. 22 Georgia Tech. A loss to the Yellow Jackets likely would drop the Lady Vols out of the Top 25 for the first time since February 1985. \\"That's just the nature of this game and the nature of our schedule,\\" said Tennessee coach Holly Warlick, who stumbled out of the gate in her head coaching debut after spending the last 27 seasons as an assistant on Summitt's staff. \\"It's extremely hard. With five new players, it is what it is. There's nothing we can do about it. We've got to roll up our sleeves and get back to work.\\" Summitt, who announced last year she had early-onset dementia, stepped down in April after collecting 1,098 wins, eight national titles and 18 Final Four appearances in 38 seasons. Summitt remains on staff as head coach emeritus, attends most of the Lady Vols' practice and watched Friday's game from the stands. The transition figured to cause some growing pains. Tennessee's No. 20 preseason ranking was its lowest position in the Top 25 since 1985. The Lady Vols don't return a single player who started an NCAA tournament game last season during their run to a regional final. Their roster includes five newcomers - four freshmen and a junior-college transfer. But nobody expected this kind of start. Tennessee committed 26 turnovers and had only six assists against Chattanooga. The Lady Vols had 17 turnovers in the first half alone. They never led in the second half and never cut Chattanooga's advantage below six points over the last 13 minutes. \\"We have to learn from this,\\" said Tennessee junior guard Meighan Simmons, one of only three upperclassmen on the roster. The biggest lessons came when Tennessee was on defense. Tennessee spent the preseason adjusting to an uptempo style designed to utilize Tennessee's speed and compensate for its relative lack of size. The Lady Vols believed their energy would harass opposing offenses and force turnovers. \\"We're not going to outscore anybody,\\" Warlick said. \\"We're not going to outshoot them. We've got to get them to turn the ball over to get easy looks.\\" While Tennessee struggled to take care of the ball all night, Chattanooga collected 17 assists and committed only 13 turnovers. The Lady Mocs scored 52 points and shot 56.3 percent from the floor in the second half. \\"Our defense was non-existent,\\" Warlick said. That defense will have to play much better for the Lady Vols to avoid their first 0-2 start since 1970. Georgia Tech went 26-8 and reached a regional semifinal last year and should get an emotional lift Sunday from playing the first women's game at the new McCamish Pavilion. The Yellow Jackets had to play their home games off campus last season. \\"As long as we learn from this, it's OK,\\" Warlick said. \\"If we keep making the same mistakes, we're not going to get any better.\\" There's one history lesson that could encourage Tennessee. When the Lady Vols last dropped a season opener back in 1999, they lost only three more times the rest of the season and went on to reach the NCAA final.","output":"The Lady Vols, a girls basketball team, lost a game against another team called Chattanooga. This is their first season without their famous coach, Pat Summitt. They are now ranked number 20 and if they lose their next game against the Yellow Jackets, they might fall out of the Top 25. Their new coach, Holly Warlick, thinks they need to work hard and improve. They made many mistakes in their last game, and they need to play better defense. If they learn from their mistakes, they can get better and hopefully win more games in the future."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant. You will be given a task.

A:","output":"To answer the elaborate question regarding the passing of two renowned composers, Richard Strauss and Béla Bartók, we must first delve into the respective life stories and backgrounds of these two extraordinary musicians in order to understand their historical context, contributions to the world of music, and the events leading up to their deaths. Richard Strauss was a German composer, conductor, and pianist born on June 11, 1864, in Munich, Germany. He was an influential figure in the late Romantic and early Modern periods, known primarily for his remarkable skill in orchestration and his versatility in composing music across various genres, including opera, tone poems, chamber music, and lieder. Some of his most famous works include the operas \\"Salome\\" and \\"Der Rosenkavalier,\\" and the tone poems \\"Don Juan\\" and \\"Also sprach Zarathustra,\\" the latter of which was famously used in the opening scene of Stanley Kubrick's film, \\"2001: A Space Odyssey.\\" Béla Bartók, born on March 25, 1881, in Nagyszentmiklós, Hungary (now Sânnicolau Mare, Romania), was a Hungarian composer and pianist who was a prominent figure in the early 20th century, immersed in the realms of both musical composition and ethnomusicology. Known for his fusion of Eastern European folk music and traditional classical music, Bartók's contributions continue to be regarded as some of the most unique and influential in the contemporary classical repertoire. His work reflects a deep understanding of the innovations of that era, such as the twelve-tone technique and the rise of atonality. Some of Bartók's most celebrated compositions include the six string quartets, the piano concertos, and the orchestral suite \\"The Miraculous Mandarin.\\" Now, equipped with the relevant contextual information, we can explore the events leading up to the passing of these two prominent composers. Richard Strauss's later years were marked by a number of challenges, both personal and professional. World War II and the rise of the Nazi regime cast a shadow over Strauss' life. His granddaughter's Jewish heritage further complicated matters, causing him distress in his final years. Despite these difficulties, Strauss continued to compose until his final days. He passed away on September 8, 1949, in Garmisch-Partenkirchen, Germany, at the age of 85. His final works bore a more introspective quality, such as the \\"Four Last Songs,\\" which poignantly reflect themes of death and transition. Béla Bartók's later years were also fraught with hardship and struggle. His staunch opposition to the Nazi regime compelled him to emigrate to the United States in 1940. Once in America, however, he found it difficult to establish himself professionally and faced financial troubles. Additionally, his health began to deteriorate—a diagnosis of leukemia would eventually be revealed. Despite these complications, Bartók remained productive; the final years of his life saw the completion of several important works, such as the \\"Concerto for Orchestra\\" and the \\"Third Piano Concerto.\\" His condition finally caught up with him, and Béla Bartók passed away on September 26, 1945, in New York City, at the age of 64. In summary, it becomes clear that Béla Bartók passed away first, on September 26, 1945, followed by Richard Strauss about four years later, on September 8, 1949. While both composers experienced hardships in their twilight years, their legacies continue to influence the world of classical music and provide inspiration to generations of musicians and listeners alike."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Plot title: Crack in the World Movie plot: An international consortium of scientists, operating as Project Inner Space in Tanganyika, Africa, is trying to tap into the Earth's geothermal energy by drilling a very deep hole down to the Earth's core. The scientists are foiled by an extremely dense layer of material at the boundary between the two. To penetrate the barrier and reach the magma below, they intend to detonate an atomic device at the bottom of the hole. The leader of the project, Dr. Stephen Sorenson (Dana Andrews), who is secretly dying of cancer, believes that the atomic device will burn its way through the barrier, but the project's chief geologist, Dr. Ted Rampion (Kieron Moore), is convinced that the lower layers of the crust have been weakened by decades of underground nuclear tests, and that the detonation could produce a massive crack that would threaten the very existence of Earth. The atomic device is used and Rampion's fears prove justified, as the crust of the Earth develops an enormous crack that progresses rapidly. Sorenson discovers that there was a huge reservoir of hydrogen underground, which turned the small conventional atomic explosion into a huge thermonuclear one that was millions of times more powerful. Another atomic device is used in the hope of stopping the crack, but it only reverses the crack's direction. Eventually the crack returns to its starting point at the test site, and a huge chunk of the planet outlined by the crack is expected to be thrown out into space.

(CNN) -- England midfielder Michael Carrick missed a first-half penalty as English Premier League champions Manchester United suffered a sensational 1-0 defeat at newly promoted Burnley. Michael Carrick misses his first-half penalty as Manchester United slumped to a stunning defeat at Burnley. The home side scored the only goal of the game in the 19th minute when Stephen Jordan's deep cross for Martin Paterson was headed away by United full-back Patrice Evra -- only for Robbie Blake to meet the ball on the volley and fire a spectacular shot into the top corner. United pressed hard for an equalizer and wasted a golden opportunity just before the end of the half when Blake turned from hero to villian by tripping Evra in the penalty area.

Please answer the following question: The following article contains an answer for the question: What is the specific Welsh name of that which takes the form of a dialogue between Arthur and the gatekeeper of a fortress he wishes to enter, in which Arthur recounts the names and deeds of himself and his men, notably Cei (Kay) and Bedwyr (Bedivere)? , can you please find it?   Other early Welsh Arthurian texts include a poem found in the Black Book of Carmarthen, \\"Pa gur yv y porthaur?\\" (\\"What man is the gatekeeper?\\"). This takes the form of a dialogue between Arthur and the gatekeeper of a fortress he wishes to enter, in which Arthur recounts the names and deeds of himself and his men, notably Cei (Kay) and Bedwyr (Bedivere). The Welsh prose tale Culhwch and Olwen (c. 1100), included in the modern Mabinogion collection, has a much longer list of more than 200 of Arthur's men, though Cei and Bedwyr again take a central place. The story as a whole tells of Arthur helping his kinsman Culhwch win the hand of Olwen, daughter of Ysbaddaden Chief-Giant, by completing a series of apparently impossible tasks, including the hunt for the great semi-divine boar Twrch Trwyth. The 9th-century Historia Brittonum also refers to this tale, with the boar there named Troy(n)t. Finally, Arthur is mentioned numerous times in the Welsh Triads, a collection of short summaries of Welsh tradition and legend which are classified into groups of three linked characters or episodes to assist recall. The later manuscripts of the Triads are partly derivative from Geoffrey of Monmouth and later continental traditions, but the earliest ones show no such influence and are usually agreed to refer to pre-existing Welsh traditions. Even in these, however, Arthur's court has started to embody legendary Britain as a whole, with \\"Arthur's Court\\" sometimes substituted for \\"The Island of Britain\\" in the formula \\"Three XXX of the Island of Britain\\". While it is not clear from the Historia Brittonum and the Annales Cambriae that Arthur was even considered a king, by the time Culhwch and Olwen and the Triads were written he had become Penteyrnedd yr Ynys hon, \\"Chief of the Lords of this Island\\", the overlord of Wales, Cornwall and the North.In addition to these pre-Galfridian Welsh poems and tales, Arthur appears in some other early Latin texts besides the Historia Brittonum and the Annales Cambriae.

(October 2014) Jacob is a young man who defends his town from evil forces, aided by a magic sword. He saves a girl called Sarah from a horde of the reanimated dead, and they escape through the floor of a church. An evil necromancer named Mathias confronts Sarah and demands an amulet given to her by her uncle before he died. Sarah refuses, and after threatening to unleash all the evils he can conjure, Mathias disappears. In the morning, Sarah and Jacob return to Sarah's house through streets, fields, churches and underground tunnels, pursued by hordes of demonic creatures. They arrive around midday to find Mathias is already there, holding a sword to Sarah's little sister Jill's throat. Mathias threatens to kill Jill unless Sarah gives him the amulet. Sarah makes Mathias promise he will let Jill go, and gives him the amulet. Mathias disappears with both Jill and the necklace, and Sarah begs Jacob to go save Jill from Mathias. Jacob reluctantly agrees. Jacob arrives at Sarah's dead uncle's house and fights Mathias. He manages to destroy the amulet, defeating Mathias, but Jill falls through a hole in the floor. Jacob dives after her and breaks her fall with his own body, unharmed himself because he cannot die due to a protection spell that Sarah's uncle cast before he died. They return to Jill's home. Her mother and her sister Sarah are dead, killed by the reanimated dead while Jacob was not there to protect them. Jacob returns to Sarah's uncle's house to find Mathias reading through his necromancer spells, looking for a way to restore his power. Mathias laughs and boasts that he cannot be killed because he is already dead. Jacob says grimly that he is not there to kill Mathias; instead he will torture Mathias for all eternity.

Read this and answer the question Bitumen was used in early photographic technology. In 1826 or 1827, it was used by French scientist Joseph Nicéphore Niépce to make the oldest surviving photograph from nature. The bitumen was thinly coated onto a pewter plate which was then exposed in a camera. Exposure to light hardened the bitumen and made it insoluble, so that when it was subsequently rinsed with a solvent only the sufficiently light-struck areas remained. Many hours of exposure in the camera were required, making bitumen impractical for ordinary photography, but from the 1850s to the 1920s it was in common use as a photoresist in the production of printing plates for various photomechanical printing processes.[not in citation given] What feature of bitumen use in photography made it impractical?","output":"The feature of bitumen use in photography that made it impractical was the many hours of exposure in the camera that were required for the process."},{"instruction":"Please answer the following question about this movie plot.

Movie title: Frankenstein Created Woman Movie plot: Abetted by the elderly Dr. Hertz (Thorley Waters) and handyman Hans (Robert Morris), Baron Frankenstein (Peter Cushing) determines that the soul does not immediately leave the body upon death, and can be transplanted from one body to another with a special apparatus he has developed. Hans is in love with Christina (Susan Denberg), the disfigured daughter of a local innkeeper. Christina's father disapproves of their relationship because Hans's father was executed for murder -- an execution Hans witnessed as a young boy. One night, while visiting Christina at the inn, Hans fights with three upper class snobs -- Anton (Peter Blythe), Johann (Derek Folds) and Karl (Barry Warren) -- when they insult her. Later that night, the three snobs sneak back into the inn and assault Christina's father, killing him.Hans is arrested for the murder. Despite the sterling character references of Dr Hertz and Frankenstein, the testimony of Anton, Johann and Karl persuade the jury. Because Hans will not reveal his whereabouts during the time of the murder -- he was making love with Christina -- he is sentenced to die at the same guillotine that killed his father some twenty years earlier.Frankenstein sees this as an opportunity to test his new machinery on a human, and he has Dr Hertz arrange to receive Hans's dead body. Christina, unaware that Hans had been sentenced to death, stumbles upon the execution site and sees Hans die. Distraught, she throws herself off a bridge and drowns. Frankenstein and Hertz successfully trap Hans' soul. The authorities bring Christina to Dr Hertz's office. Frankenstein persuades Hertz to trap her soul; once they have healed her injuries and facial disfigurements, they will restore her soul to her body.The procedure is a success. At first Frankenstein refuses to reveal to Christina who she really he is or allow her to leave Hertz's house, but after a few weeks he takes her to see the guillotine. When Christina sees the device she cries out \\"Papa!\\" and faints. Frankenstein's suspicions are proven:...

What is the answer for the question: What Republics did the Rova compound remained largely closed to the public, except on special occasions? from the following article ?  The 1896 French colonisation of Madagascar brought an end to the rule of the Merina sovereigns. The Rova of Antananarivo was converted into a museum the following year, and the Fitomiandalana tombs were excavated and moved to a new location behind the tombs of Radama I and Rasoherina. The bodies of sovereigns previously interred in the royal tombs at Ambohimanga were exhumed and transferred to the tombs in the Rova grounds, a sacrilegious move that degraded the status of Ambohimanga as a site of sacred pilgrimage. According to Frémigacci (1999), French colonial administrator General Joseph Gallieni undertook this desacralisation of the Rova in an attempt to break popular belief in the power of the royal ancestors. By the same token, his actions relegated Malagasy sovereignty under the Merina rulers to a relic of an unenlightened past.  The desecration of the two most sacred sites of Merina royalty represented a calculated political move intended to establish the political and cultural superiority of the colonial power.Following independence the Rova compound remained largely closed to the public throughout the First (1960–1972) and Second (1975–1992) Republics except on special occasions.  In 1995, three years into the Third Republic (1992–2010), the Rova compound was destroyed by fire. The tombs, chapel, exterior of Manjakamiadina and two traditional wooden houses (Besakana and Mahitsy) have since been restored with further restorations planned to continue until at least 2013.

Answer the above question based on the context below:  In August 1975, Rhodes spotted nineteen-year-old Kings Road habitué John Lydon wearing a Pink Floyd T-shirt with the words I Hate handwritten above the band's name and holes scratched through the eyes. Reports vary at this point: the same day, or soon after, either Rhodes or McLaren asked Lydon to come to a nearby pub in the evening to meet Jones and Cook. According to Jones, \\"He came in with green hair. I thought he had a really interesting face. I liked his look. He had his 'I Hate Pink Floyd' T-shirt on, and it was held together with safety pins. John had something special, but when he started talking he was a real arsehole—but smart.\\" When the pub closed, the group moved on to Sex, where Lydon, who had given little thought to singing, was convinced to improvise along to Alice Cooper's \\"I'm Eighteen\\" on the shop jukebox. Though the performance drove the band members to laughter, McLaren convinced them to start rehearsing with Lydon.Lydon later described the social context in which the band came together: Early Seventies Britain was a very depressing place. It was completely run-down, there was trash on the streets, total unemployment—just about everybody was on strike.

Ranaviruses can infect amphibians, reptiles and fish. In the UK, they have devastated common frog populations. This research suggests that the introduction of infected animals from aquatic retailers into ponds or moving species between different ponds may be exacerbating the problem. The findings are published in the Proceedings of the Royal Society B. Dr Trent Garner, from the Zoological Society of London (ZSL), told BBC News: \\"The virus seems to be spreading at a rate that exceeds the ability of a frog to hop, and there seems to be human-aided dispersal of the virus.\\" Ranaviruses are a group of viruses found across the world and they affect different species in different ways. In the UK, one type of ranavirus was found to be present in the South East of England in the 1980s, and it has since spread. It can kill common frogs either by causing sores and blisters to form on the animal's skin or by causing their internal organs to bleed. \\"In a certain proportion of populations, the disease persists. And when it persists, frogs decline by around 85%, and they don't seem to be recovering,\\" said Dr Garner. To analyse the movement of the disease in the UK, scientists looked at two decades of data recorded by a citizen science scheme called the Frog Mortality Project, which is now coordinated through  Garden Wildlife Health. Genetic records suggested that ranavirus was not always present in the UK, and had probably been introduced to the UK on two separate occasions. The study also found that while infection is spread by the natural movement of amphibians, garden ponds could also be playing a key role. Dr Garner said: \\"Potentially garden ponds can act as stepping stones for infected animals to move around and reach new sites.\\" He said that taking frogspawn or frogs from one pond and placing them in another could be helping to spread ranavirus. \\"There are also other species that could potentially carry ranavirus - ornamental fish for example. So I do think there is a case to be made to investigate their role in infections.\\" Lead author Dr Stephen Price, from University College London, ZSL and Queen Mary University of London, said: \\"Ranavirus is one of the most serious health threats currently facing the UK's amphibian population. \\"So our findings that humans seem to have helped move the virus around, facilitating its rapid spread, could be translated into some straightforward ways to manage the risk of disease outbreaks.\\" He added: \\"We certainly don't want to discourage people from adding ponds to their urban gardens - this remains one of the most positive steps we can all take to support wildlife. \\"But equally we would strongly urge people to try to limit how much potentially-infectious material they're moving into and out of their gardens in the process.\\" Follow Rebecca on Twitter: @BBCMorelle What is a summary of this text?","output":"Ranaviruses, which can infect amphibians, reptiles, and fish, have been devastating common frog populations in the UK. Recent research suggests that the introduction of infected animals from aquatic retailers and moving species between different ponds might be aggravating the issue. The virus appears to be spreading faster than the frogs' natural movement, with human-aided dispersal playing a significant role.

Joe's  farm has a depleted soil, while Gary started agroforestry a few years back, and grows cover crops.  But I can use this background: Depleted soils can be protected from soil erosion by groundcover plants such as naturally growing grasses in agroforestry systems. These help to stabilise the soil as they increase cover compared to short-cycle cropping systems. Soil cover is a crucial factor in preventing erosion. Cleaner water through reduced nutrient and soil surface runoff can be a further advantage of agroforestry. The runoff can be reduced by decreasing its velocity and increasing infiltration into the soil. Compared to row-cropped fields nutrient uptake can be higher and reduce nutrient loss into streams.Further advantages concerning plant growth:  What is an answer for this question: Which farmer helped to stabilize the soil more? A:","output":"Based on the provided information, it is evident that Gary, the farmer who started agroforestry a few years back and grows cover crops, helped to stabilize the soil more. The implementation of agroforestry practices has a significant impact on soil health, and the growth of cover crops further aids in soil stabilization and fertility. Let's delve deeper into the advantages of Gary's approach and how it contributed to better soil stabilization: 1. Agroforestry systems: By incorporating trees and shrubs alongside agricultural crops, Gary created an integrated ecosystem that significantly reduces the risk of soil erosion. The root systems of the trees not only hold the soil together but also create pathways for water to infiltrate, thereby reducing surface runoff and soil erosion potential. 2. Cover crops: Gary's decision to grow cover crops complements the benefits of his agroforestry system. Cover crops, being groundcover plants, protect the soil surface from the direct impact of raindrops and wind, which can dislodge soil particles and cause erosion. Their root systems also contribute to soil structure improvement, allowing for better water infiltration and reducing the speed of surface runoff. 3. Nutrient cycling: Through the growth of cover crops and the integration of trees in his agroforestry system, Gary was able to increase nutrient cycling in his soil. The roots of the cover crops and trees can penetrate deeper into the soil, making nutrients more accessible to the plants. Furthermore, the organic matter provided by the trees and cover crops decomposes, gradually releasing nutrients back into the soil. 4. Reduced nutrient loss: As explained in the background information, agroforestry systems like the one used by Gary can reduce nutrient loss into streams. The dense vegetation buffers and slowdown runoff, preventing nutrient leaching and preserving soil fertility. 5. Improved plant growth: The combined effect of agroforestry and cover cropping provides a healthy environment for plant growth. The improved soil structure and nutrient availability lead to increased overall crop productivity, while the trees and cover crops themselves offer additional benefits, such as habitat for beneficial insects and microorganisms, which further aid in the stabilization and enrichment of the soil. In conclusion, Gary, with his agroforestry system and cover crops, significantly contributed to soil stabilization on his farm. This approach not only protects the soil from erosion but also improves soil fertility and offers various ecological benefits, making his farming practices more sustainable than Joe's farm with depleted soil."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Sitting at the bar in Señor Goldstein's Mexican Restaurant in San Jose, California, Paul's own artwork engaged him for the first time in months, maybe years. Under other circumstances, that would have made him happy. But today's circumstances allowed only two emotions: despair and a burning desire for revenge.

Given the following context:  Three species of mangrove trees exist in the region: red (Rhizophora mangle), black (Avicennia germinans), and white (Laguncularia racemosa), although all are from different families. All have the same characteristics: they are tolerant of salt, brackish, and fresh water; they grow in oxygen-poor soil; and they can survive drastic water-level changes. Black and white mangroves excrete salt from under their leaves, and red mangroves filter the salinity of sea water. All species are integral to coastline protection during severe storms. Red mangroves, for example, have far-reaching roots that trap sediments. The trees not only stabilize coastlines, but add land as more sand and decaying vegetation is trapped in the root systems. All three mangroves also absorb the energy of waves and storm surges. The estuaries act as fisheries for fry and nurseries for crustaceans. Shrimp, oysters, crabs, whelks, cockles, and snails thrive in these waters, as do primordial horseshoe crabs (Limulus polyphemus). The region supports a 59 million-a-year Tortugas pink shrimp (Farfantepenaeus duorarum) industry, and a 22 million-a-year stone crab (Menippe mercenaria) industry.  Between 80 and 90 percent of species that are harvested commercially in Florida are born or spend time in the shallow waters near the Everglades. Oysters and mangroves work in tandem to build up the coastline. The sand around the coastline has minute white particles of quartz and fine shells. When currents are right, oysters grow in colonies or beds, and deposit their shells, reinforcing the bed. Mangrove seeds, called propagules, are full embryos and float in water until they reach a favorable location and take root, often on oyster beds. They shed skin and litter, ensuring other trees will not compete for space and nutrients.Mangroves also serve as excellent rookeries for birds. Wading birds, such as roseate spoonbills (Platalea ajaja), egrets, and tricolored herons (Egretta tricolor) use the mangroves as a nursery, due to the proximity of food sources...  answer the following question:  What are the full scientific names of the mangrove tree species that all have the same characteristics?

The service at the city's St Mary's Cathedral was told the 28-year-old was a \\"family man and a gentle giant\\". Family and friends of the Newcastle United supporter were joined by club manager Alan Pardew and team captain Fabricio Coloccini. Mr Sweeney and fellow Newcastle fan John Alder, 63, were killed when the flight crashed in Ukraine on 17 July. A Newcastle scarf and shirt was placed on his coffin as a sign of his commitment to the team. The hour-long service was told Mr Sweeney loved reading, especially Lord Of The Rings and Animal Farm. The pews of St Mary's Cathedral were packed for the funeral service - a celebration of Liam Sweeney's life as it said on the front of the order of service. Some wore badges with a photo of Liam alongside Newcastle United's badge and others T-shirts bearing the message - RIP Sweeney and Alder. It was Liam's passion for the football club and Geordie pride which ran through the service. His coffin was brought in to the sounds of Local Hero. A poem read by friends Malcolm Pegg and Amanda-Jade Fowler told of how fervently he had followed his team. We also heard of Liam's love of reading, music and The Simpsons. Canon Robert Spence described him as \\"a gentle young boy who became a giant gentleman\\" and said he \\"deserves a place in Geordie mythology\\". There were plenty of thoughts too for the family of John Alder, the fellow fan whose body has not yet been found. Rachel Kerr, BBC News, at St Mary's Cathedral Prayers were also said for the family of Mr Alder during the service. A tearful rendition of a poem was read out in the cathedral, which included the words: \\"If the Toon were playing you were there, win or lose through bad and good, Newcastle United were in your blood.\\" Pictures inside the order of service showed Mr Sweeney when he was a boy in his Newcastle kit. A collection of floral tributes were placed outside the catholic cathedral. Representatives from Malaysian Airlines and supermarket chain Morrisons, where Mr Sweeney worked, also attended the service. Prince Charles wrote to the family to express his sympathy following the \\"unimaginable tragedy\\". Mr Sweeney was a well-known Newcastle United fan and the cortege stopped outside St James' Park, before making its way to West Road Cemetery. Mr Sweeney and Mr Alder had been travelling to watch the club on a pre-season tour of New Zealand. All 298 people on board the plane died. Mr Sweeney's father said: \\"We're going to celebrate his life, not his death. \\"Him and John Alder have become legends. \\"If the world can become a better place because of what happened to Liam and John that'll be great. People have got to stop fighting. \\"I don't want to get involved in politics or religion, I just want to ensure the two lads didn't die in vain.\\" The letter from Prince Charles to Mr Sweeney read: \\"My wife and I just wanted you to know how very much our hearts go out to you following the truly unimaginable tragedy of the loss of your son, Liam. \\"All we can do is hold you in our most special thoughts and prayers at such an agonising time.\\" A minute's silence was observed by fans at St James' Park on Sunday as they paid tribute to Mr Sweeney and Mr Alder during United's opening home game of the Premier League season. Fans then clapped throughout the 17th minute in reference to the plane's flight code.","output":"Family, friends, and Newcastle United representatives mourn the loss of Liam Sweeney, a passionate fan and \\"gentle giant\\" who was killed in the flight MH17 crash in Ukraine, at a funeral service held in St Mary's Cathedral."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Answer the following question: You are given a new situation: Hill town had two large forests nearby. Lake forest had trees that were in a symbiotic relationship with a large variety of arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi. These fungi were less prevalent  in Brook forest.  and a hint : Arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi vary across many environmental gradients. Their tolerance to freezing and drying is known to shift between AM fungal taxa. AM fungi become less prevalent and diverse at higher soil nutrient and moisture concentrations, presumably because both plants allocate less carbon to AM fungi and AM fungi reallocate their resources to intraradical hyphae in these environmental conditions. Over the long term, these environmental conditions can even create local adaptation between plant hosts, AM fungi and the local soil nutrient concentrations.  Please answer this question : Which forest had fewer AM fungi which reallocate their resources to intraradical hyphae? Answer:","output":"To answer this question, let's break down the information given in the hint and relate it to the situation of the two forests. Hint analysis: 1. AM fungi become less prevalent and diverse at higher soil nutrient and moisture concentrations. 2. In these situations, plants allocate less carbon to AM fungi, and AM fungi reallocate their resources to intraradical hyphae. Now let's relate this information to the situation of the two forests: 1. Lake Forest: Has a large variety of arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi, indicating suitable environmental conditions for their growth. 2. Brook Forest: Has lesser arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi, indicating that the environmental conditions might be different. From the hint, we can deduce that when the soil nutrient and moisture concentrations are higher, there are fewer AM fungi, and they reallocate their resources to intraradical hyphae. Based on the conditions specified in the situation, Brook Forest has fewer arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi. Therefore, it is more likely that Brook Forest is the one where AM fungi reallocate their resources to intraradical hyphae due to higher soil nutrient and moisture concentrations."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant that follows instruction extremely well.

Following up from my recent blog post explaining why dietary supplements offer few benefits for most people, new research has found that people who take a mineral supplement actually consume more minerals from their normal diet than non-supplement users. The notion of the ‘worried well’ is certainly alive and kicking. Vitamin and mineral supplements are big business. Reported figures in Australia suggest that 27% of women and 15% of men take some form of supplement with vitamin C, B complex, multivitamins, vitamin E and calcium all being popular choices. Contrary to the rationale for needing supplements in the first place, people who take supplements are more likely to be healthier than people who don’t take supplements. Supplement users also tend to be leaner, smoke less, exercise more, and eat more fruit and vegetables. While it may seem obvious that people who take supplements likely consume more nutrients from their regular diet to start with, this hasn’t been well studied in large population groups. Using data from a nationally representative government health survey, researchers from the United States looked at the mineral intake from food and supplements of over 8000 men and women between 2003 and 2006. The results were clear cut: people taking mineral supplements were consuming more minerals from their normal diet than those who didn’t take supplements. The observation was even stronger in women than in men. The eight most popular mineral supplements taken were calcium, iron, magnesium, zinc, phosphorus, copper, potassium and selenium. Proving that it is possible to have too much of a good thing, supplement users were more likely to be exceeding the recommended upper level of intake for magnesium, zinc, iron and calcium. For someone who believes that they are reasonably healthy and are conscious of what they eat most of the time, taking a mineral supplement ‘just in case’ offers little to no benefit.

Given the question: Information:  - Ragtime  also spelled rag-time or rag time  is a musical genre that enjoyed its peak popularity between 1895 and 1918. Its cardinal trait is its syncopated, or \\"ragged\\", rhythm. The genre has its origins in African-American communities like St. Louis years before being published as popular sheet music for piano. Ernest Hogan (18651909) was a pioneer of ragtime music and was the first to compose ragtime into sheet music. The composition was called \\"LA Pas Ma LA\\" and it was released in 1895. Hogan has also been credited for coining the term \\"ragtime\\". The term is actually derived from his hometown \\"Shake Rag\\" in Bowling Green, Kentucky. Ben Harney, who is also a Kentucky native has often been credited for introducing the music to the mainstream public. His first ragtime composition \\"You've been a good old wagon but you done broke\\" helped popularize the musical genre. The composition was published in 1895 but released in 1896. Ragtime was also a modification of the march made popular by John Philip Sousa, with additional polyrhythms coming from African music. The ragtime composer Scott Joplin (\\"ca.\\" 18681917) became famous through the publication of the \\"Maple Leaf Rag\\" (1899) and a string of ragtime hits such as \\"The Entertainer\\" (1902), although he was later forgotten by all but a small, dedicated community of ragtime aficionados until the major ragtime revival in the early 1970s. For at least 12 years after its publication, \\"Maple Leaf Rag\\" heavily influenced subsequent ragtime composers with its melody lines, harmonic progressions or metric patterns.  - Improvisation is broad term referring to the process of devising an atypical method of solving a problem due to lack of time or resources. In a technical context, this can mean adapting a device for some use other than that which it was designed for, or building a device from unusual components in an ad-hoc fashion. Improvisation, within the context of performing arts, is a very spontaneous performance without specific or scripted preparation. The skills of improvisation can apply to many different faculties, across all artistic, scientific, physical, cognitive, academic, and non-academic disciplines.  - West Africa, also called Western Africa and the West of Africa, is the westernmost subregion of Africa. West Africa has been defined as including 18 countries: Benin, Burkina Faso, the island nation of Cape Verde, Gambia, Ghana, Guinea, Guinea-Bissau, Ivory Coast, Liberia, Mali, Mauritania, Niger, Nigeria, the island of Saint Helena, Senegal, Sierra Leone, São Tomé and Príncipe and Togo.  - African-American music is an umbrella term covering a diverse range of musics and musical genres largely developed by African Americans. Their origins are in musical forms that arose out of the historical condition of slavery that characterized the lives of African Americans prior to the American Civil War.  - A trumpet is a musical instrument commonly used in classical and jazz ensembles. The trumpet group contains the instruments with the highest register in the brass family. Trumpet-like instruments have historically been used as signaling devices in battle or hunting, with examples dating back to at least 1500 BC; they began to be used as musical instruments only in the late-14th or early 15th century. Trumpets are used in art music styles, for instance in orchestras, concert bands, and jazz ensembles, as well as in popular music. They are played by blowing air through almost-closed lips (called the player's embouchure), producing a \\"buzzing\\" sound that starts a standing wave vibration in the air column inside the instrument. Since the late 15th century they have primarily been constructed of brass tubing, usually bent twice into a rounded rectangular shape.   - Africa is the world's second-largest and second-most-populous continent. At about 30.3 million km² (11.7 million square miles) including adjacent islands, it covers 6% of Earth's total surface area and 20.4 % of its total land area. With 1.1 billion people as of 2013, it accounts for about 15% of the world's human population. The continent is surrounded by the Mediterranean Sea to the north, both the Suez Canal and the Red Sea along the Sinai Peninsula to the northeast, the Indian Ocean to the southeast, and the Atlantic Ocean to the west. The continent includes Madagascar and various archipelagos. It contains 54 fully recognized sovereign states (countries), nine territories and two \\"de facto\\" independent states with limited or no recognition.  - New Orleans (or ) is a major United States port and the largest city and metropolitan area in the state of Louisiana.

The New OrleansMetairieBogalusa Combined Statistical Area, a larger trading area, had a 2010 population of 1,452,502.  - A musician (or instrumentalist) is a person who plays a musical instrument or is musically talented. Anyone who composes, conducts, or performs music may also be referred to as a musician.   - Humphrey Richard Adeane Lyttelton (23 May 1921  25 April 2008), also known as Humph, was an English jazz musician and broadcaster from the aristocratic Lyttelton family.  - Dennis Moss MBE ( 16 August 1927 -- 28 May 2008 ) was a British jazz tenor saxophonist . He was known for playing with most of the high profile figures of British jazz , including Vic Lewis , Ted Heath , Johnny Dankworth , Alex Welsh , and Humphrey Lyttelton .  - Alex Welsh (9 July 1929  25 June 1982) was a Scottish Dixieland jazz musician, who played the cornet and trumpet, and sang.  - Jazz is a music genre that originated amongst African Americans in New Orleans, United States, in the late 19th and early 20th centuries. Since the 1920s jazz age, jazz has become recognized as a major form of musical expression. It emerged in the form of independent traditional and popular musical styles, all linked by the common bonds of African American and European American musical parentage with a performance orientation. Jazz is characterized by swing and blue notes, call and response vocals, polyrhythms and improvisation. Jazz has roots in West African cultural and musical expression, and in African-American music traditions including blues and ragtime, as well as European military band music. Although the foundation of jazz is deeply rooted within the Black experience of the United States, different cultures have contributed their own experience and styles to the art form as well. Intellectuals around the world have hailed jazz as \\"one of America's original art forms\\".  - Vic Lewis (29 July 1919  9 February 2009) was a British jazz guitarist and bandleader.

As a jazz musician, Moss specialized in the tenor saxophone, a musical instrument that is a member of the saxophone family. Typically used in jazz ensembles, the tenor saxophone is known for its versatile, rich tone and has been played by countless iconic musicians in jazz history. Moss's career as a jazz musician allowed him to collaborate with some of the most talented musicians in British jazz, making significant contributions to the genre and leaving behind a lasting legacy in the jazz community. Choosing to pursue music as his occupation, Moss demonstrated remarkable skill, passion, and dedication as both an instrumentalist and a jazz musician. Jazz music itself has a rich and diverse history with origins in African-American communities in the United States, particularly in New Orleans. The genre is characterized by its improvisational nature, syncopated rhythms, and incorporation of varied musical influences such as ragtime, blues, and African rhythms.

Brownell allegedly assaulted the musicians near 21st and O streets about 11:45 p.m. Sunday.      Police reported Tuesday evening that Brownell had turned himself in and was in custody at the Sacramento County Jail.      Brownell allegedly uttered “sexual orientation epithets” before attacking the musicians, according to a press release by the Police Department.      20 for 365 Days of Unlimited Digital Access Last chance to take advantage of our best offer of the year! Act now!      Police had arrested Brownell on Sunday on suspicion of assault with a deadly weapon and illegal possession of a firearm. Officers said they found guns at Brownell’s residence when they arrested him.      “The Sacramento Police Department has zero tolerance for these crimes,” the department said in a news release Monday evening.      In social media posts, the injured musicians all said their attacker referred to them with homophobic slurs because they were wearing skinny jeans.      Slaves guitarist Alex Lyman posted on Instagram that he suffered a 4-inch stab in his side not far from his spleen. Another guitarist, Weston Richmond, broke his right hand and had minor cuts.      The band posted on Facebook that it will still headline the Sacramento Concerts in the Park event Friday, though Richmond will not be able to perform.      Blake Abbey, the lead singer for local band Musical Charis, said on his Facebook page that he was stabbed in the arm and required surgery.      Slaves is composed of Sacramento musicians who previously played in other area bands, including former Dance Gavin Dance lead vocalist Jonny Craig. The band released its only album in June 2014 and has more than 94,000 fans on Facebook.      Sacramento police spokesman Officer Justin Brown had earlier said alcohol was also a factor in the assault. He called a triple stabbing “very unusual” for midtown.      Local musicians James Cavern and Carly DuHain will host a benefit show Saturday night to raise money for the victims’ medical expenses. The show, titled “I Wear Skinny Jeans,” will begin at 10 p.m. at Pour House, 1910 Q St., where Cavern works.      Cavern has played music with Abbey many times since he came to Sacramento four years ago, he said. His initial reaction to hearing about the stabbing was “shock and anger.”      “There was a lot of shock factor hearing the word ‘faggot’ thrown around,” Cavern said. “The story seemed almost just unbelievable, that someone would respond in such a way over something like that.” ||||| A summary of this is?","output":"In Sacramento, three musicians were stabbed in what has been reclassified as a hate crime.

How would one describe the sentiment of this tweet? prev tweet: He's still@ credit union, &amp;nobody there can take him--talking about putting him outside 2nite   Urgent kitteh situation.","output":"To describe the sentiment of this tweet, we must first break down the text and understand its components. The tweet discusses someone being at a credit union, with the situation suggesting that the person is looking for someone to help or adopt a cat (referred to as \\"kitteh\\"). However, the tweet mentions \\"nobody there can take him,\\" which indicates that the person has been unsuccessful in finding someone to tend to the cat. This is followed by the statement \\"talking about putting him outside 2nite\\" (tonight), which implies that the cat might end up spending the night outdoors, unprotected. Based on this context, we can analyze the sentiment expressed in the tweet. The tweet has a predominantly negative sentiment, as it talks about a dire and urgent \\"kitteh situation.\\" The writer seems concerned and slightly desperate, as they are actively trying to find a solution for the cat but are unable to succeed. By using the word \\"urgent,\\" the author emphasizes their need for immediate help for the cat. Anxiety and frustration are also present in the sentiment due to the unsuccessful search for assistance. The writer mentions that nobody at the credit union can take the cat, which conveys a sense of hopelessness or disappointment. This desperation intensifies with the idea of putting the cat outside, especially if it implies leaving the cat to the mercy of the environment and without shelter. In summary, the sentiment of this tweet is largely negative, marked by concern, frustration, and a sense of urgency. The author clearly cares about the well-being of the cat and is seeking help to improve its current situation, but has been met with disappointment and an inability to find a solution. This sense of despair is evident throughout the tweet, making it primarily negative in sentiment."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant that follows instruction extremely well.

Sherman and Maria are driving back to Maria's apartment from JFK Airport when they take a wrong turn on the expressway and find themselves in the \\"war-zone\\" of the South Bronx. They are approached by two black youths after Sherman gets out of the car to move a tire out of the road. Sherman jumps back into the car and Maria guns the engine in reverse, running over one of the teenagers. The two drive away. Sherman initially wants to report the incident to the police, but Maria immediately talks him out of it, fearing that their affair would be publicly exposed. Meanwhile, alcoholic journalist Peter Fallow, anxious for a story to make good with his editor, comes upon the hit-and-run case as a rallying point for the black community calling upon Jewish district attorney Abe Weiss, who is the Bronx District Attorney seeking re-election. According to Judge Leonard White, almost all of DA Weiss' prosecutions end up with black and Puerto Rican defendants going to prison and Weiss is seeking a white defendant for purposes of convincing the minority-majority community that he is worth re-electing. Weiss recognizes the press coverage inherent in prosecuting the callow Sherman, who has been discovered as the owner of the car, and therefore presumed to be the hit-and-run driver, in order to cultivate the image as an avenger for the minorities and be propelled to the mayorship of New York City.

In one sentence, describe what the following article is about: Although hernias can happen to anyone, certain factors might put you at a higher risk for herniation. These may be chronic conditions, or they may pass with time — for example, if you have a bad cough. Risk factors for hernias include:  Increased abdominal pressure Coughing Heavy lifting Constipation Pregnancy Obesity Advancing age Smoking Steroid use A hernia is an imperfection in the muscular container of an organ. Because of this imperfection, the organ is pushed through an opening, resulting in a hernia. As the organ comes through the opening, it will create a swollen area or bulge in the skin. A hernia often gets bigger when you are standing or when you are straining. The site of the swollen area may vary depending on what kind hernia you have. The terms for different hernia types refer either to the location or the cause of the hernia.  Inguinal - These are hernias occurring in the inguinal region (between the hip bone and crotch) or groin. Umbilical - Occur around the belly button Femoral - Occur along the inner thighs Incisional - Occur when incisions from prior surgeries create weak points in an organ's muscular container Diaphragmatic or hiatal - Occur when there's a congenital defect in the diaphragm If the hernia affects your intestine, it can change or even block the flow of food through your digestive system. This can cause an intestinal back-up that results in nausea and vomiting. If the intestine is not completely blocked, you may just see milder symptoms, like nausea without vomiting or decreased appetite. You may experience constipation if you suffer from an inguinal or femoral hernia low in the body. Constipation is, in essence, the exact opposite of vomiting. When the flow of feces is blocked, you may experience constipation -- instead of it all coming out, it stays in. Needless to say, this symptom necessitates immediate surgical intervention. Hernias can be very serious when they interfere with the functions your body needs in order to survive. If you are experiencing any constipation, see your doctor immediately. Many people with hernias don’t have any complaints of pain or severe or significant noticeable symptoms. But, they may have a feeling of heaviness or fullness in the affected area, especially in the abdomen. You might chalk this up to complaints of bloating. If nothing else, you'll feel keenly aware of your abdominal area, whether it's feeling full, weak, or just has a mysterious pressure. You can relieve the \\"bloating\\" from hernias by resting in a reclined position. Though it's not always present, pain is a sign of hernia — especially if there are complications. Inflammation can cause a burning sensation or sharp pain. Pressure build-up can result in a tearing pain that suggests the hernia is directly touching the muscle walls. Here's how pain affects hernias in different stages:  Irreducible hernia: the hernia cannot return to a normal state, but instead gets larger; you may feel occasional pain.  Strangulated hernia: the bulging organ is losing its blood supply, and could be dead soon without medical attention. You'll feel significant pain in this case, along with nausea, vomiting, fever, trouble moving your bowels. This condition requires emergency surgery. Hiatal hernia: the stomach bulges out of its cavity, causing chest pains. This also affects the flow of food, causing acid reflux and making it hard to swallow. Untreated hernia: hernias are usually painless and symptomless, but if left untreated, may cause pain and other health problems. All hernias have the potential to become dangerous.  If you suspect you have one, you need to see a doctor for evaluation as soon as possible. He or she will determine whether you actually have one, and also discuss its severity and your treatment options. If you know you have a hernia and feel sudden throbbing or pain in the area, go to the emergency room immediately.
