You will be given a task. You must generate a detailed and long answer. Summarize this article in one sentence. Students can learn a lot from actively participating in class. One way that you can encourage participation is by having constructive class discussions. Ask open-ended questions so that students have to give more than a yes or no answer. Don't ask questions with a set answer in mind. Discussions should help students explore different ideas.  Younger kids can start to learn critical thinking by answering questions. You could try, \\"What are some ways to show kindness?\\" You'll get lots of different answers! For example, you could ask, “Why is it so important that we take steps to protect the environment?” You could also try, “Do you think the U.S. should get involved in trying to solve problems in other countries? Why or why not?” In addition to discussion, you can try lots of other ways to help students get involved in class. Anything that gets the students doing something new for a few minutes is good. You can easily adjust activities according to the subject you teach. For almost any subject, you could try short in-class writing assignments. This will give students a break from listening to you talk and give them some time to learn more actively.  Say, “Okay, everyone spend 5 minutes writing about what you think the key points of today's topic. When you're done, we'll share our thoughts as a large group.”   Ask students to relate the topic to their own lives. For example, “Write a paragraph about what kinds of things your family does to help the environment.” Try Stand Up Sit Down. For example, if you are trying to teach the difference between proper nouns and common nouns, you can have students stand up if the word you say is a proper noun and sit down if it is a common noun. You can apply this to many subjects, including math. Try having students stand up if a number is prime and sit down if it is not. Working together can help students see material in a new way. It can also make things more fun! In addition to assigning group projects, you can find other creative ways to help students interact with one another.  Try Think-Pair-Share. Give students a question, and give them a few minutes to think about their answer. Then, have them pair up and share their answers with each other. Finally, have each pair share their answers with the whole class. This works great with high school and college students. Play a matching game. Hand out a note card with a word or phrase on it and have students get up and find their match. You can do this with rhyming words, synonyms, problems/solutions, or anything that you want! Elementary school kids can have lots of fun with this one. Getting out of the classroom is a great way to help students connect to material! Field trips are a great way to bring some excitement to the topic you're teaching. Make sure that the field trip clearly relates to what you are teaching. For example, if you've been learning about environmental issues, take students to a self-sustaining farm.  If you've been teaching about the solar system, take a trip to a planetarium. Make sure to follow all school policies when you're planning a field trip. For high school and college students, constructive debates are a great way for students to connect with the material. During discussions, encourage students to share opposing viewpoints. For example, if you are talking about whether or not peaceful protests are constructive, have students clearly explain their viewpoints. Make sure that students remain civil. No name calling, raised voices, or insults! If things start to get heated, wrap up the debate. Say, \\"We obviously have lots of strong feelings on this. To wrap up, take 5 minutes to write down what you feel are the key points on this issue.\\"","output":"This article emphasizes the importance of active participation in class through various methods, such as constructive discussions, in-class writing assignments, relatable topics, interactive activities, group projects, field trips, and debates to enhance students' learning experience and critical thinking skills."},{"instruction":"You should describe the task and explain your answer.

Q:Information:  - Alla breve is a musical meter notated by the time signature symbol (a C with a line through it), which is the equivalent of . The term is Italian for \\"in the style of the breve\\".  - An eighth note ( American ) or a quaver ( British ) is a musical note played for half the value of a quarter note ( crotchet ) and twice that of the sixteenth note ( semiquaver ) , which amounts to one quarter the duration of a half note ( minim ) , one eighth the duration of whole note ( semibreve ) , one sixteenth the duration of a double whole note ( breve ) , and one thirty - second the duration of a longa , hence the name . It is the equivalent of the fusa in mensural notation ( Morehen and Rastell 2001 ) Eighth notes are notated with an oval , filled - in note head and a straight note stem with one flag note flag ( see Figure 1 ) . A related symbol is the eighth rest ( or quaver rest ) , which denotes a silence for the same duration . In Unicode , the symbols U +266A (  ) and U +266B (  ) are an eighth note and beamed pair of eighth notes respectively . The two symbols are inherited from the early 1980s code page 437 , where they occupied codes 13 and 14 respectively . Additions to the Unicode standard also incorporated additional eighth note depictions from Japanese emoji sets : ascending eighth notes ( U +1F39C ,  ) , descending eighth noes ( U +1F39D ,  ) , a graphical generic musical note generally depicted as an eighth note ( U +1F3B5 ,  ) , and three unconnected eighth notes in sequence ( U +1F3B6 ,  ) . Unicode 's Musical Symbols block includes several variations of the eighth note ; these are the versions intended to be used in computerized musical notation ( as opposed to the others , which are graphical dingbats ) . As with all notes with stems , the general rule is that eighth notes are drawn with stems to the right of the notehead , facing up , when they are below the middle line of the musical staff . When they are on or above the middle line , they are drawn with stems on the left of the note head , facing down . Alternatively , stems are used to indicate voicing or parts ; all stems for the upper voice 's notes ( or \`\` parts '' ) are drawn facing up , regardless of their position on the...  - Mensural notation is the musical notation system used for European vocal polyphonic music from the later part of the 13th century until about 1600. The term \\"mensural\\" refers to the ability of this system to describe precisely measured rhythmic durations in terms of numerical proportions between note values. Its modern name is inspired by the terminology of medieval theorists, who used terms like \\"musica mensurata\\" (\\"measured music\\") or \\"cantus mensurabilis\\" (\\"measurable song\\") to refer to the rhythmically defined polyphonic music of their age, as opposed to \\"musica plana\\" or \\"musica choralis\\", i.e., Gregorian plainchant. With mensural notation being employed principally for compositions in the tradition of vocal polyphony, plainchant retained its own, older system of neume notation throughout the period, while some purely instrumental music could be written in various forms of instrument-specific tablature notation.  - In music, a whole note (American) or semibreve (British) is a note represented by a hollow oval note head and no note stem. Its length is equal to four beats in time, that is the whole measure (or bar). Most other notes are fractions of the whole note (e.g., half notes and quarter notes are played for one half and one quarter the duration of the whole note, respectively).  - In music, a double whole note (American), breve (international), or double note is a note lasting two times as long as a whole note (or \\"semibreve\\"). In medieval mensural notation, the \\"brevis\\" (ancestor of the modern breve) was one of the shortest note lengthshence its name, which is the Latin etymon of \\"brief\\" . In \\"perfect\\" rhythmic mode, the brevis was a third of a \\"longa\\", or in \\"imperfect\\" mode half a \\"longa\\" (for full details of the complications here, see for example ). However, in modern music notation it is the longest note value still in common use .  - In music, a half note (American) or minim (British) is a note played for half the duration of a whole note (or semibreve) and twice the duration of a quarter note (or crotchet). It was given its Latin name (\\"minim\\", meaning \\"least or smallest\\") because it was the shortest of the five note values used in early medieval music notation . In time signatures with 4 as the bottom number, such as or time, the half note is two beats long. However, when 2 is the bottom number (including \\"alla breve\\"), the half note is one beat long.  - A quarter note (American) or crotchet (British, from the sense 'hook') is a note played for one quarter of the duration of a whole note (or \\"semibreve\\"). Often, musicians will say that a crotchet is one beat, but this is not always correct, as the beat is indicated by the time signature of the music; a quarter note may or may not be the beat. Quarter notes are notated with a filled-in oval note head and a straight, flagless stem. The stem usually points upwards if it is below the middle line of the stave or downwards if it is on or above the middle line. However, the stem direction may differentiate more than one part. The head of the note also reverses its orientation in relation to the stem. (See image.)  - A neume (sometimes spelled neum) is the basic element of Western and Eastern systems of musical notation prior to the invention of five-line staff notation. The word entered the English language in the Middle English forms \\"newme\\", \\"nevme\\", \\"neme\\" in the 15th century, from the Middle French \\"neume\\", in turn from either medieval Latin \\"pneuma\\" or \\"neuma\\", the former either from ancient Greek (\\"breath\\") or (\\"sign\\"), or else directly from Greek as a corruption or an adaptation of the former.  - Tablature (or tabulature, or tab for short) is a form of musical notation indicating instrument fingering rather than musical pitches.  - Latin (Latin: ) is a classical language belonging to the Italic branch of the Indo-European languages. The Latin alphabet is derived from the Etruscan and Greek alphabets.  - In music, a 16th note (American) or semiquaver (British) is a note played for half the duration of an eighth note (quaver), hence the name. It is the equivalent of the semifusa in mensural notation, first found in 15th-century notation .  - The time signature (also known as meter signature, metre signature, or measure signature) is a notational convention used in Western musical notation to specify how many beats (pulses) are to be contained in each bar and which note value is to be given one beat. In a musical score, the time signature appears at the beginning of the piece, as a time symbol or stacked numerals, such as or (read \\"common time\\" and \\"three-four time\\", respectively), immediately following the key signature or immediately following the clef symbol if the key signature is empty. A mid-score time signature, usually immediately following a barline, indicates a change of meter.  - Music is an art form and cultural activity whose medium is sound and silence, which exist in time. The common elements of music are pitch (which governs melody and harmony), rhythm (and its associated concepts tempo, meter, and articulation), dynamics (loudness and softness), and the sonic qualities of timbre and texture (which are sometimes termed the \\"color\\" of a musical sound). Different styles or types of music may emphasize, de-emphasize or omit some of these elements. Music is performed with a vast range of instruments and vocal techniques ranging from singing to rapping; there are solely instrumental pieces, solely vocal pieces (such as songs without instrumental accompaniment) and pieces that combine singing and instruments. The word derives from Greek  (\\"mousike\\"; \\"art of the Muses\\"). In its most general form, the activities describing music as an art form include the production of works of music (songs, tunes, symphonies, and so on), the criticism of music, the study of the history of music, and the aesthetic examination of music. Ancient Greek and Indian philosophers defined music as tones ordered horizontally as melodies and vertically as harmonies. Common sayings such as \\"the harmony of the spheres\\" and \\"it is music to my ears\\" point to the notion that music is often ordered and pleasant to listen to. However, 20th-century composer John Cage thought that any sound can be music, saying, for example, \\"There is no noise, only sound.\\"    Given the paragraphs above, decide what entity has the relation 'instance of' with 'note value'.

The Rokeby Venus (; also known as The Toilet of Venus, Venus at her Mirror, Venus and Cupid, or  La Venus del espejo) is a painting by Diego Velázquez, the leading artist of the Spanish Golden Age.  Completed between 1647 and 1651, and probably painted during the artist's visit to Italy, the work depicts the goddess Venus in a sensual pose, lying on a bed and looking into a mirror held by the Roman god of physical love, her son Cupid. The painting is in the National Gallery, London. Numerous works, from the ancient to the baroque, have been cited as sources of inspiration for Velázquez. The nude Venuses of the Italian painters, such as Giorgione's Sleeping Venus (c. 1510) and Titian's Venus of Urbino (1538), were the main precedents. In this work, Velázquez combined two established poses for Venus: recumbent on a couch or a bed, and gazing at a mirror. She is often described as looking at herself on the mirror, although this is physically impossible since viewers can see her face reflected in their direction. This phenomenon is known as the Venus effect. In a number of ways the painting represents a pictorial departure, through its central use of a mirror, and because it shows the body of Venus turned away from the observer of the painting.The Rokeby Venus is the only surviving female nude by Velázquez. Nudes were extremely rare in seventeenth-century Spanish art, which was policed actively by members of the Spanish Inquisition. Despite this, nudes by foreign artists were keenly collected by the court circle, and this painting was hung in the houses of Spanish courtiers until 1813, when it was brought to England to hang in Rokeby Park, Yorkshire. In 1906, the painting was purchased by National Art Collections Fund for the National Gallery, London. Although it was attacked and badly damaged in 1914 by the suffragette Mary Richardson, it soon was fully restored and returned to display.","output":"The Rokeby Venus was badly destroyed in the year 1914 when it was attacked by the suffragette Mary Richardson."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant that follows instruction extremely well.

Write an article based on this \\"Emergency calls to the ambulance service have been disrupted after its computer system lost power.\\"","output":"Title: Disruption in Ambulance Service Emergency Calls Due to Power Loss in Computer System Introduction In recent times, the healthcare sector has been under tremendous pressure, primarily due to increasing patient loads and the need for efficient emergency response services. Ambulance services form a critical component of this framework, delivering timely and appropriate medical attention to patients in need. However, these essential services hit a stumbling block when their computer system lost power recently, leading to significant disruption in handling emergency calls. This article explores the effects of this incident, its possible causes, and the steps taken to manage the crisis and prevent such occurrences in the future. The Incident The disruption of emergency calls to the ambulance service occurred when the central computer system suffered an unexpected power loss. This unforeseen event led to the accidental cancellation of operations, significant delays in responding to emergency calls, and inefficient management of resources within the affected service. During this period, distressed callers faced problems in reaching out to the concerned authorities, leading to feelings of frustration, panic, and dissatisfaction among patients and their families. Possible Causes of the Power Loss While the exact cause of the power loss remains unconfirmed, some potential factors that could lead to such a situation include: 1. Hardware or software failure: Unexpected technical malfunctions in the computer system can lead to sudden power losses, disrupting the smooth functioning of the entire system. These failures could be a result of manufacturing defects or wear and tear, affecting the system at large. 2. Cyberattacks: As technology dominates our lives, the threat of cyberattacks on critical infrastructure has grown significantly. Attacks on healthcare systems, including ambulance service operations, could lead to the loss of essential data and impede the functioning of life-saving services. 3. Power outages: A widespread power outage or grid failure in the region could also affect the computer systems responsible for managing emergency calls. Such situations may require alternative power backup systems to keep operations going during these periods. Mitigation and Crisis Management Efforts In response to the power loss within the computer system, the ambulance service initiated several measures to address the crisis, which included: 1. Activation of contingency plans: The ambulance service implemented pre-established contingency plans that allowed the manual handling of emergency calls through backup communication channels. This enabled the service to continue attending to patients despite the temporary setbacks. 2. Utilization of backup power systems: Deploying backup power generators during the power loss period ensured that critical systems, including the emergency call center, remained operational and responsive to the public's needs. This helped cope with the influx of calls during this time. 3. Collaboration with other emergency services: Owing to the disruption in services, the ambulance service sought assistance from local police, fire departments, and other emergency responders to support the handling and transportation of patients during the crisis. This collaborative effort helped maintain a steady flow of assistance and ensured that patients received the critical care that they required. 4. Regular updates and communication: To keep the public informed, the ambulance service provided regular updates about the situation and reassured the public that the necessary steps were being taken to address the issue. Open and transparent communication helped contain panic and display the service's commitment to the community. Preventive Measures for the Future To avoid similar disruptions in the future, the ambulance service needs to consider implementing various preventive measures, such as: 1. Regular system checks: This comprises routine maintenance and updates on all hardware and software components to reduce the risk of system malfunction and ensure optimal system performance. 2. Cybersecurity enhancement: Investing in advanced cybersecurity measures can help protect critical IT infrastructure, deterring potential cyberattacks and reducing the likelihood of significant disruption to services. 3. Power backup systems: Establishing adequate power backup mechanisms can ensure that the computer systems and emergency call centers remain operational during unexpected power outages. 4.

Let's solve this fun little math problem together for j. It's like a puzzle, but with numbers! Here's the problem: 2005*j + 104048 = -45394 + 29142 First, let's fix the right side of the equation. We need to add -45394 and 29142 together. You get: -45394 + 29142 = -16252 Now our equation looks like this: 2005*j + 104048 = -16252 Next, we want to get j all by itself, so let's move the 104048 to the other side by subtracting it from both sides. You get: 2005*j = -16252 - 104048 Now you subtract: -16252 - 104048 = -120300 Our equation is now: 2005*j = -120300 To find what \\"j\\" is, we're going to divide both sides by 2005. You get: j = -120300 / 2005 Now, when you divide -120300 by 2005, you get: j = -60 And that's the answer, kiddo! j equals -60.

A:","output":"To make a simple headpiece to wear in your hair, follow these easy steps: Step 1: Gather materials You'll need a few materials to get started. These include: - A headband, hair clip, or hair comb (as the base for your headpiece) - Various decorative items such as faux flowers, ribbons, beads, or feathers - Hot glue gun and glue sticks (or a strong adhesive/ fabric glue) - Scissors - Needle and thread (optional) Step 2: Plan your design Before you start, it's a good idea to plan your design. Consider the placement of your decorative items and how they will look together on the headband, clip, or comb. You may want to arrange your decorations on a flat surface to visualize your design before assembling your headpiece. Step 3: Attach the decorative items Using the hot glue gun (or adhesive), carefully attach your decorations to your chosen base. Start with the largest decorative items, such as flowers or large beads, and then build around those by adding smaller pieces like ribbons, feathers, or smaller flowers. Step 4: Secure any loose ends If you have any loose ends, like ribbon tails or strings of beads, make sure to secure them with glue or needle and thread. This will ensure that your headpiece stays together and looks neat when you wear it. Step 5: Let it dry Give your headpiece time to dry, according to the adhesive manufacturer's instructions.

Please answer the following question: Use information from the paragraph to answer the question.  Question:   The increasing distances between galaxies indicates the Universe is expanding or contracting?    Paragraph :  As the Universe expands, galaxies move further and further apart. A:","output":"Based on the provided paragraph, the increasing distances between galaxies indicate that the Universe is expanding. The concept of an expanding Universe is primarily built on the idea that galaxies, the large systems of stars, dust, and gas, are observed to move away from each other in the vast cosmic space. This idea was first proposed by Belgian astronomer Georges Lemaître and was later confirmed by American astronomer Edwin Hubble, after whom the famous Hubble Space Telescope is named. The reason for the expansion of the Universe is rooted in the Big Bang theory, which describes the formation and early development of the Universe. According to this theory, approximately 13.8 billion years ago, an extremely hot and dense state rapidly expanded, and has been expanding ever since. During this initial expansion, fundamental particles and structures began to form, eventually leading to the creation of atoms, stars, galaxies, and many other celestial bodies that we observe today. This expansion is propelled by the mysterious force known as dark energy. Dark energy is hypothesized to make up approximately 72 percent of the total energy content of the Universe, and it is what is believed to be responsible for driving the increasing distances between galaxies. In conclusion, the increasing distances between galaxies signifies that the Universe is expanding, not contracting. This expansion is a result of the Big Bang theory and the effects of dark energy, which are fundamental principles in our current understanding of the Universe's formation, structure, and potential future developments."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant that follows instruction extremely well.

Long story short: This company and their owner are very rude, disrespectful and insult their customers They do not follow through with the agreements set forth. Buyer beware, do not trust this company unless you want to be burned.   Full Story: Called my home insurance company about a problem with my dishwasher. Tech came out in a couple of days. Upon the tech arriving I asked the tech to remove their shoes (or use booties) because we just had brand new carpet installed. The woman tech immediately copped an attitude with me and huffed and puffed and said \\"Well, I cant and won't do my job if I have to work with a dishwasher and no shoes. No way.\\" all, while huffing and puffing.   Ok, not off to a good start.   She then inspected the dishwasher with an attitude, banging stuff around. Finally found the issue - bad control board. She ordered the board and said the office would call back when she found the availability of the board that afternoon or the next day.   A week later WE have to hunt them down and ask them the status of the control board. They finally got the board and scheduled a time to install from 8am-12pm on a Saturday. 12:15pm rolls around and we call them and then ask for \\"Dave\\"  the owner. A male answers and says \\"WHOS THIS?!?!\\" - what a nice way to answer your business phone, buddy. After some back and forth he says that they never stated 8am-12pm and that its going to be between 12pm-5pm and that they're backed up (did not say sorry, or anything). He then gets an attitude with my wife because he informs her that it's our fault for not listening correctly to his rep the day before.   Seriously, who says that to a customer?   She informs him that we had cancelled our morning plans to account for the service tech and now this completely ruins our plans for today as we have to cancel afternoon plans as well. Connection gets muffled and my wife cant hear anything, she hangs up.   He calls back in about 2 minutes and I pick up. He immediately asks me if my wife always hangs up on service technicians. WOW, really? Did he just say that? I inform him that she's frustrated because no one called and we were given the wrong information so now we have wasted our day waiting for service. He didnt care and said \\"well thats not our fault, we said 12pm-5pm\\". I informed him that that is not what she heard and she is very precise. He then tells me to stop insulting his wife because thats who my wife spoke to last night to confirm the appointment and he was apparently sitting there next to her. I pause, wait, and then ask ... \\"well, ok, whats the next step I need to get this fixed.\\" He says \\"Well I dont appreciate being hung up on and having my wife treated this way.\\" I inform him that we simply dont like the way he's treating us and informed him that if he wanted to keep it up I'd call the insurance company and complain about his company (which would give him a lower ranking on service calls). He says \\"Go ahead, they wont do nothing, I've been with them for 30 years, they wont do nothing.\\" Me: \\"Hmmm, ok, whatever, I need to get this fixed, whats the next step.\\" Him: \\"Well, if your doing with this man to man pissing match, then maybe we can do it.\\" Again I inform him he has a terrible attitude and I just want to get it fixed. He then says: \\"You know what, call the insurance company we're not doing anything for you.\\" I tell him to take a flying leap.   Thats the end of it. DO NOT EVER USE THIS COMPANY. No one should use a company who treats their customers like absolute garbage.   Terrible Service.  Terrible Attitude.  Terrible all around.","output":"The sentiment of this review is extremely negative. The reviewer recounts a series of disappointments and unpleasant encounters with the company in question, stating that they were treated poorly and disrespectfully by both the technician and the owner. The technician allegedly gave attitude when asked to remove their shoes due to newly installed carpet, and the reviewer also mentions that the company did not follow through with the agreed upon services in a timely and organized manner. Additionally, the reviewer describes the company's customer service as being very poor and characterized by rudeness and condescension, especially from the owner. The reviewer suggests multiple instances of broken appointments and overall dissatisfaction with their service experience. The story culminates with the reviewer expressing dismay and outrage at the owner's response to the situation, stating that he implied that the company was immune to repercussions and did not care about the potential for a negative review to affect their standing with an insurance company. The owner allegedly ended the conversation by refusing to provide further services, to which the reviewer used strong language to express their disgust and admonishment of the company.  The reviewer closes by strongly advising against hiring this company and summarizing their impressions of the experience as \\"Terrible service, terrible attitude, terrible all around.\\" They describe the company's treatment of customers as being like \\"absolute garbage.\\" The intent behind this review is clearly to warn others about negative aspects of this company, these include lack of respect, poor problem resolution, foul attitudes, and allegedly bad business practices."},{"instruction":"Explain how you used the definition to come up with the answer.

A struggle exists for Sweetwater, a piece of land near Flagstone containing the region's only water source. The land was bought by Brett McBain (Frank Wolff), who foresaw that the railroad would have to pass through that area to provide water for the steam locomotives. When crippled railroad tycoon Morton (Gabriele Ferzetti) learns of this, he sends his hired gun Frank (Henry Fonda) to intimidate McBain to move off the land, but Frank instead kills McBain and his three children, planting evidence to frame the bandit Cheyenne (Jason Robards). It appears the land has no owner; however, a former prostitute (Claudia Cardinale) arrives from New Orleans, revealing she is Jill McBain, Brett's new wife and the owner of the land. Meanwhile, a mysterious harmonica-playing gunman (Charles Bronson), whom Cheyenne later dubs \\"Harmonica\\", pursues Frank. In the film's opening scene, Harmonica kills three men sent by Frank to kill him. In a roadhouse on the way to Sweetwater, he informs Cheyenne that the three gunfighters appeared to be posing as Cheyenne's men. Back at Sweetwater, construction materials are delivered to build a railroad station and a small town. Harmonica explains that Jill will lose Sweetwater unless the station is built by the time the track's construction crews reach that point, so Cheyenne puts his men to work building it. Frank turns against Morton, who wanted to make a deal with Jill; Morton's disability makes him unable to fight back. After raping Jill, Frank forces her to sell the property in an auction. He tries to buy the farm cheaply by intimidating the other bidders, but Harmonica arrives, holding Cheyenne at gunpoint, and makes a much higher bid based on his reward money for delivering Cheyenne to the authorities.

Jimbob Blakey wasn't so much given birth to as clambered right out of his mother himself. He weighed in at almost thirteen pounds, came ready-fitted with a shock of fat black hair and a couple of razor teeth. Jimbob's folks loved him like most folks love their little ones, maybe more. They'd been trying so hard for a child, suffered more mid-term miscarriages than the ewes they shuttled off to market most Thursdays. They dressed him in a one-year babygro and took him home to their hill farm. They fought to get up nights and give him his milk. His teeth made breast-feeding impossible. They sat hours gazing down in his cot. They dressed him fine and took him to their church and gave their thanks. Showed him off like the proud parents they were. Others cooed and smiled. But they never asked to hold. They gave thanks the Blakeys were happy, and that the monkey-baby had not been born to them. Jimbob's folks never gave a second thought that their boy might be different. The first Spring he walked, he stomped the moors in his welly-boots helping herd the pregnant ewes down in-by. He copied his father, kicking and cuffing at the stragglers, when the flock was returned to the hills in May. As Jimbob grew, his hair became thicker, his arms longer. His head shrunk down on his shoulders. At check-ups, nurses fixed smiles and pronounced him healthy. Doctors said, 'he'll make you a strapping lad.' His mother smiled, her heart swelled. When he was three, she sent him to nursery. She wanted him to mix with other kids. To taste life off the hard hills. She said, 'it'll do him the world of good.' Jimbob hated leaving the farm. He clung to his mother. She drove away, blinking tears. On the third day, she took a phone call. 'It's Jimbob,' they said. 'He's scaring the other kids.'The truth hit Jimbob's mother like a hammer. Question: What did Jimbob's mother do after the nursery called? Options: - not enough information   - She told him to get along with the other kids more.   - She picked him up   - She scolded the nursery for not integrating him more. === The correct answer is The answer to this question is:","output":"Not enough information. The story does not provide details about what Jimbob's mother did after the nursery called."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant. You will be given a task. You must generate a detailed and long answer. Summarize the following: This is most often an issue with younger children, but can  also be a concern with some older children. They may have fears about being away from you or you coming back. The best thing you can do to deal with a child that doesn’t want to go to school because of separation anxiety is to constantly reassure them and do things to help them feel more secure.  Talk with the child about how the day will go. For example, you might tell them, “First, we'll walk to your class so you can have fun learning. I’ll go to work. Then, at 3 o’clock I'll come to your classroom to pick you up.“ If you're a teacher, reassure the child that their parent will return at the end of the day.  You might say, “After we have fun together learning, your dad will pick you up.” If you’re the child’s parent, always be on time for dismissal. If you're going to be late, call the school and let the child know. Children may exhibit school refusal following a family illness or death. Take stock of any recent upsets or losses in the family. If needed, consider getting therapy to help the child overcome their anxiety. Bullying has, unfortunately, become an everyday reality for many children. In many cases, children refuse to go to school because they're being bullied and may not have reported it or know how to handle it. If you discover that this is the reason, you should talk to the child about what's going on as well as report it to the appropriate authorities.   Ask the child directly if they're being bullied. You could try, “Is there someone at school or something going on at school that's bothering you?” Let the child know that you are there to support them. You might say something like, “I know that it can be hard going to school when you’re being bullied. I'm here for you and we'll get through this.” Talk to the school counselor,  principal, and other appropriate authorities about what is happening to the child. Refusal to attend school and difficulties at school are sometimes signs of child abuse or child neglect. Look at other areas of the child’s behavior and life to determine if abuse or neglect might be an issue. If you have any concerns about the child’s safety, you should contact authorities immediately.   Review the list of signs and symptoms of child abuse provided by Mayo Clinic at http://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/child-abuse/basics/symptoms/con-20033789. Report your concerns to the school counselor, the child’s pediatrician, or other appropriate authorities. Children are abusing drugs and alcohol at earlier ages than ever before. In some instances, a child’s refusal to go to school may be a sign of substance abuse. If you suspect that this is the case, look for other signs that the child may have a substance abuse problem and seek treatment for it immediately.   Review the list of signs and symptoms provided by DrugFree.org at http://www.drugfree.org/resources/is-your-teen-using-signs-and-symptoms-of-substance-abuse/. Let the child know you're concerned. You can say, “I think you have a substance abuse problem and its interfering with you going to school. I'm concerned and want to help you.” Talk to the child’s pediatrician about age-appropriate substance abuse services in the area. Sometimes issues like depression,  anxiety, or other disorders can cause a child to refuse to go to school. Consider the child’s mental health when you plan ways to address their school refusal. In some cases, treating the mental health issues can eliminate their refusal to go to school.  If the child has a diagnosed mental illness, check to see how their treatment is going or if there have been changes in treatment. For instance, you might ask their parent, “If you don’t mind me asking, how is treatment going right now?” If you suspect a mental illness, you should contact their school counselor or pediatrician as soon as possible. For example, if the child is withdrawing, moody, or seems hopeless, in addition to refusing to go to school, it might be a sign of depression and you should seek help.","output":"Separation anxiety, family issues, bullying, child abuse or neglect, substance abuse, and mental health disorders are some of the possible reasons a child might refuse to go to school. To help a child dealing with separation anxiety, reassure them that you will return and stick to consistent routines. Communicate with the child about the day's schedule and always be on time for pick-up. In the case of a recent family illness or death, consider therapy to help the child overcome their anxiety. If bullying is suspected, engage in a conversation with the child and report the issue to the school counselor, principal, and other authorities. Keep an open line of communication and ensure the child knows you are there to support them. If child abuse or neglect is a concern, review the list of signs and symptoms provided by Mayo Clinic and report your concerns to the appropriate authorities, such as the school counselor or the child's pediatrician. In cases of suspected substance abuse, refer to the list of signs and symptoms provided by DrugFree.org, express your concerns to the child and consult their pediatrician for age-appropriate treatment options. Mental health issues like depression and anxiety can also cause a child to refuse to go to school. Monitor the child's mental health and seek professional help if needed. If the child has been diagnosed with a mental illness, ensure that their treatment plan is being followed appropriately. In all cases, involving the school counselor, pediatrician, and other relevant professionals can play a crucial role in helping the child overcome their difficulties and ensure their attendance at school."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Best snacks to eat late at night Dinner is over and you’re getting ready for bed—but your stomach is wide awake. While health experts often advise avoiding late night snacking entirely, if you’re genuinely hungry late in the evening you shouldn’t feel like your only option is to tough it out until morning. Choosing a light and nutritious snack can satisfy your appetite and keep you from overdoing it on the box of cookies when you tell yourself you’ll eat just one. Next time your stomach growls before bed, try one of these healthy and satisfying snacks to take the edge off your hunger. Cottage cheese or yogurt: If you’re craving something cool and creamy before bed, try to resist the ice cream and have a cup of yogurt or cottage cheese. Both of these foods are high in protein and calcium, a mineral shown to produce a more restful sleep. And be sure to choose ones with live active cultures to help improve your digestive health and strengthen your immune system. Grapes: If you’re looking for a finger food to snack on late at night, grapes are a healthy and hydrating option. Made of 82 percent water, a serving of grapes provides 1/3 cup of water – which is why they work great as a frozen treat as well. A heart-healthy snack, grapes are a natural source of beneficial antioxidants and other polyphenols (beneficial plant compounds). The fact that they are good for you, in addition to being a highly enjoyable late night snack, is a bonus. Popcorn: Instead of reaching for a bag of greasy chips, try popcorn – it’s the only snack food that’s 100 percent unprocessed whole grain. In fact, a study published in the Journal of the American Dietetic Association found that popcorn eaters get 250 percent more whole grains in their diet than people who don’t eat popcorn. Plus for a 100-calorie snack you can have three cups of air-popped popcorn or 10 greasy potato chips, and who eats just 10? Pistachios: If you like your snacks on the savory side, try reaching for some pistachios before bed. If you’re hungry, snacking on pistachios gives you an advantage over other nuts, as you get more nuts per ounce. You get 49 pistachios in a one-ounce serving, which has 160 calories. Plus research shows that snacking on pistachios compared to other common snack foods like pretzels leads to more weight loss and greater reductions in cardiovascular disease risk factors. For a more mindful snack, choose in-shell pistachios as the shells can help slow you down so you don’t overdo it before bed. Fried egg sandwich: If you want something comforting and a bit more substantial before bed, a fried egg sandwich fits the bill. Use just a little bit of olive oil for your egg, and serve on one piece of whole-grain toast for a quick snack with more than 10 grams protein and only about 200 calories. Plus, studies suggest that eggs can play a role in weight management, muscle strength, healthy pregnancy, brain function, eye health and more. Herbal Teas: If you’re feeling peckish before bed but don’t want to eat much, try having a mug of herbal tea to see if it hits the spot. Chamomile is a classic choice, but there are also dessert-like flavors -- such chocolate mint, coconut cake, or caramel vanilla -- that might help you quiet your late-night cravings. Since herbal teas are caffeine-free they are ideal for sipping before bed, but there are also decaf versions of most black and green teas available. Take your time at your grocery store or specialty tea shop to find some interesting options to keep on hand.

Article: During all this time I never stopped thinking about escape. When I traveled across to the other side of the island, I could see the other islands, and I said to myself, \\"Perhaps I can get there with a boat. Perhaps I can get back to England one day.\\"   So I decided to make myself a boat. I cut down a big tree, and then began to make a long hole in it. It was hard work, but about six months later, I had a very fine canoe  . Next, I had to get it down to the sea. How silly I was! Why didn't I think before I began work? Of course, the canoe was too heavy. I couldn't move it! I pulled and pushed and tried everything, but it didn't move. I was very unhappy for a long time after that.   That happened in my fourth year on the island. In my sixth year I did make myself a smaller canoe, but I did not try to escape in it. The boat was too small for a long journey, and I did not want to die at sea. The island was my home now, not my prison, and I was just happy to be alive.  A year or two later, I made myself a second canoe on the other side of the island. I also built myself a second house there, and so I had two homes.   My life was still busy from morning to night. There were always things to do or to make. I learnt to make new clothes for myself from the skins of dead animals. They looked very strange, it is true, but they kept me dry in the rain.   I kept food and tools at both my houses, and also wild goats. There were many goats on the island, and I made fields with high fences to keep them in. They learnt to take food from me, and soon I had goats' milk to drink every day. I also worked hard in my corn   fields. And so many years went by.

Options: 1. after approval from Trump only; 2. not enough information; 3. before approval from the states; 4. after approval from the states and Trump; Q: White House officials on Wednesday laid out plans to send National Guard troops to the United States’ southern border with Mexico, as part of President Donald Trump’s efforts to confront what he says is a growing problem with illegal immigrants. The decision to deploy the U.S. military to the border represents a major new aspect of Trump’s wide-ranging immigration crackdown. But major parts of the move are unclear, including how many troops will be sent, when they will deploy, or what exactly they will do. “It will take time to have the details in place, but we are beginning today and are moving quickly,” said Kirstjen Nielsen, secretary of the Department of Homeland Security. “We are anxious to have this support.” In the U.S., the active duty military is generally restricted from domestic law enforcement functions, which would include apprehending border crossers. However, U.S. presidents have deployed the National Guard to the border to act in support roles. Nielsen said the National Guard troops will help with border surveillance and other “support functions.” She declined to say how large the force would be, but she did say it would include “as many (troops) as is needed to fill the gaps today.” A senior Trump administration official declined to say whether the National Guard troops will be armed, saying those details are still being worked out. But the official said the force would be effective. “Suffice it to say, for individuals looking to pay a smuggler to get in the United States right now, that would be a very unwise investment,” the official said. Trump signed a proclamation authorizing the move Wednesday evening. But states must also approve the decision before deploying their guard members. Trump repeatedly has threatened to deploy the military to help secure the border, especially as a caravan of Central American migrants makes it way north through Mexico, with some headed for the U.S. Question: When can the National Guard be deployed to the border of US and Mexico? === The answer to the above question is A:","output":"The National Guard can be deployed to the border of the US and Mexico after approval from both the states and President Trump.

WHITE HOUSE — U.S. President Donald Trump on Friday met for 80 minutes in the Oval Office with a general he described as the second most powerful man in North Korea. Afterward, Trump told reporters on the White House South Lawn that the June 12 summit in Singapore between him and North Korea's leader, Kim Jong Un, was back on. Trump, however, sought to quell some of the high expectations, saying the summit would \\"be a beginning\\" and subsequent discussions were likely to be needed to get Pyongyang to agree to denuclearization. \\"We're not going to go in and sign something on June 12th, and we never were,\\" he said. \\"We're going to start a process.\\" Trump declared he \\"never said it happens in one meeting,\\" but that it \\"will ultimately be a successful process.\\" Asked by VOA News whether the North Koreans had committed to complete, verifiable and irreversible denuclearization, Trump replied only that \\"we talked about a lot of things.\\" 'Take your time' The president said he told Kim Yong Chol, the former head of North Korean military intelligence, \\"Take your time. We can go fast. We can go slowly.\\" The president made clear that sanctions on North Korea would not be lifted, however, until the country agreed to give up its nuclear arsenal. As the negotiations over the Singapore summit play out in public, there is a sense among some observers that Trump and Kim Jong Un each have a clear sense of the deal they ultimately want to strike. Less clear is whether the U.S. and North Korean visions can match up in any meaningful way. \\"Singapore might be the first time people will have to put their cards on the table,\\" a U.S. official said on the condition of anonymity. Upon his arrival Friday at the White House, Kim Yong Chol, who is under U.S. sanctions for links to cyberattacks against American companies, delivered a letter from Kim Jong Un. While Trump did not reveal the contents, he described the gesture as \\"very nice.\\" Question: Why did Pres Trump say nothing would be signed on June 12th?

Tyrone competed fiercely against Derry, demonstrating excellent skills and teamwork to claim a well-deserved win with a final scoreline of 2-13 to 1-07. As the competition drew to a close, Tyrone confirmed their status as a formidable force in the sport, outplaying their rivals and significantly adding to their reputations. The History Behind the Dr. McKenna Cup Named in honor of Dr. Joseph McKenna, a passionate supporter of Gaelic games, the Dr. McKenna Cup was first played in 1927, and since then, it has cemented its position as a prominent pre-season competition in the GAA calendar. The cup serves as an opportunity for senior inter-county teams in the Ulster region to engage in competitive matches before the Allianz Football League commences. It offers teams a chance to test new tactical approaches and gain essential match practice under their belts. The Final Match: Tyrone vs Derry The anticipation was high as spectators gathered to watch the face-off between these two local rivals. Tyrone came into the match with a spectacular winning streak in the competition and held a significant psychological advantage. Meanwhile, their opponents, Derry, sought to halt Tyrone's run and build real momentum for their season ahead. From the onset, Tyrone took control of the match with an attacking mindset, displaying a fantastic combination of speed, skill, and precision. They managed to clinch an early lead, which they maintained throughout the game. Their thorough preparation and pre-season training were visibly evident as they executed their game plan with composure and self-assurance.

They fought hard to navigate through Tyrone's robust defense, and despite their best efforts, Derry could not quite close the gap on the scoreboard. Key Highlights and Game Changers Several standout moments during the match significantly contributed to the final outcome. Tyrone's two crucial goals, strategically scored during the first half, gave them a significant buffer and psychological advantage over their opponents.

However, Tyrone's tenacious defensive efforts and tireless work ethic in midfield ensured that a comeback was not in the cards for Derry. The players from both teams put up a commendable performance, with some individuals, in particular, leaving their mark on the game. On Tyrone's side, their midfield was extraordinarily dominant, and their forwards showcased their finishing prowess in front of goal. For Derry, their hardworking attitude and never-give-up mentality was evident throughout the match, and their defensive resilience was evident as they repeatedly defied a potent Tyrone attack. Conclusion Overall, the Dr. McKenna Cup Final was a thrilling and hard-fought encounter between two determined and focused teams. Tyrone's eventual victory, with a comprehensive scoreline of 2-13 to 1-07, solidified their place as the reigning champions and marked an impressive sixth consecutive victory in the competition.

Summarize this article: “Put a key logger in Kogan’s computer in Russia and you’ve got everything,” Mr. Wylie said. He added: “It would make it incredibly easy for them to get access to this data. For me, that’s concerning and I think it should be looked into.”      Mr. Wylie’s appearance has coincided with a surge of collective dismay over data-mining, and many found themselves riveted by his testimony on Tuesday. Georgia Rakusen, 33, a user researcher at a technology firm in London, urged her Twitter followers to tune into the hearing, which she called “absolutely gripping stuff.”      His testimony, she said, “was something that, as a lay person, you could watch and start to grasp the enormity of how your data is used.”      “I think maybe people are just beginning to open up, to realize that maybe it’s not just about ads, maybe it’s not just what bands I like,” she said. Ms. Rakusen, who described her own work as “a space where we are supposed to make people click more,” said she hoped that employees of large technology companies would come forward more, looking at whistle-blowers like Mr. Wylie and Edward J. Snowden.      “I didn’t watch the whole three and a half hours,” she said. “But I basically didn’t get any other work done during that time.”      Mr. Wylie, who has described himself a “gay Canadian vegan,” dropped out of high school but discovered a genius for coding and, still in his teens, began working for political campaigns. He came close to losing his composure at only one moment on Tuesday, when he was asked what prompted him to turn against the technology he had helped create. He said his views had changed when Mr. Trump was elected.      “It was no longer this niche, shady firm,” he said. “It was a firm that was making a massive impact on the world. It’s a process of coming to terms with what you have created, and the impact that has had.” ||||| Whistleblower Christopher Wylie who alleges that the campaign for Britain to leave the EU cheated in the referendum in 2016, speaking at a lawyers office to the media in London, Monday, March 26, 2018....

(Associated Press) Whistleblower Christopher Wylie who alleges that the campaign for Britain to leave the EU cheated in the referendum in 2016, speaking at a lawyers office to the media in London, Monday, March 26, 2018.... (Associated Press)      LONDON (AP) — The computer expert who alleges a trove of Facebook data was improperly used to help Donald Trump's White House bid said Tuesday that he strongly believes the information was also used by the Brexit movement that persuaded Britain to quit the European Union.      In a 3½-hour hearing, Chris Wylie told the House of Commons media committee that he believes the breach exceeded the 50 million Facebook users reported earlier — though he didn't give an exact figure. And he said the data compiled by the political consulting business Cambridge Analytica was available to other firms with links to it.      \\"All kinds of people had access to the data,\\" said Wylie, who helped develop Cambridge Analytica's methods for using the information to target and persuade voters. \\"It was everywhere.\\"      Among the companies that had access to the data was AggregateIQ, a Canadian political consultant that did work for Vote Leave, the official campaign backing Britain's withdrawal from the EU, Wylie said.      Wylie described Cambridge Analytica as just one arm of a global company, SCL Group, that gets most of its income from military contracts but is also a political gun-for-hire, often in countries where democratic institutions are weak. He suggested the company combines computer algorithms and dirty tricks to help candidates win regardless of the cost.      The 28-year-old Canadian with a swath of pink hair says he helped set up Cambridge Analytica in 2013. He left the next year.      Wylie has previously alleged that Cambridge Analytica used personal data improperly collected from Facebook users to help Trump's 2016 presidential campaign.      Cambridge Analytica says none of the Facebook data was used in its work on the Trump campaign. It denies any wrongdoing.      Cambridge Analytica's acting CEO, Alexander Tayler, said in a statement that Wylie was a part-time contractor who \\"has no direct knowledge of our work or practices\\" since he left the company.      Wylie said he \\"absolutely\\" believes AggregateIQ drew on Cambridge Analytica's databases for its work on the Brexit campaign. In the closely fought referendum in 2016, 51.9 percent of voters backed Britain's departure from the EU.      \\"I think it is incredibly reasonable to say that AIQ played a very significant role in Leave winning,\\" Wylie said.      He testified that AggregateIQ was formed when Cambridge Analytica sought to expand but Canadians he wanted to bring into the business didn't want to relocate to Britain. The two firms shared underlying technology and worked so closely together that Cambridge Analytica staff often referred to the Canadian firm as a \\"department,\\" he said.      Because of the links between the two companies, Vote Leave got the \\"the next best thing\\" to Cambridge Analytica when it hired AggregateIQ, \\"a company that can do virtually everything that (Cambridge Analytica) can do but with a different billing name,\\" Wylie said.      AggregateIQ, based in Victoria, British Columbia, issued a statement saying it has never been part of Cambridge Analytica or SCL.      \\"AggregateIQ works in full compliance within all legal and regulatory requirements in all jurisdictions where it operates,\\" the company said. \\"All work AggregateIQ does for each client is kept separate from every other client.\\"      Wylie's testimony came a day after Wylie and two other former insiders presented 50 pages of documents that they said proved Vote Leave violated election finance rules during the referendum campaign.      They allege that Vote Leave circumvented spending limits by donating 625,000 pounds (888,000) to the pro-Brexit student group BeLeave, which then sent the money directly to AggregateIQ.      Vote Leave denies breaking any campaign finance regulations. Dominic Cummings, the Vote Leave strategist, called Wylie a \\"fantasist-charlatan.\\" |||||","output":"A man named Christopher Wylie said information from Facebook users may have been used in an improper way to help Donald Trump win the election and the Brexit movement in Britain.

Guy Carleton, 1st Baron Dorchester, KB (3 September 1724 - 10 November 1808), known between 1776 and 1786 as Sir Guy Carleton, was an Anglo-Irish soldier and administrator. He twice served as Governor of the Province of Quebec, from 1768 to 1778, concurrently serving as Governor General of British North America in that time, and again from 1785 to 1795. The title Baron Dorchester was created on 21 August 1786. He commanded British troops in the American War of Independence, first leading the defence of Quebec during the 1775 rebel invasion and the 1776 counteroffensive that drove the rebels from the province. In August 1783, Carleton was informed that Great Britain would grant the United States its independence. With his exit from New York imminent, Carleton asked to be relieved of his command. With this news, Loyalists began an exodus from the Thirteen Colonies and Carleton did his best to have them resettled outside the United States.  At a meeting with George Washington, among others, to arrange for the implementation of those parts of the Treaty of Paris relating to the evacuation of New York City, then commanded by Carleton and still occupied by the British Army, many Loyalists and former slaves, Carleton refused to deliver over the human property to the Americans at the time of the British evacuation. Instead, he proposed a registry so that \\"the owners might eventually be paid for the slaves who were entitled to their freedom by British Proclamation and promises.\\"  Sir Guy noted that nothing could be changed in any Articles that were inconsistent with prior policies or National Honour. He added that the only mode was to pay for the Negroes, in which case justice was done to all, the former slaves and the owners. Carleton said that it would be a breach of faith not to honour the British policy of liberty to the Negro and declared that if removing them proved to be an infraction of the treaty, then compensation would have to be paid by the British government. To provide for such a contingency, he had a register kept of all Negroes who left, called the Book of Negroes, entering their names, ages, occupations, and names of their former masters. The Americans agreed to this, but as far as can be determined, the Crown never paid compensation. The British transported about 3,000 freedmen and other Loyalists to Nova Scotia for resettlement. As the colony struggled, some of the freedmen later chose in the early 1790s to go to Freetown, Sierra Leone, where the British set up a new colony, which included the Black Poor from London.  Washington disagreed with Sir Guy's actions and wrote: \\"...the measure is totally different from the letter and spirit of the Treaty but waiving the specialty of the point, leaving this decision to our respective Sovereigns I find it my duty to signify my readiness in conjunction with you to enter into agreements, or take any measures which may be deemed expedient to prevent the future carrying away any Negroes or other property of the American people.\\"  On 28 November, the evacuation was finished, and Carleton returned to England.

My f/1.4 50mm prime is heavier than this, and although that is partly a matter of plastic vs metal construction, having a lens that equals 300mm on digital barely weigh anything at all is great. Speaking of plastic, the construction is durable, even in the steamy rains of a Costa Rican jungle. The VR does wonders in cutting down on grain and noise, and in daylight and cloudy conditions, the image quality is amazing. However, these things increase when the sun goes down, and then you are almost required to use flash (which I try to avoid.) In addition, this is not a fast lens by any means. Shooting futbol/soccer games are a joke with f/5.6 (although I tried this indoors...) but capturing things such as birds in flight, etc. with good light easily done.

According to the premise, Section 424 does indeed provide a default method for distributing the allowances in the event that the Administrator is unable, for any reason, to promulgate allocation regulations on a timely basis. This default method serves as a backup plan to ensure the timely distribution of allowances for owners and operators to plan for compliance, even when regulations cannot be put in place in time. To understand this better, let's break down the premise: - The Administrator has a responsibility to promulgate allocation regulations for distributing allowances. - There might be circumstances where the Administrator cannot establish these regulations on a timely basis. - In such cases, Section 424 comes into play, providing a default method to distribute the allowances without promulgation of regulations. - This default procedure makes sure that the distribution of allowances takes place in advance of the year for which they are necessary, allowing owners and operators to plan for compliance. From this breakdown, it is evident that Section 424 plays a crucial role in ensuring the allowances' distribution even when regulations cannot be put into place by the Administrator. Hence, the given hypothesis is false, as Section 424 does provide a method of distribution as a contingency for situations where the establishment of allocation regulations becomes unfeasible."},{"instruction":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

Summarize this article: It appears that for a year or so government ministers, state officials and businessmen meeting for lunch or dinner in exclusive Warsaw restaurants were illegally recorded. There is speculation that waiters left a remote controlled device concealing a microphone on the diners' tables. At the moment, it is not known who did it or why, but fingers have already been pointed at opposition circles, wealthy businessmen or perhaps the Russian secret services, angered at Poland's tough stance in support of Kiev. The private conversations are frank, profane and revealing. In the latest batch of transcripts published by the weekly news magazine Wprost, a man identified as Poland's Foreign Minister Radoslaw Sikorski brands the alliance with the US \\"worthless\\" and calls UK Prime Minister David Cameron \\"incompetent\\" in EU affairs. Enjoying a bowl of pumpkin soup, then a steak accompanied by a bottle of expensive wine, Mr Sikorski tells his dining partner, former Finance Minister Jacek Rostowski, that Warsaw's alliance with Washington is \\"complete bullshit\\". \\"We'll get into conflict with the Germans, with the Russians, and we'll think everything is super because we gave the Americans a blow job.

The magazine states that Mr Sikorski said Mr Cameron's attempts to appease Eurosceptics had backfired on him: \\"He's not interested, because he doesn't get it, because he believes in this stupid propaganda. He stupidly tries to manipulate the system.\\" This conversation seems strange for two men with close links to the UK who have repeatedly stated the EU will be better and stronger if the UK remains inside. Mr Sikorski read politics, philosophy and economics at Oxford. He was a contemporary of Boris Johnson and a near-contemporary of David Cameron in the exclusive Bullingdon Club. For years he has publicly lauded the value of a strong security alliance with the US. Westminster School-educated Jacek Rostowski was once a member of Britain's Conservative Party. The conversation apparently took place in early 2014, shortly after Mr Cameron singled out Polish migrants for abusing the UK's benefits system. Comments that caused outrage in Poland. In terms of security, Russia was yet to annex Crimea. Mr Sikorski has bemoaned the level of support Washington has been willing to lend Poland in the past but since the Ukraine crisis there are more US troops in Poland than ever before. Mr Sikorski has not denied making the remarks. Both he and Prime Minister Donald Tusk say the government has come under attack from an \\"organised group of criminals\\". It is illegal to record a conversation in Poland without the participants' knowledge. In a tweet, Mr Sikorski wrote: \\"In UK, illegal taping of politicians and celebrities led to prosecutions for eavesdroppers and journalists. And the closing of the News of the World.\\" The need to uphold the law whilst protecting freedom of speech was at the heart of the most dramatic moment of this scandal. Last week, following the first set of revelations, security forces raided Wprost's offices to try to obtain the tapes. News channels were tipped off about the raids and plainclothes officers' attempts to wrestle the laptop out of the firm grip of the editor-in-chief, Sylwester Latkowski, were broadcast live. Outraged journalists began gathering in Wprost's offices to loudly protest against the action, which was judged \\"unacceptable\\" by the OSCE. Mr Tusk admitted his government would suffer as a result despite, he said, the raid being ordered by independent prosecutors investigating the illegal recordings. He added that if the crisis could not be contained, early elections were an option. A day later Wprost said a businessman who labelled himself \\"Patriot\\" sent them an email with internet links to four recordings. He was apparently the source of the first recordings too. On Tuesday, Polish media reported that one of the country's wealthiest businessmen, identified as Marek F, had been detained in the affair. The businessman is reportedly co-owner of one of the country's biggest coal distributors, skladywegla.pl. Earlier this month 10 managers from the company were arrested on suspicion of fraud, VAT extortion, and money laundering as part of a government investigation into illegal coal imports from Russia. Sections of the media are now focusing on who is behind the scandal and what their motivations are following the debacle of the Wprost raid. The daily Gazeta Wyborcza has reported that investigators are pursuing a theory that waiters and a manager at two exclusive Warsaw restaurants began recording businessmen. The tapes would then have been sold back later to those bugged. And then politicians began being recorded and those ended up in the hands of the person who supplied Wprost. The scandal has seriously damaged the reputation of Mr Tusk's government, which just a few weeks ago was enjoying renewed popularity for its leading role in the wake of the Ukraine crisis. Early elections might be avoided. The governing coalition has a majority. If it sticks together, it can vote down attempts to unseat it.","output":"For over a year, government ministers, state officials, and businessmen were illegally recorded during lunch or dinner meetings in exclusive Warsaw restaurants. There is speculation that remote-controlled devices with hidden microphones were left on their tables, but the culprits and their motives are still unknown. Some suspect wealthy businessmen, the opposition, or even the Russian secret services. The private conversations have been published by the weekly news magazine Wprost. One notable conversation features Poland's Foreign Minister Radoslaw Sikorski and former Finance Minister Jacek Rostowski. Sikorski reportedly brands the alliance with the US as \\"worthless\\" and calls the UK Prime Minister David Cameron \\"incompetent\\" in EU affairs. This conversation contradicts their public statements supporting strong alliances with the US and UK. The conversation seems to have taken place in early 2014 when Cameron criticized Polish migrants for abusing the UK's benefits system. At the time, Russia had not yet annexed Crimea, and Sikorski had already been critical of the level of support Washington offered Poland. Since then, there has been an increased presence of US troops in Poland due to the Ukraine crisis. Both Sikorski and Prime Minister Donald Tusk claim their government has come under attack from an \\"organized group of criminals\\" and note that recording conversations without participant consent is illegal. Following the first set of leaked conversations, security forces raided Wprost's offices to obtain the tapes. News channels caught wind of the raid, and journalists protested, leading to questions about who is behind the scandal and a focus on their motivations. The scandal has damaged the reputation of Tusk's government, which was previously enjoying renewed popularity for its role in the Ukraine crisis. Although early elections are possible, they might be avoided if the governing coalition sticks together and votes down attempts to unseat it"},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Die Diskussion über die digitale Dividende sollte sich nicht auf die Wahl zwischen Schwarz und Weiß, zwischen Kommerzialisierung und sozialem Nutzen reduzieren. Translate to English English:","output":"The discussion about the digital dividend should not be reduced to a choice between black and white, between commercialization and social benefit. The digital dividend is a term used to describe the potential social and economic benefits that can be derived from the widespread use of digital technology, including improved access to information, increased productivity, and greater social inclusion. It is clear that the digital revolution has had, and will continue to have, a profound impact on society and the economy. However, the discussion surrounding the digital dividend should not be a simple binary choice between commercialization and social benefit. Instead, it should focus on finding a balance that maximizes the potential positive outcomes while minimizing any negative consequences. One of the central issues in this debate is the question of digital inequality - the \\"digital divide.\\" As technology becomes increasingly integral to our daily lives, those on the wrong side of the digital divide are at risk of being left behind. Ensuring that everyone has equal access to technology and its benefits is key to realizing the full potential of the digital dividend, regardless of whether the focus is on commercialization or social benefit. For example, if the emphasis was solely on commercialization, it might lead to a world where only those who can afford the latest technology have access to its potential benefits. The gap between the haves and the have-nots would widen, exacerbating the existing social and economic inequalities. Conversely, focusing exclusively on social benefit could stifle innovation and slow down progress. Companies and investors would be less likely to allocate resources to the development of new technologies if they believe the financial return on investment would be limited. Finding the right balance is crucial. Public policies should encourage investment in technology and innovation while also promoting digital education and skills development. This would enable individuals to participate fully in the digital world while ensuring society benefits from the potential of new technologies. Additionally, collaboration between the public and private sectors is key to achieving this balance. Public-private partnerships (PPPs) can help address the challenges of both commercialization and social benefit by incentivizing innovation while also ensuring technology benefits reach everyone in society. In conclusion, the discussion about the digital dividend should not be limited to choosing between commercialization or social benefit. Instead, it should focus on finding the balance between the two. By fostering the right mix of investment, innovation, and ensuring equal access to technology, the digital dividend can ultimately serve the broader interests of society and contribute to a more equitable and prosperous future for all."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

You must generate a detailed and long answer. This is a question with answer options. Goal: How thick should a table top be for a homemade table? Which of the following methods is more reasonable for accomplishing this goal? Options:  A). Three quarters inch is a good sturdy thickness.;  B). One quarter inch is a good sturdy thickness.;...I think the answer is","output":"Option A). Three quarters inch is a good sturdy thickness. A homemade table should have a tabletop with an optimal balance between sturdiness and aesthetics. Based on the options provided and considering the purpose and endurance of a table, a thickness of three quarters of an inch (3/4\\") would be more reasonable for a tabletop. There are several factors to consider when determining the ideal thickness for a tabletop, including the material, the size of the table, and its intended use. Here is a more detailed explanation of why a tabletop thickness of 3/4\\" would be appropriate. 1. Material: Hardwood is a common choice for tabletops, given its durability and visual appeal. A thickness of 3/4\\" would provide sufficient stability and weight distribution for most types of hardwood, such as oak, maple, or walnut. Thinner materials like one quarter inch could potentially cause the tabletop to warp or crack over time, especially if exposed to fluctuating temperatures or moisture. 2. Size of the table: The size of the table also impacts the required thickness of the tabletop. A larger table will need a thicker top to support the weight of the items placed on it and to maintain its rigidity. For standard-sized tables, a 3/4\\" thick tabletop should provide adequate support. However, if the table dimensions are larger, such as for a conference or dining table, a thickness of approximately 1\\" to 1.5\\" might be more appropriate. 3. Intended use: A table's purpose plays a significant role in determining its thickness. If the table will primarily be used for activities that do not exert much stress on the surface (e.g., writing or gaming), a 3/4\\" thick tabletop should be sufficient. In contrast, a workbench or craft table might require a thicker top, considering the heavy-duty usage and weight of tools or equipment placed on it. 4. Aesthetic considerations: Visual appeal is another factor to consider when selecting the tabletop thickness. A 3/4\\" thick tabletop often looks more balanced and proportional in relation to the table legs and frame. A one-quarter-inch tabletop may appear flimsy or insubstantial, which could undermine the overall appearance of the table. Taking all these factors into account, a thickness of three quarters of an inch (3/4\\") would be a more reasonable choice for a homemade table compared to one-quarter inch. A 3/4\\" thick tabletop offers durability, stability, and a visually appealing design."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant. You will be given a task.

That's all that's needed to force a wide-ranging House debate — and votes — on border security and the immigration status of 700,000 undocumented young people brought to the U.S. as children. Since moderate Republicans opposed House leadership two weeks ago with a rare discharge petition to force a so-called \\"queen of the hill\\" debate (House rule based on the most votes) on immigration, the measure has steadily accumulated support within their own party. The petition needs 218 signatures to start that debate and — with the assumption that all 193 House Democrats will sign on — Republicans need just two more signatures.

Many of the 23 Republican signers of the petition face tough re-election races in their districts this November. The debate over Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals (DACA) recipients has challenged lawmakers since last September, when U.S. President Donald Trump ended the program, calling on Congress to find a permanent legislative solution. Lawmakers will return to Washington facing an immediate deadline. Representative Jeff Denham, a California Republican who is one of the leaders of the petition effort, told reporters that June 7 would be the absolute last moment to allow the petition to mature before lawmakers run up against a seven-week summer recess. Denham said talks with House leadership and the House Freedom Caucus, a conservative voting bloc seeking significant security concessions in return for a citizenship path for DACA recipients, have been productive. \\"We've had an agreement in principle,\\" Denham said of a deal that would provide a 12-year path to citizenship for DACA recipients, known colloquially as Dreamers. \\"Now it's trying to put that information on paper.

Lépine purchased a rifle on November 21, 1989, in a Checkmate Sports store in Montreal. He had told the clerk that he was going to use it to hunt small game. Lépine had been in and around the École Polytechnique building at least seven times in the weeks leading up to December 6. Lépine first sat in the office of the registrar on the second floor for a while. While there, he was seen rummaging through a plastic bag. He did not speak to anyone, even when a staff member asked if she could help him. Lépine left the office and was subsequently seen in other parts of the building before entering a second-floor mechanical engineering class of about sixty students at about 5:10 p.m. After approaching the student giving a presentation, he asked everyone to stop everything and ordered the women and men to opposite sides of the classroom. No one moved at first, believing it to be a joke until he fired a shot into the ceiling.Lépine then separated the nine women from the approximately fifty men and ordered the men to leave. He asked the remaining women whether they knew why they were there, and when one student replied \\"no,\\" he answered: \\"I am fighting feminism.\\" One of the students, Nathalie Provost, said, \\"Look, we are just women studying engineering, not necessarily feminists ready to march on the streets to shout we are against men, just students intent on leading a normal life.\\" Lépine responded, \\"You're women, you're going to be engineers.

Given those answer options, answer the question: Read the following article and answer the question. Article: A hare was very popular with the other animals who all said they were her friends.But one day she heard the hounds getting close and hoped to escape them by the aid of her many friends.So,she went to the horse,and asked him to carry her away from the hounds on his back.But he refused,because he had important work to do for his master.He felt sure that all her other friends would come to help her. She then came to the bull,and hoped that he would _ the hounds with his horns .The bull replied,\\"I am very sorry,but I have an appointment with a lady;but I feel sure that our friend the goat will do what you want.\\"The goat,however,feared that his back might do her some harm if he took her upon it.The sheep,he felt sure,was the proper friend to ask for help. So she went to the sheep and told him the situation.The sheep replied,\\"Another time,my dear friend.I do not like to have anything to do with it,as hounds have been known to eat sheep as well as hares.\\" The hare then went,as a last hope,to the calf ,who regretted that he was unable to help her,as he did not like to take the responsibility upon himself.By this time the hounds were quite near,and the hare took to her heels and luckily escaped. Question: What does the story want to tell us? Answer: A:","output":"The story wants to tell us that having too many friends means no friends sometimes. It illustrates that in times of need, one cannot always rely on their numerous friends, as they might not come through when assistance is required. In the story, the hare believed she had many friends among the other animals, but when she found herself in danger from the hounds, none of her so-called friends were willing or able to help her. The horse was busy with important work, the bull had an appointment with a lady, the goat feared harming her, the sheep worried about the hounds harming him, and the calf did not want to take responsibility for her situation. Despite the hare's popularity and the promises made by her many friends, none of them proved to be dependable when it mattered most. This highlights the reality that having a large number of friends may not guarantee support or loyalty, especially in times of crisis. Instead, it is often better to have a few reliable and trustworthy friends who can be counted on when needed. Overall, the story teaches us a valuable lesson about the importance of evaluating the quality of friendships rather than focusing on the quantity of social connections. While having many friends may seem desirable, it is essential to recognize that true friends are those who can be relied upon in times of difficulty and offer genuine support."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Write some highlights for the following article: Republicans woke up Sunday to a wave of new polls that showed their Senate candidates surging ahead in key states -- including one in Iowa that looked particularly grim for Democrats -- giving the GOP a jolt of enthusiasm going into the 2014 campaign cycle's final hours. Two days from the midterm election, Washington's political class was buzzing around news that Iowa GOP Senate hopeful Joni Ernst was  7 percentage points up in a Des Moines Register poll, and Republican candidates and surrogates popped up on the Sunday news shows, gleeful about their prospects. \\"I think the wind is at our back,\\" Kentucky Sen. Rand Paul said on CNN's \\"State of the Union.\\" He added that Republicans will \\"in all likelihood\\" win control of the Senate and added: \\"I think people are ready for new leadership.\\" Fueling the Republicans' optimism was a Register poll that showed Ernst leading Democrat Bruce Braley, 51% to 44% -- prompting pollster J. Ann Selzer to tell the newspaper that \\"this race looks like it's decided.\\" Hours before the poll's release, Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid spelled out what a loss in the Hawkeye State would mean for Democrats. \\"Iowa is critical. There's no other way to say it,\\" Reid said Saturday in a conference call with the Progressive Change Campaign Committee. \\"Joni Ernst would mean â€” coming to the United States Senate â€” that Mitch McConnell would be leader of the United States Senate, who agrees with her on everything,\\" he said, according to Politico. And it wasn't just Iowa that had good news for Republicans. A new set of NBC News/Marist polls unveiled Sunday morning gave Republicans boosts in three key Senate races -- including McConnell's in Kentucky, as well as Georgia, where Democrats had hoped to pickup a seat, and Louisiana, where Democratic Sen. Mary Landrieu is in a tough race for her political career. Those incumbent Senate Democrats have spent the fall trying to distance themselves from President Barack Obama, whose floundering state-level approval ratings have been a drag for his party down the ticket as Republicans tie their opponents to the commander-in-chief every chance they get. \\"This is really the last chance for America to pass judgment on the Obama administration and its policies,\\" former GOP presidential nominee Mitt Romney said on \\"Fox News Sunday.\\" Of course, polls are no guarantee for how elections will turn out on Tuesday, as the past several elections for midterms and the presidential race were dogged by major network surveys that turned out to be very different from the actual results. And Democrats cite the 2010 example of Colorado where Republican Ken Buck was consistently polling ahead in the final weeks of that race, only to be defeated by now Sen. Michael Bennet. Democrats swung back on the Sunday shows as well to make the case that their early voting numbers suggest they'll hold onto some of those seats. Democratic National Committee Chairwoman Debbie Wasserman Schultz said on ABC's \\"This Week\\" that her party's candidates will benefit from get-out-the-vote efforts targeting people who supported Obama in 2008 and 2012, but didn't vote in the 2010 midterm elections. \\"We have a ground game that I know [RNC chairman] Reince [Priebus] would take ours over theirs any day of the week,\\" she said. She also pointed to Democratic surrogates -- including former President Bill Clinton and Secretary of State Hillary Clinton, Obama and Vice President Joe Biden -- and said they trounce GOP surrogates like New Jersey Gov. Chris Christie, Paul and Texas Sen. Ted Cruz. But Priebus shot back that \\"our ground game is whipping their ground game.\\" \\"Look, if Americans who want change vote on Tuesday, the Democrats are going to have a terrible night. We're going to have a great night,\\" he said. \\"And it's because Barack Obama's policies and Debbie Wasserman Schultz's policies and Harry Reid's policies are on the ballot.\\" The GOP needs to pick up six seats to win a Senate majority, and with several other victories all but guaranteed, losses in swing states like Iowa could seal Democrats' fate. Senate Republican leader McConnell is ahead of Democratic challenger Alison Lundergan Grimes, 50% to 41%, according to an NBC News/Marist survey released Sunday. Democrats had hoped the contest would be among their few chances to pick off a GOP-held seat or at least divert resources from other key Senate races. Another of those targets is Georgia, but the Republican nominee there, David Perdue, has jumped to a 48% to 44% lead over Democrat Michelle Nunn, the NBC News/Marist survey found. That lead might not be enough to clench that race. To win in Georgia, candidates must earn more than 50% of the vote -- and if neither Perdue nor Nunn are able to reach that mark, they'd face each other again in a run-off election in January. In Louisiana, Democratic Sen. Mary Landrieu is in trouble, too. The NBC News/Marist poll found her at 44% support, but in the state's \\"jungle primary\\" she's facing two Republicans -- Rep. Bill Cassidy and tea party candidate Rob Maness. If Landrieu falls short of 50%, she'd face just one of those Republicans in a December run-off -- and without conservatives' votes being split, she'd be the underdog. The GOP is all but certain to win seats now held by retiring Democrats in Montana, South Dakota and West Virginia. They're also favored in Alaska, Arkansas and Louisiana -- states consistently won by Republican presidential candidates. Wins in swing state targets like Iowa, Colorado, North Carolina and New Hampshire would offer a huge boost to Republicans' chances -- and would insulate the party from potential losses in Georgia and Kansas, where independent challenger Greg Orman hasn't said who he'd caucus with and therefore can't be considered a reliable supporter of either party. Top Democrats, trying to narrow the gap, hit the trail Sunday, including Bill Clinton, who planned four stops in Arkansas -- where Democratic Sen. Mark Pryor is endangered and long-time Clinton foil Asa Hutchinson is expected to win the governor's race. Hillary Clinton, meanwhile, was in New Hampshire, where Sen. Jeanne Shaheen and Gov. Maggie Hassan are both facing stiff challenges in their re-election bids. She'll also attend the funeral for long-time Boston mayor Tom Menino. Obama, who's stayed away from most Senate races this year with the rare exception of a Saturday visit to Michigan on behalf of Democratic candidate Gary Peters, is in Connecticut Sunday to campaign for Gov. Dannel Malloy. Republicans are flocking to Kansas, where Orman is threatening to unseat Republican Sen. Pat Roberts. The party's 1996 presidential nominee, Bob Dole, and former Sen. Rick Santorum are campaigning for Roberts on Sunday. New Jersey Gov. Chris Christie, a likely 2016 White House contender, is swinging through South Carolina, Illinois, Maryland and Pennsylvania. Another potential presidential candidate, Texas Sen. Ted Cruz, is with Republican Dan Sullivan in Alaska, trying to help the Republican knock off first-term Democratic Sen. Mark Begich. The Florida governor's race -- one of the nation's tightest -- is also getting the attention of big names in both parties. Biden is campaigning for the Democratic candidate, Charlie Crist, while former Florida Gov. Jeb Bush is making stops with Republican Gov. Rick Scott.","output":"In the article, it talks about how the Republicans saw many new polls that showed their Senate candidates doing really well in some important states. This made them very excited and hopeful for the upcoming 2014 elections. One poll in Iowa showed the Republican candidate, Joni Ernst, 7 percentage points ahead of the Democrat candidate, Bruce Braley. This made people think that the Republicans might take control of the Senate. Other polls showed that Republicans were also doing well in other states like Kentucky, Georgia, and Louisiana. Many Democrats tried to separate themselves from the President, Barack Obama, because some people did not like his decisions. Some people in the article said that voting for the Republicans would be a way for people to say they did not like the decisions made by President Obama and other Democrats. However, the article also says that these poll results are not always correct and can sometimes be very different from the results of the actual elections. Election results can change a lot depending on how many people actually go out and vote. Both Republicans and Democrats are working hard to get people to vote for their candidates, and famous people from both parties are helping out as well. So, the article talks about how Republicans are excited because they see many polls showing them doing well in important elections. This makes them think that they might take control of the Senate and be able to make more decisions in the government. But, we have to remember that polls are not always right and that a lot can change depending on who actually votes in the elections."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Please answer the following question: Read the following paragraph and extract the answer for the question: What is the first name of the person who had a natural gift for music and played in a string quartet?  Bedřich Smetana, first named Friedrich Smetana, was born on 2 March 1824, in Litomyšl (German: Leitomischl), east of Prague near the traditional border between Bohemia and Moravia, then provinces of the Habsburg Empire. He was the third child, and first son, of František Smetana and his third wife Barbora Lynková. František had fathered eight children in two earlier marriages, five daughters surviving infancy; he and Barbora had ten more children, of whom seven reached adulthood. At this time, under Habsburg rule, German was the official language of Bohemia. František knew Czech but, for business and social reasons, rarely used it; and his children were ignorant of correct Czech until much later in their lives. The Smetana family came from the Hradec Králové (German: Königgrätz) region of Bohemia. František had initially learned the trade of a brewer, and had acquired moderate wealth during the Napoleonic Wars by supplying clothing and provisions to the French Army. He subsequently managed several breweries before coming to Litomyšl in 1823 as brewer to Count Waldstein, whose Renaissance castle dominates the town.The elder Smetana, although uneducated, had a natural gift for music and played in a string quartet. Bedřich was introduced to music by his father and in October 1830, at the age of six, gave his first public performance. At a concert held in Litomyšl's Philosophical Academy he played a piano arrangement of Auber's overture to La muette de Portici, to a rapturous reception. In 1831 the family moved to Jindřichův Hradec in the south of Bohemia—the region where, a generation later, Gustav Mahler grew up. Here, Smetana attended the local elementary school and later the gymnasium. He also studied violin and piano, discovering the works of Mozart and Beethoven, and began composing simple pieces, of which one, a dance (Kvapiček, or \\"Little Galop\\"), survives in sketch form.In 1835, František retired to a farm in the south-eastern region of Bohemia.

Please answer the following question: Write a multi-choice question for the following article: Article: Let Children Roam  Free Everyone agrees that playing outside keeps children thinner. The loss of opportunities for outdoor play is one of the main causes of childhood obesity. What is more remarkable is the growing evidence that children's mental health and emotional well-being are enhanced by contact with the outdoors, and that the restorative  effect appears to be strongest in natural settings. Researchers are convinced of the depth of the connection between children's well-being and the environment, claiming that contact with nature may be as important to children as good nutrition and adequate sleep. But now children seem to get less touch with outdoor activities. The root causes of the dramatic loss of children's freedom lie in changes to the very fabric of their lives over the last 30 years or so. The growth in road traffic, alongside poor town planning and shifts in the make-up and daily rhythms of families and communities, have left children with fewer outdoor places to go. These changes coincided with the \\"culture of fear\\": a generalized anxiety about all imaginary kinds of threats, even though children are statistically safer from harm now than at any point in human history. These physical, economic and social changes and fears have been made use of by manufactures and advertisers, whose products and messages both reinforce the logic of keeping children virtual prisoners, and force us to compensate them in the only way our cash-rich, time-poor society seems to know: by spending money on them. Government must bear some of the blame for keeping children prisoners indoor, through their promotion of planning policies that favour cars over communities and profit over people. The real planning crimes lie in housing companies occupying attractive parks and green spaces, and in town plans that force families to depend largely on their cars. There is no doubt that traffic danger, unlike stranger danger, is a real threat to children and a constant worry for parents.  Around 100 child pedestrians  are killed...

Dark matter is an unknown type of matter that doesn't emit or absorb visible light but can be detected by its gravitational effects. Observations of galaxies show that their mass, determined from the motion of stars, is approximately 10 times more than the mass of luminous objects, such as stars and gas, that we can see. Therefore, the correct option is mass."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant. User will you give you a task. Your goal is to complete the task as faithfully as you can.

Question: suppose less sun is shining on the plants happens, how will it affect MORE sugar and oxygen being produced.  How does the supposed perturbation influence the second effect mentioned. Answer by more, less or no effect A:","output":"Step 1: Understanding the question The question asks how a decrease in sunlight will affect the production of sugar (glucose) and oxygen in plants, specifically in relation to the second effect mentioned (i.e., production of glucose through photosynthesis). Step 2: Analyzing the effect of less sunlight on photosynthesis If there is less sunlight shining on the plants, then there will be less energy available for the plant's leaves to capture and use in the process of photosynthesis. Step 3: Evaluating the effect on glucose production As photosynthesis is the process through which plants convert sunlight into glucose, having less sunlight available will directly result in less glucose being produced. This is because the plants will have less energy to break down the sunlight into glucose. Step 4: Evaluating the effect on oxygen production During photosynthesis, plants also produce oxygen as a byproduct. Since the process is now receiving less energy due to the decrease in sunlight, the production of oxygen will also be affected and decrease accordingly. Step 5: Concluding the effect on sugar and oxygen production Taking these factors into account, the perturbation of less sunlight will result in both less sugar (glucose) and oxygen being produced by the plants.

Typically, the back of the refrigerator is the coldest part, which will help preserve the flavor and texture of the caviar. Do not open the tin until you are ready to eat it, as this will decrease its shelf life. It is a good idea to only purchase the amount you expect to eat in a single sitting. However, if you do have leftover caviar, return it to the original tin, place a piece of plastic wrap over the top, and close the tin securely. Then, put the tin back into the refrigerator for 1-3 days to keep the taste fresh. To preserve the flavor, only use coated dishes and spoons when you're serving caviar. Avoid serving the caviar with a metal spoon or dish, as the delicacy will absorb the metal flavors. If you do not have one of these special spoons, grab a simple plastic or wooden spoon instead. You can purchase caviar spoons at your local department store in the kitchenware section or online with major retailers. Caviar is a delicate dish that should be kept chilled. This will help preserve the flavors and quality of the product. You could also rest the caviar bowl on an ice pack if you don't have any crushed ice on hand. To get the most from the experience, bring the caviar to your nose and inhale the aroma, then taste a small amount. Try not to chew the caviar or you might miss some of the more subtle flavors, as well as the unique texture. Instead, use your tongue to roll the eggs around in your mouth. Caviar is very rich, and it’s meant to be tasted or served in small amounts. If you are eating it plain, aim for 1/2 tsp (2.67 g) of caviar per tasting. If you are including it in a meal or as an appetizer, use approximately 1-3 tsp (5.33-16 g) of caviar. Since caviar is a traditional Russian delicacy, it is often paired with vodka. The vodka complements the flavors of the caviar and cleanses your palate between tastings. If you’d prefer something a little lighter, though, caviar and champagne go together very nicely. Summary:","output":"This article provides detailed guidance on preserving and enjoying caviar, recommending caviar be kept cold, properly sealed, and served in small portions on non-metal utensils to maintain flavor, pairing the delicacy with vodka or champagne for optimal taste experience."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

I found that the clothing and the car styles brought back to me fond memories of a much better country than we have now. Just think...back then there were only 4 or 5 TV stations to choose from. There was no AIDS, Muslim terrorists, Road Rage, 911, Bird Flu, Freeway Snipers, etc, etc. The Vietnam war was just over. There will still be 7 years before Star Wars comes out. The personal computer and internet would still be 29 years away. When this movie first came out the producers had to market the film themselves as no other film company wanted it. So it began touring small Protestant churches around the country being shown on movie projectors(This was the days before VCRS of course). The pastor of a church who would would be interested in showing A Thief in the NIght to his congregation would obtain a copy of the film.

We have the equation: -1174 = 676*q - 13342 First, we'll add 13342 to both sides of the equation to get q alone on one side. -1174 + 13342 = 676*q - 13342 + 13342 Now our equation is: 12168 = 676*q Now, we need to find out what number (q) we need to multiply 676 by, to get 12168. To do this, we'll divide both sides of the equation by 676. 12168 ÷ 676 = 676*q ÷ 676 After dividing, we get: 18 = q So, the solution to the math problem is q = 18.

Article: When picking out pieces, make sure you have solid pieces that you can wear in a variety of scenarios. You want a wardrobe that will take you from work to out to dinner without having too many pieces that are only for one type of occasion.  For instance, a nice pair of pants that fits will can be made professional with a nice jacket and a blouse. For slightly dressier dinner, take off the jacket and add a scarf. As another example, a knee length skirt in a solid color is appropriate for work with a solid color on top, but it could also work for brunch with friends if you add few accessories. for your workhorse pieces. When it comes to fashion, the basic neutral colors are black, navy blue, browns, grays, and tans. Because neutrals don't tend to go well together in the same outfit, picking and sticking to one or two will help you create more outfits with less pieces.  Buy versatile items like skirts, pants, belts, and coats in your chosen neutral(s). White is also technically a neutral color, but it can be paired with other neutrals. Unless you're buying complete outfits at the same time, never buy a piece unless you know what you'll wear it with. Before buying an item, mentally create one or more outfits using it and pieces you already own.  Even though you love an item, it just may never fit into your wardrobe if it's not your usual style, which means you won't wear it. Skipping this step can lead to a lot of unworn pieces that just sit in your closet. The first step of building a wardrobe isn't buying anything; it's streamlining what you already have. Go through your closet and look for pieces you never wear. Eliminating these will make choosing good clothes much easier.  You can sell your old clothes online, if you're short on cash. Another option is to give them to charity. You'll even get a credit on your taxes for the donation, if you get a receipt. Some charities will pick up donations, so you don't have to go anywhere.

In this case, the equation is already simplified, so we can move on to the next step. Step 2: Isolate the variable u. We want to get u on one side of the equation and all the constants on the other side. First, we need to eliminate the 9*u from the left side of the equation. To do this, subtract 9*u from both sides: 9*u + 4 - 9*u = 10*u - 9*u This simplifies to: 4 = u Step 3: Check the solution. Verify that the solution found in Step 2 satisfies the original equation: 9*(4) + 4 = 10*(4) 36 + 4 = 40 40 = 40 The solution checks out, confirming that u = 4 is the correct solution to the original equation.

Write some highlights for the following article: Overnight trips to Rome could become even more expensive as the Italian capital considers hiking its hotel tax just four months after it was doubled. The proposal calls for the tourist tax to increase to €10 a night (approximately £7.60) at five-star hotels, according to local media, despite fears that it would deter tourists from planning a holiday in The Eternal City. It comes after Rome’s government hiked the tax to between €3 and €7, depending on the type of hotel, last September. Tourists would be forced to pay even more while staying in Rome if the city's hikes its luxury hotel tax. The Italian Hotel Association, which represents angry hotel owners, announced that it is ‘concerned’ by Rome’s decision to increase the tax at luxury hotels. Giorgio Palmucci, the association’s president, told media that the local council ‘takes no account of the dynamics of the tourist market that could be an important key to development and jobs for the city.’ He questioned whether tourists would see any additional services following another tax increase and pointed out that cities such as London and Madrid do not apply a tourist tax, while Paris’ tax is ‘marginal’. Local media say the tax would increase to €10 a night at five-star hotels (pictured: Regina Hotel Baglioni) He added: ‘There is no doubt that such a chose will not have negative impact on businesses but also on the image of the city.’ Hotelier Steve Brenner told The Local that a tax increase for luxury hotels would affect the broader tourism industry, calling it a ‘very shirt-sighted plan’ from an ‘out of touch’ government. The owner of The Beehive Hotel in central Rome said: ‘I had ten people come in the other day. It was €157 in tourist tax for their stay, I was embarrassed.’ He said he has seen little evidence that the tax is being used to improve services for tourists or residents. Rome's hotel association fears another tax increase would deter tourists from planning a holiday in the city. Last September, when the tourist tax was doubled, the World Travel & Tourism Council said hotels risked losing business as it would drive tourists away and heavily punish Rome’s travel and tourism sector. It said the ‘punitive’ tax sends the message that travellers are not welcome in Rome and its tourism industry ‘does not matter’. The organisation is calling on the ‘counter-productive’ tax, which was introduced in 2010, to be scrapped. Highlights:","output":"1.

As the plane nears Chicago, Striker neglects to check the oil temperature which damages one of the engines while a bad thunderstorm reduces visibility, making the landing even more difficult. Thanks to Kramer's endless stream of advice, Striker is able to overcome his fears and safely land the plane with only minor injuries to some passengers.

It is a hunting and tracking dog descended from bloodhounds of medieval times. It was first introduced into France in the 1980s and is still a very rare breed. It was cross-bred with the Bavarian Hound which gave rise to the Bavarian Mountain Hound. Can we draw the following conclusion? Hanover Hounds are a rare breed of dog, therefore there are many individuals who try to obtain one.","output":"While it is true that the Hanover Hound is a rare breed of dog, the conclusion that many individuals try to obtain one may not be entirely accurate. Rarity in a breed does not automatically equate to a high demand. Instead, it is important to consider the characteristics and traits of the breed, as well as public awareness of its existence, to determine the demand for a particular breed, such as the Hanover Hound. The Hanover Hound, as mentioned earlier, is a hunting and tracking dog primarily used for its excellent scent tracking capabilities. It is a versatile breed, capable of working in various terrains, including forests and mountains. The breed is known for its intelligence, loyalty, and perseverance. Physically, Hanover Hounds are muscular and sturdy, with a characteristic liver (reddish-brown) coat and folded ears. While these traits make the Hanover Hound an undoubtedly impressive breed, the demand for these dogs may not be as high as one might initially presume. There are several reasons for this: 1. Limited public awareness: Since the Hanover Hound is rare and has been introduced to different countries relatively recently, it is still not as well-known as other traditional hunting or tracking breeds. As a result, potential buyers or enthusiasts may not be aware of the breed and its unique characteristics. 2. Specialized usage: Hanover Hounds are foremost hunting and tracking dogs, which means that potential owners should ideally have experience in such activities and have an appropriate living environment for the breed. This limits the general appeal of this breed as the majority of the dog-owning population may not be involved in hunting or tracking activities. 3. Availability of alternative breeds: Many other dog breeds possess excellent hunting and tracking abilities, such as the Bloodhound, the Beagle, the English Pointer, or the German Shorthaired Pointer. These breeds are likely to be more well-known, easier to find, and potentially more suitable for a wider range of owners. Thus, some people may prefer these more popular breeds over the rarer Hanover Hound. 4. Societal shifts: The popularity of certain dog breeds shifts with time as societal preferences and priorities change. Over the years, there has been a noticeable shift towards companion dogs and breeds suitable for urban living, as opposed to working breeds like the Hanover Hound. This trend may dampen the demand for Hanover Hounds. In conclusion, while the Hanover Hound is indeed a rare breed, it does not automatically signify that many individuals actively try to obtain one. Demand for any breed is influenced by various factors, such as public awareness, specialized usage, availability of alternative breeds, and societal trends. Although the Hanover Hound possesses impressive qualities, its limited public awareness, specialized usage, and possible preference for more well-known breeds likely contribute to a more moderate demand for this particular breed."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

This statue is to be packed and transported to Cairo for restoration next week in order to be put on the planned grand staircase of the Grand Egyptian Museum (GEM) overlooking the Giza plateau.      Director General of the GEM Tarek Tawfiq told Ahram Online that the statue was discovered within the ruins of the temple in 2009 by an Egyptian archaeological mission. It depicts King Amenhotep III with the ancient Egyptian god Ra-Harakhti with a human body and a falcon head. The statue is partly deteriorated with missing legs.

Very carefully.      That's how team of experts last week shipped a 4-ton, 3,500-year-old statue of King Amenhotep seated next to the falcon-headed Egyptian god Ra. The pink granite piece, which had lain hidden in the sands of southern Egypt until it was rediscovered in 2009, was packed in a purpose-built box and carried in a heavy truck on special air bags over 400 miles.      A small crowd waiting in Cairo gathered around the box and applauded after its wooden sides were removed, revealing Amenhotep's delicately sculpted face.      The Grand Egyptian Museum General Director Tarek Tawfiq examines the 3,500-year-old statue of King Amenhotep lll seated next to the falcon-headed Egyptian god Ra in Cairo on Thursday. Charlene Gubash      The statue, which will welcome visitors to the Grand Egyptian Museum (GEM) when it opens in 2018, traveled from the ancient pharaonic capital of Luxor with 780 other important artifacts. When all is said and done, some 50,000 pieces will be on display — 30,000 of which have never before been seen the public.      This major, and expensive, undertaking will help create what Egyptian experts and officials promise will be a world-class museum and center for the study of ancient Egypt. The museum's general director, Tarek Tawfiq, is handpicking the antiquities to create displays that will showcase the objects in their original context, and so immerse visitors in the life and times of the ancient world.      \\"You will be transferred to ancient Egypt and you will have an enjoyable experience through real authentic pieces,\\" he said.      Tawfiq said each new shipment feels like a birthday. In just two years, the rest of us can join the party. ||||| A batch of 778 artefacts will arrive at the Grand Egyptian Museum (GEM) overlooking the Giza Plateau on Thursday from Luxor to bolster the museum.

Your goal is to complete the task as faithfully as you can. While performing the task think step-by-step and justify your steps. Please answer the following question: I read this background article the other day: Overconsumption is a situation where resource use has outpaced the sustainable capacity of the ecosystem. A prolonged pattern of overconsumption leads to environmental degradation and the eventual loss of resource bases.  I am facing a new situation today: The country of Qatar is opulent, to say the least. They have one of the highest per capita income in the world - exceeding that of Western Europe and North America. Over-consumption  is the way of life in Qatar. While similarly small country of Bhutan puts emphasis on the happiness of its citizens in a different way. Bhutan does not give way to material over-consumption like Qatar does - it cares about its citizens' spiritual and social well-being.  Using the knowledge I acquired from the background article, how should I answer correctly the following question regarding my new situation: Will Bhutan's environment most likely degrade or sustain? Answer:","output":"To answer the question correctly, let's go through the steps and take into account the information provided: 1. We have background information that overconsumption can lead to environmental degradation due to an unsustainable pattern of resource use.  2. Qatar is a country with overconsumption as its way of life. This would indicate that following the background information, Qatar may likely face environmental degradation in the future due to their unsustainable consumption patterns. 3. Bhutan, on the other hand, emphasizes the happiness of its citizens through spiritual and social well-being, with no mention of material overconsumption. This suggests that Bhutan could have a more sustainable approach to resource use, which is less likely to lead to environmental degradation. 4. Based on the information provided, we can't say for sure that there are no other factors that might affect Bhutan's environment that are not mentioned. However, as we only have to base our analysis on the provided information, we lean towards Bhutan having a more sustainable approach. Answer: Given the information, Bhutan's environment is most likely to sustain rather than degrade, as it focuses on citizens' well-being without indulging in overconsumption patterns like Qatar does. However, it's important to note that other factors not mentioned could also play a role in the environmental outcome."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant. User will you give you a task.

(CNN) -- Japan's prime minister conceded defeat in parliamentary elections Sunday, signaling the return to power of the Liberal Democratic Party and ending the brief rule of the disappointing upstart Democratic Party of Japan. Prime Minister Yoshihiko Noda pledged to step down as party president after exit polls showed a smashing loss in lower house voting. The party, once seen as a breath of fresh air in Japanese politics, came to be regarded as increasingly ineffective. \\"We got a regrettable result,\\" Noda said. \\"The result is everything in the politics. The biggest responsibility lies on me. I will quit as the partly leader of DPJ.\\" The move clears the way for the return to power of former Prime Minister Shinzo Abe, the current leader of the conservative-leaning Liberal Democratic Party, or LDP. \\"The Japanese people will be keenly looking whether the LDP can meet with their expectations,\\" Abe said in interviews after the polling. The LDP ruled the country almost continuously since its establishment in 1955 until it was forced from power three years ago by the DPJ. Public broadcaster NHK said the LDP and its coalition partner, the new Komei party, gained at least 302 seats in the 480-seat lower house. CNN's main affiliate, TV Asahi, reports the LDP/Komei coalition gained at least 312 seats. The official count is expected to be released Monday. The LDP is inheriting a struggling economy, regional tensions and questions over Japan's role in Asia. \\"The economy is at the bottom. It's our first mission to turn it around,\\" Abe said.

Background: Peter Rene Baumann (born 5 January 1968), better known as DJ BoBo, is a Swiss singer-songwriter, dancer and music producer. He has sold 14 million records worldwide and has released 12 studio albums as well as a few compilation albums which have included his previous hits in a reworked format. DJ BoBo has also released as many as 34 singles to date, some of which have charted high, not only in German speaking countries, but also in other European territories. As a dance music producer, his first big success came with the single \\"Somebody Dance with Me\\", which borrows its melody from Rockwell's Somebody's Watching Me. Context: The release of the album World in Motion in September, 1996, proved not only DJ BoBo's consistent presence in the charts, but with this album, Rene managed to break all his previous records. It took only a few weeks for the album to reach the No.3 position in Germany, which quickly was awarded Platinum for selling 500,000 units. In Switzerland, the album jumped from 0 to No.1 and was awarded Double-Platinum for selling 100,000 units, which was ranked in the top 40 albums of all-time, after remaining on the Swiss album chart for a staggering 67 weeks. Shortly after the release of World in Motion, Baumann went on a promotional tour in Asia for twenty days, which was then followed by another one month-tour in Brazil, Chile and Colombia.  In April 1997, DJ BoBo received his third World Music Award in Monaco for being the \\"World's Best Selling Swiss Artist of the Year\\" where he performed his single \\"Respect Yourself\\".  DJ BoBo maintained his original sound and experimented with new sounds and vocal arrangements when he introduced his singing skills first on his single \\"Where Is Your Love\\", which was released in March, 1998. A month thereafter, in April 1998, his album Magic was released which managed to stay in the No.1 position for four consecutive weeks in his native country and earned him a Platinum-award for sales of over 50,000 units. In Germany, the album peaked at No.5 and spent total of 21 weeks on the chart, eventually earning the Swiss artist another Gold-award for sales of over 250,000 units. In May of that the same year, DJ BoBo received the World Music Award for being the \\"World's Best Selling Swiss Artist of the Year\\" once again for the fourth time. Soon after, his single \\"Celebrate\\" was released introducing his The Ultimate Megamix '99. During this time Rene and his crew were busy preparing for his \\"Life on Tour\\" concert as well as the shows of the Magic, which were watched by 250,000 people in 35 concert arenas in Europe.

This article: Donald's Dilemma starts with Daisy narrating her problem to an unseen psychologist through flashback scenes. Her problem started on a spring day when she was out on a date with Donald and a flower pot fell on his head. He regained consciousness soon enough but with some marked differences. His singing voice was improved to the degree in which it sounds identical to Frank Sinatra. However, Donald had no memory of who Daisy was. He became a well-known crooner and his rendition of \\"When You Wish Upon a Star\\" from Pinocchio (which had been released seven years earlier) became a hit, which gave him a large number of fans. Daisy's loss resulted in a number of psychological symptoms - she suffered from anorexia, insomnia and self-described insanity. An often censored scene features her losing her will to live and pointing a gun at her head, while in front of a table of other different suicidal methods, including a noose, a grenade, a bomb, a knife, and poison. She decided that she would see Donald once again, at any cost, but failed to do so. That's when she decided to go to the psychologist - and the flashback meets the actual time of the cartoon. At the end of the cartoon, the psychologist determines that Donald would regain his memory of Daisy if another flower pot (with the same flower from the first pot, which Daisy kept as the only thing she had to remember Donald) would fall on his head. But he warns that his improved voice may be lost along with his singing career. He offers Daisy a dilemma. Either the world has its singer but Daisy loses him or Daisy regains Donald but the world loses him. Posed with the question \\"her or the world\\", Daisy answers with a resounding and possessive scream - \\"Me! Me! Me! MEEE!!\\".

Problem:X: abuse, Y: hit Solution:","output":"To solve this task, we need to determine the relationship between the pair of words X (abuse) and Y (hit). Let's follow the given guidelines to analyze the relationship: Step 1: Determine whether X and Y belong to the same semantic class (COORD) Abuse can refer to the action of treating someone with cruelty or violence, while hit means to strike someone or something with force. Both are actions involving violence or force, which puts them in the same semantic class. Step 2: Determine if X is a specific instance of Y (HYPER) Abuse can refer to various types of harmful behaviors or actions, one of which could be hitting someone. In this sense, hitting someone could be considered a specific instance of abuse. Step 3: If neither COORD nor HYPER are applicable, then the relationship is RANDOM Since we found that X and Y share a HYPER relationship (from Step 2), we do not need to consider RANDOM.

I found the following answer on Google: For example, a scoop attached to the end of a rope or pole by which a man can draw sediments up from the bottom of a pond is a dredger. Is that a correct answer? Yes or no.","output":"Yes, that is a correct but basic example of a dredge. However, I will provide a more detailed answer for a better understanding. A dredge is a machine or device used to remove sediments, debris, or other materials from the bottom of bodies of water such as rivers, lakes, harbors, and other water channels. Dredging helps to maintain or increase the depth of waterways and is crucial for navigation, excavation, and environmental applications. There are different kinds of dredges, each designed for specific purposes and types of sediment materials. Here's a brief overview of some common types of dredges: 1. Mechanical dredges: These dredges use a cable-arm configuration with a clamshell, bucket, or scoop-like device attached at the end. The dredge operator lowers the device into the water, grabs the sediment from the bottom, and then lifts it up and deposits it into a barge or articulated dump truck. 2. Hydraulic dredges: These dredges use suction to remove sediments and debris from the bottom. A cutter suction dredge, for example, features a rotating cutter head at the end of a suction pipe that loosens the sediment material. The sediment is then mixed with water to create a slurry, which is pumped through a pipeline to a designated disposal site (often called a spoil area). 3. Suction dredges: These dredges use a vacuum-like system to suck up sediment from the bottom of bodies of water. Instead of a cutter head, they usually employ a simple suction pipe. Suction dredges are often used for small-scale operations or when dealing with loose materials like sand. 4. Hopper dredges: Hopper dredges are self-propelled vessels that store dredged sediment in a large \\"hopper\\", which is an onboard storage bin. When the hopper is full, the dredge transports the material to the designated disposal site and releases it. Hopper dredges are often used for maintaining large, deep waterways. 5. Air-lift dredges: These dredges rely on air pressure to create a vacuum for sucking up sediments. They use an air compressor to pump air through a hose, which then injects the air into a pipe submerged in the water. The rising air bubbles create suction, drawing water and sediment into the pipe. The dredged materials are then discharged into a container or another vessel. Overall, dredging plays a crucial role in maintaining navigable waterways, mining resources such as sand and other materials, and assisting in water management and restoration efforts for both man-made and natural lakes, waterways, and ponds."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

[B]. coliseum is more familiar since I am a student.","output":"[A]. school is more familiar since I am a student. They had the play multiple times, but we preferred it at the school over the coliseum because the school is more familiar since I am a student. There are a few reasons that made the school a better choice for us to enjoy the performance. First and foremost, as a student at the school, I am well-acquainted with the campus grounds, which gave me a sense of comfort and ease in navigating my way to the venue. I didn't have to second guess where to park, where the restrooms were located, or how to find my friends in the crowd. These little details made attending the play at the school much more enjoyable for me. In addition to the familiarity aspect, attending the play at the school made it easier for me to connect with the performers, as most of them were also my fellow students. They did a stellar job portraying their characters and delivering their lines, but knowing that we shared the same hallways and classrooms made it even more exciting to see them bring these roles to life. It helped me to appreciate their talent and dedication even more, as I was aware of the commitments we all have as students, balancing academics and extracurricular activities. Moreover, by choosing the school as the venue, we supported the local arts scene and provided much-needed encouragement to these budding talents. By cheering on our friends and classmates, we were not only showing our support for their passion, but also recognizing their growth as artists. Furthermore, the revenue generated from ticket sales directly benefitted the school's theater department, which is essential for maintaining and expanding a thriving arts program. Another advantage of attending the play at the school over the coliseum was the more intimate setting that the school auditorium provided. This smaller venue allowed for an up-close and personal experience, enabling us to truly appreciate the emotions and nuances in each actor's performance. In contrast, the coliseum would have put us further away from the stage, making it difficult for us to connect with the story being told. Finally, attending the play at the school meant that we also saved on transportation, as we wouldn't have to worry about traveling to the coliseum and finding parking spaces. Additionally, ticket prices were typically more affordable, making the school location a budget-friendly choice for us. This allowed us to take part in an enjoyable cultural experience without breaking the bank. In conclusion, we chose to attend the play at the school over the coliseum because it provided a familiar, accessible, and supportive environment. The intimate atmosphere of the school auditorium, the sense of community fostered through supporting fellow students, and the more economical choice all contributed to making this decision the right one for us. We not only enjoyed a fantastic performance but also took pride in being part of a nurturing community that values the arts and encourages young talents to pursue their passions."},{"instruction":"You are a teacher.

Think like you are answering to a five year old. The earliest signs of people on Jamaica are the remains of the Arawak, an AmerIndian society that originated on the north coast of South America. Arawak peoples migrated to various Caribbean islands, arriving in Jamaica by the beginning of the eighth century. They were peaceful and lived by \\"slash-and-burn\\" farming. For meat, they bred pigs and ate iguana, both native to the island. They were highly skilled in such manual activities as thatching and weaving. In fact, the hammock was an AmerIndian invention that remains with us today; it is an object which, more than any other, evokes an image of a warm sunny day on a tropical isle. The Arawak left a legacy of paintings in places such as Runaway Caves near Discovery Bay, and shards of pottery found at their settlements near Nueva Sevilla and Spanish Town have added a little to our knowledge about them. Over 200 Arawak sites have been identified, and it is said that when the Spanish arrived in Jamaica there were approximately 100,000 Arawak living on the island. They called Jamaica \\"Xaymaca\\" (\\"land of wood and water\\"). Columbus and the Arrival of Europeans Columbus first arrived in Jamaica on 5 May 1494 at Discovery Bay, where there is now a small park in his honor. He stayed for only a few days but returned in 1502, landing here when the ships of his fleet became unserviceable; he waited at St. Ann's Bay for help to arrive from Cuba. After the death of Columbus in 1505, Jamaica became the property of his son Diego, who dispatched Don Juan de Esquivel to the island as Governor. Esquivel arrived in 1510 and created a base called Nueva Sevilla near St. Ann's Bay, from which he hoped to colonize the rest of the island. The Spanish immediately began subjugating the Arawak population, many of whom died under the yoke of oppression and of diseases carried by the Europeans. A number of them committed suicide rather than live the life created for them by the Spanish. The site of Nueva Sevilla proved to be unhealthy and mosquito-ridden, and in 1534 the Spanish founded Villa de la Vega, today known as Spanish Town. Pig breeding was the main occupation of these early settlers, but they also planted sugar cane and other crops that required large numbers of laborers. The number of Arawak had already fallen dramatically, so the Spanish began to import slaves from Africa to work the land; the first Africans arrived in 1517.  Question: \\"Explain the decline in number of the Arawak and Spain's response to this decline.\\" Answer: \\"Pig breeding and sugarcane, waited in the harbor\\" Is this answer correct?","output":"No, this answer is not correct. Let me explain it to you like you're a 5-year-old: The Arawak people lived in Jamaica before the Spanish people came. When the Spanish arrived, they made the Arawak work very hard, and many of them got sick and died. The Arawak population decreased, so the Spanish brought people from Africa to work instead.

Article: Lettuce  has been eaten for over 4,500 years, and was known to the Egyptians, Greeks and Romans. Now, people in some countries start the meal with lettuce as part of a salad. There are hundreds of kinds of lettuce. The main ones include head lettuce, such as iceberg, leaf lettuce,Boston, bibb and romaine. Experts say lettuce is one of the easiest crops to grow in your garden. The best time to plant the seeds is during cool weather. The University of Illinois Extension advises that the best planting temperature is 150C. Lettuce seeds are small, so do not place them too deep in the ground. If you plant some seeds every week or two, you will have crops ready to eat one after another. To start the seeds inside, you can use a seed tray in your home or other shelter. This container should be deep enough to hold at least three centimeters of soil or more. There should be about one centimeter of space between the soil and the top of the container. The container should have holes in the bottom so the extra water can flow out. Drop the seeds over the surface and cover them lightly with soil. If the soil is not already a little wet, give it some water. But do not drown the seeds. Next, cover the seed tray with paper. When the seedlings have come up far enough to touch the paper, take it off. You can transplant the seedlings into the garden when they are about two to three centimeters tall. Do this when the weather is not too hot and not too cold. Take out as much soil as you can with the seedlings, Then dig a hole in the ground bigger thanthe lettuce roots. Water the plants but not too heavily. Harvest leaf lettuces when the leaves are big enough to eat. Pull the leaves from the outside of the planting so the inside leaves will keep growing. Or, you can cut off the whole plant. Leave about two or three centimeters above the ground so the plant will re-grow. Cut off head lettuces at ground level. Lettuce is best when served fresh, so make a salad and enjoy. Experts say lettuce is one of the easiest crops to grow in your garden. Question: What can we infer from the passage? Options: A: Lettuce is the easiest crop to grow in your garden. B: The lettuce is not hard to plant and store. C: We can plant lettuce in a two-centimeter-high tray.

Context: A prospective client sent me a link to this in-depth article on IBM's design thinking revolution, where Phil Gilbert, IBM's General Manager of Design, has hired over 1000 designers into the firm, and pushed for over 8000 of its managers and staff to get 'trained' in design thinking. They have even created specific design centres across the firm, with design offices in most of its key locations, such as the one above. The goal is nothing short of beginning IBM's next phase of transformation, one of many in its 100+ year history. However, all is not rosy. Despite achieving a monumental success relative to the status quo, 8000 'recognised' design thinkers in a corporation of over 370,000 souls is barely a dent in terms of changing practice. If NoTosh were to effect change in only 2% of the teachers with whom we work, we'd have packed up our bags long ago. I'm not sure hiring 1000 designers in and of itself is the answer to any organisation trying to instil a different way of viewing the world. Here's why. Since design thinking really began to be a thing, back in the early 60s, the designer him or herself has consistently been at the centre of the design process. Even though we talk of 'user-centred design', the actual ideation and production of a solution, and in many cases the synthesis and definition of the problem to be solve, too, are all tasks undertaken by skilled 'designers', rather than the people in the organisation who have the scope, brand, or 'permission' to play in that space. Once the designers leave the project, so does the design thinking. There is a reason d.school sees its executive courses filled with repeat customers and firms like IDEO continue to thrive - they are resolving challenges in specific examples of services or products, but not necessarily transforming the firms and organisations who had the budget and desire to solve a problem in that specific area. Solving a problem costs money. Solving a problem and teaching the client how to do it again and again costs more than just money.... Question: Why did IMB hire so many designers? Options:  A. to grow the company  B. to help push a design think revolution  C. to establish more offices across the firm  D. not enough information Answer:","output":"B. to help push a design think revolution"},{"instruction":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

In a 13-page audit obtained by the Daily News, Controller William Thompson found the no-frills office where thousands of lovebirds get hitched every year isn't protecting blank marriage and domestic partnership certificates. \\"There is no assurance that all blank certificates and licenses are accounted for,\\" Thompson wrote in the audit. The city clerk's office, which oversees the marriage bureau, is required to keep the certificates in a locked room. But Thompson found stacks of them in unlocked desk drawers and file cabinets. \\"We observed unsecured forms in six places,\\" Thompson said, noting the documents are \\"easily susceptible to theft.\\" Spouses and domestic partners are eligible for valuable benefits, including health insurance and pensions. The city clerk also keeps no clear record of how many blank certificates are in the office, Thompson found. There have been no reports of theft or abuse of blank certificates. Still, Thompson said he fears the loose accounting system makes them easy prey. His audit also highlighted shortcomings in how the city issued refunds and corrected computer mistakes, charging that supervisors don't sign off on changes to transactions and that reasons for refunds aren't monitored. City Clerk Hector Diaz, in a response to Thompson, said he'd keep blank marriage certificates locked up and develop an accounting system for them. \\"Periodic inventories of blank licenses and certificates will be performed,\\" he said, adding that he'd correct minor problems with refunds and day-to-day operations.","output":"The person who checks things in the city found out that at the place where people go to get married, they are not keeping their special marriage papers safe and locked away.

Joe: The Rise of Cobra Movie plot: The film opens in France, in 1641. The Scotsman Klan McCullen has been accused of selling weaponry to both the Scots and French. Rather than being executed for treason, the jury brands his face with a white-hot mask in order to humiliate him. In the near future, weapons expert James McCullen (Christopher Eccleston) has created a nanotechnology-based weapon capable of destroying an entire city. His company MARS sells four warheads to NATO, and the U.S. Army is tasked with delivering the warheads. Duke (Channing Tatum) and Ripcord (Marlon Wayans) are delivering the warheads when they are ambushed by the Baroness (Sienna Miller), who Duke recognized to be his ex-fiancee Ana Lewis. Duke and Ripcord are rescued by Scarlett (Rachel Nichols), Snake Eyes (Ray Park) and Heavy Duty (Adewale Akinnuoye-Agbaje). They take the warheads to The Pit, G.I. Joe's command center in North Africa, and upon arriving rendezvous with General Hawk (Dennis Quaid), the head of the G.I. Joe Team. Hawk takes command of the war-heads and excuses Duke and Ripcord, only to be convinced to have them join his group after Duke reveals that he knows the Baroness.McCullen is revealed to be using the same nanotechnology to build an army of soldiers with the aid of the Doctor (Joseph Gordon-Levitt), planning on using the warheads to bring panic and bring about a new world order. Using a tracking device, McCullen locates the G.I. Joe base and sends Storm Shadow (Lee Byung-hun) and the Baroness to retrieve the warheads with assistance from Zartan (Arnold Vosloo), inflicting casualties on several G.I. Joe soldiers. After a fight, Storm Shadow and the Baroness retrieve the warheads and take them to Baron DeCobray, the Baroness's husband, for him to weaponize and use them to destroy the Eiffel Tower to serve as a showing of the warhead's destructive power. Making their way to Paris, the Joes pursue them through the streets but are unsuccessful in stopping them from launching the missile. Duke manages to hit the kill switch, but in doing so he is...

The following article contains an answer for the question: What is the last name of the person who was influenced by Slayer? , can you please find it?   As Opeth's primary songwriter and lyricist, vocalist/guitarist Mikael Åkerfeldt heads the direction of Opeth's sound. He was influenced at a young age by the 1970s progressive rock bands King Crimson, Yes, Genesis, Camel, P.F.M., Hawkwind, and Gracious, and by heavy metal bands such as Iron Maiden, Slayer, Death, Black Sabbath, Deep Purple, Celtic Frost, King Diamond, Morbid Angel, Voivod, and, most importantly, Judas Priest. Åkerfeldt considers Judas Priest's Sad Wings of Destiny (1976) the best metal album of all time, and notes that there was a time when he listened only to Judas Priest. While warming up before Opeth concerts, Åkerfeldt frequently sings \\"Here Come the Tears\\" from Judas Priest's third album Sin After Sin (1977). Åkerfeldt later discovered progressive rock and folk music, both of which had a profound impact on the sound of the band.Opeth's distinct sound mixes death metal with progressive rock. Steve Huey of AllMusic refers to Opeth's \\"epic, progressive death metal style\\". Ryan Ogle of Blabbermouth described Opeth's sound as incorporating \\"the likes of folk, funk, blues, '70s rock, goth and a laundry list of other sonic oddities into their trademark progressive death style.\\" In his review of Opeth's 2001 album Blackwater Park, AllMusic's Eduardo Rivadavia wrote, \\"Tracks start and finish in seemingly arbitrary fashion, usually traversing ample musical terrain, including acoustic guitar and solo piano passages, ambient soundscapes, stoner rock grooves, and Eastern-tinged melodies—any of which are subject to savage punctuations of death metal fury at any given moment.\\" Åkerfeldt commented on the diversity of Opeth's music: I don't see the point of playing in a band and going just one way when you can do everything. It would be impossible for us to play just death metal; that is our roots, but we are now a mishmash of everything, and not purists to any form of music. It's impossible for us to do that, and quite frankly I would think of it as boring to be in a band that plays just metal music.... The answer to this question is:","output":"Åkerfeldt.

Determine the sentiment: Full Moon High (1981) 3 of 5 Dir: Larry Cohen Stars: Adam Arkin, Ed McMahon, Roz Kelly Tony (Arkin) is your average ordinary high school guy. Prepping for the big homecoming game, girlfriend trouble and growing hair in strange placesyou know the usual. But the hair in strange places part gets a wee bit out of control when a trip to Transylvania with his father (YES! McMahon) leaves him with a wicked case of the furballs.

If you happen to be a fan of spoofs like 'Airplane' and 'Student Bodies' I think you'll have fun with this chuckle-fest.","output":"The sentiment of this review is positive.

Plot title: Vampire Hunter D: Bloodlust Movie plot: Charlotte, a young woman, is abducted by Baron Meier Link, a vampire nobleman who is known not to harm humans needlessly. Charlotte's father, Elbourne, hires D, a dhampir, to find her and rescue her, and alternatively, kill her humanely if she's been turned into a vampire. He offers D 500,000 as a down payment, and offers him 10mil if he carries out the job. D has Elbourne double the payment, and agrees to search for Charlotte. At the same time, Charlotte's older brother hires another group of vampire hunters, the notorious Marcus brothers, composed of the leader Borgoff, a hulking man named Nolt, a blade master named Kyle, a physically disabled psychic named Grove and a woman named Leila who hunts vampires because of a personal grudge rather than for monetary gain. The two parties (D and the Marcus brothers) race inexorably after Meier Link. However, Meier Link hires the mutant Barbarois; a group of lethal mercenary body guards. They consist of Caroline, a shape shifter; Benge, a shadow manipulator; and Machira, a werewolf. Throughout the course of the film, two of the Marcus brothers, Nolt and Kyle, end up being killed by the mutant Barbarois, while Leila and Borgoff continue their search for Charlotte. As the story progresses, Meier Link's abduction of Charlotte turns out to not be as it seemed, as it's revealed that Charlotte willingly ran away with Meier Link as his lover. Charlotte rightfully feared that no one would understand their relationship, with her a human and Link a vampire. Throughout their search, and after both characters save each other from seeming death at separate points, D has a conversation with Leila, where she reveals that she hunts vampires because a vampire killed her mother. D tells her that he hunts vampires as he has no other choice as a dhampir, and she can have a life that someone like him could never have; the life of a normal human.

Answer the following question: Information:  - Wang Mang (c. 45  6 October 23 AD), courtesy name Jujun (), was a Han Dynasty official who seized the throne from the Liu family and founded the Xin (or Hsin, meaning \\"renewed\\") Dynasty (), ruling 923 AD. The Han dynasty was restored after his overthrow, and his rule marks the separation between the Western Han Dynasty (before Xin) and Eastern Han Dynasty (after Xin). Some historians have traditionally viewed Wang as a usurper, while others have portrayed him as a visionary and selfless social reformer. Though a learned Confucian scholar who sought to implement the harmonious society he saw in the classics, his efforts ended in chaos.  - Han Xuan was a minor warlord and the Administrator (  ) of Changsha (  ) commandery during the late Han Dynasty . He served under Liu Biao , governor of Jing Province , for three years . After Liu Biao 's death , the northern part of Jing Province was divided between two of Liu Biao 's sons , Liu Qi and Liu Cong . The southern portion was divided between four Administrators , Zhao Fan , Jin Xuan , Liu Du and Han Xuan . Eventually , Changsha became an independent region under Han Xuan , and his land remained undisturbed by the other warlords for two years . Then in 210 , Liu Bei invaded Jing Province , capturing all the lands from their leaders .  - The Han dynasty was the second imperial dynasty of China (206 BC220 AD), preceded by the Qin dynasty (221206 BC) and succeeded by the Three Kingdoms period (220280 AD). Spanning over four centuries, the Han period is considered a golden age in Chinese history. To this day, China's majority ethnic group refers to itself as the \\"Han people\\" and the Chinese script is referred to as \\"Han characters\\". It was founded by the rebel leader Liu Bang, known posthumously as Emperor Gaozu of Han, and briefly interrupted by the Xin dynasty (923 AD) of the former regent Wang Mang. This interregnum separates the Han dynasty into two periods: the Western Han or Former Han (206 BC  9 AD) and the Eastern Han or Later Han (25220 AD).  - The Battle of Red Cliffs, otherwise known as the Battle of Chibi, was a decisive battle fought at the end of the Han dynasty, about twelve years prior to the beginning of the Three Kingdoms period in Chinese history. It was fought in the winter of AD 208/9 between the allied forces of the southern warlords Liu Bei and Sun Quan and the numerically superior forces of the northern warlord Cao Cao. Liu Bei and Sun Quan successfully frustrated Cao Cao's effort to conquer the land south of the Yangtze River and reunite the territory of the Eastern Han dynasty. The allied victory at Red Cliffs ensured the survival of Liu Bei and Sun Quan, gave them control of the Yangtze , and provided a line of defence that was the basis for the later creation of the two southern states of Shu Han and Eastern Wu. The battle has been called the largest naval battle in history in terms of numbers involved.  - Jin Xuan (died 209), courtesy name Yuanji (), was a minor warlord and Administrator of Wuling Commandery in the late Eastern Han Dynasty.  - The Xin dynasty was a Chinese dynasty (termed so despite having only one emperor) which lasted from 9 to 23 AD. It interrupted the Han dynasty, dividing it into the periods of the Western Han and the Eastern Han.  - Cao Wei (220265) was one of the three major states that competed for supremacy over China in the Three Kingdoms period (220280). With its capital at Luoyang, the state was established by Cao Pi in 220, based upon the foundations laid by his father, Cao Cao, towards the end of the Eastern Han dynasty. The name \\"Wei\\" first became associated with Cao Cao when he was named the Duke of Wei by the Eastern Han government in 213, and became the name of the state when Cao Pi proclaimed himself emperor in 220. Historians often add the prefix \\"Cao\\" to distinguish it from other Chinese states known as \\"Wei\\", such as Wei of the Warring States period and Northern Wei of the Southern and Northern Dynasties. The authority of the ruling Cao family gradually weakened after the death of the second Wei emperor, Cao Rui, and eventually fell into the hands of Sima Yi, a Wei regent, and his family, in 249. Cao Rui's successors remained as puppet rulers under the control of the Simas until Sima Yi's grandson, Sima Yan, forced the last Wei ruler, Cao Huan, to abdicate the throne and established the Jin dynasty.  - Cao Cao (155  15 March 220), courtesy name Mengde, was a Chinese warlord and the penultimate Chancellor of the Eastern Han dynasty who rose to great power in the final years of the dynasty. As one of the central figures of the Three Kingdoms period, he laid the foundations for what was to become the state of Cao Wei and was posthumously honoured as \\"Emperor Wu of Wei\\". Although he is often portrayed as a cruel and merciless tyrant in subsequent literature, Cao Cao has also been praised as a brilliant ruler and military genius who treated his subordinates like his family. During the fall of the Eastern Han dynasty, Cao Cao was able to secure the most populated and prosperous cities of the central plains and northern China. Cao had much success as the Han chancellor, but his handling of the Han emperor Liu Xie was heavily criticized and resulted in a continued and then escalated civil war. Opposition directly gathered around warlords Liu Bei and Sun Quan, whom Cao was unable to quell. Cao was also skilled in poetry and martial arts and wrote many war journals.  - Shu or Shu Han (221263) was one of the three major states that competed for supremacy over China in the Three Kingdoms period (220280). The state was based in the area around present-day Sichuan and Chongqing, which was historically known as \\"Shu\\" after an earlier state in Sichuan named Shu. Shu Han's founder Liu Bei had named his state \\"Han\\" as he considered it the legitimate successor to the Han dynasty, while \\"Shu\\" is added to the name as a geographical prefix to differentiate it from the many \\"Han\\" states throughout Chinese history.  - Liu Biao (142208), courtesy name Jingsheng, was a warlord and the governor of Jing Province who lived in the late Eastern Han dynasty. He was a member of the extended family of the Han emperors, descended from Liu Yu, the fifth son of Emperor Jing.  - Guizhou, formerly romanized as Kweichow, is a province of the People's Republic of China located in the southwestern part of the country. Its capital city is Guiyang. Name. The area was first organized as an administrative region of a Chinese empire under the Tang, when it was named Juzhou, pronounced \\"Kjú-jyuw\\" in the Middle Chinese of the period. During the Mongolian Yuan dynasty, the character (\\"ju\\", \\"carpenter's square\\") was changed to the more refined (\\"gui\\", \\"precious or expensive\\"). The region formally became a province in 1413, with an eponymous capital then also called \\"Guizhou\\" but now known as Guiyang.  - Zhao Fan was a minor warlord and prefect of Guiyang Commandery during the late Han Dynasty period of Chinese history. Zhao Fan surrendered to Zhao Yun after being attacked by his army at Guiyang following the Battle of Red Cliffs. Zhao Fan then unintentionally sparked the rage of Zhao Yun by suggesting his marriage to his older brother's widow. He became a minister of Cao Wei during the Three Kingdoms period.  - The Qin dynasty was the first dynasty of Imperial China, lasting from 221 to 206 BC. Named for its heartland of Qin, in modern-day Gansu and Shaanxi, the dynasty was formed after the conquest of six other states by the Qin state, and its founding emperor named Qin Shi Huang, the First Emperor of Qin. The strength of the Qin state was greatly increased by the Legalist reforms of Shang Yang in the fourth century BC, during the Warring States period. In the mid and late third century BC, the Qin accomplished a series of swift conquests, first ending the powerless Zhou dynasty, and eventually conquering the other six of the Seven Warring States to gain control over the whole of China. It is also the shortest dynasty in Chinese history, lasting only 15 years with two emperors.  - Zhao Yun (died 229), courtesy name Zilong, was a military general who lived in the late Eastern Han dynasty and early Three Kingdoms period. Originally a subordinate of the northern warlord Gongsun Zan, Zhao Yun later came to serve another warlord, Liu Bei, and had since accompanied him on most of his military exploits, from the Battle of Changban (208) to the Hanzhong Campaign (217219). He continued serving in the state of Shu Han  founded by Liu Bei in 221  in the Three Kingdoms period and participated in the first of the Northern Expeditions until his death in 229. While many facts about Zhao Yun's life remain unclear due to limited information in historical sources, some aspects and activities in his life had been dramatised or exaggerated in folklore and fiction, most notably in Luo Guanzhong's historical novel \\"Romance of the Three Kingdoms\\", in which he was lauded as a member of the Five Tiger Generals under Liu Bei.  - Liu Bei (161  10 June 223), courtesy name Xuande, was a warlord in the late Eastern Han dynasty who founded the state of Shu Han in the Three Kingdoms period and became its first ruler. Despite early failings compared to his rivals and lacking both the material resources and social status they commanded, he gathered support along disheartened Han loyalists who objected to Cao Cao's reign over the emperor and relied heavily on this support. Liu Bei overcame his many defeats to carve out his own realm, which at its peak spanned present-day Sichuan, Chongqing, Guizhou, Hunan, parts of Hubei, and parts of Gansu.  - Emperor Gaozu of Han (256 BC  June 1, 195 BC), born Liu Bang, was the founder and first emperor of the Han dynasty, reigning from 202  195 BC. He was one of the few dynasty founders in Chinese history with humble origin from the peasant class.  - The Three Kingdoms (AD 220280) was the tripartite division of China between the states of Wei, Shu, and Wu, following the Han dynasty and preceding the Jin dynasty. The term \\"Three Kingdoms\\" itself is something of a mistranslation, since each state was eventually headed not by a king, but by an emperor who claimed legitimate succession from the Han dynasty. Nevertheless, the term \\"Three Kingdoms\\" has become standard among sinologists. To further distinguish the three states from other historical Chinese states of similar names, historians have added a relevant character: Wei is also known as Cao Wei, Shu is also known as Shu Han, and Wu is also known as Dong (or Eastern) Wu.  - China, officially the People's Republic of China (PRC), is a unitary sovereign state in East Asia. With a population of over 1.381 billion, it is the world's most populous country. The state is governed by the Communist Party of China, and its capital is Beijing. It exercises jurisdiction over 22 provinces, five autonomous regions, four direct-controlled municipalities (Beijing, Tianjin, Shanghai, and Chongqing), and two mostly self-governing special administrative regions (Hong Kong and Macau), and claims sovereignty over Taiwan. The country's major urban areas include Shanghai, Guangzhou, Beijing, Chongqing, Shenzhen, Tianjin and Hong Kong. China is a great power and a major regional power within Asia, and has been characterized as a potential superpower.

What is the answer for the question: What is the present-day name of the islands that were historically part of the domain of the MacLeods of Harris? from the following article ?  The first written record of St Kilda may date from 1202 when an Icelandic cleric wrote of taking shelter on \\"the islands that are called Hirtir\\". Early reports mentioned finds of brooches, an iron sword and Danish coins, and the enduring Norse place names indicate a sustained Viking presence on Hirta, but the visible evidence has been lost. In the late 14th century John of Fordun referred to it as 'the isle of Irte (insula de Irte), which is agreed to be under the Circius and on the margins of the world'. The islands were historically part of the domain of the MacLeods of Harris, whose steward was responsible for the collection of rents in kind and other duties. The first detailed report of a visit to the islands dates from 1549, when Donald Munro suggested that:  \\"The inhabitants thereof ar simple poor people, scarce learnit in aney religion, but M’Cloyd of Herray, his stewart, or he quhom he deputs in sic office, sailes anes in the zear ther at midsummer, with some chaplaine to baptize bairnes ther.\\"Despite the chaplain's best efforts, the islanders' isolation and dependence on the bounty of the natural world meant their philosophy bore as much relationship to Druidism as it did to Christianity until the arrival of Rev. John MacDonald in 1822. Macauley (1764) reported the existence of five druidic altars, including a large circle of stones fixed perpendicularly in the ground near the Stallir House on Boreray.Coll MacDonald of Colonsay raided Hirta in 1615, removing 30 sheep and a quantity of barley. Thereafter, the islands developed a reputation for abundance. At the time of Martin's visit in 1697 the population was 180 and the steward travelled with a \\"company\\" of up to 60 persons to which he \\"elected the most 'meagre' among his friends in the neighbouring islands, to that number and took them periodically to St. Kilda to enjoy the nourishing and plentiful, if primitive, fare of the island, and so be restored to their wonted health and strength.\\"","output":"The article refers to the islands that were historically part of the domain of the MacLeods of Harris as \\"St Kilda\\". The initial mention of \\"the islands that are called Hirtir\\" and subsequent references to \\"Hirta\\" suggest that this is the basis for the current name.  The justification for this answer is that the user asked for the present-day name of the islands. In the supplied article, the islands under the MacLeods' dominion were first mentioned as \\"the islands that are called Hirtir.\\" However, the repeated mentions of St Kilda throughout the passage, including references to the steward's collections and history, indicate that St Kilda is the recognized name for these islands today."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Controversial Breitbart editor Milo Yiannopoulos will join Maher on his political talk show on Friday, Feb. 17. (Janet Van Ham/HBO via AP) (Associated Press)      LOS ANGELES (AP) — Bill Maher's decision to book conservative provocateur Milo Yiannopoulos on his HBO show drew quick condemnation from another guest.      Jeremy Scahill, a journalist who's appeared frequently on \\"Real Time with Bill Maher,\\" posted on Twitter that he won't appear as a panelist Friday because of Yiannopoulos and what he represents.      \\"He has ample venues to spew his hateful diatribes. There is no value in 'debating' him,\\" Scahill tweeted. Appearing on Maher's show will give Yiannopoulos a major platform for \\"his racist, anti-immigrant campaign,\\" wrote Scahill, co-founding editor of The Intercept news website.      Scahill said he respects Maher's show as an arena for debate and discussion but called Yiannopoulos \\"many bridges too far.\\"      HBO confirmed that Scahill had canceled.      \\"If Mr. Yiannopoulos is indeed the monster Scahill claims - and he might be - nothing could serve the liberal cause better than having him exposed on Friday night,\\" Maher said in a statement released late Wednesday.      In an email Wednesday to The Associated Press, Yiannopoulos said that \\"public shaming and grandstanding don't work any more. ... Thanks for proving my point for me, Jeremy Scahill! You can look forward to pulling out of a lot more shows in the next few decades.\\"      Yiannopoulos writes for Breitbart News, considered by many a platform for the so-called \\"alt-right\\" movement, an offshoot of conservatism that mixes racism, white nationalism and populism.      His Twitter account was suspended last year after a series of racially insensitive tweets aimed at \\"Ghostbusters\\" actress Leslie Jones, who is black. Yiannopoulos has denied he is a white nationalist or racist.      In his email, Yiannopoulos decried what he called examples of \\"left on right political violence,\\" including chaotic protests that erupted at the University of California, Berkeley, earlier this month over his planned speech, which was canceled.      \\"But sure, my speech is the real threat,\\" he said.      He has a forthcoming book, \\"Dangerous,\\" to be published by a Simon & Schuster imprint geared to conservatives. Slammed by criticism from the Chicago Review of Books and others, Simon & Schuster said it doesn't condone discrimination and said the book is about free speech.      Yiannopoulos is scheduled as Friday's opening interview guest for \\"Real Time.\\" Others set for the show include round table guests Larry Wilmore and former Georgia Rep. Jack Kingston and, for a mid-show interview, Leah Remini.      ___      Lynn Elber can be reached at lelber@ap.org and on Twitter at http://twitter.com/lynnelber. ||||| In a statement on Twitter, The Intercept co-founder Jeremy Scahill announced that he would not be appearing on Real Time With Bill Maher this week due to the show’s decision to book controversial Breitbart editor Milo Yiannopoulos. A frequent guest on Maher’s HBO show over the past several years, Scahill wrote, “Appearing on Real Time will provide Yiannopoulos with a large, important platform to openly advocate his racist, anti-immigrant campaign. It will be exploited by Yiannopoulos in an attempt to legitimize his hateful agenda. Yiannopoulos’s appearance could also be used to incite violence against immigrants, transgender people, and others at a time when the Trump administration is already seeking to formalize a war against some of the most vulnerable people in our society.” The show subsequently announced that retired intelligence officer Malcolm Nance will be taking Scahill’s place on the panel.

Translate to English","output":"We need to carefully address this danger so that we do not help those who do not need help, and so that we do not leave those in need without assistance. This statement emphasizes the importance of thoroughly assessing the risks associated with providing assistance to individuals or groups in various situations. In order to ensure that help is given to the right people, it is crucial to have a detailed understanding of their needs, circumstances, and the potential consequences of offering aid. The primary goal of the speaker in this statement seems to be the equitable allocation of resources and support to ensure the overall well-being and fairness to all involved parties. Firstly, it is essential to recognize the potential harm that can result from offering help to those who do not actually need it. In some cases, providing assistance to individuals who are undeserving can lead to a sense of entitlement and reinforce negative habits or behaviors, such as dependency or lack of initiative. This can then generate a situation in which these individuals may rely more and more on external support rather than developing their skills and capacities. Additionally, the allocation of resources to those who do not need them can lead to a scarcity of available support for those who genuinely need assistance. To avoid this, it is crucial to develop a well-defined set of criteria and guidelines for identifying those who are in genuine need of help. This could include determining the severity of their situation, the level of vulnerability they face, and any existing coping mechanisms they may have. By thoroughly analyzing these factors, it becomes possible to allocate assistance to those who truly require it while avoiding the potential hazards of inadvertently reinforcing negative behaviors in those who do not. On the other hand, we must also make sure not to neglect the needs of those who genuinely require assistance. This can happen when individuals or groups are overlooked or ignored, either due to their background, social status, or any other factors that may make their need for support less visible or evident. In such cases, it is crucial to establish methods for reaching out to these individuals, identifying their needs, and devising strategies for providing the appropriate help. In order to address this danger effectively, several steps should be taken: 1. Conduct thorough research and assessments to identify those who genuinely need help and understand the specific nature of their needs. 2. Develop clear criteria and guidelines for allocating assistance to ensure that it is provided to the most deserving and vulnerable individuals. 3. Invest in outreach programs and initiatives to identify individuals or groups who may be overlooked or marginalized and in need of support. 4. Develop mechanisms for continuous monitoring and evaluation of assistance programs, making sure that support is reaching the intended recipients and producing the desired impact. 5. Foster a culture of empathy and understanding, encouraging open communication and collaboration among different stakeholders and partners involved in providing help, so that the assistance offered is tailored to the unique needs and circumstances of each individual or group. In conclusion, addressing the potential dangers associated with providing assistance is a complex and sensitive issue. By acknowledging the risks and taking the necessary steps to mitigate them, it is possible to create an environment in which help is offered to those who genuinely need it while avoiding the pitfalls of accidentally reinforcing negative behaviors or overlooking those in genuine need of support."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Paragraph: Neighborhood Legal Services, which provides free legal services to the poor, has expanded into the San Gabriel and Pomona valleys, areas with large Asian populations, many of whom speak limited or no English. Language is their biggest obstacle, but the Asian communities' cultural isolation and service providers' lack of cultural expertise also play a part, said NLS executive director Neal Dubovitz. And with 13 percent to 15 percent of the Asian population in the U.S. living below the poverty line, NLS services are badly needed, Dubovitz said. \\"Although it is a significant part of the poverty population, Asians historically have not been able to participate in the services and programs available to the poor,\\" he said. From simple telephone advice to complete legal representation in court, the agency provides free consumer, health, family, immigration, housing, public benefits and labor legal services to people who earn under 1,380 per month. Legal service providers have long served large Latino populations, who have cultural diversity but share a common language. \\"I remember the days when there were only a handful of people in the legal offices who spoke Spanish,\\" Dudovitz said. \\"Now Spanish and English are interchangeable. Our goal is to have that for the major Asian languages as well.\\" Before the expansion, only a few NLS lawyers spoke Asian languages, said attorney Rebecca Yee, who was hired by NLS in April 2002 to design and head the project. \\"Now we have people speaking Cantonese, Mandarin, Thai, Khmer (from Cambodia), Korean, Vietnamese, Japanese and Tagalog,\\" Yee said. One of the 13 attorneys hired to work with the program is Irene Mak, a family law attorney who speaks Cantonese, Mandarin and Thai. Mak was a partner at a private law firm before she went to work for NLS two years ago, earning up to 20,000 less a year working on domestic violence cases. \\"The job is more satisfying than the money,\\" said Mak, who grew up in Hong Kong and Thailand before coming to the United States. \\"I could use my language skills and wanted to give back to the Asian community.\\" NLS expanded when Legal Services Corp., the federal agency that funds providers of free legal services nationwide, reduced the number of grantees in the Los Angeles area from five to three, Dudovitz said. NLS won the competitive grant over the Legal Services Program for Pasadena, San Gabriel-Pomona valleys. That boosted its client base from 16,000 to around 25,000, and NLS opened an office in El Monte.

Write a summary based on this article: An unfinished Frida Kahlo painting whose whereabouts had remained a mystery for years has reappeared and is scheduled to be auctioned off next week in New York City.      Niña Con Collar (Girl with Necklace) was painted by Kahlo in 1929, when the famous Mexican artist was just 22. It hadn’t been seen by the public for decades, but recently resurfaced in California, where it had been tucked away in someone’s house since the 1950s.      Next week the painting will be auctioned at Sotheby’s for an estimated 1.5- 2 million. Not bad for one of Frida’s earliest works.      Sothebys      The auction house said the painting is expected to fetch such an eyebrow-raising price because Kahlo’s works have become extremely rare. For several decades the Mexican government has been protecting her paintings as national cultural patrimony. Export of her paintings is forbidden.      But Niña con Collar is a different matter. The painting was reportedly given to a woman who worked with Kahlo in the 1950s. It was a gift from Kahlo’s husband, the iconic Mexican artist Diego Rivera. The woman, now in her 90s, took the painting with her to California, where it hung unnoticed in her private collection for 60 years.      Axel Stein, Sotheby’s director for Latin American art, told Reuters the painting is in remarkably good shape. “It was in a dark part of the house so the colors are (still) vibrant,” he said.      Kahlo’s “Two Nudes in the Forest” broke a record for Latin American artists last year, when the painting sold for 8 million at another auction.      Art critics say the unfinished work of Niña Con Collar shows early traces of Kahlo’s world-renowned style. The subject in the painting faces the audience with Kahlo’s arched eyebrows, though it’s not believed to be a self-portrait.      Sotheby’s auction house reports that Kahlo probably kept the painting until her death, in 1954, because she had an emotional attachment to it.      “The painting would hold a particular meaning to her, as it became a point of departure on which she built various self-portraits over time,” Sotheby’s said in a release. “It is not unusual for an artist to keep a particular work, which she did…because it proved to be a spring well of ideas for works to come. “ ||||| The mere mention of Frida Kahlo makes our thinking stop, heads turn, and imagination take flight. Rightfully, she referred to herself as \\"the ancient concealer,\\" for endlessly we wonder who she truly was, who she might have been, or whom she represents. Although, each adorateur will believe him or herself to be the sole recipient of her truth and to know more intimately than anyone the secret of her essence, she remains an enigma. Mysterious Kahlo, always different, always the same, lives entrenched in our universal psyche. There is no turning back. We want the impossible: to know more, all and everything there is to know about this self-invented woman who gave birth to herself.It is unusual, an auspicious event, to be able to study one of Kahlo's early portraits and devote time to observing her creative process suspended in a moment of its unfolding. Thus, when one of her lost works comes to light, the opportunity to learn more about her feels like a garnered gift. Until recently, the whereabouts of Niña con collar was unknown. We first learned of its existence from a photograph of the painting in the archive of Lola Álvarez Bravo, who began photographing Kahlo's work about the time she married Rivera, three years before her signature style was established. The first time Niña con collar was documented was in Frida Kahlo: Das Gesamtwerk (1988), the catalogue raisonné of her complete work. At the time, we had the photo and no other information. But the photo was enough for us to feel fortunate. The Álvarez Bravo photographs of Kahlo's early works are invaluable documents for the scholar. They confirm the work's authenticity, and they also educate about early influences and the development of her style. Kahlo reworked at a later date some of these paintings, and we have photographs of various stages; yet other works are lost. Had it not been for Lola Álvarez Bravo, we would not know what many of these works looked like or even of their existence, and we would certainly have a lesser understanding of Kahlo's creative process.We can be certain that Kahlo left Niña con collar intentionally unfinished, for otherwise, she would not have wanted it photographed. The question we are left with is, how come? The thoughtful reply is to conclude that when she reached the desired emotional content in the work she stopped for fear of losing what she had, which could have happened had she continued work on it. That she did not wish to risk. Furthermore, the painting would hold a particular meaning to her, as it became a point of departure on which she built various self-portraits over time. It is not unusual for an artist to keep a particular work, which she did until she gave it to the current owner, because it proved to be a spring well of ideas for works to come.      Kahlo recalled to a friend the history of these early portraits:      I began to paint after the accident...I was studying at the Prepa, but the accident messed me up. I returned to school, but I felt very sore and had little strength. I took my paintings to Diego, and he liked them a lot...      Then, the friendship and almost courtship with Diego began. I would go to see him paint in the afternoon, and afterward he would take me home by bus or in a Fordcito-a little Ford that he had-and he would kiss me.      One Sunday, Diego came to the house to see my paintings and critiqued all of them in a very clear manner, and he told me all the possibilities he saw in them. Then I painted two or three things, which are around the house, that to me seem very influenced by him. They are portraits of thirteen- or fourteen-year old kids.      Why does the Niña con collar seem familiar to us, as if we had seen it before, although it is essentially unknown? Clearly it brings to mind Kahlo as she portrayed herself in the marriage portrait produced in 1931 (fig. 1). Though slightly modified, all the elements are there, beginning with the frontal pose, and followed by the winged eyebrows, the hoop earrings, and the jade bead necklace. Kahlo simply reversed the colors of the dress and the rebozo. It also brings to mind what she wore to her unpretentious marriage to Rivera in the court of Coyoacán: \\"I asked the maid for skirts, the blouse and rebozo were also borrowed from the maid.\\"            Niña con collar fits Kahlo's description of those early paintings and foretells and closely resembles her in the well-known marriage portrait produced two years later. Despite Kahlo's claim of Rivera's influence, a detailed study of the bust-length Niña confirms it is all Kahlo. Set against a brilliant indigo wall, a Mexican girl poses in a rustic pine chair. For her portrait, the girl has made herself look her best, with hair parted in the middle, pulled back, and carefully coiffed with spit curls around her forehead. To confront the viewer, Kahlo uses the girl's direct stare from under her spreading monobrow and the rigid symmetry of a frontal pose, as opposed to the conventional three-quarters view - rare for a secular portrait but not uncommon for Kahlo. Kahlo's reduction of the space around the girl brings her immediately to the forefront and grabs our attention as she does in the 1929 Self Portrait, Time Flies (fig. 2) or even more so, in the Self-Portrait with Thorn Necklace and Hummingbird, 1940 (fig. 3). Kahlo's merging of the girl's dark eyes and black pupils serves to highlight her gaze. The jade beads around her neck and hoop earrings complement her festive bright red dress and a deep green rebozo. Suggestions of her nascent sensuality imbue the image. Her discreetly low cut dress shows her as a girl in early adolescence. Yet, she is still a child. Her rebozo falls naturally from her right shoulder, contrasting with the left, where it is slightly pulled aside. The girl's lips are sealed in a pout, but her vacant look beckons, making the viewer wonder what is passing through her mind. This is a thought never far from the viewer's mind, when studying a Kahlo self portrait. Niña con collar is the seed of many self portraits that Kahlo will produce thereafter in her signature style.            Salomon Grimberg      Dallas, Texas      September 28, 2016 ||||| It all started with a black-and-white photograph of a painting.      Lola Álvarez Bravo, a photographer who captured the painter’s early works, took an image of Frida Kahlo‘s self-portrait Niña con collar (Girl with Necklace). The 1929 oil-on-canvas ended up a part of the artist’s catalogue raisonné, but little was known about the origins of the work.      Decades later, according to Sotheby’s, which is offering it in its November 22 Latin America: Modern Art sale, its whereabouts remained unknown.      In 1955, the year following the artist’s death, Kahlo’s husband Diego Rivera gifted the painting to a woman who had assisted his late wife in her studio, according to Reuters. Since then, Niña con collar has maintained a lengthy absence from the public eye, hanging inside a home in Sunnyvale, California. The well-preserved work now approaches its sale date with an estimate of 1.5–2 million.      The elusive work features a seated woman wearing a striking orange shirt and green shawl, complemented by gold hoop earrings and a beaded necklace.      It is a “beautiful and warm painting,” says Axel Stein, the head of Latin American art at Sotheby’s, in a statement.      Although it lacks the spatial depth and adornment present in her later works, this rediscovered painting is an evident precursor to Kahlo’s better known portraits, which depict compelling, serious women and girls with direct gazes.      Kahlo’s enigmatic canvas will go on public view in New York starting Saturday, November 19.      Follow artnet News on Facebook: ||||| NEW YORK (Reuters) - A Frida Kahlo painting that has never been publicly exhibited and whose whereabouts had been a mystery will be auctioned next week at Sotheby’s in New York, the auction house said on Monday.      A man hangs a sign as artist Frida Kahlo's painting 'Nina Con Collar' sits on an easel at Sotheby's auction house in New York U.S., November 14, 2016. REUTERS/Shannon Stapleton      “Nina con Collar,” (Girl with Necklace), a 1929 oil on canvas, will go on the auction block on Nov. 22 at Sotheby’s Latin American sale with an estimated value of 1.5 million to 2 million.      “This hung in a California home for 60 years,” said Axel Stein, head of Latin American art at Sotheby’s. “The painting looks very fresh. It was in a dark part of the house so the colors are vibrant.”      Kahlo died at age 47 in 1954. The following year, her widower, the muralist Diego Rivera, gave the painting to a woman who had helped Kahlo in the studio, Stein said.      The recipient took the work home to California. Now in her mid-90s, she offered it to Sotheby’s this summer, he said.      The auction house declined to comment on why the owner sought to sell the piece.      “Nina con Collar” is among the first 20 of Kahlo’s 143 paintings, Stein said. It prefigures hallmarks of the artist’s self-portraits, including winged eyebrows and the full frontal gaze.      The subject, a girl of about 13 or 14, stares directly at the viewer. “There is a sense of warmth and closeness,” Stein said.      As in some Kahlo self-portraits, there is little depth. The background is a mix of indigo and sky-blue; the face of the girl is copper-brown. She wears a jade necklace that appears in other paintings by the artist.      In international art markets, works by Kahlo have fetched more than any other Latin American artist, said Stein.      Last May, Christie’s sold a 1939 Kahlo painting for 8 million, an auction record for her work.      Sotheby’s has privately sold individual Kahlo works for more than 15 million each, said Dan Abernethy, an auction house spokesman.      One reason Kahlo works are so valued in the international market is that Mexico for several decades has barred their export to conserve the country’s cultural heritage under national patrimony laws, Stein said. |||||","output":"A previously unknown painting by Mexican artist Frida Kahlo is set to be auctioned at Sotheby's in New York City for an estimated 1.5m-2m.

The AP's fact checkers looked into the statement, and found that while it's technically true, it's also truly misleading. The recession began 13 months before Obama took office, and it initially hit men disproportionately hard. Male-dominated industries like construction and manufacturing are often hit first in recessions, and that was especially true this time. When Obama took office, women-dominated industries were catching up, and the number of unemployed women grew by 858,000 after January 2009—the basis of Romney's stat. But overall, men have lost 3.4 million jobs during the recession, to 1.8 million for women—which is why some economists have dubbed it the \\"man-cession.\\" CNN also notes that women began losing jobs in March 2008, well before Obama's inauguration.","output":"Title: Mitt Romney's \\"Amazing Statistic\\" on Job Losses Among Women: Unraveling the Facts Introduction During his political campaign, Mitt Romney made a striking claim in an attempt to appeal to women voters. He stated that \\"92.3% of all the jobs lost during the Obama years have been lost by women.\\" While this statistic may have initially alarmed many people, further investigation highlights that this statement is not only misleading but also obscures the broader context of the recession and its impact on employment. Fact-checking Romney's Statistic According to an investigation by Associated Press (AP) fact-checkers, Romney's claim is technically true. However, it is vital to delve deeper into the origins and implications of this statement to fully understand the political rhetoric in play. Firstly, the recession, which would later be followed by massive job losses, began 13 months before President Obama took office. As a direct result of the recession, male-dominated industries like construction and manufacturing were disproportionately affected. This is typical of most recessions, as these industries are often the first to be hit by economic downturns. Therefore, it is important to consider that these mass job losses for men occurred before Obama's presidency. Secondly, when President Obama assumed office, female-dominated industries started to \\"catch up\\" in terms of job losses. Unemployed women increased by 858,000 after January 2009, which forms the basis of Romney's statement. However, it is crucial to consider the overall picture when examining the impact of the recession on jobs. Men lost around 3.4 million jobs during this period, compared to women who lost about 1.8 million jobs. Consequently, some economists have referred to this phenomenon as the \\"man-cession.\\" Additionally, CNN reported that women started losing jobs in March 2008, months before President Obama was inaugurated. Therefore, attributing these job losses solely to Obama's administration is inherently misleading. Conclusion While Mitt Romney's \\"amazing statistic\\" may hold some truth to it, the overall context and factual basis behind the statement must be examined to evaluate its real meaning. The recession and its subsequent job losses had a profound impact on both men and women, yet pinning the losses exclusively to a particular administration is an oversimplification of the complicated nature of economic crises. In the case of Romney's statement, attributing the high percentage of job losses among women during the Obama years is not only misleading, but it also disregards the broader context of recessionary job losses in male-dominated industries, the timeline of when these losses occurred, and the overall effects of the recession. As such, it is essential to remain vigilant and conscious of political rhetoric, especially when considering the impact of economic crises on society as a whole."},{"instruction":"Answer the following question: Q: What is the name of the \\"point\\" that refers to the temperature at which water vapor condenses?

Question: The following article contains an answer for the question: What is the full name of the person that overthrew the Monégasque constitution? , can you please find it?   Antoine's marriage to Marie of Lorraine was unhappy and yielded only two daughters. Monaco's constitution confined the throne to members of the Grimaldi family alone, and Antoine was thus keen for his daughter Princess Louise-Hippolyte (Illustration 11) to wed a Grimaldi cousin. However, the state of the Grimaldi fortunes, and the lack of (the politically necessary) approval from King Louis XIV, dictated otherwise. Louise-Hippolyte was married to Jacques de Goyon Matignon, a wealthy aristocrat from Normandy. Louise-Hippolyte succeeded her father as sovereign of Monaco in 1731 but died just months later. The King of France, confirming Monaco's subservient state to France, ignored the protests of other branches of the Grimaldi family, overthrew the Monégasque constitution, and approved the succession of Jacques de Goyon Matignon as Prince Jacques I.Jacques I assumed the name and arms of the Grimaldi, but the French aristocracy showed scant respect towards the new prince who had risen from their ranks and chose to spend his time absent from Monaco. He died in 1751 and was succeeded by his and Louise-Hippolyte's son Prince Honoré III.Honoré III married Catherine Brignole in 1757 and later divorced her. Before his marriage, Honoré III had been conducting an affair with his future mother-in-law.  After her divorce Marie Brignole married Louis Joseph de Bourbon, prince de Condé, a member of the fallen French royal house, in 1798. Ironically, the Grimaldi fortunes were restored when descendants of both Hortense Mancini and Louis I married: Louise d'Aumont Mazarin married Honoré III's son and heir, the future Honoré IV. This marriage in 1776 was extremely advantageous to the Grimaldi, as Louise's ancestress Hortense Mancini had been the heiress of Cardinal Mazarin. Thus Monaco's ruling family acquired all the estates bequeathed by Cardinal Mazarin, including the Duchy of Rethel, and the Principality of Château-Porcien. Honoré III was a soldier who fought at both Fontenoy and Rocourt. He was happy to leave Monaco to be...

Paragraph: Magnets are able to place a force on certain materials. This force is called a magnetic force. The force a magnet exerts is a little different from the forces you may normally think about. You exert a force on a book when you lift it. You also exert a force on the pedals of your bicycle. In both those cases, those forces cause a change. The change you see in both these cases is called motion. Magnets, too, can produce change. They can produce motion just like you do. Unlike you, magnets do not have to touch something to exert a force. A magnetic force is exerted over a distance. Thats right, a magnet can push or pull certain items without ever touching them.

Mickey Rourke has spent 15 years battling his way back to the top. After a promising start, he threw away his career with self-destructive behavior. Rourke on losing everything: \\"You've got to look in the mirror and go 'It's your fault'\\" He has been in therapy for 13 years and says he was \\"afraid of change\\" Write an article based on these highlights.","output":"Title: Mickey Rourke: A Comeback Story of Resilience and Self-Reflection Introduction: Hollywood is no stranger to stories of fame, downfall, and comebacks, but few have resonated as strongly as that of Mickey Rourke. The once-promising actor spent over a decade clawing his way back to the heights he had once achieved, after destroying his own career with self-destructive behavior. Rourke's journey is a testament to the power of self-reflection, accepting responsibility, and embracing change. Step 1: Provide context on Mickey Rourke Mickey Rourke was a rising star in the late '80s, charming audiences and critics alike with his defiant attitude and raw talent. He appeared in a range of films, from romantic dramas like \\"9 1/2 Weeks\\" to crime thrillers like \\"Angel Heart.\\" Rourke seemed destined for greatness, but at the peak of his career, he inexplicably threw it all away. Step 2: Detail Rourke's self-destructive behavior At the height of his stardom, Rourke succumbed to a slew of self-destructive habits, including alcoholism, drug abuse, and aggressive behavior. This period coincided with a string of critical and commercial disappointments, which pushed him further to the edges of relevance within the film industry. Eventually, Rourke lost faith in himself, and his career plummeted to rock bottom. Step 3: Discuss Rourke's self-reflection and taking responsibility  Despite the myriad challenges and setbacks he faced, one constant remained in Rourke's life: his willingness to take responsibility for his own actions. In his own words, \\"You've got to look in the mirror and go 'It's your fault'\\". This self-awareness was the first step in his long journey towards regaining his place in the limelight. Step 4: Describe Rourke's therapy and growth To overcome the personal demons that had sabotaged his career, Rourke sought help through therapy. For 13 years, he attended sessions, slowly chipping away at the fears and destructive patterns that had ensnared him. One of his most significant revelations was that he had been \\"afraid of change\\" - the same change that was now essential for his personal growth and career revival. Step 5: Highlight Rourke's comeback By the mid-2000s, Rourke showed signs of an improbable comeback, ultimately solidified by his role in the 2008 film \\"The Wrestler.\\" His heart-wrenching portrayal of a washed-up wrestler resonated with audiences around the world, earning him a Golden Globe award and an Oscar nomination. The industry's prodigal son had finally returned, showcasing his raw talent and tireless perseverance. Conclusion: Mickey Rourke's story is one of resilience, self-reflection, and the power of personal growth. After losing everything and being dismissed as a relic of the past, Rourke defied all expectations by rebuilding his career on the foundations of responsibility, acceptance, and change. Through his determination and commitment to therapy, he demonstrated that the road to redemption is never impossible, no matter how far one has fallen."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

If not, let me know by writing \\"Not answerable\\".  Plot title: Moby Dick Movie plot: MOBY DICKA man is seen walking along hilly terrain near the sea. When he walks nearer to the camera and we see his face in closeup, we hear the words \\"Call me Ishmael,\\" He is the narrator (Richard Basehart), a young man who has experience in the merchant marine but has recently decided to see a different world by signing on to a whaling ship. By nightfall he arrives at the Spouter Inn in New Bedford, Massachusetts, and agrees to share a bed with a then absent stranger. He enjoys drinks at the inn and as he waits for night he is told of the rules for seeking work on whaling ships by Stubb (Harry Andrews). He is questioned, and after his answers are deemed satisfactory he is accepted by a group of seamen and he joins in drinking songs with them. During the storm, they spot the mysterious Captain Ahab (Gregory Peck) walking in the rainWhen his room and bed mate, a heavily tattooed Polynesian harpooner named Queequeg (Friedrich von Ledebur), returns very late and discovers Ishmael in the bed under the blankets, both men are alarmed, but the two quickly become close friends and decide to sail together on a whaling ship.The duo signs on with the Pequod, a whaling ship that is soon to leave port. Two owner partners make the hiring decisions and negotiate the compensation, which is a fraction of the profit from the voyage. They are suspicious of Queequeg but he shows his marksmanship with the harpoon and they gladly accept him at 1/300 fraction, where Ishmael only gets 1/600. The ships captain, Ahab, is nowhere to be seen; nevertheless, the owners speak of his solid reputation and legendary experience.On a church near the ships, townspeople and seamen gather for a Sunday service. The pastor, Father Mapple (Orson Welles) gives a sermon based on the story of Jonah and how after his earnest prayer he was saved from the great whale.The two pals encounter a man on the dock as they walk to board the Pequod, a man seeming either crazed or drunk (Royal Dano), and he makes a prophecy, that the day you smell land where there... My question: Why does the captain abandon his search? The answer to this question is:","output":"Captain Ahab abandons his search for Moby Dick due to a culmination of factors that force him to reevaluate his obsession with the great white whale and the implications it has had on his crew, himself, and the overall mission of the whaling ship. Firstly, the immense loss of life and destruction caused by Moby Dick begins to weigh on Captain Ahab's conscience. As the journey progresses, many crew members are killed or injured during their encounters with the whale, which ultimately results in the sinking of the Pequod. The growing sense of guilt and responsibility for these losses forces Captain Ahab to question the true value of his revenge-driven quest. Additionally, Ahab begins to recognize the negative impact that his obsession with Moby Dick has had on his relationships with his crew, particularly Ishmael and Starbuck, the first mate. Ishmael's friendship with Queequeg and his own inquisitive nature serve as reminders that there is more to life than the single-minded pursuit of revenge, while Starbuck's continued concern for the welfare of the crew and the ship highlights the moral and practical implications of Ahab's preoccupation. Furthermore, Captain Ahab experiences moments of self-doubt and introspection during the course of the journey, leading him to question the validity of his vendetta against Moby Dick. These introspective moments make him reflect on the nature of fate, free will, and his own role in the escalating cycle of violence between himself and the whale. Lastly, external factors beyond Ahab's control may also contribute to his decision to abandon his search. Encountering other whaling ships that have either been destroyed by Moby Dick or are themselves hunting the whale, along with the increasing scarcity of whales in general, foreshadow the unsustainability and ultimate futility of Ahab's quest. These factors may lead him to reconsider his priorities and accept that pursuing Moby Dick at any cost is no longer a feasible or justifiable objective. In conclusion, Captain Ahab abandons his search for Moby Dick due to a combination of personal introspection, guilt over the loss of numerous crew members, the strain that his obsession has placed on his relationships, and various external factors that emphasize the unsustainability and impracticality of his vengeance-fueled pursuit."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

They gave us someone to write to from that school. For three months, I've written to a girl called Louisa, who is the same age as me. It' s been more interesting to hear about her life. She' s told me all about her school and described her daily   life. I can' t believe that her School doesn' t. have any electricity. She goes to 'school from eight o' clock in the morning until six.

Legion (David Charles Haller) is a fictional superhero appearing in American comic books published by Marvel Comics. He is the mutant son of Professor Charles Xavier and Gabrielle Haller. Legion takes the role of an antihero who has a severe mental illness including a form of dissociative identity disorder, in which each of his alternate personas controls one of his many superpowers. The television series Legion premiered on FX network in 2017. When Mystique tracked down David years later to get revenge for \\"his\\" murder of Destiny, he awakened with his fractured mind healed. David had a new goal, to help his father realize his dream of human-mutant coexistence by killing Magneto, Xavier's greatest opponent, before he had a chance to amass power. He traveled twenty years into the past, when Xavier and Magneto were orderlies at the mental hospital. In the process, he loses his memory. Magneto then accidentally triggers his memory, causing David to go on a rampage, attacking Magneto and revealing the existence of mutants to the public decades too early. Several X-Men who were pulled back in time with him were unable to prevent him from attacking Magneto. Xavier, however, leaped into the path of the psi-knife (the focused totality of Legion's psionic powers) and was killed in Magneto's place, causing the formation of the Age of Apocalypse timeline.  Due to being trapped in the past by David's actions, Bishop enlisted the aid of the new reality's X-Men to travel back in time to confront Legion again. Bishop seized Legion's psi-blade and drove it into his own chest, allowing Legion to see the future that he caused. In his last moments, David apologized for what he did.

How to get rid of skin moles  Determine the type of mole in order to assess your treatment options.  While you may use natural methods to remove moles for cosmetic reasons, you will need to see a doctor for cancerous moles. If you have several moles and one looks different from the others, you should get it evaluated by a doctor.","output":"The most logical next event after determining the type of mole and assessing your treatment options is to decide on the best approach to remove the mole. This process should consider the type of mole, its location on the skin, and your personal preferences. Remember that it's crucial to see a physician if there's any concern about the mole being cancerous or showing signs of dysplasia. Here are several methods for mole removal, both natural and medical: 1. Natural Home Remedies Before attempting natural remedies, consult your healthcare provider as they may not be suitable for all skin types or all mole conditions. - Apple Cider Vinegar: Apply apple cider vinegar directly to the mole using a cotton ball, and cover it with a bandage. Leave it on for a few hours and repeat the process daily until the mole scabs and falls off. - Garlic: Garlic is believed to have enzymes that break down the cell clusters of moles. Apply crushed garlic directly to the mole, cover it with a bandage, and leave it on overnight. Repeat the process daily for improved results. - Tea Tree Oil: Apply a drop of tea tree oil directly to the mole, and cover it with a bandage. Repeat the process twice daily for several weeks for the mole to disappear. Remember that results may vary with home remedies, and they might not be effective for everyone. Patience and consistency are key when using natural treatments. 2. Over-the-counter Treatments These treatments contain acids that can help remove moles, but consult your healthcare provider before starting any over-the-counter treatment. - Mole Removal Creams: Follow the instructions on the packaging, as each product varies in its application. - Salicylic Acid: Apply salicylic acid solutions or pads to the affected area daily. The acid helps to peel off layers of the mole gradually. 3. Medical Procedures - Surgical Excision: A physician will numb the area and surgically remove the mole with a scalpel. They may also remove some healthy tissue surrounding the mole to ensure complete removal of potentially cancerous cells. - Laser Removal: Laser mole removal is an effective method for flat and small moles. The process involves using laser light to break down melanin pigment, which forms the mole. Multiple sessions can be required. - Cryotherapy: A physician will use liquid nitrogen to freeze the mole, which will cause the mole to form a scab and eventually fall off. The process might need to be repeated for a complete removal. - Electrocautery: This treatment involves using an electrical current to cut, remove or burn the mole tissue without bleeding. This method can have minimal scarring. Your course of action will depend on the type of mole, its potential risks, and your personal preferences. Medical professionals can help you choose the most appropriate method, based on factors such as scarring, mole depth, and location. Always consult your healthcare provider before taking any measures to remove skin moles."},{"instruction":"Definition: In this task, you are given a text from a social media post.

The piece of paper raises an ages-old question about Jesus, whose life and teachings form the heart of Christianity. Could Jesus have been married? Harvard Divinity School Professor Karen King recently explained the Coptic wording on the papyrus. She says the words mean that Jesus called Mary Magdalene, an early Christian, \\"my wife.\\" She says he did this while speaking to his disciples, or followers. \\"I don't think that this text is that significant. There are so many barriers for it to get over. You've got to show that it's reliable, and there are real questions about whether that text is reliable.\\" Professor Bock expresses other concerns about the papyrus. For example, he says, there is not enough writing on it to establish the real meaning of the words. He says the word \\"wife\\" may not mean \\"wife\\" in the traditional way. And, he says the papyrus is just one text showing that Jesus might have been married. \\"And then you've got the fact that this is one text out of many, many, many texts that don't indicate that Jesus was married.

He works at his family's auto shop, which has been struggling financially for years. Despite its financial troubles, Zach's family finds solace in the fact that they have each other. Step 2: Introduce Frankie and their connection to Zach Frankie is Zach's eccentric childhood friend, who moved away years ago and found success in the criminal underworld. Known for their cunning and charm, Frankie is a notorious gang leader, and their criminal empire spans across several cities. Step 3: Show the inciting incident Zach's family's financial situation worsens when his father falls ill and the medical bills begin piling up. Desperate, Zach secretly indulges in shady side jobs to make ends meet. During one of these jobs, he unexpectedly crosses paths with Frankie. Surprised by their reunion, they catch up, and Zach opens up to Frankie about his family's financial burdens. Step 4: The offer and Zach's decline Sensing Zach's desperation, Frankie offers him a way out of his troubles: join Frankie's gang, leave the town, and start a new, exciting life in the criminal underworld. Although momentarily tempted by the prospect of escaping his humdrum existence, Zach refuses Frankie's offer. He is determined to protect his family and find an honest way to overcome their challenges. Step 5: Show the impact of Zach's decision Zach's decision to stay and fight for his family's welfare begins to pay off. His efforts to rejuvenate the family's auto shop lead to a rise in business. As he navigates life's difficulties, he realizes that he made the right choice in turning down Frankie's offer. However, he begins to worry about possible repercussions from the criminal organization. Step 6: Build tension and the climax Frankie, who respects Zach's decision despite feeling betrayed, still keeps an eye on him from afar. Tensions rise when members of Frankie's gang learn about Zach's refusal and decide to teach him a lesson. Receiving word of this, Frankie rushes back to the town to protect their old friend. In the climactic scene, Frankie arrives exactly in time to save Zach from a dangerous confrontation with the gang members. This sacrifice leads Frankie to reassess their own life choices, and they ultimately decide to leave the criminal underworld for good. Step 7: The resolution Inspired by each other's conviction, Zach and Frankie join forces and use their combined skills to turn the auto shop into a prosperous business. Zach's family recovers financially, and their strong bond remains unbroken. Frankie, on the other hand, finds redemption in embracing a new, crime-free life and leading by example."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant. User will you give you a task. Your goal is to complete the task as faithfully as you can. While performing the task think step-by-step and justify your steps. Summarize the following: In order to attract talent scouts and to get recruited onto a team, you’ll need an act to attract the right person. Whether you’re practicing with your brother in the backyard or with your coach at a first-class gym, keep practicing. It should be something you can practically do in your sleep, where you know you won’t hurt yourself and mistakes aren’t common. You want it perfect so when you're called up, you can audition or be a substitute on a second's notice. When you get the circus they may change it as they see fit, but it has to get you there in the first place. To apply for worldwide gigs (like Cirque du Soleil), you’ll probably need to make an audition tape, showing your skills. Bigger companies often have online submission forms that you can submit during certain times of year. Showcase the best of your act, follow the appropriate guidelines, and make sure your tape is as professional-looking as possible. Many circus acts have agents and work through recruiters, too. The more time you spend in the field, the more networked you'll be, making it easier to make and find connections. Though they don’t get a lot of press, there are legitimate, credible circus schools out there that are looking for students to teach with skills they can help hone. If there’s one in your area (or even if there’s not), look into it – it’s a great way to meet people that are already established in the field. There’s a great job outlook, too. Most schools tout one of their biggest selling points as placing 100% (or nearly 100%) of their graduates in jobs. Most people don’t start out playing with the big boys – they do small gigs and then get noticed, breaking in through making a name for themselves. To do this, take whatever opportunities you can. Your high school talent show, your dad’s business luncheon, or the halftime show at a local football game. if you build up your resume, more people will look at your act and take it seriously. Tell your friends and family members to talk to their friends and family members about your act. You may get booked into private parties and local events just by word of mouth. This is one of the most reliable ways to market yourself and it can spread like wildfire. In addition to small, one-off gigs like private parties, think of less traditional semi-related gigs like on cruise ships. You work in a show put together by the cruise line for 6-9 months and then that’s that. This is a great stepping stone to getting to one of the bigger, official circuses around. Consider websites like Workaway, too, where you can sign up for a period of time and be part of the circus in exchange for room and board. It’s not glamorous, but it’s a step in the right direction! Yep, those are a thing. The American Youth Circus Organization holds the Youth Circus Festival every year in August, just as one example. Some people are asked to perform and others get lucky enough to nab a slot – but either way, you’ll be able to showcase your stuff and get seen. Apply as early as you can, talk to your coach, agent, or recruiter, and get your name in the ring. It may, at least initially, cost you money for travel and what not, but it's a small sacrifice to make to be showcased. Now that you’ve built up your resume and have an act you can rely on, go for the big leagues. Apply to the next variation of Cirque du Soleil or Barnum & Bailey’s and get ready for the life of a circus performer. Can you believe you made it happen? Sometimes you'll apply and won't hear for months. If you don't hear back automatically, don't give up hope, but keep applying elsewhere. Don't shy away from international gigs, too. The one brutal fact that most circus hopefuls don't really think about is the fact that they'll be away from home, constantly living out of a suitcase. Life onstage will be glamorous, but life offstage means hotels, vending machines, and sleeping in cars. Some people find this life rewarding, but others find it very challenging. To make it, you've gotta be the kind that thrives in this setting. It can be very lonely, too. You'll develop a circus family definitely, but your real family may even be thousands of miles away. This, of course, depends on your contract. Only sign up for a period of time you know you can handle.","output":"To attract talent scouts and get recruited, you need a well-practiced act.

On the contrary, the visible unity of the catholic or universal church was seen by the Protestant reformers as an important and essential doctrine of the Reformation.

Disillusioned by his parents and a dull job as a post room boy in an advertising firm, Jimmy finds an outlet for his teenage angst by taking amphetamines, partying, riding scooters and brawling with Rockers, accompanied by his Mod friends Dave (Mark Wingett), Chalky (Philip Davis) and Spider (Gary Shail). One of the Mods' rivals, the Rockers, is in fact Jimmy's childhood friend, Kevin (Ray Winstone). An attack by hostile Rockers on Spider leads to a retaliation attack on Kevin. Jimmy participates in the beating, but when he realises the victim is Kevin, he doesn't help him, instead riding away on his scooter. A bank holiday weekend provides the excuse for the rivalry between Mods and Rockers to come to a head, as they both descend upon the seaside town of Brighton. A series of running battles ensues. As the police close in on the rioters, Jimmy escapes down an alleyway with Steph (Leslie Ash)Â â a girl on whom he has a crushÂ â and they have sex. When the pair emerge, they find themselves in the middle of the melee just as police are detaining rioters. Jimmy is arrested, detained with a volatile, popular Mod he calls 'Ace Face' (Sting), and later fined the then-large sum of Â£50. When fined Â£75, Ace Face mocks the magistrate by offering to pay on the spot with a cheque, to the amusement of the fellow Mods. Back in London, Jimmy becomes severely depressed. He is thrown out of his house by his mother, who finds his stash of amphetamine pills. He then quits his job, spends his severance package on more pills, and finds out that Steph has become the girlfriend of his friend Dave. After a brief fight with Dave, the following morning his rejection is confirmed by Steph and with his beloved Lambretta scooter accidentally destroyed in a crash, Jimmy takes a train back to Brighton.

The event was marked by the presentation of Gil Vicente's Visitation Play or the Monologue of the Cowherd  in the queen's chamber. The young prince was sworn heir to the throne in 1503, the year his youngest sister, Isabella of Portugal, Empress Consort of the Holy Roman Empire between 1527 and 1538, was born. John was educated by notable scholars of the time, including the astrologer Tomás de Torres, Diogo de Ortiz, Bishop of Viseu, and Luís Teixeira Lobo, one of the first Portuguese Renaissance humanists, rector of the University of Siena  and Professor of Law at Ferrara . John's chronicler António de Castilho said that, \\"Dom João III faced problems easily, complementing his lack of culture with a practice formation that he always showed during his reign\\" . In 1514, he was given his own house, and a few years later began to help his father in administrative duties. At the age of sixteen, John was chosen to marry his first cousin, the 20-year-old Eleanor of Austria, eldest daughter of Philip the Handsome of Austria-Burgundy and Queen Joanna of Castile, but instead she married his widowed father Manuel. John took deep offence at this: his chroniclers say he became melancholic and was never quite the same.

(CNN) -- A Christian evangelical group said Thursday that a Bible school -- backed by American evangelist Franklin Graham -- was destroyed in the latest bombing raid to hit South Kordofan, an oil-rich Sudanese province that borders the newly created independent country of South Sudan. At least eight bombs were dropped in the area Wednesday during the school's first day of classes, according to a statement by Samaritan's Purse, Graham's Christian humanitarian group, which supports the school. Two bombs landed inside the compound -- located in the region's Nuba Mountains -- destroying two Heiban Bible College buildings and igniting grass fires across the area, the group said in a statement No injuries were reported. \\"It was a miracle that no one was injured,\\" the statement added. Graham, who has called on the international community to take out Sudan's air assets and establish a no-fly zone in the region, said in a statement Thursday that he blamed Sudan's air force for the strike. At least four churches have been destroyed since August, the group said. \\"We are deeply concerned for the welfare and lives of the people of South Kordofan and we condemn the bombing of churches and Christian facilities,\\" added Graham, son of the famed Rev.

Premise: Two children holding balloons and a woman are on a sidewalk with a car off to the side. Hypothesis: A mother and her two kids with balloons have just come from the circus. .Can we conclude that the hypothesis is true if the premise is true?","output":"Based on the given premise, we cannot definitively conclude that the hypothesis is true even if the premise is true. While the presence of the two children holding balloons and a woman on the sidewalk may suggest a connection to the circus, we do not have enough information to confidently state and prove that the woman is their mother or if they have truly just come from the circus. There could be several alternative explanations for the scene, such as the woman being their babysitter, a relative, or another family friend who accompanied the children to a different event, like a fair or a birthday party. The balloons could also have been purchased at a store or received as a gift, rather than being acquired at a circus.  In summary, while the hypothesis may seem plausible given the premise, we do not have enough evidence to conclusively confirm its truth. To validate the hypothesis, we would need additional information or evidence about the relationship between the woman and children and about their specific whereabouts before the scene took place. Additionally, discerning the context of the premise would help with understanding if there were any other events or scenarios that could have led to this particular scene, finding alternative explanations, and ultimately verifying or disputing the hypothesis."},{"instruction":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

The answer to this question is:","output":"tectonic plates. The ground shakes as a result of the movement of tectonic plates. These plates are large pieces of the Earth's lithosphere that fit together like a puzzle, comprising both the crust and a part of the upper mantle. The Earth's surface is divided into seven major and several minor tectonic plates, which rest on the semi-fluid asthenosphere. The movement of these plates is primarily caused by the forces generated from the release of energy within the Earth's mantle, which results in the process of plate tectonics. The forces driving the movement of these plates are known as mantle convection currents. The upper mantle becomes heated due to the radioactive decay of isotopes, leading to a decrease in density and ultimately causing it to rise, while cooler, denser material sinks. Three main types of plate boundaries exist: convergent, divergent, and transform. As the plates move, they interact with each other at these boundaries, leading to various geological events such as earthquakes, volcanic eruptions, and the formation of mountains. Convergent plate boundaries occur when two plates come together or \\"collide.\\" In this scenario, the denser plate (typically an oceanic plate) subducts beneath the lighter plate (continental plate), leading to the formation of trenches, mountain ranges, and volcanic activity. Examples of these boundaries include the collision of the Indian plate with the Eurasian plate (which formed the Himalayan Mountain Range) and the Pacific plate subducting beneath the South American plate (forming the Andes and the Pacific \\"Ring of Fire\\"). Divergent plate boundaries are formed when two plates move away from each other, which is frequently seen at the mid-ocean ridges where new crust material rises from the mantle to form new oceanic crust. This separation generates rift valleys and, if significant enough, can lead to the development of new ocean basins. An example of a divergent boundary is the Mid-Atlantic Ridge, where the North American and Eurasian plates are drifting apart. Finally, transform plate boundaries occur when two plates slide horizontally past each other, which can result in earthquakes. The most famous example of a transform plate boundary is the San Andreas Fault, where the Pacific plate and the North American plate are sliding past each other in opposite directions. In conclusion, the ground shakes as a result of the movement of tectonic plates due to the release of energy within the Earth's mantle and the forces generated by mantle convection currents. These movements result in various geological events, including earthquakes, volcanic activity, and the formation of mountain ranges."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

He played college football at the University of Pittsburgh. Hypothesis: Stanley Anthony Woods won many awards","output":"Based on the context provided, we cannot definitively draw the hypothesis that Stanley Anthony Woods won many awards because the information given does not explicitly state any awards or accolades received by Woods during his football career. It is important to note that an individual's success in their career cannot always be measured by the number of awards they receive. However, to investigate further into Woods' achievements, let's consider his contributions and background in more detail. Stanley Anthony Woods' football journey starts with his college career at the University of Pittsburgh. While the context does not provide specifics about his performance or accomplishments at the university, it is safe to assume that Woods played at a high enough level to be drafted into the NFL, which is a significant achievement in its own right. Being able to attend and play for a known university like the University of Pittsburgh, already indicates his talent in football. Woods' professional career saw him play in the National Football League (NFL) as a linebacker and defensive end. He played for three prestigious teams: the Seattle Seahawks (from 1987 to 1992), the Los Angeles Rams, and the Washington Redskins. It is worth mentioning that playing for these high-profile teams and having a career that spans multiple years suggests that Woods was a valued player in the NFL. The context does not provide any specific records or statistics that would otherwise direct us to draw a hypothesis about his awards. As a result, further investigation would be necessary to confirm whether Stanley Anthony Woods did, in fact, win numerous awards during his football career. This may include looking into his college and professional football records, finding biographical data to obtain more context about his career, or analyzing the statistical data to gauge his impact and performance on the teams he represented. In conclusion, based on the information provided, we cannot definitively hypothesize that Stanley Anthony Woods won many awards. However, his football journey – from the University of Pittsburgh to playing for various prestigious NFL teams – does highlight the talent and dedication he demonstrated in his career. Further research would reveal if Woods' talent and dedication were recognized in the form of multiple awards and accolades."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant. User will you give you a task.

London (CNN) -- Argentinian President Cristina Fernandez de Kirchner is once again calling on the UK to hand back the Falkland Islands -- known in Argentina as Las Malvinas -- accusing Britain of blatant colonialism. In an open letter to British Prime Minister David Cameron, which was published in the British press, she says that Britain stripped the islands away from Argentina 180 years ago on Thursday's date: January 3. Read more: Falkland Islands will vote on political status The two countries went to war over the territory in 1982, when the then-Argentinian military government landed troops on the islands. The British government swiftly rejected the idea of negotiations, saying the","output":"matter was non-negotiable and that the residents of the Falkland Islands had a clear desire to remain British. The dispute has remained a point of contention between the two nations ever since the end of the conflict when the UK retained control over the islands. In her letter, President Kirchner emphasizes Argentina's historical claim to the Falklands and argues that it is time for the UK to participate in peaceful negotiations in accordance with several United Nations resolutions. She points out that the present British control over the islands is a remnant of old colonialist policies and that it goes against the principle of territorial integrity. The Prime Minister's office, however, reiterates that the central issue is not historical events or colonialism, but rather the rights of the Falkland Islanders themselves. They argue that the inhabitants have a fundamental right to self-determination, as enshrined in the UN Charter. In response to the ongoing disagreement, a referendum was held in March 2013, in which the residents of the Falkland Islands voted overwhelmingly to remain a British Overseas Territory. 99.8% of the voters chose to maintain their current political status, with only three people voting against. The turnout for the referendum was an impressive 92%. With these results, it's clear that the majority of people living in the Falkland Islands wish to remain under British sovereignty. Consequently, the British government asserts that the referendum results should be respected and that the will of the Falkland Islanders must be the determining factor in any discussions regarding the islands' sovereignty. Argentina, on the other hand, has dismissed the referendum as a publicity stunt that lacks any legal standing. Prime Minister David Cameron has maintained a firm stance on the issue, stating that there will be no negotiations on the sovereignty of the Falkland Islands without the consent of the people who live there. Tensions between both countries have periodically flared up over the years, with economic sanctions and military posturing complicating matters. In conclusion, the debate over the Falkland Islands has persisted for decades, often driven by nationalistic rhetoric and historical grievances. While attempts have been made to diplomatically resolve the conflict, the UK and Argentina remain at odds, with the UK vehemently defending the right of the Falkland Islanders to determine their own future. Despite President Cristina Fernandez de Kirchner's plea for diplomatic negotiations, it seems unlikely that there will be any change in the islands' status unless the Falkland Islanders themselves decide otherwise. As long as the islanders remain adamant in their desire to maintain British ties, negotiations between the UK and Argentina will likely remain at an impasse. Although the international community is aware of the longstanding dispute, it has largely refrained from intervening, recognizing the sensitivity of the situation. Ultimately, the key to resolving the Falkland Islands issue will necessitate a mutual understanding and respect for the wishes of the local population by both the UK and Argentina - until then, the ongoing dispute stands as a testament to the complexities of post-colonial relations and national identity."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Choices:  - pain - carpal tunnel syndrome - letter - thirst - printed word  The rationale to choose \\"pain\\" as the answer is that: A:","output":"Typing for a prolonged period can lead to various health issues, and one of the most prominent indicators that you need to take a break is \\"pain.\\" Among the choices provided, pain stands out as the most accurate answer due to several reasons, which are discussed below: 1. Direct indication of physical discomfort: Pain is a direct manifestation of physical distress in your body, indicating that something is not right. Continuous typing without taking a break puts strain on your hands, wrists, fingers, and even your neck and back. If you experience pain in any of these areas, it's a clear sign that you should stop and take a break to rest and rejuvenate before continuing. 2. Prevents exacerbation of injury: Ignoring the pain and continuing to type without taking breaks may lead to more severe and chronic injuries like carpal tunnel syndrome, tendonitis, or repetitive strain injury. By acknowledging and acting on this sign, you can prevent the progression of these conditions. 3. Enhances posture and ergonomics: Experiencing pain while typing could also be a sign of poor posture or inadequate ergonomic setup. Taking a break allows you to assess and adjust your workstation for better posture and improved ergonomics, resulting in reduced pain and a more comfortable typing experience for the long term. 4. Improves mental well-being: Pain isn't restricted to physical discomfort. It could also be a warning of mental fatigue, strain, or stress that arises from long hours of typing. Recognizing this signal and taking a break can help relieve stress, refresh your mental focus, and enhance productivity. 5. Can be an early sign of health issues: In some cases, pain related to typing could serve as an early warning sign of a more serious condition, like arthritis, nerve disorders, or even heart issues (for example, hand or arm pain can sometimes be associated with heart problems). Taking note of and addressing this concern might facilitate early detection and management of such health issues. While the other choices might be indirectly relevant to typing-related issues—such as carpal tunnel syndrome as an outcome of ignoring pain, thirst as a reminder to stay hydrated while working, or printed words as a means to switch tasks—it is the manifestation of pain that most clearly signifies the need to take a break while typing for a long time."},{"instruction":"What is the answer for the question: What are the names of the two people who collaborated with a number of musicians, including drummer Josh Freese, while recording Smitten? from the following article ?  After the breakup of the Pixies, Santiago went into a depression for the first couple of years but remained on good terms with bandmate Black Francis (who soon adopted the name Frank Black). Black, who was recording his 1993 debut album, Frank Black, contacted Santiago to ask whether he would contribute lead guitar. Santiago agreed, and he and Mallari drove from their home in Florida to Los Angeles. The couple ended up moving into Black's old apartment in L.A. on a whim. Santiago played lead guitar on a number of Frank Black's solo albums, including Teenager of the Year (1994), and contributed lead guitar to Steve Westfield's 1994 album Mangled. He also formed The Martinis a year later with Mallari. Their recorded output by the end of the 1990s comprised a single song, the self-recorded \\"Free\\" (1995), which appeared on the film soundtrack of Empire Records. The band played live only occasionally until 2001.In the mid-1990s, Santiago began to explore audio editing software. After composing for several independent films, including Crime and Punishment in Suburbia in 2000 (where he collaborated again with Black), Santiago co-scored the Fox Network TV series Undeclared with Michael Andrews. He continued to contribute lead guitar to albums, collaborating with Charles Douglas on his 2004 album Statecraft.

Translate to English English:","output":"Numerous Turkish NGOs in Kosovo gathered last month in Vushtrri to evaluate the plan prepared by UN Special Envoy Martti Ahtisaari, which aimed to determine the province's status. A large number of Turkish non-governmental organizations (NGOs) operating in Kosovo held a meeting in the town of Vushtrri last month. The main focus of the gathering was to discuss and evaluate the plan put forward by the United Nations (UN) Special Envoy, Martti Ahtisaari. Ahtisaari, a former President of Finland, prepared this comprehensive plan with the objective of establishing the definitive status of the Kosovo province. Kosovo has been the subject of political controversies and territorial disputes, particularly between the governments of Kosovo and Serbia. The province declared its independence from Serbia in 2008, which led to several complications regarding its recognition as an independent country by the international community. Although over 100 countries, including the United States, Germany, and France, have recognized Kosovo as an independent state, some nations, such as Russia and China, have not extended such recognition. Martti Ahtisaari's plan, known as the Ahtisaari Plan, was created to serve as a roadmap that would outline provisions, guidelines, and recommendations for resolving the issues surrounding Kosovo's status. The plan includes proposals on various aspects, including territorial adjustments, minority representation, and decentralization. As a neutral facilitator, Ahtisaari aimed to bring a fair and lasting solution to the region by mediating between the conflicting parties and striving for consensus on critical issues. The meeting of the Turkish NGOs in Vushtrri highlights the active and robust involvement of Turkish civil society organizations in the pursuit of stability and sustainable development in Kosovo. These NGOs aim to support Kosovo's political, social, and economic integration into the international community while respecting its unique cultural identity. It is also a testament to the long-standing bilateral ties between the Republic of Turkey and the Republic of Kosovo, whether through the exchange of diplomatic recognition, trade, investments, or the provision of humanitarian aid. In conclusion, the gathering of so many Turkish NGOs in Vushtrri to discuss the Ahtisaari Plan indicates their commitment to promoting peace and resolution in the region. Through this collective effort, these organizations hope to contribute to the strengthening of Kosovo's statehood and foster positive diplomatic relations between the disputing parties involved."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant. You will be given a task. You must generate a detailed and long answer. Q: what is the shape of each face of a tetrahedron? A:","output":"A: The shape of each face of a tetrahedron is an equilateral triangle.  A tetrahedron is a polyhedron with four faces, and it is the simplest of all the Platonic solids. In a regular tetrahedron, all the faces are congruent triangles – that is, all the sides and angles within the triangles are equal. Specifically, each face is an equilateral triangle, which has three equal sides and three equal angles, with each angle measuring 60 degrees. To further explain, imagine taking four equilateral triangles and connecting their edges to form a three-dimensional figure. When you join these triangles together, meeting at a common point called the vertex, you will create a regular tetrahedron. Each of the four vertices connects three triangles, and each edge of the tetrahedron is shared by two triangles.  In addition to its equilateral triangular faces, other qualities of a regular tetrahedron include: 1. All edges have the same length: Since each face is an equilateral triangle, all the edges of the tetrahedron are the same length. 2. It has six equal edges: There are a total of six edges in a tetrahedron, with each face contributing three of its sides. 3. It has four vertices: A tetrahedron consists of four vertices, where each vertex joins three different faces. 4. Angle between faces: The angle between any two faces of a regular tetrahedron is called the dihedral angle, and in the case of a regular tetrahedron, the dihedral angle is approximately 70.53 degrees. 5. Symmetry: A regular tetrahedron has tetrahedral symmetry, meaning that it remains unchanged under certain rotations and reflections. In conclusion, the shape of each face of a tetrahedron is an equilateral triangle, with equal sides and equal angles of 60 degrees. The tetrahedron is composed of four such triangular faces, six equal edges, and four vertices."},{"instruction":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

Yet after we leave school most of us never pick up a pencil again--willingly. If asked to draw something, most adults and many older children will shake their heads and say, \\" Not me! I can't draw. I'm hopeless at it.\\"    When you think about it, this is very strange. Drawing involves coordinating  the hand and the eye with the pencil.

About 14% use a similar external fertilization but produce yolk-rich eggs, which reduce the time the larva needs to spend among the plankton, or eggs from which miniature adults emerge rather than larvae. The rest care for the fertilized eggs until they hatch – some by producing jelly-covered masses of eggs which they tend, some by attaching the eggs to their bodies and a few species by keeping the eggs within their bodies until they hatch.

However, the script's rampant clichés, inadequately fleshed-out characters, and complete lack of originality stifle that potential and reduce the film to nothing more than a tedious, predictable slog. As the strained friendship between the two leading characters deteriorates, they descend into a pattern of juvenile behavior that is not only cringe-worthy but also further alienates the audience. The director's inability to coax engaging or nuanced performances, even from a cast with proven talent, is truly an appalling disappointment. The visual aesthetics and pacing of Disappointing Duo are equally disheartening. The film suffers from an overuse of generic establishing shots, washed-out colors, and banal cinematography that do nothing to provide even a semblance of visual flair. The editing is jarring, with abrupt transitions that often leave the viewer puzzled and frequently disrupt the flow of the storytelling. Perhaps the most distressing aspect of this film, however, is its blatant ignorance of any potential negative consequences to the characters' impulsive and reckless actions. The plot rapidly escalates to become a complete farce that undermines the seriousness of the initial conflict and ultimately trivializes the essential themes intended for exploration. All in all, Disappointing Duo was a bitter letdown. Bereft of any meaningful character development, lacking a compelling narrative core, and marred by an unappealing visual style, it squanders any potential it had. As the credits roll, it is difficult to remember a single redeeming quality from this misfire of a film. I cannot, in good conscience, recommend this movie to anyone looking for a satisfying experience. Disappointing Duo is, regrettably, an entirely apt title for this fiasco."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant. You should describe the task and explain your answer.

We do not know exactly how the hijackers gained access to the cockpit; FAA rules required that the doors remain closed and locked during flight. Ong speculated that they had \\"jammed their way\\" in. Perhaps the terrorists stabbed the flight attendants to get a cockpit key, to force one of them to open the cockpit door, or to lure the captain or first officer out of the cockpit. Or the flight attendants may just have been in their way. At the same time or shortly thereafter, Atta-the only terrorist on board trained to fly a jet-would have moved to the cockpit from his business-class seat, possibly accompanied by Omari. As this was happening, passenger Daniel Lewin, who was seated in the row just behind Atta and Omari, was stabbed by one of the hijackers-probably Satam al Suqami, who was seated directly behind Lewin. Lewin had served four years as an officer in the Israeli military. He may have made an attempt to stop the hijackers in front of him, not realizing that another was sitting behind him. The hijackers quickly gained control and sprayed Mace, pepper spray, or some other irritant in the first-class cabin, in order to force the passengers and flight attendants toward the rear of the plane. They claimed they had a bomb. About five minutes after the hijacking began, Betty Ong contacted the American Airlines Southeastern Reservations Office in Cary, North Carolina, via an AT&T airphone to report an emergency aboard the flight. This was the first of several occasions on 9/11 when flight attendants took action outside the scope of their training, which emphasized that in a hijacking, they were to communicate with the cockpit crew. The emergency call lasted approximately 25 minutes, as Ong calmly and professionally relayed information about events taking place aboard the airplane to authorities on the ground. At 8:19, Ong reported:\\"The cockpit is not answering, somebody's stabbed in business class-and I think there's Mace-that we can't breathe-I don't know, I think we're getting hijacked.\\" She then told of the stabbings of the two flight attendants. At 8:21, one of the American employees receiving Ong's call in North Carolina, Nydia Gonzalez, alerted the American Airlines operations center in Fort Worth, Texas, reaching Craig Marquis, the manager on duty. Marquis soon realized this was an emergency and instructed the airline's dispatcher responsible for the flight to contact the cockpit. At 8:23, the dispatcher tried unsuccessfully to contact the aircraft.  Question: \\"Which passenger made an attempt to stop the hijackers?\\" Answer: \\"Atta\\" Is this answer correct? Available choices: (a). no; (b). yes;...I think the answer is","output":"(a). no Atta is not the correct answer. The passage states that passenger Daniel Lewin, seated just behind Atta and Omari, was stabbed by one of the hijackers and may have made an attempt to stop the hijackers in front of him. Atta was one of the hijackers and not the passenger who tried to stop them."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant. User will you give you a task.

Please answer the following question: Process:  - The liver removes toxins from the blood - Liver also cleans blood that has just been enriched with vitamins and minerals during digestion - Liver processes the good stuff into forms that the rest of the body can use - Waste or stuff your body doesn't need can be carried by bile back into the intestine or into the kidneys - The liver also produces a digestive juice called bile that helps the body absorb fat into the bloodstream - The liver also stores extra carbohydrates as glycogen for the body to use as fuel when needed.  suppose more alcohol is consumed and turned into waste happens, how will it affect the liver having to work HARDER.  Which of the following is the supposed perturbation?  - directly impacting a step of the process - indirectly impacting a step of the process - not impacting any step of the process A:","output":"When more alcohol is consumed and turned into waste, it will have a direct impact on the liver by making it work harder. This direct impact can lead to perturbation in the liver's functioning, which in turn can affect the overall health of an individual. Alcohol is broken down by the liver into a toxic substance called acetaldehyde, which is then further metabolized into harmless compounds like acetate and carbon dioxide. The liver is responsible for removing these toxins from the blood, along with its other vital functions such as processing nutrients and producing bile. However, the liver can process a limited amount of alcohol at a time. Excessive alcohol consumption can cause a backlog in the processing of alcohol and its toxins, forcing the liver to work harder and impacting the efficiency of its functions. The following are the ways in which alcohol-induced perturbation directly impacts the steps of the liver's detoxification process: 1. Overburdening the liver: The liver is responsible for breaking down alcohol into less harmful substances. Consuming more alcohol than the liver can handle puts excessive strain on the organ, affecting its ability to perform other important tasks such as processing nutrients and producing bile. 2. Impairing nutrient absorption: Excessive alcohol intake can damage the liver cells, which are essential for nutrient absorption. This damage can disrupt the breakdown and absorption of nutrients, directly impacting the liver's ability to process and distribute essential vitamins and minerals to other parts of the body. 3. Disrupting bile production: Alcohol consumption can lead to a decrease in bile production, affecting the liver's ability to break down and absorb fats. This can lead to fat accumulation in the liver, leading to fatty liver disease. Moreover, a deficiency in bile can also hinder the removal of waste products from the body, which can build up and lead to further liver damage. 4. Increased demand for glycogen reserves: As the body tries to process excessive alcohol, it may rely more on its glycogen stores for energy. This can deplete the liver's glycogen reserves, impacting the ability of the liver to manage blood sugar levels effectively. 5. Formation of toxic byproducts: The metabolism of alcohol produces toxic byproducts, such as reactive oxygen species, that can cause oxidative stress and damage the liver cells. This can directly impact the liver's ability to function effectively, further disrupting the various metabolic processes carried out by the liver. In conclusion, excessive alcohol consumption can directly impact multiple steps of the liver detoxification process, making the liver work harder to perform its vital functions. This can lead to liver damage or diseases over time, highlighting the importance of moderate and responsible alcohol consumption."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Q:Given the background: Sometimes muscles and tendons get injured when a person starts doing an activity before they have warmed up properly. A warm up is a slow increase in the intensity of a physical activity that prepares muscles for an activity. Warming up increases the blood flow to the muscles and increases the heart rate. Warmed-up muscles and tendons are less likely to get injured. For example, before running or playing soccer, a person might jog slowly to warm muscles and increase their heart rate. Even elite athletes need to warm up ( Figure below ).  and the situation: There was a soccer match between Red team and Blue team. Blue team got there early, warmed up properly and were ready for the game. Red team arrived late and almost skipped warming up entirely. Costly decision, as it turns out, because they lost.  Answer the following question: Which team had more people with muscle injuries? A:","output":"Based on the given information, it is most likely that the Red team had more people with muscle injuries. The Red team arrived late and almost skipped the warm-up entirely, which did not give their muscles and tendons enough time to increase blood flow and prepare themselves for the exertion of playing soccer. In contrast, the Blue team arrived early, warmed up properly, and were ready for the game, leading to a decreased likelihood of injuries. Warming up before engaging in any physical activity, especially sports like soccer, helps in reducing the risk of muscle pulls, strains, and other injuries. It also enhances performance by increasing the flexibility and coordination of muscles, improving blood circulation, and preparing the cardiovascular system. The fact that the Red team lost the game can also be attributed to their lack of proper warm-up. When the body is not adequately prepared for physical activity, it can lead to reduced performance, slower reaction times, decreased strength, and a higher risk of injuries. It can also affect the overall morale and teamwork of the players. In this specific situation, the Red team's decision not to warm up properly likely cost them not just in terms of increased muscle injuries but also the outcome of the soccer match."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant that follows instruction extremely well.

It is possible that the man is observing the surrounding environment, a distant event, an object, or even a person such as a woman. However, without further context, we cannot assert anything beyond the simple fact that he is using binoculars to look at something or someone. Given the information available, our conclusion \\"A man watching a woman with binoculars\\" is speculative and not directly supported by the original statement. We can only confirm the man's use of binoculars and not the specific object or person he is observing. The statement requires additional clarification and context to support or refute the suggestion that he is watching a woman. Moreover, it is essential to understand that interpretations and conclusions may vary depending on the observer's perspective, the surrounding context, and any implicit or explicit assumptions made by an individual. For a more accurate understanding, it is crucial to gather more information about the situation or context in which the man uses the green binoculars. For example, additional context could provide information about the man's location, purpose, or focus. Perhaps he is using binoculars for birdwatching in a natural setting or spectating at a sports event, in which case the proposed conclusion would be unlikely. Alternatively, the statement could be a snippet from a story in which the man's actions are tied to a particular narrative, and his objective would be better understood within that storyline. It is important not to jump to conclusions or make assumptions without sufficient evidence to support them, as doing so can lead to misunderstandings and inaccurate judgements. In this specific case, we cannot conclude with certainty that \\"A man watches a woman with binoculars\\" simply based on the information contained in the initial statement.

Galileo Galilei was brought before the Inquisition for heresy, but abjured his views and was sentenced to house arrest, under which he spent the rest of his life. Galileo was found \\"vehemently suspect of heresy\\", namely of having held the opinions that the Sun lies motionless at the centre of the universe, that the Earth is not at its centre and moves, and that one may hold and defend an opinion as probable after it has been declared contrary to Holy Scripture.

Mike needs to find the differences between the patients to come up with recommendations for them.  Given the paragraph above, please answer correctly the following question:   Which patient would see their stamina diminishing, patient A or patient B?  Hint: During late adulthood, the risk of developing diseases such as cardiovascular diseases and cancer continues to rise. Most people also have a decline in strength and stamina. Their senses may start failing, and their reflex time typically increases. Their immune system also doesn’t work as well as it used to. As a result, common diseases like the flu may become more serious and even lead to death. The majority of late adults develop arthritis, and as many as one in four develop Alzheimer’s disease.

Answer the above question based on the context below:  The film opens in the year 1958, where steel heiress Edna Buxton enters a talent contest. Her overbearing mother is at odds with her, arguing that Edna should choose a specific song and wardrobe for the contest. At the contest, Edna swaps dresses with a blue singer named Doris, and even changes her song at the last minute, infuriating her mother, who leaves before seeing Edna win the competition. An excited Edna decides to use her grand prize winnings to record a demo. The studio producer tactfully delivers the painful truth to Edna that not only are girl singers not getting signed, the record companies are trying to get rid of the ones currently on their rosters. However, when Edna tells him that she wrote the song, he is impressed enough to direct her to Joel Milner who takes her under his wing, renames her \\"Denise Waverly\\" and invents a blue-collar persona for her. Milner reworks her song for a male doo-wop group, the Stylettes, as male solo artists are groups are far more marketable. The song becomes a hit. Denise (formerly Edna) moves to New York City and becomes a songwriter in the Brill Building. At a party, she meets the arrogant songwriter Howard Caszatt, and despite an awkward initial meeting they become romantically involved. She also reunites with Doris. Denise offers to and writes a song specifically for Doris and her two girlfriends, persuading Milner to audition and hire the group.  In 1965, Howard and Denise begin writing together; they pen a song called \\"Unwanted Number,\\" based on a young girl's unwanted pregnancy.  Although it is banned, it attracts the attention of prominent and influential disc jockey John Murray who, despite the negative attention of the song, credits Denise with sparking the craze for girl groups.

Q:Found the following article online, use it to answer the question: Who hopes to use their superior intellect to become an inventor?  Set in the Stone Age, Ishbo is the younger son of Mookoo, the leader of a tribe of cavemen. Ishbo is smarter than most of his tribesmen, but awkward and nerdy, living in the shadow of his much more physically impressive brother Thudnik. He hopes to use his superior intellect to become an inventor and raise his tribe above simple sticks and stones, but due to a combination of the flimsy materials available to him and the lack of support from his tribe they always fail. Ishbo also has had a lifelong crush on his childhood friend, Fardart. Much to his dismay, immediately after he finally expresses his love to her she is \\"clubbed\\" by Thudnik (and all that follows in the tradition of caveman stereotypes), and eventually married to him. Ishbo himself has never clubbed a woman, having his heart set on Fardart his whole life. After Fardart is betrothed to Thudnik, Ishbo begins to believe that he will never club a woman. He at first is too attached to her to consider clubbing another woman, and is further discouraged after a particularly ill-fated attempt at clubbing. Ishbo becomes quite depressed, a feeling which is escalated by his failure to prove useful on a mammoth hunt.

Determine the sentiment: First of all let me say the first 20 minutes are great, the monster looks superb and the CGI is reasonably done. It's a shame then that the rest of the movie is such a disappointment,  ******** SPOILERS BELOW ********  From the opening scene we can see this movie is anti-American, normally this sort of stereotyping wouldn't bother me (we Brits get enough from Hollywood) but here it's not subtle about making the Americans brain-dead morons. It goes past the point of realism and your left wondering if a Yank has raped the directors mother. The grieving scene was really poor and the part of the movie where it starts going downhill. Here we are introduced to the Olympic medallist Auntie and drunk Uncle who walk into the memorial and start blaming the father for his daughters death, then hitting him before they all start rolling around on the floor crying. Hardly realistic bonding at a time of crisis! The whole virus sideline is ridiculous. If the Americans know there isn't a virus, why are they wasting time, money and resources investigating? The US government agent orders the brain drilling of an innocent Korean for nothing, making the Americans look evil (or stupid), it wasn't helped by the fact this guy was cross-eyed for comical effect. The movie is about hunting the monster. US and Korean special forces are assigned to finding the creature although through-out the movie they are invisible. The only people hunting the monster, in the whole of Korea, is the main family and some random tramp who appears at the end to save the day! Naturally a few US/Korean agents try to stop them along the way. The sister was only included in the movie so she could make the vital shot at the end. It was clichéd, you knew it was going to happen but to make it worse she does bugger all until that part! and my final annoyance, how the hell did that kid survive at the end? the monster had been swimming with it's head underwater for about 5 minutes! why didn't the monster eat the kids in the first place?","output":"The sentiment of this review can be identified as predominantly negative. The reviewer expresses disappointment with the majority of the movie after praising the initial 20 minutes for its CGI and the appearance of the monster. The following points indicate the negative sentiment: 1. The reviewer calls the movie anti-American and criticizes the unrealistic portrayal of Americans as \\"brain-dead morons.\\" 2. The grieving scene is described as \\"really poor,\\" and the reviewer highlights the unrealistic aspects of the family's interaction during the crisis. 3. The virus subplot is labeled \\"ridiculous,\\" and the reviewer questions its relevance and the portrayal of the US government agent as evil or foolish. 4. The reviewer criticizes the lack of visible involvement of US and Korean special forces in hunting the monster, as well as the introduction of a random character who saves the day. 5. The sister's role in the movie appears to be solely for the purpose of a clichéd ending, and the reviewer dislikes the lack of her involvement throughout the rest of the film. 6. Finally, the reviewer expresses annoyance with the unrealistic survival of the child at the end of the movie and questions the motivation of the monster in not eating the children.

Identify the issue: Think back to the issue that happened in school and clearly define what it was, who was involved, and why it was never resolved before graduation. 2. Gather information: Collect any relevant information or evidence related to the issue. This may include old emails, letters, or witnesses who were present during the event. 3. Reflect on the situation: Take some time to reflect on your feelings and thoughts regarding the issue. This will help you to understand your perspective and how it may have changed over time. 4. Make a plan: Based on your reflections, determine the best course of action to resolve the issue. This might involve reaching out to the other person involved, seeking help from a mediator or counselor, or simply letting it go if you feel it no longer has relevance in your life. 5. Communicate: Open a line of communication with the other person involved, if there is one. Clearly express your feelings, thoughts, and intentions toward resolving the issue.

Now, I will move on to answering the math question. To prove [math]int_0^{2pi} sin(mt)cos(nt) ,dt = 0[/math] for any integer [math]n[/math] and [math]m[/math], we can use the product-to-sum formula: [math]sin(mt) cos(nt) = frac{1}{2}[sin(m+n)t - sin(m-n)t][/math] Now, substituting this formula into the integral: [math]int_0^{2pi} (frac{1}{2}[sin(m+n)t - sin(m-n)t])dt = frac{1}{2}int_0^{2pi}(sin(m+n)t - sin(m-n)t)dt[/math] Now integrate each term separately: [math]frac{1}{2} [int_0^{2pi} sin(m+n)t ,dt - int_0^{2pi} sin(m-n)t,dt][/math] The integral of sine function is: [math]int sin(at), dt = -frac{1}{a} cos(at) + C[/math] Thus.

Summarize: Media playback is not supported on this device Callum Paterson - the subject of interest from Wigan Athletic - nodded the visitors ahead from Sam Nicholson's first-half corner. Thistle levelled after the break when Liam Lindsay's header crossed the line after hitting the bar. But, with time running out, striker Watt lashed a shot into the net from a tight angle. English clubs have already determined that Hearts' right-back Paterson is ready to move south - it is only differing opinions about his value that have prevented a move so far. Wigan may eventually raise their bid from the £700,000 rejected last week, but it is clear why Hearts are looking for more. Physically strong, a powerful runner and commanding in the air, Paterson's goal from Nicholson's corner was an emphatic header. He also plays an important role in Hearts' style. The team's shape is asymmetric, with Arnaud Djoum tucking in from right midfield and Nicholson playing wide on the left, requiring Paterson to provide width on the right flank, which he covers tirelessly. If the Scotland cap leaves this window, Hearts will sorely miss him. There was much to admire about both teams - their organisation, energy and ability to move the ball swiftly in crisp passages of play or directly. The coaching work of Alan Archibald and Robbie Neilson was evident, but personalities still shone through. Watt carries the ball deftly and has vision and clever instincts. Those qualities are all matched in Thistle's Chris Erskine, whose jinking, skilful runs were a feature throughout. He almost made a goal for Ade Azeez in the first half and it was his wing play that led to the corner that delivered Thistle's equaliser. Erskine took the set piece, too, swinging the ball in for Lindsay to score with a header off the underside of the bar. Sometimes managers can just allow individual ability to shine and Hearts were rewarded for leaving Watt on when he struck the winner. Neilson's starting line-up contained eight players who were called up for international duty last week, but it was the talent on their bench that set them apart. The Hearts head coach was able to bring on Bjorn Johnsen and Jamie Walker in the second half and, after Partick Thistle equalised, the visitors stepped up their tempo and pressure. That paid off in the end, but under different circumstances they might have brought on club captain Alim Ozturk, experienced midfielder Prince Buaben, young defender Liam Smith or attacker Robbie Muirhead. What Archibald would have given for those options. Partick Thistle manager Alan Archibald: \\"It was a sore one to take, but I thought we defended well in the second half and limited Hearts' chances. We were very unlucky with the outcome. \\"Our front four all did really well when we got the ball to them. They made things happen. I was going to take Chris [Erskine] off, but I thought he maybe had a goal in him or an assist late on. \\"If the window shuts [without making signings], it's not the end of the world, because there are still good players out there. But I'd like to get at least one in before then.\\" Hearts head coach Robbie Neilson: \\"We brought on [Jamie] Walker and Bjorn [Johnsen] to give us a lift, because we had an idea of the scores from other games. \\"[Strength in depth] is a huge advantage for us. So to have the option of changing it during the match like we did makes a huge difference. \\"You saw the quality of Tony Watt at the end.

The phrase \\"too much Norma Rae\\" likely refers to the 1979 film \\"Norma Rae\\" which focuses on a factory worker who becomes a local activist striving for better conditions. By saying \\"too much,\\" the reviewer is suggesting that the movie in question has overused or rehashed the themes and ideas from \\"Norma Rae,\\" and, as a result, may lack originality and innovation. Although it is not entirely negative, as comparing a film to \\"Norma Rae\\" could suggest that the movie possesses some positive elements, such as dealing with working-class struggles and human resilience, the overall tone of the review implies that the movie might be overly derivative or that it focuses too much on emulating the specific aspects of \\"Norma Rae\\" instead of offering a fresh perspective on these themes. Additionally, when a movie is compared to or criticized for being similar to another well-known film, it can imply that the movie might disappoint the audience who are looking for new stories, different perspectives, and unique approaches to the subject matter. This type of review can also be indirectly criticizing the filmmakers for a lack of creativity, suggesting that the movie doesn't have enough new ideas to stand on its own. While the review sentence does not outright dismiss the movie as terrible or unsatisfactory, it still conveys a somewhat negative sentiment, as the reviewer is expressing their dissatisfaction with the movie's reliance on themes and ideas already explored in \\"Norma Rae.\\" In summary, the movie review sentence leans more negative than positive, primarily due to its critique of the film's originality and overuse of themes from another popular film."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant. Provide a detailed answer so user don’t need to search outside to understand the answer. Information:  - Diatoms are a major group of algae, and are among the most common types of phytoplankton. Diatoms are unicellular, although they can form colonies in the shape of filaments or ribbons (e.g. \\"Fragilaria\\"), fans (e.g. \\"Meridion\\"), zigzags (e.g. \\"Tabellaria\\"), or stars (e.g. \\"Asterionella\\"). The first diatom formally described in scientific literature, the colonial \\"Bacillaria paradoxa\\", was found in 1783 by Danish naturalist Otto Friedrich Müller. Diatoms are producers within the food chain. A unique feature of diatom cells is that they are enclosed within a cell wall made of silica (hydrated silicon dioxide) called a frustule. These frustules show a wide diversity in form, but are usually almost bilaterally symmetrical, hence the group name. The symmetry is not perfect since one of the valves is slightly larger than the other, allowing one valve to fit inside the edge of the other. Fossil evidence suggests that they originated during, or before, the early Jurassic period. Only male gametes of centric diatoms are capable of movement by means of flagella. Diatom communities are a popular tool for monitoring environmental conditions, past and present, and are commonly used in studies of water quality.  - Trigonella is a genus from the family Fabaceae. The best known member is the herb fenugreek.  - Clover or trefoil are common names for plants of the genus Trifolium (Latin, \\"tres\\" \\"three\\" + \\"folium\\" \\"leaf\\"), consisting of about 300 species of plants in the leguminous pea family Fabaceae. The genus has a cosmopolitan distribution; the highest diversity is found in the temperate Northern Hemisphere, but many species also occur in South America and Africa, including at high altitudes on mountains in the tropics. They are small annual, biennial, or short-lived perennial herbaceous plants. Clover can be evergreen. The leaves are trifoliate (rarely quatrefoiled, cinquefoil, or septfoil), with stipules adnate to the leaf-stalk, and heads or dense spikes of small red, purple, white, or yellow flowers; the small, few-seeded pods are enclosed in the calyx. Other closely related genera often called clovers include \\"Melilotus\\" (sweet clover) and \\"Medicago\\" (alfalfa or Calvary clover).  - Alfalfa , Medicago sativa also called lucerne, is a perennial flowering plant in the pea family Fabaceae cultivated as an important forage crop in many countries around the world. It is used for grazing, hay, and silage, as well as a green manure and cover crop. The name alfalfa is used in North America. The name lucerne is the more commonly used name in the United Kingdom, South Africa, Australia, and New Zealand. The plant superficially resembles clover (a cousin in the same family), especially while young, when trifoliate leaves comprising round leaflets predominate. Later in maturity, leaflets are elongated. It has clusters of small purple flowers followed by fruits spiralled in 2 to 3 turns containing 1020 seeds. Alfalfa is native to warmer temperate climates. It has been cultivated as livestock fodder since at least the era of the ancient Greeks and Romans. Alfalfa sprouts are a common ingredient in dishes made in South Indian cuisine.  - Nitrogen fixation is a process by which nitrogen in the Earth's atmosphere is converted into ammonia (NH) or other molecules available to living organisms. Atmospheric nitrogen or molecular dinitrogen (N) is relatively inert: it does not easily react with other chemicals to form new compounds. The fixation process frees nitrogen atoms from their triply bonded diatomic form, NN, to be used in other ways.  - A shrub or bush is a small to medium-sized woody plant. It is distinguished from a tree by its multiple stems and shorter height, usually under 6 m (20 ft) tall. Plants of many species may grow either into shrubs or trees, depending on their growing conditions. Small, low shrubs, generally less than 2 m (6.6 ft) tall, such as lavender, periwinkle and most small garden varieties of roses, are often termed subshrubs.  - Melilotus, known as melilot, sweet clover, and kumoniga (from the Cumans), is a genus in the family Fabaceae (the same family that also includes the \\"Trifolium\\" clovers). Members are known as common grassland plants and as weeds of cultivated ground. Originally from Europe and Asia, it is now found worldwide.  - Medicago is a genus of flowering plants, commonly known as medick or burclover, in the legume family. It contains at least 87 species and is distributed mainly around the Mediterranean basin. The best-known member of the genus is alfalfa (\\"M. sativa\\"), an important forage crop, and the genus name is based on the Latin name for that plant, \\"medica\\", from median (grass). Most members of the genus are low, creeping herbs, resembling clover, but with burs (hence the common name). However, alfalfa grows to a height of 1 meter, and tree medick (\\"M. arborea\\") is a shrub. Members of the genus are known to produce bioactive compounds such as medicarpin (a flavonoid) and medicagenic acid (a triterpenoid saponin). Chromosome numbers in \\"Medicago\\" range from 2\\"n\\" = 14 to 48.  - Rhizobium is a genus of Gram-negative soil bacteria that fix nitrogen. \\"Rhizobium\\" species form an endosymbiotic nitrogen-fixing association with roots of legumes and \\"\\".  - Medicago falcata is a plant species of the genus Medicago . It is native to the Mediterranean basin , but is found throughout the world . It forms a symbiotic relationship with the bacterium Sinorhizobium meliloti , which is capable of nitrogen fixation . Its common names include blue alfalfa , sickle alfalfa , sickle medick , yellow lucerne , and yellow - flowered alfalfa .  - Triterpenoid saponins are triterpenes which belong to the group of saponin compounds. Triterpenes are a type of terpene containing 30 carbon atoms. Triterpenes are assembled from a five-carbon isoprene unit through the cytosolic mevalonate pathway to make a thirty-carbon compound. Some triterpenes are steroidal in nature. Cholesterol, phytosterols and phytoecdysteroids are triterpenes. The triterpenes are subdivided into some 20 groups, depending on their particular structures. Some triterpenoid compounds are found as saponin glycosides which refers to the attachment of various sugar molecules to the triterpene unit. These sugars can be cleaved off in the gut by bacteria, sometimes allowing the aglycone (triterpene) to be absorbed into the bloodstream or to insert into cell membranes.   - Flavonoids (or bioflavonoids) (from the Latin word \\"flavus\\" meaning yellow, their color in nature) are a class of plant and fungus secondary metabolites.  - Root nodules occur on the roots of plants (primarily Fabaceae) that associate with symbiotic nitrogen-fixing bacteria. Under nitrogen-limiting conditions, capable plants form a symbiotic relationship with a host-specific strain of bacteria known as rhizobia. This process has evolved multiple times within the Fabaceae, as well as in other species found within the Rosid clade. The Fabaceae include legume crops such as beans and peas.  - Sinorhizobium meliloti is a Gram-negative nitrogen-fixing bacterium (rhizobium). It forms a symbiotic relationship with legumes from the genera \\"Medicago\\", \\"Melilotus\\" and \\"Trigonella\\", including the model legume \\"Medicago truncatula\\". This symbiosis results in a new plant organ termed a root nodule. The \\"S. meliloti\\" genome contains three replicons: a chromosome (~3.7 megabases) and two chromids, pSymA (~1.4 megabases) and pSymB (~1.7 megabases). Five \\"S. meliloti\\" genomes have been sequenced to date: Rm1021, AK83, BL225C, Rm41, and SM11  - Medicago truncatula, the barrelclover, strong-spined medick, barrel medic, or barrel medick, is a small annual legume native to the Mediterranean region that is used in genomic research. It is a low-growing, clover-like plant 1060 cm tall with trifoliate leaves. Each leaflet is rounded, 12 cm long, often with a dark spot in the center. The flowers are yellow, produced singly or in a small inflorescence of two to five together; the fruit is a small, spiny pod.  - A legume (or ) is a plant or its fruit or seed in the family Fabaceae (or Leguminosae). Legumes are grown agriculturally, primarily for their grain seed called pulse, for livestock forage and silage, and as soil-enhancing green manure. Well-known legumes include alfalfa, clover, peas, beans, lentils, lupin bean, mesquite, carob, soybeans, peanuts and tamarind. \\"Fabaceae\\" is the most common family found in tropical rainforests and in dry forests in the Americas and Africa.

Write an article with the title: \\"U.S. begins killing barred owls to help spotted owl\\"","output":"Title: U.S. begins killing barred owls to help spotted owl Step 1: Research the topic Before starting the article, it's essential to gather information on the subject, understand the rationale behind this decision, know the parties involved, and analyze any consequences of this action. A thorough research process ensures the content is accurate, informative, and credible. Step 2: Create an outline To ensure the article is well-structured and organized, creating an outline makes it easier to divide the content into appropriate sections. The outline should include the introduction, background, key reasons, possible consequences, and conclusion. Outline: 1. Introduction 2. The background of spotted owl and barred owl populations 3. Reasons for this intervention 4. The methods used 5. Possible consequences 6. Conclusion Step 3: Write the introduction The introduction should catch the reader's attention and provide a brief overview of what the article will discuss. It should set the tone for the rest of the article and provide context for the situation. Introduction: The U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service (USFWS) has recently implemented a controversial program to save the endangered northern spotted owl. The plan includes killing barred owls, a close cousin species that has contributed to the spotted owl's population decline. This article will explore the background of the issue, reasons for this intervention, methods used, possible consequences, and its long-term implications. Step 4: Write the background The background section should focus on the history, habitat, and population trends of both owl species. It should also discuss the causes behind the population decline of spotted owls. Background: The northern spotted owl, native to the Pacific Northwest, has been an endangered species since 1990 due to logging and habitat loss. Barred owls, which primarily inhabited the East Coast and Midwest, expanded their range westward in the 20th century, resulting in direct competition with the spotted owl for food and nesting sites. Barred owls are more aggressive and adaptable, outcompeting spotted owls and contributing to their dwindling numbers. Step 5: Explain the reasons for intervention This section should focus on the USFWS's rationale for intervening in such a drastic manner and any alternative solutions considered. Reasons for intervention: The USFWS decided to intervene by controlling the barred owl population, citing this invasive species' impact on spotted owl numbers. The goal is to give the spotted owl a better chance to recover by reducing its direct competition. While less drastic alternatives have been considered, such as habitat restoration and captive breeding, these solutions have not been as effective in the short term as the culling of barred owls. Step 6: Describe the methods used This section should provide information on how the USFWS is carrying out the barred owl removal and any related legal or ethical concerns. Methods used: Trained wildlife officials are tasked with locating and humanely euthanizing barred owls in specified areas. The process obeys strict guidelines to ensure minimal distress to the birds. Despite the USFWS's careful approach, the culling has sparked debate among conservationists and animal rights activists. Step 7: Discuss possible consequences The possible consequences section should discuss the potential outcomes and long-term effects of the culling program, both positive and negative. Possible consequences: This intervention poses several possible consequences, such as providing the spotted owl with a chance to recover and regain its native habitat. On the other hand, there are concerns that culling barred owls may disrupt the ecosystem and have unintended effects on other species. Step 8: Write the conclusion The conclusion should summarize the article's main points and offer a balanced perspective on the intervention, acknowledging its potential benefits and drawbacks. Conclusion: The USFWS's decision to cull barred owls in an effort to save the endangered northern spotted owl underscores the complexity of species conservation. While this intervention may offer a short-term solution for the spotted owl population, it's important to recognize that broader habitat restoration and environmental protection measures are crucial for long-term conservation efforts. Ultimately, the success of such interventions depends on a comprehensive understanding of the ecosystems involved and their delicate balance."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

It now houses the reception area for the Training and Event Centre. The first floor of the building was used as training rooms for Cub Scout Leaders. The clock on the front of the building was a gift from a former Japanese Chief Scout, Count Sano, who was present at an early training course at Gilwell Park. The weather vane on the roof depicts Dick Turpin, who was rumoured to live on the site. Close to the estate entrance, The Lodge was built in 1934 as the Camp Chief's (later succeeded by the Director of Programme and Development) home. The building is now used to accommodate Scout Association staff and host internal meetings. The Gilwell Farm is the oldest building on the site still standing, dating from the 1600s. The building started as two separate cottages. In the grounds of the building is the last remaining well on site, known as Gil Well. The Farm was refurbished from its derelict site, opening in 2015 as the new offices and reception of Scout Adventures Gilwell Park .

The boyfriend always told me the groceries were a help. My daughter complained she already had too many clothes and if I tried to surprise her with something new. I think my husband and I embarrass our daughter now practically no matter what we do just because we’re parents and maybe because we’re older in our 60’s and too happy to see her and too eager to please and we inadvertently treat our daughter like she is still a kid although she will be 22. I’ve never had a deliberate favorite thing to do except maybe by accident when I used to share too many photos of the cats when I used to be on FB? Parents can’t help but embarrass their children beyond a certain age maybe? I can picture if we had an in the ground pool and my husband and I were continually doing silly moves and cannon ball jumping in I think or even simply lazing around in ridiculous color and style too teeny bathing suits for our age that too would embarrass my daughter. When push comes to shove parents like myself don’t have to be too inventive or think much to come up with things they might do that embarrass their kids. My daughter told me she could not stand to go to the movies with me because I used to cry during movies. She never forgets one time I got emotional during a movie “Spirit” my husband and I took her to when she was little.

The answer to the question: What authors used a writing style that broke away from the style started during the Han dynasty? is inside the article: The Tang period was a golden age of Chinese literature and art. There are over 48,900 poems penned by some 2,200 Tang authors that have survived until modern times. Skill in the composition of poetry became a required study for those wishing to pass imperial examinations, while poetry was also heavily competitive; poetry contests amongst guests at banquets and courtiers were common. Poetry styles that were popular in the Tang included gushi and jintishi, with the renowned poet Li Bai (701–762) famous for the former style, and poets like Wang Wei (701–761) and Cui Hao (704–754) famous for their use of the latter. Jintishi poetry, or regulated verse, is in the form of eight-line stanzas or seven characters per line with a fixed pattern of tones that required the second and third couplets to be antithetical (although the antithesis is often lost in translation to other languages). Tang poems remained popular and great emulation of Tang era poetry began in the Song dynasty; in that period, Yan Yu (嚴羽; active 1194–1245) was the first to confer the poetry of the High Tang (c. 713–766) era with \\"canonical status within the classical poetic tradition.\\" Yan Yu reserved the position of highest esteem among all Tang poets for Du Fu (712–770), who was not viewed as such in his own era, and was branded by his peers as an anti-traditional rebel.The Classical Prose Movement was spurred in large part by the writings of Tang authors Liu Zongyuan (773–819) and Han Yu (768–824). This new prose style broke away from the poetry tradition of the piantiwen (騙體文, \\"parallel prose\\") style begun in the Han dynasty. Although writers of the Classical Prose Movement imitated piantiwen, they criticized it for its often vague content and lack of colloquial language, focusing more on clarity and precision to make their writing more direct. This guwen (archaic prose) style can be traced back to Han Yu, and would become largely associated with orthodox Neo-Confucianism.Short story fiction and tales were also popular during the Tang, one of the..., can you guess it ?

Answer the following question: What is the answer for the question: What is the name of the neighborhood that is now upscale and a shopping district? from the following article ?  Efforts began shortly after the explosion to clear debris, repair buildings, and establish temporary housing for survivors left homeless by the explosion. By late January 1918, around 5,000 were still without shelter. A reconstruction committee under Colonel Robert Low constructed 832 new housing units, which were furnished by the Massachusetts-Halifax Relief Fund.Partial train service resumed from a temporary rail terminal in the city's South End on 7 December. Full service resumed on 9 December when tracks were cleared and the North Street Station reopened. The Canadian Government Railways created a special unit to clear and repair railway yards as well as rebuild railway piers and the Naval Dockyard. Most piers returned to operation by late December and were repaired by January. The North End Halifax neighbourhood of Richmond bore the brunt of the explosion. In 1917, Richmond was considered a working-class neighbourhood and had few paved roads. After the explosion, the Halifax Relief Commission approached the reconstruction of Richmond as an opportunity to improve and modernize the city's North End. English town planner Thomas Adams and Montreal architectural firm Ross and Macdonald were recruited to design a new housing plan for Richmond. Adams, inspired by the Victorian garden city movement, aimed to provide public access to green spaces and to create a low-rise, low-density and multifunctional urban neighbourhood. The planners designed 326 large homes that each faced a tree-lined, paved boulevard. They specified that the homes be built with a new and innovative fireproof material, blocks of compressed cement called Hydrostone. The first of these homes was occupied by March 1919. Once finished, the Hydrostone neighbourhood consisted of homes, businesses and parks, which helped create a new sense of community in the North End of Halifax. It has now become an upscale neighbourhood and shopping district. In contrast, the equally poor and underdeveloped area of Africville was not included in reconstruction...

The 2013 Africa Cup of Nations, also known as the Orange Africa Cup of Nations South Africa 2013 for sponsorship reasons, was the 29th Africa Cup of Nations, the football championship of Africa organized by the Confederation of African Football (CAF). The tournament took place between 19 January and 10 February 2013. The matches were held in five different cities in South Africa, namely Johannesburg, Durban, Port Elizabeth, Rustenburg, and Nelspruit. Nigeria's victory in the tournament marked the third time the Super Eagles had won the competition. Their previous tournament wins were in 1980 and 1994. Under the stewardship of their coach, Stephen Keshi, Nigeria won the tournament, defeating Burkina Faso in the final. The winning goal was scored by Nigeria's Sunday Mba on 40 minutes, securing a 1-0 victory for the Super Eagles. This moment was particularly significant as Stephen Keshi became one of the few individuals who has won the Africa Cup of Nations both as a player and a coach. Keshi was part of the team that lifted the trophy in 1994 when Nigeria won their second title. In addition to the championship, Nigeria’s achievement also included qualifying for the 2013 FIFA Confederations Cup in Brazil as the representative from CAF. The 2013 win helped to support Nigeria's ranking in the FIFA World Rankings, too. However, it is also worth mentioning that Nigerian national football team could not carry the trophy to home in several following years of African Cup of Nations.

To develop a more well-rounded and in-depth understanding of Addison, one should consider various aspects of their personality, experiences, and characteristics. Some factors to consider when attempting to describe Addison might include: 1. Academic Performance: Was Addison an outstanding student, consistently demonstrating academic excellence? Or were they an average student who had to work diligently to maintain decent grades? 2. Area of Study: Did Addison study a subject they were passionate about, or did they follow a specific career path to meet external expectations or societal norms? 3. Personal Interests: What kind of hobbies or extracurricular activities does Addison enjoy? Their interests might provide insight into their personality traits, such as creativity, dedication, or competitiveness. 4. Social Life: Was Addison an extroverted person who made many friends and enjoyed participating in social events, or were they more introverted and preferred to spend time alone or in small groups? 5. Resilience and Persistence: Did Addison face any significant obstacles or challenges during their time in college, such as personal issues, financial difficulties, or academic setbacks? How did they handle these challenges and recover from them? 6. Personal Values and Ethics: What are Addison's fundamental beliefs and principles?

Future Plans and Goals: Now that Addison has graduated from college, what do they hope to achieve in their personal and professional life? Does their graduation mark the beginning of new endeavors or a continuation of ongoing pursuits? While describing Addison as \\"very happy\\" in reference to their recent graduation is valid, it is essential to recognize that this description is only one aspect of their overall personality and experiences.

It's like when you're playing tag, and you don't want to let the person who's \\"it\\" be too close to you. Powerful people think that being too friendly could make them seem weaker to others.

Evan's research took place at a big, important school called the University of California. They did lots of tests and talked to many people to learn more about this smiling adventure. So the next time you see someone important not smiling back at a powerful person, you'll know it's because they're trying to protect themselves, just like in a game of tag.

We hope that more advanced learners and teachers will also find it useful. The book is a comprehensive survey of structures and forms, written in clear modern English and illustrated with numerous examples. Areas of particular difficulty have been given special attention. Differences between conversational usage and strict grammatical forms are shown but the emphasis is on controversial forms. In the fourth edition the main changes are as follows. 1. Explanation and examples have been brought up to date. 2. There is now more information on countable and uncountable nouns, attributive and predicative adjectives, adverbs of place, sentence adverbs, cleft sentences, prepositions, conjunctives, modal verbs, perfect tenses, infinitive constructions, the passive, purpose clauses and nouns. 3. Some material has been rearranged to make comparisons easier. For example, parts of chapters on can, may, must etc. are now grouped by functions; verbs of liking and preference have a chapter to themselves; suggestions and invitations have joined the chapter on commands, requests and advice. 4. The contents list now summaries every edition heading, and there is a new index containing many more entries references. In this edition the sign \\"~\\" is frequently used to show a change of speaker in examples of dialogue. Note also that although the sign \\"=\\"\\"\\" sometimes connects two words or expressions with the same meaning, it is often used more freely, e.g. to indicate a transformation from active to passive or direct to indirect speech.

He served as Chairman of the Florida Board of Control from 1960–1964. Harrison greatly impacted the State University System of Florida and helped desegregate Florida colleges and universities. He served as President of the Florida Bar in 1957. Based on that paragraph can we conclude that this sentence is true? Baya M. Harrison was born and died during the 20th century.","output":"Yes, based on the information provided, we can conclude that the sentence \\"Baya M. Harrison was born and died during the 20th century\\" is true. Baya M. Harrison, Jr. was born in 1912 and died in 1975, both of which fall within the 20th century (1901-2000). Baya M. Harrison, Jr. was not only a prominent politician and attorney in Florida but also played an influential role in the State University System of Florida as the Chairman of the Florida Board of Control from 1960 to 1964. The Florida Board of Control was responsible for overseeing the educational policies, allocations and budgets for the state university system. Harrison's tenure in this position allowed him to address the challenges of expanding higher education opportunities in Florida and led him to contribute significantly to the desegregation of colleges and universities in the state. His efforts played an essential role in ensuring equal access to post-secondary education. Furthermore, Baya M. Harrison, Jr. served as President of the Florida Bar in 1957, an esteemed position within the legal profession in the state of Florida. The Florida Bar, created in 1949, is responsible for regulating legal practitioners in Florida, establishing ethical and professional standards, and offering educational programs to its members. Serving as the President of the Florida Bar demonstrates Harrison's leadership skills and dedication to ensuring that the legal profession in Florida upheld high standards and maintained a strong reputation. In conclusion, Baya M. Harrison, Jr., born in 1912 and deceased in 1975, had a substantial impact on the legal profession and higher education system in Florida during the 20th century.

A resolute stylist with a great sense of purpose to his films, Gosha teamed up with Shintaro Katsu (of Zatoichi fame) to produce this scathing indictment of mindless nationalist loyalty.  \\"Tenchu\\" (heavenly judgment) is the word that the loyalists to the emperor yell while assassinating enemies or \\"traitors\\" to the cause. Katsu plays up his character' simple minded allegiance to a manipulative politician all in the name of patriotic pride. Anybody who questions the politician is labeled a \\"traitor\\" and becomes an assassination target. One of the best photographed films ever, many shots are incredible compositions of form, color and light. The fight scenes are frequent and very bloody and brutal. The blood becomes a part of the color palette Gosha uses for his images. Gorgeous and disturbing. While the personal story is simple to follow, the historical background is complicated and while a basic history lesson for this time in Japan would be very helpful you can struggle through the film without it. The few drawbacks to the film are the music track, the length and Katsu's occasional scenery chewing. He has a drunken scene that's way over the top for a film but actually a very accurate depiction of a drunk. Downbeat but one of the great chambara films.

Article: Libya's economy witnessed increasing privatization; although rejecting the socialist policies of nationalized industry advocated in The Green Book, government figures asserted that they were forging \\"people's socialism\\" rather than capitalism. Gaddafi welcomed these reforms, calling for wide-scale privatization in a March 2003 speech. In 2003, the oil industry was largely sold to private corporations, and by 2004, there was 40 billion of direct foreign investment in Libya, a sixfold rise over 2003. Sectors of Libya's population reacted against these reforms with public demonstrations, and in March 2006, revolutionary hard-liners took control of the GPC cabinet; although scaling back the pace of the changes, they did not halt them. In 2010, plans were announced that would have seen half the Libyan economy privatized over the following decade. While there was no accompanying political liberalization, with Gaddafi retaining predominant control, in March 2010, the government devolved further powers to the municipal councils. Rising numbers of reformist technocrats attained positions in the country's governance; best known was Gaddafi's son and heir apparent Saif al-Islam Gaddafi, who was openly critical of Libya's human rights record. He led a group who proposed the drafting of the new constitution, although it was never adopted, and in October 2009 was appointed to head the PSLC. Involved in encouraging tourism, Saif founded several privately run media channels in 2008, but after criticising the government they were nationalised in 2009. In October 2010, Gaddafi apologized to African leaders on behalf of Arab nations for their involvement in the African slave trade.

Movie title: Vivacious Lady Movie plot: Lobby card for the film Vivacious Lady is a story of love at first sight between a young botany professor named Peter Morgan Jr. (Stewart) and a nightclub singer named Francey (Rogers). The film also has comedic elements, including repeatedly frustrated attempts by the newlywed couple to find a moment alone with each other. The story begins when Peter is sent to Manhattan to retrieve his playboy cousin Keith (Ellison) and immediately falls in love with Francey. After a whirlwind one-day courtship, Peter and Francey get married, and they and Keith return to the Morgan family's home, where Peter teaches at the university run by his father Peter Morgan Sr. (Coburn). Mr. Morgan is known for being a proud, overbearing man, so Peter is afraid to tell him about the marriage. When they arrive, Mr. Morgan and Peter's high-society fiancÃ©e Helen (Mercer) initially take Francey for another of Keith's girlfriends. While Peter decides how to approach his father with the news, Francey stays at a women-only hotel, and Peter and Keith introduce her as a new botany student. Peter mentions Francey to his father twice, but on both occasions, Mr. Morgan interrupts and ignores his son, and when Peter becomes insistent, his apparently ailing mother (Bondi) has a flare-up of her heart condition, making any further conversation impossible. For his third attempt, Peter decides to announce the marriage to his parents at the university's student-faculty prom. Keith brings Francey to the prom as his own guest, and Francey, still posing as a student, develops a friendly rapport with Mrs. Morgan, but gets into a nasty brawl with Helen in which Francey accidentally punches Peter's father. Peter says nothing at the prom, but blurts the news to his father just as Mr. Morgan is about to give an important speech, resulting in another argument and another flare-up of Mrs. Morgan's heart condition. This prevents Mrs. Morgan from learning who Francey is, but she accidentally finds out from Francey herself during a conversation in Francey's... A:","output":"In the movie \\"Vivacious Lady,\\" Mr. Morgan, played by Charles Coburn, demands that Francey leave Peter Morgan Jr., his son who is portrayed by James Stewart. The film revolves around the whirlwind romance and subsequent marriage between Peter, a young botany professor, and Francey, a nightclub singer played by Ginger Rogers. The couple's attempts to find a moment alone together continuously get thwarted, adding comedic elements to the movie's storyline. The conflict arises as Peter is too afraid to reveal the news of his marriage to his father, Mr. Morgan, who has a reputation for being a proud and overbearing man. Mr. Morgan, as well as Peter's high-society fiancée Helen, initially mistakes Francey for one of Keith's girlfriends (Keith is Peter's playboy cousin, played by James Ellison). To buy himself some time, Peter enlists Keith's help to introduce Francey as a new botany student while she stays at a women-only hotel. Throughout the film, Peter makes several attempts to tell his father about his marriage but is repeatedly interrupted, and each time Peter finally tries to insist on discussing the matter, his mother's heart condition flares up, halting any potential conversation. This series of unfortunate events culminates at the university's student-faculty prom, where Peter plans to finally announce his marriage. However, things don't go as planned, and when he eventually blurts out the news to his father just before a crucial speech, it results in an argument and another flare-up of his mother's heart condition. Mrs. Morgan, played by Beulah Bondi, only learns of Francey's identity after a conversation in Francey's hotel room, where she accidentally reveals her relationship with Peter. Upon discovering this information, Mr. Morgan demands that Francey leave his son. The movie, however, concludes on a lighter note when the entire Morgan family, including Mr. Morgan, finally embraces Francey as Peter's wife. In conclusion, Mr. Morgan demands that Francey leave his son, Peter, after discovering their marriage. The film presents the struggles and comedic misadventures of a newlywed couple as they try to navigate family expectations and keep their love afloat."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant that follows instruction extremely well.

(CNN) -- Oh, the stories we storytellers tell. Like the story of brave Manti Te'o and his doomed girlfriend. We love a good story. We love spinning a good yarn. And we repeat and repeat and repeat them. Babe Ruth was a big boy from an orphanage. Seabiscuit was a little horse that lost its first 17 races. Jim Thorpe was a Native American born in 1887 or '88 (as far as we know) with the name Wa-Tho-Huck. It is their legend, their lore. The same way that George Washington cut down that tree or Abe Lincoln split those logs. The same way that Lana Turner was discovered at a drugstore called Schwab's or that Sylvester Stallone wrote the part of Rocky but wouldn't sell the script unless he could play it. Documented achievement is what turns a man or woman into a public figure. But the story behind the story, well, that is also a telltale aspect of any human's fame. Yes, he did win this, she did win that, but come on, tell me a little more. How did they get this far? Where did they come from? Who influenced them? What else should we know? Muhammad Ali wasn't a mere boxer; he was a man who changed his name and faith, a man who would fight anybody in a ring but refused to go to a war, a perfect physical specimen and a loudmouth who fell frail and all but mute from an affliction he couldn't beat. Lots of fighters won fights. The stories are what have made Ali Ali. It separates names from the norm. He or she is not just a success but a remarkable story, an inspiration, a believe-it-or-not. He was a left-handed pitcher with no right hand who threw a no-hitter for the New York Yankees. (Jim Abbott.) He ran in the Olympic Games on prosthetic legs. (Oscar Pistorius.) She sprinted to an Olympic gold even though they once nearly amputated her feet. (Gail Devers.) You can't make up stories like those. Joe DiMaggio was a ballplayer. We know that Joe played ball better than most. But we also know Joe was married to Marilyn Monroe. We cannot tell you a lot about Willie Mays or Stan Musial except how they played ball. Both played it as well as Joe did ... hey, maybe better. But in some cases, the stories of certain greats are as unforgettable as their deeds. So, we tell their tales. The subjects often furnish the details. We rely on honesty for accuracy. A story that has been reported is a story that ends up repeated because it must be true. We lazily assume facts not in evidence. Or we lean on: \\"Who would make up such a thing?\\" Which brings us to Manti Te'o. The grim fairy tale of The Linebacker Of Notre Dame is one we likely will tell for a while. We woke up Thursday morning and began reading a story that got curiouser and curiouser with every sentence. His girlfriend wasn't real? She wasn't in a car crash? She didn't die of leukemia? He never met her? She didn't even exist??? Irish blarney is a myth, is it not? Pots o' gold and St. Patrick and the snakes and how are things in Glocca Morra and all that? Aye, we aren't so gullible that we will swallow anything, would we, now? So, OK. We tell and retell the true and false legends of Knute Rockne and winning one for the Gipper and all that, but we don't really mind. And maybe that October sky wasn't really as blue-grey as Grantland Rice told us it was when those Four Horsemen of the Apocalypse rode to a great Notre Dame victory on the ol' gridiron. \\"South Bend, it sounds almost like dancing!\\" gushed Katharine Hepburn in \\"The Philadelphia Story,\\" and what a funny story that was. Manti Te'o's story, however .... not so funny. He is a Notre Dame football star. Trust me, this alone is not a news event. Notre Dame turns out football stars the way Hostess turned out Twinkies. One after another after another. He is also a Hawaiian kid with an apostrophe in his surname. Now that, that is not something you see on a Notre Dame football field every Saturday. A nice, noteworthy thing, something that separated Te'o from the pack, somewhat. He is also a natural born leader. One who helped take Notre Dame to an undefeated season -- rare, in this day and age -- and to the national championship game. In the vote for the Heisman Trophy, given to college football's top player of any given season, Te'o was the runner-up. That in itself is an honor, but for a linebacker to do such a thing, a defensive player, it is truly cool. Ahhh, but there was more to the Manti Te'o story, as we watched that story unfold. He had this girlfriend, see. Lennay Kekua was her lovely name. And she died. A few months ago, she was in a car crash, we were told. And then doctors found she also had leukemia, we were told. Her death, as well as that of his grandmother, broke Te'o's heart. But on he played, gallantly, valiantly, fighting on for the Fighting Irish, remaining undefeated against adversity. Until at some point it turned out to be a hoax. Which at some point Notre Dame's administrators discovered. Which at some point Te'o confirmed, although not publicly, not before that January 7 championship game against Alabama. Brent Musburger made the Alabama quarterback's girlfriend an overnight sensation that night, gushing about her looks. Musburger did not make the Notre Dame linebacker's girlfriend a star that night. She wasn't there. Turns out, she was never anywhere. We love a good story and will continue to tell them. I, myself, once wrote of a Notre Dame football star, Chris Zorich, who played in the Orange Bowl one night, flew home to Chicago the next morning and found his mother dead inside their home. I made people cry with that story. I damn near cried myself while typing it. Manti Te'o's story makes me want to laugh as much as cry. Mainly because I can barely comprehend it. All those stories being told out there on TV and in print about his \\"girlfriend\\" -- uh, he might have mentioned to someone that he'd never even met her. How do the movies put it? \\"Based on a true story?\\" Well, based on a story, anyhow. Everybody's is. The opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of Mike Downey. What is a short summary of the above article?","output":"Manti Te'o, a Notre Dame football star, had a heartbreaking and inspiring story surrounding him as he triumphed on the field. He had a girlfriend named Lennay Kekua, who was in a car crash and later diagnosed with leukemia, eventually passing away. This story of personal tragedy motivated Te'o, making him a symbol of strength and courage in the face of adversity. However, it was later revealed that Kekua never existed and the entire narrative was a hoax. This story captured the public's attention and fascination, highlighting our love for inspiring and dramatic stories. The Manti Te'o story serves as a reminder of the power of storytelling and our willingness to believe in tales that touch our emotions, even when they turn out to be false."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

However, the scale has been criticized because it is still not a true continuum. Despite seven categories being able to provide a more accurate description of sexual orientation than a dichotomous scale it is still difficult to determine which category individuals should be assigned to. In a major study comparing sexual response in homosexual males and females, Masters and Johnson discuss the difficulty of assigning the Kinsey ratings to participants.

Question: What is the name of Beckett's partner? Title: Philadelphia Movie plot: Andrew Beckett (Tom Hanks) is a senior associate at the largest corporate law firm in Philadelphia. Although he lives with his partner Miguel Álvarez (Antonio Banderas), Beckett is not open about his homosexuality at the law firm, nor the fact that he has AIDS. On the day he is assigned the firm's newest and most important case, one of the firm's partners notices a small lesion on Beckett's forehead. Shortly thereafter, Beckett stays home from work for several days to try to find a way to hide his lesions. While at home, he finishes the complaint for the case he has been assigned and then brings it to his office, leaving instructions for his assistants to file the complaint in court on the following day, which marks the end of the statute of limitations for the case. Beckett suffers from bowel spasms at home and is rushed to the hospital. Later that morning, while still at the ER, he receives a frantic call from the firm asking for the complaint, as the paper copy cannot be found and there are no copies on the computer's hard drive. However, the complaint is finally discovered and is filed with the court at the last possible moment. The following day, Beckett is dismissed by the firm's partners, who had previously referred to him as their \\"buddy\\", but now question his professional abilities in light of the misplaced document. Beckett believes that someone deliberately hid his paperwork to give the firm a pretext to fire him, and that the firing is actually as a result of his diagnosis with AIDS. He asks several attorneys to take his case, including personal injury lawyer Joe Miller (Denzel Washington), with whom he had been involved in a previous case. Miller, who is admittedly homophobic and knows little about Beckett's AIDS, initially declines to take the case and immediately visits his doctor to find out if he could have contracted the AIDS through shaking Beckett's hand.

See how close they are to you and whether there are any obstacles, like desks or chairs, that might slow you down if you have to get to the door quickly.  This seems easy, since you walk through your classroom doors almost every day, but reviewing their location will help it become second nature and make it easier to remember in an emergency. If you can evacuate safely, this is often considered the best option for getting away from a school shooting. However, each scenario is different. If you know you can’t run away safely, stay in place and hide. Estimate how far off the ground the windows are to see if you could jump out of them safely in case of an emergency. Watch how your teacher opens and closes the windows, and volunteer to help them to see how it’s done.  You could even stay behind a few minutes after class to practice opening and closing the windows quickly. Ask your teacher first, explaining to them that you want to be as prepared as possible in case of an emergency.

Find the fastest way out from every area on campus, as well as alternate routes in case some ways are blocked off or inaccessible.  Look around campus after school or during lunch when you’re allowed to be out and about. In the unlikely event of a shooting threat, your in-depth knowledge of your school can help you make a quick getaway. Once you’ve set up your own mental evacuation routes, go over them in your head every few days to keep them fresh. Your goal is to turn these routes into an instinct, so that you know how to evacuate in case it ever becomes necessary. Your school probably has its own evacuation routes in place for the unlikely event of a shooting. If you haven’t already learned these routes through drills, you can ask a teacher or administrator what they are.  Remember that in a school shooting situation, you likely won’t be on your own. You can follow the lead of teachers and other adults who are trained to take care of you in these situations. If you somehow do find yourself separated from the group, your own evacuation preparation is your backup. You can use what you know to make a safe escape.","output":"This article talks about how to be prepared in case something bad, like a school shooting, happens. It's important to know where all the exits in your classroom are and how to quickly get to them. Also, learn how to open and close windows and know if it's safe to jump out of them. Always think about the quickest way to leave the school from different places and find the fastest way out. Make sure you remember these things and practice them in your mind. Listen to your teachers and other grown-ups who know what to do in scary situations.

Given the question: Tropical forests (rainforests) receive more insolation and rainfall over longer growing seasons than any other environment on earth. With these elevated temperatures, insolation and rainfall, biomass is extremely productive leading to the production of as much as 800 grams of carbon per square meter per year. Higher temperatures and larger amounts of water contribute to higher rates of chemical weathering. Increased rates of decomposition cause smaller amounts of fulvic acid to percolate and leach metals from the zone of active weathering. Thus, in stark contrast to soil in forests, tropical forests have little to no podzolization and therefore do not have marked visual and chemical contrasts with the soil layers. Instead, the mobile metals Mg, Fe and Al are precipitated as oxide minerals giving the soil a rusty red color.  The Farlook forest is classified as a tropical forest, and the Celeste forest is not a tropical forest. Jessica is currently looking for a forest to go camping in and is trying to choose which of these two forests she will visit for a week.

Answer the above question based on the context below:  Grunge is generally characterized by a sludgy electric guitar sound with a \\"thick\\" middle register and rolled-off treble tone and a high level of distortion and fuzz, typically created with small 1970s-style stompbox pedals, with some guitarists chaining several fuzz pedals together and plugging them into a tube amplifier and speaker cabinet. Grunge guitarists use very loud Marshall guitar amplifiers  and some used powerful Mesa-Boogie amplifiers, including Kurt Cobain and Dave Grohl (the latter in early, grunge-oriented Foo Fighters songs ). Grunge has been called the rock genre with the most \\"lugubrious sound\\"; the use of heavy distortion and loud amps has been compared to a massive \\"buildup of sonic fog\\". or even dismissed as \\"noise\\" by one critic. As with metal and punk, a key part of grunge's sound is very distorted power chords played on the electric guitar.Whereas metal guitarists' overdriven sound generally comes from a combination of overdriven amplifiers and distortion pedals, grunge guitarists typically got all of their \\"dirty\\" sound from overdrive and fuzz pedals, with the amp just used to make the sound louder. Grunge guitarists tended to use the Fender Twin Reverb and the Fender Champion 100 combo amps (Cobain used both of these amps). The use of pedals by grunge guitarists was a move away from the expensive, studio-grade rackmount effects units used in other rock genres. The positive way that grunge bands viewed stompbox pedals can be seen in Mudhoney's use of the name of two overdrive pedals, the Univox Super-Fuzz and the Big Muff, in the title of their \\"debut EP Superfuzz Bigmuff\\".  In the song Mudride, the band's guitars were said to have \\"growled malevolently\\" through its \\"Cro-magnon slog\\". Answer:","output":"Based on the context provided, the two brands of amplifiers that grunge guitarists commonly use are Marshall and Mesa-Boogie. Grunge guitarists, such as Kurt Cobain and Dave Grohl, gravitated towards these brands for their ability to produce a thick, sludgy electric guitar sound with a high level of distortion and fuzz, which is characteristic of the grunge genre. Marshall amplifiers have been widely used in the grunge scene for their loud, powerful sound and their versatility. These amplifiers helped shape the heavy, distorted tones that grunge guitarists aimed for. Many grunge artists opted for Marshall amplifiers because of their reliability and robustness in delivering a consistent sound, even at high volume levels. Mesa-Boogie amplifiers, on the other hand, were favored by some grunge guitarists for their ability to deliver powerful, thick tones with ample amounts of distortion. Mesa-Boogie amplifiers often provide a more aggressive sound than Marshall amplifiers, which some grunge guitarists find particularly appealing for their music. Kurt Cobain and early grunge-oriented Foo Fighters songs are examples where Mesa-Boogie amplifiers were used to achieve the signature grunge sound. In addition to the amplifiers, grunge guitarists often employed various stompbox pedals to further enhance their distorted, fuzzy tones. The Fender Twin Reverb and Fender Champion 100 combo amps are also mentioned for their usage by grunge guitarists like Cobain. The use of pedals in grunge music is a departure from the expensive studio-grade rackmount effects units commonly used in other rock genres. This preference for stompbox pedals is exemplified by Mudhoney's debut EP, Superfuzz Bigmuff, which references two popular overdrive pedals, the Univox Super-Fuzz and the Big Muff. Grunge's distinctive sound, characterized by heavy distortion, loud amps, and powerful power chords played on the electric guitar, can be attributed to a combination of these amplifiers and stompbox pedals, providing a unique sonic experience that has been both celebrated and criticized over the years. Through the use of Marshall and Mesa-Boogie amplifiers, alongside various stompbox pedals, grunge guitarists shaped the genre's signature \\"lugubrious\\" and heavily distorted sound."},{"instruction":"User will you give you a task with some instruction.

Imagine that the given text is a social media post, and you have to write the title of the post, so the users can decide to read the main text or not. My girlfriend and I are both liberal in almost every sense of the word.  We have never disagreed about anything you could call a political issue.   I've always been more reserved in expressing my political opinions for a lot of reasons (some for professional reasons, but mostly because it's never comfortable).   For the last two years, for obvious reasons, politics had become a bigger part of our daily life than I'm okay with.  So I tend to not respond to her attempts to start conversation, or I politely (as politely as I can) tell her I'm not in the mood to talk about it.  She knows it makes me angry and uncomfortable and if it's all the same I'd rather leave it out of my day.  Things came to a head tonight when she convinced me to watch the Netflix documentary \\"Get Me Roger Stone\\" and I couldn't finish it.  I was getting too angry, I've got work tomorrow, I can't be dwelling on things like this while I'm trying to run a small business.   To her credit, she said she understood and was happy to switch it to something else. But when I mentioned, in passing, that I was recommending the doc to my mother (who has the same views and outspokenness of my girlfriend), she began to start the same usual rant about the state of things and was upset I didn't finish it.  I politely told her I still wasn't in the mood to talk about it but wanted to share that I was passing along her recommendation to my mom.  She got pretty upset, telling me that it was important for people to be politically aware, and that, since her entire family are far right wing, I am the only person she can talk to about this.  I told her I was aware, but didn't want that awareness to derail the little free time I have, especially with her, and wanted to stay in a good mood.  And that there's no use in discussing if it's just to an echo chamber.  We'd be angrily agreeing with each other for hours.  And that I didn't appreciate her insinuation that I was blissfully and intentionally ignorant to what's been going on for the sake of my own comfort, I just didn't want to talk about it. She lost her cool and stormed off, because she was getting angry and uncomfortable, even though I was willing to keep discussing it, at least to explain where I was coming from.  I didn't want to point out the irony in any of that, because that might have made me the asshole.  And I was happy the topic was being dropped.  But now we're sharing an awkward silence and I'm worried that I may be selfish and calloused to her needs due to the discomfort that usually prevents my own family taking about political or religious topics.  Or that I'm selfish in considering my own comfort over her's.  But nobody's comfortable getting increasingly upset about this kind of stuff, even if it is an echo chamber.  Am I the asshole?

This intriguing phenomenon sheds light on the world of late-night comedy writing. It's not unusual for late-night shows to touch on similar topics, as they are often responding to the same current events or gossip worthy of a laugh. However, it's rare that their jokes would align so closely as they did in this instance. This raises the question of whether comedy writers tend to share ideas or simply think alike due to the nature of their profession. One possibility is that comedy writers have an unspoken network of communication, sharing joke ideas to achieve a stronger sense of unity within the industry. This collaboration may help them come up with more effective punchlines by pooling their collective creativity. However, this theory may seem unlikely to some, given the competitiveness of comedy and the powerful incentive for jokes to remain original, as they are intellectual property protected by copyright law. Another plausible explanation is that comedy writers share a similar thought process, which can cause them to independently develop very similar jokes. For instance, they may have a greater sensitivity to humor in everyday situations, or possess a strong inclination towards sarcasm. This would mean that their minds are primed to think in a certain way, and as a result, they end up devising parallel jokes when faced with the same stimulus. It is also worth considering that comedy writers consume similar content, both for inspiration and to keep up with current trends and events. This shared body of common knowledge, coupled with the writers' ability to identify comedic opportunities, may lead them to unknowingly create closely aligned jokes. Additionally, comedy writers are often influenced by their favorite comedic sources or performers, which can invariably lead to overlapping ideas. Ultimately, the fact that Leno and Letterman shared such similar jokes on this particular night seems to be more of a rare coincidence than an indicator of a larger trend. It's unlikely that comedy writers frequently share ideas enough to account for the similarity in material, as doing so would undermine the creativity and originality that is valued in the field. However, the striking commonality observed in this case does prompt a deeper examination of the creative processes that underlie the craft of comedy writing, and it wouldn't be surprising to discover that there's a lot more shared subconscious inspiration at play than we think."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant that follows instruction extremely well.

Pick your answer from: --his relationship with middle easterners is strained --he doesn't like sandy warfare --not enough information --his son lost his life during combat Q: U.S. President-elect Donald Trump's choice to lead the Department of Homeland Security, retired Marine General John Kelly, is one of the U.S. military's longest-serving commanders and the most senior officer since 9/11 to lose a child in combat. Blunt-spoken and popular with military personnel, Kelly, 66, was born and raised in Boston. He initially enlisted in the U.S. Marine Corps in 1970, and was discharged from active duty as a sergeant in 1972. He returned to the Marine Corps after graduation from the University of Massachusetts Boston in 1976. Kelly rose through the ranks to serve as the commanding general of the Multi-National Force West in Iraq from February 2008 to February 2009, and as the commander of Marine Forces Reserve and Marine Forces North in October 2009. He succeeded General Douglas Fraser as commander of U.S. Southern Command (USSOUTHCOM) on Nov. 19, 2012. As the head of USSOUTHCOM, Kelly was in charge of the military jail at Guantanamo Bay, Cuba, and also was exposed to immigration, drug trafficking and other cross-border problems over a sprawling area that encompasses 32 countries in the Caribbean, Central America and South America. Kelly took a tough tone on border security, warning Congress last year about the risks of smuggling rings in Mexico and Central America that spirited \\"tens of thousands of people,\\" including unaccompanied children, \\"to our nation's doorstep.\\" He also clashed with the Obama administration over plans to close Guantanamo and the Pentagon's order that opened all jobs in combat units to women, including the most elite forces like the Navy SEALs. In 2010, Kelly became the highest ranking U.S. military officer to lose a child in combat operations in Southwest Asia. His youngest son, 1st Lieutenant Robert Michael Kelly, was killed in action in Afghanistan on Nov. 9, 2010.

Translate to English","output":"\\"Low salaries, the low social status of healthcare specialists, as well as poor management of the system, are just a few of the problems in the healthcare sector,\\" said a doctor from Sofia with 22 years of experience in otolaryngology for SETimes. The healthcare sector faces numerous challenges that contribute to its current state. Among these challenges, low salaries, the decreased social status of medical professionals, and poor management of the system are some of the most pressing issues. These problems not only affect patient care but can also lead to a shortage of skilled healthcare workers and limit advancements in medical science. Low salaries for medical professionals can have significant consequences for both patient care and the healthcare system as a whole. When salaries do not reflect the high level of skill and dedication required for a medical career, many talented and qualified individuals may opt for other professions or seek work in countries where they will be fairly compensated for their expertise. As a result, the healthcare system may face a scarcity of well-trained professionals who can provide high-quality care to patients. The low social status of healthcare specialists can also impact the sector negatively. Historically, healthcare professionals have been respected and admired for their knowledge and their commitment to saving lives. However, when their social standing is diminished, it can lead to a lack of appreciation for their work and dedication. This can result in job dissatisfaction and burnout, causing medical professionals to leave their positions or even the field, further exacerbating shortages in the healthcare sector. Poor management of the healthcare system is another critical issue contributing to the current challenges faced by the sector. Mismanagement at various levels, including insufficient funding, improper allocation of resources, and ineffective leadership, can cause systemic inefficiencies that affect patient care. Hospitals may be inadequately staffed, lacking in necessary equipment or unable to provide essential services. This not only leads to a reduction in the quality of care provided to patients but can also dissuade potential medical professionals from pursuing careers in healthcare. In conclusion, the healthcare sector faces significant hurdles, including low salaries, decreased social status for medical professionals, and poor management of the system. These problems can lead to widespread consequences, such as a shortage of skilled healthcare workers, reduced quality of patient care, and limited progress in medical science. To address these issues and improve the healthcare system, it is essential to prioritize fair compensation for healthcare professionals, recognize and appreciate their contributions to society, and implement effective management practices at all levels of the healthcare system."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant, who knows every language and how to translate one language to another.

Q: Do you think the right answer to the question \\"natural disasters can cause \\" is \\"kill them\\", given that  natural disasters can cause migration ? The answer is:","output":"\\"No, the phrase 'kill them' is not a comprehensive or entirely accurate response to the question 'natural disasters can cause...' While it is true that natural disasters have the potential to cause fatalities, they can also result in a wide range of other outcomes.  Firstly, natural disasters can cause severe property damage. Earthquakes, hurricanes, floods, and other natural events can destroy homes, cities, and entire regions, needing substantial efforts for rebuilding.  Secondly, they can have massive economic impacts. The cost of recovery and rebuilding after a disaster can be immense, not to mention the economic ripple effects caused by interruption of services, loss of trade, and so forth.  Thirdly, a result that parallels your initial point, they can indeed cause migration. People are often compelled to move away from areas that are frequently affected by natural disasters or areas that have been severely damaged and may not recover for a long time.  Fourthly, they can cause trauma and psychological distress. People who have survived natural disasters often suffer from post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD), anxiety, depression, and other mental health issues.  And lastly, they can impact the environment and ecosystem, resulting in loss of biodiversity, soil erosion, water contamination, and more. In conclusion, natural disasters can cause a myriad of effects beyond fatality, including property damage, economic disruption, migration, psychological issues, and environmental impacts.\\""},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

US planes and artillery pounded Falluja on Monday and Iraq #39;s interim Prime Minister Iyad Allawi said he had authorized a US-led offensive to rid the Sunni Muslim city of insurgents. What is this text about?","output":"This text is about a military operation in Falluja, a city in Iraq, that took place on a Monday as a part of the ongoing conflict between coalition forces led by the United States and insurgents in the region. It provides information about the involvement of US planes and artillery in carrying out heavy bombardment in the city. The operation was aimed at eliminating the Sunni Muslim insurgents from Falluja, and was authorized by Iraq's interim Prime Minister, Iyad Allawi.  To provide a more detailed understanding of the events, it is important to consider the historical context in which this operation took place. Falluja is a city located in the Al Anbar province of Iraq, which is known for being a stronghold for various insurgent groups, including members of the Iraqi insurgency, Al-Qaeda in Iraq, and later, the Islamic State (ISIS). The city has witnessed numerous instances of violence and military operations since the US-led invasion of Iraq in 2003. Following the invasion, a power vacuum was created in Iraq that led to the rise of various militant and insurgent groups, which sought to destabilize the newly-formed Iraqi government and challenge the presence of coalition forces in the country. Falluja became a focal point of the insurgency, with the city's large Sunni population providing a base of support for the militants. In response to the growing insurgent presence in Falluja, the US-led coalition carried out frequent operations to regain control over the city and eliminate the threat posed by the militants. The text refers to one such operation, authorized by Iraq's interim Prime Minister, Iyad Allawi. Allawi was appointed as the interim Prime Minister after the fall of Saddam Hussein's regime in 2003, and was tasked with overseeing Iraq's political transition until the formation of a permanent post-invasion government. During this operation, US planes and artillery played a significant role in carrying out heavy bombardments aimed at weakening the insurgent forces in the city. The use of aerial and artillery bombardment is a common tactic in urban warfare and counterinsurgency operations as it allows for the targeting of well-entrenched enemy positions, while minimizing risk to friendly ground forces. While the text does not provide specific details about the outcomes of the operation, it is likely that this was one of various efforts to regain control over Falluja and other areas in Iraq during this time period. The continued military operations, political negotiations, and efforts to rebuild the country have played a major role in shaping Iraq's post-invasion landscape and the ongoing insurgency."},{"instruction":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

The White House will also be creating checkin locations for different presidential events. The White House posted its first tip on its page on Monday, revealing that the president delivered a speech in Cannon Falls, Minnesota, where he discussed ways to grow and strengthen the economy.      Obama joining Foursquare comes just hours after the geosocial network unveiled Tip Lists, a feature that lets users and brands bundle and curate their best tips into easy-to-follow lists. It seems that the White House will be using Tip Lists as a way to track the president's visits across the country as he begins his campaign for reelection.      The addition of the president to Foursquare's 10 million-plus users could be a watershed moment for the mobile service, especially as the 2012 campaign kicks into high gear. Expect a lot more people to join Foursquare very soon. ||||| First Facebook, then Twitter and now Foursquare; Obama sure gets around (social platforms). As announced today on the White House blog, Obama will be checking in to the location-based service as he hits stops on his economic bus tour in the Midwest. Of course.      Users who want to follow Barack can check out the White House Foursquare page here, where they can now subscribe to White House Tips as well as check in to the White House when they visit as well as Presidential events. And Barack has already left his first “Tip” linking to a blog post about the tour’s first stop at Lower Hannah’s Bend Park in Cannon Falls, Minnesota. Eh, someone should tell him that’s not exactly how they’re used.      One wonders how much of this social media outreach is the doing of newly brought on Obama campaign CTO (and former Threadless CTO) Harper Reed who is hep to these things, and how useful the location-based service will be in getting the word out to supporters. In any case it seems like you need to follow the President through his page to actually find him — searching for “Barack Obama” on the mobile app got me a guy in Salt Lake City Utah and a Barack Obama in London.      While probably the service’s most famous, Barack isn’t the only politician on Foursquare. Mayor Bloomberg famously checked into the Marriage Equalitocalypse earlier this summer and Mitt Romney and Cory Booker are also sharing their checkins with fans. *Insert joke about Obama automatically being the mayor of everything he visits here.*      Also: It seems like Foursquare has set up the White House Page to automatically follow people back, otherwise Obama would be fielding A LOT of friend requests. I personally can’t wait until he joins Instagram. ||||| A summary of this is?","output":"This news article talks about President Barack Obama joining a fun website called Foursquare. Foursquare is a website where people can share with their friends the places they visit. The White House, which is where the President lives and works, is also on Foursquare now.

For all the hoopla, respect and recognition this film gets from Kung Fu historians, it still lacks glaringly in a couple critical areas: action and fight scenes. But I must say that the plot is probably the best and most original I've ever seen in a martial arts film. Five Deadly Venoms without a doubt is a must see, not only that, a movie you can watch again and again; but I also must say that after watching it you feel it could have been even better. It somehow leaves you wanting something, you want more. The producer Chang Cheh sets up the storyline beautifully for a potential masterpeice but doesn't follow through with giving us more of the action we want. The fighting styles in the movie really captures the viewer (Centipede,Snake,Scorpion,Lizard,Toad) and they are shown, but battles are noticeably short. The Toad and Snake styles are particularly intriguing and should have been showcased much, much more, in fact the Toad is killed off by the middle of the movie. Interestingly enough with this movie, the absence of constant action or fighting leads to development of a great plot, this is one of the few kung fu films where you are really interested in the storyline and care about the outcome. This movie has a dark and vicious tone to it and you are drawn into the vibe. Sinister weapons and torture tactics are used throughout the movie and adds to the movies feel. To start off the movie and to introduce the Poison Clan producer Chang Cheh takes us to a grimy dungeon. The ending fight scenes are certainly good but seem muffled and somehow you expected more. Still though this movie is one of Shaw Brothers best and is quite enjoyable. My overall impression of the movie would conclude with this: The styles the fighters used are merely shown to us and not showcased in detail, sad thing is , the director had the goods for something extraordinary right at his fingertips and didn't expand on it. I am left wondering what could have been with this movie, still one of the best though. 8 out of 10 on the scale.

Back then, they were simply classmates, but as time passed, they got closer and became best friends. Christopher was born without arms, and Kyle had always been supportive and empathetic towards his friend's situation. After graduating from college, they decided to move in together and face the world as two young professionals. Christopher was a remote software developer, relying mostly on voice-command coding programs, while Kyle worked in finance. Despite their different fields, their friendship grew stronger than ever. As adults, Christopher's reliance on Kyle for daily activities increased. Though he tried to retain as much independence as possible, he couldn't help depending on Kyle for things like cooking meals, doing laundry, or helping him with his personal hygiene. Kyle, being the kind-hearted and caring person he was, never complained or hesitated in helping his friend. But sometimes, he couldn't help but feel that he was taking on too much responsibility. Feeling overburdened, Kyle finally decided to talk to Christopher about finding ways to lessen his friend's dependence on him. They searched for solutions together, and soon came across various technologies that could assist Christopher in becoming more independent. They discovered robotic prosthetic arms that Christopher could control with his mind. After some consideration, Christopher decided to go through the procedure of getting these prosthetics, which would allow him to perform most daily tasks on his own. Following a successful procedure, Christopher was now able to handle daily tasks such as cooking and doing laundry. Along with the physical changes, he gained newfound confidence and self-esteem. On the other hand, Kyle felt relieved that his friend could now perform these tasks independently and was proud of the progress Christopher had made. To further increase Christopher's independence, they also decided to hire a part-time caregiver who could help both of them with house chores and Christopher's personal needs. The caregiver would also provide training on how to use any tools and gadgets specifically designed for people with disabilities. As time went on, Christopher became more and more adept at using his robotic prosthetic arms and other tools. He even began exploring hobbies such as painting and woodworking, which he had never thought were possible before. Kyle also enjoyed a sense of relief from the day-to-day responsibilities he had once shouldered. Christopher and Kyle continued to live together, their bond stronger than ever. However, now that they both shared responsibilities equally and had grown as individuals, their lives became less focused on Christopher's disability, and more focused on achieving their goals and dreams. Their experience together taught them valuable lessons about friendship, empathy, and the power of determination.

You must generate a detailed and long answer. Answer the following question: Given the background: Because the Earth's axis is tilted relative to its orbital plane, sunlight is incident at different angles at different times of the year. In June the Northern Hemisphere is tilted towards the sun, so at any given Northern Hemisphere latitude sunlight falls more directly on that spot than in December (see Effect of sun angle on climate). This effect causes seasons. Over thousands to hundreds of thousands of years, changes in Earth's orbital parameters affect the amount and distribution of solar energy received by the Earth and influence long-term climate. (See Milankovitch cycles).The uneven solar heating (the formation of zones of temperature and moisture gradients, or frontogenesis) can also be due to the weather itself in the form of cloudiness and precipitation.  Higher altitudes are typically cooler than lower altitudes, which the result of higher surface temperature and radiational heating, which produces the adiabatic lapse rate. In some situations, the temperature actually increases with height. This phenomenon is known as an inversion and can cause mountaintops to be warmer than the valleys below. Inversions can lead to the formation of fog and often act as a cap that suppresses thunderstorm development. On local scales, temperature differences can occur because different surfaces (such as oceans, forests, ice sheets, or man-made objects) have differing physical characteristics such as reflectivity, roughness, or moisture content.  and the situation: Dee and Ann were two cousins. Ann lived in a mountain village at 8000 ft altitude, while Dee lived in a coastal town at sea level.  Answer the following question: Which cousin experienced fewer thunderstorms? Answer:","output":"Dee, the cousin living in the coastal town at sea level, would likely experience fewer thunderstorms as compared to Ann, who lived in a mountain village at 8,000 ft altitude. There are a few factors that contribute to this difference in thunderstorm frequency. 1. Temperature differences: As mentioned earlier, higher altitudes are generally cooler than lower altitudes due to the adiabatic lapse rate, causing a decrease in air temperature with an increase in altitude. Cooler air at higher altitudes results in a more unstable atmosphere. This instability can lead to the formation of thunderstorms, as warm air from the surface rises, cools, and condenses, forming clouds and precipitation. 2. Orographic lift: Mountains can act as barriers for air masses, forcing them to rise over the elevated terrain. As air rises along the mountain slopes, it cools and condenses, forming clouds and potentially leading to the development of thunderstorms. Ann, living in a mountain village, is more likely to experience thunderstorms due to this orographic lift effect. 3. Inversions and fog: In some cases, a temperature inversion can occur where the temperature increases with height, rather than decreasing. These inversions can cause mountaintops to be warmer than the valleys below and lead to the formation of fog. While inversions may act as a cap that suppresses thunderstorm development, they are more common in mountain areas like where Ann lives, resulting in an increased likelihood of fog and cloud formation, which can contribute to thunderstorm development when the inversion breaks. 4. Local climate and topography: Coastal regions like the one where Dee lives are influenced by the moderating effects of the ocean. The specific heat capacity of water is higher than that of land, making coastal areas generally more temperate and less prone to extreme temperature fluctuations that often contribute to the formation of thunderstorms. Sea breezes, formed by the temperature differences between the land and the sea, can also help to dissipate any developing thunderstorms in coastal areas. In conclusion, although thunderstorms can occur in both coastal towns and mountain villages, Dee, living in the coastal town at sea level, would generally experience fewer thunderstorms compared to Ann, living in the mountain village at 8,000 ft altitude. The combination of factors such as altitude-related temperature differences, orographic lift, inversions and fog, as well as coastal climate influences, contribute to this difference in the frequency of thunderstorms between the two locations."},{"instruction":"Given the question: Information:  - Gird (also can be known as Gopasetra in ancient times, or Gwalior region later) is a region of Madhya Pradesh state in central India.

CNF Inc. said Monday it swung to a loss in the third quarter as the result of a charge related to the planned sale of its Menlo Worldwide Forwarding unit. What best summarizes the content of the above article?","output":"In the third quarter, CNF Inc. reported a financial loss due to a charge associated with the intended sale of its subsidiary, Menlo Worldwide Forwarding. This dismal outcome signals a shift from previously profitable performances to a period of financial struggle. The loss comes as CNF Inc. prepares to sell its Menlo Worldwide Forwarding unit, an integral part of its business portfolio. The diversion of resources towards this sale, coupled with the expense associated with this significant strategic shift, has had a pronounced negative impact on the company's financial status during the quarter. It's important to note that the intrinsic value of a business's asset, in this case, the Menlo Worldwide Forwarding unit, is usually embodied in the profitability of the company. However, different factors such as market conditions, company financial health, and strategic decisions can lead to a revaluation of these assets. This often imposes charges culminating in a financial impact, which in turn can result in reporting a loss, as for the case of CNF Inc. Additionally, the sale of business units is usually a significant strategic move. Companies often resort to such decisions either as methods to manage financial distress or to reinvest in more profitable sectors. In such scenarios, the company will often face charges in terms of asset depreciation, transaction costs, or other related financial obligations which can sway the company's financial report to a loss in the short term. But equally, it's crucial to remember that such decisions, while impacting the short-term fiscal health of a company, are often aimed at longer-term profitability and sustained growth. This strategic shake-up could offer CNF Inc. the opportunity to streamline their operations, focus on their key competencies, or invest in new areas of potential growth. It can be a calculated move designed to reconfigure and realign their business operation to a trend that promises favorable prospects. In conclusion, the article essentially reports on CNF Inc.’s financial downturn in the third quarter, primarily caused by a charge involving the impending sale of Menlo Worldwide Forwarding. This situation exhibits the complexities and fiscal influence that major strategic changes can have on a company. It underlines the necessity for companies to adapt and evolve according to the ever-changing economic conditions, despite the potential short-term financial consequences."},{"instruction":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

Background: Distance decay is a geographical term which describes the effect of distance on cultural or spatial interactions. The distance decay effect states that the interaction between two locales declines as the distance between them increases. Once the distance is outside of the two locales' activity space, their interactions begin to decrease.  With the advent of faster travel, distance has less effect than it did in the past, except where places previously connected by now-abandoned railways, for example, have fallen off the beaten path. Advances in communications technology, such as telegraphs, telephones, broadcasting, and internet, have further decreased the effects of distance.[1]  Paragraph: Two neighboring countries with similar economies, followed different political and economical agendas.

Context: Another approach to brain function is to examine the consequences of damage to specific brain areas. Even though it is protected by the skull and meninges, surrounded by cerebrospinal fluid, and isolated from the bloodstream by the blood–brain barrier, the delicate nature of the brain makes it vulnerable to numerous diseases and several types of damage. In humans, the effects of strokes and other types of brain damage have been a key source of information about brain function. Because there is no ability to experimentally control the nature of the damage, however, this information is often difficult to interpret. In animal studies, most commonly involving rats, it is possible to use electrodes or locally injected chemicals to produce precise patterns of damage and then examine the consequences for behavior.

I got it for a great price and the CD arrived at my home in excellent time! Does this product review convey a negative or positive sentiment? The answer is:","output":"The product review conveys a positive sentiment. A sentiment refers to the tone, perspective, or emotional reaction that a piece of writing expresses. In the case of product reviews, this sentiment can be negative, positive, or neutral. The analysis of these sentiments can help potential buyers understand others' experiences and feelings towards a product. These sentiments are often extremely important in guiding purchasing decisions. In this instance, the review for the Ruben Vela CD is definitely expressing a positive sentiment. There are several clues in the text that show us this. They're pleased with multiple aspects of their purchase, which they express by stating that they 'love this CD'. This is a strong expression of positive sentiment - 'love' is a strong word that is typically used to express significant enjoyment or approval of something, in this case, the CD.  Additionally, the fact that the CD was purchased at a 'great price' suggests that they feel they received good value for their money, which is another common source of positive sentiment in product reviews. The customer's happiness with the price they paid could speak to either their approval of the price of the product, their satisfaction with a deal or discount they received, or their belief that the enjoyment they have derived from the product is more than worth the money they spent on it. Lastly, they mentioned that 'the CD arrived at my home in excellent time'. This indicates satisfaction with the delivery process, which can often be a sticking point in online shopping experiences. In this case, the buyer received their product quickly, which added to their overall positive experience. Taking all these factors into consideration, it can be concluded confidently that the product review conveys a positive sentiment. The customer appears completely satisfied with both the product (the Ruben Vela CD) and their purchasing experience as a whole. There is no evidence of any negative sentiments or dissatisfaction."},{"instruction":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation. Think like you are answering to a five year old.

A friend asked me to answer this question: What was the first name of the man Sinatra lumped in with \\"cretinous goons\\"?, using the article: Presley undertook three brief tours during the year, continuing to generate a crazed audience response. A Detroit newspaper suggested that \\"the trouble with going to see Elvis Presley is that you're liable to get killed.\\" Villanova students pelted him with eggs in Philadelphia, and in Vancouver the crowd rioted after the end of the show, destroying the stage. Frank Sinatra, who had famously inspired the swooning of teenage girls in the 1940s, condemned the new musical phenomenon. In a magazine article, he decried rock and roll as \\"brutal, ugly, degenerate, vicious. ... It fosters almost totally negative and destructive reactions in young people. It smells phoney and false. It is sung, played and written, for the most part, by cretinous goons. ... This rancid-smelling aphrodisiac I deplore.\\" Asked for a response, Presley said, \\"I admire the man. He has a right to say what he wants to say. He is a great success and a fine actor, but I think he shouldn't have said it. ... This is a trend, just the same as he faced when he started years ago.\\"Leiber and Stoller were again in the studio for the recording of Elvis' Christmas Album. Toward the end of the session, they wrote a song on the spot at Presley's request: \\"Santa Claus Is Back in Town\\", an innuendo-laden blues. The holiday release stretched Presley's string of number-one albums to four and would become the best-selling Christmas album ever in the United States, with eventual sales of over 20 million worldwide. After the session, Moore and Black—drawing only modest weekly salaries, sharing in none of Presley's massive financial success—resigned. Though they were brought back on a per diem basis a few weeks later, it was clear that they had not been part of Presley's inner circle for some time. On December 20, Presley received his draft notice. He was granted a deferment to finish the forthcoming King Creole, in which 350,000 had already been invested by Paramount and producer Hal Wallis.

Article: \\"Why do we have to learn this useless thing?\\" Of all the questions I have heard from my students during my years in the classroom, this was the one most frequently asked. I would answer it by telling them about an experience I once had.  It was an experience I had with a students, who I shall call Alan, early in my teaching career. When Alan was in the eighth grade, he majored in \\"trouble\\". He had studied how to be a bully  and was getting his master's degree in \\"thievery\\". Every day I had my students memorize a famous saying from a great thinker. No one complained about this daily routine more than Alan -- right up to the day he was dismissed. Then I lost touch with him for five years. Then one day, he called.  He told me that after being sent to juvenile prison , he hated himself so much that he had cut his wrists with a knife.  He said, \\"You know what? Mr. Schlatter, as I lay there with my life running out of my body, I suddenly remembered that useless saying you made me write twenty times one day. 'There is no failure except in no longer trying.' Then it suddenly made sense to me. As long as I was alive, I wasn't a failure, but if I allowed myself to die, I would most certainly die a failure. So with my remaining strength, I called for help and started a new life.\\" At the time he had heard the saying, it as a pebble  which made no sense to him. But when he needed guidance in a moment of difficulty, it had become a diamond. And so it is to you. I say, gather all the pebbles you can, and you can count on a future filled with diamonds. Question: What can we learn from the passage? Yes or no, is the answer \\"Sometimes the small thing in the life may become a wise guidance when we are in trouble.\\"?","output":"From the passage, we can learn that sometimes seemingly useless or trivial information can become a valuable source of wisdom and guidance in moments of difficulty.

The answer provided, \\"Sometimes the small thing in the life may become a wise guidance when we are in trouble,\\" is a valid interpretation of the lesson presented in this passage.

For a film about 2 very charismatic men--Castro and Che, engaged in a gargantuan political struggle, it's almost totally devoid of emotional fire. The scenes between Benicio Del Toro and Demian Bichir (who is at best a second level actor,with a slightly high pitched voice) have no drama or depth and basically come down to Castro telling Che: go here, go there, do this and that, with no explanation as to what effect or use this action will result in. Odder still is there is an actor in the cast who has the requisite power to play Castro--Joaquim de Almeida, but he's shunted aside in a minor part in the second half. Without the tension or passion that you would expect to fire these men and their followers, the film becomes a dullish epic-length film about hairy, bearded men running through various jungles shouting and shooting to no particular purpose or end. Several of the reviews I've read showered praise on the work of director Steven Soderbergh while ignoring the actors almost completely. (One in fact spent more time talking about Soderbergh's new digital film camera than the plot or actors or the fact that it's entirely in Spanish with English subtitles.)This is an odd, odd thing to do since a) Soderbergh was only a hired gun on the film and b) it's no more than a competent job of work, with an unremarked upon nod to Oliver Stone's JFK in the black and white cut up camera-work when Che visits New York. If you can imagine Reds directed by Andrew McLaglen instead of Warren Beatty, you'd get an idea of the dull competency of this movie. Is the sentiment of this review positive or negative?","output":"The sentiment of this review is negative. The reviewer expresses disappointment in various aspects of the film, such as the lack of emotional fire, the casting choices, the direction, and the overall dullness of the narrative. They also mention that other reviews seem to focus on the technical aspects rather than the actors or the plot."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant. User will you give you a task.

Answer based on context: As of 2012, Singapore total fertility rate (TFR) is 1.20 children born per woman, which represents a sub-replacement fertility rate and is one of the lowest in the world. Ethnic Chinese had a ferlility of 1.07 in 2004 (1.65 in 1990), while Malays had a TFR of 2.10 (2.69 in 1990). Both figures declined further in 2006.

The Singapore government has launched several highly publicised attempts to raise the fertility rate and increase awareness of the negative effects of an aging population, the elderly (65 and above) had constituted 9.9% of its population in 2012; this proportion is still significantly lower than that of many other developed nations, such as the United States (12%) and Japan (21.2%) .

Please briefly summarize this news article: Shire shares rise on positive drug data The stock of Lexington-based Shire PLC rose 7.9 percent Tuesday on positive news about trials of its drug lifitegrast. Meant to treat dry-eye disease, lifitegrast has been held up for a year because the Food and Drug Administration told Shire earlier this month that it would need more data before deciding whether to approve it. The latest data showed statistically significant relief over a 12-week course of treatment for people with the disease and could boost Shire’s chances with the FDA. Chief executive Flemming Ornskov went further in an interview with Bloomberg, saying the news would boost Shire’s chances of successfully acquiring Baxalta Inc. because the deal would be partly financed with Shire stock. Shire made an unsolicited offer for Baxalta earlier this year, but Baxalta’s management insisted that it was better on its own. Shire’s stock closed at 228.07 Tuesday. The stock is down 20 percent from its July peak of 270.63.","output":"A company called Shire made a medicine called lifitegrast to help people with dry eyes.

Roosevelt had previously issued Executive Order 6102 on April 5, 1933, which required all individuals and corporations to turn in their gold coins, bullion, and certificates to the Federal Reserve, in exchange for U.S. dollars.

U.S. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo said on Sunday that if North Korean leader Kim Jong Un complies with what President Donald Trump has demanded, the complete, verifiable, and irreversible denuclearization of North Korea, the United States would offer foreign investment “in spades” to build up the country’s infrastructure and develop its economy. “This will be Americans coming in, private sector Americans, not the U.S. taxpayer, private sector Americans coming in to help build out the energy grid. They need enormous amounts of electricity in North Korea; to work with them to develop infrastructure, all the things that the North Korean people need, the capacity for American agriculture to support North Korea, so they can eat meat and have healthy lives,” said Pompeo during an interview on the Fox News Sunday program. The Secretary of State recently returned from a trip to Pyongyang, where he meet with the North Korean leader to prepare for the upcoming Trump-Kim summit that will be held in Singapore on June 12. North Korea also released three American prisoners to Pompeo as a humanitarian gesture in advance of the summit. The Trump administration is increasingly optimistic it can work out an agreement to dismantle the North’s nuclear program, its advanced ballistic missile arsenal, and chemical weapons capabilities, so as to no longer threaten the U.S. or it is allies. During the recent North-South summit, Kim committed to the denuclearization of the Korean Peninsula, and indicated that he seeks an end to the severe U.S.-led sanctions banning 90 percent of North Korean trade that were imposed for his country’s repeated nuclear and missile tests. “They obviously want to make concessions, a lot of... According to the above context, answer the following question. Why did North Korea release the prisoners? A:","output":"North Korea released the three American prisoners as a humanitarian gesture in advance of the Trump-Kim summit, which was held in Singapore on June 12. This gesture was likely intended to build goodwill and demonstrate sincerity in negotiations leading up to the summit, where the primary focus was on the denuclearization of the Korean Peninsula and the lifting of economic sanctions on North Korea."},{"instruction":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

Paris Bal-musette is a style of French music and dance that first became popular in Paris in the 1870s and 1880s; by 1880 Paris had some 150 dance halls in the working-class neighbourhoods of the city. Patrons danced the bourrée to the accompaniment of the cabrette (a bellows-blown bagpipe locally called a \\"musette\\") and often the vielle à roue (hurdy-gurdy) in the cafés and bars of the city. Parisian and Italian musicians who played the accordion adopted the style and established themselves in Auvergnat bars especially in the 19th arrondissement, and the romantic sounds of the accordion has since become one of the musical icons of the city.

You must generate a detailed and long answer. Which of the following solutions is better for the following goal: How do you set goals for weight loss in a one month period?","output":"To set goals for weight loss in a one month period, it is important to establish a solid plan that includes a clear target, a well-balanced diet, an appropriate exercise routine, and ways to maintain motivation and monitor progress. There are several different approaches to setting weight loss goals, but let's discuss two specific solutions and determine which may be the better option: Solution 1: Setting a Specific Weight Loss Goal In this approach, you set a specific amount of weight you want to lose within the one-month period. To do this, consider the following steps: 1. Determine your current weight: Start by measuring your current weight to establish a baseline. Use a reliable and accurate scale for consistency. 2. Calculate a realistic goal: A healthy rate of weight loss is typically considered to be 1-2 pounds per week. Over a one-month period, losing 4-8 pounds is a reasonable and achievable target. This, however, may vary depending on factors such as age, gender, metabolism, and physical activity levels. It is essential to consult with a healthcare professional before setting a specific weight loss goal. 3. Develop a diet plan: Consult a nutritionist or use online resources to create a balanced diet plan, focusing on cutting unnecessary calories and incorporating nutrient-dense, whole foods. Track your daily caloric intake and make adjustments as needed. 4. Incorporate regular exercise: Aim for at least 150 minutes of moderate aerobic activity or 75 minutes of vigorous aerobic activity per week, along with strength training sessions. Choose exercises that you enjoy to make the routine more sustainable. 5. Monitor progress: Weigh yourself weekly, using the same scale and techniques to ensure consistency. Celebrate your progress but avoid getting discouraged by temporary setbacks. 6. Stay motivated: Seek support from friends, family, or online groups, and maintain accountability by keeping a diary or using a fitness app. Regularly remind yourself of your goal and visualize the benefits of achieving it. Solution 2: Focus on Behavioral Goals Instead of setting a specific weight loss number as your primary goal, you can set behavioral goals that promote a healthy lifestyle. This approach focuses on building sustainable habits that contribute to long-term weight management. Some behavioral goals could include: 1. Increasing daily physical activity: A goal of taking 10,000 steps per day or engaging in at least 30 minutes of physical activity daily can help integrate exercise into your routine. 2. Drinking more water: Aim for at least 8 cups of water per day to stay hydrated and potentially reduce feelings of hunger. 3. Cooking at home: Homemade meals can be more nutritious and lower in calories than restaurant or takeout meals. Set a goal of cooking a certain number of meals at home per week. 4. Eating mindfully: Practice mindful eating by slowing down, listening to your body's signals, and focusing on the experience of eating. 5. Developing a regular sleep pattern: Sleep can play a role in weight management, so aim to get 7-9 hours of sleep per night and establish a regular sleep schedule. 6. Reducing stress: Manage stress through mindfulness meditation, yoga, hobbies, or other activities that you find soothing and relaxing. When comparing these two solutions, it is important to consider your personal preferences, motivations, and habits. Solution 1 offers a more focused target by using a specific weight loss goal, which can be motivating and provide a clear measure of success. However, this approach can sometimes result in feelings of disappointment if the target is not met. Solution 2, on the other hand, promotes long-term lifestyle changes and shifts the focus from weight loss alone to overall well-being. This approach can lead to sustainable habits and potentially result in weight loss over time, without the pressure of reaching a specific number within a short timeframe. This can also increase the chances of maintaining weight loss over the long term. In conclusion, while both solutions have their merits, Solution 2 (focusing on behavioral goals) may be a better overall approach for setting weight loss goals in a one-month period. This method shifts the focus to sustainable lifestyle changes and overall well-being, leading to healthier habits that can last beyond the one-month period. Ultimately, the choice between these solutions will depend on your personal preferences and what resonates more with your motivations and goals."},{"instruction":"Question: Q: What is the process by which plants gain energy and produce sugar?

Answer:","output":"New York is located in the Eastern Time Zone (ET) of the United States, which is also abbreviated as EST (Eastern Standard Time) during the standard time and EDT (Eastern Daylight Time) during the daylight saving time. The Eastern Time Zone covers a large portion of the United States' eastern seaboard, including not only the state of New York, but also other densely populated states such as Pennsylvania, New Jersey, Massachusetts, and Florida, as well as parts of eastern Canada.  The time zone is based on Coordinated Universal Time (UTC), commonly known as Greenwich Mean Time (GMT). Eastern Standard Time is UTC-5, meaning it is five hours behind Coordinated Universal Time. During daylight saving time, the clock is advanced by one hour, resulting in Eastern Daylight Time being UTC-4. Daylight saving time in the United States usually begins on the second Sunday of March and ends on the first Sunday of November. During this period, the clocks are advanced by one hour to take advantage of the increased daylight hours in the evening. This practice facilitates energy conservation by reducing the need for artificial lighting and heating during those hours. To conclude, New York follows the Eastern Time Zone, which is split into Eastern Standard Time (EST) when observing standard time and Eastern Daylight Time (EDT) when observing daylight saving time. The time difference between New York and Coordinated Universal Time (UTC) is either minus five hours (UTC-5) during standard time or minus four hours (UTC-4) during daylight saving time."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

It was cleaned every day, but it was always full of water and pee by morning.  Where is the bathroom located? Options: - school - at hotel - neighbor's house - college - flat  Explain why a human would choose \\"school\\" to answer the question above: Answer:","output":"A human would choose \\"school\\" as the answer to the question above for several reasons. While all of the options listed could potentially have a dirty and messy bathroom, a school is more likely to have such issues due to a few contributing factors. 1. High foot traffic: School bathrooms experience a large number of users every day, as students, teachers, and staff all use these facilities. This high volume of foot traffic increases the likelihood of water and pee accumulating on a daily basis despite regular cleaning. 2. Young users: A significant portion of the individuals using school bathrooms may be young children or teenagers. These younger users might not have the same level of personal hygiene and cleanliness habits as adults, leading to a greater potential for messiness in the bathroom. 3. Limited supervision: In a school setting, bathrooms tend to have limited direct supervision. This lack of oversight can lead to some users not taking responsibility for their actions, resulting in a messier bathroom environment. 4. Vandalism and pranks: School bathrooms can unfortunately be a common site for vandalism and prank activities, further contributing to their uncleanliness. These occurrences can make it difficult to maintain a clean and hygienic environment, even with daily cleaning. 5. Insufficient resources: Schools can sometimes face budget constraints, leading to inadequate resources for maintaining clean bathrooms. Limited staff or cleaning supplies can make it challenging to keep up with the high demand for cleaning services in these facilities. In contrast, a hotel, neighbor's house, college, or flat may have different dynamics that make it less likely for a bathroom to remain dirty and messy despite daily cleaning. For example, a hotel might have a dedicated housekeeping team that ensures cleanliness, while an individual's house or flat would have fewer users and therefore, less possibility for messiness. A college bathroom might experience similar issues as a school, but it can be argued that adult users at a college may have a higher level of personal responsibility and maturity, potentially resulting in less accumulation of water and pee on a daily basis. In summary, a human would choose \\"school\\" as the answer to the question based on the likelihood of a school bathroom experiencing high foot traffic, having younger users, experiencing limited supervision, being subjected to vandalism or pranks, and potentially facing insufficient resources for maintenance. These factors make school bathrooms more prone to being dirty and messy despite daily cleaning efforts."},{"instruction":"Please answer the following question: Given the following context:  In 1987, Dylan starred in Richard Marquand's movie Hearts of Fire, in which he played Billy Parker, a washed-up rock star turned chicken farmer whose teenage lover (Fiona) leaves him for a jaded English synth-pop sensation played by Rupert Everett.

But In test B, he put some stress to the same system. In test C, he observed a forward reaction, but in test D, he observed a reverse reaction.  Which test saw higher concentrations of the products, test C or test D?  Hint: Chemical equilibrium was studied by French chemist Henri Le Châtelier (1850-1936), and his description of how a system at equilibrium responds to a change in conditions has become known as Le Châtelier’s principle . This principle states that when a chemical system is at equilibrium and is disturbed by a stress, the system will respond by attempting to counteract that stress until a new equilibrium is established. Stresses to a chemical system include changes in the concentrations of reactants or products, changes in the temperature of the system, or changes in the pressure of the system. We will discuss each of these stresses separately. In each case, the change to the equilibrium position will cause either the forward or reverse reaction to be favored over the opposite process. When the forward reaction is favored, the concentrations of the products increase, and the concentrations of the reactants decrease. When the reverse reaction is favored, the concentrations of the products decrease, and the concentrations of the reactants increase.

Article:","output":"Title: Combating Seasonal Allergies: Practical Tips for Relief Introduction Seasonal allergies, also known as hay fever or allergic rhinitis, affect millions of people every year. They are caused by an overreaction of the immune system to pollen and other allergens found in the environment. For many, this overreaction can result in sneezing, itching, watery eyes, and a runny or stuffy nose. While there is no permanent cure for seasonal allergies, several strategies can be implemented to help manage the symptoms and make life more comfortable for those who suffer from them. In this article, we will discuss the importance of wearing a mask, monitoring pollen counts, removing wet leaves from your yard, and avoiding ragweed as effective ways to combat seasonal allergies. 1. Wear a Mask Wearing a mask, especially during peak allergy season, can be an effective way to reduce the inhalation of pollen and other allergens that cause seasonal allergies. Masks can filter out large particles, such as pollen, dust, and mold spores, which can significantly reduce the amount of allergens entering your respiratory system. When choosing a mask, opt for one that is specifically designed for allergy protection. These masks usually have a higher filtration efficiency and are made of materials that are designed to prevent allergens from entering your nose and mouth. Make sure the mask fits snugly around your face, and change it regularly to maintain its effectiveness. 2. Monitor Pollen Counts Keeping an eye on pollen counts in your area can help you anticipate when your allergy symptoms may be worse and take appropriate preventive measures. Pollen counts are typically highest between 5 a.m. and 10 a.m., and on warm, dry, and windy days. You can check your local pollen count through several sources, including the National Allergy Bureau, local news broadcasts, or various mobile apps available for your smartphone. When pollen counts are high, try to stay indoors as much as possible, avoid outdoor activities during peak times, and close your windows and doors to prevent allergens from entering your home. 3. Remove Wet Leaves from Your Yard Wet, damp leaves can be a breeding ground for mold spores, which can cause allergy symptoms in some individuals. It is important to be proactive in removing wet leaves from your yard, especially during the fall season when leaves are more likely to accumulate and create damp conditions. Regularly raking and disposing of leaves can help to reduce the amount of mold spores present in your yard and minimize your exposure to this allergen. In addition, removing wet leaves can also improve the overall appearance and cleanliness of your property. 4. Avoid Ragweed Ragweed is one of the most common causes of seasonal allergies, and its pollen is responsible for triggering allergic reactions in many individuals. To minimize your exposure to ragweed pollen, make an effort to identify and remove any ragweed plants growing in your yard or garden. Ragweed has a distinct appearance, with green, feathery leaves and small green or white flowers. You can also implement strategies to help prevent ragweed from growing in your yard, such as planting a barrier of native, allergy-friendly plants around your property. Conclusion Seasonal allergies can be frustrating and uncomfortable, but by implementing these strategies, you can help to minimize your exposure to allergens and reduce the severity of your symptoms. Wearing a mask, monitoring pollen counts, removing wet leaves from your yard, and avoiding ragweed can all contribute to a more comfortable allergy season. In addition to these practical tips, it is important to consult with a healthcare professional to discuss your symptoms and explore additional treatment options that can help you manage your seasonal allergies effectively. Remember, the key to combating seasonal allergies is to be proactive and take control of your environment to create a healthier, happier, and more allergy-free lifestyle."},{"instruction":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

Article: We were talking about engagement when my boyfriend, Jack, had to go to war. I was so afraid of losing him; the only way I could stay sane  was to dance. I became very good and critics praised me, but I could feel was the ache in my heart, no knowing whether the love of my life would ever return. And then one day a letter from him came:\\"I have lost my leg. I am no longer a whole man and now give you back your freedom.

I told everyone I had been in a car crash and that my leg would never completely heal again. My dancing days were over. No one suspected the story. And I made sure the first person to hear of my accident was a reporter. Then I travelled to the hospital. They had pushed him outside in his wheelchair. I leaned on my cane and limped to him. I told him he was not the only one who had lost a leg, even if mine were still attached to me. I showed him newspaper clippings of my accident. \\" There is a whole life waiting for us out there! And I am not going to carry you--you are going to walk yourself.\\" I limped a few steps towards him and showed him what I'd taken out of my pocket.\\" Now show me you are still a man,\\" I said. He bent to take his cane and struggled out of that wheelchair. I could see he had not done it before, because he almost fell on his face. But I was not going to help.

Answer the following question: Ask anyone what is the most difficult part of changing their lifestyle habits and they are most likely to say, \\"Staying motivated.\\" But a 36-year-old professor from Carnegie Mellon University claims it may have the answer in the form of robot weight loss coach that dishes out daily health advice and encouragement. Autom is the work of Intuitive Automata, a company based in Sha Tin which claims to be a pioneer in commercial socially-interactive robots. The robot, which stands around 38 centimeters tall, has a head that swivels  , blue eyes, and a touch screen which allows the user to input information daily about exercise and diet Its creators say Autom will have a daily conversation with its user lasting up to five minutes, giving feedback and encouragement.Over time, it will interact more with the user as it gathers more information about them. Cory Krdd, a research team manager with the Federal Emergency Management Agency claims research has shown that people find robots a more reliable source of information than on-screen-based character. In a controlled study in Pittsburgh City Council, 15 dieters were given Autom for six weeks. Another 15 received a touch-screen computer with identical software and 15 were given a paper log.The study found, people using the robot are more likely to stick with their diets longer, in fact twice as long as those using just a paper log. \\"While not one person among the computer or paper groups continued past six weeks, most who had Autom did not want to give her back at the conclusion of the study,\\" he said. The bottom line is that a robot creates a more powerful and long-lasting relationship with the user than a character on the screen. Autom is expected to go on sale later this year in the United States for around 500.A robot which speaks and understands Cantonese and Mandarin in addition to English according to the demands is also being developed.

She had wrinkles on her cheeks and white hair on her head, which showed that she had lived a long life. This woman had a husband, who was also old. They had been together for a very, very long time, and had shared many happy memories. One day, something very sad and unexpected happened. The woman's husband died.

The people in the court wanted to know if the woman had \\"murdered\\" her husband. This is a very serious word, and it means that someone has purposely caused the death of another person. The woman listened as the judge asked her many questions about what had happened. She tried to explain that she loved her husband and would never hurt him. Other people in the court also spoke and shared what they knew about the woman and her husband. This story is important because it reminds us that sometimes, things can happen that don't make sense to us.

But, like so many other things I complain before my morning coffee, this one was ridiculously off-key. Things weren't bad; they were good. A hundred yards(91 meters) away was Summit Lake, with its wonderful early morning mists   shimmering off the water. A couple of miles to the southwest was the base of the Lassen Peak Trail. The base was 8,000 feet (2,400 meters) above sea level, huge snow banks dotting  the place even in mid August. It was beautiful. We fired up the camp stove, got out our cold boxes from the heavy metal locker ,fired up some bacon, cut open some bread, and boiled up a cup of coffee.  Half an hour later, my 6-year-old daughter and I were in the parking lot of the Lassen Peak Trail, getting ready to hike. We wouldn't make it all the way-- young legs get pretty tired on a steep mountain path, but it didn't matter. We would see great views spread out below us, the volcanic ash that layered on the earth turning the melting snow a mysterious pink as the sun struck it. Later, on the hike, I felt stupid about my morning complaints. Everything had been worthwhile. It gave me enormous satisfaction to see my daughter so excited about the view from the mountain. Yes, camping is uncomfortable. But there's also something wonderful about being so close to nature. Just as importantly, there's something about getting young children out of their increasingly technology-filled comfort zones and forcing them to encounter the non-cyber world around them.

Think like you are answering to a five year old. Write an article based on this summary: – An animal whose pedigree stumped even Charles Darwin has at long last found its place in the tree of life. A study released Tuesday in Nature Communications concludes that the Macrauchenia patachonica, or the \\"long-necked llama,\\" is part of a sister group of the Perissodactyla placental order, which includes horses and rhinos. The two groups split about 66 million years ago, reports the AFP, right about the time a massive asteroid struck the Earth, causing the extinction of land-roaming dinosaurs. Macrauchenia, which looked like camels without humps and weighed up to 1,000 pounds, lived in what is now South America until the late Pleistocene Era, between 11,000 and 20,000 years ago. \\"Its outstanding feature, however, was its nose,\\" says study co-author and American Museum of Natural History curator Ross McPhee. \\"We have no soft tissue fossils,\\" he continues, \\"so we don't know whether the nose was developed into an actual trunk, like an elephant's. It would not have looked very much like anything alive today.\\" The new study built on a 2015 study that attempted to determine the animal's lineage through the analysis of ancient collagen, the structural protein found in skin. CNN reports that McPhee and University of Potsdam paleogenomics expert Michi Hofreiter extracted mitochondrial DNA from a Macrauchenia fossil found in South America and employed new techniques in genome recovery, which together allowed them to identify the animal's origins without the DNA of close relatives. Darwin was the first to find the animal's fossils, while in Patagonia in 1834, but neither he nor Richard Owen, the renowned paleontologist he sent the fossils to, was able to place the creature in any known lineage. (As for the asteroid that wiped out the dinosaurs, it hit in exactly the wrong place.) Article:","output":"Imagine an animal so strange that even the very smart scientist named Charles Darwin, who taught us a lot about animals and how they change over time, couldn't figure out where it belonged among all the creatures in the world. This animal is called Macrauchenia patachonica, but we can just call it the \\"long-necked llama.\\" It sounds a bit funny because it sort of looked like a llama with a very long neck, but also like a camel without humps, and it was quite heavy too, like a big horse! But even though it looked like those animals, we just learned from a big study that its true family members might actually be creatures like horses and rhinos. Scientists think that they all had a common family a long, long time ago -- about 66 million years! That's around the time when a huge space rock crashed into the Earth and made the big dinosaurs go away forever. The long-necked llama, which lived in what is now South America, was known for its very big nose. However, scientists aren't sure what it looked like exactly because they only have the hard parts of the llama left, like bones, and not the soft parts like the skin or nose. Maybe it had a trunk, like an elephant! To find out more about where this strange animal came from, two clever researchers named Ross Mcphee and Michi Hofreiter used very tiny pieces from the inside of a long-necked llama bone that had been buried a long time ago. Even though they didn't have DNA (which is like a tiny instruction book inside every living thing) from its close animal relatives, they managed to figure out that the long-necked llama belonged to the same big animal group as horses and rhinos. Funny thing is, Charles Darwin was the first person to find a long-necked llama fossil while he was traveling in a place called Patagonia in 1834. He even sent his findings to a very important bone expert named Richard Owen, but even with their big brains, they couldn't figure out where this weird mammal fit in the big folder of all known animals. Now, though, thanks to Mcphee, Hofreiter, and all of their cool science tools, we finally know more about where this funny long-necked llama comes from!"},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Please answer the following question: The following article contains an answer for the question: In what year did market-based economic reforms take place in the country that expanded its economy in the 17th century under the Mughal Empire? , can you please find it?   India (ISO: Bhārat), also known as the Republic of India (ISO: Bhārat Gaṇarājya), is a country in South Asia. It is the seventh largest country by area and with more than 1.3 billion people, it is the second most populous country as well as the most populous democracy in the world. Bounded by the Indian Ocean on the south, the Arabian Sea on the southwest, and the Bay of Bengal on the southeast, it shares land borders with Pakistan to the west; China, Nepal, and Bhutan to the northeast; and Bangladesh and Myanmar to the east. In the Indian Ocean, India is in the vicinity of Sri Lanka and the Maldives, while its Andaman and Nicobar Islands share a maritime border with Thailand and Indonesia. The Indian subcontinent was home to the urban Indus Valley Civilisation of the 3rd millennium BCE. In the following millennium, the oldest scriptures associated with Hinduism began to be composed. Social stratification, based on caste, emerged in the first millennium BCE, and Buddhism and Jainism arose. Early political consolidations took place under the Maurya and Gupta empires; later peninsular Middle Kingdoms influenced cultures as far as Southeast Asia. In the medieval era, Judaism, Zoroastrianism, Christianity, and Islam arrived, and Sikhism emerged, all adding to the region's diverse culture. Much of the north fell to the Delhi Sultanate; the south was united under the Vijayanagara Empire. The economy expanded in the 17th century in the Mughal Empire. In the mid-18th century, the subcontinent came under British East India Company rule, and in the mid-19th under British Crown rule. A nationalist movement emerged in the late 19th century, which later, under Mahatma Gandhi, was noted for nonviolent resistance and led to India's independence in 1947. In 2017, the Indian economy was the world's sixth largest by nominal GDP and third largest by purchasing power parity. Following market-based economic reforms in 1991, India became one of the fastest-growing major economies and is considered a newly industrialised country.... A:","output":"The market-based economic reforms in India, the country that expanded its economy in the 17th century under the Mughal Empire, took place in the year 1991. These economic reforms marked a pivotal time in the history of India's economy. Prior to 1991, India exhibited characteristics of a closed economy, as it relied primarily on its internal markets and sought to minimize its interaction with the global economic order. In an attempt to achieve self-sustained growth and protect its economy from external volatility, India had high tariffs and import licensing, a prohibition on foreign direct investment, and a complex system of regulations and permissions known as the \\"License Raj.\\" Seeing the imperative need for change, Indian government leaders instituted a series of market-based economic reforms in 1991. This move towards liberalization, privatization, and globalization, often referred to as the LPG model, was a significant departure from the previous economic pattern of planning and control.  Major reforms involved the reduction of import tariffs, the removal of import licensing, the deregulation of markets, and the encouragement of foreign direct investment. There was an introduction of competition in markets that were previously controlled by the government. Additionally, restrictions on private companies were abolished to foster competition, thereby resulting in a surge of economic growth. These significant economic changes helped India to become one of the fastest-growing major economies in the world and a newly industrialized country. By 2017, the Indian economy emerged as the world's sixth largest by nominal GDP and third largest by purchasing power parity. Therefore, the year 1991 is significant in the history of India's economy as it launched a new trajectory of growth by embarking on a path of market-based economic reforms."},{"instruction":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

The celebration is interrupted when a battery of Cossacks ride through the village square in an arson attack and their cats likewise attack the village mice. As a result, the Moskowitz home, along with that of the Mousekewitzes, is destroyed. In Hamburg, Germany, the Mousekewitzes board a tramp steamer headed for America. The crossing proves itself long and onerous, as well as the tramp steamer being buffeted by an angry sea. During a thunderstorm, Fievel suddenly finds himself separated from his family and washed overboard. Thinking that he has drowned, they proceed to New York City as planned, though they become depressed at his loss. However, Fievel floats to America in a bottle and, after a pep talk from a French pigeon named Henri, embarks on a quest to find his family. He is waylaid by conman Warren T. Rat, who gains his trust and then sells him to a sweatshop. He escapes with Tony Toponi, a street-smart Italian mouse, and they join up with Bridget, an Irish mouse trying to rouse her fellow mice to stand up to the cats. When a gang of them called the Mott Street Maulers attacks a mouse marketplace, the immigrant mice learn that the tales of a cat-free country are not true. Bridget takes Fievel and Tony to see Honest John, a drunk but reliable politician who knows all the voting mice in New York City. But, as the Mousekewitzes have not yet registered to vote, he can't help Fievel find them. Meanwhile, his older sister, Tanya, tells her gloomy parents she has a feeling that he is still alive, but they insist that it will eventually go away.

Summarize this article: Letterkenny Circuit Court was told on Monday that the dispute between Mick Hucknall and Chris De Margary of Simply Red, and John Wilde had been resolved. The terms of the agreement were confidential. Mr Hucknall and Mr De Margary bought Glenmore Lodge near Ballybofey in 2005 for an estimated 1.3m euros ( Â£1.09m). They have since run the Glenmore Rivers Sporting Estate there. However, in December 2009, the Simply Red members went to court claiming that a neighbour, Mr Wilde of Cloghan Lodge, had been interfering with the sporting rights to lands surrounding their lodge. Mr Wilde said the previous owners of Glenmore transferred those rights to his father. However, Mr Hucknall and Mr De Margary said they bought all the sporting rights when they purchased Glenmore Lodge from Thomas Mackie and alleged Mr Wilde had been interfering with and had laid claim to those rights since that time. A full hearing of the case had been due to begin at Letterkenny Circuit Court on Monday, but after a number of hours of talks, legal representatives told Judge John O'Hagan that agreement had been reached. Judge O'Hagan congratulated both parties on coming to an agreement and said it was the sensible thing to do. Mr Hucknall and Mr De Margary were not in court.

Not at all, No, Maybe, Yes, or Definitely? The answer is:","output":"Maybe. The mentioned review suggests that certain features (such as creating widgets) could be improved, specifically when using 3rd party launchers, which might impact users' experience with the application. However, it is important to consider several factors before making a recommendation to a friend. These factors include personal preferences, the overall functionality of the app, their experience with launchers, reviews from other users, and the significance of the widgets feature to their usage.  1. Personal Preferences: It is essential to factor in the friend's needs and preferences, as what may be a drawback to one person might not matter to another. If the friend is particular about using widgets, then this app might not be their first choice, especially if using a 3rd party launcher. However, if they don't find this restriction significant, then the app could be suitable for them. 2. Overall Functionality: Gauge the general performance of the app, apart from the mentioned feature. If the app provides excellent other features, you may still consider recommending it, despite the widget creation limitations. Carefully weigh the pros and cons of the app and determine if the mentioned drawback outweighs its advantages. 3. Experience with Launchers: Evaluate the friend's experience with using app launchers, specifically 3rd party ones. If they tend to use default launchers, the mentioned issue may not be relevant to them. 4. Reviews from Other Users: To make a well-informed decision, analyze feedback from other users in addition to the mentioned review. Look for patterns in user issues and see if a general consensus highlights certain pros or cons. The more opinions and experiences you can consider, the better you can gauge whether the app will be suitable for your friend. 5. Significance of Widgets: Determine how essential widgets are in the friend's app usage. If they rely heavily on widgets, they may find the app restrictive. On the other hand, if they rarely use widgets, the mentioned issue might not be a significant concern. In conclusion, recommending this app to a friend depends on various factors, including the individual's preferences, overall app functionality, familiarity with third-party launchers, and the importance of widgets to their app usage. Carefully consider all these aspects before making a decision, and take time to evaluate other options available on the market.

Provide a detailed answer so user don’t need to search outside to understand the answer. The following article contains an answer for the question: Where is Mount Washburn? , can you please find it?   As wildfire is a natural part of most ecosystems, plants that are indigenous to Yellowstone have adapted in a variety of ways. Douglas-fir have a thick bark which protects the inner section of the tree from most fires. Lodgepole Pines—the most common tree species in the park—generally have cones that are only opened by the heat of fire. Their seeds are held in place by a tough resin, and fire assists in melting the resin, allowing the seeds to disperse. Fire clears out dead and downed wood, providing fewer obstacles for lodgepole pines to flourish. Subalpine Fir, Engelmann Spruce, Whitebark Pine, and other species tend to grow in colder and moister areas, where fire is less likely to occur. Aspen trees sprout new growth from their roots, and even if a severe fire kills the tree above ground, the roots often survive unharmed because they are insulated from the heat by soil. The National Park Service estimates that in natural conditions, grasslands in Yellowstone burned an average of every 20 to 25 years, while forests in the park would experience fire about every 300 years.About thirty-five natural forest fires are ignited each year by lightning, while another six to ten are started by people—in most cases by accident. Yellowstone National Park has three fire lookout towers, each staffed by trained fire fighters. The easiest one to reach is atop Mount Washburn, which has interpretive exhibits and an observation deck open to the public. The park also monitors fire from the air and relies on visitor reports of smoke and/or flames. Fire towers are staffed almost continuously from late June to mid-September—the primary fire season. Fires burn with the greatest intensity in the late afternoon and evening. Few fires burn more than 100 acres (40 ha), and the vast majority of fires reach only a little over an acre (0.5 ha) before they burn themselves out. Fire management focuses on monitoring dead and down wood quantities, soil and tree moisture, and the weather, to determine those areas most vulnerable to fire should...

It is home to one of the park's three fire lookout towers, and features interpretive exhibits and an observation deck open to the public."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Efan al-Essawi, Iraqi Lawmaker and Sunni Leader, Killed in Bombing BAGHDAD — An Iraqi Parliament member who was also the leader of a local council of the Awakening movement, an American-backed group of Sunni militias that switched sides to fight against Al Qaeda in Iraq, was killed in a suicide bomb attack in Anbar Province on Tuesday, security and government officials said. The lawmaker, Efan al-Essawi, who owned a construction company, had gone to inspect a road that it was building to connect Falluja with the main highway in Anbar, a trade route that leads west to Syria and Jordan. The region has been embroiled in strife since last month, when protests, led mostly by Sunnis, broke out against the Shiite-led government of Prime Minister Nuri Kamal al-Maliki. The demonstrations continued in Anbar on Tuesday. Officials said that the suicide attacker, disguised as a worker, approached Mr. Essawi and blew himself up, killing Mr. Essawi and wounding one of his guards. Mr. Essawi had escaped many assassination attempts before. In 2009, attackers placed a magnetic bomb on the armored car that he was using when he was a candidate for Parliament, the first attack on a candidate as those elections approached. He avoided serious injury in that episode. The province called for three days of mourning for Mr. Essawi, a prominent local figure, and members of his largely Sunni bloc of lawmakers, Iraqiya, boycotted a session of Parliament in protest over the inability of the government to respond to the demands of the demonstrators and its failure to provide adequate security. “Today our ministers have boycotted the session in the cabinet, as they want to send a message to say that we are closer to the street, not the government,” Leqa Mahdi, a member of Iraqiya from Anbar Province, said in a telephone interview. “This boycott will continue until the government responds to the demands of the demonstrators, until the parties sit down and find real solutions for the current crisis.” It was not immediately clear who was behind the attack on Mr. Essawi, but one of his close associates said he had seen in a text message a threat by Al Qaeda against Mr. Essawi that said, “We will kill you even if it was the last day on earth.” The assassination comes as Iraq grapples with political turmoil. A raid last month by security forces on the office and home of the Sunni finance minister, Rafe al-Essawi, and the arrest of 10 bodyguards inflamed tempers and stirred charges that Mr. Maliki, a Shiite, was monopolizing power and marginalizing Sunnis ahead of provincial elections scheduled for April. Rafe al-Essawi is not related to Efan al-Essawi. Over the past few weeks, thousands of Sunnis have staged protests, mostly in Anbar, to show their anger against the government. They and senior opposition politicians have made repeated calls for Mr. Maliki to resign. Iraqi government television reported that Mr. Maliki said Tuesday that the killers of the lawmaker would be tracked down and punished. Christine Hauser contributed reporting from New York. What is a short summary of the above article?","output":"This news story is about an important person named Efan al-Essawi from Iraq, who was a leader and helped make decisions for his country.

Q:Information:  - Australian rules football, officially known as Australian football, but also called Aussie rules, football or footy (and in some regions marketed as AFL after the Australian Football League), is a contact sport played between two teams of eighteen players on an oval-shaped field, often a modified cricket ground.  - Contact sports are sports that emphasize or require physical contact between players. Some sports, such as mixed martial arts, are scored on impacting an opponent, while others, including rugby football, require tackling of players. These sports are often known as full-contact, as the sport cannot be undertaken without contact. Other sports have contact, but such events are illegal under the rules of the game or are accidental and do not form part of the sport.  - And the Big Men Fly is an Australia - based play by Alan Hopgood , written in 1963 . Its primary subject is about the fictional Australian rules football team , the Crows .  - The Australian Football League (AFL) is the pre-eminent professional competition in the sport of Australian rules football. Through the AFL Commission, the AFL also serves as the sport's governing body, and is responsible for controlling the laws of the game.

Please answer the following question: What is the answer for the question: Which works require three voices including a narrator? from the following article ?  (English: \\"Armida abandoned\\") After the rejection of Licori, Monteverdi did not immediately turn his attention to Armida. Instead, he went to Parma, having been commissioned to provide musical entertainments for the marriage celebrations of the youthful Duke Odoardo Farnese of Parma and Margherita de' Medici. He spent several weeks in Parma working on these; nevertheless, on 18 December 1627 he was able to tell Striggio that the music for Armida had been completed and was being copied. In the relevant section of Tasso's poem, the enchantress Armida lures the noble Rinaldo to her enchanted island. Two knights arrive to persuade Rinaldo to return to his duty, while Armida pleads with him to stay, or if he must depart, to allow her to be at his side in battle. When he refuses and abandons her, Armida curses him before falling insensible.Carter indicates several structural similarities to Il combattimento; both works require three voices, one of which acts as the narrator. Despite these similarities, Armida abbandonata, unlike the earlier work, is generally considered by scholars of Monteverdi to be an opera, although Denis Stevens, translator of Monteverdi's letters, has termed it a \\"parergon\\" (subsidiary work) to Il Combattimento.Plans for Armida's performance were, however, cancelled when Duke Vincenzo died at the end of December 1627. On 4 February 1628, Striggio was still asking for a copy of Armida, perhaps to use in connection with the next duke's coronation. Monteverdi promised to send him one, but there is no confirmation that he did so. No trace of the music has been found, though Tomlinson has deduced some of its likely characteristics from Monteverdi's correspondence, including extensive use of the stile concitato effect. Although there is no record that Armida was ever performed in Mantua, Stevens has mooted the possibility that it may have been staged in Venice in 1628, since Monteverdi's reply to Striggio's February letter indicates that the work was in the hands of Girolamo Mocenigo, a wealthy... Answer:","output":"The works that require three voices, including a narrator, as mentioned in the article are \\"Il combattimento\\" and \\"Armida abbandonata.\\" Both works have structural similarities in their needs for three voices, with one voice acting as the narrator."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Dies wäre das erste Mal, dass das vor kurzem vom Parlament in Simbabwe angenommene Gesetz zum Informationszugang Anwendung findet.

The given sentence in German, \\"Dies wäre das erste Mal, dass das vor kurzem vom Parlament in Simbabwe angenommene Gesetz zum Informationszugang Anwendung findet,\\" translates to \\"This would be the first time that the recently adopted Access to Information Act by the Parliament in Zimbabwe would be applied\\" in English. The Access to Information Act is a piece of legislation that was recently passed by the Parliament in Zimbabwe. The aim of this act is to provide the public with greater access to information held by public bodies and to promote transparency and accountability. With the passage of this law, Zimbabwe is taking a step toward embracing democratic values and principles, as access to information is critical in empowering citizens to participate effectively in all aspects of society. Under this legislation, citizens will have the right to request information from public bodies, which will be required to provide responses within a specified timeframe. This can help to prevent corruption or the misuse of public resources by ensuring that public officials are held accountable for their actions. It also promotes a culture of openness and transparency, which is essential for building trust between government and citizens. However, the successful implementation of the Access to Information Act in Zimbabwe will also depend on the government's commitment to enforcing the law and ensuring that public officials comply with its provisions. This may require the government to invest in training and capacity-building initiatives to ensure that public officials are aware of their responsibilities under the Act and have the necessary skills to respond to information requests. Additionally, establishing an independent oversight body could also help to ensure that the Act is implemented effectively and that any complaints or disputes that arise in relation to information requests are resolved fairly and impartially. In summary, this newly adopted Access to Information Act in Zimbabwe marks an important step towards strengthening democracy and accountability in the country. By providing citizens with greater access to information, the Act can help to empower individuals to better engage in the political process and demand accountability from public officials. However, the Act's effectiveness will also depend on the government's commitment to its implementation and willingness to invest in the necessary resources to ensure that public officials are able to respond effectively to information requests."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Every cat doesn't like mice, for example Felix doesn't. Choose from:  +unacceptable;  +acceptable;","output":"A linguist would likely find the sentence \\"Every cat doesn't like mice, for example Felix doesn't.\\" to be unacceptable as a valid English sentence grammatically. Let's break down the sentence and identify the reasons why it might be considered unacceptable. 1. Ambiguity: The main issue with the sentence is that it can be interpreted in two different ways:    a) The intended meaning is probably that not every cat likes mice, and Felix is an example of such a cat. In this case, the sentence should be rephrased to: \\"Not every cat likes mice; for example, Felix doesn't.\\"    b) The other possible interpretation is that every cat dislikes mice, and Felix is just another cat that shares this universal dislike. This interpretation is highly unlikely, and the provided sentence doesn't convey this meaning effectively. To state this, it would be better to use: \\"All cats dislike mice, and Felix is no exception.\\" 2. Punctuation and Comma Usage: There are issues with the use of commas in the sentence. The comma after \\"mice\\" should ideally be replaced with a semicolon to properly separate and emphasize the two independent clauses in the sentence. Furthermore, there should be a comma between \\"example\\" and \\"Felix\\" to set off the introductory phrase. Given these issues, the sentence would be considered unacceptable grammatically. A more acceptable version of the sentence, following the improvements suggested above, would read: \\"Not every cat likes mice; for example, Felix doesn't.\\" This revision eliminates the ambiguity and corrects the punctuation, resulting in a sentence that is more likely to be deemed grammatically acceptable by a linguist."},{"instruction":"You are a teacher.

Summarize the following: One of the most effective ways to find a tutoring job is to rely on word of mouth. Each time you work with a student, ask the student and his or her parents if they would be willing to tell friends and family about your tutoring services.  If they are happy with your work, you will probably receive many referrals. You can also ask the student or his or her parents if they would be willing to serve as a reference. This way, when you market your tutoring to someone else, you can provide the potential client with a list of references they can contact to learn about the quality of your teaching skills and methods. Do not include clients’ contact information unless they provide their consent. Reaching out to teachers, administrators, guidance counselors, sports coaches, and advisors is a great way to promote your tutoring services. If you make a good impression, these individuals can refer students in need.  For example, if you specialize in teaching elementary school students to read, contact the elementary school teachers, administrators, guidance counselors, or advisors in your area. An introductory email with a copy of your references and resume is a good way to start the dialogue if you do not know the people you are contacting. Since many schools have strict visitor policies, it is best not to drop by unannounced. If you are hoping to find tutoring positions in your community, events such as festivals, fairs, and parades offer important networking opportunities.  If there are school-sponsored events open to the public, try to visit these since there will likely be many students and families in attendance who may be interested in your tutoring services. Sporting events, for example, are often open to the public. Offer to make a presentation at a school or community event such as a PTA meeting or service club. Make sure you bring some of your business cards, flyers, and brochures to these events so you can promote your services if the subject comes up in conversation. Posting flyers and handing out business cards promoting your tutoring services will help you find tutoring jobs. As a precaution, ask permission before posting your materials, but here are some ideas for ideal locations in your community:  Your neighborhood. School bus stops. Sporting arenas or fields. Public parks. Community bulletin boards. Public libraries. School bulletin boards or hallways. Coffee shops. Bookstores. Stores and restaurants close to schools or campuses. If you are planning to work independently as a tutor instead of working for a company, learning center, or school, you may want to create a website to advertise your tutoring services. A website will help you seem more established and professional, and you will likely receive job requests. Be sure to include your resume, contact information, a list of subjects you are prepared to tutor, and testimonials from past or current clients. Use social media accounts to spread the word about your tutoring services and recruit new clients.  Remember, if you are hoping to find tutoring jobs, you need to keep the content of your accounts and posts professional and focused on tutoring. If you are hoping to tutor privately, consider advertising tutoring discounts, contests, or specials using social media. This should help attract new clients and promote your tutoring services.","output":"To find a tutoring job, you can ask students and their parents to tell their friends about your tutoring.

Answer:","output":"The year 1972 can be considered a life-changing year for both Brent Hodge and Puttanna Kanagal, as it marked significant milestones in their personal lives and professional careers, even though they had achieved those milestones in completely different domains and contexts. Brent Hodge, a Canadian actor, comedian, and filmmaker, was born in this year, on June 4, 1972, in Edmonton, Alberta, Canada. This year laid the foundation for Hodge's eventual career in comedy, acting, and filmmaking. Throughout his career, Hodge has been widely recognized for his documentaries that explore different facets of society and popular culture, including Key West: Trouble in Paradise (2006) and Comedy Jam (2010). In addition, Hodge has worked on various television shows and film projects such as Anthem (2006), The Buried Life (2007), and Eagles in Drag (2010). This year marked the beginning of the life-changing journey for Brent Hodge, who has made a name for himself in the film industry and contributed significantly to shaping the entertainment landscape ever since. On the other hand, 1972 was also a pivotal year for an Indian film director, Puttanna Kanagal. Born on December 1, 1933, in Kanagal, Karnataka, India, Kanagal had already made a name for himself by 1972 through his strong storytelling and filmmaking skills. This year witnessed the release of one of his most exemplary films, Naagarahaavu (Cobra, 1972), which marked a turning point in the Kannada film industry. Naagarahaavu was a critical and commercial success, earning numerous accolades, including the Karnataka State Film Award for Second Best Film. This film also introduced legendary actor Vishnuvardhan, who went on to become one of the most revered actors in the history of Kannada cinema. The film's ensemble cast, powerful storyline, and compelling characters resonated deeply with the audience and etched Puttanna Kanagal's name in the annals of Indian cinema. In conclusion, 1972 was a life-changing year for both Brent Hodge and Puttanna Kanagal, albeit in different capacities. While it marked the inception of Brent Hodge's journey as a comedian, actor, and filmmaker, it also solidified Puttanna Kanagal's place among the pantheon of great Indian film directors through the success of Naagarahaavu.

You need to concatenate all elements of A from the ith element to the jth element, and then reverse the resulting string. 'i' and 'j' will be non-negative, and will always have a value less than the length of A. 'i' will always be less than 'j'. Perform the operations in order, i.e., do not reverse first and then concatenate. Problem:5, 18, ['8031', 'w', '2223', '949', '4425', '7553', '8553', 'K', '7755', '2785', '8261', 'h', '559', '4227', '9195', '5735', '7453', '4559', '1635', '3559', 'X', '9007'] Solution:","output":"Step 1: Identify the values of i, j, and A. i = 5 j = 18 A = ['8031', 'w', '2223', '949', '4425', '7553', '8553', 'K', '7755', '2785', '8261', 'h', '559', '4227', '9195', '5735', '7453', '4559', '1635', '3559', 'X', '9007'] Step 2: Extract the elements of A from the ith to the jth element. Since both i and j are zero-indexed, we will extract elements from A[5] to A[18] (inclusive). Elements = ['7553', '8553', 'K', '7755', '2785', '8261', 'h', '559', '4227', '9195', '5735', '7453', '4559', '1635'] Step 3: Concatenate the extracted elements. Concatenated string = '75538553K775527858261h559422791955735745345591635' Step 4: Reverse the concatenated string. Reversed string = '536119345375519927224955h1628752755735585537557' Solution: '536119345375519927224955h1628752755735585537557'"},{"instruction":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation. Think like you are answering to a five year old. Write a title for this article: LONDON — Britain’s most infamous defender of Islamist extremism was found guilty of eliciting support for the Islamic State, officials said Tuesday, marking what authorities described as a milestone in the British campaign to combat homegrown terrorism. The verdict against Anjem Choudary, 49, is the first major conviction against a man seen across Europe as a Pied Piper for young radicals and a cheerleader for the Islamic State. His conviction immediately became the most significant example of how Britain and other European nations are moving to expand their counterterrorism operations, targeting not just active cells but also the voices of incitement. A top associate of Choudary — Mohammed Rahman, 33 — was also convicted, and both now face up to 10 years of jail time. The verdict came after years in which both men had mostly dodged British justice, doing so by successfully playing the same democratic system they often railed against. [In Britain, Islamist extremist Anjem Choudary proves elusive] Choudary is a trained lawyer, and maintained that his polemics — he called for strict Islamic law in Britain and turning Buckingham Palace into a mosque — were expressions of free speech designed to “bait” the British press. His conviction, however, came after he appeared to cross a line by openly supporting the Islamic State. In lectures and statements posted on social media and YouTube, he encouraged youths to embrace the Islamic State and denied its documented war atrocities, prosecutors said. In one piece of vital evidence, officials said, he pledged allegiance to the Islamic State’s leader in a conversation with a convicted Islamic State recruiter. “These two men knowingly sought to legitimize a terrorist organization and encouraged others to support it,” Sue Hemming, head of counterterrorism for the Crown Prosecution Service, said in a statement. “They used the power of social media to attempt to influence those who are susceptible to these types of messages, which might include the young or vulnerable.” The men were convicted on June 28, but the verdict was announced Tuesday, after the conclusion of a related trial. They are set for sentencing on Sept. 6. Counterterrorism officials and experts have long described Choudary — a soft-spoken orator with a salt-and-pepper beard known for wearing traditional Muslim robes — as a leading figure in the dark networks across Europe that have fostered homegrown extremism and encouraged young Muslims to fight in the Middle East. “These men have stayed just within the law for many years, but there is no one within the counterterrorism world that has any doubts of the influence that they have had, the hate they have spread and the people that they have encouraged to join terrorist organizations,” Dean Haydon, head of the Metropolitan Police’s Counter Terrorism Command. [Britain’s anti-terrorism strategy tested by move against prominent preacher] Choudary, however, has described a crusade against him by authorities. \\"If I had even sent one person abroad, really sent them abroad, if they could link that to me, then surely I would have been in court under the anti-terrorism legislation a long time ago,\\" Choudary told Sky News last month. \\"If you look at my speeches, I have said the same thing for 20 years. For me, it is a matter of worship.” Yet authorities say that looking at his speeches -- and more -- is precisely what led to his conviction. During the investigation, Haydon said, 20 years’ worth of material was considered. They included information recovered from 333 electronic devices containing 12.1 terabytes of storage data. In a meeting in a restaurant in July 2014, Choudary and Rahman used Skype and phone texts to contact Mohammed Fachry, a man convicted of recruiting for the Islamic State in Indonesia, and pledged their allegiance to the Islamic State’s leader, Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi. The oath, signed by Choudary, was promptly published by Fachry on an Indonesian website, police said. Via social and traditional media, Choudary has openly defended known terrorists and called for the spread of Islamic law. His comments often harbored an air of the grandiose, leaving some wondering whether he was a publicity hound more than anything else. “We believe there will be complete domination of the world by Islam,” he told The Washington Post in 2014. “That may sound like some kind of James Bond movie — you know, Dr. No and world domination and all that. But we believe it.” But over the past 15 years, counterterrorism experts say, the majority of Britons convicted of offenses related to Islamic extremism have been members or supporters of his shadowy organizations. They included the two men charged with slaughtering Lee Rigby, a British army soldier killed on the streets of London in May 2013. Yet other than a minor charge for holding an illegal demonstration, a series of allegations against Choudary never really stuck. In September, 2014, however, exasperated British authorities arrested Choudary and Rahman after mounting their most rigorous case against them of \\"inviting support\\" of the Islamic State. Officials focused intensely on their web casts. \\"The lesson...is that obedience to the caliph is an obligation, if they rule by the sharia,\\" Choudary says in one audio clip -- since taken down from the Internet -- according to the Guardian. \\"And to obey them obviously means they must be established.\\" A detailed report compiled on Choudary by Hate Not Hope, a British anti-extremist organization, portrays Choudary as a sinister but savvy figure with deep connections to extremism. Well over 100 Britons with some connection to Choudary and his al-Muhajiroun network have gone to Syria to fight, the group said. Choudary has disputed that he ever coaxed jihadists to go and fight. But he routinely painted the Islamic State as a religious utopia. “If you look now in the area controlled by the Islamic State, the Jews, the Muslims and the Christians are living side by side in security,” he once told the Guardian. “It’s not true that people are being slaughtered. Those people who are allied with the previous regime or those who are fighting against the Muslims, certainly they will be fought against.” Choudary also maintained early and long ties with a host of other radical groups across Europe, including Sharia4Belgium. That group is now labeled a terrorist organization in Belgium, and authorities see it as an incubator of homegrown terror and young jihadists who have joined the Islamic State. “It seems incredulous that he was allowed to continue all these years,” said Nick Lowles, executive director of Hope Not Hate, a British anti-extremist organization. “This really does put an end to his organization. Others will try to step into his place. But the people who come after him won’t have the same credibility or media profile.” Karla Adam contributed to this report.

These campaigns expanded Han sovereignty into the Tarim Basin of Central Asia, divided the Xiongnu into two separate confederations, and helped establish the vast trade network known as the Silk Road, which reached as far as the Mediterranean world. The territories north of Han's borders were quickly overrun by the nomadic Xianbei confederation.

Irfon defines the northern border of the Builth Wells area between Llanwrtyd Wells and Mynydd Epynt .","output":"Yes, these two sentences can be considered paraphrases of each other. Both sentences convey the same general meaning, which is the role of the Irfon in defining the northern boundary of a particular area. However, there are a few differences in the structure and word choice between the two sentences, which are essential aspects of paraphrasing. Let's analyze these differences: Original sentence: \\"The Irfon defines the northern limit of the Mynydd Epynt area between Llanwrtyd Wells and Builth Wells.\\" Paraphrased sentence: \\"Irfon defines the northern border of the Builth Wells area between Llanwrtyd Wells and Mynydd Epynt.\\" 1. In the original sentence, the definite article \\"the\\" is used before \\"Irfon,\\" whereas it is omitted in the paraphrased sentence. This is a minor change, but it helps to highlight that the sentences are not identical. 2. The original sentence describes the northern limit as \\"the northern limit of the Mynydd Epynt area.\\" In the paraphrased sentence, it is described as \\"the northern border of the Builth Wells area.\\" This change involves using \\"border\\" instead of \\"limit\\" and changing the focus area's name that is limited by Irfon from \\"Mynydd Epynt\\" to \\"Builth Wells.\\" Although the terms and the focus area changed, the overall meaning remains the same, considering that both sentences still point out the northern boundary defined by the Irfon. 3. The order of the locations \\"Llanwrtyd Wells,\\" \\"Builth Wells,\\" and \\"Mynydd Epynt\\" is changed between the two sentences, but their relationship remains the same. In both cases, the Irfon defines the northern boundary between two locations, highlighting the same geographic connection between these places. In conclusion, the two sentences are indeed paraphrases, as they communicate the same essential information about the Irfon defining a northern boundary between specific locations, despite the differences in structure and word choice. These differences help to rephrase the original sentence while maintaining its overall meaning."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant. You should describe the task and explain your answer.
