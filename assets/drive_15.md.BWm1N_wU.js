The film opens with the mirroring of a gloomy sky on the placid Baltic Sea waters at the Faro Island shores, near Gotland's northernmost tip. Four bathers, all in a jovial mood, splashing and joking, are returning from a swim in the cold sea. As they reach the jetty, the youngest members of the quartet, Karin (Harriet Andersson) and her teenage brother, Fredrik, known as Minus (Lars Passgard), are sent off to get some milk at a nearby farm, while Karin's physician husband, Martin (Max von Sydow), and her father, David (Gunnar Bjorstrand), a writer, go and set up their fishing nets. David has just returned from Switzerland, where he was finishing writing his latest novel, and their task gives them a private opportunity to discuss Karin's status, whose schizophrenia has been diagnosed as most likely incurable.On the way to the farm, Minus expresses his hope that their father will be successful with his latest novel's publication. On the way back, Minus confides in his sister his sexual apprehensions, which eventually degenerates into his admonishment of Karin for the (maybe) too intimate attention she keeps showing toward him. But most importantly, he confesses how much he wishes he could communicate with his father.The quartet is reunited for the evening dinner around a table in front of their cottage. Again, a festive atmosphere prevails, but soon turns sour. David confesses that while he was anxious to return to his family after his long absence, that he is about to leave again, in spite of his earlier promise to his children not to travel so often. Somewhat guiltily, and seeking forgiveness, David distributes some presents, all of them turning out to be unsuitable.

It’s a sunny and warm day in Los Angeles—a bit of a weather shock to me after 11 years of Seattle’s cold and rain. I’ve been officially on the job in the web department for all of 12 hours. I’m sitting in a conference room at a big wooden table, surrounded by my new coworkers and team members in the Getty’s web group. A big monitor is displaying the prototype of the newly designed and almost-built Getty Iris. We’re discussing The Iris logo you see at the top of this page, its multiple iterations, and, quite frankly, the pain involved in trying to get it to look right. Wait-wait-wait, let’s pause for a moment. My name is Will Lanni. I’m a Web production specialist at the Getty, which is a complex way of saying I’m a developer and designer, which is a nice way of saying that I’m basically a “web monkey.” Before I started at the Getty, I worked as a partner in a small web design and development firm for several years. I had some experience working for the Getty—I built the Pacific Standard Time at the Getty site, the Pacific Standard Time Festival site, as well as the interactive Getty Impact map. And, at the time of my hiring, I was not only working on the new design and build of The Iris, due to go live in only a month, but also the soon-to-be-launched website for Pacific Standard Time Presents: Modern Architecture in L.A. So I wasn’t exactly new to projects at the Getty, even though I was a brand-spanking-new full-time employee. OK. Now that you know who I am, let’s get back to that moment. The Iris logo, and the hair-pulling it was causing for all of us—which is a pretty good representation of the steps that Web projects go through as we move from idea, to execution, to setback, to solution. What Does Will believe about the team's endevor?  A. The team has been given an impossible task that they will not be able to accomplish.  B. The team will be able to be successful in their endevor.

I will focus on sources that offer recent, updated, and accurate information. Step 2: Analyzing the information. Once I gather enough data, I will analyze the information to identify the top cotton-producing countries, specifically looking at their percentage share in global cotton production. Step 3: Ranking the countries.

Step 4: Presenting the information. Finally, I will present the top cotton-producing country or countries responsible for most of the world's cotton production. After conducting research and following these steps, I have found that the majority of the world's cotton comes from: 1.

Ellington was born on April 29, 1899, to James Edward Ellington and Daisy (Kennedy) Ellington in Washington, D.C. Both his parents were pianists. Daisy primarily played parlor songs and James preferred operatic arias. From 1936, Ellington began to make recordings with smaller groups (sextets, octets, and nonets) drawn from his then-15-man orchestra and he composed pieces intended to feature a specific instrumentalist, as with \\"Jeep's Blues\\" for Johnny Hodges, \\"Yearning for Love\\" for Lawrence Brown, \\"Trumpet in Spades\\" for Rex Stewart, \\"Echoes of Harlem\\" for Cootie Williams and \\"Clarinet Lament\\" for Barney Bigard. In 1937, Ellington returned to the Cotton Club which had relocated to the mid-town Theater District. In the summer of that year, his father died, and due to many expenses, Ellington's finances were tight, although his situation improved the following year.  After leaving agent Irving Mills, he signed on with the William Morris Agency. Mills though continued to record Ellington. After only a year, his Master and Variety labels, the small groups had recorded for the latter, collapsed in late 1937, Mills placed Ellington back on Brunswick and those small group units on Vocalion through to 1940. Well known sides continued to be recorded, \\"Caravan\\" in 1937, and \\"I Let a Song Go Out of My Heart\\" the following year.  Billy Strayhorn, originally hired as a lyricist, began his association with Ellington in 1939. Nicknamed \\"Swee' Pea\\" for his mild manner, Strayhorn soon became a vital member of the Ellington organization. Ellington showed great fondness for Strayhorn and never failed to speak glowingly of the man and their collaborative working relationship, \\"my right arm, my left arm, all the eyes in the back of my head, my brain waves in his head, and his in mine\\". Strayhorn, with his training in classical music, not only contributed his original lyrics and music, but also arranged and polished many of Ellington's works, becoming a second Ellington or \\"Duke's doppelganger\\". It was not uncommon for Strayhorn to fill in for Duke, whether in conducting or rehearsing the band, playing the piano, on stage, and in the recording studio. The 1930s ended with a very successful European tour just as World War II loomed in Europe.","output":"The text is about Duke Ellington, an American composer, pianist, and leader of a jazz orchestra, who had a significant influence on the history of jazz."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

A local black attorney complained in Time that the new city administration did not have enough time to confer with the various groups invested in changing the city's segregation policies. Black hotel owner A. G. Gaston agreed. A white Jesuit priest assisting in desegregation negotiations attested the \\"demonstrations [were] poorly timed and misdirected\\".Protest organizers knew they would meet with violence from the Birmingham Police Department and chose a confrontational approach to get the attention of the federal government. Wyatt Tee Walker, one of the SCLC founders and the executive director from 1960 to 1964, planned the tactics of the direct action protests, specifically targeting Bull Connor's tendency to react to demonstrations with violence: \\"My theory was that if we mounted a strong nonviolent movement, the opposition would surely do something to attract the media, and in turn induce national sympathy and attention to the everyday segregated circumstance of a person living in the Deep South.\\" He headed the planning of what he called Project C, which stood for \\"confrontation\\". Organizers believed their phones were tapped, so to prevent their plans from being leaked and perhaps influencing the mayoral election, they used code words for demonstrations.The plan called for direct nonviolent action to attract media attention to \\"the biggest and baddest city of the South\\". In preparation for the protests, Walker timed the walking distance from the 16th Street Baptist Church, headquarters for the campaign, to the downtown area. He surveyed the segregated lunch counters of department stores, and listed federal buildings as secondary targets should police block the protesters' entrance into primary targets such as stores, libraries, and all-white churches.

The owner of the stage line, Mr. Butterfield (Robert Emhardt), is on board, and the target of the robbery is a gold shipment atop the stage. Small-time rancher Dan Evans (Van Heflin) and his two young sons, Mark (Jerry Hartleben) and Mathew (Barry Curtis), are on horseback looking for their errant cattle. Dan hears the cattle over the ridge, and they ride over to where they can see the robbery in progress. Dan waits for the dust to settle, but the robbers spot him, and their leader, Ben Wade (Glenn Ford), tells him to stay where he is--he'll get his cattle back in five minutes.As one of the robbers passes down the gold, the driver, Bill Moons (Boyd Stockman), draws his own gun and grabs the man as a shield.

Q: Read the following article and answer the question. Article: Expressing emotions is important rather than hiding them or keeping them inside. Everyone feels negative emotions such as anger and needs to deal with them. But there are healthy ways to express anger and ways to control it. Shouting bad words at someone will hurt the other person or make them angry too. If you feel angry, it is best to think before you speak. Some people in the UK use the expression \\"take a deep breath and count to 10\\", meaning take a pause, breathe deeply and let yourself calm down instead of getting angry. Another expression people use to say they are controlling their anger is \\"biting their lip\\". This means not letting the bad words come out of their mouth. If you cannot think of anything but bad words, it is probably best to \\"bite your lip.\\" But sometimes letting all your anger out can be cathartic , as long as you do it at the right place and time. If you have just had a bad day, you could go into a room by yourself and scream or yell very loudly. Or if you want to hit someone or smash something, you could hit a pillow instead. Then after you let your frustration out this way, you'll be able to deal with your problems more calmly. If you do lose your temper with someone and swear at them, though, you need to apologize. One way to do this is to say \\"pardon my French\\". This expression has been used for many years as an apology for bad language. Then you can calmly explain what made you upset. Question: How does this passage view expressing emotions? Answer: A:","output":"This passage views expressing emotions as important, rather than hiding them or keeping them inside. It emphasizes the need for dealing with negative emotions, such as anger, in a healthy way. The passage suggests thinking before speaking, using expressions like \\"take a deep breath and count to 10\\" or \\"biting your lip\\" to control anger, and finding appropriate ways to let out frustration, such as screaming in a private room or hitting a pillow.

Semantically related elements to \\"basket\\" could be other items that could have handles and can be taken/carried - such as a bag, a cup, a suitcase, etc. The key is to choose a concept that makes sense in the context of being 'easier to take/carry' with a handle. 3. Implement changes: Now, change the required elements in the sentence, ensuring that the sentence's grammatical structure remains intact. For instance, changing \\"кошница\\" (basket) to \\"чанта\\" (bag), we get \\"А чанта с дръжка е по-лесно да се вземе\\" which translates to \\"A bag with a handle is easier to take\\".  Remember, these alterations must be semantically related and syntactically similar, and must convey a high commonsense plausibility in practical real-world scenarios. 4. Verify: Finally, ensure that the modified sentence is accurate in terms of grammar, makes sense semantically, is related to the original sentence, and carries high commonsense plausibility.  Following these guidelines, you should be able to generate a new Bulgarian sentence based on the given sentence by making small and semantically related changes."},{"instruction":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

Question 2: I am in a relationship of three years with my girlfriend and wish to marry her but her parents don't approve of me. We are from the same caste and community. Her parents are threatening her to break up with me or they'll commit suicide due to which she is now too scared to continue with me. What should I do? Are questions 1 and 2 asking the same thing?","output":"No, questions 1 and 2 are not asking the same thing. They are two separate situations with unique elements and entail different approaches in addressing the respective concerns. Question 1 is related to an individual who is having a sexual relationship with someone that is not committing on an emotional level or in terms of a serious relationship.  In this situation, a possible course of action would be to: 1. Reflect on your own feelings and expectations: Determine if you are looking for a committed relationship or if you are fine with a casual arrangement. Knowing what you want will make addressing the situation easier. 2. Communicate openly: Talk to the person involved about your feelings, expectations, and concerns. Honest communication is crucial for understanding each other's perspectives, thereby setting the foundation for a decision moving forward. 3. Set boundaries: Establish clear boundaries that protect your emotional and physical well-being. It's crucial not to allow someone to take advantage of your feelings, and setting boundaries can help to prevent this. 4. Evaluate the relationship: Assess whether the relationship is positively affecting your life, providing you with emotional growth, and adequately fulfilling your emotional needs. If it isn't, it may be best to move on. 5. Seek professional advice: In case the situation becomes overwhelming, consider consulting a therapist or counselor to help process your feelings and guide you in making well-informed decisions. Question 2 pertains to a person in a long-term relationship facing significant external pressures due to their partner's parents' disapproval. The issue stems from the girlfriend's parents threatening to commit suicide if the relationship continues, despite sharing the same caste and community. In this scenario, the possible course of action would be: 1. Communication and understanding: Talk to your girlfriend openly about the situation, understanding her feelings, fears, and perspectives. Listen to her concerns and share your thoughts on how to handle the situation together. 2. Respect her decisions: It's essential to stand by your girlfriend's side while also respecting her decision-making process. Understand that she faces tremendous pressure and that any decision made should involve both parties' consent. 3. Seek a mediator: Consider seeking help from a trusted family member, friend, or community member who can help mediate or facilitate a conversation between the two families to help them understand your bond and intentions better. 4. Build a supportive framework: Focus on strengthening your relationship with your girlfriend and maintain emotional security, ensuring a steady support system outside her family. 5. Consider professional help: If the situation continues to escalate, both you and your girlfriend should contemplate seeking therapy or counseling to help in dealing with the emotional turmoil and guide you on your next steps. In summary, while both questions touch upon relationship complications, the underlying issues and possible solutions in each case are distinct, making them separate inquiries."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

We are big supporters of buying locally and we are here to tell you why it is so important for your family, the community and the environment. The concept of buying locally is simple: buy food produced, grown, or raised as close to your home as possible. Not only will your food be fresher and tastier, but you are helping protect the environment and are supporting businesses within your community and reducing pollution. Better for the environment Sustainability   and global warming are such hot topics at the moment, and many people want to do their bit to help support a healthier environment. Small action carried out by many people can make a big difference. Most materials in an average North American meal have traveled about 1,500 miles to get from farm to plate. To cut out a big part of this travel would greatly reduce not only pollution from transportation and refrigeration but also customers' expenses as well. Taste and nutritional content Locally-grown fruits and vegetables are usually sold within 24 hours of being harvested. Because they are picked at the height of ripeness   and travel only a short distance to the market, their freshness, nutrition, and flavor are kept. Produce trucked in from far away may lose both taste and nutritional content.

Provide a detailed answer so user don’t need to search outside to understand the answer. Given the question: Information:  - The Master of Business Administration (MBA or M.B.A.) is a master's degree in business administration (management). The MBA degree originated in the United States in the early 20th century when the country industrialized and companies sought scientific approaches to management. The core courses in an MBA program cover various areas of business such as accounting, finance, marketing, human resources, and operations in a manner most relevant to management analysis and strategy. Most programs also include elective courses.  - The Doctor of Business Administration (abbreviated DBA or D.B.A.) is a research doctorate awarded on the basis of advanced study and research in the field of business administration. The D.B.A. is a terminal degree in business administration, and is equivalent to the Ph.D in Business Administration. Successful completion of a D.B.A. is often required to gain employment as a university professor or researcher in the field. As with other earned research doctorates, individuals with the degree use the title \\"Doctor\\" in their name. The post-nominal letters \\"D.B.A.\\" or \\"DBA\\" are often used as well.  - Deakin Graduate School of Business provides Deakin University 's major postgraduate business programs covering Master of Business Administration , Master of Commerce , Master of International Business , Master of Marketing , and Doctor of Business Administration courses as well as Executive Development programs . A range of graduate certificate and diploma courses is offered as well . Approximately 3000 students are engaged in higher degrees by coursework or research , and other courses at the business school . In each year since 2008 , the Graduate Management Association of Australia ( GMAA ) awarded Deakin 's generalist MBA course the maximum score of five stars , placing it in the top rank of Australia 's MBA courses .  - Australia, officially the Commonwealth of Australia, is a country comprising the mainland of the Australian continent, the island of Tasmania and numerous smaller islands. It is the world's sixth-largest country by total area. The neighbouring countries are Papua New Guinea, Indonesia and East Timor to the north; the Solomon Islands and Vanuatu to the north-east; and New Zealand to the south-east. Australia's capital is Canberra, and its largest urban area is Sydney.  - Accounting or accountancy is the measurement, processing and communication of financial information about economic entities such as businesses and corporations. The modern field was established by the Italian mathematician Luca Pacioli in 1494. Accounting, which has been called the \\"language of business\\", measures the results of an organization's economic activities and conveys this information to a variety of users, including investors, creditors, management, and regulators. Practitioners of accounting are known as accountants. The terms \\"accounting\\" and \\"financial reporting\\" are often used as synonyms.  - International business comprises all commercial transactions (private and governmental, sales, investments, logistics, and transportation) that take place between two or more regions, countries and nations beyond their political boundaries. Usually, private companies undertake transactions for profit; governments undertake them for profit and for political reasons. The term \\"international business\\" refers to all those business activities which involve cross-border transactions of goods, services, and resources between two or more nations. Transactions of economic resources include capital, skills, people etc. for the purpose of the international production of physical goods and services such as finance, banking, insurance, construction etc.  - Professor (commonly abbreviated as \\"prof.\\") is an academic rank at universities and other post-secondary education and research institutions in most countries. Literally, \\"professor\\" derives from Latin as a \\"person who professes\\" being usually an expert in arts or sciences, a teacher of the highest rank.  - Analysis is the process of breaking a complex topic or substance into smaller parts in order to gain a better understanding of it. The technique has been applied in the study of mathematics and logic since before Aristotle (384322 B.C.), though \\"analysis\\" as a formal concept is a relatively recent development.  - Post-nominal letters, also called post-nominal initials, post-nominal titles or designatory letters, are letters placed after a person's name to indicate that that individual holds a position, academic degree, accreditation, office, military decoration, or honour, or is a member of a religious institute or fraternity. An individual may use several different sets of post-nominal letters, but in some contexts it may be customary to limit the number of sets to one or just a few. The order in which post-nominals are listed after a name is based on rules of precedence and what is appropriate for a given situation. Post-nominal letters are one of the main types of name suffix. In contrast, pre-nominal letters precede the name rather than following it.  - A master's degree (from Latin \\"magister\\") is a second-cycle academic degree awarded by universities or colleges upon completion of a course of study demonstrating mastery or a high-order overview of a specific field of study or area of professional practice. A master's degree normally requires previous study at the bachelor's level, either as a separate degree or as part of an integrated course. Within the area studied, master's graduates are expected to possess advanced knowledge of a specialized body of theoretical and applied topics; high order skills in analysis, critical evaluation, or professional application; and the ability to solve complex problems and think rigorously and independently.  - A terminal degree is a university degree that is either highest on the academic track or highest on the professional track in a given field of study. The phrase \\"terminal degree\\" is used heavily in the United States, but is used less often outside of that country. The term is not generally used in the United Kingdom or Canada, for example, and its exact meaning varies somewhat between those areas and disciplines in which the term is used.  - A doctorate (from Latin \\"docere\\", \\"to teach\\") or doctor's degree (from Latin \\"doctor\\", \\"teacher\\") or doctoral degree (from the ancient formalism \\"licentia docendi\\") is an academic degree awarded by universities that is, in most countries, a research degree that qualifies the holder to teach at the university level in the degree's field, or to work in a specific profession. There are a variety of doctoral degrees, with the most common being the Doctor of Philosophy (PhD), which is awarded in many different fields, ranging from the humanities to the scientific disciplines. There are also some doctorates in the US, such as the Juris Doctor (JD), Doctor of Nursing Practice (DNP) and the Doctor of Medicine (MD), which are generally regarded internationally as professional degrees rather than doctorates, as they are not research degrees and no defense of any dissertation or thesis is performed. Many universities also award \\"honorary doctorates\\" to individuals who have been deemed worthy of special recognition, either for scholarly work or for other contributions to the university or to society.  - The Master of International Business (M.I.B. or MIB) is a master's degree designed to develop the capabilities and resources of managers in the global economy. It is ideal for those seeking to establish or accelerate a career in international business.  - A Bachelor of Commerce (\\"baccalaureus commercii\\", abbreviated B.Com. or B.Comm.) is an undergraduate degree in commerce (or business) and related subjects, usually awarded in Canada, Australia, India, Ireland, New Zealand, Pakistan, South Africa and other Commonwealth countries; however, the degree is no longer offered in the United Kingdom.   - Higher education, post-secondary education, or third level education is an optional final stage of formal learning that occurs after completion of secondary education. Often delivered at universities, academies, colleges, seminaries, and institutes of technology, higher education is also available through certain college-level institutions, including vocational schools, trade schools, and other career colleges that award academic degrees or professional certifications. Tertiary education at non-degree level is sometimes referred to as further education or continuing education as distinct from higher education.  - Management (or managing) is the administration of an organization, whether it be a business, a not-for-profit organization, or government body. Management includes the activities of setting the strategy of an organization and coordinating the efforts of its employees or volunteers to accomplish its objectives through the application of available resources, such as financial, natural, technological, and human resources. The term \\"management\\" may also refer to the people who manage an organization.  - Deakin University is an Australian public university with approximately 50,644 higher education students in 2014. Established in 1974, the University was named after the leader of the Australian federation movement and the nation's second Prime Minister, Alfred Deakin. It has campuses in Geelong, Warrnambool and Burwood, Melbourne and learning centres in Dandenong, Craigieburn and Werribee, all in the state of Victoria. It was formally established in 1974 with the passage of the \\"Deakin University Act 1974\\". The sale of Stonnington Mansion by Deakin provoked public outrage as it involved the mansion which was at risk of redevelopment by property developers. Deakin is one of Australia's fastest growing research universities. Its combined research funding had increased from A4.5 million in 1997 to A43.4 million in 2014.  - Geelong is a port city located on Corio Bay and the Barwon River, in the state of Victoria, Australia, south-west of the state capital, Melbourne. It is the second largest Victorian city, with an estimated urban population of 187,417 as at June 2015, having grown 1.8 percent since June 2014.  - Commerce is the activity of buying and selling of goods and services, especially on a large scale. The system includes legal, economic, political, social, cultural and technological systems that are in operation in any country or internationally. Thus, commerce is a system or an environment that affects the business prospects of economies. It can also be defined as a component of business which includes all activities, functions involved in transferring goods from producers to consumers.   - Master of Commerce (MCom or M Comm; sometimes \\"Magister Commercii\\") is a postgraduate Masters Degree focusing on commerce-, accounting-, management- and economics-related subjects. Like the undergraduate Bachelor of Commerce, the degree is offered in Commonwealths nations.  - Economics (, ) is a social science concerned with the factors that determine the production, distribution, and consumption of goods and services. The term \\"economics\\" comes from the Ancient Greek from (', pronounced \\"eekos\\", \\"house\\") and (', \\"custom\\" or \\"law\\"), hence \\"rules of the house (hold for good management)\\". 'Political economy' was the earlier name for the subject, but economists in the late 19th century suggested \\"economics\\" as a shorter term for \\"economic science\\" to establish itself as a separate discipline outside of political science and other social sciences.  - Alfred Deakin (3 August 18567 October 1919) was a leader of the movement for Australian federation and later the second Prime Minister of Australia. Deakin was a major contributor to the establishment of liberal reforms in the colony of Victoria, including pro-worker industrial reforms. He also played a major part in establishing irrigation in Australia.  - Research comprises \\"creative work undertaken on a systematic basis in order to increase the stock of knowledge, including knowledge of humans, culture and society, and the use of this stock of knowledge to devise new applications.\\" It is used to establish or confirm facts, reaffirm the results of previous work, solve new or existing problems, support theorems, or develop new theories. A research project may also be an expansion on past work in the field. Research projects can be used to develop further knowledge on a topic, or in the example of a school research project, they can be used to further a student's research prowess to prepare them for future jobs or reports. To test the validity of instruments, procedures, or experiments, research may replicate elements of prior projects or the project as a whole. The primary purposes of basic research (as opposed to applied research) are documentation, discovery, interpretation, or the research and development (R&D) of methods and systems for the advancement of human knowledge. Approaches to research depend on epistemologies, which vary considerably both within and between humanities and sciences. There are several forms of research: scientific, humanities, artistic, economic, social, business, marketing, practitioner research, life, technological,etc.  - Business administration is management of a business. It includes all aspects of overseeing and supervising business operations.  - A public university is a university that is predominantly funded by public means through a national or subnational government, as opposed to private universities. Whether a national university is considered public varies from one country (or region) to another, largely depending on the specific education landscape.

Stamps.com on a (Perforated) Tear \\"We've had some great things come through,\\" Stamps.com CEO Ken McBride told me on Friday. One of his favorites was from a woman in Arizona who hadn't changed her hairstyle in 20 years; when she finally did, she commemorated it by taking a photo of her new do and mailing it as a stamp to her friends. (The company has also tried to stop inappropriate stuff. However, in a stunt, thesmokinggun.com got photos of the Unabomber, executed Cold War spies Ethel and Julius Rosenberg, and Monica Lewinsky's stained blue dress onto stamps.) With the startling recent change in Stamps.com's fortunes, the company may want to make a photo stamp out of its stock price chart. Since Stamps.com announced the new photo stamps last month, the stock has shot up 45 percent. When it announced on Sept. 2 that 40,000 sheets, or 800,000 individual stamps, had been sold in three weeks, the stock volume rocketed to four times what it had been two days before, adding 27.3 million in market cap to a company investors value at 380 million. These are pretty heady days for a company that had been near the bottom of the dotcom dog pile for years. But there's a lot to like about what Stamps.com is doing right now, and these photo stamps are just a small part. The company has been flying under the radar on Wall Street since its Icarus-like rise and fall in the late 1990s. Only two analysts cover the stock -- and one of them just started last week. But Stamps.com has quietly and cleverly changed its product lineup to address customer concerns. For instance, businesses now have the ability to hide the amount they pay for postage, so customers won't get the impression they're being gouged for shipping and handling. Stamps.com brought in new management and has inched closer to profitability while initiating large stock buyback programs. \\"They've fixed a lot that was broken,\\" says Russell Hoss, an analyst with Roth Capital Partners, who initiated coverage with a \\"buy\\" rating. \\"The underlying business is on track to be profitable in Q4.\\" Hoss didn't include any photo-stamp sales in his models for the company, but estimates that the product line carries 40 percent gross profit margins for Stamps.com. The other product lines have roughly 60 percent gross margins. Are investors overreacting to the photo stamps? Ah, yeah. At its current levels, the stock has a forward price/earnings ratio just shy of the triple digits, and though both Stamps.com and Hoss project GAAP profitability for next quarter, the recent run-up seems excessive considering it's based on an uncertain product line. I don't doubt the popularity of photo stamps -- I may buy some myself. But let's keep that in perspective. Those 40,000 sheets of stamps the company sold? They grossed Stamps.com all of about 679,600. Also, the current run is part of a two-month experiment set to expire on Sept. 30. A U.S. Postal Service spokesman won't comment on how the trial is running or what happens after Sept. 30. \\"It's a test,\\" he says. \\"We'll evaluate all aspects of the test and make our decision when it's done.\\" When it's done, it's likely that Stamps.com's competitors, most notably Pitney Bowes and Endicia, will consider launching similar services. \\"We're assuming that if this is popular, it will attract people into the market,\\" McBride says. He hastens to add that his company owns nine patents for photo stamps. But if photo stamps truly take off, I believe Stamps.com will face competition from the likes of Kodak and other photo-related firms, possibly making the product line more expensive to sustain, with increased marketing expenses. I applaud the product launch, as well as Stamps.com's other recent moves, but after its latest run-up, the stock is a little too hot for my tastes. Investors should keep their eyes on the USPS decision. They also should pay attention to the company's next earnings report, in late October, to see how the photo stamps have helped the bottom line. What is a short summary of the above article?","output":"Stamps.com, an online postage service, has seen its stock price surge by 45% following the launch of customizable photo stamps. The company sold 40,000 sheets, or 800,000 individual stamps, within three weeks of launching the product. Stamps.com has made changes to its product lineup, including allowing businesses to hide postage costs, and is predicted to be profitable in the fourth quarter. The future success of the product will depend on the outcome of a two-month experiment set to expire on September 30 and possible competition from rivals such as Pitney Bowes and Endicia, as well as photo-related firms."},{"instruction":"Please answer the following question: Information:  - South America is a continent located in the western hemisphere, mostly in the southern hemisphere, with a relatively small portion in the northern hemisphere. It is also considered a subcontinent of the Americas, which is the model used in nations that speak Romance languages.

The western portion of the island (and 61.43% of the island) is in Chile (Province of Tierra del Fuego and Antártica Chilena Province), while the eastern portion (and 38.57%) is in Argentina (Tierra del Fuego Province). It forms the major landmass in an extended group of islands or archipelago also known as Tierra del Fuego.  - Patagonia is a sparsely populated region located at the southern end of South America, shared by Argentina and Chile. The region comprises the southern section of the Andes mountains as well as the deserts, steppes and grasslands east of this southern portion of the Andes. Patagonia has two coasts; a western one towards the Pacific Ocean and an eastern one towards the Atlantic Ocean.  - East Falkland is the largest island of the Falklands in the South Atlantic having an area of or 54% of the total area of the Falklands. The island consists of two main land masses, the more southerly of which is known as Lafonia, joined by a narrow isthmus that was the scene of the Battle of Goose Green during the Falklands War.  - A continent is one of several very large landmasses on Earth. Generally identified by convention rather than any strict criteria, up to seven regions are commonly regarded as continents. Ordered from largest in size to smallest, they are: Asia, Africa, North America, South America, Antarctica, Europe, and Australia. In geology, areas of continental crust include regions covered with water.  - West Falkland is the second largest of the Falkland Islands in the South Atlantic. It is a hilly island, separated from East Falkland by the Falkland Sound. Its area is , 37% of the total area of the islands. Its coastline is long.  - Beagle Channel is a strait in Tierra del Fuego Archipelago on the extreme southern tip of South America partly in Chile and partly in Argentina. The channel separates the larger main island of Isla Grande de Tierra del Fuego from various smaller islands including the islands of Picton, Lennox and Nueva; Navarino; Hoste; Londonderry; and Stewart. The channel's eastern area forms part of the border between Chile and Argentina and the western area is entirely within Chile.  - The Andes or Andean Mountains are the longest continental mountain range in the world. They are a continuous range of highlands along the western edge of South America. This range is about long, about wide (widest between 18° south and 20° south latitude), and of an average height of about . The Andes extend from north to south through seven South American countries: Venezuela, Colombia, Ecuador, Peru, Bolivia, Argentina and Chile.  - Chile, officially the Republic of Chile, is a South American country occupying a long, narrow strip of land between the Andes to the east and the Pacific Ocean to the west. It borders Peru to the north, Bolivia to the northeast, Argentina to the east, and the Drake Passage in the far south. Chilean territory includes the Pacific islands of Juan Fernández, Salas y Gómez, Desventuradas, and Easter Island in Oceania. Chile also claims about of Antarctica, although all claims are suspended under the Antarctic Treaty.  - Owls are birds from the order Strigiformes, which includes about 200 species of mostly solitary and nocturnal birds of prey typified by an upright stance, a large, broad head, binocular vision, binaural hearing, sharp talons, and feathers adapted for silent flight. Exceptions include the diurnal northern hawk-owl and the gregarious burrowing owl.  - The Falkland Islands are an archipelago in the South Atlantic Ocean on the Patagonian Shelf. The principal islands are about east of South America's southern Patagonian coast, at a latitude of about 52°S. The archipelago, with an area of , comprises East Falkland, West Falkland and 776 smaller islands. As a British overseas territory, the Falklands have internal self-governance, and the United Kingdom takes responsibility for their defence and foreign affairs. The islands' capital is Stanley on East Falkland.  - The Atlantic Ocean is the second largest of the world's oceans with a total area of about . It covers approximately 20 percent of the Earth's surface and about 29 percent of its water surface area. It separates the \\"Old World\\" from the \\"New World\\".  - The Anserinae are a subfamily in the waterfowl family Anatidae. It includes the swans and true geese. Under alternative systematical concepts (see e.g., Terres & NAS, 1991), it is split into two subfamilies, the Anserinae contain the geese and the ducks, while the Cygninae contain the swans.  - The shelducks, genus Tadorna, are a group of large birds in the Tadorninae subfamily of the Anatidae, the biological family that includes the ducks and most duck-like waterfowl such as the geese and swans.  - Grasslands are areas where the vegetation is dominated by grasses (Poaceae), however sedge (Cyperaceae) and rush (Juncaceae) families can also be found. Grasslands occur naturally on all continents except Antarctica. Grasslands are found in most ecoregions of the Earth. For example, there are five terrestrial ecoregion classifications (subdivisions) of the temperate grasslands, savannas, and shrublands biome (ecosystem), which is one of eight terrestrial ecozones of the Earth's surface.  - The Patagones or Patagonian giants are a mythical race of people, who first began to appear in early European accounts of the then little-known region and coastline of Patagonia. They were supposed to have exceeded at least double normal human height, some accounts giving heights of or more. Tales of these improbable people would take a hold over European concepts of the region for some 250 years, until they were substantially debunked at the end of the 18th century.  - The Tadorninae is the shelduck-sheldgoose subfamily of the Anatidae, the biological family that includes the ducks and most duck-like waterfowl such as the geese and swans.  - Southern Cone is a geographic region composed of the southernmost areas of South America, south of and around the Tropic of Capricorn. Traditionally, it covers Argentina, Chile and Uruguay, bounded on the west by the Pacific Ocean, and south to the junction between the Pacific and Atlantic Oceans, which is the closest continental area of Antarctica (1000 km). In terms of social and political geography, the Southern Cone comprises Argentina, Chile, Uruguay, Southern Brazil and sometimes Paraguay.  - Tierra del Fuego (; Spanish for \\"Land of Fire\\") is an archipelago off the southernmost tip of the South American mainland, across the Strait of Magellan. The archipelago consists of the main island, Isla Grande de Tierra del Fuego, with an area of , and a group of many islands, including Cape Horn and Diego Ramírez Islands. Tierra del Fuego is divided between Chile and Argentina, with the latter controlling the eastern half of the main island and the former the western half plus the islands south of Beagle Channel. The southernmost extent of the archipelago is at about latitude 55 S.  - Geese are waterfowl belonging to the tribe Anserini of the family Anatidae. This tribe comprises the genera \\"Anser\\" (the grey geese), \\"Branta\\" (the black geese) and \\"Chen\\" (the white geese). Some other birds, mostly related to the shelducks, have \\"goose\\" as part of their names. More distantly related members of the family Anatidae are swans, most of which are larger than true geese, and ducks, which are smaller.  - Duck is the common name for a large number of species in the waterfowl family Anatidae, which also includes swans and geese. The ducks are divided among several subfamilies in the family Anatidae; they do not represent a monophyletic group (the group of all descendants of a single common ancestral species) but a form taxon, since swans and geese are not considered ducks. Ducks are mostly aquatic birds, mostly smaller than the swans and geese, and may be found in both fresh water and sea water.  - The Anatidae are the biological family of birds that includes ducks, geese, and swans. The family has a cosmopolitan distribution, occurring on all the world's continents. These birds are adapted for swimming, floating on the water surface, and in some cases diving in at least shallow water. The family contains around 146 species in 40 genera. (The magpie goose is no longer considered to be part of the Anatidae, but is placed in its own family Anseranatidae.)  - Birds (Aves), also known as avian dinosaurs, are a group of endothermic vertebrates, characterised by feathers, toothless beaked jaws, the laying of hard-shelled eggs, a high metabolic rate, a four-chambered heart, and a lightweight but strong skeleton. Birds live worldwide and range in size from the bee hummingbird to the ostrich. They rank as the class of tetrapods with the most living species, at approximately ten thousand, with more than half of these being passerines, sometimes known as perching birds or, less accurately, as songbirds.  - The coscoroba swan (\\"Coscoroba coscoroba\\") is a species of waterfowl endemic to southern South America. It is the smallest of the birds called \\"swans\\", but still a large species of waterfowl. It belongs to the subfamily Anserinae in the family of ducks, swans, and geese, Anatidae. It is placed in the monotypic genus \\"Coscoroba\\". The coscoroba swan is traditionally considered as an early branch from the common ancestor leading to true geese and swans, and recently genetic studies have associated a phylogenetic relationship between this species and Cape Barren goose (\\"Cereopsis novaehollandiae\\") as sister groups.  - Swans are birds of the family Anatidae within the genus Cygnus. The swans' close relatives include the geese and ducks. Swans are grouped with the closely related geese in the subfamily Anserinae where they form the tribe Cygnini. Sometimes, they are considered a distinct subfamily, Cygninae. There are six or seven species of swan in the genus \\"Cygnus\\"; in addition there is another species known as the coscoroba swan, although this species is no longer considered one of the true swans. Swans usually mate for life, though \\"divorce\\" does sometimes occur, particularly following nesting failure, and if a mate dies, the remaining swan will take up with another. The number of eggs in each clutch ranges from three to eight.  - Waterfowl are certain wildfowl of the order Anseriformes, especially members of the family Anatidae, which includes ducks, geese, and swans. Some definitions of the term 'waterfowl' include the saltwater shorebirds or waders, gulls, pelicans, and herons, as well as seabirds such as the albatross, but 'fowl' especially refers to birds used by humans for game. They have historically been an important food source, and continue to be hunted as game, or raised as poultry for meat and eggs and are sometimes kept as pets.  - Brazil, officially the Federative Republic of Brazil, is the largest country in both South America and Latin America. As the world's fifth-largest country by both area and population, it is the largest country to have Portuguese as an official language and the only one in the Americas. Bounded by the Atlantic Ocean on the east, Brazil has a coastline of . It borders all other South American countries except Ecuador and Chile and covers 47.3% of the continent's land area. Its Amazon River basin includes a vast tropical forest, home to diverse wildlife, a variety of ecological systems, and extensive natural resources spanning numerous protected habitats. This unique environmental heritage makes Brazil one of 17 megadiverse countries, and is the subject of significant global interest and debate regarding deforestation and environmental protection.  - Argentina, officially the Argentine Republic, is a federal republic in the southern half of South America. Sharing the bulk of the Southern Cone with its neighbor Chile to the west, the country is also bordered by Bolivia and Paraguay to the north, Brazil to the northeast, Uruguay and the South Atlantic Ocean to the east, and the Drake Passage to the south. With a mainland area of , Argentina is the eighth-largest country in the world, the second largest in Latin America, and the largest Spanish-speaking one. The country is subdivided into twenty-three provinces (singular \\"provincia\\") and one autonomous city (\\"ciudad autónoma\\"), Buenos Aires, which is the federal capital of the nation as decided by Congress. The provinces and the capital have their own constitutions, but exist under a federal system.  - The kelp goose ( Spanish : Caranca or Cauquén Marino ) , Chloephaga hybrida , is a member of the duck , goose and swan family Anatidae .

Write a title for this article: The increase in demand comes as a new tide of high-rise condominiums is hitting Manhattan. Buyers from other countries who don’t have credit histories in the United States or who do not intend to use their apartments as primary residences have historically had trouble passing muster with co-op boards. But condos pose no problem for foreign buyers, and they often find that buying in Manhattan is less expensive than buying a comparable house or apartment in cities like London. Jonathan Miller, an executive vice president and the director of research at Radar Logic, estimates that foreign buyers have bought about 1,000 newly constructed or converted condos in Manhattan in the last 18 months, which is about a third of the condo sales in Manhattan in that period. And while in the past an influx of foreign buyers could often be traced to boom times in a particular country, brokers say that the interest in Manhattan real estate is now worldwide, with buyers from Australia, Korea, Russia, Israel, Italy and Colombia. “In the late ’80s, we totally depended on the Japanese market,” said Louise Sunshine, development director for the Alexico Group, who has sold apartments to foreign investors for more than two decades. “It’s a diversity of a different kind. There’s a huge amount of new wealth everywhere.” In her work on several Manhattan condo projects, Ms. Sunshine sees this changing market up close. Buyers from five continents inquired about condo suites at the Mark Hotel at 25 East 77th Street, she said, and people from Dubai, Indonesia and Portugal bought apartments at the Laurel at 400 East 67th Street. Manhattan real estate is also benefiting because buyers have lost confidence in other United States markets, especially Florida. “There is the fear factor that prices are going to go down even further,” especially in Miami, said Jacky Teplitzky, an executive vice president at Prudential Douglas Elliman. She said that she had seen a 20 percent jump this year in inquiries from Latin Americans about the Manhattan market and recently, more inquiries from Eastern Europeans, specifically Russians. Some buyers first learned about boom markets in their own countries. Mr. Timmons rose through the ranks, handling the carpentry for 1,000 houses built by Hollioake Homes, a construction company in Ireland. He built another 11 homes on his own to resell. Now that the Irish housing market is slowing down, he has been buying condos under construction in Dubai, London and Warsaw. He read about the Manhattan market in an Irish newspaper and to find his apartment here, he worked with a Dublin broker, Kyle Thomason, who is also licensed to sell real estate in New York. Mr. Timmons said he plans to work for another 10 years, pay off his mortgages and then live off his rental properties. Ms. Thomason said that Mr. Timmons is like many of her clients in Ireland who view these properties purely as investments. They typically don’t ask quality-of-life questions — about schools, for instance. “It’s all based on what their rental yield is going to be,” she said. Not all buyers are investors, of course. After Ana Maria Ruiz, 22, who is from Bogotá, Colombia, got an internship at the Colombian Government Trade Bureau in New York, she needed a place to live. Her parents, who run a general hospital in Bogotá, tried to rent an apartment for her, but decided against it because of the costs involved and because they had no credit history in the United States, which put off prospective landlords. Renting a studio for a year in one building would have been expensive: 33,600 in rent, with half of that amount paid upfront, plus an 8,400 broker’s fee. “My mother said that renting was like throwing your money in the trash,” Ms. Ruiz said. She added that her mother, Clara, already had some experience in foreign investment. She is making almost 1,600 a month renting out a one-bedroom apartment she bought near the Louvre in 2006, Ms. Ruiz said. And since the weakened dollar had made the Colombian peso more valuable, her mother decided to buy an apartment in New York where Ms. Ruiz could live for a year. With help from their broker, Jamie Breitman of Bellmarc Realty, the Ruizes found a 499,000 studio at 145 East 48th Street, with a view of the Chrysler Building. Clara Ruiz arranged for a 100,000 mortgage through Merrill Lynch, where she had a private banking account. Once her daughter moves out of the apartment, Mrs. Ruiz hopes to rent it for 3,000 to 3,500 a month. Brokers say that Korean families who are buying Manhattan apartments typically use them for relatives to live in rather than as rental investments. So they sometimes hold out for features they would expect in their own homes. Youngchul Kim and his wife, Namjoo, first began looking for a Manhattan apartment in 2003 when their middle daughter, Yoojung, 31, began working as an architect here. Mr. Kim invests in Korean real estate, and his wife has a practice treating patients with acupuncture and herbal remedies. But the Kims were a bit perplexed by what passed for luxury in Manhattan. They wanted to buy something new and didn’t understand why people would pay a premium for a prewar apartment. But then their daughter moved to Hong Kong, so they suspended their apartment search. Last year, the Kims’ youngest daughter, Heekyung, moved to Manhattan to work for a venture-capital firm, so the family started apartment-hunting again. “A lot of Korean people automatically associate westernization and modern architecture with luxury,” said Ms. Kim, 26. “For them ‘safer’ is new construction.” The Kims first gathered information about condos at a presentation held in Seoul by Neal Sroka, a broker with the Corcoran Group. Mr. Sroka mentioned the Avery at 100 Riverside Boulevard. They studied the project’s Web site and liked the fact that it showed the views from the apartments. The Kims were also able to talk to friends who had bought real estate in Manhattan, and they were able to take advantage of new South Korean government rules that allow citizens to invest 3 million abroad, instead of 1 million. This summer, the Kims helped Heekyung buy a 1.5 million two-bedroom at the Avery with views that rival their views of the Han River from their apartment in Seoul. Their oldest daughter, Yeonjung, 32, may relocate from Korea to live with her. For some buyers, New York itself is the main attraction, and they like the fact that they can buy apartments in buildings that are recognizable around the world from books and movies. Dr. Nick Kotsomitis, a 39-year-old orthodontist from Brisbane, Australia, owns 16 investment properties in Australia and in Greece. After Dr. Kotsomitis was invited to work in Manhattan for part of the year, he decided to buy. With help from a family friend, Jimena Yudi, a broker at Citi Habitats New York, he chose a 1.885 million studio at the Plaza over larger one- and two-bedroom apartments that cost even more elsewhere. He felt that an apartment at the Plaza would hold its value better than larger apartments in lesser-known buildings. “I have a lot of investment properties, and none of them have books about them,” he said. “They filmed ‘Crocodile Dundee’ here.” In his case, the currency markets set him back. He ended up paying more when he signed the contract in August than he would have paid today because the Australian dollar has strengthened in the interim, but he says he is still happy with the purchase. But foreign buyers quickly learn that there are limits to what they can buy in Manhattan, because it is difficult for them to get into co-ops, which make up about 70 percent of the Manhattan housing held by individual owners. When Nick Ayer moved to Manhattan from London, he was looking for a writing job and a way to invest a £500,000 inheritance (about 1 million). He made a cash offer of 700,000 for a one-bedroom co-op in Chelsea. The sellers accepted the offer, but the co-op board refused to meet with him. He said he believes that although he has United States citizenship — his mother, Dee Wells, was American — he had no credit history in the United States or steady income beyond the inheritance from his father, Sir Alfred J. Ayer, the philosopher and logician. Still, he wanted to take advantage of the weak dollar and buy an apartment. His agent, Andrusha Bohackova of Bellmarc, helped him find a 668,000 one-bedroom condo at 230 Riverside Drive. He moved into the apartment in April and says he’s happy with his investment — for now. He hopes to sell the apartment eventually, move to France or the Amazon and live off the profits. “My money increased 100 percent by just coming over here,” he said.","output":"Global Buyers Flock to Manhattan: High-Rise Condos Attract Diverse International Investors"},{"instruction":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

Independent from the development of writing in other areas of the world, the Mesoamerican region produced several indigenous writing systems beginning in the 1st millennium BCE. What may be the earliest-known example in the Americas of an extensive text thought to be writing is by the Cascajal Block. The Olmec hieroglyphs tablet has been indirectly dated from ceramic shards found in the same context to approximately 900 BCE, around the time that Olmec occupation of San Lorenzo Tenochtitlán began to wane. Now answer this question: What is presumed to be written upon the Cascajal Block?","output":"While the specific details of the text inscribed on the Cascajal Block are still under study and interpretation, the Cascajal Block is generally presumed to feature an example of one of the earliest-known systems of writing in the Americas. Often associated with the ancient Olmec civilization, the text on this artifact is believed to be hieroglyphic in nature, given the presence of symbolic, picture-like forms. Following the tradition of the Olmec civilization, it is likely that the Cascajal Block contains ritualistic or religious content, as the Olmec were known to associate writing with their rituals and deities. However, due to the lack of a comprehensive understanding of the Olmec language and the deteriorating state of the artifact, the exact content of the text remains largely speculative. Each side of the Block is covered with a total of 62 signs, some of which are repeated. 28 unique signs have been identified, hinting at the language's complexity and the possibility that it may have had phonetic as well as symbolic components. One proposed interpretation suggests the text possibly describes the Olmec cosmos and their religious beliefs. According to another theory, it might be an early form of a calendar or record-keeping device. These interpretations, while plausible, are based on small samples and limited understanding of the Olmec hieroglyphs and thus should be seen as tentative at best. In conclusion, while the exact content of the text on the Cascajal Block remains uncertain due to the mystery surrounding the Olmec language, it is generally agreed that the block contains an extensive inscription that marks it as one of the earliest-known examples of writing in the Americas. Given the Olmec's propensity for religious and ritualistic content in their writing, it is plausible to suggest that these themes might also feature in the script found on the Cascajal Block."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Please answer the following question: I have a test where I am given the following article, what is an answer for the question: What are the last names of the French critics who promoted the painter who had only a few copies of his works produced? ?  El Greco was disdained by the immediate generations after his death because his work was opposed in many respects to the principles of the early baroque style which came to the fore near the beginning of the 17th century and soon supplanted the last surviving traits of the 16th-century Mannerism. El Greco was deemed incomprehensible and had no important followers. Only his son and a few unknown painters produced weak copies of his works. Late 17th- and early 18th-century Spanish commentators praised his skill but criticized his antinaturalistic style and his complex iconography. Some of these commentators, such as Antonio Palomino and Juan Agustín Ceán Bermúdez, described his mature work as \\"contemptible\\", \\"ridiculous\\" and \\"worthy of scorn\\". The views of Palomino and Bermúdez were frequently repeated in Spanish historiography, adorned with terms such as \\"strange\\", \\"queer\\", \\"original\\", \\"eccentric\\" and \\"odd\\". The phrase \\"sunk in eccentricity\\", often encountered in such texts, in time developed into \\"madness\\".With the arrival of Romantic sentiments in the late 18th century, El Greco's works were examined anew. To French writer Théophile Gautier, El Greco was the precursor of the European Romantic movement in all its craving for the strange and the extreme. Gautier regarded El Greco as the ideal romantic hero (the \\"gifted\\", the \\"misunderstood\\", the \\"mad\\"), and was the first who explicitly expressed his admiration for El Greco's later technique. French art critics Zacharie Astruc and Paul Lefort helped to promote a widespread revival of interest in his painting. In the 1890s, Spanish painters living in Paris adopted him as their guide and mentor. However, in the popular English-speaking imagination he remained the man who \\"painted horrors in the Escorial\\" in the words of Ephraim Chambers' Cyclopaedia in 1899.In 1908, Spanish art historian Manuel Bartolomé Cossío published the first comprehensive catalogue of El Greco's works; in this book El Greco was presented as the founder of the Spanish School.

Consider for a moment what it must be like to be Uwe Boll. Somewhere, perhaps in those places that Jack Nicholson said 'you don't talk about at parties', Boll knows that David Lean had head lice as a child that had more talent for film making than him. Gore Whores, metal-heads and the socially dysfunctional may bump into him on the circuit and tell him otherwise but general audiences find the Teutonic helmsman's output so bereft of originality, wit or imagination that he's become the internet's bogeyman  an online discursive synonym for photochemical excrement. Boll does his best to ride over these naysayers, exploiting tax credits available in Germany and Canada to keep working and raising money from a network of dentists as Zero Mostel did with old ladies in The Producers. The difference being that Mostel's character knew he was making bowel fill. Maybe Uwe knows it too. Such is the level of hostility toward each new 'Bollbuster' that IMDb patrons sabotage their ratings by voting 1 before they've seen it. Boll's attempts at silencing his critics by challenging them to a boxing match and knocking them out just made them more determined. Indeed he's probably the only filmmaker that's boosted thesaurus sales as critics search for inventive ways of describing garbage. This onslaught has made Uwe a very thick skinned man, so much so that he must feel like he's wrapped in a carpet, but one who feels as if he's bullied by the entire world. Like most people in that situation he lashes out, determined to upset as many people as possible with the memory of a tearful evening holding Variety's review of House of the Dead, never too far from the surface. This 'I know you are but what am I' strategy for reclaiming the initiative produced the blunt satire of Postal, which attempted to napalm the dissenters with jokes about 9/11, Christian fundamentalism, Jihad, Nazism and paedophilia. Such a litany of invective requires a satirist with the mind of Peter Cook and the visual imagination of Chris Morris but the closest Boll gets to either man is the o in their surname. In Seed, shot back to back with the aforementioned game adaptation, Boll is back with a story about a sadistic serial murderer (is there any other kind?) who gets the chair only for two attempts to fail in permanently curtailing all signs of life. Mindful of the fictional law that says anyone still alive after 3 attempts must go free, though if you'd been fried with that much electricity why would you want to, they pronounce him legally dead and bury him, only for the disgruntled killer to resurface and begin a whirlwind tour of his gaolers. Boll begins his 'exploration of nihilistic rage' with Seed watching footage of animals being tortured for experimental purposes. From there we're treated to the killer's stock in trade  kidnapping dogs, babies and grown women and allowing them to starve to death on camera only to become maggot food. We're invited to reflect on what a depraved race of amoral meat sacks we all are  our inhumanity to each other and our fellow creatures acting as a lighting rod that acts as a catalyst for the most disgusting vestiges of the human condition. Yes, we're worthless, gormless sadists and worse than that, we won't give Uwe a good rating on the IMDb. In short, humanity is bunk. Of course you might think that Uwe relies on our worst excesses for his livelihood and with that in mind it's a bit of a bipolar piece, on one hand hating its audience and positively basting itself in the sour milk of human kindness  the milk that poor old Boll has had to drink for so long, while simultaneously whipping out its member and inviting those with a pornographic lust for on screen depravity to marvel at its sheer arse splitting girth. The result says nothing about society and its discontents, more the corrosive effect bad press is having on its director. Poor Uwe is obviously a very angry man  one scene in which a poor woman gets her brains hammered to a pulp while tied to a chair, no doubt a surrogate for his own fantasy's about dispatching various web critics. That it's there but takes an avant-garde approach by failing to be attached to any kind of narrative thread, shows that Boll is a pornographer whose happy to engage with the blood lust of his audience and knows that plot is surplus to requirements. He's made a film which is competently shot but utterly desolate. \\"I wanted to make a horror movie that was no fun\\" Boll told the audience at the film's world premiere and he has, on that flimsy manifesto, succeeded but if this was supposed to convince the director's detractors that he was a serious genre filmmaker, he'll need something genuine to say as well as a better, more original way of saying it. Would you say this review is positive or negative?","output":"This review is overwhelmingly negative. The reviewer has consistently criticized Uwe Boll, the filmmaker in question, throughout the review. The review critiques the filmmaker's skills, his tactics in handling critics, and his work's lack of originality, imagination, and plot coherence. It also negatively comments on the use of graphic violence and the filmmaker's apparent anger towards his critics. The reviewer concludes with the opinion that, if the filmmaker wants to be taken seriously, he needs to have something meaningful to say and find an original way to say it."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

In a bold declaration of its ambition, the Islamic State in Iraq and Syria has laid claim to leadership of the global Islamist movement, calling on Muslims worldwide to swear allegiance to its leader, Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi. By claiming such preeminence, ISIS is seeking to eclipse al Qaeda and its leader, Ayman al-Zawahiri, in what analysts see as the most dramatic shift in militant jihadism since 9/11.

They shared quite a few common interests, but their tastes differed significantly when it came to the finer things in life. One of the most apparent differences was their views on wine labels. Katrina, the younger of the two, had always been drawn to the bright, vibrant designs that decorated some of the newer wines on the market. She believed that a colorful label represented the fun and adventure she sought in her life. Whenever the sisters went shopping for wine, Katrina would carefully scan the aisles, her eyes immediately gravitating towards the most striking labels that depicted beautiful artwork, catchy graphics, and other creative elements. Step 1: Establish the differing viewpoints of Katrina and Betty Step 2: Show examples of the different wine labels they prefer On the other hand, Betty, the older sister, appreciated a more traditional approach with her wine selection. She believed that a wine's quality and history should speak for itself rather than relying on flashy visual appeal. She tended to choose her wine based on the reputation of the vineyard and the taste of the wine rather than the style of the label. For her, a minimalist and classic label represented elegance and sophistication, which in turn reflected her more old-fashioned sensibilities. Step 3: Explain Betty's preference for traditional wine labels Step 4: Connect Betty's wine label preferences to her old-fashioned nature Although their preferences for wine labels differed, Katrina and Betty loved spending time together sipping on a fine wine. They often had discussions about the various wines they tried, comparing their personal tastes and preferences. Over time, the sisters began to appreciate the reasons behind each other's choices. Katrina started to find merit in the history and legacy of traditional wines, whereas Betty admitted that some modern wines, with their artistic labels, were enchanting in their own right.

Since we know that the playground (or the place in the premise) only had a few broken toys (decapitated statues), we can see that it wasn't completely destroyed by the fights (wars).

For those smart Asian kiddos, it's like walking through the park: easy and carefree. _  As I arrived outside of the dining hall, already a mob of students were sitting, talking, or standing silently waiting to get in. Jones students are lucky not only to have such a testing center at school, but also the feeling of their home school where it feels comfortable and familiar. \\"ID, please,\\" my former math teacher asked at the door. \\"Okay.\\" She looked over my ID, checked off my name on her list, and pointed towards the dining hall tables inside. With hesitation, I picked up my feet and was directed to a large round table in the middle of the dinning hall. At least fourteen people could sit at this table but only four were allowed to take their test here. \\"I'm glad it's multiple choices.\\" I heard one student say. All the questions on the test have five choices except for one math section where they have only four. If you get an answer wrong, you don't get any point, plus you get a penalty of a 1/4 point. If you don't answer a question, you don't get any point, nor penalties. When everyone had a seat and the actual SAT I booklet in front of them, the proctor of the test called for our attentions. \\"In front of you, you should have a SAT I test and a scantron . Please do not open the test booklet until I say so.\\" He then went on to talk about the procedures, the amount of time, signature of honesty, etc. After thirty minutes of instruction reading, he gave us all a solemn expression before saying, \\"You may begin now.

The hypothesis proposed is that \\"The girl is the woman's daughter.\\" The premise offers limited information about the connection between the woman and the little girl. It only elucidates their participation in a pottery-related activity, but it does not provide any explicit evidence or confirmation about the girl being the woman's daughter. Therefore, we cannot determine the truth of the hypothesis based solely on the information given in the premise.  There could be various possibilities as to their relationship, even if not explicitly mentioned. For instance, the woman could be the girl's mother, as the hypothesis suggests, or she could be a teacher, a relative, a babysitter, or even a family friend. This ambiguity leaves the hypothesis unconfirmed. In order to determine whether the hypothesis aligns with the premise, we would require more information on the context and relationship between the woman and the little girl. Additional context, such as conversations between the two or more background information about their history together, would be needed to either confirm or debunk the hypothesis. In conclusion, the premise does not provide enough information to confirm or deny the truth of the hypothesis that the girl is the woman's daughter.

Q:Information:  - Andreas Capellanus ( Capellanus meaning \`\` chaplain '' ) , also known as Andrew the Chaplain , and occasionally by a French translation of his name , André le Chapelain , was the 12th - century author of a treatise commonly known as De amore ( \`\` About Love '' ) , and often known in English , somewhat misleadingly , as The Art of Courtly Love , though its realistic , somewhat cynical tone suggests that it is in some measure an antidote to courtly love . Little is known of Andreas Capellanus 's life , but he is presumed to have been a courtier of Marie de Champagne , and probably of French origin .  - Chivalry, or the chivalric code, is a code of conduct associated with the medieval institution of knighthood which developed between 1170 and 1220. The ideals of chivalry were popularized in medieval literature, especially the Matter of Britain and Matter of France, the former based on Geoffrey of Monmouth's \\"Historia Regum Britanniae\\" which introduced the legend of King Arthur, written in the 1130s.  - Courtly love (or fin'amor in Occitan) was a medieval European literary conception of love that emphasized nobility and chivalry. Medieval literature is filled with examples of knights setting out on adventures and performing various services for ladies because of their \\"courtly love\\". This kind of love is originally a literary fiction created for the entertainment of the nobility, but as time passed, these ideas about love changed and attracted a larger audience. In the high Middle Ages, a \\"game of love\\" developed around these ideas as a set of social practices. \\"Loving nobly\\" was considered to be an enriching and improving practice.

They both made great progress.  Given the paragraph above, please answer correctly the following question:   Which person observed that the climate becomes colder at high elevations?  Hint: Alpine climate is the average weather (climate) for the alpine tundra. The climate becomes colder at high elevations—this characteristic is described by the lapse rate of air: air tends to get colder as it rises, since it expands. The dry adiabatic lapse rate is 10 °C per km (5.5 °F per 1000 ft) of elevation or altitude. Therefore, moving up 100 metres (330 ft) on a mountain is roughly equivalent to moving 80 kilometers (45 miles or 0.75° of latitude) towards the pole. This relationship is only approximate, however, since local factors such as proximity to oceans can drastically modify the climate. Answer:","output":"Jerry"},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Answer the following question: This article: The search for a singer-actress to play Carmen began in the summer of 1873. Press speculation favoured Zulma Bouffar, who was perhaps the librettists' preferred choice. She had sung leading roles in many of Offenbach's operas, but she was unacceptable to Bizet and was turned down by du Locle as unsuitable. In September an approach was made to Marie Roze, well known for previous triumphs at the Opéra-Comique, the Opéra and in London. She refused the part when she learned that she would be required to die on stage. The role was then offered to Célestine Galli-Marié, who agreed to terms with du Locle after several months' negotiation. Galli-Marié, a demanding and at times tempestuous performer, would prove a staunch ally of Bizet, often supporting his resistance to demands from the management that the work should be toned down. At the time it was generally believed that she and the composer were conducting a love affair during the months of rehearsal.The leading tenor part of Don José was given to Paul Lhérie, a rising star of the Opéra-Comique who had recently appeared in works by Massenet and Delibes. He would later become a baritone, and in 1887 sang the role of Zurga in the Covent Garden premiere of Les pêcheurs de perles. Jacques Bouhy, engaged to sing Escamillo, was a young Belgian-born baritone who had already appeared in demanding roles such as Méphistophélès in Gounod's Faust and as Mozart's Figaro. Marguerite Chapuy, who sang Micaëla, was at the beginning of a short career in which she was briefly a star at London's Theatre Royal, Drury Lane; the impresario James H. Mapleson thought her \\"one of the most charming vocalists it has been my pleasure to know\\". However, she married and left the stage altogether in 1876, refusing Mapleson's considerable cash inducements to return. contains an answer for the question: What was the full name of the person that James H.

As described in the process you mentioned, a functioning lamp is crucial for the flashlight to work properly, as it allows the light to be emitted when the circuit is complete.  Now, let's analyze how the absence of a broken lamp affects each of the mentioned steps in the process: 1. Batteries are put in a flashlight: The lamp's condition has no effect on this step. 2. The flashlight is turned on: The lamp's functionality is essential in this step, so having an operational lamp results in a more effective flashlight. 3. Two contact strips touch one another: The lamp's condition has no effect on this step. 4. A circuit is completed between the batteries and the lamp: A functioning lamp will allow the circuit to be completed more effectively, resulting in better flashlight performance. 5. The lamp in the flashlight begins to glow: A functioning lamp will glow more efficiently, allowing for better light emission. 6. The reflector in the flashlight directs the lamp's beam: A properly functioning lamp will produce a stronger and more consistent beam, enabling the reflector to direct the light more effectively, leading to better lighting. 7. A straight beam of light is generated: A functioning lamp greatly impacts this step, as it directly influences the quality and strength of the light beam generated. 8. The flashlight is turned off: The lamp's condition has no effect on this step. 9. The circuit is broken: The lamp's condition has no effect on this step. 10. The beam is no longer visible: The lamp's condition has no effect on this step. Thus, having a properly functioning lamp positively influences the overall performance of the flashlight, leading to a more effective and efficient device.

Both sentences mention the following actions: - Widened in 1974 - Have gravel roads on each side of the channel However, there is a slight difference in the way the other actions are presented: - Sentence 1 emphasizes dredging and mentions building gravel roads. - Sentence 2 emphasizes building and mentions dredging. Step 3: Determine if the sentences have the same meaning. Though the sentences are similar in conveying that the channel was widened in 1974 and has gravel roads on each side, the different emphasis on actions (dredging vs. building) suggests that they do not mean precisely the same thing. Sentence 1 places more importance on dredging, while Sentence 2 places more importance on building."},{"instruction":"Please answer the following question: I am trying to decide whether it's worth it to invest in this film proposal.

Movie title: Black Orpheus Movie plot: A marble Greek bas relief explodes to reveal black men dancing the samba to drums in a favela. Eurydice (Marpessa Dawn) arrives in Rio de Janeiro, and takes a trolley driven by Orfeu (Breno Mello). New to the city, she rides to the end of the line, where Orfeu introduces her to the station guard, Hermes (Alexandro Constantino), who gives her directions to the home of her cousin Serafina (LÃ©a Garcia). Although engaged to Mira (Lourdes de Oliveira), Orfeu is not very enthusiastic about the upcoming marriage. The couple go to get a marriage license. When the clerk at the courthouse hears Orfeu's name, he jokingly asks if Mira is Eurydice, annoying her. Afterward, Mira insists on getting an engagement ring. Though Orfeu has just been paid, he would rather use his money to get his guitar out of the pawn shop for the carnival. Mira finally offers to loan Orfeu the money to buy her ring. When Orfeu goes home, he is pleased to find Eurydice staying next door with Serafina. Eurydice has run away to Rio to hide from a strange man who she believes wants to kill her. The man â Death dressed in a stylized skeleton costume â finds her, but Orfeu gallantly chases him away. Orfeu and Eurydice fall in love, yet are constantly on the run from both Mira and Death. When Serafina's sailor boyfriend Chico (Waldemar De Souza) shows up, Orfeu offers to let Eurydice sleep in his home, while he takes the hammock outside. Eurydice invites him to her bed. Orfeu, Mira, and Serafina are the principal members of a samba school, one of many parading during Carnival. Serafina decides to have Eurydice dress in her costume so that she can spend more time with her sailor. A veil conceals Eurydice's face; only Orfeu is told of the deception. During the parade, Orfeu dances with Eurydice rather than Mira. Eventually, Mira spots Serafina among the spectators and rips off Eurydiceâs veil. Eurydice is forced once again to run for her life first from Mira, then from Death. Trapped in Orfeu's own trolley station, she hangs from a power line to...

(CNN) -- For once it wasn't Rafael Benitez facing the hard questions. The Chelsea manager has faced a barrage of criticism from fans and media this season, but this week he has led the English club to vital victories in the Premier League, FA Cup and Europa League. By contrast, much of the focus ahead of Sunday's home match against Sunderland was on the struggling team's controversial appointment of manager Paolo Di Canio. Is he a fascist or not?

Its contemporary usage originated with Akio Nakamori's 1983 essay in Manga Burikko. Otaku may be used as a pejorative; its negativity stems from the stereotypical view of otaku and the media's reporting on Tsutomu Miyazaki, \\"The Otaku Murderer\\", in 1989. According to studies published in 2013, the term has become less negative, and an increasing number of people now self-identify as otaku, both in Japan and elsewhere. Otaku is derived from a Japanese term for another person's house or family (oZhai , otaku). This word is often used metaphorically, as an honorific second-person pronoun. In this usage, its literal translation is \\"you\\". For example, early in the anime Macross, first aired in 1982, the characters Hikaru Ichijyo and Lynn Minmay use the term this way to address one another, until they get to know each other better. The modern slang form, which is distinguished from the older usage by being written only in hiragana (otaku), katakana (otaku or, less frequently, wotaku) or rarely in romaji, first appeared in public discourse in the 1980s, through the work of humorist and essayist Akio Nakamori. His 1983 series An Investigation of \\"Otaku\\" ({otaku} noYan Jiu , \\"Otaku\\" no Kenkyu), printed in the lolicon magazine Manga Burikko, applied the term to unpleasant fans in caricature. Animators Haruhiko Mikimoto and Shoji Kawamori had used the term between themselves as an honorific second-person pronoun since the late 1970s. Supposedly, some fans used it past the point in their relationships where others would have moved on to a less formal style. Because this misuse indicated social awkwardness, Nakamori chose the word itself to label the fans. Morikawa Kaichiro, an author and lecturer at Meiji University, identified this as the origin of its contemporary usage.  Another claim for the origin of the term comes from the works of science fiction author Motoko Arai, who used the word in her novels as a second-person pronoun and the readers adopted the term for themselves. However, a different claim points to a 1981 Variety magazine essay.  In 1989, the case of Tsutomu Miyazaki, \\"The Otaku Murderer\\", brought the fandom, very negatively, to national attention. Miyazaki, who randomly chose and murdered four girls, had a collection of 5,763 video tapes, some containing anime and slasher films that were found interspersed with videos and pictures of his victims. Later that year, the contemporary knowledge magazine Bessatsu Takarajima dedicated its 104th issue to the topic of otaku. It was called Otaku no Hon (otakunoBen , lit. The Book of Otaku) and delved into the subculture of otaku with 19 articles by otaku insiders, among them Akio Nakamori. This publication has been claimed by scholar Rudyard Pesimo to have popularized the term. Using a quote from the above article, answer the following question: Are there negative connotations for the word?","output":"Yes, there are negative connotations for the word \\"otaku.\\" Its negativity stems from the stereotypical view of otaku as socially awkward and obsessive individuals, as well as the media's reporting on Tsutomu Miyazaki, known as \\"The Otaku Murderer,\\" in 1989. This association with an infamous criminal case further intensified the negative perception of otaku. However, it is important to note that according to studies published in 2013, the term has become less negative, and an increasing number of people now self-identify as otaku, both in Japan and elsewhere."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant that follows instruction extremely well.

Jon had spent eight seasons breaking this ground to plant spring's crops and every year it got harder. Sweat beaded on his brow and he felt his cotton shirt stick to his skin under his coat. Jon took off his soft-brimmed hat and wiped his forehead. He examined the hat as he let his breath return. The hat had kept the burning sun and beating rain off his head for as long as Jon owned the farm. He wore it every day. It had been a gift given to him on the day he married Alasandra but he could not remember who gave it to him. Jon put it back on his head and pushed the tiller deep into the stubborn earth. Daven ran over the hill and down the cart path leading to their small cobblestone house. The boy had only left a short while ago and he held no sack with the bread and cheese his mother had told him to buy. Jon furrowed his brow. The boy continued to run and soon the wind carried his cry to his father's ears. \\"Papa! A carriage is coming! Two horses!\\" Jon's furrowed brow remained. Surely the boy meant a cart from a neighboring farm. No carriage made it out this far. \\"It's from the city! A soldier drives it!\\" Jon felt ice water flow over him.

They recently met and discussed their health problems over coffee. Tom had hypertension and the doc told him to change his diet.  Which friend didn't have to start eating spinach? The answer is:","output":"Jerry is the friend who didn't have to start eating spinach. Tom and Jerry, both 50 years old, reconnected after having attended high school together and had a conversation regarding their current health issues. Tom mentioned that he was diagnosed with hypertension, a medical condition characterized by high blood pressure levels. Due to this, his doctor advised him to make changes to his diet in order to manage and potentially alleviate his hypertension symptoms. Spinach is a leafy green vegetable known for its many health benefits, especially for those with hypertension. This is due to its high content of nitrates, which can help lower blood pressure by improving the function of the endothelium, the blood vessel lining. Spinach is also a good source of potassium and magnesium, which are essential minerals that help in regulating blood pressure. Since Tom was advised to change his diet to manage his hypertension, it can be inferred that incorporating healthy foods such as spinach would be beneficial for him. On the other hand, Jerry, who didn't mention any health issues related to hypertension in their discussion, is not required to start eating spinach for those same reasons. However, it should be noted that incorporating spinach and other nutrient-dense foods into one's diet is generally a good idea for overall health and well-being, regardless of whether one has hypertension or not. In summary, while Jerry didn't have to start eating spinach in relation to the specific health discussion with Tom, it could still be a valuable addition to his diet for other health reasons."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Question: when amina faints, what appears on her wrist? Title: The Mummy's Ghost Movie plot: In Egypt, Yousef Bey (John Carradine) journeys to a remote temple in answer to a summons from Andoheb, High Priest of Arkham (George Zucco). Andoheb has called him to undertake a mission for the priesthood, but first refreshes his memory on the story of Kharis (Lon Chaney Jr.).3000 years ago, Kharis and the Princess Ananka were involved in a forbidden love affair. The princess died and because of her sin, her soul was cursed forever. Kharis was buried alive along with her. 30 years prior to the present time, an expedition located and entered the tomb of Ananka. They fought and escaped from the guardian of the tomb-the living Mummy of Kharis. The archaeologists brought Ananka's body back to the Scripps Museum in the United States. However, the priests of Arkham sent Kharis to seek vengeance against the defilers of the tomb. Every person from the expedition that entered the tomb died at the Mummy's hands. Kharis was believed to be destroyed in a fire at the residence of Stephen Banning (Dick Foran), leader of the expedition.The same story is being told to a group of skeptical college students in Mapleton Massachusetts. Professor Norman (Frank Reicher) expands on the story, explaining how Kharis was kept alive by the fluid of the leaves of the Tana bush, a plant that has long been extinct.

Melanin is the brownish pigment that gives skin much of its color. Everyone has about the same number of melanocytes, but the melanocytes of people with darker skin produce more melanin. The amount of melanin produced is determined by heredity and exposure to UV light, which increases melanin output. Exposure to UV light also stimulates the skin to produce vitamin D . Because melanin blocks UV light from penetrating the skin, people with darker skin may be at greater risk of vitamin D deficiency.  and the situation: An anthropologist gathered observations for two native tribes from southern Africa.  He noticed that both tribes spend the majority of the day outside, and therefore they are both exposed to fairly high amounts of UV light. He also quickly realized that one key difference between the tribes was that members of tribe A had dark skin, while members of tribe B had light skin.  Answer the following question: Members of which tribe will be at greater risk for vitamin D deficiency? Answer:","output":"Members of Tribe A, with dark skin, will be at a greater risk for vitamin D deficiency. This is because melanin, which is present in higher amounts in darker skin, blocks UV light from penetrating the skin. As a result, people with darker skin may not synthesize enough vitamin D when exposed to sunlight, putting them at a higher risk for vitamin D deficiency compared to those with lighter skin, like the members of Tribe B."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Ask a question about Iran.","output":"What are the major historical, cultural, and political factors that have shaped modern-day Iran, and how do they influence its international relationships and domestic affairs? Iran, a country with a rich historical and cultural heritage, has gone through significant transformations over several millennia. To get a comprehensive understanding of modern-day Iran, it's crucial to explore the major historical, cultural, and political factors that have shaped the nation, including the Persian Empire, Islamic conquest, Safavid Dynasty, Qajar Dynasty, Pahlavi Dynasty, the Islamic Revolution, and foreign influences. 1. Persian Empire: The roots of modern-day Iran can be traced back to the Achaemenid Empire, established by Cyrus the Great in the 6th century BCE. This empire established the foundations of Iran's unique cultural identity, centralized administration, and developed communication and transportation infrastructure. The Persian Empire greatly valued tolerance and remained multicultural and multiethnic, influencing Iran's diverse cultural makeup today. 2. Islamic Conquest: In the 7th century CE, Iran was conquered by the Arab-Muslim armies, leading to the spread of Islam and the assimilation of Iranian culture into the broader Islamic civilization. The adoption of Islam left a profound impact on Iran's religious, political, and educational life, which continues to resonate in the country's contemporary identity and political culture. 3. Safavid Dynasty: In the early 16th century, the Safavid Dynasty, established by Shah Ismail I, marked a significant turning point in Iran's history. This era witnessed the development of the Shi'a Islamic theocracy, which united the country and solidified Iran's national identity. The distinct cultural and religious identity has remained central to Iran's political and social landscape, contributing to tensions with its predominantly Sunni Muslim neighbors. 4. Qajar Dynasty: The Qajar Dynasty ruled Iran between the late 18th and early 20th centuries. During this period, Iran faced increasing pressure from European powers, particularly Russia and Great Britain, leading to the loss of significant territories and resources. This era of colonization left a lasting impact on Iran's international relations, fostering a strong sense of nationalism and suspicion of foreign intervention. 5. Pahlavi Dynasty: Established in 1925 by Reza Shah, the Pahlavi Dynasty sought to modernize Iran by implementing political, economic, and social reforms. This westernization process, however, led to increased income inequality and disregard for traditional values, contributing to widespread dissatisfaction amongst the population. 6. Islamic Revolution: The Islamic Revolution of 1979, led by Ayatollah Ruhollah Khomeini, caused the overthrow of the Pahlavi monarchy and the establishment of the Islamic Republic of Iran. The revolution dramatically shifted Iran's political landscape, prioritizing Islamic values and anti-western sentiment, and instituting a theocratic government structure. 7. Foreign Influences: The role of foreign powers, such as the US and European countries, has been significant in shaping Iran's political and social circumstances. The US-backed coup in 1953 to remove Prime Minister Mohammad Mossadegh, the Iran-Iraq War in the 1980s with Western support for Iraq, and ongoing economic sanctions have reinforced Iran's skepticism of foreign powers and its determination to maintain sovereignty and self-reliance. These historical, cultural, and political factors continue to impact Iran's international relationships and domestic affairs. Iran's complex relationships with Western nations, its contentious nuclear program, involvement in regional conflicts, and civil liberties issues within the country are all influenced by this intricate history. Understanding these factors is essential in interpreting Iran's geopolitical strategies and addressing contemporary challenges."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant. You will be given a task.

Answer the following question: Question: \\"What might suggest that someone has stolen money in some way?\\"  Context: \\"If the highest echelons of the governments also take advantage from corruption or embezzlement from the state's treasury, it is sometimes referred with the neologism kleptocracy. Members of the government can take advantage of the natural resources (e.g., diamonds and oil in a few prominent cases) or state-owned productive industries. A number of corrupt governments have enriched themselves via foreign aid, which is often spent on showy buildings and armaments.\\"  Answer: Answer:","output":"Some indicators that might suggest someone has stolen money in some way, especially in the context of government and corruption, are: 1. Unexplained or sudden increase in personal wealth or assets: If a government official or employee suddenly acquires expensive properties, vehicles, or other luxury items without a clear legitimate source of income, it may indicate embezzlement or corruption. 2. Missing or misused public funds: Large amounts of money may be missing from government accounts or not being used for their intended purpose, such as funds for public infrastructure, social services, or foreign aid. 3. Lack of transparency in government transactions: The absence of open and transparent bidding processes or insufficient documentation for high-value government contracts can be a sign of corruption or money being stolen. 4. Nepotism and favoritism: Government jobs, contracts, or other benefits might be awarded to friends and family members without a merit-based process, suggesting that money is being misappropriated. 5. Price inflation in government contracts: When contract prices for goods or services significantly exceed market rates, it may indicate that government officials are taking kickbacks or profiting from the contracts. 6. Extravagant public projects or spending: Government officials investing in lavish buildings, excessive military spending, or other showy projects not aligned with public needs could be a sign of money being stolen. 7. Reports of bribes or payoffs: Accusations or evidence of government officials soliciting or accepting bribes in exchange for favors, contracts, or protection from legal consequences can suggest money being stolen. 8. Offshore bank accounts or tax havens: Government officials holding funds in offshore accounts or known tax havens might be hiding stolen money. 9. International sanctions or investigations: When international organizations impose sanctions or investigate government officials for corruption or financial crimes, this may indicate that money is being stolen at a high level. 10. Whistleblowers or leaked documents: Insider accounts or leaked information that reveal corruption, embezzlement, or other financial misconduct can be strong evidence of money being stolen."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Write some highlights for the following article: By. James Chapman. PUBLISHED:. 18:25 EST, 5 December 2012. |. UPDATED:. 08:01 EST, 6 December 2012. George Osborne targeted workers at the top, middle and bottom of the financial heap yesterday with a raft of money-saving measures. He ordered a tax raid on higher earners’ pensions, warning that Britain is only a third of the way through its age of austerity. He dragged 400,000 more workers into the 40p tax rate by raising the earnings threshold by just one per cent – below the rate of inflation. Scroll down for video. Smiles: Mr Osborne, grinning yesterday, targeted workers at the top, middle and bottom of the financial heap with a raft of money-saving measures. Autumn Statement: Mr Osborne admitted higher government borrowing and lower-than-expected economic growth meant spending cuts and tax rises designed to balance the books would have to be extended by an extra year, to 2018. And the canny Chancellor dared Labour to oppose real-terms cuts in welfare payments to millions of unemployed and lower-income families for the next three years, declaring himself on the side of those ‘who want to work hard and get on’. In his Autumn Statement, Mr Osborne admitted higher government borrowing and lower-than-expected economic growth meant spending cuts and tax rises designed to balance the books would have to be extended by an extra year, to 2018. Official figures showed that the hardest hit by his measures will be the top ten per cent and bottom ten per cent of earners. But today Mr Osborne defended the move to increase the number of people earning just over £41,000 who will end up paying the 40p tax rate. 'I would not describe those people as wealthy. They’re better off than many of their citizens but they’re certainly not wealthy,' he told BBC News. 'What I’ve tried to do, in a very difficult situation where I’m trying to control government spending, is make sure it is done fairly across all incomes.' David Cameron, on a visit to east London this morning, also defended the need for more cuts: We've had to take very difficult decisions and I don't hide that for a minute. 'What this Autumn Statement and what this government is all about is being on the side of people who work hard and want to get on.' David Cameron, who today addressed the Electric City Conference in east London, insisted the government is 'on the side of people who work hard and want to get on' Mr Cameron today met Daniel Hirshmann, co-founder and director of electronics company Technology Will Save Us to highlight government support for entrepreneurs. The Prime Minister added: 'By lifting the personal allowance, the amount of money you can earn before you pay any income tax, it is very close now to our goal of £10,000. 'It is hugely helpful to all working people. It means for instance someone on the minimum wage but who works full-time, working hard, we have halved their income tax under this government. 'Clearly by cancelling the 3p increase in fuel duty we're helping again people who have to use their cars to get to work. So we're on the side of those who work hard.' In a boost for Middle Britain, the Chancellor announced a surprise increase in the personal income tax allowance, meaning the first £9,440 earned will be tax free. Mr Osborne won his loudest cheers as he told MPs he was scrapping a 3p increase in fuel duty pencilled in for January. But official figures show that as a result of all the tax, benefit and public spending changes implemented by the Coalition since 2010, the average household will be around £1,140 worse off by 2015, with the top fifth of households £2,370 worse off. In other key moves, corporation tax was cut by an extra penny to 21p by 2014, compared with 28p when the Coalition came to power, and small businesses were given investment tax breaks. From 2014, lifetime pension relief allowance will fall from £1.5million to £1.25million and annual allowance will be cut from £50,000 to £40,000. The point at which debt is predicted to begin falling was delayed by a year to 2016. Estimates for public-sector job losses were increased to 1.1million, though twice as many jobs will be created in the private sector. Heads will be given discretion over teachers’ pay in a move which infuriated trade unions. Basic state pension will rise by 2.5 per cent next year to £110.15 a week. The Chancellor said that as a result of his plans, government spending as share of national income would fall from 48 per cent in 2009/10 under Labour to 39.5 per cent in 2017/18. But he was forced to concede that there is ‘much more to do’ to restore the public finances to health against a backdrop of gloomy economic data. Mr Osborne conceded the budget deficit was ‘still far too high for comfort’, though he wrongfooted Shadow Chancellor Ed Balls by announcing that having already been cut by 25 per cent, the deficit will unexpectedly fall again this year – thanks in part to a £3.5billion windfall from the sale of the 4G mobile phone spectrum. He used a fresh round of spending cuts from day-to-day Whitehall budgets to pay for investment in projects designed to stimulate the economy. There will be a £5billion investment programme in new roads, 100 new free schools and academies, science laboratories, ultra-fast broadband and further education colleges. ‘We cannot relax our efforts to make our economy safe,’ the Chancellor told MPs. ‘But Britain is heading in the right direction. The road is hard but we’re making progress. It’s taking time, but the British economy is healing. ‘As well as a tax system where the. richest pay their fair share, we have to have a welfare system that is. fair to the working people who pay for it.’ Mr. Osborne announced that he is to change the law to break a link between. inflation and the ballooning welfare bill, with out-of-work benefits. rising by just one per cent for the next three years. Under previous. rules, benefits were increased every April by the inflation rate in the. previous September, which this year was 2.2 per cent. Mr Osborne said. that as a result, the incomes of those on out-of-work benefits has. soared by 20 per cent since 2007, twice the rate of a worker on average. earnings. Labour insisted. that 60 per cent of those affected by the real-terms welfare cuts,. however, were in work – because working tax credits, child tax credits,. local housing allowance, maternity allowance and statutory maternity pay. will also be affected. Statement: George Osborne said the move would return 'fairness' to the benefits system. All smiles: The Chancellor, seen with Chief Secretary to the Treasury Danny Alexander and David Cameron, is forcing the Opposition into a corner over whether to oppose the cap. The Chancellor said a new round of tax rises and spending cuts was necessary because the eurozone crisis had hit the economy and the recession was worse than previously thought – with almost seven per cent of national income lost in 2008 and 2009. Quoting the latest forecasts from the Office for Budget Responsibility, he said the economy was now expected to shrink by 0.1 per cent this year compared with a previous prediction of 0.8 per cent growth. He admitted he was on course to miss his target that debt should start falling as a proportion of GDP by 2015/16 – the year of the next election. Instead he said it would take another year. Mr Balls, pictured, said the Autumn Statement illustrated the ¿true scale of this Government¿s economic failure¿. Announcing the cut in corporation tax to 21 per cent, compared with 40 in the US, 33 in France and 29 in Germany, the Chancellor said: ‘This is the lowest rate of any major western economy. Britain is open for business.’ Mr Balls said the Autumn Statement illustrated the ‘true scale of this Government’s economic failure’. He added: ‘The Chancellor’s fiscal strategy has been completely derailed. The defined purpose of the Government, the cornerstone of the Coalition, the one test they set themselves – to balance the books and get the debt falling by 2015 – is now in tatters.’ Labour would not say whether it intended to vote against legislation limiting benefit increases and  a move to cap overall benefit payments, saying it would study the detail.

Think like you are answering to a five year old. Summarize: The South Western Ambulance Service pilot began in February. It gives staff three minutes, rather than the current government target of one minute, to assess calls that are not immediately life threatening. The trial was launched in response to the \\"unprecedented increase in demand for ambulance services\\". It was announced by Health Secretary Jeremy Hunt in January and covers Cornwall, Isles of Scilly, Devon, Dorset, Wiltshire, Gloucestershire, Bristol, Somerset and South Gloucestershire. He said the aim was to establish if allowing a longer assessment could help ambulance services maintain or even improve the clinical outcomes for patients. In situations where a patient is not breathing or unconscious, an ambulance is still dispatched within the 60 seconds. Neil Le Chevalier, South Western Ambulance Service NHS Foundation Trust's director of operations, said since the pilot began it had doubled its \\"hear and treat\\" rate because it had the time to assess and advise over the phone. \\"It's been very successful and there have been no safety issues,\\" he told BBC News. He said the main benefit was being able to determine the most appropriate response. \\"When somebody dials 999, they're in a panic, so it can take up to 45 seconds just trying to find out where the patient is and we're frequently sending an ambulance out under blue lights on an address incident only, not knowing what we're dealing with,\\" he said. \\"This new pilot gives us two extra minutes to ascertain exactly what's wrong.\\" In the first 26 weeks, he said more than 400,000 emergency calls had gone through the system with \\"70,000 ambulances not dispatched\\". Mr Le Chevalier said call handlers ask a series of questions using a triage system of assessment approved by the Royal College of Surgeons and they also have a directory of services available to them. \\"Instead of dispatching an ambulance, we can send a mental health team, a falls team or indeed refer to a GP if that's more appropriate,\\" he added.","output":"So, there is a special group of people who help take care of others when they are hurt or sick and need a ride to the hospital. They use really fast cars with lights and loud noises called ambulances. Sometimes, lots of people need help at the same time, and it can be hard for them to figure out who needs help the most. They used to have only one minute to decide, but now they get three minutes, except if someone is really, really sick, they still send help as fast as they can. They have been trying this new way for a little while, and it helps them make better choices about what kind of help to send. Sometimes people need a doctor, or a special team, instead of an ambulance.

The words alkene and olefin are often used interchangeably (see nomenclature section below). Acyclic alkenes, with only one double bond and no other functional groups, known as mono-enes, form a homologous series of hydrocarbons with the general formula CH. Alkenes have two hydrogen atoms fewer than the corresponding alkane (with the same number of carbon atoms). The simplest alkene, ethylene (CH), with the International Union of Pure and Applied Chemistry (IUPAC) name ethene, is the organic compound produced on the largest scale industrially. Aromatic compounds are often drawn as cyclic alkenes, but their structure and properties are different and they are not considered to be alkenes. What's the best answer to this question: can alkenes have more than one double bond?","output":"Yes, alkenes can have more than one double bond. When an alkene has two or more double bonds, it is called a polyene or a diene, triene, etc., depending on the number of double bonds.

Think like you are answering to a five year old. I saw only the first part of this series when it debuted back in the late 90's and only recently got a chance to watch all three parts via Netflix (convenient service by the way). All in all, I liked this lighthearted, sometimes genre challenged, mini series. The story of a younger man falling for an older woman seems to work and the actors are all fine. Yes, it does have some romance clichés of running in the rain or a train station goodbye, but the characters have a chance to be explored so it doesn't seem cheesy, like it would be if this were some Tom Hanks vehicle or similar. Robson Greene, who at times reminds me of a separated-at-birth Scott Bakula does a fine job of someone who is head over heels in love and the ebb and tide of desire and rejection throws the series into watchable fare. Personally, I think the series could have been done with two episodes, but that's up for debate I suppose. Apparently, there's a sequel, and that should be arriving tomorrow via Netflix.

He arrived at Paddington Station and smartly turned out in his best suit, favorite Panama hat and a red rose in his buttonhole. \\"It's very exciting. There's no doubt about it,\\" he said. Until yesterday he had never been far from home, except for one trip to Aberdeen. \\"But I've been on the seas to that faraway land called Ilfracombe 21 miles from home,\\" he joked.

Up in front of me was a giant billboard advertising yet another jeweler, in ten-foot letters and bright silver watches like massive alien machines. The traffic slowed and stopped on the ramp as it bottlenecked further into the city, and my head turned to examine the sign and the blocked view of the cityscape and land beyond. Past it was another billboard, with the name of a casino as its only text, filled with collaged images of money, plush rooms, and dancers. A quarter mile further brought me to an advertisement for business management solutions. Another few hundred yards and I was urged to try the new sandwich at the new sandwich place. The sun set and the signs stayed bright as automatic light switched on. The city grew dark and the hills beyond feebled out, existing only in our minds and finally not even there. All that remained were the well-lit and shiny reminders that lawyers were standing by to take my case to court, and that somebody's air conditioners would outlast somebody else's. I had an idea. I made the call the next day. It would put me back a good half grand, but it would be worth it. There would be no design meeting; I sent them the image and it was printed. A few weeks later it went up. Now on my commute, when I paused in the crush of metal bodies, I looked up and saw mountains by Maxfield Parrish, reaching up to the clouds in impossible cragginess, rivulets and gushing streams painted down their sides, with the sun striking vibrant oranges and reds into the shadows of the rocks. There were trees in copper-patina green and still pools quieter than the middle of winter but warm as the first day of summer. No doubt people thought it was the first part of a two-stage advertising gimmick, or a filler to be used when no one was renting space on the sign. But I was happy.

Seeking advice from friends and family or using online budgeting tools can offer valuable insight and guidance to help an individual make better financial decisions. In this article, we will delve deeper into different methods to assess one's affordability, the value of getting advice from loved ones, and essential online budgeting tools available. 1. Determine What You Can Afford Understanding your financial capacity is crucial, as it helps you plan for various milestones in life like buying a home, pursuing higher education, or preparing for retirement. Here are some steps to guide you in determining what you can afford: a. Calculate your monthly income: Assess your total income by adding up your salary, bonuses, and other forms of earnings. Keep in mind that your affordability may still vary if your income is cyclic or irregular. b. List all your expenses: Catalog your monthly expenditures, both fixed and variable. Be as comprehensive as possible, including rent, utilities, groceries, loan payments, insurance premiums, and entertainment expenses. c. Analyze your debts: Take a comprehensive look at your outstanding debts, such as student loans, credit card balances, or personal loans. Determine your debt-to-income ratio (the percentage of your income that goes towards paying off debts). d. Set financial goals: Establish both short-term and long-term financial goals. Short-term objectives may include building an emergency fund or saving for a vacation. Long-term goals could involve planning for retirement or purchasing a house. e.

Personal experience: Your loved ones may have had experiences similar to your financial situation. They may offer solutions or share valuable lessons learned from their personal experiences.  b.

Emotional support: Being open about your finances with trusted people can offer emotional support in times of financial stress. They can help you stay motivated and committed to your financial goals. d. Accountability: Sharing your financial plans with your friends or family creates a sense of accountability. As a result, you become more focused on meeting your goals. 3. Utilize Online Budgeting Tools In today's technology-driven world, online budgeting tools can significantly benefit individuals looking to improve their financial management.

Mint: Mint is a free financial tracking and budget-planning app that categorizes your transactions, sets budget limits, and gives suggestions for ways to reduce spending.  b.

The brand new furniture didn't fit in the room because we forgot to measure, and the  Available choices: -- furniture was too small.; -- room was too small.;","output":"-- room was too small. It was a sunny morning as Emma and Jack stood in their new house, eagerly examining each room, envisioning the future they'd build together in their very first home. The couple decided to refurbish the house by buying some new furniture; however, they had failed to predetermine the sizes and dimensions they'd require for each room. As the delivery truck arrived containing various pieces of their newly purchased furniture, the excited couple couldn't help but notice a sense of impending doom. The boxes seemed quite large, and they were growing increasingly concerned about their compatibility with the limited space available in the rooms. Starting with the living room, it was immediately apparent that their gorgeous L-shaped sofa, complete with a chaise lounge attachment, was much too large for the room. The high-pile, intricately woven rug that was meant to sit beneath the coffee table was barely visible due to the sprawling mass of the sofa. Proceeding to the dining area, their excitement was once again dampened. They had chosen a stunning, long, 8-seater solid oak dining table, perfect for hosting grand dinner parties. However, the room's dimensions were much too small, as the table left no space for chairs to successfully slide under. The matching buffet table was forced to be propped against the far wall, partially obstructing the window, resulting in a further loss of natural light. In the bedroom, the issues persisted. Their luxurious, king-size sleigh bed, along with two elegant nightstands on either side, created a cramped and uncomfortable experience. It was impossible to open the room's door fully, as it would hit the edge of one of the nightstands. Even the heavy, floor-length curtains were unable to drape properly because the window was too close to the bed. The couple realized that their enthusiasm had prevented them from accounting for the room sizes in their new home. Feeling embarrassed and disappointed, they agreed upon the necessity of returning or exchanging some of the bigger pieces and downsizing their furniture selection. This predicament, however, proved to be an opportunity for the couple to come together, addressing the situation constructively. They began by taking precise measurements of each room and created a list of appropriately sized furniture that would still reflect their tastes and styles while matching the actual dimensions of the house. Soon enough, they were able to find more suitable alternatives. The L-shaped sofa was replaced with a comfortable, yet compact, loveseat. The massive dining table made way for a stylish and modular 4-seater version. The bedroom saw the king-size sleigh bed swapped out for a cozy, appropriately sized queen bed that provided enough space for the nightstands and other necessary furnishings. During this process, the couple gained a better understanding of their new home and the importance of scaling their purchases to match the space available. More importantly, they learned how to work together as a team, considering each other's preferences and incorporating their individual styles into their shared space. They found the silver lining in their initial disappointment and, ultimately, built a harmonious and beautiful home that they could both enjoy. In the end, although the room was initially too small for their extravagant furniture choices, the lessons they learned and the compromises they made together led to the creation of a warm, welcoming, and well-designed living space where they could grow and thrive in their new life together."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

It was huge and inefficient, and she should never have spent so many pesos on a toy, but Papa would not let her return it. He used it to preserve baby tomatoes, cucumbers, and strawberries in translucent cubes that he stored in the pantry for spring-time meals in the middle of winter. Mama kept her mink jacket, a family hand-me-down, safe from time in a stopbox, and lent the capturador to my uncle for his stamp collection. Sometimes they would let us little ones to seal a treasured toy or a last piece of birthday cake until we begged them for its release, usually a few hours after enclosing it. When my father died, a year after my mother, my sisters and I cleaned out their apartment. We found our baby shoes protected in stopboxes. I took mine home, where they sat above my computer while I worked on my first play. One night when I did not believe love had ever existed for anyone, I used my own capturador, a sleek titanium Sanyo Tardar Ahora, to undo the stopbox. Bringing my face close to the shoes, I breathed deeply of air that my parents had trapped while closing up that symbol of their love for me.

These exotic and new species can also be called invasive species or non-native species . These non-native species, being new to an area, may not have natural predators in the new habitat, which allows their populations to easily adapt and grow.

Which team's racers didn't have their muscles prepared for an activity?  Two teams were competing in a 5 km race. White team warmed up before the race, but Blue team arrived with a bus late and didn't have time to warm up properly before the race.  Hint: Sometimes muscles and tendons get injured when a person starts doing an activity before they have warmed up properly. A warm up is a slow increase in the intensity of a physical activity that prepares muscles for an activity. Warming up increases the blood flow to the muscles and increases the heart rate. Warmed-up muscles and tendons are less likely to get injured. For example, before running or playing soccer, a person might jog slowly to warm muscles and increase their heart rate. Even elite athletes need to warm up ( Figure below ).

Article: Protestantism is a form of Christian faith and practice which originated with the Protestant Reformation,[a] a movement against what its followers considered to be errors in the Roman Catholic Church. It is one of the three major divisions of Christendom, together with Roman Catholicism and Eastern Orthodoxy. Anglicanism is sometimes considered to be independent from Protestantism.[b] The term derives from the letter of protestation from Lutheran princes in 1529 against an edict condemning the teachings of Martin Luther as heretical.

Think like you are answering to a five year old. By. Emily Davies. The widow of a fusilier shot dead on a training exercise has told of her disgust after it emerged the soldiers who killed her husband will be released from prison today and be allowed to rejoin the army. Newlywed James Wilkinson, 21, was killed by machine gun fire during a mock battle in training with the 2nd Battalion of the Royal Regiment of Fusiliers in Kenya in 2011. Last summer Corporal Colin Bell, 30, and Staff Sergeant Patrick Price, 43, were given sentences of 14 months and 21 months respectively at a court martial for negligently performing a duty. Distraught: Sarah Wilkinson has blasted the appeals granted for the servicemen that shot her husband James in mock battle in Kenya in 2011. They had been married for four months when Private Wilkinson was killed. Sarah was pregnant with their daughter Annabelle, now aged two. James helped her bring up her first son Connor (all pictured together) Private Wilkinson’s widow, Sarah, spoke of her horror that the two men were yesterday granted appeals against their sentences. Their orders barring them from the army were quashed and the judge reduced them both to the rank of private. Mrs. Wilkinson, 23, said: ‘I’m absolutely shocked and disgusted that the men. responsible for taking my husband’s life are being let back into the. army like they have done no wrong. ‘Their. original sentence was not harsh and if they had any respect for James. or any compassion for my children and I they would have just kept their. heads down and got on with it.’ The couple had been married for four. months when Private Wilkinson was killed and Mrs Wilkinson was pregnant. with their daughter Annabelle, now aged two, at the time. He had helped raise her son Connor, now aged four, from a previous relationship, whom he treated as a son of his own. Private Wilkinson was killed by a machine gun, which went off in the hands of Colin Bell, 30. Widow Sarah claims Bell and Patrick Price, who was supervising, wouldn't rejoin if they had compassion for her. ‘They didn’t just take one life that day, they took several,’ she said. ‘I will always love James with all my heart and I will never forgive anyone involved for letting him die in vain. 'I hope people question who some of the heroes of our country are. I know I would die before I let my son serve with these irresponsible men.’ Private Wilkinson died when a malfunctioning machine gun accidentally fired. Price supervised the exercise and Bell was holding the weapon when it went off. Mrs Wilkinson criticised the decision to release Bell and Price from prison and to allow them to rejoin the army. She said: 'I will never get over losing my husband. I will never accept that there is no justice' ‘I will never get over losing my husband. I will never accept that there is no justice. I just wish they could accept the consequences of their actions. ‘I want to be honest with my children as they grow up. 'Before at least I could tell them that the men who killed their dad were punished for what they did, but now they have the anguish of knowing the men can continue to represent our country with pride.’ Appeal judge, Lord Justice Pitchford, said reducing their ranks was sufficient but dismissed Price’s appeal against his conviction. ‘While we accept that the consequence of the appellants’ negligence was both extremely serious and tragic, we do not concur in the view that these offences could be regarded as at or near the most serious of their kind,’ he said. ‘In our judgment, theirs was not a reckless disregard for safety but a failure under pressure of circumstances to recognise a danger which, in other circumstances, would have been clear to them.’ Write highlights for this article.","output":"This article is about a situation where a soldier named James Wilkinson was accidentally killed during a training exercise.

If you can't, please say \\"No I can't\\".  Question: gwen was captured by a wildvine? Movie title: Ben 10: Secret of the Omnitrix Movie plot: During a battle with Dr. Animo, Ben Kirby Tennyson's destruction of the scientist's \\"DNA bomb\\" accidentally sets off a self-destruct protocol in the Omnitrix. Its activation alerts Tetrax (known as Hoverboard in \\"Hunted\\"), who travels with his alien blob-like pilot Gluto to Earth in order to retrieve Ben. He explains the situation to Ben, who hasn't figured out the meaning of the countdown. He leaves Gwen and Grandpa Max behind, not wanting the latter to be recognized during their trip. Gwen sneaks on board anyway. Using the advanced medical equipment on board his ship, Tetrax finds the DNA signature of the Omnitrix's creator, Azmuth, and tracks him to a prison facility called Incarcecon. During the journey, Tetrax hopes Ben would stop being a hero when the Omnitrix stop the countdown and Azmuth would shut it up for good. Ben is upset that he'll never be a hero again. After staging a breakout, they free a female Chimera Sui Generis (Vilgax's species) named Myaxx, who is Azmuth's assistant; she had switched her DNA signature for Azmuth's when he refused to give her credit for helping to create the Omnitrix. Myaxx is also unable to disarm the self-destruct, which will not only kill Ben, but most of the universe's inhabitants, including Earth itself, but Myaxx knows how to find Azmuth, and leads them to the planet he's hiding out on: Xenon. Vilgax, who has also picked up on the Omnitrix's self-destruct signal, picks up Sixsix (an alien who also appeared in 'Hunted' and tracks Ben). While attempting to reach Azmuth, they are attacked by Vilgax, who has escaped the Null Void and has commandeered a ship to track down Ben. Ben is ultimately successful in repelling the attack, though Gluto is killed in the conflict while protecting Gwen. Gwen blames Ben's selfishness despite the fact that Ben had nothing to do with it. Tetrax's ship crashes on Azmuth's homeworld. As they enter his mountain fortress, they are attacked by a group of Florauna (Wildvine's species) which capture Gwen. Ben is depressed, and blames... Answer:","output":"Yes, I can help answer your questions regarding the film proposal for \\"Ben 10: Secret of the Omnitrix.\\" In the movie plot you provided, Gwen was indeed captured by a Florauna, which is the species of the \\"Wildvine\\" alien from the Ben 10 series. These creatures are known for their plant-like features, vine growth abilities, and agility. This moment where Gwen is captured adds a sense of tension and urgency to the story, as Ben must now not only worry about the self-destructing Omnitrix but also the safety of his cousin. As for the movie title, \\"Ben 10: Secret of the Omnitrix\\" is an appropriate choice since the storyline revolves around the protagonist, Ben Tennyson, discovering more about the origin and creator of the Omnitrix device, which is a key element in the series. It also implies that there are hidden aspects of the Omnitrix that both Ben and the audience have yet to uncover, adding a sense of curiosity and intrigue to the film. When it comes to the movie's plot, the film focuses on the urgency of Ben's quest to stop the self-destruct countdown of his powerful Omnitrix device. This is accomplished by introducing new and returning characters that provide information and assistance throughout his journey. The stakes are high since the Omnitrix self-destructing would result not only in Ben's death, but also the obliteration of a significant portion of the universe, including Earth. Some points to consider while deciding on investing in this film proposal include the popularity and longevity of the Ben 10 franchise, which has a dedicated fan base. Additionally, the proposal presents an engaging storyline with high stakes and character development. The inclusion of familiar faces from the series and the introduction of new characters, such as Myaxx and Gluto, may attract more fans and promote the film's success. In the end, deciding to invest in this film proposal depends on factors such as the potential target audience, budget, and the reputation of the creators and production team. Weighing the benefits of investing in this proposal, such as the popularity of the franchise and an exciting storyline with high stakes, against potential downsides like the financial commitment and risks of the investment, will help determine if it is a worthwhile and profitable endeavor."},{"instruction":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

Unbeknownst to her, she is betrothed to the cruel Esteban, a union that will further solidify the Montenegro family’s iron grip on the town. Despite her feisty nature, the naïve Charlotte is unaware of Esteban's nefarious intentions. As fate would have it, Charlotte meets Diego at a local marketplace, and, in an instant, the pair falls deeply in love. Diego is captivated by Charlotte's enchanting beauty and fierce spirit, while Charlotte is drawn to Diego's kindness and bravery. Unfortunately, their whirlwind romance is short-lived, as Esteban quickly learns of their secret affair.

Diego, driven by his unwavering love for Charlotte and his commitment to justice, grapples with the difficult decision. In the end, he chooses to surrender to Esteban, offering his own life in exchange for Charlotte's freedom. As the townspeople rally in support of Diego, Esteban is forced to accept his surrender, believing that, without their leader, the Sanciscos will be weakened and eventually crushed. Under Esteban's captivity, Diego endures an array of brutal punishments and humiliation. However, his love for Charlotte and the unwavering hope for a better future for their town keeps him going. Meanwhile, Charlotte, now free but heartbroken over the loss of Diego, discovers Esteban's true intentions and begins to rally the townspeople and the Sanciscos to rise against the Montenegros.

In an epic struggle that tests the limits of their courage and determination, the Sanciscos and the people of Esperanza face off against the Montenegro forces. And, in the final battle, Diego and Esteban engage in a brutal, one-on-one duel for the control of Esperanza. Ultimately, Diego, fueled by his love for Charlotte and his desire for justice, slays Esteban, ending the Montenegro family's reign of terror. With the town finally liberated, Diego and Charlotte's love blossoms anew, as they embark on a journey to heal Esperanza and rebuild the lives of its people - together. As the sun sets over Esperanza, a new era of hope and prosperity begins, with Diego and Charlotte united in love and bound to their shared destiny. Through their undying courage and unwavering commitment to each other, they have written a new chapter in the legendary tale of the town.

A command can be broken down into many different actions. Actions are uppercase and are individual steps that serve as the building blocks for a command. For commands, 'left' and 'right' are used to denote the direction of an action. The word 'opposite' turns the agent backward in the specified direction. The word 'around' makes the agent execute an action while turning around in the specified direction. The word 'and' means to execute the next scope of the command following the previous scope of the command. The word 'after' signifies to execute the previous scope of the command following the next scope of the command. The words 'twice' and 'thrice' trigger repetition of a command that they scope over two times or three times, respectively. There are only six actions: 'I_LOOK', 'I_WALK', 'I_RUN', 'I_JUMP', 'I_TURN_LEFT', and 'I_TURN_RIGHT'.

Actions and commands do not have quotations in the input and output. jump opposite left and run opposite left thrice A:","output":"Part #1: The word 'opposite' turns the agent backward in the specified direction. Usage: \\"jump opposite left\\" means the agent will first perform \\"I_JUMP\\" while turning backward in the left direction. This meets the criteria because the agent is executing an action that involves turning in the specified (left) direction but in the opposite way. Part #2: The word 'and' means to execute the next scope of the command following the previous scope of the command. Usage: \\"jump opposite left and run\\" instructs the agent to perform \\"I_JUMP\\" in the opposite left direction, followed by \\"I_RUN\\". The 'and' indicates that the next part of the command will be executed after the jump action is completed. Part #3: The word 'opposite' turns the agent backward in the specified direction, and the word 'around' makes the agent execute an action while turning around in the specified direction. Usage: \\"run opposite left\\" means the agent will perform \\"I_RUN\\" while turning backward in the left direction. This aligns with the criteria because the agent is performing the run action along with turning in the specified (left) direction, but in the opposite way. Part #4: The words 'twice' and 'thrice' trigger repetition of a command that they scope over two times or three times, respectively. Usage: \\"run opposite left thrice\\" means the agent will execute the \\"I_RUN\\" action in the opposite left direction three times.

The second question, \\"Why do I see the size of Injustice: God among us as 2.11gb on my device whereas 1.24gb on other devices?\\", pertains to the storage space occupied by the game \\"Injustice: Gods Among Us\\" on different devices. This question is unrelated to banking or financial instruments, and instead concerns file size discrepancies between devices, which can be caused by various factors. For example, different devices may have distinct variations of the game optimized for their hardware or operating system, leading to differences in file size. Additionally, updates or additional game content downloaded on one device but not on another could contribute to a difference in storage space required. In conclusion, the two questions are different – one is related to banking and payment instruments, while the other deals with a specific video game's storage size across multiple devices."},{"instruction":"Question: Given the following passage  \\"Among the challenges being faced to improve the efficiency of LED-based white light sources is the development of more efficient phosphors.

Please answer the following question: Information:  - The Triglidae, commonly known as sea robins or gurnard, are a family of bottom-feeding scorpaeniform fish. They get their name (sea robin) from the orange ventral surface of the species in the Western Atlantic (\\"Prionotus carolinus\\") and from large pectoral fins, which, when swimming, open and close like a bird's wings in flight. The large surface area of the fins also permits the fish to glide short distances above the water surface, much like a flying fish.  - The scaly gurnard , Lepidotrigla brachyoptera , is a searobin of the family Triglidae , found around New Zealand including the Kermadec Islands , at depths of between 35 and 300 m. Its length is up to 15 cm.  - New Zealand is an island nation in the southwestern Pacific Ocean. The country geographically comprises two main landmassesthat of the North Island, or Te Ika-a-Mui, and the South Island, or Te Waipounamuand numerous smaller islands. New Zealand is situated some east of Australia across the Tasman Sea and roughly south of the Pacific island areas of New Caledonia, Fiji, and Tonga. Because of its remoteness, it was one of the last lands to be settled by humans. During its long period of isolation, New Zealand developed a distinct biodiversity of animal, fungal and plant life. The country's varied topography and its sharp mountain peaks, such as the Southern Alps, owe much to the tectonic uplift of land and volcanic eruptions. New Zealand's capital city is Wellington, while its most populous city is Auckland.  - Tonga (or ; Tongan: \\"Puleanga Fakatui o Tonga\\"), officially the Kingdom of Tonga, is a Polynesian sovereign state and archipelago comprising 169 islands of which 36 are inhabited. The total surface area is about scattered over of the southern Pacific Ocean. It has a population of 103,000 people of whom 70% reside on the main island of Tongatapu.  - The Exocoetidae are a family of marine fish in the order Beloniformes class Actinopterygii. Fish of this family are known as flying fish. About 64 species are grouped in seven to nine genera. Flying fish can make powerful, self-propelled leaps out of water into air, where their long, wing-like fins enable gliding flight for considerable distances above the water's surface. This uncommon ability is a natural defense mechanism to evade predators.  - A fish is any member of a group of organisms that consist of all gill-bearing aquatic craniate animals that lack limbs with digits. They form a sister group to the tunicates, together forming the olfactores. Included in this definition are the living hagfish, lampreys, and cartilaginous and bony fish as well as various extinct related groups. Tetrapods emerged within lobe-finned fishes, so cladistically they are fish as well. However, traditionally fish are rendered obsolete or paraphyletic by excluding the tetrapods (i.e., the amphibians, reptiles, birds and mammals which all descended from within the same ancestry). Because in this manner the term \\"fish\\" is defined negatively as a paraphyletic group, it is not considered a formal taxonomic grouping in systematic biology. The traditional term pisces (also ichthyes) is considered a typological, but not a phylogenetic classification.  - The Southern Alps (Mori: K Tiritiri o te Moana ) are a mountain range extending along much of the length of New Zealand's South Island, reaching its greatest elevations near the island's western side. The term \\"Southern Alps\\" generally refers to the entire range, although separate names are given to many of the smaller ranges that form part of it.    What is the relationship between 'scaly gurnard' and 'species'? Answer:","output":"The relationship between 'scaly gurnard' and 'species' is that the scaly gurnard (Lepidotrigla brachyoptera) is a specific species of sea robin belonging to the family Triglidae. It is a type of bottom-feeding scorpaeniform fish found around New Zealand and the Kermadec Islands at depths between 35 and 300 meters."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

The teenager was spotted by an anti-crime patrol unit driving in an unmarked police car in a neighborhood in Brooklyn, according to official reports. The incident began when members of the NYPD who were patrolling the area noticed a group of men congregating on a street corner, with the 16-year-old among them. The officers paid particular attention to the teenager, who appeared to be fidgeting with his waistband as he walked away from the group. Given the city's increased focus on reducing gun violence, the officers decided to approach the young man for questioning. As the officers left their unmarked vehicle and moved closer to the teenager, police reports state that the situation escalated quickly when the 16-year-old turned on the approaching officers and allegedly aimed a .357 caliber revolver at them. The sudden show of aggression left the officers with little choice but to open fire on the teen in self-defense, resulting in his death. The identity of the deceased teenager has yet to be released, pending notification of his family, and an investigation into the incident is currently ongoing. NYPD has not disclosed the specific number of shots that were fired but confirmed that the teenager was declared dead at the scene. It is not yet clear whether the .357 caliber revolver found in the possession of the teenager was legally registered or if he had any previous criminal record. This disturbing incident comes at a time when gun violence in New York City has seen a marked uptick in recent months, prompting a significant increase in police presence and patrols in certain neighborhoods. With Mayor Bill de Blasio focusing on reducing crime rates as a part of his public safety agenda, incidents like this one highlight the challenge the city faces in addressing the growing concerns around gun violence and community safety. The actions of the NYPD officers involved will undoubtedly come under scrutiny, as officer-involved fatalities continue to be a point of contention and debate nationwide. Police departments across the United States have grappled with calls for reform, increased accountability, and more transparent practices as communities demand more responsiveness from their law enforcement agencies. As the investigation into this incident continues, the NYPD and the city's leadership will face tough questions on how best to balance the need to ensure public safety while also rebuilding trust between the police and the communities they serve. While the shooting may have been the result of an immediate threat to the officers' lives, critics may argue whether there could have been alternative solutions or approaches that wouldn't have ended in the loss of a young life."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

The \\"Company\\" probably acquires bodies through a secretive and ethically questionable process, likely involving individuals who are desperate or in vulnerable situations. The film serves as a commentary on the lengths people are willing to go for a shot at eternal youth and a perceived fresh start, as well as the potential consequences of trying to escape one's past instead of facing it head-on. Overall, the film is a thought-provoking exploration of the human pursuit of everlasting youth and raises ethical questions about the potential of medical science to give people an opportunity to start anew in a different, younger body."},{"instruction":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

Please answer the following question: What is the first name of the person in whose place Hugh Robertson was appointed complex manager at Rockefeller Center?  Answer the above question based on the context below:  The management of Rockefeller Center shifted around this time. In November 1936, John Todd was featured in two New Yorker articles that emphasized his role in the complex's construction. At the same time, Nelson was gaining clout within Rockefeller Center Inc., and he disagreed with nearly all of Todd's suggestions. Nelson's father, John, was relinquishing his responsibilities, since the Rockefeller family's youngest son David had moved out of the family home at 10 West 54th Street, and John was now focusing on his own personal life. By April 1937, Todd regretted his decision to be featured in The New Yorker. In March 1938, Nelson became the president of Rockefeller Center Inc. He then fired Todd as the complex's manager and appointed Hugh Robertson in his place. Nelson and Robertson wanted to avoid workers' strikes, which would delay the completion of construction. Nelson, Robertson, and the workers' unions agreed to a contract in which the unions would not strike, Robertson would not lock out union workers, and both would agree to arbitration if a labor dispute arose. Rockefeller Center was one of Nelson's primary business ventures until 1958, when he was elected Governor of New York.Public relations officials were hired to advertise the different parts of the complex, such as the gardens and the plaza. Merle Crowell set up a viewing platform on the east side of Rockefeller Center and founded the facetious \\"Sidewalk Superintendents' Club\\" so the public could view construction.

De Long's party found no immediate sign at their landing-place of any human habitation, and had only a sketchy idea of where they were—Petermann's map provided few useful details. On September 19, having buried their non-essential possessions in a mound marked by a tent pole, they set out in search of settlements. Progress was hampered by the poor physical condition of the men, in particular Eriksen, who was badly affected by frostbite. On September 21 they halted at two empty huts, probably part of a hunting camp, where Alexey raised spirits by shooting a deer to replenish their dwindling food stocks. De Long allowed his exhausted party several days' rest before resuming the march.On September 28 the party found a large hut, with signs of recent occupation–edible food in the store, and moccasin tracks in the snow.

Jessica was much less friendly. (b). Tanya was much less friendly.","output":"Tanya was much less friendly. Jessica took the lead in social situations with Tanya since Tanya was much less friendly. Tanya's introverted nature made it difficult for her to feel comfortable or charismatic during interactions with new people. As a result, Jessica often assumed the role of the catalyst, making introductions and initiating conversations on behalf of the duo. Jessica had thought about the origins of Tanya’s introverted nature and believed it might trace back to her childhood. Growing up in a strict household, Tanya's parents always emphasized the importance of obedience and compliance. As a result, Tanya developed an innate fear of displeasing others that had followed her into adulthood. This fear manifested in her social interactions, often leading her to avoid initiating conversations or sharing her opinions openly, lest she unintentionally offend someone. On the other hand, Jessica grew up in a relatively carefree environment. Her upbringing was filled with love, laughter, and encouragement to pursue her dreams. As a result, Jessica developed a strong sense of self-confidence which shined through when engaging with others. To help Tanya feel comfortable in social scenarios, Jessica adopted a few key strategies. Initially, she ensured that they always arrived at events together, establishing their united presence upon arrival. This tactic allowed Tanya to feel safe and secure, knowing that she had someone to rely on throughout the gathering. Additionally, Jessica made it a point to inquire about Tanya's interests and opinions prior to attending gatherings, providing her with talking points to focus on during conversations. Armed with this knowledge, she began nudging Tanya into fray, gently encouraging her to speak up when the conversation shifted to familiar territory. While this was challenging at first, over time, Tanya became more adept at recognizing opportunities to contribute and found her voice in these settings. Furthermore, Jessica intentionally engaged Tanya in conversations with thoughtful questions and commentary, subtly bridging gaps between Tanya and other party-goers. This approach not only provided Tanya with validation and reassurance but also allowed others to view her as a valuable and engaging conversationalist. With time and patience, Tanya's social skills slowly began to evolve. She started discovering her own unique conversational style, and though she still leaned heavily on Jessica’s support, she began to grow more comfortable articulating her thoughts and ideas. Jessica's unwavering kindness and understanding played a crucial role in reshaping Tanya's perspective on social settings, leading her on a journey towards becoming a more generous and open-hearted individual. As their friendship blossomed, it became evident that Jessica's extroverted nature complemented Tanya's introverted disposition. Their bond strengthened as they taught each other valuable lessons about communication, empathy, and the beauty of embracing the differences that existed within themselves and others. Ultimately, Jessica and Tanya discovered that their contrasting personalities were instrumental in forming the foundation of a rich, lasting friendship that transcended the nuances of social expectations and norms."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Find the right ending to this passage. (CNN) -- Colorado theater shooting suspect James Holmes will wear a hidden harness under his clothes to restrain him during his trial, which will have the largest jury pool in state history. Holmes is accused of killing 12 people and wounding dozens more in an Aurora movie theater. He will wear the harness, which will be anchored to the floor, because of the violent nature of his alleged crimes, a judge said. Judge Carlos Samour Jr. will send out 5,000 jury summons and expects at least 3,200 people will end up in court, he ruled on Thursday. That would mean each of the 450,000 Arapahoe County residents eligible for jury duty would have a 1 in 90 chance of being called, for this one case alone, court spokesman Rob McCallum told CNN. The idea is to bring in 800 prospective jurors at a time on Thursdays and Fridays early next year, a process that","output":"is expected to take several weeks to complete. Once all prospective jurors have been given the opportunity to report to the court, the selection process will begin to whittle down the large pool to a final jury of 12, with a few alternates. This process will involve extensive questioning in both individual and group settings, as well as careful background checks to ensure that each juror is unbiased and able to fulfill their duties. Due to the high-profile nature of the case and the severity of the alleged crimes, finding impartial jurors may prove to be a challenging task. The attorneys from both the prosecution and defense will play a critical role in this phase, raising objections and striking potential jurors based on their beliefs, opinions, and personal experiences. The judge, in turn, will have the final say in approving or excusing these individuals from serving on the jury. Once the jury has been selected, the trial will commence, with both the prosecution and defense presenting their cases. The prosecution will aim to prove beyond a reasonable doubt that Holmes is guilty of the charges against him, while the defense will work diligently to create doubt in the jurors' minds and fight for an acquittal or lesser charge. The trial is expected to be lengthy, given the complexity of the case, the numerous witnesses, and the vast amount of evidence to be reviewed. As the trial progresses, emotions will undoubtedly run high, with both the family members of the victims and the survivors themselves likely to provide heart-wrenching testimony. The intense media coverage and public interest will place an additional layer of scrutiny upon every aspect of the trial. In light of this, Judge Samour will have to maintain a firm grip on proceedings to ensure that decorum and order are maintained. Following the closing arguments from both prosecution and defense, the jury will be sequestered, tasked with the monumental job of deciding the fate of James Holmes. They will be required to weigh all the evidence, testimonies, and arguments presented before them and reach a unanimous decision. This process could take anywhere from a few days to several weeks, given the gravity of the charges and the intricacy of the case. Ultimately, the resolution of the Colorado theater shooting trial hinges on the determination and diligence of these citizens, as they fulfill their civic duty in search of the truth and justice. Regardless of the outcome, the trial will undoubtedly serve as a somber reminder of the tragic events that occurred in Aurora, and the need for continued efforts to prevent such acts of senseless violence in the future."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

For climates that occasionally go without rain for several days to several weeks, additional watering is almost certainly needed. Check the condition of the soil on a regular basis. Once the surface feels dry, you should give the soil a thorough drenching. Never let the roots stay too dry for too long, even after the plant is established. Rather than giving small watering every day, give a heavy watering every few days. Feed the plant with a slow-release fertilizer at the start of spring, and give them an additional dose six to eight weeks later. You can either use an all-purpose fertilizer that contains equal parts nitrogen, phosphorus, and potassium, or you can opt for a fertilizer that contains higher levels of nitrogen and phosphorus. Phosphorus helps with root and flower development, while nitrogen aids in the establishment of full, vibrant foliage. Note that you should only apply fertilizer when the soil is wet. Water the soil upon application so that the fertilizer washes down below the surface. Fertilizer should also be applied during the early morning or evening, when the temperatures have cooled. Following both of these measures will prevent the fertilizer from burning your plant. Use bark chips or any other type of mulch that retains moisture well. Scattering a solid layer of mulch around the plant base helps the soil stay moist and also acts as a type of weed control. Additionally, decomposing mulch can add more nutrients to the surrounding soil. The plants spread quickly, and as they spread, large clumps of root form. The crowns of these clumps tend to rise above the soil. You should cover the crowns with loamy soil to keep the roots from drying out. The most common insects and diseases to attack the Astilbe plant include the tarnished plant bug, powdery mildew, and bacterial leaf spots. Even so, the plant is not especially prone to pests. If any of these problems do emerge, you can apply an appropriate insecticide or fungicide then. Preventative pesticides are not recommended, however. Every spring, you should take divisions of the Astilbe plant's roots to prevent the roots from choking each other out. You can replant these divisions to create new plants, give them to gardening friends, or discard them. You can use your divided plants to form a solid bed of color, or line a shaded garden pathway with your beautiful flowers. Summary:","output":"This article discusses caring for Astilbe plants in various climates, stressing the importance of regular soil check, thorough watering, using slow-release fertilizer, mulching, protecting roots and crowns, managing pests and diseases, and dividing roots annually to maintain healthy growth and vibrant foliage."},{"instruction":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation. Think like you are answering to a five year old. Summarize this article: A 42-year-old man, understood to be Robert Daniel, was treated for an arm injury after being shot outside his home in Stepps on Sunday evening. Detectives are treating the \\"targeted\\" attack as attempted murder. They believe a white Audi estate driven by the suspects fled along the M80 towards Glasgow. They are particularly keen to hear from anyone who may have dashcam footage. The victim was reversing his car out of his drive in Honeywell Drive, Cardowan, just after 21:00 on Sunday when a white Audi estate car pulled up and several shots were fired. A car matching the description was later found burnt out in the Haghill area. Officers are still trying to establish how many occupants were in the Audi and said inquiries had revealed it sped off down Honeywell Drive and into Dewar Road. It then drove onto the M80 heading towards Glasgow before finally ending up in Hogarth Park, Haghill. Det Supt Kenny Graham said: \\"We are following up a number of lines of enquiry. However, we know several people were walking in Dewar Road and in the surrounding areas around the time of the incident. I would urge these people to contact us as I'm sure they have information which could assist our ongoing investigation. \\"In terms of the M80, I am appealing to motorists who were on that road on Sunday night, in particular, anyone with any dashcam footage is asked to pass it on to police. \\"It could offer us vital footage on the occupants of the car which could lead us to tracing whoever is responsible for this crime.\\" Detectives have previously said the shooting may be linked to organised crime. Officers were continuing to carry out door-to-door inquiries and CCTV footage was still being examined. Summary:","output":"A man got hurt in his arm because someone shot at him outside his house. The police think it was on purpose and are trying to find the people who did it. They drove away in a white car and the police want to find anyone with video from their car cameras to help.

Answer the following question: Question: John ran very fast, his feet touched the ground in what way?  Choices:  - behind - loose - feverishly - slowly - lightly  The rationale to choose \\"lightly\\" as the answer is that: Answer:","output":"Lightly Step 1: Analyze the question and choices First, we need to understand the question and available choices. The question asks how John's feet touched the ground when he ran very fast. Step 2: Eliminate irrelevant choices We can eliminate some choices right away if they do not relate to the manner in which John's feet touched the ground while running fast. We can remove \\"behind\\" as it is not relevant to how John's feet touch the ground. \\"Loose\\" and \\"feverishly\\" can also be eliminated, as they do not describe the contact between feet and the ground. Step 3: Compare the remaining choices Now, we are left with two choices: \\"slowly\\" and \\"lightly.\\" Let's analyze both options in the context of the question. Step 4: Analyze the \\"slowly\\" option When someone runs very fast, their feet generally do not touch the ground \\"slowly.\\" In fact, it would be contradictory, as running fast implies quick movements and less time in contact with the ground. Step 5: Analyze the \\"lightly\\" option Running fast requires minimal ground contact time and proper running form. A faster runner typically lands more lightly on their feet since they spend less time contacting the ground and more time propelling themselves forward. This option makes sense in the context of the question. Step 6: Choose the most appropriate answer Based on the previous steps, we can conclude that \\"lightly\\" is the most suitable answer, as it describes how John's feet touched the ground when he ran very fast. The rationale for choosing \\"lightly\\" is that it corresponds to the reduced ground contact time and better running form typically associated with faster running."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Elections to the Senate are held on the first Tuesday after the first Monday in November in even-numbered years, Election Day, and coincide with elections for the House of Representatives. Senators are elected by their state as a whole. The Elections Clause of the United States Constitution grants each state (and Congress, if it so desires to implement a uniform law) the power to legislate a method by which senators are elected. Ballot access rules for independent and minor party candidates also vary from state to state. Can we conclude that does the whole state vote for both senators?","output":"Yes, we can conclude that the whole state votes for both senators, but it is essential to recognize that senators' elections are staggered and not held simultaneously. In the United States, the Senate is composed of two senators from each state, and every senator serves a six-year term. However, these terms are staggered so that approximately one-third of the Senate seats are up for election every two years. These staggered elections are intended to preserve the Senate's stability and maintain a balance of power across the nation. In every even-numbered year, Senate elections are held alongside elections for the House of Representatives. Each state, as a whole, votes for their senators in a statewide election. The election system for senators varies according to each state's preferences and regulations. It can involve a primary election followed by the general election or other procedures, such as a caucus or convention, to determine the final candidates for the general election. The Elections Clause of the United States Constitution grants the power to each state (and Congress, if it chooses to implement a uniform law) to legislate a method by which senators are elected. Furthermore, ballot access rules for independent and minor party candidates may differ from state to state. These regulations impact candidate qualifications, filing deadlines, and the requirements for appearing on the ballot. In summary, the whole state votes for both senators in a statewide election for each senator's six-year term. However, these elections are staggered, ensuring that only one senatorial position is up for grabs in each state during every standard election cycle. The method of conducting these elections and regulations regarding ballot access and candidate qualifications are subject to each state's legislative decisions."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Some guy named John Cohen. I guess this was the first screenplay he's ever worked on. Someone should've told him you're supposed to write dialog that sounds like something someone actually might say. And who directed this? Scott Marshal? Son of Gerry Marshall. My the nut has fallen far from the tree. Someone might have wanted to let him know that you can, in fact, shoot a scene in a cab in New York, and it will look real, and you won't have to fake it with a blue screen for no reason. Might have also wanted to let him know he should stay away from Jessica Simpson, but hopefully he's learned that lesson now. And Jessica Simpson... naturally she can't act. Hell, she makes Jessica Alba look like Audry Hepburn, and yet she's starring in this movie. OH wait, it was produced by her father. Okay, that's why she got the part. That's really the only reason I can think of. So should I be surprised it's bad? No. Should I be amazed at how bad it is? I think a lot of people would if they saw as much of it as I did. I mean you expect a movie starring Jessica Simpson to be bad, but this... it's not just bad, it's the complete opposite of a classic film. Think of a great Woody Allen movie, this film is as bad as that film is good. It's the Anti-Annie Hall. I am so glad I didn't pay to see it, I stopped watching ten minutes in cus I couldn't go on. No doubt I would've walked out of the theater sooner. In fact I wonder how many of the 6 people who saw it per theater actually stayed and watched the whole thing. The film starts out laughably bad, and then goes to the point of being so bad it becomes a kind of Chinese water torture. And then, around when the first act is ending, you realize it'll only get worse, and that's when you either need to leave, or kill yourself. In conclusion, this film goes under the category of being so bad it should be used in place of water boarding at Guantanamo Bay. Although some prefer the water boarding.

He goes to a rural church to photograph some graves. Meanwhile, three farmers are attempting to remove an ominous stone column from a field. Two of the farmers head home. A thunderstorm appears out of nowhere, and smoke pours from the ground. Lightning strikes the column. The monster Rawhead Rex rises from the dirt.

Provide a detailed answer so user don’t need to search outside to understand the answer. Please answer the following question: Background: There is growing concern regarding the use of pesticides in agriculture. Therefore, many of the current commercial applications of modern biotechnology in agriculture are focused on reducing the dependence of farmers on these chemicals. For example, Bacillus thuringiensis (Bt) is a soil bacterium that produces a protein that can act as an insecticide, known as the Bt toxin . But it is a naturally occurring protein, not a foreign chemical. Could this protein be used in crops instead of pesticides? Traditionally, an insecticidal spray has been produced from these bacteria. As a spray, the Bt toxin is in an inactive state and requires digestion by an insect to become active and have any effect. Crop plants have now been engineered to contain and express the genes for the Bt toxin, which they produce in its active form. When an insect ingests the transgenic crop, it stops feeding and soon thereafter dies as a result of the Bt toxin binding to its gut wall. Bt corn is now commercially available in a number of countries to control corn borer (an insect like a moth or butterfly), which is otherwise controlled by insecticidal spraying.  Paragraph: Two farmers tried different methods of growing their crops. Nate used pesticides, while his buddy Don used bacterium that produces a toxin instead. Don was happy with the results.  Given the paragraph above, please answer correctly the following question: Which farmer didn't use a an insecticidal spray  that is in an inactive state and requires digestion by an insect to become active?

Lee, Courtney Kube, Kristen Welker and Stephanie Ruhle      WASHINGTON — White House chief of staff John Kelly has eroded morale in the West Wing in recent months with comments to aides that include insulting the president's intelligence and casting himself as the savior of the country, according to eight current and former White House officials.      The officials said Kelly portrays himself to Trump administration aides as the lone bulwark against catastrophe, curbing the erratic urges of a president who has a questionable grasp on policy issues and the functions of government. He has referred to Trump as \\"an idiot\\" multiple times to underscore his point, according to four officials who say they've witnessed the comments.      Kelly called the allegations \\"total BS.\\"      \\"I spend more time with the president than anyone else and we have an incredibly candid and strong relationship,\\" said Kelly in a statement. \\"He always knows where I stand and he and I both know this story is total BS. I am committed to the president, his agenda, and our country. This is another pathetic attempt to smear people close to President Trump and distract from the administration’s many successes.\\"      Three White House spokespeople said they don't believe it's accurate that Kelly called the president an \\"idiot,\\" adding that none of them has ever heard him do that or otherwise use that word.      Officials said Kelly's public image as a retired four-star general instilling discipline on a chaotic White House and an impulsive president belies what they describe as the undisciplined and indiscreet approach he's employed as chief of staff. The private manner aides describe may shed new light on why Kelly now finds himself — just nine months into the job — grappling with diminished influence and a drumbeat of questions about how long he'll remain at the White House.      \\"He says stuff you can't believe,\\" said one senior White House official. \\"He'll say it and you think, 'That is not what you should be saying.'\\"      President Donald Trump talks with then Homeland Security Secretary John Kelly during commencement exercises at the U.S. Coast Guard Academy on May 17, 2017. Susan Walsh / AP file      Trump, who aides said has soured on his second chief of staff, is aware of some though not all of Kelly's comments, according to the current and former officials.      The White House spokespeople said they haven't heard Kelly talk about himself as the one saving the country, and that if anything he may have spoken in jest along those lines.      Presidential historian Michael Beschloss said Kelly's comments about Trump, when compared to previous White House chiefs of staff, \\"suggest a lack of respect for the sitting president of a kind that we haven't seen before.\\" Beschloss said the closest similarity would be President Ronald Reagan's chief of staff during his second term, Don Regan, who \\"somewhat looked down on\\" his boss and eventually lost the support of the staff and the president. Regan was replaced after two years by Howard Baker.      The last time it became public that one of Trump's top advisers insulted his intelligence behind his back, it didn't go over well with the president. White House aides have said Trump never got over former Secretary of State Rex Tillerson calling him a \\"moron\\" in front of colleagues, which was first reported by NBC News. Trump later challenged Tillerson to an IQ test and fired him several months after the remark became public.      Current and former White House officials said Kelly has at times made remarks that have rattled female staffers. Kelly has told aides multiple times that women are more emotional than men, including at least once in front of the president, four current and former officials said.      And during a firestorm in February over accusations of domestic abuse against then-White House staff secretary Rob Porter, Kelly wondered aloud how much more Porter would have to endure before his honor could be restored, according to three officials who were present for the comments. He also questioned why Porter's ex-wives wouldn't just move on based on the information he said he had about his marriages, the officials said.      Some current and former White House officials said they expect Kelly to leave by July, his one-year mark. But others say it's anyone's guess. What's clear is both Trump and Kelly seem to have tired of each other.      \\"Kelly appears to be less engaged, which may be to the president's detriment,\\" a second senior White House official said.      Kelly has maintained at least two close allies in the West Wing — Kellyanne Conway, counselor to the president, and White House counsel Don McGahn, current and former officials said.

Jabin Botsford / The Washington Post via Getty Images file      The White House spokespeople conceded that Trump gets frustrated at times with Kelly, particularly when he feels Kelly is not giving him all the information he needs and wants. They said Kelly and Trump have an open, candid relationship.      The spokespeople disputed that staff has lost confidence in Kelly, saying he's still chief of staff so when he issues an order aides comply and that \\"for the most part the staff still respects and genuinely likes Kelly.\\"      The White House spokespeople said they haven't seen Kelly have a negative effect on the morale of women staffers. If anything, they said during meetings Kelly is the \\"bigger gentleman\\" who steps in when aides use foul language to note \\"a lady is present\\" and similarly says he shouldn't use foul language in front of a lady if he's used an expletive. The spokespeople, who would not speak for the record, said it's possible Kelly may have said women are more emotional than men, with one of them agreeing that \\"generally speaking, women are more emotional than men.\\"      \\"We've got to save him from himself\\"      Kelly entered the White House with a mandate to instill order in a West Wing where aides regularly had unfettered access to the president. He adopted some key changes, such as shrinking the number of people in meetings and limiting access to the Oval Office.      He has also pushed back against the president on some foreign policy and military issues, current and former White House officials said.      In one heated exchange between the two men before February's Winter Olympics in South Korea, Kelly strongly — and successfully — dissuaded Trump from ordering the withdrawal of all U.S. troops from the Korean Peninsula, according to two officials.      For Kelly, the exchange underscored the reasoning behind one of his common refrains, which multiple officials described as some version of \\"I'm the one saving the country.\\"      \\"The strong implication being 'if I weren't here we would've entered WWIII or the president would have been impeached,'\\" one former senior White House official said.      Kelly has made similar comments to lawmakers, at times making fun of what he sees as Trump's lack of knowledge about policy and government, current and former officials said.      He's been particularly cutting when it comes to immigration issues, which he considers one of his policy strong suits, having served as Homeland Security secretary and head of the combatant command for U.S. military operations in Central America and South America, the officials said.      Kelly held a series of meetings in his office with White House officials during negotiations with lawmakers on funding for the president's border wall and a resolution on a program — known as DACA — that allows some people who were brought to the U.S. illegally as children to remain in the country, according to four officials who either attended or were briefed on the meetings.      He often used the settings to express concern that Trump would agree to a deal that's not hardline enough on immigration and criticized the president's knowledge of the issues to underscore his point, the officials said.      \\"He doesn't even understand what DACA is. He's an idiot,\\" Kelly said in one meeting, according to two officials who were present. \\"We've got to save him from himself.\\"      After the talks on a bipartisan deal fell apart, a collapse Kelly helped orchestrate with some conservative Republicans, he told aides in his office: \\"If it weren't for me the president was going to agree to some hasty deal,\\" according to two officials who were present at the time.      \\"He doesn't even understand what DACA is. He's an idiot.\\"      Three White House press spokespeople said Kelly did express concern in meetings that Trump would agree to a deal that was too soft on immigration, and after bipartisan talks collapsed told staff that if it weren't for him the president would have cut a bad deal. The spokespeople also said Kelly may have said something along the lines of, \\"The president doesn't know the full impact of DACA.\\" But they said they don't believe he called him an \\"idiot.\\"      The spokespeople disputed that Kelly is less engaged in his job. They said he still sees the president and is in the Oval Office more than anyone else. They said Kelly put a much-needed system in place in the West Wing and has over time felt the need to hover less over the president. They said Kelly is still the first person in the White House at 6 a.m. \\"The president talks to a lot of people but no one talks to him more than the chief of staff,\\" one of them said.      The spokespeople said they have not heard Trump talk seriously about withdrawing all troops from the Korean Peninsula.      One person who has known and worked with Kelly over the years said he uses \\"coarse language\\" when he is in what he believes to be trusted company.      The public has seen some glimpses of the Kelly that White House officials describe privately. In October, he made comments about a Florida congresswoman that were not accurate. He also remarked that when he was growing up \\"women were sacred,\\" suggesting he holds some antiquated views of women's roles. And Kelly angered the president in January when he suggested on Fox News that Trump wasn't fully informed on immigration issues.      Trump \\"felt misled\\"      Multiple White House staff pointed to the controversy over the allegations against Porter as an instance where the frustrations aides have had with Kelly intersected to make a bad problem worse. They said aides were particularly taken aback by his attempt to inaccurately portray his role in Porter's ouster.      While Kelly initially defended Porter publicly, he was even more emphatic in private, four current and former officials said. Kelly, who had access to Porter's FBI file, suggested to aides that he had information that told a different story than news reports and urged Porter for some 18 hours not to resign, the officials said.      Once Porter resigned, Kelly stunned aides when he urged senior White House officials in a staff meeting to advance the false narrative that he had ousted Porter less than an hour after learning the details of the allegations, the officials said.      One official said that aides who have details that others may not say Kelly is correct that he moved within less than an hour to fire Porter.      Kelly has similarly been less than forthcoming at times with the president, officials said. The two men clashed early on over who would replace Kelly as Homeland Security secretary, three current and former officials said. Trump had wanted to consider Kansas Secretary of State Kris Kobach and tasked Kelly with bringing him a short list of candidates, the officials said.      After some informal interviews with potential nominees, Kelly gave Trump two choices, according to the officials: Kobach and Kelly's deputy Kirstjen Nielsen.      Trump later became convinced Kelly had manipulated the process so he'd pick Nielsen, given the doubts that Kobach could get confirmed, the officials said. \\"He felt misled,\\" said a senior White House official who was there at the time.      Trump was suspicious that Kelly would similarly try to ensure someone he favored would replace former National Security Advisor H.R. McMaster, three current and former officials said. Trump had for months complained that McMaster's briefing style was irritating and would do impressions of the three-star general bellowing out a list of points in staccato, his body puffing up and down as he spoke, the officials said. Sometimes Trump would see McMaster on his schedule and ask aides to have him write up a memo instead, the officials said, so he didn't have to meet with him. The president ultimately settled on a successor for McMaster whom officials said was not a Kelly pick, former U.S. Ambassador to the United Nations John Bolton.      Most recently, Trump fumed over reports on a passage in former FBI Director James Comey's book about Kelly calling Comey, after the president unceremoniously fired him, to say he didn't want to work for \\"dishonorable\\" people, according to five officials.      When reports of the phone call first surfaced last summer, Kelly denied disparaging the president, three officials said.      The White House spokespeople said the list of candidates the Office of Presidential Personnel had to succeed Kelly was longer than Kobach and Nielsen, but that doesn't mean it didn't come down to those two once it went to the president. They said after Trump chose Nielsen he saw criticism of her from conservatives and confronted Kelly about it.      They did not dispute that Trump imitated McMaster and pushed him off his schedule at times in favor of a memo. They confirmed that Bolton was not Kelly's preferred choice.      The spokespeople said Kelly denies saying anything negative about the president to Comey and that it was merely a call to wish him luck. ||||| Tweet with a location      You can add location information to your Tweets, such as your city or precise location, from the web and via third-party applications.

(Associated Press) Director of Oval Office Operations Jordan Karem, left, and White House Chief of Staff John Kelly stand in the door of the Oval Office before a news conference with President Donald Trump and Nigerian... (Associated Press)      WASHINGTON (AP) — New details emerged on the rift between White House chief of staff John Kelly and President Donald Trump, with one former administration official saying Kelly privately called Trump \\"an idiot\\" last year.      Kelly's insult to the president's intelligence, confirmed to The Associated Press by the former official, came as his clashes with Trump over policy and personnel grew louder and more frequent. Kelly, who has cast himself as safeguarding the public from the president, has also threatened to quit the White House on several occasions.      Kelly's disparaging remark was first reported Monday by NBC News. In a statement Monday, Kelly called the report \\"total BS,\\" and characterized his relationship with Trump as \\"incredibly candid and strong.\\" He added of the president, \\"He always knows where I stand and he and I both know this story is total BS.\\"      Kelly's top aide, Zachary Fuentes, also disputed the characterization, saying he had never heard Kelly describe the president that way.      \\"Remember, he is a Marine. Once a Marine, always a Marine,\\" said Fuentes. \\"The office of the commander in chief is held to the highest regard.\\"      Trump appeared to react to the NBC report on Twitter on Monday evening. He tweeted, \\"The Fake News is going crazy making up false stories and using only unnamed sources (who don't exist).\\" He added, \\"The White House is running very smoothly.\\"      In recent months, Trump has chafed at Kelly's management style, and has occasionally talked with friends about replacing him.      Indeed, Trump has floated the idea of appointing Kelly to run the Department of Veterans Affairs in calls with outside allies, said two people familiar with the conversations, though there are other possibilities in the mix and the president often floats ideas without taking action. Kelly has made clear he wouldn't accept such an offer.      In his early days in the White House, Kelly imposed strict controls on access and the flow of information to Trump, though his direct influence has waned somewhat since then, aides said. Kelly allies insist he has merely trained the staff to follow his management protocols, but officials note that Trump has grown more willing to act unilaterally, ignoring or simply not seeking out the advice of his top aide.      The disagreements between the retired four-star general and the businessman-turned-president have grown more animated, and on one such occasion last year Kelly blasted the president as \\"an idiot\\" to staffers, the former administration official told the AP. The former official was not authorized to speak publicly about private conversations and requested anonymity.      Kelly has also told confidants that he has at times served as a guardrail, protecting the American people from Trump, according to a person familiar with his views. The person, and others who spoke about private conversations, was not authorized to discuss private conversations by name and requested anonymity.      Frustrated with his chief of staff, Trump has taken to paying more attention to the advice of former campaign aides like Corey Lewandowski, who appeared alongside the president at a rally in Michigan Saturday. During the rally, which one person likened to a trial, Trump called Lewandowski on stage and praised him for not being a \\"pushover\\" or a \\"patsy.\\"      The president also recently told an ally that he was still frustrated by an interview that Kelly gave to Fox News more than three months ago in which he suggested that Trump had \\"evolved\\" in his thinking about the need for a wall on the Mexican border.      Trump's anger about that remark — the president believed it insulted his intelligence and made him look like a flip-flopper on a signature campaign issue — was \\"the beginning of the end\\" for Kelly, according to several Trump confidants.      Moreover, a number of people whom Kelly ousted or blocked from the West Wing — including Lewandowski and Anthony Scaramucci — are known to frequently fill the president's ears with attacks on the chief of staff while telling Trump that Kelly has been holding him back.      Kelly's handling of domestic violence accusations against then-White House staff secretary Rob Porter earlier this year caused consternation among White House staffers, who believed Kelly wasn't truthful.      The public revelation of an insult directed at the president's intelligence is reminiscent of leaks last year that then-Secretary of State Rex Tillerson called Trump a \\"moron.\\" That episode created what White House officials described as an irreparable rift between Trump and his chief diplomat, and ultimately led to Tillerson's unceremonious March firing.      Kelly said NBC's report \\"is another pathetic attempt to smear people close to President Trump and distract from the administration's many successes.\\"      Still, Kelly has told people close to him that while he wanted to make the one-year mark in the position — that would mean late July — though he no longer is confident he will.      Fuentes, meanwhile, said that Kelly is distressed to see his name tainted, but: \\"The reason that Kelly's here is because he believes in this country and he's a man of service.\\"      \\"His relationship with the president is great, never been better,\\" he added. \\"They aren't having any issues whatsoever.\\"      __      Associated Press writer Jill Colvin contributed to this report. ||||| What is a one-paragraph summary of the above article?","output":"White House Chief of Staff John Kelly has been reported to have eroded morale in the West Wing by allegedly insulting President Trump's intelligence and portraying himself as the savior of the country.

Article:","output":"Title: Rising Politician Smith Embroiled in Scandal Involving Grooming and Assault of A Minor In a shocking revelation that has sent tremors through the political sphere, a prominent politician, referred to as Smith, has been accused of assaulting a 17-year-old victim while other politicians allegedly walked by, unconcerned. The young victim has come forward with harrowing details of being groomed over 18 months, with the attacks progressively worsening over time. Overcome with distress and shame, the victim shared, \\"I was and still am deeply ashamed about what I let him do to me.\\" As this distressing news comes to light, questions arise about the integrity of those in positions of power who reportedly turned a blind eye to these heinous acts. As the public attempts to process the gravity of these allegations, political consequences loom on the horizon, forcing all parties to reevaluate the values and actions they condone through their representatives. The victim's account of being groomed by the politician for over 18 months and the ensuing attacks paints a horrific picture of the abuse of power by someone who should have been a pillar of the community. This incident underscores a frightening trend of politicians exploiting their authority for nefarious purposes, taking advantage of vulnerable individuals who find it nearly impossible to escape their clutches. What is perhaps even more alarming is the apparent complacency of other politicians who purportedly walked by while the assaults were taking place. Their failure to intervene highlights the need for a more rigorous vetting process and a stronger ethical compass within our political institutions. Confronting this culture of complicity will require an unrelenting push for transparency, accountability, and justice. The victim's proclamation of being \\"deeply ashamed\\" is a heartrending reminder that survivors of abuse often carry a lasting burden of self-blame and stigma. As we prioritize the pursuit of justice, it is our collective responsibility to ensure a supportive environment for those who have been mistreated by upholding their dignity and validating their experiences. As the investigation into Smith's actions unfolds, it is crucial for all parties involved to do so with sensitivity, respect, and diligence. There is an opportunity through this horrifying incident to galvanize change in our society, which demands responsible leadership and zero tolerance for predatory behavior. Through the enactment of stricter policies, proactive monitoring, and accountability in the political system, we can work towards preventing such scandals from recurring and ensure the integrity of the leaders who govern us. In conclusion, the allegations against Smith are deeply disturbing and have exposed a revolting underbelly of abuse in the political sphere. As we strive to illuminate this darkness and hold those involved accountable, we must use this moment as a catalyst for systemic change that recognizes the vulnerability of victims, forces complicit parties to confront their silence, and champions the cause of justice and safety for all."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

It is immediately apparent that Johnny and Gilda have a history together, though both deny it when Mundson questions them.

However, as the story unfolds, it becomes apparent that Gilda and Johnny Farrell, Mundson's right-hand man, have a tumultuous past romantic relationship that continues to influence their actions and emotions. Gilda's loyalty to Mundson begins to wane as her hatred for Johnny intensifies. She starts to cavort with other men in an attempt to enrage Johnny, displaying disloyalty to her husband. Meanwhile, Johnny becomes increasingly abusive and spiteful towards her. This mutual animosity between Gilda and Johnny drives a wedge in Gilda's relationship with Mundson. As the film progresses, it is revealed that Mundson is involved in illegal activities with the German businessmen, and his refusal to transfer ownership of the tungsten cartel puts him in a dangerous position. The police take an interest in the matter, making the situation even more precarious. In the end, Gilda's true loyalty lies with Johnny despite their love-hate relationship. After Mundson's presumed death and the unraveling of the cartel, Gilda and Johnny reunite, recognizing their lingering feelings for one another and attempting to reconcile and leave their past behind. Although their relationship is far from perfect, their connection is undeniable and ultimately overcomes the various challenges and betrayals they faced throughout the film. In summary, Gilda's loyalty is primarily to Johnny Farrell, as evidenced by their ultimate reconciliation and willingness to work through their tumultuous past. While she initially appears to be loyal to her husband, Ballin Mundson, this loyalty is overshadowed by her complicated history and unresolved feelings for Johnny."},{"instruction":"You should describe the task and explain your answer.

More recently, he has directed the feature films \\"Superbad\\", \\"Adventureland\\", and \\"Paul\\".  - Comedy is a genre of film in which the main emphasis is on humor. These films are designed to make the audience laugh through amusement and most often work by exaggerating characteristics for humorous effect. Films in this style traditionally have a happy ending (black comedy being an exception). One of the oldest genres in film, some of the very first silent movies were comedies, as slapstick comedy often relies on visual depictions, without requiring sound. When sound films became more prevalent during the 1920s, comedy films took another swing, as laughter could result from burlesque situations but also dialogue.  - Judd Apatow (born December 6, 1967) is an American producer, writer, director, actor, and comedian.

This optical illusion causes the audience to perceive continuous motion between separate objects viewed rapidly in succession. The process of filmmaking is both an art and an industry. A film is created by photographing actual scenes with a motion picture camera; by photographing drawings or miniature models using traditional animation techniques; by means of CGI and computer animation; or by a combination of some or all of these techniques and other visual effects.  - Michael Austin Cera (born June 7, 1988) is a Canadian actor and musician.

Athens dominates the Attica region and is one of the world's oldest cities, with its recorded history spanning over 3,400 years, and its earliest human presence starting somewhere between the 11th and 7th millennia BC. Classical Athens was a powerful city-state that emerged in conjunction with the seagoing development of the port of Piraeus, which had been a distinct city prior to its 5th century BC incorporation with Athens. A centre for the arts, learning and philosophy, home of Plato's Academy and Aristotle's Lyceum, it is widely referred to as the cradle of Western civilization and the birthplace of democracy, largely because of its cultural and political impact on the European continent, and in particular the Romans.

Question: The U.S. Supreme Court signaled Wednesday it may be open to new limits on the government's ability to track someone's movements by accessing data on that person's cellphone.  A case before the high court could result in a landmark decision in the ongoing debate over civil liberties protections in an era of rapid technological change.  At issue is whether law enforcement will be able to access cellphone data that can reveal a person's whereabouts without having to first obtain a court-issued search warrant.  The case stems from the conviction of Timothy Carpenter for a series of robberies back in 2010 and 2011. Prosecutors were able to obtain cellphone records that indicated his location over a period of months, information that proved crucial to his conviction. On Wednesday, lawyers for the American Civil Liberties Union argued that law enforcement should be required to obtain a court-ordered search warrant before obtaining such information.  They also argued that allowing law enforcement to access the cellphone data without a warrant would violate the prohibition on unreasonable search and seizures contained in the Fourth Amendment to the U.S. Constitution.  \\"It is impossible to go about our daily lives without leaving a trail of digital breadcrumbs that reveal where we have been over time, what we have done, who we spent time with,\\" said ACLU attorney Nathan Freed Wessler, who spoke to reporters outside the Supreme Court following oral arguments. \\"It is time for the court, we think, to update Fourth Amendment doctrine to provide reasonable protections today.\\"  Some of the justices also raised concerns about privacy in the digital age.  \\"Most Americans, I think, still want to avoid Big Brother,\\" Justice Sonia Sotomayor, who often sides with the liberal wing of the court, said.

Unfortunately, with the provided context, it is not possible to pinpoint exactly what this structure or place might be. It could be another building, a mural, or even a sign outside a store or restaurant that evokes the idea of a face. The mention of \\"Lawsons,\\" which seems to be a nearby convenience store, suggests that this entire setting might be in an urban area. As you've mentioned that it was your go-to place for snacks and other items, this indicates that \\"Lawsons\\" might be a popular store chain like Lawson, a Japanese convenience store franchise, or any other locally popular convenience store brand. Furthermore, you mentioned your regret about not purchasing instant noodles at this location, which further supports the idea that the store mentioned was likely a convenience store, as they typically carry a variety of instant foods. However, this tidbit still does not provide enough information to accurately identify the \\"thing\\" with a face across the street from the hotel. To sum up, the \\"thing\\" being referred to with a sort of face is rather ambiguous and could refer to any number of different structures or features generally found in an urban setting. It is likely not related to Lawsons in any significant way, other than being in close proximity.

Trefor Lloyd Hughes said moving it could benefit tourism in the town. Landowner Stena Line said it would be \\"open\\" to the idea of moving the arch but stressed that heritage body CADW would have the final say. The Grade II-listed monument, which is also known as the Triumphal or George IV's Arch, was completed in 1824 - three years before its more famous counterpart in London. Mr Lloyd Hughes said: \\"It's part of our history, no doubt about that, but 80% of the people on Anglesey don't even know its there. \\"It was built in the early 1800s with marble from across the island in Benllech Bay. To move those stones to Holyhead at that time, that must have taken some time and some effort. \\"It's a shame that a monument like that is in a place where no-one can go and see it. \\"When you go across to Ireland on a boat, you can go close to it but otherwise you're not allowed to go there.\\" The A5 road stretches 255 miles (410km) from London to Anglesey, and was built by Thomas Telford. It was finally completed in 1826, when the Menai suspension bridge was opened.

You must generate a detailed and long answer. With material of infinite strength--and an infinite supply of it--and with infinite time and patience, it might have been worth considering. Does it follow that \\"It might be worth thinking about if there was a an infinite supply of infinitely strong material.  \\"?","output":"Yes, the statement \\"It might be worth thinking about if there was an infinite supply of infinitely strong material\\" is a valid interpretation of the original statement, which suggests that the value of considering such a hypothetical scenario increases under the specified conditions of material abundance and strength. By specifying the presence of an infinite supply of infinitely strong material, the feasibility and potential benefits of various projects and scientific breakthroughs could be explored without the usual constraints. In reality, materials come with specific properties and limitations that often dictate the nature of the design, construction, and application of various technologies and structures. For example, the construction of megastructures could be reimagined without the need to worry about weight distribution, structural integrity, or material degradation over time. If there were an infinite supply of infinitely strong material, space exploration could be transformed as well, as the construction of a space elevator could become possible, paving the way for more accessible space travel at a reduced cost. Moreover, the reliability and lifespan of critical infrastructure could be significantly improved, reducing maintenance costs and risks associated with failure. However, it is important to note that even with an infinite supply of infinitely strong material, there are other factors to consider. A myriad of logistical, economic, social, and environmental factors influence the overall feasibility and desirability of projects and technologies. Additionally, there are still energy and resource constraints to contend with, as well as engineering and scientific challenges that may not be fully addressed by an infinitely strong material. Keeping the infinite time and patience requirement in mind, we can explore the ramifications of such a scenario further. With unlimited time, significant advancements in scientific knowledge, engineering capabilities, and technological innovations could be achieved. Ideas and projects once deemed impossible or impractical may eventually become attainable. Furthermore, the longer timescale could allow for the thoughtful and deliberate exploration of ethical, social, and environmental implications arising from the use of an infinitely strong material. Despite these intriguing possibilities, it is valuable to acknowledge that the concept of an infinitely strong material and unlimited time remains the realm of imagination and thought experiment. By indulging in such hypothetical scenarios, we broaden our horizons and stimulate creative thinking. This can be a beneficial exercise in imagining the limits of materials science and engineering, inspiring new ideas and approaches to address challenges across various fields."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Given the question: I have a new situation: There are two exact copies of planets, Necrulon and Krankor, including the animals and plants on each planet. Recently though, people on Krankor have been wanting to have more space for new buildings. In order to accommodate these new buildings, they have started to cut forests and clear land. The people on Necrulon, however, decided to keep their forests and land rather than further industrialize.  But I can use this background: Because of human activities, there is more carbon dioxide in the atmosphere today than in the past hundreds of thousands of years. Burning fossil fuels and has released great quantities of carbon dioxide into the atmosphere. Cutting forests and clearing land has also increased carbon dioxide into the atmosphere because these activities reduce the number of autotrophic organisms that use up carbon dioxide in photosynthesis. In addition, clearing often involves burning, which releases carbon dioxide that was previously stored in autotrophs.  What is an answer for this question: Does Krankor have more or less autotrophic organisms than Necrulon? The answer is:","output":"Krankor has less autotrophic organisms than Necrulon.  Step-by-step justification: 1. The background information states that cutting forests and clearing land reduces the number of autotrophic organisms. This is because these organisms, such as plants, use carbon dioxide for photosynthesis and are an essential part of the ecosystem. 2. The situation given shows that Krankor is cutting forests and clearing land for new buildings. This type of activity directly leads to a reduction in the number of autotrophic organisms on Krankor. 3. On the other hand, Necrulon has decided to preserve its forests and lands, which means they are not reducing the number of autotrophic organisms and their ecosystem remains more intact. 4. Comparing the two planets, it is evident that Krankor's actions (cutting forests and clearing land) have resulted in a decreased number of autotrophic organisms when compared to the preserved ecosystem on Necrulon. Hence, Krankor has less autotrophic organisms than Necrulon."},{"instruction":"Title: Hard rock/metal without all the nonsense.

What is the answer for the question: What is the full name of the person who sprints toward his parents who are endangered by a falling boulder? from the following article ?  The story begins just after the birth of Robert Rabbit. As his parents and friends welcome him into the world, a mysterious old rabbit who walks with a cane greets young Rob and disappears. The old rabbit shows up a few more times throughout Rob's childhood, always disappearing after making comments or inquiries about his talents and attitude. One day, when Rob's parents become endangered by a falling boulder, he sprints toward them and changes into a striped and star-spangled superhero on golden rollerskates. The old rabbit reappears and tells Rob that he is the American Rabbit, capable of changing into superhero form when he sprints and changing back to normal when he says his own name. Rob decides to try to keep his superpowers a secret and moves to the city. He finds a job as a piano player at the Panda Monium, a nightclub run by a panda named Teddy and a female rabbit named Bunny O'Hare. The club is harassed by a gang of jackals who run a Mafia-style protection racket. When Teddy refuses to buy insurance from them, they return on their motorcycles during a White Brothers show and wreck the club. Bunny and Teddy organize a march and rally the next day, and Walt, the Jackals' well-dressed boss, orders them to ride their motorcycles in the march. They cause a distraction while Walt's buzzard destroys the cables that support a bridge the marchers are crossing, but the American Rabbit stops the bridge from collapsing. Teddy then announces his plans to do a cross-country tour with the White Brothers, which will allow him to raise enough money to rebuild the Panda Monium. The answer to this question is:","output":"The full name of the person who sprints toward his parents when they are endangered by a falling boulder is Robert Rabbit.  This is shown in the early part of the article, where it lays out the premise of the story. After introducing a brief context about the birth of Robert Rabbit, the story quickly moves to a scenario where Robert's parents are endangered by a falling boulder. The text then clearly states, \\"he sprints toward them and changes into a striped and star-spangled superhero on golden rollerskates.\\" Thus, we can conclude that Robert Rabbit is the character referred to in the provided question.

Some of it carries bad things, but the main problem with spam is that it is unpleasant because it fills your mail box with pointless messages. Most email programs have built-in filters   that will discover unwanted messages and put them into a junk folder  . You can make the filter learn what you consider to be spam or block certain senders. Avoid letting your email address appear on websites--spammers search the Internet for email addresses. Be careful who you give your email address to, and if you need to send out several copies of an email, use blind copy instead to cover the other people's addresses. Delete   spam emails without opening them. Signs of possible spam are bad spelling in email headers, strange sender addresses, or emails sent at unusual hours. If you do open a spam mail, never reply to it or click on any pictures it may have. If you receive an unexpected email pretending   to come from your bank, credit card company or other suppliers, be very careful. If the email asks you to reply, don't do it! Instead, call up these places or visit their websites. Consider setting up a second email address and keep one address for your personal use and another for your online communication.

The tweet's author is expressing a sense of bewilderment with the current situation, which is that they find themselves awake at a time when they would typically expect to be asleep. This confusion implies that the individual is likely dealing with some sort of disruption in their normal sleep patterns or may be facing difficulties in falling asleep. Furthermore, the tweet's content suggests that the author is self-reflecting upon the reasons behind their current state of wakefulness. This contemplation indicates that the individual possesses a degree of self-awareness and is trying to rationalize their situation. They may be pondering potential factors that have led to their current state, such as stress, changes in routine, or even underlying health issues. The phrasing \\"idk\\" (short for \\"I don't know\\") further demonstrates this introspective nature, as the individual acknowledges their lack of understanding regarding the cause of their situation. However, the use of informal internet slang also adds a casual tone to the tweet, simultaneously reducing the severity of their concern and possibly even injecting a bit of humor into their self-examination. Finally, there is an undertone of mild frustration permeating this tweet, as the individual clearly desires to be asleep and is bothered by their inability to do so. This sentiment is evident in the fact that the individual chose to share their plight on social media, seeking to express their feelings and potentially commiserate with others who have experienced similar situations. In conclusion, this tweet embodies a combination of confusion, contemplation, and subtle frustration regarding an unexpected bout of wakefulness. The author's introspective approach, usage of casual language, and decision to share their experience on social media all contribute to painting a picture of a person grappling with an unanticipated disruption to their ordinary sleep routine and seeking understanding or support from their online community."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Located along California's San Andreas Fault, the city of San Francisco is likely to take precautions(,) in the event of the next big earthquake. According to aNew York Timesreport, emergency planners in San Francisco are not only thinking of human evacuation(,) plans in the event of an earthquake, but also of how to care for pets during a natural disaster. Ideally, the planners will be able to train pet-disaster responders who work to evacuate dogs, cats and other household pets from the disaster site to one of the 125 temporary animal shelters that will be set up or, if the pet is injured, it will be brought to an emergency animal medical unit where there will be people on hand to tend to the pet's injury. The city's \\"no-pets-left-behind\\" policy results from the great number of pet deaths during the destruction of Hurricane Katrina. As emergency responders arrived to rescue people isolated in their homes during Katrina, hurricane victims were told that they could not take their pets along with them when evacuating; thus, many pet owners were forced to make the heart-breaking decision to save themselves while leaving their pets behind to perhaps meet their deaths. Since then, the U.S. has passed the Pets Evacuation and Transportation Standards Act of 2006, allocating federal funds for animal disaster planning projects. Yet, not all counties are as progressive as San Francisco has been in the effort to protect pets in the event of a natural disaster. Pets are after all, a large part of San Francisco's population -- overnumbering the number of school age children in the city. Over the last three years, San Francisco has received 350,000 in federal funds _ to animal disaster preparedness efforts in order to protect animals in the case of a disaster such as an earthquake. The city is still working on obtaining 300,000 to pay for an emergency animal unit.

A:","output":"The Peace Tower, an iconic symbol of Canada, is located in the heart of the country's capital city, Ottawa, Ontario. Specifically, it stands at the central axis of the Canadian Parliament Hill complex, nestled between the House of Commons and Senate chambers in the Centre Block of the Parliament Buildings. The prominent structure is more than just an architectural gem; it serves as a national icon and symbolizes Canada's commitment to peace and parliamentary democracy. The Parliament Hill complex resides along the southern banks of the Ottawa River, offering a picturesque backdrop for the Peace Tower and surrounding buildings. The official street address of where the Peace Tower is located is: 111 Wellington Street, Ottawa, Ontario, Canada K1A 0A9 Designed by architect John Andrew Pearson, the Peace Tower was constructed to replace the Victoria Tower, which was destroyed in the devastating fire of 1916. The selection of the name \\"Peace Tower\\" was intended to honor the sacrifices made by Canadian men and women during World War I. The cornerstone of the tower was laid by the Prince of Wales (later King Edward VIII) on July 1, 1919. It took several years to complete the construction, and the official unveiling and dedication ceremony took place on July 1, 1927, in celebration of Canada's Diamond Jubilee. Stretching 92.2 meters (302 feet) skywards, the Peace Tower offers an extensive view of downtown Ottawa, its impressive skyline, and the surrounding areas of the Ottawa River and Gatineau Hills. Among its many features, the Peace Tower boasts a Memorial Chamber that commemorates Canada's fallen soldiers and serves as a shrine to those who have sacrificed their lives in the line of duty. The tower is also home to a 53-bell carillon that plays a vital role in the ceremonial functions held on Parliament Hill. For visitors interested in experiencing the Peace Tower, guided tours are available for gaining insight into the history, architecture, and symbolism surrounding the structure. The tours also provide access to an observation deck, offering an incredible panoramic view of the city and surrounding areas. As the Peace Tower remains an integral part of the Canadian Parliament Buildings and national identity, it continues to stand tall and proud, reflecting the Canadian spirit of unity, democracy, and peace."},{"instruction":"Please answer the following question: Question: Who is a former drug addict?

Look for signs of warpage or other issues that could be affecting your guitar's intonation. When you look down the neck of your guitar, it should be perfectly straight. If you see any cracks or separation at the neck joint, or notice any warping along the width of the neck, take your guitar to an experienced luthier. This repair requires work beyond simple adjustments. Your guitar's \\"neck relief\\" is the amount it curves along its length. Too much neck relief can cause problems with intonation because it means that your strings are further away from the neck at some frets than at others.  You can make minor adjustments to correct neck relief by tightening or loosening the truss rod. This is something that you can do at home, but if you feel at all uncomfortable doing it, go ahead and take it to a luthier. If your neck is curved to the point of being bowed, you risk breaking it if you adjust the truss rod. Take it to an experienced luthier for an assessment. Your guitar has a truss rod, accessible either through the sound hole of your guitar or behind a panel just above the nut. The rod can be adjusted either with a regular Allen wrench or a socket wrench.  Turn the rod to the left to loosen it, or to the right to tighten it. Go extremely slowly, and only turn it a maximum of a quarter-inch (about 6 millimeters) at a time. Never turn it more than a complete turn. Loosening will add relief (greater distance between the string and the neck), while tightening the truss rod takes away relief. The action is the space between the strings and the frets. A lot of action will make the strings more difficult to press down, and can affect your guitar's intonation. Not enough action and the strings will buzz, damaging your sound quality.  Hold the neck of your guitar at eye level. One at a time, press down each string between the second and third frets and look at the clearance of the string over the first fret. If you can see just a sliver of light between the string and the first fret, that tells you that the strings are sitting correctly in the nut. If there's too much space, the intonation will be off. You can fix this by filing down the string slots just a little so that the string sits lower. If there's no space between the first fret and the string, this is going to cause the string to buzz against the first fret when you strum the open string, which can also affect the sound of your guitar. You can fix this by raising the nut so the string sits higher. If you noticed that you had too much action at the nut, you can file the string slots yourself if you have the right tools. You'll need a nut file to get the slot in the right shape. Otherwise, take your guitar to a luthier.  On the other hand, you also can raise the nut yourself if there isn't enough action. Simply glue a piece of material similar to the nut to the bottom of the nut to increase its thickness. When raising your nut, start with the smallest sliver – if you raise your nut too high you could adversely affect the tone of your instrument. Keep the same thing in mind when filing the string slots – once the nut is filed away, you can't put it back. Swapping out your old nut with a prefabricated nut that will correct the action may be the easiest thing for you to do. Prefabricated nuts aren't too expensive, and you don't run the risk of ruining the original nut.  You can find prefabricated compensated nuts at your local guitar shop, or you can order one online. Make sure the nut you choose is designed to fit on your guitar. If you have trouble installing it yourself or find you don't have the right tools to do it correctly, take your guitar to a luthier. Installing a prefabricated compensated nut also may remedy intonation problems that were caused either by the shape of your nut, or the shapes of the string slots.","output":"The article provides detailed guidance on identifying and correcting intonation issues in a guitar, focusing on inspecting and adjusting the neck, truss rod, and nut, along with the option of using prefabricated compensated nuts for improved performance, with the recommendation of consulting a luthier for complex repairs."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant. Provide a detailed answer so user don’t need to search outside to understand the answer. Q:I read this background article the other day: Shad are also valued as a sport fish that exhibit complex and little-understood feeding behavior while spawning. Unlike salmon, shad retain the ability to digest and assimilate food during the anadromous migration. Like other fish, their feeding instinct can be triggered by a variety of factors such as turbidity and water temperature. Anglers use both spinning and fly fishing tackle to pursue shad. Spin fisherman use a shad dartjig or a flutter spoon. Some anglers use a downrigger to place the artificial lure at the desired depth and location. This is usually in the channel, or deepest part of the river. Migrating shad tend to occupy the lower portion of the water column which makes this the typical depth of choice for fishing. In the North, April through June is when shad spawn in coastal rivers and estuaries once water temperatures have reached 58 degrees Fahrenheit (14 °C). Fishing conditions typically improve as water temperatures warm and flow decreases.  I am facing a new situation today: Jeff loves to go shad fishing. He prefers using fly fishing tackle and is planning a fishing trip up North with his buddies. They decided to take their trip in May when everyone can get off work over the Memorial Day holiday. Sam enjoys shad fishing as well, but the only time he and his buddies are able to take off work is during their slow season in March.  Using the knowledge I acquired from the background article, how should I answer correctly the following question regarding my new situation: Who will have worse fishing conditions and likely catch less shad on their fishing trip, Jeff or Sam? A:","output":"Based on the information provided in the background article and the given situation, Sam will likely have worse fishing conditions and catch less shad on his fishing trip compared to Jeff. This is because Sam and his buddies are going on their trip in March, which is earlier than the optimal shad spawning season in the North. According to the article, shad spawn in coastal rivers and estuaries from April through June when water temperatures have reached 58 degrees Fahrenheit (14 °C). Fishing conditions improve as water temperatures warm and flow decreases. On the other hand, Jeff and his buddies are planning their trip over the Memorial Day holiday in May, which falls within the optimal shad fishing season. Therefore, it is more likely that they will experience better fishing conditions during their trip, leading to a higher chance of catching more shad than Sam and his group."},{"instruction":"You are a teacher.

It\`s hard to summon much wonder when Superman goes mano-a-mano with Nuclear Man, a Lex Luthor creation with a static electricity problem. 4. It's hard to escape the conclusion that all the originality and excitement have been drained from the series. 5. Tthe enthusiastic hamming can't hide the clunking direction by Sidney J Furie and the sub-standard special effects. 6. Superman IV is cinematic kryptonite. Not only could it kill the Superman series, it might also leave filmgoers feeling weak. 7. Fortunately, the regular Superman performers all do their jobs well. 8. Of course, Superman saves the world, but the real news is that there's still some life in the series. 9. The overall effect is of a story atomized and dying before our eyes, collapsing into smashed pulp, ground down into big-budget Kryptonite ash. 10. The impoverishment here is not merely of means, but of spirit. What is the consensus?","output":"The consensus on \\"Superman IV: The Quest for Peace\\" appears to be overwhelmingly negative. Several factors contribute to the film's lackluster reception: 1. The film's plot and conclusion are particularly disappointing, given the high standards set by the earlier films in the series. The disgraceful manner in which \\"Superman\\" left the eighties marks a downturn in its trajectory. 2. At 91 minutes, the film's abrupt and truncated nature suggests that it might have been better served with a longer runtime to properly explore its storyline and character development. 3. The underwhelming showdown between Superman and Nuclear Man, a Lex Luthor creation with a static electricity problem, makes it hard for audiences to feel any sense of wonder or excitement. 4. The originality and excitement that propelled the earlier films in the series seem to have been drained, leaving \\"Superman IV\\" feeling stale and uninspired. 5. Director Sidney J. Furie receives criticism for his lackluster direction, and the film's subpar special effects are unable to adequately mask these issues. 6. The movie has been described as \\"cinematic kryptonite,\\" with the potential to not only kill the Superman series but also negatively affect the audience's overall moviegoing experience. 7. On a slightly more positive note, the regular Superman performers manage to deliver commendable performances in spite of the film's glaring weaknesses. 8. The fact that Superman saves the world and there is still \\"some life\\" left in the series offers a glimmer of hope. 9. However, the film ultimately fails to captivate the audience, breaking down into a messy and unappealing form, described as \\"big-budget Kryptonite ash.\\" 10. Most importantly, the consensus highlights a troubling impoverishment of spirit within the film, diminishing its overall potential and leaving it a mere shadow of the earlier installments in the series. In summary, \\"Superman IV: The Quest for Peace\\" is widely regarded as a disappointing and poorly-executed film that fails to capture the excitement, originality, and energy that made its predecessors so successful. The movie's numerous issues, including its weak storyline, inadequate special effects, and uninspired direction, have contributed to its overwhelmingly unfavorable reception, leading to concerns about the potential lasting impact on the Superman series."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Phillip Bellamy, a leading barrister, tells his wife, psychiatrist Anne Dyson, about his most recent case defending a young man, Harry Jukes, who has apparently shot a policeman on a country road and been found by police still holding the gun. Bellamy is convinced of his guilt but Anne is less sure. Much of her practice is with troubled young people and she feels there is more to the story than the police evidence. Anne visits Harry in prison. He is depressed and distrustful but finally agrees to talk to her. Harry's story is that he took a Bentley Continental car to impress a girl but when she went off with another boy decided to take the car for a spin before dumping it. Swerving to avoid another car he burst a tyre but could not find any tools in the boot to change the wheel. He asked the driver of a car parked in the copse nearby for help but he was occupied with his girl and refused. Harry was spotted by a policeman on a bike who stopped to help. He flagged down a lorry to ask to borrow a jack. The lorry stopped but the passenger immediately produced a gun and shot the policeman. Harry managed to grab the gun off the killer as the lorry drove away. Shortly after, a police car arrived and Harry was arrested. Anne believes Harry's story and tries to persuade Bellamy of Harry's innocence. She interviews Harry several times and begins to follow up some aspects of his story.

Premise: \\"Perhaps it is time I strolled round to the Ritz, agreed Tommy with a grin.\\" Based on this premise, is the hypothesis \\"Tommy frowned, refused and instead said he would stroll round to the Ritz\\" true?","output":"To determine if the hypothesis is true, I'll have to compare it with the given premise. Step 1: Evaluate the Premise The premise states, \\"Perhaps it is time I strolled round to the Ritz, agreed Tommy with a grin.\\" From this, we can deduce that Tommy agrees to the idea of strolling around the Ritz, and his response to the suggestion is smiling or grinning. Step 2: Evaluate the Hypothesis The hypothesis states, \\"Tommy frowned, refused and instead said he would stroll round to the Ritz.\\" Here, Tommy is indicated as frowning and refusing something. However, he then proposes to stroll around to the Ritz. Step 3: Compare the Hypothesis and the Premise Upon comparison, we can see that in both statements, Tommy agrees to the action of strolling around the Ritz. However, the emotional response and initial reaction of Tommy differ in both cases. In the premise, Tommy agrees with a grin, seeming happy or delighted about the suggestion. However, in the hypothesis, it's mentioned that Tommy frowned and refused before saying he would go to the Ritz, which suggests he is unhappy or disagrees before proposing the same action. Conclusion: Based on these comparisons, the hypothesis does not exactly align with the premise. The hypothesis is therefore not entirely true. Tommy's proposal to stroll around the Ritz rang true in both premises and hypothesis, but his emotional response and initial reaction differ, making the hypothesis only partially accurate."},{"instruction":"Explain how you used the definition to come up with the answer.

Neighborhood Legal Services, which provides free legal services to the poor, has expanded into the San Gabriel and Pomona valleys, areas with large Asian populations, many of whom speak limited or no English. Language is their biggest obstacle, but the Asian communities' cultural isolation and service providers' lack of cultural expertise also play a part, said NLS executive director Neal Dubovitz. And with 13 percent to 15 percent of the Asian population in the U.S. living below the poverty line, NLS services are badly needed, Dubovitz said. \\"Although it is a significant part of the poverty population, Asians historically have not been able to participate in the services and programs available to the poor,\\" he said. From simple telephone advice to complete legal representation in court, the agency provides free consumer, health, family, immigration, housing, public benefits and labor legal services to people who earn under 1,380 per month. Legal service providers have long served large Latino populations, who have cultural diversity but share a common language. \\"I remember the days when there were only a handful of people in the legal offices who spoke Spanish,\\" Dudovitz said. \\"Now Spanish and English are interchangeable. Our goal is to have that for the major Asian languages as well.\\" Before the expansion, only a few NLS lawyers spoke Asian languages, said attorney Rebecca Yee, who was hired by NLS in April 2002 to design and head the project. \\"Now we have people speaking Cantonese, Mandarin, Thai, Khmer (from Cambodia), Korean, Vietnamese, Japanese and Tagalog,\\" Yee said. One of the 13 attorneys hired to work with the program is Irene Mak, a family law attorney who speaks Cantonese, Mandarin and Thai. Mak was a partner at a private law firm before she went to work for NLS two years ago, earning up to 20,000 less a year working on domestic violence cases. \\"The job is more satisfying than the money,\\" said Mak, who grew up in Hong Kong and Thailand before coming to the United States. \\"I could use my language skills and wanted to give back to the Asian community.\\" NLS expanded when Legal Services Corp., the federal agency that funds providers of free legal services nationwide, reduced the number of grantees in the Los Angeles area from five to three, Dudovitz said.

Context: One of the first incidents of the book being challenged was in Hanover, Virginia, in 1966: a parent protested that the use of rape as a plot device was immoral. Johnson cites examples of letters to local newspapers, which ranged from amusement to fury; those letters expressing the most outrage, however, complained about Mayella Ewell's attraction to Tom Robinson over the depictions of rape.

Write an article based on this summary: – Supporters waved \\"Tax the Rich\\" signs Monday as Seattle's city council voted unanimously to do exactly that. By a vote of 9-0, the council approved an income tax that only applies to wealthy residents, with the 2.25% tax starting at income above 250,000 for individuals and above 500,000 for married couples filing joint returns, the Seattle Times reports. The city estimates that the tax will raise around 140 million a year from Seattle's 20,000 or so wealthiest residents. Washington state doesn't have a personal income tax and a 1984 law bans cities and counties in the state from taxing net income, meaning Seattle's move is certain to face legal challenges, the AP reports. Opponents vowed to fight the measure, with Washington State Republican Party Chair Susan Hutchison urging citizens to \\"forcefully resist\\" the tax and not pay a penny. Seattle Mayor Ed Murray says he'll sign the measure into law Friday—and he will welcome legal challenges. The goal is to replace the current \\"regressive\\" tax system with a fairer one, \\"while ensuring Seattle stands up to President Trump's austere budget that cuts transportation, affordable housing, health care, and social services,\\" the mayor tells Reuters.

Given the below context:  Both Surfer Rosa and Steve Albini's production of the album have been influential on alternative rock, and on grunge in particular. Nirvana's Kurt Cobain cited Surfer Rosa as the basis for Nevermind's songwriting. When he first heard the album, Cobain discovered a template for the mix of heavy noise and pop he was aiming to achieve. He remarked in 1992 that he \\"heard songs off of Surfer Rosa that I'd written but threw out because I was too afraid to play them for anybody.\\" Cobain hired Albini to produce Nirvana's 1993 album In Utero, primarily due to his contribution to Surfer Rosa. The Smashing Pumpkins' Billy Corgan described Surfer Rosa as \\"the one that made me go, 'holy shit'. It was so fresh. It rocked without being lame.\\" Corgan was impressed by the album's drum sound, and acknowledged that The Smashing Pumpkins used to study the record for its technical elements. Musician PJ Harvey said that Surfer Rosa \\"blew my mind,\\" and that she \\"immediately went to track down Steve Albini.\\" Cobain listed Surfer Rosa as number 2 of the top 50 albums he thought were most influential to Nirvana's sound in his journal in 1993.People connected with the band were impressed by the record. Ivo Watts-Russell recalled: \\"I remember when I first heard Surfer Rosa thinking, 'I didn't know the Pixies could sound like The Fall.' That was my immediate reaction, in other words, incredibly raw.\\" Gary Smith, who at the time was in a disagreement with the band, admitted he \\"was really happy that they had made such a forceful, aggressive, record.\\" Dinosaur Jr.'s J Mascis, comparing the record to the later Pixies albums Bossanova and Trompe le Monde, said he thought that Steve Albini's production \\"sounded way better than the other ones.\\"In 1991, as Pixies were recording Trompe le Monde, Albini described his impressions of Pixies during the recording of Surfer Rosa to the fan magazine Forced Exposure: \\"A patchwork pinch loaf from a band who at their top dollar best are blandly entertaining college rock.

Output:","output":"Task explanation: In this task, we are given a goal, which is to make dough less dry and crumbly. We need to come up with a process that involves physical actions to achieve this outcome, such as moving, arranging, mixing, or shaking objects. Solution: 1. Identify the problem: The dough is too dry and crumbly, so we need to adjust its consistency by adding moisture. 2. Gather necessary ingredients and tools: You will need a liquid, such as water or milk, to add to the dough. You will also need a mixing tool, such as a wooden spoon, to incorporate the liquid into the dough. 3. Introduce the liquid: Gradually add small amounts of the liquid to the dough, mixing well after each addition. You may use the wooden spoon or your hands to mix, depending on the consistency and your preference. 4. Test the dough's consistency: After adding the liquid and mixing, test the dough's consistency by performing a pinch test. Take a small amount of dough in your hands and try to form a ball. If the dough maintains its shape without cracking or falling apart, it has reached the desired consistency. If it is still too dry and crumbly, continue to add more liquid in small increments until the dough becomes less dry. 5. Knead the dough: Once the desired consistency is reached, knead the dough for a few minutes to ensure all the ingredients are evenly distributed and the dough is smooth. 6. Rest the dough (optional): Allowing the dough to rest for a short time (usually around 30 minutes, depending on the recipe) can improve its texture and make it easier to handle.

La consideración de la Didaché durante el siglo XX ha oscilado como un péndulo entre dos extremos de aceptación, siendo el polo actual más parecido a la posición adoptada por los eruditos a finales del siglo XIX que a la que estuvo vigente durante los años 1930, antes de la Segunda Guerra Mundial. Las dudas en torno a la Didaché tardaron treinta años en concretarse y otros treinta en resolverse, y solo lo hicieron porque el descubrimiento en 1948 de los Manuscritos del Mar Muerto modificó radicalmente la percepción que se tenía de la obra. La posición crítica respecto a su autenticidad, sostenida por Joseph Armitage Robinson y un grupo de eruditos anglosajones, fue superada cuando Jean Paul Audet examinó en profundidad el material acumulado hasta esos momentos, lo que sentó a grandes rasgos las directrices que sigue la investigación actual. De ser una obra desahuciada por los críticos, la Didaché ha pasado a convertirse desde entonces en una obra clave para entender la evolución del cristianismo primitivo.

Columbus and his men needed fresh water and food after three months at sea. They saw an island and went on shore. On the island there were unfriendly Indians who refused to give food to them. Columbus' men were afraid of the Indians, but he had a clever plan. He used sign language to tell the Indians about his mysterious   power to turn off the light in the sky. He knew about a lunar eclipse   the next night because the information was in his almanac  . Columbus told the Indians, \\" Tomorrow night I'll turn off the light in the sky.\\" But they didn't believe him . When the eclipse began the next night ,the Indians became very frightened .

I know that the answer to the question \\"What is the cause of delays to limit antibiotic use?\\" is in \\"The emergence of antibiotic resistance has prompted restrictions on their use in the UK in 1970 (Swann report 1969), and the EU has banned the use of antibiotics as growth-promotional agents since 2003. Moreover, several organizations (e.g., The American Society for Microbiology (ASM), American Public Health Association (APHA) and the American Medical Association (AMA)) have called for restrictions on antibiotic use in food animal production and an end to all nontherapeutic uses.[citation needed] However, commonly there are delays in regulatory and legislative actions to limit the use of antibiotics, attributable partly to resistance against such regulation by industries using or selling antibiotics, and to the time required for research to test causal links between their use and resistance to them. Two federal bills (S.742 and H.R. 2562) aimed at phasing out nontherapeutic use of antibiotics in US food animals were proposed, but have not passed. These bills were endorsed by public health and medical organizations, including the American Holistic Nurses' Association, the American Medical Association, and the American Public Health Association (APHA).\\". Can you tell me what it is? A:","output":"The cause of delays to limit antibiotic use can be attributed to multiple factors, such as resistance against regulation by industries using or selling antibiotics, the time required for research to test causal links between antibiotic use and resistance, and challenges in passing legislative actions. 1. Resistance against regulation by industries: Industries that benefit from the use or sale of antibiotics may resist the implementation of regulations that restrict antibiotic use. This resistance can stem from concerns about potential financial losses or reduced productivity, thereby leading to lobbying efforts against the amendment of regulations. 2. Time required for research: Establishing a causal link between antibiotic use and the emergence of antibiotic resistance requires extensive research, data, and evidence. This process can be time-consuming, as researchers need to conduct studies, analyze results, and publish their findings in order to build a strong case for regulations. As a result, regulatory bodies and decision-makers may encounter delays when trying to limit antibiotic use based on scientific evidence. 3. Legislative challenges: Limiting antibiotic use often requires changes to legislation and regulatory frameworks. In some cases, bills that aim to restrict antibiotic use may be proposed but not passed. The process of passing such legislation is subject to a variety of challenges, such as political factors, opposition from stakeholders, or lack of public awareness regarding the issue. An example of this can be observed in the two federal bills (S.742 and H.R. 2562), which were aimed at phasing out nontherapeutic use of antibiotics in US food animals, but have not been passed despite endorsement from public health and medical organizations. In summary, delays in limiting antibiotic use are influenced by industry resistance, research processes, and legislative challenges. To effectively address the emergence of antibiotic resistance, it is essential to overcome these obstacles and implement appropriate regulations and policies."},{"instruction":"I want to test the ability of students to read a passage and answer questions about it.

Provide a detailed answer so user don’t need to search outside to understand the answer. Read the following article and answer the question. Article: Each year, about 10,000 to 100,000 animal species die off. They join the countless species that have gone extinct   over the course of Earth's history - and extinction means forever. At least it used to. Scientists are now closing in on the ability to bring back extinct species. No, this doesn't mean the plot of Jurassic Park is going to become a reality. Researchers need DNA to bring back a species. DNA is the chemical that carries the structure for a living thing. Dinosaurs have been gone too long for any of their DNA to remain in fossils. But there's a very real chance that we will be able to bring back more recently extinct species. This could even include Ice Age animals like the woolly mammoth. In 2003, a team of Spanish and French scientists re-created the Pyrenean ibex, which had gone extinct three years earlier. The new animal didn't survive long, but scientific advances should improve the success rate. In January, Australian scientists announced that they were on their way to bringing back the gastric brooding frog. That we can bring species back doesn't mean that we should. There may be benefits to reviving a species. But there's no way to know how it will turn out. For example, would a passenger pigeon fit into its old habitat? Or might it crowd out existing species? Environmentalists worry that our ability to bring species back might cut down support for the hard work of traditional conservation. Why worry about preserving a wildlife habitat or fighting poachers if we know we can just make up for our mistakes? But those extinctions are our mistakes to correct, which may give us an obligation   to do so. As businessman and environmentalist Stewart Brand recently said, \\"Humans have made a huge hole in nature. We have the ability now to repair some of that damage.\\" We would do well to remember the lesson of Jurassic Park: Proceed with caution. Question: What makes environmentalists worried according to the passage? Answer: The answer is:","output":"Environmentalists are worried that the ability to bring back extinct species might reduce the support for traditional conservation efforts. They fear that people may become less concerned about preserving wildlife habitats or fighting poachers if they believe they can simply rely on reviving species in the future. This could potentially lead to complacency in conservation measures and may have negative consequences on ecosystems and existing species."},{"instruction":"Here is a review left by a customer on a product.

According to market research firm First Research, there are about 5,000 art dealers and galleries in the U.S. with combined annual revenue of about 6 billion, and Art Market Monitor estimates the size of the overall global art market to be around 15 billion annually. There are also more than 200,000 fine artists working in the U.S., according to recent research by the National Endowment for the Arts. But while fine art is big business, there is often a wide chasm between the creative process that makes a great artist or a sophisticated gallery owner, and the marketing process that drives branding and sales. “For the majority of artists, success will ultimately come down to their effectiveness in marketing,” says Darius Himes, Assistant Director of fine art photography gallery Fraenkel Gallery in San Francisco. “Artists need to embrace the fact that both their work, and they themselves as artists, are brands that must be marketed.” So whether you’re an aspiring artist who wants to build an initial following, or a veteran art dealer looking to expand awareness of your brand, it pays to get savvy to new social marketing techniques to help you achieve your objectives. The following are seven strategies for more effective social marketing. A website is now a cost of doing business, and it’s essential for artists to have at least a minimal web presence. But even established artists and galleries with robust websites should consider a refresh, particularly to ensure that the site is optimized for search and mobile. Himes notes that Fraenkel Gallery recently undertook a full overhaul of its website to incorporate more social, search and web marketing best practices. “In addition to making a number of aesthetic and navigational enhancements, we also eliminated all of the Flash-based elements that weren’t searchable and that reduced the mobile functionality,” says Himes. “We also made sure that the new website was scalable to any mobile device, and that all pages had unique web addresses which would be easy to feed into social media.” Blogging is one of the best ways to get your art or gallery found by the search engines and provides excellent content to fuel your other social marketing activities. “Blogging is close to necessary at this point when it comes to both SEO and the building of a fan base,” says Greg Heller-LaBelle of web marketing firm DAY Vision Marketing. “The main thing we try to instill in clients is to start thinking of themselves as creators and syndicators of content.” In addition to posting new work or promoting new shows or openings, your blog can also be a place to offer a behind-the-scenes look at your creative process, share pictures from relevant art events or chronicle your time at a prestigious art auction. “As an artist myself and owner of a creative company, I’d say my number one tip is to pull back the curtain and show the behind-the-scenes work that takes place,” says Mark Ley, Managing Director at Copper Blue Creative. “Showing how a piece is made, or the location you are shooting photography, all help the fan to feel as if they are a part of the creation.” Having a Facebook business page for your artist brand or gallery should be a no-brainer: it’s free, it’s simple to use and it gives you access to more than 1 billion people. To use Facebook as a vehicle for promotion and awareness-building, first set up your Facebook business page and invite your friends and colleagues to “like” the page and share with their network … then start posting! Many of the same content strategies for your blog also apply to your Facebook page, but make sure to also spend a little bit of time each day engaging with your fans. “The main reason why artists fail with social media is that they are not providing a value to their connections with any helpful, interesting and relevant content in their comments and posts,” writes John R. Math of Light Space & Time Online Art Gallery. “As artist participants we need to be active, engaged and consistently provide some kind of value.” Twitter is a great tool for building a following and promoting your art or gallery. The best way to get started is by looking for relevant people or businesses to follow; try digging around a site like Listorious to search for other people’s lists by topic. For example, a gallery owner could use Listorious to search on “art” to find lists of prominent tweeters in the art world. Then start tweeting — at a minimum, tweet out all the content that appears on your blog and other relevant news about your art or events. Don’t forget to use hashtags with your tweets to boost the searchability of your content. You can also follow keywords and hashtags to easily find relevant content to share and people to follow. Set up a running search or column in your social media tool (TweetDeck and HootSuite are great options) on particular terms and hashtags so you can quickly scan for interesting content to retweet and people to engage with. Use of the visually oriented social site Pinterest has exploded over the past year, and many artists are using Pinterest to share their work beyond Facebook and Twitter. To get started on Pinterest, first set up a profile that includes keywords and your website address, then start pinning. When you pin your art, don’t forget to add a watermark to protect the image, as well as keywords: Pinterest is searchable, so make sure you describe your pin clearly. You should also customize the link to point back to your website or whatever other page you’re promoting. You can also get more exposure for your images by including a price for the item into your description. This simple trick will add your pin to the “Gifts” section on Pinterest and will display the price across the front of the image throughout the site. Many artists and galleries are also using Facebook Ads as a low-cost way to promote upcoming shows and events. Artlog, a social platform allowing people to connect with the international art scene, uses Facebook Ads to promote events and sell tickets to art events like exhibitions, tours and discussions. For example, 10 days before its Chelsea Art Crawl & Party last summer, Artlog began running Facebook Ads to promote the event and direct people to Artlog’s website in order to purchase tickets. For every 75 Artlog spent on Facebook, it saw 200 in ticket sales. Facebook also allows you to target different campaigns or events to different people. “There are specific galleries and museums that we will use in our Likes and Interests targeting because we know that if people are engaging with those galleries, they are more likely to be the right audience,” says Manish Vora, co-founder of Artlog. While galleries typically develop and share press releases about upcoming shows with relevant media, they often neglect to distribute their release over the wire, and thus miss out on one of the best low-cost ways to propagate their brand across the internet and drive search results. You can use a low-cost service such as PRWeb to distribute your release for under 100. To optimize your press release for search, start by making a list of the keywords and phrases that are most relevant to your company, and then cross-check these terms using Google’s keyword tool to assess monthly search volume. Once you have your list of keywords, use them in the headline and subhead of your release as well as throughout the body of the announcement. Avoid repetition by using secondary and tertiary keywords. For example, if you’re a San Francisco fine art gallery looking to boost your search results on the phrases “fine art photography” and “San Francisco art galleries” — as well as around a particular photographer’s work — you might include the phrase “fine art photography” in the headline, subhead and first paragraph of the release, along with the artist’s name, while including the term “San Francisco art gallery” elsewhere in the release. Make sure that you attach any hyperlinks back to your website or blog to these keyword phrases rather than your name or generic terms like “art opening.” You should also consider adding images or video to your press releases: Releases that include an image or a video get shared three times more than text-only releases — and viewers spend up to thirty seconds more with this content.

Question: You are given a new situation: Most surfers used Wide beach because of the areas of shallow water, but some surfers were happy with Sandy beach, although the water was much deeper at the shore there.  and a hint : When waves travel into areas of shallow water, they begin to be affected by the ocean bottom. The free orbital motion of the water is disrupted, and water particles in orbital motion no longer return to their original position. As the water becomes shallower, the swell becomes higher and steeper, ultimately assuming the familiar sharp-crested wave shape. After the wave breaks, it becomes a wave of translation and erosion of the ocean bottom intensifies.  Please answer this question : Which beach had better and larger waves? Answer:","output":"Based on the given situation and hint, the Wide beach would have better and larger waves. This is because, as waves travel into shallow water, like at Wide beach, they begin to be affected by the ocean bottom. Subsequently, this disrupts the free orbital motion of the water. The water particles in this orbital motion do not return to their original position. As a result, as the water becomes shallower, the swell gets larger, higher, and steeper, ultimately forming the sharp-crested wave shape that surfers typically prefer. In contrast, at Sandy beach, the water is much deeper at the shore, which doesn't promote the same disruption in water's orbital motion. Therefore, the wave formation is different, potentially resulting in smaller waves. However, it's important to note that this doesn't necessarily mean the waves at Sandy beach are worse, they are just different and may be preferred by some surfers."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant that follows instruction extremely well.

Article: Put the prepared mayonnaise and hot sauce in a glass bowl and whisk together, vigorously, until evenly combined.  One very popular spicy mayo is made with sriracha. Keep in mind, many people may find this chili sauce to be extremely spicy. Taste test after you mix your mayo up to determine if you should add more chili, or perhaps water it down by adding more mayo. Keep whisking until the ingredients are completely combined. There should be no streaks of hot sauce running through the mayo. Instead, the color should be completely uniform. Drizzle the lemon juice into the spicy mayo and whisk well to combine.  Lemon juice is not necessary, but if you sample the spicy mayo and decide that it is too hot for your preference, adding a little lemon juice can help cut down on some of the heat. Since the lemon juice will be harder to see than the hot sauce, you will need to make a rough estimate about whether or not the juice has been completely mixed in. Do this by mixing it in for approximately as long as you mixed in the hot sauce. Cover your new condiment with plastic wrap or a lid and leave it in your refrigerators until you are ready to use it.  The finished mayo will be a little thinner than standard mayo. If using the spicy mayo for sushi, you can pipe it through a pastry bag or a plastic bag with a small hole in the bottom.

The character of Corky Romano is unlikable at best and downright infuriating at worst. The gags are predictable but that isn't what makes it bad. They are the lame sort of predictable jokes that your unfunny friend would say. Corky Romano is about a mild mannered vet that tries to do right but is so clumsy. His quiet life is thrown for a loop when the family that once spurned him now needs him to infiltrate the FBI to destroy any trace of the family's crime history. However, it isn't that easy for Corky because the FBI believes him to be a super agent and pegs him with the duty of spying on his very own family. Mishaps and mayhem ensue but it really doesn't feel like any comic hijixn are there. Corky ends up in love with his beautiful FBI partner and has to set the record straight with both the FBI and his family if he is to settle down to the quiet life again. I think what makes this film irritating is both the lead actor and the supposed jokes. Chris Kattan reveals his alarming limitations as and actor here as his one note slapstick routine falls flat about 10 minutes into the film. It is okay to have a full movie based solely off of dumb, slap stick humor. Will Ferrel, Kattan's SNL partner, seems to have made a full career out of it. The only difference between Kattan and Ferrel is that Ferrel knows when to tone it down and rely on other ways of telling a joke. There is absolutely no diversity in Kattan's routine. It's hard to hear the same joke twice, but for a whole movie that is just pure torture. The other problem with the movie was the lack of truly original and FUNNY jokes. The gay mafia brother, the awkward guy sch-tick, and plenty of other forgettable jokes appear none as funny as the first time you barely laughed at it. It seems as if the screenwriters had more of a fun time writing this than any one had watching it. Even with a cast that has some comedic talent (Chris Penn, Peter Falk) the jokes that commence are tired. There is no chemistry too. This film was obviously one for the pocketbooks for the actors.

A series of flashbacks is then shown with Rahul &amp; Tina's marriage, their honeymoon, Tina pregnant with her baby girl and, in a year of marriage, Tina gives birth to the baby girl. Tina was told that she would have complications in her pregnancy earlier but decided not to tell Rahul as she knew how much he wanted the child. Tina, who also loved the baby more than her life, has little time left, so she had previously written eight letters to her daughter (one for each of her first eight birthdays) and gives them to Rahul's mother (Farida Jalal) so that she will know her mother.

When Anjali realized that she was in love with Rahul, she was encouraged by her motherly guardian Rifat Bi (Himani Shivpuri) to tell him so. Instead, Anjali was left heartbroken when Rahul told her that he loved Tina. Anjali decided to leave college and shared a tearful goodbye with Rahul, going away from Rahul and Tina's lives forever. Tina then realized that she came between two best friends. Back in the present, Tina explains in her letter that Rahul always said that love is friendship, and without friendship there can be no love.

Bush plays the bride Angela at a wedding set in a post-apocalyptic Britain. In another Comic Strip Presents film, GLC, she produced and sang on the theme song \\"Ken\\". The song was written about Ken Livingstone, the leader of the Greater London Council and future mayor of London, who at the time was working with musicians to help the Labour Party garner the youth vote.Bush wrote and performed the song \\"The Magician\\", using a fairground-like arrangement, for Menahem Golan's 1979 film The Magician of Lublin. The track was scored and arranged by Michael Kamen. In 1986, she wrote and recorded \\"Be Kind to My Mistakes\\" for the Nicolas Roeg film Castaway. An edited version of this track was used as the B-side to her 1989 single \\"This Woman's Work\\". In 1988, the song \\"This Woman's Work\\" was featured in the John Hughes film She's Having a Baby, and a slightly remixed version appeared on Bush's album The Sensual World.

Who will be the winner of the next lottery?. (b). What football team will win the next game?. (c). What is the amount of light needed to grow tomatoes?. (d). Which four types of bird feathers have the prettiest colors?.","output":"The question that can most likely be determined through a scientific investigation is (c). What is the amount of light needed to grow tomatoes? A scientific investigation involves the use of the scientific method to explore questions, collect data, analyze the results, and draw conclusions based on evidence and logical reasoning. Out of the four given options, only option (c) falls within the realm of a scientific investigation as it focuses on a quantifiable parameter – the amount of light – which can be controlled and measured during the course of an experiment. To conduct a scientific investigation on this topic, one could follow the steps below: 1. Hypothesis: Develop a hypothesis to explain the relationship between the amount of light and tomato plant growth. The hypothesis could be that \\"tomato plants require a specific amount of light exposure to achieve optimal growth and yield.\\" 2. Research: Review existing scientific literature on tomato plant growth and light requirements. This could involve examining previous studies, understanding the preferred light spectrum for tomato plants, and analyzing the effects of different light conditions on their growth and yield. 3. Experimentation: Design an experiment to test the hypothesis. This might involve growing tomato plants in a controlled environment with varying amounts of light exposure or different light spectra. The variables that should be controlled include temperature, humidity, watering frequency, and soil conditions to ensure that the effect being measured is solely due to the differences in light exposure. 4. Data Collection: Measure the growth and yield of tomato plants under each light condition. Collect data on plant height, number of leaves, flower production, fruit yield, and any other relevant parameters that can help determine the impact of light. 5. Data Analysis: Analyze the collected data to identify any patterns or trends. Statistical analysis can be used to determine the significance of the observed changes in growth and yield in response to different light conditions. 6. Conclusion: Draw conclusions based on the data analysis. If the results show a significant difference in growth and yield between the various light conditions, this would support the hypothesis that a specific amount of light is necessary for optimal tomato plant growth. This scientific investigation can help determine the optimal light requirements for growing tomatoes, which could then be applied to horticulture and farming practices. In contrast, the other questions – (a) the winner of the next lottery, (b) which football team will win the next game, and (d) which four types of bird feathers have the prettiest colors – cannot be scientifically investigated in the same way. These questions rely on unpredictable factors (such as chance, individual performance, and subjective perception) and are not suited for accurate scientific investigation that demands measurable, controllable, and replicable parameters."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Please answer the following question: The answer to the question: What is the full name of the person that is re-making the garden that was seen as a \\"place of pilgrimage\\" for gardeners? is inside the article: John Vass, appointed head gardener in 1939, left in 1957. Called up to the RAF in 1941, he had urged that the hedges be maintained, confident that everything else in the garden could be restored after the war. Ronald Platt succeeded him from 1957 to 1959. In 1959 Pamela Schwerdt and Sibylle Kreutzberger were appointed as joint replacements. They remained at Sissinghurst until 1991, their contributions, \\"as much, if not more than Vita's, mak[ing] it the most admired and popular 20th-century garden in England\\". In 2006 they were awarded the Royal Horticultural Society's Victoria Medal of Honour for their work at Sissinghurst. The pair were followed as head gardener by Sarah Cook, who was succeeded by Alexis Datta.In 2014, Troy Scott Smith, previously head gardener at Bodnant, was appointed – the first male head gardener since the 1950s. He has written of the challenges of maintaining the garden \\"in the manner of its creator, after they have gone\\". In 2018 Scott Smith announced plans to extend the flowering season at Sissinghurst beyond the autumn period established by Schwerdt and Kreutzberger, into the winter months, allowing for year-round opening of the garden. The gardening writer and landscape critic Tim Richardson, writing in 2015, described Scott Smith's re-making of the garden: \\"Sissinghurst, more than any other garden I know, inspires extremes of emotion. There is a feeling that this is Britain's leading garden – and so, arguably, the world's, a status that has proven to be both a great boon and an albatross around its neck\\". Scott Smith's plans include the reinstatement of every species of rose known to have been grown by Sackville-West. A new history of the garden by Sarah Raven was published in 2014. Sissinghurst continues to exert considerable influence, being described as a \\"Mecca\\" and a \\"place of pilgrimage\\" for gardeners from around the world and encouraging many imitators., can you guess it ? Answer:","output":"The full name of the person that is re-making the garden that was seen as a \\"place of pilgrimage\\" for gardeners is Troy Scott Smith. Troy Scott Smith, previously the head gardener at Bodnant, was appointed as the head gardener at Sissinghurst in 2014. He became the first male head gardener since the 1950s at the site. One of his key goals has been to extend the flowering season at Sissinghurst, which previously only spanned until the autumn period, into the winter months. This allowed the garden to be open to visitors year-round.  Additionally, Smith also planned on reinstating every species of rose known to have been grown by Vita Sackville-West, a significant figure in Sissinghurst's history. This restoration effort can be seen as part of his larger vision to maintain the garden \\"in the manner of its creator, after they have gone\\". Troy Scott Smith's renovations have elicited reactions from the gardening community, with gardening writer and landscape critic Tim Richardson describing his work on the garden as inspiring extremes of emotion and suggesting that Sissinghurst might be not just Britain's leading garden, but possibly the world's.

Choices:  - snowfall  - hail  - fog  - sleet  A: The answer to this question is:","output":"sleet Freezing rain that falls from the sky is also called sleet. To provide a detailed explanation, let us explore the different weather phenomena referred to in the answer choices. 1. Snowfall: Snowfall is a form of precipitation consisting of ice crystals that form directly from the freezing of water vapor in the atmosphere. Snowflakes are formed when water vapor in the air condenses directly into ice crystals at subfreezing temperatures. These ice crystals can aggregate with other crystals to form larger snowflakes. When the atmospheric temperature is below freezing, these snowflakes can accumulate on the ground. Snowfall is a common occurrence in cold regions during the winter season. 2. Hail: Hail is a type of solid precipitation that forms in severe thunderstorms. They are formed when powerful updrafts within the storm lift raindrops upwards into the freezing upper levels of the atmosphere. As these frozen raindrops are lifted higher, they continue to collide with supercooled water droplets and grow in size by accumulating more layers of ice. Once the hailstones become too heavy for the storm's updraft to support, they fall to the ground as hail. 3. Fog: Fog is not a form of precipitation, but rather a cloud that forms near the ground. It occurs when the air is cooled to its dew point (the temperature at which air becomes saturated with water vapor), and tiny water droplets condense in the atmosphere. Fog can reduce visibility significantly, creating hazardous conditions for drivers, boaters, and pilots. The primary distinction between fog and clouds is their proximity to the ground. 4. Sleet: Sleet is the term for freezing rain that falls from the sky. Sleet forms when raindrops fall through a layer of freezing air near the ground, causing the raindrops to freeze into ice pellets before reaching the surface. These ice pellets fall to the ground, where they can accumulate and create slippery conditions for transportation and walking. Sleet often occurs during the transition between rain and snow events or in winter storms when the atmosphere's temperature profile is complex. In conclusion, freezing rain that falls from the sky is referred to as sleet. This weather phenomenon occurs when raindrops freeze into ice pellets before reaching the ground, which can create hazardous conditions due to the icy and slippery surfaces it forms."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant that follows instruction extremely well.

It takes some time to really get into his \\"mojo\\", but once you see the clear message and the ability to tell the story that is close to his heart, Lee is a genius. Unlike The 25th Hour or Bamboozled (two of my favorite films of his), there was no clear story in this film. I was able to understand the struggle between Washington and the choice to play well or be influenced by others, but for some odd reason Lee was never able to get the true feeling out. Washington did a decent job with what was handed to him, but you could tell that this was not Lee's favorite film. Not only did Lee direct this film, but he also wrote it. You could tell. The camera work was horrid and the writing only contributed to the decay of the film. This film was coming full circle and it wasn't going to be pretty. Lee was not 100% behind this film as he was with Do the Right Thing. Of all the films I have seen Lee direct, this was the brightest and more modest of his films. It was almost as if he created a Hollywood movie instead of one that was all his own. I don't know if he saw the money from Do the Right Thing and ran with it, or what  but this film did not demonstrate his true talent. For anyone out there that has seen this film, and perhaps stopped watching anything directed by Spike Lee afterwards due to this film, I suggest you give him a second chance. Don't get me wrong, I see exactly where you are coming from with this film and why you would want to put this behind you, but Lee does grow up. His work becomes more of his own, and you can see the transformation from a desire to make money to just wanting to make good films. It took me awhile to watch The 25th Hour, but when I did, it was sheer brilliance. Perhaps it was the actors, perhaps the story, but Lee crafted an amazing film out of one man's journey into the unknown. I guess that is what I was hoping Mo' Better Blues would turn out to be. This really dark journey into the life of a man that really never grew up, but instead all I got was Denzel being Denzel. He really is one of the most versatile actors of this generation, and I do consider him the Sydney Poitier of cinema, but this was not the film to showcase his talent. Another issue that I had with this film was the use of Spike's sister playing one of the love interests. I don't know about you, and your family, but I do not think that I could have filmed a sex scene with my sister. I don't care who the actor is or how much money I am getting paid, I would never do it. It is just something that I never wish to see, but apparently that is different for Spike. He went ahead and showed the full nude image of his sister without any remorse. It was sad and it even made me blush. Also, I need somebody to answer me this. What was Flavor Flav doing introducing this film? So, I am sitting there on my couch, ready to start the film, when suddenly there is a voice from the past spelling out the studio that made this film, then he acknowledges himself. That did not build for a strong remaining of the story. Again, I felt that Lee was going for money on this film instead of actual talent. Perhaps that is how he could afford both Denzel and Wesley in the same movie without any explosions. There were two great scenes in this film that made it worth watching through to the end. Don't get me wrong, this was a very bad movie, but there is always a diamond in every alleyway. The scene when Bleek accidentally forgets which woman he is with was mesmerizing. He continually went back and forth, weaving truth to confusion in a way that proved that Lee was actually behind the camera. It was a visionary scene that was probably lost in the shuffle due to the remaining poor scenes. The other scene that was worth watching was the way that Lee introduced and ended the film. By keeping the same pacing and direction, he was able to bring this tragic character around full circle and give him the chance to change his life. Other than these two moments, the rest of the film was pure rubbish, not worth viewing unless you are about to go blind.

Harry Reid Turns His Back on Weiner, Urges Resignation Amidst Rising Political Pressure\\" In a shocking turn of events, Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid (D) has publicly denounced embattled New York Congressman Anthony Weiner (D). Reid has urged Weiner to resign from his post, stating, \\"I wish there was some way I could defend him, but I can't.\\" This comes in the wake of a string of salacious revelations surrounding Weiner's inappropriate online behavior and the subsequent fallout for the Democratic Party. A sign posted outside of Weiner's office encapsulates the sentiment of many in Washington and across the country: \\"Resign, Pervert Weiner.\\" This plea for resignation extends far beyond the confines of the Capitol, with many citizens expressing their disgust and disappointment in the once-budding political star. While Weiner's fate remains uncertain, one thing is for sure: his career and reputation are in tatters. Meanwhile, New York City Mayor Michael Bloomberg has called for a shift in focus from the salacious scandal to the pressing issues facing the nation. \\"It's time to focus on the country's problems, not this,\\" Bloomberg stated, highlighting the need for the nation's leaders to refocus on a more substantive political discourse. The Weiner scandal, he argues, has become a distraction that detracts from the urgent work that must be done to address pressing problems such as unemployment and the growing federal deficit. To make matters worse for Weiner and the Democratic Party, Republicans have begun targeting lawmakers who've accepted donations from the disgraced Congressman. This line of attack demonstrates the far-reaching implications of Weiner's improprieties and the potential impact they may have on congressional races across the nation. If the pressure from the GOP continues to mount, more Democratic lawmakers may choose to distance themselves from Weiner, further isolating the embattled Congressman and making it much more difficult for him to remain in office. The tables have clearly turned on Anthony Weiner. Once a rising star in the Democratic Party, known for his passionate speeches and fierce advocacy for progressive values, Weiner now finds himself scorned by colleagues and constituents alike. Renowned politicians like Sen. Harry Reid have abandoned him in a bid to distance themselves from the fallout of Weiner's disgraceful actions. As more and more of his colleagues join the chorus calling for resignation, it becomes increasingly difficult for Weiner to hold onto any shred of political power. As Weiner's career hangs in the balance, the American public and politicians alike must ask themselves whether political discourse can return to focusing on the nation's most pressing issues. With Mayor Bloomberg's call to refocus on substantive matters, it is crucial that this scandal does not derail the progress and cooperation needed to address the challenges facing our country. In the end, Weiner's fate may serve as a cautionary tale for politicians who engage in questionable behavior, and a reminder for everyone that in an increasingly interconnected world, one's actions can have far-reaching consequences."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Think like you are answering to a five year old. One of the weaker Carry On adventures sees Sid James as the head of a crime gang stealing contraceptive pills. The fourth of the series to be hospital-based, it's possibly the least of the genre. There's a curiously flat feel throughout, with all seemingly squandered on below-par material. This is far from the late-70s nadir, but Williams, James, Bresslaw, Maynard et al. are all class performers yet not given the backing of a script equal to their ability. Most of the gags are onrunning, rather than episodic as Carry Ons usually are. So that instead of the traditional hit and miss ratio, if you don't find the joke funny in the first place you're stuck with it for most of the film. These continuous plot strands include Williams  for no good reason  worrying that he's changing sex, and Kenneth Cope in drag. Like the stagy physical pratt falls, the whole thing feels more contrived than in other movies, and lacking in cast interest. Continuing this theme, Matron lacks the customary pun and innuendo format, largely opting for characterisation and consequence to provide the humour. In fact, the somewhat puerile series of laboured misunderstandings and forced circumstance reminds one more of Terry and June ... so it's appropriate that Terry Scott is present, mugging futilely throughout. Some dialogue exchanges have a bit of the old magic, such as this between Scott and Cope: \\"What about a little drink?\\" \\"Oh, no, no, I never touch it.\\" \\"Oh. Cigarette then?\\" \\"No, I never touch them.\\" \\"That leaves only one thing to offer you.\\" \\"I never touch that either.\\" That said, while a funny man in his own right (livening up the duller episodes of Randall and Hopkirk (Deceased) no end), you do feel that Cope isn't quite tapped in to the self-parodying Carry On idealology and that Bernard Bresslaw dressed as a nurse would be far funnier. This does actually happen, in part, though only for the last fifteen minutes. Williams attempting to seduce Hattie Jacques while Charles Hawtrey is hiding in a cupboard is pure drawer room farce, but lacks the irony to carry it off. That said, Williams's description of premarital relations is priceless: \\"You don't just go into the shop and buy enough for the whole room, you tear yourself off a little strip and try it first!\\" \\"That may be so,\\" counters Jacques, \\"but you're not going to stick me up against a wall.\\" Williams really comes to life in his scenes with Hattie, and you can never get bored of hearing a tin whistle whenever someone accidentally flashes their knickers.

In the 1960s younger Japanese scholars led by Irokawa Daikichi, reacted against the bureaucratic superstate, and began searching for the historic role of the common people . They avoided the elite, and focused not on political events but on social forces and attitudes. They rejected both Marxism and modernization theory as alien and confining. They stressed the importance of popular energies in the development of modern Japan. They enlarged history by using the methods of social history. It was not until the beginning of the Meiji Era that the Japanese government began taking modernization seriously.

A:","output":"Before Versailles, the French kings primarily resided in various royal residences depending on their personal preferences, political needs, and the locations of the royal estates at different time periods. Some of the most prominent palaces and castles that the French kings called home before Versailles include: 1. Palais de la Cité (Paris): The Palais de la Cité is a medieval fortress located on the Île de la Cité in Paris. It served as the primary residence of the French monarchy from the 10th to the 14th centuries. Originally a Roman fort, the royal estate was expanded and transformed into a Gothic-style palace by King Philippe IV in the 14th century. Some of its notable structures include the Sainte Chapelle and the Conciergerie, which were used for royal functions and events. 2. Château de Vincennes (Vincennes): Just outside Paris, the Château de Vincennes was a popular residence for the French kings in the 14th and 15th centuries. The castle was first built by King Philippe II in the 12th century, and it was significantly expanded by King Charles V in the 14th century to create an enormous fortress with a keep, moats, and defensive walls. Château de Vincennes provided a strategic location for the kings to maintain control of Paris, especially during periods of unrest. 3. Château de Saint-Germain-en-Laye (Saint-Germain-en-Laye): Located approximately 20 kilometers west of Paris, the Château de Saint-Germain-en-Laye was a favorite residence for the French kings during the 16th and 17th centuries. It was first built by King François I in the 16th century and later expanded by King Henri II and King Henri IV. The castle had a vast park, extensive gardens, and the famous Royal Hunting Grounds, where the kings enjoyed hunting and other leisurely activities. 4. Château de Fontainebleau (Fontainebleau): Another popular residence of the French kings during the 16th and 17th centuries was the Château de Fontainebleau, located about 55 kilometers southeast of Paris. Originally a medieval hunting lodge, the castle was transformed by successive kings, including François I and Henri IV, into a grand palace featuring Renaissance and Baroque architecture. Notably, Fontainebleau was a favorite of King Louis XIV before he decided to move his court to Versailles. 5. Louvre Palace (Paris): While it is now the world-famous Louvre Museum, Louvre Palace served as a royal residence from the 14th to the end of the 17th century. King Charles V extensively rebuilt in the 14th century to create a luxurious palace. Later, in the 16th and 17th centuries, Kings François I and Louis XIV continued the expansion and made significant architectural updates, adding new wings and courtyards. In conclusion, before Versailles, the French kings lived in various royal residences such as the Palais de la Cité, Château de Vincennes, Château de Saint-Germain-en-Laye, Château de Fontainebleau, and the Louvre Palace. The choice of residence would depend on factors such as proximity to Paris, strategic importance, and personal preferences related to architecture, gardens, and leisure activities. Versailles became the main royal residence in 1682 when King Louis XIV moved his court to this newly built palace, which remained the epicenter of French political power until the French Revolution in 1789."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Could you help me answer this question? If not, let me know by writing \\"Not answerable\\".  Plot title: Waking Life Movie plot: Waking Life is about an unnamed[3] young man living an ethereal existence that lacks transitions between everyday events and that eventually progresses toward an existential crisis. For most of the film he observes quietly but later participates actively in philosophical discussions involving other charactersâranging from quirky scholars and artists to everyday restaurant-goers and friendsâabout such issues as metaphysics, free will, social philosophy, and the meaning of life. Other scenes do not even include the protagonist's presence, but rather, focus on a random isolated person, group of people, or couple engaging in such topics from a disembodied perspective. Along the way, the film touches also upon existentialism, situationist politics, posthumanity, the film theory of AndrÃ© Bazin, and lucid dreaming, and makes references to various celebrated intellectual and literary figures by name. Gradually, the protagonist begins to realize that he is living out a perpetual dream, broken up only by occasional false awakenings. So far he is mostly a passive onlooker, though this changes during a chat with a passing woman who suddenly approaches him. After she greets him and shares her creative ideas with him, he reminds himself that she is a figment of his own dreaming imagination. Afterwards, he starts to converse more openly with other dream characters, but he begins to despair about being trapped in a dream. The protagonist's final talk is with a character who looks somewhat similar to the protagonist himself and whom he briefly encountered previously, earlier in the film. This last conversation reveals this other character's understanding that reality may be only a single instant that the individual interprets falsely as time (and, thus, life); that living is simply the individual's constant negation of God's invitation to become one with the universe; that dreams offer a glimpse into the infinite nature of reality; and that in order to be free from the illusion called life, the individual need only to... My question: what is a dream? Answer:","output":"A dream is a complex and multifaceted phenomenon that occurs during sleep, particularly during the Rapid Eye Movement (REM) stage. It is an intricate combination of emotions, visual and auditory images, sensations, and sometimes abstract or illogical thoughts that manifest in the form of a narrative or storyline. Dreams can range from vivid and lifelike experiences to fragmented and surreal imaginings, often drawing from an individual's memories, fears, desires, and personal experiences. The study of dreams, known as oneirology, aims to understand the process, purpose, and significance of dreams in the context of human psychological, physiological, and neurological functioning. While various theories exist regarding the purpose and meaning of dreams, there is no universally accepted explanation. One of the most recognized theories is Sigmund Freud's psychoanalytic perspective, which posits that dreams serve as windows into an individual's unconscious mind, specifically revealing repressed desires, fears, and conflicts. According to Freud, dream content often contains symbols and disguised representations of these latent thoughts and emotions. Another theory, the activation-synthesis hypothesis proposed by J. Allan Hobson and Robert McCarley, suggests that dreams result from the brain's attempt to make sense of random neural activity during REM sleep. The brain generates a narrative to connect and interpret these neural signals, which can explain the sometimes strange and disjointed nature of dreams. Cognitive theories, on the other hand, view dreaming as a natural extension of the mind's information-processing and problem-solving capabilities. In this view, dreams serve as a platform for the consolidation of memories, cognitive rehearsal, and the exploration of alternative solutions to real-life problems and situations. This theory is supported by the observation that dreams often involve elements from an individual's recent experiences or concerns. In the context of the movie plot, the protagonist's dreams serve as a gateway to philosophical and existential exploration, blurring the line between reality and the dream world. The dreams in this narrative delve into thought-provoking discussions and concepts, highlighting the infinite nature of reality and the individual's ability to interact with and perceive the world around them. In summary, a dream can be described as a complex and often mysterious experience that occurs during sleep, reflecting a myriad of cognitive, emotional, and neurological processes. Though our understanding of dreams and their purpose continues to evolve, these fascinating experiences remain a rich source of insight into the human mind, as demonstrated by the film's engaging exploration of philosophical and existential themes."},{"instruction":"Q: In this task your given a passage and a question in Catalan, you must answer the question based on the passage.

I heard that Kendall broke into their neighbor's barn and mounted Aubrey's horse in the middle of the night.  And I was wondering How would you describe Kendall? Pick from: a). immoral. b). a jockey. c). an angel. Answer:","output":"Kendall can be described as (a) immoral. To elaborate, Kendall's actions of breaking into their neighbor's barn and mounting Aubrey's horse in the middle of the night demonstrate a lack of respect for others' property and privacy. Engaging in such activities indicates a disregard for ethical and moral standards, which are fundamental to maintaining a harmonious society. By choosing to break into the barn, Kendall has violated the trust that is expected between neighbors and potentially put the safety and wellbeing of Aubrey's horse at risk. Riding someone else's horse without permission also shows a lack of concern for the potential consequences of their actions, particularly if the horse were to react negatively or become injured in the process. This could also result in legal repercussions for Kendall. Though Kendall may have a passion for horse riding, their decision to engage in such a deceptive and morally questionable act ultimately makes it difficult to justify describing them as (b) a jockey. Similarly, given their willingness to act unethically, labeling Kendall as (c) an angel would not accurately reflect their behavior in this situation. In conclusion, based on Kendall's actions, describing them as immoral is the most accurate and fitting label for their behavior. Society places a high value on respecting others' property, boundaries, and trust, and individuals like Kendall who choose to defy these values are typically seen as morally compromised."},{"instruction":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

In both sentences, there are mentions of Ali Adil Shah II, Afzal Khan, Bijapur Sultanate, and the concept of a leading figure. Step 2: Compare the structure of both sentences. Sentence 1 is structured as: - Ali Adil Shah II was a leading court figure - during the reign of Afzal Khan - of the Bijapur Sultanate Sentence 2 is structured as: - Ali Adil Shah II was a leading hoffigur (possibly a typo for \\"court figure\\") - during the reign - of the Bijapur Sultanate of Afzal Khan Step 3: Analyze differences.

The premise and the hypothesis in this scenario are two separate statements and one does not necessarily lead to the other.  The premise states, \\"Weighing the volume in his hand, the Kentuckian straightened up.\\" This provides information about a situation where an individual, who is a Kentuckian, is holding something (possibly a book, given the term \\"volume\\" often refers to a physical book) and examining its heft or weight. He then straightens up, suggesting perhaps he has completed his evaluation of the item or has made some sort of decision. However, the premise does not provide information on what that decision is or what the individual intends to do next. The hypothesis postulates, \\"The Kentuckian decided to buy the volume.\\" The hypothesis suggests an action made by the Kentuckian after evaluating the weight of the volume in his hand, specifically the decision to purchase it. But this hypothesis is not directly supported by the premise. The Kentuckian could have decided to not buy the volume, to borrow it, to steal it, to recommend it to someone else, or have made an entirely different decision unrelated to the volume. In conclusion, the premise - the Kentuckian's brief moment of consideration - does not provide sufficient evidence to support the hypothesis - the Kentuckian's decision to buy the volume. Further information would be needed to conclusively connect these two actions. Thus, it is not possible to conclude that if the premise is true, then so also is the hypothesis. It may be possible; the Kentuckian might well decide to buy the volume after weighing it in his hand, but based purely on the elements presented in the premise, we cannot ascertain this with certainty."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

In most fish, the eggs develop outside of the mother's body. In the majority of these species, fertilization also takes place outside the mother's body. The male and female fish release their gametes into the surrounding water, where fertilization occurs. Female fish release very high numbers of eggs to increase the chances of fertilization.  Two students read about reproduction for biology class. Vic read more about reptile reproduction, while Fox read more about fish reproduction.  Which student learned more about male fish releasing their gametes into the surrounding water? The answer is:","output":"Fox learned more about male fish releasing their gametes into the surrounding water. This is because the question specifically mentions that Fox read more about fish reproduction, while Vic focused on reptile reproduction. Fish reproduction, particularly in the context of the provided information, pertains directly to the process of male fish releasing their gametes into the surrounding water for external fertilization. As such, it is reasonable to infer that Fox's reading material covered this topic in greater detail. In contrast, reptile reproduction generally involves internal fertilization, in which sperm from a male reptile is transferred directly to the female's reproductive tract and fertilizes the eggs inside her body. Reptile eggs are typically laid with a protective leathery or hard shell, and do not involve the release of gametes into the surrounding water like in most fish species. Therefore, Vic's studies would not likely have focused on the specific process of male fish releasing their gametes into the surrounding water.

Amyntas III was also nearly overthrown by the forces of the Chalcidian city of Olynthos, but with the aid of Teleutias, brother of the Spartan king Agesilaus II, the Macedonians forced Olynthos to surrender and dissolve their Chalcidian League in 379 BC.Alexander II (r. 370 – 368 BC), son of Eurydice I and Amyntas III, succeeded his father and immediately invaded Thessaly to wage war against the tagus (supreme Thessalian military leader) Alexander of Pherae, capturing the city of Larissa. The Thessalians, desiring to remove both Alexander II and Alexander of Pherae as their overlords, appealed to Pelopidas of Thebes for aid; he succeeded in recapturing Larissa and, in the peace agreement arranged with Macedonia, received aristocratic hostages including Alexander II's brother and future king Philip II (r. 359–336 BC– ). When Alexander was assassinated by his brother-in-law Ptolemy of Aloros, the latter acted as an overbearing regent for Perdiccas III (r. 368 – 359 BC), younger brother of Alexander II, who eventually had Ptolemy executed when reaching the age of majority in 365 BC.

Article:Major Peake stepped outside the International Space Station's Quest airlock just after 13:00 GMT. He and Nasa astronaut Tim Kopra are scheduled to spend six-and-a-half hours on the exterior of the outpost. The astronauts have completed the primary goal of the spacewalk: replacing a faulty component on the station's exterior. Live: Tim Peake walks in space Its failure in November last year compromised a power channel on the outpost. The failed electrical box regulates power from the solar panels. \\"I think a spacewalk is absolutely the pinnacle of an astronaut's career,\\" Major Peake told BBC Stargazing Live this week. The European Space Agency (Esa) astronaut added: \\"We've put a huge amount of effort into this spacewalk. It's hugely exciting and we're ready to go.\\" Tim Peake on historic spacewalk Note: This tracker uses the time set on the device you are using to predict where the space station is. If your pc, tablet or mobile has the wrong time set then the graphic will not show the correct position. During the EVA - the technical term for a spacewalk - the two Tims ventured to the very edge of the space station. They had to travel half its length, a distance of roughly 50m - which is equivalent to an Olympic-sized swimming pool. Peake and Kopra moved along the exterior using their arms, but are attached to the space station's external structure via steel cords, or tethers. Colonel Kopra exited the Quest airlock first, followed by his British colleague a few minutes later. Kopra then proceeded to the worksite with a toolbox, where he anchored a foot restraint as an additional safety measure. The US astronaut then gave a \\"Go\\" signal for Major Peake to follow the Nasa astronaut, carrying the replacement electrical box. While he was waiting for Col Kopra's signal, Tim Peake was able to get accustomed to being outside for the first time, including looking down on planet Earth. Luca Parmitano, an Italian Esa astronaut who conducted two spacewalks in 2013, told BBC Five Live: \\"It is unimaginable... there are no words to describe the feeling of seeing our planet from above through a visor - that's all that separates us from the view, a thin visor of plexiglass.\\" \\"When language evolved, it described what we saw around us. Being on the space station, doing an EVA, walking outside is not something we have experienced [as a species].\\" Both astronauts have trained in a large indoor water tank called the Neutral Buoyancy Laboratory at Houston's Johnson Space Center. Nasa astronaut Michael LÃ³pez-AlegrÃ­a, who holds the US record for cumulative spacewalking time, said the two Tims were well prepared, but added there were key differences between underwater training and a real EVA. \\"One is that translation [moving from one point to another] is quite a bit different without the viscosity of the water,\\" he told BBC News. \\"This is especially true when [Major Peake] will be transporting relatively large masses (like the SSU) relatively long distances. This fact will change his centre of gravity and will affect the results of the inputs he makes with his hands and arms during translation.\\" But he explained: \\"This kind of thing is 'all in a day's work' for a spacewalker. I'm very confident that the two Tims will complete their tasks with great skill, efficiently and, most importantly, safely.\\" The failed electrical component - known as a Sequential Shunt Unit (SSU) - was relatively straightforward to swap out: it involved undoing just one bolt. But the ISS takes 90 minutes to orbit the Earth, so the astronauts experience 45 minutes of daylight followed by 45 minutes of total darkness. Peake and Kopra could only work on the SSU in darkness, because in daylight, there may be a current running through the box. Tim Peake in space: Want to know more?

They were given a safe window of 31 minutes to work on changing the SSU, but only needed 19, finishing the task at 14:56 GMT. Speaking before the spacewalk, Mr Peake said both astronauts would have to be very careful while working on the electrical box because there was nothing to protect them from the high voltages generated by the solar panel. At one stage, Col Kopra's suit was showing abnormal CO2 readings, but mission control decided it was down to a sensor problem. The astronauts next split up to work on separate tasks. Tim Peake is deploying cables along one side of the station's Destiny lab; they are to be used by new docking ports. The task requires Major Peake to manoeuvre through some tight spaces, so he will have to be careful not to snag his tether on any components. Tim Kopra has several activities in the meantime; he has completed the installation of a valve that had to be removed for relocation of the station's Leonardo module last year. Michael Foale, who was born in Louth, Lincolnshire, became the first Briton to make a spacewalk on 9 February 1995, during a US space shuttle mission. Born to a British father and American mother, Mr Foale has dual British and US citizenship. He was selected under Nasa's astronaut programme and therefore \\"flew\\" as an American. Traditionally, the British government has not funded human spaceflight, leading a generation of budding astronauts to look to the US space agency as their only route to orbit. But the UK changed its policy after Mr Peake was selected in 2009 as a European Space Agency astronaut. Thus, Mr Peake is the first person since Helen Sharman in 1991 to wear the Union flag in space.

Please answer the following question: I can use this background: Baker's yeast is the common name for the strains of yeast commonly used in baking bread and bakery products, serving as a leavening agent which causes the bread to rise (expand and become lighter and softer) by converting the fermentable sugars present in the dough into carbon dioxide and ethanol. Baker's yeast is of the species Saccharomyces cerevisiae,[1] and is the same species (but a different strain) as the kind commonly used in alcoholic fermentation, which is called brewer's yeast.[2] Baker's yeast is also a single-cell microorganism found on and around the human body.  Now, I have a new situation: Two groups of students made some experiments for school. Group A used brewer's yeast on flower and tried to make bread. and Group B brewed beer with brewer's yeast, then baked bread with baker's yeast.  Answer this question please: Which group caused the bread to rise more? Answer:","output":"Based on the provided background information, Group B would cause the bread to rise more. The reason for this is because Group B used baker's yeast for baking the bread, which is the appropriate yeast strain for bread-making (Saccharomyces cerevisiae). Baker's yeast serves as a leavening agent that enables the dough to rise by converting fermentable sugars into carbon dioxide and ethanol, resulting in lighter and softer bread. On the other hand, Group A used brewer's yeast on flour to try to make bread. Although brewer's yeast is also of the species Saccharomyces cerevisiae, it is a different strain and is specifically used for alcoholic fermentation. Therefore, Group A's bread would not be expected to rise as much as Group B's bread given the yeast strain difference and its primary function for brewing rather than bread-making."},{"instruction":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

The most electronegative element is fluorine, which has a value of 4.0. As discussed in the lesson \\"Trends in the Periodic Table,\\" electronegativity increases across a row as the number of protons in the nucleus increases and therefore has a stronger pull. Electronegativity decreases down a column due to an increased effect of electron shielding in larger atoms.  A high school student, Timmy, is reading about elements of a periodic table.

A. dentist office  B. bedroom  C. supermarket  D. drug store  E. grocery store  The best answer is Answer:","output":"A. dentist office The most plausible location for the man to receive a free toothbrush is the dentist office. Dentists and dental hygienists often provide complimentary toothbrushes to their patients as part of their routine checkups or cleaning appointments. These toothbrushes usually come with other oral hygiene supplies like toothpaste and floss. This practice is a part of the dentist's preventive care measures, encouraging patients to maintain proper oral health between visits. Dentists emphasize the importance of regular brushing and proper dental care to minimize the risk of cavities, gum disease, and other oral health issues. Providing a free toothbrush reinforces this message and encourages patients to replace their toothbrushes more often, as recommended by dental professionals. Although it's not impossible to receive a free toothbrush in other locations/settings such as supermarkets, drug stores, or grocery stores, it is less likely, as the complimentary distribution of toothbrushes usually happens during events or promotions. On the other hand, toothbrushes are regularly sold in these locations. The bedroom is not a typical place to receive a free toothbrush, as it is a private, non-commercial space. Therefore, the best answer to the question of where the man got the toothbrush for free is the dentist office."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant that follows instruction extremely well.

Direct effects: - Higher pollution: A city contributes to increased air pollution, which can lead to a higher concentration of chemicals like sulfur dioxide and nitrogen oxide in the atmosphere. These pollutants are the primary cause of acid rain. - Urban heat island effect: Cities are known to have a higher temperature than surrounding rural areas, due to the concentration of human activities and industrial processes. The urban heat island effect can facilitate the formation of acid rain through increased evaporation and condensation. 2. Indirect effects: - Decreased vegetation mitigation: Urban development reduces the amount of vegetation that can act as a buffer to absorb and mitigate the effects of acid rain. Reduced vegetation cover can exacerbate the effects of acid rain on soil and surface water. - Increased runoff and erosion: Urban surfaces, such as roads, sidewalks, and parking lots, are impermeable, which can lead to increased acid rain runoff and erosion. This can cause more damage to the surrounding environment and alter local water systems. - Reinforcing emission sources: Cities typically have higher populations and concentrations of industry, so there may be more emission sources contributing to acid rain production in and around the city. This can further damage the urban environment and impact nearby ecosystems as well.

It involves tracking and shooting ducks, usually for sport or food. Whether you are a seasoned hunter or a beginner, it's crucial to have the right gear, knowledge, and skills to ensure a successful and enjoyable hunting experience. In this article, we will discuss the essentials of duck hunting including camouflage, decoys, duck calls, and the proper equipment to help you have a fruitful and safe hunt. 1. Blend in with your surroundings: the importance of camouflage The first critical aspect of a successful duck hunt is your ability to blend in with your surroundings. Camouflage clothing and gear allow you to hide from ducks, who have excellent eyesight and are easily spooked. Invest in high-quality camouflage garments that match the colors and patterns of the environment you will be hunting in. Additionally, make sure that your face and hands are concealed with gloves and a face mask or face paint. 2. Fool the ducks: utilizing duck decoys Duck decoys can enhance your chances of attracting and luring ducks closer to your area. Purchase realistic duck decoys that mimic the species you plan to hunt. Position them strategically in the water to simulate the natural behavior of ducks. As birds fly overhead, they will see the decoys, which will make them feel safer and more likely to land nearby. This will give you the perfect opportunity to take your shot. 3. Speak their language: mastering the duck call A duck call is a valuable tool that can greatly improve your chances of success in the field. By accurately reproducing the sounds of the species you plan to hunt, you can communicate with the ducks and draw them in closer. Invest in a quality duck call and practice your calling skills ahead of the hunt to ensure you can mimic the sounds convincingly. 4. Choose the right firearm: the versatility of a 12-gauge shotgun When it comes to selecting the ideal firearm for duck hunting, a 12-gauge shotgun is a versatile and efficient option. These guns offer a good combination of power, range, and accuracy, making them suitable for both novice and experienced hunters. Familiarize yourself with your chosen shotgun and practice your shooting skills at a range before venturing out into the field. 5. Make the switch: using non-toxic ammunition In recent years, there has been a shift towards using non-toxic shotgun shells in place of traditional lead shot. Non-toxic ammunition is made from materials like steel, bismuth, or tungsten, and is less harmful to the environment and wildlife. Ensure that you have enough non-toxic ammunition to last your hunting trip and abide by local regulations. 6. Protect your firearm: investing in a gun sleeve A gun sleeve is an essential accessory to protect your shotgun from the elements and potential damage during your hunt. Waterproof and designed to keep your gun secure, a gun sleeve can prevent corrosion from moisture and dirt, ensuring that your firearm remains in top condition. 7. Stay dry and mobile: high boots and waders Lastly, a successful duck hunt often requires walking through wet or swampy terrain. With waterproof high boots and waders, you can comfortably and confidently navigate through such environments, making it easier to retrieve your ducks once they've been shot. Conclusion Duck hunting can be a thrilling and rewarding experience, but it requires preparation, practice, and the right gear. By following the tips outlined above, you will be well-equipped to have a successful and enjoyable duck hunting adventure. As always, remember to observe safety precautions and follow local regulations to ensure a responsible and sustainable hunting experience."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

However, education cannot promise all wishes, dreams, and desires.Society must reject the foolish idea that a college education's main purpose is to satisfy our desires and secure success.Like most challenging things, education is a gamble   in which results depend entirely on people's ability to look past their wants to see the realism and reason behind their wants. For instance, my first year of college, I took a sociology class.In class, we were taught that Third World countries were poor.We learned that our quality of life would be almost impossible for an average person in those countries.I began to examine my own desire to be rich.To always go after money felt selfish when knowing others had none at all.Learning about other society's financial situations forced me to look beyond what I wanted. Through the process of education, everything once desired is tested.Wanting something no longer is enough; it's more important to examine why we want it and whether we really want it.When my desire for money changed, everything changed.I stopped longing for money-driven careers and stopped valuing the people who had them.I began to examine the things I purchased and my reason for wanting them. Education is a tool to be used to develop and advance our desires, so we can discover the things that are truly significant in life.Education is a source to expand our society to see beyond the superficial   appeals and the \\"quick fixes\\" , leaving the belief of an...

In an already tense region, the increasing number of fatalities has raised grave concerns for the safety and stability of the country. The victims, a mix of civilians and security personnel, were caught in the crossfire during a series of violent altercations that took place in various locations across the nation. The reasons for the surge in violence remain unclear, but preliminary investigations suggest that a combination of political turmoil, socio-economic issues, and extremist elements could be fueling the tension. Authorities have been working around the clock, trying to piece together patterns in the widespread aggression, in hopes of apprehending those responsible and preventing further loss of life. Although the details of the incidents differ, one common thread that connects them is the senseless nature of the attacks, targeting innocent bystanders as well as those in the line of duty. International partners have expressed their condolences and urged for stability to be restored, offering assistance where necessary. The government of Algeria is undoubtedly under immense pressure to contain the situation and bring the culprits to justice swiftly, to demonstrate the nation's commitment to protecting its citizens and ensuring their well-being. The events have left the nation and the international community in a state of mourning for the ten lives lost in the senseless acts of violence. The resounding message that remains is the need for unity and solidarity among the Algerian people.

Please answer the following question: The following article contains an answer for the question: 73 people were killed in bombings where? , can you please find it?   The arrival of the Manchester Ship Canal in 1894, and the subsequent development of the Trafford Park industrial estate in the north of the town – the first planned industrial estate in the world – had a substantial effect on Stretford's growth. The population in 1891 was 21,751, but by 1901 it had increased by 40% to 30,436 as people were drawn to the town by the promise of work in the new industries at Trafford Park.During the Second World War Trafford Park was largely turned over to the production of matériel, including the Avro Manchester heavy bomber, and the Rolls-Royce Merlin engines used to power both the Spitfire and the Lancaster. That resulted in Stretford being the target for heavy bombing, particularly during the Manchester Blitz of 1940. On the nights of 22/23 and 23/24 December 1940 alone, 124 incendiaries and 120 high-explosive bombs fell on the town, killing 73 people and injuring many more. Among the buildings damaged or destroyed during the war were Manchester United's Old Trafford football ground, All Saints' Church, St Hilda's Church, and the children's library in King Street. Smoke generators were set up in the north of the town close to Trafford Park in an effort to hide it from enemy aircraft, and 11,900 children were evacuated to safer areas in Lancashire, Cheshire, Derbyshire, and Staffordshire, along with their teachers and supervisors. A memorial to those residents who lost their lives in the bombing was erected in Stretford Cemetery in 1948, over the communal grave of the 17 unidentified people who were killed in the blitz of December 1940.Between 1972 and 1975, what is now a closed B&Q store in Great Stone Road was the 3,000-capacity Hardrock Theatre and Village Discothèque, hosting some of that period's major artists in their prime. Led Zeppelin, David Bowie, Bob Marley, Elton John, Hawkwind, Yes, Chaka Khan, Curved Air and Lou Reed were amongst those who appeared. Tangerine Dream was the last band to perform at the Hardrock, on 19 October 1975. In more recent years, Lancashire...

If \\"A older Asian man ironing a white shirt.\\", does this mean that \\"A human ironing\\"?","output":"Yes, the phrase \\"An older Asian man ironing a white shirt\\" does imply that a human is ironing. In this context, the human being described is an older Asian man who is performing the action of ironing a white shirt.  Ironing is a common household chore typically done by people to remove wrinkles and creases from clothes, resulting in a neat and polished appearance. The process involves using a heated appliance, known as an iron, and a flat, padded surface called an ironing board. The heat and pressure applied to the fabric allow the fibers to be manipulated and the wrinkles to be smoothed out. \\"A human ironing\\" can be understood as a statement describing any person engaging in the act of ironing, regardless of their age, gender, or ethnicity. In this specific case, the human in question happens to be an older Asian man. The act of ironing is a universal task performed by individuals from various cultural backgrounds, as it is an essential part of maintaining one's clothing and personal appearance. Additionally, ironing transcends generations and has been practiced for centuries as new innovations in technology have continually evolved and improved the process. People iron various types of garments, including shirts, pants, dresses, and more. In this instance, the man is ironing a white shirt, which has become a classic wardrobe staple for both men and women around the world. White shirts can be made of various fabrics such as cotton, linen, or polyester blends, each with different care and ironing methods. Some fabrics may require a lower temperature setting on the iron, while others may call for a higher heat or the use of a pressing cloth to provide a barrier between the iron and the fabric, preventing any potential damage. In conclusion, the phrase \\"An older Asian man ironing a white shirt\\" means that a human, specifically an older Asian man, is engaging in the act of ironing a white shirt. Ironing is a universal chore performed by individuals regardless of demographics, and it is a necessary task to maintain a neat and polished appearance."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Oxygen plays an essential role in the process of cellular respiration, by which cells produce energy in the form of adenosine triphosphate (ATP), using glucose and other nutrients from food. If more oxygen were available, it could potentially improve cellular respiration efficiency in some tissues. However, the digestive processes you mentioned (chewing, the action of saliva, stomach acid, enzyme secretion, and food transit through the gut) would likely not be directly impacted by the presence of more oxygen. That said, there may be indirect effects of increased oxygen on the digestive system. For example, enhanced cellular respiration could improve the general health and functioning of tissues involved in digestion, including the muscular contractions that guide food through the gastrointestinal tract (peristalsis). However, it is unlikely that these indirect effects would significantly change the amount of food expelled from the body. Overall, the presence of more oxygen in the body may have some positive impact on the functioning of the digestive system, but it is unlikely to directly alter the process or lead to more food being expelled from the body."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

It was a night train, so we had our own room where my brother and I claimed the top as our territory.

I quickly got off the train in excitement taking in the view of the station like it was first time I had seen anything. We exited the station and took the trolley to get to our hotel. For breakfast, we had delicious, regional delicacies (among other things). They looked similar to crepes, but all I know is that it had a German name that I can’t remember. After we got situated in our hotel, we immediately headed off for the Mozart Plaza/Park. My family and I also visited other monuments that day: By the end of the day, our legs were worn out. We had rode so many trolleys and walked so much that I’m pretty sure that any longer and we would’ve collapsed on the spot. The bed never felt so good. The following days we went to Austrian Castle, Ice Cave, and more buildings and such. The trip overall made this birthday the most memorable and the best thus far.

This post discusses and explores my experiences of being a PhD student researching women’s lived experiences of research evaluation in the UK, and my thoughts on and experiences of interviewing very senior and esteemed academics as a junior researcher. My PhD study explored research evaluation in the form of the Research Excellence Framework (REF) – a weighty force in UK academia – the outcomes of which, I argue, hold the potential to alter the course of an academic career considerably, as well as playing a role in the type of work that some academics do, particularly given the REF impact agenda. There is currently an international trend towards research evaluation with programmes such as the Excellence in Research for Australia (ERA), the Performance-Based Research fund in New Zealand (PBRF), and equivalents in countries including Denmark, Switzerland and the Netherlands. What is clear is that there is not enough qualitative, exploratory research into the effects of research evaluation on academic careers, especially for women, and so my PhD study was born. My findings suggest that research evaluation in the UK actively contributes to the continuance of gender inequality regimes in the academy, and that the ability to negotiate managerial control and be politically savvy is increasingly important in the academic world. Before embarking on my PhD, I was acutely aware of the sensitivity of my research, as well as my own positionality with regards to my participants.

You will be given a task. You must generate a detailed and long answer. Q:I'm taking a test and have to guess the right answer to the question after the article. Article: Two new studies suggest that modern running shoes could increase the risk of injuries to runners. One study involved sixty-eight healthy young women and men who ran at least twenty-four kilometers a week. The runners were observed on a treadmill machine  . Sometimes they wore running shoes. Other times they ran barefoot  . Researchers from the JKM Technologies company in Virginia, the University of Virginia and the University of Colorado did the study. They found that running shoes create more stress that could damage knees, hips and ankle joints than running barefoot. They observed that the effect was even greater than the effect reported earlier for walking in high heels. The study appeared in the official scientific journal of The American Academy of Physical Medicine. The other study appeared in the journal Nature. It compared runners in the United States and Kenya. The researchers were from Harvard University in Massachusetts, Moi University in Kenya and the University of Glasgow in Scotland. They divided the runners into three groups. One group had always run shoeless. Another group had always run with shoes. And the third group had changed to shoeless running. Runners who wear shoes usually come down heel first. That puts great force on the back of the foot. But the study found that barefoot runners generally land on the front or middle of their foot. That way they ease into their landing and avoid striking their heel. Harvard's Daniel Lieberman led the study. He says the way most running shoes are designed may explain why those who wear them land on their heels. The heel of the shoe is bigger and heavier than other parts of the shoe, so it would seem more likely to come down first. Also, the heel generally has thick material under it to soften landings. But the researchers do not suggest that runners immediately start running barefoot. They say it takes some training. And there can be risks, like running when your feet are too cold to feel if you get injured. The study was partly supported by Vibram,... Question: What's the main idea of the passage? Options: A: Walking in high heels could cause less serious effects than running barefoot. B: Two new discoveries encourage people to run in high heels. C: Running in shoes is partly good to runners.

Sarries' strength in depth told as Chris Ashton and Chris Wyles crossed the whitewash, and Courtney Lawes' late converted try was mere consolation. The hosts were the only side to progress to the knockout stages unbeaten and it is now 904 days since the Londoners last lost at home in the competition. But Saints - without England captain Dylan Hartley, Lions wing George North, scrum-half Lee Dickson, prop Kieran Brookes, flanker Tom Wood and number eight Sam Dickinson - pushed the favourites before running out of steam in the final 20 minutes. On 23 April, the Premiership leaders will meet Wasps, a side who reached the last four in extraordinary circumstances, with a last-second Jimmy Gopperth conversion securing a 25-24 win over Exeter. Saracens, who had claimed a try-scoring bonus point in all but one of their group games, were expected to romp into the last four, but Northampton but up a brave resistance. The visitors will rue letting 11 points go astray in an impressive start which had Saracens flanker Will Fraser sin-binned for a late tackle on Ben Foden. Stephen Myler missed two simple penalties, while wing Jamie Elliott failed to touch down after crossing the try line. The Saints eventually did score, the impressive Teimana Harrison breaking loose and feeding Pisi for the opening try which Myler converted, but it was their missed opportunities which will be the talking point. Saracens, a team which had six of England's Grand Slam winners in its line-up, kept within touching distance thanks to Farrell's boot, the England centre ending with a 100% record. After the break, the hosts were much improved and momentum was with them when, in the 69th minute, Ashton celebrated with a swan dive after good work by Alex Goode and Farrell. Shortly afterwards Wyles made sure of Sarries' progress, picking up a loose ball from 10 metres out and finishing. Saracens director of rugby Mark McCall: \\"This was a complex match for us.

Question 2: Why do so many people ask soppy questions on Quora, which can easily be Googled? Are questions 1 and 2 asking the same thing?","output":"Question 1 and Question 2 are indeed related, as both questions are inquiring about people's use of Quora as opposed to Google. However, they are not entirely the same, as Question 1 wonders about the general motivation or reasoning behind using Quora, while Question 2 specifically addresses the prevalence of \\"soppy\\" or seemingly trivial questions on Quora. Here, I will discuss the reasons why people use Quora and then address the issue of seeking simple answers on the platform. Reasons why people use Quora instead of Google: 1. Personalized answers: One of the primary reasons people turn to Quora is to receive tailor-made responses. Google serves as an excellent search engine that provides answers by displaying related web pages, but it often retrieves generic or broad solutions. By asking a question on Quora, users can obtain personalized insight or clarification according to their specific context and circumstances. 2. Expert opinions: Quora is known for hosting a community of experts and professionals from various fields who can offer their expertise and valuable perspectives. Google searches can lead to answers from experts, but Quora provides a more direct and assured way of accessing that expert knowledge. 3. Diverse perspectives: When posing a question on Quora, individuals have the opportunity to receive multiple answers from different users, each potentially coming from a distinct standpoint. This variety of responses enriches the discussion and allows the question-asker to evaluate diverse viewpoints. 4. Subjective questions: Quora is particularly useful for subjective, opinion-based inquiries. Google searches may point users toward subjective discussions, but the Quora platform fosters conversation and the exchange of personal experiences and thoughts. 5. Engaging discussions: Beyond merely being a Q&A platform, Quora serves as a space for discourse and thought-provoking engagement. Users engage in conversations, deliberate on ideas, and even debate on certain topics. It offers a communication platform that cannot be obtained through a Google search. As for the second question, addressing the prevalent \\"soppy\\" or simple questions on Quora, there could be several reasons: 1. Lack of knowledge: Some users may not have the necessary search skills or knowledge to effectively find answers on Google. They might feel more comfortable asking a question on Quora and receiving direct responses. 2. Human touch: Even for simple questions, users might prefer receiving answers from real people instead of search engine algorithms. The interaction with other individuals could sometimes make the process more enjoyable and trustworthy. 3. Validation: By asking a question on Quora, users may seek agreement, validation, or confirmation from others. They might want to check whether their understanding of a concept is correct or simply need assurance from someone with experience or authority on the matter. 4. Growing their network and reputation: Sometimes users ask simple or trivial questions to engage with the community and expand their network. By doing so, they can increase their visibility, make connections, and potentially boost their reputation on the platform. In conclusion, both questions address the use of Quora by individuals seeking answers that could be obtained from Google searches. However, the first question pertains to a broader scope of motivations, while the second zeroes in on the specific case of simple or \\"soppy\\" questions. Using Quora can offer numerous benefits such as personalized answers, expert opinions, diverse perspectives, and engaging conversations. Moreover, asking straightforward questions on Quora can arise from reasons such as lack of knowledge, seeking human interaction, desiring validation, or attempting to expand one's network and reputation."},{"instruction":"Given the question: Dayr al-Shaykh (Arabic: دير الشيخ‎) was a Palestinian Arab village in the Jerusalem Subdistrict also known as the Jerusalem corridor.

With a focus on sustainability, the company has announced plans to develop animal-free leather and cultivate meat in laboratories, making these fascinating fields environmentally friendly and cruelty-free. Spearheaded by Asia's richest man, Li Ka-Shing, this startup has already raised a staggering 10 million in funding. The quest for sustainable and ethical fashion has been an ongoing challenge, often featuring numerous trials and errors. However, this innovative firm has set its focus on creating high-quality, animal-free leather that does not compromise on appearance, durability, or performance. By attempting to leave the ecological footprint of traditional leather production behind, they will be reducing waste generated during the process and combatting environmental issues that are further exasperated by animal farming. While vegan leather options have been available in the market, their eco-friendliness and overall performance haven't proven satisfactory enough to draw the attention of major designers and consumers. With this in mind, the company seeks to collaborate with designers who share their passion for eco-friendly choices and want to embrace the new age of fashion. Not only does the development of this animal-free leather hold the key to revolutionizing the fashion world, but it also strengthens the global movement of ethical, responsible fashion. In addition to this revolutionary approach to leather, the firm is also exploring the fascinating world of lab-grown meat. By utilizing advanced cellular agriculture technologies, they are aiming to develop cultured meat that would transform the way we consume food and lessen the environmental impact of livestock farming. With a growing global population and increased demand for protein, these innovative solutions also contribute to addressing pressing food security issues.

Please briefly summarize this news article: The New York Times “We’ve got people here who can’t live without it,” said Tommy Hellstrom, 75, who lives in an assisted-living home down the boulevard and counts himself among that group. “Better than sitting at home with those senile people.” He, like others on Monday, had no business to conduct in the parlor — the corporation stopped taking bets a week ago, and kept open this branch and two others merely to pay outstanding winning tickets and cash out account holders. The cash flow was strictly one-way. The televisions were dark. Most of them, anyway. As if to add insult to the day, one monitor was showing “All My Children.” The 20-something group dissipated, and other regulars trickled in. “I can’t look at horses anymore — there’s no fun,” said Michael Partridge, 69. He regularly added money to his account, but never withdrew. “I got the pleasure of it,” he said. “To handicap horses every night.” Henry, another regular, turns 82 on Wednesday and declined to give his last name. “The service was excellent,” he said of the parlor. What was he going to do now? “I just lost my wife,” he said, his wet eyes getting a little more so. “It seems like yesterday, but it was four years ago. Don’t believe time’s the big healer.” OTB has helped him, he said: “Just getting out of the house.” In lieu of anything resembling action, there were rumors. A woman who used to paint signs for a living said, “I heard it’s going to reopen in February.” Nobody paid much attention, and this would be news to the State Legislature. Someone said, “I hope something works out.” Villains abounded: Inept management. Thieves. “Corruption.” “Bums.” When you hear someone say “Good luck” at a betting window, it tends to come from the inside out, but on Monday, it was the now former bettors wishing their best for the clerks. One clerk, a 30-year veteran, had no idea how he was going to spend his first day out of work. Another, Clark Sygurdsson, 63, with 39 years on the job — men with seniority were picked for Monday’s work — shrugged. “I’m heading to the golf course,” Mr. Sygurdsson said. He counts himself among the lucky ones, with enough time on to draw a decent pension. His wife wants him to cook more. “There you go,” he said. “I’ll be busy.” George O’Neill, the owner of the betting parlor and bar O’Neill’s in Maspeth, Queens, stopped by to close his account. He recalled the sudden word of the parlor closings last week. “One guy, two babies,” Mr. O’Neill said. “He was crying. I’ll never get over that one.” Joe Fazz, 53, a court officer who works across the street, cleaned out a mound of betting tickets in his Forest Hills home — “shorties,” he called them, or small winners — and brought them to the parlor on Monday. He chatted while the clerk tallied dozens of tickets. “It’s all old money,” Mr. Fazz said. “You should never play with money you need.” A sign overhead, now moot, read, “Bet With Your Head, Not Over It.” The shorties came to 326 and change. Mr. Fazz peeled off a 10 bill and handed it back through the glass as a tip. “You’re a gentleman,” the clerk said. “Good luck,” Mr. Fazz replied.

Tolkien's fictional legendarium, Beleriand was a region in northwestern Middle-earth during the First Age. Events in Beleriand are described chiefly in his work \\"The Silmarillion\\", which tells the story of the early ages of Middle-earth in a style similar to the epic hero tales of Nordic literature. Beleriand also appears in the works \\"The Book of Lost Tales\\", \\"The Children of Húrin\\", and in the epic poems of \\"The Lays of Beleriand\\".  - The Hobbit, or There and Back Again is a children's fantasy novel by English author J. R. R. Tolkien. It was published on 21 September 1937 to wide critical acclaim, being nominated for the Carnegie Medal and awarded a prize from the \\"New York Herald Tribune\\" for best juvenile fiction. The book remains popular and is recognized as a classic in children's literature.  - In the fiction of J. R. R. Tolkien, the Edain were men (humans) who made their way into Beleriand in the First Age, and were friendly to the Elves.  - Haleth is a fictional character from J.R.R. Tolkien 's Middle - earth legendarium . She was a leader of the Second House of the Edain , called the Folk of Haleth after her . At the time of her birth , the Second House of Men had settled in Thargelion , in East Beleriand , living in separate homesteads and having no lords of their own . But in Y.S. 375 of the First Age Morgoth sent out an Orc - raid against them . The Men were caught off - guard , and a great part of their people was wiped out . The remnant was gathered under one Haldad and his twin children , daughter Haleth and son Haldar ; and they held out for days in a stockade until the Noldor rescued them , by which time both Haldad and Haldar were slain . Caranthir offered to Men his lands to live in protected , but Haleth refused , for now she was chosen a Chieftain , being of great heart and no less in valour than her kinsmen . Next year she led her people to Estolad ; and after a time again urged them to move further westward . They passed through the horrors of Nan Dungortheb only by the strength of Haleth 's will , and at last came to the woods of Talath Dirnen . Later many removed the forest of Brethil , which was a part of Doriath outside the Girdle of Melian , but now was granted to them by Thingol . Haleth ruled the Folk of Brethil until she died . She was buried in a green mound in the heights of the Forest , which was called therefore the Ladybarrow ( Haudh - en - Arwen in Sindarin and Tûr Haretha in their own tongue ) . The next Chieftain of Brethil was her nephew Haldan .  - Norse mythology is the body of mythology of the North Germanic people stemming from Norse paganism and continuing after the Christianization of Scandinavia and into the Scandinavian folklore of the modern period. The northernmost extension of Germanic mythology, Norse mythology consists of tales of various deities, beings, and heroes derived from numerous sources from both before and after the pagan period, including medieval manuscripts, archaeological representations, and folk tradition.  - Middle-earth is the setting of much of J. R. R. Tolkien's legendarium. The term is equivalent to the term \\"Midgard\\" of Norse mythology, describing the human-inhabited world, i.e. the central continent of the Earth in Tolkien's imagined mythological past. Tolkien's most widely read works, \\"The Hobbit\\" and \\"The Lord of the Rings\\", take place entirely in Middle-earth, and \\"Middle-earth\\" has also become a short-hand to refer to the legendarium or its \\"fictional universe\\".  - In the fiction of J. R. R. Tolkien, the First Age, or First Age of the Children of Ilúvatar is the heroic period in which most of Tolkien's early legends are set.

In this case, let's move the 44*m term to the right-hand side by subtracting 44*m from both sides: 44*m - 44*m = 99*m - 44*m This simplifies to: 0 = 55*m Now, in order to isolate m, we'll divide both sides of the equation by 55: 0 / 55 = 55*m / 55 0 = m Thus, m = 0."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Most people also have a decline in strength and stamina. Their senses may start failing, and their reflex time typically increases. Their immune system also doesn’t work as well as it used to. As a result, common diseases like the flu may become more serious and even lead to death. The majority of late adults develop arthritis, and as many as one in four develop Alzheimer’s disease.  Margaret is a sophomore in high school who just started her Spring break. With a week off from school, her family is spending some time driving out of state to visit her grandma, Kathy, who has a cabin up in the snowy mountains. Margaret always enjoys spending time with her grandma because she has interesting stories and makes some of the best pie around. Also, they always go skiing when visiting the cabin so Margaret is excited for that.  Who would be more likely to get lost on the mountain? Answer:","output":"While both Margaret and her grandma Kathy may be familiar with the area around the cabin, it is more likely that Kathy, being in the late adulthood stage, would be at a higher risk of getting lost on the mountain. This conclusion can be drawn based on several factors affecting individuals in late adulthood that may impact their ability to navigate the mountainous terrain. 1. Decline in sensory abilities: As people age, their senses, such as vision, hearing, and proprioception (the sense of body position and movement), may decline. Poor vision may make it difficult for Kathy to identify landmarks or read trail signs, while compromised hearing could prevent her from hearing calls from Margaret or other skiers who may be trying to guide her back on track. 2. Cognitive decline: Late adulthood often brings about cognitive decline, which can negatively impact memory, attention, and spatial awareness - all crucial factors in navigation. If Kathy is experiencing any cognitive decline, she may struggle to remember the layout of the mountain or find her way back to the cabin even if she has been there multiple times before. 3. Decreased physical strength and stamina: Due to age-related loss of muscle mass and strength, Kathy might tire more quickly and have a harder time traversing mountain terrain. As fatigue sets in, her decision-making abilities may be impaired, increasing the likelihood of her getting lost. 4. Slower reflexes and reaction times: Older individuals tend to have slower reflexes, which could hinder Kathy from reacting appropriately to sudden changes in terrain or weather conditions, making her susceptible to getting lost. 5. Potential health conditions: Since late adulthood brings an increased risk of diseases like arthritis and Alzheimer's disease, if Kathy has either of these conditions or any other health-related issues, her ability to navigate and keep up with Margaret could be significantly impacted. On the other hand, Margaret, being a high school sophomore, is likely to be at the stage where her cognitive, physical, and sensory abilities are still thriving. As a result, her memory, attention, and spatial awareness are likely more reliable, enabling her to navigate the mountain more effectively. Furthermore, her youthful energy and strength would allow her to cover more ground and maintain her focus for a longer time.  In conclusion, considering the factors that influence the abilities of individuals in late adulthood, Kathy would be more likely to get lost on the mountain compared to her granddaughter Margaret, whose youthful vigor and cognitive capabilities provide her with an advantage in such situations. However, it's essential for both of them to take necessary precautions and communicate effectively to ensure that they have a safe and enjoyable time skiing in the mountains."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

For those with even more money there was Polish Cochineal; also known as Kermes vermilio or \\"Blood of Saint John\\", which was made from a related insect, the Margodes polonicus.

For breakfast, we had delicious, regional delicacies (among other things). They looked similar to crepes, but all I know is that it had a German name that I can’t remember. After we got situated in our hotel, we immediately headed off for the Mozart Plaza/Park. My family and I also visited other monuments that day: By the end of the day, our legs were worn out. We had rode so many trolleys and walked so much that I’m pretty sure that any longer and we would’ve collapsed on the spot. The bed never felt so good. The following days we went to Austrian Castle, Ice Cave, and more buildings and such. The trip overall made this birthday the most memorable and the best thus far. Bonus: We missed our night train back because of daylight saving hours. The trip back was definitely hectic, but adventurous. When did the children go to Austria?

The name originates from the 1848 tract \\"Manifesto of the Communist Party\\" by Karl Marx and Friedrich Engels. According to Leninist theory, a Communist party is the vanguard party of the working class (proletariat), whether ruling or non-ruling, but when such a party is in power in a specific country, the party is said to be the highest authority of the dictatorship of the proletariat. Vladimir Lenin's theories on the role of a Communist party were developed as the early 20th-century Russian social democracy divided into Bolshevik (meaning \\"\\"of the majority\\"\\") and Menshevik (meaning \\"of the minority\\") factions. Lenin, leader of the Bolsheviks, argued that a revolutionary party should be a small vanguard party with a centralized political command and a strict cadre policy; the Menshevik faction, however, argued that the party should be a broad-based mass movement. The Bolshevik party, which eventually became the Communist Party of the Soviet Union, took power in Russia after the October Revolution in 1917. With the creation of the Communist International, the Leninist concept of party building was copied by emerging Communist parties worldwide.  - Azad Jammu and Kashmir (\\"zd Jamm o Kamr\\"), abbreviated as AJK and commonly known as Azad Kashmir, is a self-governing administrative division of Pakistan. The territory lies west of the Indian-administered state of Jammu and Kashmir, and was previously part of the former princely state of Jammu and Kashmir, which ceased to exist as a result of the first Kashmir war fought between India and Pakistan in 1947.

You will be given a task. You must generate a detailed and long answer. Summarize this article: Politics being showbusiness for ugly people, Joan Collins has no interest in getting involved in it. As we learn in her new book, a manifesto entitled The World According to Joan, at 18 she was voted “Most Beautiful Girl in England” (page 46), while at the age of 21 she was signed up to a film in which she had to play “the most beautiful girl in New York” (page 49).      Dear Joanie tells me that she did once get involved with UKIP, “but I wasn’t sure it was the kind of thing I wanted to do. I’m not Glenda Jackson.” No, heaven forbid. So where does La Collins fall on the political spectrum? “I’d say I was Conservative party, 1940s.” She laughs huskily; it’s ever so naughty. “And I was a very big supporter of Thatcher.”      What does she think of David Cameron? “I like David, but I think he’s hog-tied by what’s-his-name.” Nick Clegg? “Yes. I’m not a big fan.” And what does she think of Ed Miliband. “Not a lot,” she says simply.      Even though La Collins insists that a life in Westminster holds no thrall for her – she is, after all, 78, and goodness knows what the electorate would make of her second and third homes in Los Angeles and St Tropez – she doesn’t hesitate when I ask her what she would do if, in a parallel universe, Joan Collins were Prime Minister.      “First, education. I think it is shocking that 15- and 16-year-olds leave school unable to add up and with the reading ability of a four-year-old. When I was at school, I was terrible at algebra and arithmetic, but I was always the best at English and literature. And acting, of course.” She does a self-mocking “Of course I was” shrug of her shoulders, which are currently minus Dynasty-style pads.      “I always did the best essays. I edited the fourth-form school magazine because, while I always wanted to be an actress, at the back of my mind I also wanted to be a dress designer and a writer, and funnily enough I have actually ended up doing all three.”      But enough about her talents. She settles herself in to a huge sofa in the Dorchester, the cushions almost swallowing her little frame, before launching back in to the Joan Collins plan to fix Britain. “Second, immigration. Because the reason we don’t have any housing is that we have 400,000 extra people coming in here every year and doing jobs that our young people could do.”      “And that’s just the ones we know about,” adds her publicist.      “Yes!” says Joan, throwing her dainty little jewel-encrusted and manicured hands in to the air. “Exactly! In Birmingham last Christmas, I said to my driver, ‘Why are there no decorations?’ I had just come back from New York where every street is festooned with decorations. And he said, ‘Well, we have a lot of people here whom it offends on religious grounds.’ But I’m not saying any more than that. I don’t want petrol bombs being thrown through my window.”      She is weary of being seen as an old reactionary, but then she hasn’t much time for being politically correct. And it would be easy to dismiss her views as irrelevant, that of an out-of-touch septuagenarian millionairess who splits her time between two continents. And yet, the more I listen to her, the more I think she makes some quite salient points, that she simply says what she sees. Even the assertions in her book about her great beauty cease to seem arrogant – more of a statement of fact. She is a diamond-encrusted battleaxe.      What else does she want to talk about? The riots, of course. “These kids are so ignorant and stupid. I don’t think they have much of a moral compass now because they spend their life doing – what are those games they do? The ones where they kill and they shoot? And they watch a lot of violent stuff on television.” She sighs. “And, of course, porn is readily available.” Joan, the star of such films as The Bitch and The Stud can’t “stand watching porn”, even tried getting it taken off her Sky system, “but, unfortunately, it’s part of the package”.      It would never have been like that in her day. “I hear that it is far more disgusting than it was 20 or 30 years ago, and kids of 11 can watch it on their phones at school. So they are desensitised. I don’t think they have much judgment. They think that, when they kick a pensioner to death – which seems to happen on a regular basis in this country – they’re not actually kicking a real person. Violence has become normalised in this country, and I think it’s quite tragic.”      La Collins is sipping on a Bloody Mary and eating a club sandwich – or at least parts of it, removing layers of bread as she goes. Last night was her book launch, attended by the likes of Frederick Forsyth, Barbara Taylor Bradford, Christopher Biggins, Nicky Haslam “and lots of my friends who are not ‘above-the-title’ names”. At this she lets out another throaty laugh.      The book puts down reality television stars, declining standards in dress (“It’s no one’s fault to be born ugly, but, honestly, must it be worn as a symbol of pride?”) and a lack of chivalry in men (“Gone are the days when a gentleman lightly took your hand in his and brushed his lips across it, or tipped his hat to acknowledge you as he chivalrously stepped aside to let you pass”).      Men are turning gay because women are unfeminine. Women over a size 10 should not wear slip dresses, and nobody should show bare legs in winter. Ankle-strap shoes are “seriously unattractive”, and she advises against wearing jeans. “Rarely glamorous” is her damning indictment of them.      Joan, whose fifth husband Percy is 32 years younger than her, sits in front of me in a cream beret and a zebra-print dress. She is dripping in gold jewellery. Her publicist tells me: “I rarely wear any make-up, but, at the end of a day with Joan, I am caked in it.” La Collins looks incredible and you can tell this is actually because she has had no work done and stayed natural (she thinks sex is better than Botox).      How, I ask, does she look so glamorous the whole time? “You think I’m glamorous today? This is all just thrown together. What I find extraordinary is that all these girls today go out in the coldest weather, wearing the shortest skirts with crop tops, no stockings and no coats.” She shivers at the thought. “But I guess they can’t take the coats in because they will just get stolen.”      I wonder what she makes of modern-day celebrities. She once said that the only person she could think of with true star quality was Angelina Jolie, so I decide to throw some names at her. What does she think of Gwyneth Paltrow? “Is she the one who called her grandmother a rude word on air?” she asks, dismissively. “I thought that was pretty shocking.”      Kiera Knightley? “Well, she’s thin,” is all Joan will say. Carey Mulligan? “I don’t want to comment on Carey Mulligan,” she remarks sadly, before proceeding to do just that. “I can’t believe she’s playing Eliza Doolittle in a new movie.”      I move on and show her a picture of Kate Winslet taken a few days earlier at the Venice Film Festival. She lets out a huge sigh. “Oh, that’s a dreadful dress. The worst dress. And ghastly shoes and an awful hairstyle. I’m sorry.” She shakes her head.      I move away from actresses. Adele? “She’s a very good singer, very, very talented, but she has a terrible hairpiece.” Joan, a self-confessed wig wearer, knows a lot about hairpieces.      Kate Moss is “OK, but she’s not Linda Evangelista in my mind”. I clutch desperately at straws. There must be one modern-day female she admires. Victoria Beckham? “Oh I love Victoria Beckham. You’ve finally found someone I like.”      And that’s the other reason Joan Collins could never be a politician: she tells it like it is.      ‘The World According to Joan’ by Joan Collins is available exclusively from Sainsbury’s at a special introductory price of £5 (RRP: £12.99) ||||| Joan Collins has apparently never heard the the old adage, \\"If you don't have anything nice to say, don't say anything at all.\\"      The 78-year-old British actress is acting just as catty as the \\"Dynasty\\" character, Alexis Carrington, she's best known for playing.      With her new book, \\"The World According To Joan,\\" Collins calls it as she sees it, and doesn't hold anything back. The book puts down reality TV stars, modern fashion, and makes the assertion that men are \\"turning gay because women are unfeminine\\", reports The Telegraph who asked her for thoughts on some of today's A-list stars.      Upon seeing a photo of actress Kate Winslet at the Venice Film Festival, the paper reports Collins let out a sigh and said, \\"Oh, that's a dreadful dress. The worst dress. And ghastly shoes and an awful hair style.\\"      Collins takes fashion very seriously. After all this is the same woman who after feeling faint was rushed from this year's Vanity Fair Oscar party in an ambulance -- all because the dress she wore was too tight.      Collins also said she didn't want to comment on actress Carey Mulligan, but then told The Telegraph, \\"I can't believe she's playing Eliza Doolittle in a new movie.\\" All Collins would say about Kiera Knightley is that she's thin, and that while singer Adele is talented, she wears terrible hair pieces.      Wondering Collin's thought's on Kate Moss? She says Moss is \\"OK, but she's not Linda Evangelista.\\"      Collins has never been shy with her opinions about celebrities, and in 2010 told the UK's Hello! magazine that she didn't think there were many good looking actresses around today, with the exception of Angelina Jolie.      \\"Jennifer Aniston is cute, but I wouldn't call her beautiful. I think that's why Cheryl Cole is so popular, because she is just so pretty and public are starved of gorgeous people,\\" she declared.                         |||||","output":"Joan Collins, the British actress known for her role as Alexis Carrington in the show \\"Dynasty,\\" has published a book entitled \\"The World According to Joan.\\" In her book, Collins discusses her views on topics such as immigration, reality TV stars, and modern fashion. She also gives her opinion on current A-list celebrities and is quite outspoken and blunt in her criticisms. Collins does not express interest in politics, but when asked about her political stance, she describes herself as a supporter of the Conservative party in the 1940s and a big fan of Margaret Thatcher. Regarding education, Collins believes that the current system is failing young people, with many 15- and 16-year-olds leaving school without basic skills. She believes that immigration is a key factor in the UK's housing shortage, as the influx of people is taking up available housing and jobs. Collins also shares her thoughts on the negative influence of violent video games and the widespread availability of porn on young people. Despite her age (78) and often controversial opinions, Collins's book raises several relevant points and shows that she is unafraid to speak her mind. Ultimately, \\"The World According to Joan\\" reflects Collins's views on the current state of the world as well as her experiences in the entertainment industry."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

A friend asked me to answer this question: What was the full name of the existing monument Horace Albright drafted a proposal to enlarge?, using the article: Zion National Park is an American national park located in southwestern Utah near the town of Springdale. A prominent feature of the 229-square-mile (590 km2) park is Zion Canyon, which is 15 miles (24 km) long and up to 2,640 ft (800 m) deep. The canyon walls are reddish and tan-colored Navajo Sandstone eroded by the North Fork of the Virgin River. The lowest point in the park is 3,666 ft (1,117 m) at Coalpits Wash and the highest peak is 8,726 ft (2,660 m) at Horse Ranch Mountain. Located at the junction of the Colorado Plateau, Great Basin, and Mojave Desert regions, the park has a unique geography and a variety of life zones that allow for unusual plant and animal diversity. Numerous plant species as well as 289 species of birds, 75 mammals (including 19 species of bat), and 32 reptiles inhabit the park's four life zones: desert, riparian, woodland, and coniferous forest. Zion National Park includes mountains, canyons, buttes, mesas, monoliths, rivers, slot canyons, and natural arches. Human habitation of the area started about 8,000 years ago with small family groups of Native Americans, one of which was the semi-nomadic Basketmaker Anasazi (c. 300 CE). Subsequently, the Virgin Anasazi culture (c. 500) and the Parowan Fremont group developed as the Basketmakers settled in permanent communities. Both groups moved away by 1300 and were replaced by the Parrusits and several other Southern Paiute subtribes. Mormons came into the area in 1858 and settled there in the early 1860s. In 1909, President William Howard Taft named the area Mukuntuweap National Monument in order to protect the canyon. In 1918, the acting director of the newly created National Park Service, Horace Albright, drafted a proposal to enlarge the existing monument and change the park's name to Zion National Monument, Zion being a term used by the Mormons. According to historian Hal Rothman: \\"The name change played to a prevalent bias of the time.

Context: Once again, I've analysed my year of travel to see if I'm any closer to reducing it year on year. It's an annual habit, and if often kicks off new ideas that might affect my team's next year of work. The good answer is: yes, there is less travel! And not just that, but having reduced the schlepping I do, I've been able to hire more amazing people to lead on our work, and celebrate one of NoTosh's best years ever in terms of the quality, quantity and breadth of work we're doing. Key to traveling less has been a marked increase in the number of folk who see and are now reaping the value of working with us online. I've avoided as many as 20,000 miles of travel thanks to greener clients, who are also many dollars better off having not paid for the airmiles that are wrapped up in our regular fee structure. The quality of our work is better, too, thanks to this. We are doing fewer of those day-long workshops with teachers or leaders, when an hour or even thirty minutes before the day gets started is more worthwhile. We're seeing more school leaders take this up, although it's harder to get teachers into the habit of taking 30 minutes 'me time' to jump into a coaching session on the day or week ahead. But it's starting, and the value to us all is huge. Coaching is very different to 'consulting a Personal Learning Network' on Twitter. It's intense, targeted, focussed and involves a one-on-one discussion that arrives quickly at resolutions to current day challenges that will have a long-term impact. And we come back to measure whether that impact actually happened. I don't think it's a way of working that many are used to in Education, although many corporate clients have had some rare experience with it. Encouraging both groups to take more regular time out for coaching, little and often, is a real challenge, but we're beginning to see some huge impact from relatively little input (and relatively few dollars!).

Esimerkiksi Euroopassa, Kaukasuksella ja Välimeren maissa lohikäärmeet ovat olleet osa tarustoa ja kansanperinnettä. Lohikäärmeet ovat vaikuttaneet monien eurooppalaisten maiden mytologiassa ja satuperinteessä. Kansantarinat kertovat lohikäärmeistä, jotka asuvat luolistoissa, vuoristoissa ja muissa kaukaisissa paikoissa. Eurooppalaisessa mytologiassa lohikäärmeet ovat usein kuvattu hirviöiksi, jotka aiheuttavat tuhoa ja vaativat säännöllisiä uhrauksia, kuten kullan ja vaikka nuorten neitojen luovuttamista. Kaukasuksen alueella lohikäärmeillä on myös omat perinteensä. Armeenialaisessa, georgialaisessa ja kaukasialaisessa mytologiassa lohikäärmeitä kutsutaan yleisesti vishapiksi, jokapatiksi tai smairiksi. Ne ovat valtavia, voimakkaita ja pahoja olentoja, jotka aiheuttavat monenlaisia ongelmia, kuten tulvia, kuivuutta ja maanjäristyksiä. Välimeren ja Lähi-idän alueen kulttuureissa lohikäärmeiden tarinat on usein yhdistetty hedelmällisyyteen, veden ja jopa maan voimiin.

Answer:","output":"The TV show that finds out what happens when people stop being polite, and start being real is MTV's pioneering reality series, \\"The Real World.\\" \\"The Real World\\" premiered on May 21, 1992, and is considered one of the ground-breaking reality television shows that set the stage for the genre's expansive growth in the following years. Created by Mary-Ellis Bunim and Jonathan Murray, \\"The Real World\\" is a series where a group of young adults, usually aged between 18 and 25, are brought together to live in a house or apartment, often located in a significant city. The participants (called \\"housemates\\" or \\"roommates\\") hail from diverse backgrounds, ensuring varied perspectives, interests, and experiences. Their interactions and personal dynamics are filmed over several months, with the footage later edited into multiple episodes portraying their relationships, conflicts, and personal growth. \\"The Real World\\" initially sought to explore how individuals from different walks of life would interact when pushed out of their comfort zones, leading to a more authentic portrayal of the participants' personalities. This concept aligns with the show's famous tagline: \\"This is the true story… of seven strangers… picked to live in a house… and have their lives taped… to find out what happens… when people stop being polite… and start getting real… The Real World.\\" Over the years, the show has evolved to include various themes, location changes, and challenges for the housemates, such as operating a business or participating in volunteer work. The series also tackled significant social and personal issues faced by the participants, ranging from mental health, addiction, and sexuality to racism, politics, and religion. By addressing these issues, \\"The Real World\\" has played a crucial role in advancing public awareness and understanding of the various challenges and experiences that people may encounter across diverse backgrounds. In total, \\"The Real World\\" had 33 seasons, with its most recent season airing in 2019 on Facebook Watch. The series paved the way for many other successful reality shows, including MTV's \\"Road Rules\\" and \\"The Challenge,\\" both of which feature contestants from \\"The Real World\\" as well as original competitors. Overall, its influence on the reality TV genre, genuine depiction of social issues, and lasting impact on pop culture have made \\"The Real World\\" an enduring and significant show that showcased the consequences of people shedding their polite veneers and embracing their authentic selves."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant that follows instruction extremely well. Help as much as you can. Information:  - An atom is the smallest constituent unit of ordinary matter that has the properties of a chemical element. Every solid, liquid, gas, and plasma is composed of neutral or ionized atoms. Atoms are very small; typical sizes are around 100 picometers (a ten-billionth of a meter, in the short scale).  - Ethane (or ) is an organic chemical compound with chemical formula CH. At standard temperature and pressure, ethane is a colorless, odorless gas. Like many hydrocarbons, ethane is isolated on an industrial scale from natural gas and as a petrochemical byproduct of petroleum refining. Its chief use is as feedstock for ethylene production.  - Natural gas is a naturally occurring hydrocarbon gas mixture consisting primarily of methane, but commonly including varying amounts of other higher alkanes, and sometimes a small percentage of carbon dioxide, nitrogen, hydrogen sulfide, or helium. It is formed when layers of decomposing plant and animal matter are exposed to intense heat and pressure under the surface of the Earth over millions of years. The energy that the plants originally obtained from the sun is stored in the form of chemical bonds in the gas.  - Chemistry is a branch of physical science that studies the composition, structure, properties and change of matter. Chemistry includes topics such as the properties of individual atoms, how atoms form chemical bonds to create chemical compounds, the interactions of substances through intermolecular forces that give matter its general properties, and the interactions between substances through chemical reactions to form different substances.  - Intermolecular forces (IMFs) are the forces which mediate interaction between molecules. They also include forces of attraction or repulsion which act between molecules and other types of neighboring particles (e.g., atoms or ions). They are weak compared to the intramolecular forces  the forces which keep a molecule together. For example, the covalent bond, involving the sharing of electron pairs between atoms, is much stronger than the forces present between neighboring molecules. Both sets of forces are essential parts of force fields frequently used in molecular mechanics.  - In physics, heat is that amount of energy flowing from one body to another spontaneously due to their temperature difference, or by any means other than through work or the transfer of matter. The transfer can be by contact between the source and the destination body, as in conduction; or by radiation between remote bodies; or by conduction and radiation through a thick solid wall; or by way of an intermediate fluid body, as in convective circulation; or by a combination of these.   - In physics, a force is any interaction that, when unopposed, will change the motion of an object. In other words, a force can cause an object with mass to change its velocity (which includes to begin moving from a state of rest), i.e., to accelerate. Force can also be described intuitively as a push or a pull. A force has both magnitude and direction, making it a vector quantity. It is measured in the SI unit of newtons and represented by the symbol F.  - An ion is an atom or a molecule in which the total number of electrons is not equal to the total number of protons, giving the atom or molecule a net positive or negative electrical charge. Ions can be created, by either chemical or physical means, via ionization.  - Fractional distillation is the separation of a mixture into its component parts, or fractions, separating chemical compounds by their boiling point by heating them to a temperature at which one or more fractions of the compound will vaporize. It uses distillation to fractionate. Generally the component parts have boiling points that differ by less than 25 °C from each other under a pressure of one atmosphere. If the difference in boiling points is greater than 25 °C, a simple distillation is typically used.  - Petrochemistry is a branch of chemistry that studies the transformation of crude oil ( petroleum ) and natural gas into useful products or raw materials . These petrochemicals have become an essential part of the chemical industry today .  - Methane (or ) is a chemical compound with the chemical formula (one atom of carbon and four atoms of hydrogen). It is a group 14 hydride and the simplest alkane, and is the main constituent of natural gas. The relative abundance of methane on Earth makes it an attractive fuel, though capturing and storing it poses challenges due to its gaseous state under normal conditions for temperature and pressure.  - Helium is a chemical element with symbol He and atomic number 2. It is a colorless, odorless, tasteless, non-toxic, inert, monatomic gas, the first in the noble gas group in the periodic table. Its boiling point is the lowest among all the elements.  - In organic chemistry, a hydrocarbon is an organic compound consisting entirely of hydrogen and carbon, and thus are group 14 hydrides. Hydrocarbons from which one hydrogen atom has been removed are functional groups, called hydrocarbyls. Aromatic hydrocarbons (arenes), alkanes, alkenes, cycloalkanes and alkyne-based compounds are different types of hydrocarbons.  - A chemical compound (or just compound if used in the context of chemistry) is an entity consisting of two or more atoms, at least two from different elements, which associate via chemical bonds. There are four types of compounds, depending on how the constituent atoms are held together: molecules held together by covalent bonds, ionic compounds held together by ionic bonds, intermetallic compounds held together by metallic bonds, and certain complexes held together by coordinate covalent bonds. Many chemical compounds have a unique numerical identifier assigned by the Chemical Abstracts Service (CAS): its CAS number.  - A chemical reaction is a process that leads to the transformation of one set of chemical substances to another. Classically, chemical reactions encompass changes that only involve the positions of electrons in the forming and breaking of chemical bonds between atoms, with no change to the nuclei (no change to the elements present), and can often be described by a chemical equation. Nuclear chemistry is a sub-discipline of chemistry that involves the chemical reactions of unstable and radioactive elements where both electronic and nuclear changes may occur.  - Carbon dioxide (chemical formula CO) is a colorless and odorless gas that is vital to life on Earth. This naturally occurring chemical compound is made up of a carbon atom covalently double bonded to two oxygen atoms. Carbon dioxide exists in Earth's atmosphere as a trace gas at a concentration of about 0.04 percent (400 ppm) by volume. Natural sources include volcanoes, hot springs and geysers, and it is freed from carbonate rocks by dissolution in water and acids. Because carbon dioxide is soluble in water, it occurs naturally in groundwater, rivers and lakes, in ice caps and glaciers and also in seawater. It is present in deposits of petroleum and natural gas.  - Structure is an arrangement and organization of interrelated elements in a material object or system, or the object or system so organized. Material structures include man-made objects such as buildings and machines and natural objects such as biological organisms, minerals and chemicals. Abstract structures include data structures in computer science and musical form. Types of structure include a hierarchy (a cascade of one-to-many relationships), a network featuring many-to-many links, or a lattice featuring connections between components that are neighbors in space.  - Distillation is a process of separating the component or substances from a liquid mixture by selective evaporation and condensation. Distillation may result in essentially complete separation (nearly pure components), or it may be a partial separation that increases the concentration of selected components of the mixture. In either case the process exploits differences in the volatility of the mixture's components. In industrial chemistry, distillation is a unit operation of practically universal importance, but it is a physical separation process and not a chemical reaction.  - A fuel is any material that can be made to react with other substances so that it releases chemical or nuclear energy as heat or to be used for work. The concept was originally applied solely to those materials capable of releasing chemical energy but has since also been applied to other sources of heat energy such as nuclear energy (via nuclear fission and nuclear fusion).  - Gas is one of the four fundamental states of matter (the others being solid, liquid, and plasma). A pure gas may be made up of individual atoms (e.g. a noble gas like neon), elemental molecules made from one type of atom (e.g. oxygen), or compound molecules made from a variety of atoms (e.g. carbon dioxide). A gas mixture would contain a variety of pure gases much like the air. What distinguishes a gas from liquids and solids is the vast separation of the individual gas particles. This separation usually makes a colorless gas invisible to the human observer. The interaction of gas particles in the presence of electric and gravitational fields are considered negligible as indicated by the constant velocity vectors in the image. One type of commonly known gas is steam.  - A liquid is a nearly incompressible fluid that conforms to the shape of its container but retains a (nearly) constant volume independent of pressure. As such, it is one of the four fundamental states of matter (the others being solid, gas, and plasma), and is the only state with a definite volume but no fixed shape. A liquid is made up of tiny vibrating particles of matter, such as atoms, held together by intermolecular bonds. Water is, by far, the most common liquid on Earth. Like a gas, a liquid is able to flow and take the shape of a container. Most liquids resist compression, although others can be compressed. Unlike a gas, a liquid does not disperse to fill every space of a container, and maintains a fairly constant density. A distinctive property of the liquid state is surface tension, leading to wetting phenomena.  - Earth, otherwise known as the world, is the third planet from the Sun and the only object in the Universe known to harbor life. It is the densest planet in the Solar System and the largest of the four terrestrial planets.  - Hydrogen is a chemical element with chemical symbol H and atomic number 1. With an atomic weight of , hydrogen is the lightest element on the periodic table. Its monatomic form (H) is the most abundant chemical substance in the Universe, constituting roughly 75% of all baryonic mass. Non-remnant stars are mainly composed of hydrogen in the plasma state. The most common isotope of hydrogen, termed \\"protium\\" (name rarely used, symbol H), has one proton and no neutrons.  - Petroleum (from : \\"rock\\" + \\"oleum\\": \\"oil\\". ) is a naturally occurring, yellow-to-black liquid found in geological formations beneath the Earth's surface, which is commonly refined into various types of fuels. Components of petroleum are separated using a technique called fractional distillation.  - Hydrogen sulfide is the chemical compound with the formula . It is a colorless gas with the characteristic foul odor of rotten eggs. It is very poisonous, corrosive, and flammable.  - A chemical bond is a lasting attraction between atoms that enables the formation of chemical compounds. The bond may result from the electrostatic force of attraction between atoms with opposite charges, or through the sharing of electrons as in the covalent bonds. The strength of chemical bonds varies considerably; there are \\"strong bonds\\" or \\"primary bond\\" such as metallic, covalent or ionic bonds and \\"weak bonds\\" or \\"secondary bond\\" such as Dipole-dipole interaction, the London dispersion force and hydrogen bonding.  - In the classical physics observed in everyday life, if something has mass and takes up space, it is said to be composed of matter; this includes atoms (and thus molecules) and anything made up of these, but not other energy phenomena or waves such as light or sound. More generally, however, in (modern) physics, matter is not a fundamental concept because a universal definition of it is elusive: elementary constituents of atoms may not take up space individually, and massless particles may be composed to form objects that have mass (even when at rest).  - Nitrogen is a chemical element with symbol N and atomic number 7. It was first discovered and isolated by Scottish physician Daniel Rutherford in 1772. Although Carl Wilhelm Scheele and Henry Cavendish had independently done so at about the same time, Rutherford is generally accorded the credit because his work was published first. The name \\"nitrogen\\" was suggested by Jean-Antoine-Claude Chaptal in 1790, when it was found that nitrogen was present in nitric acid and nitrates; this name derives from the Greek roots  \\"nitre\\" and - \\"to form\\". Antoine Lavoisier suggested instead the name \\"azote\\", from the Greek  \\"no life\\", as it is an asphyxiant gas; his name is instead used in many languages, such as French, Russian, and Turkish, and appears in the English names of some nitrogen compounds such as hydrazine, azides and azo compounds.

Earlier this week, @naval (CEO and co-founder of AngelList) asked a question on Twitter: \\"The challenge of the next decade is not Artificial Intelligence, but Human Intelligence. Can we retrain the workforce as knowledge workers?\\"\\" At the heart of his question is an interesting observation. As automation and artificial intelligence replaces manual jobs, how do we retrain people in the new knowledge economy where information handling and management is in high demand? I thought I would share some experiences, observations, and recommendations based upon when I did this previously in my career. Back in 2004 I was peddling my wares as a journalist, writing for the tech press. I was living in the West Midlands in England and heard about a new organization in nearby Birmingham called OpenAdvantage. The premise was neat: open source was becoming a powerful force in technology and OpenAdvantage was set up to provide free consultancy for companies wanting to harness open source, as well as individuals who wanted to upskill in these new technologies. At the time in the West Midlands lots of industry was being automated and moved out to Asia, so lots of Midlanders were out of jobs and looking to retrain. This required, by definition, retaining the workforce as knowledge workers. OpenAdvantage was funded by the UK government and the University of Central England, had a decent war chest, and was founded by Scott Thompon and Paul Cooper (the latter of which I met when he heckled me at a talk I gave at a Linux User Group once. 🙂 ) So, I went along to their launch event and wrote a piece about them. Shortly after, Paul and Scott invited me back over to the office and offered me a job there as an open source consultant. I took the role, and this is where I cut my teeth on a lot of open source, community, and working with businesses.

When his British publisher expressed a dislike for the word \\"background,\\" Ambler changed the title to \\"Uncommon Danger\\" for publication in English-speaking countries, with the exception of the United States. In the United States, the novel retained its original title, \\"Background To Danger.\\" This means that \\"Uncommon Danger\\" was not the title used universally for the book.

Plot title: The Outsiders Movie plot: The story begins with Ponyboy Curtis (Howell) writing a school report about his recent experiences growing up in 1965 Tulsa, Oklahoma. His friends, the Greasers, are a gang of tough, low-income middle-class teens. The gang includes 14-year-old Ponyboy and his two older brothers, Sodapop (Lowe) and Darrell \\"Darry\\" (Swayze), as well as Johnny (Macchio), Dallas \\"Dally\\" Winston (Dillon), Two-Bit Matthews (Estevez), and Steve Randle (Cruise). Their long-term rivalry is with the Socs, a gang of wealthier kids from the other side of town. Two Socs, Bob Sheldon (Garrett) and Randy Anderson (Dalton), confront Johnny, Ponyboy, and Two-Bit, who are strolling with and talking to the Socs' girlfriends, Cherry (Lane) and Marcia (Meyrink), after watching a movie at a drive-in theater. The girls defuse the situation by going back with the Socs. Ponyboy and Johnny fall asleep in the parking lot where Ponyboy dreams of his deceased parents. Awakened by Johnny, he worriedly heads home fearing Darrel's frustration. As he fears, Darrel is angry with him for coming home late. Sodapop draws himself into the argument, resulting in Darrel hitting Ponyboy. Emotionally hurt by Darrel's assault, Ponyboy flees his home and finds Johnny. The two boys head to the park. Ponyboy and Johnny are soon attacked in the park by Bob, Randy, and three other Socs. They kick Johnny to the ground and grab Ponyboy and attempt to drown him by dunking him in the park fountain, making him temporarily unconscious. When they attempt to drown Ponyboy, Johnny pulls out his switchblade and stabs Bob to death, while the other Socs quickly flee to the police. After regaining consciousness and learning what has happened, Ponyboy goes with Johnny in search of Dally's help. On Dally's advice, and the fact that murderers in Oklahoma will be executed on the electric chair, Ponyboy and Johnny flee on a cargo train, and hide out in an abandoned church on Jay Mountain in Windrixville.

The word \\"screen\\" is a neutral object and doesn't have any sentiment value in itself. Step 2: Determine the context In this case, we don't have enough context to understand the specific situation in which the term \\"best screen\\" is being used, making it challenging to derive the exact sentiment. However, we can assume that it is likely a positive statement because the word \\"best\\" is being used. Without further context, we cannot be sure. Step 3: Combine the sentiment values Given the positive sentiment of \\"best\\" and the neutral sentiment of \\"screen,\\" the overall sentiment of the sentence \\"best screen\\" can be perceived as positive, albeit slightly vague due to the lack of context.

Review: 'Mojo' is a story of fifties London, a world of budding rock stars, violence and forced homosexuality. 'Mojo' uses a technique for shooting the 1950s often seen in films that stresses the physical differences to our own time but also represents dialogue in a highly exaggerated fashion (owing much to the way that speech was represented in films made in that period); I have no idea if people actually spoke like this outside of the movies, but no films made today and set in contemporary times use such stylised language. It's as if the stilted discourse of 1950s screenwriters serves a common shorthand for a past that seems, in consequence, a very distant country indeed; and therefore stresses the particular, rather than the universal, in the story. 'Mojo' features a strong performance from Ian Hart and annoying ones from Aiden Gillan and Ewan Bremner, the latter still struggling to build a post-'Trainspotting' career; but feels like a period piece, a modern film incomprehensibly structured in an outdated idiom.

In his first leading role Ben Mendelsohn plays Danny Clark, a bumbling eighteen-year-old guy. He knows what it takes to be cool and have some style, it is just that he seems to struggle to get there. Danny has enthusiasm and passion and only wants two things more than anything in the world. A Jaguar XJ6 and a date with the gorgeous Joanna Johnson (an early role for then 17-year-old Claudia Karvan). Get these and his life will be complete. Unfortunately for Danny, when he finally gets the courage up to ask Joanna out, he somehow manages to promise her a ride in his new Jaguar. She is not particularly impressed by cars, but still agrees to his invitation. The problem is, Danny does not own a Jaguar. His form of transport is his recently received birthday present - and it most certainly is not a Jaguar. His eccentric parents have decided to pass on their pride and joy to Danny for his use. Their 1963 Nissan Cedric has been in the family for years and is immaculate  but extremely uncool. Danny is aghast at the thought of driving around in a car as dorky as a Cedric and, with the promise of a date with Joanna and the need for a Jaguar in a hurry, decides to trade in the old Nissan.

You must generate a detailed and long answer. If was the one, perfect and sufficient sacrifice for the sins of the world., can we conclude that \\"The one was enough sacrifice for the sins of the world.\\"?","output":"Yes, based on the premise that the one, perfect, and sufficient sacrifice for the sins of the world exists, we can conclude that \\"The one was enough sacrifice for the sins of the world.\\" Let's explore this concept in more detail by examining its theological roots and implications for various religious beliefs. The idea of a single, perfect, and sufficient sacrifice for the sins of the entire world is primarily rooted in Christian theology. In Christianity, Jesus Christ is believed to be that perfect and sufficient sacrifice. According to the New Testament, Jesus was crucified and subsequently resurrected to atone for the sins of humanity. This sacrificial act is considered to be a manifestation of God's love, grace, and mercy towards a sinful world. As the Apostle Paul wrote in the book of Romans: \\"But God demonstrates his own love for us in this: While we were still sinners, Christ died for us.\\" (Romans 5:8) The belief that Jesus' sacrifice is sufficient to atone for the sins of the world has several significant implications for Christian theology and practice. 1. The sufficiency of Jesus' sacrifice implies that no additional sacrifices or acts of penance are necessary for humans to receive forgiveness and reconciliation with God. Jesus' atoning work on the cross is believed to cover all sins – past, present, and future – for those who put their faith in him. Therefore, the concept of the \\"one and sufficient sacrifice\\" emphasizes the importance of faith in Jesus rather than religious rituals or human efforts to earn salvation. 2. The uniqueness of Jesus' sacrifice also means that he holds a central and exclusive role in the process of human redemption. In the New Testament, Jesus himself is recorded as saying, \\"I am the way and the truth and the life. No one comes to the Father except through me\\" (John 14:6). Consequently, Christianity teaches that faith in Jesus Christ is the only way to receive forgiveness and eternal life. 3. The belief in a single, perfect, and sufficient sacrifice for the sins of the world also underscores the magnitude of God's grace. Since Jesus' sacrificial death is seen as a divine act of love, mercy, and self-sacrifice, it inspires a sense of awe and gratitude among Christians. It often motivates them to share the message of Jesus and his saving work with others, as well as to live a life of compassion, love, and self-sacrifice.  It's important to note that the concept of the \\"one and sufficient sacrifice\\" for the sins of the world is specific to Christian theology and may not align with the beliefs of other world religions. For instance, in Judaism, the idea of a single, universal atonement is not present; instead, atonement is achieved through individual repentance, prayer, and acts of charity. In Islam, the concept of sacrificial atonement is even further removed, and salvation is based on the individual's submission to Allah and good deeds. In conclusion, according to Christian theology, we can affirm that \\"The one\\" – Jesus Christ – \\"was enough sacrifice for the sins of the world.\\" This belief has profound implications for understanding the nature of salvation, the role of Jesus in the redemption process, and the importance of faith in the Christian life. However, it's important to bear in mind that this concept may not hold the same significance or interpretation in other religious traditions."},{"instruction":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

Given the question: Process: - A person breathes in oxygen - The oxygen passes through the bronchial tubes to the lungs - The oxygen is moved into the bloodstream - Circulates through the body - The cells in the body exchange the oxygen with carbon dioxide - The bloodstream carries the carbon dioxide back to the lungs - The lungs expel the carbon dioxide through the nose and mouth.  Question: suppose bronchial tubes are damaged happens, how will it affect it results in a healthier body.  How does the supposed perturbation influence the second effect mentioned. Answer by more, less or no effect The answer is:","output":"Less effect. Step-by-step justification: 1. A person breathes in oxygen – This is the initial inhaling of oxygen by the person. The oxygen will enter the body through the nose and mouth before traveling to the bronchial tubes. 2. The oxygen passes through the bronchial tubes to the lungs – Here, the bronchial tubes play a crucial role in transporting the oxygen to the lungs. 3. Given that the bronchial tubes are damaged, the oxygen transport to the lungs will be hindered or reduced. This can cause inadequate oxygen supply to the lungs, which subsequently affects the efficiency of the entire breathing process. 4. The oxygen is moved into the bloodstream – If there is less oxygen reaching the lungs due to damaged bronchial tubes, the amount of oxygen that can be absorbed into the bloodstream will also be reduced. 5. Circulates through the body – The reduced amount of oxygen in the bloodstream will lead to a less effective circulation of oxygen throughout the body. 6. The cells in the body exchange the oxygen with carbon dioxide – Due to less oxygen being available, the cells will become less effective in exchanging oxygen for carbon dioxide. 7. The bloodstream carries the carbon dioxide back to the lungs – With less efficient cellular exchange, there might be a build-up of carbon dioxide in the bloodstream, which is carried back to the lungs. 8. The lungs expel the carbon dioxide through the nose and mouth – The lungs will continue to expel carbon dioxide, but the overall respiratory process will be less effective due to the damaged bronchial tubes. In conclusion, damaged bronchial tubes negatively affect the entire respiratory process, resulting in less efficient oxygen and carbon dioxide exchange. This leads to a less healthy body. The supposed perturbation, which is the damaged bronchial tubes, will have a less effect on the second effect mentioned (oxygen moving into the bloodstream)."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

The travelers didn't have much money: This indicates that they were most likely looking for an inexpensive mode of transportation. 2. They didn't have far to travel: This suggests that they needed a form of transportation for a relatively short distance. 3. Comparing the options:   a. Airport: Air travel can be expensive, and airports are typically associated with longer distances. This option does not match the criteria.   b. Coming home: This is not a mode of transportation.   c. Train station: Train travel can vary in cost, but it's not always budget-friendly. Also, the statement does not specify any information about train availability for their short distance.   d. Taxi station: Taxis are a convenient mode of transportation, but they can also be expensive. This option is not the most budget-friendly.   e. Bus depot: Bus travel tends to be an affordable and versatile mode of transportation, capable of transporting passengers over short distances. Therefore, based on the fact that the travelers are on a budget and need to travel a short distance, the most suitable option is E. bus depot."},{"instruction":"You are a teacher.

Input: Wendy 's old washing machine could only wash 8 pieces of clothing at a time . If she had to wash 39 shirts and 33 sweaters how many loads would she have to do ? Output:","output":"To solve the given math word problem, let's break it down into simple steps: 1. Understand the question: The task wants you to find out how many loads Wendy would have to do in order to wash 39 shirts and 33 sweaters in a washing machine that can only wash 8 pieces of clothing at once. 2. Use the given information: We know that Wendy's washing machine can wash 8 pieces of clothing at a time. We're also given the total number of shirts (39) and sweaters (33) Wendy needs to wash. 3. Apply mathematical operations as follows:    a) First, find the total number of clothing items Wendy has to wash. This can be done by adding the number of shirts and sweaters.       Total clothing items = Number of shirts + Number of sweaters       Total clothing items = 39 + 33    b) Calculate the sum from step 3a.       Total clothing items = 72    c) Now, divide the total number of clothing items by the number of clothes that can be washed in one load. This will give us the number of loads needed to wash all the clothes.       Number of loads = Total clothing items / Washing machine capacity       Number of loads = 72 / 8    d) As the washing machine can only wash whole loads (not a fraction of a load), if there's a remainder, we'll need to round up the result to the nearest whole number to account for the remaining clothes.       Number of loads = 9 (rounded up) 4. Report the final numerical answer: Wendy would have to do 9 loads to wash all 39 shirts and 33 sweaters."},{"instruction":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

The perturbation suggested, that is, \\"more coal is loaded into a truck,\\" is an event unrelated to the formation of stars or their natures.

It is to be distinguished from the county, which may encompass rural territory and/or numerous small communities such as towns, villages and hamlets. The term \\"municipality\\" may also mean the governing or ruling body of a given municipality. A municipality is a general-purpose administrative subdivision, as opposed to a special-purpose district. The term is derived from French \\"municipalité\\" and Latin \\"municipalis\\".  - Harald Berntsen ( born 25 January 1945 in Eidanger ) is a national historian and is active in the radical left in Norway .  - A parish is a church territorial unit constituting a division within a diocese. A parish is under the pastoral care and clerical jurisdiction of a parish priest, who might be assisted by one or more curates, and who operates from a parish church. Historically, a parish often covered the same geographical area as a manor (its association with the parish church remaining paramount).  - Eidanger is a rural parish and former municipality of Porsgrunn, in Telemark County, Norway.  - The municipality of Porsgrunn was established on 1 January 1838 (see formannskapsdistrikt). The town of Brevik and the rural district of Eidanger were merged into the municipality of Porsgrunn on 1 January 1964.  - Norway (; Norwegian: (Bokmål) or (Nynorsk); Sami: \\"Norgga\\"), officially the Kingdom of Norway, is a sovereign and unitary monarchy whose territory comprises the western portion of the Scandinavian Peninsula plus the island Jan Mayen and the archipelago of Svalbard. The Antarctic Peter I Island and the sub-Antarctic Bouvet Island are dependent territories and thus not considered part of the Kingdom. Norway also lays claim to a section of Antarctica known as Queen Maud Land. Until 1814, the Kingdom included the Faroe Islands (since 1035), Greenland (1261), and Iceland (1262). It also included Shetland and Orkney until 1468.

While the leader Danielle is used to getting what she wants, she is unable to attract lonesome ex-jock Drew (Jonathan Brandis) due to his mourning over the death of his girlfriend Charity Chase. Although Charity was believed to have committed suicide, this wasn't the case as Danielle, Tiffany and Brooke lured Charity to a cliff, hoping to terrorize her into breaking up with Drew, but ended up killing her by accident. A year to the day of Charity's death, Romanian foreign exchange student Katarina (Suzanna Urszuly) arrives during the class of clumsy Media Arts Professor Mr. Chauncey (Christopher Lloyd). Katarina and Drew immediately become friends. Jealous from this, Danielle tries to do everything in her power to stop this friendship developing into love. In an attempt to get close to Drew, Danielle works at the elderly home where Drew is also working. While there, she is assigned to look after an old lady (Janet Leigh) whom she believes is in a coma. Danielle, Tiffany and Brooke use this opportunity to raid the old lady's cupboard and eat her box of chocolates. In the following two weeks, the three girls begin to notice that something strange is happening to them, they are receiving back pains and their hair is turning gray - to their horror they discover that they are aging at a rapid speed.

Boult was born in Chester, Cheshire, in North West England, the second child and only son of Cedric Randal Boult (1853–1950), and his wife Katharine Florence née Barman (d. 1927). Cedric Boult was a Justice of the Peace and a successful businessman connected with Liverpool shipping and the oil trade; Cedric and his family had \\"a Liberal Unitarian outlook on public affairs\\" with a history of philanthropy. When Boult was two years old the family moved to Blundellsands, where he was given a musical upbringing. From an early age he attended concerts in Liverpool, conducted mostly by Hans Richter. He was educated at Westminster School in London, where in his free time he attended concerts conducted by, among others, Sir Henry Wood, Claude Debussy, Arthur Nikisch, Fritz Steinbach, and Richard Strauss. His biographer, Michael Kennedy, writes, \\"Few schoolboys can have attended as many performances by great artists as Boult heard between 1901 and October 1908, when he went up to Christ Church, Oxford.\\" While still a schoolboy, Boult met the composer Edward Elgar through Frank Schuster, a family friend.At Christ Church college at Oxford, where he was an undergraduate from 1908 to 1912, Boult studied history but later switched to music, in which his mentor was the musical academic and conductor Hugh Allen. Among the musical friends he made at Oxford was Ralph Vaughan Williams, who became a lifelong friend. In 1909 Boult presented a paper to an Oxford musical group, the Oriana Society, entitled Some Notes on Performance, in which he laid down three precepts for an ideal performance: observance of the composer's wishes, clarity through emphasis on balance and structure, and the effect of music made without apparent effort. These guiding principles lasted throughout his career. He was president of the University Musical Club for the year 1910, but his interests were not wholly confined to music: he was a keen rower, stroking his college boat at Henley, and all his life he remained a member of the Leander Club.

Also, they find that they are very lonely, and that they miss their homes. Because of these two reasons, most Asian parents decide to go back to work while their children study in the West. Therefore, these two reasons, most Asian parents decide to go back to work while their children study in the west. Therefore, these children become satellite kids\\", and most of their parents do not know how sad it is to be a \\"satellite kid\\". Only until now are Canadians and Americans discovering the \\"satellite kids\\" problem. Because these children do mot speak English and because their parents are not there to take care of them, they are often absent from school. To be a \\"satellite kid\\" means growing up in a country where you know you are different and where you cannot make friends because you do not speak English well. Also, it means growing up lonely, because your parents are elsewhere. What these \\"satellite kids \\"will probably say to their parents is that it's better to have parents around than to have a university education. ,.

Answer: Answer:","output":"Some Asian parents send their kids abroad because they believe that they can provide their children with a better education in Western countries like Canada and the United States. They find it difficult for their children to attend university in Asia due to strict national examinations, while it is comparatively easier to gain admission to universities in the West. However, these parents often go back to their home countries to work, leaving their children alone, which creates the \\"satellite kid\\" phenomenon."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Background: Sir Pelham Grenville Wodehouse  (; 15 October 1881 - 14 February 1975) was an English author and one of the most widely read humorists of the 20th century. Born in Guildford, the son of a British magistrate based in Hong Kong, Wodehouse spent happy teenage years at Dulwich College, to which he remained devoted all his life. After leaving school, he was employed by a bank but disliked the work and turned to writing in his spare time. Context: A third milestone in Wodehouse's life came towards the end of 1915: his old songwriting partner Jerome Kern introduced him to the writer Guy Bolton, who became Wodehouse's closest friend and a regular collaborator. Bolton and Kern had a musical, Very Good Eddie, running at the Princess Theatre in New York. The show was successful, but they thought the song lyrics weak and invited Wodehouse to join them on its successor. This was Miss Springtime (1916), which ran for 227 performances--a good run by the standards of the day. The team produced several more successes, including Leave It to Jane (1917), Oh, Boy! (1917-18) and Oh, Lady! Lady!! (1918), and Wodehouse and Bolton wrote a few more shows with other composers. In these musicals Wodehouse's lyrics won high praise from critics as well as fellow lyricists such as Ira Gershwin.  Unlike his original model, Gilbert, Wodehouse preferred the music to be written first, fitting his words into the melodies. Donaldson suggests that this is the reason why his lyrics have largely been overlooked in recent years: they fit the music perfectly, but do not stand on their own in verse form as Gilbert's do. Nonetheless, Donaldson adds, the book and lyrics for the Princess Theatre shows made the collaborators an enormous fortune and played an important part in the development of the American musical. In the Grove Dictionary of American Music Larry Stempel writes, \\"By presenting naturalistic stories and characters and attempting to integrate the songs and lyrics into the action of the libretto, these works brought a new level of intimacy, cohesion, and sophistication to American musical comedy.\\" The theatre writer Gerald Bordman calls Wodehouse \\"the most observant, literate, and witty lyricist of his day\\". The composer Richard Rodgers wrote, \\"Before Larry Hart, only P.G. Wodehouse had made any real assault on the intelligence of the song-listening public.\\"  In the years after the war, Wodehouse steadily increased his sales, polished his existing characters and introduced new ones. Bertie and Jeeves, Lord Emsworth and his circle, and Ukridge appeared in novels and short stories; Psmith made his fourth and last appearance; two new characters were the Oldest Member, narrating his series of golfing stories, and Mr Mulliner, telling his particularly tall tales to fellow patrons of the bar at the Angler's Rest. Various other young men-about-town appeared in short stories about members of the Drones Club.  The Wodehouses returned to England, where they had a house in London for some years, but Wodehouse continued to cross the Atlantic frequently, spending substantial periods in New York. He continued to work in the theatre. During the 1920s he collaborated on nine musical comedies produced on Broadway or in the West End, including the long-running Sally (1920, New York), The Cabaret Girl (1922, London) and Rosalie (1928, New York). He also wrote non-musical plays, including The Play's the Thing (1926), adapted from Ferenc Molnar, and A Damsel in Distress (1928), a dramatisation of his 1919 novel.  Though never a naturally gregarious man, Wodehouse was more sociable in the 1920s than at other periods. Donaldson lists among those with whom he was on friendly terms writers including A.A. Milne, Ian Hay, Frederick Lonsdale and E. Phillips Oppenheim, and stage performers including George Grossmith, Jr., Heather Thatcher and Dorothy Dickson. Question: What prompted him to go to Broadway?. Whats the answer?","output":"Sir Pelham Grenville Wodehouse was prompted to go to Broadway after his old songwriting partner Jerome Kern introduced him to the writer Guy Bolton in 1915. At the time, Bolton and Kern had a musical called \\"Very Good Eddie\\" running at the Princess Theatre in New York. Although the show was successful, they believed the song lyrics were weak and invited Wodehouse to join them for its successor titled \\"Miss Springtime\\" (1916).

Pastor Frank Pomeroy of the First Baptist Church of Sutherland Springs told leaders of the Southern Baptist Convention earlier this week that it would be too painful to continue using the church as a place of worship. Pomeroy, who lost his own 14-year-old daughter in the massacre, proposed turning the site into a memorial and building another church on a different site. The final decision on the fate of the building will be made by the denomination's top leaders, who traveled to the rural community in a show of support. But a national Southern Baptist spokesman said the pastor's wishes will be taken into consideration. Other sites of mass shootings have been torn down, including Sandy Hook Elementary in Newtown, Connecticut, where a gunman killed 20 children and six adults in December 2012. A new school was built elsewhere. A one-room Amish schoolhouse near Lancaster, Pennsylvania, was torn down in 2006, 10 days after an assailant took children hostage and shot and killed five girls ages 6 to 13. The original site of the school is now a pasture. A nearly identical schoolhouse with a security fence was erected nearby. Also Thursday, the father of the Texas gunman broke his silence to say his family is in mourning. Michael Kelley spoke to ABC News on Wednesday from his home in New Braunfels, about 55 kilometers north of Sutherland Springs. He refused to comment further, saying he does not want the \\"media circus'' surrounding the attack by Devin Patrick Kelley to destroy \\"our lives, our grandchildren's lives.''

Which of the following solutions is better for the following goal: How to fix a chair that has become wobbly.","output":"To fix a chair that has become wobbly, it is essential to first understand the root cause of the problem. Various factors could lead to a wobbly chair, including loose joints, worn-out parts, and uneven legs. Once you determine the exact cause, you can choose the most suitable solution. Here are two potential solutions to fixing the wobbly chair and an evaluation of which is better: Solution 1: Tighten the Joints and Screws Wobbly chairs often result from loose joints or screws. In this case, the solution is to tighten all the connections to ensure the chair is sturdy again. 1. Inspect the chair for any loose joints or screws. 2. Use the appropriate tools (such as a screwdriver or wrench) to tighten any loose connectors. 3. Ensure that all the screws are tightened firmly but be cautious not to overtighten or strip the screws. 4. Check the chair for any signs of wobbling after tightening the connections. Solution 2: Reinforcing or Regluing Loose Joints If the chair's joints are loose, they might not be easily tightened by simply using a screwdriver or wrench. In this scenario, reinforcing or regluing the joints can help fix the wobbly chair. 1. Remove the old glue or any debris from the loose joints. 2. Apply a suitable wood glue to the joints and reassemble the chair. 3. Clamp the joints together with bar clamps or other suitable clamping devices and let the glue dry for the recommended time – typically 24 hours. 4. Remove the clamps and ensure that the glue has fully bonded the joints together. 5. Test the chair for stability and wobbling. Evaluation: It's essential to choose a solution after identifying the root cause of the wobbly chair. If the issue is merely loose screws, then Solution 1 (tightening the joints and screws) is the simplest, quickest, and most appropriate solution. On the other hand, if the chair's problem lies in loose joints that cannot be tightened effectively, then Solution 2 (reinforcing or regluing the joints) is your best bet. This method may take longer, but it ensures that the chair is sturdy and secure. In conclusion, the better solution for fixing a wobbly chair depends on the root cause of the problem. It is vital to first inspect the chair for loose connections or worn-out joints to determine which solution is best suited for your specific situation. If you're unsure about how to proceed or lack the necessary skills, it is always advisable to consult a professional or someone more experienced in woodworking or furniture repair."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Article: There is no question that fewer teenagers are on the roads in the US. In 1978, 50% of 16-year-olds had got their first driving licence. In 2008, according to the US Transportation Department, it was just 30%. The number of those aged 19 and under with driving licences has also been _ since 1978, when 11, 989, 000 had licence. In 2010, it was 9, 932, 441, or 4.1% of American drivers. In the UK, 683, 273 teenagers have driving licences- just 1.85% of total licence holders, according to Department of Transport figures from September 2010. But the decline in the US may have more to do with tougher tests and the introduction of the new rule in many states, which force drivers aged under 16 to be with licensed drivers of 21 years and older when driving. In recent years, the annual number of journeys being made by American drivers of all ages has declined clearly for the first time ever. Car use began falling in 2007, when average petrol prices almost doubled to 4.12 a gallon, and the economy became worse. But there are signs that it is getting back to normal and American remains a country on wheels. It has a higher number of cars per head of population than any other country in the world. \\"Cars will always be a popular means of transportation in America. You have to take into consideration some places don't have access to public transportation. Cars are the only way some people can get around,\\" says Kristin Nevels. This makes driving necessary in some rural states, where about twice as many teenagers are on the road than in big cities. Question: What can be inferred from the text? Options: A: The UK has more teenager drivers than the US. B: A 15-year-old boy cannot drive alone in the US. C: The US has very developed bus transportation system. D: Big cities have more teenager drivers than rural areas in the US.","output":"The correct answer is B: A 15-year-old boy cannot drive alone in the US.

Brought my partner in due to having some concerns with a painful flare-up in the heart area. He had some heart trouble a few months back and spent a week in the hospital, so rather than waiting to see if it got worse, we decided it was best to get it checked out right away. Huge mistake coming to this urgent care! The entire staff was rude, seemed very unconcerned and kept us waiting (just to see the doctor on-duty) for 2 hours. It wasn't busy and very few people were in the waiting area. I'm writing this review because I was truly astounded by the lack of care, professionalism and concern the doctor had, once we were finally able to see her. As soon as she entered the room, she began asking questions and interrupting half way through my partner's answers to her. It was as if she didn't believe we were here out of true concern for his health; it seemed like she felt as if we were wasting her time or she had better things to be doing. Every question she asked was VERY condescending and her attitude was extremely unprofessional to the point where I just about had to leave the room to prevent myself from losing my 'cool' and patience.

Please answer the following question: Information:  - Canaan (Northwest Semitic: \\"\\"; Phoenician: ; Biblical Hebrew/ Masoretic: [\\"; nan]\\") was a Semitic-speaking region in the Ancient Near East during the late 2nd millennium BC. In the Bible it corresponds to the Levant, in particular to the areas of the Southern Levant that provide the main setting of the narrative of the Hebrew Bible, i.e., the area of Israel, Philistia, Phoenicia, and other nations.  - Tell Ashtara ( Arabic :    ) also Aštartu , was a site south of Damascus mentioned in the Amarna letters correspondence of 1350 BC. In the Amarna letters the city is named Aštartu , and is usually identified with the Biblical ' Ashteroth Karnaim ' . Aštartu is only referenced in two letters of the 382 letter corpus , in letters EA 256 , and EA 197 : ( titled : \`\` Biryawaza 's plight '' ) , - ( EA is for ' el Amarna ' ) . Biryawaza was the mayor of Damascus - called Dimasqu . EA 256 is a story concerning Mutbaal , the son of Labaya , and the Habiru , and concerns the whereabouts of Ayyab , who may be in Pihilu , modern day Pella , Jordan , and is a letter of intrigue , titled : \`\` Oaths and denials '' , and lists 7 cities located in the Golan area . Ayyab is the king of Aštartu and does author one letter to the Egyptian pharaoh , letter EA 364 .  - Ashteroth Karnaim was a city in the land of Bashan, east of the Jordan River, mentioned in and (where it is rendered simply as \\"Ashteroth\\"). The name translates literally to 'Ashteroth of the Horns', with 'Ashteroth' being a Canaanite fertility goddess, and 'horns' being symbolic of mountain peaks. It is possibly the same as Carnaim in First Maccabees and Carnion in Second Maccabees.  - Upper Egypt (', shortened to ' ) is the strip of land on both sides of the Nile that extends between Nubia and downriver (northwards) to Lower Egypt.  - Mesopotamia (\\"[land] between rivers\\"; from Ancient Armenian  (Mijagetq); \\"bild ar-rfidayn\\" \\"miyn rodn\\"; \\"Beth Nahrain\\" \\"land of rivers\\") is a name for the area of the TigrisEuphrates river system, in modern days roughly corresponding to most of Iraq plus Kuwait, the eastern parts of Syria, Southeastern Turkey, and regions along the Turkish-Syrian and IranIraq borders.  - The Levant (Arabic:  \\"\\") is an approximate historical geographical term referring to a large area in the Eastern Mediterranean. In its widest historical sense, the Levant included all of the eastern Mediterranean with its islands, that is, it included all of the countries along the Eastern Mediterranean shores, extending from Greece to Cyrenaica. The term \\"Levant\\" entered English in the late 15th century from French. It derives from the Italian \\"Levante\\", meaning \\"rising\\", implying the rising of the sun in the east. As such, it is broadly equivalent to the Arabic term \\"Mashriq\\", meaning \\"the land where the sun rises\\".  - Ancient Egypt was a civilization of ancient Northeastern Africa, concentrated along the lower reaches of the Nile River in what is now the modern country of Egypt. It is one of six civilizations to arise independently. Egyptian civilization followed prehistoric Egypt and coalesced around 3150 BC (according to conventional Egyptian chronology) with the political unification of Upper and Lower Egypt under the first pharaoh Narmer (commonly referred to as Menes). The history of ancient Egypt occurred in a series of stable kingdoms, separated by periods of relative instability known as Intermediate Periods: the Old Kingdom of the Early Bronze Age, the Middle Kingdom of the Middle Bronze Age and the New Kingdom of the Late Bronze Age.  - Damascus (' ) is the capital and likely the largest city of Syria, following the decline in population of Aleppo due to the ongoing battle for the city. It is commonly known in Syria as \\"ash-Sham\\" (') and nicknamed as the \\"City of Jasmine\\" (\\"\\"). In addition to being one of the oldest continuously inhabited cities in the world, Damascus is a major cultural and religious centre of the Levant. The city has an estimated population of 1,711,000 .  - Aleppo (/ ALA-LC: \\"\\") is a city in Syria, serving as the capital of the Aleppo Governorate, the most populous Syrian governorate. With an official population of 2,132,100 (2004 census), Aleppo was the largest Syrian city before the Syrian Civil War; however, now Aleppo is likely the second-largest city in Syria after the capital Damascus.  - Pharaoh is the common title of the monarchs of ancient Egypt from the First Dynasty (c. 3150) until the Macedonian conquest in 305 BC, although the actual term \\"Pharaoh\\" was not used contemporaneously for a ruler until circa 1200 BCE.  - Egypt (; ', , \\"Kimi\\"), officially the Arab Republic of Egypt, is a transcontinental country spanning the northeast corner of Africa and southwest corner of Asia by a land bridge formed by the Sinai Peninsula. Egypt is a Mediterranean country bordered by the Gaza Strip and Israel to the northeast, the Gulf of Aqaba to the east, the Red Sea to the east and south, Sudan to the south, and Libya to the west. Across the Gulf of Aqaba lies Jordan, and across from the Sinai Peninsula lies Saudi Arabia, although Jordan and Saudi Arabia do not share a land border with Egypt. It is the world's only contiguous Afrasian nation.  - The Jordan River (also River Jordan; \\"Nahar ha-Yarden\\"; \\"Nahr al-Urdun\\", Ancient Greek: , \\"Iordànes\\") is a -long river in the Middle East that flows roughly north to south through the Sea of Galilee and on to the Dead Sea. Israel and the West Bank border the river to the west, while the Golan Heights and Jordan lie to its east. Both Jordan and the West Bank take their names from the river.  - The Amarna letters (sometimes referred to as the Amarna correspondence or Amarna tablets) are an archive, written on clay tablets, primarily consisting of diplomatic correspondence between the Egyptian administration and its representatives in Canaan and Amurru during the New Kingdom. The letters were found in Upper Egypt at Amarna, the modern name for the ancient Egyptian capital of \\"Akhetaten\\" (el-Amarna), founded by pharaoh Akhenaten (1350s  1330s BC) during the Eighteenth dynasty of Egypt. The Amarna letters are unusual in Egyptological research, because they are mostly written in Akkadian cuneiform, the writing system of ancient Mesopotamia, rather than that of ancient Egypt. The known tablets total 382: 24 tablets had been recovered since the Norwegian Assyriologist Jørgen Alexander Knudtzon's landmark edition of the Amarna letters, \\"Die El-Amarna-Tafel\\", published in two volumes (1907 and 1915). The written correspondence spans a period of at most thirty years.  - Bashan (\\"ha-Bashan\\"; or Basanitis) is a biblical place first mentioned in , where it is said that King Chedorlaomer and his confederates \\"smote the Rephaim in Ashteroth\\", where Og the king of Bashan had his residence. At the time of the Israelites entrance into the Promised Land, Og came out against them, but was utterly routed. Bashan extended from Gilead in the south to Hermon in the north, and from the Jordan river on the west to Salcah on the east. Along with the half of Gilead it was given to the half-tribe of Manasseh. Golan, one of its cities, became a Levitical city and a city of refuge.  - Syria, officially known as the Syrian Arab Republic (\\"\\"), is a country in Western Asia, bordering Lebanon and the Mediterranean Sea to the west, Turkey to the north, Iraq to the east, Jordan to the south, and Israel to the southwest. Syria's capital and largest city is Damascus.  - Amarna is an extensive Egyptian archaeological site that represents the remains of the capital city newly established and built by the Pharaoh Akhenaten of the late Eighteenth Dynasty, and abandoned shortly after his death (1332 BC). The name for the city employed by the ancient Egyptians is written as Akhetaten (or Akhetatontransliterations vary) in English transliteration. Akhetaten means \\"Horizon of the Aten\\".  - Aten (also Aton, Egyptian \\"jtn\\") is the disk of the sun in ancient Egyptian mythology, and originally an aspect of the god Ra. The deified Aten is the focus of the religion of Atenism established by Amenhotep IV, who later took the name Akhenaten (died ca. 1335 BCE) in worship and recognition of Aten. In his poem \\"Great Hymn to the Aten\\", Akhenaten praises Aten as the creator, giver of life, and nurturing spirit of the world. Aten does not have a Creation Myth or family, but is mentioned in the Book of the Dead. The worship of Aten was eradicated by Horemheb.

While on one hand the Heian period was an unusually long period of peace, it can also be argued that the period weakened Japan economically and led to poverty for all but a tiny few of its inhabitants. The control of rice fields provided a key source of income for families such as the Fujiwara and were a fundamental base for their power. The aristocratic beneficiaries of Heian culture, the Ryōmin (良民 \\"Good People\\") numbered about five thousand in a land of perhaps five million. One reason the samurai were able to take power was that the ruling nobility proved incompetent at managing Japan and its provinces. By the year 1000 the government no longer knew how to issue currency and money was gradually disappearing. Instead of a fully realised system of money circulation, rice was the primary unit of exchange. The lack of a solid medium of economic exchange is implicitly illustrated in novels of the time.

Based on the premise \\"It seemed so simple, but her soup wasn't as clear as Robi's, and besides that, it was inedible.\\", can we conclude the hypothesis \\"The soup she cooked did not turn out like the recipe.\\" is true?","output":"Based on the premise provided, \\"It seemed so simple, but her soup wasn't as clear as Robi's, and besides that, it was inedible,\\" we can analyze different aspects to assess the validity of the hypothesis \\"The soup she cooked did not turn out like the recipe.\\" Firstly, the opening phrase \\"It seemed so simple\\" suggests that the individual in question expected the preparation of the soup to be straightforward and potentially easy to follow. This could imply that a recipe was in place, with which she hoped to replicate a successful result. The fact that she compared her soup to Robi's hints that there might have been a common reference point (i.e., a recipe) that both individuals were using in their soup-making process. Secondly, the comparison between her soup and Robi's indicates a disparity in the outcome. Her soup not being as clear as Robi's implies that something went wrong in her preparation, which led to a different visual appearance. This observation supports the hypothesis that the soup she cooked did not turn out like the recipe - at least, not to the extent of Robi's success. Lastly, the statement \\"it was inedible\\" makes it clear that her soup not only looked different but also was not fit for consumption. The key criterion for evaluating a recipe's successful replication is whether the final product fulfills its intended purpose, i.e., to be palatable. Since her soup was inedible, it indicates a failure in her attempt to achieve the desired outcome from the recipe. This further reinforces the hypothesis that her soup did not turn out like the recipe. In conclusion, the hypothesis \\"The soup she cooked did not turn out like the recipe\\" is indeed supported by the premise given. The comparison to Robi's soup, the unexpected lack of clarity in her soup, and the inedible end product collectively point towards a deviation from the recipe or a mistake during the preparation process. While more information could make this conclusion even stronger, the available evidence does support the notion that the individual in question was unsuccessful in replicating the recipe as intended."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant that follows instruction extremely well.

Born Asa Yoelson in 1886, Jolson was a Lithuanian-American singer, comedian, and actor. He was well-known for his dynamic performances and became a popular star in both Broadway and the movies. Known as \\"The World's Greatest Entertainer,\\" his career in show business spanned over 40 years. \\"The Jazz Singer\\" tells the story of Jakie Rabinowitz, who changes his name to Jack Robin, as he embarks on a journey to become a jazz singer. He must deal with the conflict between his dreams and his Jewish heritage, particularly his relationship with his cantor father. Produced by Warner Bros., it was the first feature-length film to incorporate synchronized speech, singing, and instrumental music on the Vitaphone sound-on-disc system, which made the film an essential part of the history of motion pictures. The film showcased Jolson's singing abilities and featured six songs, the most famous being the opening song \\"My Mammy\\" and \\"Blue Skies.\\" As Jack Robin, Jolson debuted \\"My Mammy\\" while wearing blackface, which was a controversial and now widely denigrated theatrical makeup technique, instituted to have white performers \\"appear\\" Black. Unfortunately, this racist tradition was common in that era, and Jolson, along with many other performers, partook in it. Today, it is essential to acknowledge this offensive aspect of the film while discussing its historical significance in the development of talking motion pictures. Overall, \\"The Jazz Singer\\" demonstrated the potential of synchronized sound in movies and paved the way for talkies, which led to the decline of silent films. Due to the film's massive success and the memorable lead role played by Al Jolson as Jack Robin, the movie cemented Jolson's place in entertainment history, and he became synonymous with the arrival of talking pictures."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

This has led to consistent calls and demands from both national and international communities for the prosecution of those responsible. In a bid to respond to the need for a fair and effective legal system, an increasing number of Sudanese lawyers are ardently studying and preparing to handle cases associated with war crimes trials. This development marks a pivotal moment in Sudan's journey towards justice, healing, and reconciliation after years of conflict and turmoil. The Importance of War Crimes Trials War crimes trials hold significant importance for societies emerging from violent conflicts such as Sudan. These trials represent an essential component of the broader transitional justice process that aims to address and remedy past human rights abuses, facilitate accountability, and initiate reconciliation amongst diverse communities. Importantly, war crimes trials can serve as a deterrent to potential future human rights violations and provide the basis for long-term peace and stability. In this context, the efforts of Sudanese lawyers ensure that the nation is equipped to tackle the sensitive and intricate legal challenges that such trials present. The Role of Sudanese Lawyers As Sudan transitions from its volatile past towards a path of healing, the role of Sudanese lawyers in the war crimes trials is multifaceted and encompassing. These lawyers, deeply committed to justice, focus on: 1. Legal Education: Acquiring a profound understanding of national and international laws surrounding war crimes, crimes against humanity, and genocide is a crucial step. Many Sudanese lawyers are embarking on advanced legal studies either in Sudan or abroad to better prepare themselves for these complex cases. 2. Capacity Building: Lawyers are working to strengthen their skills in areas such as evidence collection, witness protection, and advocacy. These efforts are aimed both at improving their individual abilities as legal professionals and ensuring that they contribute to the development of a capable and competent judicial system in Sudan. 3. Collaborating with International Experts: Sudanese lawyers are actively collaborating with international legal experts, organizations, and courts, such as the International Criminal Court (ICC), to learn from their experience in handling war crimes trials. This exchange of knowledge and assistance will bridge gaps in legal expertise and ensure that future trials adhere to international legal standards. 4. Engagement with Victims and Communities: Sudanese lawyers are engaging with victims and local communities to facilitate trust and support. By creating a secure platform where victims feel comfortable coming forward with their testimonies, lawyers are increasing the likelihood of successful trials that ultimately deliver justice to those affected. 5. Legal Reform and Advocacy: Given the complex nature of war crimes trials, Sudanese lawyers are advocating for legal reforms that would streamline the process and ensure a fair and efficient judicial system. These reforms, if effectively implemented, could pave the way for a more robust and independent judiciary. Challenges and the Way Forward Despite the dedicated efforts of Sudanese lawyers, multiple challenges remain. Limited resources, insufficient infrastructure, and a lack of political will can hinder the pursuit of justice. To overcome these obstacles, it is vital for the international community, national governments, and civil society organizations to come together in support of Sudan's journey towards reconciliation and justice. Financial and technical assistance, capacity building initiatives, and continued political pressure will be crucial in ensuring that Sudan can move past its painful history and establish enduring peace, stability, and prosperity. Conclusion The preparation of Sudanese lawyers for war crimes trials is a significant and promising step forward in addressing the nation's challenging past. Their dedication and pursuit of justice demonstrate a growing commitment to accountability and human rights. With the support of the international community and the unwavering efforts of Sudanese legal professionals, the country can chart a course towards a more just and peaceful future."},{"instruction":"Please answer the following question: SEOUL — Despite recent tensions over North Korea’s nuclear and missile tests, life is actually quite normal for American military families living at Camp Humphreys in South Korea, which is the largest overseas Army installation in the world. Lieutenant Colonel Joseph Puskas tries to come to most of his daughters’ high school soccer games at Camp Humphreys. In fact, his family’s lifestyle at this sprawling U.S. military base is similar to one they would lead back home. “We go to church on Sundays. We see all our friends there. We’re on the soccer field most of the afternoons, or just going for bike ride, the same things we would do if we were back in the States,” said Lieutenant Colonel Joseph Puskas, with the U.S. Eight Army. This is Puskas’ fourth tour in Korea. He met and married his Korean wife Mi-jung, during an earlier tour. His children have spent much of their lives at military bases in Korea. “I think it has given me a wider world view and has helped me understand other people a lot more,” said Elizabeth Puskas, the eldest daughter of the family who will attend college next year in the United States. The U.S. military in Korea is consolidating its forces in Camp Humphreys, including its military headquarters, as it moves to close older bases in congested Seoul and other regions of the country. Camp Humphreys is now the size of a small city, encompassing over 140 square kilometers of land, with construction underway to expand its capacity to accommodate over 40,000 people. There are modern apartments for soldiers and their families, schools, movie theaters, shopping centers and fast food restaurants to help bring some of the comforts of home to military life in Korea. The base even has its own golf course. “I have been around the army for part of the last 40 years as a soldier and now as a civilian, and this is as normal as any army post I’ve ever been on.

Second question: Can I use coconut oil to brush my teeth? Are these two questions asking the same thing?","output":"First question: Can coconut oil be used as a substitute for olive oil? Coconut oil and olive oil are both extracted from their respective sources; coconut oil is derived from the meaty part of the coconut, while olive oil is obtained from pressing whole olives. Both oils have a unique set of benefits and uses. As a substitute for olive oil, the performance of coconut oil depends on the specific application. When considering their use in cooking, there are a few factors to take into account: 1. Smoke point: Coconut oil has a lower smoke point than olive oil. Virgin coconut oil's smoke point is around 350°F (177°C), whereas extra virgin olive oil’s smoke point ranges from 375°F (191°C) to around 410°F (210°C). As a result, coconut oil may not be ideal for high-temperature cooking methods like deep frying or stir-frying, as it could lead to unpleasant flavors or the degradation of the oil. However, for low to moderate temperature cooking and baking, coconut oil can be a suitable substitute. 2. Taste: Coconut oil, especially virgin coconut oil, has a distinct coconut flavor, which may not always be an ideal choice when substituting for the mild or buttery taste of olive oil. For dishes where this distinct flavor may impact the overall taste, using refined coconut oil (which has a more neutral flavor) or another oil like vegetable or sunflower oil might be preferred. 3. Nutritional differences: Coconut oil is high in saturated fats, which can contribute to raising levels of LDL cholesterol (bad cholesterol), while olive oil contains more monounsaturated fats that can help lower LDL cholesterol and raise HDL cholesterol (good cholesterol). Consider your specific health and dietary needs when substituting one oil for another. Second question: Can I use coconut oil to brush my teeth? Yes, coconut oil can be used as an alternative option for brushing teeth. This practice is called \\"oil pulling\\" and is an ancient Ayurvedic technique. Typically, oil pulling involves swishing a spoonful of oil (often coconut, sesame, or sunflower oil) around in your mouth for an extended period – usually around 20 minutes – and then spitting it out. Coconut oil is a popular choice due to its antimicrobial properties from its high lauric acid content, which can help to reduce plaque-causing bacteria. Additionally, some people claim that oil pulling may help to whiten teeth, reduce bad breath, and improve overall gum health. It is important to note that while oil pulling may provide some dental health benefits, it should not completely replace traditional brushing and flossing methods. Furthermore, it's essential to consult with a dentist before incorporating oil pulling into your dental hygiene routine, as they can provide personalized recommendations for maintaining optimal oral health. Regarding your final question, although both questions are related to the use of coconut oil, they address different applications. The first question pertains to substituting coconut oil for olive oil in culinary contexts, while the second question explores the use of coconut oil for oral hygiene. The two questions are not asking the same thing, but instead illustrate the various roles that coconut oil can play in our daily lives."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Q:Information:  - Acanthostega (meaning \\"spiny roof\\") is an extinct genus of stem-tetrapod, among the first vertebrate animals to have recognizable limbs. It appeared in the late Devonian period (Famennian age) about 365 million years ago, and was anatomically intermediate between lobe-finned fishes and those that were fully capable of coming onto land.  - The Carboniferous is a geologic period and system that spans 60 million years from the end of the Devonian Period million years ago (Mya), to the beginning of the Permian Period, Mya. The name \\"Carboniferous\\" means \\"coal-bearing\\" and derives from the Latin words \\"carb\\" (\\"coal\\") and \\"fer\\" (\\"I bear, I carry\\"), and was coined by geologists William Conybeare and William Phillips in 1822. Based on a study of the British rock succession, it was the first of the modern 'system' names to be employed, and reflects the fact that many coal beds were formed globally during that time. The Carboniferous is often treated in North America as two geological periods, the earlier Mississippian and the later Pennsylvanian.  - Eogyrinus attheyi ( from Greek eos , meaning \`\` dawn '' , and gyrinos , meaning \`\` tadpole '' ) was one of the largest Carboniferous tetrapods , and perhaps one of the largest of its family , Eogyrinidae , at 4.6 metres ( 15 ft ) in length . Eogyrinus appears to have been a powerful swimmer that moved quickly through the water by swishing its long tail from side to side . It may have been a predator , lying in wait for prey in much the same way as a modern crocodile . It was a lightly built animal , weighing around 560 kilograms ( 1,230 lb ) . Although probably better at hunting in the water , Eogyrinus could probably have also made a grab for prey passing close by on land . Fossils of Eogyrinus are known from northern England . Recent studies by Jennifer A. Clack suggest that the amphibian Pholiderpeton described by Thomas Henry Huxley in 1869 is the same animal as Eogyrinus . If this is so , then Pholiderpeton 's name takes priority .  - Latin (Latin: ) is a classical language belonging to the Italic branch of the Indo-European languages. The Latin alphabet is derived from the Etruscan and Greek alphabets.  - The superclass Tetrapoda (Ancient Greek s tetrapods, \\"four-footed\\"), or the tetrapods , comprises the first four-limbed vertebrates and their descendants, including the living and extinct amphibians, birds, mammals, reptiles and some ancient, exclusively aquatic creatures such as the Acanthostega. Tetrapods evolved from the lobe-finned fishes around 390 million years ago in the middle Devonian Period, with modern tetrapod groups having appeared by the late Devonian, 367.5 million years ago. The specific aquatic ancestors of the tetrapods, and the process by which land colonization occurred, remain unclear, and are areas of active research and debate among palaeontologists at present.  - Eogyrinidae is an extinct family of large, long-bodied tetrapods that lived in the rivers of the Late Carboniferous period.

Given the question: Process:  - Water seeps into rocks - The water freezes and thaws - Cracks form in the rocks - Cracks also form when rocks heat up - The rocks slowly break down.  Perturbation hypothesis: suppose there has been more rain than usual happens, how will it affect MORE or FASTER weathering occurring.  Does the supposed perturbation have an effect (direct or indirect) on the process? The answer is:","output":"Yes, the supposed perturbation of more rain than usual can have both direct and indirect effects on the process of weathering, leading to more or faster weathering occurring. Direct effects: 1. Increased water seepage: With more rain, there will be more water seeping into rocks, which can further exacerbate the freeze-thaw cycle when the water freezes and expands. This can lead to wider and deeper cracks forming in the rocks. 2. Greater chemical weathering: More rainwater can enhance chemical weathering processes, as water acts as a solvent for many minerals. This can accelerate the breakdown of rocks when combined with physical weathering processes. Indirect effects: 1. Increased erosion: More rain can lead to increased runoff and erosion, which helps to transport broken-down rock material away from the weathering site. This can expose fresh rock surfaces that are more susceptible to weathering processes. 2. Vegetation growth: More rain can lead to greater vegetation growth, which can indirectly contribute to weathering through the action of plant roots expanding and breaking apart rocks. Overall, the perturbation of more rain than usual will likely accelerate the weathering process by increasing water seepage and enhancing both physical and chemical weathering, as well as indirectly by promoting erosion and vegetation growth."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

The full sentence is: \\"Sarah found the sound of the sax peaceful, but Maria found it grating.\\" This sentence showcases the difference in how individuals perceive the effect of a particular stimulus, in this case, the sound of the saxophone. For Sarah, the saxophone provides a sense of tranquility, inducing feelings of serenity and calmness. The word \\"peaceful\\" indicates a possible appreciation for the melody and the smoothness that the saxophone brings to the music it is played in. On the other hand, Maria has an entirely opposite reaction to the same sound. The word \\"grating\\" implies that Maria finds the saxophone sound to be irritating, perhaps to the point of being unbearable. This could be because she perceives the sound as harsh, discordant, or even as an annoyance that disrupts her focus or enjoyment in the moment. The contrast between these two reactions is intriguing, as it highlights the varying ways people experience and interpret sensory information in their environment. In this particular case, it emphasizes the subjectivity involved in an individual's preference towards sounds and music. It is also worth noting that the contrast allows the reader to contemplate the possible reasons behind the differing opinions. For example, one's musical background, genre preference, familiarity with the instrument, or even their emotional state at the time of listening might play a significant role in how they react to the sound of the saxophone. In conclusion, the sentence emphasizes the wide range of reactions and emotions that can be evoked by a single stimulus.

(LSC), a quasi-governmental agency that provides legal aid for the poor, would receive 329 million in fiscal 2004 under President Bush's proposal - the same amount requested in 2003 and approved for 2002 and 2001. If approved, the hold-the-line request for LSC means its budget would erode with inflation for another year, but it could be worse for the organization: Many conservatives fought for years to do away with the LSC altogether, saying legal services attorneys were spending too much time fighting for liberal causes or pursuing politically charged cases against the government instead of representing the needy. Opposition to the organization has cooled since 1996, when Congress approved restrictions (PL 104-134) on the sorts of cases federally funded legal aid attorneys can take. (1996 Almanac, p. 5-36) Republicans cut the organization's budget deeply in 1996, but its funding has recovered slowly. Last month, in the omnibus spending bill for fiscal 2003, the Senate added a onetime increase of 19 million, which, if approved in the final version, would bring the LSC budget to 348 million. The money would go to help states, such as Michigan and Ohio, that lost money when the organization redistributed its funding based on census counts made in 2000 of poor households. If the extra money survives a conference with the House and makes it to the president's desk, LSC supporters may try to include it in the organization's fiscal 2004 funding. The federal government began funding some programs to provide legal assistance to the poor in the late 1960s; the Legal Services Corporation was created in 1974 (PL 93-355). LSC gives nearly all its money to state and local agencies, which provide civil legal assistance to those whose income is less than 125 percent of the federal poverty level - 11,075 a year for an individual and 22,625 for a family of four. Funding for legal services goes to defend needy clients in domestic violence cases, custody cases and other such matters, according to LSC.

Which of the following is the supposed perturbation?  - directly impacting a step of the process - indirectly impacting a step of the process - not impacting any step of the process A:","output":"The supposed perturbation of hotter and dryer weather preventing rain can be considered as indirectly impacting a step of the process.  To better understand this, let's break down the process and understand how the perturbation affects it: 1. Some of the rock in the ground is made of limestone: The perturbation does not impact this step, as the composition of the ground remains unchanged regardless of weather conditions. 2. Over long periods of time, rain can hit the limestone: The perturbation does impact this step, as hotter and dryer weather would prevent rain or reduce the frequency and intensity of rainfall. This leads to less water interacting with the limestone, which is essential for the acidic reaction to occur. 3. And cause an acidic reaction: Since the amount of rain hitting the limestone is reduced, the acidic reaction will also be impacted. Although the potential for an acidic reaction still exists, it will likely occur at a slower rate due to the changes in weather conditions. 4. The limestone will slowly disintegrate: As the acidic reaction decreases due to the reduced rainfall, the disintegration of limestone will also be affected, but not directly. The process is still occurring, albeit at a slower pace. 5. A large gap will be where the limestone was: The formation of the gap relies on the disintegration of limestone. Since the disintegration of limestone is affected indirectly by the perturbation, the formation of a gap will also be indirectly impacted. 6. Result in the cave: Ultimately, cave formation would still occur but potentially at a slower rate or with smaller spaces forming, as the overall process is influenced by the changes in weather conditions that indirectly impact the process. In conclusion, the supposed perturbation of hotter and dryer weather preventing rain can be considered as indirectly impacting a step of the process, with consequences that reverberate throughout the entire process of cave formation due to the reduction of rainwater's interaction with limestone and the resulting acidic reaction."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Detailed Instructions: A ploynomial equation is a sum of terms. Here each term is either a constant number, or consists of the variable x raised to a certain power and multiplied by a number. These numbers are called weights. For example, in the polynomial: 2x^2+3x+4, the weights are: 2,3,4. You can present a polynomial with the list of its weights, for example, equation weights = [6, 4] represent the equation 6x + 4 and equation weights = [1, 3, 4] represent the equation 1x^2 + 3x + 4. In this task, you need to compute the result of a polynomial expression by substituing a given value of x in the given polynomial equation. Equation weights are given as a list. Q: x = 9, equation weights = [8, 2, 6] A:","output":"This task is asking you to evaluate a polynomial equation by substituting a given value of x. The polynomial equation is represented by a list of weights (coefficients), and you need to use these weights along with the given value of x to calculate the result. Here are the simple steps to perform this task: 1. Understand the polynomial equation: Look at the list of equation weights. These weights represent the coefficients of the variable x in the polynomial equation. Starting with x raised to the power of 0 (which is 1), increase the power of x by 1 for each weight in the list. For example, in this case, the equation weights are [8, 2, 6]. This represents the polynomial equation: 8x^0 + 2x^1 + 6x^2, which simplifies to: 8 + 2x + 6x^2. 2. Substitute the given value of x: Now, you are given the value of x (in this case, x = 9). Replace the variable x in the polynomial equation with this value. So, the equation becomes: 8 + 2(9) + 6(9^2). 3. Calculate the result: Perform the mathematical operations in the equation to get the result. In this case, the calculation should be: 8 + 2(9) + 6(81) = 8 + 18 + 486 = 512.

You will be given a task. You must generate a detailed and long answer. Would the following phrase be considered positive or negative? too campy to work as straight drama and too violent and sordid to function as comedy","output":"The phrase \\"too campy to work as straight drama and too violent and sordid to function as comedy\\" can be considered a negative statement about a piece of media, such as a film, play, or television show. This critique implies that the work in question does not perform well in either drama or comedy, making it challenging for the audience to enjoy or appreciate its intended purpose. When referring to a work as \\"too campy,\\" it means that the piece is overly theatrical, exaggerated, or kitschy, potentially detracting from the seriousness or believability of the drama. Campiness can be intentional, often used to create a fun, entertaining, or tongue-in-cheek experience. However, when a work is intended to be a straight drama, the presence of campy elements may disrupt the suspension of disbelief, preventing the audience from fully immersing themselves in the story. The critique then goes on to mention that the work is \\"too violent and sordid to function as comedy,\\" implying that it also fails to be an effective comedy. Violence and sordidness, when used in a comedy, should be carefully balanced, as excessive use of these elements can make it difficult for viewers to find humor or laugh. Comedy often relies on the ability to find amusement or lightness amid absurd or unfortunate circumstances. Therefore, when a work is overly violent or sordid, it may overshadow the comedic moments, rendering the work less successful as a comedy. In conclusion, the phrase \\"too campy to work as straight drama and too violent and sordid to function as comedy\\" can be considered negative when evaluating a piece of media. It implies the work's elements clash with one another, and it is unable to effectively fulfill the intended genre, whether it is drama or comedy, making it challenging for the audience members to enjoy or appreciate the work as a whole."},{"instruction":"Process: - Items that can be reused are placed into recycling containers - Recycling trucks pick up the items that are able to be reused - The recyclable items travel to a recycling plant - The items are sorted by what they are made of - The items are broken down into small parts - The small parts are melted to make new raw parts - The raw parts are sold to manufactures to make new items.

Top freestyle skier remains critical after surgery SALT LAKE CITY (AP) – Canadian freestyle skier Sarah Burke remained in critical condition Thursday after a successful operation to repair a tear to an artery that caused bleeding into her brain. In this 2009 file photo, Sarah Burke competed at the Winter X Games in Aspen, Colo. Burke was hospitalized Tuesday following a crash on the halfpipe in Park City, Utah. In this 2009 file photo, Sarah Burke competed at the Winter X Games in Aspen, Colo. Burke was hospitalized Tuesday following a crash on the halfpipe in Park City, Utah. Burke was placed into an induced coma to relieve stress on her brain after her accident Tuesday and had surgery the next day. \\"With injuries of this type, we need to observe the course of her brain function before making definitive pronouncements about Sarah's prognosis for recovery,\\" said William Couldwell, the neurosurgeon who performed the operation, in a statement released by Burke's publicist. \\"Our neuro critical care team will be monitoring her condition and response continuously over the coming hours and days.\\" Burke, a four-time Winter X Games champion in halfpipe skiing and one of the leading pioneers of her sport, injured herself while practicing on the halfpipe in Park City. She tore a vertebral artery, which are located in the neck and supply blood to the brainstem — the back part of the brain which controls consciousness. Tears can cause bleeding that disrupts blood flow to the brain, which in serious cases can lead to brain damage or death, said Dr. Andrew Naidech, medical director of the neuro-spine intensive care unit at Northwestern Memorial Hospital in Chicago. He said those tears can be caused by severe twisting motions or impact causing sudden up-and-down movement of the head. Outcomes depend on how badly the damage interrupted blood flow to the brain or caused extensive bleeding. Peter Judge, CEO of the Canadian freestyle team, said those who were near the superpipe when Burke fell told him it didn't look like a major accident at the time. Burke tried many of the toughest tricks in her sport and was the first woman to land a 1080 — three full revolutions — in competition. It was not known what move she was performing when the accident happened. Copyright 2012 The Associated Press. All rights reserved.

Pierre Benjamin Monteux (pronounced [pjɛʁ mɔ̃.tø]; 4 April 1875 – 1 July 1964) was a French (later American) conductor. After violin and viola studies, and a decade as an orchestral player and occasional conductor, he began to receive regular conducting engagements in 1907.  He came to prominence when, for Sergei Diaghilev's Ballets Russes company between 1911 and 1914, he conducted the world premieres of Stravinsky's The Rite of Spring and other prominent works including Petrushka, Ravel's Daphnis et Chloé, and Debussy's Jeux. Thereafter he directed orchestras around the world for more than half a century. From 1917 to 1919 Monteux was the principal conductor of the French repertoire at the Metropolitan Opera in New York. He led the Boston Symphony Orchestra (1919–24), Amsterdam Concertgebouw Orchestra (1924–34), Orchestre Symphonique de Paris (1929–38) and San Francisco Symphony (1936–52).  In 1961, aged eighty-six, he accepted the chief conductorship of the London Symphony Orchestra, a post which he held until his death three years later.  Although known for his performances of the French repertoire, his chief love was the music of German composers, above all Brahms. He disliked recording, finding it incompatible with spontaneity, but he nevertheless made a substantial number of records. Monteux was well known as a teacher. In 1932 he began a conducting class in Paris, which he developed into a summer school that was later moved to his summer home in Les Baux in the south of France. After moving permanently to the US in 1942, and taking American citizenship, he founded a school for conductors and orchestral musicians in Hancock, Maine. Among his students in France and America who went on to international fame were Lorin Maazel, Igor Markevitch, Neville Marriner, Seiji Ozawa, André Previn  and David Zinman. The school in Hancock has continued since Monteux's death.

Summarize this article: It follows a YouGov poll for the Times putting left-winger Mr Corbyn ahead in the race and Ms Kendall fourth. Senior Labour figures, including ex-PM Tony Blair and Lord Mandelson, have warned against a victory for Mr Corbyn. But Ms Kendall aides said suggestions she should back Andy Burnham or Yvette Cooper were \\"not going to happen.\\" Norman Smith, BBC assistant political editor, said \\"pressure has been mounting\\" on Ms Kendall to withdraw from the race. But our correspondent said aides to the Leicester West MP dismissed the calls, accusing Mr Burnham's and Ms Cooper's camps of \\"fuelling\\" the idea. One source said: \\"Both Andy and Yvette have seen their numbers fall this week following the flip flop over welfare and that's what is making these campaigns try and make Liz somehow the problem to distract from their own issues.\\" The source said that under the preference voting system it would not make any difference, even if Ms Kendall pulled out. The Labour leadership race has been the subject of widespread debate after a YouGov poll this week suggested that in the final round of voting Mr Corbyn could finish six points ahead of bookmakers' favourite Mr Burnham. The poll suggested Mr Corbyn could receive 43% of first preference votes, ahead of Mr Burnham on 26%, Ms Cooper on 20% and Ms Kendall on 11%. Taking second preferences into account, the poll - of 1,054 people eligible to vote in the contest and carried out between Friday and Tuesday - pointed to a 6% victory for Mr Corbyn. Speaking to the Times, Lord Mandelson warned the Labour Party's existence as \\"an electoral force\\" was at stake. \\"Those of us who stayed and fought to save the Labour party in the 1980s will be experiencing a growing sense of deja vu,\\" he told the Times. \\"The last five years have left us with a terrible legacy to overcome with the existence of the Labour Party as an effective electoral force now at stake.\\" On Tuesday, former prime minister Mr Blair warned Labour would not win again from a \\"traditional leftist platform\\". Mr Blair said Labour the leadership contest was being presented as a choice \\"between heart and head\\", but added that people who said their heart was with Mr Corbyn should \\"get a transplant\\". And former adviser to Mr Blair, John McTernan, told BBC Newsnight two of the candidates should withdraw in favour of an \\"anyone but Corbyn\\" candidate. Labour is due to announce its new leader at a special conference on 12 September.","output":"In the UK, the Labour Party leadership race is becoming increasingly divisive as front-runner Jeremy Corbyn's support seems to continue to grow despite warnings from senior party members, such as Tony Blair and Lord Mandelson, against Corbyn's left leaning politics. Some have called for the elimination of certain candidates, such as Liz Kendall, to stop the rise of Corbyn, however a recent YouGov poll suggested that even with Kendall pulling out of the race, Corbyn would still finish six points ahead of bookmakers' favourite Andy Burnham."},{"instruction":"You are a teacher.

Descriptions of Imogen as a small child indicate that she had blue eyes, fair hair, an oval face reminiscent of her father's, and a rather prominent nose inherited from her mother.  In 1912, at the age of five, she joined the kindergarten class at the Froebel Institute, and remained at the school for five years. Summers were often spent at the Holsts' rented country cottage at Thaxted in Essex, where Gustav Holst began an annual Whitsun Festival in 1916.In 1917 Imogen began boarding at Eothen, a small, private school for girls in Caterham, where Jane Joseph, Gustav's star pupil from SPGS, taught music.  A letter home, dated 17 July 1917, tells of \\"compertishions [sic], and ripping prizes, and strawberries and cream for tea\\".  At the school, Imogen studied piano with Eleanor Shuttleworth, violin with André Mangeot (described as \\"topping\\") and theory with Jane Joseph (\\"ripping\\"). Under Joseph's tuition Imogen produced her first compositions—two instrumental pieces and four Christmas carol tunes—which she numbered as Ops. 1, 2, and 3. In the summer term of 1920, she composed and choreographed a \\"Dance of the Nymphs and Shepherds\\", which was performed at the school under her direction on 9 July.Imogen left Eothen in December 1920 hoping to study under Ruby Ginner at the Ginner-Mawer School of Dance and Drama, but was rejected on health grounds, although there appeared to be no significant medical issue. She then studied at home under a governess, while waiting to start at St Paul's Girls School in the autumn. At Whitsun 1921 she took part as a dancer in her father's production of Purcell's semi-opera from 1690, Masque of Dioclesian, held in the St Paul's School grounds and repeated a week later in Hyde Park.In September 1921 Imogen began at St Paul's Girls School, and became a boarder from Spring 1922.

Perturbation hypothesis: suppose animal has a weak immune system happens, how will it affect MORE sugar and oxygen being produced.  Does the supposed perturbation have an effect (direct or indirect) on the process? A:","output":"The perturbation hypothesis you provided states that an animal has a weak immune system and is wondering if it will affect more sugar and oxygen being produced in plants. While both animals and plants are interrelated in the broader ecosystem, the direct effect of an animal's weak immune system on a plant's photosynthesis process (production of sugar and oxygen) is minimal or non-existent. Regardless, it's essential to understand the interconnected nature of ecosystems to see if any indirect effects may occur. An animal with a weak immune system may affect other animals, plants, and microorganisms in the ecosystem, causing a change in population dynamics. For example, if the weakened immune system leads to the animal's death, its decomposition could provide nutrients to the soil, promoting plant growth and indirectly influencing the production of sugar and oxygen through photosynthesis. Alternatively, a weakened immune system may make the animal less efficient in its role as a pollinator or seed disperser. This could indirectly affect plant populations and the overall health of the ecosystem. In turn, this might influence the total sugar production of plants in a particular area, although the perturbation would not directly impact individual plant cells involved in photosynthesis. Moreover, animals with weakened immune systems may have altered foraging or reproductive behaviors, which could have consequences for plant species and the ecosystem as a whole. For instance, if a large number of animals lose the ability to reproduce, the population could decline, affecting the plants that depend on these animals for pollination, seed dispersal, or as a food source for their predators. Another indirect effect could be observed if an animal with a weak immune system is more susceptible to infections or parasites, which can potentially spread to other animals or plants. This could indirectly affect plant health, potentially leading to a decrease in overall plant vigor and sugar production. In summary, the direct effect of an animal's weak immune system on the production of sugar and oxygen in plants is negligible. However, there could be indirect effects resulting from changes in the population dynamics of the ecosystem, such as alterations in animal behavior, population, and the spreading of infections or parasites. These indirect effects may influence plant health and overall sugar and oxygen production, although it is crucial to consider the complex nature of ecosystems when analyzing these potential impacts."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Found the following article online, use it to answer the question: What is the last name of the person who established the Institute of Archaeology as part of the federal University of London in 1934?  Sir Robert Eric Mortimer Wheeler (10 September 1890 – 22 July 1976) was a British archaeologist and officer in the British Army. Over the course of his career, he served as Director of both the National Museum of Wales and London Museum, Director-General of the Archaeological Survey of India, and the founder and Honorary Director of the Institute of Archaeology in London, in addition to writing twenty-four books on archaeological subjects. Born in Glasgow to a middle-class family, Wheeler was raised largely in Yorkshire before relocating to London in his teenage years. After studying classics at University College London (UCL), he began working professionally in archaeology, specialising in the Romano-British period. During World War I he volunteered for service in the Royal Artillery, being stationed on the Western Front, where he rose to the rank of major and was awarded the Military Cross. Returning to Britain, he obtained his doctorate from UCL before taking on a position at the National Museum of Wales, first as Keeper of Archaeology and then as Director, during which time he oversaw excavation at the Roman forts of Segontium, Y Gaer, and Isca Augusta with the aid of his first wife, Tessa Wheeler. Influenced by the archaeologist Augustus Pitt Rivers, Wheeler argued that excavation and the recording of stratigraphic context required an increasingly scientific and methodical approach, developing the \\"Wheeler method\\". In 1926, he was appointed Keeper of the London Museum; there, he oversaw a reorganisation of the collection, successfully lobbied for increased funding, and began lecturing at UCL.

Please answer this question: the best-case behavior of insertion sort is ____?","output":"The best-case behavior of insertion sort is O(n). Insertion sort is an elementary sorting algorithm that builds the final sorted array (or list) one item at a time. It is suitable for small and mostly sorted data sets. In the best-case scenario, the input array (or list) is already sorted in either ascending or descending order. Let's delve further into why the best-case behavior of insertion sort is O(n). When an array is already sorted, the insertion sort algorithm does not need to make any significant movement or adjustments to sort the array. Instead, it evaluates and compares adjacent elements in the array only once. As a result, the algorithm can complete its sorting process relatively quickly. Here's a step-by-step breakdown of the best-case behavior of insertion sort: 1. Begin with the second element in the sorted section of the array. 2. Compare the current element with the element(s) to its left in the sorted section. 3. In the best-case scenario, the current element is already in the correct position. Therefore, it is not necessary to move or swap any elements. 4. Move on to the next element and repeat the process of comparing and determining its correct position in the sorted section of the array. 5. Continue this process for all elements in the array. Since there are n elements in the array, the algorithm performs n - 1 comparisons. 6. As the best-case scenario requires no swapping or additional processing beyond these comparisons, the algorithm's complexity is determined to be O(n), making it linear. In summary, the best-case behavior of insertion sort is O(n) because the input array is already sorted, which minimizes the required comparisons and avoids any additional operations such as swapping elements. Note that this best-case scenario is uncommon in practice, but it highlights the efficiency of insertion sort when applied to already sorted or nearly sorted data sets."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Please answer the following question: Here's a question and a few possible answers:   Q: What is generally stored in a container can? Possible A: contain food, liquid, garage, container, pantry  Why is \\"liquid\\" an answer aligned with human common sense? Answer:","output":"\\"Liquid\\" is an answer aligned with human common sense because container cans are commonly designed to hold and store various types of liquids. The purpose of a container can is to provide a sealed, protective environment for its contents, such as preserving freshness or preventing spillage. Liquids, like beverages or certain household chemicals, often need to be stored in a secure, closed environment to avoid leaks and maintain their properties. Therefore, associating container cans with the storage of liquids demonstrates an understanding of the practical applications and common uses for these containers in everyday life."},{"instruction":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation. Think like you are answering to a five year old. Which entity is this text about? James was born in Holton, Kansas; his mother, died in 1954 when he was five. His father was a janitor and a handyman. After four years at the University of Kansas residing at Stephenson Scholarship hall, James joined the Army in 1971. He was the last person in Kansas to be sent to fight in the Vietnam War, although he never saw action there. In his Baseball Book 1990, James heavily criticized the methodology of the Dowd Report, which was an investigation (commissioned by baseball commissioner Bart Giamatti) on the gambling activities of Pete Rose. James reproached commissioner Giamatti and his successor, Fay Vincent, for their acceptance of the Dowd Report as the final word on Rose's gambling. (James' attitude on the matter surprised many fans, especially after the writer had been deeply critical of Rose in the past, especially what James considered to be Rose's selfish pursuit of Ty Cobb's all-time record for base hits.)  James expanded his defense of Rose in his 2001 book The New Historical Baseball Abstract, with a detailed explanation of why he found the case against Rose flimsy. James wrote \\"I would characterize the evidence that Rose bet on baseball as...well, not quite non-existent. It is extremely weak.\\" This countered the popular opinion that the case against Rose was a slam dunk, and several critics claimed that James misstated some of the evidence in his defense of Rose. Derek Zumsteg of Baseball Prospectus wrote an exhaustive review of the case James made and concluded: \\"James' defense of Rose is filled with oversights, errors in judgment, failures in research, and is a great disservice to the many people who have looked to him for a balanced and fair take on this complicated and important issue.\\"  In 2004, Rose admitted publicly that he had bet on baseball and confirmed the Dowd Report was correct. James remained steadfast, continuing to insist that the evidence available to Dowd at the time was insufficient to reach the conclusion that it did.","output":"This text is about James, who is also known as Bill James, a baseball writer and statistician. He is known for his work on analyzing baseball statistics and his opinions on various baseball-related matters.

Read this article and answer this question Looking to bounce back from a heartbreaking loss the previous week, the Patriots played a wild back-and-forth game against the rival Jets in what would be their only overtime contest of the season. The Patriots marched deep into their own territory on the opening drive of the game, but were forced to punt. The Jets responded with an 11 play, 75-yard drive, aided by a defensive holding penalty on Ras-I Dowling giving the Jets a first down, and scoring on a Shonn Greene 1-yard touchdown run. Devin McCourty returned the ensuing kickoff 104 yards for a touchdown. After a Jets three-and-out, the Patriots raced 58 yards in 7 plays, scoring on Brady's 17-yard touchdown pass to Gronkowski, taking a 14-7 lead. Two possessions later, Mark Sanchez fumbled the snap and kicked the ball out of the end zone for a safety, increasing the Patriots lead to 16-7 early in the second quarter. After a Patriots punt, the Jets drove to the Patriots 36, but Sanchez was intercepted by Dennard at the Patriots 2 for no gain. The Patriots drove to the Jets 45, but punted, as well. Starting at their own 5, the Jets raced to the Patriots 36, and Nick Folk nailed a 54-yard field goal, trimming the deficit to 16-10 at halftime. Joe McKnight returned the kickoff 37 yards to the Jets 32. With the decent starting field position, the Jets drove 66 yards to the Patriots 3, but the Patriots defense stiffened and forced the Jets to settle for Folk's 21-yard field goal, trimming the deficit to just 16-13. The Patriots countered on their next drive, putting together a 15 play, 67-yard drive in just under six minutes, converting three third-downs, and scoring on a two-yard touchdown pass from Brady to Gronkowski, extending the lead to 23-13. Two possessions later, the Jets engineered a 14 play, 91-yard drive, converting three third-downs, scoring on a 7-yard touchdown pass from Sanchez to Dustin Keller, trimming the deficit to 23-20. After a Patriots three-and-out, the Jets marched to the Patriots 25 and Folk tied the game with his 43-yard field goal. The situation turned to disaster for the Patriots when Lex Hilliard forced McCourty to fumble and Asher Allen recovered at the Patriots 18. Hightower sacked Sanchez for a 10-yard loss on third down and Folk kicked a 43-yard field goal, giving the Jets a 26-23 lead. Starting at their own 21, the Patriots marched 54 yards to the Jets 25 and Gostkowski tied the game on his 43-yard field goal as time expired. The Patriots received their opening kickoff of overtime, marching 54 yards to the Jets 30 and Gostkowski gave the Patriots the 29-26 lead on a 48-yard field goal.

Rather, he maintained, our beliefs are more a result of accumulated habits, developed in response to accumulated sense experiences. Among his many arguments Hume also added another important slant to the debate about scientific method — that of the problem of induction. Hume argued that it requires inductive reasoning to arrive at the premises for the principle of inductive reasoning, and therefore the justification for inductive reasoning is a circular argument. Among Hume's conclusions regarding the problem of induction is that there is no certainty that the future will resemble the past. Thus, as a simple instance posed by Hume, we cannot know with certainty by inductive reasoning that the sun will continue to rise in the East, but instead come to expect it to do so because it has repeatedly done so in the past.\\"  Answer: The answer to this question is:","output":"\\"The Earth.\\" The Earth appears mainly white from space, with a CIE color-space index near (0.3, 0.3). This information isn't mentioned in the provided context about Hume's philosophy and scientific method, hence it is an independent fact.
