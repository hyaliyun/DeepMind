The ring and backpack belong to Rick Best, one of two men slain in the attack, police said. Best, 53, was a father, Army veteran, city of Portland employee and onetime candidate for Clackamas County commissioner.      He was headed home to Happy Valley when he and others came to the aid of two girls who were the target of Jeremy Joseph Christian's racist vitriol, according to police and witnesses. Christian is accused of pulling a knife and striking three men who came to the girls' defense, killing two of them.      Police have released surveillance images and video of the suspect. The video shows him leaving the train while holding two backpacks — one of which belongs to Best and contained personal items that are important to his family, police said. Police don't know who the other backpack belongs to.      When asked whether Best was wearing the ring, a Portland police spokesman said detectives don't want to release specific information until they make an arrest in the case.      In a news release Thursday, police described the suspect as a man with a blond mullet who was wearing a Jordan baseball cap, black T-shirt with an image of Marilyn Monroe and an American flag, and black shorts and shoes.      They ask anyone who can identify the suspect or knows the location of the stolen items to email Detective Mitch Hergert at mitchell.hergert@portlandoregon.gov.      Police urge the suspect to call 503-823-3333 or go to the police bureau's Central Precinct if he wants to turn himself in.

The mention of \\"Indiana citizens\\" is possibly a mistake or confusion with \\"Indian citizens.\\" However, to provide some context, Tibetan Muslims, also known as Kachee or Kache, have been living in India, particularly in the region of Kashmir, after facing religious persecution in Tibet during the 1950s and 1960s due to the Chinese invasion of Tibet. Though they have been living as a minority in India for decades, the Indian government has provided relief and support to the Tibetan community. For instance, the Government of India established the Tibetan Muslim Refugee Welfare Office in 1960. Over time, they were granted Indian citizenship, with many being granted citizenship via the 1987 amendment to the Citizenship Act, which allowed those who entered India before 1962 from Tibet to apply for citizenship. This would apply to Tibetan Muslims as well. In summary, there is no specific year in which all Tibetan Muslims were declared \\"Indiana citizens,\\" possibly due to confusion with the term.

The spectrum of visible light can be seen in a rainbow because white light is","output":"broken down into its constituent colors. To explain this more clearly, we will delve into certain areas of science, mainly physics and atmospheric science: Step 1: Understanding White Light White light isn't just a single color. Instead, it's a combination of all the colors that we can see. This was first proven by Sir Isaac Newton, who used a prism to split a beam of light into its constituent range of colors, which is known as a spectrum. Step 2: Understanding How Light Refracts Just as light can bounce off mirrors (reflection), it can also bend when it passes from one medium to another. We call this bending 'refraction'. Different colors of light refract by different amounts. When white light hits a prism, the different colors bend by various amounts, causing them to spread out and form a rainbow or spectrum of colors. Step 3: The Role of Raindrops A similar process occurs in the atmosphere with the tiny droplets of water that make up mist or a cloud, or falling as rain. When sunlight intersects a droplet, it may refract, or bend, within the droplet, breaking apart into its individual component colors. This is because the beam of light is made up of different colors, each of which is bent slightly differently as they pass through the droplet.  Step 4: Reflection and Exit of Light from Raindrops After refraction, light hits the inside of the droplet and reflects back out (internal reflection). In doing so, it refracts again. Just like in a prism, this refraction causes the colors to spread out more and form a visible spectrum. Final Step: The Rainbow  An observer seeing the droplets from an angle will see the refraction as bands of color in the shape of the arc - what we call a rainbow. Thus, the spectrum of visible light can be seen in a rainbow because white light is broken down into its constituent colors through the process of refraction, reflection and then refraction again in the raindrops."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

The terrorist leader was killed by U.S. Navy SEALs in a raid on his compound in Abbottabad, Pakistan in May. The operation was carried out without the cooperation of Pakistani authorities.      \\"Don't forget, this compound had 18-foot walls. It was the largest compound in the area. So you would have thought that somebody would have asked the question, ‘What the hell's going on there?’” said Panetta.      Pakistan's government has denied knowing that bin Laden was hiding in a military garrison town 30 miles from the capital city of Islamabad.      Panetta said the U.S. did not alert the Pakistanis to the secret operation because of fears they might tip off the elusive bin Laden.      \\"We had seen some military helicopters actually going over this compound,\\" said Panetta.      \\"It concerned us that... they might... give bin Laden a heads up.\\"      Panetta added, \\"I don't have any hard evidence, so I can't say it for a fact.

And he was not in any way treasonous towards Pakistan.\\"      Dr. Shakeel Afridi helped the CIA use a vaccination campaign to collect DNA samples from residents of bin Laden's to verify the terror leader's presence there.      Pakistan, which expressed its anger over the raid without consulting Pakistani authorities, has charged Afridi with treason.      \\"Pakistan and the United States have a common cause here against terrorism, have a common cause against al Qaeda,\\" Panetta said. \\"And for them to take this kind of action against somebody who was helping to go after terrorism, I just think is a real mistake on their part.\\"      Panetta said Pakistan can discipline Afridi in whatever manner it deems appropriate but the doctor should be released.      Many analysts felt U.S. officials had kept quiet about Afridi so as to not implicate him.      Panetta also told CBS that he remains convinced that someone in authority in Pakistan knew that bin Laden was hiding in the city of Abbottabad, a largely military community outside the capital, Islamabad.      He said there were intelligence reports of Pakistani helicopters passing over the bin Laden compound. He also questioned why the Pakistanis would not notice the vast complex with 18-foot walls.      \\"So you would have thought that somebody would have asked the question, 'What the hell's going on there?'\\" Panetta said. \\"I personally have always felt that somebody must have had some sense of what was happening at this compound.\\"      Panetta said the United States chose not to inform Pakistan of the raid due to security concerns.      \\"We had seen some military helicopters actually going over this compound.

Like others, I have seen and studied most of the books and films concerning the Clutter Killings, including a few dramatic works thematically based on the actions and psycho-mythology of the participants to the crime -- including Capote himself. As to Capote, I cannot forgive him for willfully withholding Perry Smith's confessions, intimacies and writings from even the defense counsels. I believe truths and facts Capote \\"reserved\\" for his \\"book,\\" which required for Capote two guilty verdicts and capital punishment, would almost certainly have sustained a successful insanity defense for Perry Smith even under the old McNaughton Rule. Capote himself could never write another major literary work after \\"In Cold Blood.\\" Shame and guilt. In my opinion, he willingly encouraged and planned the brutal capital punishment to provide the spectacular ending he required for his book/drama. To him, both men HAD to die for his book to succeed. The book had to justify itself by pretending it was about the horror of capital punishment. His actions and silence assured that ice-cold conclusion. Capote's book is not truth. It is not factual or journalistic. It is drama and melodrama spiced with his own creatively psychotic imagination. What most people consider the virtues of the contemporaneous first movie are stark images of Capote's mind, which may have been the most cold-blooded aspect of all. No wonder viewers ironically but necessarily prefer Blake's performance. That actor IS the nightmare from Capote's dishonest imaginings. So who is to say how the two killers should be played? Who is to judge what could make an essentially poetic psychotic snap from excessive courtesy and kindness to \\"do it now\\" killing? I agree with the few who see in Eric Roberts' work a magnificent performance, Shakespearean in its range, yet played with heartbreaking sincerity. Anthony Edwards takes a much safer \\"attitude mode\\" to create a smarmy Hickok; but he is one-dimensional and boring, with only a few notes in his television range. Roberts is almost four-dimensional, adding physical weakness and agony to a powerful animal body, a Frankenstein Creature who thinks in poetry and knows exactly what NOT to do. Like Leopold apropos Loeb, Robert's Perry Smith is hopelessly in love with an evil man. Without Hickok or a man of his particularities, Perry Smith would not have brought his psychotic mind into a world of horrors. He fears himself more than he fears anything else in life. Given the freedom from Capote's death grip on the consciousness of the Clutter killings, Roberts and Edwards are free to create original personalities and psychoses to craft a different and new production of the drama. Same facts, some of the same lines from the case record, but deeper, more complex, with clearly titanic psychotic stresses -- indeed Roberts is so good at this fluidic madness that he physically and facially demonstrates in every moment how little awareness he has of where or who he is. What many of our reviewers dislike about this film, Roberts in particular, is that cold-blooded killing isn't shown the way they expect and have been manipulated to demand. That is because here we are seeing a far more profoundly realistic \\"interpretation of life and death\\" than Capote could ever create -- a real Tragedy. The actual cold-blooded killer, Mr. Capote, and his hypocritically artistic \\"non-fiction novel\\" do not control these interpretations and performances. If \\"In Cold Blood\\" and Capote's effect on life, literature and truth matters as much as scholars say, then it takes guts as well as talent to portray the truth, or a version of the truth, that is not the rank, cowardly lie drawn up from the fathoms of Capote's own abyss.

Given the question: Q: The deepest region of the adrenal cortex is the zona reticularis, which produces small amounts of a class of steroid sex hormones called what?    Choices:  - estrogen  - dioxins  - testosterone  - androgens  A: The answer is:","output":"Androgens. The adrenal cortex, which is a part of the adrenal glands, is primarily comprised of three distinct layers or zones, each responsible for producing its own set of hormones. The three zones of the adrenal cortex, starting from the outermost to the innermost, are the zona glomerulosa, zona fasciculata, and the zona reticularis. The deepest layer, the zona reticularis, is known to synthesize and release a class of steroid sex hormones called androgens. Androgens function as the precursor hormones for both male and female sex hormones, which mainly include testosterone and estrogen respectively. In men, androgens are responsible for regulating the development and maintenance of secondary male sexual characteristics, such as facial hair, body hair, muscle growth, and deepening of the voice, just to name a few. In women, androgens are essential for maintaining proper physiological functioning by facilitating the production of estrogens, which play a vital role in regulating the menstrual cycle and maintaining overall bone health. Androgens produced by the zona reticularis most commonly include dehydroepiandrosterone (DHEA) and androstenedione. These steroid hormones form the building blocks for the synthesis of more potent sex hormones like testosterone and estrogen. DHEA and androstenedione production by the zona reticularis is regulated by the secretion of adrenocorticotropic hormone (ACTH) from the pituitary gland. When the body requires a higher production of steroid hormones, ACTH levels are increased, leading to a surge in androgen production within the zona reticularis. Furthermore, although androgens are predominantly produced by the gonads—testes in men and ovaries in women—it is important to recognize that the adrenal cortex, specifically the zona reticularis, plays a significant role in the production of the body's required androgens. To summarize, the deepest region of the adrenal cortex, the zona reticularis, is responsible for producing small amounts of a class of steroid sex hormones called androgens. These hormones function as precursors for the male and female sex hormones and are crucial for maintaining a healthy balance of the body's sexual functions and characteristics."},{"instruction":"Pick your answer from: i.

A dark-haired woman (Harring) escapes her own murder, surviving a car accident on Mulholland Drive. Injured and in shock, she descends into Los Angeles and sneaks into an apartment that an older, red-headed woman has just vacated. An aspiring actress named Betty Elms (Watts) arrives at the same apartment and finds the dark-haired woman confused, not knowing her own name. The dark-haired woman assumes the name \\"Rita\\" after seeing a poster for the film Gilda (1946), starring Rita Hayworth. To help Rita remember her identity, Betty looks in Rita's purse, where she finds a large amount of money and an unusual blue key. In what seems to be a scene from a different narrative, set at a diner called Winkies, a man (Patrick Fischler) tells his companion (Michael Cooke) about a nightmare in which he dreamt there was a horrible figure behind the diner. When they investigate, the figure appears, causing the man with the nightmare to collapse in fright. As the principal narrative resumes, Hollywood director Adam Kesher (Justin Theroux) has his film commandeered by apparent mobsters, who insist he cast an unknown actress named Camilla Rhodes (Melissa George) as the lead in his film. After he resists, he returns home to find his wife having an affair and is thrown out of his house. He later learns that his bank has closed his line of credit and he is broke. He agrees to meet a mysterious figure called The Cowboy, who urges him to cast Camilla Rhodes for his own good. Later, a bungling hit man (Mark Pellegrino) attempts to steal a book full of phone numbers and leaves three people dead.

Q: Read the following article and answer the question. Article: Bali is a tiny island that is part of Indonesia  today. It is a pretty island that has many mountains and a pleasant climate. For a long time, Bali was cut off from much of the world. The people of Bali were happy and had a peaceful life. They were not allowed to fight. At one time there had been terrible wars on Bali. Then the people decided it was wrong to fight or have wars. They made rules to keep apart those people who wanted to fight. Bali was divided into seven small kingdoms. The land around each kingdom was kept empty, and no one lived there. Since the kingdoms did not share the same borders , the people could not fight about them. On Bali, even children were not allowed to fight. If two children started a fight over a toy, someone separated them. When two boys argued, they would agree not to speak to each other. Sometimes they did not talk together for months; this gave the boys a chance to forget their anger. Families who were angry with each other also promised not to speak. Their promise was written down, and the whole village knew about it. If they broke their promise, they had to offer gifts to their gods.

Answer the following question: WASHINGTON — When Democratic presidential nominee Hillary Clinton announced her vice presidential choice, she referred to Virginia Senator Tim Kaine as a progressive who is \\"everything Donald Trump and Mike Pence are not.” Timothy Michael \\"Tim\\" Kaine was born on February 26, 1958, in St. Paul, Minnesota, but grew up in the metro area of Kansas City, Missouri. He is the eldest son of an ironworker and a home economics teacher. Kaine attended an all-boys Jesuit high school, joining spring mission drives to fund Jesuit activities in Honduras. He went on to earn a bachelor's degree in economics from the University of Missouri before entering Harvard Law School. Kaine took time off from his law studies to work with the Jesuit Volunteer Corps in Honduras for nine months in 1980-81, helping Jesuit missionaries who ran a Catholic school in El Progreso. His time there reportedly helped form his support for citizenship for undocumented immigrants in the United States – a stance likely to attract Latino voters. He also learned to speak fluent Spanish, seen as a possible advantage with Hispanic voters. At Harvard, Kaine met his wife, Anne Holton, the daughter of former Republican Virginia Governor Linwood Holton (1970-74), who desegregated the commonwealth's public schools. She now serves as Virginia's secretary of education. They have three children. After law school, the Kaines settled in Richmond, Virginia, where he spent nearly two decades as an attorney focusing on civil rights and fair housing. He helped found the Virginia Coalition to End Homelessness and was a board member of the Virginia chapter of Housing Opportunities Made Equal. Kaine entered politics in 1994 when he was elected to the Richmond City Council, then became the city's mayor. Virginia's voters chose him as their lieutenant governor in 2001. Four years later, he ran for governor against Republican candidate Jerry Kilgore, a former state attorney general. Considered an underdog, Kaine trailed in polls for most of the election but won the race. He... Question: What job did Timothy Kaine likely enjoy the most? === The answer to the above question is Answer:","output":"It is difficult to definitively determine which job Timothy Kaine likely enjoyed the most, as personal preferences and experiences can vary greatly. However, considering his background, activities, and accomplishments, it's possible to identify some roles that may have been particularly significant or rewarding for him. One of these roles could be Kaine's time working with the Jesuit Volunteer Corps in Honduras. As a young man, he took a break from his law studies to spend nine months volunteering with Jesuit missionaries. This experience not only helped shape his worldviews, but also solidified his fluency in Spanish and deepened his connection to Hispanic communities. Kaine's commitment to social justice and his ability to reach across cultural boundaries might suggest that this period of his life was highly fulfilling and personally transformative. Another role that Kaine may have found especially rewarding was his work as an attorney focusing on civil rights and fair housing. He spent nearly two decades in this field after completing his law degree, which allowed him to directly address systemic inequalities and improve opportunities for marginalized communities. By playing an integral role in founding the Virginia Coalition to End Homelessness and serving on the board of the Virginia chapter of Housing Opportunities Made Equal, Kaine further demonstrated his passion for these issues, making this portion of his career likely to be personally meaningful. From a political standpoint, Kaine's tenure as the Governor of Virginia could be seen as his most enjoyable. Having had experience as a city council member, mayor, and lieutenant governor, Kaine was no stranger to political life. As governor, he was able to make substantive and lasting changes to the state, leaving a mark on Virginia's history. This position provided Kaine with the opportunity to tackle issues he was passionate about, ranging from education to immigration, which might have made his role as governor both enjoyable and impactful. In conclusion, while there is no definitive answer as to which job Timothy Kaine enjoyed the most, his time as a Jesuit volunteer, his work as an attorney in civil rights and fair housing, and his role as Governor of Virginia could all be seen as especially significant and rewarding roles throughout his life and career."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

First, we want both \\"c\\" terms to be on one side of the equation. We can do this by subtracting 66*c from both sides. This gives us:    -1211 = 289*c - 66*c - 4556 2. Now, we simplify. Let's combine the \\"c\\" terms: 289*c - 66*c = 223*c. So the equation becomes:    -1211 = 223*c - 4556 3. Next, we want to get rid of that -4556 on the right side of the equation. To do that, we can add 4556 to both sides:    -1211 + 4556 = 223*c 4. Now, we simplify again. When you add -1211 and 4556, you get 3345:    3345 = 223*c 5. Now, we want to find the value of \\"c.\\" To do that, let's divide both sides of the equation by 223:    3345 ÷ 223 = c 6.

Many of these edits can be made on your phone without using an app, but you might want to look into the dozens of apps available for this purpose. That said, you should use photo editing sparingly. If you cannot make your edits look completely natural, err on the side of caution and delete the changes rather than posting an obvious fake. Share your selfie on Facebook, Twitter, Snapchat, and Instagram for all your friends to see. In most cases you can add a caption to describe what's happening in the picture, but you might want to just let it speak for itself.  When you upload a selfie, own it! Pretending that you were taking a picture of something else and your face just happened to be there, won't fool anyone, so be proud to show off your lovely face. Be aware that some people find selfies annoying, and you might draw some negative comments. If your online albums end up full of selfies, you might want to consider diversifying. Be sure to leave the types of comments you want to see on other people's selfies. The more \\"likes\\" and shares you give others, the more you'll get. Selfies have really taken off in the past few years, and it's fun to participate in selfie-related trends. What selfie trends are filling up your feed? Don't be shy about uploading some pictures of your own, too. Here are a few popular ones:  Throwback Thursdays: Every Thursday, people post pictures of themselves from an earlier time. See if you can dig up a selfie from childhood, or simply post one from last week! From Where I Stand: This hashtag was created by people who wanted to share poignant shots from their own perspectives. Take a picture of your feet as you stand in a country you're visiting for the first time, on the beach, on a cracked city sidewalk or anywhere else you want to share.  Feminist Selfie: This hashtag started trending on Twitter and really took off. It's about being proud to post your picture even if you aren't stereotypically gorgeous. Beauty comes in all shapes and sizes. Hair Smile: This one's all about showing off your hair. If you consider it to be your greatest asset, take a selfie featuring your hair instead of your smile. There are some places that should be completely off-limits to selfies, like funerals or the scene of an accident. Most situations like this are pretty common sense, but as a general rule, ask yourself if taking a selfie in a given situation could upset or offend people who see it. If the answer is “yes,\\" save your selfie for another time.  Funerals, weddings, and other major occasions are off limits. If you are at an event meant to focus on or celebrate another human being, put down your smart phone and step out of the limelight. Similarly, if you are at a memorial site, keep the phone in your pocket. Don't take selfies at a memorial or statue, especially if a tragic event took place there once before. Summary:","output":"1. Experiment with different filters and photo editing apps to enhance the look of your selfie. Stick to natural-looking edits and avoid over-editing the photo. 2. Share your selfie on social media platforms and engage with other people's selfies by liking and commenting on them. 3. Participate in selfie-related trends like Throwback Thursdays, From Where I Stand, Feminist Selfie, and Hair Smile. 4. Be mindful of the situations in which you take selfies, avoiding places and events where it could be inappropriate or offensive, such as funerals, weddings, and memorial sites."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Summarize: Fifteen principals from schools in Comber and Newtownards have written a joint letter urging parents to contact the authorities over school budgets. The letter said spending cuts will mean fewer teachers and resources, larger classes and worse education outcomes. It urged parents to contact MLAs, the Department of Education and the Education Authority about the issue. \\"We all strongly believe that parents and guardians should know of the current and future financial difficulties that face all schools in the area,\\" they wrote. However, a spokesperson for the Department of Education said that \\"providing financial assistance to schools\\" had been one of the Education Minister Peter Weir's priorities. The principals' letter said that each school represented was facing a \\"crisis, no matter how strong the enrolment or how big or small the school\\". \\"In the past five years the money given to school per child has only risen by 0.9% whilst costs have risen by approximately 14.5%,\\" it said. \\"This dire financial situation is not being addressed by either the Department of Education or the Education Authority. \\"The impact is real, urgent and disastrous.\\" In response, a DE spokesperson said Mr Weir had taken measures to ease financial pressures on schools. \\"The minister proactively reviewed the overall education budget and reallocated over Â£7m of new funding to the 2016-17 schools budget,\\" they said. \\"2017-18 budgets have not yet been agreed. \\"The 2017-18 budget outcome for all departments, including education, will depend on the decisions taken by an incoming administration.\\" In January, Mr Weir told the Northern Ireland Assembly that schools needed an extra Â£240m over the next three years just to maintain spending at 2015/16 levels.

Bennett died in 1892 , and Langdon Hubbard took over the mill . Do these two sentences convey the same information?","output":"No, these two sentences do not convey the same information. There are important differences in the details provided in each sentence that can potentially cause confusion or misinterpretations. Sentence 1: \\"In 1892, William H. Bennett and Langdon Hubbard died the mill.\\" The meaning of this sentence is somewhat unclear because the verb \\"died\\" appears to be misused. Assuming the intended verb is \\"built\\" or \\"purchased,\\" the sentence suggests that in 1892, both William H. Bennett and Langdon Hubbard contributed to the formation or ownership of the mill – potentially as co-owners or partners. The corrected version of this sentence could be: \\"In 1892, William H. Bennett and Langdon Hubbard built the mill.\\" or \\"In 1892, William H. Bennett and Langdon Hubbard purchased the mill.\\" Sentence 2: \\"William H. Bennett died in 1892, and Langdon Hubbard took over the mill.\\" This sentence is clear in its meaning. It conveys that William H. Bennett passed away in 1892, and Langdon Hubbard subsequently assumed control of the mill. The information provided in this sentence indicates that William H. Bennett was likely the original owner or operator of the mill, and upon his death, the ownership or management responsibilities were transferred to Langdon Hubbard. In conclusion, the two sentences present different scenarios based on their details. Sentence 1 (with the assumed correction) suggests both individuals were involved in the creation or acquisition of the mill in 1892, while Sentence 2 conveys that Langdon Hubbard took over the mill upon William H. Bennett's death in the same year. The information is not identical, and the context and events described in each sentence are distinct."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Given the question: WASHINGTON — In 2004, Desmond Meade, while serving a 15-year prison sentence for a drug offense in Florida, got a break. An appeals court returned his conviction to the original trial bench, allowing him to plead guilty to a lesser charge and get out of prison in three years, most of which he had already served. But his freedom came with a price, something that didn’t quite register with him at the time: as part of his plea agreement with prosecutors, Meade agreed to give up his civil rights: the right to vote, to serve on a jury and to run for office. “At the time, when I first accepted the plea deal, I didn’t understand the consequences,” Meade says. Fourteen years and a pair of college and law degrees later, Meade, now 50, still can’t vote; his application to regain his civil rights was rejected in 2011. The reason: a new Florida law that requires felons like him to wait for seven years before they could apply for rights restoration. Home to nearly a quarter of the nation's disenfranchised felons, Florida has become a battleground in a national debate over felony disenfranchisement laws. With lawmakers deeply divided over the issue, Meade says he wants the state’s voters to change the system when they head to the polls on Nov. 6. He’s promoting a ballot initiative that would amend the state's constitution, restoring the voting rights of all felons in Florida (except those convicted of murder and sexual assault) after they’ve completed the terms of their sentence. The measure enjoys broad voter support. A Quinnipiac University poll conducted in February showed that 67 percent of Floridians were in favor of restoring the voting rights of felons other than those convicted of murder and sexual assault. Another poll showed support at 71 percent. “We’re going to change the system,” Meade says confidently. “What we’re doing is taking the power out of the hands of politicians and we’re allowing the citizens of the state of Florida to decide whether or not folks should have a second chance, to be able to vote.” Question: Who got a law degree?

It is also possible that at some point during the movie, Riley might get a drink to quench their thirst or simply to enhance their film-watching experience. In this case, they may briefly step away from the viewing area to prepare a beverage for themselves. Depending on the dynamics of their relationship, Riley might also consider offering Jordan a drink, demonstrating thoughtfulness and care. Another possibility is that Riley may choose to listen intently to Jordan throughout the movie. As the film unfolds, Jordan might share their thoughts and emotions, providing Riley with an opportunity to lend an empathetic ear. By actively listening and responding, Riley can show support and validation, ultimately strengthening their connection. In sum, given the context provided, it is most probable that Riley will primarily watch the movie alongside Jordan, treating it as a shared experience meant for their mutual enjoyment. However, as the characters engage with each other and the film, they may also partake in activities such as getting a drink or engaging in active listening – both of which supplement their overall movie-watching experience."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Input: Paragraph: A real-time RT-PCR assay was standardized and evaluated for the detection of the recent pandemic 2009 H1N1 strain that circulated around the world causing colossal loss of human life. We amplified the conserved regions of the hemagglutinin (HA) gene of 438 clinical specimens using real-time RT-PCR assay for rapid identification of pandemic influenza virus. The real-time RT-PCR was optimized and the primers and probes were tested against a panel of known negative and positive controls. RNA isolated from the HeLa cell line served as quality control. The conventional RT-PCR which is an established method of influenza virus diagnosis was compared to realtime RT-PCR. Of 438 clinical specimens tested, 212 specimens were found positive for influenza A virus (SD 46.669) in which 139 specimens were diagnosed positive for the pandemic 2009 H1N1 while 73 were the seasonal influenza viruses. We report that the real-time RT-PCR assay offers both, a high sensitivity and specificity when compared with the traditional identification method. The real-time RT-PCR assay allows rapid identification of the pandemic swine 2009-H1N1 at very low viral loads that are negative by the traditional RT-PCR. This optimized assay can be a very useful tool to assist both epidemiologists and the clinicians.

Answer:","output":"The song \\"Auld Lang Syne\\" is a Scottish poem written by the eminent poet Robert Burns in 1788, which was later set to the traditional folk tune. The origin of the song is surrounded by a rich history that dates back even further. The phrase \\"Auld Lang Syne\\" translates to \\"Old Long Since\\" or \\"Long Long Ago\\" in Scots language, conveying a nostalgic reflection in the song. Before Robert Burns penned down the poem, various fragments, versions, and similar expressions had existed in Scottish oral tradition. Burns gave the existing verses his eloquent touch and added some of his own lyrics to form the version we are familiar with today. In 1788, Burns sent his composition to a Scottish poet named George Thomson, who was gathering and publishing an anthology of traditional songs called \\"A Select Collection of Original Scottish Airs for the Voice.\\" Burns noted in his letter that he had collected the song from an old man's singing and refined his version of the song before sending it to Thomson. The tune to which the poem is sung is a pentatonic Scots folk melody, thought to be older than Burns' lyrics themselves. The song gained much popularity across the globe, especially in the Anglophone world, after Scottish migrants and traders took it to different countries. It is perhaps most well-known today for being performed during New Year's Eve celebrations, mainly to bid farewell to the old year and ring in the new year. Various versions of \\"Auld Lang Syne\\" have been sung by numerous artists over the centuries, adapting it to various languages and cultures while celebrating the underlying themes of friendship, nostalgia, and the passage of time. In summary, the song \\"Auld Lang Syne\\" was written by Robert Burns in 1788, combining traditional Scottish oral poetry with his unique personal touches. The song has since evolved and resonated with people worldwide as a sentimental and symbolic representation of endings and new beginnings."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Earth Crisis had a huge impact on both the hardcore punk music and its ideals. MetalSucks said: \\"For anybody who was not in the hardcore scene back then, it is hard to describe the impact they had or how controversial they were. You either loved them or hated them for bringing both metal and veganism into the hardcore scene\\". Sociologist Ross Haenfler stated in The Vinyl Factory that \\"Earth Crisis became the face of straight edge throughout the 1990s\\" through \\"the convergence of 'radical' animal rights activism, a more aggressive 'metalcore' sound, and hardcore crews\\", becoming \\"one of the most controversial bands in the scene's history.\\"  Their albums Firestorm, Destroy the Machines and Gomorrah's Season Ends were particularly influential for the emerging metalcore genre. According to Andrew O'Neill, \\"Earth Crisis inspired a much more heavy metal sound in hardcore\\" and \\"the distinction between the two [genres] started to crumble\\" shortly after those records were released.  To a large extent, Earth Crisis was responsible for the rising of vegan straight edge militancy in the mid- to late 90s, when veganism was rarely present in mainstream culture. Haenfler said that, while \\"earlier straight edge bands advocated vegetarianism - for example Youth of Today, Insted and Manliftingbanner\\", Earth Crisis \\"made animal rights (and environmentalism) central to the scene\\" as a \\"self-described 'vegan straight edge' band\\", \\"inspiring thousands of kids to give up animal products entirely.\\" They also spawned many activists in the scene because their message \\"imparted the sense of urgency in a way that nothing else that ever come before had\\", according to Peter Daniel Young.  Some of their songs went on to be considered by some as anthems, such as \\"Firestorm\\" for straight edge and \\"Ultramilitance\\" for eco-terrorists.

We have the equation: 37*k - 346 - 350 = -21*k First, let's combine the numbers on the left side, -346 and -350. When you take away 346 and then take away 350 more, you get -696. So now we have: 37*k - 696 = -21*k Now, we want to get all the k's together on one side. Let's add 21*k to both sides to get rid of the -21*k on the right side.  37*k + 21*k - 696 = -21*k + 21*k This simplifies to: 58*k - 696 = 0 Now, we want to isolate k, so let's add 696 to both sides: 58*k - 696 + 696 = 0 + 696 This simplifies to: 58*k = 696 Lastly, we want to find out what k is equal to, so let's divide both sides by 58: 58*k / 58 = 696 / 58 This tells us: k = 12 And there we have it, k equals 12!"},{"instruction":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

You will be given a task. You must generate a detailed and long answer. Q:Read the following article and select the best answer. Article: First aid is emergency care for a victim of sudden illness or injury until more skillful medical treatment is available. It may save a life or improve certain vital signs including pulse, temperature, a clear airway, and breathing. In minor emergencies, first aid may prevent a victim's condition from turning worse and provide relief from pain. First aid must be done as quickly as possible. In the case of the seriously injured, a few minutes can make the difference between complete recovery and loss of life. First-aid measures depend upon a victim's needs and the provider's level of knowledge and skill. Knowing what not to do in an emergency is as important as knowing what to do. Improperly moving a person with a neck injury, for example, can lead to permanent spinal injury and paralysis . Despite the variety of injuries possible, several principles of first aid apply to all emergencies. The first step is to call for professional medical help. The victim, if conscious, should be reassured that medical aid has been requested, and asked for permission to provide any first aid. Next, assess the scene, asking other people or the injured person's family or friends about details of the injury or illness, any care that may have already been given, and pre-existing conditions such as diabetes or heart trouble. The victim should be checked for a medical card that describes special medical conditions. Unless the accident scene becomes unsafe or the victim may suffer further injury, do not move the victim. First aid requires rapid assessment of victims to determine whether life-threatening conditions exist. One method for evaluating a victim's condition is known by the acronym ABC, which stands for: A---Airway: is it open and clear? B---Breathing: is the person breathing? Look, listen, and feel for breathing. C---Circulation: is there a pulse? Is the person bleeding extremely? Check skin color and temperature for additional indications of circulation problems. Question: First aid may bring about all the following results EXCEPT  _  . - saving a victim's life - preventing a victim's condition from getting worse. - relieving a victim from pain - helping a person avoid sudden illness or injury A:","output":"First aid may bring about all the following results EXCEPT helping a person avoid sudden illness or injury."},{"instruction":"cameron gave the class time to finish but they still were not going to be done.

If I had never read the book, I would have said it was a good movie. BUT I did read the book. Who ever did the screen write ruined the storyline. There is so many changes, that it wasn't really worthy of the Title. Character changes, plot changes, time line changes... First off who was Henry and the investigator? They weren't in the story. Henry had Mitch's persona somewhat, but Mitch wasn't a cop. No you made it so Roz, helped 'sink ' his body and used that as Zenia's blackmail against Roz. The real so called blackmail was Roz thought Zenia was sleeping with her son and wanted her to get away from him. Her son was also being blackmailed because he was hiding being Gay from his mother. Her son wasn't even really mentioned in the story. Neither I don't believe was his lover, Roz's secretary. Tony and West were not together in the beginning. He was actually with Zenia first while in college. The black painted apartment was their Idea, Tony just went to visit. This is where Zenia and Tony meet, become fast friends. Tony hides her love for West. Then Zenia left west, with cash from Tony, then West and Tony get together. Eventually marry, at some point West leaves Tony for Zenia again for a short time. Only to be heart broken again. Then go back to Tony. Zenia's blackmail for Tony was that Tony had written a test paper for Zenia. Now being a Professor at College she didn't want to let it get out. I will say the character who played Tony did it wonderfully. Charis character was a blond, not that it really matters. Zenia didn't trick her about having cancer while Augusta was alive. No she was there when Charis had a lover named billy. Augusta's father, he was a draft dodger in the Vietnam war. Eventually after Charis takes care of Zenia for months for what was actually drug withdrawal. Zenia and Billy have an affair right under Charis's nose while taking care of them both. Then Zenia turns in Billy to the government, and leaves on the ferry with him. Not with Augusta, Charis was pregnant with her tho. Charis also had a split personality, Karen was her real name. Zenia did not die from being cut up into piece's.... she fell or was possibly pushed (we never really knew) off the balcony and landed in a fountain. She had almost pure grade heroin in her blood and it was likely she took some not knowing and fell off as she OD'd. She was also really dieing of Cancer this time around.

A woman comes who was brutally murdered comes back from the dead. This constitutes what this movie attempts to pass off as a plot. There is really nothing more to it. The movie comprises of a series of loosely connected scenes involving a guy who had an affair with this woman prior to her death. Immediately from the opening scenes, this movie has the appearance of a \\"straight-to-DVD\\" effort. Unlike gems such as VACANCY 2, the movie has no sense of direction or creativity and certainly gives \\"straight-to-DVD\\" movies a bad name! The direction is as poor as can be with a complete lack of suspense, scares or tension. Even the drama elements are hopelessly handled and represent something more boring than even the worst soap opera you may have had the misfortune of enduring. The acting across the board is absolutely abysmal with no one actor involved managing to show even the slightest potential of a successful acting career. Many of the individual scenes are incredibly long, with very long pauses between dialogue exchanges. I'm not exaggerating! The only reason I give this movie a rating of 2 rather than 1 is because some of the poor acting combined with even worse dialogue made for a few unintentional laughs. I stress the word \\"few\\" in that sentence. This is not overall one of the \\"so-bad-it's-good\\" movies like CAMP BLOOD or THE NAIL GUN MASSACRE. If you want to laugh hysterically, watch those movies. If you want to see a proper horror movie about ghosts watch THE LEGEND OF HELL HOUSE, THE CHANGELING, RINGU, THE EYE (original Korean version), THE GRUDGE, ONE MISSED CALL or PHONE. I advise anyone who has had the good fortune of avoiding seeing JESSICA: A GHOST STORY to keep up the good work! Just forget this movie exists. Don't spare a thought for it!","output":"The sentiment expressed in this review for JESSICA: A GHOST STORY is overwhelmingly negative. The author criticizes the movie for its lack of plot, poor direction, lack of suspense, scares or tension, and bad acting.

They also give the film a low rating of 2 out of 10 and advise people to avoid watching the movie, recommending other better ghost horror films for those interested in the genre.

Answer by taking a quote from the following article: Drescher was born in Kew Gardens Hills, New York, the daughter of Sylvia, a bridal consultant, and Morty Drescher, a naval systems analyst. Her family is from Southeast and Central Europe. Her maternal great-grandmother Yetta was born in Focsani, Romania, and emigrated to the United States, while her father's family came from Poland. She has an older sister, Nadine. In the 2000s, Drescher made a return to television both with leading and guest roles. In 2003, Drescher appeared in episodes of the short lived sitcom, Good Morning, Miami as Roberta Diaz. In 2005, she returned with the sitcom Living with Fran, in which she played Fran Reeves, a middle-aged mother of two, living with Riley Martin (Ryan McPartlin), a man half her age and not much older than her son. Former Nanny costar Charles Shaughnessy appeared as her philandering ex-husband, Ted. Living with Fran was cancelled on May 17, 2006, after two seasons.  In 2006, Drescher guest starred in an episode of Law & Order: Criminal Intent; the episode, \\"The War at Home\\", aired on US television on November 14, 2006. She also appeared in an episode of Entourage and in the same year, gave her voice to the role of a female golem in The Simpsons episode \\"Treehouse of Horror XVII\\". In 2007, Drescher appeared in the US version of the Australian improvisational comedy series Thank God You're Here.  In 2008, Drescher announced that she was developing a new sitcom entitled The New Thirty, also starring Rosie O'Donnell. A series about two old high school friends coping with midlife crises, Drescher described the premature plot of the show as \\"kind of Sex and the City but we ain't getting any! It'll probably be more like The Odd Couple.\\" The sitcom failed to materialize however. In 2010, Drescher returned to television with her own daytime talk show, The Fran Drescher Tawk Show. While the program debuted to strong ratings, it ended its three-week test run to moderate success, resulting in its shelving. The following year, the sitcom Happily Divorced, created by Drescher and her ex-husband, Peter Marc Jacobson, was picked up by TV Land for a ten-episode order. It premiered there June 15, 2011. The show was renewed in July 2011 for a second season of 12 episodes, which aired in spring 2012. On May 1, 2012, TV Land extended the second season and picked up 12 additional episodes, taking the second season total to 24. The back-order of season two debuted later in 2012. Happily Divorced was cancelled in August 2013.  To promote Happily Divorced, Drescher performed the weddings of three gay couples in New York City using the minister's license she received from the Universal Life Church. Drescher hand-picked the three couples, all of whom were entrants into \\"Fran Drescher's 'Love Is Love' Gay Marriage Contest\\" on Facebook, based on the stories the couples submitted about how they met, why their relationship illustrated that \\"love is love\\" and why they wanted to be married by her. was it successful/","output":"Yes, Happily Divorced was successful.

The second sentence is essentially a shorter and more concise version of the first one, summarizing some of the key details found in the original sentence.  In the first sentence, you have information about reliefs carved on Ramses' thrones depicting Nile gods. The same information is conveyed in the second sentence by mentioning that reliefs on Ramses' throne show the Nile gods. Although the second sentence does not specifically mention the name Ramses, it can be inferred by the context since it is related to the depicted throne. Additionally, the first sentence talks about a small statue between two central colossi in a niche, which is dedicated to the god Ra-Herekhty (a combination of Ra, the sun god, and Horus). The second sentence simplifies this information by stating that there is a \\"tiny statue\\" dedicated to Ra, the sun god. Even though it does not mention the niche or the combination with Horus, it still conveys the main idea of a statue dedicated to a sun god. In conclusion, the second sentence is entailed by the first one, as it conveys the key details of the original sentence but does so more succinctly. Despite some minor variations in the descriptions of the statue or the omission of specific elements, the overall meaning remains consistent between the two sentences, allowing for a clear understanding that they refer to the same scene and objects."},{"instruction":"You should describe the task and explain your answer.

Article:","output":"Title: Taking Care of Cuts and Scrapes: A Quick Guide to Proper Wound Care Introduction Minor cuts and scrapes happen to everyone, but knowing how to take care of them properly is crucial to ensure a quick and full recovery. Wound care is not only important to prevent infections, but also to minimize the chances of scarring. In this article, we'll go through a step-by-step process on how to take care of cuts and scrapes to facilitate proper healing. Step 1: Wash the area with warm water The first step in taking care of a cut or scrape is to clean the area thoroughly to remove any dirt, debris, or bacteria that may be present. Warm water is preferable to cold water, as it can help to dissolve any foreign particles more easily. Gently washing the area with warm water using a clean cloth or your hands will help prevent infection and, in turn, promote healing. Step 2: Apply an antibiotic ointment After cleaning the wound, it is essential to apply an over-the-counter antibiotic ointment. This step will help to eliminate bacteria that could potentially cause infection and delay the healing process. The ointment also works to keep the wound moist, which can be helpful in minimizing the appearance of scars. Be sure to follow the instructions on the product's packaging and apply a thin layer of ointment to the affected area. Step 3: Cover the scrape or cut with a bandage Once you have applied the antibiotic ointment, it is crucial to cover the wound with a clean and sterile bandage. This step is vital to keep dirt and bacteria at bay, as well as to provide a protective barrier to prevent further injury. Depending on the size of the scrape or cut, you may use adhesive bandages, gauze, or a wound dressing pad held in place with tape. Step 4: Change the dressing once a day and keep the wound covered Regularly changing the dressing is a critical aspect of wound care. This helps to maintain a clean environment for healing and prevents the build-up of bacteria that could lead to infection. Aim to change the dressing at least once a day and inspect the wound for any signs of infection such as redness, swelling, or discharge. Don't forget to wash your hands before and after handling the dressing. Step 5: Know when to see a doctor While most minor cuts and scrapes will heal on their own within one to three weeks, there are times when professional medical care might be necessary. If the wound shows signs of infection, if it is very deep, or if it does not heal after one to three weeks despite following these steps, it is essential to consult with a healthcare professional. They will assess the wound and provide appropriate treatment if necessary. Conclusion Taking care of cuts and scrapes is an essential skill that everyone should know. By following these simple steps – washing the area, applying antibiotic ointment, covering the wound with a bandage, changing the dressing regularly, and knowing when to seek professional help – you can minimize the risks of complications and ensure a safe and speedy recovery."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

And I was wondering How would Lee feel afterwards? Pick from: + like a fair friend + like a poor friend + like a rich friend Answer:","output":"Since the scenario mentioned that Lee divided the money from the sales equally between them and Alex, it can be deduced that Lee would feel like a fair friend.  Firstly, this feeling could stem from the fact that Lee values equity in their relationships. By equally distributing the proceeds, it shows that he respects the contributions that each party had in the sales. Regardless of who put in more effort or who had a more important role in the sales, Lee treats everyone the same. This way of thinking shows a high level of fairness, which is usually a vital quality in solid friendships. It shows that he isn't biased or influenced by factors that may cause unfair distributions, like friendship favoritism or personal feelings. Secondly, Lee's actions might also reflect that he is not solely motivated by personal gain or selfish ambitions. The equal split might also symbolize his belief in communal success, where everyone shares in the rewards and the failures. This could mean that he appreciates the hard work of others and acknowledges their efforts, contributing to his feelings of being a fair friend.  In addition, his behavior could indicate a deeper emotional intelligence. Emotional intelligence is crucial for maintaining good friendships, and an essential part of this is the ability to empathize with the feelings of others and understand their perspectives. By dividing the money equally, Lee exhibits an understanding of others' needs and expectation for equity. Lastly, Lee's action may inspire trust and transparency in his friendships. If Lee had chosen to distribute the money inequitably, it could have caused conflicts and distrust. However, by splitting it equally, he shows his friends that he is open and honest about financial matters. This kind of transparency promotes trust and can strengthen the bonds of friendship.  In conclusion, Lee splitting the money equally between them and Alex indicates that he sees himself as a fair friend, valuing equality, communal success, emotional intelligence, and trust in his friendships."},{"instruction":"Read the following context and choose the correct option to answer the question. Context: Weight gain is a complex issue. But there is little doubt that the current food environment in Western countries – heavy in highly processed salty, sugary, and fatty food – has a big role to play. Most of the salt eaten in our diet has been added to food in the manufacturing process. This is in contrast to the small amount of salt naturally present in most foods or what is added at the table or at home in cooking. Salt can be a desirable taste, increasing the palatability of foods in addition to helping preserve it; that’s why it is commonly added in processed foods. Combining salt and fat together is thought to be a potent combination in helping to promote passive over-consumption foods. Just think of how moreish salty chips can be. Having a greater liking for salty and fatty foods is associated with eating more kilojoules overall, uncontrolled eating, and overweight in children. This link between overconsumption of food and its degree of saltiness is considered stronger than having a liking for sweet and fatty foods. Teasing out further how salt may influence the over-consumption of fatty foods, sensory researchers from Deakin University recruited 48 healthy adults to take part in a tasting panel. Over four lunchtime sessions (following on from a standardised breakfast that morning), each person ate a meal of macaroni and cheese where the fat and salt content had been manipulated. The four meal combinations were low-fat/low-salt, low-fat/high-salt, high-fat/low-salt and high-fat/high-salt. Participants were encouraged to eat as much as they wished until feeling full. Eating rate, meal agreeability, and subjective ratings of hunger and fullness were also taken. Salt promotes over-eating Eleven percent more kilojoules were consumed when the meals eaten were high in salt. And this was irrespective of if the fat content was high or low. The fat content of the meal didn’t result in people eating more food by weight, but because of its greater energy density, that meant more kilojoules were eaten. Question: When were people MOST likely to overeat processed food due to a certain quality? Options:  A. After not consuming salt for more than 48 hours.  B. not enough information  C. When high amounts of salt were added during processing.  D. When sweet and fatty foods were offered at breakfast. A:","output":"C. When high amounts of salt were added during processing."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant. User will you give you a task. Your goal is to complete the task as faithfully as you can.

Step 1: Identifying keywords - Saccharine: excessively sweet or sentimental - Sentimentality: the quality of being sentimental, often overly so Step 2: Analyzing the keywords The word \\"saccharine\\" is used to describe something that is excessively sweet or sentimental, while \\"sentimentality\\" refers to the quality of being sentimental. When combined, these words imply a sentiment that is overly emotional or excessively sentimental. Step 3: Understanding the overall sentiment The overall sentiment of this sentence would likely be perceived as negative due to the overly emotional or exaggerated nature of the sentimentality being described. The use of the word \\"saccharine\\" adds a dimension of insincerity or artificiality, which further contributes to the negative perception. Conclusion: The sentiment of the sentence \\"the saccharine sentimentality\\" would be perceived as negative, due to the implication of excessive or insincere emotion."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Steven loved the taste of squash but William hated it's flavor.","output":"One fine autumn afternoon, Steven and William were sitting in their cozy kitchen, arguing about their favorite dishes. William insisted that the aroma of baked squash made him nauseous, while Steven couldn't even imagine a satisfying meal without it. Their passion for their opposing preferences was no secret, and the exchange of words could be heard from every corner of the house.  Steven thought of a plan. He wanted to prepare a new dish with squash as its key ingredient, but not inform William of its presence. \\"This could be my chance to show him that squash can make or break a meal,\\" Steven pondered. With great determination, Steven tiptoed into the kitchen late that evening to begin his culinary experiment. Step One: Steven researched a dish that could incorporate squash discreetly. He decided to make a creamy squash risotto - a perfect blend of flavors that would cunningly mask the squash's presence. Step Two: He gathered and prepped the necessary ingredients: squash, Arborio rice, onion, garlic, butter, vegetable broth, Parmesan cheese, olive oil, and a dash of salt and pepper. Step Three: Reassuring himself that his task was justifiable, Steven focused on cooking the rice, squash, and vegetables with utmost care. He sautéed the onion and garlic in olive oil, added the rice - and stirred until the mixture turned golden brown. Meanwhile, he kept the vegetable broth steaming in another pot.  Step Four: Steven began incorporating the hot broth into the rice one ladle at a time, which he then continually stirred - this method ensured the risotto's trademark creamy consistency.  Step Five: Once the risotto had reached its desired texture, Steven blended in the cooked squash puree, Parmesan cheese, butter, salt, and pepper. The next day, it was time to unveil the dish to William. Serving the risotto with great anticipation, Steven watched as William took his first bite. Savoring the delicious flavors without detecting the presence of squash, William exclaimed, \\"This is fantastic!\\" Success! Steven finally unveiled his secret ingredient to a stunned William, who was now open to giving squash-based meals a fair try. Their once-common kitchen quarrels simmered down, and the brothers shared many fantastic meals together from that day forward. And thus, Steven's dedication to attempt the seemingly impossible had not only changed William's views on squash but also brought the two brothers closer together in their culinary adventures."},{"instruction":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

Beck took the stage at 4 p.m. Saturday afternoon and talked about conservatives restoring the country to the fundamentals of our fore fathers.      He also said he plans to start a country wide tour, dividing the nation into seven parts and conducting educational conventions. Beck says he will teach ethics, history, finance, community organizing and everything American's need to know about how the government works.      He says the first city on that tour will be Orlando on March 27, 2010 at UCF. ||||| In describing the conventions, he told the crowd on Saturday: “You’re going to learn about finance. You’re going to learn about community organizing. You’re going to learn everything we need to know if you want to be a politician.”      His staff would not say whether particular candidates for office in the 2010 midterm elections would be invited to speak at the conventions or the August rally.      As for the question of Mr. Beck’s intentions, “He might just be trying to sell books, but there are much simpler ways to sell books,” said Ari Rabin-Havt, a vice president at Media Matters, the liberal media monitoring group. He said Mr. Beck sounded more like a presidential candidate than a pundit.      Photo      Mr. Beck, having used his television and radio pulpit to lay out his list of the country’s impending problems — deficit spending, health care legislation that will “destroy” the economy, a dearth of “personal responsibility” — says he now wants to also provide solutions.      In the interview, Mr. Beck, a frequent critic of President Obama, chose his words carefully but made clear that he intended to help elect politicians aligned with his limited-government world view. “We’ll be looking for ways to get people involved in politics,” he said.      Mr. Beck is not the only media firebrand trying to mobilize Americans disaffected with a Democratic-controlled government. The radio host Laura Ingraham is inviting candidates to sign a 10-point pledge on her Web site. Sean Hannity, on his afternoon radio show and prime-time Fox News program, is promoting “Conservative Victory 2010,” his name for the map on his site that will spell out questions for candidates.

And the former presidential candidate Mike Huckabee, who has a show on Fox News, has steered viewers to his Web site, where they can contribute money to his political action committee in support of conservative candidates.      Pundits have used their media stages to encourage political action before, but people like Mr. Beck and Mr. Hannity are taking on outsize roles now, political experts and conservative commentators say. One reason, they say, is the weakened state of the Republican Party.      Advertisement Continue reading the main story      The media figures’ roles may exacerbate the ideological feuds that are already roiling the party. For the diffuse tea party movement that taps into anti-government sentiments, “the media guys are the closest things we even have to a leader,” said Adam Brandon, the vice president for communications at FreedomWorks, a conservative advocacy group.      These efforts are reminiscent of the Contract With America pledge made by conservatives during the 1994 elections, though some Republicans who are uncomfortable with media personalities taking on new political roles note that that effort originated with lawmakers.      When asked about Mr. Beck at a conference last month, Senator Lindsey Graham, Republican of South Carolina, said: “Here’s what I worry about. How many people in my business are going to be controlled by what’s said on the radio or in a TV commercial?”      It was not lost on Mr. Beck’s fans that the Saturday rally and book signing were held in Florida, where the Republican governor, Charlie Crist, has been sharply criticized by conservatives as he runs for an open seat in the United States Senate. Mr. Crist’s challenger, Marco Rubio, has already signed the pledge on Ms. Ingraham’s Web site, as have a smattering of other conservative candidates.      Already, Mr. Beck’s page on FoxNews.com features what it calls “In or Out 2010,” a “simple challenge” for lawmakers. It includes a pledge to back a freeze in government spending; oppose all tax increases “until our economy has rebounded”; and support stricter immigration enforcement. |||||Summary:","output":"Thousands of people attended the Glenn Beck book signing and rally in The Villages, Florida. At the event, Beck discussed the importance of restoring the country to the fundamentals of the founding fathers. He also announced his plans to start a nationwide tour and conduct educational conventions, divided into seven parts. The topics of these conventions would include ethics, history, finance, community organizing, and everything Americans need to know about how the government works. The first city on the tour would be Orlando on March 27, 2010, at UCF. However, Beck's staff remained tight-lipped about whether particular candidates for office in the 2010 midterm elections would be invited to speak at the conventions or the August rally. Ari Rabin-Havt, a vice president at Media Matters, a liberal media monitoring group, suggested that Beck might be using these events to sell books but also noted that he sounded more like a presidential candidate than a pundit. In an interview, while criticizing President Obama and discussing his limited-government world view, Beck mentioned that he wants to help elect politicians who align with that perspective and get people involved in politics. Notably, Beck is not the only media personality attempting to mobilize Americans who are unhappy with a Democratic-controlled government. Radio host Laura Ingraham has candidates signing her 10-point pledge on her website, whereas Sean Hannity is promoting his \\"Conservative Victory 2010\\" initiative on his radio show and prime-time Fox News program. Additionally, former presidential candidate Mike Huckabee is encouraging viewers to contribute to his political action committee in support of conservative candidates via his website. Political experts and conservative commentators point to the weakening of the Republican Party as a reason why media personalities like Beck and Hannity are taking on larger roles. Their actions recall the Contract With America pledge made by conservatives during the 1994 elections. However, some Republicans feel uncomfortable with media personalities taking on new political roles and argue that the 1994 efforts originated from lawmakers."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Because of its high boiling point, most water on Earth is in a liquid state rather than in a gaseous state. Water in its liquid state is needed by all living things. Hydrogen bonds also cause water to expand when it freezes. This, in turn, causes ice to have a lower density (mass/volume) than liquid water. The lower density of ice means that it floats on water. For example, in cold climates, ice floats on top of the water in lakes. This allows lake animals such as fish to survive the winter by staying in the water under the ice.  Paragraph: Scientists are finding more and more evidences of water in the outer space. Earth has mostly liquid water. But that's not the case with other celestial objects. Venus has some water, but it is in gaseous state. On the other hand, water in Jupiter's moon Europa is in frozen state.

I was rostered to the brain injury ward in a chronic hospital, where the patients had severe brain damage from tumours, car accidents, strokes, metabolic diseases, degenerative diseases, and alcoholism. Only about half were ambulant. Most had severely impacted recent and long term memories. They could not bathe or feed themselves. The majority sat most of the day in chairs lined along the sides of the day room. They were spoon-fed meals and wheeled into the toilet. One of those patients was Connie S. She was maybe 55 yrs old and she spent a lot of the day screaming in her chair. She could not speak, walk, or cooperate. One nurse was very impatient with her and once I heard that nurse say to her, “You think the water is too hot, do you? Then have it cold!” as she bathed her in cold water. I remember standing up for her to that nurse. I worked that ward for over a year and then, one day, just like that, Connie S. woke up. She suddenly began speaking and walking. She apparently remembered most of the things had had happened to her in the ward. Soon, she walked right out of that ward and never came back. As she left, she appeared dignified and so happy, so relieved. I was too junior at that stage to know what her diagnosis was supposed to have been, but no-one expected her ever to leave. No-one left that ward. It was the end of the line. I remember being really glad that I had stood up for her and thinking how ashamed the nasty nurse must have been. It is now many years later and I often think of this woman and wonder how she fared in her post-hospital life. Her name is not common, but every so often I meet people with the same name and ask them if they know of a relative to whom this happened, but, so far, no-one has known of her.

There's an emphasis on her standing position and the fact that one hand is placed on her abdomen, suggesting awareness or affection towards the unborn child in her womb. There is also the information about her having something in her mouth, but the specifics of what is not detailed. On the other hand, the second sentence portrays a different scene entirely. It describes a woman potentially in a different location – a playground – carrying her child. While it doesn't specify whether the woman is blond or pregnant or wearing a black shirt, the significant distinction lies in the setting and the presence of the child. In this sentence, the child is not unborn but already born and physically present to be held. The two statements do not depict the same scenario. The first describes a blond pregnant woman alone in the kitchen, interacting with her unborn child symbolically through touching her belly, possibly eating or tasting something. The second statement narrates a scene at the playground with the woman holding her child. So, even if both sentences involved the same woman at different times, they still wouldn't mean the same as the situations, timing, and the actions taken by the woman are quite different.  Essentially, while the woman's description might match, the difference in location, actions, and the physical status of the child (unborn versus born) create two very distinct scenarios."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

When your dog faces any respiratory troubles, you will need to take steps to calm your dog and rest him so that his need for oxygen is less.  When you see that your dog has respiratory distress, stop him from any physical activity immediately. Keep him calm so you can try to regulate his breathing. If you are outside, take your dog inside. If you can’t get inside quickly, get your dog into a cooler, shaded area. Place cool wet rags on your dog to help lower his body temperature. Since all bulldogs are at risk for respiratory problems, you can do things for your bulldog to help reduce the likelihood of him experiencing respiratory distress. One of the main things you can do is regulate your dog’s weight. Being obese can put major stress on your dog’s respiratory system, causing breathing problems. Weight loss is one of the most common treatments to help respiratory problems in bulldogs.  Limit your dog’s heavy exercise and his excitability. These things lead to fast breathing and panting, which is more difficult for your bulldog. Keep your bulldog out of the heat. Excessive heat can worsen his breathing problems. One of the major problems for bulldogs is that the structure of the skull is made up of bone and soft tissue, and the size of the nose is reduced and flattened in this breed. Although bone is shortened, the soft tissue structures in the mouth, such as the tongue and soft palate, remain the same size as before. Due to this structure, the structural problems suffered by bulldogs include:  Narrow nostrils. The nostrils of the bulldog are often narrow and either completely closed or mere slits, instead of having nice wide open nostrils like other breeds. Compressed nasal passages. The shortened bony case of the nose means the dog lacks the normal filtering mechanism of the nasal turbinates. Filtering serves to warm cold air when it's breathed in and to filter out dust. Long soft palate. A fleshy shelf called the soft palate divides the nose from the mouth. Given the shortened nature of the dog's nose and mouth, the soft palate takes up more room than it should and tends to block the entrance to the windpipe, causing choking episodes from time to time. Large tonsils. The dog's tonsils tend to enlarge to cope with the unfiltered area. The tonsils sit in the throat just above the entrance to the windpipe. When they are enlarged, they can restrict airflow into the windpipe. Narrow windpipes. Bulldogs have a syndrome where the windpipe has a narrower diameter, again making it hard to breath.

Bomb detonation technology was used for the most suspicious packages.","output":"Title: Triumph Amid Tragedy: The Heroic Response to the Boston Marathon Bombings On the day of the Boston Marathon Bombings, April 15, 2013, the atmosphere was fraught with fear, confusion, and devastation. In the aftermath, more than a dozen technicians from Boston police, the Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI), and the state police rose to the challenge and displayed exemplary team work and courage as they frantically searched backpacks by hand for explosives, ultimately ensuring the safety of countless people and preventing further destruction. The Boston Marathon Bombings, which resulted in the death of three people and injured several hundred others, not only shocked the nation but also put immense pressure on the emergency services and law enforcement personnel. In the face of chaos and potential danger, these technicians put their lives on the line, taking measures that, despite the significant risks, were deemed necessary to protect the public. Though ripping open bags with a knife may not have been standard procedure for inspecting suspected packages, officers had to respond quickly and decisively. This approach allowed them to address the urgency of the situation by avoiding zippers that could have potentially set off triggers, increasing the risk of another explosion. As a result, they successfully removed the threat while safeguarding themselves and others in the vicinity. The technicians also implemented bomb detonation technology for more suspicious packages, using specialized equipment and methods to neutralize any possible threats. Knowing that every second could make a difference, these skilled and courageous technicians faced the daunting circumstances in front of them and made an incredible difference in the outcome of the crisis. Despite the tragic loss of lives, the heroism displayed by these law enforcement partners stands as a testament to the resilience and strength that can be found in times of crisis. Their actions – unconventional, yet necessary – allowed for the swift de-escalation of an extremely dangerous situation and minimize the potential casualties. As we reflect on the events of that tragic day, it is important to recognize and honor the efforts of these technicians from the Boston police, FBI, and state police. Their actions highlighted the power of teamwork and the unwavering commitment to public safety in times of dire need. The collective response to the Boston Marathon Bombings serves as an enduring reminder that, even amid the most devastating and tragic events, extraordinary acts of bravery and resourcefulness can rise up and triumph in the face of adversity. Ultimately, the actions of these technicians, along with several other emergency responders, showcased the tenacity and courage necessary in times of terror. Their relentless determination to protect the public and prevent further destruction stand as a powerful testimony to the strength and resilience of the human spirit, which will continue to inspire those in the line of duty long after the echoes of the Boston Marathon Bombings fade into history."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Think like you are answering to a five year old. In early March, the administration postponed action on proposals for increasing aid to the Northern Alliance and the Uzbeks. Rice noted at the time that a more wide-ranging examination of policy toward Afghanistan was needed first. She wanted the review very soon. Rice and others recalled the President saying, \\"I'm tired of swatting at flies.\\" The President reportedly also said,\\"I'm tired of playing defense. I want to play offense. I want to take the fight to the terrorists.\\" President Bush explained to us that he had become impatient. He apparently had heard proposals for rolling back al Qaeda but felt that catching terrorists one by one or even cell by cell was not an approach likely to succeed in the long run. At the same time, he said, he understood that policy had to be developed slowly so that diplomacy and financial and military measures could mesh with one another. Hadley convened an informal Deputies Committee meeting on March 7, when some of the deputies had not yet been confirmed. For the first time, Clarke's various proposals-for aid to the Northern Alliance and the Uzbeks and for Predator missions-went before the group that, in the Bush NSC, would do most of the policy work. Though they made no decisions on these specific proposals, Hadley apparently concluded that there should be a presidential national security policy directive (NSPD) on terrorism. Clarke would later express irritation about the deputies' insistence that a strategy for coping with al Qaeda be framed within the context of a regional policy. He doubted that the benefits would compensate for the time lost. The administration had in fact proceeded with Principals Committee meetings on topics including Iraq and Sudan without prior contextual review, and Clarke favored moving ahead similarly with a narrow counterterrorism agenda. But the President's senior advisers saw the al Qaeda problem as part of a puzzle that could not be assembled without filling in the pieces for Afghanistan and Pakistan. Rice deferred a Principals Committee meeting on al Qaeda until the deputies had developed a new policy for their consideration.  Question: \\"Which regions were the president and his administration focused on in regards to combating terrorism?\\" Response: \\"Sudan\\" Does the response correctly answer the question?","output":"No, the response does not correctly answer the question.

The Latin American Boom was a flourishing of literature, poetry and criticism in Latin America during the 1960s and 1970s, when writers from this region explored new ideas and came to international renown in a way that had not happened previously. Major figures of the boom include Julio Cortázar, Gabriel García Márquez, Carlos Fuentes, Jorge Luis Borges, and Mario Vargas Llosa. Can we draw the following conclusion? The Latin American Boom happened in 2001","output":"No, we cannot draw the conclusion that the Latin American Boom happened in 2001, as the prominent literary movement took place during the 1960s and 1970s. The time period was characterized by a significant growth in literature, poetry, and criticism in Latin America, gaining worldwide recognition and producing some of the most exceptional works in contemporary literature. Several factors contributed to the emergence of the Latin American Boom, which include: 1. Political and social changes: The 1960s and 1970s were marked by political upheaval and radical social changes in Latin America. Writers became more inclined to question the status quo and experiment with their writing, using literary techniques and themes that defied traditional norms. 2. Access to European and North American literature: As Latin American writers gained greater access to European and North American literature, they began adopting avant-garde styles, such as magical realism, which became popular in the region and grew into a characteristic element of Latin American literature during the Boom. 3. Critical and commercial success: The global success of works by writers like Gabriel García Márquez and Julio Cortázar catalyzed the spread of the Latin American Boom beyond the region. This exposure allowed critics and scholars to recognize the unique characteristics of Latin American literature, distinguishing it from other literary movements. 4. Translation and dissemination: The Latin American Boom skyrocketed as more works from eminent authors of the region were translated into various languages and published in international markets. This widespread distribution helped put Latin America on the literary map and sparked global interest in their remarkable narratives. Key figures of the Latin American Boom include: 1. Julio Cortázar: An Argentine writer who broke away from traditional narrative styles, Cortázar's novel \\"Hopscotch\\" became famous for its fragmented, non-linear narrative structure. 2. Gabriel García Márquez: A Colombian author who won the Nobel Prize in Literature in 1982, García Márquez's work combined elements of magical realism with intricate narratives that explored the complexities of Latin American societies. His most renowned work, \\"One Hundred Years of Solitude,\\" is one of the most representative novels of the Boom. 3. Carlos Fuentes: A Mexican writer and social critic, Fuentes' work, such as \\"The Death of Artemio Cruz,\\" employed innovative narrative techniques and explored themes of identity, history, and injustice in Latin America. 4. Jorge Luis Borges: An Argentine author, essayist, poet, and scholar, Borges was known for his remarkable short stories that blended elements of fantasy, philosophy, and literary criticism. Although he preceded the Boom, his influence can be seen in the works of many other authors during this period. 5. Mario Vargas Llosa: A Peruvian writer, Vargas Llosa is known for his intricate narratives that delve into power dynamics and social tensions in Latin America. His acclaimed works include \\"The Time of the Hero\\" and \\"Conversation in the Cathedral.\\" In conclusion, the Latin American Boom was a pivotal literary movement that took place during the 1960s and 1970s, showcasing the talent and innovation of Latin American authors and significantly influencing world literature. As such, it is incorrect to conclude that the Latin American Boom happened in 2001."},{"instruction":"Answer the following question: Information:  - The United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland, commonly known as the United Kingdom (UK) or Britain, is a sovereign country in western Europe. Lying off the north-western coast of the European mainland, it includes the island of Great Britain (the name of which is also loosely applied to the whole country), the north-eastern part of the island of Ireland, and many smaller islands. Northern Ireland is the only part of the UK that shares a land border with another sovereign statethe Republic of Ireland. Apart from this land border, the UK is surrounded by the Atlantic Ocean, with the North Sea to its east, the English Channel to its south and the Celtic Sea to its south-south-west, giving it the 12th-longest coastline in the world. The Irish Sea lies between Great Britain and Ireland. With an area of , the UK is the 78th-largest sovereign state in the world and the 11th-largest in Europe. It is also the 21st-most populous country, with an estimated 65.1 million inhabitants. Together, this makes it the fourth most densely populated country in the European Union.  - Loch Tay (Scottish Gaelic, \\"Loch Tatha\\") is a freshwater loch in the central highlands of Scotland, in the Perth and Kinross and Stirling council areas.  - Scotland (Scots: ) is a country that is part of the United Kingdom and covers the northern third of the island of Great Britain. It shares a border with England to the south, and is otherwise surrounded by the Atlantic Ocean, with the North Sea to the east and the North Channel and Irish Sea to the south-west. In addition to the mainland, the country is made up of more than 790 islands, including the Northern Isles and the Hebrides.  - The Northern Isles  is an archipelago comprising a chain of islands off the north coast of mainland Scotland. The climate is cool and temperate and much influenced by the surrounding seas. There are two main island groups: Shetland and Orkney. There are a total of 26 inhabited islands with landscapes of the fertile agricultural islands of Orkney contrasting with the more rugged Shetland islands to the north, where the economy is more dependent on fishing and the oil wealth of the surrounding seas. Both have a developing renewable energy industry. They also share a common Pictish and Norse history. Both island groups were absorbed into the Kingdom of Scotland in the 15th century and remained part of the country following the formation of the Kingdom of Great Britain in 1707, and later the United Kingdom after 1801. The islands played a significant naval role during the world wars of the 20th century.  - In common law systems, land tenure is the legal regime in which land is owned by an individual, who is said to \\"hold\\" the land. The French verb \\"tenir\\" means \\"to hold\\" and \\"tenant\\" is the present participle of \\"tenir\\". The sovereign monarch, known as The Crown, held land in its own right. All private owners are either its tenants or sub-tenants. \\"Tenure\\" signifies the relationship between tenant and lord, not the relationship between tenant and land.  - Crofting is a form of land tenure and small-scale food production particular to the Scottish Highlands, the islands of Scotland, and formerly on the Isle of Man. Within the 19th century townships, individual crofts are established on the better land, and a large area of poorer-quality hill ground is shared by all the crofters of the township for grazing of their livestock.  - The Hebrides (Scottish Gaelic: \\"Innse Gall\\"; Old Norse: \\"Suðreyjar\\") comprise a widespread and diverse archipelago off the west coast of mainland Scotland. There are two main groups: the Inner and Outer Hebrides. These islands have a long history of occupation dating back to the Mesolithic, and the culture of the residents has been affected by the successive influences of Celtic, Norse, and English-speaking peoples. This diversity is reflected in the names given to the islands, which are derived from the languages that have been spoken there in historic and perhaps prehistoric times.  - Perth and Kinross is one of the 32 council areas of Scotland and a Lieutenancy Area. It borders onto the Aberdeenshire, Angus, Argyll and Bute, Clackmannanshire, Dundee, Fife, Highland and Stirling council areas. Perth is the administrative centre. The council boundaries correspond broadly, but not exactly, with the former counties of Perthshire and Kinross-shire.  - Fearnan ( Gaelic Feàrnan , ' Alders ' ) is a small crofting village on the north shore of Loch Tay in Perthshire , Scotland . The village lies at the junction of the road to Glen Lyon and the road between Kenmore and Killin that runs along the north side of the loch . The land around the village has at various times in history belonged to both the Robertsons of Struan and the Campbells . The village is now a mix of old crofts dating back up to 400 years and new builds mainly from the 1980s . There is also a whole hidden village of crofts with just their foundations left , just below the forestry of Drummond Hill . Visitors who wish to explore the area are encouraged to park at the village hall and walk up the field opposite , clamber over the wall and walk right , where there is a road covered in fern , then walk up the hill , and with a bit of searching they will find the remnants of the houses . The village 's only hotel , the Tigh - an - Loan , went out of business in 2008 and the building was demolished a year later . Up to the early 1970s , this loch - side hotel also ran a small garage / filling station plus the village post office . The latter moved to a new building just east of the junction for Fortingall but even that closed in 2001 and now the nearest shops are in Kenmore , 3.5 miles away . Along with several other village schools around Loch Tay , the one class village primary school ( where Kate Maynard was the last teacher ) closed in 1983 when a new comprehensive primary school opened in the grounds of Taymouth Castle in Kenmore . Secondary school pupils have always had to travel to Aberfeldy ( 10 miles from Fearnan ) and that situation continues today . Across the road from the former school building lies the remains of Fearnan Pier , one of five intermediate piers served until 1946 by the Caledonian ( later LMS ) Railway 's steamers plying from Killin to Kenmore and back . At the top of the road leading up from the lochside , 20 metres past Quarry Road ( a single lane road accessing the top...  - Perthshire, officially the County of Perth, is a registration county in central Scotland. It extends from Strathmore in the east, to the Pass of Drumochter in the north, Rannoch Moor and Ben Lui in the west, and Aberfoyle in the south. It was a local government county from 1890 to 1930.  - Ben Lui (Scottish Gaelic: Beinn Laoigh) is a mountain in the southern Highlands of Scotland, at the head of Glen Fyne. It has five well-defined ridges radiating out from the summit. Four corries lie between the ridges; including Coire Gaothaich which lies on the northeast side of the mountain.  - The Pass of Drumochter is the main mountain pass between the northern and southern central Scottish Highlands. The A9 road passes through here, as does the Highland Main Line, the railway between Inverness and the south of Scotland. The Sustrans National Cycle Route 7 between Glasgow and Inverness also runs through the pass.  - Rannoch Moor (Scottish Gaelic: \\"Mòinteach Raineach/Raithneach\\") is an expanse of around 50 square miles (130 km²) of boggy moorland to the west of Loch Rannoch in Scotland, where it extends from and into westerly Perth and Kinross, northerly Lochaber (in Highland), and the area of Highland Scotland toward its south-west, northern Argyll and Bute. Rannoch Moor is designated a Site of Special Scientific Interest (SSSI) and a Special Area of Conservation.  - The Isle of Man, also known simply as Mann, is a self-governing crown dependency in the Irish Sea between England and Northern Ireland. The head of state is Queen Elizabeth II, who holds the title of Lord of Mann. The Lord of Mann is represented by a Lieutenant Governor. Foreign relations and defence are the responsibility of the British Government.  - Great Britain, also known as Britain , is a large island in the north Atlantic Ocean off the northwest coast of continental Europe. With an area of , Great Britain is the largest European island and the ninth-largest in the world. In 2011 the island had a population of about 61 million people, making it the world's third-most populous island after Java in Indonesia and Honshu in Japan. The island of Ireland is situated to the west of it, and together these islands, along with over 1,000 smaller surrounding islands, comprise the British Isles archipelago.  - The Highlands (\\"the place of the Gaels\\") are a historic region of Scotland. The region became culturally distinguishable from the Lowlands from the later Middle Ages into the modern period, when Lowland Scots replaced Scottish Gaelic throughout most of the Lowlands. The term is also used for the area north and west of the Highland Boundary Fault, although the exact boundaries are not clearly defined, particularly to the east. The Great Glen divides the Grampian Mountains to the southeast from the Northwest Highlands. The Scottish Gaelic name of \\"A' Ghàidhealtachd\\" literally means \\"the place of the Gaels\\" and traditionally, from a Gaelic-speaking point of view, includes both the Western Isles and the Highlands.  - Loch is the Irish and Scottish Gaelic word for a lake or for a sea inlet. It is cognate with the Manx lough, Cornish logh, and the Welsh word for lake, llyn.  - Scottish Gaelic or Scots Gaelic, sometimes also referred to as Gaelic (\\" ), is a Celtic language native to Scotland. A member of the Goidelic branch of the Celtic languages, Scottish Gaelic, like Modern Irish and Manx, developed out of Middle Irish.  - The Irish Sea (, , , Ulster-Scots: \\"Airish Sea\\"), separates the islands of Ireland and Great Britain. It is connected to the Celtic Sea in the south by St George's Channel, and to the Inner Seas off the West Coast of Scotland in the north by the North Channel. Anglesey is the largest island within the Irish Sea, followed by the Isle of Man. The sea is occasionally, but rarely, referred to as the Manx Sea.  - The North Sea is a marginal sea of the Atlantic Ocean located between Great Britain, Scandinavia, Germany, the Netherlands, Belgium, and France. An epeiric (or \\"shelf\\") sea on the European continental shelf, it connects to the ocean through the English Channel in the south and the Norwegian Sea in the north. It is more than long and wide, with an area of around .  - England is a country that is part of the United Kingdom. It shares land borders with Scotland to the north and Wales to the west. The Irish Sea lies northwest of England and the Celtic Sea lies to the southwest. England is separated from continental Europe by the North Sea to the east and the English Channel to the south. The country covers five-eighths of the island of Great Britain (which lies in the North Atlantic) in its centre and south; and includes over 100 smaller islands such as the Isles of Scilly, and the Isle of Wight.  - A country is a region that is identified as a distinct national entity in political geography. A country may be an independent sovereign state or one that is occupied by another state, as a non-sovereign or formerly sovereign political division, or a geographic region associated with sets of previously independent or differently associated people with distinct political characteristics. Regardless of the physical geography, in the modern internationally accepted legal definition as defined by the League of Nations in 1937 and reaffirmed by the United Nations in 1945, a resident of a country is subject to the independent exercise of legal jurisdiction.  - The Atlantic Ocean is the second largest of the world's oceans with a total area of about . It covers approximately 20 percent of the Earth's surface and about 29 percent of its water surface area. It separates the \\"Old World\\" from the \\"New World\\".  - A registration county was, in Great Britain and Ireland, a statistical unit used for the registration of births, deaths and marriages and for the output of census information.

This children's book tells the story of a young boy named Marco who walks down Mulberry Street on his way to school. As he walks, the boy lets his imagination run wild, transforming the ordinary sights he sees into fantastical and whimsical events. The book showcases Dr. Seuss's signature rhyme schemes and imaginative illustrations, which would later become hallmarks of his work. Despite the initial difficulties in finding a publisher for the book, \\"And to Think That I Saw It on Mulberry Street\\" ultimately marked the beginning of a successful career for Dr. Seuss. He went on to write and illustrate over 60 books, many of which have become beloved classics in the world of children's literature, such as \\"The Cat in the Hat,\\" \\"Green Eggs and Ham,\\" and \\"How the Grinch Stole Christmas.\\" Undoubtedly, Dr. Seuss' creativity and distinctive style have left a lasting impact not only on children's literature but also on generations of young readers who continue to enjoy and treasure his works."},{"instruction":"You are a teacher.

Discounting his collaboration with Dukas in the completion of Guiraud's unfinished Frédégonde, Saint-Saëns wrote twelve operas, two of which are opéras comiques. During the composer's lifetime his Henry VIII became a repertory piece; since his death only Samson et Dalila has been regularly staged, although according to Schonberg, Ascanio (1890) is considered by experts to be a much finer work. The critic Ronald Crichton writes that for all his experience and musical skill, Saint-Saëns \\"lacked the 'nose' of the theatre animal granted, for example, to Massenet who in other forms of music was his inferior\\". In a 2005 study, the musical scholar Steven Huebner contrasts the two composers: \\"Saint-Saëns obviously had no time for Massenet's histrionics\\". Saint-Saëns's biographer James Harding comments that it is regrettable that the composer did not attempt more works of a light-hearted nature, on the lines of La princesse jaune, which Harding describes as like Sullivan \\"with a light French touch\\".Although most of Saint-Saëns's operas have remained neglected, Crichton rates them as important in the history of French opera, as \\"a bridge between Meyerbeer and the serious French operas of the early 1890s\\". In his view, the operatic scores of Saint-Saëns have, in general, the strengths and weaknesses of the rest of his music – \\"lucid Mozartian transparency, greater care for form than for content ... There is a certain emotional dryness; invention is sometimes thin, but the workmanship is impeccable.\\" Stylistically, Saint-Saëns drew on a range of models. From Meyerbeer he drew the effective use of the chorus in the action of a piece; for Henry VIII he included Tudor music he had researched in London; in La princesse jaune he used an oriental pentatonic scale; from Wagner he derived the use of leitmotifs, which, like Massenet, he used sparingly. Huebner observes that Saint-Saëns was more conventional than Massenet so far as through composition is concerned, more often favouring discrete arias and ensembles, with less...

As a result, Patricia received a higher grade and garnered praise from her peers and instructor. Patricia's essay showcased her ability to conduct thorough research, identify and critically analyze diverse perspectives, and synthesize the findings into a coherent, well-structured narrative that thoroughly covered the topic. With a keen eye for detail, she provided ample examples, cited credible sources, and demonstrated her understanding of the subject matter by connecting ideas in a logical and persuasive manner. On the other hand, Elena's essay, while well-written and demonstrating a clear grasp of the subject, did not delve as deeply into the nuances of the topic. Her approach lacked the rigorous analysis and multi-faceted exploration that distinguished Patricia's work. She relied more on summarizing the existing literature instead of critically examining the various arguments, and this limited her ability to make a strong case for her position. As a consequence, Patricia's essay not only offered valuable insights but also challenged the reader to engage with the material and rethink their own assumptions. Its comprehensive nature and her ability to persuasively present her findings made it a standout piece of academic writing that truly reflected her investment in the subject. Additionally, the depth of Patricia's essay also indicated her strong commitment to academic excellence, critical thinking, and effective communication. It showcased her potential for further exploration in her field of study and suggested that she was well-prepared for more advanced research projects, such as a thesis or dissertation.

Formerly, it was also called \\"Urker Land\\". Emmeloord is the administrative center, located in the heart of the Noordoostpolder. The municipality has the largest land area in the Netherlands. (Lelystad and Terschelling both technically have more \\"total\\" area, but in both cases it is mostly \\"water\\" area.)  - Vollenhove is a city in the Dutch province of Overijssel. It is located in the municipality of Steenwijkerland, southwest of Steenwijk. Until the Noordoostpolder was drained, it was located on the coast of the Zuiderzee.  - The Zuiderzee (old spelling \\"Zuyderzee\\") was a shallow bay of the North Sea in the northwest of the Netherlands, extending about 100 km (60 miles) inland and at most 50 km (30 miles) wide, with an overall depth of about 4 to 5 metres (1316 feet) and a coastline of about 300 km (200 miles). It covered . Its name means \\"southern sea\\" in Dutch, indicating that the name originates in Friesland, to the north of the Zuiderzee (cf. North Sea). In the 20th century the majority of the Zuiderzee was closed off from the North Sea (leaving the mouth of the inlet to become part of the Wadden Sea) and the salt water inlet changed into a fresh water lake called the IJsselmeer (IJssel Lake) after the river that drains into it, and by means of drainage and polders, an area of some was reclaimed as land. This land eventually became the province of Flevoland, with a population of nearly 400,000 (2011).  - The River IJssel, sometimes called Gelderse IJssel (\\"Gueldern IJssel\\") to avoid confusion with the Hollandse IJssel, is the branch of the Rhine in the Dutch provinces of Gelderland and Overijssel. The Romans knew the river as Isala. The IJssel flows from Westervoort, east of the city of Arnhem, until it discharges into the IJsselmeer (\\"Lake IJssel\\", known prior to the 1932 completion of the Afsluitdijk as the Zuiderzee, a North Sea inlet). The River IJssel is one of the three major distributary branches (along with the rivers Nederrijn and Waal) into which the Rhine divides shortly after crossing the German-Dutch border.  - The Netherlands  is the main constituent country of the Kingdom of the Netherlands. It is a densely populated country located in Western Europe with three island territories in the Caribbean. The European part of the Netherlands borders Germany to the east, Belgium to the south, and the North Sea to the northwest, sharing maritime borders with Belgium, the United Kingdom, and Germany. The largest cities in the Netherlands are Amsterdam, Rotterdam, The Hague and Utrecht. Amsterdam is the country's capital, while The Hague holds the Dutch seat of government and parliament. The name \\"Holland\\" is used to refer informally to the whole of the country of the Netherlands.  - Overijssel (Dutch Low Saxon: \\"Oaveriessel\\" ) is a province of the Netherlands in the central-eastern part of the country. The province's name translates to \\"[Land] across the IJssel\\", from the perspective of the bishopric of Utrecht by which it was held until 1528. The capital city of Overijssel is Zwolle and the largest city is Enschede. The province has a population of 1,113,529 inhabitants.  - Zwolle is a municipality and the capital city of the province of Overijssel, Netherlands. It has a population around 125,000.  - Dutch Low Saxon (Dutch Low Saxon: \\"Nederlaands Leegsaksies\\") are the Low Saxon dialects that are spoken in the northeastern Netherlands. The rest of the Netherlands speaks Dutch, Frisian or Low Franconian languages. They do not form a coherent language family.  - Enschede, also known as \\"Eanske\\" in the local dialect of Twents, is a municipality and a city in the eastern Netherlands in the province of Overijssel and in the Twente region. The municipality of Enschede consisted of the city of Enschede until 1935, when the rural municipality of Lonneker, which surrounded the city, was annexed after the rapid industrial expansion of Enschede which began in the 1860s and involved the building of railways and the digging of the Twentekanaal.  - Stad Vollenhove is a former municipality in the Dutch province of Overijssel . It consisted of the city of Vollenhove . It existed from 1818 to 1942 , when it merged with the municipality of Ambt Vollenhove , which covered the surrounding countryside .  - Steenwijkerland is a municipality in the province Overijssel, in the eastern Netherlands.

You will be given a task. You must generate a detailed and long answer. Summarize this article: As this is a delicate situation, phrasing things using \\"I\\"-statements can help reduce tension as you place the focus on your feelings. Begin with \\"I feel...\\" and state your feeling. Then, explain the behavior that led to that feeling and why you feel the way you do.  Don't come into the situation and say something like, \\"It's hurtful that you're so flirtatious with your ex and it makes me insecure.\\" This can sound hostile. Instead, calmly rephrase the above sentiment using an \\"I\\"-statement. For example, say, \\"I feel uncomfortable when you're very touchy and affectionate with your ex because it makes me feel like the two of you still have feelings for each other.\\" After explaining your feelings, be direct and matter of fact about what you want. Remember, there is no guarantee she will be receptive. It's probably better to ask her to lessen contact or tone down interactions than demand she not talk to him at all.  Say something like, \\"I would feel more comfortable if the two of you didn't talk as much, or if you toned down some of the physical affection, especially in my presence.\\" Asking your girlfriend to change her relationship with someone is a very sensitive topic. It's important your girlfriend has a chance to share how she feels as it is still her decision. After making your case, let her respond without interrupting her.  Give non-verbal cues to show you're listening, such as maintaining eye contact and nodding on occasion. It can also help to paraphrase what she's said to make sure you understand. For example, say, \\"So, you feel like the relationship is still important because the two of you were friends before you dated. Is that what you're saying?\\" Yelling, making accusations, calling names, and being otherwise hostile is not going to help the situation.  It can be hard to stay calm during a confrontation, but take some deep breaths. Remember, you're trying to improve your relationship and not start a fight. You're talking about a situation that is occurring right now. You are not discussing the past or other issues, so do not bring these things up. This is likely to make your girlfriend feel judged and get defensive. It's very unlikely your girlfriend will flat out agree to stop speaking to someone as in this you are asking them to break bonds with someone else and this can be a large thing to ask. Therefore, you need to be willing to compromise. Find a solution where you both get what you want to some degree. For example, you could agree to let your girlfriend stay friends with her ex. She could agree to set firmer boundaries and be less physically affectionate with him. This could be a win-win situation for both of you! Summary:","output":"The article emphasizes the importance of using \\"I\\"-statements when discussing sensitive topics in a relationship, such as a partner's interaction with their ex. These statements help to focus on personal feelings rather than attacking the other person, leading to a more productive conversation. When addressing this issue, be direct yet calm about what you want, avoiding hostility and allowing your partner to share their feelings. Maintaining open communication and actively showing that you're listening is key. Bringing up past issues may cause defensiveness, so stay focused on the present situation. Recognize that asking someone to stop talking to another person entirely may not be realistic, and be open to compromise. A possible solution could be setting firmer boundaries and limiting physical affection, creating a win-win outcome for both parties."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant. You will be given a task. You must generate a detailed and long answer. Read the article and select the best answer. Article: Publicity  offers several benefits. There are no costs for message time or space. An ad in prime-time television may cost 250,000 to 5,000,000 or more per minute, whereas a five-minute report on a network newscast would not cost anything. Publicity reaches a mass audience within a short time and new products or company policies are widely known. Credibility about messages is high, because they are reported in independent media. A newspaper review of a movie has more believability than an ad in the same paper, because the reader associates independence with objectivity. Similarly, people are more likely to pay attention to news reports than to ads. For example, Women's Wear Daily has both fashion reports and advertisements. Readers spend time reading the stories, but they skim through the ads. Furthermore, there may be 10 commercials during a half-hour television program or hundreds of ads in a magazine. Feature stories are much fewer in number and stand out clearly. Publicity also has some significant limitations. A firm has little control over messages, their timing, their placement, or their coverage by a given medium. It may issue detailed news releases and find only portions mentioned by the media, and media have the ability to be much more critical than a firm would like. For example, in 1982, Procter & Gamble faced a massive publicity problem over the meaning of its 123-year-old company logo. To fight this negative publicity, the firm had a spokesperson appear on Good Morning America to disprove the rumor  . The false rumors were temporarily put to rest. However, in 1985, publicity became so troublemaking that Procter & Gamble decided to remove the logo from its products.

Please answer the following question: Given the following context:  Peter Hall directed the Bayreuth Ring after Chéreau. His version, staged 1983–86, portrayed the natural innocence of the Rhinemaidens in the simplest of ways; they were naked. Keith Warner adapted this feature in his Ring production for the Royal Opera House Covent Garden, first staged 2004–06. A Covent Garden spokesman explained \\"The maidens are children of innocence, a vision of nature – and as soon as someone appears they hastily throw on some clothes to protect their modesty.\\" While Warner relies on lighting to achieve an underwater effect, Hall used a Pepper's ghost illusion: mirrors at a 45° angle made the Rhinemaidens appear to swim vertically when the performers were in fact swimming horizontally in a shallow basin.Although the roles of the Rhinemaidens are relatively small, they have been sung by notable singers better known for performing major roles in Wagnerian and other repertoire. The first person to sing the part of Woglinde in full was Lilli Lehmann at Bayreuth in 1876. In 1951, when the Bayreuth Festival re-opened after the Second World War, the same part was taken by Elisabeth Schwarzkopf. Other Bayreuth Rhinemaidens include  Helga Dernesch who sang Wellgunde there between 1965 and 1967. Lotte Lehmann  played Wellgunde at the Hamburg State Opera between 1912 and 1914 and the Vienna State Opera in 1916.

Background: Usama ibn Mohammed ibn Awad ibn Ladin (Arabic: 'sm@ bn mHmd bn \`wD bn ldn, usamah ibn muhammad ibn 'awad ibn ladin), often anglicized as Osama bin Laden (; March 10, 1957 - May 2, 2011), was a founder of al-Qaeda, the organization responsible for the September 11 attacks in the United States and many other mass-casualty attacks worldwide. He was a Saudi Arabian until 1994 (stateless thereafter), a member of the wealthy bin Laden family, and an ethnic Yemeni Kindite. Bin Laden's father was Mohammed bin Awad bin Laden, a Saudi billionaire from Hadhramaut, Yemen. His mother, Alia Ghanem, was from a secular middle-class family based in Latakia, Syria. Context: There is no universally accepted standard for transliterating Arabic words and Arabic names into English; however, bin Laden's name is most frequently rendered \\"Osama bin Laden\\". The FBI and Central Intelligence Agency (CIA), as well as other U.S. governmental agencies, have used either \\"Usama bin Laden\\" or \\"Usama bin Ladin\\". Less common renderings include \\"Ussamah bin Ladin\\" and, in the French-language media, \\"Oussama ben Laden\\". Other spellings include \\"Binladen\\" or, as used by his family in the West, \\"Binladin\\". The decapitalization of bin is based on the convention of leaving short prepositions, articles, and patronymics uncapitalized in surnames; the nasab bin means \\"son of\\". The spellings with o and e come from a Persian-influenced pronunciation also used in Afghanistan, where bin Laden spent many years.  Osama bin Laden's full name, Osama bin Mohammed bin Awad bin Laden, means \\"Osama, son of Mohammed, son of Awad, son of Laden\\". \\"Mohammed\\" refers to bin Laden's father Mohammed bin Laden; \\"Awad\\" refers to his grandfather, Awad bin Aboud bin Laden, a Kindite Hadhrami tribesman; \\"Laden\\" refers not to bin Laden's great-grandfather, who was named Aboud, but to Aboud's father, Laden Ali al-Qahtani.  The Arabic linguistic convention would be to refer to him as \\"Osama\\" or \\"Osama bin Laden\\", not \\"bin Laden\\" alone, as \\"bin Laden\\" is a patronymic, not a surname in the Western manner. According to bin Laden's son Omar bin Laden, the family's hereditary surname is \\"al-Qahtani\\" (Arabic: lqHTny, al-Qahtani), but bin Laden's father, Mohammed bin Laden, never officially registered the name.  Osama bin Laden had also assumed the kunyah \\"Abu 'Abdallah\\" (\\"father of Abdallah\\"). His admirers have referred to him by several nicknames, including the \\"Prince\\" or \\"Emir\\" (l'myr, al-Amir), the \\"Sheik\\" (lshykh, as-Saykh), the \\"Jihadist Sheik\\" or \\"Sheik al-Mujahid\\" (shykh lmjhd, Saykh al-Mujahid), \\"Hajj\\" (Hj, Hajj), and the \\"Director\\". The word usamah ('sm@) means \\"lion\\", earning him the nicknames \\"Lion\\" and \\"Lion Sheik\\".  Osama bin Mohammed bin Awad bin Laden was born in Riyadh, Saudi Arabia, a son of Yemeni Mohammed bin Awad bin Laden, a billionaire construction magnate with close ties to the Saudi royal family, and Mohammed bin Laden's tenth wife, Syrian Hamida al-Attas (then called Alia Ghanem). In a 1998 interview, bin Laden gave his birth date as March 10, 1957.  Mohammed bin Laden divorced Hamida soon after Osama bin Laden was born. Mohammed recommended Hamida to Mohammed al-Attas, an associate. Al-Attas married Hamida in the late 1950s or early 1960s, and they are still together. The couple had four children, and bin Laden lived in the new household with three half-brothers and one half-sister. The bin Laden family made 5 billion in the construction industry, of which Osama later inherited around 25-30 million.  Bin Laden was raised as a devout Sunni Muslim. From 1968 to 1976, he attended the elite secular Al-Thager Model School. He studied economics and business administration at King Abdulaziz University. Some reports suggest he earned a degree in civil engineering in 1979, or a degree in public administration in 1981. One source described him as \\"hard working\\"; another said he left university during his third year without completing a college degree. At university, bin Laden's main interest was religion, where he was involved in both \\"interpreting the Quran and jihad\\" and charitable work. Other interests included writing poetry; reading, with the works of Field Marshal Bernard Montgomery and Charles de Gaulle said to be among his favorites; black stallions; and association football, in which he enjoyed playing at centre forward and followed the English club Arsenal  At age 17 in 1974, bin Laden married Najwa Ghanem at Latakia, Syria; they were separated before September 11, 2001. Bin Laden's other known wives were Khadijah Sharif (married 1983, divorced 1990s); Khairiah Sabar (married 1985); Siham Sabar (married 1987); and Amal al-Sadah (married 2000). Some sources also list a sixth wife, name unknown, whose marriage to bin Laden was annulled soon after the ceremony. Bin Laden fathered between 20 and 26 children with his wives. Many of bin Laden's children fled to Iran following the September 11 attacks and as of 2010, Iranian authorities reportedly continue to control their movements.  Nasser al-Bahri, who was bin Laden's personal bodyguard from 1997-2001, details bin Laden's personal life in his memoir. He describes him as a frugal man and strict father, who enjoyed taking his large family on shooting trips and picnics in the desert.  Bin Laden's father Mohammed died in 1967 in an airplane crash in Saudi Arabia when his American pilot Jim Harrington misjudged a landing. Bin Laden's eldest half-brother, Salem bin Laden, the subsequent head of the bin Laden family, was killed in 1988 near San Antonio, Texas, in the United States, when he accidentally flew a plane into power lines.  The FBI described bin Laden as an adult as tall and thin, between 1.93 m (6 ft 4 in) and 1.98 m (6 ft 6 in) in height and weighing about 73 kilograms (160 lb), although the author Lawrence Wright, in his Pulitzer Prize-winning book on Al-Qaeda, The Looming Tower, writes that a number of bin Laden's close friends confirmed that reports of his height were greatly exaggerated, and that bin Laden was actually \\"just over 6 feet (1.8 m) tall\\". Eventually, after his death, he was measured to be around 1.93 m (6 ft 4 in). Bin Laden had an olive complexion and was left-handed, usually walking with a cane. He wore a plain white keffiyeh. Bin Laden had stopped wearing the traditional Saudi male keffiyeh and instead wore the traditional Yemeni male keffiyeh. Bin Laden was described as soft-spoken and mild-mannered in demeanor. Question: How many wives did he have?. Whats the answer?","output":"Osama bin Laden had a total of five known wives: Najwa Ghanem, Khadijah Sharif, Khairiah Sabar, Siham Sabar, and Amal al-Sadah. Some sources also mention a sixth wife, whose marriage to bin Laden was annulled shortly after the ceremony, but her name is unknown."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Gilliam was born in Minneapolis, Minnesota, the son of Beatrice (nee Vance) and James Hall Gilliam. His father was a travelling salesman for Folgers before becoming a carpenter. Soon after, they moved to nearby Medicine Lake, Minnesota. The family moved to the Los Angeles neighbourhood of Panorama City in 1952. Well, I really want to encourage a kind of fantasy, a kind of magic. I love the term magic realism, whoever invented it - I do actually like it because it says certain things. It's about expanding how you see the world. I think we live in an age where we're just hammered, hammered to think this is what the world is. Television's saying, everything's saying 'That's the world.' And it's not the world. The world is a million possible things.  As for his philosophical background in screenwriting and directing, Gilliam said on the TV show First Hand on RoundhouseTV, \\"There's so many film schools, so many media courses which I actually am opposed to. Because I think it's more important to be educated, to read, to learn things, because if you're gonna be in the media and if you'll have to say things, you have to know things. If you only know about cameras and 'the media', what're you gonna be talking about except cameras and the media? So it's better learning about philosophy and art and architecture [and] literature, these are the things to be concentrating on it seems to me. Then, you can fly...!\\"  His films are usually imaginative fantasies. His long-time co-writer Charles McKeown commented, \\"the theme of imagination, and the importance of imagination, to how you live and how you think and so on ... that's very much a Terry theme.\\" Most of Gilliam's movies include plotlines that seem to occur partly or completely in the characters' imaginations, raising questions about the definition of identity and sanity. He often shows his opposition to bureaucracy and authoritarian regimes. He also distinguishes \\"higher\\" and \\"lower\\" layers of society, with a disturbing and ironic style. His movies usually feature a fight or struggle against a great power which may be an emotional situation, a human-made idol, or even the person himself, and the situations do not always end happily. There is often a dark, paranoid atmosphere and unusual characters who used to be normal members of society. His scripts feature black comedy and often end with a dark tragicomic twist.  Gilliam is fascinated with the Baroque period because of the pronounced struggle between spirituality and rationality in that era. There is often a rich baroqueness and dichotomous eclecticism about his movies, with, for instance, high-tech computer monitors equipped with low-tech magnifying lenses in Brazil and a red knight covered with flapping bits of cloth in The Fisher King. He also is given to incongruous juxtapositions of beauty and ugliness or antique and modern. Regarding Gilliam's theme of modernity's struggle between spirituality and rationality whereas the individual may become dominated by a tyrannical, soulless machinery of disenchanted society, the film critic Keith James Hamel observed a specific affinity of Gilliam's movies with the writings of the economic historian Arnold Toynbee and the sociologist Max Weber, specifically the latter's concept of the \\"iron cage\\" of rationality. What themes did he use?","output":"Looking at the provided text, filmmaker Terry Gilliam uses several recurring themes in his work: 1. Imagination and Fantasy: This is a common thread in Gilliam's films and his long-time co-writer Charles McKeown has also noted this. Gilliam's movies often have storylines in the realm of fantasy or are based on characters' imagination. 2. Reality versus Perception: Gilliam often explores what is real and what isn't in his works, questioning the constructs of identity, sanity and the societal view of the world. 3. Opposition to Authority and Bureaucracy: Gilliam's films often portray a resistance against oppressive power structures and authoritarian regimes, highlighting struggles against such powers which often do not end on a positive note. 4. Dark, Paranoid Atmosphere and Black Comedy: His films usually have a dark atmosphere, with elements of paranoia, black comedy, and unusual characters which feature heavily in his screenplays. The outcomes are often darkly tragicomic. 5. Struggle: Struggle is often represented in different forms, like struggle against emotional situations, human-made constructs or institutions and even oneself.  6. Dichotomy and Contrast: He juxtaposes contrasting elements, such as beauty and ugliness, the antique and the modern, spirituality and rationality.  7. The Baroque Era: Gilliam is particularly interested in this historical period due to its dichotomy between spirituality and rationality. His films carry a \\"baroqueness\\" in their ascetics. 8. Spirituality vs Rationality: This theme concerns the struggle to maintain individual human essence within a disenchanted society dominated by tyrannical, soulless machinery of \\"rationality.\\" These themes are not exhaustive, and other themes can likely be identified in Gilliam's work upon deeper analysis or by looking at his broader filmography."},{"instruction":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

Here is a goal: paint eyes on rock Which way makes more sense to accomplish this goal?","output":"To accomplish the goal of painting eyes on a rock, follow these step-by-step instructions: Step 1: Choose a rock Find a suitable rock for painting. Ideally, the rock should have a smooth surface and be large enough to paint two eyes comfortably. Step 2: Clean the rock Clean the rock by washing it with soap and water to remove dirt, dust, and other loose particles. This will help the paint adhere better to the rock's surface. Dry the rock completely before proceeding. Step 3: Prepare your paint and tools Select the appropriate paint for this type of project. Acrylic paint is a good choice, as it dries quickly, provides solid coverage, and adheres well to most surfaces. You will need black and white paint, as well as other colors if you want to add more details. You will also need a selection of paintbrushes appropriate for the size of your rock and the level of detail you wish to achieve. Step 4: Sketch the eyes Sketch the outlines of the eyes lightly on the rock with a pencil. This will help you get a sense of the proper placement and size of the eyes. Adjust the sketch as necessary to achieve the desired appearance. Step 5: Paint the base color Using a small paintbrush, apply the white paint to the rock over the sketched eyes, filling in the entire eye shape. This will serve as a base color for the eyes, making the other colors more vibrant. Allow the paint to dry completely. Step 6: Paint the iris and pupil Once the white paint is dry, paint the iris (the colored part of the eye) using your chosen color. Then, paint the pupil black in the center of the iris. Allow the paint to dry completely. Step 7: Add details and highlights To further enhance the eyes, add details and highlights. This might include painting eyelashes, adding shading around the iris and pupil, or applying small dots of white paint to mimic light reflections in the eyes. Allow the paint to dry completely. Step 8: Seal the painted rock (optional) If you want to protect the painted eyes from chipping or fading over time, you can seal the rock with a clear, protective spray or brush-on varnish. This is especially important if the rock will be exposed to the elements. By following these steps, you can paint eyes on a rock in a sensible and organized approach."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant. User will you give you a task.

You must generate a detailed and long answer. Which entity is this text about? Jean-Christophe Lafaille (31 March 1965 - 27 January 2006 [presumed]) was a French mountaineer noted for a number of difficult ascents in the Alps and Himalaya, and for what has been described as \\"perhaps the finest self-rescue ever performed in the Himalaya\\", when he was forced to descend the mile-high south face of Annapurna alone with a broken arm, after his climbing partner had been killed in a fall. He climbed eleven of the fourteen eight-thousand-metre peaks, many of them alone or by previously unclimbed routes, but disappeared during a solo attempt to make the first winter ascent of Makalu, the world's fifth highest mountain. On the strength of his climbs in the Alps, Lafaille was invited on an expedition to Annapurna by Pierre Beghin, one of the leading French climbers of the day. The pair attempted the mountain's vast South Face following the monsoon season in October 1992 in Alpine style, with no Sherpa support, pre-stocked campsites or fixed ropes on the upper mountain. They had reached a height of 7,400 metres when bad weather forced them to descend. The pair made a series of abseils down the face, but due to their lightweight approach they had little protective equipment and were often forced to abseil from a single anchor to conserve equipment. On the fourth or fifth abseil, Beghin fell to his death when the single cam he was using as an anchor became dislodged from the rock. Beghin had been carrying most of the pair's technical equipment, including all the ropes, and Lafaille was left alone on the face, a vertical mile above safety.  With great difficulty, Lafaille managed to climb down the 75 degree face to the pair's last bivouac site, where he found 20 metres of thin rope, allowing him to make short abseils down some of the hardest parts. With no technical equipment to use as anchors he was forced to entrust his weight to tent pegs or, on one occasion, a plastic bottle. He finally reached what should have been the relative safety of the top of a fixed rope which he and Beghin had installed on a steep rock band, but almost immediately he was struck by a falling rock, which broke his right arm. Disabled and helpless, he lay on a ledge for two days in the hope that other climbers would rescue him. However, while there was a Slovenian team attempting a route on a different part of the South Face, they judged that a rescue attempt would be too dangerous to undertake, so help never came. The cruellest thing about the ordeal, Lafaille said, was being able to see life in the valley below, and by night, the flashbulbs of trekkers' cameras. In spite of this, he later agreed that the Slovenians had made the right decision in not trying to save him.  Eventually, with all hope of rescue gone, Lafaille resolved to continue down alone. He initially tried to continue abseiling, but unable to control the rope with only one hand and his teeth he reverted to downclimbing one-handed, and was utterly exhausted when he reached the Slovenian team's base camp. By that time the climbers at the base of the mountain had given up hope for him, and his first wife, Veronique, had already been told that he had died. Reinhold Messner later said that the survival instinct he showed was of the sort which defines the best mountaineers.","output":"This text is about Jean-Christophe Lafaille, a French mountaineer known for his difficult ascents in the Alps and Himalayas.

Is \\"Nor is it rational according to Popper to make instead the more complex assumption that the sun will rise until a given day, but will stop doing so the day after, or similar statements with additional conditions.\\" the correct answer?","output":"The person who presented a solution to the philosophical problem of induction, centered around falsifiability, was the philosopher Sir Karl Popper. He was an Austrian-British philosopher and professor in the 20th century and is generally regarded as one of the greatest philosophers of science of the 20th century. Popper was well-known for rejecting the classical inductivist view on scientific method in favor of empirical falsification. He argued that theories cannot be proved, but they can be falsified, meaning that we can discover whether a theory is incorrect. The quote you've mentioned seems to be related to Popper's view, but it doesn't explicitly present his entire concept of falsifiability as a solution to the problem of induction. Therefore, to say that it's the correct answer would be a bit of an oversimplification. Popper discussed at length how the problem of induction relates to the scientific method. Induction — the process in which you draw general conclusions from individual observations — had been seen as a fundamental problem in philosophy because just observing a repeated phenomenon does not guarantee it will always happen that way. For example, the assumption that the sun will rise every day is based on the fact that it has risen every day so far, but it doesn't necessarily prove it will rise again tomorrow. This is an example of the problem of induction, and it's also what the quoted statement speaks to. Popper's response to this problem was the doctrine of falsifiability. He suggested that scientific theories should be framed in such a way that they can be potentially disproved. In other words, rather than seeking to verify a hypothesis by gathering data that supports it, scientists should instead try to falsify the hypothesis by performing tests that could potentially show it's false. For example, the statement \\"all swans are white\\" is hard to prove definitively since it requires examining every swan in existence to ensure none of them are any color other than white. However, it can be easily falsified by finding just one swan of a different color. Therefore, according to Popper, the former statement is unscientific, while the latter statement is scientific, because it can be potentially falsifiable, even if it's not actually falsified yet. So, in short, Sir Karl Popper tackled the problem of induction by proposing falsifiability as a demarcation criterion for science: a statement or theory is scientific if it is testable and potentially falsifiable, even if it's not actually been falsified yet. If it can't be tested or potentially falsified, then, according to Popper, it falls out of the realm of science. This idea revolutionized the philosophy of science and continues to impact how scientific research is conducted today."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant. You will be given a task.

The posts are \\"HISTORICAL\\" when the author has already done something and they are \\"HYPOTHETICAL\\" when the author is considering doing something in the future. Say 'yes' if the claim is true otherwise say 'no' Q: CLAIM : The following post is HISTORICAL. POST : Everyone at this party was ~24. New Year's at my friends was winding down and some couples started swinging. My friend's boyfriend went upstairs to have sex with the host. Friend became chummy with someone's husband, and were intimately snuggling on the couch. I was around to witness this because I was mopping the host's house (the floors were disgusting).   It became time to leave, so I kissed (cheek-to-cheek, how I often say \\"hi\\" and \\"bye\\") my friend and the guy she was with on the loveseat. Grabbed my belongings, and walked past my fiancée on top of these two as she was saying goodbye. I spanked her as I walked by because her ass was in the air and it's sorta a way to say \\"let's get going.\\"   I step outside and begin getting my car ready to leave and about 1.5 minutes later, my fiancée has not yet come outside. I walk back inside to see her still on top of these two, but I hear kissing. I walk over to see her making out with my friend.   To be honest, I was repulsed. The guy my friend was with was greasy and disgusting, and I see my fiancée on top of him, making out with the girl in his arms, his hand on her leg and his face inches away from them as he watches them snog. I was speechless, and pulled out my phone to take a picture. I felt like I wanted her to see what I saw. I had left the flash on, though, so the initial flash (not the flash for the picture) caught my fiancées attention and she looked up. I nervously dropped my phone when the actual picture took, so in a way I'm thankful that I didn't end up with a picture of this scene I have cemented in my memory. It made me very upset, and I just walked away speechless.   Some important INFO: my fiancée and I have been together 8 years, and we have had threesomes and foursomes in the past. However, we have a very clear understanding that we do those things together. I've turned down other people's advances with \\"sorry, I can't do that without my girlfriend here.\\" I think a lot of this pain I felt stems from the fact that she did this without knowing I was present.  Fiancée claims it just happened, and that my friend started the situation. She was also rather drunk and emotional when the situation occurred. She claims it meant nothing, and I completely agree. I know it didn't \\"mean\\" anything, but to me she engaged in sexual behavior with someone without my presence. Insult to injury that the slimeball guy she was on top of was (of course) rather into and enjoying what was happening between the two women on top of him. I hate knowing she gave him a show.  I understand that society sees two women kissing as more socially acceptable than two guys, but I can't help but feel bitter that, had our roles been reversed, it would not have been acceptable at all. We're both bisexual, so this situation happening between me and another guy would not be crazy. But since it's between two girls I'm supposed to enjoy it and be happy about it. That makes me bitter about this as well.   I want my fiancée to apologize sincerely and understand why this has me upset, but she seems to believe that it's not fair for me to place any blame on her for this situation. Ultimately, I know this doesn't matter. It really was just something that happened and did not mean anything. So am I the asshole for being upset and confronting her about it? A:","output":"Part 1: Identifying the post as a real-life anecdote Usage: The post describes a situation that happened at a New Year's party, where the author witnessed their fiancée engaging in physical contact with another person. This meets the criteria as a real-life anecdote because it's a detailed and personal story from the author's life. Part 2: Determining if the post is historical or hypothetical Usage: The post is historical because it details a past event that the author has already experienced. The author describes the event, their reactions, and the aftermath of the situation, all of which have already occurred. Part 3: Verifying the claim about the post being historical or hypothetical Usage: The claim states that the post is historical, and based on the analysis in Part 2, the claim is true.

But they have also been in conflict for years with Turkey, a NATO member that neighbors Syria. And as they expand a zone of control along the Turkish border, they’ve been fighting Syrian rebels allied with the United States, possibly helping President Bashar al-Assad of Syria and his Russian supporters. Turkey has shelled Kurdish forces in Syria and claimed that those forces were connected to terrorist attacks in Ankara. How can Turkish-Kurdish hostilities be kept from driving the fight against ISIS off track, with the Kurds in de facto alliance with Russia?

One group is called the Kurds, and they are very good at beating a bad team called ISIS. But, there is another group called Turkey, and they are friends with the same people who are friends with the Kurds. Sometimes, the Kurds and Turkey don't get along and fight. The grown-ups want to make sure everyone can still focus on beating the bad team, ISIS, without the Kurds and Turkey fighting each other. Also, they don't want the Kurds to become friends with another group called Russia, who some of the other players are not friends with.

Background: Anthony Neil Wedgwood Benn (3 April 1925 - 14 March 2014), originally known as Anthony Wedgwood Benn, but later as Tony Benn, was a British politician, writer, and diarist. He was a Member of Parliament (MP) for 47 years between the 1950 and 2001 general elections and a Cabinet minister in the Labour governments of Harold Wilson and James Callaghan in the 1960s and 1970s. Originally a moderate, he was identified as being on the party's hard left from the early 1980s, and was widely seen as a key proponent of democratic socialism within the party. Benn inherited a peerage on his father's death (as 2nd Viscount Stansgate), which prevented his continuing as an MP. Context: Benn's father had been created Viscount Stansgate in 1942 when Winston Churchill increased the number of Labour peers to aid political work in the House of Lords; at this time, Benn's elder brother Michael was intending to enter the priesthood and had no objections to inheriting a peerage. However, Michael was later killed in an accident while on active service in the Second World War, and this left Benn as the heir to the peerage. He made several unsuccessful attempts to renounce the succession.  In November 1960, Lord Stansgate died. Benn automatically became a peer, preventing him from sitting in the House of Commons. The Speaker of the Commons, Sir Harry Hylton-Foster, did not allow him to deliver a speech from the bar of the House of Commons in April 1961 when the by-election was being called. Continuing to maintain his right to abandon his peerage, Benn fought to retain his seat in a by-election caused by his succession on 4 May 1961. Although he was disqualified from taking his seat, he was re-elected. An election court found that the voters were fully aware that Benn was disqualified, and declared the seat won by the Conservative runner-up, Malcolm St Clair, who was at the time also the heir presumptive to a peerage.  Benn continued his campaign outside Parliament. Within two years, though, the Conservative Government of the time, which had members in the same or similar situation to Benn's (i.e., who were going to receive title, or who had already applied for writs of summons), changed the law. The Peerage Act 1963, allowing lifetime disclaimer of peerages, became law shortly after 6 pm on 31 July 1963. Benn was the first peer to renounce his title, doing so at 6.22 pm that day. St Clair, fulfilling a promise he had made at the time of his election, then accepted the office of Steward of the Manor of Northstead, disqualifying himself from the House (outright resignation not being possible). Benn returned to the Commons after winning a by-election on 20 August 1963. Question: Did Benn worked with anyone else to approve this law?. Whats the answer?","output":"To answer the question of whether Tony Benn worked with anyone else to approve the Peerage Act 1963, let's consider the steps to pass the law in the UK: 1. Assess the context: Benn faced an issue being unable to continue as an MP due to inheriting a peerage. Other MPs were facing or would potentially face similar situations. 2. Benn continued to campaign for change and garnered support from the public and other affected MPs. 3. Recognizing the need for change, the Conservative government introduced the Peerage Act 1963 to address this issue. 4. The proposed law went through parliamentary procedures, including debates, discussions, amendments, and final voting by both Houses of Parliament – the House of Commons and the House of Lords. 5. After the successful passing of the bill in both Houses, it received royal assent and became law. Throughout this process, Benn would have engaged with other politicians, MPs, and lawmakers from both government and opposition parties to advocate for change and gain their support. The fact that the government introduced the Peerage Act 1963 shows that there was collaboration and cooperation among multiple individuals, including Benn, to approve the law. In conclusion, yes, Benn worked with others, including MPs from both the government and opposition parties, to approve the Peerage Act 1963, which allowed him and others in similar situations to renounce their titles and continue serving as MPs."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Test sentence: \\"Although no one else believes it, Harry believes that Sally is innocent.\\" Is this test sentence a correct grammatical English sentence? OPTIONS: I. unacceptable II. acceptable","output":"The test sentence, \\"Although no one else believes it, Harry believes that Sally is innocent,\\" is Option II: acceptable in terms of grammatical correctness in the English language. The sentence is composed of two clauses: a dependent adverbial clause and an independent (main) clause. 1. Dependent adverbial clause: \\"Although no one else believes it,\\" 2. Independent (main) clause: \\"Harry believes that Sally is innocent.\\" The dependent adverbial clause is introduced by the conjunction 'although,' which indicates a contrast between the two clauses. This conjunction signals that the main clause may contain information that is contrary to what people might expect given the context provided by the dependent clause. In the dependent clause, the subject is 'no one else,' and the verb is 'believes.' The object 'it' refers to the belief in Sally's innocence. The use of 'no one else' clarifies that, except for Harry, everyone else has a different belief on the matter. The main clause contains the subject 'Harry,' the verb 'believes,' and the object 'that Sally is innocent.' The object itself is a noun clause that functions as a complete idea within the main clause. Inside the noun clause, 'Sally' is the subject, 'is' is the verb, and 'innocent' is the subject complement that describes Sally's state or condition. The sentence maintains subject-verb agreement as the singular subjects 'no one else' and 'Harry' agree with their respective singular verbs – 'believes' and 'believes.' Additionally, the sentence uses appropriate punctuation; the comma separates the dependent and independent clauses, enhancing readability and clarity. In summary, the test sentence is grammatically correct, structurally sound, and conveys a clear message while maintaining subject-verb agreement and proper punctuation. Therefore, it is an acceptable English sentence."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant. User will you give you a task. Your goal is to complete the task as faithfully as you can.

In this sentence, 'Gig Harbor' and 'Washington', being a town and a state respectively, should be capitalized. Similarly, 'Martinus' as a personal name should also be capitalized. Any letter beginning a full sentence needs to be capitalized as well, hence 'Both' in our sentence is starting with uppercase 'B'. The other words are lowercase as they are common nouns, adjectives, prepositions, conjunctions, etc., which do not generally require capitalization unless they are at the beginning of the sentence. In some contexts, the word 'state' when used before naming a State might be capitalized too. This normally happens in formal documents or those adhering to certain style guides. In the general use case and in the sentence provided, 'state' as a common noun is not capitalized.  It is crucial to follow these rules for capitalization to ensure proper grammar, readability, and clarity in written communication. Capitalization in written English is not only used for proper names but also at the beginning of sentences, which helps to set sentences apart visually, making it easier to read and comprehend what is written."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

In one sentence, describe what the following article is about: It is important to understand that even if you forgive the person, you don't need to let him back into your life. Decide whether you want to rebuild a relationship with him or let him go. In order to this, you need to think long and hard about your relationship. Is it worth rebuilding? Is he likely to hurt you again if you let him back in? In some situations, such as an abusive relationship or a relationship where your partner has cheated multiple times, it is safer and healthier to cut the person out of your life for good. You deserve better. Once you have made the decision to forgive, you need to forget about the past and focus on the future. If you decide that the relationship is worth rebuilding, then you can slowly start to move forward. Let the person know that even though they hurt you, you still love him and want him in your life. If you continue to dwell on past hurts, you will never be able to truly forgive or move forward. Look on the bright side and see this situation as an opportunity to make a fresh start. It might be just what your relationship needs. Once you have been hurt, it can be difficult to rebuild trust. However, it's important that you learn to trust yourself - your judgment and your ability to make well-informed decisions. Then you can work towards rebuilding trust with the other person. Make a commitment to be completely open and honest with one another about everything. Take it one day at a time. Trust can't be earned overnight. You need give the other person time to regain your trust. Try to look on the bright side by making a list of the positive things you can take away from the experience. These might include: realizing the extent of your ability to understand and forgive, gaining valuable life lessons about trust, or having a closer relationship with the person who wronged you since you worked through your issues together.

Don't look at this as another reason to be angry. Instead, see this as an opportunity to heal. Sometimes forgiveness will mean nothing to the person you've given it to and sometimes a relationship just can't be fixed. Even if the situation doesn't resolve itself the way you had hoped, remember that you did the right thing. To forgive is a noble action, and it's one that you won't regret.

How does swine flu spread? D). Many people died of swine flu in Mexico. Read the following article and answer the question. Article: New York City was dealing with a growing public health threat Sunday after tests confirmed that eight students at a private Catholic high school had contracted the same strain( type ) of the swine flu that has ravaged  Mexico. Some of the school's students had visited Cancun on a spring break trip two weeks ago. Officials reported 68 U.S. cases of swine flu in five states so far, with the latest in Ohio and New York. Unlike in Mexico, cases in the United State have been mild and U.S. health authorities can't yet explain why. In New York City, Centers for Disease Control and Prevention confirmed that there were 45 cases, Mayor Michael Bloomberg said. About 100 students at St. Francis Preparatory School complained of flu-like symptoms; further tests will determine how many of those cases are swine flu. St. Francis is the largest private Catholic high school in the nation, with 2,700 students. The school canceled classes on Monday and Tuesday in response to the outbreak. Bloomberg stressed that the New York cases were mild and many are recovering, but said that some family members of students also had flu symptoms. In Mexico, health officials say a strain of swine flu has killed up to 160 people and sickened over 2,000. New York officials said the flu strain discovered in the patients here is the same strain as in Mexico, though all the New York cases are mild.

In the context of the Iron Man comics, the person we are referring to is James Rupert \\"Rhodey\\" Rhodes, who is a fictional character appearing in the Marvel Comics universe.  James Rhodes, or more commonly known as Rhodey, was created by writer David Michelinie and artist Bob Layton. He first appeared in Iron Man #118 in 1979 and is a close friend and ally of Tony Stark, the original Iron Man. Rhodey is a highly skilled and trained US Air Force officer, which made him a suitable choice to don the Iron Man armor. Rhodey initially wore the Iron Man armor when Tony Stark was struggling with alcoholism, making him unable to continue as Iron Man. Rhodes took on the role to help Stark and protect people from various threats. He later went on to have his own codename and armor, known as War Machine, which was a modified and more heavily armed version of the Iron Man suit. In conclusion, the second person ever to wear Iron Man's armor is a human entity named James Rhodes, who eventually took on the moniker War Machine. His introduction into the comic book universe occurred in 1979 and has since been an iconic character within the Marvel Comics franchise, also appearing in various television series and films."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Answer the following question: Twenty first century is seeing an explosion of artificial island building. Many countries are building islands in the middle of seas and oceans, which they often use for tourism or for defensive purposes. For example, UAE had build several islands in the Persian Gulf. To build those islands they had to ask Oman and Qatar to export sand to them. Qatar declined to export sand, but Oman agreed. Oman in turn had to mine huge quantity of sand in their own country.  As a result of sand mining, Would Qatar's fisheries earn more money or less money than Oman's fisheries? Answer:","output":"To answer this question, let us consider the key factors and their potential impact on the earnings of both Qatar and Oman's fisheries. 1. Environment: Sand mining can lead to environmental changes that can affect local marine ecosystems, potentially disrupting the fishing industry. Since Oman agreed to mine large quantities of sand, this may have a negative effect on their fisheries.  2. Export of sand: While Oman is exporting sand to the UAE, it may be benefiting its own economy in the short term through exporting sand, but in the long term, the environmental impact may lead to reduced fish stocks in its waters. 3. Declining sand exports from Qatar: Qatar declined to export sand to the UAE, which could lead to better environmental conditions and undisturbed marine ecosystems, positively impacting their fisheries.  4. Alternative economic activities: Countries might resort to alternative economic activities in response to declining fish stocks. For instance, Oman might promote its tourism sector in order to compensate for the reduced earnings from the fisheries sector. Considering these factors, it is difficult to predict the exact earnings for each country's fisheries. However, it is likely that Qatar's fisheries might earn more money than Oman's fisheries due to better environmental conditions and preserving their marine ecosystem, assuming both countries have similar potential in their fisheries to begin with. It is also important to acknowledge that various other factors such as market demand, management practices, and global economic trends might influence the earnings of both countries' fisheries."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant that follows instruction extremely well.

Mermaids appear in the folklore of many cultures worldwide, including the Near East, Europe, Africa and Asia. The first stories appeared in ancient Assyria, in which the goddess Atargatis transformed herself into a mermaid out of shame for accidentally killing her human lover. Mermaids are sometimes associated with perilous events such as floods, storms, shipwrecks and drownings. In other folk traditions (or sometimes within the same tradition), they can be benevolent or beneficent, bestowing boons or falling in love with humans.  - The Piano is a 1993 New Zealand drama film about a mute piano player and her daughter.

Legends may be transformed over time, in order to keep them fresh and vital, and realistic. Many legends operate within the realm of uncertainty, never being entirely believed by the participants, but also never being resolutely doubted.  - The Brothers Grimm (' or '), Jacob (17851863) and Wilhelm Grimm (17861859), were German academics, philologists, cultural researchers, lexicographers and authors who together specialized in collecting and publishing folklore during the 19th century.

Among his exploits, in the early 20th century, were the infiltration of the German General Staff in 1917 and a near-overthrow of the Bolsheviks in 1918. His reputation with women was as legendary as his genius for espionage.  - A film, also called a movie, motion picture, theatrical film or photoplay, is a series of still images which, when shown on a screen, creates the illusion of moving images due to the phi phenomenon. This optical illusion causes the audience to perceive continuous motion between separate objects viewed rapidly in succession. The process of filmmaking is both an art and an industry. A film is created by photographing actual scenes with a motion picture camera; by photographing drawings or miniature models using traditional animation techniques; by means of CGI and computer animation; or by a combination of some or all of these techniques and other visual effects.  - Jurassic Park III is a 2001 American science-fiction adventure film and the third installment in the \\"Jurassic Park\\" film series.

Article: Scholars now believe that the Arian Party was not monolithic, but held drastically different theological views that spanned the early Christian theological spectrum. They supported the tenets of Origenist thought and theology, but had little else in common. Moreover, many labelled \\"Arian\\" did not consider themselves followers of Arius. In addition, non-Homoousian bishops disagreed with being labeled as followers of Arius, since Arius was merely a presbyter, while they were fully ordained bishops. However, others point to the Council of Nicaea as proof in and of itself that Arianism was a real theological ideology.[citation needed] Question: Did Arians have one set of beliefs?","output":"Based on the information presented in the article, it appears that the Arian Party did not strictly adhere to a single, unified set of beliefs. The term \\"Arian\\" seems to encompass a wide range of theological views within the early Christian theological spectrum. While these individuals generally supported the tenets of Origenist thought and theology, they held diverging opinions on other topics. This indicates that the Arian Party was far from monolithic, and the label \\"Arian\\" may not accurately capture the nuance of its members' beliefs. Additionally, it is crucial to note that not everyone identified as an Arian considered themselves to be followers of Arius. Arius, a presbyter, has often been credited as the basis for Arian theology. However, non-Homoousian bishops opposed being labeled as followers of Arius, arguing that they were fully ordained bishops and did not acknowledge Arius as their theological leader. This suggests that the term \\"Arian\\" should be used cautiously and might not always represent a person's theological views accurately. Despite the diversity of beliefs within the so-called Arian Party, some argue that the Council of Nicaea serves as evidence that Arianism existed as a real theological ideology. The Council, held in 325 AD, aimed to address the Arian controversy and establish a unified doctrine regarding the relationship between God the Father and Jesus Christ. While this council may indicate that Arianism was a distinct and influential perspective at that time, it is essential to recognize that the theological views encapsulated within the Arian label were not entirely homogeneous. In conclusion, while the Arian Party shared specific commonalities, such as endorsing the principles of Origenist thought and theology, there was no single, unified set of beliefs among its members. Members of the Arian Party held drastically different theological views, and many did not even consider themselves followers of Arius.

He's given strict instructions not to damage the vehicle or pick up any hitchhikers. Sean is driving cross country when he picks up Nick, a hitchhiker who happens to be a vampire hunter hunting a group of vampires led by one of the Forsaken--a group of knights who made a pact with the fallen angel Abaddon to live forever. Two of the Forsaken are located in the United States (including the one Nick is tracking, Kit). Nick was bitten and infected by a vampire but, thanks to an antiviral drug cocktail, the vampire virus is kept at bay. Each of the Forsaken carry a unique strain of vampirism; killing a Forsaken kills his entire bloodline and reverses the condition of anyone infected. Nick believes that if he kills Kit, he will be cured before he turns (as the drug cocktail eventually will lose effect). At first Sean is less than willing to indulge his new acquaintance; however, he is convinced after the two come across a disoriented young woman, Megan, at a diner, who was bitten by the vampires and left for dead. Nick also proves he is telling the truth by killing a vampire, Teddy, with exposure to sunlight.

Step 3: Considering potential topics - Considering the source is \\"Reuters\\", it could possibly be related to news or current events. \\"New York\\" could mean it is about an event in New York. However, these are merely guesses because of the limited information provided. Conclusion: Therefore, due to a lack of context and specific information, it is not possible to accurately determine the topic from this sentence alone."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

The delays moving medically fit patients out of hospital beds and back to their communities because of social care problems have been well documented. BBC research published on Wednesday underlines the scale of the delays finding beds for new patients coming through hospital front doors. From 2.7% of all emergency admissions in English hospitals in 2010-11, the proportion of patients enduring waits of more than four hours before beds could be found had risen above 11% by 2015-16. The trend was described as \\"deeply worrying\\" by NHS Providers, which represents trusts. All this paints a picture of a hospital system clogged up with delays throughout the process of assessing, treating and discharging patients. Bed occupancy in many trusts is above the 85% level recommended as a safe maximum. But the experience of one hospital trust suggests there are realistic solutions. Sherwood Forest Hospitals Foundation Trust, in the East Midlands, was one of the worst performers in England two winters ago. On one day, there were 17 patients who had spent 12 hours or more on trolleys waiting for beds to be made available. The proportion of patients treated or assessed within four hours was 88%, well below the 95% target. The trust was in special measures and, by its own admission, struggling. A new management team was determined to work out what was going wrong and make a significant improvement for patients. Focusing on patient flow and the emergency system were repeatedly stressed as top priorities for staff. The trust could not do it alone, and co-operation with local community leaders was sought. Local GPs were encouraged to monitor those elderly patients who were most at risk, with every effort made to meet their care needs at home and reduce visits to hospital. The fruits of that collaborative approach can be seen in the main trust hospital, King's Mill in Mansfield. A bold, bright sign saying: \\"Emergency Care\\" guides all patients to the same entrance. Once inside the door, you find a primary care centre close to where people are first seen by triage nurses. GPs are on hand to deal with patients who are not seriously ill or injured. That reduces the flow of people into the emergency department. Inside the hospital, social care representatives sit alongside NHS staff. Along with other care workers funded by the local clinical commissioning group, they have a relentless focus on moving elderly patients out of the hospital once they are fit to for discharge. Three meetings per day closely monitor bed occupancy, with the aim of leaving some beds free overnight ready for the morning influx of new cases. Dr Andy Haynes, executive medical director, uses a phrase familiar in sporting circles to describe their philosophy - \\"marginal gains\\". That means a series of small changes that collectively deliver better results. Dr Haynes says: \\"It's in the context of removing the usual institutional barriers, so we've thought, 'What is best for patients here?' \\"These little things, when you join them up and line them up, deliver a significant change.\\" The stats at Sherwood Forest, which came out of the special measures regime in November, tell their own story. Average stays in hospital have been reduced. The number of long trolley waits is dramatically lower. In the past few weeks, more than 96% of people coming into the emergency department have been treated or assessed within four hours. That has been achieved even with higher numbers arriving at the front door. Nobody at Sherwood Forest thinks they have found all the answers. They know there could be a difficult winter ahead. But they feel they have learned lessons that could be relevant to all hospitals. 11% of emergency patients face a 4 hour \\"trolley wait\\" 5x increase in numbers waiting over 4 hours for a bed since 2011 474,453 patients waited +4 hours for a bed 2015-16 97,559 patients waited +4 hours for a bed 2010-11 What is a summary of this text?","output":"Delays in moving medically fit patients out of hospital beds back to their communities due to social care issues have led to a clogged hospital system. BBC research reveals that the proportion of patients waiting more than four hours for beds after emergency admissions in English hospitals has increased from 2.7% in 2010-11 to over 11% in 2015-16. Sherwood Forest Hospitals Foundation Trust, which was struggling in special measures two years ago, has collaborated with local community leaders and focused on patient flow and emergency systems to improve its figures. By encouraging the monitoring and treatment of elderly patients at home, the trust has reduced the flow of non-serious patients into the emergency department and achieved a 96% rate for treating or assessing patients within four hours in recent weeks."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Question: \\"What effect is displayed on a disc with 77 lines, spinning at 77.92 rpm, when exposed to 50 Hz light?\\"  Context: \\"In 1925, 78.26 rpm was chosen as the standard because of the introduction of the electrically powered synchronous turntable motor. This motor ran at 3600 rpm, such that a 46:1 gear ratio would produce 78.26 rpm. In parts of the world that used 50 Hz current, the standard was 77.92 rpm (3,000 rpm with a 77:2 ratio), which was also the speed at which a strobe disc with 77 lines would \\"stand still\\" in 50 Hz light (92 lines for 60 Hz). After World War II these records were retroactively known as 78s, to distinguish them from other newer disc record formats. Earlier they were just called records, or when there was a need to distinguish them from cylinders, disc records.\\"  Answer: The answer to this question is:","output":"The effect displayed on a disc with 77 lines, spinning at 77.92 rpm, when exposed to 50 Hz light, is known as the stroboscopic effect or strobe effect. The stroboscopic effect occurs when a rotating object appears stationary or slowed down in its motion due to the interaction between the object's rotating speed and the frequency of light. In this case, the disc with 77 lines spinning at 77.92 rpm appears \\"standing still\\" or stationary when exposed to 50 Hz light. This phenomenon is used for RPM calibration and is commonly observed with strobe discs or strobe lights. The concept of the stroboscopic effect can be explained through the relationship between the rotational speed, the light frequency, and the lines on the disc. When the rotational speed of the disc and the light frequency harmonize, the observer perceives the lines on the disc as stationary or slow-moving. This effect is significant in the scenario provided, as the 77-line disc rotating at 77.92 rpm matched the standard speed for 50 Hz current regions, allowing a 77:2 gear ratio to sync with the strobe light. The stroboscopic effect was a useful tool during the time of vinyl records, as it allowed for accurate calibration of turntable speeds for optimal audio playback. The spinning disc with specific lines would assist the users in ensuring the correct rotation speed of their turntables matched the standard speeds to play the records appropriately. To summarize, when a disc with 77 lines spins at 77.92 rpm and is exposed to 50 Hz light, the stroboscopic effect is displayed, causing the disc to appear standing still or drastically slowed down in its rotation. This phenomenon was a helpful tool for calibrating turntable speeds in regions with 50 Hz electrical systems, ensuring proper playback of vinyl records at the correct rotation speed."},{"instruction":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

Answer the following question: Process:  - A larva is born - The caterpillar eats constantly until it grows bigger - The caterpillar starts to form a cocoon around itself - The caterpillar becomes a pupa - After some time the cocoon hatches - And a butterfly is born.  Perturbation hypothesis: suppose more butterflies in the environment happens, how will it affect less caterpillar grows.  Does the supposed perturbation have an effect (direct or indirect) on the process? Answer:","output":"The perturbation hypothesis suggests that an increase in the number of butterflies in the environment could potentially affect the number of caterpillars that develop into adult butterflies. This would mean that there could be a possible direct or indirect impact on the life cycle process of these insects. In order to thoroughly examine the potential effects of this hypothesis, it is essential to take into account various factors and interactions that may be involved in the dynamics between butterflies and caterpillars in the environment. Here are several aspects to consider when assessing the potential impacts of this hypothesis: 1. Resource Competition: An increase in the butterfly population means more adult butterflies are laying eggs, which in turn results in a larger number of caterpillars sharing the same resources. Caterpillars are voracious eaters, so if there is a significant increase in caterpillar populations, they may deplete available food sources more rapidly than they can be replenished, leading to a decline in caterpillar growth. In this case, the perturbation would have an indirect effect on the process. 2. Predator-Prey Relationships: The presence of more butterflies in the environment could attract more predators, which might lead to a decrease in the caterpillar population by predation. If predators start to focus more on consuming caterpillars, it could slow down the development process or even lead to fewer caterpillars surviving to the pupa stage, thereby reducing the number of new butterflies produced. Thus, the perturbation could have an indirect, negative impact on the process. 3. Parasites and Diseases: A larger butterfly population could also lead to the increased prevalence of parasites and diseases that affect both caterpillars and butterflies. With more hosts available, these parasites and diseases may become more widespread, which could negatively affect caterpillar growth and survival, as well as reduce the overall butterfly population. This would be an indirect effect of the perturbation. 4. Adaptation and Evolution: In the long run, increased competition for resources and potential changes in predator-prey relationships might drive adaptation and evolution in both caterpillars and butterflies. They could potentially become more efficient at consuming resources or develop new survival strategies to cope with the higher population density. Such changes could stabilize the population dynamics over time, causing the perturbation to have a less significant effect on the process. 5. Environmental Factors: In cases where the surrounding environment is resilient and able to support a higher number of caterpillars and butterflies, the perturbation effect might not be as pronounced. The availability of resources, weather conditions, and other environmental factors could provide a buffer that diminishes the impact of increased butterfly numbers on caterpillar development. In conclusion, the supposed perturbation could have direct or indirect effects on the life cycle process of butterflies, depending on various factors such as resource competition, predator-prey relationships, parasites and diseases, adaptation and evolution, and environmental conditions. The actual impact would depend on the specific context in which the population increase occurs and how the ecological community responds to the changes. In some scenarios, the perturbation could lead to negative consequences for caterpillar growth and development, whereas in other situations, it may have a lesser impact or ultimately result in population stabilization due to various biological and environmental factors."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Recording sessions for the album began on October 31, 1988, at Downtown Recorders in Boston, Massachusetts, at the time a professional 24-track studio. 4AD allowed the Pixies a budget of 40,000, excluding producer's fees. This was a modest sum for a 1980s major label album; however, it quadrupled the amount spent on the band's previous album, Surfer Rosa. Along with Norton, two assistant recording engineers and two second assistants were assigned to the project. The sessions lasted three weeks, concluding on November 23, with \\"nearly a song a day\\" being recorded.Production and mixing began on November 28. The band relocated to Carriage House Studios, a residential studio in Stamford, Connecticut, to oversee production and record further tracks. Norton recruited Steve Haigler as mixing engineer, whom he had worked with at Fort Apache Studios. During production, Haigler and Norton added layers of guitars and vocals to songs, including overdubbed guitars on \\"Debaser\\" and double tracking vocals on \\"Wave of Mutilation\\". During the recordings, Norton advised Francis to alter several songs; a noted example being \\"There Goes My Gun\\" which was originally intended as a much faster Hüsker Dü-style song. However, at Norton's advice, Francis slowed down the tempo.Norton's suggestions were not always welcome, and several instances of advice to add verses and increase track length contributed to the front man's building frustration. Eventually, Francis took Norton to a record store, where he handed him a copy of Buddy Holly's Greatest Hits, in which most of the songs are about two minutes long. He told Norton, \\"If it's good enough for Buddy Holly ...\\" In a  Rolling Stone interview, Francis later recalled that \\"this record is him trying to make us, shall I say, commercial, and us trying to remain somewhat grungy\\". Production continued until December 12, 1988, with Norton and Haigler adding extra effects, including gated reverb to the mix. The master tapes were then sent for final post-production later that month.","output":"The full name of the artist whose greatest hits album was given as an example by the lead singer of the band trying to \\"remain somewhat grungy\\" is Charles Hardin Holley, known professionally as Buddy Holly.

George Banister, 19, pulled the weapon on the horrified shop keeper in the West End of Newcastle. He then threatened to shoot shopkeeper Mohammed Rafiq, who bravely chased the teen out of his shop. Robbery: George Banister, 19, is caught on camera holding up a Newcastle shop for the sake of a few cans of beer. The thug later posted a picture of himself posing in a mask and holding the gun on Facebook. Banister was a known offender in the area and admitted robbery and a series of other assaults at Newcastle Crown Court. He was jailed for 6 years. Sending him to a young offender. institution, Judge Brian Forster QC told him: 'You pulled an imitation. weapon and threatened to shoot the shop owner and you later boasted. about it on Facebook. 'The courts have to protect local shopkeepers and deter people from behaving in the way you behaved. 'You answer for terrifying repeated acts of violence and you show no regard for other members of the community.' The court heard how Banister and another 17-year-old went into Fenham Discount Store about 5pm on August 9. The youth then stole a pack of 24 cans of lager and left the shop, moments before Banister came in pointing a gun at the shopkeeper. Despite chasing the raider out of his shop, he was unable to get the stolen beer back. Two. hours after the robbery Banister was bragging on Facebook about having. committed it, wearing a mask and posing with the BB gun he used in the. raid. Jailed: Career criminal Banister was jailed for six years after he admitted robbery and a series of other assaults. Caroline McGuirk, prosecuting, said: 'The defendant threatened to shoot the shop owner, who nevertheless pursued him. 'Mr. Rafiq said he was very scared when the weapon was pointed at him but he. felt he couldn’t let them get away with it so he chased them. 'He says the incident has caused him a lot of stress, harassment and fear.' This is not the only of Banister's shocking crimes. Last January Banister assaulted Abigail Pollard, who hours later tragically hanged herself.

Question: I remember back in the late 1970’s when I first started investing in property as a young guy, being taken to a house that felt EXTREMELY cold, strange, and rather chilling. Okay it was an older house that need some renovation work, but there was something about the place that just did not seem right. But despite that, it was available for purchase at what seemed to be a very attractive price … always a good starting point. Anyway, the real estate agent finished taking me around the property answering the questions that I had, and I left with a plan to do some costings before making a decision. But something was niggling me and making me feel a little uncomfortable, so I decided to investigate the property further. A couple of days later I was around at a friends house. He was in the Police force and as it happened he was in the same neighbourhood, I mentioned this particular property that I was looking at buying. He asked me the actual address after which he ‘kindly’ informed me that that that house had been the scene of a murder 6 months previously. It turned out that the property had been rented to a homosexual couple and that after an argument, one had murdered the other in the bath and then proceeded to cut his head off. Apparently the head was subsequently discovered a week later in the trunk of a car that had been abandoned up by a local golf-course. Less than impressed that the real estate agent had been less than forthcoming with me, I made the decision to not to proceed with the purchase. As they say in the property business ‘Location, Location, Location’ is always an important factor in determining the value of a property. However despite that being a good location, it was reputation that deterred me on that occasion. Sometimes there are situations where even the best makeover will not work.

Question: I read this background article the other day: The body's second line of defense against pathogens includes the inflammatory response. If bacteria enter the skin through a scrape, the area may become red, warm, and painful. These are signs of inflammation. Inflammation is one way the body reacts to infections or injuries. Inflammation is caused by chemicals that are released when skin or other tissues are damaged. The chemicals cause nearby blood vessels to dilate, or expand. This increases blood flow to the damaged area, which makes the area red and slightly warm. The chemicals also attract white blood cells called neutrophils to the wound and cause them to leak out of blood vessels into the damaged tissue.  I am facing a new situation today: Ryan is carrying groceries from his car back to his apartment when he trips and falls landing on his knees. Embarrassed, he gets back up, picks up his groceries and carries them into his apartment with his head down. After putting his groceries away, he notices that although both of his knees are scraped, only his left knee is warm to the touch. His right knee feels cool when he puts his hand on it.  Using the knowledge I acquired from the background article, how should I answer correctly the following question regarding my new situation: Is more blood flowing to the right or left knee? Answer:","output":"More blood is flowing to Ryan's left knee. When he fell, both of his knees got scraped, but the signs of inflammation - redness and warmth - are present only in his left knee. This indicates that there is an increased blood flow to the left knee, as a result of the inflammation caused by chemicals released when the tissues were damaged. These chemicals cause the nearby blood vessels to dilate, or expand, increasing blood flow to the damaged area. This makes the area red and slightly warm, just like Ryan's left knee. His right knee, being cool to touch, does not show these signs of inflammation, suggesting that there is no significant increase in blood flow to that knee."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Interestingly, Marañón found that most of these patients felt something but in the absence of an actual emotion-evoking stimulus, the patients were unable to interpret their physiological arousal as an experienced emotion. Schachter did agree that physiological reactions played a big role in emotions. He suggested that physiological reactions contributed to emotional experience by facilitating a focused cognitive appraisal of a given physiologically arousing event and that this appraisal was what defined the subjective emotional experience. Emotions were thus a result of two-stage process: general physiological arousal, and experience of emotion. For example, the physiological arousal, heart pounding, in a response to an evoking stimulus, the sight of a bear in the kitchen. The brain then quickly scans the area, to explain the pounding, and notices the bear. Consequently, the brain interprets the pounding heart as being the result of fearing the bear. With his student, Jerome Singer, Schachter demonstrated that subjects can have different emotional reactions despite being placed into the same physiological state with an injection of epinephrine. Subjects were observed to express either anger or amusement depending on whether another person in the situation (a confederate) displayed that emotion. Hence, the combination of the appraisal of the situation (cognitive) and the participants' reception of adrenaline or a placebo together determined the response. This experiment has been criticized in Jesse Prinz's (2004) Gut Reactions.\\"  Answer: The answer is:","output":"Gregorio was from Spain."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Article: When an NBA player is young he thinks he can win the championship by himself. It is only later when he has aged and been through many battles that he learns an important lesson: there is no \\"I \\" in \\"team\\". There is no better example of the value of teamwork than the Boston Celtics. Paul Pierce, Ray Allen and Kevin Garnett were all superstars on three different teams. Yet, none of them had any titles to show for it. Then, last season, they decided to sacrifice money and individual statistics to play together. Garnett and Allen joined Pierce on the Celtics and changed the NBA in the process. It started in simple ways. Garnett and Allen are two of the most intense athletes in the world. They treat every second of every practice like it is the NBA championship. If you want to play alongside them then you will have to do the same. So, the young guys on the Celtics started giving their full effort too. Pierce had been the star of the Celtics for many years. He used to shoot the ball many times a game. But with the addition of Allen and Garnett he shot less and focused on defense. His selflessness showed the young players that doing what made the team better was the only thing that mattered. When the Celtics were winning and the game was almost over, Garnett, Pierce and Allen would come out of the game. But they wouldn't just sit on the bench. Instead, they stood and cheered and screamed for their teammates. They wanted to support their friends and teammates. Now, the guys who don't play know they can still affect the game by cheering so they scream and cheer when Garnett, Allen and Pierce are playing. The Celtics have developed a strong relationship. They are more than just teammates. They are brothers. The result: the Boston Celtics won the championship and are considered the favorites to win the Eastern Conference championship again this year. There is a saying that goes, \\"A successful team beats with one heart.\\" If that is the case, the Celtics may have the biggest heart in the NBA. Question: Which of the following is NOT true about Pierce's recent performance? Yes or no, is the answer \\"He became an even better shooter with others' help.\\"? A:","output":"No, the answer is not \\"He became an even better shooter with others' help.\\" The article states that Pierce shot the ball less often and focused on defense after the addition of Allen and Garnett to the team, indicating a shift in his role rather than an improvement in his shooting with their help."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Translate to English","output":"In writing - The problem of human trafficking has been haunting us for a long time, but instead of trying to solve it, member states are blamed for their individual and collective failure to address this exploitation and degradation of women. Human trafficking has been a persistent and troubling issue in our global society for an extensive period. This heinous crime not only violates the fundamental human rights of the victims but also leaves an indelible mark on their physical and emotional well-being. The exploitation and degradation of women, in particular, has remained a critical component of this issue, as they are often specifically targeted by traffickers for various forms of exploitation, such as forced labor and sexual enslavement. Despite the gravity of the situation, efforts to combat human trafficking have been continually hindered by various factors, such as the ineffective implementation of policies, inadequate cooperation among states, and the lack of comprehensive support systems for victims. Consequently, instead of collectively working towards a solution, member states often find themselves caught in a vicious cycle of blame and finger-pointing, further exacerbating the problem. In order to tackle human trafficking effectively, it is crucial for member states to recognize the need for a collaborative and united approach. This includes implementing strong domestic policies that not only identify and punish the traffickers but also provide necessary protection and support to the trafficking victims. Additionally, it is essential for states to share information, intelligence, and resources in a harmonized manner to thwart cross-border trafficking networks and dismantle their operations. Moreover, there is a need to excel in both prevention and intervention, to safeguard vulnerable populations from falling prey to traffickers in the first place. This can be achieved through extensive public awareness campaigns, education programs, and the promotion of equal rights and opportunities for women and other marginalized groups. Social and economic empowerment initiatives can play a pivotal role in tackling the root causes of vulnerability that create a fertile ground for human trafficking. Lastly, it is vital to acknowledge and address the role of demand in perpetuating human trafficking. To achieve this, it is necessary for states to dismantle the prevailing misconceptions about the issue and raise awareness about the reality and complexity of the crime. Fostering a culture of zero tolerance towards human trafficking will not only serve as a deterrent to potential exploiters but will also help dismantle the market that drives this crime. In conclusion, the problem of human trafficking calls for a united and strategic approach, underpinned by effective policies, awareness, and targeted support for victims. It is by recognizing this shared responsibility and taking collective action that we can finally put an end to the exploitation and degradation of women and other vulnerable populations affected by human trafficking."},{"instruction":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

Basically, my first experience was a very pushy salesperson at a wedding fair several years ago which really put me off the brand, and it took me a while to try their products again. But when I did I was really impressed, and I can honestly say that nothing I’ve reviewed since has disappointed me! Today I’m reviewing Temple Spa Trufflesque, an Ultra  Hydration & Radiance Masque for the face. Trufflesque aims to give hydration and radiance to the skin, and plumps to help reduce the appearance of fine lines and wrinkles. It’s a luxury mask suitable for all skin types, particularly dry or dull skin, and it helps to rejuvenate tired skin too. The impressive list of ingredients includes black truffles, gold and silk peptides, but unfortunately these expensive additives contribute to Trufflesque’s slightly expensive price tag. The first thing that strikes me about this product is the amazing packaging. All Temple Spa products have really amazing, premium packaging, and I feel that they add to the feeling that you are about to use something really special on your skin. The dark glass jar has a gold lid and it is nestled in a gold and chocolate brown box with the most amazingly cute mask brush slotted in too. The mask itself is gold and it shimmers so prettily, if you look closely it’s almost as if you can see the particles of real gold! To apply you just paint the golden mask onto your face with the cute little brush (it makes applying the mask so easy) then leave for 15-20 minutes.  The mask doesn’t dry completely, it stays a little bit tacky to the touch, and I find that it makes my skin tingle quite a bit. For extra benefits you can also then massage the mask into your skin for around 2 minutes, before removing with a damp muslin cloth or flannel.

In 1980, NLAP used 63,000 in LSC funds to buy property at 607 Main St. in Conway, the letter said. On Nov. 14, 2001, NLAP transferred title of the King Street building in Charleston to the Charleston County Bar Association, according to county property records. The local bar paid 5 for the building, which sits between a redeveloped office building and an antique shop. The local bar said it would maintain the building for \\"legal services to indigent residents of Charleston County and coastal South Carolina,\\" the records said. The King Street building appears to be vacant. Notices at the entrance direct visitors to the equal justice center on West Montague Avenue in North Charleston. E. Douglas Pratt-Thomas, president of the local bar, was not available for comment. Charleston County has not appraised the King Street property because it is tax-exempt.

Q: Remy picked up the pace because Tracy was running very fast in the race.  Given the context: Why did Remy do this? A:","output":"Remy picked up the pace because Tracy was running very fast in the race, and there are a few reasons as to why Remy decided to do this, based on the given context: 1. Competition: Remy might have seen Tracy as a competitor in the race and wanted to keep up with her or even surpass her. In sports, competition often drives athletes to push themselves harder and perform better. When Remy saw Tracy running fast, it probably ignited a competitive spirit within them, which motivated Remy to increase their own speed. 2. Benchmarking: Remy could have perceived Tracy's performance as an indication of the race's overall pace, and used it as a benchmark for their own speed. Tracy's speed might have given Remy an idea of the speed they needed to maintain or improve upon to stay competitive within the race. By picking up their own pace, Remy would be more likely to maintain an advantageous position among the other participants. 3. Team Strategy: If Remy and Tracy were teammates, Remy might have picked up the pace to maintain their team's momentum and the overall team strategy. In some races, teammates work together to pace each other and bring out the best in one another. Remy would have seen the need to stay close to Tracy in order to support her and achieve a higher team placing in the race. 4. Personal Goals: Remy could also have personal goals in the race, such as setting a new personal record or achieving a specific finishing time. When they saw Tracy running fast, it might have served as a reminder to Remy to maintain a certain pace to achieve their own personal objectives. In this case, Remy's acceleration is due to their individual ambition and drive. 5. Adrenaline and Motivation: Sometimes, when athletes observe their peers giving their best efforts, it can create a surge of adrenaline and motivation. Remy could have been inspired by Tracy's speed and enthusiasm, which prompted them to pick up their own pace. This is a natural response in a competitive environment, and such positive energy can be contagious, pushing individuals to perform at their highest level. In summary, Remy decided to pick up the pace because of factors such as competition, benchmarking, team strategy, personal goals, and adrenaline. All these factors contributed towards Remy's decision to increase their speed, in order to achieve better results in the race and make the most of the situation."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Article: As Artificial Intelligence(AI) becomes increasingly sophisticated, there are growing concerns that robots could become a threat. This danger can be avoided, according to computer science professor Stuart Russell, if we figure out how to turn human values into a programmable code. Russell argues that as robots take on more complicated tasks, it's necessary to translate our morals into AI language. For example, if a robot does chores around the house, you wouldn't want it to put the pet cat in the oven to make dinner for the hungry children. \\"You would want that robot preloaded with a good set of values,\\" said Russell. Some robots are already programmed with basic human values. For example, mobile robots have been programmed to keep a comfortable distance from humans. Obviously there are cultural differences, but if you were talking to another person and they came up close in your personal space, you wouldn't think that's the kind of thing a properly brought-up person would do. It will be possible to create more sophisticated moral machines, if only we can find a way to set out human values as clear rules. Robots could also learn values from drawing patterns from large sets of data on human behavior. They are dangerous only if programmers are careless. The biggest concern with robots going against human values is that human beings fail to so sufficient testing and they've produced a system that will break some kind of taboo . One simple check would be to program a robot to check the correct course of action with a human when presented with an unusual situation. If the robot is unsure whether an animal is suitable for the microwave, it has the opportunity to stop, send out beeps , and ask for directions from a human. If we humans aren't quite sure about a decision, we go and ask somebody else. The most difficult step in programming values will be deciding exactly what we believe in moral, and how to create a set of ethical rules. But if we come up with an answer, robots could be good for humanity. Question: What does the author say about the threat of robots? - It may constitute a challenge to computer progranmers. - It accompanies all machinery involving high technology. - It can be avoided if human values are translated into their language. - It has become an inevitable peril as technology gets more sophisticated.

First, we have to find the value of k from the given equation. The equation is:    267*k - 13*k + 2047 = -9129 2. Now, we have two terms with k (267*k and -13*k). We can combine these two terms:    (267 - 13)*k + 2047 = -9129 3. Now subtract 13 from 267:    254*k + 2047 = -9129 4. To make our equation easier, let's move the \\"+ 2047\\" from the left side of the equation to the right side. We do this by subtracting 2047 from both sides:    254*k = -9129 - 2047 5. Now, calculate -9129 - 2047:    254*k = -11176 6. Finally, to find the value of k, we need to divide both sides of the equation by 254:    k = -11176/254 7. After dividing, we get the value of k:    k = -44 So the answer is k = -44."},{"instruction":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation. Think like you are answering to a five year old. Answer by taking a quote from the following article: Joy Division were an English post-punk band formed in 1976 in Salford, Greater Manchester. Originally named Warsaw, the band consisted of singer-songwriter Ian Curtis, guitarist and keyboardist Bernard Sumner, bass player Peter Hook and drummer Stephen Morris. The band was formed by Sumner and Hook after attending a 4 June 1976 Sex Pistols concert at the Lesser Free Trade Hall in Manchester. While Joy Division's early recordings were heavily influenced by early punk, they evolved a unique sound, aided by producer Martin Hannett, which earned their reputation as pioneers of the post-punk movement. Despite their short career, Joy Division have exerted a wide-reaching influence. John Bush of AllMusic argues that Joy Division \\"became the first band in the post-punk movement by [...] emphasizing not anger and energy but mood and expression, pointing ahead to the rise of melancholy alternative music in the '80s.\\"  Joy Division have influenced bands as diverse as contemporaries U2 and the Cure to artists such as Radiohead, Nine Inch Nails, Neurosis, Interpol, Bloc Party, the Editors and rap artists. Rapper Danny Brown is known to have named one of his albums after the Joy Division song \\"Atrocity Exhibition\\", whose title was partially inspired by the 1970 J. G. Ballard collection of condensed novels of the same name. In 2005, both New Order and Joy Division were inducted into the UK Music Hall of Fame.  The band's dark sound, which Martin Hannett described in 1979 as \\"dancing music with Gothic overtones\\", presaged the gothic rock genre. While the term \\"gothic\\" originally described a \\"doomy atmosphere\\" in music of the late 1970s, the term was soon applied to specific bands like Bauhaus that followed in the wake of Joy Division and Siouxsie and the Banshees. Standard musical fixtures of early gothic rock bands included \\"high-pitched post-Joy Division basslines usurp[ing] the melodic role\\" and \\"vocals that were either near operatic and Teutonic or deep, droning alloys of Jim Morrison and Ian Curtis.\\"  Joy Division have been dramatised in two biopics. 24 Hour Party People (2002) is a fictionalised account of the rise and fall of Factory Records in which members of the band served as supporting characters. Tony Wilson said of the film, \\"It's all true, it's all not true. It's not a fucking documentary\\", and that he favoured the \\"myth\\" over the truth. The 2007 film Control, directed by Anton Corbijn, is a biography of Ian Curtis (portrayed by Sam Riley) that uses Deborah Curtis's biography of her late husband, Touching from a Distance (1995), as its basis. Control had its international premiere on the opening night of Director's Fortnight at the 2007 Cannes Film Festival, where it was critically well received. That year Grant Gee directed the band documentary Joy Division. is there one main legacy here?","output":"Joy Division is a very important band because they were the first in the post-punk movement. They focused on sharing their feelings through their music instead of just being angry and energetic. This led to more emotional and sad songs becoming popular in the 1980s. They also helped to create the gothic rock genre, with their dark and mysterious sound. Lots of other bands took inspiration from them, and their special sound can still be heard in music today."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant. You will be given a task.

Answer the following question: One day after a mass shooting killed 49 people at a gay nightclub in Orlando, Florida, presumptive Republican presidential nominee Donald Trump reiterated his support for a plan to temporarily ban Muslims from entering the United States. At a campaign rally in New Hampshire Monday, Trump promised his supporters that, if elected, he would use the executive powers to \\"suspend immigration from areas of the world where there is a proven history of terrorism against the United States, Europe or our allies, until we fully understand how to end these threats.\\" Although the suspected Orlando shooter, Omar Mateen, was an American citizen, Trump suggested immigrants from the Middle East can come to the U.S. and radicalize people who are already here, or work to convince them online. \\"The media talks about homegrown terrorism,\\" Trump said. \\"But Islamic radicalism ... and the networks that nurture it are imports from overseas whether you like it or don't like it.\\" Refugees and immigrants from conflict ridden Middle Eastern countries like Syria, Iraq and Libya could \\"be a better, bigger more horrible version than the legendary Trojan horse ever was,\\" Trump said. But a recent Brookings Institution survey found Americans are far more welcoming of refugees than the billionaire candidate. Of those surveyed, 59 percent support accepting refugees, while 41 percent oppose it. Those views are split right down party lines, with just 38 percent of Republicans supporting taking in refugees from Syria and the Middle East, compared to 77 percent of Democrats. But among Trump supporters, an overwhelming 77 percent said they oppose taking in refugees.

Pick from: (i) no; (ii) yes; Would the answer to these two questions be the same?","output":"The answer to these two questions would not be the same because they are fundamentally different inquiries. The first question asks for an explanation as to why the public perception of Mexican drug cartels and ISIS might differ, while the second question asks for an analysis of the dangerousness of Mexican drug cartels themselves. To provide a detailed response to both of these questions: Question 1: Why aren't the Mexican drug cartels seen as dangerous as ISIS? The public perception of danger when it comes to organizations such as the Mexican drug cartels and ISIS is influenced by numerous factors. While both groups pose significant threats and engage in dangerous and violent activities, several factors may contribute to the different perceptions of their respective dangers. 1. Media coverage: ISIS tends to receive more global media attention due to their large-scale terrorist attacks aimed at civilian populations and their ideological nature. The rise of ISIS has been associated with significant territory gains, gruesome beheadings, and high-profile attacks in Western countries. In contrast, Mexican drug cartels primarily operate within Mexico and occasionally spill over into the United States, which limits their global impact on people's perceptions. 2. Ideology: The motives and goals of ISIS and Mexican drug cartels are very different. ISIS operates on a radical Islamic ideology, aimed at establishing a global caliphate and enforcing a strict interpretation of Sharia law. This ideological basis is seen as a direct threat to Western values, civil liberties, and national security. In contrast, Mexican drug cartels are focused on the drug trade, with goals centered on profit and territory control. While their activities are undoubtedly violent and harmful, they do not inherently pose a direct ideological threat to the West or other countries. 3. Geopolitical implications: ISIS emerged as a key player in the Syrian civil war, and their activities have had significant geopolitical ramifications in the Middle East. In contrast, Mexican drug cartels, although potentially destabilizing for the Mexican state and border regions, do not have the same widespread geopolitical implications for global peace and security. Question 2: How dangerous are Mexican drug cartels? Mexican drug cartels are highly dangerous due to the following factors: 1. Violence: Mexican drug cartels are often engaged in violent competition for control over lucrative drug trafficking routes, leading to frequent instances of armed conflict, kidnappings, and homicides. Thousands of people die every year in Mexico as a result of drug-related violence, and cartels are known to target civilians, public officials, journalists, and law enforcement personnel. 2. Corruption: Mexican drug cartels exert substaсmd c'\\u000e&8aq\\u0007\\u0000\\u0014\\u0000tal influence over local, state, and even federal authorities through corruption and intimidation. This often leads to a lack of effective governance, weakened law enforcement, and a fraying of social fabric. The effect of this is felt not only in Mexico but also in the broader region and has implications for the stability of affected areas. 3. Drug trafficking: As the primary operators of drug trafficking activities in the region, Mexican drug cartels facilitate widespread addiction, drug abuse, and drug-related crime in both Mexico and the United States. This has societal consequences, including harm to public health and the economic burden of drug addiction treatment and crime prevention. 4. Human trafficking and human rights abuses: In addition to drug trafficking, some cartels are involved in human trafficking and engage in other human rights abuses. Forced labor, sexual exploitation, and forced recruitment into criminal activities are some of the ways cartels victimize populations. While Mexican drug cartels might not be perceived as dangerous as ISIS, they pose a significant threat to public safety, governance, and human rights within the regions they operate."},{"instruction":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

When the interaction turned physical, Jackson flung the man to the ground before learning he was Lieutenant David Ramras. Article:","output":"Title: Miami Police Officer Arrests Speeding Lieutenant in Tense Encounter Caught on GoPro Introduction A Miami police officer, Marcel Jackson, pulled over a speeder in what seemed like a routine traffic stop. However, the situation took an unexpected and tense turn as Jackson's personal GoPro camera captured the events unfolding. The dramatic video shows the officer approach the car, only to have the driver's door suddenly open and the driver step out, leading to a physical altercation between the two men. The situation became even more complicated when Jackson discovered that the man he had arrested was, in fact, Lieutenant David Ramras, a fellow officer. Body 1. Jackson pulls over a speeder Officer Marcel Jackson was patrolling the streets of Miami when he clocked a car going significantly over the speed limit. Following the standard procedure, he initiated a traffic stop, pulling the speeding vehicle over to the side of the road. Unaware of the driver's identity, Jackson approached the vehicle with his GoPro camera recording the event. 2. Tense moments as the driver steps out As Officer Jackson approached the car, the driver's door suddenly flung open. The man, later identified as Lieutenant David Ramras, stepped out and appeared to argue with Jackson. In a clear violation of standard traffic stop protocol, Ramras engaged in a heated debate with Jackson, who asked him to stay inside the car. 3. Physical altercation ensues The interaction between Officer Jackson and Lieutenant Ramras quickly turned physical. In an attempt to defuse the situation and restrain the aggressive driver, Jackson flung Ramras to the ground. Unbeknownst to Jackson at that time, the man he was grappling with was a fellow law enforcement officer. 4. The shocking revelation As the situation unfolded, it became clear to Officer Jackson that the man he had just arrested was none other than Lieutenant David Ramras. Once this was revealed, the incident took on a new level of complexity, as it became not just a matter of enforcing the law, but also managing the dynamics between the two officers. Conclusion The unusual encounter between Officer Marcel Jackson and Lieutenant David Ramras in Miami serves as a reminder that tensions can arise even among those who work to uphold the law. The video captured by Jackson's GoPro camera provides a unique look into how the situation escalated, ultimately leading to the arrest of a high-ranking officer. It remains to be seen what consequences will arise from this incident and whether it will impact the relationships among law enforcement officers in the Miami area."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

They did everything together, like playing games, going to school, and having sleepovers. They were just like two peas in a pod. One day, they both started having feelings for other people, and that's when things got interesting. Joseph, you see, had a heart full of love. Falling in love was as easy as eating a yummy bowl of ice cream for him. Whenever he met someone new and lovely, Joseph's eyes would sparkle like stars in the night sky, and his heart would flutter like butterflies in his tummy. Now, Samuel was different. Falling in love was very hard for him, like trying to ride a bike without training wheels for the first time. He was unsure about his feelings and his heart didn't race like Joseph's did. Samuel often felt like a shy turtle, hiding in its shell whenever someone he liked came near. One beautiful day, while Joseph and Samuel were playing in the park, they saw a girl named Lily. Lily was very kind and had the most beautiful smile. Joseph's heart immediately began to dance, and he knew right away that he had fallen in love with Lily. Samuel thought Lily was very nice, but his heart was still hiding inside its shell. He didn't know if he was in love with her or not. Everyday, the three friends would play together at the park and slowly, Samuel's heart started to peek out from its hiding place. But, it was still really tough for him to understand what he was feeling. Joseph wanted to help his best friend, so he shared his secret for falling in love so easily. He told Samuel to remember the good times they had with Lily, and to think about how happy she made him. This would help him know if he loved her or not. So Samuel followed Joseph's advice. He closed his eyes and thought about the sunny days they spent together, the laughter they shared, and how Lily always made him feel warm and fuzzy inside. Gradually, Samuel's heart opened up like a beautiful flower, and he realized he had fallen in love with Lily, too. In the end, Samuel learned that love can sometimes be difficult to understand, but with the help of his best friend Joseph, he found the love he was looking for. And so, Joseph, Samuel, and Lily continued spending their days together, playing and sharing adventures, with their love growing stronger day by day. Their hearts felt full and happy, like a big, squishy pillow.

Melissa Clark adds a new twist with a recipe for Sephardic haroseth truffles. OTHER THAN HAROSETH and Caribbean black cake, there are not a lot of recipes calling for Manischewitz Concord grape wine. I know this because I’ve had the same bottle for what might be decades. I unearth the dusty thing during Passover to anoint my haroseth, then return the bottle to the depths of the liquor cabinet. It’s been a challenge to use up. This year, though, I decided to make more of an effort. Manischewitz does after all have a deep, musky grape flavor, almost portlike in its intensity, but sweeter and more syrupy. It actually tastes like a fresh Concord grape, which if you’ve never had one is a lot like grape soda and nothing like the red or green grapes you can buy at the supermarket. I knew the jamminess of the wine could be an asset in many recipes once I pried it loose from Passover. Because the flavor of Concord grape works so well in an Ashkenazi haroseth, a loose paste of chopped walnuts, apples and cinnamon, I made that my starting point, integrating those elements into a crisp, fresh salad. To play up the sweetness of the wine, I used it to candy walnuts with brown sugar and cinnamon. The nuts were easy to throw together and terrific to snack on all by themselves. You could cut the recipe in half, but I wouldn’t. Leftover nuts will keep for weeks if you can manage not to devour them in three days. For the salad, instead of chopping or grating the apples as for haroseth, I sliced them up, immediately mixing them in a shallot vinaigrette. The acid from the vinegar kept them from turning brown. Then I tossed them with arugula and endive, and arranged the crisp, sugary nuts on top. The salad would work nicely as the first course of a Seder, especially if I made a Sephardic haroseth (with dried fruit and pistachios) for the Seder plate. But the haroseth inspiration is subtle, so much so that no one would make the Passover connection. I’d make my guests guess the secret ingredient, and if they got it right, they could take home my bottle of Manischewitz — along with a recipe for the candied nuts. What are the most important parts of this news article?","output":"The most important parts of this news article are: 1. The introduction of a new twist on traditional Passover dish, haroseth, in the form of Sephardic haroseth truffles created by Melissa Clark. 2. The utilization of Manischewitz Concord grape wine, which has a rich, grape flavor and is typically used in the preparation of haroseth during Passover. 3. The integration of elements from Ashkenazi haroseth (walnuts, apples, and cinnamon) into a crisp, fresh salad featuring candied walnuts prepared with the Manischewitz wine. 4. The use of arugula, endive, and shallot vinaigrette in the salad, topped with sugary nuts, making it a potential first course for a Seder dinner. 5. The subtle haroseth inspiration in the salad that will provoke guests to guess the secret ingredient, allowing them to win a bottle of Manischewitz and the recipe for candied nuts if guessed correctly."},{"instruction":"Here's a question and a few possible answers:   Q: Sarah expected to a fortune on her new business.

Back then -- I can vouch for this -- young men fervently believed it, and it brought them to J. C. Penney's. The store, which was founded in 1902, has a deep-rooted history in the retail industry, with James Cash Penney's vision of creating a company with the golden rule at its core. A simple principle that could have easily resonated with the charismatic James Dean, who himself embodied the essence of cool during his brief life. J. C. Penney's, over the years, has been a go-to store for Americans to find quality merchandise at reasonable prices. However, the era of internet retail and fast fashion has left the once-thriving chain in dire straits. With consistently falling sales and relentless competition in an ever-changing market, it has become evident that J. C. Penney's is in desperate need of a revival. By looking to the iconic James Dean, J. C. Penney's may find the inspiration it needs to regain the recognition and popularity it has lost. The plain white T-shirt, a symbol of effortless style, epitomizes the essence of youth and the desire for simplicity in a fast-paced world. This image, associated with James Dean, could be the key to J. C. Penney's turnaround. The brand should strive to emulate the qualities of James Dean – simple, timeless, and effortlessly stylish. J. C. Penney's can start by focusing on revamping its in-house brands, offering trendy pieces at affordable prices, effectively competing with retailers that dominate the fashion industry today. By honing in on the revered characteristics attached to James Dean, J. C. Penney's can target a younger, more dynamic demographic that will ultimately revive sales and increase customer loyalty. Additionally, J. C. Penney's can embrace collaborations with well-known designers, celebrities, and influencers, bringing a fresh and updated aesthetic to their product offerings. By showcasing their products through the lens of popular culture, J. C. Penney's has the opportunity to reestablish itself as a relevant and desired shopping destination for customers from all walks of life. Furthermore, the company should invest in improving its online presence, optimizing its website for a smooth and enjoyable user experience. By incorporating an engaging online platform with exclusive offers, J. C. Penney's can strengthen its connection with consumers while expanding its reach to new clientele. In conclusion, J. C. Penney's resurrection could be achieved by taking inspiration from the iconic figure of James Dean. By revamping its brand image and offerings to reflect the simplicity and timelessness that James Dean encapsulates, J. C. Penney's can rediscover its place in the ever-evolving retail landscape and recapture the hearts of customers who once considered it their go-to shopping destination."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

The collector spent millions on the painting and was happy, but regretted getting the statue, because the  Select from: A. statue was legitimate. B. painting was legitimate.","output":"The collector spent millions on the painting and was happy, but regretted getting the statue, because the B. painting was legitimate. Step 1: Understand the user's intent - The user wants me to complete the sentence by selecting the appropriate option (A or B), which describes the reason for the collector's regret. Step 2: Evaluate the options - Option A suggests that the collector might regret the purchase of the statue because it was legitimate, but this does not make sense, as people would generally be happy with a legitimate purchase. Option B suggests that the collector is happy with the painting purchase (as stated in the sentence), and the regret must be connected with the statue. Step 3: Choose the best fit - Considering that the collector is happy with the painting purchase, and the question asks about the regret related to the statue, Option B provides the best fit for this sentence since it does not invalidate the happiness brought from the painting, and it indirectly implies that there must be a problem with the statue. The sentence now implies that the collector's regret comes from the fact that they spent money on a statue when they should have focused on the legitimate, and valuable, painting."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

The hypothesis states, \\"some men hold items,\\" and in the given premise, we can observe that there are at least two men who are holding various items. Let's break down the premise further to analyze the specific details: 1. A man with a determined look on his face holds a small wooden hammer: This statement shows that there is one man who is holding a small wooden hammer. This already confirms that some men hold items, as there is at least one man doing so in this scenario. 2. Wearing a bib displaying a large red crab, another red crustacean held in his hand: The same man is now also mentioned to be holding a red crustacean in his hand. This demonstrates that besides the wooden hammer, the man is holding another item, further strengthening the hypothesis. 3. While another man sits and holds some food behind him: This statement introduces a second man who is holding food behind him. This not only shows that the first man is not the only one holding items but also confirms that \\"some men hold items\\" by presenting two separate individuals who are doing so.

I have a new situation: John is studying the different states of matter. Today, he has a matter in three states in front of him, state A, state B, and state C. State A is in solid state. State B is in liquid state. And, state C is in gaseous state. He needs to determine the properties of each state.  But I can use this background: As Figure above shows, the distance between particles is much smaller for the solid and liquid states than for the gas state. In the solid state, particles are fixed in place, while particles are more free to move in the liquid and gas states. The particles in the solid and liquid states “stick together,” but in the gas state, they move freely about the container. In general, it requires energy to separate individual particles. If we want to make a solid adopt a liquid form, we can add energy in the form of heat, increasing the temperature of the substance. Conversely, if we want to convert a substance from a gas to a liquid or from a liquid to a solid, we remove energy from the system and decrease the temperature. Pressure also plays an important role in changes of state, which will be discussed later on. We will study these difference in greater detail in the chapter States of Matter.  What is an answer for this question: Would state B's particles be more free or less free than state A's? A:","output":"State B's particles would be more free than state A's particles. Since state A is in the solid state and state B is in the liquid state, the particles in state B have more freedom to move compared to the fixed particles in state A. In the solid state, particles are closely held together and have a fixed position, while in the liquid state, particles are still close together but can move more freely."},{"instruction":"User will you give you a task with some instruction.

Article:","output":"Title: Fearless Pigeon's Narrow Escape from Lion's Jaws at Adelaide Zoo In a heart-stopping incident at Adelaide Zoo in Australia, a brave pigeon caught the attention of onlookers as it dared to fly straight toward the enclosure of a ferocious big cat. Experts maintain that wild instincts continue to dictate animal behavior, even in captive environments, and this incident only serves to highlight the raw power of nature at work. The courageous pigeon, unfazed by the dangerous predator, flew directly into the lion's domain, possibly hoping to snag a few morsels of food or merely demonstrating its audacity. The move left onlookers gasping in shock as the lion, armed with lethal claws and razor-sharp teeth, wasted no time in lunging toward its potential prey. Observers couldn't help but marvel at the agility and fearlessness of the pigeon as it navigated its way around the cage, expertly avoiding the killer paws of the mighty lion. The room, charged with anticipation, heaved a collective sigh of relief upon witnessing the bird's narrow escape from a gruesome end. Just when it seemed that the pigeon's long day was over, the winged daredevil took one last bold approach toward freedom, displaying a true demonstration of the animal kingdom's fight for survival. Against all odds, the bird managed to emerge unscathed from the lion's attacks and fly away to see another day, much to the relief and amazement of the witnesses present. This incident serves as a reminder of the untamed instincts that remain prevalent among animals, even in captive environments such as zoos.

Summarize the following: Fatigue is the most common symptom. Paleness of the face and skin and difficult of breathing with mild exertion may accompany fatigue. These symptoms indicate that the red blood cells do not carry sufficient amounts of oxygen to the rest of the body. The lungs, other vital organs, and muscles compensate for less oxygen by working more diligently. This is a very taxing process to sustain and causes general feeling of fatigue. Fever actually protects the body from harmful processes within. The constant fighting of the body against leukemia cells trigger persistent fever. The bone marrow is the soft tissue core inside the bone. Bone pain is a result of the saturation of bone marrows with leukemia cells. Easy bruising , frequent bleeding of gums and nose, pinpoint red spots in the skin. These are symptoms of low amounts of normal platelet in the body. Soft, small lumps may be found in any part of the body. The lumps are by-products of leukemic cells seeping under the affected area. The spleen is the graveyard for dead blood cells. Leukemia increase the death rate of blood cells and congest the spleen. Consequently, the spleen becomes enlarged. The close proximity of the spleen to the stomach plays a role in loss of appetite. The enlarged spleen presses on the stomach to mimic a feeling of fullness. This explains the loss of appetite. One inflammatory cell is named tumor necrosis factor (cachectin). Cachectin is responsible for weight loss. Fever is a response of the body against harmful leukemia cells. Chronic fever alters the ability of the brain to regulate body temperature. The brain’s faulty regulatory process perceives the normal body temperature to be too hot and uses night sweating as a means of releasing heat. The lumps signify swelling of the lymph glands. The lymph glands are the policemen of the body. They detain unwanted bacteria, virus, and foreign substance such as cancer cells and prime them for removal. In this case, lymph glands trap leukemia cells and try to eliminate them. The spleen becomes too stretched and enlarged that pain is produced. This is often complained in the left side of the abdomen where the spleen is usually located.","output":"Fatigue, paleness, and difficulty breathing are common symptoms of leukemia, indicating insufficient oxygen supply to the body.

Answer the following question: A mycorrhiza (Greek for \\"fungus roots\\") is a symbiotic association between a fungus and the roots of a plant. In a mycorrhizal association, the fungus may colonize the roots of a host plant by either growing directly into the root cells, or by growing around the root cells. This association provides the fungus with relatively constant and direct access to glucose, which the plant produces by photosynthesis. The mycelia of the fungi increase the surface area of the plant’s root system. The larger surface area improves water and mineral nutrient absorption from the soil.  Two friends studied permaculture together. Bill studied about mycorrhiza, while Red studied about hugel kultur.  Which friend learned less about surface areas of root systems? Answer:","output":"Red learned less about surface areas of root systems. Step 1: Identify the key points from the given information. - Mycorrhiza is a symbiotic association between a fungus and the roots of a plant. - Mycelia of the fungi increase the surface area of the plant's root system. - Bill studied mycorrhiza. - Red studied hugelkultur. Step 2: Determine the relevance of the information. - The information about mycorrhiza is directly related to the surface area of root systems. - Hugelkultur is a gardening technique that involves creating raised beds by burying wood and other organic materials, which decompose and improve soil fertility, structure, and water retention. It does not directly address the surface area of root systems. Step 3: Compare the information relevant to the root systems. - Bill's study of mycorrhiza directly involves the surface area of root systems. - Red's study of hugelkultur doesn't directly involve the surface area of root systems. Step 4: Conclusion. Based on the comparison, Red, who studied hugelkultur, learned less about surface areas of root systems than Bill, who studied mycorrhiza."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

A:","output":"Step 1: Understand the context Henry is writing a research paper on abiotic stress in two different forests. The Narshe Forest with low stress levels and the Midgar forest with high stress levels. Step 2: Determine the main factors influencing the animal population Abiotic stress refers to the negative impact of non-living factors on living organisms, which can include factors such as temperature, water, and salinity. In general, higher abiotic stress levels can lead to a more challenging environment for organisms, negatively affecting their growth, reproduction, and survival. Step 3: Apply knowledge to compare the two forests We know that the Narshe Forest has low levels of abiotic stress, while the Midgar forest has high levels of abiotic stress. Step 4: Draw a conclusion based on the comparison The animal population in the Midgar forest will likely be lower than in the Narshe Forest due to the higher levels of abiotic stress. This is because higher levels of abiotic stress can result in a more challenging environment for organisms to survive, reproduce, and thrive."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant that follows instruction extremely well.

Cette confiance croissante envers le Tribunal découle d'une série de facteurs, parmi lesquels on peut citer l'évolution de la jurisprudence, la transparence dans les procédures et les décisions, ainsi que la spécialisation des juges et des avocats impliqués dans les affaires traitées par le Tribunal. De plus, l'établissement d'une communication efficace entre les parties concernées et les institutions responsables de l'application des décisions du Tribunal contribue également à renforcer la confiance envers le Tribunal. La diversité des cas soumis au Tribunal illustre également la capacité de celui-ci à traiter un large éventail de problèmes et de conflits, qui peuvent toucher différents domaines du droit, comme le droit pénal, le droit civil, le droit administratif, le droit constitutionnel, le droit international ou encore le droit commercial.

Choose a nice, flat and clear surface: When at the beach, look for a flat and clean area, preferably without any nearby sand dunes or debris, to place your beach bag. This reduces the chance of sand getting blown or kicked into your bag. 2. Shake off your belongings: Before putting any items into your beach bag (such as towels, shoes, or clothes), make sure to shake them off vigorously to remove any sand that may be clinging to them. 3. Use a large towel or mat: Place a large towel or beach mat on the ground and put your beach bag on top of it. This extra layer will help prevent sand from getting directly in contact with your bag. 4. Keep your bag zipped or closed: Always keep your beach bag closed, either by zipping it up, buckling it, or using a drawstring. This helps prevent airborne sand from getting into the bag. 5. Use smaller ziplock bags: For smaller items such as sunscreen, sunglasses, and keys, consider putting them in individual ziplock bags before placing them in your beach bag. This adds an extra layer of protection against sand. 6. Clean your hands: Before reaching into your beach bag, clean and wipe off your hands to remove any sand that may be on them. This helps prevent transferring sand from your hands to the inside of your bag. 7. Keep your bag off the sand: If possible, use a beach chair, table, or any other elevated surface to keep your beach bag off the ground.

One of the challenges that every community faces, particularly teams inside a larger community, is the ability to coordinate what goals and ambitions the team is going to work on. Traditionally this has always been somewhat ad-hoc: people join a team and work on whatever they feel like. Ideas are ten-a-penny though. For most teams that work on larger projects (such as events, software, products and more) to actually be productive, coordinating this work can be complex: some projects require coordination across many people with different skill-sets, time-availability and resources. Something I would like us to work towards in the Ubuntu community is encouraging a culture of best-practise in how we plan our work and coordinate our awesome teams to work together on projects. I believe this kind of coordination can help our teams increase the opportunity for success in their work, feel more empowered and productive and provide greater insight to people outside those teams on what the team is doing. An effective way of doing this is to build a Roadmap for each cycle. This provides an opportunity to capture a set of goals the team will work together to achieve in each six-month period. This article outlines how to build such a Roadmap. While at first a roadmap can feel a little like a nod to the gods of bureaucracy, they actually possess many benefits: * Direction – one of the biggest complaints teams often report is a lack of direction. If a team gets into the habit of creating a roadmap at the beginning of a cycle, it gives the team a sense of focus and direction for the coming cycle. * Documented commitments are more effective – a common rule in Project Management training is that actions assigned to people in a shared document are more effective than ad-hoc or private commitments. By documenting who will work on what in a cycle and putting their name next to an action can help seal a sense of accountability for their contributions to the project. * Feeling of success – regularly revisiting a roadmap and...

Rushing here and there, being constantly on call, balancing multiple layers of responsibility may give you a sense of accomplishment – even make you feel important, but it takes a huge toll on every aspect of life. When you constantly push yourself to take on more and more challenges, it is easy to lose sight of why you wanted to be successful in the first place. For many, the reason was to be able to spend less time working and enjoy life more.  A frenetic, high-pressure lifestyle creates exactly the opposite. There is a very dark side to constantly pushing yourself to produce more and more. Unfortunately, it creeps up on you and becomes a serious case of self-negligence. When you are busy and driven every minute of every day and well into the evening, it is easy to neglect important things in life that keep you healthy, happy, and create quality of life.  A continual stream of urgent tasks that must be completed will overshadow the not-so-urgent, but important activities that make life worth living. It is not just physical well-being that is neglected – mental and emotional well-being also suffer when there is no time for self-care. When your daily schedule is crammed to overflowing one of the first areas of neglect is your diet. Eating regular, nutritious meals become a thing of the past. You are not only too busy to sleep or even take a deep breath now and then, there is no time to prepare decent meals Convenience foods, frozen dinners, take out and fast foods become the norm. It is a steady diet of additive filled, sugar and fat-filled dishes, loaded with empty calories that provide minimal nutrition and damage the body. It is impossible to sustain any level of good health on such a diet. According to the above context, choose the correct option to answer the following question. Question: What does the normal diet become?

Patient A had hyperopia, but patient B didn't have any issues with eyes. John would now treat the patient that have eye problem.  and a hint : Farsightedness, or hyperopia, is the condition in which distant objects are seen clearly, but nearby objects appear blurry. It occurs when the eyeball is shorter than normal (see Figure below ). This causes images to be focused in a spot that would fall behind the retina (if light could pass through the retina).

Could you please translate this to English?","output":"(Mr. President, we are about to move on to the ban on the use of cyanide-based mining technologies, because - as colleagues have said earlier - these have caused and continue to cause severe environmental effects and pose serious dangers to the health of people and animals.) Mr. President, we are in the process of transitioning to a ban on the use of cyanide-based mining technologies because, as previous colleagues have mentioned, they have caused and continue to cause severe environmental impacts. These impacts are not just confined to the environment, but also pose significant threats to the health of both people and animals. Cyanide-based mining technologies have long been a controversial subject due to their detrimental effects on the environment. These technologies use cyanide, a highly toxic chemical, to extract precious metals, such as gold and silver, from ore. While they may be effective for mining operations, the consequences of using these methods are not ideal. One of the biggest concerns surrounding cyanide-based mining is the environmental impact it has. Cyanide can leach into soil, water, and air, causing widespread contamination. This contamination can harm ecosystems and reduce biodiversity, as well as affect water sources for both humans and wildlife. Cyanide has been known to cause large-scale damage to ecosystems and is difficult to clean up once a spill or leakage has occurred. In addition to the environmental concerns, cyanide-based mining technologies also present significant risks to human and animal health. Exposure to cyanide can lead to serious health problems, including respiratory issues, heart problems, and even death. Prolonged exposure to low concentrations of cyanide can also lead to chronic health issues. The risks to animal health are similar, with cyanide exposure having the potential to cause significant harm or even death. In light of these issues, it is evident that a transition to a ban on cyanide-based mining technologies is necessary not only for environmental reasons, but for the health and safety of both people and animals. It is crucial that this transition is well-planned and carried out efficiently to ensure the least amount of disruption to the mining industries. In doing so, alternative and more sustainable technologies must be explored and implemented to replace cyanide-based mining methods. These alternatives could include methods such as more efficient gravity-based techniques and the use of non-toxic chemicals. Additionally, robust environmental regulations and strict monitoring of mining operations would ensure that any potential harm to the environment and public health is minimized. In conclusion, the move towards a ban on cyanide-based mining technologies is a necessary and important step towards preserving our environment and ensuring the safety and well-being of people and animals. By pursuing and implementing alternative techniques and enforcing strict regulations, we can work towards promoting responsible and sustainable mining practices that benefit both the industry and the world around us."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Furthermore, GATE qualified candidates are preferred for recruitment in several public sector units (PSUs) and government organizations like DRDO, BHEL, etc. If a student's CGPA is in the range of 6.5 to 7, it is recommended they work harder to improve their understanding of concepts and enhance their problem-solving skills. These aspects are crucial for achieving a high score on the GATE exam. Option 2: Campus Placements If a student's primary objective is to start their professional career immediately after completing their B.Tech degree, they may choose to focus on campus placements. These opportunities allow students to secure jobs in well-reputed private companies or startups, which can help them earn industry experience and establish their careers. Campus placements may be more suitable for students looking for a faster transition into the professional world. The Best Way to Prepare for GATE for a CS/IT student: 1. Familiarize yourself with the syllabus: Understand the GATE exam pattern, its marking scheme, and the syllabus to plan your study schedule accordingly. 2. Develop a study schedule: Design a study plan and divide your time equally for learning concepts, practicing problems, and revising previously studied topics. 3. Quality study material: Use standard study material from reliable sources such as reference books, lecture notes, and video lectures from well-known professors. Some popular authors for CS/IT GATE preparation are Cormen, Aho, Ullman, and Patterson. 4. Strengthen your fundamentals: Focus on building a strong foundation of your understanding of computer science subjects like algorithms, data structures, operating systems, databases, and computer networks.  5. Practice problem-solving: Regularly solve problems from previous years' GATE question papers and online practice tests. Analyze your progress to understand your strengths, weaknesses, and the areas needing improvement. 6. Mock tests: Attempt mock tests under exam conditions to get used to the exam pattern and to understand how to manage your time efficiently during the exam. 7. Join GATE coaching or online forums: GATE coaching institutes and online forums can help you clarify your doubts, learn exam strategies, and discuss problems with other like-minded aspirants. 8. Stay consistent: Maintain a disciplined approach to your GATE preparation over an adequate period (usually 6-12 months). Consistent efforts will help improve your understanding and problem-solving abilities. Ultimately, the decision between preparing for GATE or focusing on campus placements depends on the individual's career goals and aspirations. A careful assessment of their strengths, preferences, and future goals can help them choose the path that best aligns with their personal and professional objectives."},{"instruction":"The rich young people who had just graduated suffered from boredom, being without responsibility they decided to do what before starting jobs?

The most logical next event, based on the given sequence, is for her to gently wear the colored lens in her right eye first and then in her left eye. This choice aligns with the preceding steps in the narrative, where she has already opened the glass bottle containing the colored lenses and has a lens on her finger. In this case, she would likely follow strict hygiene guidelines to ensure a safe application of the contact lenses. She might have already ensured that her hands are clean by washing them thoroughly with soap and water and drying them with a clean towel before handling the lenses to minimize any risk of infection and irritation. As she places the lens on her right eye, she would pull down the lower eyelid with her free hand and gently look up, using her other hand to place the lens directly on her eye. Once the lens is in place and comfortable, she would perform the same steps to apply the lens in her left eye. She might blink a few times to make sure both lenses are fitting correctly and feel comfortable in her eyes. Once she successfully wears both colored lenses, she might proceed to check her reflection to confirm the lenses are properly positioned and delivering the desired level of color enhancement. She may also examine her eyes to ensure that there is no irritation, redness, or discomfort. After properly wearing the lenses in both eyes, she can continue with her regular make-up routine or go about her day wearing the colored lenses. The lenses can not only change her eye color but may also serve as an accessory to enhance her overall appearance or complement her outfit.

Parents and children from around the neighbourhood have brought in their broken things to be fixed by menders, each with their own area of expertise. At different tables, repairers fix jewellery, electronics and furniture among many other things. This is also an opportunity to teach kids repair skills, and a group of boys is hammering away in the corner. In the midst of this hive of noisy tinkering stands Sandra Goldmark. \\"People hold on to their broken things for a long time,\\" she says. \\"When we started, we found this huge pent-up demand for our services, because there was nowhere to get things repaired.\\" Ms Goldmark, who is a set designer and theatre professor, created Pop Up Repair three years ago with her husband, who is also in theatre production. Initially launched with a crowdfunding campaign and a team of handy backstage theatre professionals, Pop Up Repair fixes a range of items - toys, glasses, furniture and clothing. Repairs start at 15. In addition to the practical repairs, Ms Goldmark also wanted Pop Up Repair to fuel a broader conversation about consumption and waste in modern living. \\"The system leads you to throw things away and buy new, but we've found that people have an internal resistance to this,\\" she says. The idea of mending things, as opposed to replacing them, is one that is gaining traction in the US. It fits into a broader zeitgeist about living a more sustainable lifestyle - Ms Goldmark goes so far as to call it a movement, albeit one that's still in its infancy. \\"I liken it to the food movement from 30 years ago,\\" she says. \\"People are beginning to realise that the overabundance of cheap 'stuff calories', if you like, doesn't make us happier or our homes healthier.\\" But while there is a heightened interest in mending, there are entrenched obstacles to the revival of repair as an industry. In California, Jamie Facciola created her business, Repair Revolution, with the specific mission of reducing those obstacles. Ms Facciola is a repair evangelist, driven primarily by environmental concerns. \\"People care about local businesses, and the artfulness of things, but they don't recognise repair in this way,\\" she says. \\"I'm reframing repair with these values - artisanal, skilled and using local talents.\\" For Ms Facciola, repair is linked to larger trends like the \\"maker movement\\" and the \\"circular economy\\", all of which resonate particularly with the younger generation of millennials. Repair Revolution also holds pop-up events in Oakland, California, which Ms Facciola says have been successful, connecting people with a network of repairers who might otherwise be hard to find. There are also far fewer menders than there used to be, and Ms Facciola says \\"they're usually run by an older generation who are not on Twitter, and don't have webpages, which is how this younger generation goes about finding services\\". So awareness is a priority for repair businesses. In New York City, Denim Therapy is a small business that has provided a very niche service for 10 years, but does have an online and social media presence. \\"It's been a process of education to get people to understand that jeans are repairable,\\" says owner Francine Rabinovich. \\"And they've been very open to this message.\\" Ms Rabinovich has seen increased sales - over the last two years, she says Denim Therapy has gone from fixing about 700 pairs of jeans every month to a 1,000 pairs. She now outsources some work to a nearby tailor to keep up with the business. \\"Sometimes the repair will cost more than the price of the jeans, and still people want to do it, because they're attached to them,\\" she says. Larger companies are also getting in on this trend - outdoor clothing store Patagonia will soon kick off the \\"Worn Wear\\" tour, where clothing repair experts will tour cities from San Francisco to Boston, fixing Patagonia's coats and outdoor clothing. For Patagonia's founder Yvon Chouinard, this is part of a larger stance against over-consumption. Back in California, Repair Revolution's Ms Facciola says that \\"we have convinced ourselves we don't need to repair things because we can always buy new, but our future won't sustain that.\\" She hopes the same market-based system that created our throw-away culture will help by ushering in a major resurgence in repair, and encourage repair businesses to thrive. \\"In a market economy, we vote with our dollars, and there's proven demand for repair services. \\"If we can send that market signal that we care about the repairability of things, that's a strong signal that can fill these gaps in the market.\\" Summarize the main points of that article.","output":"The article discusses the growing trend of repairing items instead of replacing them, as people become more conscious of sustainable living and combating over-consumption. Pop-up repair events, such as those organized by Pop Up Repair and Repair Revolution, are gaining traction in the US, teaching individuals, including children, how to fix various items. These events not only provide a valuable service, but also encourage discussions on consumption and waste in modern living. The founder of Pop Up Repair, Sandra Goldmark, compares this shift in mentality towards repairing items to the food movement from 30 years ago, as another example of people seeking out a more sustainable lifestyle. There are challenges to the revival of the repair industry, such as an aging workforce of repairers, who may not be as adept at reaching the younger generation through online platforms. However, businesses like Denim Therapy are leveraging social media to create awareness about their niche repair services and have seen increased sales as a result. Additionally, larger companies like Patagonia have taken notice of the trend and are incorporating repair services through initiatives like their \\"Worn Wear\\" tour, where clothing repair experts travel to various cities to fix Patagonia's apparel. This growing focus on repairing items may help repair businesses thrive in a market economy that currently relies heavily on buying new products."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Here is a question about this article: According to the endurance running hypothesis, long-distance running as in persistence hunting, a method still practiced by some hunter-gatherer groups in modern times, was likely the driving evolutionary force leading to the evolution of certain human characteristics. This hypothesis does not necessarily contradict the scavenging hypothesis: both subsistence strategies could have been in use – sequentially, alternating or even simultaneously. What is the answer to this question: Besides the endurance running hypothesis, what other theory of food collection is there?","output":"The other theory of food collection mentioned in the presented text is the scavenging hypothesis. While the endurance running hypothesis suggests that long-distance running, particularly in the context of persistence hunting, was a key driving force in human evolution, the scavenging hypothesis offers a different perspective on how early humans may have obtained their food. The scavenging hypothesis posits that early hominids were not primarily hunters but scavengers who would find and gather leftovers from kills made by true predators. This theory has been proposed to explain certain unique human characteristics, notably our capacity for long-term endurance activities, our bipedalism, and our predisposition for social cooperation, and complex planning. According to this hypothesis, early humans would scavenge carcasses left by other predators, extracting nutrition from bones, bone marrow, and leftovers from the kill. This scavenging approach would involve less risk than active hunting and require a wider range of skills, such as the abilities to track other predators, understand their behavior, and competently handle and process food resources. This theory also implies a higher level of diet flexibility in early humans, which later may have allowed for survival in a variety of habitats and nutritional environments. Further, scavenging might have promoted the development of social structure and collective action, as groups of individuals could collaborate to drive off other predators from their kills or to secure and divide larger amounts of food.  The scavenging hypothesis does not necessarily contradict the endurance running hypothesis. Rather, both strategies of food collection could have existed in parallel, alternated, or even been sequentially used depending on different factors such as environmental conditions and availability of food. This combination would have given early humans versatility in their food procurement strategies and possibly added to their survival advantage. Overall, both the endurance running and scavenging hypotheses provide insights into the complex process of evolutionary adaptations that have shaped our species."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Part #3: Method Usage: How did the researchers do the work or find what they sought? What are the procedures and steps of the research? Sample response: Researchers conducted a comparative analysis of solar, wind, and fossil fuel energy sources. They collected data on energy efficiency, greenhouse gas emissions, and costs associated with each source. Procedures included monitoring energy production and consumption across different regions and analyzing potential scenarios for increased renewable energy adoption. Part #4: Finding Usage: What did the researchers find out? Did the proposed methods work? Did the thing behave as the researchers expected? Sample response: The researchers found that solar and wind energy sources have the potential to greatly reduce greenhouse gas emissions when compared to fossil fuel sources. The proposed methods were effective in comparing efficiencies of each energy source and estimating achievable reductions in emissions. The results confirmed the researchers' expectations that renewable energy sources are viable options for mitigating the impacts of climate change."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Translate the following sentence to German: Mr Needle made a very telling point when he said that the House has a rare opportunity.","output":"The sentence 'Mr Needle made a very telling point when he said that the House has a rare opportunity.' can be translated to German as 'Herr Needle machte einen sehr aussagekräftigen Punkt, als er sagte, dass das Haus eine seltene Gelegenheit hat.' Here are my steps of translation: 1. I first translated \\"Mr Needle\\" as \\"Herr Needle\\" as in German 'Mr' is 'Herr'. 2. Then I translated \\"made a very telling point\\" to \\"machte einen sehr aussagekräftigen Punkt\\". The verb 'made' translates to 'machte'. The phrase 'a very telling point' loosely translates to 'einen sehr aussagekräftigen Punkt' where 'sehr' is very, 'aussagekräftigen' is telling and 'Punkt' is point. 3. \\"When he said\\" is translated as \\"als er sagte\\". The English phrase uses past tense, so does the German phrase with 'sagte'. 4. The last part \\"that the House has a rare opportunity\\" is translated as \\"dass das Haus eine seltene Gelegenheit hat\\". 'That' translates to 'dass', 'the House' to 'das Haus', 'has' to 'hat', 'a rare opportunity' to 'eine seltene Gelegenheit'. German syntax can be different from English as verbs often go at the end of the sentence, but in this case, the structure is quite similar. Please note that the sentence still refers to \\"Mr Needle\\" and \\"the House\\" with their English name but those would potentially also be translated or adapted depending on the context."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Guttermouth is an American punk rock band formed in 1988 in Huntington Beach, California and currently recording for Rude Records/Bird Attack Records. They have released nine full-length studio albums and two live albums and have toured extensively, including performances on the Vans Warped Tour. They are infamous for their outrageous lyrics and behavior which are deliberately explicit, offensive and intended to shock, though usually in a humorous and sarcastic manner. This behavior has sometimes resulted in high-profile problems for the band, such as being banned from performing in Canada for eighteen months and leaving the 2004 Warped Tour amidst controversy over their political views and attitudes towards other performers. The following year found the band returning home to California and experiencing a lineup change. Clint Weinrich married in the spring of 1995, and to fill in for him on a European tour the band recruited Steve \\"Stever\\" Rapp, a college friend of Nunn's who was playing in a band called The Grabbers. Things worked out well with Rapp on this tour and he soon became the band's permanent bass player. The new lineup entered the studio and recorded their third album Teri Yakimoto. By all accounts the recording process was plagued with problems, and at one point most of the recordings were scrapped and re-recorded with a new producer. The result was an album that continued the fast and sarcastic Guttermouth tradition but was more melodic and pop-influenced than their previous albums. The band continued to tour and expand their fan base, and filmed a music video for the song \\"Whiskey.\\" With their popularity growing Nitro Records re-released Full Length in CD format with bonus tracks under the title The Album Formerly Known as Full Length LP.  In 1997 the band recorded Musical Monkey, an album which captured their chaotic energy and sharp sense of humor. It is considered by many to be the best representation of their \\"classic\\" sound, and songs such as \\"Lucky the Donkey,\\" \\"Do the Hustle,\\" \\"Lipstick\\" and \\"Perfect World\\" became staples in their live set. The following year they released Live From the Pharmacy, a recording of a live show from 1994 that also included four new songs engineered by Vandals guitarist Warren Fitzgerald and liner notes written by Nunn recounting the band's history. In 1998 Guttermouth was banned from performing in Canada for one year on charges of public indecency after Adkins exposed himself onstage in Saskatoon. According to Adkins: \\"oh, I was guilty [...] What I would do is grab two young girls out of the audience and I would have them hold up this sheet in front of me, and Jamie, the drummer at the time, would say this magical incantation, if you will, and I would be standing there stark naked.\\" Combined with a drunk driving charge from the United States, the incident led Adkins to be arrested on immigration charges, detained for five days, and then deported, though Guttermouth would return to Canada a few years later. After obtaining a full pardon from the Canadian judicial system known as the crown. No record remains on file.  Rapp left the band in 1999, at which point Nunn moved from drums to bass and new drummer William \\"Ty\\" Smith was brought in. That year the band recorded and released Gorgeous, their most aggressive album to date and their final album for Nitro. Did Clint ever return to the band?","output":"Clint Weinrich did not return to Guttermouth after leaving the band in 1995 when he got married. After Weinrich's departure, Steve \\"Stever\\" Rapp joined the band as the new bass player, and later on, lineup changes continued for Guttermouth, including moving Nunn from drums to bass and bringing in new drummer William \\"Ty\\" Smith. Weinrich's departure marked a significant change in the band's lineup and dynamics, and there is no evidence of him rejoining Guttermouth in later iterations of the band."},{"instruction":"You should describe the task and explain your answer.

Article: Every autumn, as families across the United States get ready to send their kids to college, the economics of higher education receive renewed attention. College is expensive and becoming more so in the U. S. The situation raises two questions: Why does it cost so much, and how can students and their families afford it? Several studies published in the past few weeks reflect on these questions. The findings provide comfort to poor families. First, it appears that only the minority actually pay the \\"high price\\". A study by the US Education Department's National Center for Education Statistics found that 55 percent of college students last year received some forms of help--scholarships, loans or jobs. Other factors are also at work. The government has increased the size of its grants  to lower-income students. Grants, unlike loans, don't have to he repaid and are awarded only to college students who have not earned a bachelor's or professional degree. At the same time, most colleges are spending more on undergraduate education than they are collecting in tuition fees. A study, which is part of the Williams College Project on the Economics of Higher Education, reaches the conclusion that on average colleges \\"subsidize  \\" their students. The results of these studies, however, leave unanswered the questions of whether educational costs are higher than they need to be. Some experts argue that much of the college cost results from educational competition for fame, students and facilities. This puts upward pressure on tuition, hut many colleges feel that good fame will enable them to attract students even if they charge them more. Therefore, until something important changes in the marketplace, costs seem likely to continue rising. And American families will continue to beat down the doors of the high price \\"college in the end. Question: The writer of this passage seems to hold the opinion that   _  .

B: poor people should borrow money from banks C: poor people don't need to send their children to college D: colleges should get more money to improve themselves A:","output":"college fees rise too fast for poor families."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Answer the following question: Process:  - Open the Dishwasher - Slide out the bottom rack - Take a dirty plate - Rinse the plate - Place the dish in the rack - Repeat leaving enough space for water to reach all items - Fill the soap cup - Turn on the dishwasher.  Perturbation hypothesis: suppose placing 2 items between every peg happens, how will it affect HELPING the dishwasher to clean better.  Does the supposed perturbation have an effect (direct or indirect) on the process? Answer:","output":"The perturbation hypothesis that you've presented involves placing two items between every peg in the dishwasher, rather than following the typical method of placing a single item per peg. This change in the arrangement of dishes inside the dishwasher could potentially have implications on the cleaning effectiveness of the appliance. Let's analyze the potential effects of this perturbation and whether these altered configurations would have a direct or indirect impact on the cleaning process. Firstly, it is important to understand the mechanisms underlying the dishwasher's cleaning process. A dishwasher functions by spraying water and detergent onto the dishes from various angles, using spray arms that spin and cover a wide surface area with high-pressure water jets. The water then falls back down and circulates within the dishwasher, filtering, reheating, and redistributing it over the dishes in an efficient process. This method relies on adequate spacing between the dishes to allow water and detergent to penetrate every surface effectively. By placing two items between every peg, you are essentially doubling the number of dishes that occupy each section of the dishwasher rack. This configuration could potentially be detrimental to the dishwasher's cleaning effectiveness for several reasons: 1. Reduced water circulation: Having two items in close proximity may obstruct the water flow and reduce the access of detergent and water to all surfaces of the dishes. This can lead to areas of the dishes not being cleaned effectively due to the hindrance of water circulation. 2. Limited water and detergent penetration: If the dishes are too closely packed, water and detergent might not be able to reach every surface adequately. As a result, some areas of the dishes may not receive enough contact with the cleaning solution, preventing the effective removal of food particles and residues. 3. Increased risk of damage: Overcrowding the dishwasher with two items per peg could lead to dishes getting damaged during the cleaning process. This is particularly relevant for delicate or breakable items, as they could easily bump into each other or get knocked by the forceful water jets. 4. Incomplete drying: Adequate airspace between the dishes is required for effective drying after the cleaning process is complete. Overcrowding the dishwasher with two items per peg would reduce the amount of space for air circulation, which in turn may lead to dishes remaining damp and unhygienic post-wash. As a result, based on these factors, placing two items between every peg in the dishwasher may negatively impact the appliance's ability to clean all items effectively. Therefore, it can be concluded that the perturbation does have an adverse effect on the cleaning process, both directly and indirectly. Directly, because the arrangement hinders water circulation, reduces detergent penetration, and increases the risk of damage. Indirectly, because the overcrowding may lead to incomplete drying and potentially unhygienic conditions for the dishware. Consequently, to maintain optimal cleaning performance, it is recommended to adhere to the standard guidelines of placing one item per peg and ensuring adequate spacing for effective water circulation and detergent access."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant that follows instruction extremely well.

John wanted to know what makes a lake different from a pond. To that end, he first visited a lake. He labeled that part of the study as case A. Then he visited a pond. He labeled that part of the study as case B. John realized that though both of them were water-bodies, they were very different.  Hint: A lake (from Latin lacus) is a terrain feature (or physical feature), a body of liquid on the surface of a world that is localized to the bottom of basin (another type of landform or terrain feature; that is, it is not global) and moves slowly if it moves at all. On Earth, a body of water is considered a lake when it is inland, not part of the ocean, is larger and deeper than a pond, and is fed by a river. The only world other than Earth known to harbor lakes is Titan, Saturn's largest moon, which has lakes of ethane, most likely mixed with methane. It is not known if Titan's lakes are fed by rivers, though Titan's surface is carved by numerous river beds. Natural lakes on Earth are generally found in mountainous areas, rift zones, and areas with ongoing or recent glaciation. Other lakes are found in endorheic basins or along the courses of mature rivers. In some parts of the world, there are many lakes because of chaotic drainage patterns left over from the last Ice Age. All lakes are temporary over geologic time scales, as they will slowly fill in with sediments or spill out of the basin containing them.

Here is a hypothesis: Charles Garnier never visited this double staircase before he designed the Paris Opera House. Is it possible to conclude that if the premise is true, then so is the hypothesis?","output":"To assess the relationship between the premise and the hypothesis, we need to examine them carefully and identify the logical connections between them. Here are the steps to analyze the given information: Step 1: Understand the premise and hypothesis Premise: The majestic double staircase inside inspired Charles Garnier for his design of the Paris Opera House. Hypothesis: Charles Garnier never visited this double staircase before he designed the Paris Opera House. Step 2: Identify the logical connections The premise states that the double staircase inspired Charles Garnier's design of the Paris Opera House. Meanwhile, the hypothesis claims that Charles Garnier never visited the double staircase before designing the Paris Opera House. Step 3: Analyze the connections The premise implies there is some sort of influence from the double staircase on Charles Garnier's design. In order for this influence to occur, it is reasonable to assume that Charles Garnier had to be aware of the double staircase, which contradicts the hypothesis that he never visited it before designing the Paris Opera House. Step 4: Determine if the premise supports the hypothesis As the premise suggests that Charles Garnier was inspired by the double staircase, and the hypothesis contradicts this by stating he never visited it before designing the Paris Opera House, we cannot conclude that the hypothesis must be true if the premise is true. Based on the analysis, it is not possible to conclude that if the premise is true, then so is the hypothesis because they contradict each other. The premise implies the staircase had an influence on Charles Garnier's design, while the hypothesis suggests he never visited the staircase before creating his design."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

The story must be coherent and the facts must be incorporated in the order they are given. Here's an outline of the steps to complete the task: 1. Understand the task: The task requires you to create a story using the provided key facts in the given order and ensure the story is both coherent and engaging. 2. Identify the key facts: The five facts are:    a. Babe breaks up with girlfriend    b. Collins chooses small town of Glendale purely by chance    c. Librarian Connie Randall is bored to death of Glendale    d. Death is the best way to interest someone as experienced as Babe    e. Pregnant Connie receives a visit from Kay just before Babe's return from travels 3. Write the story, incorporating all the key facts in the order given. Begin story: Babe had never been one for long-term relationships, so it came as no surprise when he decided to break up with his girlfriend of six months. The decision left him with a sense of longing and a thirst for new experiences. Unsure of what his next move should be, he decided to leave his comfortable life in the city and search for adventure. It was a cloudy Tuesday when Collins, Babe's best friend, guided him towards the small town of Glendale. The decision was purely by chance, as both friends had simply wanted a change of scenery and tossed a dart at a map of the United States. Little did they know that Glendale would ultimately change the course of their lives. Upon their arrival in Glendale, Babe and Collins quickly found their way to the local library, a quaint little building populated by dusty bookshelves and the soft whispers of eager readers. Within its walls, they encountered Connie Randall, the mousy librarian who had spent her entire life in Glendale. She possessed a nearly encyclopedic knowledge of the town and its history but found herself increasingly bored to death with the predictable patterns that governed her days. As Babe and Collins began to frequent the library, it became apparent that death was an experience with which Babe had grown increasingly fascinated. Years spent travelling the globe had left him searching for a way to capture the essence of living, and he was drawn to the concept of death as the ultimate end to all existence. Intrigued by his dark preoccupations, Connie found herself drawn to Babe's morbid curiosity. Several months passed, and Babe and Collins grew ever more enchanted with life in Glendale. Eventually, Babe and Connie's connection transformed into a passionate love affair, leaving Connie pregnant. Meanwhile, Collins had become a fixture in the community and couldn't imagine leaving. One day, just before Babe was set to return from his most recent voyage, an unexpected visitor arrived at Connie's doorstep. Her name was Kay, a mysterious and enigmatic woman with a captivating aura that seemed to cling to her like a second skin. As Connie stood there with a hand on her swollen belly, the two exchanged glances that seemed to carry the weight of countless unsaid words. As the story unfolds, it will not only explore the relationship between Babe, Connie, and the unborn child but also delve into the mysterious appearance of Kay and the impact she has on their lives. Moreover, the story will demonstrate how both death and life continue to pique Babe's interest and curiosity while showcasing the transformative effect a small town like Glendale can have on its inhabitants.

Article: After the establishment of Hampshire County Council, following the act in 1888, Southampton became a county borough within the county of Hampshire, which meant that it had many features of a county, but governance was now shared between the Corporation in Southampton and the new county council. There is a great source of confusion in the fact that the ancient shire county, along with its associated assizes, was known as the County of Southampton or Southamptonshire. This was officially changed to Hampshire in 1959 although the county had been commonly known as Hampshire or Hantscire for centuries. Southampton became a non-metropolitan district in 1974. Question: What designation was Southampton given in 1974?","output":"In 1974, Southampton was given the designation of a non-metropolitan district. This change occurred as a result of the local government reorganization in the United Kingdom, which aimed to streamline the administrative structures and improve efficiency. As a non-metropolitan district, Southampton continued to be a part of Hampshire County, but its governance and administration were more focused on local issues and responsibilities, rather than having to manage the broader operations of a county-level government.

Q:The answer to the question: What college did Lancaster attend between school and university? is inside the article: At the age of seventeen Lancaster passed his final school examinations and gained entrance to Lincoln College, Oxford, to study history. He persuaded his mother to allow him to leave Charterhouse at once, giving him several months between school and university, during which he enrolled on a course of life classes at the Byam Shaw School of Art in London. In October 1926 he started at Oxford. There, as at Charterhouse, he found two camps in which some students chose to group themselves: the \\"hearties\\" presented themselves as aggressively heterosexual and anti-intellectual; the \\"aesthetes\\" had a largely homosexual membership. Lancaster followed his elder contemporary Kenneth Clark in being contentedly heterosexual but nonetheless one of the aesthetes, and he was accepted as a leading member of their set. He cultivated the image of an Edwardian dandy, with large moustache, a monocle and check suits, modelling his persona to a considerable degree on Beerbohm, whom he admired greatly. He also absorbed some characteristics of the Oxford don Maurice Bowra; Lancaster's friend James Lees-Milne commented, \\"Bowra's influence over Osbert was marked, to the extent that he adopted the guru's booming voice, explosive emphasis of certain words and phrases, and habit in conversation of regaling his audiences with rehearsed witticisms and gossip.\\" Lancaster's undergraduate set included Stephen Spender, Randolph Churchill, and most importantly John Betjeman, who became a close friend and lifelong influence.Lancaster tried rowing with the Oxford University Boat Club, but quickly discovered that he was no more suited to that than he had been to field games at school. He joined the Oxford University Dramatic Society (OUDS), acted in supporting roles, designed programme covers, wrote, and choreographed. He contributed prose and drawings to Isis and Cherwell magazines, engaged in student pranks, staged an exhibition of his pictures, attended life classes, and became established as a major figure in the Oxonian social scene.

Scrub the area with a soft brush and rinse with clean water. This solution is more effective due to the presence of bleach which is known for its ability to disinfect, kill mold and mildew, and remove stubborn stains. The combination with trisodium phosphate (a heavy-duty cleaning agent) and laundry detergent helps break down and lift away dirt and grime, making it easier to scrub the surface clean. The alternative solution with fabric softener in place of bleach may only help to remove some dirt and grime, but it lacks the disinfecting and mold/mildew-killing properties that bleach possesses.

Scary Monsters and Super Creeps (1980) produced the number-one hit \\"Ashes to Ashes\\", featuring the textural work of guitar-synthesist Chuck Hammer and revisiting the character of Major Tom from \\"Space Oddity\\". The song gave international exposure to the underground New Romantic movement when Bowie visited the London club \\"Blitz\\"—the main New Romantic hangout—to recruit several of the regulars (including Steve Strange of the band Visage) to act in the accompanying video, renowned as one of the most innovative of all time. While Scary Monsters used principles established by the Berlin albums, it was considered by critics to be far more direct musically and lyrically. The album's hard rock edge included conspicuous guitar contributions from Robert Fripp, Chuck Hammer, and Pete Townshend. As \\"Ashes to Ashes\\" hit number one on the UK charts, Bowie opened a three-month run on Broadway on 24 September, starring as John Merrick in The Elephant Man.Bowie paired with Queen in 1981 for a one-off single release, \\"Under Pressure\\". The duet was a hit, becoming Bowie's third UK number-one single. Bowie was given the lead role in the BBC's 1982 televised adaptation of Bertolt Brecht's play Baal. Coinciding with its transmission, a five-track EP of songs from the play, recorded earlier in Berlin, was released as David Bowie in Bertolt Brecht's Baal. In March 1982, the month before Paul Schrader's film Cat People came out, Bowie's title song, \\"Cat People (Putting Out Fire)\\", was released as a single, becoming a minor US hit and entering the UK Top 30.Bowie reached his peak of popularity and commercial success in 1983 with Let's Dance. Co-produced by Chic's Nile Rodgers, the album went platinum in both the UK and the US. Its three singles became Top 20 hits in both countries, where its title track reached number one. \\"Modern Love\\" and \\"China Girl\\" each made No. 2 in the UK, accompanied by a pair of \\"absorbing\\" promotional videos that biographer David Buckley said \\"activated key archetypes in the pop world.

Q: Paragraph: Opening statements and testimony began Monday before a commissioner with the Missouri Administrative Hearing Commission. At issue is the state health department’s effort to revoke the license for Planned Parenthood’s clinic in St. Louis. The state has said that part of the reason it is seeking to remove the license is a series of “failed abortions.” Assistant Attorney General John Sauer outlined details of those cases. In one, he said, a woman had to undergo up to five procedures over four days to complete the abortion. In another, a woman bled heavily after doctors failed to recognize a condition that put her at higher than normal risk. Sauer cited a third incident where a woman had an abortion but later had to return for a second one because the doctor missed that she was pregnant with twins. Donna Harrison, executive director of the American Association of Pro-Life Obstetricians and Gynecologists, was called as an expert witness by the state and reviewed the records. She said there was no indication that adequate follow-up exams were done on the patient. “There is a much higher risk of infection” if fetal parts remain in a woman’s uterus after an abortion, Harrison said. But Planned Parenthood’s attorney, Chuck Hatfield, played a video deposition of William Koebel, director of the section of the health department responsible for abortion clinic licensing, who was asked if the facility was deemed unsafe. “Not that I recall,” Koebel said. Hatfield said that after a March inspection, the health department “moved the goal line” in an effort to take away the clinic’s license. On Monday Koebel said that an inspection on March 11-13 discovered that no complication reports had been filed for a woman who had to undergo multiple procedures before her abortion was complete. That incident prompted Koebel to request records of all incidents of women who had to undergo multiple abortion procedures. Four women were found. Details of the fourth were not outlined Monday. Planned Parenthood officials said at the hearing that the state cherry-picked four difficult cases out of thousands of successful abortions. Missouri would become the first state since 1974, the year after the Supreme Court’s Roe v. Wade decision, without a functioning abortion clinic if the license revocation is allowed. The battle also comes as abortion rights supporters raise concerns that conservative-led states, including Missouri, are attempting to end abortion through tough new laws and tighter regulation. Several dozen observers filed the administrative hearing room at a state building in downtown St. Louis, the vast majority of them wearing pink T-shirts to show support for Planned Parenthood. Heightened security was outside amid concerns about possible protests. Planned Parenthood supporters unfurled a large abortion rights banner along a parking garage. Commissioner Sreenivasa Rao Dandamudi is presiding over the hearing, which is expected to last five days. A commission official said that in his role, Dandamudi “acts as an independent trial judge.” A ruling isn’t expected until February at the earliest. The health department has sought to interview physicians involved in those abortions, including medical residents who no longer work there. Planned Parenthood has said it can’t force them to talk and that the state’s concerns were addressed long ago. Attorneys for the health department wrote in legal filings to the commission that physicians’ refusal to talk “presents the final, critical obstacle.” Missouri is among several states to pass new restrictions on abortions in the hope that the increasingly conservative U.S. Supreme Court will eventually overturn Roe v. Wade. Republican Gov. Mike Parson signed legislation in May banning abortions at or beyond eight weeks of pregnancy, with exceptions for medical emergencies but not for rape or incest. A federal judge in August temporarily blocked implementation of the law until the legal challenge plays out in court, which could take several months. While the Missouri case unfolded, Planned Parenthood quietly built a new abortion clinic in Illinois, just across the Mississippi River from St. Louis. The 18,000-square-foot (1,700-square-meter) clinic in Fairview Heights, 12 miles (19 kilometers) east of St. Louis, opened Wednesday, in part to meet the demand for abortions from Missouri residents. Missouri women have been increasingly getting abortions at the Hope Clinic for Women in Granite City, Illinois, another St. Louis suburb. Deputy Director Alison Dreith said 58% of the abortions performed at the Hope Clinic through August of this year involved Missouri women, compared with 37% involving Illinois women. Another abortion clinic sits in Overland Park, Kansas, a Kansas City suburb. The clinic is 2 miles (3 kilometers) from the state line. Information from the state of Kansas shows about 3,300 of the 7,000 abortions performed there last year involved Missouri residents. Claim: Hearing begins on fate of Missouri’s lone abortion clinic. A:","output":"The hearing on the fate of Missouri's lone abortion clinic began on Monday before a commissioner with the Missouri Administrative Hearing Commission.

We want to find the value of 'b'. Remember those colorful building blocks? Let's imagine 433*b means we have 433 tiny blocks, and we need to find out how many times we have to stack them to get the right height. Problem: 433 * b - 7420490 = -7413995 First, let's bring the number without 'b' to the other side. That's like taking away some blocks to make the stacks equal.

Given the question: Happened to me while visiting Chicago a few weeks ago. A young couple with a baby in a pram boarded a crowded bus. The bus driver would not pull out of the stop until the pram was secured in the wheelchair chocks, however an elderly women wouldn’t give up her seat (seat needed to be folded up in order to make room for the pram in the wheelchair holding apparatus). We sat there for about 4–5 minutes while the driver, the mother and the elderly lady argued. At the end, my wife and I offered our seats (more like a commanding, cajoling, what-she-wanted-to hear, kind of discourse), and the lady moved into our seats. The young couple locked down their pram, and the bus took off. Meg and I stood for the rest of the trip. She was really annoyed over having to move, and there was some baggage attached to her situation—I hate to have to mention the racial aspects here but it’s an important aspect of the story. Most of the passengers were younger white folks (bus was heading through a neighborhood where re-gentrification had taken place). The elderly woman was at least 75 years and the only black person in the front of the crowded bus. She was sitting in a designated seat reserved for elderly or handicapped, and obviously she had earned her status to claim that seat. Unfortunately, it was also the one seat that needed to be vacated if the wheelchair equipment got used. As the bus rode on, her anger simmered. She asked me what I (middle-aged white guy) would do in a spot like that. All I could answer was to offer it up to God. Hot day, no air conditioning on the bus, people just want to get to their destinations. Question: Who was angry as the bus rode on? Options:  A. The man who offered his seat to the woman who had to move  B. not enough information  C. The woman who had to move  D. The wife of the man who offered his seat  === The correct answer is The answer is:","output":"C. The woman who had to move The text states that \\"As the bus rode on, her anger simmered,\\" and it's referring to the elderly woman who had been initially asked to move from her seat to make room for a baby pram. The situation was especially sensitive, as the woman was of advanced age and the only black person sitting at the front part of a predominantly young, white crowd in a re-gentrified neighborhood. This was a difficult situation as she was asked to give up her seat, which was designated for elderly or handicapped persons, for the pram to be secured in the wheelchair chocks. However, eventually she did move due to the persistent request of the original poster and his wife, even though she was visibly annoyed over having to give up her seat. There is no clear mention of the wife or husband (who offered up their seats) being angry, so we can reasonably assert that the person feeling anger during the bus ride was the elderly woman who had been made to give up her seat. So, option C is the correct answer."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant. You will be given a task. You must generate a detailed and long answer. What was the original name of the 'London Times' newspaper? What is the answer?","output":"The original name of the newspaper commonly referred to as the 'London Times' was, at the time of its inception, called \\"The Daily Universal Register.\\" The paper was founded by publisher John Walter on January 1, 1785. The goal of the publication was to provide the public with a compendium of useful information, including shipping schedules, advertisements, and events happening in London. Additionally, it aimed to cover a wide range of topics, such as politics, literature, and entertainment. However, The Daily Universal Register lasted under that name for only three years. On January 1, 1788, the newspaper's name was changed to its current and more well-known title, \\"The Times.\\" This change came as a strategic move by Walter to increase the newspaper's readership, as the original name was deemed cumbersome and difficult to remember. The name \\"The Times\\" allowed for a more easily recognizable and memorable title, ultimately helping the newspaper develop a wider readership base and establish itself as one of the United Kingdom's premier media outlets. Over its long history, The Times has undergone numerous changes in ownership and editorial policies, while also playing an important role in shaping and influencing public opinion in Britain. Notable personalities who have contributed to the newspaper at various points in its history include Charles Dickens, Virginia Woolf, Thomas Barnes, John Thadeus Delane, and numerous others.

His limousine driver and a witness to the arrest, Louis Goldblatt, described him as \\"genuinely dumbfounded by the whole affair.\\" Tour manager Eric Barrett said that he looked \\"as if there had been a plane crash\\". Hendrix biographers Harry Shapiro and Caesar Glebbeek described the incident as \\"a nightmare which ... plagued\\" him for seven months. According to Redding, \\"the bust knocked any positive feelings Jimi was holding onto out of him\\" and that he was in \\"agonised suspense\\" from the arrest until the trial. In 2012, Plummer wrote: \\"The real possibility of prison hung over Hendrix like a spectre ... a threat to his career and the cause of much brooding and rumination.\\" Journalist Charles Shaar Murray asserted that the incident jeopardized what he described as \\"Hendrix's increasingly fragile peace of mind\\". Two weeks after the arrest, Hendrix told Lawrence: \\"Whatever I have done ... getting hooked on heroin is not one of them.\\" He explained that his fear of needles discouraged him from using the drug and that having known junkies convinced him that it was not something he should get involved with. Soon after the story of his arrest became public, he drew a connection between the bust and anti-establishment sentiments: \\"All of that is the establishment fighting back ... Eventually, they will swallow themselves up, but I don't want them to swallow up too many kids as they go along.\\"According to Shapiro and Glebbeek, in 1969 there was little confidence in the staying power of rock stars; it was assumed that their careers were going to be short, and industry insiders operated under a \\"take the money and run\\" mentality.

However, during a routine training exercise that involves virtual reality (VR) simulations, Bond suddenly fails—an unthinkable rarity! This training exercise is meant to prepare agents for a dangerous mission to stop a syndicate from activating a weapon called \\"Zero Protocol,\\" a tool capable of triggering mass destruction via global internet control.  The VR simulation is supposedly designed to counteract various contingencies this mission could present. The failure leaves not just Bond, but also his superiors, startled. The unnerving incident leads M, the head of MI6, to temporarily bench Bond, fearing that his failure might be an indicator of his declining abilities or a deep-rooted issue. While M searches for alternative agents, Bond goes rogue, convinced there's something amiss with the training program.  Meanwhile, Dr. Skye McTavish, the brain behind MI6's sophisticated VR simulations and Bond's ex-lover, is baffled as well. Unsettled by Bond's unanticipated failing streak, Dr. Skye reluctantly joins him in uncovering the truth behind this mysterious anomaly.  Upon further investigation, they unearth that the syndicate has infiltrated MI6 and compromised the VR simulation system, making it excessively complex and impossible for any agent to succeed. This manipulation was a tactic to stall MI6 and buy the syndicate time, ensuring no agents were prepared to stop the \\"Zero Protocol\\" from being activated.  With time ticking, Bond and Dr. Skye now must team up to outwit the infiltrators within MI6, combat the menacing syndicate, and disable the \\"Zero Protocol\\" in reality. In this electrifying journey, Bond must overcome his failure in the VR training and prove that no simulation can truly mimic or measure his field resourcefulness and dynamic strategy. \\"Zero Protocol\\" is an adrenaline-fueled blend of suspense, action, and espionage where James Bond confronts not just a global threat, but also his personal failures, challenging the notion of his invincibility. This thrilling ride will question, test, and ultimately affirm why Bond remains the world's favorite spy."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant. You will be given a task.

The record company was founded by Berry Gordy, Jr. as Tamla Records on January 12, 1958, and was incorporated as Motown Record Corporation on April 14, 1960, in Detroit, Michigan. The name, a portmanteau of \\"motor\\" and \\"town\\", has also become a nickname for Detroit. Motown played an important role in the racial integration of popular music as an African American-owned record label that achieved significant crossover success. In the 1960s, Motown and its subsidiary labels (including Tamla Motown, the brand used outside the US) were the most successful proponents of what came to be known as the Motown Sound, a style of soul music with a distinct pop influence. During the 1960s, Motown achieved spectacular success for a small record company: 79 records in the Top Ten of the \\"Billboard\\" Hot 100 record chart between 1960 and 1969., Sweet Sweetback's Baadasssss Song is a 1971 American independent action thriller film written, produced, scored, edited, directed by and starring Melvin Van Peebles.

Pryor was known for uncompromising examinations of racism and topical contemporary issues, which employed colorful vulgarities and profanity, as well as racial epithets. He reached a broad audience with his trenchant observations and storytelling style. He is widely regarded as one of the most important and influential stand-up comedians of all time: Jerry Seinfeld called Pryor \\"The Picasso of our profession\\" and Bob Newhart heralded Pryor as \\"the seminal comedian of the last 50 years\\". Dave Chappelle said of Pryor, \\"You know those, like, evolution charts of man? He was the dude walking upright. Richard was the highest evolution of comedy.\\" This legacy can be attributed, in part, to the unusual degree of intimacy Pryor brought to bear on his comedy. As Bill Cosby reportedly once said, \\"Richard Pryor drew the line between comedy and tragedy as thin as one could possibly paint it.\\", Blaxploitation or blacksploitation is an ethnic subgenre of the exploitation film, emerging in the United States during the early 1970s. Blaxploitation films were originally made specifically for an urban black audience, but the genre's audience appeal soon broadened across racial and ethnic lines. The Los Angeles National Association for the Advancement of Colored People (NAACP) head and ex-film publicist Junius Griffin coined the term from the words \\"black\\" and \\"exploitation.\\" Blaxploitation films were the first to regularly feature soundtracks of funk and soul music and primarily black casts. \\"Variety\\" credited \\"Sweet Sweetback's Baadasssss Song\\" and the less radical Hollywood-financed film \\"Shaft\\" (both released in 1971) with the invention of the blaxploitation genre., The Mack is a 1973 blaxploitation film directed by California native Michael Campus, starring Max Julien and Richard Pryor. The film also stars Oscar-nominee Juanita Moore, and Tony nominated actor Dick Anthony Williams. Filmed in Oakland, California the movie follows the rise and fall of Goldie. After returning home from a 5-year prison sentence, he returns home to find his brother involved in Black nationalism. Goldie decides to take an alternative path, striving to become the citys biggest pimp. Although the movie was produced during the era of such blaxploitation movies as \\"Dolemite\\", its producers do not label it a true blaxploitation picture. They believe it to be a social commentary, according to \\"Mackin' Ain't Easy\\", a documentary about the making of the film, which can be found on the DVD edition. Its soundtrack was recorded by Motown artist Willie Hutch., Jerome Allen \\"Jerry\\" Seinfeld (born April 29, 1954) is an American comedian, actor, writer, producer and director who is best known for portraying a semifictional version of himself in the sitcom \\"Seinfeld\\", which he created and wrote with Larry David.

Are these two questions paraphrases of each other?","output":"To complete the task, I'm going to answer each question the user asked individually.  Firstly, \\"How is Austria as a country to settle down?\\" To answer this question, I would need to gather data about several factors about living in Austria such as quality of life, cost of living, work opportunities particularly in the software engineering field, nature of people, cultural fit, etc.  Secondly, \\"How do Germans see Austria?\\" This question needs an understanding of the general perspective or bias, if any, that Germans might have towards Austria. It would require research or understanding based on several factors like historical relations, cultural similarities and differences, German expat experiences in Austria, etc. The third question asks, \\"Are these two questions paraphrases of each other?\\" - To answer this, I would analyse the semantic meaning of both questions to identify if they are meaning the same. After careful consideration, the two questions are not paraphrases of each other. Paraphrasing generally means to say the same thing but using different words or phrases, implying a rewording without changing the meaning.  From a semantic standpoint, the first question seeks to evaluate Austria as a place to settle from the perspective of someone who might potentially live there.  Whereas, the second question is inquiring about the views of German people about Austria, which could involve their perceptions on a variety of factors, not necessarily related to settling down there.  Therefore, while these two pieces of information might overlap in some areas (for instance if Germans have favorable impressions about living in Austria), they are not asking for the same information, hence not paraphrase of each other."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

The word \\"website\\" is a common noun just like \\"dog\\", \\"wallet\\", or \\"car\\" so it shouldn't be capitalized unless it's at the beginning of a sentence or a part of a title. The second ‘PayPal website’ is referring to PayPal’s website in general and as such, ‘website’ is not part of the proper noun and stays lowercase.

Willi (Walter Slezak), a German survivor, is pulled aboard and denies being the U-boat's captain. During an animated debate, engine room crewman Kovac (John Hodiak) demands the German be thrown out to drown. However, the others object, with radioman Stanley (Hume Cronyn), wealthy industrialist Rittenhouse (Henry Hull) and columnist Connie Porter (Tallulah Bankhead), who speaks German, succeeding in arguing that he be allowed to stay. Porter, initially alone in the boat, had managed to bring her luggage with her, and her primary concern at first is a run in her stocking. She is thrilled at having filmed the battle between the two vessels, but her movie camera is the first in a series of her possessions to be lost overboard in a succession of incidents. Among the passengers is Mrs. Higley, a young British woman (Heather Angel) whose infant child is dead when they are pulled from the water after being saved by steward \\"Joe\\" Spencer (Canada Lee). After being treated by a U.S. Army nurse, Alice (Mary Anderson), she must be tied down to stop her from hurting herself.

You will be given a task. You must generate a detailed and long answer. Summarize this article: Nigel Twiston-Davies’s 11 year-old had given an exhibition round of jumping under the trainer’s son, Sam, until that point and was still contesting the lead when he ploughed through the fence. Another horse also fell at the fence, hampering two others, which caused them to unseat their rider.      Little Josh, who gave Sam Twiston-Davies his big break as a jockey when winning the Paddy Power Gold Cup at Cheltenham in 2010, had been around the course twice before finishing seventh in this race a year ago and then winning the Grand Sefton Chase in December.      “It’s a disaster,” said the trainer. “He was one of Sam’s favourites. He got him going as a professional and gave him a winner around here. He went out doing what he enjoyed and he won’t be forgotten.”      David Muir, the RSPCA’s equine consultant, said: “I’m not going to defend the death nor condemn the BHA for producing more forgiving fences. I’m waiting on a post-mortem before commenting on this case.”      There was a suspicion, however, after his failure to take off that, like Battlefront on Thursday, Little Josh may have had a heart attack going into the fence.      It will have been a worry for the authorities that for the second time in two days there were a series of false starts before the starter could get them away in a race over the Aintree fences.      Last night the Aintree stewards had 25 of the 29 jockeys who rode in the race into the stewards’ room for interviews and banned them all for one day. One thing is for sure, the 40 riders in today’s National can expect a stern talking to from stewards after weighing out for the race.      Despite all that, professional jockeys who were getting their first feel of the newly-constructed fences, gave the course a ringing endorsement.      Last year’s National winning jockey Daryl Jacob, who finished 12th in the Topham on Fistral Beach, said: “The fences definitely have a bit of give. They must have, as I should have fallen two or three times.”      Another Grand National winner Jason Maguire, who finished fourth yesterday on Dunowen Point, said: “I had a nice run round – the fences seem brilliant.”      Until that last ditch, the 15th fence yesterday, the race had been almost devoid of incident. One jockey was unseated at the eighth and another at the 14th, but the only actual faller until that point had come down at the ninth and a field of 27, headed by Little Josh, had skipped over Becher’s Brook, Foinavon, the Canal Turn and Valentine’s without a problem.      Though there were a few more empty saddles because of the unseated riders, only three of the 29 starters actually fell and one of them, State Benefit, was led back by one of the course’s mounted outriders, an innovation for this year’s meeting.      At the other end of the race on a day when Nicky Henderson horses could do nothing wrong Barry Geraghty and Triolo D’Alene emerged from a group of 15 to lead going to the last and run on to win by three quarters of a length from Walkon.      Henderson had also won with My Tent Or Yours, Sprinter Sacre then made it four wins for the day when Minella Forfitness won the handicap hurdle.      Having done all his winning this winter in soft or heavy going, the faster ground here might have been an issue for Albert Bartlett winner At Fisher’s Cross in the John Smith’s Sefton Novice Hurdle.      However, if anything, Rebecca Curtis’s six year-old was even more impressive and went right away from his field to win in the manner of potentially smart novice chaser in the making.      Dynaste, runner-up in the Jewson Novice Chase at Cheltenham, confirmed that he will be a major player in staying chases next season when taking the Mildmay Novice Chase with some degree of comfort. The grey was always travelling nicely and quickened well from the last fence to win by six lengths. ||||| Aintree racecourse will stage the Grand National on Saturday under unprecedented scrutiny after the Topham Chase over the same course on Friday resulted in the death of one horse and was the subject of two false starts.      The death of Little Josh at the 15th fence was the first fatal injury to a runner as the result of a fall on the Grand National course since modifications were made to the fences following the deaths of two horses in last year's race. The incident followed the death from a suspected heart attack of Battlefront during a race over the National fences on Thursday.      The start of Friday's Topham Chase was a shambles despite jockeys having been warned about their conduct at the start of races over the National course.      Jamie Stier, the British Horseracing Authority director of raceday operations and regulation, said: \\"We are very disappointed with the starts to each of the two races run over the Grand National course over the last two days. Ahead of tomorrow's Grand National all riders will be expected to respect the importance of the start of the race and approach it in a much more appropriate manner.\\"      Little Josh appeared to put down his front feet at the 15th of the 18 fences, and then hit the obstacle and fell. He broke a shoulder and was humanely destroyed.      Professor Chris Proudman, the veterinary advisor to Aintree racecourse, said:\\"He received immediate veterinary attention for a broken shoulder, but this injury was not treatable and it was the necessary course of action.\\"      The remaining 28 horses to contest the race returned uninjured. In all, 19 completed the course, three were pulled up and three more unseated their riders. \\"We have made significant improvements in safety at the course,\\" John Baker, Aintree and North West Regional Director for Jockey Club Racecourses, said, \\"but we also recognise that jump racing carries risk you can never completely remove from the sport.\\"      Little Josh was trained by Nigel Twiston-Davies, who has saddled two Grand National winners, and ridden by his son, Sam.      \\"He's gone out doing what he loved the most,\\" said the trainer. \\"He's jumped round those fences before and it's one of those things. It could happen anywhere and it's not the fences, it could have happened at a park course.\\"      David Muir, equine consultant to the Royal Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals, said that it is too early to draw conclusions about the death of Little Josh.      \\"At this stage I'm not prepared to condemn the work done to produce a more forgiving fence,\\" Muir said. \\"I'm waiting for the post-mortem results, as I'm not sure what happened here. The horse is an excellent jumper and he simply went through the fence.\\"      Liam Treadwell, who won the 2009 National on Mon Mome was taken to hospital after sustaining injuries in a fall at the ninth. ||||| Summary:","output":"The Grand National race at Aintree experienced an unfortunate accident during the Topham Chase.

If they become oxygen deprived, they may turn a pinkish color and appear slow moving or tired. To ensure the water has enough oxygen, you should aerate the tank twice a day, once in the morning and once at night. You can use an air pump to aerate the water, such as an air pump used in small aquariums. Stick the air pump in the water and let it aerate the tank for at least one minute, twice a day.  Another option is to use a small turkey baster to aerate the tank. You can squeeze the turkey baster in the air and then put it in the water and release the air to put more oxygen in the water. Pull the turkey baster in and out of the water, placing air in the water, for at least one minute, twice a day. To make your own air bubbler: Take a pipette that you aren't planning on using for anything else. Poke a hole in the very top, then poke many tiny holes in the squirting-out end. Either use a pin or staple it several times from different angles with a stapler, then remove the staples. If you do not want to remember to aerate the tank twice a day, you can place a small live plant in the sea monkeys’ tank to provide oxygen in the water. Use an underwater aquarium plant that is known to provide good oxygen underwater. Sea monkeys do not like being in a very cold environment or a very hot environment. You should put their tank in a spot of your house that gets indirect sunlight and is at least 22 degrees Celsius, or 72 Fahrenheit. This will ensure the tank gets enough heat and is not too cold for your sea monkeys. A tank that is too cold will lead to them becoming immobile sea monkeys and sea monkeys that do not grow. If you notice the sea monkeys are not moving in their tank or growing, it could be because the tank is too cold and needs to be moved to a warmer spot in your home. Place it in a spot with indirect sunlight so it gets enough heat but does not get too hot. Green algae in the tank is a good thing, as the algae acts as food and provides oxygen for your sea monkeys. But if you notice the tank smells really bad and the water appears dark and cloudy, you may need to clean the tank and the water.  You will need a coffee filter and a clean glass filled with unchlorinated salt water. Use a net to take the sea monkeys out of the tank and place them in the clean glass with water. Place the coffee filter over a clean tank and run the tank water through the coffee filter several times. Try to filter out as much of the gunk in the water as possible. You can use a paper towel to clean out the bottom and sides of the tank. You can also use a Q-tip to clean out any gunk in the crevices of the tank. Smell the tank water to check that it no longer smells foul. Then, put the water back in the tank, followed by the sea monkeys. Top up the tank water with purified, room temperature water. Feed your sea monkeys and aerate the tank several times throughout the day. Then, feed them again five days later, per their usual feeding schedule.","output":"To keep sea monkeys happy and healthy, give them oxygen by aerating their tank twice a day, keep their tank in a warm place with indirect sunlight, and clean their tank when it gets dirty or smelly."},{"instruction":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

In France, where Paris is, there have been lots of times when people saw drones flying around places they shouldn't be, like near power plants and military areas. The city of Paris has a rule that says people can't fly drones in certain places without permission to help keep everyone safe. The police are working hard to learn more about these drones and why they were flying where they shouldn't be, so they can help make sure the people in Paris feel safe and happy again."},{"instruction":"Given the question: Answer the following question given this paragraph:   The kidneys are responsible for removing excess H+ ions from the blood. If the kidneys fail, what would happen to blood pH and to hemoglobin affinity for oxygen? Factors That Affect Oxygen Binding The oxygen-carrying capacity of hemoglobin determines how much oxygen is carried in the blood. In addition to P O , 2 other environmental factors and diseases can affect oxygen carrying capacity and delivery. Carbon dioxide levels, blood pH, and body temperature affect oxygen-carrying capacity (Figure 39.20). When carbon + dioxide is in the blood, it reacts with water to form bicarbonate (HCO− 3 ) and hydrogen ions (H ). As the level of carbon dioxide in the blood increases, more H+ is produced and the pH decreases. This increase in carbon dioxide and subsequent decrease in pH reduce the affinity of hemoglobin for oxygen. The oxygen dissociates from the Hb molecule, shifting the oxygen dissociation curve to the right. Therefore, more oxygen is needed to reach the same hemoglobin saturation level as when the pH was higher. A similar shift in the curve also results from an increase in body temperature. Increased temperature, such as from increased activity of skeletal muscle, causes the affinity of hemoglobin for oxygen to be reduced. Diseases like sickle cell anemia and thalassemia decrease the blood’s ability to deliver oxygen to tissues and its oxygencarrying capacity. In sickle cell anemia, the shape of the red blood cell is crescent-shaped, elongated, and stiffened, reducing its ability to deliver oxygen (Figure 39.21). In this form, red blood cells cannot pass through the capillaries. This is painful when it occurs. Thalassemia is a rare genetic disease caused by a defect in either the alpha or the beta subunit of Hb. Patients with thalassemia produce a high number of red blood cells, but these cells have lower-than-normal levels of hemoglobin. Therefore, the oxygen-carrying capacity is diminished.   Q: What are responsible for removing excess h+ ions from the blood?   Choices:  - liver nodes  - intestinal walls  - stomach chambers  - kidneys  A: The answer is:","output":"kidneys"},{"instruction":"Title: Disappointing Review: Word of mouth on this book was so strong that I had to pick it up.

Alan then throws a butcher knife at Mickey and the camp owner, Frank (Vincent Pastore), as well as the head cook Charlie (Isaac Hayes) seeing what he did, argues with Alan because he was already irritated by his misbehavior. Alan, suffering from rheumatic fever, runs away feeling rejected, with his stepbrother Michael (Michael Werner) chasing after him. After being threatened, Michael goes back to the camp, telling Alan that he does not care what he does any more. In the kitchen, Mickey is then killed when he is dumped into the deep fryer by an unseen person while cooking fries for dinner and later his body is dumped in the trash compactor.During the social, Alan is fooled by fellow stoners Weed (Adam Wylie) and Stan (Chaz Brewer) into smoking dried cow manure, mistaking it for marijuana which makes him cough and falls on Stan's crotch, earning him the nickname 'blowjob'. After the social, Weed is tied to a chair by the unseen killer and gas is squirted down his throat. The killer then sticks a lit up cigarette in his mouth and his insides explode.Ronnie starts to suspect that the murders that happened 20 years ago are happening again. Frank, in an attempt to ignore bad publicity, states that the murders were accidental and the camp continues to go on with its normal activities.Meanwhile, the local sheriff, Jerry, meets with a certain Ricky Thomas (Jonathan Tiersten), the stepbrother of the killer Angela from the first 'Sleepaway... A:","output":"In the movie Return to Sleepaway Camp, the arrival that makes the killer run off is not explicitly revealed in the given plot summary. However, considering the events and information provided, it's crucial to identify key elements of the story and potential suspects. Throughout the movie, numerous incidents and altercations take place involving various characters, such as Alan, Randy, Mickey, Michael, Weed, Stan, and others. Although the true identity of the killer remains unknown, there are a few key moments and potential motives worth examining. 1. Alan's outbursts and conflicts with other characters: Alan, the protagonist, has several confrontations with other campers and staff, causing friction and potential motivation for revenge. His relationship with Michael, his stepbrother, deteriorates, leaving Alan feeling rejected. 2. Ronnie's suspicion: Ronnie believes that the murders happening 20 years ago are reoccurring, which may cause other characters to feel uneasy or question the safety of the camp. This can make characters behave erratically, further confusing the situation. 3. Frank's denial: Camp owner Frank attempts to downplay the murders as accidents in an effort to avoid bad publicity and maintain the camp's reputation. He may either be naive about the true nature of the events or somehow involved. 4. Ricky's connection to the past: The local sheriff, Jerry, meets Ricky Thomas, the stepbrother of Angela, the killer from the first Sleepaway Camp movie. Ricky's presence introduces a direct connection to the previous killer and may imply a link to the current events or motive to continue Angela's work. To conclusively answer who makes the killer run off, watching the movie or assessing further information would be necessary. Identifying this piece of information is essential before deciding to invest in this film proposal. If the storyline and its resolution prove intriguing, suspenseful, and engaging, the film might be worth investing in.

To evaluate the given hypothesis, we must consider the following steps: 1. Analyze the premise: The premise only states that Whittington was speaking. It does not provide information about the environment, the presence of other people, or any factors that could impact the audibility of Whittington's speech. 2. Consider possible scenarios: There are various scenarios in which Whittington could be speaking. These could involve situations where people can hear Whittington or where no one can hear him.    Scenario A: Whittington is speaking in a crowded room where the noise level is too high, making it difficult for anyone to hear him.    Scenario B: Whittington is speaking in a quiet room with several people listening attentively and able to hear him. 3. Assess the hypothesis: In the given premise, there is no direct information that allows us to conclude whether or not \\"no one could hear Whittington.\\" Both scenarios A and B are congruent with the premise, but the hypothesis is true only in scenario A.

It seems like an impossible task to transform our self loathing into self-love, but it is possible with these five simple steps. I started to write some examples of the self loathing dialogue I occasionally have in my head and I found I couldn’t do it. It felt as wrong as criticising my closest friend. I guess it goes to prove that the shift from loathing to love is not always huge and momentous, but subtle and gradual. When I look in the mirror and see a part of my body I don’t like, I run through these five steps in my head. This following example is the kind of internal conversation I might have about my belly. 1. POSITIVE INTENT (THE GIFT) Recognise the gift your body is giving you. My belly fat is protecting and cushioning my intestines and reproductive system. By having a higher body fat percentage my hormones are functioning as they should, enabling me to have a normal transition through perimenopause. I fit my skin and the wrinkly empty skin folds are gone. 2. FORGIVENESS Acknowledge the way you have treated your body in the past. I am sorry that I have been either starving you or stuffing you with toxic food and that I have accused you of betraying me. I now realise that my body is a reflection of my thoughts and beliefs so I was hating myself. Please forgive me for treating you so badly. 3. GRATITUDE Notice the miracles your body performs even though you have abused it. I am so thankful that even though I have treated you so badly you are still healthy and functioning. I am amazed at your ability to heal a lifetime of digestive and hormonal issues within a short amount of time. Thank you for your forgiveness and that’s it’s not too late to take great care of you.

I am living in a society where there are almost 90 houses and almost all of them are occupied. We have one sweeper hired for whole society to collect waste and sweep out dust from our society roads. BTW her name is Hira masi (my brother calls her diamond masi :p). And she is extremely poor and she lives in those slums where almost nothing is available. She earns 50/100 per house each month. (Source) As she is extremely poor, all the society people help her a lot. From giving 2 times food to giving clothes and giving bonuses on special occasion as much as Rs. 1000, they almost help her in each and every aspect. And this is by far the most incredible thing our society has which is humanity. But the twist comes here. On the other side, she is extremely cunning. She rarely cleans the road, takes rarely wastes from homes, gives excuses that she is sick and does not come for work, etc. She does not do her work properly. She also request money from us saying that her family members are ill as much as Rs 10000, even if they are not. So this thing was discussed in our meeting and there some decided to continue her as she was very poor and some decided to leave her. But my mom today told me a great thing- If a person is doing her work seriously, then we will surely help him in every way, even if it is a matter of money, but the person who is not sincere and not doing work properly, then sometimes we have to step back from humanity and be strict. If the person is honest and he is REALLY in need of help, we should definitely help them. But the person who just fakes that he is in need, we should be strict/ignore them, else they will not do any work, and just simply rely on us. Sometimes, being strict and giving up humanity will make the person grow.

Background: The Rise and Fall of Ziggy Stardust and the Spiders from Mars (often shortened to Ziggy Stardust) is the fifth studio album by English musician David Bowie, released on 16 June 1972 in the United Kingdom. It was produced by Bowie and Ken Scott and features contributions from the Spiders from Mars, Bowie's backing band - Mick Ronson, Trevor Bolder and Mick Woodmansey. The album was recorded in Trident Studios, London, like his previous album, Hunky Dory. Most of the album was recorded in November 1971 with further sessions in January and early February 1972. Context: The Rise and Fall of Ziggy Stardust and The Spiders from Mars is about a bisexual alien rock superstar, called Ziggy Stardust. Ziggy Stardust was not conceived as a concept album and much of the story was written after the album was recorded. The characters were androgynous. Mick \\"Woody\\" Woodmansey, drummer for the Spiders from Mars, said the clothes they had worn had \\"femininity and sheer outrageousness\\", and that the characters' looks \\"definitely appealed to our rebellious artistic instincts\\". Nenad Georgievski of All About Jazz said the record was presented with \\"high-heeled boots, multicolored dresses, extravagant makeup and outrageous sexuality\\". Bowie had already developed an androgynous appearance, which was approved by critics, but received mixed reactions from audiences. His love of acting led his total immersion in the characters he created for his music. After acting the same role over an extended period, it became impossible for him to separate Ziggy Stardust (and subsequently The Thin White Duke) from his own offstage character. Bowie said that Ziggy \\"wouldn't leave me alone for years. That was when it all started to go sour ... My whole personality was affected. It became very dangerous. I really did have doubts about my sanity.\\"  The character was inspired by British rock 'n' roll singer Vince Taylor, whom David Bowie met after Taylor had had a breakdown and believed himself to be a cross between a god and an alien. However, Taylor was only part of the blueprint for the character. Other influences included the cult musician Legendary Stardust Cowboy and Kansai Yamamoto, who designed the costumes Bowie wore during the tour. An alternative theory is that, during a tour, Bowie developed the concept of Ziggy as a melding of the persona of Iggy Pop with the music of Lou Reed, producing \\"the ultimate pop idol\\". A girlfriend recalled his \\"scrawling notes on a cocktail napkin about a crazy rock star named Iggy or Ziggy\\", and on his return to England he declared his intention to create a character \\"who looks like he's landed from Mars\\".  The Ziggy Stardust name came partly from the Legendary Stardust Cowboy, and partly because Ziggy was \\"one of the few Christian names I could find beginning with the letter 'Z'\\". In 1990, Bowie explained that the \\"Ziggy\\" part came from a tailor's shop called Ziggy's that he passed on a train. He liked it because it had \\"that Iggy [Pop] connotation but it was a tailor's shop, and I thought, Well, this whole thing is gonna be about clothes, so it was my own little joke calling him Ziggy. So Ziggy Stardust was a real compilation of things.\\"  In the album's plotline, humanity will end within five years, because of lack of natural resources. Ziggy Stardust starts to believe in the existence of \\"infinites\\", extraterrestrial beings who are black hole jumpers, and in a spaceman who will be coming down to save the Earth. According to Bowie, he \\"takes himself up to the incredible spiritual heights and is kept alive by his disciples\\". During the song \\"Rock 'n' Roll Suicide\\", the infinites arrive, and tear Ziggy Stardust to pieces on stage, taking his elements to become visible. Question: Any other creative inspirations for Bowie? Answer:","output":"Aside from the previously mentioned inspirations for the creation of Ziggy Stardust, such as Vince Taylor, the Legendary Stardust Cowboy, Kansai Yamamoto, Iggy Pop, and Lou Reed, David Bowie drew inspiration from various other sources throughout his career. A few other key creative inspirations for Bowie include: 1. Literature: Bowie was an avid reader and oftentimes incorporated themes and ideas from books he had read into his music. His love for books such as George Orwell's \\"1984\\" and Anthony Burgess' \\"A Clockwork Orange\\" influenced the direction of his work. \\"1984\\", in particular, was a significant influence on his 1974 album \\"Diamond Dogs.\\" 2. Mime and theater: Bowie studied mime and theater under the renowned Scottish dancer and mime artist Lindsay Kemp. The experience shaped his stage presence and performance style, as seen in his ability to use gestures, facial expressions, and body language to communicate emotions and tell stories during his performances. 3. Japanese Kabuki Theater and fashion: Bowie was also inspired by Japanese culture, specifically Kabuki Theater and fashion, which played a significant role in the creation of his androgynous image and eclectic style. He collaborated with Japanese fashion designer Kansai Yamamoto to create striking stage outfits, which further accentuated the theatricality of his performances. 4. Film and visual arts: Bowie was passionate about film and visual arts, drawing inspiration from the works of directors such as Stanley Kubrick and artists like Salvador Dalí. His love for cinema resulted in several film appearances, and he often incorporated elements of visual storytelling and filmic techniques in his music videos. 5. Electronic and experimental music: As an innovative musician, Bowie was always exploring new sounds and styles. His exposure to the electronic and experimental music of artists like Kraftwerk, Brian Eno, and Philip Glass heavily influenced his musical direction, particularly on albums such as \\"Low\\" and \\"Heroes.\\" 6. Astronomy and science fiction: Bowie had a lifelong interest in space and science fiction. His 1969 single \\"Space Oddity\\" and 1976 album \\"Station to Station\\" both reflect themes of outer space, while his acting role in the 1976 film \\"The Man Who Fell to Earth\\" further solidified his connection to sci-fi concepts. In summary, David Bowie's creative inspirations were diverse and evolved throughout his career. His fascination with literature, theater, film, fashion, electronic music, and science fiction allowed him to experiment with various artistic mediums and continuously reinvent his image and music. This rich tapestry of inspirations contributed to Bowie's status as a unique and influential artist in the world of popular music."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Me thinks he (the lady) doth protest too much. The whole thing sounded to me as if the author was trying to convince himself! He sites profane literature (writings from the same time period but not connected with the bible) a number of times however I can think of at least three references off the top of my head which lend historical accuracy to events contained in the bible. Anyone can skew data & prove anything they like but it doesn't make it true. Customs change, word definitions change over time (look at English & German where it is very obviously a common root) nothing stays the same, it's always growing and changing. The bible has many different translations but the King James version is the one I've found to be the best when it comes to any kind of research. In the King James version you will notice there are certain words written in italics. These words have been added by the translators and can be dropped & the mean of the entire verse changes. Writings from around the time of Christ were written without spaces, without punctuation, without paragraphs & without numeric verses. These writings look like one long word & the translators added all of the above. For example how would you read this: GODISNOWHERE do you read it as God is nowhere or do you read it as God is now here? Same string of letters two entirely different meanings. This is why many biblical researchers use a 'Lexicon' to assist them in translation as it provides a word for word translation from the original Arabic, Greek or Hebrew depending on the language in which the scripture was originally written. It's also interesting to note that when translated into symbolic logic you can prove God exists but you can not prove He doesn't exist!

It is obvious that they have been chatting and they make a plan to meet at a local coffee shop that day at 11am. At the coffee shop (called Nighthawks after the famous painting by Ed Hopper) we meet Thonggirrrrl14, Haley Stark (Ellen Page) who is eating a piece of chocolate cake. Jeff Kohlver (Patrick Wilson) walks up to her. She turns and sheepishly smiles and asks, Jeff? She has chocolate on her lips and tells him it is amazing and he has to try it. He wipes the chocolate off her lips and sucks on his thumb. She tells him that he does not seem like the kind of guy that needs to meet girls on the internet (since he is clearly good looking). He says that he prefers it that way because he gets to meet the person first and that as a photographer, he has found that faces lie. She asks if her face lies. He studies her faces and says she is longing, wanting, needing . . . more chocolate. She laughs and a rapport is established between the two. She turns back to the counter and orders more chocolate and coffee and he pays for it. He also buys her a Nighthawks T-shirt. She models the shirt for him.

Information:  - Charles Bulfinch (August 8, 1763  April 15, 1844) was an early American architect, and has been regarded by many as the first native-born American to practice architecture as a profession.  - Tremont Street is a major thoroughfare in Boston, Massachusetts.  - Federal-style architecture is the name for the classicizing architecture built in the newly founded United States between c. 1780 and 1830, and particularly from 1785 to 1815. This style shares its name with its era, the Federal Period. The name Federal style is also used in association with furniture design in the United States of the same time period. The style broadly corresponds to the classicism of Biedermeier style in the German-speaking lands, Regency architecture in Britain and to the French Empire style.  - The Massachusetts General Court (formally styled the General Court of Massachusetts) is the state legislature of the Commonwealth of Massachusetts. The name \\"General Court\\" is a hold-over from the earliest days of the Massachusetts Bay Colony, when the colonial assembly, in addition to making laws, sat as a judicial court of appeals. Before the adoption of the state constitution in 1780, it was called the Great and General Court, but the official title was shortened by John Adams, author of the state constitution. It is a bicameral body. The upper house is the Massachusetts Senate which is composed of 40 members. The lower body, the Massachusetts House of Representatives, has 160 members.

It is considered a masterpiece of Federal architecture and among Bulfinch's finest works, and was designated a National Historic Landmark for its architectural significance.  - Massachusetts ; officially the Commonwealth of Massachusetts, is the most populous state in the New England region of the northeastern United States. It is bordered by the Atlantic Ocean to the east, the states of Connecticut and Rhode Island to the south, New Hampshire and Vermont to the north, and New York to the west. The state is named for the Massachusett tribe, which once inhabited the area. The capital of Massachusetts and the most populous city in New England is Boston. Over 80% of Massachusetts' population lives in the Greater Boston metropolitan area, a region influential upon American history, academia, and industry. Originally dependent on agriculture, fishing and trade, Massachusetts was transformed into a manufacturing center during the Industrial Revolution. During the 20th century, Massachusetts' economy shifted from manufacturing to services. Modern Massachusetts is a global leader in biotechnology, engineering, higher education, finance, and maritime trade.  - Park Street is a small but historic road in the center of Boston , Massachusetts .

Choose 1 that will look good with your pillow’s fabric.  For example, you could use a black braided trim with a green jacquard fabric. Since braids are more intricate trims, you may not want to use it with detailed print fabrics. For example, a braided trim might be too much for a pillow with a picture of a landscape on it. You can add a fringe trim to give your pillow some dimension and make it look more luxurious. Fringe comes in different types as well, including flat fringe, tasseled fringe, and pom pom fringe. Choose fringe in a color that will compliment your pillow’s fabric. For example, if your pillow has a pink floral print with a teal background, then opt for a teal fringe to make the background color pop. If you are just looking for something to add a pop of color, go with a bias tape or ribbon trim. You can choose a solid color of ribbon or bias tape, or something with a print. Choose a ribbon or bias tape that is about 1 to 3 inches (2.5 to 7.6 cm) wide depending on how wide you want the trim to be.  Make sure the ribbon or bias tape is a color that will compliment your pillow, such as a light pink ribbon for a white pillow or black ribbon for a leopard print pillow. Look for ribbons in different textures, such as satin, mesh, and lace. Adding a textured ribbon around the edges of a pillow can make a basic, solid color or print pillow into something special and romantic. Rick rack is a wavy trim that is similar to ribbon and it can make your pillow look like it was crafted in the 60’s or 70’s. However, rick rack will not wrap around the edges of your pillow because of the waves. Instead, you can sew the rick rack onto the edges of the pillow on 1 or both sides. Choose a rick rack color that will make your pillow fabric pop. Such as a hot pink rick rack for a lime green pillow, or white rick rack with a red print fabric.

A greeting and thanks.\\" Here's my reasoning: 1. \\"I\\" is always capitalized because it is a pronoun referring to oneself. 2. The first word of each sentence is always capitalized. Hence, \\"I\\" in \\"I hope that you can help me,\\" and \\"A\\" in \\"A greeting and thanks\\" are capitalized. 3. \\"Facebook\\" is a proper noun which refers to a specific brand or company, it should be always capitalized. 4. \\"Raspberry Pi\\" is the name of a specific product, hence it should be capitalized. 5. 'A greeting and thanks' is a separate sentence (as inferred from the context), so 'A' is capitalized. 6.

Please answer the following question: Information:  - The Army Board is the top single-service management committee of the British Army, and has always been staffed by senior politicians and soldiers. Until 1964 it was known as the Army Council.  - Colonel-in-Chief is a ceremonial position in a military regiment. It is in common use in several Commonwealth armies, where it is held by the regiment's patron, usually a member of the royal family. The position was formerly used in the armies of several European monarchies. A Colonel-in-Chief has a purely ceremonial role in their regiment.  - Lieutenant General James Hamilton , 4th Duke of Hamilton and 1st Duke of Brandon KG KT ( 11 April 1658 -- 15 November 1712 ) was a Scottish nobleman , the Premier Peer of Scotland and Keeper of the Palace of Holyroodhouse . He was a Master of the Great Wardrobe , Master - General of the Ordnance , Ambassador , and Colonel - in - Chief of his regiment . Hamilton was a major investor in the failed Darien Scheme , which cost many of Scotland 's ruling class their fortunes , and he played a leading role in the events leading up to the Act of Union in 1707 . He died on 15 November 1712 as the result of a duel in Hyde Park , Westminster , with Charles Mohun , 4th Baron Mohun , over a disputed inheritance .  - Artillery is a class of large military weapons built to fire munitions far beyond the range and power of infantry's small arms. Early artillery development focused on the ability to breach fortifications, and led to heavy, fairly immobile siege engines. As technology improved, lighter, more mobile field artillery developed for battlefield use. This development continues today; modern self-propelled artillery vehicles are highly mobile weapons of great versatility providing the largest share of an army's total firepower.  - A regiment is a military unit. Their role and size varies markedly, depending on the country and the arm of service.  - The Master-General of the Ordnance (MGO) was a very senior British military position, usually held by a serving general. The Master-General of the Ordnance was responsible for all British artillery, engineers, fortifications, military supplies, transport, field hospitals and much else, and was not subordinate to the commander-in chief of the British military.

If LSC developed and distributed the document to the public for comment, can we conclude that \\"The LSC cares about the comments of the public.\\"?","output":"While it is generally reasonable to assume that the Legal Services Corporation (LSC) distributing a document to the public for comment indicates that they care about the feedback and opinions of the public, it is essential to analyze various factors and contexts before arriving at this conclusion. The LSC is an independent nonprofit organization that provides financial support to civil legal aid programs across the United States, so its actions are often driven by interest in promoting access to justice for low-income Americans. By distributing a document to the public and seeking comments, LSC might demonstrate a commitment to transparency, inclusion, and responsiveness to the legal needs of the community. However, to conclude that \\"The LSC cares about the comments of the public,\\" we must consider the following aspects: 1. Purpose of the Document: What is the content of the document distributed by LSC? Is it a proposal for new regulations, a new strategic plan, or a report that evaluates the organization's impact on providing legal aid? The purpose and content of the document will determine the extent to which LSC is genuinely interested in public feedback and how the feedback might influence decision-making processes. 2. Scope for Public Influence: Does the document highlight tangible ways that public comments might lead to changes in LSC's actions or policies? Are there any specific questions or aspects LSC requested feedback on? If so, it indicates that LSC is interested in incorporating public perspectives into their decision-making processes. 3. Channels for Receiving Comments: Did LSC create accessible and convenient channels (e.g., online submission portals, in-person meetings, or virtual consultations) for the public to provide their feedback? The ease with which the public can share their opinions reflects the genuine interest LSC may have in considering those perspectives. 4. Responsiveness to Public Feedback: What measures does LSC take to engage with the public and provide feedback on their comments? For example, does LSC plan to release a summary of the comments received and discuss how they plan to address the issues raised? Responsiveness to public comments affirms that LSC values the public's input and is committed to incorporating it into their work or decision-making. 5. Past Precedence: Has LSC historically shown that they have taken public feedback seriously and amended or adjusted their policies or strategies accordingly? Past behavior may serve as an indicator of the extent to which LSC genuinely cares about public input. In conclusion, while distributing a document to the public for comment could be a sign that LSC cares about the comments of the public, it is important to consider various contextual factors before reaching this conclusion. The purpose of the document, LSC's avenues for soliciting public input, and their responsiveness to the feedback that they receive are all key aspects in determining the true level of their commitment to incorporating public comments into their decision-making processes."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Hamilton argued that the natural faculties of blacks were as good as those of free whites, and he warned that the British would arm the slaves if the patriots did not. In his 21st-century biography, Chernow cites this incident as evidence that Hamilton and Laurens saw the Revolution and the struggle against slavery as inseparable. Hamilton attacked his political opponents as demanding freedom for themselves and refusing to allow it to blacks. In January 1785, Hamilton attended the second meeting of the New York Manumission Society (NYMS). John Jay was president and Hamilton was the first secretary and later became president. Chernow notes how the membership soon included many of Hamilton's friends and associates. Hamilton was a member of the committee of the society that petitioned the legislature to end the slave trade, and that succeeded in passing legislation banning the export of slaves from New York. In the same period, Hamilton felt bound by the rule of law of the time and his law practice facilitated the return of a fugitive slave to Henry Laurens of South Carolina. He opposed the compromise at the 1787 Constitutional Convention by which the federal government could not abolish the slave trade for 20 years, and was disappointed when he lost that argument. Hamilton never supported forced emigration for freed slaves. Horton has argued from this that he would be comfortable with a multiracial society, and that this distinguished him from his contemporaries. In international affairs, he supported Toussaint L'Ouverture's black government in Haiti after the revolt that overthrew French control, as he had supported aid to the slaveowners in 1791--both measures hurt France. Scant evidence has been interpreted by a few to indicate Hamilton may have owned household slaves, as did many wealthy New Yorkers (the evidence for this is indirect; McDonald interprets it as referring to paid employees).  Question: \\"Hamilton was a strong proponent of free rights for black people.\\" Answer: \\"True\\" Is this answer to the question correct?","output":"Yes, the answer to the question is correct. Alexander Hamilton was indeed a strong proponent of free rights for black people. This is evidenced by his involvement with the New York Manumission Society and his advocacy for the abolition of the slave trade in New York, as well as his support for Hamilton and Laurens, who saw the American Revolution and the struggle against slavery as inseparable. Moreover, he expressed support for Toussaint L'Ouverture's black government in Haiti after their revolt against French control. Though there may be debate over whether Hamilton himself owned household slaves, his actions and beliefs indicate a clear support for the rights and freedom of black people."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Q:how is Somali National Alliance and Battle of Mogadishu related? A:","output":"To understand the relation between the Somali National Alliance and the Battle of Mogadishu, let me first provide some background information on both of these terms. Step 1: Define the terms - Somali National Alliance (SNA): The Somali National Alliance was a political and military alliance of various Somali factions that was founded in 1992. It was led by Mohamed Farrah Aidid, who was a prominent warlord during the Somali Civil War. - Battle of Mogadishu (1993): The Battle of Mogadishu was a military conflict that took place in Mogadishu, Somalia, on October 3 and 4, 1993, as a part of the United States' Operation Restore Hope. The objective of the mission was to capture a key Aidid ally, but it turned into a deadly firefight between U.S. forces, United Nations peacekeepers, and Somali militiamen. Step 2: Establish the connection The Somali National Alliance, being a prominent faction in Somalia, played a significant role in the Somali Civil War and was one of the many factions that aimed to control the country. When the United States intervened to provide humanitarian aid and restore peace in the region, they saw Mohamed Farrah Aidid as a major obstacle to these efforts. Step 3: Analyze the role of the SNA in the Battle of Mogadishu The SNA was led by Mohamed Farrah Aidid, who was the primary target of the United States during Operation Restore Hope. The Battle of Mogadishu was essentially a military operation intending to capture Aidid's ally. However, the United States forces encountered unexpected and fierce resistance from Aidid's SNA militia during the operation. Step 4: Conclusion In summary, the Somali National Alliance and the Battle of Mogadishu are related, as the SNA, led by Mohamed Farrah Aidid, was one of the main factions engaging in combat against U.S. forces during the battle. The SNA played a crucial role in the resistance and escalation of the conflict, which ultimately resulted in significant casualties for both sides and influenced future U.S. foreign policy in the region."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Fifteen years later, Sharaman's brother Nizam receives proof that the holy city of Alamut is supplying weapons to Persian enemies, and the princes â Dastan, along with the king's biological sons Tus and Garsiv â are sent to siege and take over Alamut. Dastan and his friends breach into the city on their own, and open a gate letting the Persians in. During the attack, Dastan fights a guard for Alamut's royal family and takes from him a special dagger. Alamut falls to the Persians, but princess Tamina denies the town having any weapon forges. Tus asks her to marry him to unite the two nations, and she only accepts after seeing the dagger in Dastan's possession. During the celebration, Dastan is fooled into presenting a poisoned gown seemingly given to him by Tus to King Sharaman, which fatally burns the king. Garsiv accuses Dastan of being the murderer, and the prince is forced to escape, carrying Tamina along. Tus is appointed king and orders a manhunt on Dastan. While in hiding, Tamina attempts to kill Dastan, and in the struggle the prince discovers the dagger enables its wielder to travel back in time. Dastan then believes that Tus invaded Alamut for the dagger, and decides to confront his brother at the funeral of the king in Avrat. On the way, the two are captured by merchant-bandits led by Sheik Amar, who recognized and attempted to take him back to Persia for the reward money, but they manage to escape. After arriving in Avrat, Dastan tries to convince his uncle Nizam that he was not the cause of his father's death, only to discover the dagger was taken by Tamina. Instead, he notices the burns on Nizam's hands, which indicate he was the one who set up the murder of the King.

In one sentence, describe what the following article is about: The only way to keep a male dog calm is to keep him far away from a female dog in heat, as he will not be able to control his reactions to her. Put the male dog indoors or in a kennel if a female dog in heat is going to be close by outdoors, as this can help to prevent him from smelling her scent. Do not let the male dog go for walks with a female dog in heat or play with her. If the two dogs live in the same household, place as much distance as you can between the male and the female, as the male can smell and sense the female. Shut both dogs in separate rooms as far from each other as you can manage in your home. Keep the door shut and try not to let either dog out at the same time so they are not around each other. Make sure there are no toys or items in the male’s room that belong to the female, as they will contain the female’s scent. Smelling the item can then cause the male dog to whine, moan, and scratch at the door. If you do not have many available rooms or are tight on space, you can keep the female dog indoors in one room and have the male dog live outside until the female’s heat is over. Make sure the outdoor area has a fence that will keep the male dog from venturing out of your yard.  This is only an option if the weather outside is favorable and there are no local laws or ordinances in your area that prevent keeping dogs outside. Do not keep the female dog outdoors while she is in heat, as she may try to escape to find a mate. She may also attract male dogs in the area with her scent. Though you can try your best to keep the dogs separate at home, you may not be able to control the male dog’s aggressive behavior towards the female. If this is the case, its best to board the male at an offsite location like a kennel. Keep the dog in the kennel for the female’s entire heat, which can last around 3 weeks. You may prepare the male dog for boarding in a kennel by having him stay in the kennel for short visits to get used to the environment. You can then pre-book the kennel for the male dog so he can stay there while the female is in heat.

It requests a single answer, either \\"Trump\\" or \\"Clinton.\\" The second question, \\"Who will win the election?

One of those features is the ability to split cell content into multiple cells. This might be particularly useful when data is imported from external sources, such as a text file or a database, and the information in one cell needs to be separated and placed into different cells. In this article, we will discuss the step-by-step process to split up a cell's content into multiple cells in Excel using the Text to Columns feature. Step 1: Select the cell(s) you wish to split up Begin by opening the Excel file and locating the specific cell or cells containing the data you want to split. You may select an individual cell or multiple cells by clicking on them, or you can select an entire column by clicking on the column header. Note that if selecting an entire column, the splitting process will apply to all non-empty cells in that column. Step 2: Click 'Data' Navigate to the toolbar at the top of the Excel window and click on the 'Data' tab. This tab contains options to manage and process your data, including sorting, filtering, and the Text to Columns feature. Step 3: Select 'Text to Columns' In the Data tab, locate the 'Text to Columns' option and click on it. This will open the 'Convert Text to Columns Wizard,' which will guide you in splitting your selected cell(s) into multiple cells. Step 4: Select 'Fixed Width' Once the Convert Text to Columns Wizard appears, you will be asked to select a data type. Choose the 'Fixed Width' option if you wish to define the width of the new columns you are creating by determining where the data in the original cell should be split. Alternatively, you may choose the 'Delimited' option if the data in the cell is separated by a consistent character, such as a comma or a tab. For this tutorial, we will proceed with 'Fixed Width.' Step 5: Click 'Next' After selecting 'Fixed Width,' click on the 'Next' button found at the bottom right of the Convert Text to Columns Wizard. This will take you to Step 2 of 3. Step 6: Define column breaks Using your cursor, click within the Data preview section of the wizard where you wish to create a new column break. The split will occur exactly at the position where you click. You may also adjust or remove column breaks by dragging them or double-clicking on them, respectively. Once you have set all necessary breaks, click on the 'Next' button to proceed to Step 3 of 3. Step 7: Format the new columns (optional) In Step 3 of the Convert Text to Columns Wizard, you have the option to format the data in each newly created column. You may apply various formats such as text, date, or number. However, this step is optional. If you do not wish to format the data, simply click on the 'Finish' button. Step 8: Click 'Finish' Once you have completed all steps in the Convert Text to Columns Wizard and are satisfied with the column breaks and formatting, click on the 'Finish' button. Excel will then split the original cell(s) into separate cells according to the column breaks and formatting that you have defined. Conclusion Splitting cells using the Text to Columns feature in Excel is an indispensable tool for arranging and presenting data imported from external sources. By following these simple steps provided in this article, you can easily convert cell content into multiple cells and increase your data management efficiency."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Context: Coming off their win over the Seahawks, the Panthers stayed at home for a Week 16 Saturday night duel with the playoff-bound Dallas Cowboys in an attempt to keep their slim playoff hopes alive. In the first quarter, Carolina trailed early as Cowboys QB Tony Romo completed a 10-yard TD pass to WR Terrell Owens for the only score of the period. In the second quarter, Dallas increased its lead with RB Marion Barber getting a 5-yard TD run. The Panthers got on the board with Matt Moore completing an 11-yard TD pass to WR Steve Smith. The Cowboys ended the half with kicker Nick Folk getting a 42-yard field goal. In the third quarter, Carolina began rallying with John Kasay getting a 37-yard field goal for the only score of the period. In the fourth quarter, Dallas responded with Folk kicking a 23-yard field goal. The Panthers tried to come back as Kasay nailed a 25-yard field goal, but the Cowboys' defense held on for the win. With the loss, not only did Carolina fall to 6-9, but it also eliminated them from the playoff race. Question: How many total field goal yards did Nick Folk kick?

However, it does not shed light on Gladstone's political views, which is what the question specifically asks. To answer the question about Gladstone's political views, we can look at his long political career which spanned over six decades. William Ewart Gladstone served as the Prime Minister of the United Kingdom four times and he was a member of the Liberal Party. Gladstone's political views were marked by his unwavering commitment to the principles of classical liberalism. He was an advocate of free markets, religious tolerance, and self-government, among other things. He also believed in the potential of people to improve and progress and therefore promoted various social reforms aimed at improving conditions for the working classes and expanding individual freedoms. He encapsulated his political philosophy in the concept of ‘Liberalism’, which meant less government intervention and more self-governance. Gladstone’s political career was characterized by his efforts to reform the British government and society. Among his many achievements were the Education Act of 1870, which established a system of elementary schools in England and Wales, and the Irish Land Act of 1870, which sought to address the pressing and contentious issue of land tenure in Ireland.  Gladstone also pursued policies of fiscal prudence and was an advocate for free trade. These were reflective of his political belief in minimal government interference in the economy. As Chancellor of the Exchequer, he significantly reduced public spending and brought about substantial tax reforms. Moreover, Gladstone's foreign policy stance was characterized by his advocacy for peace, diplomacy, and arbitration over war and conflict. He strongly opposed imperialism and frequently criticized policies that promoted the expansion of the British Empire at the expense of other nations' sovereignty. In summary, William Ewart Gladstone was a champion of classical liberalism with a focus on individual freedoms, primacy of conscience, fiscal rectitude, free trade, and diplomatic interaction with other nations. However, his specific emphasis on certain issues or principles may have varied depending on the specific context and demands of the time during his long political career. His views evolved over time, reflecting his responses to the political, social, and economic challenges of his era."},{"instruction":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

Alaric Bonthron, head of anti-corruption at the Metropolitan Police, said trying to stop criminals infiltrating the ranks was a very difficult challenge. ‘There is a threat to any law enforcement agency,’ said the detective chief superintendent. Challenge: Alaric Bonthron, head of Scotland Yard's anti-corruption unit, said corruption will always exist. ‘You will never eliminate corruption. You can make it very difficult and put systems in place. Organised crime by its very nature is very challenging. ‘Has corruption gone away entirely? I don’t think it has, you have always got vulnerabilities. ‘Part of our role is to make sure the organisation is absolutely doing the best it can to be corruption-proof.’ Mr Bonthron, who took charge of the Metropolitan Police’s Professional Standards Unit nine months ago, said 99 per cent of officers are ‘honest, law-abiding individuals’. Previously the work of the PSU has been shrouded in secrecy due to the nature of its work. But in a frank interview, Mr Bonthron told The Independent newspaper: ‘One officer, one member of staff, headline news … and it discredits the organisation.’ Temptation: Sir Hugh Orde, president of the Association of Chief Police Officers, sparked outrage among some MPs last week when he said poorly-paid junior officers were more susceptible to bribes to make ends meet. The officer, who has worked in the police in London for 29 years, denied that the Met was rife with ‘endemic corruption’, as has been claimed was the case in the Eighties and Nineties when some of Britain’s most notorious criminals were allegedly able to gain influence and information to compromise investigations. He said the Met’s Directorate of Professional Standards has 385 staff, spending £24 million every year. Sir Hugh Orde, one of Britain’s top officers, warned recently that police are more likely to take bribes if they are underpaid and have money problems. Sir Hugh pointed to the £19,000 starting salary for junior PCs and said that financial pressure felt by ‘certain ranks’ could fuel a wave of corruption. Here is a summary of the highlights for this article:","output":"Police corruption is an unfortunate reality that cannot be entirely eradicated, as admitted by Alaric Bonthron, head of anti-corruption at Scotland Yard. Organized crime has the ability to infiltrate police ranks, posing a significant challenge to law enforcement agencies. Although it is impossible to eliminate corruption completely, law enforcement organizations can implement policies and procedures that make it increasingly difficult for corruption to take hold. Bonthron believes that 99% of officers are honest and law-abiding individuals. To tackle the issue of corruption effectively, it is vital to maintain transparency within the force and uphold the integrity of the organization. One corrupt individual can cast doubt on the entire force and undermine public trust. The Metropolitan Police’s Professional Standards Unit (PSU) works to ensure that corruption is minimized and, to the best of their ability, prevented. With a team of 385 staff members and a £24 million annual budget, the unit continuously reviews policies, investigates corruption allegations, and takes disciplinary action against those found guilty of misconduct. Sir Hugh Orde, president of the Association of Chief Police Officers, recently highlighted the issue of junior police officers being more susceptible to bribes due to their low starting salary of £19,000. Underpaid officers may experience significant financial pressure, which could lead to a willingness to engage in corrupt activities in order to make ends meet. To fortify the police force against corruption, several initiatives can be put into place. Firstly, it is essential to improve the recruitment and vetting process for potential officers. This could involve rigorous background checks, psychological evaluations, and ongoing monitoring of an officer's conduct throughout their career. Secondly, investing in robust training and education is crucial, not only in terms of technical skills but also in ethics and integrity. This will enable officers to recognize and resist attempts at corruption, while fostering a culture of honesty and professionalism within the force. Thirdly, setting up anonymous reporting channels such as whistleblower hotlines can be an effective way to empower officers to report corrupt behavior without fear of retaliation. This will also signal to the public that the force is committed to combating corruption. Lastly, providing adequate remuneration and addressing the financial difficulties faced by underpaid officers can potentially reduce their susceptibility to bribes. This could involve offering competitive salaries, as well as financial counseling services and support to officers experiencing financial hardship. In conclusion, whilst it is impossible to eliminate corruption completely, implementing stringent policies and practices can significantly reduce it within the police force. By focusing on recruitment, training, anonymous reporting channels, and addressing financial pressures faced by officers, law enforcement organizations can work towards becoming more resistant to corruption and maintaining public trust."},{"instruction":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

Possible answers: turn around and drive home, go pet her dog, save her husband from injury A:","output":"Skylar decided to drive home because she heard a voice in her head informing her that her husband was having a seizure. Her immediate course of action needed to address the potential danger her husband might be in. Seizures can have various causes and effects, but they typically involve a temporary disruption of brain activity leading to altered awareness, unconsciousness, or even convulsions, depending on the nature and severity of the incident. Skylar's husband could be at serious risk of injury or further complications if no one was around to assist him during the seizure. Her decision to drive home, as opposed to the other available options of turning around and driving aimlessly or petting her dog, directly addresses the situation at hand. By driving home, Skylar would be able to check if her husband was indeed having a seizure and provide the necessary assistance, should it be required. Upon reaching home, Skylar may need to assess the severity of her husband's condition and decide whether to call for medical help or administer first aid herself. In general, it is essential to ensure the individual experiencing the seizure is in a safe environment where they won't hurt themselves during the seizing episode. Additional support may include turning the person onto their side to prevent choking, offering reassurance once the seizure has stopped, and monitoring the person for any post-seizure symptoms or difficulties. Skylar's primary motivation in driving home is the concern for her husband's wellbeing and safety, as seizures can potentially result in severe injuries or complications if not attended to promptly. Her choice to act in this manner reflects her desires to protect, comfort, and care for her significant other during a time of crisis. By providing assistance as soon as possible, Skylar increases the chances of a positive outcome, reduces the potential for injury, and ensures her husband receives the necessary support and care in his time of need."},{"instruction":"You are a teacher.

Activities and events at Monte Ne continued, supported by locals who still visited in large numbers. Harvey sold the Hotel Monte Ne. The hotel went through several name changes and owners, becoming the White Hotel circa 1912, the Randola Inn in 1918, the Hotel Frances in 1925, and in 1930 the Sleepy Valley Hotel. Monte Ne's larger hotels continued to be active after they, along with the dance pavilion and Elixir Spring, were foreclosed and sold at public auction. From 1927 to 1932, Missouri Row and Oklahoma Row (often called the Club House Hotels at this point) were home to the Ozark Industrial College and School of Theology, a nonsectarian school run by Dan W. Evans. The hotels housed pupils—Missouri Row for boys, Oklahoma Row for girls—and Oklahoma Row also provided classroom and dining spaces. Evans and his family lived in the tower. The dance pavilion was enclosed and served as the school chapel. In May 1932, following a mortgage foreclosure against the school, school officials were evicted and the property was sold.After he announced the building of the Pyramid, at age 69, Harvey began suffering a series of serious health problems, but continued to work tirelessly. In 1926, blood poisoning in his foot put him in a coma that lasted several days resulting in surgery, and three months of recuperation. In 1929 he and Anna were finally divorced. Three days later Harvey married his long-time personal secretary May Leake. In 1930, he came down with double pneumonia.

He presented himself at the public clinic managed by Dr. Niide (Toshiro Mifune), aka Akahige (Red Beard- because of the color of his beard), thinking it was merely a courtesy call arranged by his father (who also a physician).To his surprise and displeasure, he found that out he was expected to work there for a while. Yasumoto didn't find anything to his liking. He found out that the doctors were expected to sacrifice sun (the patients needed the sunny rooms), heat (better for the soul), and tatami (Japanese comfortable bedding). Extremely upset & frustrated because he had hoped to find a prestigious post as a shogun's personal physician, Yasumoto rebelled by not doing what he was supposed to do and refusing to follow the rules. He would not wear the traditional clinic doctor's uniform, refused to eat, drank sake (though it was forbidden) and complained that the patients stank (which one of his colleague at the clinic called \\"the smell of poverty\\"). He reclined on the lawn in front of an isolated ward reserved for a murderous female mental patient (which he had been warned to avoid). In short, he believed he was too good for this under-funded public clinic-that the job and patients were beneath him.

They threatened to kill her if she ever denounced them and she kept quiet. Finally, after a few years, she had had enough of the sexual abuse and snapped-- killing three men (thus the name Mantis).

(Associated Press)      NEW YORK (AP) — Harvey Weinstein's lawyers are making a new attempt to get the New York sexual assault case against him dismissed.      The former Hollywood producer's attorneys say in a court filing Monday his indictment was \\"irreparably tainted by police misconduct,\\" among other problems.

A charge involving one woman was dismissed after prosecutors said a detective advised a witness to suppress doubts concerning whether that alleged encounter was consensual.      Then prosecutors said the same detective told another Weinstein accuser she could delete material from her cellphones before giving them to prosecutors. They say no information was deleted. ||||| Harvey Weinstein Asks Judge to Dismiss Case Entirely      Harvey Weinstein Asks Judge to Dismiss Rape Case Entirely      Exclusive Details      Harvey Weinstein's legal team is going for the kill amid a crumbling criminal case against their client -- now asking a judge to toss the remaining charges against HW.      Weinstein's lawyer, Ben Brafman, filed a new motion Monday in Weinstein's case asking a judge to dismiss all charges.      The linchpin ... calling into question the credibility of one of Weinstein's accusers, who alleges he forced her into oral sex.      Weinstein's lawyers argue that the woman in question, who's been ID'd as Mimi Haleyi, stayed in contact with Harvey 7 months after the alleged assault. In Weinstein's filing, obtained by TMZ, the lawyers say she sent texts to his phone -- one of which allegedly read ... \\"Hi! Just wondering if u have any news on whether harvey will have time to see me before he leaves? xMiriam.\\"      As we reported ... Mimi claims that Weinstein forcibly performed oral sex on her while she was on her period and, at one point, she says he took out her tampon. Mimi also claims that Weinstein said, \\"Don't you feel we are so much closer to each other now?\\"      Brafman argues in his motion that it's unclear in Mimi's case if there might be potential misconduct by the former lead detective, DiGuadio ... but goes on to say that because of his previous witness tampering, the entire case is tainted and should be tossed. ||||| Lawyers for disgraced movie mogul Harvey Weinstein asked a judge Monday to toss what remains of the criminal case against him — revealing for the first time that one of his accusers tried to meet with him soon after she claims he abused her.      Production assistant Mimi Haleyi alleged in a press conference last year that Weinstein forcibly performed oral sex on her in July 2006 in his Soho home.      According to the new motion, on Feb. 12, 2007, she allegedly texted Weinstein’s phone: “Hi! Just wondering if u have any news on whether harvey will have time to see me before he leaves? x Miriam.”      “This message makes clear that Mimi Haleyi wished to continue seeing Mr. Weinstein even after the alleged sexual assault,” attorney Ben Brafman wrote in the filing.      He blasts prosecutors for not presenting the friendly communication to the grand jury, and Haleyi’s attorney, Gloria Allred, for failing to vet her client’s story thoroughly.      “The defense motion is replete with unjustified speculation about my client,” Allred shot back.      The Haleyi text is the latest dent in the Manhattan District Attorney’s rapidly cracking sex abuse case against the former film industry giant.      A judge last month dismissed the felony count related to a third victim, Lucia Evans, over spiraling credibility worries, and the lead detective was booted off the case for alleged misconduct.      “The necessary consequences of these compounded defects is the dismissal of the entire indictment,” Brafman wrote in the papers.      Haleyi is one of two victims whose allegations are still propping up the indictment. The second victim, who hasn’t been publicly identified, alleges that Weinstein raped her in March 2013.      Evans, who was once considered the strongest part of the case, accused Weinstein of forcing her to perform oral sex on him in 2004 in his Tribeca office when she was a fledgling actress.      But prosecutors eventually uncovered an exculpatory email she wrote to her husband that suggested that the encounter was consensual.      Evans also allegedly told a pal that she wasn’t coerced but gave Weinstein oral sex in exchange for an acting job, according to prosecutor Joan Illuzzi-Orbon.      The friend said she reported this to lead detective Nicholas DiGaudio – but that he pressured her not to disclose the information.      DiGaudio was kicked off the case for the alleged misconduct.      A few weeks later, Illuzzi-Orbon disclosed that the same detective coached the second victim to “delete anything she did not want anyone to see” from her phone before turning it over to authorities.      DiGaudio has denied the allegations.      In the latest motion, Brafman argued that the entire case has been irreversibly contaminated by Evans’s alleged “false testimony” in the grand jury and DiGaudio’s improper behavior.      He also alleges that DiGaudio may have “committed additional misconduct” involving Haleyi.      He noted that all three accusers deleted their social media posts from the time period of their alleged assaults last year and suggested that DiGaudio may have been behind it.      Brafman called into question the credibility of the second victim, who had a “long-term, consensual” relationship with Weinstein, which continued after she alleges he raped her March 18, 2013, in a Manhattan hotel.      In an email sent nearly four years later, she allegedly wrote: “I love you, always do. But I hate feeling like a booty call :)”      He described the messages as “so unlike what one would expect to be communications between a true rape victim and her alleged rapist” that they were exculpatory and should have been provided to the grand jury.      The DA’s office declined to comment on the motion. They’re expected to respond with their own papers later this month. ||||| What is a one-paragraph summary of the above article?","output":"Harvey Weinstein's lawyers are seeking a dismissal of the sexual assault case against him, stating that the indictment is \\"irreparably tainted by police misconduct\\" among other problems. They are requesting either a dismissal or a hearing to investigate the extent of the alleged misconduct.

Answer: Although the wording of the Declaration was approved on July 4, the date of its signing was August 2. Question: when was the Declaration of Independence  Signed?","output":"Yes, although the wording of the United States Declaration of Independence was approved on July 4, 1776, the actual signing of the document took place on August 2, 1776. To give a more detailed answer, the United States Declaration of Independence was drafted by Thomas Jefferson and presented to the Continental Congress, which was the governing body during the American Revolution. The purpose of the Declaration was to assert the colonies' independence from the British Crown and to establish the 13 American colonies as a new nation: the United States of America. After the initial presentation of the draft, the Continental Congress debated, revised, and finally approved the text of the Declaration on July 4, 1776. This is why Americans celebrate Independence Day on July 4th. However, the actual signing of the Declaration did not occur on that day. John Hancock, the President of the Continental Congress, was the first to sign the document on July 4, but the rest of the 56 delegates started signing it on August 2, 1776. The signing process continued for several weeks as not all delegates were present on August 2. A few delegates signed the Declaration even later, and some (such as Thomas McKean) may not have signed it until 1777. Once signed, the Declaration of Independence was sent to a local printing shop owned by John Dunlap to produce broadsides, which were large posters designed for public display. These broadsides were distributed throughout the colonies to spread the news of independence, leading to public celebrations and readings. In summary, while the approval of the Declaration of Independence occurred on July 4, 1776, the actual signing of the document took place mainly on August 2, 1776. So, the answer to the question \\"When was the Declaration of Independence signed?\\" would be August 2, 1776, but it's important to note that the signing process continued for several weeks as not all delegates were present on that day."},{"instruction":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

That's called free speech, and it's really important so we can all learn from each other. Now, there are these really big groups called corporations, kind of like a big team of people working together. Some of these corporations are given something called \\"legal personhood.\\" That's a fancy way of saying they are treated kind of like regular people for certain rules and laws. This house, or group of people, wants to limit, or control, how much free speech these corporations can have. That's like telling them, \\"hey, you big group, you can't say whatever you want all the time because it might not be fair.\\" So, one possible side of this debate could be agreeing with limiting the free speech of these big corporations. People might argue that doing this could be good if it helps make things more fair and stops them from having too much power. On the other hand, some people might disagree, saying that all groups, including corporations, should have the freedom to speak their minds, just like regular people. They might argue that limiting the free speech of corporations could be harmful and not the best solution. Both sides have their reasons for their opinions, and it's important for people to think and talk about it to figure out what's best for everyone."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Grayson Perry has been sporting the 'Scrotal Sac' around London in recent months.

I took a deep breath and the process of making began. Detail: A bell, supplied by Grayson, was added to the end of the appendage, which Andy says he gave a 'ceremonial and celebratory jingle of completion' 'It took months to construct the bag. 'Firstly I had to carve a wooden former and then soak hand-dyed, bark-tanned calfskin in water so that it became malleable and could be moulded around the oaken testicles, a technique which is centuries old.

With the sporf, things would get messy trying to use the spoon and knife and the same time. The knife and fork work quite well in sequence but physics prevents me using both at the same time as I can with the older technologies of knife and fork.

Chinese literature has alyeady attracted international attention, but experts say translation remains a barrier. \\"Many very good Chinese writers have been accepted globally for a long time already.\\"says Michel Hockx, professor of University of London. \\" It's mainly because there are many more opportunities for Chinese writers to visit other countries, to publish their work outside China and to interact with readerships abroad. At the same time, more and more people globally are learning Chinese and taking an interest in Chinese language and Chinese culture.\\" Hockx adds: \\"We need more good translators, especially foreign translators, who know good Chinese and can translate the work into their own languages in a way that foreign readers will appreciate and understand.\\" London's independent literary agent Toby Eady, who represents many Chinese writers, including Yu Dan, met Mo about 15 years ago in China.

The translator has done a good job in translating Mo's work, but the variety of Chinese vocabulary doesn't well translate into English.\\" University of Oxford lecturer in medern Chinese literature Margaret Hillenbrand says:\\"The obvious reason for the growing global presence of Chinese literature is the growing global presence of China itself.

Question: \\"What were considered national property under Espartero?\\"  Context: \\"During the regency of Maria Cristina, Espartero ruled Spain for two years as its 18th Prime Minister from 16 September 1840 to 21 May 1841. Under his progressive government the old regime was tenuously reconciled to his liberal policies. During this period of upheaval in the provinces he declared that all the estates of the Church, its congregations, and its religious orders were national property—though in Valencia, most of this property was subsequently acquired by the local bourgeoisie. City life in Valencia carried on in a revolutionary climate, with frequent clashes between liberals and republicans, and the constant threat of reprisals by the Carlist troops of General Cabrera.\\"  Answer: The answer to this question is:","output":"Under the rule of General Espartero during his tenure as Spain's 18th Prime Minister, various properties were considered national property. His progressive government led to a reconciliation between the old regime and liberal policies, which had an impact on the management and categorization of properties and assets in the country. During Espartero's rule, the properties that were considered national property primarily belonged to the Church, its congregations, and its religious orders. As part of his progressive policies, Espartero declared that all these estates were henceforth to be recognized as Spain's national property. This significant decision had several implications for the Church, as it led to changes in the way their assets were managed and controlled. Espartero's declaration was not limited to the land and buildings owned by the Church and religious institutions. It also extended to the assets that were being managed by these entities, which included various investments, pilgrimage sites, and other properties that generated revenue for the Church. This move by Espartero aimed to weaken the economic influence of the Catholic Church, as well as promote the separation between Church and State. It also facilitated the redistribution of wealth and resources among different sectors of society. By declaring Church properties as national property, the government could manage and control these assets to the benefit of the Spanish people, instead of exclusively supporting the religious institutions. In the context of the city of Valencia, an interesting development took place following the declaration. The majority of national property in Valencia—formerly owned by the Church and religious institutions—was eventually acquired by the local bourgeoisie. This acquisition led to a change in the management of these properties and a shift in the balance of power in the city. While Espartero's decree of making Church properties national property had profound implications for Spain during his tenure, it also contributed to tensions between liberals and republicans in various regions, especially as it generated conflict between those who supported the separation of Church and State and those who favored a more conservative approach to the country's governance. For instance, the progressive policies faced resistance from Carlist troops led by General Cabrera, who threatened to retaliate against the liberal and republican factions. In conclusion, under Espartero's rule as Spain's Prime Minister, the properties considered to be national property were those belonging to the Church, its congregations, and religious orders. This decision aimed to diminish the Church's economic influence and promote the separation of Church and State, but it also stirred existing tensions between liberals and republicans and contributed to an atmosphere of revolutionary climate in several parts of the country, including Valencia."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Context: SEOUL — South Korea is looking into developing and financing economic projects with North Korea that could take effect if a nuclear deal is reached with the United States. South Korean Finance Minister Kim Dong-yeon said on Wednesday the government was “internally carrying out preparations” to organize, finance and implement possible inter-Korea projects. But he also emphasized that Seoul would first seek support from the international community for any North Korean development projects, and would only proceed if the U.S. -North Korea summit, expected to be held in late May or June, produces a joint denuclearization agreement. North Korea is under tough sanctions imposed by the U.N. Security Council for its nuclear weapons and missiles tests, including accelerated efforts in the last two years to develop a long-range nuclear missile that could potentially target the U.S. mainland. The international sanctions ban an estimated 90 percent of the country’s external trade. Seeking sanctions relief is considered a key motivating factor in North Korean leader Kim Jong Un’s diplomatic pivot this year to suspend further provocative missile and nuclear tests, and to engage in talks to dismantle his nuclear arsenal. But easing sanctions would make it more difficult to enforce the North’s denuclearization promises. “Once the sanctions are lifted, North Korea will gain autonomy over its trade, and considering its low labor costs and skilled workforce, I think the North Korean economy would gain power again,” said Shin Beom-chul, the director of Center for Security and Unification at the Asan Institute for Policy Studies in Seoul. U.S. President Donald Trump has insisted he will keep sanctions in place until North Korea completely dismantles its nuclear program. South Korea, however, is considering a range of economic incentives to encourage Kim to follow through on a nuclear deal with Trump.

Write the answer: An 18th Century dandy and a type of pasta share which name?","output":"The name that an 18th Century dandy and a type of pasta share is \\"Macaroni.\\" Allow me to provide you with a detailed explanation of both terms and their origins. Macaroni as an 18th Century Dandy: In the 18th Century, particularly in Great Britain, the term \\"Macaroni\\" was used to describe a fashionable and flamboyant man who paid great attention to his appearance and clothing. These men were members of the \\"Macaroni Club,\\" a social group consisting of young, well-traveled men, usually from upper-class families. The Macaroni Club and its members acquired the name due to their preference for the exotic Italian cuisine known as \\"macaroni.\\" At the time, few people in Britain were familiar with pasta, and its consumption was viewed as a mark of sophistication and worldliness. Macaroni dandies were known for their exaggerated fashion choices. They would typically wear bright colors, intricately-patterned fabrics, and outrageous wigs, which could reach up to several feet high. Their clothing was a reflection of their wealth, status, and desire for attention. Additionally, these dandies often held themselves with an air of deft nonchalance, interacting with others in a manner that may have been considered haughty or aloof. The term \\"Macaroni\\" gained widespread recognition with the popular 18th-century British song, \\"Yankee Doodle,\\" in which the lyrics include the line, \\"Stuck a feather in his cap and called it Macaroni.\\" The song pokes fun at the supposed naivety and unsophistication of American soldiers during the time, insinuating that they believed attaching a simple feather to their cap was enough to emulate the extravagant style and status of a Macaroni dandy. Macaroni as a Type of Pasta: Macaroni is a type of Italian pasta that features a tube-like shape, often with a slight curvature. Traditionally, macaroni is made with durum wheat semolina, which gives the pasta its firm, chewy texture and sturdy structure. Macaroni is considered an extruded pasta variety, as the dough is forced through a die to create its characteristic shape. Macaroni is versatile and can be prepared in various ways to suit different dishes. It is commonly used in baked pasta dishes, such as macaroni and cheese or macaroni casserole, and can also be tossed with sauces, vegetables, or meats to create an array of cold and hot pasta dishes. One well-known macaroni dish is the classic \\"macaroni and cheese,\\" which is often prepared with a creamy cheese sauce and baked until bubbly and golden. In conclusion, the name \\"Macaroni\\" has a dual identity, linking it to both an 18th Century dandy and a type of pasta. While seemingly unrelated, the shared name is a fascinating linguistic connection that sheds light on the cultural and historical context of each term. Both the flamboyant 18th Century dandy and the versatile pasta dish originated in vastly different contexts, they are united by a curious linguistic coincidence that transcends time and place."},{"instruction":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

Q:Found the following article online, use it to answer the question: What was replaced by a small settlement of mudbrick houses south of the monument from where cult priests could conduct their daily activities??  The Pyramid of Neferirkare (in ancient Egyptian the Ba of Neferirkare) was built for the Fifth Dynasty pharaoh Neferirkare Kakai – referred to as Neferirkare – in the 25th century BC. It was the tallest structure located on the highest site at the necropolis of Abusir – found between Giza and Saqqara – and still towers over the necropolis today. The pyramid is also significant because its evacuation led to the discovery of the Abusir papyri. The Fifth Dynasty marked the end of the great pyramid constructions during the Old Kingdom. Pyramids of the era were smaller and becoming more standardized, though intricate relief decoration also proliferated. Neferirkare's pyramid deviated from convention as it was originally built as a step pyramid: a design that had been antiquated after the Third Dynasty (26th or 27th century BC). This was then encased in a second step pyramid with alterations intended to convert it into a true pyramid; however, the pharaoh's  death left the work to be completed by his successors. The remaining works were completed in haste, using cheaper building material. Because of the circumstances, Neferirkare's monument lacked several basic elements of a pyramid complex: a valley temple, a causeway, and a cult pyramid. Instead, these were replaced by a small settlement of mudbrick houses south of the monument from where cult priests could conduct their daily activities, rather than the usual pyramid town near the valley temple. The discovery of the Abusir papyri in the 1890s is owed to this. Normally, the papyrus archives would have been contained in the pyramid town where their destruction would have been assured. The pyramid became part of a greater family cemetery. The monuments to Neferirkare's consort, Khentkaus II; and his sons, Neferefre and Nyuserre Ini, are found in the surrounds. Though their construction began under different rulers, all four of these monuments were completed during the reign of Nyuserre. A:","output":"In the context of the Pyramid of Neferirkare, several basic elements of a pyramid complex were missing due to the pharaoh's death and the hasty completion of the structure, using cheaper building materials. Among those missing elements were a valley temple, a causeway, and a cult pyramid. These elements were replaced by a small settlement of mudbrick houses located to the south of the monument. This small settlement served as an area where cult priests could conduct their daily activities, in contrast to the traditional pyramid town that would typically be found near the valley temple. This unconventional placement of the settlement resulted in a fortunate discovery, as it led to the unearthing of the Abusir papyri in the 1890s. The papyrus archives would have most likely been destroyed if they were kept within a conventional pyramid town, but their preservation in the mudbrick settlement allowed for this significant find. The Pyramid of Neferirkare was part of a larger family cemetery containing monuments dedicated to Neferirkare's consort, Khentkaus II, and his sons, Neferefre and Nyuserre Ini. Although these structures were initiated under different rulers, all four monuments were ultimately completed during the reign of Nyuserre. The history and unique features of the Pyramid of Neferirkare demonstrate its significance within the context of ancient Egyptian architecture and the evolution of pyramid construction during the Old Kingdom era."},{"instruction":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

Peter Loew is a driven literary agent and an example of the stereotypical narcissistic and greedy yuppie of the 1980s: he works all day and club hops at night, with little in his life but alcohol, one night stands and the pursuit of money and prestige. However, he is slowly going insane and sees a therapist frequently; it is during these sessions that his declining mental health becomes clear through a series of increasingly bizarre rants which eventually begin to scare even the psychiatrist. After he takes home a girl he met in a club named Jackie, a bat flies in through his window, scaring them both. At his next session he mentions to his therapist that the struggle with the bat aroused him, and after visiting an art museum with Jackie the next day, he ditches her, and she leaves an angry message on his phone. Loew meets Rachel at a night club, and takes her home. She pins him down, reveals vampire fangs and feeds on him. He soon begins to believe that he is changing into a vampire. He stares into a bathroom mirror and fails to see his reflection, he wears dark sunglasses during the day, and, when his \\"fangs\\" fail to develop, he purchases a pair of cheap plastic vampire teeth. All the while, Rachel visits him nightly to feed on his blood. Shortly after, Loew experiences mood swings and calls Jackie back apologetically, asking to meet her at a bar. As he is about to leave, a jealous Rachel appears and beckons him back inside. A dejected Jackie eventually leaves the bar and leaves an angry note on his door asking him to leave her alone.

Breaking down the elements of the tweet, the author uses 'ugh' as an expression of frustration or dissatisfaction, suggesting that they view the upcoming appointment as a burden or hassle rather than a pleasant experience. The use of the elongated word 'check uppp' also provides a sense of exasperation and the feeling that it is being drawn out or taking longer than desired. Moreover, the tone suggests they may not be particularly looking forward to the experience, but they understand it's necessary. The author, by illustrating this perspective on a doctor's check-up through their language choice, suggests that they likely feel inconvenienced by needing to visit the doctor, either due to time constraints, fear, or other negative experiences they may have had during previous appointments. It is also possible that the sentiment of the tweet is a reflection of how the user perceives going to the doctor as a chore or an obligation they must attend to rather than an opportunity for them to proactively manage their health. While it is clear that the sentiment is negative, it is important to consider that the tweet could also be an attempt at humor or sarcasm, with the author expressing their feelings in a light-hearted manner, shared with their followers and friends on social media. As such, the overall sentiment may not be as serious or emotionally intense as it appears on the surface, but rather a moment of self-expression or bonding with others who share similar feelings about visits to the doctor. To sum up, the sentiment of this tweet embodies a general feeling of reluctance, annoyance, and sense of inconvenience related to going to the doctor for a check-up.

Question: Read the following paragraph and extract the answer for the question: What is the last name of the person who received an award from the Nobel Committee in 2016?  Dylan has been described as one of the most influential figures of the 20th century, musically and culturally. He was included in the Time 100: The Most Important People of the Century where he was called \\"master poet, caustic social critic and intrepid, guiding spirit of the counterculture generation\\". In 2008, the Pulitzer Prize jury awarded him a special citation for \\"his profound impact on popular music and American culture, marked by lyrical compositions of extraordinary poetic power.\\" President Barack Obama said of Dylan in 2012, \\"There is not a bigger giant in the history of American music.\\" For 20 years, academics lobbied the Swedish Academy to give Dylan the Nobel Prize in Literature. He received the award in 2016, making Dylan the first musician to be awarded the Literature Prize. Horace Engdahl, a member of the Nobel Committee, described Dylan's place in literary history: ...a singer worthy of a place beside the Greek bards, beside Ovid, beside the Romantic visionaries, beside the kings and queens of the blues, beside the forgotten masters of brilliant standards. Rolling Stone has ranked Dylan at number one in its 2015 list of the 100 Greatest Songwriters of All Time, and listed \\"Like A Rolling Stone\\" as the \\"Greatest Song of all Time\\" in their 2011 list.

Paul Simon suggested that Dylan's early compositions virtually took over the folk genre: \\"[Dylan's] early songs were very rich ... with strong melodies.

Information:  - Rock music is a genre of popular music that originated as \\"rock and roll\\" in the United States in the 1950s, and developed into a range of different styles in the 1960s and later, particularly in the United Kingdom and the United States. It has its roots in 1940s' and 1950s' rock and roll, itself heavily influenced by blues, rhythm and blues and country music. Rock music also drew strongly on a number of other genres such as electric blues and folk, and incorporated influences from jazz, classical and other musical sources.  - No Policy is the only studio release by the American hardcore punk band State of Alert, the first band to be fronted by Henry Rollins. It was released on 7-inch vinyl in March 1981 through Dischord Records (No. 2). Since Dischord was tied up in releasing Minor Threat's debut EP, the production of \\"No Policy\\" was funded entirely by Rollins.  - Dischord Records is a Washington, D.C.-based independent record label specializing in the independent punk rock music of the D.C.-area music scene. The label is co-owned by Ian MacKaye and Jeff Nelson, who founded Dischord in 1980 to release \\"Minor Disturbance\\" by The Teen Idles. Along with other independent American labels such as Twin/Tone, Touch and Go Records, and SST Records, Dischord helped to spearhead the nationwide network of underground bands that formed the pre-Nirvana indie-rock scene. These labels presided over the shift from the hardcore punk that then dominated the American underground scene to the more diverse styles of alternative rock that were emerging.  - Straight edge (sometimes abbreviated sXe or signified XXX or X) is a subculture of hardcore punk whose adherents refrain from using alcohol, tobacco and other recreational drugs, in reaction to the excesses of punk subculture. For some, this extends to refraining from engaging in promiscuous sex, following a vegetarian or vegan diet, and/or not using caffeine or prescription drugs. The term \\"straight edge\\" was adopted from the 1981 song \\"Straight Edge\\" by the hardcore punk band Minor Threat.  - AllMusic (previously known as All Music Guide or AMG) is an online music guide service website. It was launched in 1991 by All Media Guide which later became All Media Network.  - The Teen Idles were an American hardcore punk band formed in Washington, D.C. in September 1979. Consisting of teenagers Nathan Strejcek, Geordie Grindle, Ian MacKaye and Jeff Nelson, the Idles' recorded two demo sessions and the 1980 \\"Minor Disturbance\\" EP before they broke up in November 1980. The influential independent record label Dischord Records was originally created with the sole purpose of releasing the Teen Idles 7\\" record. They were an early landmark in the D.C. hardcore movement, and MacKaye and Nelson would later form the seminal punk outfit Minor Threat.  - Hardcore punk (often abbreviated to hardcore) is a punk rock music genre that originated in the late 1970s. It is generally faster, harder, and more aggressive than other forms of punk rock. Its roots can be traced to earlier punk scenes in San Francisco and Southern California which arose as a reaction against the still predominant hippie cultural climate of the time and was also inspired by New York punk rock and early proto-punk. New York punk had a harder-edged sound than its San Francisco counterpart, featuring anti-art expressions of masculine anger, energy and subversive humor. Hardcore punk generally disavows commercialism, the established music industry and \\"anything similar to the characteristics of mainstream rock\\" and often addresses social and political topics.  - State of Alert (often abbreviated to S.O.A.) was an American hardcore punk group formed in Washington, D.C. in October 1980, and disbanded in July 1981. The group was formed after the members' of previous group, The Extorts, lost its vocalist Lyle Preslar and hired Henry Rollins, then known by his birth name Henry Garfield.   - Punk rock (or simply \\"punk\\") is a rock music genre that developed in the early to mid 1970s in the United States, United Kingdom, and Australia. Rooted in 1960s garage rock and other forms of what is now known as \\"proto-punk\\" music, punk rock bands rejected perceived excesses of mainstream 1970s rock. Punk bands typically use short or fast-paced songs, with hard-edged melodies and singing styles, stripped-down instrumentation, and often political, anti-establishment lyrics. Punk embraces a DIY ethic; many bands self-produce recordings and distribute them through informal channels.  - An electric guitar is a fretted string instrument that uses a pickup to convert the vibration of its stringswhich are typically made of steel, and which occurs when a guitarist strums, plucks or fingerpicks the stringsinto electrical signals. The vibrations of the strings are sensed by a pickup, of which the most common type is the magnetic pickup, which uses the principle of direct electromagnetic induction. The signal generated by an electric guitar is too weak to drive a loudspeaker, so it is plugged into a guitar amplifier before being sent to a loudspeaker, which makes a sound loud enough to hear. The output of an electric guitar is an electric signal, and the signal can easily be altered by electronic circuits to add \\"color\\" to the sound or change the sound. Often the signal is modified using effects such as reverb and distortion and \\"overdrive\\", with the latter being a key element of the sound of the electric guitar as it is used in blues and rock music.  - Henry Rollins (born Henry Lawrence Garfield; February 13, 1961) is an American musician, actor, writer, television and radio host, and comedian. He hosts a weekly radio show on KCRW, and is a regular columnist for \\"LA Weekly\\" and \\"Rolling Stone Australia\\".  - The guitar is a musical instrument classified as a string instrument with anywhere from four to 18 strings, usually having six. The sound is projected either acoustically, using a hollow wooden or plastic and wood box (for an acoustic guitar), or through electrical amplifier and a speaker (for an electric guitar). It is typically played by strumming or plucking the strings with the fingers, thumb and/or fingernails of the right hand or with a pick while fretting (or pressing against the frets) the strings with the fingers of the left hand. The guitar is a type of chordophone, traditionally constructed from wood and strung with either gut, nylon or steel strings and distinguished from other chordophones by its construction and tuning. The modern guitar was preceded by the gittern, the vihuela, the four-course Renaissance guitar, and the five-course baroque guitar, all of which contributed to the development of the modern six-string instrument.  - String instruments, stringed instruments, or chordophones are musical instruments that produce sound from vibrating strings when the performer plays or sounds the strings in some manner.   - Minor Disturbance is the only studio release by the American hardcore punk band The Teen Idles. It was released in December 1980 through Dischord Records (No. 1). Comprising eight songs, \\"Minor Disturbance\\" referenced a number of issues pertinent to the band, from being turned away at local concerts due to their age (\\"Too Young to Rock\\") to what they felt was the increasing complacency of many first wave punk bands (\\"Fleeting Fury\\"). Upon its release, \\"Minor Disturbance\\", Dischord Records' first release, received positive reviews from local fanzines and gained airplay on local radio stations.  - SST Records is an American independent record label formed in 1978 in Long Beach, California by musician Greg Ginn. The company was initially formed in 1966 by Ginn at age 12, as Solid State Tuners, a small business through which he sold electronics equipment. Ginn repurposed the company as a record label to release material by his band Black Flag.  - Southern California, often abbreviated as SoCal, is a geographic and cultural region that generally comprises California's 10 southernmost counties. The region is traditionally described as eight counties, based on demographics and economic ties: Imperial, Los Angeles, Orange, Riverside, San Bernardino, San Diego, Santa Barbara, and Ventura. The more extensive 10-county definition, which includes Kern and San Luis Obispo counties, is also used based on historical political divisions.

Russia struggled to break down a dogged Moldovan defence until the 73rd minute, when Artyom Dzyuba earned and converted a penalty following a foul by Victor Golovatenco. Moldova responded within seconds of the restart as Epureanu headed home from Alexander Dedov's corner. Russia suffered a disappointing 1-1 draw with Moldova, with Austria moving above them in the group. Rubin Okotie scored the only goal of the game as Austria beat Montenegro 1-0 in Vienna.

The speedy Evgeny Konoplyanka created the goal with a cross to the far post with Sydorchuk arriving to fire in from close range. In Vienna, the Pakistan-born, half-Nigerian Rubin Okotie's 24th-minute goal won the game for Austria against a flat Montenegro side. Montenegro went into the qualifying group with hopes of reaching Euro 2016, but had already been struggling after an opening win over Moldova was followed with a goalless draw against Liechtenstein last week.

Please answer the following question: I read this background article the other day: So much rain falling so fast causes some of the damage from a hurricane. But a lot of the damage is caused by storm surge. Storm surge is very high water located in the low pressure eye of the hurricane. The very low pressure of the eye allows the water level to rise above normal sea level. Storm surge can cause flooding when it reaches land ( Figure below ). High winds do a great deal of damage in hurricanes. High winds can also create very big waves. If the large waves are atop a storm surge, the high water can flood the shore. If the storm happens to occur at high tide, the water will rise even higher.  I am facing a new situation today: Two coastal cities, Dune and Shore, got a Hurricane warning.

A body was found Sunday morning under a U.S. Highway 101 overpass at Bay Shore Boulevard near Potrero Avenue in San Francisco, police said. The body of a 56-year-old man was found at 8:37 a.m. Police said there was no sign of foul play and the San Francisco medical examiner is investigating the death. Can we draw the following conclusion? The cause of death is to be determined","output":"Based on the information provided, it can be concluded that the cause of death remains undetermined at this point in time. There are several reasons why this conclusion can be drawn, and I will outline these factors in detail below: 1. No foul play: According to the police, there are no apparent signs of foul play in this incident. This suggests that the individual's death may not have resulted from a criminal act, such as a violent confrontation or intentional harm. However, this does not necessarily imply that the cause of death has been conclusively determined. There could be a number of other factors that led to the man's death, including illness, accidental injury, or exposure. 2. Medical examiner investigation: The San Francisco medical examiner has been called upon to investigate the circumstances surrounding the individual's death. This indicates that a thorough examination, including an autopsy, will likely be conducted to identify the exact cause of death. The results of this investigation will provide more conclusive evidence to determine whether the death was due to natural causes, an accident, or something else. 3. Time of discovery: The body of the 56-year-old man was found on a Sunday morning, which could potentially affect the amount of information available to investigators. Depending on when the man actually died and how long his body had been exposed to the elements, certain factors that may offer insight into the cause of death might have been compromised or obscured. 4. Location: The fact that the body was discovered under a U.S. Highway 101 overpass at Bay Shore Boulevard near Potrero Avenue in San Francisco may provide some context into the potential cause of death. For example, it is possible that the individual may have experienced a tragic accident, such as a fall from the overpass, or possibly succumbed to exposure if he was homeless or stranded in the area. To summarize, the cause of death of the 56-year-old man found under the U.S. Highway 101 overpass in San Francisco remains undetermined at present. Although police have stated there are no signs of foul play, the San Francisco medical examiner is still investigating the death. Once the medical examiner’s findings are released, a more decisive conclusion about the cause of death can be drawn. Until then, it is important to refrain from jumping to conclusions and to await the results of the official investigation."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant that follows instruction extremely well.

Facial recognition cameras identified him at the concert's entrance, and police apprehended Ao amidst the crowd.      It's not the first time facial recognition has been used to catch criminal suspects in China, according to ECNS. But the precision of the catch — the ability to identify and apprehend an individual within a huge crowd — is something multiple state media outlets reported.      In the past, Chinese police used facial recognition to arrest 25 \\"fugitives\\" at a beer festival. Sad! Facial recognition has also been deployed in the subways, where police reportedly caught three suspects over a span of nine days.      The BBC reports that China has \\"been building what it calls \\"the world's biggest camera surveillance network,\\" with an estimated 170 million CCTV cameras up and running, and 400 million new ones to be installed over the next three years. ||||| Image copyright Getty Images Image caption (File Photo) There are an estimated 170 million CCTV cameras already in place in China      Chinese police have used facial recognition technology to locate and arrest a man who was among a crowd of 60,000 concert goers.      The suspect, who has been identified only as Mr Ao, was attending a concert by pop star Jacky Cheung in Nanchang city last weekend when he was caught.
