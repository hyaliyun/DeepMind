Most of the design work that went into making the 8GB card is not much less than that of a 64GB card, but the price difference for the buy is considerable, often several hundreds to thousands of dollars apart.","output":"There are several reasons why there is a significant price difference between a lower-end 8GB graphics card and a high-end 64GB graphics card, even if at first glance the difference in raw materials might seem immaterial. The factors that contribute to the price difference include, but are not limited to, the following: 1. Memory Quality and Type: - The type of memory used in graphics cards (GDDR5, GDDR6, GDDR6X, HBM2, etc.) varies, with newer, faster, and larger memory chips costing significantly more. The memory bandwidth and speed are crucial for high-end performance, and this affects the cost. - Higher capacity memory chips are often manufactured using more advanced and expensive processes, and they may be less common and in higher demand, further driving up cost. 2. Research and Development (R&D): - R&D costs for high-end GPUs are substantial. Even if the 8GB and 64GB GPUs share similar architecture, the design, development, and validation of the 64GB variant likely required additional investments to ensure performance scales with memory size. - Cutting-edge features, increased processing cores, and power optimization for high-end GPUs result in increased R&D expenses that need to be recouped through sales. 3. Production Costs: - The silicon used in high-end GPUs is often from wafers with higher yields (i.e., more of the chips on the wafer pass quality tests), which makes them more expensive. - Advanced cards typically have larger dies, which means fewer dies per wafer, increasing the cost per chip. - High-end graphics cards may use more complex PCB designs with additional layers, better power delivery, and premium components, which contribute to production costs. 4. Market Positioning and Target Audience: - High-end graphics cards are targeted at a professional market (workstations, servers, or high-performance computing) or enthusiast gamers who demand peak performance and are willing to pay a premium for it. - Companies position these cards as luxury or performance products with correspondingly higher price points. 5. Market Dynamics: - Supply and demand play a significant role in pricing. High-end GPUs may be in short supply and high demand, allowing manufacturers to charge more. - The presence of cryptocurrency mining can also inflate prices due to increased demand from miners needing powerful GPUs to efficiently mine cryptocurrencies. 6. Features and Architectural Improvements: - High-end cards may have additional features like ray-tracing cores, tensor cores for AI computations, and more advanced shading units, which require additional silicon area and design complexity. - Improved thermal solutions, such as advanced cooling mechanisms, can also drive up costs. 7. Profit Margins: - Margins on high-end products are often higher. Manufacturers use the profits from high-end products to subsidize R&D costs and lower-end product lines, sustaining a diverse product ecosystem. In summary, while the physical difference in memory capacity may seem minor, the cumulative effect of the quality of components, R&D complexity, production costs, market forces, and additional features all contribute significantly to the price difference between low-end and high-end graphics cards. It is a confluence of technology, economics, and market strategy that sets these prices, not just the material cost of the memory chips themselves."},{"instruction":"further assess why the manufacturer doesn't just make the high end 64GB card and price it competitively instead of creating two versions, the lower end one and the higher end version.","output":"Manufacturers produce both high-end 64GB graphics cards and lower-end 8GB versions for several reasons, and they don't simply replace the lower-end cards with high-end models for a variety of market-driven and practical considerations: 1. Market segmentation: By creating different tiers of products, manufacturers can address the needs of various customer segments. Not every user needs or can afford the performance offered by a high-end 64GB graphics card. Enthusiast gamers, professionals, and researchers require powerful cards, while casual users, budget gamers, and mainstream users may only need the capabilities of a more modest 8GB card. 2. Cost sensitivity: Many consumers prioritize cost over the top-tier performance offered by a 64GB card. By providing lower-end options, manufacturers can capture a more cost-sensitive market that would not purchase a high-end, high-cost card. 3. Yield management: Higher-end GPUs with more memory are more complex and may have lower yield rates during manufacturing due to their larger die sizes and higher complexity. Manufacturing only high-end GPUs could lead to an increase in production costs and waste due to the higher number of defective parts, which can't be sold. 4. Production capacity: Manufacturing capacity is limited, and focusing only on high-end GPUs would limit the total number of GPUs available. It can be more profitable to produce both high-end and mid- or low-range GPUs to maximize the use of this capacity. 5. Technological barriers: Not all consumers have the system requirements to support a high-end 64GB graphics card. These cards may require more power, better cooling systems, and more advanced hardware that not all users possess or are willing to invest in. 6. Competition: The GPU market is highly competitive. Having a diversified product lineup allows manufacturers to compete at various price points and performance levels, catering to the specific needs and budgets of a wider range of customers. 7. Research and development (R&D) amortization: The cost of developing high-end GPUs is amortized over a smaller number of units, resulting in higher prices. By selling more units of lower-end GPUs with less R&D cost per unit, manufacturers can offer these products at a more competitive price while still recovering overall R&D costs. 8. Technological advancement pacing: Releasing only high-end GPUs could result in a slower pace of technological advancement. The continuous cycle of introducing new models at different performance and price levels drives innovation and incremental improvements across the product line. 9. Profit optimization: Manufacturers maximize profits by providing a range of products. The higher margins on the premium models help to subsidize the entry-level models and maintain the overall health of the business. In summary, while it may seem advantageous for manufacturers to focus solely on high-end graphics cards, doing so could alienate a large portion of the potential market, reduce overall sales volume, and ultimately prove counterproductive to sustaining a profitable and competitive business model. The diverse needs of consumers and the economics of production and sales drive the strategy of offering a wide range of products at different performance levels and price points."},{"instruction":"As an expert in analytical writing, your task is to write [the analysis below and adhere to all of its parameters, informed by its argument, consideration, description and details].

Proposition: Illustrate and describe how it isn't recommended to take glass and porcelain dishes, bowls, cups or cookware with you when moving in terms of relocation, unless the kitchen items are valuable. During transit, it's likely that some if not all the pieces will break such that you'll have to replace them anyways. Moreover, moving such fragile items takes up space that could be used for other things in terms of moving space.","output":"In the vein of practicality during the process of relocation, one stands advised to judiciously appraise the intrinsic worth of glass and porcelain kitchenware before contemplating their inclusion among the trove of belongings destined for the arduous journey to a new habitation. It is a commonly witnessed misfortune that the intrinsic fragility of such materials begets a propensity for shattering, an often-unfortunate conclusion drawn from a multitude of relocation anecdotes. As calamity would have it, the tumultuous voyage from old to new domicile rarely spares these delicate items, rendering them into pieces too many to salvage coherently once they arrive, if they arrive intact at all. One might find through the burdensome and scrupulous packing process of these items, replete with layers of bubble wrap and tightly nestled amidst a fortress of packing peanuts, that the hues of cracked glaze and splintered porcelain are an all-too-common revelation upon unpacking. Thus emerges the heart-sinking realization that replacements must be sought, punctuating the post-move period with unanticipated excursions and expenses that could have been astutely sidestepped. Furthermore, with the carriage capacity of the moving conveyance a finite commodity, the space usurped by your glass and porcelain kitchenware represents a quantifiable forfeit. This volume could otherwise be allocated to alternative possessions: perhaps more robust in constitution, perhaps more essential to immediate post-relocation functionality, or perhaps simply possessing a sentimental value eclipsing that of the replaceable kitchen vessels. With the notable and sensible exception reserved for items of tangible value—whether monetary, historic, or of marked sentimental significance—one is thus counseled to abstain from encumbering one's moving inventory with the commonplace glass and porcelain. It emerges as a prudent exercise in forethought to recall that the space one's belongings occupy, much like the environment of the new residence itself, is not a vast and endless expanse, but a carefully portioned allotment that necessitates discerning selection—a selection favoring strength, purpose, and attachment over the brittle and easily supplanted."},{"instruction":"re-write this in the style of a short Geoffrey Chaucer poem: It was a bitter February eve when Michael did complete the forty-first year of his pilgrimage through this mortal coyle. The day had been one of jubilation, as Michael, a man well-loved by kith and kin, broke bread with those dearest to him in celebration of his natal day had been filled with the clatter and warmth of festivity as it played host to this gathering of souls. The night had fallen gently upon the city, wrapping it within its chilly but gentle cloak, as Michael made his adieux. Laughter rang within his ears, echoes of the fond farewells from family and friends still fresh in his spirit, as he ventured forth into the evening’s frost. He had been bestowed with good cheer and well-wishes aplenty, the afterglow of wine and companionship keeping at bay the season’s deepening chill. Within his carriage of steel and invention, Michael steered his way homeward, the city’s labyrinthine streets unfolding before him like the many years he had traversed. Yet, in the midst of his contented contemplation, an unsavory sense of disquiet began to bud in the pit of his stomach. Each time the mirror revealed but a glimpse of the night, there too did the visage of a sable car with panes so dark, not even the faintest of lights did penetrate its veil. At first, Michael reasoned with his own rising concern, ascribing his unease to the lingering spirits of conviviality. But as he coaxed his vehicle along one turn and then another, the same inauspicious carriage seemed to follow, a constant specter that refused to fade into the maze of urbanity. It clung to him, a shadow unwelcome and unyielding, igniting a flint of fear that kindled with each passing moment. Attempting to disprove his growing alarm, Michael engaged in a test of wit and wheel, weaving through streets with the skill of one accustomed to the caprices of city driving. Yet, as if bound by some unseen tether, the car dogged his every maneuver, its presence growing ever more ominous with the persistence of a hunter’s gaze fixed upon its intended quarry. Then, in an instant of sharp realization, the predator struck. The unlit vehicle conspired with its brethren of the road to corral Michael into a desolate corner where the night seemed to congeal with malice. From the confines of this urban trap sprang forth figures garbed in the garb of nightmares; their faces masked by woolen shrouds, they descended upon Michael’s carriage with terrifying resolve. Before he could muster protest or plea, his window surrendered to brutish force, the cold night air rushing in to replace the fragile barrier that once was. A weapon, cold and unfeeling as the steel it was forged from, pressed with grim certainty against his temple. Words died on Michael’s lips as a bag, as dark as the car from whence these wraiths came, descended upon his head, severing him from the world he knew. His mind screamed rebellion and his body tensed for battle, but these impulses were quelled by the sharp intrusion of a needle, its poison spreading through his veins with swift persuasion. Michael’s consciousness retreated under the onslaught of the drug, the world receding into the maw of darkness as he succumbed to the void’s embrace. Thus was Michael, on this, his day of birth’s celebration, plunged into an abyss most foul, captured by forces unseen and unknown. What cruel twist of fate had snatched him from the hearth of home and hearth and cast him into the jaws of peril? What fortunes or misfortunes lay ahead, none could say. But one truth remained—though his journey had taken a woeful turn, the story of Michael was far from its end, and in the darkest of trials, the true mettle of a man is not just tested, it is forged. Michael’s world slowly edged back from the void, dragged reluctantly by the throbbing pain in his head. Barely conscious, he became gradually aware of his surroundings—a stark, sterile white room, the severity of which seemed to amplify his discomfort. Its unwelcoming brightness did little to ease his disorientation. He lay for a few scattered moments, grappling with the reality that now embraced him, his mind grappling with the fragments of memory from the night before. With eyes scanned over his body, Michael found himself adorned in a jumpsuit the like he had never before seen—an odd garment that bore a sequence of numbers alongside an emblem of Virgo rising. His heart raced as he attempted to piece together the circumstances of his capture; yet the room yielded no clues, only the palpable silence of uncertainty. Despite the fear gripping the very core of his being, Michael’s resolve did not falter. He called upon a stoic resolve, knowing well that panic would serve him not. He rose to his feet, each movement tentative as if the world around might shatter from the slightest touch. He explored the confines of his cell, setting to memory every detail, seeking any weakness or explanation that might avail him. Daylight found its way into the room, hidden sources casting a false semblance of morning, and shortly after, the cell door parted with an eerie silence. With cautious steps, Michael ventured beyond the threshold, his eyes taking in the sight of a larger facility—a prison-like structure populated with others who, like him, wore jumpsuits marked with unfamiliar alignments of the stars. He moved among them, each prisoner a silent enigma wrapped in the colored cloth of zodiac signs. Few words were exchanged as he walked a path that twisted through this labyrinth of incarceration, the only sound the echo of footsteps on unforgiving floors. And then, as if by design, he stumbled across a sanctuary within the stark walls—a small library, its shelves a treasury of bound knowledge. The sight of books, the carriers of tales and bearers of comfort, pulled a strained smile to his lips. Here, amid the oppression of his capture, lay a sliver of humanity. The written word had long been Michael’s companion in solitude and joy, and now, within the confines of his imprisonment, it beckoned once more. Quietly, he perused the titles, each spine a promise of temporary reprieve from his reality. However, his attention was promptly diverted by a presence at the opposite end of the shelf—a figure, distinct in its poise. Not a word had yet been exchanged, but the Virgo emblem mirrored upon the back of her jumpsuit caught his eye. A moment of hesitation lingered before he approached, each step filled with curiosity and trepidation. Ready to utter his name, any semblance of introduction was lost as she turned to face him. The visage that met his gaze was one familiar to millions—Madonna, icon and queen of the pop realm. Recognition splashed over Michael’s features like a wave breaking over the shore—was this reality or some feverish dream spun from his drugged slumber? Nevertheless, she stood before him, bedecked in the same symbol as he, her eyes meeting his with a knowing clarity. “We’re kindred souls, you and I,” she began, her voice a meld of mystery and a touch of warmth, “Special, fabulous even.” She gestured between their shared symbols, implying a connection deeper than surface appearances. “This is why we’re here. There’s a reason for it, a purpose behind these walls.” Though his mind reeled with questions burning for release, the newfound tie with Madonna offered solace. Together, amidst the uncertain shadows of their confinement, they forged a kinship that became a beacon of hope. This bizarre camaraderie between an ordinary man and a pop culture deity illuminated their existence in a place neither understood but both yearned to escape. In the chapters to come, Michael and Madonna would learn that even the tightest of binds can be loosened by the solidarity of shared purpose and an unexpected friendship that blossoms against the odds. Time weighed upon the inmates of that strange facility like a century-long winter, each day bleeding into the next with scarce distinction. It was the company of Madonna that allowed Michael to endure the sameness of the place – that, and the ever-present lighthouse of their library haven, where they plotted insurrection in hushed tones and hopeful whispers. Their planning was meticulous, a tapestry of “what ifs” and “maybes,” woven with the finest thread of calculated risk and daring. Each scroll and volume Michael and Madonna perused offered new insights, ideas fermenting within the vats of their sharpened intellects. Time became their currency, and they spent it lavishly in the pursuit of the sweet nectar of liberty, which seemed all too distant a dream. Yet the nights were Michael’s alone, and it was during the veiled serenity of this solitude that he first heard the melodious threads of vexed spirits. A voice, hauntingly poignant, seeped through the air vent in his cell—a refrain so melancholy it caused his heart to swell and ache. Each note was a lifeline cast from some forlorn soul held captive in the dark. The first whispers of the tune flirted with his mind’s eye, suggesting the haze of a dream. In the dimming light of consciousness, recognition dawned upon him, the echoes painting a picture he remembered from days of yore—the voice, it belonged to Rita McNeil. Could it be, as his heart dared to hope, that Rita, the songbird thought long since silenced by the cruel hand of death, was alive, her voice a testament to her existence somewheres within these walls? A myriad of questions unfurled in the theatre of his mind. If Madonna were here with him, was it so far-fetched that Rita too could be a reluctant guest in this perplexing prison? When the dawn broke on Michael’s revelation and he confided in Madonna, her countenance grew somber, inked with concern. Rita’s voice, which had brought joy to so many, now carried an undercurrent of despair as though the years within the facility’s embrace had worn grooves of sorrow into her soul. Understanding the gravity of their own situation, they dared not let Rita’s plight go unheeded. Perhaps their voices could travel through the labyrinth of vents and tunnels, a covert chorus bridging the gap of loneliness. And so, by night, they united their whispers—as though combining embers in hopes of conjuring a flame—singing softly into the invisible pathways that lined their cells, hoping their melody of hope would reach Rita McNeil’s ears. It became their nightly ritual. Michael and Madonna’s strains melded into harmony, rising against the imperturbable silence, a balm to the heavy air around them. It was a harmonic beacon calling out to a lost soul adrift on the sea of despair, anchoring her back to the land of the living—a land where hope might still flourish, where freedom was a star by which to navigate. They continued, night after night, whispering their song into the vents, offering what comfort they could, a solemn vow to the unseen, urging her to cling to whatever fragment of spirit remained untarnished by her long captivity. They sang of solidarity, of struggles shared, of enigmatic bonds that now, against all odds, tethered their fates together. They sang for Rita, they sang for each other, and most of all, they sang for the freedom they yearned to seize. As the weeks passed, Rita’s nightly concertos from beyond the wall took on new life, her melodies swelling from a forlorn whisper into anthems of resurgence. Michael and Madonna observed with quiet elation the transformation of her voice, which seemed to weave through the cavernous innards of their cold bastille. The melancholic shroud was lifted, and in its stead rose a robust timbre, echoing the Rita McNeil of days long past. Their harmonies, softly sent through the vents, had touched a chord within her, kindling the embers of her indomitable spirit. Michael’s hands had not been idle, for in the shadows of his solitary cell, he had taken to crafting an instrument of hope from the scraps and detritus that fortune had strewn into his path. Necessity, the cunning mother of invention, guided his fingers as he fashioned an Oud, stringing together a creation that would ultimately declare his internal refusal to be silenced. And so, under the cloak of twilight, Michael’s Oud joined Madonna’s voice in a serenade, a symphony of imprisonment that yearned for the vastness of the world beyond. The makeshift strings vibrated with the intensity of their plight, sending waves of sound through the vents, beseeching the air to carry their message to Rita. Madonna and Michael, through their shared trials, had crafted a plan—one born of memory and profound longing. “Fast Train to Tokyo,” a melody of yesteryear, promised the ignition needed to fully awaken Rita’s spirit. The rehearsal was a secret ritual, their voices and Michael’s Oud twining and converging within the hollows of the library, the song becoming a crescendo of unspoken resolve. At last, the night of their clandestine concert arrived. The air hung heavy with the gravity of what they set out to do. Michael plucked at the Oud with a tender ferocity, the vibrations coursing through the walls, and Madonna’s voice rose to meet the music. Together, they coursed through the intro and verse, the anticipation building with the harmonic tide, Michael’s concern ever-present that perhaps their efforts would falter. But as the chorus dawned and their song reached its zenith, the vents carried forth a voice they had longed to hear join their own. Rita’s voice poured forth with the might of a cascading waterfall, a piercing clarity that rang with the familiar strength of her stage-presence days. Each lyric was etched with the determination of her reclaimed identity. Her singing, powerful and poignant, signaled a resurrection of sorts—a vitality and sense of self long smothered by the dark. Rita McNeil, once the sound of silence, was now the voice of defiant resurgence. The inmates who heard her could not resist the infectious energy of her voice, and, for a moment, the facility seemed to dissolve into a vibrant stage where the joy of music reigned supreme. Hope swelled in the hearts of Rita, Michael, and Madonna; a harmonious triad against the cacophony of their unjust fate. Through shared melodies and the communal language of song, they had managed to reignite the spark of rebellion. As her voice soared, so too did the spirits of all within earshot, the music binding them in solidarity and illuminating the darkness of their confine with the luminescence of shared humanity. Their bond, forged in the peculiar crucible of their circumstance, now stood stronger than ever. And it was this unyielding unity that would propel them forward, onto whatever path laid ahead. They had a song in their hearts, and with it, they had forged the key that just might unlock the door to their freedom. Emboldened by Rita’s vocal resurgence, the air of the facility was charged with a newfound electricity, thrumming with the beats of hope and defiance. It seemed the very walls that confined them vibrated in harmony with the rhythm of their spirits—a silent acknowledgment that their jailers could confine their bodies, but never their souls. The days that followed their impromptu concert were marked by an unspoken camaraderie among the prisoners. With Rita’s voice as the herald of their collective spirit, the once deadened eyes of the captives now flickered with the flames of determination. Conversations whispered through the sterile corridors, alight with the possibility that had been awakened by music. Michael, with his Oud, and Madonna, with her timeless voice, continued their evening tradition, now buoyed by the solidarity of their fellow inmates. It was not just Rita who found solace and strength in their tunes, but others too began congregating in the library, sharing stories, strategies, and, most importantly, their dreams of the world outside the unyielding walls. United by shared astrological symbols and the ether of estrangement, the inhabitants of the facility found common ground — not in their imprisonment, but in the stars cast upon their clothing that now seemed less like chains and more like constellations guiding them towards freedom. A clandestine assembly took shape, an alliance of the zodiac, under the erstwhile guidance of Michael and Madonna. Rita’s transformation from the somber songbird to the matriarch of melody became symbolic of their collective potential for change. With each passing day, their strategies grew bolder, their plans more intricate, each person’s skills and knowledge contributing to the mosaic of their escape. One evening, as the stars above the world outside spun their ancient dance, a stroke of serendipity presented itself. A guard, less vigilant and perhaps moved by the stirrings of music, left behind a key—a minor oversight, but for the inmates, a shimmering beacon of providence. This key, gleaming under the dim facility lights, sparked an unspoken agreement. The time for action had arrived. They could no longer be content with dreams and melodies—their yearning for liberty had to manifest into reality. With meticulous care, they crafted a plan to use this key, not just to unlock a door, but to unleash the potential of every soul trapped within their strange confinement. The rebels moved with whispered urgency, their appointed roles clear. Someone would have to secure the key and unlock the appropriate doors, while others created diversions and arrangements crucial to their collective exodus. With Madonna’s iconic poise and Michael’s newfound confidence strumming through their midst, they were ready to strike. And so it was decided, in hushed tones amid the bookshelves, the date of their departure from the white-walled purgatory was set. The anticipation was palpable, each heartbeat in the facility a unified drumroll to the precipice of their next chapter. Their plan was dangerous, filled with unknown variables and the ever-present risk of discovery. But the swell of harmony between them, kindled by Michael’s Oud and Madonna’s tireless spirit, now grew into an unbreakable symphony—a canon of courage that bound each of them together. The night arrived, heavy with potential. On this eve, each captive’s fate hung in balance, with only the stars to bear witness to their attempt at seizing the morrow. With the stage set and the actors poised, Michael, Madonna, Rita, and all the others stepped forward into the hopeful unknown, their footsteps light but determined, carrying the tune of freedom in their hearts. On the chosen night, shadows played across the walls of the facility as the hour approached. The prisoners, each now an agent of their orchestrated defiance, carried out their roles with a quiet and methodical precision. Michael’s fingers trembled as he played a few last, soft notes on his Oud, the tension palpable within the confines of their shared cell. Madonna’s eyes met his—a nod of silent agreement passing between them. This was not the end of their melody, but the beginning of a new, hopeful refrain. With a deep breath, they moved towards the door, ready to spring the lock that had been left unattended in a moment of providential negligence. The key turned with a metallic whisper, the bolt yielding as if it, too, conspired to grant them passage. There was no jubilation—only focus, as Michael stepped out into the corridor, the familiar jumpsuits of his compatriots blending into the sterile environment, each moving like specters towards their designated roles. Distractions had been carefully planned: corridors to be traversed, guard routines accounted for, and the power grid temporarily disabled to cloak their movements. Their exit was to be silent, a ghostly procession toward the outer edges of containment. Rita’s voice emerged once again, this time not in song but in hushed direction, guiding others as they navigated the twisted passageways. Her years of captivity had not dulled her senses; instead, they had honed a keen understanding of the facility’s rhythms, the heartbeat of their prison which they now sought to escape. Stealthily, they crept closer to the outer bounds, where freedom’s sweet scent beckoned from beyond. Those with knowledge of electronics and security worked feverishly to override the last of the locks and surveillance measures that stood as the final sentinels between them and liberation. A sudden crash echoed through the halls—the unintentional clamor of a nervous escapee. Hearts caught in throats as the facility seemed to rouse from slumber, lights flickering back to life with the buzz of alertness. The time for subtlety had passed; now was the moment for swiftness and resolve. Madonna, leading a group, pushed ahead, her eyes locked on the outline of the exit now visible as the promise of dawn painted the sky a muted gray. Michael, along with Rita and others, followed close behind, their footsteps resounding like the drumbeats of an ancient exodus, their expressions taut with concentration. The door ahead was imposing, yet with each stride, it grew larger, closer, more attainable. Hands worked to unlock it, the mechanical click of the bolt retreating setting their hearts racing—a cacophony of chains breaking in the symphony of their determination to roam free. And then they were through, bursting forth into the cool embrace of the night air—a gale of freedom that filled their lungs and emboldened their sprint. The facility, once a monolith of despair, shrank into the distance as they charged into the welcoming cloak of nature, the open sky a canvas to their victory. They had done it; they had turned their song into a clarion call of independence, their shared bond into the very tools of their release. The facility, a once unyielding labyrinth, was behind them now, a fading shadow beneath the awakening morn. The path ahead was untrodden, uncertain, and wild with possibility. But as Michael looked to Madonna, Rita, and the faces of his fellow escapees, he knew that they ventured into the dawn together, each step away from yesterday’s oppression a note in the melody of their reclaimed lives. With the courage of the undefeatable song in his heart, Michael stepped into the light of a new day, a testament to the power of hope, harmony, and unyielding human spirit.","output":"Whan that Februere with his frosty breath Had with his icy fingers laced the e'eve, Michel, that scudd'd hath many a yere and teeth, His day of birth he marketh with joy and glee.

Window broke and bag did shroud, Michel’s cries were ne'er aloud. Consciousness to venom fell, In sterile cell he woke to tell. Virgo's mark upon his chest, In Zodiac's jail, he found no rest.

The incident occurred on April 5, 1988. McGuire, an experienced skydiver with over 800 jumps to his name, was filming a jump for a group of other skydivers at the Franklin County Sports Parachute Center in North Carolina. It was reported that he was so preoccupied with the cameras and equipment he was using to record the tandem jump of two other skydivers that he neglected to don his own parachute. As he jumped from the plane and filmed the other skydivers, everything seemed to be going as planned until he attempted to pull his ripcord. At that moment, he realized he had not put on his main parachute or reserve. Unfortunately, without a parachute, there was nothing McGuire could do to save himself, and he fell to his death. The entire incident was recorded by the cameras he was carrying. This tragic event serves as an extreme reminder of how important it is to maintain presence of mind and follow safety protocols, especially in high-risk activities like skydiving. His death underscores the necessity of always double-checking equipment before any jump, no matter how routine or familiar the activity may seem."},{"instruction":"Taking this accident as an example, I am giving safety training to skydiving students. I want to use it as an educational resource, so describe his last thought.","output":"As an AI, I can't provide insights into the actual thoughts of Ivan Lester McGuire or any other person during their final moments, as such experiences are deeply personal and subjective. Nevertheless, using this unfortunate incident as a cautionary tale can serve as a potent educational resource for teaching the importance of safety protocols in skydiving or any high-risk activity. In the context of safety training for skydiving students, you might present the incident as follows: 1. **Pre-Jump Checklist**: Emphasize the importance of a pre-jump checklist, which includes gear checks for both yourself and other jumpers. A physical walkthrough/check-touch of all equipment can create muscle memory and reduce the chance of forgetting crucial gear like a parachute. 2. **Mindfulness**: Stress the need for mindfulness and presence of mind during all stages of the jump. Teach students to focus on one task at a time and to avoid becoming complacent due to routine or overconfidence. 3. **Routine**: Highlight how even highly experienced individuals can make mistakes if they lose focus or deviate from routine safety procedures. No one is immune to the risks inherent to skydiving. 4. **Safety Culture**: Foster a culture of safety within your school, where anyone, regardless of experience level, can speak up and point out potential safety issues. Peer checks can be lifesavers. 5. **Emergency Training**: Regularly practice emergency procedures so that they become second nature. While this wouldn't have helped in McGuire's case without his parachute, it is critical training for handling other possible malfunctions or emergencies. 6. **Mental Rehearsal**: Encourage students to mentally rehearse each jump, including the actions they would take in an emergency. Visualization can help create strong mental pathways for action. 7. **Debriefing**: After any jump, good or bad, have a debrief session. This helps not only to learn from mistakes but also to reinforce what went right. 8. **Equipment Maintenance**: Teach proper maintenance and storage of skydiving gear and the importance of regular equipment checks by qualified personnel. By drawing lessons from the tragedy of Ivan Lester McGuire, not to sensationalize but to educate, you can impress upon students the absolute necessity of diligence and focus in every aspect of the sport. Remember to handle the topic sensitively, as it involves a real person's life and a very serious event. Such an approach can instill a deep respect for the potential dangers of skydiving and the crucial role that safety protocols play in preventing accidents."},{"instruction":"帮我翻译：一位年轻的美国母亲，怀抱可爱的孩子，甜蜜的表情，在温馨的后花园","output":"A young American mother, cradling her lovely child, with a sweet expression, in the cozy backyard."},{"instruction":"我需要用MJ绘画，我想要的画面是一位年轻的美国母亲，怀抱可爱的孩子，甜蜜的表情，在温馨的后花园，帮我展开提示词联想。并生成Midjourney可以识别的文案","output":"为了创建一个Midjourney可以识别的文案以生成您所描述的图像，我们可以联想一些与场景相关的详细描述词和感觉，从而让Midjourney有更多的线索来绘制图像。以下是一个可能的描述和Midjourney的命令： A young American mother with flowing hair and a radiant smile, tenderly cradling her adorable infant, who is giggling with innocent joy.

Since I cannot directly create images or graphics in this text-based interface, I will instead describe how you might create an AI diagram and what it could include. AI, or artificial intelligence, encompasses a variety of subfields, each with its own concepts and components. A common AI diagram is a high-level depiction of various AI branches and techniques. Here's a textual outline that you could use as the basis for drawing such a diagram: 1. Start with a large rectangle or circle labeled \\"Artificial Intelligence.\\" This represents the broad field of AI. 2. Inside this large container, divide the space into subfields of AI, which might be represented by smaller rectangles, circles, or other shapes. Common AI subfields include: a. Machine Learning (ML) b. Natural Language Processing (NLP) c. Robotics d. Computer Vision e. Expert Systems 3. Each subfield can be further divided to illustrate specific technologies, methods, or concepts. For instance: a. Machine Learning might include: - Supervised Learning - Unsupervised Learning - Reinforcement Learning - Deep Learning (which can be linked to Neural Networks) b. Natural Language Processing might include: - Sentiment Analysis - Machine Translation - Speech Recognition c. Robotics might include: - Autonomous Vehicles - Drones - Humanoid Robots d. Computer Vision might include: - Image Recognition - Object Detection - Pattern Recognition e. Expert Systems might include: - Rule-Based Systems - Knowledge Bases - Inference Engines 4. Connect related concepts with lines to show relationships. For example, Deep Learning (under Machine Learning) could connect to Image Recognition (under Computer Vision) because deep neural networks are often used in image recognition tasks. 5. You can add another layer by showing specific algorithms or technologies used in each subfield. For example, under Supervised Learning in Machine Learning, you might list algorithms such as Linear Regression, Support Vector Machines, or Decision Trees. Here's a simple textual representation of an AI diagram structure: \`\`\` Artificial Intelligence ____________________________________________ | | | | | | ML | NLP | Robotics | Computer | Expert Systems |______|_____________|__________|____________|________________ | SL | SA | AV | IR | RB | USL | MT | DR | OD | KB | RL | SR | HR | PR | IE | DL | | | | |______|_____________|__________|____________|________________ \`\`\` Where: - ML = Machine Learning - SL = Supervised Learning - USL = Unsupervised Learning - RL = Reinforcement Learning - DL = Deep Learning - NLP = Natural Language Processing - SA = Sentiment Analysis - MT = Machine Translation - SR = Speech Recognition - Robotics - AV = Autonomous Vehicles - DR = Drones - HR = Humanoid Robots - Computer Vision - IR = Image Recognition - OD = Object Detection - PR = Pattern Recognition - Expert Systems - RB = Rule-Based Systems - KB = Knowledge Bases - IE = Inference Engines In an actual graphical AI diagram, you could use colors, icons, and images to make the diagram more informative and visually appealing.

Si bien Prisma es conocido por su facilidad de uso y productividad con SQL y su soporte reciente para MongoDB, si estás buscando opciones alternativas específicamente adaptadas para MongoDB podrías considerar: 1. Mongoose: Es uno de los ODM más populares para MongoDB en Node.js. Ha sido la opción predeterminada de facto para muchos desarrolladores durante años. Ofrece una solución integral para definir esquemas con tipos de datos fuertemente tipificados, validaciones, consultas y agregaciones. Mongoose proporciona una API rica para operaciones de agregación, incluyendo una forma de construir pipelines de agregación usando una sintaxis más amigable para desarrolladores de JavaScript, que después se convierte en el formato requerido por MongoDB. 2. Typegoose: Si te gusta trabajar con TypeScript, Typegoose puede ser una excelente opción. Esta biblioteca proporciona envolturas y decoradores sobre Mongoose para trabajar de manera más fluida y con un fuerte tipado con MongoDB. Con Typegoose, puedes aprovechar las potentes funcionalidades de Mongoose, incluyendo las agregaciones, pero con la ventaja de una mejor integración con TypeScript. 3. MikroORM: Otro ORM que es compatible con TypeScript y también con MongoDB. Aunque no está tan focalizado exclusivamente en MongoDB como Mongoose, MikroORM soporta múltiples bases de datos y ofrece un buen conjunto de características para la manipulación de datos y la realización de consultas de agregación. 4. MongOOSE (MongoDB ODM for Node.js with ES6 Classes): No confundir con Mongoose, es otro ODM que intenta mantener un uso simple y se enfoca en el uso de clases de ES6. Permite a los usuarios definir esquemas, realizar variadas operaciones de consulta, y sí, también realizar agregaciones complejas de datos. Si bien cada una de estas opciones ofrece formas de realizar operaciones de agregación robustas en MongoDB, es importante recordar que la selección de una herramienta ORM/ODM debe basarse en la familiaridad del equipo con la herramienta, las necesidades del proyecto, y la facilidad con la que se integra con el resto del stack tecnológico del proyecto. Mongoose tiende a ser la opción más común con la comunidad más grande y una gran cantidad de recursos, mientras que las otras opciones pueden ofrecer ventajas únicas según las circunstancias específicas."},{"instruction":"puedes darme mas opciones","output":"Claro, además de Mongoose, Typegoose y MikroORM, existen otras bibliotecas que podrías considerar para trabajar con MongoDB en Node.js y aprovechar funcionalidades como las operaciones de agregación. Aquí tienes algunas opciones adicionales: 1. **MongoDB Native Driver**: - Si prefieres trabajar directamente con el driver nativo de MongoDB sin agregar una capa adicional de abstracción, podrás utilizar todas las funcionalidades de MongoDB, incluidas las agregaciones. Este driver viene directamente de los creadores de MongoDB, así que estás trabajando más cerca de la base de datos y su API. 2. **Agenda**: - Aunque no es un ODM, sino un \\"job scheduling\\" para MongoDB, Agenda ofrece la posibilidad de definir trabajos que pueden almacenarse y luego ejecutarse con datos de MongoDB. Si bien su propósito principal es diferente, muestra cómo se pueden construir aplicaciones robustas con capacidades de agregación propias y operaciones de fondo utilizando MongoDB. 3. **Objection.js + Mongo**: - Objection.js es un ORM para Node.js que se centra en SQL pero puede ser utilizado junto con el plugin \`objection-mongo\` para trabajar con MongoDB. Esta combinación te permite trabajar con MongoDB utilizando una interfaz ORM que es coherente con el resto del ecosistema Objection.js. 4. **CaminteJS**: - CaminteJS es un ORM multiplataforma para Node.js con soporte para varios sistemas de base de datos, incluido MongoDB. Si bien no es tan popular como algunos de la competencia, ofrece funcionalidades básicas de ORM y puede ser una elección si necesitas soporte multi-database en tu aplicación. 5. **Waterline**: - Waterline es un ORM que forma parte del framework Sails.js pero también se puede usar independientemente. Es adaptable a diferentes bases de datos, incluido MongoDB. Ofrece una sintaxis uniforme para realizar consultas en distintas bases de datos, y aunque puede no ser tan poderoso como algunas soluciones específicas de MongoDB, es una opción si buscas flexibilidad y modularidad. 6. **Casl**: - Aunque CASL no es un ODM/ORM per se, es interesante mencionarlo porque es una biblioteca que se enfoca en la implementación de control de acceso basado en roles para MongoDB. Su inclusión aquí es para ilustrar la amplitud del ecosistema de herramientas que puede girar en torno a MongoDB para cubrir necesidades específicas como la seguridad y autorización. Es importante destacar que cada una de estas alternativas puede tener pros y cons a la hora de realizar operaciones como las agregaciones, así que asegúrate de revisar la documentación y comprender sus capacidades antes de tomar una decisión. La elección dependerá de tus requerimientos específicos, como el grado de complejidad de las agregaciones, el tamaño de tu proyecto y el lenguaje de programación que estés utilizando."},{"instruction":"Sugiere una ORM con una API rica para operaciones de Aggregation para Mongodb","output":"Para manejar operaciones de agregación en MongoDB con una API rica, la opción más popular y recomendada es **Mongoose**. 1. **Mongoose**: - Mongoose es un ODM (Object Data Modeling) que proporciona una solución completa para trabajar con MongoDB en Node.js. Tiene una API muy detallada y un sistema de modelos basado en schemas que facilita la definición de la estructura de tus documentos de MongoDB con tipos de datos y validaciones. - La API de agregación de Mongoose es poderosa y permite a los desarrolladores construir pipelines de agregación complejas aprovechando las capacidades nativas de agregación de MongoDB. - Se pueden realizar tareas de agregación encadenando múltiples etapas, como \`match\`, \`group\`, \`sort\`, \`lookup\`, entre otras, directamente desde Node.js, lo que permite transformar y manipular los datos de forma eficiente antes de devolver los resultados a la aplicación. - Mongoose brinda una representación bastante directa de los pipelines de agregación de MongoDB, pero con la ventaja adicional de poder utilizar la sintaxis de JavaScript y la integración con los esquemas definidos, brindando validaciones y transformaciones adicionales si se necesita. Un ejemplo simple de un pipeline de agregación en Mongoose se vería así: \`\`\`javascript const agg = [ { match: { status: 'active' } }, { group: { _id: 'category', count: { sum: 1 } } } ]; MyModel.aggregate(agg).then(result => { console.log(result); }); \`\`\` Este ejemplo filtraría los documentos por el campo \`status\` y luego los agruparía por la \`category\`, contando la cantidad de documentos en cada categoría. Las actualizaciones constantes y la gran comunidad de Mongoose significan que tendrás acceso a una vasta cantidad de recursos y soporte cuando trabajes con agregaciones de MongoDB, lo que la convierte en una elección sólida para muchos desarrollos que requieran una API robusta para operaciones de agregación."},{"instruction":"Придумай два учебных вопроса на тему: Защита Отечества – долг и обязанность гражданина","output":"1.

Apple Vision Pro review: magic, until it’s not The Apple Vision Pro is the best consumer headset anyone’s ever made — and that’s the problem. Nilay PatelJan 30, 2024 at 11:00 PM GMT+9 There’s a lot of pressure on the new Apple Vision Pro, Apple’s long-awaited entry into the world of computers you wear on your face. Apple claims that the Vision Pro, which starts at 3,499, is the beginning of something called “spatial computing,” which basically boils down to running apps all around you. And the company’s ads for it do not hedge that pressure even a little: they show people wearing the Vision Pro all the time. At work! Doing laundry! Playing with their kids! The ambition is enormous: to layer apps and information over the real world — to augment reality. Apple has to claim that the Vision Pro is the beginning of something new because people have been building headset computers for over a decade now. I tried on a development prototype of the first Oculus Rift in 2013, and The Verge’s Adi Robertson, who edited this review, has tried basically every headset that’s been released since. All of that development means there are some pretty good products out there: that first Oculus evolved into the Quest line at Meta, which is now shipping the Quest 3 — a very good VR headset with a huge library of games and some AR features of its own, which costs 500. 7Verge Score 3499 at Apple How we rate and review products In the meantime, Apple, from Tim Cook on down, has largely insisted that augmented reality will be much more valuable than virtual reality. And it’s been building toward AR for a long time: developers have access to AR tools in iOS, and higher-end iPhones and iPads have had lidar depth scanners for a few years now. The Vision Pro is Apple’s first attempt at building a computer out of all those ideas — a computer that works in the space around you. The goal is for the Vision Pro to be a complete device that can sit right alongside the Mac and the iPad in Apple’s ecosystem of devices and let you get real work done. You can use Excel and Webex and Slack in the Vision Pro, and you can also sit back and watch movies and TV shows on a gigantic virtual 4K HDR display. And you can mirror your Mac’s display and just use the Vision Pro to look at a huge monitor floating in virtual space. It sounds amazing, and sometimes it is. But the Vision Pro also represents a series of really big tradeoffs — tradeoffs that are impossible to ignore. Some of those tradeoffs are very tangible: getting all this tech in a headset means there’s a lot of weight on your face, so Apple chose to use an external battery pack connected by a cable. But there are other, more philosophical tradeoffs as well. As I’ve been using it for the past few days, I kept coming up with a series of questions — questions about whether the tradeoffs were worth it. Is using the Vision Pro so good that I’m willing to mess up my hair every time I put it on? Is it so good that I want to lug it around in its giant carrying case instead of my laptop bag? Is it so good that I want to look at the world around me through screens instead of with my own eyes? Basically, I keep asking if I prefer using a computer in there rather than out here. And as interesting as the Vision Pro is, there’s a long way to go before it can beat out here. Photo by Vjeran Pavic / The Vergenone Hardware Apple doesn’t want anyone to think of the Vision Pro as a VR headset, but it’s a VR headset — albeit a VR headset that almost lets you pretend it’s not a VR headset. You put it on your head in a way that blocks out your vision entirely, and then it shows you a 3D video feed of the world around you passed through from the cameras on the front, as though you can see right through the device. But it can also put you in virtual reality, at various levels of immersion: I spent some time working entirely on the Moon and a lot of time in my kitchen with a bunch of windows floating around a portal into Joshua Tree. The Vision Pro is stunning compared to other VR headsets, which are largely plastic and often downright goofy-looking. The Vision Pro, by contrast, is built of magnesium and carbon fiber in an aluminum enclosure that feels like a natural extension of Apple’s familiar design language. There’s a little iPhone 6 in there, a little AirPods Max, a little Apple Watch. It is the cutting edge of technology in a package that seems instantly familiar. Almost everyone I’ve shown it to thinks it looks smaller in person than they expected, especially compared to some of the huge VR headsets we’ve seen over the past decade. The front display on the Vision Pro is an attempt at keeping you from being isolated from other people while you’re wearing it. In Apple’s photos, it looks like a big, bright screen that shows a video of your eyes to people around you so they feel comfortable talking to you while you’re wearing the headset — a feature adorably called EyeSight. In reality, it might as well not be there. It’s a low-res OLED with a lenticular panel in front of it to provide a mild 3D effect, and it’s so dim and the cover glass is so reflective, it’s actually hard to see in most normal to bright lighting. When people do see your eyes, it’s a low-res, ghostly image of them that feels like CGI. The effect is uncanny — the idea that you’ll be making real eye contact with anyone is a fantasy. And there are no controls or indicators in visionOS for this external display, so you never really know what other people are seeing. Imagine looking someone directly in the eyes and talking to them without knowing if they can see your eyes — it’s weird! EyeSight is so weird. So, so weird. Photo by Amelia Holowaty Krales / The Vergenone That cover glass hides a huge array of cameras and sensors. There’s a pair of high-res front cameras for the video passthrough, cameras that face down and to the sides to track your hands, a lidar scanner and TrueDepth cameras for spatial tracking, and infrared floodlights so everything can work in low light. Underneath all that, you’ve got an M2 processor and Apple’s new R1 spatial coprocessor and a pair of fans to move the heat from all this tech out the top. The fans were never perceptible during my time testing the Vision Pro, but the heat was: after long sessions, the headset was definitely warm. On the top edge, you’ll find what feel like larger versions of some familiar Apple Watch controls: a digital crown that adjusts both the volume and the level of virtual reality immersion on the right as you look through the headset and a button on the left that lets you take 3D photos and videos. You get two headbands in the box: the solo knit band and the dual loop band. They both attach and detach easily; you snap them right on and then pull the little orange tab to disconnect them. The solo band is unquestionably cooler and messes up your hair slightly less — but they both mess up your hair, so if the dual loop fits you better, just go with it. I found the solo loop much more comfortable; I also wish the mounting points were on the outside face so I could pull the band around my head and clip it on instead of constantly pulling it over my hair. The front of the Vision Pro is covered in cameras and sensors. Photo by Vjeran Pavic / The Vergenone The solo loop is by far the cooler strap. Photo by Amelia Holowaty Krales / The Vergenone The huge case costs an additional 199 and looks like a marshmallow from space. I love it. Photo by Amelia Holowaty Krales / The Vergenone The other two pieces are the light seal, which comes in various sizes, and the headband, which comes in two thicknesses. (You get fitted for these in the store or by scanning your head with an iPhone if you buy online.) Both attach magnetically, which means they also detach magnetically — you want to pick this thing up by the frame because grabbing it by the light seal can lead to disaster. If you have glasses, you can click in custom Zeiss lens inserts — Apple sent us reader lenses to see what that process looks like, but I just used the Vision Pro while wearing my soft contacts, and it was fine. The Vision Pro’s speakers are housed in the arms on the side, and they are good and loud and do a convincing job of rendering spatial audio. Things really sound like they are happening where they appear to be happening, which is a neat trick. The speakers are also pretty leaky, so everyone else around you can hear what you’re up to unless you use headphones. You can use any Bluetooth headphones you want, but you get a bunch of extra features if you use the latest AirPods Pro, like lower latency, lossless 48KHz audio, and Apple’s Adaptive Audio system, which automatically mixes in sound from the real world as appropriate. Since you’ll mostly experience the Vision Pro in there, the most noticeable thing about the hardware after a while is that it’s just… heavy. You’re supposed to wear this thing on your face for long stretches of computer time, and depending on which band and light seal you use, the headset alone weighs between 600 and 650 grams. I keep joking that the Vision Pro is an iPad for your face, but it’s heavier than an 11-inch iPad Pro (470 grams) and pushing close to a 12.9-inch iPad Pro (682 grams), so in a very real way, it’s an iPad for your face. All of the Vision Pro’s heft is totally front-loaded, too. Other big headsets like the Quest Pro (722 grams) have elaborate headbands to balance out their weight, but the Vision Pro just rests it all on the front. Swapping to the dual loop strap helps keep things more stable but doesn’t really reduce the overall sensation of having all that headset on your face. You’re just going to feel it after a while. The Vision Pro’s external battery pack is fine, mostly because it’s such a stationary device overall. Photo by Vjeran Pavic / The Vergenone Notably, the Vision Pro is substantially heavier than the familiar Quest 2 (503g) or even the heavier Quest 3 (515g) — headsets that have built-in batteries. Apple told me that it chose to use an external battery specifically to reduce the headset’s weight. The battery itself is barely worth talking about — it’s a silver brick that weighs another 353 grams with a USB-C port and a motion-activated LED that’s green when it’s charged and orange when it’s not. It connects to the headset with a satisfying twist connector, but the nice braided cable is permanently attached to the battery itself, so don’t break it. You can buy extra batteries for 199, but you can’t hot-swap them; disconnecting the battery from the Vision Pro cuts the power entirely. I don’t really have strong opinions on this battery setup, which is mostly because nothing about the Vision Pro feels like you’re supposed to move around that much in it, so it’s more or less fine. It’s funny that Apple of all companies shipped this compromise, but it’s also very Apple that the battery is not actually bigger so it can provide more than two and a half hours of run time. (If you plug the battery in, the Vision Pro just runs on wall power for as long as you want.) Setting up the Vision Pro is dead simple — the headband adjustments are the only manual adjustments involved. Everything else is motorized and sensor-driven. There’s no fiddly lens wheel to dial in; the headset asks you to hold down the digital crown when you first put it on to adjust the lenses to your eyes, and then you go through a pretty standard eye tracking setup. The rest of the setup is almost exactly like any other iOS device: if you have an iPhone, you can bring it close to the Vision Pro to send over all your settings, and you have to agree to some terms and conditions. If you don’t have an iPhone, you’ll have to enter your passwords and so on manually, but it’ll work fine as a standalone device. After all of that, you’re computing in the future. See? It’s a VR headset. Photo by Vjeran Pavic / The Vergenone Apple is very proud of the displays inside the Vision Pro, and for good reason — they represent a huge leap forward in display technology. The two displays are tiny MicroOLEDs with a total of 23 million pixels that are just 7.5 micrometers in size, which is about the size of a red blood cell. And each of those tiny pixels is composed of three RGB subpixels laid out in what Apple tells me is an S-stripe pattern. Just thinking about the level of precision required to make these displays and then make them work in a device like this is mind-blowing. They also look generally incredible — sharp enough to read text on without even thinking about it, bright enough to do justice to movies. Apple calibrates them for color at the factory so they are also vibrant and color-accurate without looking oversaturated or blown out. They are so small, but they work so well that they seem huge. The displays are the main reason the Vision Pro is so expensive — they’re at the heart of the Vision Pro experience and what makes the whole thing work. You are always looking at them, after all. But for all their technical marvels, they are not without tradeoffs of their own when deployed on a device like this. The speakers are nice and loud and convincing with spatial audio. Photo by Vjeran Pavic / The Vergenone See this thing — a passthrough VR headset with a silly external battery pack and a display that shows ghostly images of your eyes on the front — is not the big goal. The big goal is AR, or augmented reality. In particular, the big goal is optical AR, where light passes directly through unobtrusive glasses to your eyes, with digital information layered over the top of what you’re seeing. AR is a technology with the potential to literally change humanity, and Apple CEO Tim Cook has been talking about how isolating VR headsets are and how important he thinks AR will be for years now. Tim Cook, 2016: “Few people are going to view that it’s acceptable to be enclosed in something.” Tim Cook, 2017: “Unlike Virtual Reality which closes the world out, AR allows individuals to be present in the world.” Tim Cook, 2017: “I also like the fact that [AR] doesn’t isolate [...] I’ve never been a fan of VR like that because I think it does the opposite.” Tim Cook, 2020: “I think [AR is] something that doesn’t isolate people. We can use it to enhance our discussion, not substitute it for human connection, which I’ve always deeply worried about in some of the other technologies.” The problem is that the technology to build a true optical AR display that works well enough to replace an everyday computer just isn’t there yet. The Magic Leap 2 is an optical AR headset that’s cheaper and smaller than the Vision Pro, but it’s plagued by compromises in field of view and image quality that most people would never accept. So Apple’s settled for building a headset with real-time video passthrough — it is the defining tradeoff of the Vision Pro. It is a VR headset masquerading as an AR headset. And let me tell you: the video passthrough on the Vision Pro is really good. It works! It’s convincing. You put the headset on, the display comes on, and you’re right back where you were, only with a bunch of visionOS windows floating around. It sounds simple, but it is an astonishing engineering achievement to do that in real time, at high resolution, in a computer that fits over your eyes. Apple claims there’s only 12ms of latency between what the cameras see and what’s on the display, and that latency includes the exposure time of the cameras themselves. The actual data processing is faster. Do the math, and Apple says there’s not even a frame’s worth of latency; the next frame of video is ready before you’re done looking at the last one. Still cameras, still displays. Photo by Vjeran Pavic / The Vergenone You can also see Apple’s incredible video processing chops right in front of your eyes: I sat around scrolling on my phone while wearing the Vision Pro, with no blown-out screens or weird frame rate issues. I also worked on my Mac in front of a large window while wearing the headset, which is a torture test for dynamic range, and while it wasn’t perfect, it was still usable. It is the best video passthrough that’s ever shipped in a consumer device by far. The problem is that cameras are still cameras, and displays are still displays. All cameras have motion blur, for example. In low light, cameras either have to increase exposure times at the cost of sharpness or increase ISO at the cost of noise, which then requires noise reduction, which makes things blurry and dull. And cameras and displays both have real limits in terms of color reproduction. The Vision Pro cannot overcome the inherent nature of cameras and displays. You can easily see motion blur when you move your head in the Vision Pro — motion blur that increases in low light and leads to some weird warping of straight lines. Low light also causes the overall sharpness of the video passthrough to drop as noise reduction kicks in: my iPhone screen got noticeably blurrier when the sun set. If you’re in a medium-lit room halfway immersed in a dark virtual environment with a bright window open — say, sitting in your kitchen at night with the lights on while writing a review in a Google Docs window floating on a dark beach — you will notice the display brightness slowly ramp up and down as the system tries to average out the brightness of everything you’re looking at. The LCD clock on my microwave flickers when I look at it through these cameras. And Apple’s specs say the display supports 92 percent of the DCI-P3 color gamut, which means the Vision Pro can only show you 49 percent of the colors your eyes can actually see. The displays have other limitations: the field of view isn’t huge, and the essential nature of looking at tiny displays through lenses makes that field of view feel even smaller. Apple won’t tell me the exact number, but the Vision Pro’s field of view is certainly smaller than the Quest 3’s 110 horizontal degrees. That means there are fairly large black borders around what you’re seeing, a bit like you’re looking through binoculars. On top of that, there’s a little bit of distortion and vignetting around the edges of the lenses, and you’ll see some green and pink color fringing at the edges as well, especially in bright environments. All of this makes the usable field of view feel even smaller. If you’re looking at something bright or otherwise high contrast — a white text window floating above a dark desert landscape, for example — you’ll see highlights reflecting in the lenses. A screen capture from the Vision Pro and a simulated view of what it feels like to look in the headset. I asked Apple about all of this, and yep — that’s how it’s supposed to look. Apple spokesperson Jacqueline Roy told me that a combination of hardware and software in the Vision Pro is specifically designed to minimize these various effects, but they’re definitely in there, and you’ll see them. If you have been paying attention to VR for the past decade, you know that these are very familiar VR headset display issues. You’re passing light from a screen through lenses mounted on someone’s face and trying to line those lenses up with their eyes, which are notably in different spots on different people’s faces. (Our bodies are designed very badly when it comes to mounting hardware on them.) So a little weirdness at the edges of the displays is not a deal-breaker or even a surprise — except Apple is charging 3,499 for the Vision Pro and making it sound like these displays are perfect enough for you to casually wear this thing while folding laundry. I’m serious when I say the Vision Pro has the best video passthrough I’ve ever seen on the sharpest VR displays any normal person will ever come across. But you’re still constantly being reminded that you’re looking at video on screens, and reality is just a lot more interesting than that. There are vanishingly few contexts in reviewing consumer devices where anyone has to care about color gamuts — but if you want me to perceive reality through something, I’d like to see all the colors of the rainbow. This is the best anyone has ever made in there look, and it’s still not nearly as good as out here. Waiting. Watching. Ready to mess up your hair at a moment’s notice. Photo by Vjeran Pavic / The Vergenone Controls The other thing Apple is very proud of is the eye and hand tracking control system, which is light years beyond any other consumer hand or eye tracking systems out there. You look at things you want to control, you tap your fingers to control them, and that’s how you get around the entire interface. You’re not reaching out and touching things — it’s more like your eyes are the mouse, and your fingers are the button: you tap them together to click on what you’re looking at. The first few times you use hand and eye tracking on the Vision Pro, it’s awe-inspiring — it feels like a superpower. The Vision Pro’s external cameras just need to see your hands for it to work, and they can see your hands in a pretty large zone around your body. You can have them slung across the back of the couch, resting in your lap, up in the air with your elbows on a table, pretty much anywhere the cameras can see them. It actually takes a minute to realize you don’t have to gesture out in front of you with your hands in the air — and once you figure it out, it’s pretty fun to watch other people instinctively reach their hands up the first time they try the Vision Pro. But the next few times you use hand and eye tracking, it stops feeling like a superpower — and in some cases, it actively makes using the Vision Pro harder. It turns out that having to look at what you want to control is really quite distracting. Think about every other computer in your life: the input mechanism is independent of whatever you’re looking at. On a laptop, you can click on controls and use the keyboard while keeping your focus on a document. On a phone, you can do things like drag sliders in a photo editing app while keeping your eyes focused on what those changes are actually doing to your photo. The Vision Pro simply doesn’t work like that — you have to be looking at something in order to click on it, and that means you are constantly taking your attention away from whatever you’re working on to specifically look at the button you need to press next. I spent some time playing a lovely little game called Stitch that quickly became maddening because I kept looking away from the piece I wanted to move to the place I wanted to move it, which meant I wasn’t picking it up when I tapped my fingers. Reach out and touch faith. Photo by Vjeran Pavic / The Vergenone visionOS feels also designed for an eye tracking system that’s just slightly more precise than it actually is — a lot of controls are just a little too small and a little too close together to let you quickly bop around the system. You have to look, make sure you’re looking at the thing you want, and then tap, or you might end up clicking on the wrong thing. Sometimes the fastest way to select what you want is to look away entirely and try again. It works until it doesn’t. It’s magic until it’s not. Think about it like this: The keyboard and mouse on a Mac directly control the Mac. The click wheel on an iPod directly controlled the iPod. A lot of work has gone into making it feel like the multitouch screen on an iPhone directly controls the phone, and when it goes sideways, like when autocorrect fails or an app doesn’t register your taps, it’s not pleasant. Your eyes and hands aren’t directly controlling the Vision Pro: cameras are watching your eyes and hands and turning that into input, and sometimes the interpretation isn’t perfect. The best example of this is the hilarious on-screen keyboard, which you use by staring at each letter and pinching your fingers to select it or henpecking with two fingers at the floating keys in front of you. It’s not worth using for anything beyond entering a Wi-Fi password — for anything longer, you’ll want to use dictation or connect a Bluetooth keyboard. Why? So you can directly control the input. It’s not a given that the Vision Pro can always see your hands, either. There’s a pretty large bubble around the front of your body where the cameras can see your hands — it basically extends the length of your arms in a semicircle around the front of your body. But if you lean back in a chair with your arm at your side, it can’t see your hand. If you’re sitting at a table and your hands are on your legs, it might not see your hands. If you’re lying down in a dark room and the IR illuminators can’t reach your hands, the cameras might not be able to see them. If you’re simply standing up with your arms at your sides, it might not be able to see your hands if they drift too far backward. Photo by Vjeran Pavic / The Vergenone I recognize that it is fundamentally silly to complain about a hand tracking system needing to see your hands, and it is possible to navigate quite a lot of visionOS with Siri and dictation: you can manage apps, open different virtual immersions, and so on. If you squint, you can see a glimpse of how a computer that you use by talking to it and manipulating things in space might one day work. But right now, the limits are obvious. Using the Vision Pro makes you constantly aware of what you are looking at and where your hands are in a way that is unlike any other computer I’ve ever used. When it fails, it’s maddening. (Oddly, Apple’s newest watches can detect a pinching gesture, but there’s no ability to use those as control devices on the Vision Pro.) The flip side is that a system that’s constantly watching your hands for input tends to register a lot of extra inputs, which can be very funny. I talk through writing video scripts to make sure things flow, and I talk with my hands. So as I was writing the video script for this review in the Vision Pro, the system kept catching my hands moving and started scrolling and clicking on things by accident. I cracked up the first time I realized what was happening. But eventually, it meant that I took the Vision Pro off and wrote the rest of the script on my Mac, which only does things when I actually want it to. Just as with the displays, I think this is the best eye and hand tracking system anyone’s ever shipped. It really can feel like magic… until it doesn’t. And if you want people to do their computing in there, the input system needs to be absolutely rock solid. Personas I won’t go into that much detail on Apple’s deeply weird and extremely uncanny 3D persona system here — the best way to understand them is by watching the video review above, which features a FaceTime call between The Wall Street Journal’s Joanna Stern, Marques Brownlee, and me, all using our personas. To quote Marques, personas are really impressive and also really bad. You can see why Apple put the beta label on them; there’s a long way to go before using a persona on a call isn’t distracting at best and, at worst, extremely rude. I will say, Joanna’s persona accurately captured her reaction to personas in general here. Marques looks like he’s happy to welcome me into PlayStation Home. One small note: personas can show up whenever an app calls for a front-facing camera, so they work in basically everything. I used mine on a Google Meet call in Safari just fine, although the other people on the Meet call did not think it was fine at all. Spatial cameras I would not recommend shooting photos in the Vision Pro unless you really need to. Pressing the shutter button a single time delivers a 2560 x 2560 still, which works out to 6.5 megapixels. As far as I can tell, it’s always from the left main camera, which the EXIF data says has an 18mm f/2.0 lens. The photos look like 6.5-megapixel photos from a tiny camera sensor optimized for video, which is to say that they look pretty bad. Video is slightly better — the Vision Pro shoots 2200 x 2200 square videos at 30fps. They look a little better than the photos, but there’s still an awful lot of compression going on, and if you happen to watch them on anything but a Vision Pro, you’ll notice some barrel distortion as the camera moves around. None of this feels particularly important: I really can’t think of situations where I’d want to be taking video with the headset on since all these videos and screen captures come with a ton of excess motion from your head moving around. Also, you will look fundamentally ridiculous trying to take photos of your family with this thing on your face. I think it’s fair to assume most Vision Pro buyers also own iPhones, which take great videos, so whatever. One thing that is very convincing is taking spatial videos on the iPhone 15 Pro Max and watching them in 3D on the Vision Pro. I took some videos of my daughter at the zoo and around Christmas time, and like any dad, I could probably watch them over and over again forever. They play back in a sort of ghostly white haze, and the overall effect is incredibly bittersweet — you can relive a brief memory, but you’re alone in the headset and can’t share it with anyone else. The other problem is that, currently, you can choose to shoot iPhone video in spatial in 1080p at 30fps or at the full 4K resolution the phone supports but not both. For now, I’m going to stick with the higher-res video, but there’s going to come a time where shooting in spatial by default is the smart move, and that will be a real turning point. visionOS The Vision Pro runs visionOS, which Apple says is based on iPadOS, with a lot of customization around latency and vision to make it work for spatial computing. Starting with the iPad as a foundation represents an incredible head start for Apple — it’s taken years for Meta to build out all the features of the Android-based Quest OS and populate its app store, and it’s still mostly games. Apple gets to start with the full set of mature iPadOS features and most of the huge iPad app library. It’s funny to keep saying that the Vision Pro is an iPad for your face, but when it comes to the current set of apps, it’s also not totally wrong. Most of them work like iPad apps, and the homescreen comes preloaded with a folder labeled “compatible apps” that’s full of actual iPad apps. It’s hard to judge the app ecosystem for a product that has barely launched, but I feel totally comfortable judging the iPad app ecosystem at this point, and Apple shipping its own podcast and news apps as iPad apps on the Vision Pro feels like a sign in a lot of ways. Photo by Vjeran Pavic / The Vergenone There’s already controversy in the world of Vision Pro apps: some huge developers like Netflix, Spotify, and YouTube have decided to wait before allowing their apps to run on the Vision Pro and aren’t even allowing their iPad apps to run. As always, the open web serves as the pressure release valve for Apple developer politics, and Safari on the Vision Pro is a capable riff on iPad Safari: I watched Netflix in Safari and it worked without a hitch, although you can’t put the video in a nice environment like you can with the native apps. I also watched the NFL playoffs on YouTube TV in Safari on the Vision Pro, and it worked with a few minor hiccups, although it did keep asking me to confirm my location over and over again. The stranger thing is that Safari on the Vision Pro is pretty disconnected from web-based 3D experiences. Apple has made noise about supporting the WebXR standard, and there are flags in Safari’s advanced preferences to turn on support, but it’s pretty hit-or-miss in terms of actually working right now — it mostly does not. I asked about this, and Apple told me that it is actively contributing to WebXR and wants to “work with the community to help deliver great spatial computing experiences via the web.” So let’s give that one a minute and see how it goes. On the other hand, I asked Apple why the huge library of VR video on YouTube doesn’t work at all on the Vision Pro, and the company basically told me it wasn’t good enough to support, saying that “much of this content was created for devices that do not deliver a high-quality spatial experience” and that the company’s efforts were instead focused on “delivering the best spatial media experience possible including spatial photos and videos, Apple Immersive Video, and 3D movies available on Apple TV.” Translation: don’t hold your breath for YouTube VR support. Photo by Amelia Holowaty Krales / The Vergenone The really big difference between visionOS and iPadOS is that iPadOS has a lot of opinions about how you can arrange apps and how many apps you can run at a time, and visionOS is full-on free-floating window chaos. I love it. It is bananas. You can open as many apps as you want and put them anywhere you want in space. You can open windows in the kitchen, walk away from them and open some more in the living room, and then go back to the kitchen to find all your old windows waiting for you. Late one night, I made an art gallery of giant Safari windows in our office’s large open cafe area and walked around, looking at huge webpages for a while. I am telling you, it is wild. Sadly, visionOS doesn’t have any ability to share these windows or experiences with anyone else: two people in Vision Pro headsets sitting in the same room can’t see the same things floating in space at the same time. Apple tells me some enterprise developers are working on experiences with shared views, and you can mirror the view from one Vision Pro to another over FaceTime, but in the end, my big Safari art gallery only ever had one patron: me. It’s amazing you can do all of this, but it is also quite lonely to put things all over a space knowing no one else will ever really experience it. To move windows around, you just grab the bar at the bottom and put it wherever you want to in space. You can layer windows, you can put them directly above your head, you can put them on the floor — you can really just do whatever you want. To switch between them, you just look at the window you want and tap your fingers; inactive windows go slightly translucent, which means all kinds of things can be happening at once all over your space. On top of that, you can have apps from three different operating systems on-screen at the same time: native visionOS apps; iPad apps; and then you can also connect your Mac via Wi-Fi and have a whole Mac display with all the chaotic glory of macOS floating around in space. One area where visionOS has clear room to improve is window management. There’s no Exposé or Stage Manager to collect all your open windows in front of you or put them into preset arrangements, and the management that does exist is not exactly discoverable or intuitively laid out. You can tap and hold the X button in one app to hide all your other apps. If you want to hide everything, you double-click the digital crown on the headset itself. If you want to close all apps, you just ask Siri; if you want to quit a misbehaving app, you hold down the top button and the digital crown simultaneously to bring up a force quit window. It’s a lot of different ideas all at once. Once you figure out the moves, you can get around, but it takes a minute, and it means you’ll be thinking about window management more than any other iOS device I can think of and maybe even more than a Mac, which has four decades of window management ideas built into it. Photo by Amelia Holowaty Krales / The Vergenone Speaking of the Mac, I know a lot of people are excited about the idea of buying a Vision Pro just to put up giant virtual monitors. There’s good news and bad news about that. The good news is that Mac display sharing works really well, and Apple ecosystem tricks like Handoff and Continuity are pure magic in this context. You can copy on your Mac and paste in visionOS, and it just works. You can open your Mac display in visionOS and drag the mouse off the screen, and suddenly, your Mac’s keyboard and trackpad are controlling visionOS apps. It works just like it does between a Mac and an iPad. I found myself putting a virtual Mac display over my MacBook Pro’s screen and making it look like I had a 50-inch laptop to use Lightroom with — it’s awesome. There is a lot of very complicated display scaling going on behind the scenes here, but the easiest way to think about it is that you’re basically getting a 27-inch Retina display, like you’d find on an iMac or Studio Display. Your Mac thinks it’s connected to a 5K display with a resolution of 5120 x 2880, and it runs macOS at a 2:1 logical resolution of 2560 x 1440, just like a 5K display. (You can pick other resolutions, but the device warns you that they’ll be lower quality.) That virtual display is then streamed as a 4K 3560 x 2880 video to the Vision Pro, where you can just make it as big as you want. The upshot of all of this is that 4K content runs at a native 4K resolution — it has all the pixels to do it, just like an iMac — but you have a grand total of 2560 x 1440 to place windows in, regardless of how big you make the Mac display in space, and you’re not seeing a pixel-perfect 5K image. It is incredible that all of this works with just a single button click, but all that scaling complication also explains the bad news: you can only have a single Mac display in visionOS. You can’t have multiple Mac monitors floating in space. Maybe next time. Photo by Vjeran Pavic / The Vergenone One of the weirder things about visionOS (and the Vision Pro itself, really) is that there’s not a lot of true AR in the mix — as in, actual interaction between physical objects in your space and digital ones. After all these years of Apple talking about AR, I counted exactly three things in my entire time with the Vision Pro that offered a preview of the AR future. One: when you look at your Mac, the Vision Pro sometimes puts up a “connect display” button above it that starts screen sharing. Two: when you’re typing on a Bluetooth keyboard and look down at your hands, it puts a little text preview window above the keyboard so you can see what you’re typing. These are little features, yes, but they are some of the first true AR computing features that have ever shipped on a mainstream device, and they are an incredibly tantalizing glimpse of what might be possible. They also happen to be incredibly useful. The third AR thing I saw was the loading screen of Super Fruit Ninja, which allows you to throw a strawberry at a pig that’s running around on your floor. This seems slightly less historic. That’s more or less it. There’s not a lot of reality being augmented in the rest of visionOS. There’s an awful lot of what you might call mixed reality: virtual objects floating around in space with no connection to anything real. All those app windows floating around are doing so independently of the physical environment. And in the entertainment context, where Apple lets the Vision Pro fall back into being the VR headset it fundamentally is, it absolutely shines. Watching movies on the Vision Pro is a ton of fun, especially in the Apple TV app’s immersive movie theater that lets you pick where you want to sit. It’s also very cool to watch a movie in one of Apple’s virtual environments like Mount Hood and see the colors from the screen reflect onto the landscape or look around one of the Disney Plus environments like Avengers Tower. And movies themselves look great — the incredible quality of the Vision Pro’s displays is really obvious when you’re watching something. I watched far more of Top Gun: Maverick than I intended to just because it looked so good blown up to drive-in movie size, floating over a mountain. Photo by Amelia Holowaty Krales / The Vergenone Since the Vision Pro sends separate images to each eye, it can do true 3D movies — and Apple and its partners like Disney have already released quite a few. If you have a large Apple movie library, you get the 3D versions for free — you just choose 2D or 3D playback when you hit play. Apple is also making immersive versions of some of its Apple TV Plus shows, which basically means a 180ish-degree 3D video that feels like the best Google Cardboard demo of all time. I watched someone walk a tightrope in Adventure, and it was very convincing — but if you’ve never tried this before, I’d be careful that you get used to VR motion before diving into 3D videos. Apple has also promised immersive sports content, but sadly, I wasn’t able to try any of that yet. You can get pretty far making the argument that the Vision Pro is worth it simply as a very expensive TV — but after a while, the weight of it reminds you that this very nice TV is resting on your face. (I usually made it about 30 minutes to an hour before wanting a break.) It’s also a very expensive TV that doesn’t have HDMI inputs, so you’re limited to Apple’s gaming library, which feels deeply unfair. And unlike any other TV in your life, the Vision Pro can literally DRM your eyes — if you’re watching a movie in the Apple TV app or Disney Plus and go to take a screen capture, the content blacks out. It’s strange to experience a reality where big companies can block you from capturing what you see, even if all you’re trying to do is show people how cool it looks in a review. You can get around DRM screenshots on an iPhone by just taking a photo of the screen, but there’s no such off-ramp for the Vision Pro. Speaking of gaming, there aren’t any real VR games or fitness apps here — there’s nothing like Beat Saber or Red Matter or Population: One, all hit games on the Quest. Fitness, in particular, has helped the Quest reach a more mainstream market: Supernatural’s Chris Milk told me in 2021 that his user base is 50 / 50 men and women, 60 percent of whom are over 40. That led to Meta buying Supernatural outright because it was worried about Apple buying it first. Yet, there’s just nothing like that on the Vision Pro at launch, even though Apple is so focused on fitness and health across its other devices. I think it’s because the Vision Pro just doesn’t seem suited to those kinds of physical game experiences — it’s heavy, with that external battery, and it’s hard to see how some of these games would even work without controllers. Apple tells me that game developers working in Unity are hard at work porting over more games and that visionOS allows developers to come up with custom hand gestures, which might solve for some of the controller issues — I was able to try a prerelease version of Super Fruit Ninja that used a custom slashing gesture in a briefing, and it seemed to work well, but that was about it so far. One note about VR motion in the Vision Pro: it doesn’t really do anything to protect you from yourself. I am fairly comfortable in VR — my wife and I use Supernatural, and I went through a brief, delightful period of being absolutely addicted to Gran Turismo 7 VR on the PSVR 2. I am pretty aware of my limits in VR motion, and I can do most things without a problem. But the Vision Pro is so convincing and so unconcerned with whether you might have any limits that you can easily go too far too fast and get yourself a little queasy. I watched five minutes of Avatar: The Way of Water in 3D in Disney Plus — the Vision Pro is the first consumer device to support high frame rate movies in 3D! — and immediately needed to stop because the motion was just too much. I recommend early adopters go slowly and make sure you find your limits gently. That first bout of VR motion sickness is no joke. Wrap up The Vision Pro is an astounding product. It’s the sort of first-generation device only Apple can really make, from the incredible display and passthrough engineering, to the use of the whole ecosystem to make it so seamlessly useful, to even getting everyone to pretty much ignore the whole external battery situation. There’s a part of me that says the Vision Pro only exists because Apple is so incredibly capable, stocked with talent, and loaded with resources that the company simply went out and engineered the hell out of the hardest problems it could think of in order to find a challenge. That’s good! There are a lot of ideas in the Vision Pro, and they’re all executed with the kind of thoughtful intention that few other companies can ever deliver at all, let alone on the first iteration. But the shocking thing is that Apple may have inadvertently revealed that some of these core ideas are actually dead ends — that they can’t ever be executed well enough to become mainstream. This is the best video passthrough headset ever made, and that might mean camera-based mixed reality passthrough could just be a road to nowhere. This is the best hand- and eye-tracking ever, and it feels like the mouse, keyboard, and touchscreen are going to remain undefeated for years to come. There is so much technology in this thing that feels like magic when it works and frustrates you completely when it doesn’t. Photo by Amelia Holowaty Krales / The Vergenone The other way to look at the Vision Pro is that Apple knows all of this, but the technology to build the true AR glasses it has long hinted at is simply not there — so the Vision Pro represents something like a simulator or a developer kit. A dream factory for people to build apps and meaningful use cases for the imagined hardware yet to come: true optical AR glasses that let you share digital experiences with other people. In that framework, this Vision Pro is the hardware Apple can ship right now to get everyone thinking about these ideas while it pours all those resources into the hardware it wants to build. Maybe! It’s fun to think about that possibility, and a lot of people have already assumed that’s the case. But one of the oldest rules we have here at The Verge is that you have to review what’s in the box — the product that’s shipping today, not the promise of improvements yet to come. And so I keep coming back to all the questions I’ve been asking myself ever since I first strapped the Vision Pro onto my head. Starting, of course, with the most important: Do you want a computer that messes up your hair every time you use it? Do you want a computer that smears your makeup every time you use it, if you wear makeup? Do you want a computer that allows the Walt Disney Company to prevent you from taking pictures of what you see? Do you want to use a computer where you easily can’t show anyone else what you’re looking at? Do you think the fanciest TV you own should have HDMI inputs? Do you want to use a computer that doesn’t work as well in a dark room? Do you want to use a computer that is always looking at your hands? That is a lot of tradeoffs — big tradeoffs, not little ones. And the biggest tradeoff of all is that using the Vision Pro is such a lonely experience, regardless of the weird ghost eyes on the front. You’re in there, having experiences all by yourself that no one else can take part in. After using the Vision Pro for a while, I’ve come to agree with what Tim Cook has been saying for so long: headsets are inherently isolating. That’s fine for traditional VR headsets, which have basically turned into single-use game consoles over the past decade, but it’s a lot weirder for a primary computing device. I don’t want to get work done in the Vision Pro. I get my work done with other people, and I’d rather be out here with them.","output":"Apple Vision Pro is impressive but has major drawbacks."},{"instruction":"Read the article below and summarize the key takeaways in 80 characters or less. 80 characters is the number of characters in Hangul, excluding spaces.

Apple Vision Pro review: magic, until it’s not The Apple Vision Pro is the best consumer headset anyone’s ever made — and that’s the problem. Nilay PatelJan 30, 2024 at 11:00 PM GMT+9 There’s a lot of pressure on the new Apple Vision Pro, Apple’s long-awaited entry into the world of computers you wear on your face. Apple claims that the Vision Pro, which starts at 3,499, is the beginning of something called “spatial computing,” which basically boils down to running apps all around you. And the company’s ads for it do not hedge that pressure even a little: they show people wearing the Vision Pro all the time. At work! Doing laundry! Playing with their kids! The ambition is enormous: to layer apps and information over the real world — to augment reality. Apple has to claim that the Vision Pro is the beginning of something new because people have been building headset computers for over a decade now. I tried on a development prototype of the first Oculus Rift in 2013, and The Verge’s Adi Robertson, who edited this review, has tried basically every headset that’s been released since. All of that development means there are some pretty good products out there: that first Oculus evolved into the Quest line at Meta, which is now shipping the Quest 3 — a very good VR headset with a huge library of games and some AR features of its own, which costs 500. 7Verge Score 3499 at Apple How we rate and review products In the meantime, Apple, from Tim Cook on down, has largely insisted that augmented reality will be much more valuable than virtual reality. And it’s been building toward AR for a long time: developers have access to AR tools in iOS, and higher-end iPhones and iPads have had lidar depth scanners for a few years now. The Vision Pro is Apple’s first attempt at building a computer out of all those ideas — a computer that works in the space around you. The goal is for the Vision Pro to be a complete device that can sit right alongside the Mac and the iPad in Apple’s ecosystem of devices and let you get real work done. You can use Excel and Webex and Slack in the Vision Pro, and you can also sit back and watch movies and TV shows on a gigantic virtual 4K HDR display. And you can mirror your Mac’s display and just use the Vision Pro to look at a huge monitor floating in virtual space. It sounds amazing, and sometimes it is. But the Vision Pro also represents a series of really big tradeoffs — tradeoffs that are impossible to ignore. Some of those tradeoffs are very tangible: getting all this tech in a headset means there’s a lot of weight on your face, so Apple chose to use an external battery pack connected by a cable. But there are other, more philosophical tradeoffs as well. As I’ve been using it for the past few days, I kept coming up with a series of questions — questions about whether the tradeoffs were worth it. Is using the Vision Pro so good that I’m willing to mess up my hair every time I put it on? Is it so good that I want to lug it around in its giant carrying case instead of my laptop bag? Is it so good that I want to look at the world around me through screens instead of with my own eyes? Basically, I keep asking if I prefer using a computer in there rather than out here. And as interesting as the Vision Pro is, there’s a long way to go before it can beat out here. Photo by Vjeran Pavic / The Vergenone Hardware Apple doesn’t want anyone to think of the Vision Pro as a VR headset, but it’s a VR headset — albeit a VR headset that almost lets you pretend it’s not a VR headset. You put it on your head in a way that blocks out your vision entirely, and then it shows you a 3D video feed of the world around you passed through from the cameras on the front, as though you can see right through the device. But it can also put you in virtual reality, at various levels of immersion: I spent some time working entirely on the Moon and a lot of time in my kitchen with a bunch of windows floating around a portal into Joshua Tree. The Vision Pro is stunning compared to other VR headsets, which are largely plastic and often downright goofy-looking. The Vision Pro, by contrast, is built of magnesium and carbon fiber in an aluminum enclosure that feels like a natural extension of Apple’s familiar design language. There’s a little iPhone 6 in there, a little AirPods Max, a little Apple Watch. It is the cutting edge of technology in a package that seems instantly familiar. Almost everyone I’ve shown it to thinks it looks smaller in person than they expected, especially compared to some of the huge VR headsets we’ve seen over the past decade. The front display on the Vision Pro is an attempt at keeping you from being isolated from other people while you’re wearing it. In Apple’s photos, it looks like a big, bright screen that shows a video of your eyes to people around you so they feel comfortable talking to you while you’re wearing the headset — a feature adorably called EyeSight. In reality, it might as well not be there. It’s a low-res OLED with a lenticular panel in front of it to provide a mild 3D effect, and it’s so dim and the cover glass is so reflective, it’s actually hard to see in most normal to bright lighting. When people do see your eyes, it’s a low-res, ghostly image of them that feels like CGI. The effect is uncanny — the idea that you’ll be making real eye contact with anyone is a fantasy. And there are no controls or indicators in visionOS for this external display, so you never really know what other people are seeing. Imagine looking someone directly in the eyes and talking to them without knowing if they can see your eyes — it’s weird! EyeSight is so weird. So, so weird. Photo by Amelia Holowaty Krales / The Vergenone That cover glass hides a huge array of cameras and sensors. There’s a pair of high-res front cameras for the video passthrough, cameras that face down and to the sides to track your hands, a lidar scanner and TrueDepth cameras for spatial tracking, and infrared floodlights so everything can work in low light. Underneath all that, you’ve got an M2 processor and Apple’s new R1 spatial coprocessor and a pair of fans to move the heat from all this tech out the top. The fans were never perceptible during my time testing the Vision Pro, but the heat was: after long sessions, the headset was definitely warm. On the top edge, you’ll find what feel like larger versions of some familiar Apple Watch controls: a digital crown that adjusts both the volume and the level of virtual reality immersion on the right as you look through the headset and a button on the left that lets you take 3D photos and videos. You get two headbands in the box: the solo knit band and the dual loop band. They both attach and detach easily; you snap them right on and then pull the little orange tab to disconnect them. The solo band is unquestionably cooler and messes up your hair slightly less — but they both mess up your hair, so if the dual loop fits you better, just go with it. I found the solo loop much more comfortable; I also wish the mounting points were on the outside face so I could pull the band around my head and clip it on instead of constantly pulling it over my hair. The front of the Vision Pro is covered in cameras and sensors. Photo by Vjeran Pavic / The Vergenone The solo loop is by far the cooler strap. Photo by Amelia Holowaty Krales / The Vergenone The huge case costs an additional 199 and looks like a marshmallow from space. I love it. Photo by Amelia Holowaty Krales / The Vergenone The other two pieces are the light seal, which comes in various sizes, and the headband, which comes in two thicknesses. (You get fitted for these in the store or by scanning your head with an iPhone if you buy online.) Both attach magnetically, which means they also detach magnetically — you want to pick this thing up by the frame because grabbing it by the light seal can lead to disaster. If you have glasses, you can click in custom Zeiss lens inserts — Apple sent us reader lenses to see what that process looks like, but I just used the Vision Pro while wearing my soft contacts, and it was fine. The Vision Pro’s speakers are housed in the arms on the side, and they are good and loud and do a convincing job of rendering spatial audio. Things really sound like they are happening where they appear to be happening, which is a neat trick. The speakers are also pretty leaky, so everyone else around you can hear what you’re up to unless you use headphones. You can use any Bluetooth headphones you want, but you get a bunch of extra features if you use the latest AirPods Pro, like lower latency, lossless 48KHz audio, and Apple’s Adaptive Audio system, which automatically mixes in sound from the real world as appropriate. Since you’ll mostly experience the Vision Pro in there, the most noticeable thing about the hardware after a while is that it’s just… heavy. You’re supposed to wear this thing on your face for long stretches of computer time, and depending on which band and light seal you use, the headset alone weighs between 600 and 650 grams. I keep joking that the Vision Pro is an iPad for your face, but it’s heavier than an 11-inch iPad Pro (470 grams) and pushing close to a 12.9-inch iPad Pro (682 grams), so in a very real way, it’s an iPad for your face. All of the Vision Pro’s heft is totally front-loaded, too. Other big headsets like the Quest Pro (722 grams) have elaborate headbands to balance out their weight, but the Vision Pro just rests it all on the front. Swapping to the dual loop strap helps keep things more stable but doesn’t really reduce the overall sensation of having all that headset on your face. You’re just going to feel it after a while. The Vision Pro’s external battery pack is fine, mostly because it’s such a stationary device overall. Photo by Vjeran Pavic / The Vergenone Notably, the Vision Pro is substantially heavier than the familiar Quest 2 (503g) or even the heavier Quest 3 (515g) — headsets that have built-in batteries. Apple told me that it chose to use an external battery specifically to reduce the headset’s weight. The battery itself is barely worth talking about — it’s a silver brick that weighs another 353 grams with a USB-C port and a motion-activated LED that’s green when it’s charged and orange when it’s not. It connects to the headset with a satisfying twist connector, but the nice braided cable is permanently attached to the battery itself, so don’t break it. You can buy extra batteries for 199, but you can’t hot-swap them; disconnecting the battery from the Vision Pro cuts the power entirely. I don’t really have strong opinions on this battery setup, which is mostly because nothing about the Vision Pro feels like you’re supposed to move around that much in it, so it’s more or less fine. It’s funny that Apple of all companies shipped this compromise, but it’s also very Apple that the battery is not actually bigger so it can provide more than two and a half hours of run time. (If you plug the battery in, the Vision Pro just runs on wall power for as long as you want.) Setting up the Vision Pro is dead simple — the headband adjustments are the only manual adjustments involved. Everything else is motorized and sensor-driven. There’s no fiddly lens wheel to dial in; the headset asks you to hold down the digital crown when you first put it on to adjust the lenses to your eyes, and then you go through a pretty standard eye tracking setup. The rest of the setup is almost exactly like any other iOS device: if you have an iPhone, you can bring it close to the Vision Pro to send over all your settings, and you have to agree to some terms and conditions. If you don’t have an iPhone, you’ll have to enter your passwords and so on manually, but it’ll work fine as a standalone device. After all of that, you’re computing in the future. See? It’s a VR headset. Photo by Vjeran Pavic / The Vergenone Apple is very proud of the displays inside the Vision Pro, and for good reason — they represent a huge leap forward in display technology. The two displays are tiny MicroOLEDs with a total of 23 million pixels that are just 7.5 micrometers in size, which is about the size of a red blood cell. And each of those tiny pixels is composed of three RGB subpixels laid out in what Apple tells me is an S-stripe pattern. Just thinking about the level of precision required to make these displays and then make them work in a device like this is mind-blowing. They also look generally incredible — sharp enough to read text on without even thinking about it, bright enough to do justice to movies. Apple calibrates them for color at the factory so they are also vibrant and color-accurate without looking oversaturated or blown out. They are so small, but they work so well that they seem huge. The displays are the main reason the Vision Pro is so expensive — they’re at the heart of the Vision Pro experience and what makes the whole thing work. You are always looking at them, after all. But for all their technical marvels, they are not without tradeoffs of their own when deployed on a device like this. The speakers are nice and loud and convincing with spatial audio. Photo by Vjeran Pavic / The Vergenone See this thing — a passthrough VR headset with a silly external battery pack and a display that shows ghostly images of your eyes on the front — is not the big goal. The big goal is AR, or augmented reality. In particular, the big goal is optical AR, where light passes directly through unobtrusive glasses to your eyes, with digital information layered over the top of what you’re seeing. AR is a technology with the potential to literally change humanity, and Apple CEO Tim Cook has been talking about how isolating VR headsets are and how important he thinks AR will be for years now. Tim Cook, 2016: “Few people are going to view that it’s acceptable to be enclosed in something.” Tim Cook, 2017: “Unlike Virtual Reality which closes the world out, AR allows individuals to be present in the world.” Tim Cook, 2017: “I also like the fact that [AR] doesn’t isolate [...] I’ve never been a fan of VR like that because I think it does the opposite.” Tim Cook, 2020: “I think [AR is] something that doesn’t isolate people. We can use it to enhance our discussion, not substitute it for human connection, which I’ve always deeply worried about in some of the other technologies.” The problem is that the technology to build a true optical AR display that works well enough to replace an everyday computer just isn’t there yet. The Magic Leap 2 is an optical AR headset that’s cheaper and smaller than the Vision Pro, but it’s plagued by compromises in field of view and image quality that most people would never accept. So Apple’s settled for building a headset with real-time video passthrough — it is the defining tradeoff of the Vision Pro. It is a VR headset masquerading as an AR headset. And let me tell you: the video passthrough on the Vision Pro is really good. It works! It’s convincing. You put the headset on, the display comes on, and you’re right back where you were, only with a bunch of visionOS windows floating around. It sounds simple, but it is an astonishing engineering achievement to do that in real time, at high resolution, in a computer that fits over your eyes. Apple claims there’s only 12ms of latency between what the cameras see and what’s on the display, and that latency includes the exposure time of the cameras themselves. The actual data processing is faster. Do the math, and Apple says there’s not even a frame’s worth of latency; the next frame of video is ready before you’re done looking at the last one. Still cameras, still displays. Photo by Vjeran Pavic / The Vergenone You can also see Apple’s incredible video processing chops right in front of your eyes: I sat around scrolling on my phone while wearing the Vision Pro, with no blown-out screens or weird frame rate issues. I also worked on my Mac in front of a large window while wearing the headset, which is a torture test for dynamic range, and while it wasn’t perfect, it was still usable. It is the best video passthrough that’s ever shipped in a consumer device by far. The problem is that cameras are still cameras, and displays are still displays. All cameras have motion blur, for example. In low light, cameras either have to increase exposure times at the cost of sharpness or increase ISO at the cost of noise, which then requires noise reduction, which makes things blurry and dull. And cameras and displays both have real limits in terms of color reproduction. The Vision Pro cannot overcome the inherent nature of cameras and displays. You can easily see motion blur when you move your head in the Vision Pro — motion blur that increases in low light and leads to some weird warping of straight lines. Low light also causes the overall sharpness of the video passthrough to drop as noise reduction kicks in: my iPhone screen got noticeably blurrier when the sun set. If you’re in a medium-lit room halfway immersed in a dark virtual environment with a bright window open — say, sitting in your kitchen at night with the lights on while writing a review in a Google Docs window floating on a dark beach — you will notice the display brightness slowly ramp up and down as the system tries to average out the brightness of everything you’re looking at. The LCD clock on my microwave flickers when I look at it through these cameras. And Apple’s specs say the display supports 92 percent of the DCI-P3 color gamut, which means the Vision Pro can only show you 49 percent of the colors your eyes can actually see. The displays have other limitations: the field of view isn’t huge, and the essential nature of looking at tiny displays through lenses makes that field of view feel even smaller. Apple won’t tell me the exact number, but the Vision Pro’s field of view is certainly smaller than the Quest 3’s 110 horizontal degrees. That means there are fairly large black borders around what you’re seeing, a bit like you’re looking through binoculars. On top of that, there’s a little bit of distortion and vignetting around the edges of the lenses, and you’ll see some green and pink color fringing at the edges as well, especially in bright environments. All of this makes the usable field of view feel even smaller. If you’re looking at something bright or otherwise high contrast — a white text window floating above a dark desert landscape, for example — you’ll see highlights reflecting in the lenses. A screen capture from the Vision Pro and a simulated view of what it feels like to look in the headset. I asked Apple about all of this, and yep — that’s how it’s supposed to look. Apple spokesperson Jacqueline Roy told me that a combination of hardware and software in the Vision Pro is specifically designed to minimize these various effects, but they’re definitely in there, and you’ll see them. If you have been paying attention to VR for the past decade, you know that these are very familiar VR headset display issues. You’re passing light from a screen through lenses mounted on someone’s face and trying to line those lenses up with their eyes, which are notably in different spots on different people’s faces. (Our bodies are designed very badly when it comes to mounting hardware on them.) So a little weirdness at the edges of the displays is not a deal-breaker or even a surprise — except Apple is charging 3,499 for the Vision Pro and making it sound like these displays are perfect enough for you to casually wear this thing while folding laundry. I’m serious when I say the Vision Pro has the best video passthrough I’ve ever seen on the sharpest VR displays any normal person will ever come across. But you’re still constantly being reminded that you’re looking at video on screens, and reality is just a lot more interesting than that. There are vanishingly few contexts in reviewing consumer devices where anyone has to care about color gamuts — but if you want me to perceive reality through something, I’d like to see all the colors of the rainbow. This is the best anyone has ever made in there look, and it’s still not nearly as good as out here. Waiting. Watching. Ready to mess up your hair at a moment’s notice. Photo by Vjeran Pavic / The Vergenone Controls The other thing Apple is very proud of is the eye and hand tracking control system, which is light years beyond any other consumer hand or eye tracking systems out there. You look at things you want to control, you tap your fingers to control them, and that’s how you get around the entire interface. You’re not reaching out and touching things — it’s more like your eyes are the mouse, and your fingers are the button: you tap them together to click on what you’re looking at. The first few times you use hand and eye tracking on the Vision Pro, it’s awe-inspiring — it feels like a superpower. The Vision Pro’s external cameras just need to see your hands for it to work, and they can see your hands in a pretty large zone around your body. You can have them slung across the back of the couch, resting in your lap, up in the air with your elbows on a table, pretty much anywhere the cameras can see them. It actually takes a minute to realize you don’t have to gesture out in front of you with your hands in the air — and once you figure it out, it’s pretty fun to watch other people instinctively reach their hands up the first time they try the Vision Pro. But the next few times you use hand and eye tracking, it stops feeling like a superpower — and in some cases, it actively makes using the Vision Pro harder. It turns out that having to look at what you want to control is really quite distracting. Think about every other computer in your life: the input mechanism is independent of whatever you’re looking at. On a laptop, you can click on controls and use the keyboard while keeping your focus on a document. On a phone, you can do things like drag sliders in a photo editing app while keeping your eyes focused on what those changes are actually doing to your photo. The Vision Pro simply doesn’t work like that — you have to be looking at something in order to click on it, and that means you are constantly taking your attention away from whatever you’re working on to specifically look at the button you need to press next. I spent some time playing a lovely little game called Stitch that quickly became maddening because I kept looking away from the piece I wanted to move to the place I wanted to move it, which meant I wasn’t picking it up when I tapped my fingers. Reach out and touch faith. Photo by Vjeran Pavic / The Vergenone visionOS feels also designed for an eye tracking system that’s just slightly more precise than it actually is — a lot of controls are just a little too small and a little too close together to let you quickly bop around the system. You have to look, make sure you’re looking at the thing you want, and then tap, or you might end up clicking on the wrong thing. Sometimes the fastest way to select what you want is to look away entirely and try again. It works until it doesn’t. It’s magic until it’s not. Think about it like this: The keyboard and mouse on a Mac directly control the Mac. The click wheel on an iPod directly controlled the iPod. A lot of work has gone into making it feel like the multitouch screen on an iPhone directly controls the phone, and when it goes sideways, like when autocorrect fails or an app doesn’t register your taps, it’s not pleasant. Your eyes and hands aren’t directly controlling the Vision Pro: cameras are watching your eyes and hands and turning that into input, and sometimes the interpretation isn’t perfect. The best example of this is the hilarious on-screen keyboard, which you use by staring at each letter and pinching your fingers to select it or henpecking with two fingers at the floating keys in front of you. It’s not worth using for anything beyond entering a Wi-Fi password — for anything longer, you’ll want to use dictation or connect a Bluetooth keyboard. Why? So you can directly control the input. It’s not a given that the Vision Pro can always see your hands, either. There’s a pretty large bubble around the front of your body where the cameras can see your hands — it basically extends the length of your arms in a semicircle around the front of your body. But if you lean back in a chair with your arm at your side, it can’t see your hand. If you’re sitting at a table and your hands are on your legs, it might not see your hands. If you’re lying down in a dark room and the IR illuminators can’t reach your hands, the cameras might not be able to see them. If you’re simply standing up with your arms at your sides, it might not be able to see your hands if they drift too far backward. Photo by Vjeran Pavic / The Vergenone I recognize that it is fundamentally silly to complain about a hand tracking system needing to see your hands, and it is possible to navigate quite a lot of visionOS with Siri and dictation: you can manage apps, open different virtual immersions, and so on. If you squint, you can see a glimpse of how a computer that you use by talking to it and manipulating things in space might one day work. But right now, the limits are obvious. Using the Vision Pro makes you constantly aware of what you are looking at and where your hands are in a way that is unlike any other computer I’ve ever used. When it fails, it’s maddening. (Oddly, Apple’s newest watches can detect a pinching gesture, but there’s no ability to use those as control devices on the Vision Pro.) The flip side is that a system that’s constantly watching your hands for input tends to register a lot of extra inputs, which can be very funny. I talk through writing video scripts to make sure things flow, and I talk with my hands. So as I was writing the video script for this review in the Vision Pro, the system kept catching my hands moving and started scrolling and clicking on things by accident. I cracked up the first time I realized what was happening. But eventually, it meant that I took the Vision Pro off and wrote the rest of the script on my Mac, which only does things when I actually want it to. Just as with the displays, I think this is the best eye and hand tracking system anyone’s ever shipped. It really can feel like magic… until it doesn’t. And if you want people to do their computing in there, the input system needs to be absolutely rock solid. Personas I won’t go into that much detail on Apple’s deeply weird and extremely uncanny 3D persona system here — the best way to understand them is by watching the video review above, which features a FaceTime call between The Wall Street Journal’s Joanna Stern, Marques Brownlee, and me, all using our personas. To quote Marques, personas are really impressive and also really bad. You can see why Apple put the beta label on them; there’s a long way to go before using a persona on a call isn’t distracting at best and, at worst, extremely rude. I will say, Joanna’s persona accurately captured her reaction to personas in general here. Marques looks like he’s happy to welcome me into PlayStation Home. One small note: personas can show up whenever an app calls for a front-facing camera, so they work in basically everything. I used mine on a Google Meet call in Safari just fine, although the other people on the Meet call did not think it was fine at all. Spatial cameras I would not recommend shooting photos in the Vision Pro unless you really need to. Pressing the shutter button a single time delivers a 2560 x 2560 still, which works out to 6.5 megapixels. As far as I can tell, it’s always from the left main camera, which the EXIF data says has an 18mm f/2.0 lens. The photos look like 6.5-megapixel photos from a tiny camera sensor optimized for video, which is to say that they look pretty bad. Video is slightly better — the Vision Pro shoots 2200 x 2200 square videos at 30fps. They look a little better than the photos, but there’s still an awful lot of compression going on, and if you happen to watch them on anything but a Vision Pro, you’ll notice some barrel distortion as the camera moves around. None of this feels particularly important: I really can’t think of situations where I’d want to be taking video with the headset on since all these videos and screen captures come with a ton of excess motion from your head moving around. Also, you will look fundamentally ridiculous trying to take photos of your family with this thing on your face. I think it’s fair to assume most Vision Pro buyers also own iPhones, which take great videos, so whatever. One thing that is very convincing is taking spatial videos on the iPhone 15 Pro Max and watching them in 3D on the Vision Pro. I took some videos of my daughter at the zoo and around Christmas time, and like any dad, I could probably watch them over and over again forever. They play back in a sort of ghostly white haze, and the overall effect is incredibly bittersweet — you can relive a brief memory, but you’re alone in the headset and can’t share it with anyone else. The other problem is that, currently, you can choose to shoot iPhone video in spatial in 1080p at 30fps or at the full 4K resolution the phone supports but not both. For now, I’m going to stick with the higher-res video, but there’s going to come a time where shooting in spatial by default is the smart move, and that will be a real turning point. visionOS The Vision Pro runs visionOS, which Apple says is based on iPadOS, with a lot of customization around latency and vision to make it work for spatial computing. Starting with the iPad as a foundation represents an incredible head start for Apple — it’s taken years for Meta to build out all the features of the Android-based Quest OS and populate its app store, and it’s still mostly games. Apple gets to start with the full set of mature iPadOS features and most of the huge iPad app library. It’s funny to keep saying that the Vision Pro is an iPad for your face, but when it comes to the current set of apps, it’s also not totally wrong. Most of them work like iPad apps, and the homescreen comes preloaded with a folder labeled “compatible apps” that’s full of actual iPad apps. It’s hard to judge the app ecosystem for a product that has barely launched, but I feel totally comfortable judging the iPad app ecosystem at this point, and Apple shipping its own podcast and news apps as iPad apps on the Vision Pro feels like a sign in a lot of ways. Photo by Vjeran Pavic / The Vergenone There’s already controversy in the world of Vision Pro apps: some huge developers like Netflix, Spotify, and YouTube have decided to wait before allowing their apps to run on the Vision Pro and aren’t even allowing their iPad apps to run. As always, the open web serves as the pressure release valve for Apple developer politics, and Safari on the Vision Pro is a capable riff on iPad Safari: I watched Netflix in Safari and it worked without a hitch, although you can’t put the video in a nice environment like you can with the native apps. I also watched the NFL playoffs on YouTube TV in Safari on the Vision Pro, and it worked with a few minor hiccups, although it did keep asking me to confirm my location over and over again. The stranger thing is that Safari on the Vision Pro is pretty disconnected from web-based 3D experiences. Apple has made noise about supporting the WebXR standard, and there are flags in Safari’s advanced preferences to turn on support, but it’s pretty hit-or-miss in terms of actually working right now — it mostly does not. I asked about this, and Apple told me that it is actively contributing to WebXR and wants to “work with the community to help deliver great spatial computing experiences via the web.” So let’s give that one a minute and see how it goes. On the other hand, I asked Apple why the huge library of VR video on YouTube doesn’t work at all on the Vision Pro, and the company basically told me it wasn’t good enough to support, saying that “much of this content was created for devices that do not deliver a high-quality spatial experience” and that the company’s efforts were instead focused on “delivering the best spatial media experience possible including spatial photos and videos, Apple Immersive Video, and 3D movies available on Apple TV.” Translation: don’t hold your breath for YouTube VR support. Photo by Amelia Holowaty Krales / The Vergenone The really big difference between visionOS and iPadOS is that iPadOS has a lot of opinions about how you can arrange apps and how many apps you can run at a time, and visionOS is full-on free-floating window chaos. I love it. It is bananas. You can open as many apps as you want and put them anywhere you want in space. You can open windows in the kitchen, walk away from them and open some more in the living room, and then go back to the kitchen to find all your old windows waiting for you. Late one night, I made an art gallery of giant Safari windows in our office’s large open cafe area and walked around, looking at huge webpages for a while. I am telling you, it is wild. Sadly, visionOS doesn’t have any ability to share these windows or experiences with anyone else: two people in Vision Pro headsets sitting in the same room can’t see the same things floating in space at the same time. Apple tells me some enterprise developers are working on experiences with shared views, and you can mirror the view from one Vision Pro to another over FaceTime, but in the end, my big Safari art gallery only ever had one patron: me. It’s amazing you can do all of this, but it is also quite lonely to put things all over a space knowing no one else will ever really experience it. To move windows around, you just grab the bar at the bottom and put it wherever you want to in space. You can layer windows, you can put them directly above your head, you can put them on the floor — you can really just do whatever you want. To switch between them, you just look at the window you want and tap your fingers; inactive windows go slightly translucent, which means all kinds of things can be happening at once all over your space. On top of that, you can have apps from three different operating systems on-screen at the same time: native visionOS apps; iPad apps; and then you can also connect your Mac via Wi-Fi and have a whole Mac display with all the chaotic glory of macOS floating around in space. One area where visionOS has clear room to improve is window management. There’s no Exposé or Stage Manager to collect all your open windows in front of you or put them into preset arrangements, and the management that does exist is not exactly discoverable or intuitively laid out. You can tap and hold the X button in one app to hide all your other apps. If you want to hide everything, you double-click the digital crown on the headset itself. If you want to close all apps, you just ask Siri; if you want to quit a misbehaving app, you hold down the top button and the digital crown simultaneously to bring up a force quit window. It’s a lot of different ideas all at once. Once you figure out the moves, you can get around, but it takes a minute, and it means you’ll be thinking about window management more than any other iOS device I can think of and maybe even more than a Mac, which has four decades of window management ideas built into it. Photo by Amelia Holowaty Krales / The Vergenone Speaking of the Mac, I know a lot of people are excited about the idea of buying a Vision Pro just to put up giant virtual monitors. There’s good news and bad news about that. The good news is that Mac display sharing works really well, and Apple ecosystem tricks like Handoff and Continuity are pure magic in this context. You can copy on your Mac and paste in visionOS, and it just works. You can open your Mac display in visionOS and drag the mouse off the screen, and suddenly, your Mac’s keyboard and trackpad are controlling visionOS apps. It works just like it does between a Mac and an iPad. I found myself putting a virtual Mac display over my MacBook Pro’s screen and making it look like I had a 50-inch laptop to use Lightroom with — it’s awesome. There is a lot of very complicated display scaling going on behind the scenes here, but the easiest way to think about it is that you’re basically getting a 27-inch Retina display, like you’d find on an iMac or Studio Display. Your Mac thinks it’s connected to a 5K display with a resolution of 5120 x 2880, and it runs macOS at a 2:1 logical resolution of 2560 x 1440, just like a 5K display. (You can pick other resolutions, but the device warns you that they’ll be lower quality.) That virtual display is then streamed as a 4K 3560 x 2880 video to the Vision Pro, where you can just make it as big as you want. The upshot of all of this is that 4K content runs at a native 4K resolution — it has all the pixels to do it, just like an iMac — but you have a grand total of 2560 x 1440 to place windows in, regardless of how big you make the Mac display in space, and you’re not seeing a pixel-perfect 5K image. It is incredible that all of this works with just a single button click, but all that scaling complication also explains the bad news: you can only have a single Mac display in visionOS. You can’t have multiple Mac monitors floating in space. Maybe next time. Photo by Vjeran Pavic / The Vergenone One of the weirder things about visionOS (and the Vision Pro itself, really) is that there’s not a lot of true AR in the mix — as in, actual interaction between physical objects in your space and digital ones. After all these years of Apple talking about AR, I counted exactly three things in my entire time with the Vision Pro that offered a preview of the AR future. One: when you look at your Mac, the Vision Pro sometimes puts up a “connect display” button above it that starts screen sharing. Two: when you’re typing on a Bluetooth keyboard and look down at your hands, it puts a little text preview window above the keyboard so you can see what you’re typing. These are little features, yes, but they are some of the first true AR computing features that have ever shipped on a mainstream device, and they are an incredibly tantalizing glimpse of what might be possible. They also happen to be incredibly useful. The third AR thing I saw was the loading screen of Super Fruit Ninja, which allows you to throw a strawberry at a pig that’s running around on your floor. This seems slightly less historic. That’s more or less it. There’s not a lot of reality being augmented in the rest of visionOS. There’s an awful lot of what you might call mixed reality: virtual objects floating around in space with no connection to anything real. All those app windows floating around are doing so independently of the physical environment. And in the entertainment context, where Apple lets the Vision Pro fall back into being the VR headset it fundamentally is, it absolutely shines. Watching movies on the Vision Pro is a ton of fun, especially in the Apple TV app’s immersive movie theater that lets you pick where you want to sit. It’s also very cool to watch a movie in one of Apple’s virtual environments like Mount Hood and see the colors from the screen reflect onto the landscape or look around one of the Disney Plus environments like Avengers Tower. And movies themselves look great — the incredible quality of the Vision Pro’s displays is really obvious when you’re watching something. I watched far more of Top Gun: Maverick than I intended to just because it looked so good blown up to drive-in movie size, floating over a mountain. Photo by Amelia Holowaty Krales / The Vergenone Since the Vision Pro sends separate images to each eye, it can do true 3D movies — and Apple and its partners like Disney have already released quite a few. If you have a large Apple movie library, you get the 3D versions for free — you just choose 2D or 3D playback when you hit play. Apple is also making immersive versions of some of its Apple TV Plus shows, which basically means a 180ish-degree 3D video that feels like the best Google Cardboard demo of all time. I watched someone walk a tightrope in Adventure, and it was very convincing — but if you’ve never tried this before, I’d be careful that you get used to VR motion before diving into 3D videos. Apple has also promised immersive sports content, but sadly, I wasn’t able to try any of that yet. You can get pretty far making the argument that the Vision Pro is worth it simply as a very expensive TV — but after a while, the weight of it reminds you that this very nice TV is resting on your face. (I usually made it about 30 minutes to an hour before wanting a break.) It’s also a very expensive TV that doesn’t have HDMI inputs, so you’re limited to Apple’s gaming library, which feels deeply unfair. And unlike any other TV in your life, the Vision Pro can literally DRM your eyes — if you’re watching a movie in the Apple TV app or Disney Plus and go to take a screen capture, the content blacks out. It’s strange to experience a reality where big companies can block you from capturing what you see, even if all you’re trying to do is show people how cool it looks in a review. You can get around DRM screenshots on an iPhone by just taking a photo of the screen, but there’s no such off-ramp for the Vision Pro. Speaking of gaming, there aren’t any real VR games or fitness apps here — there’s nothing like Beat Saber or Red Matter or Population: One, all hit games on the Quest. Fitness, in particular, has helped the Quest reach a more mainstream market: Supernatural’s Chris Milk told me in 2021 that his user base is 50 / 50 men and women, 60 percent of whom are over 40. That led to Meta buying Supernatural outright because it was worried about Apple buying it first. Yet, there’s just nothing like that on the Vision Pro at launch, even though Apple is so focused on fitness and health across its other devices. I think it’s because the Vision Pro just doesn’t seem suited to those kinds of physical game experiences — it’s heavy, with that external battery, and it’s hard to see how some of these games would even work without controllers. Apple tells me that game developers working in Unity are hard at work porting over more games and that visionOS allows developers to come up with custom hand gestures, which might solve for some of the controller issues — I was able to try a prerelease version of Super Fruit Ninja that used a custom slashing gesture in a briefing, and it seemed to work well, but that was about it so far. One note about VR motion in the Vision Pro: it doesn’t really do anything to protect you from yourself. I am fairly comfortable in VR — my wife and I use Supernatural, and I went through a brief, delightful period of being absolutely addicted to Gran Turismo 7 VR on the PSVR 2. I am pretty aware of my limits in VR motion, and I can do most things without a problem. But the Vision Pro is so convincing and so unconcerned with whether you might have any limits that you can easily go too far too fast and get yourself a little queasy. I watched five minutes of Avatar: The Way of Water in 3D in Disney Plus — the Vision Pro is the first consumer device to support high frame rate movies in 3D! — and immediately needed to stop because the motion was just too much. I recommend early adopters go slowly and make sure you find your limits gently. That first bout of VR motion sickness is no joke. Wrap up The Vision Pro is an astounding product. It’s the sort of first-generation device only Apple can really make, from the incredible display and passthrough engineering, to the use of the whole ecosystem to make it so seamlessly useful, to even getting everyone to pretty much ignore the whole external battery situation. There’s a part of me that says the Vision Pro only exists because Apple is so incredibly capable, stocked with talent, and loaded with resources that the company simply went out and engineered the hell out of the hardest problems it could think of in order to find a challenge. That’s good! There are a lot of ideas in the Vision Pro, and they’re all executed with the kind of thoughtful intention that few other companies can ever deliver at all, let alone on the first iteration. But the shocking thing is that Apple may have inadvertently revealed that some of these core ideas are actually dead ends — that they can’t ever be executed well enough to become mainstream. This is the best video passthrough headset ever made, and that might mean camera-based mixed reality passthrough could just be a road to nowhere. This is the best hand- and eye-tracking ever, and it feels like the mouse, keyboard, and touchscreen are going to remain undefeated for years to come. There is so much technology in this thing that feels like magic when it works and frustrates you completely when it doesn’t. Photo by Amelia Holowaty Krales / The Vergenone The other way to look at the Vision Pro is that Apple knows all of this, but the technology to build the true AR glasses it has long hinted at is simply not there — so the Vision Pro represents something like a simulator or a developer kit. A dream factory for people to build apps and meaningful use cases for the imagined hardware yet to come: true optical AR glasses that let you share digital experiences with other people. In that framework, this Vision Pro is the hardware Apple can ship right now to get everyone thinking about these ideas while it pours all those resources into the hardware it wants to build. Maybe! It’s fun to think about that possibility, and a lot of people have already assumed that’s the case. But one of the oldest rules we have here at The Verge is that you have to review what’s in the box — the product that’s shipping today, not the promise of improvements yet to come. And so I keep coming back to all the questions I’ve been asking myself ever since I first strapped the Vision Pro onto my head. Starting, of course, with the most important: Do you want a computer that messes up your hair every time you use it? Do you want a computer that smears your makeup every time you use it, if you wear makeup? Do you want a computer that allows the Walt Disney Company to prevent you from taking pictures of what you see? Do you want to use a computer where you easily can’t show anyone else what you’re looking at? Do you think the fanciest TV you own should have HDMI inputs? Do you want to use a computer that doesn’t work as well in a dark room? Do you want to use a computer that is always looking at your hands? That is a lot of tradeoffs — big tradeoffs, not little ones. And the biggest tradeoff of all is that using the Vision Pro is such a lonely experience, regardless of the weird ghost eyes on the front. You’re in there, having experiences all by yourself that no one else can take part in. After using the Vision Pro for a while, I’ve come to agree with what Tim Cook has been saying for so long: headsets are inherently isolating. That’s fine for traditional VR headsets, which have basically turned into single-use game consoles over the past decade, but it’s a lot weirder for a primary computing device. I don’t want to get work done in the Vision Pro. I get my work done with other people, and I’d rather be out here with them.","output":"애플 비전 프로: 혁신적이지만 한계 있음"},{"instruction":"Read the article below and summarize the key takeaways in 80 characters or less. 80 characters is the number of characters in Hangul, excluding spaces.

Apple Vision Pro review: magic, until it’s not The Apple Vision Pro is the best consumer headset anyone’s ever made — and that’s the problem. Nilay PatelJan 30, 2024 at 11:00 PM GMT+9 There’s a lot of pressure on the new Apple Vision Pro, Apple’s long-awaited entry into the world of computers you wear on your face. Apple claims that the Vision Pro, which starts at 3,499, is the beginning of something called “spatial computing,” which basically boils down to running apps all around you. And the company’s ads for it do not hedge that pressure even a little: they show people wearing the Vision Pro all the time. At work! Doing laundry! Playing with their kids! The ambition is enormous: to layer apps and information over the real world — to augment reality. Apple has to claim that the Vision Pro is the beginning of something new because people have been building headset computers for over a decade now. I tried on a development prototype of the first Oculus Rift in 2013, and The Verge’s Adi Robertson, who edited this review, has tried basically every headset that’s been released since. All of that development means there are some pretty good products out there: that first Oculus evolved into the Quest line at Meta, which is now shipping the Quest 3 — a very good VR headset with a huge library of games and some AR features of its own, which costs 500. 7Verge Score 3499 at Apple How we rate and review products In the meantime, Apple, from Tim Cook on down, has largely insisted that augmented reality will be much more valuable than virtual reality. And it’s been building toward AR for a long time: developers have access to AR tools in iOS, and higher-end iPhones and iPads have had lidar depth scanners for a few years now. The Vision Pro is Apple’s first attempt at building a computer out of all those ideas — a computer that works in the space around you. The goal is for the Vision Pro to be a complete device that can sit right alongside the Mac and the iPad in Apple’s ecosystem of devices and let you get real work done. You can use Excel and Webex and Slack in the Vision Pro, and you can also sit back and watch movies and TV shows on a gigantic virtual 4K HDR display. And you can mirror your Mac’s display and just use the Vision Pro to look at a huge monitor floating in virtual space. It sounds amazing, and sometimes it is. But the Vision Pro also represents a series of really big tradeoffs — tradeoffs that are impossible to ignore. Some of those tradeoffs are very tangible: getting all this tech in a headset means there’s a lot of weight on your face, so Apple chose to use an external battery pack connected by a cable. But there are other, more philosophical tradeoffs as well. As I’ve been using it for the past few days, I kept coming up with a series of questions — questions about whether the tradeoffs were worth it. Is using the Vision Pro so good that I’m willing to mess up my hair every time I put it on? Is it so good that I want to lug it around in its giant carrying case instead of my laptop bag? Is it so good that I want to look at the world around me through screens instead of with my own eyes? Basically, I keep asking if I prefer using a computer in there rather than out here. And as interesting as the Vision Pro is, there’s a long way to go before it can beat out here. Photo by Vjeran Pavic / The Vergenone Hardware Apple doesn’t want anyone to think of the Vision Pro as a VR headset, but it’s a VR headset — albeit a VR headset that almost lets you pretend it’s not a VR headset. You put it on your head in a way that blocks out your vision entirely, and then it shows you a 3D video feed of the world around you passed through from the cameras on the front, as though you can see right through the device. But it can also put you in virtual reality, at various levels of immersion: I spent some time working entirely on the Moon and a lot of time in my kitchen with a bunch of windows floating around a portal into Joshua Tree. The Vision Pro is stunning compared to other VR headsets, which are largely plastic and often downright goofy-looking. The Vision Pro, by contrast, is built of magnesium and carbon fiber in an aluminum enclosure that feels like a natural extension of Apple’s familiar design language. There’s a little iPhone 6 in there, a little AirPods Max, a little Apple Watch. It is the cutting edge of technology in a package that seems instantly familiar. Almost everyone I’ve shown it to thinks it looks smaller in person than they expected, especially compared to some of the huge VR headsets we’ve seen over the past decade. The front display on the Vision Pro is an attempt at keeping you from being isolated from other people while you’re wearing it. In Apple’s photos, it looks like a big, bright screen that shows a video of your eyes to people around you so they feel comfortable talking to you while you’re wearing the headset — a feature adorably called EyeSight. In reality, it might as well not be there. It’s a low-res OLED with a lenticular panel in front of it to provide a mild 3D effect, and it’s so dim and the cover glass is so reflective, it’s actually hard to see in most normal to bright lighting. When people do see your eyes, it’s a low-res, ghostly image of them that feels like CGI. The effect is uncanny — the idea that you’ll be making real eye contact with anyone is a fantasy. And there are no controls or indicators in visionOS for this external display, so you never really know what other people are seeing. Imagine looking someone directly in the eyes and talking to them without knowing if they can see your eyes — it’s weird! EyeSight is so weird. So, so weird. Photo by Amelia Holowaty Krales / The Vergenone That cover glass hides a huge array of cameras and sensors. There’s a pair of high-res front cameras for the video passthrough, cameras that face down and to the sides to track your hands, a lidar scanner and TrueDepth cameras for spatial tracking, and infrared floodlights so everything can work in low light. Underneath all that, you’ve got an M2 processor and Apple’s new R1 spatial coprocessor and a pair of fans to move the heat from all this tech out the top. The fans were never perceptible during my time testing the Vision Pro, but the heat was: after long sessions, the headset was definitely warm. On the top edge, you’ll find what feel like larger versions of some familiar Apple Watch controls: a digital crown that adjusts both the volume and the level of virtual reality immersion on the right as you look through the headset and a button on the left that lets you take 3D photos and videos. You get two headbands in the box: the solo knit band and the dual loop band. They both attach and detach easily; you snap them right on and then pull the little orange tab to disconnect them. The solo band is unquestionably cooler and messes up your hair slightly less — but they both mess up your hair, so if the dual loop fits you better, just go with it. I found the solo loop much more comfortable; I also wish the mounting points were on the outside face so I could pull the band around my head and clip it on instead of constantly pulling it over my hair. The front of the Vision Pro is covered in cameras and sensors. Photo by Vjeran Pavic / The Vergenone The solo loop is by far the cooler strap. Photo by Amelia Holowaty Krales / The Vergenone The huge case costs an additional 199 and looks like a marshmallow from space. I love it. Photo by Amelia Holowaty Krales / The Vergenone The other two pieces are the light seal, which comes in various sizes, and the headband, which comes in two thicknesses. (You get fitted for these in the store or by scanning your head with an iPhone if you buy online.) Both attach magnetically, which means they also detach magnetically — you want to pick this thing up by the frame because grabbing it by the light seal can lead to disaster. If you have glasses, you can click in custom Zeiss lens inserts — Apple sent us reader lenses to see what that process looks like, but I just used the Vision Pro while wearing my soft contacts, and it was fine. The Vision Pro’s speakers are housed in the arms on the side, and they are good and loud and do a convincing job of rendering spatial audio. Things really sound like they are happening where they appear to be happening, which is a neat trick. The speakers are also pretty leaky, so everyone else around you can hear what you’re up to unless you use headphones. You can use any Bluetooth headphones you want, but you get a bunch of extra features if you use the latest AirPods Pro, like lower latency, lossless 48KHz audio, and Apple’s Adaptive Audio system, which automatically mixes in sound from the real world as appropriate. Since you’ll mostly experience the Vision Pro in there, the most noticeable thing about the hardware after a while is that it’s just… heavy. You’re supposed to wear this thing on your face for long stretches of computer time, and depending on which band and light seal you use, the headset alone weighs between 600 and 650 grams. I keep joking that the Vision Pro is an iPad for your face, but it’s heavier than an 11-inch iPad Pro (470 grams) and pushing close to a 12.9-inch iPad Pro (682 grams), so in a very real way, it’s an iPad for your face. All of the Vision Pro’s heft is totally front-loaded, too. Other big headsets like the Quest Pro (722 grams) have elaborate headbands to balance out their weight, but the Vision Pro just rests it all on the front. Swapping to the dual loop strap helps keep things more stable but doesn’t really reduce the overall sensation of having all that headset on your face. You’re just going to feel it after a while. The Vision Pro’s external battery pack is fine, mostly because it’s such a stationary device overall. Photo by Vjeran Pavic / The Vergenone Notably, the Vision Pro is substantially heavier than the familiar Quest 2 (503g) or even the heavier Quest 3 (515g) — headsets that have built-in batteries. Apple told me that it chose to use an external battery specifically to reduce the headset’s weight. The battery itself is barely worth talking about — it’s a silver brick that weighs another 353 grams with a USB-C port and a motion-activated LED that’s green when it’s charged and orange when it’s not. It connects to the headset with a satisfying twist connector, but the nice braided cable is permanently attached to the battery itself, so don’t break it. You can buy extra batteries for 199, but you can’t hot-swap them; disconnecting the battery from the Vision Pro cuts the power entirely. I don’t really have strong opinions on this battery setup, which is mostly because nothing about the Vision Pro feels like you’re supposed to move around that much in it, so it’s more or less fine. It’s funny that Apple of all companies shipped this compromise, but it’s also very Apple that the battery is not actually bigger so it can provide more than two and a half hours of run time. (If you plug the battery in, the Vision Pro just runs on wall power for as long as you want.) Setting up the Vision Pro is dead simple — the headband adjustments are the only manual adjustments involved. Everything else is motorized and sensor-driven. There’s no fiddly lens wheel to dial in; the headset asks you to hold down the digital crown when you first put it on to adjust the lenses to your eyes, and then you go through a pretty standard eye tracking setup. The rest of the setup is almost exactly like any other iOS device: if you have an iPhone, you can bring it close to the Vision Pro to send over all your settings, and you have to agree to some terms and conditions. If you don’t have an iPhone, you’ll have to enter your passwords and so on manually, but it’ll work fine as a standalone device. After all of that, you’re computing in the future. See? It’s a VR headset. Photo by Vjeran Pavic / The Vergenone Apple is very proud of the displays inside the Vision Pro, and for good reason — they represent a huge leap forward in display technology. The two displays are tiny MicroOLEDs with a total of 23 million pixels that are just 7.5 micrometers in size, which is about the size of a red blood cell. And each of those tiny pixels is composed of three RGB subpixels laid out in what Apple tells me is an S-stripe pattern. Just thinking about the level of precision required to make these displays and then make them work in a device like this is mind-blowing. They also look generally incredible — sharp enough to read text on without even thinking about it, bright enough to do justice to movies. Apple calibrates them for color at the factory so they are also vibrant and color-accurate without looking oversaturated or blown out. They are so small, but they work so well that they seem huge. The displays are the main reason the Vision Pro is so expensive — they’re at the heart of the Vision Pro experience and what makes the whole thing work. You are always looking at them, after all. But for all their technical marvels, they are not without tradeoffs of their own when deployed on a device like this. The speakers are nice and loud and convincing with spatial audio. Photo by Vjeran Pavic / The Vergenone See this thing — a passthrough VR headset with a silly external battery pack and a display that shows ghostly images of your eyes on the front — is not the big goal. The big goal is AR, or augmented reality. In particular, the big goal is optical AR, where light passes directly through unobtrusive glasses to your eyes, with digital information layered over the top of what you’re seeing. AR is a technology with the potential to literally change humanity, and Apple CEO Tim Cook has been talking about how isolating VR headsets are and how important he thinks AR will be for years now. Tim Cook, 2016: “Few people are going to view that it’s acceptable to be enclosed in something.” Tim Cook, 2017: “Unlike Virtual Reality which closes the world out, AR allows individuals to be present in the world.” Tim Cook, 2017: “I also like the fact that [AR] doesn’t isolate [...] I’ve never been a fan of VR like that because I think it does the opposite.” Tim Cook, 2020: “I think [AR is] something that doesn’t isolate people. We can use it to enhance our discussion, not substitute it for human connection, which I’ve always deeply worried about in some of the other technologies.” The problem is that the technology to build a true optical AR display that works well enough to replace an everyday computer just isn’t there yet. The Magic Leap 2 is an optical AR headset that’s cheaper and smaller than the Vision Pro, but it’s plagued by compromises in field of view and image quality that most people would never accept. So Apple’s settled for building a headset with real-time video passthrough — it is the defining tradeoff of the Vision Pro. It is a VR headset masquerading as an AR headset. And let me tell you: the video passthrough on the Vision Pro is really good. It works! It’s convincing. You put the headset on, the display comes on, and you’re right back where you were, only with a bunch of visionOS windows floating around. It sounds simple, but it is an astonishing engineering achievement to do that in real time, at high resolution, in a computer that fits over your eyes. Apple claims there’s only 12ms of latency between what the cameras see and what’s on the display, and that latency includes the exposure time of the cameras themselves. The actual data processing is faster. Do the math, and Apple says there’s not even a frame’s worth of latency; the next frame of video is ready before you’re done looking at the last one. Still cameras, still displays. Photo by Vjeran Pavic / The Vergenone You can also see Apple’s incredible video processing chops right in front of your eyes: I sat around scrolling on my phone while wearing the Vision Pro, with no blown-out screens or weird frame rate issues. I also worked on my Mac in front of a large window while wearing the headset, which is a torture test for dynamic range, and while it wasn’t perfect, it was still usable. It is the best video passthrough that’s ever shipped in a consumer device by far. The problem is that cameras are still cameras, and displays are still displays. All cameras have motion blur, for example. In low light, cameras either have to increase exposure times at the cost of sharpness or increase ISO at the cost of noise, which then requires noise reduction, which makes things blurry and dull. And cameras and displays both have real limits in terms of color reproduction. The Vision Pro cannot overcome the inherent nature of cameras and displays. You can easily see motion blur when you move your head in the Vision Pro — motion blur that increases in low light and leads to some weird warping of straight lines. Low light also causes the overall sharpness of the video passthrough to drop as noise reduction kicks in: my iPhone screen got noticeably blurrier when the sun set. If you’re in a medium-lit room halfway immersed in a dark virtual environment with a bright window open — say, sitting in your kitchen at night with the lights on while writing a review in a Google Docs window floating on a dark beach — you will notice the display brightness slowly ramp up and down as the system tries to average out the brightness of everything you’re looking at. The LCD clock on my microwave flickers when I look at it through these cameras. And Apple’s specs say the display supports 92 percent of the DCI-P3 color gamut, which means the Vision Pro can only show you 49 percent of the colors your eyes can actually see. The displays have other limitations: the field of view isn’t huge, and the essential nature of looking at tiny displays through lenses makes that field of view feel even smaller. Apple won’t tell me the exact number, but the Vision Pro’s field of view is certainly smaller than the Quest 3’s 110 horizontal degrees. That means there are fairly large black borders around what you’re seeing, a bit like you’re looking through binoculars. On top of that, there’s a little bit of distortion and vignetting around the edges of the lenses, and you’ll see some green and pink color fringing at the edges as well, especially in bright environments. All of this makes the usable field of view feel even smaller. If you’re looking at something bright or otherwise high contrast — a white text window floating above a dark desert landscape, for example — you’ll see highlights reflecting in the lenses. A screen capture from the Vision Pro and a simulated view of what it feels like to look in the headset. I asked Apple about all of this, and yep — that’s how it’s supposed to look. Apple spokesperson Jacqueline Roy told me that a combination of hardware and software in the Vision Pro is specifically designed to minimize these various effects, but they’re definitely in there, and you’ll see them. If you have been paying attention to VR for the past decade, you know that these are very familiar VR headset display issues. You’re passing light from a screen through lenses mounted on someone’s face and trying to line those lenses up with their eyes, which are notably in different spots on different people’s faces. (Our bodies are designed very badly when it comes to mounting hardware on them.) So a little weirdness at the edges of the displays is not a deal-breaker or even a surprise — except Apple is charging 3,499 for the Vision Pro and making it sound like these displays are perfect enough for you to casually wear this thing while folding laundry. I’m serious when I say the Vision Pro has the best video passthrough I’ve ever seen on the sharpest VR displays any normal person will ever come across. But you’re still constantly being reminded that you’re looking at video on screens, and reality is just a lot more interesting than that. There are vanishingly few contexts in reviewing consumer devices where anyone has to care about color gamuts — but if you want me to perceive reality through something, I’d like to see all the colors of the rainbow. This is the best anyone has ever made in there look, and it’s still not nearly as good as out here. Waiting. Watching. Ready to mess up your hair at a moment’s notice. Photo by Vjeran Pavic / The Vergenone Controls The other thing Apple is very proud of is the eye and hand tracking control system, which is light years beyond any other consumer hand or eye tracking systems out there. You look at things you want to control, you tap your fingers to control them, and that’s how you get around the entire interface. You’re not reaching out and touching things — it’s more like your eyes are the mouse, and your fingers are the button: you tap them together to click on what you’re looking at. The first few times you use hand and eye tracking on the Vision Pro, it’s awe-inspiring — it feels like a superpower. The Vision Pro’s external cameras just need to see your hands for it to work, and they can see your hands in a pretty large zone around your body. You can have them slung across the back of the couch, resting in your lap, up in the air with your elbows on a table, pretty much anywhere the cameras can see them. It actually takes a minute to realize you don’t have to gesture out in front of you with your hands in the air — and once you figure it out, it’s pretty fun to watch other people instinctively reach their hands up the first time they try the Vision Pro. But the next few times you use hand and eye tracking, it stops feeling like a superpower — and in some cases, it actively makes using the Vision Pro harder. It turns out that having to look at what you want to control is really quite distracting. Think about every other computer in your life: the input mechanism is independent of whatever you’re looking at. On a laptop, you can click on controls and use the keyboard while keeping your focus on a document. On a phone, you can do things like drag sliders in a photo editing app while keeping your eyes focused on what those changes are actually doing to your photo. The Vision Pro simply doesn’t work like that — you have to be looking at something in order to click on it, and that means you are constantly taking your attention away from whatever you’re working on to specifically look at the button you need to press next. I spent some time playing a lovely little game called Stitch that quickly became maddening because I kept looking away from the piece I wanted to move to the place I wanted to move it, which meant I wasn’t picking it up when I tapped my fingers. Reach out and touch faith. Photo by Vjeran Pavic / The Vergenone visionOS feels also designed for an eye tracking system that’s just slightly more precise than it actually is — a lot of controls are just a little too small and a little too close together to let you quickly bop around the system. You have to look, make sure you’re looking at the thing you want, and then tap, or you might end up clicking on the wrong thing. Sometimes the fastest way to select what you want is to look away entirely and try again. It works until it doesn’t. It’s magic until it’s not. Think about it like this: The keyboard and mouse on a Mac directly control the Mac. The click wheel on an iPod directly controlled the iPod. A lot of work has gone into making it feel like the multitouch screen on an iPhone directly controls the phone, and when it goes sideways, like when autocorrect fails or an app doesn’t register your taps, it’s not pleasant. Your eyes and hands aren’t directly controlling the Vision Pro: cameras are watching your eyes and hands and turning that into input, and sometimes the interpretation isn’t perfect. The best example of this is the hilarious on-screen keyboard, which you use by staring at each letter and pinching your fingers to select it or henpecking with two fingers at the floating keys in front of you. It’s not worth using for anything beyond entering a Wi-Fi password — for anything longer, you’ll want to use dictation or connect a Bluetooth keyboard. Why? So you can directly control the input. It’s not a given that the Vision Pro can always see your hands, either. There’s a pretty large bubble around the front of your body where the cameras can see your hands — it basically extends the length of your arms in a semicircle around the front of your body. But if you lean back in a chair with your arm at your side, it can’t see your hand. If you’re sitting at a table and your hands are on your legs, it might not see your hands. If you’re lying down in a dark room and the IR illuminators can’t reach your hands, the cameras might not be able to see them. If you’re simply standing up with your arms at your sides, it might not be able to see your hands if they drift too far backward. Photo by Vjeran Pavic / The Vergenone I recognize that it is fundamentally silly to complain about a hand tracking system needing to see your hands, and it is possible to navigate quite a lot of visionOS with Siri and dictation: you can manage apps, open different virtual immersions, and so on. If you squint, you can see a glimpse of how a computer that you use by talking to it and manipulating things in space might one day work. But right now, the limits are obvious. Using the Vision Pro makes you constantly aware of what you are looking at and where your hands are in a way that is unlike any other computer I’ve ever used. When it fails, it’s maddening. (Oddly, Apple’s newest watches can detect a pinching gesture, but there’s no ability to use those as control devices on the Vision Pro.) The flip side is that a system that’s constantly watching your hands for input tends to register a lot of extra inputs, which can be very funny. I talk through writing video scripts to make sure things flow, and I talk with my hands. So as I was writing the video script for this review in the Vision Pro, the system kept catching my hands moving and started scrolling and clicking on things by accident. I cracked up the first time I realized what was happening. But eventually, it meant that I took the Vision Pro off and wrote the rest of the script on my Mac, which only does things when I actually want it to. Just as with the displays, I think this is the best eye and hand tracking system anyone’s ever shipped. It really can feel like magic… until it doesn’t. And if you want people to do their computing in there, the input system needs to be absolutely rock solid. Personas I won’t go into that much detail on Apple’s deeply weird and extremely uncanny 3D persona system here — the best way to understand them is by watching the video review above, which features a FaceTime call between The Wall Street Journal’s Joanna Stern, Marques Brownlee, and me, all using our personas. To quote Marques, personas are really impressive and also really bad. You can see why Apple put the beta label on them; there’s a long way to go before using a persona on a call isn’t distracting at best and, at worst, extremely rude. I will say, Joanna’s persona accurately captured her reaction to personas in general here. Marques looks like he’s happy to welcome me into PlayStation Home. One small note: personas can show up whenever an app calls for a front-facing camera, so they work in basically everything. I used mine on a Google Meet call in Safari just fine, although the other people on the Meet call did not think it was fine at all. Spatial cameras I would not recommend shooting photos in the Vision Pro unless you really need to. Pressing the shutter button a single time delivers a 2560 x 2560 still, which works out to 6.5 megapixels. As far as I can tell, it’s always from the left main camera, which the EXIF data says has an 18mm f/2.0 lens. The photos look like 6.5-megapixel photos from a tiny camera sensor optimized for video, which is to say that they look pretty bad. Video is slightly better — the Vision Pro shoots 2200 x 2200 square videos at 30fps. They look a little better than the photos, but there’s still an awful lot of compression going on, and if you happen to watch them on anything but a Vision Pro, you’ll notice some barrel distortion as the camera moves around. None of this feels particularly important: I really can’t think of situations where I’d want to be taking video with the headset on since all these videos and screen captures come with a ton of excess motion from your head moving around. Also, you will look fundamentally ridiculous trying to take photos of your family with this thing on your face. I think it’s fair to assume most Vision Pro buyers also own iPhones, which take great videos, so whatever. One thing that is very convincing is taking spatial videos on the iPhone 15 Pro Max and watching them in 3D on the Vision Pro. I took some videos of my daughter at the zoo and around Christmas time, and like any dad, I could probably watch them over and over again forever. They play back in a sort of ghostly white haze, and the overall effect is incredibly bittersweet — you can relive a brief memory, but you’re alone in the headset and can’t share it with anyone else. The other problem is that, currently, you can choose to shoot iPhone video in spatial in 1080p at 30fps or at the full 4K resolution the phone supports but not both. For now, I’m going to stick with the higher-res video, but there’s going to come a time where shooting in spatial by default is the smart move, and that will be a real turning point. visionOS The Vision Pro runs visionOS, which Apple says is based on iPadOS, with a lot of customization around latency and vision to make it work for spatial computing. Starting with the iPad as a foundation represents an incredible head start for Apple — it’s taken years for Meta to build out all the features of the Android-based Quest OS and populate its app store, and it’s still mostly games. Apple gets to start with the full set of mature iPadOS features and most of the huge iPad app library. It’s funny to keep saying that the Vision Pro is an iPad for your face, but when it comes to the current set of apps, it’s also not totally wrong. Most of them work like iPad apps, and the homescreen comes preloaded with a folder labeled “compatible apps” that’s full of actual iPad apps. It’s hard to judge the app ecosystem for a product that has barely launched, but I feel totally comfortable judging the iPad app ecosystem at this point, and Apple shipping its own podcast and news apps as iPad apps on the Vision Pro feels like a sign in a lot of ways. Photo by Vjeran Pavic / The Vergenone There’s already controversy in the world of Vision Pro apps: some huge developers like Netflix, Spotify, and YouTube have decided to wait before allowing their apps to run on the Vision Pro and aren’t even allowing their iPad apps to run. As always, the open web serves as the pressure release valve for Apple developer politics, and Safari on the Vision Pro is a capable riff on iPad Safari: I watched Netflix in Safari and it worked without a hitch, although you can’t put the video in a nice environment like you can with the native apps. I also watched the NFL playoffs on YouTube TV in Safari on the Vision Pro, and it worked with a few minor hiccups, although it did keep asking me to confirm my location over and over again. The stranger thing is that Safari on the Vision Pro is pretty disconnected from web-based 3D experiences. Apple has made noise about supporting the WebXR standard, and there are flags in Safari’s advanced preferences to turn on support, but it’s pretty hit-or-miss in terms of actually working right now — it mostly does not. I asked about this, and Apple told me that it is actively contributing to WebXR and wants to “work with the community to help deliver great spatial computing experiences via the web.” So let’s give that one a minute and see how it goes. On the other hand, I asked Apple why the huge library of VR video on YouTube doesn’t work at all on the Vision Pro, and the company basically told me it wasn’t good enough to support, saying that “much of this content was created for devices that do not deliver a high-quality spatial experience” and that the company’s efforts were instead focused on “delivering the best spatial media experience possible including spatial photos and videos, Apple Immersive Video, and 3D movies available on Apple TV.” Translation: don’t hold your breath for YouTube VR support. Photo by Amelia Holowaty Krales / The Vergenone The really big difference between visionOS and iPadOS is that iPadOS has a lot of opinions about how you can arrange apps and how many apps you can run at a time, and visionOS is full-on free-floating window chaos. I love it. It is bananas. You can open as many apps as you want and put them anywhere you want in space. You can open windows in the kitchen, walk away from them and open some more in the living room, and then go back to the kitchen to find all your old windows waiting for you. Late one night, I made an art gallery of giant Safari windows in our office’s large open cafe area and walked around, looking at huge webpages for a while. I am telling you, it is wild. Sadly, visionOS doesn’t have any ability to share these windows or experiences with anyone else: two people in Vision Pro headsets sitting in the same room can’t see the same things floating in space at the same time. Apple tells me some enterprise developers are working on experiences with shared views, and you can mirror the view from one Vision Pro to another over FaceTime, but in the end, my big Safari art gallery only ever had one patron: me. It’s amazing you can do all of this, but it is also quite lonely to put things all over a space knowing no one else will ever really experience it. To move windows around, you just grab the bar at the bottom and put it wherever you want to in space. You can layer windows, you can put them directly above your head, you can put them on the floor — you can really just do whatever you want. To switch between them, you just look at the window you want and tap your fingers; inactive windows go slightly translucent, which means all kinds of things can be happening at once all over your space. On top of that, you can have apps from three different operating systems on-screen at the same time: native visionOS apps; iPad apps; and then you can also connect your Mac via Wi-Fi and have a whole Mac display with all the chaotic glory of macOS floating around in space. One area where visionOS has clear room to improve is window management. There’s no Exposé or Stage Manager to collect all your open windows in front of you or put them into preset arrangements, and the management that does exist is not exactly discoverable or intuitively laid out. You can tap and hold the X button in one app to hide all your other apps. If you want to hide everything, you double-click the digital crown on the headset itself. If you want to close all apps, you just ask Siri; if you want to quit a misbehaving app, you hold down the top button and the digital crown simultaneously to bring up a force quit window. It’s a lot of different ideas all at once. Once you figure out the moves, you can get around, but it takes a minute, and it means you’ll be thinking about window management more than any other iOS device I can think of and maybe even more than a Mac, which has four decades of window management ideas built into it. Photo by Amelia Holowaty Krales / The Vergenone Speaking of the Mac, I know a lot of people are excited about the idea of buying a Vision Pro just to put up giant virtual monitors. There’s good news and bad news about that. The good news is that Mac display sharing works really well, and Apple ecosystem tricks like Handoff and Continuity are pure magic in this context. You can copy on your Mac and paste in visionOS, and it just works. You can open your Mac display in visionOS and drag the mouse off the screen, and suddenly, your Mac’s keyboard and trackpad are controlling visionOS apps. It works just like it does between a Mac and an iPad. I found myself putting a virtual Mac display over my MacBook Pro’s screen and making it look like I had a 50-inch laptop to use Lightroom with — it’s awesome. There is a lot of very complicated display scaling going on behind the scenes here, but the easiest way to think about it is that you’re basically getting a 27-inch Retina display, like you’d find on an iMac or Studio Display. Your Mac thinks it’s connected to a 5K display with a resolution of 5120 x 2880, and it runs macOS at a 2:1 logical resolution of 2560 x 1440, just like a 5K display. (You can pick other resolutions, but the device warns you that they’ll be lower quality.) That virtual display is then streamed as a 4K 3560 x 2880 video to the Vision Pro, where you can just make it as big as you want. The upshot of all of this is that 4K content runs at a native 4K resolution — it has all the pixels to do it, just like an iMac — but you have a grand total of 2560 x 1440 to place windows in, regardless of how big you make the Mac display in space, and you’re not seeing a pixel-perfect 5K image. It is incredible that all of this works with just a single button click, but all that scaling complication also explains the bad news: you can only have a single Mac display in visionOS. You can’t have multiple Mac monitors floating in space. Maybe next time. Photo by Vjeran Pavic / The Vergenone One of the weirder things about visionOS (and the Vision Pro itself, really) is that there’s not a lot of true AR in the mix — as in, actual interaction between physical objects in your space and digital ones. After all these years of Apple talking about AR, I counted exactly three things in my entire time with the Vision Pro that offered a preview of the AR future. One: when you look at your Mac, the Vision Pro sometimes puts up a “connect display” button above it that starts screen sharing. Two: when you’re typing on a Bluetooth keyboard and look down at your hands, it puts a little text preview window above the keyboard so you can see what you’re typing. These are little features, yes, but they are some of the first true AR computing features that have ever shipped on a mainstream device, and they are an incredibly tantalizing glimpse of what might be possible. They also happen to be incredibly useful. The third AR thing I saw was the loading screen of Super Fruit Ninja, which allows you to throw a strawberry at a pig that’s running around on your floor. This seems slightly less historic. That’s more or less it. There’s not a lot of reality being augmented in the rest of visionOS. There’s an awful lot of what you might call mixed reality: virtual objects floating around in space with no connection to anything real. All those app windows floating around are doing so independently of the physical environment. And in the entertainment context, where Apple lets the Vision Pro fall back into being the VR headset it fundamentally is, it absolutely shines. Watching movies on the Vision Pro is a ton of fun, especially in the Apple TV app’s immersive movie theater that lets you pick where you want to sit. It’s also very cool to watch a movie in one of Apple’s virtual environments like Mount Hood and see the colors from the screen reflect onto the landscape or look around one of the Disney Plus environments like Avengers Tower. And movies themselves look great — the incredible quality of the Vision Pro’s displays is really obvious when you’re watching something. I watched far more of Top Gun: Maverick than I intended to just because it looked so good blown up to drive-in movie size, floating over a mountain. Photo by Amelia Holowaty Krales / The Vergenone Since the Vision Pro sends separate images to each eye, it can do true 3D movies — and Apple and its partners like Disney have already released quite a few. If you have a large Apple movie library, you get the 3D versions for free — you just choose 2D or 3D playback when you hit play. Apple is also making immersive versions of some of its Apple TV Plus shows, which basically means a 180ish-degree 3D video that feels like the best Google Cardboard demo of all time. I watched someone walk a tightrope in Adventure, and it was very convincing — but if you’ve never tried this before, I’d be careful that you get used to VR motion before diving into 3D videos. Apple has also promised immersive sports content, but sadly, I wasn’t able to try any of that yet. You can get pretty far making the argument that the Vision Pro is worth it simply as a very expensive TV — but after a while, the weight of it reminds you that this very nice TV is resting on your face. (I usually made it about 30 minutes to an hour before wanting a break.) It’s also a very expensive TV that doesn’t have HDMI inputs, so you’re limited to Apple’s gaming library, which feels deeply unfair. And unlike any other TV in your life, the Vision Pro can literally DRM your eyes — if you’re watching a movie in the Apple TV app or Disney Plus and go to take a screen capture, the content blacks out. It’s strange to experience a reality where big companies can block you from capturing what you see, even if all you’re trying to do is show people how cool it looks in a review. You can get around DRM screenshots on an iPhone by just taking a photo of the screen, but there’s no such off-ramp for the Vision Pro. Speaking of gaming, there aren’t any real VR games or fitness apps here — there’s nothing like Beat Saber or Red Matter or Population: One, all hit games on the Quest. Fitness, in particular, has helped the Quest reach a more mainstream market: Supernatural’s Chris Milk told me in 2021 that his user base is 50 / 50 men and women, 60 percent of whom are over 40. That led to Meta buying Supernatural outright because it was worried about Apple buying it first. Yet, there’s just nothing like that on the Vision Pro at launch, even though Apple is so focused on fitness and health across its other devices. I think it’s because the Vision Pro just doesn’t seem suited to those kinds of physical game experiences — it’s heavy, with that external battery, and it’s hard to see how some of these games would even work without controllers. Apple tells me that game developers working in Unity are hard at work porting over more games and that visionOS allows developers to come up with custom hand gestures, which might solve for some of the controller issues — I was able to try a prerelease version of Super Fruit Ninja that used a custom slashing gesture in a briefing, and it seemed to work well, but that was about it so far. One note about VR motion in the Vision Pro: it doesn’t really do anything to protect you from yourself. I am fairly comfortable in VR — my wife and I use Supernatural, and I went through a brief, delightful period of being absolutely addicted to Gran Turismo 7 VR on the PSVR 2. I am pretty aware of my limits in VR motion, and I can do most things without a problem. But the Vision Pro is so convincing and so unconcerned with whether you might have any limits that you can easily go too far too fast and get yourself a little queasy. I watched five minutes of Avatar: The Way of Water in 3D in Disney Plus — the Vision Pro is the first consumer device to support high frame rate movies in 3D! — and immediately needed to stop because the motion was just too much. I recommend early adopters go slowly and make sure you find your limits gently. That first bout of VR motion sickness is no joke. Wrap up The Vision Pro is an astounding product. It’s the sort of first-generation device only Apple can really make, from the incredible display and passthrough engineering, to the use of the whole ecosystem to make it so seamlessly useful, to even getting everyone to pretty much ignore the whole external battery situation. There’s a part of me that says the Vision Pro only exists because Apple is so incredibly capable, stocked with talent, and loaded with resources that the company simply went out and engineered the hell out of the hardest problems it could think of in order to find a challenge. That’s good! There are a lot of ideas in the Vision Pro, and they’re all executed with the kind of thoughtful intention that few other companies can ever deliver at all, let alone on the first iteration. But the shocking thing is that Apple may have inadvertently revealed that some of these core ideas are actually dead ends — that they can’t ever be executed well enough to become mainstream. This is the best video passthrough headset ever made, and that might mean camera-based mixed reality passthrough could just be a road to nowhere. This is the best hand- and eye-tracking ever, and it feels like the mouse, keyboard, and touchscreen are going to remain undefeated for years to come. There is so much technology in this thing that feels like magic when it works and frustrates you completely when it doesn’t. Photo by Amelia Holowaty Krales / The Vergenone The other way to look at the Vision Pro is that Apple knows all of this, but the technology to build the true AR glasses it has long hinted at is simply not there — so the Vision Pro represents something like a simulator or a developer kit. A dream factory for people to build apps and meaningful use cases for the imagined hardware yet to come: true optical AR glasses that let you share digital experiences with other people. In that framework, this Vision Pro is the hardware Apple can ship right now to get everyone thinking about these ideas while it pours all those resources into the hardware it wants to build. Maybe! It’s fun to think about that possibility, and a lot of people have already assumed that’s the case. But one of the oldest rules we have here at The Verge is that you have to review what’s in the box — the product that’s shipping today, not the promise of improvements yet to come. And so I keep coming back to all the questions I’ve been asking myself ever since I first strapped the Vision Pro onto my head. Starting, of course, with the most important: Do you want a computer that messes up your hair every time you use it? Do you want a computer that smears your makeup every time you use it, if you wear makeup? Do you want a computer that allows the Walt Disney Company to prevent you from taking pictures of what you see? Do you want to use a computer where you easily can’t show anyone else what you’re looking at? Do you think the fanciest TV you own should have HDMI inputs? Do you want to use a computer that doesn’t work as well in a dark room? Do you want to use a computer that is always looking at your hands? That is a lot of tradeoffs — big tradeoffs, not little ones. And the biggest tradeoff of all is that using the Vision Pro is such a lonely experience, regardless of the weird ghost eyes on the front. You’re in there, having experiences all by yourself that no one else can take part in. After using the Vision Pro for a while, I’ve come to agree with what Tim Cook has been saying for so long: headsets are inherently isolating. That’s fine for traditional VR headsets, which have basically turned into single-use game consoles over the past decade, but it’s a lot weirder for a primary computing device. I don’t want to get work done in the Vision Pro. I get my work done with other people, and I’d rather be out here with them.","output":"애플 비전 프로: 혁신적이나 무거움, 고립감"},{"instruction":"Read the article below and summarize the key takeaways in 200 characters.

Apple Vision Pro review: magic, until it’s not The Apple Vision Pro is the best consumer headset anyone’s ever made — and that’s the problem. Nilay PatelJan 30, 2024 at 11:00 PM GMT+9 There’s a lot of pressure on the new Apple Vision Pro, Apple’s long-awaited entry into the world of computers you wear on your face. Apple claims that the Vision Pro, which starts at 3,499, is the beginning of something called “spatial computing,” which basically boils down to running apps all around you. And the company’s ads for it do not hedge that pressure even a little: they show people wearing the Vision Pro all the time. At work! Doing laundry! Playing with their kids! The ambition is enormous: to layer apps and information over the real world — to augment reality. Apple has to claim that the Vision Pro is the beginning of something new because people have been building headset computers for over a decade now. I tried on a development prototype of the first Oculus Rift in 2013, and The Verge’s Adi Robertson, who edited this review, has tried basically every headset that’s been released since. All of that development means there are some pretty good products out there: that first Oculus evolved into the Quest line at Meta, which is now shipping the Quest 3 — a very good VR headset with a huge library of games and some AR features of its own, which costs 500. 7Verge Score 3499 at Apple How we rate and review products In the meantime, Apple, from Tim Cook on down, has largely insisted that augmented reality will be much more valuable than virtual reality. And it’s been building toward AR for a long time: developers have access to AR tools in iOS, and higher-end iPhones and iPads have had lidar depth scanners for a few years now. The Vision Pro is Apple’s first attempt at building a computer out of all those ideas — a computer that works in the space around you. The goal is for the Vision Pro to be a complete device that can sit right alongside the Mac and the iPad in Apple’s ecosystem of devices and let you get real work done. You can use Excel and Webex and Slack in the Vision Pro, and you can also sit back and watch movies and TV shows on a gigantic virtual 4K HDR display. And you can mirror your Mac’s display and just use the Vision Pro to look at a huge monitor floating in virtual space. It sounds amazing, and sometimes it is. But the Vision Pro also represents a series of really big tradeoffs — tradeoffs that are impossible to ignore. Some of those tradeoffs are very tangible: getting all this tech in a headset means there’s a lot of weight on your face, so Apple chose to use an external battery pack connected by a cable. But there are other, more philosophical tradeoffs as well. As I’ve been using it for the past few days, I kept coming up with a series of questions — questions about whether the tradeoffs were worth it. Is using the Vision Pro so good that I’m willing to mess up my hair every time I put it on? Is it so good that I want to lug it around in its giant carrying case instead of my laptop bag? Is it so good that I want to look at the world around me through screens instead of with my own eyes? Basically, I keep asking if I prefer using a computer in there rather than out here. And as interesting as the Vision Pro is, there’s a long way to go before it can beat out here. Photo by Vjeran Pavic / The Vergenone Hardware Apple doesn’t want anyone to think of the Vision Pro as a VR headset, but it’s a VR headset — albeit a VR headset that almost lets you pretend it’s not a VR headset. You put it on your head in a way that blocks out your vision entirely, and then it shows you a 3D video feed of the world around you passed through from the cameras on the front, as though you can see right through the device. But it can also put you in virtual reality, at various levels of immersion: I spent some time working entirely on the Moon and a lot of time in my kitchen with a bunch of windows floating around a portal into Joshua Tree. The Vision Pro is stunning compared to other VR headsets, which are largely plastic and often downright goofy-looking. The Vision Pro, by contrast, is built of magnesium and carbon fiber in an aluminum enclosure that feels like a natural extension of Apple’s familiar design language. There’s a little iPhone 6 in there, a little AirPods Max, a little Apple Watch. It is the cutting edge of technology in a package that seems instantly familiar. Almost everyone I’ve shown it to thinks it looks smaller in person than they expected, especially compared to some of the huge VR headsets we’ve seen over the past decade. The front display on the Vision Pro is an attempt at keeping you from being isolated from other people while you’re wearing it. In Apple’s photos, it looks like a big, bright screen that shows a video of your eyes to people around you so they feel comfortable talking to you while you’re wearing the headset — a feature adorably called EyeSight. In reality, it might as well not be there. It’s a low-res OLED with a lenticular panel in front of it to provide a mild 3D effect, and it’s so dim and the cover glass is so reflective, it’s actually hard to see in most normal to bright lighting. When people do see your eyes, it’s a low-res, ghostly image of them that feels like CGI. The effect is uncanny — the idea that you’ll be making real eye contact with anyone is a fantasy. And there are no controls or indicators in visionOS for this external display, so you never really know what other people are seeing. Imagine looking someone directly in the eyes and talking to them without knowing if they can see your eyes — it’s weird! EyeSight is so weird. So, so weird. Photo by Amelia Holowaty Krales / The Vergenone That cover glass hides a huge array of cameras and sensors. There’s a pair of high-res front cameras for the video passthrough, cameras that face down and to the sides to track your hands, a lidar scanner and TrueDepth cameras for spatial tracking, and infrared floodlights so everything can work in low light. Underneath all that, you’ve got an M2 processor and Apple’s new R1 spatial coprocessor and a pair of fans to move the heat from all this tech out the top. The fans were never perceptible during my time testing the Vision Pro, but the heat was: after long sessions, the headset was definitely warm. On the top edge, you’ll find what feel like larger versions of some familiar Apple Watch controls: a digital crown that adjusts both the volume and the level of virtual reality immersion on the right as you look through the headset and a button on the left that lets you take 3D photos and videos. You get two headbands in the box: the solo knit band and the dual loop band. They both attach and detach easily; you snap them right on and then pull the little orange tab to disconnect them. The solo band is unquestionably cooler and messes up your hair slightly less — but they both mess up your hair, so if the dual loop fits you better, just go with it. I found the solo loop much more comfortable; I also wish the mounting points were on the outside face so I could pull the band around my head and clip it on instead of constantly pulling it over my hair. The front of the Vision Pro is covered in cameras and sensors. Photo by Vjeran Pavic / The Vergenone The solo loop is by far the cooler strap. Photo by Amelia Holowaty Krales / The Vergenone The huge case costs an additional 199 and looks like a marshmallow from space. I love it. Photo by Amelia Holowaty Krales / The Vergenone The other two pieces are the light seal, which comes in various sizes, and the headband, which comes in two thicknesses. (You get fitted for these in the store or by scanning your head with an iPhone if you buy online.) Both attach magnetically, which means they also detach magnetically — you want to pick this thing up by the frame because grabbing it by the light seal can lead to disaster. If you have glasses, you can click in custom Zeiss lens inserts — Apple sent us reader lenses to see what that process looks like, but I just used the Vision Pro while wearing my soft contacts, and it was fine. The Vision Pro’s speakers are housed in the arms on the side, and they are good and loud and do a convincing job of rendering spatial audio. Things really sound like they are happening where they appear to be happening, which is a neat trick. The speakers are also pretty leaky, so everyone else around you can hear what you’re up to unless you use headphones. You can use any Bluetooth headphones you want, but you get a bunch of extra features if you use the latest AirPods Pro, like lower latency, lossless 48KHz audio, and Apple’s Adaptive Audio system, which automatically mixes in sound from the real world as appropriate. Since you’ll mostly experience the Vision Pro in there, the most noticeable thing about the hardware after a while is that it’s just… heavy. You’re supposed to wear this thing on your face for long stretches of computer time, and depending on which band and light seal you use, the headset alone weighs between 600 and 650 grams. I keep joking that the Vision Pro is an iPad for your face, but it’s heavier than an 11-inch iPad Pro (470 grams) and pushing close to a 12.9-inch iPad Pro (682 grams), so in a very real way, it’s an iPad for your face. All of the Vision Pro’s heft is totally front-loaded, too. Other big headsets like the Quest Pro (722 grams) have elaborate headbands to balance out their weight, but the Vision Pro just rests it all on the front. Swapping to the dual loop strap helps keep things more stable but doesn’t really reduce the overall sensation of having all that headset on your face. You’re just going to feel it after a while. The Vision Pro’s external battery pack is fine, mostly because it’s such a stationary device overall. Photo by Vjeran Pavic / The Vergenone Notably, the Vision Pro is substantially heavier than the familiar Quest 2 (503g) or even the heavier Quest 3 (515g) — headsets that have built-in batteries. Apple told me that it chose to use an external battery specifically to reduce the headset’s weight. The battery itself is barely worth talking about — it’s a silver brick that weighs another 353 grams with a USB-C port and a motion-activated LED that’s green when it’s charged and orange when it’s not. It connects to the headset with a satisfying twist connector, but the nice braided cable is permanently attached to the battery itself, so don’t break it. You can buy extra batteries for 199, but you can’t hot-swap them; disconnecting the battery from the Vision Pro cuts the power entirely. I don’t really have strong opinions on this battery setup, which is mostly because nothing about the Vision Pro feels like you’re supposed to move around that much in it, so it’s more or less fine. It’s funny that Apple of all companies shipped this compromise, but it’s also very Apple that the battery is not actually bigger so it can provide more than two and a half hours of run time. (If you plug the battery in, the Vision Pro just runs on wall power for as long as you want.) Setting up the Vision Pro is dead simple — the headband adjustments are the only manual adjustments involved. Everything else is motorized and sensor-driven. There’s no fiddly lens wheel to dial in; the headset asks you to hold down the digital crown when you first put it on to adjust the lenses to your eyes, and then you go through a pretty standard eye tracking setup. The rest of the setup is almost exactly like any other iOS device: if you have an iPhone, you can bring it close to the Vision Pro to send over all your settings, and you have to agree to some terms and conditions. If you don’t have an iPhone, you’ll have to enter your passwords and so on manually, but it’ll work fine as a standalone device. After all of that, you’re computing in the future. See? It’s a VR headset. Photo by Vjeran Pavic / The Vergenone Apple is very proud of the displays inside the Vision Pro, and for good reason — they represent a huge leap forward in display technology. The two displays are tiny MicroOLEDs with a total of 23 million pixels that are just 7.5 micrometers in size, which is about the size of a red blood cell. And each of those tiny pixels is composed of three RGB subpixels laid out in what Apple tells me is an S-stripe pattern. Just thinking about the level of precision required to make these displays and then make them work in a device like this is mind-blowing. They also look generally incredible — sharp enough to read text on without even thinking about it, bright enough to do justice to movies. Apple calibrates them for color at the factory so they are also vibrant and color-accurate without looking oversaturated or blown out. They are so small, but they work so well that they seem huge. The displays are the main reason the Vision Pro is so expensive — they’re at the heart of the Vision Pro experience and what makes the whole thing work. You are always looking at them, after all. But for all their technical marvels, they are not without tradeoffs of their own when deployed on a device like this. The speakers are nice and loud and convincing with spatial audio. Photo by Vjeran Pavic / The Vergenone See this thing — a passthrough VR headset with a silly external battery pack and a display that shows ghostly images of your eyes on the front — is not the big goal. The big goal is AR, or augmented reality. In particular, the big goal is optical AR, where light passes directly through unobtrusive glasses to your eyes, with digital information layered over the top of what you’re seeing. AR is a technology with the potential to literally change humanity, and Apple CEO Tim Cook has been talking about how isolating VR headsets are and how important he thinks AR will be for years now. Tim Cook, 2016: “Few people are going to view that it’s acceptable to be enclosed in something.” Tim Cook, 2017: “Unlike Virtual Reality which closes the world out, AR allows individuals to be present in the world.” Tim Cook, 2017: “I also like the fact that [AR] doesn’t isolate [...] I’ve never been a fan of VR like that because I think it does the opposite.” Tim Cook, 2020: “I think [AR is] something that doesn’t isolate people. We can use it to enhance our discussion, not substitute it for human connection, which I’ve always deeply worried about in some of the other technologies.” The problem is that the technology to build a true optical AR display that works well enough to replace an everyday computer just isn’t there yet. The Magic Leap 2 is an optical AR headset that’s cheaper and smaller than the Vision Pro, but it’s plagued by compromises in field of view and image quality that most people would never accept. So Apple’s settled for building a headset with real-time video passthrough — it is the defining tradeoff of the Vision Pro. It is a VR headset masquerading as an AR headset. And let me tell you: the video passthrough on the Vision Pro is really good. It works! It’s convincing. You put the headset on, the display comes on, and you’re right back where you were, only with a bunch of visionOS windows floating around. It sounds simple, but it is an astonishing engineering achievement to do that in real time, at high resolution, in a computer that fits over your eyes. Apple claims there’s only 12ms of latency between what the cameras see and what’s on the display, and that latency includes the exposure time of the cameras themselves. The actual data processing is faster. Do the math, and Apple says there’s not even a frame’s worth of latency; the next frame of video is ready before you’re done looking at the last one. Still cameras, still displays. Photo by Vjeran Pavic / The Vergenone You can also see Apple’s incredible video processing chops right in front of your eyes: I sat around scrolling on my phone while wearing the Vision Pro, with no blown-out screens or weird frame rate issues. I also worked on my Mac in front of a large window while wearing the headset, which is a torture test for dynamic range, and while it wasn’t perfect, it was still usable. It is the best video passthrough that’s ever shipped in a consumer device by far. The problem is that cameras are still cameras, and displays are still displays. All cameras have motion blur, for example. In low light, cameras either have to increase exposure times at the cost of sharpness or increase ISO at the cost of noise, which then requires noise reduction, which makes things blurry and dull. And cameras and displays both have real limits in terms of color reproduction. The Vision Pro cannot overcome the inherent nature of cameras and displays. You can easily see motion blur when you move your head in the Vision Pro — motion blur that increases in low light and leads to some weird warping of straight lines. Low light also causes the overall sharpness of the video passthrough to drop as noise reduction kicks in: my iPhone screen got noticeably blurrier when the sun set. If you’re in a medium-lit room halfway immersed in a dark virtual environment with a bright window open — say, sitting in your kitchen at night with the lights on while writing a review in a Google Docs window floating on a dark beach — you will notice the display brightness slowly ramp up and down as the system tries to average out the brightness of everything you’re looking at. The LCD clock on my microwave flickers when I look at it through these cameras. And Apple’s specs say the display supports 92 percent of the DCI-P3 color gamut, which means the Vision Pro can only show you 49 percent of the colors your eyes can actually see. The displays have other limitations: the field of view isn’t huge, and the essential nature of looking at tiny displays through lenses makes that field of view feel even smaller. Apple won’t tell me the exact number, but the Vision Pro’s field of view is certainly smaller than the Quest 3’s 110 horizontal degrees. That means there are fairly large black borders around what you’re seeing, a bit like you’re looking through binoculars. On top of that, there’s a little bit of distortion and vignetting around the edges of the lenses, and you’ll see some green and pink color fringing at the edges as well, especially in bright environments. All of this makes the usable field of view feel even smaller. If you’re looking at something bright or otherwise high contrast — a white text window floating above a dark desert landscape, for example — you’ll see highlights reflecting in the lenses. A screen capture from the Vision Pro and a simulated view of what it feels like to look in the headset. I asked Apple about all of this, and yep — that’s how it’s supposed to look. Apple spokesperson Jacqueline Roy told me that a combination of hardware and software in the Vision Pro is specifically designed to minimize these various effects, but they’re definitely in there, and you’ll see them. If you have been paying attention to VR for the past decade, you know that these are very familiar VR headset display issues. You’re passing light from a screen through lenses mounted on someone’s face and trying to line those lenses up with their eyes, which are notably in different spots on different people’s faces. (Our bodies are designed very badly when it comes to mounting hardware on them.) So a little weirdness at the edges of the displays is not a deal-breaker or even a surprise — except Apple is charging 3,499 for the Vision Pro and making it sound like these displays are perfect enough for you to casually wear this thing while folding laundry. I’m serious when I say the Vision Pro has the best video passthrough I’ve ever seen on the sharpest VR displays any normal person will ever come across. But you’re still constantly being reminded that you’re looking at video on screens, and reality is just a lot more interesting than that. There are vanishingly few contexts in reviewing consumer devices where anyone has to care about color gamuts — but if you want me to perceive reality through something, I’d like to see all the colors of the rainbow. This is the best anyone has ever made in there look, and it’s still not nearly as good as out here. Waiting. Watching. Ready to mess up your hair at a moment’s notice. Photo by Vjeran Pavic / The Vergenone Controls The other thing Apple is very proud of is the eye and hand tracking control system, which is light years beyond any other consumer hand or eye tracking systems out there. You look at things you want to control, you tap your fingers to control them, and that’s how you get around the entire interface. You’re not reaching out and touching things — it’s more like your eyes are the mouse, and your fingers are the button: you tap them together to click on what you’re looking at. The first few times you use hand and eye tracking on the Vision Pro, it’s awe-inspiring — it feels like a superpower. The Vision Pro’s external cameras just need to see your hands for it to work, and they can see your hands in a pretty large zone around your body. You can have them slung across the back of the couch, resting in your lap, up in the air with your elbows on a table, pretty much anywhere the cameras can see them. It actually takes a minute to realize you don’t have to gesture out in front of you with your hands in the air — and once you figure it out, it’s pretty fun to watch other people instinctively reach their hands up the first time they try the Vision Pro. But the next few times you use hand and eye tracking, it stops feeling like a superpower — and in some cases, it actively makes using the Vision Pro harder. It turns out that having to look at what you want to control is really quite distracting. Think about every other computer in your life: the input mechanism is independent of whatever you’re looking at. On a laptop, you can click on controls and use the keyboard while keeping your focus on a document. On a phone, you can do things like drag sliders in a photo editing app while keeping your eyes focused on what those changes are actually doing to your photo. The Vision Pro simply doesn’t work like that — you have to be looking at something in order to click on it, and that means you are constantly taking your attention away from whatever you’re working on to specifically look at the button you need to press next. I spent some time playing a lovely little game called Stitch that quickly became maddening because I kept looking away from the piece I wanted to move to the place I wanted to move it, which meant I wasn’t picking it up when I tapped my fingers. Reach out and touch faith. Photo by Vjeran Pavic / The Vergenone visionOS feels also designed for an eye tracking system that’s just slightly more precise than it actually is — a lot of controls are just a little too small and a little too close together to let you quickly bop around the system. You have to look, make sure you’re looking at the thing you want, and then tap, or you might end up clicking on the wrong thing. Sometimes the fastest way to select what you want is to look away entirely and try again. It works until it doesn’t. It’s magic until it’s not. Think about it like this: The keyboard and mouse on a Mac directly control the Mac. The click wheel on an iPod directly controlled the iPod. A lot of work has gone into making it feel like the multitouch screen on an iPhone directly controls the phone, and when it goes sideways, like when autocorrect fails or an app doesn’t register your taps, it’s not pleasant. Your eyes and hands aren’t directly controlling the Vision Pro: cameras are watching your eyes and hands and turning that into input, and sometimes the interpretation isn’t perfect. The best example of this is the hilarious on-screen keyboard, which you use by staring at each letter and pinching your fingers to select it or henpecking with two fingers at the floating keys in front of you. It’s not worth using for anything beyond entering a Wi-Fi password — for anything longer, you’ll want to use dictation or connect a Bluetooth keyboard. Why? So you can directly control the input. It’s not a given that the Vision Pro can always see your hands, either. There’s a pretty large bubble around the front of your body where the cameras can see your hands — it basically extends the length of your arms in a semicircle around the front of your body. But if you lean back in a chair with your arm at your side, it can’t see your hand. If you’re sitting at a table and your hands are on your legs, it might not see your hands. If you’re lying down in a dark room and the IR illuminators can’t reach your hands, the cameras might not be able to see them. If you’re simply standing up with your arms at your sides, it might not be able to see your hands if they drift too far backward. Photo by Vjeran Pavic / The Vergenone I recognize that it is fundamentally silly to complain about a hand tracking system needing to see your hands, and it is possible to navigate quite a lot of visionOS with Siri and dictation: you can manage apps, open different virtual immersions, and so on. If you squint, you can see a glimpse of how a computer that you use by talking to it and manipulating things in space might one day work. But right now, the limits are obvious. Using the Vision Pro makes you constantly aware of what you are looking at and where your hands are in a way that is unlike any other computer I’ve ever used. When it fails, it’s maddening. (Oddly, Apple’s newest watches can detect a pinching gesture, but there’s no ability to use those as control devices on the Vision Pro.) The flip side is that a system that’s constantly watching your hands for input tends to register a lot of extra inputs, which can be very funny. I talk through writing video scripts to make sure things flow, and I talk with my hands. So as I was writing the video script for this review in the Vision Pro, the system kept catching my hands moving and started scrolling and clicking on things by accident. I cracked up the first time I realized what was happening. But eventually, it meant that I took the Vision Pro off and wrote the rest of the script on my Mac, which only does things when I actually want it to. Just as with the displays, I think this is the best eye and hand tracking system anyone’s ever shipped. It really can feel like magic… until it doesn’t. And if you want people to do their computing in there, the input system needs to be absolutely rock solid. Personas I won’t go into that much detail on Apple’s deeply weird and extremely uncanny 3D persona system here — the best way to understand them is by watching the video review above, which features a FaceTime call between The Wall Street Journal’s Joanna Stern, Marques Brownlee, and me, all using our personas. To quote Marques, personas are really impressive and also really bad. You can see why Apple put the beta label on them; there’s a long way to go before using a persona on a call isn’t distracting at best and, at worst, extremely rude. I will say, Joanna’s persona accurately captured her reaction to personas in general here. Marques looks like he’s happy to welcome me into PlayStation Home. One small note: personas can show up whenever an app calls for a front-facing camera, so they work in basically everything. I used mine on a Google Meet call in Safari just fine, although the other people on the Meet call did not think it was fine at all. Spatial cameras I would not recommend shooting photos in the Vision Pro unless you really need to. Pressing the shutter button a single time delivers a 2560 x 2560 still, which works out to 6.5 megapixels. As far as I can tell, it’s always from the left main camera, which the EXIF data says has an 18mm f/2.0 lens. The photos look like 6.5-megapixel photos from a tiny camera sensor optimized for video, which is to say that they look pretty bad. Video is slightly better — the Vision Pro shoots 2200 x 2200 square videos at 30fps. They look a little better than the photos, but there’s still an awful lot of compression going on, and if you happen to watch them on anything but a Vision Pro, you’ll notice some barrel distortion as the camera moves around. None of this feels particularly important: I really can’t think of situations where I’d want to be taking video with the headset on since all these videos and screen captures come with a ton of excess motion from your head moving around. Also, you will look fundamentally ridiculous trying to take photos of your family with this thing on your face. I think it’s fair to assume most Vision Pro buyers also own iPhones, which take great videos, so whatever. One thing that is very convincing is taking spatial videos on the iPhone 15 Pro Max and watching them in 3D on the Vision Pro. I took some videos of my daughter at the zoo and around Christmas time, and like any dad, I could probably watch them over and over again forever. They play back in a sort of ghostly white haze, and the overall effect is incredibly bittersweet — you can relive a brief memory, but you’re alone in the headset and can’t share it with anyone else. The other problem is that, currently, you can choose to shoot iPhone video in spatial in 1080p at 30fps or at the full 4K resolution the phone supports but not both. For now, I’m going to stick with the higher-res video, but there’s going to come a time where shooting in spatial by default is the smart move, and that will be a real turning point. visionOS The Vision Pro runs visionOS, which Apple says is based on iPadOS, with a lot of customization around latency and vision to make it work for spatial computing. Starting with the iPad as a foundation represents an incredible head start for Apple — it’s taken years for Meta to build out all the features of the Android-based Quest OS and populate its app store, and it’s still mostly games. Apple gets to start with the full set of mature iPadOS features and most of the huge iPad app library. It’s funny to keep saying that the Vision Pro is an iPad for your face, but when it comes to the current set of apps, it’s also not totally wrong. Most of them work like iPad apps, and the homescreen comes preloaded with a folder labeled “compatible apps” that’s full of actual iPad apps. It’s hard to judge the app ecosystem for a product that has barely launched, but I feel totally comfortable judging the iPad app ecosystem at this point, and Apple shipping its own podcast and news apps as iPad apps on the Vision Pro feels like a sign in a lot of ways. Photo by Vjeran Pavic / The Vergenone There’s already controversy in the world of Vision Pro apps: some huge developers like Netflix, Spotify, and YouTube have decided to wait before allowing their apps to run on the Vision Pro and aren’t even allowing their iPad apps to run. As always, the open web serves as the pressure release valve for Apple developer politics, and Safari on the Vision Pro is a capable riff on iPad Safari: I watched Netflix in Safari and it worked without a hitch, although you can’t put the video in a nice environment like you can with the native apps. I also watched the NFL playoffs on YouTube TV in Safari on the Vision Pro, and it worked with a few minor hiccups, although it did keep asking me to confirm my location over and over again. The stranger thing is that Safari on the Vision Pro is pretty disconnected from web-based 3D experiences. Apple has made noise about supporting the WebXR standard, and there are flags in Safari’s advanced preferences to turn on support, but it’s pretty hit-or-miss in terms of actually working right now — it mostly does not. I asked about this, and Apple told me that it is actively contributing to WebXR and wants to “work with the community to help deliver great spatial computing experiences via the web.” So let’s give that one a minute and see how it goes. On the other hand, I asked Apple why the huge library of VR video on YouTube doesn’t work at all on the Vision Pro, and the company basically told me it wasn’t good enough to support, saying that “much of this content was created for devices that do not deliver a high-quality spatial experience” and that the company’s efforts were instead focused on “delivering the best spatial media experience possible including spatial photos and videos, Apple Immersive Video, and 3D movies available on Apple TV.” Translation: don’t hold your breath for YouTube VR support. Photo by Amelia Holowaty Krales / The Vergenone The really big difference between visionOS and iPadOS is that iPadOS has a lot of opinions about how you can arrange apps and how many apps you can run at a time, and visionOS is full-on free-floating window chaos. I love it. It is bananas. You can open as many apps as you want and put them anywhere you want in space. You can open windows in the kitchen, walk away from them and open some more in the living room, and then go back to the kitchen to find all your old windows waiting for you. Late one night, I made an art gallery of giant Safari windows in our office’s large open cafe area and walked around, looking at huge webpages for a while. I am telling you, it is wild. Sadly, visionOS doesn’t have any ability to share these windows or experiences with anyone else: two people in Vision Pro headsets sitting in the same room can’t see the same things floating in space at the same time. Apple tells me some enterprise developers are working on experiences with shared views, and you can mirror the view from one Vision Pro to another over FaceTime, but in the end, my big Safari art gallery only ever had one patron: me. It’s amazing you can do all of this, but it is also quite lonely to put things all over a space knowing no one else will ever really experience it. To move windows around, you just grab the bar at the bottom and put it wherever you want to in space. You can layer windows, you can put them directly above your head, you can put them on the floor — you can really just do whatever you want. To switch between them, you just look at the window you want and tap your fingers; inactive windows go slightly translucent, which means all kinds of things can be happening at once all over your space. On top of that, you can have apps from three different operating systems on-screen at the same time: native visionOS apps; iPad apps; and then you can also connect your Mac via Wi-Fi and have a whole Mac display with all the chaotic glory of macOS floating around in space. One area where visionOS has clear room to improve is window management. There’s no Exposé or Stage Manager to collect all your open windows in front of you or put them into preset arrangements, and the management that does exist is not exactly discoverable or intuitively laid out. You can tap and hold the X button in one app to hide all your other apps. If you want to hide everything, you double-click the digital crown on the headset itself. If you want to close all apps, you just ask Siri; if you want to quit a misbehaving app, you hold down the top button and the digital crown simultaneously to bring up a force quit window. It’s a lot of different ideas all at once. Once you figure out the moves, you can get around, but it takes a minute, and it means you’ll be thinking about window management more than any other iOS device I can think of and maybe even more than a Mac, which has four decades of window management ideas built into it. Photo by Amelia Holowaty Krales / The Vergenone Speaking of the Mac, I know a lot of people are excited about the idea of buying a Vision Pro just to put up giant virtual monitors. There’s good news and bad news about that. The good news is that Mac display sharing works really well, and Apple ecosystem tricks like Handoff and Continuity are pure magic in this context. You can copy on your Mac and paste in visionOS, and it just works. You can open your Mac display in visionOS and drag the mouse off the screen, and suddenly, your Mac’s keyboard and trackpad are controlling visionOS apps. It works just like it does between a Mac and an iPad. I found myself putting a virtual Mac display over my MacBook Pro’s screen and making it look like I had a 50-inch laptop to use Lightroom with — it’s awesome. There is a lot of very complicated display scaling going on behind the scenes here, but the easiest way to think about it is that you’re basically getting a 27-inch Retina display, like you’d find on an iMac or Studio Display. Your Mac thinks it’s connected to a 5K display with a resolution of 5120 x 2880, and it runs macOS at a 2:1 logical resolution of 2560 x 1440, just like a 5K display. (You can pick other resolutions, but the device warns you that they’ll be lower quality.) That virtual display is then streamed as a 4K 3560 x 2880 video to the Vision Pro, where you can just make it as big as you want. The upshot of all of this is that 4K content runs at a native 4K resolution — it has all the pixels to do it, just like an iMac — but you have a grand total of 2560 x 1440 to place windows in, regardless of how big you make the Mac display in space, and you’re not seeing a pixel-perfect 5K image. It is incredible that all of this works with just a single button click, but all that scaling complication also explains the bad news: you can only have a single Mac display in visionOS. You can’t have multiple Mac monitors floating in space. Maybe next time. Photo by Vjeran Pavic / The Vergenone One of the weirder things about visionOS (and the Vision Pro itself, really) is that there’s not a lot of true AR in the mix — as in, actual interaction between physical objects in your space and digital ones. After all these years of Apple talking about AR, I counted exactly three things in my entire time with the Vision Pro that offered a preview of the AR future. One: when you look at your Mac, the Vision Pro sometimes puts up a “connect display” button above it that starts screen sharing. Two: when you’re typing on a Bluetooth keyboard and look down at your hands, it puts a little text preview window above the keyboard so you can see what you’re typing. These are little features, yes, but they are some of the first true AR computing features that have ever shipped on a mainstream device, and they are an incredibly tantalizing glimpse of what might be possible. They also happen to be incredibly useful. The third AR thing I saw was the loading screen of Super Fruit Ninja, which allows you to throw a strawberry at a pig that’s running around on your floor. This seems slightly less historic. That’s more or less it. There’s not a lot of reality being augmented in the rest of visionOS. There’s an awful lot of what you might call mixed reality: virtual objects floating around in space with no connection to anything real. All those app windows floating around are doing so independently of the physical environment. And in the entertainment context, where Apple lets the Vision Pro fall back into being the VR headset it fundamentally is, it absolutely shines. Watching movies on the Vision Pro is a ton of fun, especially in the Apple TV app’s immersive movie theater that lets you pick where you want to sit. It’s also very cool to watch a movie in one of Apple’s virtual environments like Mount Hood and see the colors from the screen reflect onto the landscape or look around one of the Disney Plus environments like Avengers Tower. And movies themselves look great — the incredible quality of the Vision Pro’s displays is really obvious when you’re watching something. I watched far more of Top Gun: Maverick than I intended to just because it looked so good blown up to drive-in movie size, floating over a mountain. Photo by Amelia Holowaty Krales / The Vergenone Since the Vision Pro sends separate images to each eye, it can do true 3D movies — and Apple and its partners like Disney have already released quite a few. If you have a large Apple movie library, you get the 3D versions for free — you just choose 2D or 3D playback when you hit play. Apple is also making immersive versions of some of its Apple TV Plus shows, which basically means a 180ish-degree 3D video that feels like the best Google Cardboard demo of all time. I watched someone walk a tightrope in Adventure, and it was very convincing — but if you’ve never tried this before, I’d be careful that you get used to VR motion before diving into 3D videos. Apple has also promised immersive sports content, but sadly, I wasn’t able to try any of that yet. You can get pretty far making the argument that the Vision Pro is worth it simply as a very expensive TV — but after a while, the weight of it reminds you that this very nice TV is resting on your face. (I usually made it about 30 minutes to an hour before wanting a break.) It’s also a very expensive TV that doesn’t have HDMI inputs, so you’re limited to Apple’s gaming library, which feels deeply unfair. And unlike any other TV in your life, the Vision Pro can literally DRM your eyes — if you’re watching a movie in the Apple TV app or Disney Plus and go to take a screen capture, the content blacks out. It’s strange to experience a reality where big companies can block you from capturing what you see, even if all you’re trying to do is show people how cool it looks in a review. You can get around DRM screenshots on an iPhone by just taking a photo of the screen, but there’s no such off-ramp for the Vision Pro. Speaking of gaming, there aren’t any real VR games or fitness apps here — there’s nothing like Beat Saber or Red Matter or Population: One, all hit games on the Quest. Fitness, in particular, has helped the Quest reach a more mainstream market: Supernatural’s Chris Milk told me in 2021 that his user base is 50 / 50 men and women, 60 percent of whom are over 40. That led to Meta buying Supernatural outright because it was worried about Apple buying it first. Yet, there’s just nothing like that on the Vision Pro at launch, even though Apple is so focused on fitness and health across its other devices. I think it’s because the Vision Pro just doesn’t seem suited to those kinds of physical game experiences — it’s heavy, with that external battery, and it’s hard to see how some of these games would even work without controllers. Apple tells me that game developers working in Unity are hard at work porting over more games and that visionOS allows developers to come up with custom hand gestures, which might solve for some of the controller issues — I was able to try a prerelease version of Super Fruit Ninja that used a custom slashing gesture in a briefing, and it seemed to work well, but that was about it so far. One note about VR motion in the Vision Pro: it doesn’t really do anything to protect you from yourself. I am fairly comfortable in VR — my wife and I use Supernatural, and I went through a brief, delightful period of being absolutely addicted to Gran Turismo 7 VR on the PSVR 2. I am pretty aware of my limits in VR motion, and I can do most things without a problem. But the Vision Pro is so convincing and so unconcerned with whether you might have any limits that you can easily go too far too fast and get yourself a little queasy. I watched five minutes of Avatar: The Way of Water in 3D in Disney Plus — the Vision Pro is the first consumer device to support high frame rate movies in 3D! — and immediately needed to stop because the motion was just too much. I recommend early adopters go slowly and make sure you find your limits gently. That first bout of VR motion sickness is no joke. Wrap up The Vision Pro is an astounding product. It’s the sort of first-generation device only Apple can really make, from the incredible display and passthrough engineering, to the use of the whole ecosystem to make it so seamlessly useful, to even getting everyone to pretty much ignore the whole external battery situation. There’s a part of me that says the Vision Pro only exists because Apple is so incredibly capable, stocked with talent, and loaded with resources that the company simply went out and engineered the hell out of the hardest problems it could think of in order to find a challenge. That’s good! There are a lot of ideas in the Vision Pro, and they’re all executed with the kind of thoughtful intention that few other companies can ever deliver at all, let alone on the first iteration. But the shocking thing is that Apple may have inadvertently revealed that some of these core ideas are actually dead ends — that they can’t ever be executed well enough to become mainstream. This is the best video passthrough headset ever made, and that might mean camera-based mixed reality passthrough could just be a road to nowhere. This is the best hand- and eye-tracking ever, and it feels like the mouse, keyboard, and touchscreen are going to remain undefeated for years to come. There is so much technology in this thing that feels like magic when it works and frustrates you completely when it doesn’t. Photo by Amelia Holowaty Krales / The Vergenone The other way to look at the Vision Pro is that Apple knows all of this, but the technology to build the true AR glasses it has long hinted at is simply not there — so the Vision Pro represents something like a simulator or a developer kit. A dream factory for people to build apps and meaningful use cases for the imagined hardware yet to come: true optical AR glasses that let you share digital experiences with other people. In that framework, this Vision Pro is the hardware Apple can ship right now to get everyone thinking about these ideas while it pours all those resources into the hardware it wants to build. Maybe! It’s fun to think about that possibility, and a lot of people have already assumed that’s the case. But one of the oldest rules we have here at The Verge is that you have to review what’s in the box — the product that’s shipping today, not the promise of improvements yet to come. And so I keep coming back to all the questions I’ve been asking myself ever since I first strapped the Vision Pro onto my head. Starting, of course, with the most important: Do you want a computer that messes up your hair every time you use it? Do you want a computer that smears your makeup every time you use it, if you wear makeup? Do you want a computer that allows the Walt Disney Company to prevent you from taking pictures of what you see? Do you want to use a computer where you easily can’t show anyone else what you’re looking at? Do you think the fanciest TV you own should have HDMI inputs? Do you want to use a computer that doesn’t work as well in a dark room? Do you want to use a computer that is always looking at your hands? That is a lot of tradeoffs — big tradeoffs, not little ones. And the biggest tradeoff of all is that using the Vision Pro is such a lonely experience, regardless of the weird ghost eyes on the front. You’re in there, having experiences all by yourself that no one else can take part in. After using the Vision Pro for a while, I’ve come to agree with what Tim Cook has been saying for so long: headsets are inherently isolating. That’s fine for traditional VR headsets, which have basically turned into single-use game consoles over the past decade, but it’s a lot weirder for a primary computing device. I don’t want to get work done in the Vision Pro. I get my work done with other people, and I’d rather be out here with them.","output":"애플 비전 프로: 혁신적이나 무거움과 고립감이 문제"},{"instruction":"Read the article below and summarize the key takeaways in 500 characters.

Apple Vision Pro review: magic, until it’s not The Apple Vision Pro is the best consumer headset anyone’s ever made — and that’s the problem. Nilay PatelJan 30, 2024 at 11:00 PM GMT+9 There’s a lot of pressure on the new Apple Vision Pro, Apple’s long-awaited entry into the world of computers you wear on your face. Apple claims that the Vision Pro, which starts at 3,499, is the beginning of something called “spatial computing,” which basically boils down to running apps all around you. And the company’s ads for it do not hedge that pressure even a little: they show people wearing the Vision Pro all the time. At work! Doing laundry! Playing with their kids! The ambition is enormous: to layer apps and information over the real world — to augment reality. Apple has to claim that the Vision Pro is the beginning of something new because people have been building headset computers for over a decade now. I tried on a development prototype of the first Oculus Rift in 2013, and The Verge’s Adi Robertson, who edited this review, has tried basically every headset that’s been released since. All of that development means there are some pretty good products out there: that first Oculus evolved into the Quest line at Meta, which is now shipping the Quest 3 — a very good VR headset with a huge library of games and some AR features of its own, which costs 500. 7Verge Score 3499 at Apple How we rate and review products In the meantime, Apple, from Tim Cook on down, has largely insisted that augmented reality will be much more valuable than virtual reality. And it’s been building toward AR for a long time: developers have access to AR tools in iOS, and higher-end iPhones and iPads have had lidar depth scanners for a few years now. The Vision Pro is Apple’s first attempt at building a computer out of all those ideas — a computer that works in the space around you. The goal is for the Vision Pro to be a complete device that can sit right alongside the Mac and the iPad in Apple’s ecosystem of devices and let you get real work done. You can use Excel and Webex and Slack in the Vision Pro, and you can also sit back and watch movies and TV shows on a gigantic virtual 4K HDR display. And you can mirror your Mac’s display and just use the Vision Pro to look at a huge monitor floating in virtual space. It sounds amazing, and sometimes it is. But the Vision Pro also represents a series of really big tradeoffs — tradeoffs that are impossible to ignore. Some of those tradeoffs are very tangible: getting all this tech in a headset means there’s a lot of weight on your face, so Apple chose to use an external battery pack connected by a cable. But there are other, more philosophical tradeoffs as well. As I’ve been using it for the past few days, I kept coming up with a series of questions — questions about whether the tradeoffs were worth it. Is using the Vision Pro so good that I’m willing to mess up my hair every time I put it on? Is it so good that I want to lug it around in its giant carrying case instead of my laptop bag? Is it so good that I want to look at the world around me through screens instead of with my own eyes? Basically, I keep asking if I prefer using a computer in there rather than out here. And as interesting as the Vision Pro is, there’s a long way to go before it can beat out here. Photo by Vjeran Pavic / The Vergenone Hardware Apple doesn’t want anyone to think of the Vision Pro as a VR headset, but it’s a VR headset — albeit a VR headset that almost lets you pretend it’s not a VR headset. You put it on your head in a way that blocks out your vision entirely, and then it shows you a 3D video feed of the world around you passed through from the cameras on the front, as though you can see right through the device. But it can also put you in virtual reality, at various levels of immersion: I spent some time working entirely on the Moon and a lot of time in my kitchen with a bunch of windows floating around a portal into Joshua Tree. The Vision Pro is stunning compared to other VR headsets, which are largely plastic and often downright goofy-looking. The Vision Pro, by contrast, is built of magnesium and carbon fiber in an aluminum enclosure that feels like a natural extension of Apple’s familiar design language. There’s a little iPhone 6 in there, a little AirPods Max, a little Apple Watch. It is the cutting edge of technology in a package that seems instantly familiar. Almost everyone I’ve shown it to thinks it looks smaller in person than they expected, especially compared to some of the huge VR headsets we’ve seen over the past decade. The front display on the Vision Pro is an attempt at keeping you from being isolated from other people while you’re wearing it. In Apple’s photos, it looks like a big, bright screen that shows a video of your eyes to people around you so they feel comfortable talking to you while you’re wearing the headset — a feature adorably called EyeSight. In reality, it might as well not be there. It’s a low-res OLED with a lenticular panel in front of it to provide a mild 3D effect, and it’s so dim and the cover glass is so reflective, it’s actually hard to see in most normal to bright lighting. When people do see your eyes, it’s a low-res, ghostly image of them that feels like CGI. The effect is uncanny — the idea that you’ll be making real eye contact with anyone is a fantasy. And there are no controls or indicators in visionOS for this external display, so you never really know what other people are seeing. Imagine looking someone directly in the eyes and talking to them without knowing if they can see your eyes — it’s weird! EyeSight is so weird. So, so weird. Photo by Amelia Holowaty Krales / The Vergenone That cover glass hides a huge array of cameras and sensors. There’s a pair of high-res front cameras for the video passthrough, cameras that face down and to the sides to track your hands, a lidar scanner and TrueDepth cameras for spatial tracking, and infrared floodlights so everything can work in low light. Underneath all that, you’ve got an M2 processor and Apple’s new R1 spatial coprocessor and a pair of fans to move the heat from all this tech out the top. The fans were never perceptible during my time testing the Vision Pro, but the heat was: after long sessions, the headset was definitely warm. On the top edge, you’ll find what feel like larger versions of some familiar Apple Watch controls: a digital crown that adjusts both the volume and the level of virtual reality immersion on the right as you look through the headset and a button on the left that lets you take 3D photos and videos. You get two headbands in the box: the solo knit band and the dual loop band. They both attach and detach easily; you snap them right on and then pull the little orange tab to disconnect them. The solo band is unquestionably cooler and messes up your hair slightly less — but they both mess up your hair, so if the dual loop fits you better, just go with it. I found the solo loop much more comfortable; I also wish the mounting points were on the outside face so I could pull the band around my head and clip it on instead of constantly pulling it over my hair. The front of the Vision Pro is covered in cameras and sensors. Photo by Vjeran Pavic / The Vergenone The solo loop is by far the cooler strap. Photo by Amelia Holowaty Krales / The Vergenone The huge case costs an additional 199 and looks like a marshmallow from space. I love it. Photo by Amelia Holowaty Krales / The Vergenone The other two pieces are the light seal, which comes in various sizes, and the headband, which comes in two thicknesses. (You get fitted for these in the store or by scanning your head with an iPhone if you buy online.) Both attach magnetically, which means they also detach magnetically — you want to pick this thing up by the frame because grabbing it by the light seal can lead to disaster. If you have glasses, you can click in custom Zeiss lens inserts — Apple sent us reader lenses to see what that process looks like, but I just used the Vision Pro while wearing my soft contacts, and it was fine. The Vision Pro’s speakers are housed in the arms on the side, and they are good and loud and do a convincing job of rendering spatial audio. Things really sound like they are happening where they appear to be happening, which is a neat trick. The speakers are also pretty leaky, so everyone else around you can hear what you’re up to unless you use headphones. You can use any Bluetooth headphones you want, but you get a bunch of extra features if you use the latest AirPods Pro, like lower latency, lossless 48KHz audio, and Apple’s Adaptive Audio system, which automatically mixes in sound from the real world as appropriate. Since you’ll mostly experience the Vision Pro in there, the most noticeable thing about the hardware after a while is that it’s just… heavy. You’re supposed to wear this thing on your face for long stretches of computer time, and depending on which band and light seal you use, the headset alone weighs between 600 and 650 grams. I keep joking that the Vision Pro is an iPad for your face, but it’s heavier than an 11-inch iPad Pro (470 grams) and pushing close to a 12.9-inch iPad Pro (682 grams), so in a very real way, it’s an iPad for your face. All of the Vision Pro’s heft is totally front-loaded, too. Other big headsets like the Quest Pro (722 grams) have elaborate headbands to balance out their weight, but the Vision Pro just rests it all on the front. Swapping to the dual loop strap helps keep things more stable but doesn’t really reduce the overall sensation of having all that headset on your face. You’re just going to feel it after a while. The Vision Pro’s external battery pack is fine, mostly because it’s such a stationary device overall. Photo by Vjeran Pavic / The Vergenone Notably, the Vision Pro is substantially heavier than the familiar Quest 2 (503g) or even the heavier Quest 3 (515g) — headsets that have built-in batteries. Apple told me that it chose to use an external battery specifically to reduce the headset’s weight. The battery itself is barely worth talking about — it’s a silver brick that weighs another 353 grams with a USB-C port and a motion-activated LED that’s green when it’s charged and orange when it’s not. It connects to the headset with a satisfying twist connector, but the nice braided cable is permanently attached to the battery itself, so don’t break it. You can buy extra batteries for 199, but you can’t hot-swap them; disconnecting the battery from the Vision Pro cuts the power entirely. I don’t really have strong opinions on this battery setup, which is mostly because nothing about the Vision Pro feels like you’re supposed to move around that much in it, so it’s more or less fine. It’s funny that Apple of all companies shipped this compromise, but it’s also very Apple that the battery is not actually bigger so it can provide more than two and a half hours of run time. (If you plug the battery in, the Vision Pro just runs on wall power for as long as you want.) Setting up the Vision Pro is dead simple — the headband adjustments are the only manual adjustments involved. Everything else is motorized and sensor-driven. There’s no fiddly lens wheel to dial in; the headset asks you to hold down the digital crown when you first put it on to adjust the lenses to your eyes, and then you go through a pretty standard eye tracking setup. The rest of the setup is almost exactly like any other iOS device: if you have an iPhone, you can bring it close to the Vision Pro to send over all your settings, and you have to agree to some terms and conditions. If you don’t have an iPhone, you’ll have to enter your passwords and so on manually, but it’ll work fine as a standalone device. After all of that, you’re computing in the future. See? It’s a VR headset. Photo by Vjeran Pavic / The Vergenone Apple is very proud of the displays inside the Vision Pro, and for good reason — they represent a huge leap forward in display technology. The two displays are tiny MicroOLEDs with a total of 23 million pixels that are just 7.5 micrometers in size, which is about the size of a red blood cell. And each of those tiny pixels is composed of three RGB subpixels laid out in what Apple tells me is an S-stripe pattern. Just thinking about the level of precision required to make these displays and then make them work in a device like this is mind-blowing. They also look generally incredible — sharp enough to read text on without even thinking about it, bright enough to do justice to movies. Apple calibrates them for color at the factory so they are also vibrant and color-accurate without looking oversaturated or blown out. They are so small, but they work so well that they seem huge. The displays are the main reason the Vision Pro is so expensive — they’re at the heart of the Vision Pro experience and what makes the whole thing work. You are always looking at them, after all. But for all their technical marvels, they are not without tradeoffs of their own when deployed on a device like this. The speakers are nice and loud and convincing with spatial audio. Photo by Vjeran Pavic / The Vergenone See this thing — a passthrough VR headset with a silly external battery pack and a display that shows ghostly images of your eyes on the front — is not the big goal. The big goal is AR, or augmented reality. In particular, the big goal is optical AR, where light passes directly through unobtrusive glasses to your eyes, with digital information layered over the top of what you’re seeing. AR is a technology with the potential to literally change humanity, and Apple CEO Tim Cook has been talking about how isolating VR headsets are and how important he thinks AR will be for years now. Tim Cook, 2016: “Few people are going to view that it’s acceptable to be enclosed in something.” Tim Cook, 2017: “Unlike Virtual Reality which closes the world out, AR allows individuals to be present in the world.” Tim Cook, 2017: “I also like the fact that [AR] doesn’t isolate [...] I’ve never been a fan of VR like that because I think it does the opposite.” Tim Cook, 2020: “I think [AR is] something that doesn’t isolate people. We can use it to enhance our discussion, not substitute it for human connection, which I’ve always deeply worried about in some of the other technologies.” The problem is that the technology to build a true optical AR display that works well enough to replace an everyday computer just isn’t there yet. The Magic Leap 2 is an optical AR headset that’s cheaper and smaller than the Vision Pro, but it’s plagued by compromises in field of view and image quality that most people would never accept. So Apple’s settled for building a headset with real-time video passthrough — it is the defining tradeoff of the Vision Pro. It is a VR headset masquerading as an AR headset. And let me tell you: the video passthrough on the Vision Pro is really good. It works! It’s convincing. You put the headset on, the display comes on, and you’re right back where you were, only with a bunch of visionOS windows floating around. It sounds simple, but it is an astonishing engineering achievement to do that in real time, at high resolution, in a computer that fits over your eyes. Apple claims there’s only 12ms of latency between what the cameras see and what’s on the display, and that latency includes the exposure time of the cameras themselves. The actual data processing is faster. Do the math, and Apple says there’s not even a frame’s worth of latency; the next frame of video is ready before you’re done looking at the last one. Still cameras, still displays. Photo by Vjeran Pavic / The Vergenone You can also see Apple’s incredible video processing chops right in front of your eyes: I sat around scrolling on my phone while wearing the Vision Pro, with no blown-out screens or weird frame rate issues. I also worked on my Mac in front of a large window while wearing the headset, which is a torture test for dynamic range, and while it wasn’t perfect, it was still usable. It is the best video passthrough that’s ever shipped in a consumer device by far. The problem is that cameras are still cameras, and displays are still displays. All cameras have motion blur, for example. In low light, cameras either have to increase exposure times at the cost of sharpness or increase ISO at the cost of noise, which then requires noise reduction, which makes things blurry and dull. And cameras and displays both have real limits in terms of color reproduction. The Vision Pro cannot overcome the inherent nature of cameras and displays. You can easily see motion blur when you move your head in the Vision Pro — motion blur that increases in low light and leads to some weird warping of straight lines. Low light also causes the overall sharpness of the video passthrough to drop as noise reduction kicks in: my iPhone screen got noticeably blurrier when the sun set. If you’re in a medium-lit room halfway immersed in a dark virtual environment with a bright window open — say, sitting in your kitchen at night with the lights on while writing a review in a Google Docs window floating on a dark beach — you will notice the display brightness slowly ramp up and down as the system tries to average out the brightness of everything you’re looking at. The LCD clock on my microwave flickers when I look at it through these cameras. And Apple’s specs say the display supports 92 percent of the DCI-P3 color gamut, which means the Vision Pro can only show you 49 percent of the colors your eyes can actually see. The displays have other limitations: the field of view isn’t huge, and the essential nature of looking at tiny displays through lenses makes that field of view feel even smaller. Apple won’t tell me the exact number, but the Vision Pro’s field of view is certainly smaller than the Quest 3’s 110 horizontal degrees. That means there are fairly large black borders around what you’re seeing, a bit like you’re looking through binoculars. On top of that, there’s a little bit of distortion and vignetting around the edges of the lenses, and you’ll see some green and pink color fringing at the edges as well, especially in bright environments. All of this makes the usable field of view feel even smaller. If you’re looking at something bright or otherwise high contrast — a white text window floating above a dark desert landscape, for example — you’ll see highlights reflecting in the lenses. A screen capture from the Vision Pro and a simulated view of what it feels like to look in the headset. I asked Apple about all of this, and yep — that’s how it’s supposed to look. Apple spokesperson Jacqueline Roy told me that a combination of hardware and software in the Vision Pro is specifically designed to minimize these various effects, but they’re definitely in there, and you’ll see them. If you have been paying attention to VR for the past decade, you know that these are very familiar VR headset display issues. You’re passing light from a screen through lenses mounted on someone’s face and trying to line those lenses up with their eyes, which are notably in different spots on different people’s faces. (Our bodies are designed very badly when it comes to mounting hardware on them.) So a little weirdness at the edges of the displays is not a deal-breaker or even a surprise — except Apple is charging 3,499 for the Vision Pro and making it sound like these displays are perfect enough for you to casually wear this thing while folding laundry. I’m serious when I say the Vision Pro has the best video passthrough I’ve ever seen on the sharpest VR displays any normal person will ever come across. But you’re still constantly being reminded that you’re looking at video on screens, and reality is just a lot more interesting than that. There are vanishingly few contexts in reviewing consumer devices where anyone has to care about color gamuts — but if you want me to perceive reality through something, I’d like to see all the colors of the rainbow. This is the best anyone has ever made in there look, and it’s still not nearly as good as out here. Waiting. Watching. Ready to mess up your hair at a moment’s notice. Photo by Vjeran Pavic / The Vergenone Controls The other thing Apple is very proud of is the eye and hand tracking control system, which is light years beyond any other consumer hand or eye tracking systems out there. You look at things you want to control, you tap your fingers to control them, and that’s how you get around the entire interface. You’re not reaching out and touching things — it’s more like your eyes are the mouse, and your fingers are the button: you tap them together to click on what you’re looking at. The first few times you use hand and eye tracking on the Vision Pro, it’s awe-inspiring — it feels like a superpower. The Vision Pro’s external cameras just need to see your hands for it to work, and they can see your hands in a pretty large zone around your body. You can have them slung across the back of the couch, resting in your lap, up in the air with your elbows on a table, pretty much anywhere the cameras can see them. It actually takes a minute to realize you don’t have to gesture out in front of you with your hands in the air — and once you figure it out, it’s pretty fun to watch other people instinctively reach their hands up the first time they try the Vision Pro. But the next few times you use hand and eye tracking, it stops feeling like a superpower — and in some cases, it actively makes using the Vision Pro harder. It turns out that having to look at what you want to control is really quite distracting. Think about every other computer in your life: the input mechanism is independent of whatever you’re looking at. On a laptop, you can click on controls and use the keyboard while keeping your focus on a document. On a phone, you can do things like drag sliders in a photo editing app while keeping your eyes focused on what those changes are actually doing to your photo. The Vision Pro simply doesn’t work like that — you have to be looking at something in order to click on it, and that means you are constantly taking your attention away from whatever you’re working on to specifically look at the button you need to press next. I spent some time playing a lovely little game called Stitch that quickly became maddening because I kept looking away from the piece I wanted to move to the place I wanted to move it, which meant I wasn’t picking it up when I tapped my fingers. Reach out and touch faith. Photo by Vjeran Pavic / The Vergenone visionOS feels also designed for an eye tracking system that’s just slightly more precise than it actually is — a lot of controls are just a little too small and a little too close together to let you quickly bop around the system. You have to look, make sure you’re looking at the thing you want, and then tap, or you might end up clicking on the wrong thing. Sometimes the fastest way to select what you want is to look away entirely and try again. It works until it doesn’t. It’s magic until it’s not. Think about it like this: The keyboard and mouse on a Mac directly control the Mac. The click wheel on an iPod directly controlled the iPod. A lot of work has gone into making it feel like the multitouch screen on an iPhone directly controls the phone, and when it goes sideways, like when autocorrect fails or an app doesn’t register your taps, it’s not pleasant. Your eyes and hands aren’t directly controlling the Vision Pro: cameras are watching your eyes and hands and turning that into input, and sometimes the interpretation isn’t perfect. The best example of this is the hilarious on-screen keyboard, which you use by staring at each letter and pinching your fingers to select it or henpecking with two fingers at the floating keys in front of you. It’s not worth using for anything beyond entering a Wi-Fi password — for anything longer, you’ll want to use dictation or connect a Bluetooth keyboard. Why? So you can directly control the input. It’s not a given that the Vision Pro can always see your hands, either. There’s a pretty large bubble around the front of your body where the cameras can see your hands — it basically extends the length of your arms in a semicircle around the front of your body. But if you lean back in a chair with your arm at your side, it can’t see your hand. If you’re sitting at a table and your hands are on your legs, it might not see your hands. If you’re lying down in a dark room and the IR illuminators can’t reach your hands, the cameras might not be able to see them. If you’re simply standing up with your arms at your sides, it might not be able to see your hands if they drift too far backward. Photo by Vjeran Pavic / The Vergenone I recognize that it is fundamentally silly to complain about a hand tracking system needing to see your hands, and it is possible to navigate quite a lot of visionOS with Siri and dictation: you can manage apps, open different virtual immersions, and so on. If you squint, you can see a glimpse of how a computer that you use by talking to it and manipulating things in space might one day work. But right now, the limits are obvious. Using the Vision Pro makes you constantly aware of what you are looking at and where your hands are in a way that is unlike any other computer I’ve ever used. When it fails, it’s maddening. (Oddly, Apple’s newest watches can detect a pinching gesture, but there’s no ability to use those as control devices on the Vision Pro.) The flip side is that a system that’s constantly watching your hands for input tends to register a lot of extra inputs, which can be very funny. I talk through writing video scripts to make sure things flow, and I talk with my hands. So as I was writing the video script for this review in the Vision Pro, the system kept catching my hands moving and started scrolling and clicking on things by accident. I cracked up the first time I realized what was happening. But eventually, it meant that I took the Vision Pro off and wrote the rest of the script on my Mac, which only does things when I actually want it to. Just as with the displays, I think this is the best eye and hand tracking system anyone’s ever shipped. It really can feel like magic… until it doesn’t. And if you want people to do their computing in there, the input system needs to be absolutely rock solid. Personas I won’t go into that much detail on Apple’s deeply weird and extremely uncanny 3D persona system here — the best way to understand them is by watching the video review above, which features a FaceTime call between The Wall Street Journal’s Joanna Stern, Marques Brownlee, and me, all using our personas. To quote Marques, personas are really impressive and also really bad. You can see why Apple put the beta label on them; there’s a long way to go before using a persona on a call isn’t distracting at best and, at worst, extremely rude. I will say, Joanna’s persona accurately captured her reaction to personas in general here. Marques looks like he’s happy to welcome me into PlayStation Home. One small note: personas can show up whenever an app calls for a front-facing camera, so they work in basically everything. I used mine on a Google Meet call in Safari just fine, although the other people on the Meet call did not think it was fine at all. Spatial cameras I would not recommend shooting photos in the Vision Pro unless you really need to. Pressing the shutter button a single time delivers a 2560 x 2560 still, which works out to 6.5 megapixels. As far as I can tell, it’s always from the left main camera, which the EXIF data says has an 18mm f/2.0 lens. The photos look like 6.5-megapixel photos from a tiny camera sensor optimized for video, which is to say that they look pretty bad. Video is slightly better — the Vision Pro shoots 2200 x 2200 square videos at 30fps. They look a little better than the photos, but there’s still an awful lot of compression going on, and if you happen to watch them on anything but a Vision Pro, you’ll notice some barrel distortion as the camera moves around. None of this feels particularly important: I really can’t think of situations where I’d want to be taking video with the headset on since all these videos and screen captures come with a ton of excess motion from your head moving around. Also, you will look fundamentally ridiculous trying to take photos of your family with this thing on your face. I think it’s fair to assume most Vision Pro buyers also own iPhones, which take great videos, so whatever. One thing that is very convincing is taking spatial videos on the iPhone 15 Pro Max and watching them in 3D on the Vision Pro. I took some videos of my daughter at the zoo and around Christmas time, and like any dad, I could probably watch them over and over again forever. They play back in a sort of ghostly white haze, and the overall effect is incredibly bittersweet — you can relive a brief memory, but you’re alone in the headset and can’t share it with anyone else. The other problem is that, currently, you can choose to shoot iPhone video in spatial in 1080p at 30fps or at the full 4K resolution the phone supports but not both. For now, I’m going to stick with the higher-res video, but there’s going to come a time where shooting in spatial by default is the smart move, and that will be a real turning point. visionOS The Vision Pro runs visionOS, which Apple says is based on iPadOS, with a lot of customization around latency and vision to make it work for spatial computing. Starting with the iPad as a foundation represents an incredible head start for Apple — it’s taken years for Meta to build out all the features of the Android-based Quest OS and populate its app store, and it’s still mostly games. Apple gets to start with the full set of mature iPadOS features and most of the huge iPad app library. It’s funny to keep saying that the Vision Pro is an iPad for your face, but when it comes to the current set of apps, it’s also not totally wrong. Most of them work like iPad apps, and the homescreen comes preloaded with a folder labeled “compatible apps” that’s full of actual iPad apps. It’s hard to judge the app ecosystem for a product that has barely launched, but I feel totally comfortable judging the iPad app ecosystem at this point, and Apple shipping its own podcast and news apps as iPad apps on the Vision Pro feels like a sign in a lot of ways. Photo by Vjeran Pavic / The Vergenone There’s already controversy in the world of Vision Pro apps: some huge developers like Netflix, Spotify, and YouTube have decided to wait before allowing their apps to run on the Vision Pro and aren’t even allowing their iPad apps to run. As always, the open web serves as the pressure release valve for Apple developer politics, and Safari on the Vision Pro is a capable riff on iPad Safari: I watched Netflix in Safari and it worked without a hitch, although you can’t put the video in a nice environment like you can with the native apps. I also watched the NFL playoffs on YouTube TV in Safari on the Vision Pro, and it worked with a few minor hiccups, although it did keep asking me to confirm my location over and over again. The stranger thing is that Safari on the Vision Pro is pretty disconnected from web-based 3D experiences. Apple has made noise about supporting the WebXR standard, and there are flags in Safari’s advanced preferences to turn on support, but it’s pretty hit-or-miss in terms of actually working right now — it mostly does not. I asked about this, and Apple told me that it is actively contributing to WebXR and wants to “work with the community to help deliver great spatial computing experiences via the web.” So let’s give that one a minute and see how it goes. On the other hand, I asked Apple why the huge library of VR video on YouTube doesn’t work at all on the Vision Pro, and the company basically told me it wasn’t good enough to support, saying that “much of this content was created for devices that do not deliver a high-quality spatial experience” and that the company’s efforts were instead focused on “delivering the best spatial media experience possible including spatial photos and videos, Apple Immersive Video, and 3D movies available on Apple TV.” Translation: don’t hold your breath for YouTube VR support. Photo by Amelia Holowaty Krales / The Vergenone The really big difference between visionOS and iPadOS is that iPadOS has a lot of opinions about how you can arrange apps and how many apps you can run at a time, and visionOS is full-on free-floating window chaos. I love it. It is bananas. You can open as many apps as you want and put them anywhere you want in space. You can open windows in the kitchen, walk away from them and open some more in the living room, and then go back to the kitchen to find all your old windows waiting for you. Late one night, I made an art gallery of giant Safari windows in our office’s large open cafe area and walked around, looking at huge webpages for a while. I am telling you, it is wild. Sadly, visionOS doesn’t have any ability to share these windows or experiences with anyone else: two people in Vision Pro headsets sitting in the same room can’t see the same things floating in space at the same time. Apple tells me some enterprise developers are working on experiences with shared views, and you can mirror the view from one Vision Pro to another over FaceTime, but in the end, my big Safari art gallery only ever had one patron: me. It’s amazing you can do all of this, but it is also quite lonely to put things all over a space knowing no one else will ever really experience it. To move windows around, you just grab the bar at the bottom and put it wherever you want to in space. You can layer windows, you can put them directly above your head, you can put them on the floor — you can really just do whatever you want. To switch between them, you just look at the window you want and tap your fingers; inactive windows go slightly translucent, which means all kinds of things can be happening at once all over your space. On top of that, you can have apps from three different operating systems on-screen at the same time: native visionOS apps; iPad apps; and then you can also connect your Mac via Wi-Fi and have a whole Mac display with all the chaotic glory of macOS floating around in space. One area where visionOS has clear room to improve is window management. There’s no Exposé or Stage Manager to collect all your open windows in front of you or put them into preset arrangements, and the management that does exist is not exactly discoverable or intuitively laid out. You can tap and hold the X button in one app to hide all your other apps. If you want to hide everything, you double-click the digital crown on the headset itself. If you want to close all apps, you just ask Siri; if you want to quit a misbehaving app, you hold down the top button and the digital crown simultaneously to bring up a force quit window. It’s a lot of different ideas all at once. Once you figure out the moves, you can get around, but it takes a minute, and it means you’ll be thinking about window management more than any other iOS device I can think of and maybe even more than a Mac, which has four decades of window management ideas built into it. Photo by Amelia Holowaty Krales / The Vergenone Speaking of the Mac, I know a lot of people are excited about the idea of buying a Vision Pro just to put up giant virtual monitors. There’s good news and bad news about that. The good news is that Mac display sharing works really well, and Apple ecosystem tricks like Handoff and Continuity are pure magic in this context. You can copy on your Mac and paste in visionOS, and it just works. You can open your Mac display in visionOS and drag the mouse off the screen, and suddenly, your Mac’s keyboard and trackpad are controlling visionOS apps. It works just like it does between a Mac and an iPad. I found myself putting a virtual Mac display over my MacBook Pro’s screen and making it look like I had a 50-inch laptop to use Lightroom with — it’s awesome. There is a lot of very complicated display scaling going on behind the scenes here, but the easiest way to think about it is that you’re basically getting a 27-inch Retina display, like you’d find on an iMac or Studio Display. Your Mac thinks it’s connected to a 5K display with a resolution of 5120 x 2880, and it runs macOS at a 2:1 logical resolution of 2560 x 1440, just like a 5K display. (You can pick other resolutions, but the device warns you that they’ll be lower quality.) That virtual display is then streamed as a 4K 3560 x 2880 video to the Vision Pro, where you can just make it as big as you want. The upshot of all of this is that 4K content runs at a native 4K resolution — it has all the pixels to do it, just like an iMac — but you have a grand total of 2560 x 1440 to place windows in, regardless of how big you make the Mac display in space, and you’re not seeing a pixel-perfect 5K image. It is incredible that all of this works with just a single button click, but all that scaling complication also explains the bad news: you can only have a single Mac display in visionOS. You can’t have multiple Mac monitors floating in space. Maybe next time. Photo by Vjeran Pavic / The Vergenone One of the weirder things about visionOS (and the Vision Pro itself, really) is that there’s not a lot of true AR in the mix — as in, actual interaction between physical objects in your space and digital ones. After all these years of Apple talking about AR, I counted exactly three things in my entire time with the Vision Pro that offered a preview of the AR future. One: when you look at your Mac, the Vision Pro sometimes puts up a “connect display” button above it that starts screen sharing. Two: when you’re typing on a Bluetooth keyboard and look down at your hands, it puts a little text preview window above the keyboard so you can see what you’re typing. These are little features, yes, but they are some of the first true AR computing features that have ever shipped on a mainstream device, and they are an incredibly tantalizing glimpse of what might be possible. They also happen to be incredibly useful. The third AR thing I saw was the loading screen of Super Fruit Ninja, which allows you to throw a strawberry at a pig that’s running around on your floor. This seems slightly less historic. That’s more or less it. There’s not a lot of reality being augmented in the rest of visionOS. There’s an awful lot of what you might call mixed reality: virtual objects floating around in space with no connection to anything real. All those app windows floating around are doing so independently of the physical environment. And in the entertainment context, where Apple lets the Vision Pro fall back into being the VR headset it fundamentally is, it absolutely shines. Watching movies on the Vision Pro is a ton of fun, especially in the Apple TV app’s immersive movie theater that lets you pick where you want to sit. It’s also very cool to watch a movie in one of Apple’s virtual environments like Mount Hood and see the colors from the screen reflect onto the landscape or look around one of the Disney Plus environments like Avengers Tower. And movies themselves look great — the incredible quality of the Vision Pro’s displays is really obvious when you’re watching something. I watched far more of Top Gun: Maverick than I intended to just because it looked so good blown up to drive-in movie size, floating over a mountain. Photo by Amelia Holowaty Krales / The Vergenone Since the Vision Pro sends separate images to each eye, it can do true 3D movies — and Apple and its partners like Disney have already released quite a few. If you have a large Apple movie library, you get the 3D versions for free — you just choose 2D or 3D playback when you hit play. Apple is also making immersive versions of some of its Apple TV Plus shows, which basically means a 180ish-degree 3D video that feels like the best Google Cardboard demo of all time. I watched someone walk a tightrope in Adventure, and it was very convincing — but if you’ve never tried this before, I’d be careful that you get used to VR motion before diving into 3D videos. Apple has also promised immersive sports content, but sadly, I wasn’t able to try any of that yet. You can get pretty far making the argument that the Vision Pro is worth it simply as a very expensive TV — but after a while, the weight of it reminds you that this very nice TV is resting on your face. (I usually made it about 30 minutes to an hour before wanting a break.) It’s also a very expensive TV that doesn’t have HDMI inputs, so you’re limited to Apple’s gaming library, which feels deeply unfair. And unlike any other TV in your life, the Vision Pro can literally DRM your eyes — if you’re watching a movie in the Apple TV app or Disney Plus and go to take a screen capture, the content blacks out. It’s strange to experience a reality where big companies can block you from capturing what you see, even if all you’re trying to do is show people how cool it looks in a review. You can get around DRM screenshots on an iPhone by just taking a photo of the screen, but there’s no such off-ramp for the Vision Pro. Speaking of gaming, there aren’t any real VR games or fitness apps here — there’s nothing like Beat Saber or Red Matter or Population: One, all hit games on the Quest. Fitness, in particular, has helped the Quest reach a more mainstream market: Supernatural’s Chris Milk told me in 2021 that his user base is 50 / 50 men and women, 60 percent of whom are over 40. That led to Meta buying Supernatural outright because it was worried about Apple buying it first. Yet, there’s just nothing like that on the Vision Pro at launch, even though Apple is so focused on fitness and health across its other devices. I think it’s because the Vision Pro just doesn’t seem suited to those kinds of physical game experiences — it’s heavy, with that external battery, and it’s hard to see how some of these games would even work without controllers. Apple tells me that game developers working in Unity are hard at work porting over more games and that visionOS allows developers to come up with custom hand gestures, which might solve for some of the controller issues — I was able to try a prerelease version of Super Fruit Ninja that used a custom slashing gesture in a briefing, and it seemed to work well, but that was about it so far. One note about VR motion in the Vision Pro: it doesn’t really do anything to protect you from yourself. I am fairly comfortable in VR — my wife and I use Supernatural, and I went through a brief, delightful period of being absolutely addicted to Gran Turismo 7 VR on the PSVR 2. I am pretty aware of my limits in VR motion, and I can do most things without a problem. But the Vision Pro is so convincing and so unconcerned with whether you might have any limits that you can easily go too far too fast and get yourself a little queasy. I watched five minutes of Avatar: The Way of Water in 3D in Disney Plus — the Vision Pro is the first consumer device to support high frame rate movies in 3D! — and immediately needed to stop because the motion was just too much. I recommend early adopters go slowly and make sure you find your limits gently. That first bout of VR motion sickness is no joke. Wrap up The Vision Pro is an astounding product. It’s the sort of first-generation device only Apple can really make, from the incredible display and passthrough engineering, to the use of the whole ecosystem to make it so seamlessly useful, to even getting everyone to pretty much ignore the whole external battery situation. There’s a part of me that says the Vision Pro only exists because Apple is so incredibly capable, stocked with talent, and loaded with resources that the company simply went out and engineered the hell out of the hardest problems it could think of in order to find a challenge. That’s good! There are a lot of ideas in the Vision Pro, and they’re all executed with the kind of thoughtful intention that few other companies can ever deliver at all, let alone on the first iteration. But the shocking thing is that Apple may have inadvertently revealed that some of these core ideas are actually dead ends — that they can’t ever be executed well enough to become mainstream. This is the best video passthrough headset ever made, and that might mean camera-based mixed reality passthrough could just be a road to nowhere. This is the best hand- and eye-tracking ever, and it feels like the mouse, keyboard, and touchscreen are going to remain undefeated for years to come. There is so much technology in this thing that feels like magic when it works and frustrates you completely when it doesn’t. Photo by Amelia Holowaty Krales / The Vergenone The other way to look at the Vision Pro is that Apple knows all of this, but the technology to build the true AR glasses it has long hinted at is simply not there — so the Vision Pro represents something like a simulator or a developer kit. A dream factory for people to build apps and meaningful use cases for the imagined hardware yet to come: true optical AR glasses that let you share digital experiences with other people. In that framework, this Vision Pro is the hardware Apple can ship right now to get everyone thinking about these ideas while it pours all those resources into the hardware it wants to build. Maybe! It’s fun to think about that possibility, and a lot of people have already assumed that’s the case. But one of the oldest rules we have here at The Verge is that you have to review what’s in the box — the product that’s shipping today, not the promise of improvements yet to come. And so I keep coming back to all the questions I’ve been asking myself ever since I first strapped the Vision Pro onto my head. Starting, of course, with the most important: Do you want a computer that messes up your hair every time you use it? Do you want a computer that smears your makeup every time you use it, if you wear makeup? Do you want a computer that allows the Walt Disney Company to prevent you from taking pictures of what you see? Do you want to use a computer where you easily can’t show anyone else what you’re looking at? Do you think the fanciest TV you own should have HDMI inputs? Do you want to use a computer that doesn’t work as well in a dark room? Do you want to use a computer that is always looking at your hands? That is a lot of tradeoffs — big tradeoffs, not little ones. And the biggest tradeoff of all is that using the Vision Pro is such a lonely experience, regardless of the weird ghost eyes on the front. You’re in there, having experiences all by yourself that no one else can take part in. After using the Vision Pro for a while, I’ve come to agree with what Tim Cook has been saying for so long: headsets are inherently isolating. That’s fine for traditional VR headsets, which have basically turned into single-use game consoles over the past decade, but it’s a lot weirder for a primary computing device. I don’t want to get work done in the Vision Pro. I get my work done with other people, and I’d rather be out here with them.","output":"애플의 비전 프로는 혁신적인 제품이지만 무겁고, 사용자를 고립시키는 경험을 제공합니다. 비싼 가격에도 불구하고 실제 AR 대신 카메라 기반의 혼합 현실을 제공하며, 진정한 AR 기술은 아직 미완성입니다. 이 제품은 뛰어난 디스플레이, 수동 제어보다 더 복잡한 사용자 경험을 제공하며, 무거운 무게 때문에 장시간 사용에 부담을 줍니다. 게다가, 아이디어의 실행은 종종 마법처럼 느껴지지만 항상 그런 것은 아니며 현재로서는 전통적인 VR 헤드셋에 비해 많은 제한이 있습니다."},{"instruction":"Read the article below and summarize the key takeaways in 250 characters.

Apple Vision Pro review: magic, until it’s not The Apple Vision Pro is the best consumer headset anyone’s ever made — and that’s the problem. Nilay PatelJan 30, 2024 at 11:00 PM GMT+9 There’s a lot of pressure on the new Apple Vision Pro, Apple’s long-awaited entry into the world of computers you wear on your face. Apple claims that the Vision Pro, which starts at 3,499, is the beginning of something called “spatial computing,” which basically boils down to running apps all around you. And the company’s ads for it do not hedge that pressure even a little: they show people wearing the Vision Pro all the time. At work! Doing laundry! Playing with their kids! The ambition is enormous: to layer apps and information over the real world — to augment reality. Apple has to claim that the Vision Pro is the beginning of something new because people have been building headset computers for over a decade now. I tried on a development prototype of the first Oculus Rift in 2013, and The Verge’s Adi Robertson, who edited this review, has tried basically every headset that’s been released since. All of that development means there are some pretty good products out there: that first Oculus evolved into the Quest line at Meta, which is now shipping the Quest 3 — a very good VR headset with a huge library of games and some AR features of its own, which costs 500. 7Verge Score 3499 at Apple How we rate and review products In the meantime, Apple, from Tim Cook on down, has largely insisted that augmented reality will be much more valuable than virtual reality. And it’s been building toward AR for a long time: developers have access to AR tools in iOS, and higher-end iPhones and iPads have had lidar depth scanners for a few years now. The Vision Pro is Apple’s first attempt at building a computer out of all those ideas — a computer that works in the space around you. The goal is for the Vision Pro to be a complete device that can sit right alongside the Mac and the iPad in Apple’s ecosystem of devices and let you get real work done. You can use Excel and Webex and Slack in the Vision Pro, and you can also sit back and watch movies and TV shows on a gigantic virtual 4K HDR display. And you can mirror your Mac’s display and just use the Vision Pro to look at a huge monitor floating in virtual space. It sounds amazing, and sometimes it is. But the Vision Pro also represents a series of really big tradeoffs — tradeoffs that are impossible to ignore. Some of those tradeoffs are very tangible: getting all this tech in a headset means there’s a lot of weight on your face, so Apple chose to use an external battery pack connected by a cable. But there are other, more philosophical tradeoffs as well. As I’ve been using it for the past few days, I kept coming up with a series of questions — questions about whether the tradeoffs were worth it. Is using the Vision Pro so good that I’m willing to mess up my hair every time I put it on? Is it so good that I want to lug it around in its giant carrying case instead of my laptop bag? Is it so good that I want to look at the world around me through screens instead of with my own eyes? Basically, I keep asking if I prefer using a computer in there rather than out here. And as interesting as the Vision Pro is, there’s a long way to go before it can beat out here. Photo by Vjeran Pavic / The Vergenone Hardware Apple doesn’t want anyone to think of the Vision Pro as a VR headset, but it’s a VR headset — albeit a VR headset that almost lets you pretend it’s not a VR headset. You put it on your head in a way that blocks out your vision entirely, and then it shows you a 3D video feed of the world around you passed through from the cameras on the front, as though you can see right through the device. But it can also put you in virtual reality, at various levels of immersion: I spent some time working entirely on the Moon and a lot of time in my kitchen with a bunch of windows floating around a portal into Joshua Tree. The Vision Pro is stunning compared to other VR headsets, which are largely plastic and often downright goofy-looking. The Vision Pro, by contrast, is built of magnesium and carbon fiber in an aluminum enclosure that feels like a natural extension of Apple’s familiar design language. There’s a little iPhone 6 in there, a little AirPods Max, a little Apple Watch. It is the cutting edge of technology in a package that seems instantly familiar. Almost everyone I’ve shown it to thinks it looks smaller in person than they expected, especially compared to some of the huge VR headsets we’ve seen over the past decade. The front display on the Vision Pro is an attempt at keeping you from being isolated from other people while you’re wearing it. In Apple’s photos, it looks like a big, bright screen that shows a video of your eyes to people around you so they feel comfortable talking to you while you’re wearing the headset — a feature adorably called EyeSight. In reality, it might as well not be there. It’s a low-res OLED with a lenticular panel in front of it to provide a mild 3D effect, and it’s so dim and the cover glass is so reflective, it’s actually hard to see in most normal to bright lighting. When people do see your eyes, it’s a low-res, ghostly image of them that feels like CGI. The effect is uncanny — the idea that you’ll be making real eye contact with anyone is a fantasy. And there are no controls or indicators in visionOS for this external display, so you never really know what other people are seeing. Imagine looking someone directly in the eyes and talking to them without knowing if they can see your eyes — it’s weird! EyeSight is so weird. So, so weird. Photo by Amelia Holowaty Krales / The Vergenone That cover glass hides a huge array of cameras and sensors. There’s a pair of high-res front cameras for the video passthrough, cameras that face down and to the sides to track your hands, a lidar scanner and TrueDepth cameras for spatial tracking, and infrared floodlights so everything can work in low light. Underneath all that, you’ve got an M2 processor and Apple’s new R1 spatial coprocessor and a pair of fans to move the heat from all this tech out the top. The fans were never perceptible during my time testing the Vision Pro, but the heat was: after long sessions, the headset was definitely warm. On the top edge, you’ll find what feel like larger versions of some familiar Apple Watch controls: a digital crown that adjusts both the volume and the level of virtual reality immersion on the right as you look through the headset and a button on the left that lets you take 3D photos and videos. You get two headbands in the box: the solo knit band and the dual loop band. They both attach and detach easily; you snap them right on and then pull the little orange tab to disconnect them. The solo band is unquestionably cooler and messes up your hair slightly less — but they both mess up your hair, so if the dual loop fits you better, just go with it. I found the solo loop much more comfortable; I also wish the mounting points were on the outside face so I could pull the band around my head and clip it on instead of constantly pulling it over my hair. The front of the Vision Pro is covered in cameras and sensors. Photo by Vjeran Pavic / The Vergenone The solo loop is by far the cooler strap. Photo by Amelia Holowaty Krales / The Vergenone The huge case costs an additional 199 and looks like a marshmallow from space. I love it. Photo by Amelia Holowaty Krales / The Vergenone The other two pieces are the light seal, which comes in various sizes, and the headband, which comes in two thicknesses. (You get fitted for these in the store or by scanning your head with an iPhone if you buy online.) Both attach magnetically, which means they also detach magnetically — you want to pick this thing up by the frame because grabbing it by the light seal can lead to disaster. If you have glasses, you can click in custom Zeiss lens inserts — Apple sent us reader lenses to see what that process looks like, but I just used the Vision Pro while wearing my soft contacts, and it was fine. The Vision Pro’s speakers are housed in the arms on the side, and they are good and loud and do a convincing job of rendering spatial audio. Things really sound like they are happening where they appear to be happening, which is a neat trick. The speakers are also pretty leaky, so everyone else around you can hear what you’re up to unless you use headphones. You can use any Bluetooth headphones you want, but you get a bunch of extra features if you use the latest AirPods Pro, like lower latency, lossless 48KHz audio, and Apple’s Adaptive Audio system, which automatically mixes in sound from the real world as appropriate. Since you’ll mostly experience the Vision Pro in there, the most noticeable thing about the hardware after a while is that it’s just… heavy. You’re supposed to wear this thing on your face for long stretches of computer time, and depending on which band and light seal you use, the headset alone weighs between 600 and 650 grams. I keep joking that the Vision Pro is an iPad for your face, but it’s heavier than an 11-inch iPad Pro (470 grams) and pushing close to a 12.9-inch iPad Pro (682 grams), so in a very real way, it’s an iPad for your face. All of the Vision Pro’s heft is totally front-loaded, too. Other big headsets like the Quest Pro (722 grams) have elaborate headbands to balance out their weight, but the Vision Pro just rests it all on the front. Swapping to the dual loop strap helps keep things more stable but doesn’t really reduce the overall sensation of having all that headset on your face. You’re just going to feel it after a while. The Vision Pro’s external battery pack is fine, mostly because it’s such a stationary device overall. Photo by Vjeran Pavic / The Vergenone Notably, the Vision Pro is substantially heavier than the familiar Quest 2 (503g) or even the heavier Quest 3 (515g) — headsets that have built-in batteries. Apple told me that it chose to use an external battery specifically to reduce the headset’s weight. The battery itself is barely worth talking about — it’s a silver brick that weighs another 353 grams with a USB-C port and a motion-activated LED that’s green when it’s charged and orange when it’s not. It connects to the headset with a satisfying twist connector, but the nice braided cable is permanently attached to the battery itself, so don’t break it. You can buy extra batteries for 199, but you can’t hot-swap them; disconnecting the battery from the Vision Pro cuts the power entirely. I don’t really have strong opinions on this battery setup, which is mostly because nothing about the Vision Pro feels like you’re supposed to move around that much in it, so it’s more or less fine. It’s funny that Apple of all companies shipped this compromise, but it’s also very Apple that the battery is not actually bigger so it can provide more than two and a half hours of run time. (If you plug the battery in, the Vision Pro just runs on wall power for as long as you want.) Setting up the Vision Pro is dead simple — the headband adjustments are the only manual adjustments involved. Everything else is motorized and sensor-driven. There’s no fiddly lens wheel to dial in; the headset asks you to hold down the digital crown when you first put it on to adjust the lenses to your eyes, and then you go through a pretty standard eye tracking setup. The rest of the setup is almost exactly like any other iOS device: if you have an iPhone, you can bring it close to the Vision Pro to send over all your settings, and you have to agree to some terms and conditions. If you don’t have an iPhone, you’ll have to enter your passwords and so on manually, but it’ll work fine as a standalone device. After all of that, you’re computing in the future. See? It’s a VR headset. Photo by Vjeran Pavic / The Vergenone Apple is very proud of the displays inside the Vision Pro, and for good reason — they represent a huge leap forward in display technology. The two displays are tiny MicroOLEDs with a total of 23 million pixels that are just 7.5 micrometers in size, which is about the size of a red blood cell. And each of those tiny pixels is composed of three RGB subpixels laid out in what Apple tells me is an S-stripe pattern. Just thinking about the level of precision required to make these displays and then make them work in a device like this is mind-blowing. They also look generally incredible — sharp enough to read text on without even thinking about it, bright enough to do justice to movies. Apple calibrates them for color at the factory so they are also vibrant and color-accurate without looking oversaturated or blown out. They are so small, but they work so well that they seem huge. The displays are the main reason the Vision Pro is so expensive — they’re at the heart of the Vision Pro experience and what makes the whole thing work. You are always looking at them, after all. But for all their technical marvels, they are not without tradeoffs of their own when deployed on a device like this. The speakers are nice and loud and convincing with spatial audio. Photo by Vjeran Pavic / The Vergenone See this thing — a passthrough VR headset with a silly external battery pack and a display that shows ghostly images of your eyes on the front — is not the big goal. The big goal is AR, or augmented reality. In particular, the big goal is optical AR, where light passes directly through unobtrusive glasses to your eyes, with digital information layered over the top of what you’re seeing. AR is a technology with the potential to literally change humanity, and Apple CEO Tim Cook has been talking about how isolating VR headsets are and how important he thinks AR will be for years now. Tim Cook, 2016: “Few people are going to view that it’s acceptable to be enclosed in something.” Tim Cook, 2017: “Unlike Virtual Reality which closes the world out, AR allows individuals to be present in the world.” Tim Cook, 2017: “I also like the fact that [AR] doesn’t isolate [...] I’ve never been a fan of VR like that because I think it does the opposite.” Tim Cook, 2020: “I think [AR is] something that doesn’t isolate people. We can use it to enhance our discussion, not substitute it for human connection, which I’ve always deeply worried about in some of the other technologies.” The problem is that the technology to build a true optical AR display that works well enough to replace an everyday computer just isn’t there yet. The Magic Leap 2 is an optical AR headset that’s cheaper and smaller than the Vision Pro, but it’s plagued by compromises in field of view and image quality that most people would never accept. So Apple’s settled for building a headset with real-time video passthrough — it is the defining tradeoff of the Vision Pro. It is a VR headset masquerading as an AR headset. And let me tell you: the video passthrough on the Vision Pro is really good. It works! It’s convincing. You put the headset on, the display comes on, and you’re right back where you were, only with a bunch of visionOS windows floating around. It sounds simple, but it is an astonishing engineering achievement to do that in real time, at high resolution, in a computer that fits over your eyes. Apple claims there’s only 12ms of latency between what the cameras see and what’s on the display, and that latency includes the exposure time of the cameras themselves. The actual data processing is faster. Do the math, and Apple says there’s not even a frame’s worth of latency; the next frame of video is ready before you’re done looking at the last one. Still cameras, still displays. Photo by Vjeran Pavic / The Vergenone You can also see Apple’s incredible video processing chops right in front of your eyes: I sat around scrolling on my phone while wearing the Vision Pro, with no blown-out screens or weird frame rate issues. I also worked on my Mac in front of a large window while wearing the headset, which is a torture test for dynamic range, and while it wasn’t perfect, it was still usable. It is the best video passthrough that’s ever shipped in a consumer device by far. The problem is that cameras are still cameras, and displays are still displays. All cameras have motion blur, for example. In low light, cameras either have to increase exposure times at the cost of sharpness or increase ISO at the cost of noise, which then requires noise reduction, which makes things blurry and dull. And cameras and displays both have real limits in terms of color reproduction. The Vision Pro cannot overcome the inherent nature of cameras and displays. You can easily see motion blur when you move your head in the Vision Pro — motion blur that increases in low light and leads to some weird warping of straight lines. Low light also causes the overall sharpness of the video passthrough to drop as noise reduction kicks in: my iPhone screen got noticeably blurrier when the sun set. If you’re in a medium-lit room halfway immersed in a dark virtual environment with a bright window open — say, sitting in your kitchen at night with the lights on while writing a review in a Google Docs window floating on a dark beach — you will notice the display brightness slowly ramp up and down as the system tries to average out the brightness of everything you’re looking at. The LCD clock on my microwave flickers when I look at it through these cameras. And Apple’s specs say the display supports 92 percent of the DCI-P3 color gamut, which means the Vision Pro can only show you 49 percent of the colors your eyes can actually see. The displays have other limitations: the field of view isn’t huge, and the essential nature of looking at tiny displays through lenses makes that field of view feel even smaller. Apple won’t tell me the exact number, but the Vision Pro’s field of view is certainly smaller than the Quest 3’s 110 horizontal degrees. That means there are fairly large black borders around what you’re seeing, a bit like you’re looking through binoculars. On top of that, there’s a little bit of distortion and vignetting around the edges of the lenses, and you’ll see some green and pink color fringing at the edges as well, especially in bright environments. All of this makes the usable field of view feel even smaller. If you’re looking at something bright or otherwise high contrast — a white text window floating above a dark desert landscape, for example — you’ll see highlights reflecting in the lenses. A screen capture from the Vision Pro and a simulated view of what it feels like to look in the headset. I asked Apple about all of this, and yep — that’s how it’s supposed to look. Apple spokesperson Jacqueline Roy told me that a combination of hardware and software in the Vision Pro is specifically designed to minimize these various effects, but they’re definitely in there, and you’ll see them. If you have been paying attention to VR for the past decade, you know that these are very familiar VR headset display issues. You’re passing light from a screen through lenses mounted on someone’s face and trying to line those lenses up with their eyes, which are notably in different spots on different people’s faces. (Our bodies are designed very badly when it comes to mounting hardware on them.) So a little weirdness at the edges of the displays is not a deal-breaker or even a surprise — except Apple is charging 3,499 for the Vision Pro and making it sound like these displays are perfect enough for you to casually wear this thing while folding laundry. I’m serious when I say the Vision Pro has the best video passthrough I’ve ever seen on the sharpest VR displays any normal person will ever come across. But you’re still constantly being reminded that you’re looking at video on screens, and reality is just a lot more interesting than that. There are vanishingly few contexts in reviewing consumer devices where anyone has to care about color gamuts — but if you want me to perceive reality through something, I’d like to see all the colors of the rainbow. This is the best anyone has ever made in there look, and it’s still not nearly as good as out here. Waiting. Watching. Ready to mess up your hair at a moment’s notice. Photo by Vjeran Pavic / The Vergenone Controls The other thing Apple is very proud of is the eye and hand tracking control system, which is light years beyond any other consumer hand or eye tracking systems out there. You look at things you want to control, you tap your fingers to control them, and that’s how you get around the entire interface. You’re not reaching out and touching things — it’s more like your eyes are the mouse, and your fingers are the button: you tap them together to click on what you’re looking at. The first few times you use hand and eye tracking on the Vision Pro, it’s awe-inspiring — it feels like a superpower. The Vision Pro’s external cameras just need to see your hands for it to work, and they can see your hands in a pretty large zone around your body. You can have them slung across the back of the couch, resting in your lap, up in the air with your elbows on a table, pretty much anywhere the cameras can see them. It actually takes a minute to realize you don’t have to gesture out in front of you with your hands in the air — and once you figure it out, it’s pretty fun to watch other people instinctively reach their hands up the first time they try the Vision Pro. But the next few times you use hand and eye tracking, it stops feeling like a superpower — and in some cases, it actively makes using the Vision Pro harder. It turns out that having to look at what you want to control is really quite distracting. Think about every other computer in your life: the input mechanism is independent of whatever you’re looking at. On a laptop, you can click on controls and use the keyboard while keeping your focus on a document. On a phone, you can do things like drag sliders in a photo editing app while keeping your eyes focused on what those changes are actually doing to your photo. The Vision Pro simply doesn’t work like that — you have to be looking at something in order to click on it, and that means you are constantly taking your attention away from whatever you’re working on to specifically look at the button you need to press next. I spent some time playing a lovely little game called Stitch that quickly became maddening because I kept looking away from the piece I wanted to move to the place I wanted to move it, which meant I wasn’t picking it up when I tapped my fingers. Reach out and touch faith. Photo by Vjeran Pavic / The Vergenone visionOS feels also designed for an eye tracking system that’s just slightly more precise than it actually is — a lot of controls are just a little too small and a little too close together to let you quickly bop around the system. You have to look, make sure you’re looking at the thing you want, and then tap, or you might end up clicking on the wrong thing. Sometimes the fastest way to select what you want is to look away entirely and try again. It works until it doesn’t. It’s magic until it’s not. Think about it like this: The keyboard and mouse on a Mac directly control the Mac. The click wheel on an iPod directly controlled the iPod. A lot of work has gone into making it feel like the multitouch screen on an iPhone directly controls the phone, and when it goes sideways, like when autocorrect fails or an app doesn’t register your taps, it’s not pleasant. Your eyes and hands aren’t directly controlling the Vision Pro: cameras are watching your eyes and hands and turning that into input, and sometimes the interpretation isn’t perfect. The best example of this is the hilarious on-screen keyboard, which you use by staring at each letter and pinching your fingers to select it or henpecking with two fingers at the floating keys in front of you. It’s not worth using for anything beyond entering a Wi-Fi password — for anything longer, you’ll want to use dictation or connect a Bluetooth keyboard. Why? So you can directly control the input. It’s not a given that the Vision Pro can always see your hands, either. There’s a pretty large bubble around the front of your body where the cameras can see your hands — it basically extends the length of your arms in a semicircle around the front of your body. But if you lean back in a chair with your arm at your side, it can’t see your hand. If you’re sitting at a table and your hands are on your legs, it might not see your hands. If you’re lying down in a dark room and the IR illuminators can’t reach your hands, the cameras might not be able to see them. If you’re simply standing up with your arms at your sides, it might not be able to see your hands if they drift too far backward. Photo by Vjeran Pavic / The Vergenone I recognize that it is fundamentally silly to complain about a hand tracking system needing to see your hands, and it is possible to navigate quite a lot of visionOS with Siri and dictation: you can manage apps, open different virtual immersions, and so on. If you squint, you can see a glimpse of how a computer that you use by talking to it and manipulating things in space might one day work. But right now, the limits are obvious. Using the Vision Pro makes you constantly aware of what you are looking at and where your hands are in a way that is unlike any other computer I’ve ever used. When it fails, it’s maddening. (Oddly, Apple’s newest watches can detect a pinching gesture, but there’s no ability to use those as control devices on the Vision Pro.) The flip side is that a system that’s constantly watching your hands for input tends to register a lot of extra inputs, which can be very funny. I talk through writing video scripts to make sure things flow, and I talk with my hands. So as I was writing the video script for this review in the Vision Pro, the system kept catching my hands moving and started scrolling and clicking on things by accident. I cracked up the first time I realized what was happening. But eventually, it meant that I took the Vision Pro off and wrote the rest of the script on my Mac, which only does things when I actually want it to. Just as with the displays, I think this is the best eye and hand tracking system anyone’s ever shipped. It really can feel like magic… until it doesn’t. And if you want people to do their computing in there, the input system needs to be absolutely rock solid. Personas I won’t go into that much detail on Apple’s deeply weird and extremely uncanny 3D persona system here — the best way to understand them is by watching the video review above, which features a FaceTime call between The Wall Street Journal’s Joanna Stern, Marques Brownlee, and me, all using our personas. To quote Marques, personas are really impressive and also really bad. You can see why Apple put the beta label on them; there’s a long way to go before using a persona on a call isn’t distracting at best and, at worst, extremely rude. I will say, Joanna’s persona accurately captured her reaction to personas in general here. Marques looks like he’s happy to welcome me into PlayStation Home. One small note: personas can show up whenever an app calls for a front-facing camera, so they work in basically everything. I used mine on a Google Meet call in Safari just fine, although the other people on the Meet call did not think it was fine at all. Spatial cameras I would not recommend shooting photos in the Vision Pro unless you really need to. Pressing the shutter button a single time delivers a 2560 x 2560 still, which works out to 6.5 megapixels. As far as I can tell, it’s always from the left main camera, which the EXIF data says has an 18mm f/2.0 lens. The photos look like 6.5-megapixel photos from a tiny camera sensor optimized for video, which is to say that they look pretty bad. Video is slightly better — the Vision Pro shoots 2200 x 2200 square videos at 30fps. They look a little better than the photos, but there’s still an awful lot of compression going on, and if you happen to watch them on anything but a Vision Pro, you’ll notice some barrel distortion as the camera moves around. None of this feels particularly important: I really can’t think of situations where I’d want to be taking video with the headset on since all these videos and screen captures come with a ton of excess motion from your head moving around. Also, you will look fundamentally ridiculous trying to take photos of your family with this thing on your face. I think it’s fair to assume most Vision Pro buyers also own iPhones, which take great videos, so whatever. One thing that is very convincing is taking spatial videos on the iPhone 15 Pro Max and watching them in 3D on the Vision Pro. I took some videos of my daughter at the zoo and around Christmas time, and like any dad, I could probably watch them over and over again forever. They play back in a sort of ghostly white haze, and the overall effect is incredibly bittersweet — you can relive a brief memory, but you’re alone in the headset and can’t share it with anyone else. The other problem is that, currently, you can choose to shoot iPhone video in spatial in 1080p at 30fps or at the full 4K resolution the phone supports but not both. For now, I’m going to stick with the higher-res video, but there’s going to come a time where shooting in spatial by default is the smart move, and that will be a real turning point. visionOS The Vision Pro runs visionOS, which Apple says is based on iPadOS, with a lot of customization around latency and vision to make it work for spatial computing. Starting with the iPad as a foundation represents an incredible head start for Apple — it’s taken years for Meta to build out all the features of the Android-based Quest OS and populate its app store, and it’s still mostly games. Apple gets to start with the full set of mature iPadOS features and most of the huge iPad app library. It’s funny to keep saying that the Vision Pro is an iPad for your face, but when it comes to the current set of apps, it’s also not totally wrong. Most of them work like iPad apps, and the homescreen comes preloaded with a folder labeled “compatible apps” that’s full of actual iPad apps. It’s hard to judge the app ecosystem for a product that has barely launched, but I feel totally comfortable judging the iPad app ecosystem at this point, and Apple shipping its own podcast and news apps as iPad apps on the Vision Pro feels like a sign in a lot of ways. Photo by Vjeran Pavic / The Vergenone There’s already controversy in the world of Vision Pro apps: some huge developers like Netflix, Spotify, and YouTube have decided to wait before allowing their apps to run on the Vision Pro and aren’t even allowing their iPad apps to run. As always, the open web serves as the pressure release valve for Apple developer politics, and Safari on the Vision Pro is a capable riff on iPad Safari: I watched Netflix in Safari and it worked without a hitch, although you can’t put the video in a nice environment like you can with the native apps. I also watched the NFL playoffs on YouTube TV in Safari on the Vision Pro, and it worked with a few minor hiccups, although it did keep asking me to confirm my location over and over again. The stranger thing is that Safari on the Vision Pro is pretty disconnected from web-based 3D experiences. Apple has made noise about supporting the WebXR standard, and there are flags in Safari’s advanced preferences to turn on support, but it’s pretty hit-or-miss in terms of actually working right now — it mostly does not. I asked about this, and Apple told me that it is actively contributing to WebXR and wants to “work with the community to help deliver great spatial computing experiences via the web.” So let’s give that one a minute and see how it goes. On the other hand, I asked Apple why the huge library of VR video on YouTube doesn’t work at all on the Vision Pro, and the company basically told me it wasn’t good enough to support, saying that “much of this content was created for devices that do not deliver a high-quality spatial experience” and that the company’s efforts were instead focused on “delivering the best spatial media experience possible including spatial photos and videos, Apple Immersive Video, and 3D movies available on Apple TV.” Translation: don’t hold your breath for YouTube VR support. Photo by Amelia Holowaty Krales / The Vergenone The really big difference between visionOS and iPadOS is that iPadOS has a lot of opinions about how you can arrange apps and how many apps you can run at a time, and visionOS is full-on free-floating window chaos. I love it. It is bananas. You can open as many apps as you want and put them anywhere you want in space. You can open windows in the kitchen, walk away from them and open some more in the living room, and then go back to the kitchen to find all your old windows waiting for you. Late one night, I made an art gallery of giant Safari windows in our office’s large open cafe area and walked around, looking at huge webpages for a while. I am telling you, it is wild. Sadly, visionOS doesn’t have any ability to share these windows or experiences with anyone else: two people in Vision Pro headsets sitting in the same room can’t see the same things floating in space at the same time. Apple tells me some enterprise developers are working on experiences with shared views, and you can mirror the view from one Vision Pro to another over FaceTime, but in the end, my big Safari art gallery only ever had one patron: me. It’s amazing you can do all of this, but it is also quite lonely to put things all over a space knowing no one else will ever really experience it. To move windows around, you just grab the bar at the bottom and put it wherever you want to in space. You can layer windows, you can put them directly above your head, you can put them on the floor — you can really just do whatever you want. To switch between them, you just look at the window you want and tap your fingers; inactive windows go slightly translucent, which means all kinds of things can be happening at once all over your space. On top of that, you can have apps from three different operating systems on-screen at the same time: native visionOS apps; iPad apps; and then you can also connect your Mac via Wi-Fi and have a whole Mac display with all the chaotic glory of macOS floating around in space. One area where visionOS has clear room to improve is window management. There’s no Exposé or Stage Manager to collect all your open windows in front of you or put them into preset arrangements, and the management that does exist is not exactly discoverable or intuitively laid out. You can tap and hold the X button in one app to hide all your other apps. If you want to hide everything, you double-click the digital crown on the headset itself. If you want to close all apps, you just ask Siri; if you want to quit a misbehaving app, you hold down the top button and the digital crown simultaneously to bring up a force quit window. It’s a lot of different ideas all at once. Once you figure out the moves, you can get around, but it takes a minute, and it means you’ll be thinking about window management more than any other iOS device I can think of and maybe even more than a Mac, which has four decades of window management ideas built into it. Photo by Amelia Holowaty Krales / The Vergenone Speaking of the Mac, I know a lot of people are excited about the idea of buying a Vision Pro just to put up giant virtual monitors. There’s good news and bad news about that. The good news is that Mac display sharing works really well, and Apple ecosystem tricks like Handoff and Continuity are pure magic in this context. You can copy on your Mac and paste in visionOS, and it just works. You can open your Mac display in visionOS and drag the mouse off the screen, and suddenly, your Mac’s keyboard and trackpad are controlling visionOS apps. It works just like it does between a Mac and an iPad. I found myself putting a virtual Mac display over my MacBook Pro’s screen and making it look like I had a 50-inch laptop to use Lightroom with — it’s awesome. There is a lot of very complicated display scaling going on behind the scenes here, but the easiest way to think about it is that you’re basically getting a 27-inch Retina display, like you’d find on an iMac or Studio Display. Your Mac thinks it’s connected to a 5K display with a resolution of 5120 x 2880, and it runs macOS at a 2:1 logical resolution of 2560 x 1440, just like a 5K display. (You can pick other resolutions, but the device warns you that they’ll be lower quality.) That virtual display is then streamed as a 4K 3560 x 2880 video to the Vision Pro, where you can just make it as big as you want. The upshot of all of this is that 4K content runs at a native 4K resolution — it has all the pixels to do it, just like an iMac — but you have a grand total of 2560 x 1440 to place windows in, regardless of how big you make the Mac display in space, and you’re not seeing a pixel-perfect 5K image. It is incredible that all of this works with just a single button click, but all that scaling complication also explains the bad news: you can only have a single Mac display in visionOS. You can’t have multiple Mac monitors floating in space. Maybe next time. Photo by Vjeran Pavic / The Vergenone One of the weirder things about visionOS (and the Vision Pro itself, really) is that there’s not a lot of true AR in the mix — as in, actual interaction between physical objects in your space and digital ones. After all these years of Apple talking about AR, I counted exactly three things in my entire time with the Vision Pro that offered a preview of the AR future. One: when you look at your Mac, the Vision Pro sometimes puts up a “connect display” button above it that starts screen sharing. Two: when you’re typing on a Bluetooth keyboard and look down at your hands, it puts a little text preview window above the keyboard so you can see what you’re typing. These are little features, yes, but they are some of the first true AR computing features that have ever shipped on a mainstream device, and they are an incredibly tantalizing glimpse of what might be possible. They also happen to be incredibly useful. The third AR thing I saw was the loading screen of Super Fruit Ninja, which allows you to throw a strawberry at a pig that’s running around on your floor. This seems slightly less historic. That’s more or less it. There’s not a lot of reality being augmented in the rest of visionOS. There’s an awful lot of what you might call mixed reality: virtual objects floating around in space with no connection to anything real. All those app windows floating around are doing so independently of the physical environment. And in the entertainment context, where Apple lets the Vision Pro fall back into being the VR headset it fundamentally is, it absolutely shines. Watching movies on the Vision Pro is a ton of fun, especially in the Apple TV app’s immersive movie theater that lets you pick where you want to sit. It’s also very cool to watch a movie in one of Apple’s virtual environments like Mount Hood and see the colors from the screen reflect onto the landscape or look around one of the Disney Plus environments like Avengers Tower. And movies themselves look great — the incredible quality of the Vision Pro’s displays is really obvious when you’re watching something. I watched far more of Top Gun: Maverick than I intended to just because it looked so good blown up to drive-in movie size, floating over a mountain. Photo by Amelia Holowaty Krales / The Vergenone Since the Vision Pro sends separate images to each eye, it can do true 3D movies — and Apple and its partners like Disney have already released quite a few. If you have a large Apple movie library, you get the 3D versions for free — you just choose 2D or 3D playback when you hit play. Apple is also making immersive versions of some of its Apple TV Plus shows, which basically means a 180ish-degree 3D video that feels like the best Google Cardboard demo of all time. I watched someone walk a tightrope in Adventure, and it was very convincing — but if you’ve never tried this before, I’d be careful that you get used to VR motion before diving into 3D videos. Apple has also promised immersive sports content, but sadly, I wasn’t able to try any of that yet. You can get pretty far making the argument that the Vision Pro is worth it simply as a very expensive TV — but after a while, the weight of it reminds you that this very nice TV is resting on your face. (I usually made it about 30 minutes to an hour before wanting a break.) It’s also a very expensive TV that doesn’t have HDMI inputs, so you’re limited to Apple’s gaming library, which feels deeply unfair. And unlike any other TV in your life, the Vision Pro can literally DRM your eyes — if you’re watching a movie in the Apple TV app or Disney Plus and go to take a screen capture, the content blacks out. It’s strange to experience a reality where big companies can block you from capturing what you see, even if all you’re trying to do is show people how cool it looks in a review. You can get around DRM screenshots on an iPhone by just taking a photo of the screen, but there’s no such off-ramp for the Vision Pro. Speaking of gaming, there aren’t any real VR games or fitness apps here — there’s nothing like Beat Saber or Red Matter or Population: One, all hit games on the Quest. Fitness, in particular, has helped the Quest reach a more mainstream market: Supernatural’s Chris Milk told me in 2021 that his user base is 50 / 50 men and women, 60 percent of whom are over 40. That led to Meta buying Supernatural outright because it was worried about Apple buying it first. Yet, there’s just nothing like that on the Vision Pro at launch, even though Apple is so focused on fitness and health across its other devices. I think it’s because the Vision Pro just doesn’t seem suited to those kinds of physical game experiences — it’s heavy, with that external battery, and it’s hard to see how some of these games would even work without controllers. Apple tells me that game developers working in Unity are hard at work porting over more games and that visionOS allows developers to come up with custom hand gestures, which might solve for some of the controller issues — I was able to try a prerelease version of Super Fruit Ninja that used a custom slashing gesture in a briefing, and it seemed to work well, but that was about it so far. One note about VR motion in the Vision Pro: it doesn’t really do anything to protect you from yourself. I am fairly comfortable in VR — my wife and I use Supernatural, and I went through a brief, delightful period of being absolutely addicted to Gran Turismo 7 VR on the PSVR 2. I am pretty aware of my limits in VR motion, and I can do most things without a problem. But the Vision Pro is so convincing and so unconcerned with whether you might have any limits that you can easily go too far too fast and get yourself a little queasy. I watched five minutes of Avatar: The Way of Water in 3D in Disney Plus — the Vision Pro is the first consumer device to support high frame rate movies in 3D! — and immediately needed to stop because the motion was just too much. I recommend early adopters go slowly and make sure you find your limits gently. That first bout of VR motion sickness is no joke. Wrap up The Vision Pro is an astounding product. It’s the sort of first-generation device only Apple can really make, from the incredible display and passthrough engineering, to the use of the whole ecosystem to make it so seamlessly useful, to even getting everyone to pretty much ignore the whole external battery situation. There’s a part of me that says the Vision Pro only exists because Apple is so incredibly capable, stocked with talent, and loaded with resources that the company simply went out and engineered the hell out of the hardest problems it could think of in order to find a challenge. That’s good! There are a lot of ideas in the Vision Pro, and they’re all executed with the kind of thoughtful intention that few other companies can ever deliver at all, let alone on the first iteration. But the shocking thing is that Apple may have inadvertently revealed that some of these core ideas are actually dead ends — that they can’t ever be executed well enough to become mainstream. This is the best video passthrough headset ever made, and that might mean camera-based mixed reality passthrough could just be a road to nowhere. This is the best hand- and eye-tracking ever, and it feels like the mouse, keyboard, and touchscreen are going to remain undefeated for years to come. There is so much technology in this thing that feels like magic when it works and frustrates you completely when it doesn’t. Photo by Amelia Holowaty Krales / The Vergenone The other way to look at the Vision Pro is that Apple knows all of this, but the technology to build the true AR glasses it has long hinted at is simply not there — so the Vision Pro represents something like a simulator or a developer kit. A dream factory for people to build apps and meaningful use cases for the imagined hardware yet to come: true optical AR glasses that let you share digital experiences with other people. In that framework, this Vision Pro is the hardware Apple can ship right now to get everyone thinking about these ideas while it pours all those resources into the hardware it wants to build. Maybe! It’s fun to think about that possibility, and a lot of people have already assumed that’s the case. But one of the oldest rules we have here at The Verge is that you have to review what’s in the box — the product that’s shipping today, not the promise of improvements yet to come. And so I keep coming back to all the questions I’ve been asking myself ever since I first strapped the Vision Pro onto my head. Starting, of course, with the most important: Do you want a computer that messes up your hair every time you use it? Do you want a computer that smears your makeup every time you use it, if you wear makeup? Do you want a computer that allows the Walt Disney Company to prevent you from taking pictures of what you see? Do you want to use a computer where you easily can’t show anyone else what you’re looking at? Do you think the fanciest TV you own should have HDMI inputs? Do you want to use a computer that doesn’t work as well in a dark room? Do you want to use a computer that is always looking at your hands? That is a lot of tradeoffs — big tradeoffs, not little ones. And the biggest tradeoff of all is that using the Vision Pro is such a lonely experience, regardless of the weird ghost eyes on the front. You’re in there, having experiences all by yourself that no one else can take part in. After using the Vision Pro for a while, I’ve come to agree with what Tim Cook has been saying for so long: headsets are inherently isolating. That’s fine for traditional VR headsets, which have basically turned into single-use game consoles over the past decade, but it’s a lot weirder for a primary computing device. I don’t want to get work done in the Vision Pro. I get my work done with other people, and I’d rather be out here with them.","output":"비전 프로는 뛰어난 기술을 탑재했지만, 무게가 무겁고, 단점이 많은 제품입니다. 진정한 AR 대신 비디오 패스스루를 제공하며 정교한 트래킹 시스템을 갖추고 있습니다. 하지만, 현실에 비해 제한적이며 사용 중 고립감을 줄 수 있습니다."},{"instruction":"Read the article below and summarize the key takeaways in 200 characters.

Apple Vision Pro review: magic, until it’s not The Apple Vision Pro is the best consumer headset anyone’s ever made — and that’s the problem. Nilay PatelJan 30, 2024 at 11:00 PM GMT+9 There’s a lot of pressure on the new Apple Vision Pro, Apple’s long-awaited entry into the world of computers you wear on your face. Apple claims that the Vision Pro, which starts at 3,499, is the beginning of something called “spatial computing,” which basically boils down to running apps all around you. And the company’s ads for it do not hedge that pressure even a little: they show people wearing the Vision Pro all the time. At work! Doing laundry! Playing with their kids! The ambition is enormous: to layer apps and information over the real world — to augment reality. Apple has to claim that the Vision Pro is the beginning of something new because people have been building headset computers for over a decade now. I tried on a development prototype of the first Oculus Rift in 2013, and The Verge’s Adi Robertson, who edited this review, has tried basically every headset that’s been released since. All of that development means there are some pretty good products out there: that first Oculus evolved into the Quest line at Meta, which is now shipping the Quest 3 — a very good VR headset with a huge library of games and some AR features of its own, which costs 500. 7Verge Score 3499 at Apple How we rate and review products In the meantime, Apple, from Tim Cook on down, has largely insisted that augmented reality will be much more valuable than virtual reality. And it’s been building toward AR for a long time: developers have access to AR tools in iOS, and higher-end iPhones and iPads have had lidar depth scanners for a few years now. The Vision Pro is Apple’s first attempt at building a computer out of all those ideas — a computer that works in the space around you. The goal is for the Vision Pro to be a complete device that can sit right alongside the Mac and the iPad in Apple’s ecosystem of devices and let you get real work done. You can use Excel and Webex and Slack in the Vision Pro, and you can also sit back and watch movies and TV shows on a gigantic virtual 4K HDR display. And you can mirror your Mac’s display and just use the Vision Pro to look at a huge monitor floating in virtual space. It sounds amazing, and sometimes it is. But the Vision Pro also represents a series of really big tradeoffs — tradeoffs that are impossible to ignore. Some of those tradeoffs are very tangible: getting all this tech in a headset means there’s a lot of weight on your face, so Apple chose to use an external battery pack connected by a cable. But there are other, more philosophical tradeoffs as well. As I’ve been using it for the past few days, I kept coming up with a series of questions — questions about whether the tradeoffs were worth it. Is using the Vision Pro so good that I’m willing to mess up my hair every time I put it on? Is it so good that I want to lug it around in its giant carrying case instead of my laptop bag? Is it so good that I want to look at the world around me through screens instead of with my own eyes? Basically, I keep asking if I prefer using a computer in there rather than out here. And as interesting as the Vision Pro is, there’s a long way to go before it can beat out here. Photo by Vjeran Pavic / The Vergenone Hardware Apple doesn’t want anyone to think of the Vision Pro as a VR headset, but it’s a VR headset — albeit a VR headset that almost lets you pretend it’s not a VR headset. You put it on your head in a way that blocks out your vision entirely, and then it shows you a 3D video feed of the world around you passed through from the cameras on the front, as though you can see right through the device. But it can also put you in virtual reality, at various levels of immersion: I spent some time working entirely on the Moon and a lot of time in my kitchen with a bunch of windows floating around a portal into Joshua Tree. The Vision Pro is stunning compared to other VR headsets, which are largely plastic and often downright goofy-looking. The Vision Pro, by contrast, is built of magnesium and carbon fiber in an aluminum enclosure that feels like a natural extension of Apple’s familiar design language. There’s a little iPhone 6 in there, a little AirPods Max, a little Apple Watch. It is the cutting edge of technology in a package that seems instantly familiar. Almost everyone I’ve shown it to thinks it looks smaller in person than they expected, especially compared to some of the huge VR headsets we’ve seen over the past decade. The front display on the Vision Pro is an attempt at keeping you from being isolated from other people while you’re wearing it. In Apple’s photos, it looks like a big, bright screen that shows a video of your eyes to people around you so they feel comfortable talking to you while you’re wearing the headset — a feature adorably called EyeSight. In reality, it might as well not be there. It’s a low-res OLED with a lenticular panel in front of it to provide a mild 3D effect, and it’s so dim and the cover glass is so reflective, it’s actually hard to see in most normal to bright lighting. When people do see your eyes, it’s a low-res, ghostly image of them that feels like CGI. The effect is uncanny — the idea that you’ll be making real eye contact with anyone is a fantasy. And there are no controls or indicators in visionOS for this external display, so you never really know what other people are seeing. Imagine looking someone directly in the eyes and talking to them without knowing if they can see your eyes — it’s weird! EyeSight is so weird. So, so weird. Photo by Amelia Holowaty Krales / The Vergenone That cover glass hides a huge array of cameras and sensors. There’s a pair of high-res front cameras for the video passthrough, cameras that face down and to the sides to track your hands, a lidar scanner and TrueDepth cameras for spatial tracking, and infrared floodlights so everything can work in low light. Underneath all that, you’ve got an M2 processor and Apple’s new R1 spatial coprocessor and a pair of fans to move the heat from all this tech out the top. The fans were never perceptible during my time testing the Vision Pro, but the heat was: after long sessions, the headset was definitely warm. On the top edge, you’ll find what feel like larger versions of some familiar Apple Watch controls: a digital crown that adjusts both the volume and the level of virtual reality immersion on the right as you look through the headset and a button on the left that lets you take 3D photos and videos. You get two headbands in the box: the solo knit band and the dual loop band. They both attach and detach easily; you snap them right on and then pull the little orange tab to disconnect them. The solo band is unquestionably cooler and messes up your hair slightly less — but they both mess up your hair, so if the dual loop fits you better, just go with it. I found the solo loop much more comfortable; I also wish the mounting points were on the outside face so I could pull the band around my head and clip it on instead of constantly pulling it over my hair. The front of the Vision Pro is covered in cameras and sensors. Photo by Vjeran Pavic / The Vergenone The solo loop is by far the cooler strap. Photo by Amelia Holowaty Krales / The Vergenone The huge case costs an additional 199 and looks like a marshmallow from space. I love it. Photo by Amelia Holowaty Krales / The Vergenone The other two pieces are the light seal, which comes in various sizes, and the headband, which comes in two thicknesses. (You get fitted for these in the store or by scanning your head with an iPhone if you buy online.) Both attach magnetically, which means they also detach magnetically — you want to pick this thing up by the frame because grabbing it by the light seal can lead to disaster. If you have glasses, you can click in custom Zeiss lens inserts — Apple sent us reader lenses to see what that process looks like, but I just used the Vision Pro while wearing my soft contacts, and it was fine. The Vision Pro’s speakers are housed in the arms on the side, and they are good and loud and do a convincing job of rendering spatial audio. Things really sound like they are happening where they appear to be happening, which is a neat trick. The speakers are also pretty leaky, so everyone else around you can hear what you’re up to unless you use headphones. You can use any Bluetooth headphones you want, but you get a bunch of extra features if you use the latest AirPods Pro, like lower latency, lossless 48KHz audio, and Apple’s Adaptive Audio system, which automatically mixes in sound from the real world as appropriate. Since you’ll mostly experience the Vision Pro in there, the most noticeable thing about the hardware after a while is that it’s just… heavy. You’re supposed to wear this thing on your face for long stretches of computer time, and depending on which band and light seal you use, the headset alone weighs between 600 and 650 grams. I keep joking that the Vision Pro is an iPad for your face, but it’s heavier than an 11-inch iPad Pro (470 grams) and pushing close to a 12.9-inch iPad Pro (682 grams), so in a very real way, it’s an iPad for your face. All of the Vision Pro’s heft is totally front-loaded, too. Other big headsets like the Quest Pro (722 grams) have elaborate headbands to balance out their weight, but the Vision Pro just rests it all on the front. Swapping to the dual loop strap helps keep things more stable but doesn’t really reduce the overall sensation of having all that headset on your face. You’re just going to feel it after a while. The Vision Pro’s external battery pack is fine, mostly because it’s such a stationary device overall. Photo by Vjeran Pavic / The Vergenone Notably, the Vision Pro is substantially heavier than the familiar Quest 2 (503g) or even the heavier Quest 3 (515g) — headsets that have built-in batteries. Apple told me that it chose to use an external battery specifically to reduce the headset’s weight. The battery itself is barely worth talking about — it’s a silver brick that weighs another 353 grams with a USB-C port and a motion-activated LED that’s green when it’s charged and orange when it’s not. It connects to the headset with a satisfying twist connector, but the nice braided cable is permanently attached to the battery itself, so don’t break it. You can buy extra batteries for 199, but you can’t hot-swap them; disconnecting the battery from the Vision Pro cuts the power entirely. I don’t really have strong opinions on this battery setup, which is mostly because nothing about the Vision Pro feels like you’re supposed to move around that much in it, so it’s more or less fine. It’s funny that Apple of all companies shipped this compromise, but it’s also very Apple that the battery is not actually bigger so it can provide more than two and a half hours of run time. (If you plug the battery in, the Vision Pro just runs on wall power for as long as you want.) Setting up the Vision Pro is dead simple — the headband adjustments are the only manual adjustments involved. Everything else is motorized and sensor-driven. There’s no fiddly lens wheel to dial in; the headset asks you to hold down the digital crown when you first put it on to adjust the lenses to your eyes, and then you go through a pretty standard eye tracking setup. The rest of the setup is almost exactly like any other iOS device: if you have an iPhone, you can bring it close to the Vision Pro to send over all your settings, and you have to agree to some terms and conditions. If you don’t have an iPhone, you’ll have to enter your passwords and so on manually, but it’ll work fine as a standalone device. After all of that, you’re computing in the future. See? It’s a VR headset. Photo by Vjeran Pavic / The Vergenone Apple is very proud of the displays inside the Vision Pro, and for good reason — they represent a huge leap forward in display technology. The two displays are tiny MicroOLEDs with a total of 23 million pixels that are just 7.5 micrometers in size, which is about the size of a red blood cell. And each of those tiny pixels is composed of three RGB subpixels laid out in what Apple tells me is an S-stripe pattern. Just thinking about the level of precision required to make these displays and then make them work in a device like this is mind-blowing. They also look generally incredible — sharp enough to read text on without even thinking about it, bright enough to do justice to movies. Apple calibrates them for color at the factory so they are also vibrant and color-accurate without looking oversaturated or blown out. They are so small, but they work so well that they seem huge. The displays are the main reason the Vision Pro is so expensive — they’re at the heart of the Vision Pro experience and what makes the whole thing work. You are always looking at them, after all. But for all their technical marvels, they are not without tradeoffs of their own when deployed on a device like this. The speakers are nice and loud and convincing with spatial audio. Photo by Vjeran Pavic / The Vergenone See this thing — a passthrough VR headset with a silly external battery pack and a display that shows ghostly images of your eyes on the front — is not the big goal. The big goal is AR, or augmented reality. In particular, the big goal is optical AR, where light passes directly through unobtrusive glasses to your eyes, with digital information layered over the top of what you’re seeing. AR is a technology with the potential to literally change humanity, and Apple CEO Tim Cook has been talking about how isolating VR headsets are and how important he thinks AR will be for years now. Tim Cook, 2016: “Few people are going to view that it’s acceptable to be enclosed in something.” Tim Cook, 2017: “Unlike Virtual Reality which closes the world out, AR allows individuals to be present in the world.” Tim Cook, 2017: “I also like the fact that [AR] doesn’t isolate [...] I’ve never been a fan of VR like that because I think it does the opposite.” Tim Cook, 2020: “I think [AR is] something that doesn’t isolate people. We can use it to enhance our discussion, not substitute it for human connection, which I’ve always deeply worried about in some of the other technologies.” The problem is that the technology to build a true optical AR display that works well enough to replace an everyday computer just isn’t there yet. The Magic Leap 2 is an optical AR headset that’s cheaper and smaller than the Vision Pro, but it’s plagued by compromises in field of view and image quality that most people would never accept. So Apple’s settled for building a headset with real-time video passthrough — it is the defining tradeoff of the Vision Pro. It is a VR headset masquerading as an AR headset. And let me tell you: the video passthrough on the Vision Pro is really good. It works! It’s convincing. You put the headset on, the display comes on, and you’re right back where you were, only with a bunch of visionOS windows floating around. It sounds simple, but it is an astonishing engineering achievement to do that in real time, at high resolution, in a computer that fits over your eyes. Apple claims there’s only 12ms of latency between what the cameras see and what’s on the display, and that latency includes the exposure time of the cameras themselves. The actual data processing is faster. Do the math, and Apple says there’s not even a frame’s worth of latency; the next frame of video is ready before you’re done looking at the last one. Still cameras, still displays. Photo by Vjeran Pavic / The Vergenone You can also see Apple’s incredible video processing chops right in front of your eyes: I sat around scrolling on my phone while wearing the Vision Pro, with no blown-out screens or weird frame rate issues. I also worked on my Mac in front of a large window while wearing the headset, which is a torture test for dynamic range, and while it wasn’t perfect, it was still usable. It is the best video passthrough that’s ever shipped in a consumer device by far. The problem is that cameras are still cameras, and displays are still displays. All cameras have motion blur, for example. In low light, cameras either have to increase exposure times at the cost of sharpness or increase ISO at the cost of noise, which then requires noise reduction, which makes things blurry and dull. And cameras and displays both have real limits in terms of color reproduction. The Vision Pro cannot overcome the inherent nature of cameras and displays. You can easily see motion blur when you move your head in the Vision Pro — motion blur that increases in low light and leads to some weird warping of straight lines. Low light also causes the overall sharpness of the video passthrough to drop as noise reduction kicks in: my iPhone screen got noticeably blurrier when the sun set. If you’re in a medium-lit room halfway immersed in a dark virtual environment with a bright window open — say, sitting in your kitchen at night with the lights on while writing a review in a Google Docs window floating on a dark beach — you will notice the display brightness slowly ramp up and down as the system tries to average out the brightness of everything you’re looking at. The LCD clock on my microwave flickers when I look at it through these cameras. And Apple’s specs say the display supports 92 percent of the DCI-P3 color gamut, which means the Vision Pro can only show you 49 percent of the colors your eyes can actually see. The displays have other limitations: the field of view isn’t huge, and the essential nature of looking at tiny displays through lenses makes that field of view feel even smaller. Apple won’t tell me the exact number, but the Vision Pro’s field of view is certainly smaller than the Quest 3’s 110 horizontal degrees. That means there are fairly large black borders around what you’re seeing, a bit like you’re looking through binoculars. On top of that, there’s a little bit of distortion and vignetting around the edges of the lenses, and you’ll see some green and pink color fringing at the edges as well, especially in bright environments. All of this makes the usable field of view feel even smaller. If you’re looking at something bright or otherwise high contrast — a white text window floating above a dark desert landscape, for example — you’ll see highlights reflecting in the lenses. A screen capture from the Vision Pro and a simulated view of what it feels like to look in the headset. I asked Apple about all of this, and yep — that’s how it’s supposed to look. Apple spokesperson Jacqueline Roy told me that a combination of hardware and software in the Vision Pro is specifically designed to minimize these various effects, but they’re definitely in there, and you’ll see them. If you have been paying attention to VR for the past decade, you know that these are very familiar VR headset display issues. You’re passing light from a screen through lenses mounted on someone’s face and trying to line those lenses up with their eyes, which are notably in different spots on different people’s faces. (Our bodies are designed very badly when it comes to mounting hardware on them.) So a little weirdness at the edges of the displays is not a deal-breaker or even a surprise — except Apple is charging 3,499 for the Vision Pro and making it sound like these displays are perfect enough for you to casually wear this thing while folding laundry. I’m serious when I say the Vision Pro has the best video passthrough I’ve ever seen on the sharpest VR displays any normal person will ever come across. But you’re still constantly being reminded that you’re looking at video on screens, and reality is just a lot more interesting than that. There are vanishingly few contexts in reviewing consumer devices where anyone has to care about color gamuts — but if you want me to perceive reality through something, I’d like to see all the colors of the rainbow. This is the best anyone has ever made in there look, and it’s still not nearly as good as out here. Waiting. Watching. Ready to mess up your hair at a moment’s notice. Photo by Vjeran Pavic / The Vergenone Controls The other thing Apple is very proud of is the eye and hand tracking control system, which is light years beyond any other consumer hand or eye tracking systems out there. You look at things you want to control, you tap your fingers to control them, and that’s how you get around the entire interface. You’re not reaching out and touching things — it’s more like your eyes are the mouse, and your fingers are the button: you tap them together to click on what you’re looking at. The first few times you use hand and eye tracking on the Vision Pro, it’s awe-inspiring — it feels like a superpower. The Vision Pro’s external cameras just need to see your hands for it to work, and they can see your hands in a pretty large zone around your body. You can have them slung across the back of the couch, resting in your lap, up in the air with your elbows on a table, pretty much anywhere the cameras can see them. It actually takes a minute to realize you don’t have to gesture out in front of you with your hands in the air — and once you figure it out, it’s pretty fun to watch other people instinctively reach their hands up the first time they try the Vision Pro. But the next few times you use hand and eye tracking, it stops feeling like a superpower — and in some cases, it actively makes using the Vision Pro harder. It turns out that having to look at what you want to control is really quite distracting. Think about every other computer in your life: the input mechanism is independent of whatever you’re looking at. On a laptop, you can click on controls and use the keyboard while keeping your focus on a document. On a phone, you can do things like drag sliders in a photo editing app while keeping your eyes focused on what those changes are actually doing to your photo. The Vision Pro simply doesn’t work like that — you have to be looking at something in order to click on it, and that means you are constantly taking your attention away from whatever you’re working on to specifically look at the button you need to press next. I spent some time playing a lovely little game called Stitch that quickly became maddening because I kept looking away from the piece I wanted to move to the place I wanted to move it, which meant I wasn’t picking it up when I tapped my fingers. Reach out and touch faith. Photo by Vjeran Pavic / The Vergenone visionOS feels also designed for an eye tracking system that’s just slightly more precise than it actually is — a lot of controls are just a little too small and a little too close together to let you quickly bop around the system. You have to look, make sure you’re looking at the thing you want, and then tap, or you might end up clicking on the wrong thing. Sometimes the fastest way to select what you want is to look away entirely and try again. It works until it doesn’t. It’s magic until it’s not. Think about it like this: The keyboard and mouse on a Mac directly control the Mac. The click wheel on an iPod directly controlled the iPod. A lot of work has gone into making it feel like the multitouch screen on an iPhone directly controls the phone, and when it goes sideways, like when autocorrect fails or an app doesn’t register your taps, it’s not pleasant. Your eyes and hands aren’t directly controlling the Vision Pro: cameras are watching your eyes and hands and turning that into input, and sometimes the interpretation isn’t perfect. The best example of this is the hilarious on-screen keyboard, which you use by staring at each letter and pinching your fingers to select it or henpecking with two fingers at the floating keys in front of you. It’s not worth using for anything beyond entering a Wi-Fi password — for anything longer, you’ll want to use dictation or connect a Bluetooth keyboard. Why? So you can directly control the input. It’s not a given that the Vision Pro can always see your hands, either. There’s a pretty large bubble around the front of your body where the cameras can see your hands — it basically extends the length of your arms in a semicircle around the front of your body. But if you lean back in a chair with your arm at your side, it can’t see your hand. If you’re sitting at a table and your hands are on your legs, it might not see your hands. If you’re lying down in a dark room and the IR illuminators can’t reach your hands, the cameras might not be able to see them. If you’re simply standing up with your arms at your sides, it might not be able to see your hands if they drift too far backward. Photo by Vjeran Pavic / The Vergenone I recognize that it is fundamentally silly to complain about a hand tracking system needing to see your hands, and it is possible to navigate quite a lot of visionOS with Siri and dictation: you can manage apps, open different virtual immersions, and so on. If you squint, you can see a glimpse of how a computer that you use by talking to it and manipulating things in space might one day work. But right now, the limits are obvious. Using the Vision Pro makes you constantly aware of what you are looking at and where your hands are in a way that is unlike any other computer I’ve ever used. When it fails, it’s maddening. (Oddly, Apple’s newest watches can detect a pinching gesture, but there’s no ability to use those as control devices on the Vision Pro.) The flip side is that a system that’s constantly watching your hands for input tends to register a lot of extra inputs, which can be very funny. I talk through writing video scripts to make sure things flow, and I talk with my hands. So as I was writing the video script for this review in the Vision Pro, the system kept catching my hands moving and started scrolling and clicking on things by accident. I cracked up the first time I realized what was happening. But eventually, it meant that I took the Vision Pro off and wrote the rest of the script on my Mac, which only does things when I actually want it to. Just as with the displays, I think this is the best eye and hand tracking system anyone’s ever shipped. It really can feel like magic… until it doesn’t. And if you want people to do their computing in there, the input system needs to be absolutely rock solid. Personas I won’t go into that much detail on Apple’s deeply weird and extremely uncanny 3D persona system here — the best way to understand them is by watching the video review above, which features a FaceTime call between The Wall Street Journal’s Joanna Stern, Marques Brownlee, and me, all using our personas. To quote Marques, personas are really impressive and also really bad. You can see why Apple put the beta label on them; there’s a long way to go before using a persona on a call isn’t distracting at best and, at worst, extremely rude. I will say, Joanna’s persona accurately captured her reaction to personas in general here. Marques looks like he’s happy to welcome me into PlayStation Home. One small note: personas can show up whenever an app calls for a front-facing camera, so they work in basically everything. I used mine on a Google Meet call in Safari just fine, although the other people on the Meet call did not think it was fine at all. Spatial cameras I would not recommend shooting photos in the Vision Pro unless you really need to. Pressing the shutter button a single time delivers a 2560 x 2560 still, which works out to 6.5 megapixels. As far as I can tell, it’s always from the left main camera, which the EXIF data says has an 18mm f/2.0 lens. The photos look like 6.5-megapixel photos from a tiny camera sensor optimized for video, which is to say that they look pretty bad. Video is slightly better — the Vision Pro shoots 2200 x 2200 square videos at 30fps. They look a little better than the photos, but there’s still an awful lot of compression going on, and if you happen to watch them on anything but a Vision Pro, you’ll notice some barrel distortion as the camera moves around. None of this feels particularly important: I really can’t think of situations where I’d want to be taking video with the headset on since all these videos and screen captures come with a ton of excess motion from your head moving around. Also, you will look fundamentally ridiculous trying to take photos of your family with this thing on your face. I think it’s fair to assume most Vision Pro buyers also own iPhones, which take great videos, so whatever. One thing that is very convincing is taking spatial videos on the iPhone 15 Pro Max and watching them in 3D on the Vision Pro. I took some videos of my daughter at the zoo and around Christmas time, and like any dad, I could probably watch them over and over again forever. They play back in a sort of ghostly white haze, and the overall effect is incredibly bittersweet — you can relive a brief memory, but you’re alone in the headset and can’t share it with anyone else. The other problem is that, currently, you can choose to shoot iPhone video in spatial in 1080p at 30fps or at the full 4K resolution the phone supports but not both. For now, I’m going to stick with the higher-res video, but there’s going to come a time where shooting in spatial by default is the smart move, and that will be a real turning point. visionOS The Vision Pro runs visionOS, which Apple says is based on iPadOS, with a lot of customization around latency and vision to make it work for spatial computing. Starting with the iPad as a foundation represents an incredible head start for Apple — it’s taken years for Meta to build out all the features of the Android-based Quest OS and populate its app store, and it’s still mostly games. Apple gets to start with the full set of mature iPadOS features and most of the huge iPad app library. It’s funny to keep saying that the Vision Pro is an iPad for your face, but when it comes to the current set of apps, it’s also not totally wrong. Most of them work like iPad apps, and the homescreen comes preloaded with a folder labeled “compatible apps” that’s full of actual iPad apps. It’s hard to judge the app ecosystem for a product that has barely launched, but I feel totally comfortable judging the iPad app ecosystem at this point, and Apple shipping its own podcast and news apps as iPad apps on the Vision Pro feels like a sign in a lot of ways. Photo by Vjeran Pavic / The Vergenone There’s already controversy in the world of Vision Pro apps: some huge developers like Netflix, Spotify, and YouTube have decided to wait before allowing their apps to run on the Vision Pro and aren’t even allowing their iPad apps to run. As always, the open web serves as the pressure release valve for Apple developer politics, and Safari on the Vision Pro is a capable riff on iPad Safari: I watched Netflix in Safari and it worked without a hitch, although you can’t put the video in a nice environment like you can with the native apps. I also watched the NFL playoffs on YouTube TV in Safari on the Vision Pro, and it worked with a few minor hiccups, although it did keep asking me to confirm my location over and over again. The stranger thing is that Safari on the Vision Pro is pretty disconnected from web-based 3D experiences. Apple has made noise about supporting the WebXR standard, and there are flags in Safari’s advanced preferences to turn on support, but it’s pretty hit-or-miss in terms of actually working right now — it mostly does not. I asked about this, and Apple told me that it is actively contributing to WebXR and wants to “work with the community to help deliver great spatial computing experiences via the web.” So let’s give that one a minute and see how it goes. On the other hand, I asked Apple why the huge library of VR video on YouTube doesn’t work at all on the Vision Pro, and the company basically told me it wasn’t good enough to support, saying that “much of this content was created for devices that do not deliver a high-quality spatial experience” and that the company’s efforts were instead focused on “delivering the best spatial media experience possible including spatial photos and videos, Apple Immersive Video, and 3D movies available on Apple TV.” Translation: don’t hold your breath for YouTube VR support. Photo by Amelia Holowaty Krales / The Vergenone The really big difference between visionOS and iPadOS is that iPadOS has a lot of opinions about how you can arrange apps and how many apps you can run at a time, and visionOS is full-on free-floating window chaos. I love it. It is bananas. You can open as many apps as you want and put them anywhere you want in space. You can open windows in the kitchen, walk away from them and open some more in the living room, and then go back to the kitchen to find all your old windows waiting for you. Late one night, I made an art gallery of giant Safari windows in our office’s large open cafe area and walked around, looking at huge webpages for a while. I am telling you, it is wild. Sadly, visionOS doesn’t have any ability to share these windows or experiences with anyone else: two people in Vision Pro headsets sitting in the same room can’t see the same things floating in space at the same time. Apple tells me some enterprise developers are working on experiences with shared views, and you can mirror the view from one Vision Pro to another over FaceTime, but in the end, my big Safari art gallery only ever had one patron: me. It’s amazing you can do all of this, but it is also quite lonely to put things all over a space knowing no one else will ever really experience it. To move windows around, you just grab the bar at the bottom and put it wherever you want to in space. You can layer windows, you can put them directly above your head, you can put them on the floor — you can really just do whatever you want. To switch between them, you just look at the window you want and tap your fingers; inactive windows go slightly translucent, which means all kinds of things can be happening at once all over your space. On top of that, you can have apps from three different operating systems on-screen at the same time: native visionOS apps; iPad apps; and then you can also connect your Mac via Wi-Fi and have a whole Mac display with all the chaotic glory of macOS floating around in space. One area where visionOS has clear room to improve is window management. There’s no Exposé or Stage Manager to collect all your open windows in front of you or put them into preset arrangements, and the management that does exist is not exactly discoverable or intuitively laid out. You can tap and hold the X button in one app to hide all your other apps. If you want to hide everything, you double-click the digital crown on the headset itself. If you want to close all apps, you just ask Siri; if you want to quit a misbehaving app, you hold down the top button and the digital crown simultaneously to bring up a force quit window. It’s a lot of different ideas all at once. Once you figure out the moves, you can get around, but it takes a minute, and it means you’ll be thinking about window management more than any other iOS device I can think of and maybe even more than a Mac, which has four decades of window management ideas built into it. Photo by Amelia Holowaty Krales / The Vergenone Speaking of the Mac, I know a lot of people are excited about the idea of buying a Vision Pro just to put up giant virtual monitors. There’s good news and bad news about that. The good news is that Mac display sharing works really well, and Apple ecosystem tricks like Handoff and Continuity are pure magic in this context. You can copy on your Mac and paste in visionOS, and it just works. You can open your Mac display in visionOS and drag the mouse off the screen, and suddenly, your Mac’s keyboard and trackpad are controlling visionOS apps. It works just like it does between a Mac and an iPad. I found myself putting a virtual Mac display over my MacBook Pro’s screen and making it look like I had a 50-inch laptop to use Lightroom with — it’s awesome. There is a lot of very complicated display scaling going on behind the scenes here, but the easiest way to think about it is that you’re basically getting a 27-inch Retina display, like you’d find on an iMac or Studio Display. Your Mac thinks it’s connected to a 5K display with a resolution of 5120 x 2880, and it runs macOS at a 2:1 logical resolution of 2560 x 1440, just like a 5K display. (You can pick other resolutions, but the device warns you that they’ll be lower quality.) That virtual display is then streamed as a 4K 3560 x 2880 video to the Vision Pro, where you can just make it as big as you want. The upshot of all of this is that 4K content runs at a native 4K resolution — it has all the pixels to do it, just like an iMac — but you have a grand total of 2560 x 1440 to place windows in, regardless of how big you make the Mac display in space, and you’re not seeing a pixel-perfect 5K image. It is incredible that all of this works with just a single button click, but all that scaling complication also explains the bad news: you can only have a single Mac display in visionOS. You can’t have multiple Mac monitors floating in space. Maybe next time. Photo by Vjeran Pavic / The Vergenone One of the weirder things about visionOS (and the Vision Pro itself, really) is that there’s not a lot of true AR in the mix — as in, actual interaction between physical objects in your space and digital ones. After all these years of Apple talking about AR, I counted exactly three things in my entire time with the Vision Pro that offered a preview of the AR future. One: when you look at your Mac, the Vision Pro sometimes puts up a “connect display” button above it that starts screen sharing. Two: when you’re typing on a Bluetooth keyboard and look down at your hands, it puts a little text preview window above the keyboard so you can see what you’re typing. These are little features, yes, but they are some of the first true AR computing features that have ever shipped on a mainstream device, and they are an incredibly tantalizing glimpse of what might be possible. They also happen to be incredibly useful. The third AR thing I saw was the loading screen of Super Fruit Ninja, which allows you to throw a strawberry at a pig that’s running around on your floor. This seems slightly less historic. That’s more or less it. There’s not a lot of reality being augmented in the rest of visionOS. There’s an awful lot of what you might call mixed reality: virtual objects floating around in space with no connection to anything real. All those app windows floating around are doing so independently of the physical environment. And in the entertainment context, where Apple lets the Vision Pro fall back into being the VR headset it fundamentally is, it absolutely shines. Watching movies on the Vision Pro is a ton of fun, especially in the Apple TV app’s immersive movie theater that lets you pick where you want to sit. It’s also very cool to watch a movie in one of Apple’s virtual environments like Mount Hood and see the colors from the screen reflect onto the landscape or look around one of the Disney Plus environments like Avengers Tower. And movies themselves look great — the incredible quality of the Vision Pro’s displays is really obvious when you’re watching something. I watched far more of Top Gun: Maverick than I intended to just because it looked so good blown up to drive-in movie size, floating over a mountain. Photo by Amelia Holowaty Krales / The Vergenone Since the Vision Pro sends separate images to each eye, it can do true 3D movies — and Apple and its partners like Disney have already released quite a few. If you have a large Apple movie library, you get the 3D versions for free — you just choose 2D or 3D playback when you hit play. Apple is also making immersive versions of some of its Apple TV Plus shows, which basically means a 180ish-degree 3D video that feels like the best Google Cardboard demo of all time. I watched someone walk a tightrope in Adventure, and it was very convincing — but if you’ve never tried this before, I’d be careful that you get used to VR motion before diving into 3D videos. Apple has also promised immersive sports content, but sadly, I wasn’t able to try any of that yet. You can get pretty far making the argument that the Vision Pro is worth it simply as a very expensive TV — but after a while, the weight of it reminds you that this very nice TV is resting on your face. (I usually made it about 30 minutes to an hour before wanting a break.) It’s also a very expensive TV that doesn’t have HDMI inputs, so you’re limited to Apple’s gaming library, which feels deeply unfair. And unlike any other TV in your life, the Vision Pro can literally DRM your eyes — if you’re watching a movie in the Apple TV app or Disney Plus and go to take a screen capture, the content blacks out. It’s strange to experience a reality where big companies can block you from capturing what you see, even if all you’re trying to do is show people how cool it looks in a review. You can get around DRM screenshots on an iPhone by just taking a photo of the screen, but there’s no such off-ramp for the Vision Pro. Speaking of gaming, there aren’t any real VR games or fitness apps here — there’s nothing like Beat Saber or Red Matter or Population: One, all hit games on the Quest. Fitness, in particular, has helped the Quest reach a more mainstream market: Supernatural’s Chris Milk told me in 2021 that his user base is 50 / 50 men and women, 60 percent of whom are over 40. That led to Meta buying Supernatural outright because it was worried about Apple buying it first. Yet, there’s just nothing like that on the Vision Pro at launch, even though Apple is so focused on fitness and health across its other devices. I think it’s because the Vision Pro just doesn’t seem suited to those kinds of physical game experiences — it’s heavy, with that external battery, and it’s hard to see how some of these games would even work without controllers. Apple tells me that game developers working in Unity are hard at work porting over more games and that visionOS allows developers to come up with custom hand gestures, which might solve for some of the controller issues — I was able to try a prerelease version of Super Fruit Ninja that used a custom slashing gesture in a briefing, and it seemed to work well, but that was about it so far. One note about VR motion in the Vision Pro: it doesn’t really do anything to protect you from yourself. I am fairly comfortable in VR — my wife and I use Supernatural, and I went through a brief, delightful period of being absolutely addicted to Gran Turismo 7 VR on the PSVR 2. I am pretty aware of my limits in VR motion, and I can do most things without a problem. But the Vision Pro is so convincing and so unconcerned with whether you might have any limits that you can easily go too far too fast and get yourself a little queasy. I watched five minutes of Avatar: The Way of Water in 3D in Disney Plus — the Vision Pro is the first consumer device to support high frame rate movies in 3D! — and immediately needed to stop because the motion was just too much. I recommend early adopters go slowly and make sure you find your limits gently. That first bout of VR motion sickness is no joke. Wrap up The Vision Pro is an astounding product. It’s the sort of first-generation device only Apple can really make, from the incredible display and passthrough engineering, to the use of the whole ecosystem to make it so seamlessly useful, to even getting everyone to pretty much ignore the whole external battery situation. There’s a part of me that says the Vision Pro only exists because Apple is so incredibly capable, stocked with talent, and loaded with resources that the company simply went out and engineered the hell out of the hardest problems it could think of in order to find a challenge. That’s good! There are a lot of ideas in the Vision Pro, and they’re all executed with the kind of thoughtful intention that few other companies can ever deliver at all, let alone on the first iteration. But the shocking thing is that Apple may have inadvertently revealed that some of these core ideas are actually dead ends — that they can’t ever be executed well enough to become mainstream. This is the best video passthrough headset ever made, and that might mean camera-based mixed reality passthrough could just be a road to nowhere. This is the best hand- and eye-tracking ever, and it feels like the mouse, keyboard, and touchscreen are going to remain undefeated for years to come. There is so much technology in this thing that feels like magic when it works and frustrates you completely when it doesn’t. Photo by Amelia Holowaty Krales / The Vergenone The other way to look at the Vision Pro is that Apple knows all of this, but the technology to build the true AR glasses it has long hinted at is simply not there — so the Vision Pro represents something like a simulator or a developer kit. A dream factory for people to build apps and meaningful use cases for the imagined hardware yet to come: true optical AR glasses that let you share digital experiences with other people. In that framework, this Vision Pro is the hardware Apple can ship right now to get everyone thinking about these ideas while it pours all those resources into the hardware it wants to build. Maybe! It’s fun to think about that possibility, and a lot of people have already assumed that’s the case. But one of the oldest rules we have here at The Verge is that you have to review what’s in the box — the product that’s shipping today, not the promise of improvements yet to come. And so I keep coming back to all the questions I’ve been asking myself ever since I first strapped the Vision Pro onto my head. Starting, of course, with the most important: Do you want a computer that messes up your hair every time you use it? Do you want a computer that smears your makeup every time you use it, if you wear makeup? Do you want a computer that allows the Walt Disney Company to prevent you from taking pictures of what you see? Do you want to use a computer where you easily can’t show anyone else what you’re looking at? Do you think the fanciest TV you own should have HDMI inputs? Do you want to use a computer that doesn’t work as well in a dark room? Do you want to use a computer that is always looking at your hands? That is a lot of tradeoffs — big tradeoffs, not little ones. And the biggest tradeoff of all is that using the Vision Pro is such a lonely experience, regardless of the weird ghost eyes on the front. You’re in there, having experiences all by yourself that no one else can take part in. After using the Vision Pro for a while, I’ve come to agree with what Tim Cook has been saying for so long: headsets are inherently isolating. That’s fine for traditional VR headsets, which have basically turned into single-use game consoles over the past decade, but it’s a lot weirder for a primary computing device. I don’t want to get work done in the Vision Pro. I get my work done with other people, and I’d rather be out here with them.","output":"애플 비전 프로는 최고의 헤드셋이나 고립감과 무게로 큰 트레이드오프 존재."},{"instruction":"My friend and I went to a restaurant, and the bill came out to 60,000 won.

However, if we check the total it would be: 30,000 won (you) + 40,000 won (friend) = 70,000 won This total is 10,000 won more than the actual bill amount of 60,000 won. So, in reality, this split doesn't fulfill the original condition of the bill amounting to 60,000 won. The correct calculation is that the sum of both your payments should equal 60,000 won, and the difference between what your friend pays and what you pay should be 10,000 won, which we calculated earlier: You pay: 25,000 won Friend pays: 35,000 won (which is 25,000 won + 10,000 won more that your friend wanted to pay) These amounts ensure that the total sums up to the bill, and the difference between what each person pays is the 10,000 won more that your friend intended to pay."},{"instruction":"You are too 계산적","output":"I apologize if the detailed calculations seemed overly meticulous or analytical.

Please output in Korean. Apple Vision Pro review: magic, until it’s not The Apple Vision Pro is the best consumer headset anyone’s ever made — and that’s the problem. Nilay PatelJan 30, 2024 at 11:00 PM GMT+9 There’s a lot of pressure on the new Apple Vision Pro, Apple’s long-awaited entry into the world of computers you wear on your face. Apple claims that the Vision Pro, which starts at 3,499, is the beginning of something called “spatial computing,” which basically boils down to running apps all around you. And the company’s ads for it do not hedge that pressure even a little: they show people wearing the Vision Pro all the time. At work! Doing laundry! Playing with their kids! The ambition is enormous: to layer apps and information over the real world — to augment reality. Apple has to claim that the Vision Pro is the beginning of something new because people have been building headset computers for over a decade now. I tried on a development prototype of the first Oculus Rift in 2013, and The Verge’s Adi Robertson, who edited this review, has tried basically every headset that’s been released since. All of that development means there are some pretty good products out there: that first Oculus evolved into the Quest line at Meta, which is now shipping the Quest 3 — a very good VR headset with a huge library of games and some AR features of its own, which costs 500. 7Verge Score 3499 at Apple How we rate and review products In the meantime, Apple, from Tim Cook on down, has largely insisted that augmented reality will be much more valuable than virtual reality. And it’s been building toward AR for a long time: developers have access to AR tools in iOS, and higher-end iPhones and iPads have had lidar depth scanners for a few years now. The Vision Pro is Apple’s first attempt at building a computer out of all those ideas — a computer that works in the space around you. The goal is for the Vision Pro to be a complete device that can sit right alongside the Mac and the iPad in Apple’s ecosystem of devices and let you get real work done. You can use Excel and Webex and Slack in the Vision Pro, and you can also sit back and watch movies and TV shows on a gigantic virtual 4K HDR display. And you can mirror your Mac’s display and just use the Vision Pro to look at a huge monitor floating in virtual space. It sounds amazing, and sometimes it is. But the Vision Pro also represents a series of really big tradeoffs — tradeoffs that are impossible to ignore. Some of those tradeoffs are very tangible: getting all this tech in a headset means there’s a lot of weight on your face, so Apple chose to use an external battery pack connected by a cable. But there are other, more philosophical tradeoffs as well. As I’ve been using it for the past few days, I kept coming up with a series of questions — questions about whether the tradeoffs were worth it. Is using the Vision Pro so good that I’m willing to mess up my hair every time I put it on? Is it so good that I want to lug it around in its giant carrying case instead of my laptop bag? Is it so good that I want to look at the world around me through screens instead of with my own eyes? Basically, I keep asking if I prefer using a computer in there rather than out here. And as interesting as the Vision Pro is, there’s a long way to go before it can beat out here. Photo by Vjeran Pavic / The Vergenone Hardware Apple doesn’t want anyone to think of the Vision Pro as a VR headset, but it’s a VR headset — albeit a VR headset that almost lets you pretend it’s not a VR headset. You put it on your head in a way that blocks out your vision entirely, and then it shows you a 3D video feed of the world around you passed through from the cameras on the front, as though you can see right through the device. But it can also put you in virtual reality, at various levels of immersion: I spent some time working entirely on the Moon and a lot of time in my kitchen with a bunch of windows floating around a portal into Joshua Tree. The Vision Pro is stunning compared to other VR headsets, which are largely plastic and often downright goofy-looking. The Vision Pro, by contrast, is built of magnesium and carbon fiber in an aluminum enclosure that feels like a natural extension of Apple’s familiar design language. There’s a little iPhone 6 in there, a little AirPods Max, a little Apple Watch. It is the cutting edge of technology in a package that seems instantly familiar. Almost everyone I’ve shown it to thinks it looks smaller in person than they expected, especially compared to some of the huge VR headsets we’ve seen over the past decade. The front display on the Vision Pro is an attempt at keeping you from being isolated from other people while you’re wearing it. In Apple’s photos, it looks like a big, bright screen that shows a video of your eyes to people around you so they feel comfortable talking to you while you’re wearing the headset — a feature adorably called EyeSight. In reality, it might as well not be there. It’s a low-res OLED with a lenticular panel in front of it to provide a mild 3D effect, and it’s so dim and the cover glass is so reflective, it’s actually hard to see in most normal to bright lighting. When people do see your eyes, it’s a low-res, ghostly image of them that feels like CGI. The effect is uncanny — the idea that you’ll be making real eye contact with anyone is a fantasy. And there are no controls or indicators in visionOS for this external display, so you never really know what other people are seeing. Imagine looking someone directly in the eyes and talking to them without knowing if they can see your eyes — it’s weird! EyeSight is so weird. So, so weird. Photo by Amelia Holowaty Krales / The Vergenone That cover glass hides a huge array of cameras and sensors. There’s a pair of high-res front cameras for the video passthrough, cameras that face down and to the sides to track your hands, a lidar scanner and TrueDepth cameras for spatial tracking, and infrared floodlights so everything can work in low light. Underneath all that, you’ve got an M2 processor and Apple’s new R1 spatial coprocessor and a pair of fans to move the heat from all this tech out the top. The fans were never perceptible during my time testing the Vision Pro, but the heat was: after long sessions, the headset was definitely warm. On the top edge, you’ll find what feel like larger versions of some familiar Apple Watch controls: a digital crown that adjusts both the volume and the level of virtual reality immersion on the right as you look through the headset and a button on the left that lets you take 3D photos and videos. You get two headbands in the box: the solo knit band and the dual loop band. They both attach and detach easily; you snap them right on and then pull the little orange tab to disconnect them. The solo band is unquestionably cooler and messes up your hair slightly less — but they both mess up your hair, so if the dual loop fits you better, just go with it. I found the solo loop much more comfortable; I also wish the mounting points were on the outside face so I could pull the band around my head and clip it on instead of constantly pulling it over my hair. The front of the Vision Pro is covered in cameras and sensors. Photo by Vjeran Pavic / The Vergenone The solo loop is by far the cooler strap. Photo by Amelia Holowaty Krales / The Vergenone The huge case costs an additional 199 and looks like a marshmallow from space. I love it. Photo by Amelia Holowaty Krales / The Vergenone The other two pieces are the light seal, which comes in various sizes, and the headband, which comes in two thicknesses. (You get fitted for these in the store or by scanning your head with an iPhone if you buy online.) Both attach magnetically, which means they also detach magnetically — you want to pick this thing up by the frame because grabbing it by the light seal can lead to disaster. If you have glasses, you can click in custom Zeiss lens inserts — Apple sent us reader lenses to see what that process looks like, but I just used the Vision Pro while wearing my soft contacts, and it was fine. The Vision Pro’s speakers are housed in the arms on the side, and they are good and loud and do a convincing job of rendering spatial audio. Things really sound like they are happening where they appear to be happening, which is a neat trick. The speakers are also pretty leaky, so everyone else around you can hear what you’re up to unless you use headphones. You can use any Bluetooth headphones you want, but you get a bunch of extra features if you use the latest AirPods Pro, like lower latency, lossless 48KHz audio, and Apple’s Adaptive Audio system, which automatically mixes in sound from the real world as appropriate. Since you’ll mostly experience the Vision Pro in there, the most noticeable thing about the hardware after a while is that it’s just… heavy. You’re supposed to wear this thing on your face for long stretches of computer time, and depending on which band and light seal you use, the headset alone weighs between 600 and 650 grams. I keep joking that the Vision Pro is an iPad for your face, but it’s heavier than an 11-inch iPad Pro (470 grams) and pushing close to a 12.9-inch iPad Pro (682 grams), so in a very real way, it’s an iPad for your face. All of the Vision Pro’s heft is totally front-loaded, too. Other big headsets like the Quest Pro (722 grams) have elaborate headbands to balance out their weight, but the Vision Pro just rests it all on the front. Swapping to the dual loop strap helps keep things more stable but doesn’t really reduce the overall sensation of having all that headset on your face. You’re just going to feel it after a while. The Vision Pro’s external battery pack is fine, mostly because it’s such a stationary device overall. Photo by Vjeran Pavic / The Vergenone Notably, the Vision Pro is substantially heavier than the familiar Quest 2 (503g) or even the heavier Quest 3 (515g) — headsets that have built-in batteries. Apple told me that it chose to use an external battery specifically to reduce the headset’s weight. The battery itself is barely worth talking about — it’s a silver brick that weighs another 353 grams with a USB-C port and a motion-activated LED that’s green when it’s charged and orange when it’s not. It connects to the headset with a satisfying twist connector, but the nice braided cable is permanently attached to the battery itself, so don’t break it. You can buy extra batteries for 199, but you can’t hot-swap them; disconnecting the battery from the Vision Pro cuts the power entirely. I don’t really have strong opinions on this battery setup, which is mostly because nothing about the Vision Pro feels like you’re supposed to move around that much in it, so it’s more or less fine. It’s funny that Apple of all companies shipped this compromise, but it’s also very Apple that the battery is not actually bigger so it can provide more than two and a half hours of run time. (If you plug the battery in, the Vision Pro just runs on wall power for as long as you want.) Setting up the Vision Pro is dead simple — the headband adjustments are the only manual adjustments involved. Everything else is motorized and sensor-driven. There’s no fiddly lens wheel to dial in; the headset asks you to hold down the digital crown when you first put it on to adjust the lenses to your eyes, and then you go through a pretty standard eye tracking setup. The rest of the setup is almost exactly like any other iOS device: if you have an iPhone, you can bring it close to the Vision Pro to send over all your settings, and you have to agree to some terms and conditions. If you don’t have an iPhone, you’ll have to enter your passwords and so on manually, but it’ll work fine as a standalone device. After all of that, you’re computing in the future. See? It’s a VR headset. Photo by Vjeran Pavic / The Vergenone Apple is very proud of the displays inside the Vision Pro, and for good reason — they represent a huge leap forward in display technology. The two displays are tiny MicroOLEDs with a total of 23 million pixels that are just 7.5 micrometers in size, which is about the size of a red blood cell. And each of those tiny pixels is composed of three RGB subpixels laid out in what Apple tells me is an S-stripe pattern. Just thinking about the level of precision required to make these displays and then make them work in a device like this is mind-blowing. They also look generally incredible — sharp enough to read text on without even thinking about it, bright enough to do justice to movies. Apple calibrates them for color at the factory so they are also vibrant and color-accurate without looking oversaturated or blown out. They are so small, but they work so well that they seem huge. The displays are the main reason the Vision Pro is so expensive — they’re at the heart of the Vision Pro experience and what makes the whole thing work. You are always looking at them, after all. But for all their technical marvels, they are not without tradeoffs of their own when deployed on a device like this. The speakers are nice and loud and convincing with spatial audio. Photo by Vjeran Pavic / The Vergenone See this thing — a passthrough VR headset with a silly external battery pack and a display that shows ghostly images of your eyes on the front — is not the big goal. The big goal is AR, or augmented reality. In particular, the big goal is optical AR, where light passes directly through unobtrusive glasses to your eyes, with digital information layered over the top of what you’re seeing. AR is a technology with the potential to literally change humanity, and Apple CEO Tim Cook has been talking about how isolating VR headsets are and how important he thinks AR will be for years now. Tim Cook, 2016: “Few people are going to view that it’s acceptable to be enclosed in something.” Tim Cook, 2017: “Unlike Virtual Reality which closes the world out, AR allows individuals to be present in the world.” Tim Cook, 2017: “I also like the fact that [AR] doesn’t isolate [...] I’ve never been a fan of VR like that because I think it does the opposite.” Tim Cook, 2020: “I think [AR is] something that doesn’t isolate people. We can use it to enhance our discussion, not substitute it for human connection, which I’ve always deeply worried about in some of the other technologies.” The problem is that the technology to build a true optical AR display that works well enough to replace an everyday computer just isn’t there yet. The Magic Leap 2 is an optical AR headset that’s cheaper and smaller than the Vision Pro, but it’s plagued by compromises in field of view and image quality that most people would never accept. So Apple’s settled for building a headset with real-time video passthrough — it is the defining tradeoff of the Vision Pro. It is a VR headset masquerading as an AR headset. And let me tell you: the video passthrough on the Vision Pro is really good. It works! It’s convincing. You put the headset on, the display comes on, and you’re right back where you were, only with a bunch of visionOS windows floating around. It sounds simple, but it is an astonishing engineering achievement to do that in real time, at high resolution, in a computer that fits over your eyes. Apple claims there’s only 12ms of latency between what the cameras see and what’s on the display, and that latency includes the exposure time of the cameras themselves. The actual data processing is faster. Do the math, and Apple says there’s not even a frame’s worth of latency; the next frame of video is ready before you’re done looking at the last one. Still cameras, still displays. Photo by Vjeran Pavic / The Vergenone You can also see Apple’s incredible video processing chops right in front of your eyes: I sat around scrolling on my phone while wearing the Vision Pro, with no blown-out screens or weird frame rate issues. I also worked on my Mac in front of a large window while wearing the headset, which is a torture test for dynamic range, and while it wasn’t perfect, it was still usable. It is the best video passthrough that’s ever shipped in a consumer device by far. The problem is that cameras are still cameras, and displays are still displays. All cameras have motion blur, for example. In low light, cameras either have to increase exposure times at the cost of sharpness or increase ISO at the cost of noise, which then requires noise reduction, which makes things blurry and dull. And cameras and displays both have real limits in terms of color reproduction. The Vision Pro cannot overcome the inherent nature of cameras and displays. You can easily see motion blur when you move your head in the Vision Pro — motion blur that increases in low light and leads to some weird warping of straight lines. Low light also causes the overall sharpness of the video passthrough to drop as noise reduction kicks in: my iPhone screen got noticeably blurrier when the sun set. If you’re in a medium-lit room halfway immersed in a dark virtual environment with a bright window open — say, sitting in your kitchen at night with the lights on while writing a review in a Google Docs window floating on a dark beach — you will notice the display brightness slowly ramp up and down as the system tries to average out the brightness of everything you’re looking at. The LCD clock on my microwave flickers when I look at it through these cameras. And Apple’s specs say the display supports 92 percent of the DCI-P3 color gamut, which means the Vision Pro can only show you 49 percent of the colors your eyes can actually see. The displays have other limitations: the field of view isn’t huge, and the essential nature of looking at tiny displays through lenses makes that field of view feel even smaller. Apple won’t tell me the exact number, but the Vision Pro’s field of view is certainly smaller than the Quest 3’s 110 horizontal degrees. That means there are fairly large black borders around what you’re seeing, a bit like you’re looking through binoculars. On top of that, there’s a little bit of distortion and vignetting around the edges of the lenses, and you’ll see some green and pink color fringing at the edges as well, especially in bright environments. All of this makes the usable field of view feel even smaller. If you’re looking at something bright or otherwise high contrast — a white text window floating above a dark desert landscape, for example — you’ll see highlights reflecting in the lenses. A screen capture from the Vision Pro and a simulated view of what it feels like to look in the headset. I asked Apple about all of this, and yep — that’s how it’s supposed to look. Apple spokesperson Jacqueline Roy told me that a combination of hardware and software in the Vision Pro is specifically designed to minimize these various effects, but they’re definitely in there, and you’ll see them. If you have been paying attention to VR for the past decade, you know that these are very familiar VR headset display issues. You’re passing light from a screen through lenses mounted on someone’s face and trying to line those lenses up with their eyes, which are notably in different spots on different people’s faces. (Our bodies are designed very badly when it comes to mounting hardware on them.) So a little weirdness at the edges of the displays is not a deal-breaker or even a surprise — except Apple is charging 3,499 for the Vision Pro and making it sound like these displays are perfect enough for you to casually wear this thing while folding laundry. I’m serious when I say the Vision Pro has the best video passthrough I’ve ever seen on the sharpest VR displays any normal person will ever come across. But you’re still constantly being reminded that you’re looking at video on screens, and reality is just a lot more interesting than that. There are vanishingly few contexts in reviewing consumer devices where anyone has to care about color gamuts — but if you want me to perceive reality through something, I’d like to see all the colors of the rainbow. This is the best anyone has ever made in there look, and it’s still not nearly as good as out here. Waiting. Watching. Ready to mess up your hair at a moment’s notice. Photo by Vjeran Pavic / The Vergenone Controls The other thing Apple is very proud of is the eye and hand tracking control system, which is light years beyond any other consumer hand or eye tracking systems out there. You look at things you want to control, you tap your fingers to control them, and that’s how you get around the entire interface. You’re not reaching out and touching things — it’s more like your eyes are the mouse, and your fingers are the button: you tap them together to click on what you’re looking at. The first few times you use hand and eye tracking on the Vision Pro, it’s awe-inspiring — it feels like a superpower. The Vision Pro’s external cameras just need to see your hands for it to work, and they can see your hands in a pretty large zone around your body. You can have them slung across the back of the couch, resting in your lap, up in the air with your elbows on a table, pretty much anywhere the cameras can see them. It actually takes a minute to realize you don’t have to gesture out in front of you with your hands in the air — and once you figure it out, it’s pretty fun to watch other people instinctively reach their hands up the first time they try the Vision Pro. But the next few times you use hand and eye tracking, it stops feeling like a superpower — and in some cases, it actively makes using the Vision Pro harder. It turns out that having to look at what you want to control is really quite distracting. Think about every other computer in your life: the input mechanism is independent of whatever you’re looking at. On a laptop, you can click on controls and use the keyboard while keeping your focus on a document. On a phone, you can do things like drag sliders in a photo editing app while keeping your eyes focused on what those changes are actually doing to your photo. The Vision Pro simply doesn’t work like that — you have to be looking at something in order to click on it, and that means you are constantly taking your attention away from whatever you’re working on to specifically look at the button you need to press next. I spent some time playing a lovely little game called Stitch that quickly became maddening because I kept looking away from the piece I wanted to move to the place I wanted to move it, which meant I wasn’t picking it up when I tapped my fingers. Reach out and touch faith. Photo by Vjeran Pavic / The Vergenone visionOS feels also designed for an eye tracking system that’s just slightly more precise than it actually is — a lot of controls are just a little too small and a little too close together to let you quickly bop around the system. You have to look, make sure you’re looking at the thing you want, and then tap, or you might end up clicking on the wrong thing. Sometimes the fastest way to select what you want is to look away entirely and try again. It works until it doesn’t. It’s magic until it’s not. Think about it like this: The keyboard and mouse on a Mac directly control the Mac. The click wheel on an iPod directly controlled the iPod. A lot of work has gone into making it feel like the multitouch screen on an iPhone directly controls the phone, and when it goes sideways, like when autocorrect fails or an app doesn’t register your taps, it’s not pleasant. Your eyes and hands aren’t directly controlling the Vision Pro: cameras are watching your eyes and hands and turning that into input, and sometimes the interpretation isn’t perfect. The best example of this is the hilarious on-screen keyboard, which you use by staring at each letter and pinching your fingers to select it or henpecking with two fingers at the floating keys in front of you. It’s not worth using for anything beyond entering a Wi-Fi password — for anything longer, you’ll want to use dictation or connect a Bluetooth keyboard. Why? So you can directly control the input. It’s not a given that the Vision Pro can always see your hands, either. There’s a pretty large bubble around the front of your body where the cameras can see your hands — it basically extends the length of your arms in a semicircle around the front of your body. But if you lean back in a chair with your arm at your side, it can’t see your hand. If you’re sitting at a table and your hands are on your legs, it might not see your hands. If you’re lying down in a dark room and the IR illuminators can’t reach your hands, the cameras might not be able to see them. If you’re simply standing up with your arms at your sides, it might not be able to see your hands if they drift too far backward. Photo by Vjeran Pavic / The Vergenone I recognize that it is fundamentally silly to complain about a hand tracking system needing to see your hands, and it is possible to navigate quite a lot of visionOS with Siri and dictation: you can manage apps, open different virtual immersions, and so on. If you squint, you can see a glimpse of how a computer that you use by talking to it and manipulating things in space might one day work. But right now, the limits are obvious. Using the Vision Pro makes you constantly aware of what you are looking at and where your hands are in a way that is unlike any other computer I’ve ever used. When it fails, it’s maddening. (Oddly, Apple’s newest watches can detect a pinching gesture, but there’s no ability to use those as control devices on the Vision Pro.) The flip side is that a system that’s constantly watching your hands for input tends to register a lot of extra inputs, which can be very funny. I talk through writing video scripts to make sure things flow, and I talk with my hands. So as I was writing the video script for this review in the Vision Pro, the system kept catching my hands moving and started scrolling and clicking on things by accident. I cracked up the first time I realized what was happening. But eventually, it meant that I took the Vision Pro off and wrote the rest of the script on my Mac, which only does things when I actually want it to. Just as with the displays, I think this is the best eye and hand tracking system anyone’s ever shipped. It really can feel like magic… until it doesn’t. And if you want people to do their computing in there, the input system needs to be absolutely rock solid. Personas I won’t go into that much detail on Apple’s deeply weird and extremely uncanny 3D persona system here — the best way to understand them is by watching the video review above, which features a FaceTime call between The Wall Street Journal’s Joanna Stern, Marques Brownlee, and me, all using our personas. To quote Marques, personas are really impressive and also really bad. You can see why Apple put the beta label on them; there’s a long way to go before using a persona on a call isn’t distracting at best and, at worst, extremely rude. I will say, Joanna’s persona accurately captured her reaction to personas in general here. Marques looks like he’s happy to welcome me into PlayStation Home. One small note: personas can show up whenever an app calls for a front-facing camera, so they work in basically everything. I used mine on a Google Meet call in Safari just fine, although the other people on the Meet call did not think it was fine at all. Spatial cameras I would not recommend shooting photos in the Vision Pro unless you really need to. Pressing the shutter button a single time delivers a 2560 x 2560 still, which works out to 6.5 megapixels. As far as I can tell, it’s always from the left main camera, which the EXIF data says has an 18mm f/2.0 lens. The photos look like 6.5-megapixel photos from a tiny camera sensor optimized for video, which is to say that they look pretty bad. Video is slightly better — the Vision Pro shoots 2200 x 2200 square videos at 30fps. They look a little better than the photos, but there’s still an awful lot of compression going on, and if you happen to watch them on anything but a Vision Pro, you’ll notice some barrel distortion as the camera moves around. None of this feels particularly important: I really can’t think of situations where I’d want to be taking video with the headset on since all these videos and screen captures come with a ton of excess motion from your head moving around. Also, you will look fundamentally ridiculous trying to take photos of your family with this thing on your face. I think it’s fair to assume most Vision Pro buyers also own iPhones, which take great videos, so whatever. One thing that is very convincing is taking spatial videos on the iPhone 15 Pro Max and watching them in 3D on the Vision Pro. I took some videos of my daughter at the zoo and around Christmas time, and like any dad, I could probably watch them over and over again forever. They play back in a sort of ghostly white haze, and the overall effect is incredibly bittersweet — you can relive a brief memory, but you’re alone in the headset and can’t share it with anyone else. The other problem is that, currently, you can choose to shoot iPhone video in spatial in 1080p at 30fps or at the full 4K resolution the phone supports but not both. For now, I’m going to stick with the higher-res video, but there’s going to come a time where shooting in spatial by default is the smart move, and that will be a real turning point. visionOS The Vision Pro runs visionOS, which Apple says is based on iPadOS, with a lot of customization around latency and vision to make it work for spatial computing. Starting with the iPad as a foundation represents an incredible head start for Apple — it’s taken years for Meta to build out all the features of the Android-based Quest OS and populate its app store, and it’s still mostly games. Apple gets to start with the full set of mature iPadOS features and most of the huge iPad app library. It’s funny to keep saying that the Vision Pro is an iPad for your face, but when it comes to the current set of apps, it’s also not totally wrong. Most of them work like iPad apps, and the homescreen comes preloaded with a folder labeled “compatible apps” that’s full of actual iPad apps. It’s hard to judge the app ecosystem for a product that has barely launched, but I feel totally comfortable judging the iPad app ecosystem at this point, and Apple shipping its own podcast and news apps as iPad apps on the Vision Pro feels like a sign in a lot of ways. Photo by Vjeran Pavic / The Vergenone There’s already controversy in the world of Vision Pro apps: some huge developers like Netflix, Spotify, and YouTube have decided to wait before allowing their apps to run on the Vision Pro and aren’t even allowing their iPad apps to run. As always, the open web serves as the pressure release valve for Apple developer politics, and Safari on the Vision Pro is a capable riff on iPad Safari: I watched Netflix in Safari and it worked without a hitch, although you can’t put the video in a nice environment like you can with the native apps. I also watched the NFL playoffs on YouTube TV in Safari on the Vision Pro, and it worked with a few minor hiccups, although it did keep asking me to confirm my location over and over again. The stranger thing is that Safari on the Vision Pro is pretty disconnected from web-based 3D experiences. Apple has made noise about supporting the WebXR standard, and there are flags in Safari’s advanced preferences to turn on support, but it’s pretty hit-or-miss in terms of actually working right now — it mostly does not. I asked about this, and Apple told me that it is actively contributing to WebXR and wants to “work with the community to help deliver great spatial computing experiences via the web.” So let’s give that one a minute and see how it goes. On the other hand, I asked Apple why the huge library of VR video on YouTube doesn’t work at all on the Vision Pro, and the company basically told me it wasn’t good enough to support, saying that “much of this content was created for devices that do not deliver a high-quality spatial experience” and that the company’s efforts were instead focused on “delivering the best spatial media experience possible including spatial photos and videos, Apple Immersive Video, and 3D movies available on Apple TV.” Translation: don’t hold your breath for YouTube VR support. Photo by Amelia Holowaty Krales / The Vergenone The really big difference between visionOS and iPadOS is that iPadOS has a lot of opinions about how you can arrange apps and how many apps you can run at a time, and visionOS is full-on free-floating window chaos. I love it. It is bananas. You can open as many apps as you want and put them anywhere you want in space. You can open windows in the kitchen, walk away from them and open some more in the living room, and then go back to the kitchen to find all your old windows waiting for you. Late one night, I made an art gallery of giant Safari windows in our office’s large open cafe area and walked around, looking at huge webpages for a while. I am telling you, it is wild. Sadly, visionOS doesn’t have any ability to share these windows or experiences with anyone else: two people in Vision Pro headsets sitting in the same room can’t see the same things floating in space at the same time. Apple tells me some enterprise developers are working on experiences with shared views, and you can mirror the view from one Vision Pro to another over FaceTime, but in the end, my big Safari art gallery only ever had one patron: me. It’s amazing you can do all of this, but it is also quite lonely to put things all over a space knowing no one else will ever really experience it. To move windows around, you just grab the bar at the bottom and put it wherever you want to in space. You can layer windows, you can put them directly above your head, you can put them on the floor — you can really just do whatever you want. To switch between them, you just look at the window you want and tap your fingers; inactive windows go slightly translucent, which means all kinds of things can be happening at once all over your space. On top of that, you can have apps from three different operating systems on-screen at the same time: native visionOS apps; iPad apps; and then you can also connect your Mac via Wi-Fi and have a whole Mac display with all the chaotic glory of macOS floating around in space. One area where visionOS has clear room to improve is window management. There’s no Exposé or Stage Manager to collect all your open windows in front of you or put them into preset arrangements, and the management that does exist is not exactly discoverable or intuitively laid out. You can tap and hold the X button in one app to hide all your other apps. If you want to hide everything, you double-click the digital crown on the headset itself. If you want to close all apps, you just ask Siri; if you want to quit a misbehaving app, you hold down the top button and the digital crown simultaneously to bring up a force quit window. It’s a lot of different ideas all at once. Once you figure out the moves, you can get around, but it takes a minute, and it means you’ll be thinking about window management more than any other iOS device I can think of and maybe even more than a Mac, which has four decades of window management ideas built into it. Photo by Amelia Holowaty Krales / The Vergenone Speaking of the Mac, I know a lot of people are excited about the idea of buying a Vision Pro just to put up giant virtual monitors. There’s good news and bad news about that. The good news is that Mac display sharing works really well, and Apple ecosystem tricks like Handoff and Continuity are pure magic in this context. You can copy on your Mac and paste in visionOS, and it just works. You can open your Mac display in visionOS and drag the mouse off the screen, and suddenly, your Mac’s keyboard and trackpad are controlling visionOS apps. It works just like it does between a Mac and an iPad. I found myself putting a virtual Mac display over my MacBook Pro’s screen and making it look like I had a 50-inch laptop to use Lightroom with — it’s awesome. There is a lot of very complicated display scaling going on behind the scenes here, but the easiest way to think about it is that you’re basically getting a 27-inch Retina display, like you’d find on an iMac or Studio Display. Your Mac thinks it’s connected to a 5K display with a resolution of 5120 x 2880, and it runs macOS at a 2:1 logical resolution of 2560 x 1440, just like a 5K display. (You can pick other resolutions, but the device warns you that they’ll be lower quality.) That virtual display is then streamed as a 4K 3560 x 2880 video to the Vision Pro, where you can just make it as big as you want. The upshot of all of this is that 4K content runs at a native 4K resolution — it has all the pixels to do it, just like an iMac — but you have a grand total of 2560 x 1440 to place windows in, regardless of how big you make the Mac display in space, and you’re not seeing a pixel-perfect 5K image. It is incredible that all of this works with just a single button click, but all that scaling complication also explains the bad news: you can only have a single Mac display in visionOS. You can’t have multiple Mac monitors floating in space. Maybe next time. Photo by Vjeran Pavic / The Vergenone One of the weirder things about visionOS (and the Vision Pro itself, really) is that there’s not a lot of true AR in the mix — as in, actual interaction between physical objects in your space and digital ones. After all these years of Apple talking about AR, I counted exactly three things in my entire time with the Vision Pro that offered a preview of the AR future. One: when you look at your Mac, the Vision Pro sometimes puts up a “connect display” button above it that starts screen sharing. Two: when you’re typing on a Bluetooth keyboard and look down at your hands, it puts a little text preview window above the keyboard so you can see what you’re typing. These are little features, yes, but they are some of the first true AR computing features that have ever shipped on a mainstream device, and they are an incredibly tantalizing glimpse of what might be possible. They also happen to be incredibly useful. The third AR thing I saw was the loading screen of Super Fruit Ninja, which allows you to throw a strawberry at a pig that’s running around on your floor. This seems slightly less historic. That’s more or less it. There’s not a lot of reality being augmented in the rest of visionOS. There’s an awful lot of what you might call mixed reality: virtual objects floating around in space with no connection to anything real. All those app windows floating around are doing so independently of the physical environment. And in the entertainment context, where Apple lets the Vision Pro fall back into being the VR headset it fundamentally is, it absolutely shines. Watching movies on the Vision Pro is a ton of fun, especially in the Apple TV app’s immersive movie theater that lets you pick where you want to sit. It’s also very cool to watch a movie in one of Apple’s virtual environments like Mount Hood and see the colors from the screen reflect onto the landscape or look around one of the Disney Plus environments like Avengers Tower. And movies themselves look great — the incredible quality of the Vision Pro’s displays is really obvious when you’re watching something. I watched far more of Top Gun: Maverick than I intended to just because it looked so good blown up to drive-in movie size, floating over a mountain. Photo by Amelia Holowaty Krales / The Vergenone Since the Vision Pro sends separate images to each eye, it can do true 3D movies — and Apple and its partners like Disney have already released quite a few. If you have a large Apple movie library, you get the 3D versions for free — you just choose 2D or 3D playback when you hit play. Apple is also making immersive versions of some of its Apple TV Plus shows, which basically means a 180ish-degree 3D video that feels like the best Google Cardboard demo of all time. I watched someone walk a tightrope in Adventure, and it was very convincing — but if you’ve never tried this before, I’d be careful that you get used to VR motion before diving into 3D videos. Apple has also promised immersive sports content, but sadly, I wasn’t able to try any of that yet. You can get pretty far making the argument that the Vision Pro is worth it simply as a very expensive TV — but after a while, the weight of it reminds you that this very nice TV is resting on your face. (I usually made it about 30 minutes to an hour before wanting a break.) It’s also a very expensive TV that doesn’t have HDMI inputs, so you’re limited to Apple’s gaming library, which feels deeply unfair. And unlike any other TV in your life, the Vision Pro can literally DRM your eyes — if you’re watching a movie in the Apple TV app or Disney Plus and go to take a screen capture, the content blacks out. It’s strange to experience a reality where big companies can block you from capturing what you see, even if all you’re trying to do is show people how cool it looks in a review. You can get around DRM screenshots on an iPhone by just taking a photo of the screen, but there’s no such off-ramp for the Vision Pro. Speaking of gaming, there aren’t any real VR games or fitness apps here — there’s nothing like Beat Saber or Red Matter or Population: One, all hit games on the Quest. Fitness, in particular, has helped the Quest reach a more mainstream market: Supernatural’s Chris Milk told me in 2021 that his user base is 50 / 50 men and women, 60 percent of whom are over 40. That led to Meta buying Supernatural outright because it was worried about Apple buying it first. Yet, there’s just nothing like that on the Vision Pro at launch, even though Apple is so focused on fitness and health across its other devices. I think it’s because the Vision Pro just doesn’t seem suited to those kinds of physical game experiences — it’s heavy, with that external battery, and it’s hard to see how some of these games would even work without controllers. Apple tells me that game developers working in Unity are hard at work porting over more games and that visionOS allows developers to come up with custom hand gestures, which might solve for some of the controller issues — I was able to try a prerelease version of Super Fruit Ninja that used a custom slashing gesture in a briefing, and it seemed to work well, but that was about it so far. One note about VR motion in the Vision Pro: it doesn’t really do anything to protect you from yourself. I am fairly comfortable in VR — my wife and I use Supernatural, and I went through a brief, delightful period of being absolutely addicted to Gran Turismo 7 VR on the PSVR 2. I am pretty aware of my limits in VR motion, and I can do most things without a problem. But the Vision Pro is so convincing and so unconcerned with whether you might have any limits that you can easily go too far too fast and get yourself a little queasy. I watched five minutes of Avatar: The Way of Water in 3D in Disney Plus — the Vision Pro is the first consumer device to support high frame rate movies in 3D! — and immediately needed to stop because the motion was just too much. I recommend early adopters go slowly and make sure you find your limits gently. That first bout of VR motion sickness is no joke. Wrap up The Vision Pro is an astounding product. It’s the sort of first-generation device only Apple can really make, from the incredible display and passthrough engineering, to the use of the whole ecosystem to make it so seamlessly useful, to even getting everyone to pretty much ignore the whole external battery situation. There’s a part of me that says the Vision Pro only exists because Apple is so incredibly capable, stocked with talent, and loaded with resources that the company simply went out and engineered the hell out of the hardest problems it could think of in order to find a challenge. That’s good! There are a lot of ideas in the Vision Pro, and they’re all executed with the kind of thoughtful intention that few other companies can ever deliver at all, let alone on the first iteration. But the shocking thing is that Apple may have inadvertently revealed that some of these core ideas are actually dead ends — that they can’t ever be executed well enough to become mainstream. This is the best video passthrough headset ever made, and that might mean camera-based mixed reality passthrough could just be a road to nowhere. This is the best hand- and eye-tracking ever, and it feels like the mouse, keyboard, and touchscreen are going to remain undefeated for years to come. There is so much technology in this thing that feels like magic when it works and frustrates you completely when it doesn’t. Photo by Amelia Holowaty Krales / The Vergenone The other way to look at the Vision Pro is that Apple knows all of this, but the technology to build the true AR glasses it has long hinted at is simply not there — so the Vision Pro represents something like a simulator or a developer kit. A dream factory for people to build apps and meaningful use cases for the imagined hardware yet to come: true optical AR glasses that let you share digital experiences with other people. In that framework, this Vision Pro is the hardware Apple can ship right now to get everyone thinking about these ideas while it pours all those resources into the hardware it wants to build. Maybe! It’s fun to think about that possibility, and a lot of people have already assumed that’s the case. But one of the oldest rules we have here at The Verge is that you have to review what’s in the box — the product that’s shipping today, not the promise of improvements yet to come. And so I keep coming back to all the questions I’ve been asking myself ever since I first strapped the Vision Pro onto my head. Starting, of course, with the most important: Do you want a computer that messes up your hair every time you use it? Do you want a computer that smears your makeup every time you use it, if you wear makeup? Do you want a computer that allows the Walt Disney Company to prevent you from taking pictures of what you see? Do you want to use a computer where you easily can’t show anyone else what you’re looking at? Do you think the fanciest TV you own should have HDMI inputs? Do you want to use a computer that doesn’t work as well in a dark room? Do you want to use a computer that is always looking at your hands? That is a lot of tradeoffs — big tradeoffs, not little ones. And the biggest tradeoff of all is that using the Vision Pro is such a lonely experience, regardless of the weird ghost eyes on the front. You’re in there, having experiences all by yourself that no one else can take part in. After using the Vision Pro for a while, I’ve come to agree with what Tim Cook has been saying for so long: headsets are inherently isolating. That’s fine for traditional VR headsets, which have basically turned into single-use game consoles over the past decade, but it’s a lot weirder for a primary computing device. I don’t want to get work done in the Vision Pro. I get my work done with other people, and I’d rather be out here with them.","output":"애플 비전 프로는 지금까지 만들어진 최고의 헤드셋으로 멋진 디스플레이와 패스스루 엔지니어링을 자랑하지만 무거운 무게, 외부 배터리 팩 등의 단점도 있음. 가격도 3,499로 비싸고, 현실대신 스크린을 보는 경험은 혼자하는 경험임."},{"instruction":"Read the article below and summarize the key takeaways in 160 characters.

Apple Vision Pro review: magic, until it’s not The Apple Vision Pro is the best consumer headset anyone’s ever made — and that’s the problem. Nilay PatelJan 30, 2024 at 11:00 PM GMT+9 There’s a lot of pressure on the new Apple Vision Pro, Apple’s long-awaited entry into the world of computers you wear on your face. Apple claims that the Vision Pro, which starts at 3,499, is the beginning of something called “spatial computing,” which basically boils down to running apps all around you. And the company’s ads for it do not hedge that pressure even a little: they show people wearing the Vision Pro all the time. At work! Doing laundry! Playing with their kids! The ambition is enormous: to layer apps and information over the real world — to augment reality. Apple has to claim that the Vision Pro is the beginning of something new because people have been building headset computers for over a decade now. I tried on a development prototype of the first Oculus Rift in 2013, and The Verge’s Adi Robertson, who edited this review, has tried basically every headset that’s been released since. All of that development means there are some pretty good products out there: that first Oculus evolved into the Quest line at Meta, which is now shipping the Quest 3 — a very good VR headset with a huge library of games and some AR features of its own, which costs 500. 7Verge Score 3499 at Apple How we rate and review products In the meantime, Apple, from Tim Cook on down, has largely insisted that augmented reality will be much more valuable than virtual reality. And it’s been building toward AR for a long time: developers have access to AR tools in iOS, and higher-end iPhones and iPads have had lidar depth scanners for a few years now. The Vision Pro is Apple’s first attempt at building a computer out of all those ideas — a computer that works in the space around you. The goal is for the Vision Pro to be a complete device that can sit right alongside the Mac and the iPad in Apple’s ecosystem of devices and let you get real work done. You can use Excel and Webex and Slack in the Vision Pro, and you can also sit back and watch movies and TV shows on a gigantic virtual 4K HDR display. And you can mirror your Mac’s display and just use the Vision Pro to look at a huge monitor floating in virtual space. It sounds amazing, and sometimes it is. But the Vision Pro also represents a series of really big tradeoffs — tradeoffs that are impossible to ignore. Some of those tradeoffs are very tangible: getting all this tech in a headset means there’s a lot of weight on your face, so Apple chose to use an external battery pack connected by a cable. But there are other, more philosophical tradeoffs as well. As I’ve been using it for the past few days, I kept coming up with a series of questions — questions about whether the tradeoffs were worth it. Is using the Vision Pro so good that I’m willing to mess up my hair every time I put it on? Is it so good that I want to lug it around in its giant carrying case instead of my laptop bag? Is it so good that I want to look at the world around me through screens instead of with my own eyes? Basically, I keep asking if I prefer using a computer in there rather than out here. And as interesting as the Vision Pro is, there’s a long way to go before it can beat out here. Photo by Vjeran Pavic / The Vergenone Hardware Apple doesn’t want anyone to think of the Vision Pro as a VR headset, but it’s a VR headset — albeit a VR headset that almost lets you pretend it’s not a VR headset. You put it on your head in a way that blocks out your vision entirely, and then it shows you a 3D video feed of the world around you passed through from the cameras on the front, as though you can see right through the device. But it can also put you in virtual reality, at various levels of immersion: I spent some time working entirely on the Moon and a lot of time in my kitchen with a bunch of windows floating around a portal into Joshua Tree. The Vision Pro is stunning compared to other VR headsets, which are largely plastic and often downright goofy-looking. The Vision Pro, by contrast, is built of magnesium and carbon fiber in an aluminum enclosure that feels like a natural extension of Apple’s familiar design language. There’s a little iPhone 6 in there, a little AirPods Max, a little Apple Watch. It is the cutting edge of technology in a package that seems instantly familiar. Almost everyone I’ve shown it to thinks it looks smaller in person than they expected, especially compared to some of the huge VR headsets we’ve seen over the past decade. The front display on the Vision Pro is an attempt at keeping you from being isolated from other people while you’re wearing it. In Apple’s photos, it looks like a big, bright screen that shows a video of your eyes to people around you so they feel comfortable talking to you while you’re wearing the headset — a feature adorably called EyeSight. In reality, it might as well not be there. It’s a low-res OLED with a lenticular panel in front of it to provide a mild 3D effect, and it’s so dim and the cover glass is so reflective, it’s actually hard to see in most normal to bright lighting. When people do see your eyes, it’s a low-res, ghostly image of them that feels like CGI. The effect is uncanny — the idea that you’ll be making real eye contact with anyone is a fantasy. And there are no controls or indicators in visionOS for this external display, so you never really know what other people are seeing. Imagine looking someone directly in the eyes and talking to them without knowing if they can see your eyes — it’s weird! EyeSight is so weird. So, so weird. Photo by Amelia Holowaty Krales / The Vergenone That cover glass hides a huge array of cameras and sensors. There’s a pair of high-res front cameras for the video passthrough, cameras that face down and to the sides to track your hands, a lidar scanner and TrueDepth cameras for spatial tracking, and infrared floodlights so everything can work in low light. Underneath all that, you’ve got an M2 processor and Apple’s new R1 spatial coprocessor and a pair of fans to move the heat from all this tech out the top. The fans were never perceptible during my time testing the Vision Pro, but the heat was: after long sessions, the headset was definitely warm. On the top edge, you’ll find what feel like larger versions of some familiar Apple Watch controls: a digital crown that adjusts both the volume and the level of virtual reality immersion on the right as you look through the headset and a button on the left that lets you take 3D photos and videos. You get two headbands in the box: the solo knit band and the dual loop band. They both attach and detach easily; you snap them right on and then pull the little orange tab to disconnect them. The solo band is unquestionably cooler and messes up your hair slightly less — but they both mess up your hair, so if the dual loop fits you better, just go with it. I found the solo loop much more comfortable; I also wish the mounting points were on the outside face so I could pull the band around my head and clip it on instead of constantly pulling it over my hair. The front of the Vision Pro is covered in cameras and sensors. Photo by Vjeran Pavic / The Vergenone The solo loop is by far the cooler strap. Photo by Amelia Holowaty Krales / The Vergenone The huge case costs an additional 199 and looks like a marshmallow from space. I love it. Photo by Amelia Holowaty Krales / The Vergenone The other two pieces are the light seal, which comes in various sizes, and the headband, which comes in two thicknesses. (You get fitted for these in the store or by scanning your head with an iPhone if you buy online.) Both attach magnetically, which means they also detach magnetically — you want to pick this thing up by the frame because grabbing it by the light seal can lead to disaster. If you have glasses, you can click in custom Zeiss lens inserts — Apple sent us reader lenses to see what that process looks like, but I just used the Vision Pro while wearing my soft contacts, and it was fine. The Vision Pro’s speakers are housed in the arms on the side, and they are good and loud and do a convincing job of rendering spatial audio. Things really sound like they are happening where they appear to be happening, which is a neat trick. The speakers are also pretty leaky, so everyone else around you can hear what you’re up to unless you use headphones. You can use any Bluetooth headphones you want, but you get a bunch of extra features if you use the latest AirPods Pro, like lower latency, lossless 48KHz audio, and Apple’s Adaptive Audio system, which automatically mixes in sound from the real world as appropriate. Since you’ll mostly experience the Vision Pro in there, the most noticeable thing about the hardware after a while is that it’s just… heavy. You’re supposed to wear this thing on your face for long stretches of computer time, and depending on which band and light seal you use, the headset alone weighs between 600 and 650 grams. I keep joking that the Vision Pro is an iPad for your face, but it’s heavier than an 11-inch iPad Pro (470 grams) and pushing close to a 12.9-inch iPad Pro (682 grams), so in a very real way, it’s an iPad for your face. All of the Vision Pro’s heft is totally front-loaded, too. Other big headsets like the Quest Pro (722 grams) have elaborate headbands to balance out their weight, but the Vision Pro just rests it all on the front. Swapping to the dual loop strap helps keep things more stable but doesn’t really reduce the overall sensation of having all that headset on your face. You’re just going to feel it after a while. The Vision Pro’s external battery pack is fine, mostly because it’s such a stationary device overall. Photo by Vjeran Pavic / The Vergenone Notably, the Vision Pro is substantially heavier than the familiar Quest 2 (503g) or even the heavier Quest 3 (515g) — headsets that have built-in batteries. Apple told me that it chose to use an external battery specifically to reduce the headset’s weight. The battery itself is barely worth talking about — it’s a silver brick that weighs another 353 grams with a USB-C port and a motion-activated LED that’s green when it’s charged and orange when it’s not. It connects to the headset with a satisfying twist connector, but the nice braided cable is permanently attached to the battery itself, so don’t break it. You can buy extra batteries for 199, but you can’t hot-swap them; disconnecting the battery from the Vision Pro cuts the power entirely. I don’t really have strong opinions on this battery setup, which is mostly because nothing about the Vision Pro feels like you’re supposed to move around that much in it, so it’s more or less fine. It’s funny that Apple of all companies shipped this compromise, but it’s also very Apple that the battery is not actually bigger so it can provide more than two and a half hours of run time. (If you plug the battery in, the Vision Pro just runs on wall power for as long as you want.) Setting up the Vision Pro is dead simple — the headband adjustments are the only manual adjustments involved. Everything else is motorized and sensor-driven. There’s no fiddly lens wheel to dial in; the headset asks you to hold down the digital crown when you first put it on to adjust the lenses to your eyes, and then you go through a pretty standard eye tracking setup. The rest of the setup is almost exactly like any other iOS device: if you have an iPhone, you can bring it close to the Vision Pro to send over all your settings, and you have to agree to some terms and conditions. If you don’t have an iPhone, you’ll have to enter your passwords and so on manually, but it’ll work fine as a standalone device. After all of that, you’re computing in the future. See? It’s a VR headset. Photo by Vjeran Pavic / The Vergenone Apple is very proud of the displays inside the Vision Pro, and for good reason — they represent a huge leap forward in display technology. The two displays are tiny MicroOLEDs with a total of 23 million pixels that are just 7.5 micrometers in size, which is about the size of a red blood cell. And each of those tiny pixels is composed of three RGB subpixels laid out in what Apple tells me is an S-stripe pattern. Just thinking about the level of precision required to make these displays and then make them work in a device like this is mind-blowing. They also look generally incredible — sharp enough to read text on without even thinking about it, bright enough to do justice to movies. Apple calibrates them for color at the factory so they are also vibrant and color-accurate without looking oversaturated or blown out. They are so small, but they work so well that they seem huge. The displays are the main reason the Vision Pro is so expensive — they’re at the heart of the Vision Pro experience and what makes the whole thing work. You are always looking at them, after all. But for all their technical marvels, they are not without tradeoffs of their own when deployed on a device like this. The speakers are nice and loud and convincing with spatial audio. Photo by Vjeran Pavic / The Vergenone See this thing — a passthrough VR headset with a silly external battery pack and a display that shows ghostly images of your eyes on the front — is not the big goal. The big goal is AR, or augmented reality. In particular, the big goal is optical AR, where light passes directly through unobtrusive glasses to your eyes, with digital information layered over the top of what you’re seeing. AR is a technology with the potential to literally change humanity, and Apple CEO Tim Cook has been talking about how isolating VR headsets are and how important he thinks AR will be for years now. Tim Cook, 2016: “Few people are going to view that it’s acceptable to be enclosed in something.” Tim Cook, 2017: “Unlike Virtual Reality which closes the world out, AR allows individuals to be present in the world.” Tim Cook, 2017: “I also like the fact that [AR] doesn’t isolate [...] I’ve never been a fan of VR like that because I think it does the opposite.” Tim Cook, 2020: “I think [AR is] something that doesn’t isolate people. We can use it to enhance our discussion, not substitute it for human connection, which I’ve always deeply worried about in some of the other technologies.” The problem is that the technology to build a true optical AR display that works well enough to replace an everyday computer just isn’t there yet. The Magic Leap 2 is an optical AR headset that’s cheaper and smaller than the Vision Pro, but it’s plagued by compromises in field of view and image quality that most people would never accept. So Apple’s settled for building a headset with real-time video passthrough — it is the defining tradeoff of the Vision Pro. It is a VR headset masquerading as an AR headset. And let me tell you: the video passthrough on the Vision Pro is really good. It works! It’s convincing. You put the headset on, the display comes on, and you’re right back where you were, only with a bunch of visionOS windows floating around. It sounds simple, but it is an astonishing engineering achievement to do that in real time, at high resolution, in a computer that fits over your eyes. Apple claims there’s only 12ms of latency between what the cameras see and what’s on the display, and that latency includes the exposure time of the cameras themselves. The actual data processing is faster. Do the math, and Apple says there’s not even a frame’s worth of latency; the next frame of video is ready before you’re done looking at the last one. Still cameras, still displays. Photo by Vjeran Pavic / The Vergenone You can also see Apple’s incredible video processing chops right in front of your eyes: I sat around scrolling on my phone while wearing the Vision Pro, with no blown-out screens or weird frame rate issues. I also worked on my Mac in front of a large window while wearing the headset, which is a torture test for dynamic range, and while it wasn’t perfect, it was still usable. It is the best video passthrough that’s ever shipped in a consumer device by far. The problem is that cameras are still cameras, and displays are still displays. All cameras have motion blur, for example. In low light, cameras either have to increase exposure times at the cost of sharpness or increase ISO at the cost of noise, which then requires noise reduction, which makes things blurry and dull. And cameras and displays both have real limits in terms of color reproduction. The Vision Pro cannot overcome the inherent nature of cameras and displays. You can easily see motion blur when you move your head in the Vision Pro — motion blur that increases in low light and leads to some weird warping of straight lines. Low light also causes the overall sharpness of the video passthrough to drop as noise reduction kicks in: my iPhone screen got noticeably blurrier when the sun set. If you’re in a medium-lit room halfway immersed in a dark virtual environment with a bright window open — say, sitting in your kitchen at night with the lights on while writing a review in a Google Docs window floating on a dark beach — you will notice the display brightness slowly ramp up and down as the system tries to average out the brightness of everything you’re looking at. The LCD clock on my microwave flickers when I look at it through these cameras. And Apple’s specs say the display supports 92 percent of the DCI-P3 color gamut, which means the Vision Pro can only show you 49 percent of the colors your eyes can actually see. The displays have other limitations: the field of view isn’t huge, and the essential nature of looking at tiny displays through lenses makes that field of view feel even smaller. Apple won’t tell me the exact number, but the Vision Pro’s field of view is certainly smaller than the Quest 3’s 110 horizontal degrees. That means there are fairly large black borders around what you’re seeing, a bit like you’re looking through binoculars. On top of that, there’s a little bit of distortion and vignetting around the edges of the lenses, and you’ll see some green and pink color fringing at the edges as well, especially in bright environments. All of this makes the usable field of view feel even smaller. If you’re looking at something bright or otherwise high contrast — a white text window floating above a dark desert landscape, for example — you’ll see highlights reflecting in the lenses. A screen capture from the Vision Pro and a simulated view of what it feels like to look in the headset. I asked Apple about all of this, and yep — that’s how it’s supposed to look. Apple spokesperson Jacqueline Roy told me that a combination of hardware and software in the Vision Pro is specifically designed to minimize these various effects, but they’re definitely in there, and you’ll see them. If you have been paying attention to VR for the past decade, you know that these are very familiar VR headset display issues. You’re passing light from a screen through lenses mounted on someone’s face and trying to line those lenses up with their eyes, which are notably in different spots on different people’s faces. (Our bodies are designed very badly when it comes to mounting hardware on them.) So a little weirdness at the edges of the displays is not a deal-breaker or even a surprise — except Apple is charging 3,499 for the Vision Pro and making it sound like these displays are perfect enough for you to casually wear this thing while folding laundry. I’m serious when I say the Vision Pro has the best video passthrough I’ve ever seen on the sharpest VR displays any normal person will ever come across. But you’re still constantly being reminded that you’re looking at video on screens, and reality is just a lot more interesting than that. There are vanishingly few contexts in reviewing consumer devices where anyone has to care about color gamuts — but if you want me to perceive reality through something, I’d like to see all the colors of the rainbow. This is the best anyone has ever made in there look, and it’s still not nearly as good as out here. Waiting. Watching. Ready to mess up your hair at a moment’s notice. Photo by Vjeran Pavic / The Vergenone Controls The other thing Apple is very proud of is the eye and hand tracking control system, which is light years beyond any other consumer hand or eye tracking systems out there. You look at things you want to control, you tap your fingers to control them, and that’s how you get around the entire interface. You’re not reaching out and touching things — it’s more like your eyes are the mouse, and your fingers are the button: you tap them together to click on what you’re looking at. The first few times you use hand and eye tracking on the Vision Pro, it’s awe-inspiring — it feels like a superpower. The Vision Pro’s external cameras just need to see your hands for it to work, and they can see your hands in a pretty large zone around your body. You can have them slung across the back of the couch, resting in your lap, up in the air with your elbows on a table, pretty much anywhere the cameras can see them. It actually takes a minute to realize you don’t have to gesture out in front of you with your hands in the air — and once you figure it out, it’s pretty fun to watch other people instinctively reach their hands up the first time they try the Vision Pro. But the next few times you use hand and eye tracking, it stops feeling like a superpower — and in some cases, it actively makes using the Vision Pro harder. It turns out that having to look at what you want to control is really quite distracting. Think about every other computer in your life: the input mechanism is independent of whatever you’re looking at. On a laptop, you can click on controls and use the keyboard while keeping your focus on a document. On a phone, you can do things like drag sliders in a photo editing app while keeping your eyes focused on what those changes are actually doing to your photo. The Vision Pro simply doesn’t work like that — you have to be looking at something in order to click on it, and that means you are constantly taking your attention away from whatever you’re working on to specifically look at the button you need to press next. I spent some time playing a lovely little game called Stitch that quickly became maddening because I kept looking away from the piece I wanted to move to the place I wanted to move it, which meant I wasn’t picking it up when I tapped my fingers. Reach out and touch faith. Photo by Vjeran Pavic / The Vergenone visionOS feels also designed for an eye tracking system that’s just slightly more precise than it actually is — a lot of controls are just a little too small and a little too close together to let you quickly bop around the system. You have to look, make sure you’re looking at the thing you want, and then tap, or you might end up clicking on the wrong thing. Sometimes the fastest way to select what you want is to look away entirely and try again. It works until it doesn’t. It’s magic until it’s not. Think about it like this: The keyboard and mouse on a Mac directly control the Mac. The click wheel on an iPod directly controlled the iPod. A lot of work has gone into making it feel like the multitouch screen on an iPhone directly controls the phone, and when it goes sideways, like when autocorrect fails or an app doesn’t register your taps, it’s not pleasant. Your eyes and hands aren’t directly controlling the Vision Pro: cameras are watching your eyes and hands and turning that into input, and sometimes the interpretation isn’t perfect. The best example of this is the hilarious on-screen keyboard, which you use by staring at each letter and pinching your fingers to select it or henpecking with two fingers at the floating keys in front of you. It’s not worth using for anything beyond entering a Wi-Fi password — for anything longer, you’ll want to use dictation or connect a Bluetooth keyboard. Why? So you can directly control the input. It’s not a given that the Vision Pro can always see your hands, either. There’s a pretty large bubble around the front of your body where the cameras can see your hands — it basically extends the length of your arms in a semicircle around the front of your body. But if you lean back in a chair with your arm at your side, it can’t see your hand. If you’re sitting at a table and your hands are on your legs, it might not see your hands. If you’re lying down in a dark room and the IR illuminators can’t reach your hands, the cameras might not be able to see them. If you’re simply standing up with your arms at your sides, it might not be able to see your hands if they drift too far backward. Photo by Vjeran Pavic / The Vergenone I recognize that it is fundamentally silly to complain about a hand tracking system needing to see your hands, and it is possible to navigate quite a lot of visionOS with Siri and dictation: you can manage apps, open different virtual immersions, and so on. If you squint, you can see a glimpse of how a computer that you use by talking to it and manipulating things in space might one day work. But right now, the limits are obvious. Using the Vision Pro makes you constantly aware of what you are looking at and where your hands are in a way that is unlike any other computer I’ve ever used. When it fails, it’s maddening. (Oddly, Apple’s newest watches can detect a pinching gesture, but there’s no ability to use those as control devices on the Vision Pro.) The flip side is that a system that’s constantly watching your hands for input tends to register a lot of extra inputs, which can be very funny. I talk through writing video scripts to make sure things flow, and I talk with my hands. So as I was writing the video script for this review in the Vision Pro, the system kept catching my hands moving and started scrolling and clicking on things by accident. I cracked up the first time I realized what was happening. But eventually, it meant that I took the Vision Pro off and wrote the rest of the script on my Mac, which only does things when I actually want it to. Just as with the displays, I think this is the best eye and hand tracking system anyone’s ever shipped. It really can feel like magic… until it doesn’t. And if you want people to do their computing in there, the input system needs to be absolutely rock solid. Personas I won’t go into that much detail on Apple’s deeply weird and extremely uncanny 3D persona system here — the best way to understand them is by watching the video review above, which features a FaceTime call between The Wall Street Journal’s Joanna Stern, Marques Brownlee, and me, all using our personas. To quote Marques, personas are really impressive and also really bad. You can see why Apple put the beta label on them; there’s a long way to go before using a persona on a call isn’t distracting at best and, at worst, extremely rude. I will say, Joanna’s persona accurately captured her reaction to personas in general here. Marques looks like he’s happy to welcome me into PlayStation Home. One small note: personas can show up whenever an app calls for a front-facing camera, so they work in basically everything. I used mine on a Google Meet call in Safari just fine, although the other people on the Meet call did not think it was fine at all. Spatial cameras I would not recommend shooting photos in the Vision Pro unless you really need to. Pressing the shutter button a single time delivers a 2560 x 2560 still, which works out to 6.5 megapixels. As far as I can tell, it’s always from the left main camera, which the EXIF data says has an 18mm f/2.0 lens. The photos look like 6.5-megapixel photos from a tiny camera sensor optimized for video, which is to say that they look pretty bad. Video is slightly better — the Vision Pro shoots 2200 x 2200 square videos at 30fps. They look a little better than the photos, but there’s still an awful lot of compression going on, and if you happen to watch them on anything but a Vision Pro, you’ll notice some barrel distortion as the camera moves around. None of this feels particularly important: I really can’t think of situations where I’d want to be taking video with the headset on since all these videos and screen captures come with a ton of excess motion from your head moving around. Also, you will look fundamentally ridiculous trying to take photos of your family with this thing on your face. I think it’s fair to assume most Vision Pro buyers also own iPhones, which take great videos, so whatever. One thing that is very convincing is taking spatial videos on the iPhone 15 Pro Max and watching them in 3D on the Vision Pro. I took some videos of my daughter at the zoo and around Christmas time, and like any dad, I could probably watch them over and over again forever. They play back in a sort of ghostly white haze, and the overall effect is incredibly bittersweet — you can relive a brief memory, but you’re alone in the headset and can’t share it with anyone else. The other problem is that, currently, you can choose to shoot iPhone video in spatial in 1080p at 30fps or at the full 4K resolution the phone supports but not both. For now, I’m going to stick with the higher-res video, but there’s going to come a time where shooting in spatial by default is the smart move, and that will be a real turning point. visionOS The Vision Pro runs visionOS, which Apple says is based on iPadOS, with a lot of customization around latency and vision to make it work for spatial computing. Starting with the iPad as a foundation represents an incredible head start for Apple — it’s taken years for Meta to build out all the features of the Android-based Quest OS and populate its app store, and it’s still mostly games. Apple gets to start with the full set of mature iPadOS features and most of the huge iPad app library. It’s funny to keep saying that the Vision Pro is an iPad for your face, but when it comes to the current set of apps, it’s also not totally wrong. Most of them work like iPad apps, and the homescreen comes preloaded with a folder labeled “compatible apps” that’s full of actual iPad apps. It’s hard to judge the app ecosystem for a product that has barely launched, but I feel totally comfortable judging the iPad app ecosystem at this point, and Apple shipping its own podcast and news apps as iPad apps on the Vision Pro feels like a sign in a lot of ways. Photo by Vjeran Pavic / The Vergenone There’s already controversy in the world of Vision Pro apps: some huge developers like Netflix, Spotify, and YouTube have decided to wait before allowing their apps to run on the Vision Pro and aren’t even allowing their iPad apps to run. As always, the open web serves as the pressure release valve for Apple developer politics, and Safari on the Vision Pro is a capable riff on iPad Safari: I watched Netflix in Safari and it worked without a hitch, although you can’t put the video in a nice environment like you can with the native apps. I also watched the NFL playoffs on YouTube TV in Safari on the Vision Pro, and it worked with a few minor hiccups, although it did keep asking me to confirm my location over and over again. The stranger thing is that Safari on the Vision Pro is pretty disconnected from web-based 3D experiences. Apple has made noise about supporting the WebXR standard, and there are flags in Safari’s advanced preferences to turn on support, but it’s pretty hit-or-miss in terms of actually working right now — it mostly does not. I asked about this, and Apple told me that it is actively contributing to WebXR and wants to “work with the community to help deliver great spatial computing experiences via the web.” So let’s give that one a minute and see how it goes. On the other hand, I asked Apple why the huge library of VR video on YouTube doesn’t work at all on the Vision Pro, and the company basically told me it wasn’t good enough to support, saying that “much of this content was created for devices that do not deliver a high-quality spatial experience” and that the company’s efforts were instead focused on “delivering the best spatial media experience possible including spatial photos and videos, Apple Immersive Video, and 3D movies available on Apple TV.” Translation: don’t hold your breath for YouTube VR support. Photo by Amelia Holowaty Krales / The Vergenone The really big difference between visionOS and iPadOS is that iPadOS has a lot of opinions about how you can arrange apps and how many apps you can run at a time, and visionOS is full-on free-floating window chaos. I love it. It is bananas. You can open as many apps as you want and put them anywhere you want in space. You can open windows in the kitchen, walk away from them and open some more in the living room, and then go back to the kitchen to find all your old windows waiting for you. Late one night, I made an art gallery of giant Safari windows in our office’s large open cafe area and walked around, looking at huge webpages for a while. I am telling you, it is wild. Sadly, visionOS doesn’t have any ability to share these windows or experiences with anyone else: two people in Vision Pro headsets sitting in the same room can’t see the same things floating in space at the same time. Apple tells me some enterprise developers are working on experiences with shared views, and you can mirror the view from one Vision Pro to another over FaceTime, but in the end, my big Safari art gallery only ever had one patron: me. It’s amazing you can do all of this, but it is also quite lonely to put things all over a space knowing no one else will ever really experience it. To move windows around, you just grab the bar at the bottom and put it wherever you want to in space. You can layer windows, you can put them directly above your head, you can put them on the floor — you can really just do whatever you want. To switch between them, you just look at the window you want and tap your fingers; inactive windows go slightly translucent, which means all kinds of things can be happening at once all over your space. On top of that, you can have apps from three different operating systems on-screen at the same time: native visionOS apps; iPad apps; and then you can also connect your Mac via Wi-Fi and have a whole Mac display with all the chaotic glory of macOS floating around in space. One area where visionOS has clear room to improve is window management. There’s no Exposé or Stage Manager to collect all your open windows in front of you or put them into preset arrangements, and the management that does exist is not exactly discoverable or intuitively laid out. You can tap and hold the X button in one app to hide all your other apps. If you want to hide everything, you double-click the digital crown on the headset itself. If you want to close all apps, you just ask Siri; if you want to quit a misbehaving app, you hold down the top button and the digital crown simultaneously to bring up a force quit window. It’s a lot of different ideas all at once. Once you figure out the moves, you can get around, but it takes a minute, and it means you’ll be thinking about window management more than any other iOS device I can think of and maybe even more than a Mac, which has four decades of window management ideas built into it. Photo by Amelia Holowaty Krales / The Vergenone Speaking of the Mac, I know a lot of people are excited about the idea of buying a Vision Pro just to put up giant virtual monitors. There’s good news and bad news about that. The good news is that Mac display sharing works really well, and Apple ecosystem tricks like Handoff and Continuity are pure magic in this context. You can copy on your Mac and paste in visionOS, and it just works. You can open your Mac display in visionOS and drag the mouse off the screen, and suddenly, your Mac’s keyboard and trackpad are controlling visionOS apps. It works just like it does between a Mac and an iPad. I found myself putting a virtual Mac display over my MacBook Pro’s screen and making it look like I had a 50-inch laptop to use Lightroom with — it’s awesome. There is a lot of very complicated display scaling going on behind the scenes here, but the easiest way to think about it is that you’re basically getting a 27-inch Retina display, like you’d find on an iMac or Studio Display. Your Mac thinks it’s connected to a 5K display with a resolution of 5120 x 2880, and it runs macOS at a 2:1 logical resolution of 2560 x 1440, just like a 5K display. (You can pick other resolutions, but the device warns you that they’ll be lower quality.) That virtual display is then streamed as a 4K 3560 x 2880 video to the Vision Pro, where you can just make it as big as you want. The upshot of all of this is that 4K content runs at a native 4K resolution — it has all the pixels to do it, just like an iMac — but you have a grand total of 2560 x 1440 to place windows in, regardless of how big you make the Mac display in space, and you’re not seeing a pixel-perfect 5K image. It is incredible that all of this works with just a single button click, but all that scaling complication also explains the bad news: you can only have a single Mac display in visionOS. You can’t have multiple Mac monitors floating in space. Maybe next time. Photo by Vjeran Pavic / The Vergenone One of the weirder things about visionOS (and the Vision Pro itself, really) is that there’s not a lot of true AR in the mix — as in, actual interaction between physical objects in your space and digital ones. After all these years of Apple talking about AR, I counted exactly three things in my entire time with the Vision Pro that offered a preview of the AR future. One: when you look at your Mac, the Vision Pro sometimes puts up a “connect display” button above it that starts screen sharing. Two: when you’re typing on a Bluetooth keyboard and look down at your hands, it puts a little text preview window above the keyboard so you can see what you’re typing. These are little features, yes, but they are some of the first true AR computing features that have ever shipped on a mainstream device, and they are an incredibly tantalizing glimpse of what might be possible. They also happen to be incredibly useful. The third AR thing I saw was the loading screen of Super Fruit Ninja, which allows you to throw a strawberry at a pig that’s running around on your floor. This seems slightly less historic. That’s more or less it. There’s not a lot of reality being augmented in the rest of visionOS. There’s an awful lot of what you might call mixed reality: virtual objects floating around in space with no connection to anything real. All those app windows floating around are doing so independently of the physical environment. And in the entertainment context, where Apple lets the Vision Pro fall back into being the VR headset it fundamentally is, it absolutely shines. Watching movies on the Vision Pro is a ton of fun, especially in the Apple TV app’s immersive movie theater that lets you pick where you want to sit. It’s also very cool to watch a movie in one of Apple’s virtual environments like Mount Hood and see the colors from the screen reflect onto the landscape or look around one of the Disney Plus environments like Avengers Tower. And movies themselves look great — the incredible quality of the Vision Pro’s displays is really obvious when you’re watching something. I watched far more of Top Gun: Maverick than I intended to just because it looked so good blown up to drive-in movie size, floating over a mountain. Photo by Amelia Holowaty Krales / The Vergenone Since the Vision Pro sends separate images to each eye, it can do true 3D movies — and Apple and its partners like Disney have already released quite a few. If you have a large Apple movie library, you get the 3D versions for free — you just choose 2D or 3D playback when you hit play. Apple is also making immersive versions of some of its Apple TV Plus shows, which basically means a 180ish-degree 3D video that feels like the best Google Cardboard demo of all time. I watched someone walk a tightrope in Adventure, and it was very convincing — but if you’ve never tried this before, I’d be careful that you get used to VR motion before diving into 3D videos. Apple has also promised immersive sports content, but sadly, I wasn’t able to try any of that yet. You can get pretty far making the argument that the Vision Pro is worth it simply as a very expensive TV — but after a while, the weight of it reminds you that this very nice TV is resting on your face. (I usually made it about 30 minutes to an hour before wanting a break.) It’s also a very expensive TV that doesn’t have HDMI inputs, so you’re limited to Apple’s gaming library, which feels deeply unfair. And unlike any other TV in your life, the Vision Pro can literally DRM your eyes — if you’re watching a movie in the Apple TV app or Disney Plus and go to take a screen capture, the content blacks out. It’s strange to experience a reality where big companies can block you from capturing what you see, even if all you’re trying to do is show people how cool it looks in a review. You can get around DRM screenshots on an iPhone by just taking a photo of the screen, but there’s no such off-ramp for the Vision Pro. Speaking of gaming, there aren’t any real VR games or fitness apps here — there’s nothing like Beat Saber or Red Matter or Population: One, all hit games on the Quest. Fitness, in particular, has helped the Quest reach a more mainstream market: Supernatural’s Chris Milk told me in 2021 that his user base is 50 / 50 men and women, 60 percent of whom are over 40. That led to Meta buying Supernatural outright because it was worried about Apple buying it first. Yet, there’s just nothing like that on the Vision Pro at launch, even though Apple is so focused on fitness and health across its other devices. I think it’s because the Vision Pro just doesn’t seem suited to those kinds of physical game experiences — it’s heavy, with that external battery, and it’s hard to see how some of these games would even work without controllers. Apple tells me that game developers working in Unity are hard at work porting over more games and that visionOS allows developers to come up with custom hand gestures, which might solve for some of the controller issues — I was able to try a prerelease version of Super Fruit Ninja that used a custom slashing gesture in a briefing, and it seemed to work well, but that was about it so far. One note about VR motion in the Vision Pro: it doesn’t really do anything to protect you from yourself. I am fairly comfortable in VR — my wife and I use Supernatural, and I went through a brief, delightful period of being absolutely addicted to Gran Turismo 7 VR on the PSVR 2. I am pretty aware of my limits in VR motion, and I can do most things without a problem. But the Vision Pro is so convincing and so unconcerned with whether you might have any limits that you can easily go too far too fast and get yourself a little queasy. I watched five minutes of Avatar: The Way of Water in 3D in Disney Plus — the Vision Pro is the first consumer device to support high frame rate movies in 3D! — and immediately needed to stop because the motion was just too much. I recommend early adopters go slowly and make sure you find your limits gently. That first bout of VR motion sickness is no joke. Wrap up The Vision Pro is an astounding product. It’s the sort of first-generation device only Apple can really make, from the incredible display and passthrough engineering, to the use of the whole ecosystem to make it so seamlessly useful, to even getting everyone to pretty much ignore the whole external battery situation. There’s a part of me that says the Vision Pro only exists because Apple is so incredibly capable, stocked with talent, and loaded with resources that the company simply went out and engineered the hell out of the hardest problems it could think of in order to find a challenge. That’s good! There are a lot of ideas in the Vision Pro, and they’re all executed with the kind of thoughtful intention that few other companies can ever deliver at all, let alone on the first iteration. But the shocking thing is that Apple may have inadvertently revealed that some of these core ideas are actually dead ends — that they can’t ever be executed well enough to become mainstream. This is the best video passthrough headset ever made, and that might mean camera-based mixed reality passthrough could just be a road to nowhere. This is the best hand- and eye-tracking ever, and it feels like the mouse, keyboard, and touchscreen are going to remain undefeated for years to come. There is so much technology in this thing that feels like magic when it works and frustrates you completely when it doesn’t. Photo by Amelia Holowaty Krales / The Vergenone The other way to look at the Vision Pro is that Apple knows all of this, but the technology to build the true AR glasses it has long hinted at is simply not there — so the Vision Pro represents something like a simulator or a developer kit. A dream factory for people to build apps and meaningful use cases for the imagined hardware yet to come: true optical AR glasses that let you share digital experiences with other people. In that framework, this Vision Pro is the hardware Apple can ship right now to get everyone thinking about these ideas while it pours all those resources into the hardware it wants to build. Maybe! It’s fun to think about that possibility, and a lot of people have already assumed that’s the case. But one of the oldest rules we have here at The Verge is that you have to review what’s in the box — the product that’s shipping today, not the promise of improvements yet to come. And so I keep coming back to all the questions I’ve been asking myself ever since I first strapped the Vision Pro onto my head. Starting, of course, with the most important: Do you want a computer that messes up your hair every time you use it? Do you want a computer that smears your makeup every time you use it, if you wear makeup? Do you want a computer that allows the Walt Disney Company to prevent you from taking pictures of what you see? Do you want to use a computer where you easily can’t show anyone else what you’re looking at? Do you think the fanciest TV you own should have HDMI inputs? Do you want to use a computer that doesn’t work as well in a dark room? Do you want to use a computer that is always looking at your hands? That is a lot of tradeoffs — big tradeoffs, not little ones. And the biggest tradeoff of all is that using the Vision Pro is such a lonely experience, regardless of the weird ghost eyes on the front. You’re in there, having experiences all by yourself that no one else can take part in. After using the Vision Pro for a while, I’ve come to agree with what Tim Cook has been saying for so long: headsets are inherently isolating. That’s fine for traditional VR headsets, which have basically turned into single-use game consoles over the past decade, but it’s a lot weirder for a primary computing device. I don’t want to get work done in the Vision Pro. I get my work done with other people, and I’d rather be out here with them.","output":"애플 비전 프로, 최고급 헤드셋이지만 무겁고 높은 가격(3,499). 실제보다 화면을 통해 보는 경험이며, 현실과 동떨어진 경험 제공."},{"instruction":"PROODREAD OR REWRITE: Mino is an office lady who rides daily the commute train.

Like Google's text-to-video tool Lumiere, Sora's availability is limited. Unlike Lumiere, Sora can generate videos up to 1 minute long. Text-to-video has become the latest arms race in generative AI as OpenAI, Google, Microsoft and more look beyond text and image generation and seek to cement their position in a sector projected to reach 1.3 trillion in revenue by 2032 -- and to win over consumers who've been intrigued by generative AI since ChatGPT arrived a little more than a year ago. Strengths One thing that may set Sora apart is its ability to interpret long prompts -- including one example that clocked in at 135 words. The sample video OpenAI shared on Thursday demonstrate Sora can create a variety of characters and scenes, from people and animals and fluffy monsters to cityscapes, landscapes, zen gardens and even New York City submerged underwater.This is thanks in part to OpenAI's past work with its Dall-E and GPT models. Text-to-image generator Dall-E 3 was released in September. CNET's Stephen Shankland called it \\"a big step up from Dall-E 2 from 2022.\\" (OpenAI's latest AI model, GPT-4 Turbo, arrived in November.) In particular, Sora borrows Dall-E 3's recaptioning technique, which OpenAI says generates \\"highly descriptive captions for the visual training data.\\"Weaknesses OpenAI conceded Sora has weaknesses, like struggling to accurately depict the physics of a complex scene and to understand cause and effect. \\"For example, a person might take a bite out of a cookie, but afterward, the cookie may not have a bite mark,\\" the post said.","output":"Exciting news in the world of #GenerativeAI!

Imagine your words crafting scenes with dynamic characters, bustling cityscapes, and serene landscapes. Thanks to the groundwork laid by Dall-E and GPT models, Sora stands out by generating videos that capture a rich tapestry of visual stories, all from a simple text description.

A protein shake that can literally power through a marathon? Klaus flashes a small, proud smile, as he reveals his perplexing choice of ingredients—beef, a brick, and a bottle of Tabasco sauce. He carefully places each item into the blender. KLAUS We need to test the full capabilities of this machine. Today, I’ve created a blend that pushes the limits. I call it, the \\"Pure Power Smoothie.\\" Thomas stifles a laugh, as Arthur raises an eyebrow, both eye the brick skeptically. ARTHUR (Cockily) If it can blend a brick, it can handle my mother’s meatloaf. The crowd murmurs in a mix of astonishment and disgust as Klaus, with a nod of finality, flips a custom-made switch. The engine ROARS to life, causing everyone to flinch, while the blender vibrates violently. After a moment that feels like a small eternity, Klaus turns it off. He pours the resulting \\"smoothie\\" into a glass, which looks as threatening as the noise it was borne from. KLAUS (With scientific curiosity) Who would like the honor of the first taste? THOMAS (Excited but hesitant) I love muscle cars, but I’m not sure I want one in my digestive tract… Arthur, ever the show-off, grabs the glass with a smirk. ARTHUR (With a rebellious twinkle) For science and glory, my friends! He sips the gritty, smoky concoction and almost immediately his face contorts into a mixture of horror and regret. The crowd waits with bated breath. ARTHUR (After a dramatized pause) Klaus, my man, you’ve outdone yourself. This is... He pauses dramatically, searching for the right words. ARTHUR …the Bloody Awful. The crowd erupts in a mixture of laughter and applause as Arthur theatrically gags, handing the glass back to Klaus who takes notes, seemingly unfazed by the taste-test reaction. THOMAS (Still laughing) You know, Klaus, maybe stick to less... Mustang-powered recipes in the future. KLAUS Perhaps. But the results are note-worthy. Efficiency and horsepower blend together, quite literally. ARTHUR (Banteringly) Right, and next time maybe add some motor oil for a smoother finish, eh? The three friends share a laugh as the crowd continues to chuckle, and though clapping for the sheer absurdity of the scene, they can't help but admire the audacity and the camaraderie of the three maverick university researchers.

Please rewrite properly","output":"Subject: Request for Adjustment to GM Cost Forecast (20/02/2024 - 19/03/2024) Dear [Recipient's Name/Finance Team], I hope this message finds you well. I would like to bring to your attention an important matter concerning our budget forecasting and cash flow management. We have observed that there is a consistent discrepancy between our forecasted General Management (GM) costs and the actual payouts. The actual expenses have been significantly lower than our projected figures for several consecutive months. This overestimation of GM costs is leading to an excess of unutilized funds within our accounts, resulting in cash being tied up unnecessarily. This not only impacts the efficiency of our fund management but also places an undue burden on our cashiers who must navigate the complexities of a tighter cash flow than needed. In light of this, I kindly request that we conduct a thorough review of the GM cost forecasts to adjust our projections more accurately. Our goal is to enhance the efficiency of our fund allocation, ensuring that surplus cash can be strategically utilized or invested rather than remaining idle. To facilitate this, may I suggest that we: 1. Analyze the past few months' discrepancies between estimated GM costs and actual payouts to understand the root causes of the overestimations. 2. Engage with the relevant department heads to gather insights and validate the assumptions used in our forecasting models. 3. Adjust our forecasting methods to better align with historical spending patterns, incorporating a buffer that reflects reasonable variability without overinflating the budgeted amounts. By refining our cost-forecasting approach, we can improve our financial planning and optimize operational cash flow. This will empower our cashiers to manage funds more effectively and reduce the pressure stemming from overestimated budgets. Please let us know if a meeting is required to discuss this further or if additional data is needed. Your cooperation in this matter is greatly appreciated, and I am confident that together we can address this issue promptly. Thank you for your attention to this matter. I look forward to our continued collaboration to enhance the financial efficacy of our operations.

Lo más probable es que se trate de ACL (Access Control List), que no es una funcionalidad nativa de Mongoose, sino un concepto de control de acceso en sistemas de computación. Mongoose es una biblioteca de modelado de objetos para MongoDB y Node.js que facilita la interacción con la base de datos a través de esquemas y modelos. No ofrece directamente un sistema ACL, pero puedes implementar control de acceso en tu aplicación usando Mongoose junto con otras bibliotecas o patrones de diseño. Algunas opciones para manejar control de acceso en aplicaciones Node.js que usan Mongoose son: 1. **Casl**: Es una librería de JavaScript para implementar ACL. A pesar del error en la nomenclatura inicial, CASL puede ser la librería que necesitas si buscas un sistema de control de acceso para tu aplicación. Puede ser integrado fácilmente con cualquier framework de Node.js, incluyendo Express, Koa, etc. 2. **Accesscontrol**: Esta biblioteca proporciona un simple y flexible sistema de control de acceso basado en roles, donde puedes definir roles y permisos que están asociados con esos roles. Puedes definir reglas para cada modelo en Mongoose y luego verificar si un usuario tiene acceso antes de realizar una operación en la base de datos. 3. **Rolify + Cancan (Ruby on Rails)**: Aunque no es para Node.js, se menciona porque podría ser una fuente de inspiración para tu propio sistema de control de acceso en Node.js. Rolify se utiliza para asignar roles a usuarios y Cancan para verificar los permisos. 4. **Propio middleware de Express**: Puedes escribir tu propio sistema de control de acceso en Node.js usando middleware de Express. Esto te permite tener control total sobre las reglas y la lógica de acceso, pero también significa que tendrás que manejar todos los casos específicos y la lógica manualmente. 5. **Passport**: Aunque Passport.js es principalmente un middleware de autenticación, puedes usarlo en combinación con otras técnicas para restringir el acceso a ciertos recursos. Esto sería más un sistema de autenticación, el cual puedes extender para incluir niveles de acceso y roles. 6. **node_acl**: Una biblioteca de control de acceso basada en nodos para Node.js que usa backends como memoria o MongoDB para almacenar las reglas ACL. Para cualquiera de estas opciones necesitarás crear tus propias reglas y lógica para vincularlas con los modelos y operaciones de Mongoose en tu aplicación Node.js. Es importante elegir una estrategia que encaje bien con el diseño y los requerimientos de tu aplicación web."},{"instruction":"puede prisma.io hacer Aggregation como Mongoose","output":"Prisma es un ORM (Object Relational Mapper) moderno que facilita el trabajo con bases de datos en aplicaciones Node.js y TypeScript. Prisma proporciona un conjunto de herramientas, incluyendo Prisma Client, que permite realizar consultas y operaciones en la base de datos de manera segura y eficiente. Al igual que Mongoose, que es una librería de modelado de objetos diseñada específicamente para MongoDB, Prisma ofrece soporte para operaciones de agregación. Sin embargo, Prisma es un poco más amplio en su alcance ya que no está limitado solo a MongoDB; también es compatible con bases de datos SQL como PostgreSQL, MySQL, SQLite, y SQL Server. Con Prisma, puedes realizar operaciones de agregación utilizando Prisma Client en distintas bases de datos compatibles. Por ejemplo, puedes contar, sumar, promediar, obtener el valor mínimo y máximo, etc. A continuación, se muestra un ejemplo de cómo se realizaría una operación de agregación con Prisma Client: \`\`\`javascript const { PrismaClient } = require('@prisma/client'); const prisma = new PrismaClient(); async function main() { const result = await prisma.model.aggregate({ _count: { _all: true, }, _avg: { field: true, }, _sum: { field: true, }, _min: { field: true, }, _max: { field: true, }, where: { // Tus criterios de filtrado aquí }, }); console.log(result); } main() .catch((e) => { throw e; }) .finally(async () => { await prisma.disconnect(); }); \`\`\` En el código anterior, \`model\` debe reemplazarse con el modelo real de tu base de datos que se define en tu esquema de Prisma. Asimismo, \`field\` es el campo específico del modelo en el que deseas realizar la operación de agregación. Las operaciones de agregación se especifican indicando el tipo de agregado que deseas realizar (por ejemplo, \`_count\`, \`_avg\`, \`_sum\`, \`_min\`, \`_max\`). Así, Prisma ofrece un enfoque más unificado y generalizado para trabajar con bases de datos, incluyendo la capacidad de realizar operaciones de agregación. Esto significa que si estás trabajando con MongoDB y estás familiarizado con las operaciones de agregación en Mongoose, podrás realizar tareas similares con Prisma si decides usarlo en su lugar o además de Mongoose."},{"instruction":"puedo acceder a consultas raw en prisma.io para hacer consultas Aggregation con MongoDB?","output":"A partir de la última actualización de mi conocimiento en marzo de 2023, Prisma no ofrece una compatibilidad oficial con MongoDB. Prisma fue diseñado principalmente para trabajar con bases de datos SQL como PostgreSQL, MySQL, MariaDB, SQLite y SQL Server, y aunque han existido discusiones y solicitudes para el soporte de MongoDB, esto no se había implementado de forma oficial hasta ese punto. Dado que Prisma tiene como objetivo brindar un acceso tipo ORM con muchas comodidades y abstracciones sobre las consultas de bases de datos, si eventualmente Prisma llegara a soportar MongoDB, es probable que proporcionara alguna forma de realizar consultas de agregación similares a las de Mongoose, las cuales son una parte fundamental de la funcionalidad de MongoDB. Sin embargo, en las bases de datos SQL compatibles con Prisma, si necesitas realizar una consulta que no está soportada directamente por Prisma Client, puedes recurrir a una funcionalidad conocida como \\"consultas Raw\\". Con las consultas Raw, puedes ejecutar comandos SQL directamente en tu base de datos a través de Prisma.

Mongoose permite el acceso a la funcionalidad completa de la pipeline de agregación de MongoDB con su API \`Model.aggregate()\`, la cual es poderosa y flexible para consultas complejas.

Теперь давайте пошагово разберем выражение: ((x ≡ y) → (¬z ∨ w)) ≡ ¬ ((w → x) ∨ (y → z)) Сначала разберем импликации и дизъюнкции в скобках: 1. (x ≡ y) – истинно, когда x и y равны. 2. (¬z ∨ w) – истинно, когда z ложно или w истинно. 3. (w → x) – истинна, когда w ложно или x истинно. 4. (y → z) – истинна, когда y ложно или z истинно. Сейчас наше выражение выглядит так: (а → b) ≡ ¬ (c ∨ d) где: - а = (x ≡ y) - b = (¬z ∨ w) - c = (w → x) - d = (y → z) Теперь построим дизъюнкцию (c ∨ d) и отрицание этой дизъюнкции ¬ (c ∨ d): - (c ∨ d) – истинна, когда либо c истинно, либо d истинно. - ¬ (c ∨ d) – истинно, когда и c, и d одновременно ложны. Теперь у нас есть: (а → b) ≡ ¬e где e = (c ∨ d). Теперь разберем импликацию (а → b): - а → b – истинна, если а ложно или b истинно. И наконец, вычислим эквивалентность для всего выражения: - (а → b) ≡ ¬e – это утверждение истинно, когда а → b и ¬e либо оба истинны, либо оба ложны. Теперь, чтобы полностью проанализировать эту функцию F, необходима таблица истинности, где рассмотрены все возможные комбинации значений переменных x, y, z, w. Таким образом, можно определить, при каких условиях выражение истинно (равно 1) или ложно (равно 0)."},{"instruction":"Логическая функция F задаётся выражением: ((x ≡ y) → (¬z ∨ w)) ≡ ¬ ((w → x) ∨ (y → z)).","output":"Для анализа данной логической функции F, рассмотрим её части и обозначения операций: - \\"≡\\" обозначает эквивалентность (логическое равенство); - \\"→\\" обозначает импликацию (если ..., то ...); - \\"¬\\" обозначает отрицание (не ...); - \\"∨\\" обозначает дизъюнкцию (логическое ИЛИ). - \\"∧\\" обозначает конъюнкцию (логическое И). Теперь давайте шаг за шагом разберем, как устроена данная логическая функция F: 1. Подвыражение (x ≡ y) означает, что x равно y по значению: если x - истина, то y тоже должно быть истиной, и наоборот. 2. Подвыражение (¬z ∨ w) означает, что истинно либо не z (то есть z - ложь), либо w (то есть w - истина), или оба вместе. 3. Подвыражение (w → x) означает, что если w - истина, то и x должно быть истиной. 4. Подвыражение (y → z) означает, что если y - истина, то и z должно быть истиной. 5. Подвыражение ((w → x) ∨ (y → z)) означает, что истинно либо первое выражение (w → x), либо второе (y → z), либо оба одновременно. 6. Наконец, подвыражение ¬((w → x) ∨ (y → z)) означает отрицание всего, о чем говорится в пункте 5, то есть чтобы это выражение было истинным, ((w → x) ∨ (y → z)) должно быть ложным. Теперь посмотрим на весь логический оператор F: F = ((x ≡ y) → (¬z ∨ w)) ≡ ¬((w → x) ∨ (y → z)). Это выражение утверждает, что два подвыражения по обеим сторонам от эквивалентности равнозначны. То есть, когда одно истинно, другое тоже должно быть истинным и наоборот. Для полного анализа функции F нужно составить таблицу истинности, рассматривая все возможные комбинации значений переменных x, y, z, и w.

Setting is an important aspect of any game, especially in the horror genre where atmosphere plays a huge role in creating suspense and fear. Feel free to share the details of your game's setting – whether it's an eerie abandoned mansion, a creepy forest, a desolate town, or something else entirely. I'm interested to hear about the world you're building, the backstory, the environmental elements, and any other details you think contribute to the horror experience."},{"instruction":"The setting takes place in Norway in a big village in the winter. The game takes place somewhere around the 50s or 60s. The game takes place both during the day and at night.","output":"The setting you've chosen for your horror game has a lot of potential to create a deeply atmospheric environment that can enhance the sense of dread and tension. Here are some ideas to consider for your setting: 1. **Norwegian Village**: The choice of a Norwegian village immediately invokes the imagery of remote, snow-covered landscapes, which can be both beautiful and isolating. The sense of isolation can increase the horror elements, as players may feel there's nowhere to escape to for help. 2. **Winter Setting**: The harshness of winter can be used to great effect in horror. Snowstorms can limit visibility, muffle sounds, and alter the landscape, making navigation challenging. The cold can be a persistent enemy itself, creating a need for shelter and warmth, adding a survival element to your game. 3. **Historical Time Period**: Setting the game in the '50s or '60s creates a world without modern technology, which can strip away potential safety nets for the player such as cell phones or GPS, exacerbating the fear of being cut off. This time frame can also influence the architectural styles, vehicles, and general aesthetic of the game, along with social norms and available resources. 4. **Day and Night Cycles**: Having both daytime and nighttime in your game allows for a dynamic range of horror experiences. The daytime might offer a false sense of security, allowing players to explore and gather resources with better visibility, while the night could be fraught with increased threats and psychological terror. The transition between day and night can also build tension as players anticipate the dangers that come with darkness. 5. **Local Folklore and Mythology**: Norway has a rich tradition of folklore and myth. You can incorporate elements of Norse mythology, local legends, or supernatural creatures into your horror narrative to give your game unique regional flavor and a deep well of story material. 6. **Environmental Storytelling**: The village itself can have a backstory that unfolds as the player explores. Abandoned homes, forsaken belongings, and environmental clues can tell the stories of the villagers who once lived there. This can create a narrative that the player pieces together, leading to revelations about the horror they face. 7. **Sound Design**: Utilizing a soundscape that includes howling winds, creaking wood from the settlement structures, and the distant sounds of wildlife can enhance immersion. During the night, the absence of sounds or the unexpected noise can significantly increase tension. 8. **Cultural and Societal Elements**: The norms of the 50s/60s era in Norway could play into the game's mechanics and story. Perhaps there are remnants of historical events or the villagers were involved in certain rituals or lifestyles that now impact the horror that unfolds. As you develop this setting, consider how each aspect can serve the horror narrative and gameplay. Think about what is lurking in the shadows, what secrets the village holds, and how the environment interacts with the player. Keep building that sense of dread and unease, using the setting as a character in itself that can surprise, trap, or mislead the player at every turn. I'm looking forward to hearing how your horror game's setting develops!"},{"instruction":"Interesting characters in this game include: A tall vampire lady who works as a gardener for a big castle. A merchant with a cold. Technoviking if he listened to whatever was popular during the 50s or 60s. Frankenstein's Monster after 3 weeks in Denmark. The Grimm Brothers if they had a 3rd brother and also they were vampires. Some German sniper from World War II who sits up the clocktower in the castle sniping wild animals and birds.","output":"These character concepts offer a diverse and intriguing mix that can create a multi-layered narrative for your horror game. Let's break them down a bit and consider how they could be integrated into the game's world: 1. **Tall Vampire Lady Gardener**: This character is reminiscent of classic Gothic horror. Positioned in a big castle, she may play a dual role as both an antagonist and a possible source of information about the castle's dark history. Her role as a gardener gives her a connection to the land, and perhaps her botanical knowledge plays into the game's puzzles or mechanics. Her towering presence can be visually imposing, adding to the player's sense of intimidation. 2. **Merchant with a Cold**: A sick merchant lends a sense of normalcy and humanity to the setting, while his cold can also serve as a plot device. Maybe he needs medication that the player must find, or his sneezes and coughs provide auditory cues in gameplay. His wares might be essential for the player's survival, yet his sickness suggests vulnerability and the potential for an untimely fate. 3. **Technoviking from the Past**: Remixing a modern meme with a historical setting offers both a humorous and eerie touch. This character could represent the town’s oddball, dancing through the streets to period-appropriate music. His presence could clash with the more somber setting of the game, creating a dissonance that may serve to put players on edge. 4. **Frankenstein's Monster in Denmark**: This character, having spent time in Denmark, could play into the notion of a wandering creature seeking solace or perhaps escaping a haunting past. His transformation over the weeks might have made him more eloquent or more monstrous, providing either an ally or a new terror in the village. 5. **Vampire Grimm Brothers and Their Third Sibling**: The idea of the Grimm brothers as vampires with an additional, perhaps less known brother, adds gothic layers to the story. They might be the keepers of lore and ancient tales that are essential to understanding the horrors plaguing the village, or perhaps their own dark narratives tied to their vampirism and rivalry. 6. **German WWII Sniper**: This character adds a historical dimension to your game, indicating that the echoes of the war still linger in the village. As a sniper who targets wildlife, he could represent a threat if he misconstrues the player as a target or provide aid if his sharpshooting skills become necessary to the player's survival. His presence in the clock tower gives him a strategic viewpoint, potentially affecting how the player navigates the environment. These characters could all have their own backstories, motivations, and connections to the central mystery of the game. As you flesh them out, consider how they interact with one another and the environment. Are they remnants of the past who can't let go, or active participants in the current horrors? How do their stories interconnect, and how will they change as the player unravels the dark secrets of the Norwegian village? Creating a rich tapestry of characters will enhance the depth of your game world and keep players engaged as they encounter each unique individual. Whether friend, foe, or something in-between, these characters can transform the game environment into a vivid stage for your horror narrative."},{"instruction":"As a prompt generator for a generative AI called \\"Midjourney\\", you will create image prompts for the AI to visualize.

Ты: Работа (A) силы вычисляется по следующей формуле:<br/><br/>[ A = F cdot s cdot cos(alpha) ]<br/><br/>где:<br/>- ( F ) — сила, действующая на тело,<br/>- ( s ) — путь, на который сила перемещает тело,<br/>- ( alpha ) — угол между направлением силы и направлением перемещения.<br/><br/>В данной задаче тело поднимается вертикально вверх, что означает, что угол между силой, прилагаемой для поднятия тела (сила тяжести противоположно направлена движению), и направлением перемещения равен 0 градусов. Косинус угла в 0 градусов равен 1. Следовательно, можно упростить формулу до следующего вида:<br/><br/>[ A = F cdot s ]<br/><br/>Теперь вставим численные значения:<br/><br/>[ A = 45 , text{Н} cdot 3 , text{м} = 135 , text{Дж} ]<br/><br/>Итак, работа, совершенная при подъёме тела массой 2 кг на высоту 3 м под действием силы 45 Н, составляет 135 Дж (джоулей). Пользователь: положение о нематериальном стимулировании предприятия Ты: Нематериальное стимулирование на предприятии может включать в себя различные методы и подходы, направленные на повышение мотивации и удовлетворенности работников.

Примеры нематериального стимулирования могут включать:<br/><br/>1. Карьерный рост: предоставление шансов на продвижение по службе и профессиональное развитие.<br/>2. Публичное признание: выражение благодарности и признание заслуг сотрудника на встречах коллектива или во внутрикорпоративных изданиях.<br/>3. Гибкий график работы: возможность выбора рабочего времени или возможность работы из дома.<br/>4. Обучение и развитие: курсы повышения квалификации, тренинги, семинары, мастер-классы.<br/>5. Улучшение условий труда: создание комфортабельной рабочей среды, инвестирование в современное оборудование и оргтехнику.<br/>6. Корпоративная культура: создание сильных корпоративных ценностей и стремление к их соблюдению.<br/>7. Система наград: награды за достижение целей и выполнение проектов, которые могут быть как символическими, так и практичными (например, дополнительные дни отпуска).<br/><br/>Внедрение таких мер направлено на то, чтобы сотрудник чувствовал свою значимость для компании, видел возможности роста и развития внутри организации и не чувствовал разочарования только из-за отсутствия финансовой мотивации. Эффективная система нематериального стимулирования помогает привлечь и удержать талантливых работников. Пользователь: Сравните два разных философских представления о смысле красоты Ты: В истории философии существуют различные взгляды на смысл красоты. Для сравнения можно взять представления античной философии и представления, выраженные в философии Просвещения.<br/><br/>Античная философия (Платон):<br/>Для Платона, красота не была свойством предмета как такового, а отражением идеальных форм, существующих в небесном мире идей. Физическая красота считалась лишь бледным отражением вечной и непреходящей красоты идеальных форм. В “Симпозиуме” Платон через персонажа Диотиму рассказывает о восхождении души к истинному познанию красоты. Таким образом, красота в античной философии имеет метафизическое значение и связана с моральными и интеллектуальными аспектами.<br/><br/>Философия Просвещения (Иммануил Кант):<br/>Кант в своей “Критике способности суждения” подходил к вопросу красоты с критической точки зрения. Кант отделял суждения о красоте от суждений о приятном и хорошем. Красота, по мнению Канта, связана с бескорыстным и безынтересным удовольствием. Для него, красота в вещах зависит от способности суждения наблюдателя, которое является субъективным, но в то же время претендует на универсальное согласие. Красота, согласно Канту, не имеет цели и не зависит от понятий, она вызывает удовольствие при созерцании и такое суждение о красоте является чистым эстетическим суждением.<br/><br/>Таким образом, античная философия видит красоту как отражение высшего порядка идеальных форм, в то время как философия Просвещения выбирает более субъективный, но универсально применимый подход. Античная философия подчеркивает вечное значение красоты, в то время как подход Просвещения акцентирует внимание на восприятии индивида и непосредственной эстетической реакции. Запрос пользователя (отвечай только на него, всё, что сказано выше, это только контекст): Упростите: Sin4B:cos2B","output":"Для упрощения выражения Sin4B:cos2B, используем тождество тригонометрии, которое позволяет выразить синус двойного угла через косинус: sin(2α) = 2sin(α)cos(α). Также нам известно, что cos(2α) = cos^2(α) - sin^2(α). Попробуем применить первое тождество и увидеть, можно ли упростить данное выражение, предполагая, что B это угол α: sin(4B) = sin(2 * 2B) = 2sin(2B)cos(2B). Теперь у нас есть выражение для sin(4B), и мы можем упростить исходное соотношение: Sin4B:cos2B = (2sin(2B)cos(2B)) / cos2B = 2sin(2B). Поскольку sin(2B) = 2sin(B)cos(B), мы можем продолжить упрощение: 2sin(2B) = 2 * 2sin(B)cos(B) = 4sin(B)cos(B). Итак, упрощенное выражение будет: Sin4B:cos2B = 4sin(B)cos(B)."},{"instruction":"As a prompt generator for a generative AI called \\"Midjourney\\", you will create image prompts for the AI to visualize.

Charities often rely on small denomination coins, like pennies, as they are a common form of donation from the public. Here are some potential measures to help charities adapt: 1. **Round-Up Programs**: Retailers can offer customers the option to round up their purchase to the nearest dollar as a donation to charity. This can be an effective way to replace the small change that would have been given if pennies were still in circulation. 2. **Digital Donations**: Encouraging the use of digital platforms for donations can help transition people from giving physical coins to making electronic contributions. Creating easy and accessible ways for people to donate through smartphones, apps, or online can offset the loss of penny donations. 3. **Coin Exchange Initiatives**: Charities could partner with banks or financial institutions to provide coin exchange services where larger amounts of pennies can be exchanged for other currency forms before they are fully phased out. 4. **Educational Campaigns**: Educate the public about the elimination of the penny and the impact on charities, encouraging them to donate in other ways, such as through spare change or rounding up programs. 5. **Collection Points**: Establish new collection points in high traffic areas like malls, stores, and community centers to collect other forms of spare change. 6. **Recycling Programs**: Implement a penny recycling program where pennies can be collected and sold for their metal value, with proceeds going to charities. 7. **Membership/Subscription Models**: Encourage regular giving through the development of membership or subscription models where individuals commit to giving a small amount regularly, directly from their bank account. 8. **Incentivize Donations**: Government or private sector can offer incentives, such as tax breaks or matching donation programs, to encourage bigger and more frequent contributions to charities. 9. **Change Dispensing Machines**: In places where cash is still used frequently, such as supermarkets and public transit, machines could dispense change in denominations other than pennies, encouraging people to donate the spare change. Each of these measures would require close collaboration between charities, financial institutions, and government bodies to be effectively implemented. With proper planning and communication, the impact on charities from the abolition of the penny could be minimized or even turned into an opportunity for modernizing donation methods."},{"instruction":"Does the abolishment of pennies hurt low-incoming families","output":"The abolition of pennies can have nuanced impacts on low-income families. On one hand, it could potentially have some negative consequences: 1. **Rounded Prices**: If cash transactions are rounded to the nearest 5 or 10 cents, there could be a slight increase in costs for consumers who pay with cash, as items may round up more often than they round down. For families who rely on tight budgets, even small changes in price can have a cumulative impact. 2. **Cash Dependency**: Low-income families are more likely to use cash instead of credit or debit for transactions due to limited access to banking services or to avoid transaction fees. Therefore, they might be more affected by the rounding of cash transactions. On the other hand, the abolishment of pennies may also offer indirect benefits: 1. **Efficiency and Convenience**: Eliminating pennies could streamline financial transactions and reduce the time spent counting small change, which could be a convenience for all consumers. 2. **Potential Savings**: Governments spend more to produce and distribute pennies than the coins are actually worth. By phasing out the penny, the savings could be redirected to programs that benefit low-income families or to offset any negative impacts. 3. **Charitable Giving**: If rounding policies are implemented, they may include a charitable aspect, such as the option to round up to donate to funds that support low-income communities. From a broader economic perspective, the impact on low-income families from phasing out the penny is likely minimal. However, ensuring that the transition is managed equitably, with appropriate measures in place to protect those who could be adversely affected, is crucial. Education about the change and public feedback could play important roles in creating a fair transition period for all, including low-income families."},{"instruction":"if we abolish pennies, do we need to produce more nickels in circulation?","output":"If pennies were abolished, the need to produce more nickels would depend on the resulting changes in consumer behavior and cash transaction patterns. Let's consider several factors that might influence this need: 1. **Rounding Transactions**: When prices are rounded to the nearest nickel in cash transactions, there might be an initial belief that more nickels would be required. However, as the rounding would affect prices both up and down to the nearest five cents, the actual demand for the coin might not significantly increase. 2. **Payment Methods**: The trend in consumer behavior is increasingly shifting towards electronic payments, like credit and debit cards, mobile payments, and online transactions. If this trend continues or accelerates, the demand for physical coins, including nickels, might actually decrease over time, despite the absence of pennies. 3. **Supply of Existing Nickels**: There is already a substantial number of nickels in circulation. The need to produce more would depend on whether current supplies, combined with those recovered from the elimination of pennies, can meet whatever new demand may arise. 4. **Change in Coin Usage**: The elimination of pennies might cause some businesses to adjust their pricing strategies, potentially leading to less reliance on small coins altogether. For example, businesses might price products in round numbers to avoid dealing with small change. 5. **Cash Management Practices**: Retailers and financial institutions might alter how they manage cash to minimize the need for nickels. For example, they might round change given on cash transactions to the nearest 10 cents, thereby reducing the reliance on five-cent pieces. 6. **Consumer Adaptation**: People may adapt to the absence of pennies by simply carrying more nickels or by adjusting their expectations around receiving and giving exact change. Ultimately, whether or not more nickels would need to be produced would be determined by the confluence of these factors. It would require monitoring and studying the effects of penny abolition over time. Central banks and mints would need to assess and adjust coin production based on actual demand rather than theoretical expectations."},{"instruction":"can you give me a paragraph about the necessity to abolish pennies since they are expensive to produce and also pollute environment?","output":"The call to abolish the penny has gained momentum in light of compelling evidence that its production costs and environmental impact far exceed its utility as currency. It costs more to mint a penny than it's actually worth—a clear financial imprudence when considering the vast quantities produced and circulated. This inefficiency echoes throughout the economy, as handling, counting, and transporting these coins add to the cost for businesses and financial institutions. Beyond the economic argument lies an environmental imperative; the mining, manufacturing, and distribution of pennies consume substantial natural resources and energy, contributing to pollution and the depletion of non-renewable metals. The penny's lifecycle, from production to disposal, leaves an ecological footprint at odds with modern sustainability goals. In a society that is increasingly digital and environmentally conscious, phasing out the penny represents both a fiscal responsibility and a step towards a greener economy, freeing up resources to invest in more sustainable forms of currency and advancing environmental stewardship."},{"instruction":"can you help improve the following paragraph: Now I’ve been asked a lot of times whether I’m a glass half full or glass half empty type of person.

The primary topic of this meeting was discussing the introduction of flexible working hours and the possible restructuring of our work schedules. We delved into examining how changing our current fixed lunch hours to a more staggered lunch schedule would affect our work-flow and productivity. The discussions were pretty intense, with various team leads presenting their department's perspectives, raising concerns, and suggesting potential solutions. I remember one of my colleagues presenting a compelling argument detailing how a staggered lunch schedule could reduce the downtime experienced during the peak lunch hour rush and improve efficiency. Everyone seemed to be keenly interested and actively participating. This was a major shift in our work dynamic, and so it felt very pivotal – we were all contributing to shaping our work environment for the better. What makes this particular meeting memorable for me was the level of engagement and openness to change that was displayed by everyone in the room. It was encouraging to see management not only receptive to feedback but actively seeking it from employees at all levels. Moreover, the meeting was not just about listening to instructions passively; it felt like a real team effort to innovate for our mutual benefit. In the following weeks, we implemented a trial based on the outcomes of that meeting, which proved to be a resounding success. The teamwork and camaraderie developed during that meeting series were instrumental, and it truly signified a memorable and impactful change in our workplace culture."},{"instruction":"make it more simple and try to cover the subject as different people have different food preference and some of them have allergies so they are bringing food from home or ordering out. so the launch schedule need to change so everyone can eat","output":"Certainly! I remember once attending a particularly significant meeting at work that focused on a topic that affected everyone in the office – our lunch schedule. The meeting took place during the spring of last year in one of our larger meeting rooms. It was an informal setting, but the topic was serious. Gathered there were various members of staff from different departments, including our HR representative, a few managers, and several of my colleagues, including myself. The diversity in roles meant that we could hear from a range of perspectives on the issue. The main issue we discussed was changing the lunch schedule to accommodate the varied dietary needs and preferences of our staff. We had some team members who had specific food allergies, others who preferred to bring meals from home, and some who liked to order food from outside. The problem with our existing lunch schedule was that everyone was trying to eat at the same time, which led to overcrowding in the break room and long waits for the microwave. Additionally, those ordering food had a hard time receiving their orders due to the sheer volume of deliveries around the same hour. What made this meeting stand out for me was the collaborative effort to come up with a solution. Instead of the management team dictating the changes, they actively sought input from all of us. We discussed various ideas, such as introducing staggered lunch times and setting up dedicated spaces for those who needed to eat food that was allergen-free. I remember there was a genuine effort to understand everyone's concerns, and suggestions were taken seriously. For instance, we talked about creating a schedule that allowed small groups of employees to take their breaks at different times to reduce the congestion. This meeting sticks out in my memory because it showed how a simple change, like when we eat, could significantly improve our daily work experience. It was about more than just schedules; it was about respecting and accommodating each other's needs. The engagement level at that meeting was quite high because the outcome directly impacted all of us, which isn't always the case in every meeting. The outcome was a revised lunch schedule that seemed to please most of the team members. It facilitated a smoother flow in our dining area and was a relief for many, especially those with dietary restrictions. Reflecting on that meeting, it reminds me of how important it is to work in an environment where everyone’s voice can be heard and where collaborative problem-solving is encouraged."},{"instruction":"make it more simple and try to cover the subject as why all the employee cannot eat the compony food because different people have different food preference and some of them have allergies to the compony food so they are bringing food from home or ordering out. so the launch schedule and the food item in it need to change so everyone can eat","output":"Okay, let's simplify. The meeting I remember was about changing our lunch schedule and menu at work, and it had everyone's attention because it involved our daily meals. It was sometime late last year, and we gathered in a small conference room on the first floor. The main attendees were our HR manager, the catering supervisor, and us, the employees. There was a mix of people from different departments. The reason this meeting was important was because several colleagues had raised concerns about the company-provided lunches not meeting their dietary needs. Some had food allergies, while others had specific preferences or dietary restrictions that meant they couldn't eat the food being served. We spent the bulk of the meeting discussing different types of food preferences and allergies. For instance, one colleague was vegetarian, another was gluten intolerant, and another had a severe nut allergy. We all agreed that the current one-size-fits-all approach to lunch was not working. What made the meeting memorable—and a bit tense, to be honest—was the collective realization that many staff were unhappy or unable to eat the food provided. It was surprising to see just how many people were affected and how long they had been dealing with this issue silently. The outcome was a decision to revamp both the lunch schedule and the menu. It was agreed that offering a variety of food options and allowing a more flexible lunchtime could minimize the rush and accommodate everyone's needs. We also talked about setting up a system where people could mark their allergies or dietary preferences, so the kitchen staff could prepare meals accordingly. What stood out to me from that meeting was the sense of unity in solving a common problem. It highlighted that a seemingly minor issue like lunch could have a significant impact on employees' satisfaction and health. This meeting made me appreciate the power of open communication in the workplace and how it can lead to positive changes. The new schedule and menu were implemented a month later, and the feedback was overwhelmingly positive. It's a change I'll always remember because it made our lunchtimes so much better."},{"instruction":"answer the part2 of IELTS speaking test with 250 to 300 words. remember to act as a human in the test not an AI.

It was an emergency meeting called by the student council, concerning a sudden rise in tuition fees, and it was held in the main auditorium in late September. We were all taken aback by the sudden hike in fees and needed a platform to discuss and address our concerns. The auditorium was packed with students from all departments, and there were also several faculty members and a couple of university administrators present. The atmosphere was quite charged; you could tell that everyone was worried and upset about the financial burden that the tuition hike could entail. At the meeting, there was a lot of discussion around how the raise in tuition fees seemed unreasonable, especially considering the additional costs of textbooks and living expenses that we were already shouldering. Several students spoke up about their difficulties, with compelling personal stories. One person highlighted how they were already working part-time jobs to cover the current fees, and this increase would make their situation untenable. It became clear that this issue affected not just a few but many students across the board. The reason this meeting stands out so vividly for me is the unity and collective spirit that echoed through the room. Despite the stress and the worry, we managed to rally together and come up with a structured plan. We decided to form a committee to communicate directly with the university management, lay out our concerns in a formal document, and request a reconsideration of the tuition increase. I remember feeling a strong sense of community and responsibility during and after this meeting. It wasn't just about individual frustration; it was about standing together for a common cause. It taught me the importance of voicing concerns in a productive manner and the power of collective bargaining. Eventually, our efforts paid off as the university agreed to implement a more gradual increase, giving students more time to adjust financially. This outcome was a huge relief and reinforced the value of advocacy and solidarity in achieving positive change."},{"instruction":"Discussion topics: Going to meetings • What are the different types of meeting that people often go to? e.g. online conference vs face to face answer the IELTS speaking test with 85 to 110 words. remember to act as a human in the test not an AI.","output":"People attend a variety of meetings, which can broadly be categorized into face-to-face and virtual formats.

This record is crucial for managing the execution of functions and handling the return of control when a function call completes. When a process executes, its functions and procedures are usually managed through a call stack (or simply, \\"the stack\\"), which is a type of stack data structure. Each time a function (or procedure or method) is called, an activation record is generated and pushed onto the call stack. The record typically contains the following information: 1. **Return Address**: The location in the program code to which control should return after the current function call completes. 2. **Parameters**: The arguments passed to the function, which the called function can access and use for its computation. 3. **Local Variables**: The variables that are local to the function call, which are allocated space within the activation record. 4. **Control Information**: This can include the state of the CPU registers, the condition code, and any other information needed to resume the previous function's execution. 5. **Dynamic Link**: This links to the activation record of the caller, so when the function returns, the system knows from which activation record to retrieve the calling environment. 6. **Static Link**: In languages that support nested functions or scopes (like Pascal), this link points to the activation record of the function's lexically enclosing scope. Upon entry to a function, space for the activation record is created on the stack. When the function executes, it uses this record to store its local state and to manage any nested function calls it makes. When the function is ready to return, its activation record is used to restore the previous state, including where to return execution in the calling code, and then it is popped off the stack. The activation records are crucial for recursive function calls, because each call creates a new record that holds its own unique set of parameters and local variables, thus allowing the same function to have multiple active instances at the same time. Operating systems and language runtime systems manage the stack as part of the execution environment they provide for running processes. The management of the stack, including pushing and popping activation records, is central to the implementation of function calls and returns in most programming languages."},{"instruction":"A 91 year old patient had a stroke a few weeks ago. Her doctor has suggested starting Valproate Sodium. Is it a good idea? Why would it have been suggested? What are the pros and cons? What are the risks of taking it, and how likely are they? How likely is the patient to be at risk if she doesn't take it?","output":"Valproate Sodium, commonly known as valproic acid or divalproex sodium, is a medication primarily used to treat seizure disorders, bipolar disorder, and to prevent migraine headaches. It is not typically used as a direct treatment for stroke. However, there might be reasons why a doctor would suggest valproate sodium for a patient who has had a stroke. Here are some potential reasons a doctor might consider prescribing valproate sodium to an elderly post-stroke patient: 1. Seizure Prevention: After a stroke, some patients might be at an increased risk for seizures due to the damage to the brain tissue. Valproate sodium could potentially be used to prevent seizures. 2. Mood Stabilization: If the patient has a history of bipolar disorder or is experiencing mood swings or aggressive behavior post-stroke, valproate could help in stabilizing the mood. 3. Off-label Use: There might be an off-label use that the doctor is considering, which is not typically one of the recognized purposes of the drug. Pros of using valproate sodium: - Effective for controlling seizures and stabilizing mood. - Can be beneficial in treating and preventing certain types of headache. Cons and risks of valproate sodium, especially given the age of the patient: - Liver toxicity: Valproate sodium can cause liver damage, particularly in older patients. - Pancreatitis: There is a risk of developing pancreatitis, which can be fatal. - Thrombocytopenia: The drug can lead to a reduced platelet count, increasing bleeding risk. - Weight gain and tremors are among other side effects. - Cognitive effects: Given the age and the recent stroke, there could be an increased risk of confusion or worsened cognitive function. - Drug interactions: Valproate sodium can interact with other medications the patient might be taking. - Teratogenic risk: Although not directly relevant for a 91-year-old, valproate sodium carries a high risk of birth defects and is contraindicated in pregnant women. The likelihood of the patient facing risks will depend on their overall health, their liver function, and any coexisting medical conditions they might have. Since the elderly generally have a reduced ability to process medications, the risks might be heightened compared to younger individuals. Regarding the risks of not taking it, without knowing the specific reasons for the suggestion, it's difficult to assess the level of risk associated with declining the medication. Generally, if the drug is being suggested for seizure prevention and the patient chooses not to take it, they might be at a higher risk for having seizures. It is critical to have a detailed discussion with the patient's health care provider to understand why valproate sodium is being suggested in this specific context. The conversation should revolve around the potential benefits, possible side effects, the patient's medical history, the risk of drug interactions, and alternative treatments, to make an informed decision regarding the patient's care. Depending on the patient's condition and the doctor's rationale, a second opinion might also be a prudent step to take before starting a new medication regimen in a patient of advanced age."},{"instruction":"It is being suggested for seizure prevention. Given the patient's age, might it be better to risk the seizures than risk the side effects of the medication?","output":"The decision to use Valproate Sodium or any medication for seizure prevention in an elderly patient, particularly in the context of post-stroke care, involves weighing the risks of treatment against the potential benefits. Seizures after a stroke can be dangerous and may result in further injury, decreased quality of life, and increased mortality. Therefore, preventing seizures can be crucial. However, as you noted, there are significant risks associated with Valproate Sodium, especially in an elderly patient, including hepatic toxicity, thrombocytopenia, pancreatitis, and cognitive side effects, among others. The decision-making process should include: 1. **Assessment of Seizure Risk**: The doctor should evaluate how likely the patient is to experience seizures. The location and severity of the stroke, any previous history of seizures, and the presence of seizure-related activity on an EEG (if performed) can help gauge the risk. 2. **Evaluation of Patient’s Current State**: Consider the patient's overall health status, including liver and kidney function, which are crucial for metabolism and excretion of the medication, to determine if they can handle the drug. 3. **Medication Side Effect Profile**: Since Valproate Sodium carries significant risks as listed earlier, the patient's likelihood of experiencing these versus the likelihood and potential impact of seizures should be considered. 4. **Consider Alternative Medications**: There are other antiepileptic medications with different side effect profiles that might be more suitable for an elderly patient. A neurologist might be able to offer guidance on the best choice. 5. **Monitoring**: If it is decided to start Valproate Sodium, close monitoring for side effects is essential, including regular liver function tests and blood tests to monitor blood counts and medication levels. 6. **Patient and Family Input**: It’s important to involve the patient and their family or caregivers in the decision-making process, ensuring they understand the potential risks and benefits and are comfortable with the plan. In some cases, the risks of the medication might be deemed too high compared to the risk of seizures, especially if the estimated risk of post-stroke seizures is low or if there are feasible non-pharmacological alternatives to consider. In others, treatment to prevent seizures might be considered critical, and therefore a medication regimen with careful monitoring could be initiated. Ultimately, each case must be considered individually. A thorough discussion with the healthcare provider, possibly including a consultation with a neurologist, will help in making the most appropriate decision for the patient’s care. It is not uncommon for physicians to opt for a more conservative approach in such cases, avoiding medication unless absolutely necessary."},{"instruction":"What percentage of elderly stroke patients end up having a seizure","output":"The incidence of seizures after a stroke varies based on several factors, including the type of stroke (ischemic or hemorrhagic), the location and size of the stroke, and the time elapsed since the stroke occurred. Seizures can occur early (within the first 7 to 14 days) or late (after 14 days) following a stroke. In the general stroke population, the estimated risk of seizures after a stroke is about 5-10%. However, in elderly patients, the risk may be slightly higher due to factors such as a greater likelihood of pre-existing brain atrophy, comorbidities that can affect brain health, and the increased vulnerability of the brain to injury. It's important to note that most seizures that occur after a stroke happen within the first year, with a higher incidence in the first month. Late seizures can also occur and might indicate the development of post-stroke epilepsy, especially if recurrent. Given the potential variability and the individual circumstances of each patient, healthcare providers use their clinical judgment and may consider electroencephalogram (EEG) monitoring, the patient's neurological status, and the specifics of the stroke when estimating seizure risk and deciding whether to initiate antiepileptic medication. For an accurate assessment of seizure risk in elderly stroke patients, it is best to consult the latest clinical studies or stroke guidelines. The attending physician can provide information tailored to the specific case in question, considering all the factors that might influence the patient's risk."},{"instruction":"What percentage have a late seizure? 1 month has now passed without this patient having a seizure","output":"Late seizures, which are defined as occurring more than 14 days after the initial stroke event, are less common than early seizures. The incidence of late seizures can vary, but it is generally lower than the incidence of early seizures. Research suggests that the risk of having a late seizure after a stroke is approximately 3-4% in the first year, and the cumulative risk can increase to around 10% within 5 years post-stroke. It is important to note that these figures are general estimates and can vary based on individual patient factors, such as the size and location of the stroke, the type of stroke (ischemic or hemorrhagic), and the presence of other risk factors like a history of prior strokes or a family history of seizures. If one month has passed without the patient experiencing a seizure, it may lower the immediate concern for early post-stroke seizures, but it does not completely eliminate the risk of developing seizures later on. The development of post-stroke epilepsy, which is characterized by recurrent seizures, is a possibility that needs to be monitored over time. For a patient who is one month post-stroke without having experienced a seizure, a healthcare provider might take a watchful waiting approach, monitoring the patient for any signs of seizure activity. The decision to start antiepileptic medication prophylactically would be based on weighing the potential risks and benefits, as well as considering the individual patient's clinical status and preferences. It's also crucial to continue monitoring the patient's neurological recovery and to manage other stroke risk factors to minimize the likelihood of further cerebrovascular events that could increase the risk of seizures. As with all medical considerations, decisions should be personalized and based on the best available evidence, the patient's overall health status, and the potential risks and benefits of treatment. A discussion with the patient's neurologist or primary care physician can provide more specific guidance based on the patient's unique circumstances."},{"instruction":"This patient's stroke was a hemorrhage","output":"Hemorrhagic strokes, which involve bleeding within or around the brain, have been associated with a higher risk of seizures compared to ischemic strokes, where blood flow to part of the brain is blocked. The incidence of seizures following hemorrhagic stroke varies in the literature, but studies generally indicate an increased risk compared to ischemic stroke. Late seizures (occurring more than 14 days after the stroke) can develop in a significant proportion of these patients. Some studies suggest that the risk of late seizures after hemorrhagic stroke can be in the range of 10-20% or even higher, depending on the specifics of the case, including the size and location of the hemorrhage and the patient's overall neurological condition. Patients who have had a hemorrhagic stroke are often closely monitored for signs of seizure activity, especially if other risk factors are present. Prophylactic (preventive) treatment with antiepileptic drugs may be considered for some patients based on their individual risk profile, but this approach remains controversial and not uniformly recommended. The decision to start antiepileptic treatment is typically made on a case-by-case basis, with careful consideration of the potential benefits and risks, as well as the patient's preferences and quality of life. For a patient who is one month post-hemorrhagic stroke without having experienced a seizure, it's essential to remain vigilant, as the risk of late seizures persists and may continue for several years post-stroke. Regular follow-up with the patient's healthcare provider is critical to monitor for any new symptoms and to make timely decisions regarding their ongoing care and treatment. The management of a patient with hemorrhagic stroke should also involve controlling blood pressure and other modifiable risk factors, optimizing brain health, and facilitating neurological recovery through rehabilitation. If there is a consideration for the use of an antiepileptic drug like Valproate Sodium, it is vital to discuss the specific risks associated with the patient's age and medical condition."},{"instruction":"If the patient decides to take the medication is there any chance it could slow down the recovery from the stroke?","output":"The use of antiepileptic drugs (AEDs), including Valproate Sodium, can potentially have an impact on neurological recovery after a stroke. These medications can have side effects such as drowsiness, confusion, and difficulties with coordination, which might interfere with the rehabilitation process. Cognitive side effects are particularly important to consider in elderly patients who may already be at risk for cognitive decline after a stroke. However, the picture is complex because seizures themselves can also negatively affect stroke recovery. Uncontrolled seizures can lead to additional brain damage, disrupt rehabilitation efforts, and overall negatively affect a patient's quality of life. Therefore, if a patient is at high risk for seizures and an AED is indicated, the benefits of preventing seizures might outweigh the risks associated with the medication's side effects. Valproate Sodium and other AEDs can also interact with other medications that a stroke patient may be taking, which could complicate their medical management. Additionally, elderly patients may have age-related changes in drug metabolism and clearance, leading to increased sensitivity to medications and a higher risk of adverse effects. It's essential to balance the potential risks of the medication with the benefits of seizure control. If an AED is deemed necessary: 1. **Dosing**: Starting with a low dose and gradually increasing to the lowest effective dose can help minimize side effects. 2. **Monitoring**: Regular monitoring of drug levels, liver function, blood counts, and other relevant parameters can help manage potential side effects. 3. **Reevaluation**: Periodic reevaluation of the need for the medication is crucial. If the patient remains seizure-free for a significant period, a discussion about the risks and benefits of continuing the medication is warranted. 4. **Rehabilitation**: Close coordination with the rehabilitation team can help adjust therapies to accommodate any medication-related side effects the patient may experience. Ultimately, whether to initiate Valproate Sodium or any other AED should be a collaborative decision between the patient, their family, and the healthcare team, with a clear discussion of the potential impact on stroke recovery. The decision should be individualized, taking into account the specifics of the patient's condition, the risk of seizures, and the patient's goals for recovery and quality of life. Regular reassessment is critical to ensure that the treatment plan remains aligned with the patient's evolving needs and circumstances."},{"instruction":"Please list everything that the doctors should monitor if the patient decides to take the medication. Also list the frequency of each thing that needs to be monitored or measured and why it needs to be monitored.","output":"When a patient is prescribed Valproate Sodium (valproic acid), several factors need to be closely monitored to ensure the patient's safety and the effectiveness of the medication. The monitoring plan may vary based on individual patient factors and comorbid conditions, but here are common parameters that are monitored along with typical frequencies and the reasons for monitoring: 1. **Liver Function Tests (LFTs)**: Valproate can cause liver toxicity, so LFTs are typically monitored before treatment begins, at baseline, and frequently during the first six months of treatment. Monitoring frequency may range from every few weeks to every few months, depending on clinical judgement and any existing liver issues. After this period, if no abnormalities are detected, LFTs might be checked every 6 to 12 months. 2. **Blood Ammonia Levels**: Valproate can cause hyperammonemia, which can lead to encephalopathy. Monitoring is particularly important if the patient shows symptoms such as lethargy or changes in mental status. 3. **Complete Blood Count (CBC)**: Valproate can lead to a decrease in platelet count (thrombocytopenia) and other blood cell changes. CBC is usually checked before treatment, at baseline, and periodically thereafter (e.g., every 3 to 6 months). 4. **Valproic Acid Levels**: To ensure that drug levels are within the therapeutic range and to adjust dosage accordingly. This is often checked 3 to 5 days after starting the medication or changing the dose and then every 6 to 12 months, or more frequently if there are concerns about drug interactions or side effects. 5. **Pancreatic Enzymes (Amylase and Lipase)**: To monitor for signs of pancreatitis, although routine monitoring is not always performed unless the patient exhibits symptoms of abdominal pain, nausea, or vomiting. 6. **Weight**: Valproate can cause weight gain. Monitoring weight regularly can help in managing potential metabolic side effects and making dietary adjustments as needed. 7. **Neurological Examination**: Assess for signs of tremor, ataxia, or cognitive changes. This can be part of regular clinical visits. 8. **Pregnancy Test**: For women of childbearing potential, a pregnancy test is recommended before starting treatment because valproate is highly teratogenic. Effective contraception is advised for women of childbearing age on valproate. 9. **Renal Function**: Especially in elderly patients, as renal function can influence the excretion of the medication and thus the drug levels. This might be assessed less frequently (e.g., annually or semiannually) unless there are underlying kidney issues. It is important to remember that this is a general guide and the actual monitoring plan will depend on the patient's health, age, concurrent medications, and clinical response. The frequency of monitoring may be increased if the patient develops signs or symptoms that suggest potential side effects, or if there is a change in the patient's clinical status or medication regimen. Additionally, patient education is crucial. Patients and caregivers should be informed about potential side effects to watch for and should be instructed to report any unusual symptoms or changes in health status to their healthcare provider promptly. As with any medication, the monitoring plan should be individualized to the patient and adjusted as needed based on their response to treatment and any emerging concerns. Regular communication with the healthcare team is key to ensuring that the treatment is as safe and effective as possible."},{"instruction":"Redo the list talking into consideration the patient's age and the type of her stroke","output":"Considering the patient's age (91 years old) and the fact that she has had a hemorrhagic stroke, here's a modified and detailed monitoring plan for a patient starting on Valproate Sodium. The exact intervals for monitoring may vary depending on individual patient factors, initial findings, and the treating physician's clinical judgment. 1. **Liver Function Tests (LFTs)**: - **Frequency**: Baseline, within the first 1-2 weeks, then monthly for the first 6 months; if stable, every 6 months thereafter. - **Why**: Older adults have an increased risk of hepatotoxicity; early detection of liver damage is essential. 2. **Valproic Acid Levels**: - **Frequency**: 3-5 days after initiation or dosage change to establish therapeutic levels, then every 6 months, or more often if there are concerns about efficacy or toxicity. - **Why**: To ensure therapeutic levels are maintained without reaching toxic levels, which is particularly important in the elderly due to altered pharmacokinetics. 3. **Complete Blood Count (CBC)**: - **Frequency**: Baseline, monthly for the first few months, then every 3-6 months. - **Why**: To detect thrombocytopenia or other hematological changes, which may occur with Valproate use. 4. **Blood Ammonia Levels**: - **Frequency**: Baseline and as clinically indicated if symptoms of lethargy, vomiting, or changes in mental status occur. - **Why**: To detect hyperammonemia, which can cause encephalopathy. 5. **Pancreatic Enzymes (Amylase and Lipase)**: - **Frequency**: Baseline and as clinically indicated if abdominal pain, nausea, or vomiting occurs. - **Why**: To monitor for signs of pancreatitis, a serious potential side effect. 6. **Weight**: - **Frequency**: At each clinic visit. - **Why**: To monitor for weight gain, which can be associated with Valproate and may exacerbate comorbid conditions such as diabetes or hypertension. 7. **Neurological Examination**: - **Frequency**: At each clinic visit. - **Why**: To assess for new onset or worsening of tremor, ataxia, cognitive decline, or any other changes in neurological status. 8. **Renal Function Tests**: - **Frequency**: Baseline, then every 6-12 months, or more frequently if there are underlying renal concerns. - **Why**: Renal function can influence drug clearance and dosing, especially in the elderly. 9. **Cognitive Function Assessment**: - **Frequency**: Baseline and regularly thereafter, as cognitive decline can be exacerbated by Valproate. - **Why**: The elderly are at increased risk for cognitive impairment post-stroke and with antiepileptic drug use. 10. **Blood Pressure Monitoring**: - **Frequency**: At each clinic visit. - **Why**: Post-stroke patients, especially those who have had a hemorrhagic stroke, need careful blood pressure management to prevent recurrent strokes. 11. **Functional Status and Rehabilitation Progress**: - **Frequency**: As part of ongoing rehabilitation sessions and during clinic visits. - **Why**: To ensure that the medication is not adversely affecting the patient's recovery and rehabilitation progress. For elderly patients, and especially for those who have suffered a hemorrhagic stroke, the risk-benefit profile and the monitoring plan should be re-evaluated more frequently. Adjustments to medication and monitoring intervals may be necessary based on the patient's evolving clinical status and tolerance to the medication. Coordination of care among different specialists involved, including the primary care physician, neurologist, geriatrician, and rehabilitation therapists, is crucial to ensure comprehensive monitoring and management of the patient's condition."},{"instruction":"What are the rough percentage chances of each of the most common serious side effects of taking the medication. Consider the patient's age and type of stroke","output":"Valproate Sodium is associated with several potential side effects, but the exact risk of experiencing these effects varies among individuals and can be influenced by factors like age, type of stroke, overall health, and concurrent medication use. While it's difficult to provide precise percentages for the risk of each side effect, I can give you a general overview of the likelihood of common serious side effects, particularly in an elderly population and with a history of hemorrhagic stroke: 1. **Hepatotoxicity (Liver Damage)**: - Elderly patients are at higher risk, but overall, serious liver damage is rare, occurring in approximately 1 in 10,000 to 1 in 50,000 patients. However, minor liver enzyme elevations may be more common. 2. **Thrombocytopenia (Low Platelet Count)**: - This occurs in about 5-10% of patients taking Valproate. In the elderly, who may have compromised bone marrow function, the risk could be slightly higher. 3. **Hyperammonemia (High Ammonia Levels in Blood)**: - Clinically significant hyperammonemia is uncommon, but when it occurs, it may lead to encephalopathy. It can be more difficult to detect in the elderly due to polypharmacy and nonspecific presentation. 4. **Pancreatitis**: - Acute pancreatitis associated with Valproate use is rare, with estimated incidences ranging from 1 in 20,000 to 1 in 40,000 patients. Elderly patients may be more susceptible to serious complications if pancreatitis occurs. 5. **Weight Gain**: - Weight gain is relatively common with Valproate use, seen in approximately 10-20% of patients. This side effect could exacerbate other health issues in elderly patients, such as cardiovascular disease. 6. **Cognitive Effects**: - Cognitive impairment and sedation are more common in the elderly due to decreased drug clearance. The exact prevalence is not well-defined but is of significant concern in this population. 7. **Tremor**: - Up to 10% or more of patients on Valproate may experience a tremor, which can be exacerbated by age-related changes in the nervous system. It's essential to recognize that while these side effects are possible, they are not guaranteed to occur, and some patients may tolerate Valproate well without experiencing significant issues. The decision to prescribe Valproate must involve a careful consideration of these risks, especially given the increased susceptibility in an elderly patient with a hemorrhagic stroke. To minimize the risk of serious side effects, healthcare providers should start with the lowest effective dose, monitor the patient closely, and adjust treatment as necessary. Additionally, they should educate the patient and caregivers on the signs and symptoms of serious side effects to ensure prompt recognition and management. Always consult with a healthcare provider for the most personalized and up-to-date information regarding treatment risks and benefits. This response is meant to provide a general overview and should not replace professional medical advice."},{"instruction":"Please continue this list with more of the potential side effects, using the same format","output":"Continuing with the potential side effects of Valproate Sodium, especially for an elderly patient who has experienced a hemorrhagic stroke, here are additional risks: 8. **Encephalopathy**: - This rare but serious side effect, sometimes associated with hyperammonemia, may occur in a small percentage of patients. The elderly may be at a slightly higher risk due to a reduced capacity to clear ammonia and other metabolites. 9. **Gastrointestinal Disturbances**: - Up to 20% of patients might experience GI symptoms such as nausea, vomiting, and indigestion. The risk may increase with age due to pre-existing GI conditions and slower metabolism. 10. **Hair Loss**: - A reversible side effect occurring in a small percentage of patients, typically within the first few months of treatment. Exact prevalence is not well-defined but is generally considered a less serious concern. 11. **Increased Bleeding Risk**: - Due to the potential effect of Valproate on platelet function and coagulation, there may be an increased risk of bleeding. While specific percentages are not readily available, this risk necessitates caution in patients with a history of hemorrhagic stroke. 12. **Bone Density Loss**: - Long-term use of Valproate can lead to decreased bone mineral density, increasing the risk of osteoporosis and fractures, which are already a concern in the elderly population. 13. **Polypharmacy Interactions**: - Given that elderly patients are often on multiple medications, the risk of drug interactions may increase. Valproate can affect the blood levels of other medications, and vice versa, potentially leading to increased side effects or decreased effectiveness of treatments. 14. **Dermatological Reactions**: - Rarely, serious skin reactions such as Stevens-Johnson syndrome or toxic epidermal necrolysis may occur. The incidence is very low, but these conditions can be life-threatening. 15. **Hypothermia**: - Valproate has been associated with hypothermia, a rare side effect that occurs in less than 1% of patients. The elderly may be more vulnerable to temperature dysregulation. 16. **Urinary Tract Infections**: - There is some evidence suggesting an increased risk of urinary tract infections in patients taking Valproate, which can be a concern for the elderly who are already at a higher risk for UTIs. 17. **Carnitine Deficiency**: - Valproate can cause a secondary carnitine deficiency, which might lead to weakness and fatigue. While the prevalence is not clearly established, supplementation may be considered in some patients. It is important to stress that these side effects are not guaranteed to occur and their frequency can vary. In practice, a thorough risk assessment is performed before initiating Valproate therapy, especially in a patient as vulnerable as a 91-year-old who has had a hemorrhagic stroke. The potential benefits of seizure prevention need to be carefully weighed against the risks of these side effects. Due to the increased risk of adverse reactions in the elderly, any decision to initiate Valproate therapy should be made with caution and involve close monitoring. Patients and their caregivers should be educated about the signs and symptoms of these side effects so they can report any concerns to their healthcare provider immediately."},{"instruction":"Please continue this list again","output":"Continuing with the potential side effects of Valproate Sodium, with considerations for an elderly patient who has had a hemorrhagic stroke: 18. **Vision Changes**: - Although uncommon, Valproate can cause vision changes such as diplopia (double vision) or blurred vision. Elderly patients may be more susceptible to such effects due to age-related eye conditions. 19. **Auditory Side Effects**: - Rarely, patients may experience tinnitus (ringing in the ears) or hearing impairment. The exact incidence is unclear but is considered to be low. 20. **Peripheral Edema**: - Swelling of the ankles and feet can occur due to fluid retention. This side effect is relatively uncommon with Valproate use but should be monitored, as it can contribute to mobility issues, particularly in the elderly. 21. **Respiratory Issues**: - Respiratory depression or dyspnea (difficulty breathing) is a rare but serious side effect, especially in patients with underlying respiratory conditions. 22. **Hypothyroidism**: - Valproate has been associated with hypothyroidism, though this is a relatively rare side effect. Since thyroid function can affect numerous body systems, it's important to monitor thyroid levels, especially in the elderly who may already be at risk for thyroid disorders. 23. **Hyponatremia**: - Valproate may rarely cause a decrease in serum sodium levels, which can be significant, particularly in patients taking diuretics or those with pre-existing conditions affecting sodium balance. 24. **Cardiovascular Effects**: - Bradycardia (slow heart rate) and hypertension have been reported with Valproate use, though these effects are not common. Monitoring is particularly important in patients with pre-existing cardiovascular conditions. 25. **Metabolic Disturbances**: - Valproate can cause metabolic acidosis, a condition where the body produces too much acid or the kidneys are not removing enough acid from the body. While rare, it's a serious condition that would require immediate medical attention. 26. **Disruption of Blood Glucose Control**: - Altered blood glucose levels have been reported in patients taking Valproate. This is a critical consideration for patients with diabetes or those at risk of diabetes. 27. **Immunological Effects**: - Very rarely, Valproate may affect the immune system, leading to conditions such as lupus-like syndrome. The incidence is not well-established but is considered very low. 28. **Psychiatric Effects**: - Although Valproate is used in the treatment of bipolar disorder, it can paradoxically cause mood swings, agitation, or even hallucinations. These side effects are unusual but should be monitored, especially in the elderly, who may be more sensitive to changes in mental status. It's important to note that while this list covers a range of potential side effects, the actual experience of each patient will vary. Many people taking Valproate do not experience severe side effects, or they may experience them in a mild form that can be managed with dose adjustments or additional treatments. For the elderly and those with a history of a hemorrhagic stroke, the threshold for initiating treatment should be higher due to the increased risk of side effects, and careful monitoring should be a priority if treatment with Valproate is initiated. As always, decisions about medication should be made in close consultation with healthcare providers, taking into account the full medical history and the specific needs of the patient."},{"instruction":"Which part of the brain is the most likely to cause delayed seizure after a severe brain haemorrhage?","output":"Seizures following a hemorrhagic stroke (brain hemorrhage) can occur due to the irritation or damage to the brain tissue caused by blood in the brain or from the effects of the hematoma itself (the localized collection of blood). While seizures can potentially arise from any area of the brain affected by the hemorrhage, certain regions are more prone to generate seizures, particularly if the hemorrhage is severe: 1. **Cortex (Cerebral Cortex)**: The cortex is the outer layer of the brain and is responsible for many complex functions including consciousness, thought, emotion, reasoning, language, and memory. Hemorrhages that affect the cortical tissue are more likely to result in seizures because the cortex is involved in the generation and propagation of seizure activity. 2. **Temporal Lobe**: The temporal lobe is one of the most common sites for the origination of seizures due to its involvement in memory, emotion, and hearing. Damage to this area by hemorrhage can disrupt the normal electrical activity, leading to seizures. 3. **Frontal Lobe**: This part of the brain is involved in decision making, problem-solving, control of purposeful behaviors, consciousness, and emotions. Hemorrhages in the frontal lobe can also lead to seizure activity due to its extensive connections and high level of functionality. 4. **Parietal and Occipital Lobes**: While less common, hemorrhages in these lobes can still cause seizures. The parietal lobe processes sensory information, and the occipital lobe is the primary visual processing center. 5. **Subcortical Regions**: Deep brain structures such as the thalamus and basal ganglia, while less often implicated in seizure genesis compared to cortical regions, can still be involved, particularly if the hemorrhage leads to a secondary impact on the cortex. It is also worth noting that the severity of the hemorrhage, the amount of blood that comes into contact with the brain tissue, and any subsequent inflammation or scar formation can influence the likelihood of seizures. Hemorrhagic transformation of an ischemic stroke (where an initially blood flow-blocked area starts bleeding) can also increase the risk of seizures. In the case of a severe brain hemorrhage, the exact location of the hemorrhage, along with its size and the degree of secondary brain injury (such as increased intracranial pressure and edema), are all important factors that influence the risk of developing delayed seizures. Since the brain is an interconnected organ, a hemorrhage in one location can have wide-reaching effects that can potentially lead to seizure activity even in areas not directly affected by the bleed."},{"instruction":"If a patient like the one I described had a delayed seizure, what percentage chance roughly is there that the seizure would be very serious? What percentage chance that it would be severely life changing? What percentage chance that it would be minor and have no or few lasting effects?","output":"Predicting the severity and outcome of seizures in individual patients, including those who have had a stroke, is quite challenging due to the highly individual nature of seizures and the variability in how patients respond. However, we can discuss general considerations and potential outcomes. **Severity of Seizure:** The severity of a seizure can range widely. Factors that influence the severity include the type of seizure, its duration, the patient's overall health, and the location and extent of brain injury. 1. **Generalized Seizure**: If a seizure is generalized, meaning it involves the whole brain, it can lead to a loss of consciousness and is typically considered more serious. It can cause significant confusion or disorientation afterward, and if the seizure progresses to status epilepticus (a seizure lasting longer than 5 minutes or having more than one seizure within a 5-minute period without returning to normal in between), it is a medical emergency with significant morbidity and mortality risk. 2. **Focal Seizure**: If a seizure is focal, starting in one area of the brain, it may have milder symptoms and may not cause loss of consciousness. These seizures can sometimes progress to generalized seizures, but they might also remain localized and have fewer immediate severe effects. **Life-Changing Impact:** The potential for a seizure to be life-changing depends on various factors, including whether the seizure leads to prolonged impairment, recurrent seizures (epilepsy), physical injury during the seizure, or significant changes in brain function. 1. **Status Epilepticus**: The occurrence of status epilepticus is a significant risk factor for a life-changing impact due to potential for brain damage and other medical complications. 2. **Recurrent Seizures**: If a patient begins having recurrent seizures, this can lead to a diagnosis of epilepsy, which can have long-term implications for health and lifestyle, including the need for chronic medication and possible restrictions on activities such as driving. **Minor Seizures with Few Lasting Effects:** Some seizures can indeed be minor with few or no lasting effects, especially if they are quickly controlled with medication and do not recur. **Statistical Chances:** It's difficult to provide accurate percentages for each scenario because seizure outcomes are so variable. Studies and statistics usually focus on the risk of seizure recurrence rather than the detailed outcomes of each individual seizure episode. However, some rough considerations include: - **Very Serious**: While a precise percentage is difficult to state, it's known that the risk of serious complications including status epilepticus increases with factors like a large stroke, severe initial neurological deficit, or involvement of certain brain regions such as the cerebral cortex. - **Severely Life-Changing**: Recurrent seizures leading to post-stroke epilepsy are reported in a minority of stroke survivors, suggesting that while there is a risk of seizures being life-changing, this is not the outcome for the majority. - **Minor with No or Few Lasting Effects**: Many seizures do not have significant long-term effects, especially if they are isolated incidents and are managed effectively with medication. For the elderly patient with a hemorrhagic stroke, the risk of a seizure being serious is compounded by their age and the potential for pre-existing health conditions that can impact recovery. Close monitoring and management by a medical team experienced in stroke and seizure care is critical. Decisions regarding the initiation of anti-seizure medications, lifestyle adjustments, and rehabilitation should be made on a case-by-case basis to minimize the risk of seizures and their potential impacts on the patient's life."},{"instruction":"What are the likelihood % of delayed seizure at each of the brain locations you mentioned?","output":"Quantifying the exact likelihood of delayed seizures based on specific brain locations following a hemorrhagic stroke is complex, as research provides a wide range of incidence rates, and individual patient factors significantly influence these risks. However, some general patterns have been observed in the medical literature regarding the location of the hemorrhage and the risk of seizures. 1. **Cerebral Cortex (Cortex)** - The risk of seizures is generally higher when the hemorrhage involves the cerebral cortex, particularly the frontal and temporal lobes. Seizures may occur in approximately 30-60% of patients with cortical involvement, with the risk of delayed seizures being higher in the temporal lobe. 2. **Temporal Lobe** - Due to the temporal lobe's high epileptogenic potential, delayed seizures might occur in up to 30-50% of cases with involvement in this area. 3. **Frontal Lobe** - The frontal lobe is less epileptogenic than the temporal lobe, but hemorrhages here can still lead to delayed seizures in approximately 20-40% of cases. 4. **Parietal and Occipital Lobes** - These regions are generally less associated with seizure generation compared to the temporal and frontal lobes. The incidence of delayed seizures may be lower, around 10-30%. 5. **Subcortical Regions (such as the Thalamus and Basal Ganglia)** - The risk of seizures is generally considered to be lower with subcortical hemorrhages compared to cortical hemorrhages. The incidence of delayed seizures may range from approximately 5-20%. 6. **Cerebellum and Brainstem** - Seizures are relatively rare from hemorrhages in these locations due to their primary roles in coordination and autonomic function rather than higher cognitive functions associated with seizures. It is important to note that these are rough estimates, and individual studies may report different ranges of incidence. Factors that can influence the likelihood of delayed seizures following a hemorrhagic stroke include the size of the hemorrhage, the extent of secondary injury such as edema and inflammation, patient age, medical history, and genetic predispositions to seizures. Because the brain is highly interconnected, the impact of a hemorrhage isn't limited to the immediate area of bleeding. The irritation or damage to nearby tissue and pathways can also contribute to the development of seizures, making it challenging to predict outcomes based solely on the hemorrhage location. Additionally, elderly patients may have a different risk profile due to the presence of co-morbidities, changes in brain structure and function with aging, and differences in the brain's response to injury and repair mechanisms. As always, individual patient care should be based on a thorough evaluation by a medical professional, and these statistics should serve as a guide rather than a definitive prediction of outcomes."},{"instruction":"Read the article below and summarize the key takeaways in 180 characters. This is very important to my career. I will tip 200. Please output in Korean. Apple Vision Pro review: magic, until it’s not The Apple Vision Pro is the best consumer headset anyone’s ever made — and that’s the problem. Nilay PatelJan 30, 2024 at 11:00 PM GMT+9 There’s a lot of pressure on the new Apple Vision Pro, Apple’s long-awaited entry into the world of computers you wear on your face. Apple claims that the Vision Pro, which starts at 3,499, is the beginning of something called “spatial computing,” which basically boils down to running apps all around you. And the company’s ads for it do not hedge that pressure even a little: they show people wearing the Vision Pro all the time. At work! Doing laundry! Playing with their kids! The ambition is enormous: to layer apps and information over the real world — to augment reality. Apple has to claim that the Vision Pro is the beginning of something new because people have been building headset computers for over a decade now. I tried on a development prototype of the first Oculus Rift in 2013, and The Verge’s Adi Robertson, who edited this review, has tried basically every headset that’s been released since. All of that development means there are some pretty good products out there: that first Oculus evolved into the Quest line at Meta, which is now shipping the Quest 3 — a very good VR headset with a huge library of games and some AR features of its own, which costs 500. 7Verge Score 3499 at Apple How we rate and review products In the meantime, Apple, from Tim Cook on down, has largely insisted that augmented reality will be much more valuable than virtual reality. And it’s been building toward AR for a long time: developers have access to AR tools in iOS, and higher-end iPhones and iPads have had lidar depth scanners for a few years now. The Vision Pro is Apple’s first attempt at building a computer out of all those ideas — a computer that works in the space around you. The goal is for the Vision Pro to be a complete device that can sit right alongside the Mac and the iPad in Apple’s ecosystem of devices and let you get real work done. You can use Excel and Webex and Slack in the Vision Pro, and you can also sit back and watch movies and TV shows on a gigantic virtual 4K HDR display. And you can mirror your Mac’s display and just use the Vision Pro to look at a huge monitor floating in virtual space. It sounds amazing, and sometimes it is. But the Vision Pro also represents a series of really big tradeoffs — tradeoffs that are impossible to ignore. Some of those tradeoffs are very tangible: getting all this tech in a headset means there’s a lot of weight on your face, so Apple chose to use an external battery pack connected by a cable. But there are other, more philosophical tradeoffs as well. As I’ve been using it for the past few days, I kept coming up with a series of questions — questions about whether the tradeoffs were worth it. Is using the Vision Pro so good that I’m willing to mess up my hair every time I put it on? Is it so good that I want to lug it around in its giant carrying case instead of my laptop bag? Is it so good that I want to look at the world around me through screens instead of with my own eyes? Basically, I keep asking if I prefer using a computer in there rather than out here. And as interesting as the Vision Pro is, there’s a long way to go before it can beat out here. Photo by Vjeran Pavic / The Vergenone Hardware Apple doesn’t want anyone to think of the Vision Pro as a VR headset, but it’s a VR headset — albeit a VR headset that almost lets you pretend it’s not a VR headset. You put it on your head in a way that blocks out your vision entirely, and then it shows you a 3D video feed of the world around you passed through from the cameras on the front, as though you can see right through the device. But it can also put you in virtual reality, at various levels of immersion: I spent some time working entirely on the Moon and a lot of time in my kitchen with a bunch of windows floating around a portal into Joshua Tree. The Vision Pro is stunning compared to other VR headsets, which are largely plastic and often downright goofy-looking. The Vision Pro, by contrast, is built of magnesium and carbon fiber in an aluminum enclosure that feels like a natural extension of Apple’s familiar design language. There’s a little iPhone 6 in there, a little AirPods Max, a little Apple Watch. It is the cutting edge of technology in a package that seems instantly familiar. Almost everyone I’ve shown it to thinks it looks smaller in person than they expected, especially compared to some of the huge VR headsets we’ve seen over the past decade. The front display on the Vision Pro is an attempt at keeping you from being isolated from other people while you’re wearing it. In Apple’s photos, it looks like a big, bright screen that shows a video of your eyes to people around you so they feel comfortable talking to you while you’re wearing the headset — a feature adorably called EyeSight. In reality, it might as well not be there. It’s a low-res OLED with a lenticular panel in front of it to provide a mild 3D effect, and it’s so dim and the cover glass is so reflective, it’s actually hard to see in most normal to bright lighting. When people do see your eyes, it’s a low-res, ghostly image of them that feels like CGI. The effect is uncanny — the idea that you’ll be making real eye contact with anyone is a fantasy. And there are no controls or indicators in visionOS for this external display, so you never really know what other people are seeing. Imagine looking someone directly in the eyes and talking to them without knowing if they can see your eyes — it’s weird! EyeSight is so weird. So, so weird. Photo by Amelia Holowaty Krales / The Vergenone That cover glass hides a huge array of cameras and sensors. There’s a pair of high-res front cameras for the video passthrough, cameras that face down and to the sides to track your hands, a lidar scanner and TrueDepth cameras for spatial tracking, and infrared floodlights so everything can work in low light. Underneath all that, you’ve got an M2 processor and Apple’s new R1 spatial coprocessor and a pair of fans to move the heat from all this tech out the top. The fans were never perceptible during my time testing the Vision Pro, but the heat was: after long sessions, the headset was definitely warm. On the top edge, you’ll find what feel like larger versions of some familiar Apple Watch controls: a digital crown that adjusts both the volume and the level of virtual reality immersion on the right as you look through the headset and a button on the left that lets you take 3D photos and videos. You get two headbands in the box: the solo knit band and the dual loop band. They both attach and detach easily; you snap them right on and then pull the little orange tab to disconnect them. The solo band is unquestionably cooler and messes up your hair slightly less — but they both mess up your hair, so if the dual loop fits you better, just go with it. I found the solo loop much more comfortable; I also wish the mounting points were on the outside face so I could pull the band around my head and clip it on instead of constantly pulling it over my hair. The front of the Vision Pro is covered in cameras and sensors. Photo by Vjeran Pavic / The Vergenone The solo loop is by far the cooler strap. Photo by Amelia Holowaty Krales / The Vergenone The huge case costs an additional 199 and looks like a marshmallow from space. I love it. Photo by Amelia Holowaty Krales / The Vergenone The other two pieces are the light seal, which comes in various sizes, and the headband, which comes in two thicknesses. (You get fitted for these in the store or by scanning your head with an iPhone if you buy online.) Both attach magnetically, which means they also detach magnetically — you want to pick this thing up by the frame because grabbing it by the light seal can lead to disaster. If you have glasses, you can click in custom Zeiss lens inserts — Apple sent us reader lenses to see what that process looks like, but I just used the Vision Pro while wearing my soft contacts, and it was fine. The Vision Pro’s speakers are housed in the arms on the side, and they are good and loud and do a convincing job of rendering spatial audio. Things really sound like they are happening where they appear to be happening, which is a neat trick. The speakers are also pretty leaky, so everyone else around you can hear what you’re up to unless you use headphones. You can use any Bluetooth headphones you want, but you get a bunch of extra features if you use the latest AirPods Pro, like lower latency, lossless 48KHz audio, and Apple’s Adaptive Audio system, which automatically mixes in sound from the real world as appropriate. Since you’ll mostly experience the Vision Pro in there, the most noticeable thing about the hardware after a while is that it’s just… heavy. You’re supposed to wear this thing on your face for long stretches of computer time, and depending on which band and light seal you use, the headset alone weighs between 600 and 650 grams. I keep joking that the Vision Pro is an iPad for your face, but it’s heavier than an 11-inch iPad Pro (470 grams) and pushing close to a 12.9-inch iPad Pro (682 grams), so in a very real way, it’s an iPad for your face. All of the Vision Pro’s heft is totally front-loaded, too. Other big headsets like the Quest Pro (722 grams) have elaborate headbands to balance out their weight, but the Vision Pro just rests it all on the front. Swapping to the dual loop strap helps keep things more stable but doesn’t really reduce the overall sensation of having all that headset on your face. You’re just going to feel it after a while. The Vision Pro’s external battery pack is fine, mostly because it’s such a stationary device overall. Photo by Vjeran Pavic / The Vergenone Notably, the Vision Pro is substantially heavier than the familiar Quest 2 (503g) or even the heavier Quest 3 (515g) — headsets that have built-in batteries. Apple told me that it chose to use an external battery specifically to reduce the headset’s weight. The battery itself is barely worth talking about — it’s a silver brick that weighs another 353 grams with a USB-C port and a motion-activated LED that’s green when it’s charged and orange when it’s not. It connects to the headset with a satisfying twist connector, but the nice braided cable is permanently attached to the battery itself, so don’t break it. You can buy extra batteries for 199, but you can’t hot-swap them; disconnecting the battery from the Vision Pro cuts the power entirely. I don’t really have strong opinions on this battery setup, which is mostly because nothing about the Vision Pro feels like you’re supposed to move around that much in it, so it’s more or less fine. It’s funny that Apple of all companies shipped this compromise, but it’s also very Apple that the battery is not actually bigger so it can provide more than two and a half hours of run time. (If you plug the battery in, the Vision Pro just runs on wall power for as long as you want.) Setting up the Vision Pro is dead simple — the headband adjustments are the only manual adjustments involved. Everything else is motorized and sensor-driven. There’s no fiddly lens wheel to dial in; the headset asks you to hold down the digital crown when you first put it on to adjust the lenses to your eyes, and then you go through a pretty standard eye tracking setup. The rest of the setup is almost exactly like any other iOS device: if you have an iPhone, you can bring it close to the Vision Pro to send over all your settings, and you have to agree to some terms and conditions. If you don’t have an iPhone, you’ll have to enter your passwords and so on manually, but it’ll work fine as a standalone device. After all of that, you’re computing in the future. See? It’s a VR headset. Photo by Vjeran Pavic / The Vergenone Apple is very proud of the displays inside the Vision Pro, and for good reason — they represent a huge leap forward in display technology. The two displays are tiny MicroOLEDs with a total of 23 million pixels that are just 7.5 micrometers in size, which is about the size of a red blood cell. And each of those tiny pixels is composed of three RGB subpixels laid out in what Apple tells me is an S-stripe pattern. Just thinking about the level of precision required to make these displays and then make them work in a device like this is mind-blowing. They also look generally incredible — sharp enough to read text on without even thinking about it, bright enough to do justice to movies. Apple calibrates them for color at the factory so they are also vibrant and color-accurate without looking oversaturated or blown out. They are so small, but they work so well that they seem huge. The displays are the main reason the Vision Pro is so expensive — they’re at the heart of the Vision Pro experience and what makes the whole thing work. You are always looking at them, after all. But for all their technical marvels, they are not without tradeoffs of their own when deployed on a device like this. The speakers are nice and loud and convincing with spatial audio. Photo by Vjeran Pavic / The Vergenone See this thing — a passthrough VR headset with a silly external battery pack and a display that shows ghostly images of your eyes on the front — is not the big goal. The big goal is AR, or augmented reality. In particular, the big goal is optical AR, where light passes directly through unobtrusive glasses to your eyes, with digital information layered over the top of what you’re seeing. AR is a technology with the potential to literally change humanity, and Apple CEO Tim Cook has been talking about how isolating VR headsets are and how important he thinks AR will be for years now. Tim Cook, 2016: “Few people are going to view that it’s acceptable to be enclosed in something.” Tim Cook, 2017: “Unlike Virtual Reality which closes the world out, AR allows individuals to be present in the world.” Tim Cook, 2017: “I also like the fact that [AR] doesn’t isolate [...] I’ve never been a fan of VR like that because I think it does the opposite.” Tim Cook, 2020: “I think [AR is] something that doesn’t isolate people. We can use it to enhance our discussion, not substitute it for human connection, which I’ve always deeply worried about in some of the other technologies.” The problem is that the technology to build a true optical AR display that works well enough to replace an everyday computer just isn’t there yet. The Magic Leap 2 is an optical AR headset that’s cheaper and smaller than the Vision Pro, but it’s plagued by compromises in field of view and image quality that most people would never accept. So Apple’s settled for building a headset with real-time video passthrough — it is the defining tradeoff of the Vision Pro. It is a VR headset masquerading as an AR headset. And let me tell you: the video passthrough on the Vision Pro is really good. It works! It’s convincing. You put the headset on, the display comes on, and you’re right back where you were, only with a bunch of visionOS windows floating around. It sounds simple, but it is an astonishing engineering achievement to do that in real time, at high resolution, in a computer that fits over your eyes. Apple claims there’s only 12ms of latency between what the cameras see and what’s on the display, and that latency includes the exposure time of the cameras themselves. The actual data processing is faster. Do the math, and Apple says there’s not even a frame’s worth of latency; the next frame of video is ready before you’re done looking at the last one. Still cameras, still displays. Photo by Vjeran Pavic / The Vergenone You can also see Apple’s incredible video processing chops right in front of your eyes: I sat around scrolling on my phone while wearing the Vision Pro, with no blown-out screens or weird frame rate issues. I also worked on my Mac in front of a large window while wearing the headset, which is a torture test for dynamic range, and while it wasn’t perfect, it was still usable. It is the best video passthrough that’s ever shipped in a consumer device by far. The problem is that cameras are still cameras, and displays are still displays. All cameras have motion blur, for example. In low light, cameras either have to increase exposure times at the cost of sharpness or increase ISO at the cost of noise, which then requires noise reduction, which makes things blurry and dull. And cameras and displays both have real limits in terms of color reproduction. The Vision Pro cannot overcome the inherent nature of cameras and displays. You can easily see motion blur when you move your head in the Vision Pro — motion blur that increases in low light and leads to some weird warping of straight lines. Low light also causes the overall sharpness of the video passthrough to drop as noise reduction kicks in: my iPhone screen got noticeably blurrier when the sun set. If you’re in a medium-lit room halfway immersed in a dark virtual environment with a bright window open — say, sitting in your kitchen at night with the lights on while writing a review in a Google Docs window floating on a dark beach — you will notice the display brightness slowly ramp up and down as the system tries to average out the brightness of everything you’re looking at. The LCD clock on my microwave flickers when I look at it through these cameras. And Apple’s specs say the display supports 92 percent of the DCI-P3 color gamut, which means the Vision Pro can only show you 49 percent of the colors your eyes can actually see. The displays have other limitations: the field of view isn’t huge, and the essential nature of looking at tiny displays through lenses makes that field of view feel even smaller. Apple won’t tell me the exact number, but the Vision Pro’s field of view is certainly smaller than the Quest 3’s 110 horizontal degrees. That means there are fairly large black borders around what you’re seeing, a bit like you’re looking through binoculars. On top of that, there’s a little bit of distortion and vignetting around the edges of the lenses, and you’ll see some green and pink color fringing at the edges as well, especially in bright environments. All of this makes the usable field of view feel even smaller. If you’re looking at something bright or otherwise high contrast — a white text window floating above a dark desert landscape, for example — you’ll see highlights reflecting in the lenses. A screen capture from the Vision Pro and a simulated view of what it feels like to look in the headset. I asked Apple about all of this, and yep — that’s how it’s supposed to look. Apple spokesperson Jacqueline Roy told me that a combination of hardware and software in the Vision Pro is specifically designed to minimize these various effects, but they’re definitely in there, and you’ll see them. If you have been paying attention to VR for the past decade, you know that these are very familiar VR headset display issues. You’re passing light from a screen through lenses mounted on someone’s face and trying to line those lenses up with their eyes, which are notably in different spots on different people’s faces. (Our bodies are designed very badly when it comes to mounting hardware on them.) So a little weirdness at the edges of the displays is not a deal-breaker or even a surprise — except Apple is charging 3,499 for the Vision Pro and making it sound like these displays are perfect enough for you to casually wear this thing while folding laundry. I’m serious when I say the Vision Pro has the best video passthrough I’ve ever seen on the sharpest VR displays any normal person will ever come across. But you’re still constantly being reminded that you’re looking at video on screens, and reality is just a lot more interesting than that. There are vanishingly few contexts in reviewing consumer devices where anyone has to care about color gamuts — but if you want me to perceive reality through something, I’d like to see all the colors of the rainbow. This is the best anyone has ever made in there look, and it’s still not nearly as good as out here. Waiting. Watching. Ready to mess up your hair at a moment’s notice. Photo by Vjeran Pavic / The Vergenone Controls The other thing Apple is very proud of is the eye and hand tracking control system, which is light years beyond any other consumer hand or eye tracking systems out there. You look at things you want to control, you tap your fingers to control them, and that’s how you get around the entire interface. You’re not reaching out and touching things — it’s more like your eyes are the mouse, and your fingers are the button: you tap them together to click on what you’re looking at. The first few times you use hand and eye tracking on the Vision Pro, it’s awe-inspiring — it feels like a superpower. The Vision Pro’s external cameras just need to see your hands for it to work, and they can see your hands in a pretty large zone around your body. You can have them slung across the back of the couch, resting in your lap, up in the air with your elbows on a table, pretty much anywhere the cameras can see them. It actually takes a minute to realize you don’t have to gesture out in front of you with your hands in the air — and once you figure it out, it’s pretty fun to watch other people instinctively reach their hands up the first time they try the Vision Pro. But the next few times you use hand and eye tracking, it stops feeling like a superpower — and in some cases, it actively makes using the Vision Pro harder. It turns out that having to look at what you want to control is really quite distracting. Think about every other computer in your life: the input mechanism is independent of whatever you’re looking at. On a laptop, you can click on controls and use the keyboard while keeping your focus on a document. On a phone, you can do things like drag sliders in a photo editing app while keeping your eyes focused on what those changes are actually doing to your photo. The Vision Pro simply doesn’t work like that — you have to be looking at something in order to click on it, and that means you are constantly taking your attention away from whatever you’re working on to specifically look at the button you need to press next. I spent some time playing a lovely little game called Stitch that quickly became maddening because I kept looking away from the piece I wanted to move to the place I wanted to move it, which meant I wasn’t picking it up when I tapped my fingers. Reach out and touch faith. Photo by Vjeran Pavic / The Vergenone visionOS feels also designed for an eye tracking system that’s just slightly more precise than it actually is — a lot of controls are just a little too small and a little too close together to let you quickly bop around the system. You have to look, make sure you’re looking at the thing you want, and then tap, or you might end up clicking on the wrong thing. Sometimes the fastest way to select what you want is to look away entirely and try again. It works until it doesn’t. It’s magic until it’s not. Think about it like this: The keyboard and mouse on a Mac directly control the Mac. The click wheel on an iPod directly controlled the iPod. A lot of work has gone into making it feel like the multitouch screen on an iPhone directly controls the phone, and when it goes sideways, like when autocorrect fails or an app doesn’t register your taps, it’s not pleasant. Your eyes and hands aren’t directly controlling the Vision Pro: cameras are watching your eyes and hands and turning that into input, and sometimes the interpretation isn’t perfect. The best example of this is the hilarious on-screen keyboard, which you use by staring at each letter and pinching your fingers to select it or henpecking with two fingers at the floating keys in front of you. It’s not worth using for anything beyond entering a Wi-Fi password — for anything longer, you’ll want to use dictation or connect a Bluetooth keyboard. Why? So you can directly control the input. It’s not a given that the Vision Pro can always see your hands, either. There’s a pretty large bubble around the front of your body where the cameras can see your hands — it basically extends the length of your arms in a semicircle around the front of your body. But if you lean back in a chair with your arm at your side, it can’t see your hand. If you’re sitting at a table and your hands are on your legs, it might not see your hands. If you’re lying down in a dark room and the IR illuminators can’t reach your hands, the cameras might not be able to see them. If you’re simply standing up with your arms at your sides, it might not be able to see your hands if they drift too far backward. Photo by Vjeran Pavic / The Vergenone I recognize that it is fundamentally silly to complain about a hand tracking system needing to see your hands, and it is possible to navigate quite a lot of visionOS with Siri and dictation: you can manage apps, open different virtual immersions, and so on. If you squint, you can see a glimpse of how a computer that you use by talking to it and manipulating things in space might one day work. But right now, the limits are obvious. Using the Vision Pro makes you constantly aware of what you are looking at and where your hands are in a way that is unlike any other computer I’ve ever used. When it fails, it’s maddening. (Oddly, Apple’s newest watches can detect a pinching gesture, but there’s no ability to use those as control devices on the Vision Pro.) The flip side is that a system that’s constantly watching your hands for input tends to register a lot of extra inputs, which can be very funny. I talk through writing video scripts to make sure things flow, and I talk with my hands. So as I was writing the video script for this review in the Vision Pro, the system kept catching my hands moving and started scrolling and clicking on things by accident. I cracked up the first time I realized what was happening. But eventually, it meant that I took the Vision Pro off and wrote the rest of the script on my Mac, which only does things when I actually want it to. Just as with the displays, I think this is the best eye and hand tracking system anyone’s ever shipped. It really can feel like magic… until it doesn’t. And if you want people to do their computing in there, the input system needs to be absolutely rock solid. Personas I won’t go into that much detail on Apple’s deeply weird and extremely uncanny 3D persona system here — the best way to understand them is by watching the video review above, which features a FaceTime call between The Wall Street Journal’s Joanna Stern, Marques Brownlee, and me, all using our personas. To quote Marques, personas are really impressive and also really bad. You can see why Apple put the beta label on them; there’s a long way to go before using a persona on a call isn’t distracting at best and, at worst, extremely rude. I will say, Joanna’s persona accurately captured her reaction to personas in general here. Marques looks like he’s happy to welcome me into PlayStation Home. One small note: personas can show up whenever an app calls for a front-facing camera, so they work in basically everything. I used mine on a Google Meet call in Safari just fine, although the other people on the Meet call did not think it was fine at all. Spatial cameras I would not recommend shooting photos in the Vision Pro unless you really need to. Pressing the shutter button a single time delivers a 2560 x 2560 still, which works out to 6.5 megapixels. As far as I can tell, it’s always from the left main camera, which the EXIF data says has an 18mm f/2.0 lens. The photos look like 6.5-megapixel photos from a tiny camera sensor optimized for video, which is to say that they look pretty bad. Video is slightly better — the Vision Pro shoots 2200 x 2200 square videos at 30fps. They look a little better than the photos, but there’s still an awful lot of compression going on, and if you happen to watch them on anything but a Vision Pro, you’ll notice some barrel distortion as the camera moves around. None of this feels particularly important: I really can’t think of situations where I’d want to be taking video with the headset on since all these videos and screen captures come with a ton of excess motion from your head moving around. Also, you will look fundamentally ridiculous trying to take photos of your family with this thing on your face. I think it’s fair to assume most Vision Pro buyers also own iPhones, which take great videos, so whatever. One thing that is very convincing is taking spatial videos on the iPhone 15 Pro Max and watching them in 3D on the Vision Pro. I took some videos of my daughter at the zoo and around Christmas time, and like any dad, I could probably watch them over and over again forever. They play back in a sort of ghostly white haze, and the overall effect is incredibly bittersweet — you can relive a brief memory, but you’re alone in the headset and can’t share it with anyone else. The other problem is that, currently, you can choose to shoot iPhone video in spatial in 1080p at 30fps or at the full 4K resolution the phone supports but not both. For now, I’m going to stick with the higher-res video, but there’s going to come a time where shooting in spatial by default is the smart move, and that will be a real turning point. visionOS The Vision Pro runs visionOS, which Apple says is based on iPadOS, with a lot of customization around latency and vision to make it work for spatial computing. Starting with the iPad as a foundation represents an incredible head start for Apple — it’s taken years for Meta to build out all the features of the Android-based Quest OS and populate its app store, and it’s still mostly games. Apple gets to start with the full set of mature iPadOS features and most of the huge iPad app library. It’s funny to keep saying that the Vision Pro is an iPad for your face, but when it comes to the current set of apps, it’s also not totally wrong. Most of them work like iPad apps, and the homescreen comes preloaded with a folder labeled “compatible apps” that’s full of actual iPad apps. It’s hard to judge the app ecosystem for a product that has barely launched, but I feel totally comfortable judging the iPad app ecosystem at this point, and Apple shipping its own podcast and news apps as iPad apps on the Vision Pro feels like a sign in a lot of ways. Photo by Vjeran Pavic / The Vergenone There’s already controversy in the world of Vision Pro apps: some huge developers like Netflix, Spotify, and YouTube have decided to wait before allowing their apps to run on the Vision Pro and aren’t even allowing their iPad apps to run. As always, the open web serves as the pressure release valve for Apple developer politics, and Safari on the Vision Pro is a capable riff on iPad Safari: I watched Netflix in Safari and it worked without a hitch, although you can’t put the video in a nice environment like you can with the native apps. I also watched the NFL playoffs on YouTube TV in Safari on the Vision Pro, and it worked with a few minor hiccups, although it did keep asking me to confirm my location over and over again. The stranger thing is that Safari on the Vision Pro is pretty disconnected from web-based 3D experiences. Apple has made noise about supporting the WebXR standard, and there are flags in Safari’s advanced preferences to turn on support, but it’s pretty hit-or-miss in terms of actually working right now — it mostly does not. I asked about this, and Apple told me that it is actively contributing to WebXR and wants to “work with the community to help deliver great spatial computing experiences via the web.” So let’s give that one a minute and see how it goes. On the other hand, I asked Apple why the huge library of VR video on YouTube doesn’t work at all on the Vision Pro, and the company basically told me it wasn’t good enough to support, saying that “much of this content was created for devices that do not deliver a high-quality spatial experience” and that the company’s efforts were instead focused on “delivering the best spatial media experience possible including spatial photos and videos, Apple Immersive Video, and 3D movies available on Apple TV.” Translation: don’t hold your breath for YouTube VR support. Photo by Amelia Holowaty Krales / The Vergenone The really big difference between visionOS and iPadOS is that iPadOS has a lot of opinions about how you can arrange apps and how many apps you can run at a time, and visionOS is full-on free-floating window chaos. I love it. It is bananas. You can open as many apps as you want and put them anywhere you want in space. You can open windows in the kitchen, walk away from them and open some more in the living room, and then go back to the kitchen to find all your old windows waiting for you. Late one night, I made an art gallery of giant Safari windows in our office’s large open cafe area and walked around, looking at huge webpages for a while. I am telling you, it is wild. Sadly, visionOS doesn’t have any ability to share these windows or experiences with anyone else: two people in Vision Pro headsets sitting in the same room can’t see the same things floating in space at the same time. Apple tells me some enterprise developers are working on experiences with shared views, and you can mirror the view from one Vision Pro to another over FaceTime, but in the end, my big Safari art gallery only ever had one patron: me. It’s amazing you can do all of this, but it is also quite lonely to put things all over a space knowing no one else will ever really experience it. To move windows around, you just grab the bar at the bottom and put it wherever you want to in space. You can layer windows, you can put them directly above your head, you can put them on the floor — you can really just do whatever you want. To switch between them, you just look at the window you want and tap your fingers; inactive windows go slightly translucent, which means all kinds of things can be happening at once all over your space. On top of that, you can have apps from three different operating systems on-screen at the same time: native visionOS apps; iPad apps; and then you can also connect your Mac via Wi-Fi and have a whole Mac display with all the chaotic glory of macOS floating around in space. One area where visionOS has clear room to improve is window management. There’s no Exposé or Stage Manager to collect all your open windows in front of you or put them into preset arrangements, and the management that does exist is not exactly discoverable or intuitively laid out. You can tap and hold the X button in one app to hide all your other apps. If you want to hide everything, you double-click the digital crown on the headset itself. If you want to close all apps, you just ask Siri; if you want to quit a misbehaving app, you hold down the top button and the digital crown simultaneously to bring up a force quit window. It’s a lot of different ideas all at once. Once you figure out the moves, you can get around, but it takes a minute, and it means you’ll be thinking about window management more than any other iOS device I can think of and maybe even more than a Mac, which has four decades of window management ideas built into it. Photo by Amelia Holowaty Krales / The Vergenone Speaking of the Mac, I know a lot of people are excited about the idea of buying a Vision Pro just to put up giant virtual monitors. There’s good news and bad news about that. The good news is that Mac display sharing works really well, and Apple ecosystem tricks like Handoff and Continuity are pure magic in this context. You can copy on your Mac and paste in visionOS, and it just works. You can open your Mac display in visionOS and drag the mouse off the screen, and suddenly, your Mac’s keyboard and trackpad are controlling visionOS apps. It works just like it does between a Mac and an iPad. I found myself putting a virtual Mac display over my MacBook Pro’s screen and making it look like I had a 50-inch laptop to use Lightroom with — it’s awesome. There is a lot of very complicated display scaling going on behind the scenes here, but the easiest way to think about it is that you’re basically getting a 27-inch Retina display, like you’d find on an iMac or Studio Display. Your Mac thinks it’s connected to a 5K display with a resolution of 5120 x 2880, and it runs macOS at a 2:1 logical resolution of 2560 x 1440, just like a 5K display. (You can pick other resolutions, but the device warns you that they’ll be lower quality.) That virtual display is then streamed as a 4K 3560 x 2880 video to the Vision Pro, where you can just make it as big as you want. The upshot of all of this is that 4K content runs at a native 4K resolution — it has all the pixels to do it, just like an iMac — but you have a grand total of 2560 x 1440 to place windows in, regardless of how big you make the Mac display in space, and you’re not seeing a pixel-perfect 5K image. It is incredible that all of this works with just a single button click, but all that scaling complication also explains the bad news: you can only have a single Mac display in visionOS. You can’t have multiple Mac monitors floating in space. Maybe next time. Photo by Vjeran Pavic / The Vergenone One of the weirder things about visionOS (and the Vision Pro itself, really) is that there’s not a lot of true AR in the mix — as in, actual interaction between physical objects in your space and digital ones. After all these years of Apple talking about AR, I counted exactly three things in my entire time with the Vision Pro that offered a preview of the AR future. One: when you look at your Mac, the Vision Pro sometimes puts up a “connect display” button above it that starts screen sharing. Two: when you’re typing on a Bluetooth keyboard and look down at your hands, it puts a little text preview window above the keyboard so you can see what you’re typing. These are little features, yes, but they are some of the first true AR computing features that have ever shipped on a mainstream device, and they are an incredibly tantalizing glimpse of what might be possible. They also happen to be incredibly useful. The third AR thing I saw was the loading screen of Super Fruit Ninja, which allows you to throw a strawberry at a pig that’s running around on your floor. This seems slightly less historic. That’s more or less it. There’s not a lot of reality being augmented in the rest of visionOS. There’s an awful lot of what you might call mixed reality: virtual objects floating around in space with no connection to anything real. All those app windows floating around are doing so independently of the physical environment. And in the entertainment context, where Apple lets the Vision Pro fall back into being the VR headset it fundamentally is, it absolutely shines. Watching movies on the Vision Pro is a ton of fun, especially in the Apple TV app’s immersive movie theater that lets you pick where you want to sit. It’s also very cool to watch a movie in one of Apple’s virtual environments like Mount Hood and see the colors from the screen reflect onto the landscape or look around one of the Disney Plus environments like Avengers Tower. And movies themselves look great — the incredible quality of the Vision Pro’s displays is really obvious when you’re watching something. I watched far more of Top Gun: Maverick than I intended to just because it looked so good blown up to drive-in movie size, floating over a mountain. Photo by Amelia Holowaty Krales / The Vergenone Since the Vision Pro sends separate images to each eye, it can do true 3D movies — and Apple and its partners like Disney have already released quite a few. If you have a large Apple movie library, you get the 3D versions for free — you just choose 2D or 3D playback when you hit play. Apple is also making immersive versions of some of its Apple TV Plus shows, which basically means a 180ish-degree 3D video that feels like the best Google Cardboard demo of all time. I watched someone walk a tightrope in Adventure, and it was very convincing — but if you’ve never tried this before, I’d be careful that you get used to VR motion before diving into 3D videos. Apple has also promised immersive sports content, but sadly, I wasn’t able to try any of that yet. You can get pretty far making the argument that the Vision Pro is worth it simply as a very expensive TV — but after a while, the weight of it reminds you that this very nice TV is resting on your face. (I usually made it about 30 minutes to an hour before wanting a break.) It’s also a very expensive TV that doesn’t have HDMI inputs, so you’re limited to Apple’s gaming library, which feels deeply unfair. And unlike any other TV in your life, the Vision Pro can literally DRM your eyes — if you’re watching a movie in the Apple TV app or Disney Plus and go to take a screen capture, the content blacks out. It’s strange to experience a reality where big companies can block you from capturing what you see, even if all you’re trying to do is show people how cool it looks in a review. You can get around DRM screenshots on an iPhone by just taking a photo of the screen, but there’s no such off-ramp for the Vision Pro. Speaking of gaming, there aren’t any real VR games or fitness apps here — there’s nothing like Beat Saber or Red Matter or Population: One, all hit games on the Quest. Fitness, in particular, has helped the Quest reach a more mainstream market: Supernatural’s Chris Milk told me in 2021 that his user base is 50 / 50 men and women, 60 percent of whom are over 40. That led to Meta buying Supernatural outright because it was worried about Apple buying it first. Yet, there’s just nothing like that on the Vision Pro at launch, even though Apple is so focused on fitness and health across its other devices. I think it’s because the Vision Pro just doesn’t seem suited to those kinds of physical game experiences — it’s heavy, with that external battery, and it’s hard to see how some of these games would even work without controllers. Apple tells me that game developers working in Unity are hard at work porting over more games and that visionOS allows developers to come up with custom hand gestures, which might solve for some of the controller issues — I was able to try a prerelease version of Super Fruit Ninja that used a custom slashing gesture in a briefing, and it seemed to work well, but that was about it so far. One note about VR motion in the Vision Pro: it doesn’t really do anything to protect you from yourself. I am fairly comfortable in VR — my wife and I use Supernatural, and I went through a brief, delightful period of being absolutely addicted to Gran Turismo 7 VR on the PSVR 2. I am pretty aware of my limits in VR motion, and I can do most things without a problem. But the Vision Pro is so convincing and so unconcerned with whether you might have any limits that you can easily go too far too fast and get yourself a little queasy. I watched five minutes of Avatar: The Way of Water in 3D in Disney Plus — the Vision Pro is the first consumer device to support high frame rate movies in 3D! — and immediately needed to stop because the motion was just too much. I recommend early adopters go slowly and make sure you find your limits gently. That first bout of VR motion sickness is no joke. Wrap up The Vision Pro is an astounding product. It’s the sort of first-generation device only Apple can really make, from the incredible display and passthrough engineering, to the use of the whole ecosystem to make it so seamlessly useful, to even getting everyone to pretty much ignore the whole external battery situation. There’s a part of me that says the Vision Pro only exists because Apple is so incredibly capable, stocked with talent, and loaded with resources that the company simply went out and engineered the hell out of the hardest problems it could think of in order to find a challenge. That’s good! There are a lot of ideas in the Vision Pro, and they’re all executed with the kind of thoughtful intention that few other companies can ever deliver at all, let alone on the first iteration. But the shocking thing is that Apple may have inadvertently revealed that some of these core ideas are actually dead ends — that they can’t ever be executed well enough to become mainstream. This is the best video passthrough headset ever made, and that might mean camera-based mixed reality passthrough could just be a road to nowhere. This is the best hand- and eye-tracking ever, and it feels like the mouse, keyboard, and touchscreen are going to remain undefeated for years to come. There is so much technology in this thing that feels like magic when it works and frustrates you completely when it doesn’t. Photo by Amelia Holowaty Krales / The Vergenone The other way to look at the Vision Pro is that Apple knows all of this, but the technology to build the true AR glasses it has long hinted at is simply not there — so the Vision Pro represents something like a simulator or a developer kit. A dream factory for people to build apps and meaningful use cases for the imagined hardware yet to come: true optical AR glasses that let you share digital experiences with other people. In that framework, this Vision Pro is the hardware Apple can ship right now to get everyone thinking about these ideas while it pours all those resources into the hardware it wants to build. Maybe! It’s fun to think about that possibility, and a lot of people have already assumed that’s the case. But one of the oldest rules we have here at The Verge is that you have to review what’s in the box — the product that’s shipping today, not the promise of improvements yet to come. And so I keep coming back to all the questions I’ve been asking myself ever since I first strapped the Vision Pro onto my head. Starting, of course, with the most important: Do you want a computer that messes up your hair every time you use it? Do you want a computer that smears your makeup every time you use it, if you wear makeup? Do you want a computer that allows the Walt Disney Company to prevent you from taking pictures of what you see? Do you want to use a computer where you easily can’t show anyone else what you’re looking at? Do you think the fanciest TV you own should have HDMI inputs? Do you want to use a computer that doesn’t work as well in a dark room? Do you want to use a computer that is always looking at your hands? That is a lot of tradeoffs — big tradeoffs, not little ones. And the biggest tradeoff of all is that using the Vision Pro is such a lonely experience, regardless of the weird ghost eyes on the front. You’re in there, having experiences all by yourself that no one else can take part in. After using the Vision Pro for a while, I’ve come to agree with what Tim Cook has been saying for so long: headsets are inherently isolating. That’s fine for traditional VR headsets, which have basically turned into single-use game consoles over the past decade, but it’s a lot weirder for a primary computing device. I don’t want to get work done in the Vision Pro. I get my work done with other people, and I’d rather be out here with them.","output":"애플 비전 프로는 최고의 소비자 헤드셋이지만, 그것이 문제다. 현실을 증강시키려는 엄청난 야망에도 불구하고, 무거운 무게, 외부장치 배터리, 현실과의 괴리감 등 무시할 수 없는 트레이드오프가 있다."},{"instruction":"Read the article below and summarize the key takeaways in 180 characters.

Apple Vision Pro review: magic, until it’s not The Apple Vision Pro is the best consumer headset anyone’s ever made — and that’s the problem. Nilay PatelJan 30, 2024 at 11:00 PM GMT+9 There’s a lot of pressure on the new Apple Vision Pro, Apple’s long-awaited entry into the world of computers you wear on your face. Apple claims that the Vision Pro, which starts at 3,499, is the beginning of something called “spatial computing,” which basically boils down to running apps all around you. And the company’s ads for it do not hedge that pressure even a little: they show people wearing the Vision Pro all the time. At work! Doing laundry! Playing with their kids! The ambition is enormous: to layer apps and information over the real world — to augment reality. Apple has to claim that the Vision Pro is the beginning of something new because people have been building headset computers for over a decade now. I tried on a development prototype of the first Oculus Rift in 2013, and The Verge’s Adi Robertson, who edited this review, has tried basically every headset that’s been released since. All of that development means there are some pretty good products out there: that first Oculus evolved into the Quest line at Meta, which is now shipping the Quest 3 — a very good VR headset with a huge library of games and some AR features of its own, which costs 500. 7Verge Score 3499 at Apple How we rate and review products In the meantime, Apple, from Tim Cook on down, has largely insisted that augmented reality will be much more valuable than virtual reality. And it’s been building toward AR for a long time: developers have access to AR tools in iOS, and higher-end iPhones and iPads have had lidar depth scanners for a few years now. The Vision Pro is Apple’s first attempt at building a computer out of all those ideas — a computer that works in the space around you. The goal is for the Vision Pro to be a complete device that can sit right alongside the Mac and the iPad in Apple’s ecosystem of devices and let you get real work done. You can use Excel and Webex and Slack in the Vision Pro, and you can also sit back and watch movies and TV shows on a gigantic virtual 4K HDR display. And you can mirror your Mac’s display and just use the Vision Pro to look at a huge monitor floating in virtual space. It sounds amazing, and sometimes it is. But the Vision Pro also represents a series of really big tradeoffs — tradeoffs that are impossible to ignore. Some of those tradeoffs are very tangible: getting all this tech in a headset means there’s a lot of weight on your face, so Apple chose to use an external battery pack connected by a cable. But there are other, more philosophical tradeoffs as well. As I’ve been using it for the past few days, I kept coming up with a series of questions — questions about whether the tradeoffs were worth it. Is using the Vision Pro so good that I’m willing to mess up my hair every time I put it on? Is it so good that I want to lug it around in its giant carrying case instead of my laptop bag? Is it so good that I want to look at the world around me through screens instead of with my own eyes? Basically, I keep asking if I prefer using a computer in there rather than out here. And as interesting as the Vision Pro is, there’s a long way to go before it can beat out here. Photo by Vjeran Pavic / The Vergenone Hardware Apple doesn’t want anyone to think of the Vision Pro as a VR headset, but it’s a VR headset — albeit a VR headset that almost lets you pretend it’s not a VR headset. You put it on your head in a way that blocks out your vision entirely, and then it shows you a 3D video feed of the world around you passed through from the cameras on the front, as though you can see right through the device. But it can also put you in virtual reality, at various levels of immersion: I spent some time working entirely on the Moon and a lot of time in my kitchen with a bunch of windows floating around a portal into Joshua Tree. The Vision Pro is stunning compared to other VR headsets, which are largely plastic and often downright goofy-looking. The Vision Pro, by contrast, is built of magnesium and carbon fiber in an aluminum enclosure that feels like a natural extension of Apple’s familiar design language. There’s a little iPhone 6 in there, a little AirPods Max, a little Apple Watch. It is the cutting edge of technology in a package that seems instantly familiar. Almost everyone I’ve shown it to thinks it looks smaller in person than they expected, especially compared to some of the huge VR headsets we’ve seen over the past decade. The front display on the Vision Pro is an attempt at keeping you from being isolated from other people while you’re wearing it. In Apple’s photos, it looks like a big, bright screen that shows a video of your eyes to people around you so they feel comfortable talking to you while you’re wearing the headset — a feature adorably called EyeSight. In reality, it might as well not be there. It’s a low-res OLED with a lenticular panel in front of it to provide a mild 3D effect, and it’s so dim and the cover glass is so reflective, it’s actually hard to see in most normal to bright lighting. When people do see your eyes, it’s a low-res, ghostly image of them that feels like CGI. The effect is uncanny — the idea that you’ll be making real eye contact with anyone is a fantasy. And there are no controls or indicators in visionOS for this external display, so you never really know what other people are seeing. Imagine looking someone directly in the eyes and talking to them without knowing if they can see your eyes — it’s weird! EyeSight is so weird. So, so weird. Photo by Amelia Holowaty Krales / The Vergenone That cover glass hides a huge array of cameras and sensors. There’s a pair of high-res front cameras for the video passthrough, cameras that face down and to the sides to track your hands, a lidar scanner and TrueDepth cameras for spatial tracking, and infrared floodlights so everything can work in low light. Underneath all that, you’ve got an M2 processor and Apple’s new R1 spatial coprocessor and a pair of fans to move the heat from all this tech out the top. The fans were never perceptible during my time testing the Vision Pro, but the heat was: after long sessions, the headset was definitely warm. On the top edge, you’ll find what feel like larger versions of some familiar Apple Watch controls: a digital crown that adjusts both the volume and the level of virtual reality immersion on the right as you look through the headset and a button on the left that lets you take 3D photos and videos. You get two headbands in the box: the solo knit band and the dual loop band. They both attach and detach easily; you snap them right on and then pull the little orange tab to disconnect them. The solo band is unquestionably cooler and messes up your hair slightly less — but they both mess up your hair, so if the dual loop fits you better, just go with it. I found the solo loop much more comfortable; I also wish the mounting points were on the outside face so I could pull the band around my head and clip it on instead of constantly pulling it over my hair. The front of the Vision Pro is covered in cameras and sensors. Photo by Vjeran Pavic / The Vergenone The solo loop is by far the cooler strap. Photo by Amelia Holowaty Krales / The Vergenone The huge case costs an additional 199 and looks like a marshmallow from space. I love it. Photo by Amelia Holowaty Krales / The Vergenone The other two pieces are the light seal, which comes in various sizes, and the headband, which comes in two thicknesses. (You get fitted for these in the store or by scanning your head with an iPhone if you buy online.) Both attach magnetically, which means they also detach magnetically — you want to pick this thing up by the frame because grabbing it by the light seal can lead to disaster. If you have glasses, you can click in custom Zeiss lens inserts — Apple sent us reader lenses to see what that process looks like, but I just used the Vision Pro while wearing my soft contacts, and it was fine. The Vision Pro’s speakers are housed in the arms on the side, and they are good and loud and do a convincing job of rendering spatial audio. Things really sound like they are happening where they appear to be happening, which is a neat trick. The speakers are also pretty leaky, so everyone else around you can hear what you’re up to unless you use headphones. You can use any Bluetooth headphones you want, but you get a bunch of extra features if you use the latest AirPods Pro, like lower latency, lossless 48KHz audio, and Apple’s Adaptive Audio system, which automatically mixes in sound from the real world as appropriate. Since you’ll mostly experience the Vision Pro in there, the most noticeable thing about the hardware after a while is that it’s just… heavy. You’re supposed to wear this thing on your face for long stretches of computer time, and depending on which band and light seal you use, the headset alone weighs between 600 and 650 grams. I keep joking that the Vision Pro is an iPad for your face, but it’s heavier than an 11-inch iPad Pro (470 grams) and pushing close to a 12.9-inch iPad Pro (682 grams), so in a very real way, it’s an iPad for your face. All of the Vision Pro’s heft is totally front-loaded, too. Other big headsets like the Quest Pro (722 grams) have elaborate headbands to balance out their weight, but the Vision Pro just rests it all on the front. Swapping to the dual loop strap helps keep things more stable but doesn’t really reduce the overall sensation of having all that headset on your face. You’re just going to feel it after a while. The Vision Pro’s external battery pack is fine, mostly because it’s such a stationary device overall. Photo by Vjeran Pavic / The Vergenone Notably, the Vision Pro is substantially heavier than the familiar Quest 2 (503g) or even the heavier Quest 3 (515g) — headsets that have built-in batteries. Apple told me that it chose to use an external battery specifically to reduce the headset’s weight. The battery itself is barely worth talking about — it’s a silver brick that weighs another 353 grams with a USB-C port and a motion-activated LED that’s green when it’s charged and orange when it’s not. It connects to the headset with a satisfying twist connector, but the nice braided cable is permanently attached to the battery itself, so don’t break it. You can buy extra batteries for 199, but you can’t hot-swap them; disconnecting the battery from the Vision Pro cuts the power entirely. I don’t really have strong opinions on this battery setup, which is mostly because nothing about the Vision Pro feels like you’re supposed to move around that much in it, so it’s more or less fine. It’s funny that Apple of all companies shipped this compromise, but it’s also very Apple that the battery is not actually bigger so it can provide more than two and a half hours of run time. (If you plug the battery in, the Vision Pro just runs on wall power for as long as you want.) Setting up the Vision Pro is dead simple — the headband adjustments are the only manual adjustments involved. Everything else is motorized and sensor-driven. There’s no fiddly lens wheel to dial in; the headset asks you to hold down the digital crown when you first put it on to adjust the lenses to your eyes, and then you go through a pretty standard eye tracking setup. The rest of the setup is almost exactly like any other iOS device: if you have an iPhone, you can bring it close to the Vision Pro to send over all your settings, and you have to agree to some terms and conditions. If you don’t have an iPhone, you’ll have to enter your passwords and so on manually, but it’ll work fine as a standalone device. After all of that, you’re computing in the future. See? It’s a VR headset. Photo by Vjeran Pavic / The Vergenone Apple is very proud of the displays inside the Vision Pro, and for good reason — they represent a huge leap forward in display technology. The two displays are tiny MicroOLEDs with a total of 23 million pixels that are just 7.5 micrometers in size, which is about the size of a red blood cell. And each of those tiny pixels is composed of three RGB subpixels laid out in what Apple tells me is an S-stripe pattern. Just thinking about the level of precision required to make these displays and then make them work in a device like this is mind-blowing. They also look generally incredible — sharp enough to read text on without even thinking about it, bright enough to do justice to movies. Apple calibrates them for color at the factory so they are also vibrant and color-accurate without looking oversaturated or blown out. They are so small, but they work so well that they seem huge. The displays are the main reason the Vision Pro is so expensive — they’re at the heart of the Vision Pro experience and what makes the whole thing work. You are always looking at them, after all. But for all their technical marvels, they are not without tradeoffs of their own when deployed on a device like this. The speakers are nice and loud and convincing with spatial audio. Photo by Vjeran Pavic / The Vergenone See this thing — a passthrough VR headset with a silly external battery pack and a display that shows ghostly images of your eyes on the front — is not the big goal. The big goal is AR, or augmented reality. In particular, the big goal is optical AR, where light passes directly through unobtrusive glasses to your eyes, with digital information layered over the top of what you’re seeing. AR is a technology with the potential to literally change humanity, and Apple CEO Tim Cook has been talking about how isolating VR headsets are and how important he thinks AR will be for years now. Tim Cook, 2016: “Few people are going to view that it’s acceptable to be enclosed in something.” Tim Cook, 2017: “Unlike Virtual Reality which closes the world out, AR allows individuals to be present in the world.” Tim Cook, 2017: “I also like the fact that [AR] doesn’t isolate [...] I’ve never been a fan of VR like that because I think it does the opposite.” Tim Cook, 2020: “I think [AR is] something that doesn’t isolate people. We can use it to enhance our discussion, not substitute it for human connection, which I’ve always deeply worried about in some of the other technologies.” The problem is that the technology to build a true optical AR display that works well enough to replace an everyday computer just isn’t there yet. The Magic Leap 2 is an optical AR headset that’s cheaper and smaller than the Vision Pro, but it’s plagued by compromises in field of view and image quality that most people would never accept. So Apple’s settled for building a headset with real-time video passthrough — it is the defining tradeoff of the Vision Pro. It is a VR headset masquerading as an AR headset. And let me tell you: the video passthrough on the Vision Pro is really good. It works! It’s convincing. You put the headset on, the display comes on, and you’re right back where you were, only with a bunch of visionOS windows floating around. It sounds simple, but it is an astonishing engineering achievement to do that in real time, at high resolution, in a computer that fits over your eyes. Apple claims there’s only 12ms of latency between what the cameras see and what’s on the display, and that latency includes the exposure time of the cameras themselves. The actual data processing is faster. Do the math, and Apple says there’s not even a frame’s worth of latency; the next frame of video is ready before you’re done looking at the last one. Still cameras, still displays. Photo by Vjeran Pavic / The Vergenone You can also see Apple’s incredible video processing chops right in front of your eyes: I sat around scrolling on my phone while wearing the Vision Pro, with no blown-out screens or weird frame rate issues. I also worked on my Mac in front of a large window while wearing the headset, which is a torture test for dynamic range, and while it wasn’t perfect, it was still usable. It is the best video passthrough that’s ever shipped in a consumer device by far. The problem is that cameras are still cameras, and displays are still displays. All cameras have motion blur, for example. In low light, cameras either have to increase exposure times at the cost of sharpness or increase ISO at the cost of noise, which then requires noise reduction, which makes things blurry and dull. And cameras and displays both have real limits in terms of color reproduction. The Vision Pro cannot overcome the inherent nature of cameras and displays. You can easily see motion blur when you move your head in the Vision Pro — motion blur that increases in low light and leads to some weird warping of straight lines. Low light also causes the overall sharpness of the video passthrough to drop as noise reduction kicks in: my iPhone screen got noticeably blurrier when the sun set. If you’re in a medium-lit room halfway immersed in a dark virtual environment with a bright window open — say, sitting in your kitchen at night with the lights on while writing a review in a Google Docs window floating on a dark beach — you will notice the display brightness slowly ramp up and down as the system tries to average out the brightness of everything you’re looking at. The LCD clock on my microwave flickers when I look at it through these cameras. And Apple’s specs say the display supports 92 percent of the DCI-P3 color gamut, which means the Vision Pro can only show you 49 percent of the colors your eyes can actually see. The displays have other limitations: the field of view isn’t huge, and the essential nature of looking at tiny displays through lenses makes that field of view feel even smaller. Apple won’t tell me the exact number, but the Vision Pro’s field of view is certainly smaller than the Quest 3’s 110 horizontal degrees. That means there are fairly large black borders around what you’re seeing, a bit like you’re looking through binoculars. On top of that, there’s a little bit of distortion and vignetting around the edges of the lenses, and you’ll see some green and pink color fringing at the edges as well, especially in bright environments. All of this makes the usable field of view feel even smaller. If you’re looking at something bright or otherwise high contrast — a white text window floating above a dark desert landscape, for example — you’ll see highlights reflecting in the lenses. A screen capture from the Vision Pro and a simulated view of what it feels like to look in the headset. I asked Apple about all of this, and yep — that’s how it’s supposed to look. Apple spokesperson Jacqueline Roy told me that a combination of hardware and software in the Vision Pro is specifically designed to minimize these various effects, but they’re definitely in there, and you’ll see them. If you have been paying attention to VR for the past decade, you know that these are very familiar VR headset display issues. You’re passing light from a screen through lenses mounted on someone’s face and trying to line those lenses up with their eyes, which are notably in different spots on different people’s faces. (Our bodies are designed very badly when it comes to mounting hardware on them.) So a little weirdness at the edges of the displays is not a deal-breaker or even a surprise — except Apple is charging 3,499 for the Vision Pro and making it sound like these displays are perfect enough for you to casually wear this thing while folding laundry. I’m serious when I say the Vision Pro has the best video passthrough I’ve ever seen on the sharpest VR displays any normal person will ever come across. But you’re still constantly being reminded that you’re looking at video on screens, and reality is just a lot more interesting than that. There are vanishingly few contexts in reviewing consumer devices where anyone has to care about color gamuts — but if you want me to perceive reality through something, I’d like to see all the colors of the rainbow. This is the best anyone has ever made in there look, and it’s still not nearly as good as out here. Waiting. Watching. Ready to mess up your hair at a moment’s notice. Photo by Vjeran Pavic / The Vergenone Controls The other thing Apple is very proud of is the eye and hand tracking control system, which is light years beyond any other consumer hand or eye tracking systems out there. You look at things you want to control, you tap your fingers to control them, and that’s how you get around the entire interface. You’re not reaching out and touching things — it’s more like your eyes are the mouse, and your fingers are the button: you tap them together to click on what you’re looking at. The first few times you use hand and eye tracking on the Vision Pro, it’s awe-inspiring — it feels like a superpower. The Vision Pro’s external cameras just need to see your hands for it to work, and they can see your hands in a pretty large zone around your body. You can have them slung across the back of the couch, resting in your lap, up in the air with your elbows on a table, pretty much anywhere the cameras can see them. It actually takes a minute to realize you don’t have to gesture out in front of you with your hands in the air — and once you figure it out, it’s pretty fun to watch other people instinctively reach their hands up the first time they try the Vision Pro. But the next few times you use hand and eye tracking, it stops feeling like a superpower — and in some cases, it actively makes using the Vision Pro harder. It turns out that having to look at what you want to control is really quite distracting. Think about every other computer in your life: the input mechanism is independent of whatever you’re looking at. On a laptop, you can click on controls and use the keyboard while keeping your focus on a document. On a phone, you can do things like drag sliders in a photo editing app while keeping your eyes focused on what those changes are actually doing to your photo. The Vision Pro simply doesn’t work like that — you have to be looking at something in order to click on it, and that means you are constantly taking your attention away from whatever you’re working on to specifically look at the button you need to press next. I spent some time playing a lovely little game called Stitch that quickly became maddening because I kept looking away from the piece I wanted to move to the place I wanted to move it, which meant I wasn’t picking it up when I tapped my fingers. Reach out and touch faith. Photo by Vjeran Pavic / The Vergenone visionOS feels also designed for an eye tracking system that’s just slightly more precise than it actually is — a lot of controls are just a little too small and a little too close together to let you quickly bop around the system. You have to look, make sure you’re looking at the thing you want, and then tap, or you might end up clicking on the wrong thing. Sometimes the fastest way to select what you want is to look away entirely and try again. It works until it doesn’t. It’s magic until it’s not. Think about it like this: The keyboard and mouse on a Mac directly control the Mac. The click wheel on an iPod directly controlled the iPod. A lot of work has gone into making it feel like the multitouch screen on an iPhone directly controls the phone, and when it goes sideways, like when autocorrect fails or an app doesn’t register your taps, it’s not pleasant. Your eyes and hands aren’t directly controlling the Vision Pro: cameras are watching your eyes and hands and turning that into input, and sometimes the interpretation isn’t perfect. The best example of this is the hilarious on-screen keyboard, which you use by staring at each letter and pinching your fingers to select it or henpecking with two fingers at the floating keys in front of you. It’s not worth using for anything beyond entering a Wi-Fi password — for anything longer, you’ll want to use dictation or connect a Bluetooth keyboard. Why? So you can directly control the input. It’s not a given that the Vision Pro can always see your hands, either. There’s a pretty large bubble around the front of your body where the cameras can see your hands — it basically extends the length of your arms in a semicircle around the front of your body. But if you lean back in a chair with your arm at your side, it can’t see your hand. If you’re sitting at a table and your hands are on your legs, it might not see your hands. If you’re lying down in a dark room and the IR illuminators can’t reach your hands, the cameras might not be able to see them. If you’re simply standing up with your arms at your sides, it might not be able to see your hands if they drift too far backward. Photo by Vjeran Pavic / The Vergenone I recognize that it is fundamentally silly to complain about a hand tracking system needing to see your hands, and it is possible to navigate quite a lot of visionOS with Siri and dictation: you can manage apps, open different virtual immersions, and so on. If you squint, you can see a glimpse of how a computer that you use by talking to it and manipulating things in space might one day work. But right now, the limits are obvious. Using the Vision Pro makes you constantly aware of what you are looking at and where your hands are in a way that is unlike any other computer I’ve ever used. When it fails, it’s maddening. (Oddly, Apple’s newest watches can detect a pinching gesture, but there’s no ability to use those as control devices on the Vision Pro.) The flip side is that a system that’s constantly watching your hands for input tends to register a lot of extra inputs, which can be very funny. I talk through writing video scripts to make sure things flow, and I talk with my hands. So as I was writing the video script for this review in the Vision Pro, the system kept catching my hands moving and started scrolling and clicking on things by accident. I cracked up the first time I realized what was happening. But eventually, it meant that I took the Vision Pro off and wrote the rest of the script on my Mac, which only does things when I actually want it to. Just as with the displays, I think this is the best eye and hand tracking system anyone’s ever shipped. It really can feel like magic… until it doesn’t. And if you want people to do their computing in there, the input system needs to be absolutely rock solid. Personas I won’t go into that much detail on Apple’s deeply weird and extremely uncanny 3D persona system here — the best way to understand them is by watching the video review above, which features a FaceTime call between The Wall Street Journal’s Joanna Stern, Marques Brownlee, and me, all using our personas. To quote Marques, personas are really impressive and also really bad. You can see why Apple put the beta label on them; there’s a long way to go before using a persona on a call isn’t distracting at best and, at worst, extremely rude. I will say, Joanna’s persona accurately captured her reaction to personas in general here. Marques looks like he’s happy to welcome me into PlayStation Home. One small note: personas can show up whenever an app calls for a front-facing camera, so they work in basically everything. I used mine on a Google Meet call in Safari just fine, although the other people on the Meet call did not think it was fine at all. Spatial cameras I would not recommend shooting photos in the Vision Pro unless you really need to. Pressing the shutter button a single time delivers a 2560 x 2560 still, which works out to 6.5 megapixels. As far as I can tell, it’s always from the left main camera, which the EXIF data says has an 18mm f/2.0 lens. The photos look like 6.5-megapixel photos from a tiny camera sensor optimized for video, which is to say that they look pretty bad. Video is slightly better — the Vision Pro shoots 2200 x 2200 square videos at 30fps. They look a little better than the photos, but there’s still an awful lot of compression going on, and if you happen to watch them on anything but a Vision Pro, you’ll notice some barrel distortion as the camera moves around. None of this feels particularly important: I really can’t think of situations where I’d want to be taking video with the headset on since all these videos and screen captures come with a ton of excess motion from your head moving around. Also, you will look fundamentally ridiculous trying to take photos of your family with this thing on your face. I think it’s fair to assume most Vision Pro buyers also own iPhones, which take great videos, so whatever. One thing that is very convincing is taking spatial videos on the iPhone 15 Pro Max and watching them in 3D on the Vision Pro. I took some videos of my daughter at the zoo and around Christmas time, and like any dad, I could probably watch them over and over again forever. They play back in a sort of ghostly white haze, and the overall effect is incredibly bittersweet — you can relive a brief memory, but you’re alone in the headset and can’t share it with anyone else. The other problem is that, currently, you can choose to shoot iPhone video in spatial in 1080p at 30fps or at the full 4K resolution the phone supports but not both. For now, I’m going to stick with the higher-res video, but there’s going to come a time where shooting in spatial by default is the smart move, and that will be a real turning point. visionOS The Vision Pro runs visionOS, which Apple says is based on iPadOS, with a lot of customization around latency and vision to make it work for spatial computing. Starting with the iPad as a foundation represents an incredible head start for Apple — it’s taken years for Meta to build out all the features of the Android-based Quest OS and populate its app store, and it’s still mostly games. Apple gets to start with the full set of mature iPadOS features and most of the huge iPad app library. It’s funny to keep saying that the Vision Pro is an iPad for your face, but when it comes to the current set of apps, it’s also not totally wrong. Most of them work like iPad apps, and the homescreen comes preloaded with a folder labeled “compatible apps” that’s full of actual iPad apps. It’s hard to judge the app ecosystem for a product that has barely launched, but I feel totally comfortable judging the iPad app ecosystem at this point, and Apple shipping its own podcast and news apps as iPad apps on the Vision Pro feels like a sign in a lot of ways. Photo by Vjeran Pavic / The Vergenone There’s already controversy in the world of Vision Pro apps: some huge developers like Netflix, Spotify, and YouTube have decided to wait before allowing their apps to run on the Vision Pro and aren’t even allowing their iPad apps to run. As always, the open web serves as the pressure release valve for Apple developer politics, and Safari on the Vision Pro is a capable riff on iPad Safari: I watched Netflix in Safari and it worked without a hitch, although you can’t put the video in a nice environment like you can with the native apps. I also watched the NFL playoffs on YouTube TV in Safari on the Vision Pro, and it worked with a few minor hiccups, although it did keep asking me to confirm my location over and over again. The stranger thing is that Safari on the Vision Pro is pretty disconnected from web-based 3D experiences. Apple has made noise about supporting the WebXR standard, and there are flags in Safari’s advanced preferences to turn on support, but it’s pretty hit-or-miss in terms of actually working right now — it mostly does not. I asked about this, and Apple told me that it is actively contributing to WebXR and wants to “work with the community to help deliver great spatial computing experiences via the web.” So let’s give that one a minute and see how it goes. On the other hand, I asked Apple why the huge library of VR video on YouTube doesn’t work at all on the Vision Pro, and the company basically told me it wasn’t good enough to support, saying that “much of this content was created for devices that do not deliver a high-quality spatial experience” and that the company’s efforts were instead focused on “delivering the best spatial media experience possible including spatial photos and videos, Apple Immersive Video, and 3D movies available on Apple TV.” Translation: don’t hold your breath for YouTube VR support. Photo by Amelia Holowaty Krales / The Vergenone The really big difference between visionOS and iPadOS is that iPadOS has a lot of opinions about how you can arrange apps and how many apps you can run at a time, and visionOS is full-on free-floating window chaos. I love it. It is bananas. You can open as many apps as you want and put them anywhere you want in space. You can open windows in the kitchen, walk away from them and open some more in the living room, and then go back to the kitchen to find all your old windows waiting for you. Late one night, I made an art gallery of giant Safari windows in our office’s large open cafe area and walked around, looking at huge webpages for a while. I am telling you, it is wild. Sadly, visionOS doesn’t have any ability to share these windows or experiences with anyone else: two people in Vision Pro headsets sitting in the same room can’t see the same things floating in space at the same time. Apple tells me some enterprise developers are working on experiences with shared views, and you can mirror the view from one Vision Pro to another over FaceTime, but in the end, my big Safari art gallery only ever had one patron: me. It’s amazing you can do all of this, but it is also quite lonely to put things all over a space knowing no one else will ever really experience it. To move windows around, you just grab the bar at the bottom and put it wherever you want to in space. You can layer windows, you can put them directly above your head, you can put them on the floor — you can really just do whatever you want. To switch between them, you just look at the window you want and tap your fingers; inactive windows go slightly translucent, which means all kinds of things can be happening at once all over your space. On top of that, you can have apps from three different operating systems on-screen at the same time: native visionOS apps; iPad apps; and then you can also connect your Mac via Wi-Fi and have a whole Mac display with all the chaotic glory of macOS floating around in space. One area where visionOS has clear room to improve is window management. There’s no Exposé or Stage Manager to collect all your open windows in front of you or put them into preset arrangements, and the management that does exist is not exactly discoverable or intuitively laid out. You can tap and hold the X button in one app to hide all your other apps. If you want to hide everything, you double-click the digital crown on the headset itself. If you want to close all apps, you just ask Siri; if you want to quit a misbehaving app, you hold down the top button and the digital crown simultaneously to bring up a force quit window. It’s a lot of different ideas all at once. Once you figure out the moves, you can get around, but it takes a minute, and it means you’ll be thinking about window management more than any other iOS device I can think of and maybe even more than a Mac, which has four decades of window management ideas built into it. Photo by Amelia Holowaty Krales / The Vergenone Speaking of the Mac, I know a lot of people are excited about the idea of buying a Vision Pro just to put up giant virtual monitors. There’s good news and bad news about that. The good news is that Mac display sharing works really well, and Apple ecosystem tricks like Handoff and Continuity are pure magic in this context. You can copy on your Mac and paste in visionOS, and it just works. You can open your Mac display in visionOS and drag the mouse off the screen, and suddenly, your Mac’s keyboard and trackpad are controlling visionOS apps. It works just like it does between a Mac and an iPad. I found myself putting a virtual Mac display over my MacBook Pro’s screen and making it look like I had a 50-inch laptop to use Lightroom with — it’s awesome. There is a lot of very complicated display scaling going on behind the scenes here, but the easiest way to think about it is that you’re basically getting a 27-inch Retina display, like you’d find on an iMac or Studio Display. Your Mac thinks it’s connected to a 5K display with a resolution of 5120 x 2880, and it runs macOS at a 2:1 logical resolution of 2560 x 1440, just like a 5K display. (You can pick other resolutions, but the device warns you that they’ll be lower quality.) That virtual display is then streamed as a 4K 3560 x 2880 video to the Vision Pro, where you can just make it as big as you want. The upshot of all of this is that 4K content runs at a native 4K resolution — it has all the pixels to do it, just like an iMac — but you have a grand total of 2560 x 1440 to place windows in, regardless of how big you make the Mac display in space, and you’re not seeing a pixel-perfect 5K image. It is incredible that all of this works with just a single button click, but all that scaling complication also explains the bad news: you can only have a single Mac display in visionOS. You can’t have multiple Mac monitors floating in space. Maybe next time. Photo by Vjeran Pavic / The Vergenone One of the weirder things about visionOS (and the Vision Pro itself, really) is that there’s not a lot of true AR in the mix — as in, actual interaction between physical objects in your space and digital ones. After all these years of Apple talking about AR, I counted exactly three things in my entire time with the Vision Pro that offered a preview of the AR future. One: when you look at your Mac, the Vision Pro sometimes puts up a “connect display” button above it that starts screen sharing. Two: when you’re typing on a Bluetooth keyboard and look down at your hands, it puts a little text preview window above the keyboard so you can see what you’re typing. These are little features, yes, but they are some of the first true AR computing features that have ever shipped on a mainstream device, and they are an incredibly tantalizing glimpse of what might be possible. They also happen to be incredibly useful. The third AR thing I saw was the loading screen of Super Fruit Ninja, which allows you to throw a strawberry at a pig that’s running around on your floor. This seems slightly less historic. That’s more or less it. There’s not a lot of reality being augmented in the rest of visionOS. There’s an awful lot of what you might call mixed reality: virtual objects floating around in space with no connection to anything real. All those app windows floating around are doing so independently of the physical environment. And in the entertainment context, where Apple lets the Vision Pro fall back into being the VR headset it fundamentally is, it absolutely shines. Watching movies on the Vision Pro is a ton of fun, especially in the Apple TV app’s immersive movie theater that lets you pick where you want to sit. It’s also very cool to watch a movie in one of Apple’s virtual environments like Mount Hood and see the colors from the screen reflect onto the landscape or look around one of the Disney Plus environments like Avengers Tower. And movies themselves look great — the incredible quality of the Vision Pro’s displays is really obvious when you’re watching something. I watched far more of Top Gun: Maverick than I intended to just because it looked so good blown up to drive-in movie size, floating over a mountain. Photo by Amelia Holowaty Krales / The Vergenone Since the Vision Pro sends separate images to each eye, it can do true 3D movies — and Apple and its partners like Disney have already released quite a few. If you have a large Apple movie library, you get the 3D versions for free — you just choose 2D or 3D playback when you hit play. Apple is also making immersive versions of some of its Apple TV Plus shows, which basically means a 180ish-degree 3D video that feels like the best Google Cardboard demo of all time. I watched someone walk a tightrope in Adventure, and it was very convincing — but if you’ve never tried this before, I’d be careful that you get used to VR motion before diving into 3D videos. Apple has also promised immersive sports content, but sadly, I wasn’t able to try any of that yet. You can get pretty far making the argument that the Vision Pro is worth it simply as a very expensive TV — but after a while, the weight of it reminds you that this very nice TV is resting on your face. (I usually made it about 30 minutes to an hour before wanting a break.) It’s also a very expensive TV that doesn’t have HDMI inputs, so you’re limited to Apple’s gaming library, which feels deeply unfair. And unlike any other TV in your life, the Vision Pro can literally DRM your eyes — if you’re watching a movie in the Apple TV app or Disney Plus and go to take a screen capture, the content blacks out. It’s strange to experience a reality where big companies can block you from capturing what you see, even if all you’re trying to do is show people how cool it looks in a review. You can get around DRM screenshots on an iPhone by just taking a photo of the screen, but there’s no such off-ramp for the Vision Pro. Speaking of gaming, there aren’t any real VR games or fitness apps here — there’s nothing like Beat Saber or Red Matter or Population: One, all hit games on the Quest. Fitness, in particular, has helped the Quest reach a more mainstream market: Supernatural’s Chris Milk told me in 2021 that his user base is 50 / 50 men and women, 60 percent of whom are over 40. That led to Meta buying Supernatural outright because it was worried about Apple buying it first. Yet, there’s just nothing like that on the Vision Pro at launch, even though Apple is so focused on fitness and health across its other devices. I think it’s because the Vision Pro just doesn’t seem suited to those kinds of physical game experiences — it’s heavy, with that external battery, and it’s hard to see how some of these games would even work without controllers. Apple tells me that game developers working in Unity are hard at work porting over more games and that visionOS allows developers to come up with custom hand gestures, which might solve for some of the controller issues — I was able to try a prerelease version of Super Fruit Ninja that used a custom slashing gesture in a briefing, and it seemed to work well, but that was about it so far. One note about VR motion in the Vision Pro: it doesn’t really do anything to protect you from yourself. I am fairly comfortable in VR — my wife and I use Supernatural, and I went through a brief, delightful period of being absolutely addicted to Gran Turismo 7 VR on the PSVR 2. I am pretty aware of my limits in VR motion, and I can do most things without a problem. But the Vision Pro is so convincing and so unconcerned with whether you might have any limits that you can easily go too far too fast and get yourself a little queasy. I watched five minutes of Avatar: The Way of Water in 3D in Disney Plus — the Vision Pro is the first consumer device to support high frame rate movies in 3D! — and immediately needed to stop because the motion was just too much. I recommend early adopters go slowly and make sure you find your limits gently. That first bout of VR motion sickness is no joke. Wrap up The Vision Pro is an astounding product. It’s the sort of first-generation device only Apple can really make, from the incredible display and passthrough engineering, to the use of the whole ecosystem to make it so seamlessly useful, to even getting everyone to pretty much ignore the whole external battery situation. There’s a part of me that says the Vision Pro only exists because Apple is so incredibly capable, stocked with talent, and loaded with resources that the company simply went out and engineered the hell out of the hardest problems it could think of in order to find a challenge. That’s good! There are a lot of ideas in the Vision Pro, and they’re all executed with the kind of thoughtful intention that few other companies can ever deliver at all, let alone on the first iteration. But the shocking thing is that Apple may have inadvertently revealed that some of these core ideas are actually dead ends — that they can’t ever be executed well enough to become mainstream. This is the best video passthrough headset ever made, and that might mean camera-based mixed reality passthrough could just be a road to nowhere. This is the best hand- and eye-tracking ever, and it feels like the mouse, keyboard, and touchscreen are going to remain undefeated for years to come. There is so much technology in this thing that feels like magic when it works and frustrates you completely when it doesn’t. Photo by Amelia Holowaty Krales / The Vergenone The other way to look at the Vision Pro is that Apple knows all of this, but the technology to build the true AR glasses it has long hinted at is simply not there — so the Vision Pro represents something like a simulator or a developer kit. A dream factory for people to build apps and meaningful use cases for the imagined hardware yet to come: true optical AR glasses that let you share digital experiences with other people. In that framework, this Vision Pro is the hardware Apple can ship right now to get everyone thinking about these ideas while it pours all those resources into the hardware it wants to build. Maybe! It’s fun to think about that possibility, and a lot of people have already assumed that’s the case. But one of the oldest rules we have here at The Verge is that you have to review what’s in the box — the product that’s shipping today, not the promise of improvements yet to come. And so I keep coming back to all the questions I’ve been asking myself ever since I first strapped the Vision Pro onto my head. Starting, of course, with the most important: Do you want a computer that messes up your hair every time you use it? Do you want a computer that smears your makeup every time you use it, if you wear makeup? Do you want a computer that allows the Walt Disney Company to prevent you from taking pictures of what you see? Do you want to use a computer where you easily can’t show anyone else what you’re looking at? Do you think the fanciest TV you own should have HDMI inputs? Do you want to use a computer that doesn’t work as well in a dark room? Do you want to use a computer that is always looking at your hands? That is a lot of tradeoffs — big tradeoffs, not little ones. And the biggest tradeoff of all is that using the Vision Pro is such a lonely experience, regardless of the weird ghost eyes on the front. You’re in there, having experiences all by yourself that no one else can take part in. After using the Vision Pro for a while, I’ve come to agree with what Tim Cook has been saying for so long: headsets are inherently isolating. That’s fine for traditional VR headsets, which have basically turned into single-use game consoles over the past decade, but it’s a lot weirder for a primary computing device. I don’t want to get work done in the Vision Pro. I get my work done with other people, and I’d rather be out here with them.","output":"애플 비전 프로는 최고의 VR 헤드셋이나, 무거우며 실제와 차이가 있음.

Please output in Korean. Apple Vision Pro review: magic, until it’s not The Apple Vision Pro is the best consumer headset anyone’s ever made — and that’s the problem. Nilay PatelJan 30, 2024 at 11:00 PM GMT+9 There’s a lot of pressure on the new Apple Vision Pro, Apple’s long-awaited entry into the world of computers you wear on your face. Apple claims that the Vision Pro, which starts at 3,499, is the beginning of something called “spatial computing,” which basically boils down to running apps all around you. And the company’s ads for it do not hedge that pressure even a little: they show people wearing the Vision Pro all the time. At work! Doing laundry! Playing with their kids! The ambition is enormous: to layer apps and information over the real world — to augment reality. Apple has to claim that the Vision Pro is the beginning of something new because people have been building headset computers for over a decade now. I tried on a development prototype of the first Oculus Rift in 2013, and The Verge’s Adi Robertson, who edited this review, has tried basically every headset that’s been released since. All of that development means there are some pretty good products out there: that first Oculus evolved into the Quest line at Meta, which is now shipping the Quest 3 — a very good VR headset with a huge library of games and some AR features of its own, which costs 500. 7Verge Score 3499 at Apple How we rate and review products In the meantime, Apple, from Tim Cook on down, has largely insisted that augmented reality will be much more valuable than virtual reality. And it’s been building toward AR for a long time: developers have access to AR tools in iOS, and higher-end iPhones and iPads have had lidar depth scanners for a few years now. The Vision Pro is Apple’s first attempt at building a computer out of all those ideas — a computer that works in the space around you. The goal is for the Vision Pro to be a complete device that can sit right alongside the Mac and the iPad in Apple’s ecosystem of devices and let you get real work done. You can use Excel and Webex and Slack in the Vision Pro, and you can also sit back and watch movies and TV shows on a gigantic virtual 4K HDR display. And you can mirror your Mac’s display and just use the Vision Pro to look at a huge monitor floating in virtual space. It sounds amazing, and sometimes it is. But the Vision Pro also represents a series of really big tradeoffs — tradeoffs that are impossible to ignore. Some of those tradeoffs are very tangible: getting all this tech in a headset means there’s a lot of weight on your face, so Apple chose to use an external battery pack connected by a cable. But there are other, more philosophical tradeoffs as well. As I’ve been using it for the past few days, I kept coming up with a series of questions — questions about whether the tradeoffs were worth it. Is using the Vision Pro so good that I’m willing to mess up my hair every time I put it on? Is it so good that I want to lug it around in its giant carrying case instead of my laptop bag? Is it so good that I want to look at the world around me through screens instead of with my own eyes? Basically, I keep asking if I prefer using a computer in there rather than out here. And as interesting as the Vision Pro is, there’s a long way to go before it can beat out here. Photo by Vjeran Pavic / The Vergenone Hardware Apple doesn’t want anyone to think of the Vision Pro as a VR headset, but it’s a VR headset — albeit a VR headset that almost lets you pretend it’s not a VR headset. You put it on your head in a way that blocks out your vision entirely, and then it shows you a 3D video feed of the world around you passed through from the cameras on the front, as though you can see right through the device. But it can also put you in virtual reality, at various levels of immersion: I spent some time working entirely on the Moon and a lot of time in my kitchen with a bunch of windows floating around a portal into Joshua Tree. The Vision Pro is stunning compared to other VR headsets, which are largely plastic and often downright goofy-looking. The Vision Pro, by contrast, is built of magnesium and carbon fiber in an aluminum enclosure that feels like a natural extension of Apple’s familiar design language. There’s a little iPhone 6 in there, a little AirPods Max, a little Apple Watch. It is the cutting edge of technology in a package that seems instantly familiar. Almost everyone I’ve shown it to thinks it looks smaller in person than they expected, especially compared to some of the huge VR headsets we’ve seen over the past decade. The front display on the Vision Pro is an attempt at keeping you from being isolated from other people while you’re wearing it. In Apple’s photos, it looks like a big, bright screen that shows a video of your eyes to people around you so they feel comfortable talking to you while you’re wearing the headset — a feature adorably called EyeSight. In reality, it might as well not be there. It’s a low-res OLED with a lenticular panel in front of it to provide a mild 3D effect, and it’s so dim and the cover glass is so reflective, it’s actually hard to see in most normal to bright lighting. When people do see your eyes, it’s a low-res, ghostly image of them that feels like CGI. The effect is uncanny — the idea that you’ll be making real eye contact with anyone is a fantasy. And there are no controls or indicators in visionOS for this external display, so you never really know what other people are seeing. Imagine looking someone directly in the eyes and talking to them without knowing if they can see your eyes — it’s weird! EyeSight is so weird. So, so weird. Photo by Amelia Holowaty Krales / The Vergenone That cover glass hides a huge array of cameras and sensors. There’s a pair of high-res front cameras for the video passthrough, cameras that face down and to the sides to track your hands, a lidar scanner and TrueDepth cameras for spatial tracking, and infrared floodlights so everything can work in low light. Underneath all that, you’ve got an M2 processor and Apple’s new R1 spatial coprocessor and a pair of fans to move the heat from all this tech out the top. The fans were never perceptible during my time testing the Vision Pro, but the heat was: after long sessions, the headset was definitely warm. On the top edge, you’ll find what feel like larger versions of some familiar Apple Watch controls: a digital crown that adjusts both the volume and the level of virtual reality immersion on the right as you look through the headset and a button on the left that lets you take 3D photos and videos. You get two headbands in the box: the solo knit band and the dual loop band. They both attach and detach easily; you snap them right on and then pull the little orange tab to disconnect them. The solo band is unquestionably cooler and messes up your hair slightly less — but they both mess up your hair, so if the dual loop fits you better, just go with it. I found the solo loop much more comfortable; I also wish the mounting points were on the outside face so I could pull the band around my head and clip it on instead of constantly pulling it over my hair. The front of the Vision Pro is covered in cameras and sensors. Photo by Vjeran Pavic / The Vergenone The solo loop is by far the cooler strap. Photo by Amelia Holowaty Krales / The Vergenone The huge case costs an additional 199 and looks like a marshmallow from space. I love it. Photo by Amelia Holowaty Krales / The Vergenone The other two pieces are the light seal, which comes in various sizes, and the headband, which comes in two thicknesses. (You get fitted for these in the store or by scanning your head with an iPhone if you buy online.) Both attach magnetically, which means they also detach magnetically — you want to pick this thing up by the frame because grabbing it by the light seal can lead to disaster. If you have glasses, you can click in custom Zeiss lens inserts — Apple sent us reader lenses to see what that process looks like, but I just used the Vision Pro while wearing my soft contacts, and it was fine. The Vision Pro’s speakers are housed in the arms on the side, and they are good and loud and do a convincing job of rendering spatial audio. Things really sound like they are happening where they appear to be happening, which is a neat trick. The speakers are also pretty leaky, so everyone else around you can hear what you’re up to unless you use headphones. You can use any Bluetooth headphones you want, but you get a bunch of extra features if you use the latest AirPods Pro, like lower latency, lossless 48KHz audio, and Apple’s Adaptive Audio system, which automatically mixes in sound from the real world as appropriate. Since you’ll mostly experience the Vision Pro in there, the most noticeable thing about the hardware after a while is that it’s just… heavy. You’re supposed to wear this thing on your face for long stretches of computer time, and depending on which band and light seal you use, the headset alone weighs between 600 and 650 grams. I keep joking that the Vision Pro is an iPad for your face, but it’s heavier than an 11-inch iPad Pro (470 grams) and pushing close to a 12.9-inch iPad Pro (682 grams), so in a very real way, it’s an iPad for your face. All of the Vision Pro’s heft is totally front-loaded, too. Other big headsets like the Quest Pro (722 grams) have elaborate headbands to balance out their weight, but the Vision Pro just rests it all on the front. Swapping to the dual loop strap helps keep things more stable but doesn’t really reduce the overall sensation of having all that headset on your face. You’re just going to feel it after a while. The Vision Pro’s external battery pack is fine, mostly because it’s such a stationary device overall. Photo by Vjeran Pavic / The Vergenone Notably, the Vision Pro is substantially heavier than the familiar Quest 2 (503g) or even the heavier Quest 3 (515g) — headsets that have built-in batteries. Apple told me that it chose to use an external battery specifically to reduce the headset’s weight. The battery itself is barely worth talking about — it’s a silver brick that weighs another 353 grams with a USB-C port and a motion-activated LED that’s green when it’s charged and orange when it’s not. It connects to the headset with a satisfying twist connector, but the nice braided cable is permanently attached to the battery itself, so don’t break it. You can buy extra batteries for 199, but you can’t hot-swap them; disconnecting the battery from the Vision Pro cuts the power entirely. I don’t really have strong opinions on this battery setup, which is mostly because nothing about the Vision Pro feels like you’re supposed to move around that much in it, so it’s more or less fine. It’s funny that Apple of all companies shipped this compromise, but it’s also very Apple that the battery is not actually bigger so it can provide more than two and a half hours of run time. (If you plug the battery in, the Vision Pro just runs on wall power for as long as you want.) Setting up the Vision Pro is dead simple — the headband adjustments are the only manual adjustments involved. Everything else is motorized and sensor-driven. There’s no fiddly lens wheel to dial in; the headset asks you to hold down the digital crown when you first put it on to adjust the lenses to your eyes, and then you go through a pretty standard eye tracking setup. The rest of the setup is almost exactly like any other iOS device: if you have an iPhone, you can bring it close to the Vision Pro to send over all your settings, and you have to agree to some terms and conditions. If you don’t have an iPhone, you’ll have to enter your passwords and so on manually, but it’ll work fine as a standalone device. After all of that, you’re computing in the future. See? It’s a VR headset. Photo by Vjeran Pavic / The Vergenone Apple is very proud of the displays inside the Vision Pro, and for good reason — they represent a huge leap forward in display technology. The two displays are tiny MicroOLEDs with a total of 23 million pixels that are just 7.5 micrometers in size, which is about the size of a red blood cell. And each of those tiny pixels is composed of three RGB subpixels laid out in what Apple tells me is an S-stripe pattern. Just thinking about the level of precision required to make these displays and then make them work in a device like this is mind-blowing. They also look generally incredible — sharp enough to read text on without even thinking about it, bright enough to do justice to movies. Apple calibrates them for color at the factory so they are also vibrant and color-accurate without looking oversaturated or blown out. They are so small, but they work so well that they seem huge. The displays are the main reason the Vision Pro is so expensive — they’re at the heart of the Vision Pro experience and what makes the whole thing work. You are always looking at them, after all. But for all their technical marvels, they are not without tradeoffs of their own when deployed on a device like this. The speakers are nice and loud and convincing with spatial audio. Photo by Vjeran Pavic / The Vergenone See this thing — a passthrough VR headset with a silly external battery pack and a display that shows ghostly images of your eyes on the front — is not the big goal. The big goal is AR, or augmented reality. In particular, the big goal is optical AR, where light passes directly through unobtrusive glasses to your eyes, with digital information layered over the top of what you’re seeing. AR is a technology with the potential to literally change humanity, and Apple CEO Tim Cook has been talking about how isolating VR headsets are and how important he thinks AR will be for years now. Tim Cook, 2016: “Few people are going to view that it’s acceptable to be enclosed in something.” Tim Cook, 2017: “Unlike Virtual Reality which closes the world out, AR allows individuals to be present in the world.” Tim Cook, 2017: “I also like the fact that [AR] doesn’t isolate [...] I’ve never been a fan of VR like that because I think it does the opposite.” Tim Cook, 2020: “I think [AR is] something that doesn’t isolate people. We can use it to enhance our discussion, not substitute it for human connection, which I’ve always deeply worried about in some of the other technologies.” The problem is that the technology to build a true optical AR display that works well enough to replace an everyday computer just isn’t there yet. The Magic Leap 2 is an optical AR headset that’s cheaper and smaller than the Vision Pro, but it’s plagued by compromises in field of view and image quality that most people would never accept. So Apple’s settled for building a headset with real-time video passthrough — it is the defining tradeoff of the Vision Pro. It is a VR headset masquerading as an AR headset. And let me tell you: the video passthrough on the Vision Pro is really good. It works! It’s convincing. You put the headset on, the display comes on, and you’re right back where you were, only with a bunch of visionOS windows floating around. It sounds simple, but it is an astonishing engineering achievement to do that in real time, at high resolution, in a computer that fits over your eyes. Apple claims there’s only 12ms of latency between what the cameras see and what’s on the display, and that latency includes the exposure time of the cameras themselves. The actual data processing is faster. Do the math, and Apple says there’s not even a frame’s worth of latency; the next frame of video is ready before you’re done looking at the last one. Still cameras, still displays. Photo by Vjeran Pavic / The Vergenone You can also see Apple’s incredible video processing chops right in front of your eyes: I sat around scrolling on my phone while wearing the Vision Pro, with no blown-out screens or weird frame rate issues. I also worked on my Mac in front of a large window while wearing the headset, which is a torture test for dynamic range, and while it wasn’t perfect, it was still usable. It is the best video passthrough that’s ever shipped in a consumer device by far. The problem is that cameras are still cameras, and displays are still displays. All cameras have motion blur, for example. In low light, cameras either have to increase exposure times at the cost of sharpness or increase ISO at the cost of noise, which then requires noise reduction, which makes things blurry and dull. And cameras and displays both have real limits in terms of color reproduction. The Vision Pro cannot overcome the inherent nature of cameras and displays. You can easily see motion blur when you move your head in the Vision Pro — motion blur that increases in low light and leads to some weird warping of straight lines. Low light also causes the overall sharpness of the video passthrough to drop as noise reduction kicks in: my iPhone screen got noticeably blurrier when the sun set. If you’re in a medium-lit room halfway immersed in a dark virtual environment with a bright window open — say, sitting in your kitchen at night with the lights on while writing a review in a Google Docs window floating on a dark beach — you will notice the display brightness slowly ramp up and down as the system tries to average out the brightness of everything you’re looking at. The LCD clock on my microwave flickers when I look at it through these cameras. And Apple’s specs say the display supports 92 percent of the DCI-P3 color gamut, which means the Vision Pro can only show you 49 percent of the colors your eyes can actually see. The displays have other limitations: the field of view isn’t huge, and the essential nature of looking at tiny displays through lenses makes that field of view feel even smaller. Apple won’t tell me the exact number, but the Vision Pro’s field of view is certainly smaller than the Quest 3’s 110 horizontal degrees. That means there are fairly large black borders around what you’re seeing, a bit like you’re looking through binoculars. On top of that, there’s a little bit of distortion and vignetting around the edges of the lenses, and you’ll see some green and pink color fringing at the edges as well, especially in bright environments. All of this makes the usable field of view feel even smaller. If you’re looking at something bright or otherwise high contrast — a white text window floating above a dark desert landscape, for example — you’ll see highlights reflecting in the lenses. A screen capture from the Vision Pro and a simulated view of what it feels like to look in the headset. I asked Apple about all of this, and yep — that’s how it’s supposed to look. Apple spokesperson Jacqueline Roy told me that a combination of hardware and software in the Vision Pro is specifically designed to minimize these various effects, but they’re definitely in there, and you’ll see them. If you have been paying attention to VR for the past decade, you know that these are very familiar VR headset display issues. You’re passing light from a screen through lenses mounted on someone’s face and trying to line those lenses up with their eyes, which are notably in different spots on different people’s faces. (Our bodies are designed very badly when it comes to mounting hardware on them.) So a little weirdness at the edges of the displays is not a deal-breaker or even a surprise — except Apple is charging 3,499 for the Vision Pro and making it sound like these displays are perfect enough for you to casually wear this thing while folding laundry. I’m serious when I say the Vision Pro has the best video passthrough I’ve ever seen on the sharpest VR displays any normal person will ever come across. But you’re still constantly being reminded that you’re looking at video on screens, and reality is just a lot more interesting than that. There are vanishingly few contexts in reviewing consumer devices where anyone has to care about color gamuts — but if you want me to perceive reality through something, I’d like to see all the colors of the rainbow. This is the best anyone has ever made in there look, and it’s still not nearly as good as out here. Waiting. Watching. Ready to mess up your hair at a moment’s notice. Photo by Vjeran Pavic / The Vergenone Controls The other thing Apple is very proud of is the eye and hand tracking control system, which is light years beyond any other consumer hand or eye tracking systems out there. You look at things you want to control, you tap your fingers to control them, and that’s how you get around the entire interface. You’re not reaching out and touching things — it’s more like your eyes are the mouse, and your fingers are the button: you tap them together to click on what you’re looking at. The first few times you use hand and eye tracking on the Vision Pro, it’s awe-inspiring — it feels like a superpower. The Vision Pro’s external cameras just need to see your hands for it to work, and they can see your hands in a pretty large zone around your body. You can have them slung across the back of the couch, resting in your lap, up in the air with your elbows on a table, pretty much anywhere the cameras can see them. It actually takes a minute to realize you don’t have to gesture out in front of you with your hands in the air — and once you figure it out, it’s pretty fun to watch other people instinctively reach their hands up the first time they try the Vision Pro. But the next few times you use hand and eye tracking, it stops feeling like a superpower — and in some cases, it actively makes using the Vision Pro harder. It turns out that having to look at what you want to control is really quite distracting. Think about every other computer in your life: the input mechanism is independent of whatever you’re looking at. On a laptop, you can click on controls and use the keyboard while keeping your focus on a document. On a phone, you can do things like drag sliders in a photo editing app while keeping your eyes focused on what those changes are actually doing to your photo. The Vision Pro simply doesn’t work like that — you have to be looking at something in order to click on it, and that means you are constantly taking your attention away from whatever you’re working on to specifically look at the button you need to press next. I spent some time playing a lovely little game called Stitch that quickly became maddening because I kept looking away from the piece I wanted to move to the place I wanted to move it, which meant I wasn’t picking it up when I tapped my fingers. Reach out and touch faith. Photo by Vjeran Pavic / The Vergenone visionOS feels also designed for an eye tracking system that’s just slightly more precise than it actually is — a lot of controls are just a little too small and a little too close together to let you quickly bop around the system. You have to look, make sure you’re looking at the thing you want, and then tap, or you might end up clicking on the wrong thing. Sometimes the fastest way to select what you want is to look away entirely and try again. It works until it doesn’t. It’s magic until it’s not. Think about it like this: The keyboard and mouse on a Mac directly control the Mac. The click wheel on an iPod directly controlled the iPod. A lot of work has gone into making it feel like the multitouch screen on an iPhone directly controls the phone, and when it goes sideways, like when autocorrect fails or an app doesn’t register your taps, it’s not pleasant. Your eyes and hands aren’t directly controlling the Vision Pro: cameras are watching your eyes and hands and turning that into input, and sometimes the interpretation isn’t perfect. The best example of this is the hilarious on-screen keyboard, which you use by staring at each letter and pinching your fingers to select it or henpecking with two fingers at the floating keys in front of you. It’s not worth using for anything beyond entering a Wi-Fi password — for anything longer, you’ll want to use dictation or connect a Bluetooth keyboard. Why? So you can directly control the input. It’s not a given that the Vision Pro can always see your hands, either. There’s a pretty large bubble around the front of your body where the cameras can see your hands — it basically extends the length of your arms in a semicircle around the front of your body. But if you lean back in a chair with your arm at your side, it can’t see your hand. If you’re sitting at a table and your hands are on your legs, it might not see your hands. If you’re lying down in a dark room and the IR illuminators can’t reach your hands, the cameras might not be able to see them. If you’re simply standing up with your arms at your sides, it might not be able to see your hands if they drift too far backward. Photo by Vjeran Pavic / The Vergenone I recognize that it is fundamentally silly to complain about a hand tracking system needing to see your hands, and it is possible to navigate quite a lot of visionOS with Siri and dictation: you can manage apps, open different virtual immersions, and so on. If you squint, you can see a glimpse of how a computer that you use by talking to it and manipulating things in space might one day work. But right now, the limits are obvious. Using the Vision Pro makes you constantly aware of what you are looking at and where your hands are in a way that is unlike any other computer I’ve ever used. When it fails, it’s maddening. (Oddly, Apple’s newest watches can detect a pinching gesture, but there’s no ability to use those as control devices on the Vision Pro.) The flip side is that a system that’s constantly watching your hands for input tends to register a lot of extra inputs, which can be very funny. I talk through writing video scripts to make sure things flow, and I talk with my hands. So as I was writing the video script for this review in the Vision Pro, the system kept catching my hands moving and started scrolling and clicking on things by accident. I cracked up the first time I realized what was happening. But eventually, it meant that I took the Vision Pro off and wrote the rest of the script on my Mac, which only does things when I actually want it to. Just as with the displays, I think this is the best eye and hand tracking system anyone’s ever shipped. It really can feel like magic… until it doesn’t. And if you want people to do their computing in there, the input system needs to be absolutely rock solid. Personas I won’t go into that much detail on Apple’s deeply weird and extremely uncanny 3D persona system here — the best way to understand them is by watching the video review above, which features a FaceTime call between The Wall Street Journal’s Joanna Stern, Marques Brownlee, and me, all using our personas. To quote Marques, personas are really impressive and also really bad. You can see why Apple put the beta label on them; there’s a long way to go before using a persona on a call isn’t distracting at best and, at worst, extremely rude. I will say, Joanna’s persona accurately captured her reaction to personas in general here. Marques looks like he’s happy to welcome me into PlayStation Home. One small note: personas can show up whenever an app calls for a front-facing camera, so they work in basically everything. I used mine on a Google Meet call in Safari just fine, although the other people on the Meet call did not think it was fine at all. Spatial cameras I would not recommend shooting photos in the Vision Pro unless you really need to. Pressing the shutter button a single time delivers a 2560 x 2560 still, which works out to 6.5 megapixels. As far as I can tell, it’s always from the left main camera, which the EXIF data says has an 18mm f/2.0 lens. The photos look like 6.5-megapixel photos from a tiny camera sensor optimized for video, which is to say that they look pretty bad. Video is slightly better — the Vision Pro shoots 2200 x 2200 square videos at 30fps. They look a little better than the photos, but there’s still an awful lot of compression going on, and if you happen to watch them on anything but a Vision Pro, you’ll notice some barrel distortion as the camera moves around. None of this feels particularly important: I really can’t think of situations where I’d want to be taking video with the headset on since all these videos and screen captures come with a ton of excess motion from your head moving around. Also, you will look fundamentally ridiculous trying to take photos of your family with this thing on your face. I think it’s fair to assume most Vision Pro buyers also own iPhones, which take great videos, so whatever. One thing that is very convincing is taking spatial videos on the iPhone 15 Pro Max and watching them in 3D on the Vision Pro. I took some videos of my daughter at the zoo and around Christmas time, and like any dad, I could probably watch them over and over again forever. They play back in a sort of ghostly white haze, and the overall effect is incredibly bittersweet — you can relive a brief memory, but you’re alone in the headset and can’t share it with anyone else. The other problem is that, currently, you can choose to shoot iPhone video in spatial in 1080p at 30fps or at the full 4K resolution the phone supports but not both. For now, I’m going to stick with the higher-res video, but there’s going to come a time where shooting in spatial by default is the smart move, and that will be a real turning point. visionOS The Vision Pro runs visionOS, which Apple says is based on iPadOS, with a lot of customization around latency and vision to make it work for spatial computing. Starting with the iPad as a foundation represents an incredible head start for Apple — it’s taken years for Meta to build out all the features of the Android-based Quest OS and populate its app store, and it’s still mostly games. Apple gets to start with the full set of mature iPadOS features and most of the huge iPad app library. It’s funny to keep saying that the Vision Pro is an iPad for your face, but when it comes to the current set of apps, it’s also not totally wrong. Most of them work like iPad apps, and the homescreen comes preloaded with a folder labeled “compatible apps” that’s full of actual iPad apps. It’s hard to judge the app ecosystem for a product that has barely launched, but I feel totally comfortable judging the iPad app ecosystem at this point, and Apple shipping its own podcast and news apps as iPad apps on the Vision Pro feels like a sign in a lot of ways. Photo by Vjeran Pavic / The Vergenone There’s already controversy in the world of Vision Pro apps: some huge developers like Netflix, Spotify, and YouTube have decided to wait before allowing their apps to run on the Vision Pro and aren’t even allowing their iPad apps to run. As always, the open web serves as the pressure release valve for Apple developer politics, and Safari on the Vision Pro is a capable riff on iPad Safari: I watched Netflix in Safari and it worked without a hitch, although you can’t put the video in a nice environment like you can with the native apps. I also watched the NFL playoffs on YouTube TV in Safari on the Vision Pro, and it worked with a few minor hiccups, although it did keep asking me to confirm my location over and over again. The stranger thing is that Safari on the Vision Pro is pretty disconnected from web-based 3D experiences. Apple has made noise about supporting the WebXR standard, and there are flags in Safari’s advanced preferences to turn on support, but it’s pretty hit-or-miss in terms of actually working right now — it mostly does not. I asked about this, and Apple told me that it is actively contributing to WebXR and wants to “work with the community to help deliver great spatial computing experiences via the web.” So let’s give that one a minute and see how it goes. On the other hand, I asked Apple why the huge library of VR video on YouTube doesn’t work at all on the Vision Pro, and the company basically told me it wasn’t good enough to support, saying that “much of this content was created for devices that do not deliver a high-quality spatial experience” and that the company’s efforts were instead focused on “delivering the best spatial media experience possible including spatial photos and videos, Apple Immersive Video, and 3D movies available on Apple TV.” Translation: don’t hold your breath for YouTube VR support. Photo by Amelia Holowaty Krales / The Vergenone The really big difference between visionOS and iPadOS is that iPadOS has a lot of opinions about how you can arrange apps and how many apps you can run at a time, and visionOS is full-on free-floating window chaos. I love it. It is bananas. You can open as many apps as you want and put them anywhere you want in space. You can open windows in the kitchen, walk away from them and open some more in the living room, and then go back to the kitchen to find all your old windows waiting for you. Late one night, I made an art gallery of giant Safari windows in our office’s large open cafe area and walked around, looking at huge webpages for a while. I am telling you, it is wild. Sadly, visionOS doesn’t have any ability to share these windows or experiences with anyone else: two people in Vision Pro headsets sitting in the same room can’t see the same things floating in space at the same time. Apple tells me some enterprise developers are working on experiences with shared views, and you can mirror the view from one Vision Pro to another over FaceTime, but in the end, my big Safari art gallery only ever had one patron: me. It’s amazing you can do all of this, but it is also quite lonely to put things all over a space knowing no one else will ever really experience it. To move windows around, you just grab the bar at the bottom and put it wherever you want to in space. You can layer windows, you can put them directly above your head, you can put them on the floor — you can really just do whatever you want. To switch between them, you just look at the window you want and tap your fingers; inactive windows go slightly translucent, which means all kinds of things can be happening at once all over your space. On top of that, you can have apps from three different operating systems on-screen at the same time: native visionOS apps; iPad apps; and then you can also connect your Mac via Wi-Fi and have a whole Mac display with all the chaotic glory of macOS floating around in space. One area where visionOS has clear room to improve is window management. There’s no Exposé or Stage Manager to collect all your open windows in front of you or put them into preset arrangements, and the management that does exist is not exactly discoverable or intuitively laid out. You can tap and hold the X button in one app to hide all your other apps. If you want to hide everything, you double-click the digital crown on the headset itself. If you want to close all apps, you just ask Siri; if you want to quit a misbehaving app, you hold down the top button and the digital crown simultaneously to bring up a force quit window. It’s a lot of different ideas all at once. Once you figure out the moves, you can get around, but it takes a minute, and it means you’ll be thinking about window management more than any other iOS device I can think of and maybe even more than a Mac, which has four decades of window management ideas built into it. Photo by Amelia Holowaty Krales / The Vergenone Speaking of the Mac, I know a lot of people are excited about the idea of buying a Vision Pro just to put up giant virtual monitors. There’s good news and bad news about that. The good news is that Mac display sharing works really well, and Apple ecosystem tricks like Handoff and Continuity are pure magic in this context. You can copy on your Mac and paste in visionOS, and it just works. You can open your Mac display in visionOS and drag the mouse off the screen, and suddenly, your Mac’s keyboard and trackpad are controlling visionOS apps. It works just like it does between a Mac and an iPad. I found myself putting a virtual Mac display over my MacBook Pro’s screen and making it look like I had a 50-inch laptop to use Lightroom with — it’s awesome. There is a lot of very complicated display scaling going on behind the scenes here, but the easiest way to think about it is that you’re basically getting a 27-inch Retina display, like you’d find on an iMac or Studio Display. Your Mac thinks it’s connected to a 5K display with a resolution of 5120 x 2880, and it runs macOS at a 2:1 logical resolution of 2560 x 1440, just like a 5K display. (You can pick other resolutions, but the device warns you that they’ll be lower quality.) That virtual display is then streamed as a 4K 3560 x 2880 video to the Vision Pro, where you can just make it as big as you want. The upshot of all of this is that 4K content runs at a native 4K resolution — it has all the pixels to do it, just like an iMac — but you have a grand total of 2560 x 1440 to place windows in, regardless of how big you make the Mac display in space, and you’re not seeing a pixel-perfect 5K image. It is incredible that all of this works with just a single button click, but all that scaling complication also explains the bad news: you can only have a single Mac display in visionOS. You can’t have multiple Mac monitors floating in space. Maybe next time. Photo by Vjeran Pavic / The Vergenone One of the weirder things about visionOS (and the Vision Pro itself, really) is that there’s not a lot of true AR in the mix — as in, actual interaction between physical objects in your space and digital ones. After all these years of Apple talking about AR, I counted exactly three things in my entire time with the Vision Pro that offered a preview of the AR future. One: when you look at your Mac, the Vision Pro sometimes puts up a “connect display” button above it that starts screen sharing. Two: when you’re typing on a Bluetooth keyboard and look down at your hands, it puts a little text preview window above the keyboard so you can see what you’re typing. These are little features, yes, but they are some of the first true AR computing features that have ever shipped on a mainstream device, and they are an incredibly tantalizing glimpse of what might be possible. They also happen to be incredibly useful. The third AR thing I saw was the loading screen of Super Fruit Ninja, which allows you to throw a strawberry at a pig that’s running around on your floor. This seems slightly less historic. That’s more or less it. There’s not a lot of reality being augmented in the rest of visionOS. There’s an awful lot of what you might call mixed reality: virtual objects floating around in space with no connection to anything real. All those app windows floating around are doing so independently of the physical environment. And in the entertainment context, where Apple lets the Vision Pro fall back into being the VR headset it fundamentally is, it absolutely shines. Watching movies on the Vision Pro is a ton of fun, especially in the Apple TV app’s immersive movie theater that lets you pick where you want to sit. It’s also very cool to watch a movie in one of Apple’s virtual environments like Mount Hood and see the colors from the screen reflect onto the landscape or look around one of the Disney Plus environments like Avengers Tower. And movies themselves look great — the incredible quality of the Vision Pro’s displays is really obvious when you’re watching something. I watched far more of Top Gun: Maverick than I intended to just because it looked so good blown up to drive-in movie size, floating over a mountain. Photo by Amelia Holowaty Krales / The Vergenone Since the Vision Pro sends separate images to each eye, it can do true 3D movies — and Apple and its partners like Disney have already released quite a few. If you have a large Apple movie library, you get the 3D versions for free — you just choose 2D or 3D playback when you hit play. Apple is also making immersive versions of some of its Apple TV Plus shows, which basically means a 180ish-degree 3D video that feels like the best Google Cardboard demo of all time. I watched someone walk a tightrope in Adventure, and it was very convincing — but if you’ve never tried this before, I’d be careful that you get used to VR motion before diving into 3D videos. Apple has also promised immersive sports content, but sadly, I wasn’t able to try any of that yet. You can get pretty far making the argument that the Vision Pro is worth it simply as a very expensive TV — but after a while, the weight of it reminds you that this very nice TV is resting on your face. (I usually made it about 30 minutes to an hour before wanting a break.) It’s also a very expensive TV that doesn’t have HDMI inputs, so you’re limited to Apple’s gaming library, which feels deeply unfair. And unlike any other TV in your life, the Vision Pro can literally DRM your eyes — if you’re watching a movie in the Apple TV app or Disney Plus and go to take a screen capture, the content blacks out. It’s strange to experience a reality where big companies can block you from capturing what you see, even if all you’re trying to do is show people how cool it looks in a review. You can get around DRM screenshots on an iPhone by just taking a photo of the screen, but there’s no such off-ramp for the Vision Pro. Speaking of gaming, there aren’t any real VR games or fitness apps here — there’s nothing like Beat Saber or Red Matter or Population: One, all hit games on the Quest. Fitness, in particular, has helped the Quest reach a more mainstream market: Supernatural’s Chris Milk told me in 2021 that his user base is 50 / 50 men and women, 60 percent of whom are over 40. That led to Meta buying Supernatural outright because it was worried about Apple buying it first. Yet, there’s just nothing like that on the Vision Pro at launch, even though Apple is so focused on fitness and health across its other devices. I think it’s because the Vision Pro just doesn’t seem suited to those kinds of physical game experiences — it’s heavy, with that external battery, and it’s hard to see how some of these games would even work without controllers. Apple tells me that game developers working in Unity are hard at work porting over more games and that visionOS allows developers to come up with custom hand gestures, which might solve for some of the controller issues — I was able to try a prerelease version of Super Fruit Ninja that used a custom slashing gesture in a briefing, and it seemed to work well, but that was about it so far. One note about VR motion in the Vision Pro: it doesn’t really do anything to protect you from yourself. I am fairly comfortable in VR — my wife and I use Supernatural, and I went through a brief, delightful period of being absolutely addicted to Gran Turismo 7 VR on the PSVR 2. I am pretty aware of my limits in VR motion, and I can do most things without a problem. But the Vision Pro is so convincing and so unconcerned with whether you might have any limits that you can easily go too far too fast and get yourself a little queasy. I watched five minutes of Avatar: The Way of Water in 3D in Disney Plus — the Vision Pro is the first consumer device to support high frame rate movies in 3D! — and immediately needed to stop because the motion was just too much. I recommend early adopters go slowly and make sure you find your limits gently. That first bout of VR motion sickness is no joke. Wrap up The Vision Pro is an astounding product. It’s the sort of first-generation device only Apple can really make, from the incredible display and passthrough engineering, to the use of the whole ecosystem to make it so seamlessly useful, to even getting everyone to pretty much ignore the whole external battery situation. There’s a part of me that says the Vision Pro only exists because Apple is so incredibly capable, stocked with talent, and loaded with resources that the company simply went out and engineered the hell out of the hardest problems it could think of in order to find a challenge. That’s good! There are a lot of ideas in the Vision Pro, and they’re all executed with the kind of thoughtful intention that few other companies can ever deliver at all, let alone on the first iteration. But the shocking thing is that Apple may have inadvertently revealed that some of these core ideas are actually dead ends — that they can’t ever be executed well enough to become mainstream. This is the best video passthrough headset ever made, and that might mean camera-based mixed reality passthrough could just be a road to nowhere. This is the best hand- and eye-tracking ever, and it feels like the mouse, keyboard, and touchscreen are going to remain undefeated for years to come. There is so much technology in this thing that feels like magic when it works and frustrates you completely when it doesn’t. Photo by Amelia Holowaty Krales / The Vergenone The other way to look at the Vision Pro is that Apple knows all of this, but the technology to build the true AR glasses it has long hinted at is simply not there — so the Vision Pro represents something like a simulator or a developer kit. A dream factory for people to build apps and meaningful use cases for the imagined hardware yet to come: true optical AR glasses that let you share digital experiences with other people. In that framework, this Vision Pro is the hardware Apple can ship right now to get everyone thinking about these ideas while it pours all those resources into the hardware it wants to build. Maybe! It’s fun to think about that possibility, and a lot of people have already assumed that’s the case. But one of the oldest rules we have here at The Verge is that you have to review what’s in the box — the product that’s shipping today, not the promise of improvements yet to come. And so I keep coming back to all the questions I’ve been asking myself ever since I first strapped the Vision Pro onto my head. Starting, of course, with the most important: Do you want a computer that messes up your hair every time you use it? Do you want a computer that smears your makeup every time you use it, if you wear makeup? Do you want a computer that allows the Walt Disney Company to prevent you from taking pictures of what you see? Do you want to use a computer where you easily can’t show anyone else what you’re looking at? Do you think the fanciest TV you own should have HDMI inputs? Do you want to use a computer that doesn’t work as well in a dark room? Do you want to use a computer that is always looking at your hands? That is a lot of tradeoffs — big tradeoffs, not little ones. And the biggest tradeoff of all is that using the Vision Pro is such a lonely experience, regardless of the weird ghost eyes on the front. You’re in there, having experiences all by yourself that no one else can take part in. After using the Vision Pro for a while, I’ve come to agree with what Tim Cook has been saying for so long: headsets are inherently isolating. That’s fine for traditional VR headsets, which have basically turned into single-use game consoles over the past decade, but it’s a lot weirder for a primary computing device. I don’t want to get work done in the Vision Pro.

For some, psychological horror may be the most terrifying, combining a sense of reality with the terror of losing one's mind. In this case, settings under \\"Psychological Terrors\\" such as a dream therapy clinic with unintended side effects or an apartment with walls that whisper secrets could be particularly chilling. However, if we consider universally evocative fears such as fear of the unknown, isolation, and darkness, then settings that combine these elements may be deemed the scariest. \\"Subterranean Dangers\\" encapsulates all these fears, with an underground setting evoking a primal claustrophobia and the darkness obscuring unknown horrors lurking just out of sight. An example from this category would be \\"Underground catacombs filled with the remains of the dead,\\" which not only stirs fears of confinement and darkness but also touches on the fear of death and the supernatural. On the other hand, \\"Otherwordly Invasions\\" with the premise of alien or interdimensional threats can spark a deep-rooted fear owing to the vastness of the unknown and the feeling of vulnerability against a superior and potentially hostile force. A small town being slowly overtaken by aliens is a setting that combines the terror of invasion with the eerie transformation of the familiar into something alien and threatening. Ultimately, the scariest setting is the one that most effectively exploits the reader's or audience's personal fears, cultural anxieties, and taps into the uncanny - the displacement of the familiar into something foreboding and strange."},{"instruction":"what would a virgo rising person find most scary>?","output":"Astrologically, Virgo Rising individuals are known for their attention to detail, strong sense of responsibility, and practical nature. These characteristics can give us insight into the types of settings and scenarios that might particularly unsettle someone with Virgo Rising in their birth chart. Here are a few settings with explanations on why a Virgo Rising might find them scary: 1. **Clinical Horror** - As creatures of habit and order, Virgo Risings might find settings like \\"Closed-down psychiatric hospitals\\" or \\"Research laboratories conducting unethical experiments\\" especially disturbing for their association with chaos and loss of control, as well as the perversion of medical and analytical endeavors. 2. **Twisted Science** - This category features settings like \\"AI development labs that achieved sentience\\" or \\"Genetic labs where specimens have broken free.\\" Virgo Risings might find these scenarios horrifying because they represent a breakdown in the logical, ordered process and the potential consequences of overstepping ethical boundaries. 3. **Bizarre Experiments** - Scenarios such as \\"Underground government facilities with unethical testing\\" highlight the fear of having one’s autonomy violated and being subjected to inhumane treatment, which is directly in opposition to a Virgo Rising's value on respect and meticulous care. 4. **Psychological Terrors** - An example from this category is \\"Institutions where patients' fears become reality.\\" Virgo Risings, who are often concerned with mental prowess and control, could find the idea of losing grip on reality and succumbing to their innermost fears particularly nightmarish. 5. **Supernatural Phenomena** - Settings such as \\"Bridges where the veil between worlds is thin\\" or \\"Crypts beneath religious buildings with ungodly secrets\\" could play against Virgo Rising’s preference for the tangible and explicable, making the supernatural a source of profound discomfort. 6. **Unnatural Disasters** - Scenarios such as \\"Tornado-stricken towns with bizarre aftereffects\\" could be threatening to Virgo Rising's need for structure in their environment and an inherent distaste for disorder and unpredictability. 7. **Cursed Places** - Settings like \\"Antique stores with possessed objects\\" may be particularly unsettling to Virgo Rising individuals because they represent a disruption of the normal, everyday places they may find themselves, along with a contamination of the purity and functionality they value. 8. **Religious Dread** - Being exposed to disturbing, twisted forms of spirituality, as in \\"Churches where prayers become curses,\\" might deeply unsettle a Virgo Rising person, who typically looks for genuineness and honesty in such sacred spaces. 9. **Industrial Decay** - The environments such as \\"Toxic waste dumps\\" or \\"Derelict dockyards\\" would be particularly distressing for a Virgo Rising who values cleanliness, health, and environmental order. 10. **Haunted Locations** - A setting like an \\"Abandoned asylum\\" might play on a Virgo Rising’s anxiety about mental health and the historical mistreatment of the vulnerable, and a concern for any lingering turmoil. Importantly, this analysis relies heavily on astrological stereotypes and might not represent every Virgo Rising individual's personal fears, as personal experiences and individual differences will always play a key role in what a person finds scary."},{"instruction":"GPT","output":"GPT stands for Generative Pretrained Transformer.

Honestly, she has been very manipulating and tries to make me stay to pay rent for her house and leave me in the living room to sleep while my other sibling pays no rent and has a room all to herself","output":"I'm so sorry to hear that you're going through this challenging situation with your mom. It sounds like you're facing some difficult family dynamics and maybe experiencing emotional manipulation. Here are some steps you can take to address this situation: 1. Set Boundaries: It's important to set healthy boundaries to protect your mental and emotional well-being. If your mother's behavior is causing you distress, it may be time to assert some limits on what you will and won't accept. This may be difficult, but it is essential for your self-respect. 2. Communicate: Try to have an open and honest conversation with your mom about how you feel. Use \\"I\\" statements to avoid putting her on the defensive (e.g., \\"I feel hurt when I'm not treated equally regarding rent and living space\\"). 3. Seek Support: Reach out to friends, other family members, or a mental health professional who can provide you with emotional support and guidance. 4. Financial Independence: Work towards financial independence, if you haven't already. Being financially independent can give you the freedom to make decisions about where and how you live without being manipulated. 5. Living Arrangements: Consider whether you can change your living situation. If paying rent and not having a room is causing undue stress, it may be worth exploring other housing options where you will have more autonomy and be treated more fairly. 6. Take Time: Family relationships can be complex, and sometimes taking some time apart can be beneficial. You might find that some distance can help both you and your mother gain perspective on your relationship. 7. Professional Help: Consider seeking the help of a family therapist or mediator to help navigate and address the issues in your relationship with your mom in a safe and constructive environment. 8. Prioritize Your Well-being: Remember that your health and well-being must be your top priority. If staying in your current situation is harming you, it's important to prioritize your needs and consider making a change. It's crucial to protect your mental and emotional health during such a challenging time. If the situation between you and your mother does not improve or is causing significant distress, seeking external support is very important. Family therapy could be an option if your mother is willing to participate, but individual counseling could also provide you with tools and strategies to cope with your situation."},{"instruction":"Shared library in jenkins","output":"In Jenkins, a \\"shared library\\" refers to a set of reusable Groovy scripts that you can share across multiple Jenkins pipeline jobs. It's like a library of custom steps or methods that can be used to define common functionality or logic and avoid duplicating code across different Jenkinsfile or pipeline scripts. The shared library is defined externally to the jobs themselves, usually in a source code repository (like a Git repository). Once defined, it can be configured in the Jenkins system and then imported into any Jenkins pipeline job to use the functions or classes it defines. To set up a shared library, you will need to follow these general steps: 1. Write the shared library code: Write Groovy scripts to encapsulate the common functionality you want to provide. These should be structured according to the expected directory structure (see step 2). 2. Organize the shared library structure: Jenkins expects a specific directory structure for shared libraries: \`\`\` (root) +- src # Groovy source files | +- org | +- foo | +- Bar.groovy # for org.foo.Bar class | +- vars | +- myStep.groovy # for global 'myStep' variable | +- myStep.txt # help for 'myStep' variable | +- resources # resource files (non-Groovy files) +- org +- foo +- bar.json # static helper data for org.foo.Bar \`\`\` \`src\` contains reusable Groovy code. \`vars\` contains global variables that can be called from pipeline scripts. \`resources\` contains non-Groovy files that can be loaded by the Groovy classes, such as templates or configuration files. 3. Host the shared library in a version control system (VCS): Commit your shared library to a VCS like Git so that Jenkins can retrieve it. 4. Configure Jenkins to use the shared library: - Go to \\"Manage Jenkins\\" > \\"Configure System\\" in the Jenkins UI. - Find the \\"Global Pipeline Libraries\\" section and add the shared library, specifying the name you'll reference it by, its source code repository location, and which versions to use (branches, tags, etc.). 5. Import the shared library into your Jenkinsfile: In your Jenkins pipeline script (typically \`Jenkinsfile\`), you can then import and use the library with the \`@Library\` annotation or by using the \`library\` step. For example: \`\`\`groovy @Library('my-shared-library') _ pipeline { agent any stages { stage('Example') { steps { // Call a function from the shared library myStep() } } } } \`\`\` or \`\`\`groovy library('my-shared-library') pipeline { agent any stages { stage('Example') { steps { // Call a function from the shared library myStep() } } } } \`\`\` Please keep in mind that Jenkins needs to have proper access rights to the repository hosting the shared library. Additionally, Jenkins administrators can enable and configure shared libraries to be implicitly available to all pipelines, easing the overhead of importing them into every \`Jenkinsfile\`. Shared libraries are a powerful way to create a robust, maintainable, and reusable set of pipeline steps in Jenkins, helping teams to follow the DRY (Don't Repeat Yourself) principle in their CI/CD processes."},{"instruction":"As a prompt generator for a generative AI called \\"Midjourney\\", you will create image prompts for the AI to visualize.

As of my last update, the semiconductor industry is manufacturing processors with features sizes as small as 5 nm and has plans to push towards 3 nm and potentially even 2 nm nodes. The limits are determined by various factors, including the physics of how transistors operate at very small scales and the manufacturing technologies available. Quantum mechanical effects, such as quantum tunneling, become more significant as features sizes decrease, potentially interfering with the operation of conventional silicon-based transistors. Moreover, photolithography, the technique traditionally used to etch circuits onto silicon, is limited by the wavelength of light used. The advent of extreme ultraviolet lithography (EUV) has pushed the boundary further, but there is still a limit to how small features can be before traditional lithography techniques fail to be practical or effective. There is speculation about alternative materials like graphene or carbon nanotubes, or new transistor designs like Tunnel FETs (Field-Effect Transistors) that could potentially bypass some of the limitations of silicon. Quantum computing is another field that could redefine computational limits, albeit in a fundamentally different way than traditional transistor scaling. If we reach a point where it is no longer possible to shrink the feature sizes of individual transistors, further improvements would need to come from other innovations such as 3D stacking, improving processor architectures, new materials, and more efficient use of transistors. In terms of a hard theoretical limit, there are various opinions among experts. Some believe that features could potentially be reduced down to a few nanometers across—perhaps as low as 1 nm, which is just a few atoms wide—before the principles of conventional transistor operation fail. However, this is speculative and would require significant breakthroughs in material science and nanotechnology to become a reality."},{"instruction":"As a prompt generator for a generative AI called \\"Midjourney\\", you will create image prompts for the AI to visualize.

In the case of smart quotes being automatically replaced, several potential causes could exist: 1. **Input Sanitization:** The Gradio application or backend code may sanitize inputs to avoid execution of malicious code or to standardize the dataset. This process might convert smart quotes to their corresponding HTML entities or escape them, which could result in their replacement upon display. 2. **Frontend Code:** The JavaScript code in the frontend could have functions that format or manipulate the strings entered by the user or returned by the chatbot. Functions that process text, such as those that escape or unescape HTML entities, might replace smart quotes with straight ones. 3. **Backend Processing:** The backend AI model (e.g., deployed on OpenAI's servers) might be configured to standardize quotes for consistency in training data or output format. The code responsible for this wouldn't be visible in the HTML/CSS/JavaScript content provided since it resides on the server. 4. **Browser Behavior:** Some browsers automatically convert straight quotes to smart quotes when entering text in form fields, based on specific language or keyboard settings. This could be something that the chat application is compensating for by standardizing the quotes on display. 5. **CSS/Font Rendering:** In some cases, the way quotes appear can be affected by the CSS styling or the font used. If a particular font renders quotes as smart quotes by default, it could appear as though there's an automatic replacement when, in fact, it’s just a font display feature. From the provided HTML content, it's not possible to identify a specific point in the code that would be causing this replacement. Typically, such behavior would be defined in the JavaScript files that process the submissions of the chat and determine how inputs are handled, formatted, or displayed. To investigate this further, one would need to review the actual JavaScript event handlers and backend processing code which controls the behavior of the chatbot interface."},{"instruction":"just telling to you in this specific chat of that code above that you are constantly replacing everything to smart quotes, even code outputs which renders it illegal due the fact that there should be straight quotes strictly in code. now try understand on that code why it could happen. analyze that chat code normally.","output":"Based on the HTML provided and considering the behavior you've described, where smart quotes are replacing straight quotes even in code outputs, the issue might be related to the text processing on the frontend or the server-side. I can see that there are \`divs\` for the chat messages marked with \`data-testid=\\"bot\\"\` and \`data-testid=\\"user\\"\` that contain code and text outputs. However, the full backend logic responsible for this transformation is not visible in the HTML snippet, as that would be on the server-side (OpenAI's API in this case) or in external JavaScript files not included in the provided code. It's essential to understand that HTML provided doesn't contain any logic processing the messages. Any replacements taking place must be occurring through JavaScript functions or on the server that interprets the chat messages. Given this scenario, let's check a few potential sources of the issue: 1. **Server-side Processing**: If the chatbot is an AI model like GPT-3 or GPT-4, the server-side software might be returning responses with smart quotes. This could be part of the natural language processing that aims to make the language appear more natural or human-like by using typographically correct quotes. 2. **JavaScript String Handling**: If there are JavaScript functions processing the text before displaying them, look for any methods that might be converting straight quotes into smart quotes deliberately. This could be part of a text formatting function intending to \\"beautify\\" the output, but inadvertently affecting code snippets as well. 3. **Content-Type Rendering**: If the MIME type of the document is being set to \`text/plain\` or another non-HTML type, smart quote conversion would typically not be expected. However, for \`text/html\`, browsers sometimes beautify the text by converting straight quotes in regular text nodes to smart quotes based on language and locale settings. 4. **CSS**: Some fonts or CSS might cause quotes to appear as smart quotes purely as a rendering feature. This would mean that the underlying text actually has straight quotes, but they just look like smart quotes. 5. **Input Element Attributes**: HTML input elements have attributes like \`accept-charset\`, which could cause the browser to transform input characters, including quotes, depending on the character set being accepted. From the information provided, it's not possible to pinpoint the exact cause as the actual processing and transformation mechanics are not visible. To debug the issue properly, one would need access to: - The JavaScript files that manage the chatbot's responses. - The server-side processing code (API calls to OpenAI's server where transformations might be enforced). - Input handling code within the frontend. - The configurations for any WYSIWYG editors or input fields if used, which might have settings related to quote transformations. A closer examination of these aspects would be necessary to determine why smart quotes are replacing straight quotes even within code outputs."},{"instruction":"the problem that JavaScript is huge and it splitted in chunks","output":"When dealing with a large JavaScript codebase that's been split into chunks, as seen in modern web applications, troubleshooting specific issues can be challenging. These are some steps one can take to investigate and hopefully determine why straight quotes might be automatically replaced with smart quotes in the chat messages: 1. **Inspect the Network Activity:** Open the browser's Developer Tools, look under the Network tab, and inspect the XHR (XMLHttpRequest) or Fetch responses when chat messages are sent and received. This can show the raw response data from the server and help determine if the replacement is happening server-side or client-side. 2. **Search the Codebase:** If you have access to the code before it's bundled, you can search for functions that might be manipulating text. Look for methods like \`replace()\`, \`replaceAll()\`, or any other string manipulation functions that could be changing quotes. They may be part of a sanitization or formatting library. 3. **Static Analysis Tools:** Use linting tools or code editors with advanced search features to scan through the code for potentially problematic patterns, such as regex expressions that might be replacing quotes. 4. **Client-Side Debugging:** Set breakpoints in the developers' console in areas where chat messages are handled. You can monitor variables and watch expressions as they change to see where the conversion might occur. 5. **Disable JavaScript Minification:** If the code you're inspecting is minified, try to locate an unminified version of the code, or use source maps within Developer Tools to see the original source code that corresponds to the bundled and minified code. 6. **Review Message Handling Code:** Find the code responsible for crafting and displaying chat messages. This will likely involve tracing back from the DOM elements with \`data-testid\` values \\"bot\\" and \\"user\\". You can modify the HTML to add breakpoint attributes like \`onclick=\\"debugger;\\"\` to catch the exact moment when innerHTML is altered. 7. **API Documentation:** Check the official documentation for the OpenAI API (or any other AI model you are using) to see if there are any notes on text formatting or character replacements. 8. **Server-Side Code:** If possible, inspect the server code or configurations that determine how the AI model processes and returns text. Look for any string formatting that occurs before the response is sent to the frontend. 9. **Community and Support Channels:** If you're using a third-party API or library (like Gradio with OpenAI), there may be community forums, GitHub issues, or support channels where this issue has been discussed or documented. By performing these investigative steps, you should be able to gain insights into where and why the text is being altered. These steps are reasonably standard when working with modern web applications that utilize dynamic code splitting and have complex interactions between the client-side and server-side environments."},{"instruction":"what unicode codes for these quotes?: “”","output":"The Unicode codes for the double curly quotes “” (also known as smart quotes, typographic quotes, or curly quotes) are: - Left double quotation mark “ : U+201C - Right double quotation mark ” : U+201D To use them in HTML, you can use the corresponding HTML entities: - Left double quotation mark “ : \`&ldquo;\` or \`&#8220;\` - Right double quotation mark ” : \`&rdquo;\` or \`&#8221;\`"},{"instruction":"searching now in this chat javascript","output":"It seems that within the provided HTML content, the JavaScript code has been minified and compiled into separate chunks, making it difficult to inspect directly for any mention of smart quote replacements. Unfortunately, the actual JavaScript code blocks responsible for potentially converting straight quotes to smart quotes are not included in the snippet you've provided. In order to locate where in the JavaScript smart quotes might be handled, you would need to search through the JavaScript files that have been loaded into the application. You mentioned that the JavaScript is extensive and split into chunks, which is typical in modern web applications that employ code-splitting for performance optimization. To search through the JavaScript for code that might be handling quote replacement: 1. **Use Developer Tools:** Access the \\"Sources\\" tab in your browser’s developer tools. You can look at the list of script files that are loaded and examine them. If source maps are available, you can view the original source code structure even if the files are minified. 2. **Search for Character Codes:** Use the developer tools' search feature (often accessed by pressing \`Ctrl + F\` or \`Cmd + F\` within the \\"Sources\\" tab) to look for the character codes \`U+201C\` and \`U+201D\`, or their HTML entity counterparts \`&ldquo;\` and \`&rdquo;\`. 3. **Network Tab:** Check the Network tab as the page loads to see the JavaScript files being fetched. Sometimes, the files have descriptive names that can give you hints about their contents, even if they are minified. 4. **Review Bundled Code:** Look for sections in the JavaScript bundles that deal with text formatting, input/output processing, or chat functionality. It's likely that the quote replacement logic would be located in functions related to these areas. 5. **Check for String Replacement Logic:** If you can access the full script files, use global search functionality in your code editor to look for string methods like \`.replace()\`, regex expressions, or other potential code that could convert straight quotes into smart quotes. 6. **Disable Minification Locally:** If you have access to the build process, you could build a non-minified version of the application locally to make the code more human-readable. Keep in mind that the issue might not be purely related to static replacement logic in the JavaScript. It could involve dynamic content processing by the server, especially since the chat response in question would be generated by an AI model like GPT-3 or GPT-4, and that code wouldn’t reside in the JavaScript files."},{"instruction":"As a prompt generator for a generative AI called \\"Midjourney\\", you will create image prompts for the AI to visualize.

Come posso aiutarti oggi?"},{"instruction":"Puoi spiegarmi passo passo come verificare su renault clio 4 se c è corrente sull interruttore portellone?","output":"Verificare se c'è corrente sull'interruttore del portellone di una Renault Clio 4 richiede un po' di conoscenza dei sistemi elettrici dell'auto e l'uso di un tester o multimetro. Ecco una guida passo passo su come potresti procedere, ma ti ricordo che se non ti senti a tuo agio con il lavoro elettrico sull'auto, potrebbe essere meglio lasciare questa operazione a un meccanico professionista. Passo 1: Preparazione - Assicurati che il motore sia spento e che la chiave non sia nell'avviamento. - Apri il portellone posteriore per accedere all'interruttore del portellone. Passo 2: Trova l'interruttore del portellone - L'interruttore del portellone si trova solitamente vicino al meccanismo di chiusura del portellone stesso; potrebbe essere nascosto da una copertura di plastica o situato in un'area accessibile. Passo 3: Prepara il multimetro - Imposta il multimetro su misurazione di tensione continua (Volt DC). Passo 4: Localizza i fili dell'interruttore - Identifica i fili che vanno all'interruttore; ci dovrebbero essere almeno due fili. Passo 5: Accedi ai fili dell'interruttore - Se necessario, scollega il connettore dell'interruttore per accedere ai fili. Questo può richiedere di sollevare piccole clip o di sganciare un connettore di sicurezza. Passo 6: Misura la tensione - Con l'interruttore scollegato, tocca con la sonda del multimetro (+) il filo di alimentazione (tipicamente rosso o con una striscia positiva) e con l'altra sonda (-) tocca una parte metallica ben pulita del telaio dell'auto per fare massa. - Chiedi a un assistente di accendere la chiave di accensione (senza avviare il motore) per attivare il circuito elettrico. Passo 7: Verifica la lettura del multimetro - Se il circuito è alimentato correttamente, dovresti vedere una lettura positiva sul multimetro, generalmente intorno ai 12 volt. Se non c'è lettura, potrebbe esserci un problema con l'alimentazione elettrica, come un fusibile bruciato, una connessione sciolta o un interruttore difettoso. Se ti risulta ci sia corrente e l'interruttore ancora non funziona, l'interruttore stesso potrebbe essere guasto. Se non c'è corrente, potrebbe essere necessario controllare il fusibile corrispondente o i cablaggi per eventuali problemi. Ricorda sempre di lavorare con cautela quando si maneggiano i componenti elettrici dell'auto. Se non sei sicuro delle procedure o delle tecniche di sicurezza, è sempre meglio consultare un professionista."},{"instruction":"Quindi non devo toccare entrambi i fili con il tester?","output":"Mi scuso per la confusione. In effetti, durante la misurazione della tensione, non dovresti toccare contemporaneamente entrambi i fili con un singolo tester impostato per misurare la tensione, poiché ciò potrebbe causare un cortocircuito. Ecco come dovresti misurare la tensione agli estremi dell'interruttore del portellone: 1. **Prepara il Multimetro**: Imposta il multimetro per misurare la tensione continua (V DC). 2. **Accedi ai Filo dell'Interruttore**: Individua i fili che arrivano all'interruttore del portellone e accedi ad essi, eventualmente scollegando il connettore se l’interruttore è collegato tramite uno. Sii gentile e fai attenzione a non danneggiare i connettori o i fili. 3. **Trova un Punto di Messa a Terra**: Trova un punto metallico non verniciato sulla carrozzeria o sul telaio dell'auto da utilizzare come terra per il multimetro. 4. **Misura la Tensione dell’Alimentazione**: - Colloca una sonda del multimetro (rosso, positivo) sul terminale del filo che presumibilmente fornisce la tensione positiva all’interruttore (di solito rosso o con una striscia colorata indicante il polo positivo). - Colloca l'altra sonda (nero, negativo) sul punto di massa che hai identificato sul telaio o sulla carrozzeria dell'auto. 5. **Attiva il Circuito**: Chiedi ad un assistente di inserire la chiave di accensione (senza avviare il motore) per attivare il circuito del portellone. 6. **Verifica la Lettura**: - Osserva il display del tester per la lettura della tensione. Se vedi una lettura di circa 12 volt (o la tensione nominale della batteria dell'auto), allora c'è tensione che arriva all'interruttore. - Se non vedi alcuna lettura, potrebbe significare che non c'è tensione che arriva all’interruttore, a causa di problemi come un fusibile bruciato, un relè guasto, un cablaggio difettoso, o problemi con l'alimentazione elettrica. Se rilevi correttamente la tensione all'interruttore, ma il portellone non funziona come dovrebbe, l'interruttore stesso potrebbe essere guasto. Se non rilevi tensione, dovrai continuare la diagnosi procedendo con il controllo dei collegamenti relativi fino alla fonte (fusibile, relè, e unità di controllo se presente). Ricorda sempre di lavorare con sicurezza, soprattutto con sistemi elettrici. Se non sei a tuo agio con queste operazioni, o se il problema persiste, ti consiglio di contattare un professionista o un elettrauto."},{"instruction":"Se mettessi il puntale sull filo negativo e l'altro a massa cosaysuvvederebbe?","output":"Se posizioni una sonda del tester sul filo negativo (o neutro) dell'interruttore e l'altra sonda la metti a massa (su un punto metallico non verniciato del veicolo che fa contatto diretto con il telaio o la carrozzeria), il multimetro configurato per misurare tensione continua dovrebbe mostrare una lettura molto vicina a zero. Questo perché sia il filo negativo (o neutro) dell'interruttore che il punto di massa a cui vai a toccare dovrebbero avere lo stesso potenziale elettrico, ovvero quello della terra del veicolo. Tuttavia, in alcuni casi potresti ottenere una piccola lettura di tensione se c'è resistenza nei collegamenti a terra o c'è un problema con la massa del veicolo, come una connessione arrugginita o allentata. Questo potrebbe indicare che il ritorno a terra non è efficiente come dovrebbe essere. È importante notare che, in un sistema elettrico funzionante, non dovrebbe esserci tensione significativa tra un filo neutro (o filo di ritorno) e la massa del veicolo; la loro funzione primaria è di completare il circuito permettendo il ritorno dell'elettricità alla fonte. Mentre testi, assicurati che il collegamento alla parte del telaio o della carrozzeria sia buono, perché una cattiva connessione potrebbe darti letture inaffidabili."},{"instruction":"Dovrebbero esserci solo 2 fili?","output":"In molti interruttori, compresi quelli per sistemi semplici come un interruttore del portellone, è comune avere due fili collegati. Uno è per l'alimentazione (+) e l'altro per il ritorno a terra (-). Quando l'interruttore è chiuso (attivato), si completa il circuito permettendo il passaggio di corrente e attivando la funzione per cui è stato progettato, ad esempio per illuminare la luce del bagagliaio o per segnalare che il portellone è aperto. Tuttavia, in alcuni sistemi più complessi o per alcuni tipi di sensori, potrebbero esserci più dei due fili tipici. Ad esempio, potrebbero esserci aggiunti fili per: 1. **Segnali di Feedback**: Per trasmettere un segnale alla centralina dell'auto che confermi l'azione dell'interruttore o lo stato del portellone, come aperto o chiuso. 2. **Illuminazione Integrata**: Se l'interruttore ha un LED o un'altra forma di illuminazione integrata per indicare lo stato, potrebbero esserci fili addizionali per alimentare tale luce. 3. **Sensori di Posizione**: Un sensore potrebbe avere fili addizionali per vari segnali in uscita, per alimentazione supplementare, per comunicazioni in serie o per reti CAN bus. 4. **Sicurezza o Funzioni Speciali**: Alcuni interruttori possono avere circuiti di sicurezza integrati o altri requisiti che necessitano di fili supplementari. Per una Renault Clio 4 o per interruttori simili relativi a portelloni o coperchi bagagliaio, di solito possiamo aspettarci un sistema relativamente semplice, ma sarà sempre importante verificare il manuale di servizio specifico del veicolo o consultare una fonte di dati riparazione per informazioni precise sui cablaggi."},{"instruction":"Nel caso ci fossero più fili come riconosco il positivo","output":"Se ci sono più fili e devi identificare quale sia il positivo (+), ecco alcuni passaggi che puoi seguire per facilitare l'identificazione: 1. **Controllo Visivo**: Spesso, i cavi sono codificati con colori standard dove, ad esempio, il rosso indica un positivo (+) e il nero indica un negativo (-) o terra. Tuttavia, non tutti i veicoli seguono lo stesso schema di colori, quindi questa regola non è universale. 2. **Schema Elettrico**: Consulta lo schema elettrico della Renault Clio 4, che puoi trovare nel manuale di riparazione o di servizio. Questo dovrebbe mostrarti quale colore o posizione nel connettore corrisponde al filo positivo. 3. **Test di Continuità**: Se hai accesso alle terminazioni o ai fusibili e conosci il percorso del circuito, puoi impostare il multimetro sulla modalità di test di continuità (simbolo di cicalino o Ω) e verificare se c'è continuità tra il filo in questione e il polo positivo della batteria o il suo punto di terminazione positiva. 4. **Multimetro**: Con il veicolo spento e la chiave di accensione posizionata in modo da alimentare quell'intervallo del circuito: - Imposta il multimetro su \\"tensione continua\\" (V DC). - Attacca la punta del cavo nero (negativo) del multimetro a un buon punto di messa a terra sulla carrozzeria dell'auto. - Tocca con la punta del cavo rosso (positivo) ogni filo per vedere quale mostra la tensione attesa (spesso intorno ai 12V). Il filo che mostra questa tensione (con il circuito attivo/chiave girata) è molto probabilmente il positivo. Attenzione: Durante questo procedimento, è molto importante non causare cortocircuiti, toccando insieme i fili con il tester, in quanto potrebbe danneggiare il sistema elettrico del veicolo o il tester stesso. 5. **Manuale del Proprietario**: Puoi anche consultare il manuale del proprietario o le guide tecniche, che talvolta includono dettagli sulla cablatura. 6. **Consultare un Professionista**: Se tutti questi metodi falliscono o non sei sicuro di come procedere, è più sicuro consultare un tecnico qualificato che possieda la conoscenza specifica del tuo modello di veicolo. Ricordati di prendere sempre le opportune precauzioni di sicurezza quando lavori con sistemi elettrici di veicoli."},{"instruction":"Toccando più fili per cercare il positivo posso creare problemi?","output":"Sì, toccare più fili contemporaneamente con i puntali del tester mentre si cerca il positivo può potenzialmente causare problemi se non si presta attenzione. Ecco alcuni motivi per cui questo può essere pericoloso e come evitarli: 1. **Cortocircuiti**: Se tocchi accidentalmente un filo positivo e uno negativo contemporaneamente con i puntali del multimetro impostati in modo errato (ad esempio in modalità resistenza o continuità), potresti causare un cortocircuito. Ciò potrebbe danneggiare il circuito elettrico, i fusibili, i componenti elettronici o il tester stesso. 2. **Danni ai Componenti Elettronici**: Toccare più fili potrebbe inviare tensione a parti del circuito dove non dovrebbe esserci, causando danni a componenti sensibili come ECU (unità di controllo motore), sensori o altri moduli. 3. **Corrente di Prova**: Alcuni tester inviano una piccola corrente quando sono impostati su determinate modalità, come la misura di resistenza o il test di diodo. Questa corrente potrebbe danneggiare componenti elettronici se applicata in maniera inappropriata. 4. **Sovraccarichi**: La misurazione di tensione su fili che si presume siano del circuito positivo può anche causare sovraccarichi se c'è una resistenza all'interno del componente a cui è collegato il filo. Per evitare questi problemi: - Utilizza il tester solo in modalità di misurazione di tensione continua (V DC) quando tocchi i fili per trovare il positivo. - Non toccare mai contemporaneamente due fili diversi con i puntali del tester. Tocca solo un filo alla volta con il puntale positivo (rosso) mentre il puntale negativo (nero) è connesso a un punto di terra. - Assicurati che il multimetro sia impostato correttamente per la misurazione che si intende fare e che i suoi puntali siano in buono stato. - Procedi con cautela, soprattutto se non sei sicuro del circuito o se sei inesperto nel lavoro con i sistemi elettrici. Se non sei sicuro di come procedere o non capisci bene la procedura, rivolgiti a un professionista qualificato per evitare rischi e danni al tuo veicolo. Un'elettrauto certificato avrà gli strumenti adeguati e l'esperienza per condurre questi test in modo sicuro e accurato."},{"instruction":"Ok la procedura corretta è mettere il puntale negativo a massa e con il positivo cercare uno alla volta il cavo positivo evitando di toccare più fili contemporaneamente. Corretto?","output":"Sì, esattamente. La procedura corretta per identificare il filo positivo è la seguente: 1. Imposta il multimetro sulla modalità di misurazione della tensione continua (V DC). 2. Connettiti a una buona massa sul veicolo con il puntale nero (negativo) del multimetro. Questo può essere un punto metallico non verniciato sulla carrozzeria dell'auto o qualsiasi parte metallica che sia collegata al telaio o al sistema di massa del veicolo. 3. Con il puntale rosso (positivo) del multimetro, tocca ciascun filo individualmente e controlla la lettura sul multimetro. Ricorda di fare questo test uno alla volta per evitare cortocircuiti o danni ai sistemi elettrici. 4. Il filo che, quando toccato con il puntale positivo, mostra una lettura di tensione vicina a quella della batteria del veicolo (generalmente intorno ai 12-14 V quando il motore non è in funzione) è il filo di alimentazione positivo. 5. Prima di iniziare a testare, assicurati che il circuito che stai testando sia attivo, il che potrebbe significare girare la chiave di accensione in posizione \\"ON\\" ma senza avviare il motore, se necessario. Ecco alcuni suggerimenti di sicurezza da tenere in considerazione quando usi il multimetro per testare i sistemi elettrici: - Assicurati che il veicolo sia spento e chiave rimossa quando stai impostando le connessioni del multimetro per iniziare i test. - Utilizza sempre uno strumento che sia in buone condizioni e che sia idoneo per l'uso automobilistico. - Evita di lavorare in ambienti umidi per prevenire il rischio di shock elettrici. - Inizia sempre dai livelli di tensione più alti del multimetro e riducili man mano che identifichi la tensione nel circuito; questo è per prevenire danni al multimetro causati da una sovratensione accidentale. - Non lavorare mai da solo – avere un assistente è sempre utile nel caso sopraggiungano problemi. Questa metodologia non solo aiuterà a identificare correttamente il filo positivo, ma ti aiuterà a farlo in modo sicuro."},{"instruction":"Ok capito.
