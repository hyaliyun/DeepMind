PTQ4ViT: Post-Training Quantization for Vision Transformers with Twin Uniform Quantization Zhihang Yuan 1 , 3 ⋆ , Chenhao Xue 1 ⋆ , Yiqi Chen 1 , Qiang Wu 3 , and Guangyu Sun 2 ⋆⋆ 1 School of Computer Science, Peking University {yuanzhihang, <PRESIDIO_ANONYMIZED_EMAIL_ADDRESS> 2 School of Integrated Circuits, Peking University <PRESIDIO_ANONYMIZED_EMAIL_ADDRESS> 3 Houmo AI Abstract. Quantization is one of the most effective methods to compress neural networks, which has achieved great success on convolutional neural networks (CNNs). Recently, vision transformers have demonstrated great potential in computer vision. However, previous post-training quantization methods performed not well on vision transformer, resulting in more than 1% accuracy drop even in 8-bit quantization. Therefore, we analyze the problems of quantization on vision transformers. We observe the distributions of activation values after softmax and GELU functions are quite different from the Gaussian distribution. We also observe that common quantization metrics, such as MSE and cosine distance, are inaccurate to determine the optimal scaling factor. In this paper, we propose the twin uniform quantization method to reduce the quantization error on these activation values. And we propose to use a Hessian guided metric to evaluate different scaling factors, which improves the accuracy of calibration at a small cost. To enable the fast quantization of vision transformers, we develop an efficient framework, PTQ4ViT. Experiments show the quantized vision transformers achieve near-lossless prediction accuracy (less than 0.5% drop at 8-bit quantization) on the ImageNet classification task. 1 Introduction The self-attention module is the basic building block of the transformer to capture global information [23]. Inspired by the success of transformers [6,2] on natural language processing (NLP) tasks, researchers have brought the self-attention module into computer vision [ 7 ,15]. They replaced the convolution layers in convolutional neural networks (CNNs) with self-attention modules and they called these networks vision transformers. Vision transformers are comparable to CNNs on many computer vision tasks and have great potential to be deployed on various applications [11]. ⋆ First author and Second Author contribute equally to this paper. ⋆⋆ Corresponding author arXiv:2111.12293v2 [cs.CV] 27 Jul 2022 2 Z.

However, both the CNN and the vision transformer are computationally intensive and consume much energy. The larger and larger scales of neural networks block their deployment on various hardware devices, such as mobile phones and IoT devices, and increase carbon emissions. It is required to compress these neural networks. Quantization is one of the most effective ways to compress neural networks [9]. The floating-point values are quantized to integers with a low bitwidth, reducing the memory consumption and the computation cost. There are two types of quantization methods, quantization-aware training (QAT) [4,28] and post-training quantization (PTQ) [1,5]. Although QAT can generate the quantized network with a lower accuracy drop, the training of the network requires a training dataset, a long optimization time, and the tuning of hyper-parameters. Therefore, QAT is impractical when the training dataset is not available or rapid deployment is required. While PTQ quantizes the network with unlabeled calibration images after training, which enables fast quantization and deployment. Although PTQ has achieved great success on CNNs, directly bringing it to vision transformer results in more than 1% accuracy drop even with 8-bit quantization [16]. Therefore, we analyze the problems of quantization on vision transformers. We collect the distribution of activation values in the vision transformer and observe there are some special distributions. 1) The values after softmax have a very unbalanced distribution in [0, 1], where most of them are very close to zero. Although the number of large values is very small, they mean high attention between two patches, which is of vital importance in the attention mechanism. This requires a large scaling factor to make the quantization range cover the large value. However, a big scaling factor quantizes the small values to zero, resulting in a large quantization error. 2) The values after the GELU PTQ4ViT 3 function have an asymmetrical distribution, where the positive values have a large distribution range while the negative values have a very small distribution range. It’s difficult to well quantify both the positive values and negative values with uniform quantization. Therefore, we propose the twin uniform quantization, which separately quantifies the values in two ranges. To enable its efficient processing on hardware devices, we design a data format and constrain the scaling factors of the two ranges. The second problem is that the metric to determine the optimal scaling factor is not accurate on vision transformers. There are various metrics in previous PTQ methods, including MSE, cosine distance, and Pearson correlation coefficient between the layer outputs before and after quantization. However, we observe they are inaccurate to evaluate different scaling factor candidates because only the local information is used. Therefore, we propose to use the Hessian guided metric to determine the quantization parameters, which is more accurate. The proposed methods are demonstrated in Fig. 1. We develop a post-training quantization framework for vision transformers using twin uniform quantization, PTQ4ViT. 4 Experiments show the quantized vision transformers (ViT, DeiT, and Swin) achieve near-lossless prediction accuracy (less than 0.5% drop at 8-bit quantization) on the ImageNet classification task. Our contributions are listed as follows: – We find the problems in PTQ on vision transformers are special distributions of post-softmax and post-GELU activations and the inaccurate metric. – We propose the twin uniform quantization to handle the special distributions, which can be efficiently processed on existing hardware devices including CPU and GPU. – We propose to use the Hessian guided metric to determine the optimal scaling factors, which replaces the inaccurate metrics. – The quantized networks achieve near-lossless prediction accuracy, making PTQ acceptable on vision transformers. 2 Background and Related Work 2.1 Vision Transformer In the last few years, convolution neural networks (CNNs) have achieved great success in computer vision. The convolution layer is a fundamental component of CNNs to extract features using local information. Recently, the position of CNNs in computer vision is challenged by vision transformers, which take the self-attention modules [23] to make use of the global information. DETR [3] is the first work to replace the object detection head with a transformer, which directly regresses the bounding boxes and achieves comparable results with the CNN-based head. ViT [7] is the first architecture that replaces all convolution 4 Code is in https://github.com/hahnyuan/PTQ4ViT. 4 Z. Yuan et al. layers, which achieves better results on image classification tasks. Following ViT, various vision transformer architectures have been proposed to boost performance [25,15]. Vision transformers have been successfully applied to downstream tasks [15,24,12]. They have great potential for computer vision tasks [11]. The input of a transformer is a sequence of vectors. An image is divided into several patches and a linear projection layer is used to project each patch to a vector. These vectors form the input sequence of the vision transformer. We denote these vectors as X ∈ RN×D, where N is the number of patches and D is the hidden size, which is the size of the vector after linear projection. A vision transformer contains some blocks. As shown in Fig. 1, each block is composed of a multi-head self-attention module (MSA) and a multi-layer perceptron (MLP). MSA generates the attention between different patches to extract features with global information. Typical MLP contains two fully-connected layers (FC) and the GELU activation function is used after the first layer. The input sequence is first fed into each self-attention head of MSA. In each head, the sequence is linearly projected to three matrices, query Q = XWQ, key K = XW K, and value V = XWV . Then, matrix multiplication QKT calculates the attention scores between patches. The softmax function is used to normalize these scores to attention probability P. The output of the head is matrix multiplication P V . The process is formulated as Eq. (1): text {Attention}(Q,K,V)=text {softmax}(frac {QK^T}{sqrt {d}})V, label {self-attention} (1) where d is the hidden size of head. The outputs of multiple heads are concatenated together as the output of MSA. Vision transformers have a large amount of memory, computation, and energy consumption, which hinders their deployment in real-world applications. Researchers have proposed a lot of methods to compress vision transformers, such as patch pruning [21], knowledge distillation [13] ,and quantization [16]. 2.2 Quantization Network quantization is one of the most effective methods to compress neural networks. The weight values and activation values are transformed from floatingpoint to integer with lower bit-width, which significantly decreases the memory consumption, data movement, and energy consumption. The uniform symmetric quantization is the most widely used method, which projects a floating-point value x to a k-bit integer value xq with a scaling factor ∆: x_q=Psi _k(x,Delta )=text {clamp}(text {round}(frac {x}{Delta }),-2^{k-1},2^{k-1}-1), label {sym_quant} (2) where round projects a value to an integer and clamp constrains the output in the range that k-bit integer can represent. We propose the twin uniform quantization, which separately quantifies the values in two ranges. [8] also uses multiple quantization ranges. However, their method targets CNN and is not PTQ4ViT 5 suitable for ViT. They use an extra bit to represent which range is used, taking 12.5% more storage than our method. Moreover, they use FP32 computation to align the two ranges, which is not efficient. Our method uses the shift operation, avoiding the format transformation and extra FP32 multiplication and FP32 addition. There are two types of quantization methods, quantization-aware training (QAT) [4,28] and post-training quantization (PTQ) [1,5]. QAT methods combine quantization with network training. It optimizes the quantization parameters to minimize the task loss on a labeled training dataset. QAT can be used to quantize transformers [18]. Q-BERT [20] uses the Hessian spectrum to evaluate the sensitivity of the different tensors for mixed-precision, achieving 3-bit weight and 8-bit activation quantization. Although QAT achieves lower bit-width, it requires a training dataset, a long quantization time, and hyper-parameter tuning. PTQ methods quantize networks with a small number of unlabeled images, which is significantly faster than QAT and doesn’t require any labeled dataset. PTQ methods should determine the scaling factors ∆ of activations and weights for each layer. Choukroun et al. [5] proposed to minimize the mean square error (MSE) between the tensors before and after quantization. EasyQuant [27] uses the cosine distance to improve the quantization performance on CNN. Recently, Liu et al. [16] first proposed a PTQ method to quantize the vision transformer. Pearson correlation coefficient and ranking loss are used as the metrics to determine the scaling factors. However, these metrics are inaccurate to evaluate different scaling factor candidates because only the local information is used. 3 Method In this section, we will first introduce a base PTQ method for vision transformers. Then, we will analyze the problems of quantization using the base PTQ and propose methods to address the problems. Finally, we will introduce our posttraining quantization framework, PTQ4ViT. 3.1 Base PTQ for Vision Transformer Matrix multiplication is used in the fully-connected layer and the computation of QKT and P V , which is the main operation in vision transformers. In this paper, we formulate it as O = AB and we will focus on its quantization. A and B are quantized to k-bit using the symmetric uniform quantization with scaling factors ∆A and ∆B. According to Eq. (2), we have Aq = Ψk(A, ∆A) and Bq = Ψk(B, ∆B). In base PTQ, the distance of the output before and after quantization is used as metric to determine the scaling factors, which is formulated as: min _{Delta _A,Delta _B}text {distance}(O,hat {O}), label {optimization} (3) where Oˆ is the output of the matrix multiplication after quantization Oˆ = ∆A∆BAqBq. 6 Z.

The same as [27], we use cosine distance as the metric to calculate the distance. We make the search spaces of ∆A and ∆B by linearly dividing [α Amax 2 k−1 , β Amax 2 k−1 ] and [α Bmax 2 k−1 , β Bmax 2 k−1 ] to n candidates, respectively. Amax and Bmax are the maximum absolute value of A and B. α and β are two parameters to control the search range. We alternatively search for the optimal scaling factors ∆∗ A and ∆∗ B in the search space. Firstly, ∆B is fixed, and we search for the optimal ∆A to minimize distance(O, Oˆ). Secondly, ∆A is fixed, and we search for the optimal ∆B to minimize distance(O, Oˆ). ∆A and ∆B are alternately optimized for several rounds. The values of A and B are collected using unlabeled calibration images. We search for the optimal scaling factors of activation or weight layer-by-layer. However, the base PTQ results in more than 1% accuracy drop on quantized vision transformer in our experiments. 3.2 Twin Uniform Quantization The activation values in CNNs are usually considered Gaussian distributed. Therefore, most PTQ quantization methods are based on this assumption to determine the scaling factor. However, we observe the distributions of post-softmax values and post-GELU values are quite special as shown in Fig. 2. Specifically, (1) The distribution of activations after softmax is very unbalanced, in which most values are very close to zero and only a few values are close to one. (2) The values after the GELU function have a highly asymmetric distribution, in which the unbounded positive values are large while the negative values have a very small distribution range. As shown in Fig. 3, we demonstrate the quantization points of the uniform quantization using different scaling factors. For the values after softmax, a large value means that there is a high correlation between the two patches, which is important in the self-attention mechanism. A larger scaling factor can reduce the quantization error of these large PTQ4ViT 7 0.00 0.25 0.50 0.75 1.00 000 001 010 011 100 101 110 111 quantization point in R1 quantization point in R2 0.0 0.5 1.0 1.5 011 010 001 000 100 101 110 111 quantization point in R1 quantization point in R2 positive values negative values Fig. 4: Demonstration of the 3-bit twin uniform quantization on post-softmax values (left) and post-GELU values (right). We annotate the binary values for different quantization points. values, which causes smaller values to be quantized to zero. While a small scaling factor makes the large values quantized to small values, which significantly decreases the intensity of attention between two patches. For the values after GELU, it is difficult to quantify both positive and negative values well with symmetric uniform quantization. Non-uniform quantization [10] can be used to solve the problem. It can set the quantization points according to the distribution, ensuring the overall quantization error is small. However, most hardware devices cannot efficiently process the non-uniform quantized values. Acceleration can be achieved only on specially designed hardware. We propose the twin uniform quantization, which can be efficiently processed on existing hardware devices including CPUs and GPUs. As shown in Fig. 4, twin uniform quantization has two quantization ranges, R1 and R2, which are controlled by two scaling factors ∆R1 and ∆R2, respectively. The k-bit twin uniform quantization is be formulated as: text {T}_k(x,Delta _{text {R1}},Delta _{text {R2}})=begin {cases}Psi _{k-1}(x,Delta _{text {R1}}), xin text {R1} Psi _{k-1}(x,Delta _{text {R2}}), otherwiseend {cases}. label {twin_quant_func} (4) For values after softmax, the values in R1 = [0, 2 k−1∆s R1) can be well quantified by using a small ∆s R1. To avoid the effect of calibration dataset, we keeps ∆s R2 fixed to 1/2 k−1 . Therefore, R2 = [0, 1] can cover the whole range, and large values can be well quantified in R2. For activation values after GELU, negative values are located in R1 = [−2 k−1∆ g R1, 0] and positive values are located in R2=[0, 2 k−1∆ g R2]. We also keep ∆ g R1 fixed to make R1 just cover the entire range of negative numbers. Since different quantization parameters are used for positive and negative values respectively, the quantization error can be effectively reduced. When calibrating the network, we search for the optimal ∆s R1 and ∆ g R2. The uniform symmetric quantization uses the k bit signed integer data format. It consists of one sign bit and k − 1 bits representing the quantity. In order to efficiently store the twin-uniform-quantized values, we design a new data format. The most significant bit is the range flag to represent which range is used (0 for R1, 1 for R2). The other k−1 bits compose an unsigned number to represent 8 Z.

The x-axis is the normalized scaling factor by dividing Amax 2 k−1 or Bmax 2 k−1 . the quantity. Because the sign of values in the same range is the same, the sign bit is removed. Data in different ranges need to be multiplied and accumulated in matrix multiplication. In order to efficiently process with the twin-uniform-quantized values on CPUs or GPUs, we constrain the two ranges with ∆R2 = 2m∆R1, where m is an unsigned integer. Assuming aq is quantized in R1 and bq is quantized in R2, the two values can be aligned: a_qtimes Delta _{text {R1}}+b_qtimes Delta _{text {R2}}=(a_q+b_qtimes 2^{m})Delta _{text {R1}}. (5) We left shift bq by m bits, which is the same as multiplying the value by 2m. The shift operation is very efficient on CPUs or GPUs. Without this constraint, multiplication is required to align the scaling factor, which is much more expensive than shift operations. 3.3 Hessian Guided Metric Next, we will analyze the metrics to determine the scaling factors of each layer. Previous works [5,27,16] greedily determine the scaling factors of inputs and weights layer by layer. They use various kinds of metrics, such as MSE and cosine distance, to measure the distance between the original and the quantized outputs. The change in the internal output is considered positively correlated with the task loss, so it is used to calculate the distance. We plot the performance of different metrics in Fig. 5. We observe that MSE, cosine distance, and Pearson correlation coefficient are inaccurate compared with task loss (cross-entropy) on vision transformers. The optimal scaling factors based on them are not consistent with that based on task loss. For instance, on blocks.6.mlp.fc1:activation, they indicate that a scaling factor around PTQ4ViT 9 0.4 Amax 2 k−1 is the optimal one, while the scaling factor around 0.75 Amax 2 k−1 is the optimal according to the task loss. Using these metrics, we get sub-optimal scaling factors, causing the accuracy degradation. The distance between the last layer’s output before and after quantization can be more accurate in PTQ. However, using it to determine the scaling factors of internal layers is impractical because it requires executing the network many times to calculate the last layer’s output, which consumes too much time. To achieve high accuracy and quick quantization at the same time, we propose to use the Hessian guided metric to determine the scaling factors. In the classification task, the task loss is L = CE(ˆy, y), where CE is cross-entropy, ˆy is the output of the network, and y is the ground truth5 . When we treat the weights as variables, the expectation of loss is a function of weight E[L(W)]. The quantization brings a small perturbation ϵ on weight Wˆ = W + ϵ. We can analyze the influence of quantization on task loss by Taylor series expansion. mathbb {E}[L(hat {W})]-mathbb {E}[L(W)]approx epsilon ^T bar {g}^{(W)}+frac {1}{2}epsilon ^T bar {H}^{(W)}epsilon , (6) where ¯g (W) is the gradients and H¯ (W) is the Hessian matrix. The target is to find the scaling factors to minimize the influence: min∆(E[L(Wˆ )] − E[L(W)]). Based on the layer-wise reconstruction method in [14], the optimization can be approximated6 by: begin {aligned} min _{Delta }mathbb {E}[(hat {O^l}-O^l)^Tdiagbig ((frac {partial L}{partial O^l_1})^2 ,dots , (frac {partial L}{partial O^l_{|O^l|}})^2big ) (hat {O^l}-O^l)], end {aligned} label {hessian_optimization} (7) where Ol and Oˆl are the outputs of the l-th layer before and after quantization, respectively. As shown in Fig. 5, the optimal scaling factor indicated by Hessian guided metric is closer to that indicated by task loss (CE). Although it still has a gap with the task loss, Hessian guided metric significantly improves the performance. For instance, on blocks.6.mlp.fc1:activation, the optimal scaling factor indicated by Hessian guided metric has less influence on task loss than other metrics. 3.4 PTQ4ViT Framework To achieve fast quantization and deployment, we develop an efficient post-training quantization framework for vision transformers, PTQ4ViT. Its flow is described in Algorithm 1. It supports the twin uniform quantization and Hessian guided metric. There are two quantization phases. 1) The first phase is to collect the output and the gradient of the output in each layer before quantization. The outputs of the l-th layer Ol are calculated through forward propagation on the calibration dataset. The gradients ∂L ∂Ol 1 , . . . , ∂L ∂Ol a are calculated through backward 5 The ground truth y is not available in PTQ, so we use the prediction of floating-point network yF P to approximate it. 6 The derivation of it is in Appendix. 10 Z. Yuan et al. Algorithm 1: Searches for the optimal scaling factors of each layer. 1 for l in 1 to L do 2 forward-propagation O l ← A lB l ; 3 end 4 for l in L to 1 do 5 backward-propagation to get ∂L ∂Ol ; 6 end 7 for l in 1 to L do 8 initialize ∆∗ Bl ← Blmax 2k−1 ; 9 generate search spaces of ∆Al and ∆Bl ; 10 for r = 1 to #Round do 11 search for ∆∗ Al using Eq. (7); 12 search for ∆∗ Bl using Eq. (7); 13 end 14 end propagation. 2) The second phase is to search for the optimal scaling factors layer by layer. Different scaling factors in the search space are used to quantize the activation values and weight values in the l-th layer. Then the output of the layer Oˆl is calculated. We search for the optimal scaling factor ∆∗ that minimizes Eq. (7). In the first phase, we need to store Ol and ∂L ∂Ol , which consumes a lot of GPU memory. Therefore, we transfer these data to the main memory when they are generated. In the second phase, we transfer Ol and ∂L ∂Ol back to GPU memory and destroy them when the quantization of l-th layer is finished. To make full use of the GPU parallelism, we calculate Oˆl and the influence on loss for different scaling factors in batches. 4 Experiments In this section, we first introduce the experimental settings. Then we will evaluate the proposed methods on different vision transformer architectures. At last, we will take an ablation study on the proposed methods. 4.1 Experiment Settings For post-softmax quantization, the search space of ∆s R1 is [ 1 2 k , 1 2 k+1 , ..., 1 2 k+10 ]. The search spaces of scaling factors for weight and other activations are the same as that of base PTQ (Sec. 3.1). We set alpha = 0, beta = 1.2, and n = 100. The search round #Round is set to 3. We experiment on the ImageNet classification task [19]. We randomly select 32 images from the training dataset as calibration images. The ViT models are provided by timm [26]. We quantize all the weights and inputs for the fully-connect layers including the first projection layer and the last prediction layer. We also quantize the two PTQ4ViT 11 Table 1: Top-1 Accuracy of Quantized Vision Transformers. The result in the bracket is the accuracy drop from floating-point networks. W6A6 means weights are quantized to 6-bit and activations are quantized to 6-bit. The default patch size is 16x16. ViT-S/224/32 means the input resolution is 224x224 and the patch size is 32x32.

We use different quantization parameters for different self-attention heads. The scaling factors for WQ, W K, and WV are different. The same as [16], we don’t quantize softmax and normalization layers in vision transformers. 4.2 Results on ImageNet Classification Task We choose different vision transformer architectures, including ViT [7], DeiT [22], and Swin [15]. The results are demonstrated in Tab. 1. From this table, we observe that base PTQ results in more than 1% accuracy drop on some vision transformers even at the 8-bit quantization. PTQ4ViT achieves less than 0.5% accuracy drop with 8-bit quantization. For 6-bit quantization, base PTQ results in high accuracy drop (9.8% on average) while PTQ4ViT achieves a much smaller accuracy drop (2.1% on average). We observe that the accuracy drop on Swin is not as significant as ViT and DeiT. The prediction accuracy drops are less than 0.15% on the four Swin transformers at 8-bit quantization. The reason may be that Swin computes the self-attention locally within non-overlapping windows. It uses a smaller number of patches to calculate the self-attention, reducing the unbalance after postsoftmax values. We also observe that larger vision transformers are less sensitive to quantization. For instance, the accuracy drops of ViT-S/224/32, ViT-S/224, ViT-B/224, and ViT-B/384 are 0.41, 0.38, 0.29, and 0.17 at 8-bit quantization and 4.08, 2.75, 2.89, and 2.65 at 6-bit quantization, respectively. The reason may be that the larger networks have more weights and generate more activations, making them more robust to the perturbation caused by quantization. 12 Z. Yuan et al.

EasyQuant [27] is a popular post-training method that alternatively searches for the optimal scaling factors of weight and activation. However, the accuracy drop is more than 3% at 8-bit quantization. Liu et al. [16] proposed using the Pearson correlation coefficient and ranking loss are used as the metrics to determine the scaling factors, which increases the Top-1 accuracy. Since the sensitivity of different layers to quantization is not the same, they also use the mixed-precision technique, achieving good results at 4-bit quantization. At 8-bit quantization and 6-bit quantization, PTQ4ViT outperforms other methods, achieving more than 1% improvement in prediction accuracy on average. At 4-bit quantization, the performance of PTQ4ViT is not good. Although bias correction [17] can improve the performance of PTQ4ViT, the result at 4-bit quantization is lower than the mixed-precision of Liu et al. This indicates that mixed-precision is important for quantization with lower bit-width. 4.3 Ablation Study Next, we take ablation study on the effect of the proposed twin uniform quantization and Hessian guided metric. The experimental results are shown in Tab. 3. As we can see, the proposed methods improve the top-1 accuracy of quantized vi- PTQ4ViT 13 Table 3: Ablation study of the effect of the proposed twin uniform quantization and Hessian guided metric.

Specifically, using the Hessian guided metric alone can slightly improve the accuracy at 8-bit quantization, and it significantly improves the accuracy at 6-bit quantization. For instance, on ViT-S/224, the accuracy improvement is 0.46% at 8-bit while it is 6.96% at 6-bit. And using them together can further improve the accuracy. Based on the Hessian guided metric, using the twin uniform quantization on post-softmax activation or post-GELU activation can improve the performance. We observe that using the twin uniform quantization without the Hessian guided metric significantly decreases the top-1 accuracy. For instance, the top-1 accuracy on ViT-S/224 achieves 81.00% with both Hessian guided metric and twin uniform quantization at 8-bit quantization, while it decreases to 79.25% without Hessian guided metric, which is even lower than basic PTQ with 80.47% top-1 accuracy. This is also evidence that the metric considering only the local information is inaccurate. 5 Conclusion In this paper, we analyzed the problems of post-training quantization for vision transformers. We observed both the post-softmax activations and the postGELU activations have special distributions. We also found that the common 14 Z. Yuan et al.

To solve these problems, we proposed the twin uniform quantization and a Hessianguided metric. They can decrease the quantization error and improve the prediction accuracy at a small cost. To enable the fast quantization of vision transformers, we developed an efficient framework, PTQ4ViT. The experiments demonstrated that we achieved near-lossless prediction accuracy on the ImageNet classification task, making PTQ acceptable for vision transformers.

We have proposed to pre-compute the output and gradient of each layer and compute the influence of scaling factor candidates in batches to reduce the quantization time. As demonstrated in Tab. 4, PTQ4ViT can quantize most vision transformers in several minutes using 32 calibration images. Using #ims = 128 significantly increases the quantization time. We observe the Top-1 accuracy varies slightly, demonstrating PTQ4ViT is not very sensitive to #ims. PTQ4ViT 15 6.2 Base PTQ Base PTQ is a simple quantization strategy and serves as a benchmark for our experiments. Like PTQ4ViT, we quantize all weights and inputs for fully-connect layers (including the first projection layer and the last prediction layer), as well as all input matrices of matrix multiplication operations. For fully-connected layers, we use layerwise scaling factors ∆W for weight quantization and ∆X for input quantization; while for matrix multiplication operations, we use ∆A and ∆B for A’s quantization and B’s quantization respectively. To get the best scaling factors, we apply a linear grid search on the search space. The same as EasyQuant [27] and Liu et al. [16], we take hyper-parameters α = 0.5, β = 1.2, search round #Round = 1 and use cosine distance as the metric. Note that in PTQ4ViT, we change the hyper-parameters to α = 0, β = 1.2 and search round #Round = 3, which slightly improves the performance. It should be noticed that Base PTQ adopts a parallel quantization paradigm, which makes it essentially different from sequential quantization paradigms such as EasyQuant [27]. In sequential quantization, the input data of the current quantizing layer is generated with all previous layers quantizing weights and activations. While in parallel quantization, the input data of the current quantizing layer is simply the raw output of the previous layer. In practice, we found sequential quantization on vision transformers suffers from significant accuracy degradation on small calibration datasets. While parallel quantization shows robustness on small calibration datasets. Therefore, we choose parallel quantization for both Base PTQ and PTQ4ViT. 6.3 Derivation of Hessian guided metric Our goal is to introduce as small an increment on task loss L = CE(ˆy, y) as possible, in which ˆy is the prediction of the quantized model and y is the ground truth. In PTQ, we don’t have labels of input data y, so we make a fair assumption that the prediction of floating-point network yF P is close to the ground truth y. Therefore, we use the CE(ˆy, yF P ) as a substitution of the task loss L, which, for convenience, is still denoted as L in the following. We adopt a layer-wise parallel quantization paradigm. We calibrate the scaling factors of a single layer or a single matrix multiplication at a time. In the following, we derive the Hessian guided metric for the weight, and similar derivations can be applied to activation. When we treat the weights of a layer as variables, the expectation of task loss is a function of weight E[L(W)]. Since quantization on weight introduces a small perturbation ϵ on weight W˜ = W +ϵ, we could use Taylor series expansion to analyze the influence of quantization on loss. mathbb {E}[L(hat {W})]-mathbb {E}[L(W)]approx epsilon ^T bar {g}^{(W)}+frac {1}{2}epsilon ^T bar {H}^{(W)}epsilon , label {eq:Taylor Expansion of Loss} (8) where ¯g (W) is the gradients and H¯ (W) is the Hessian matrix. Since the pretrained model has converged to a local optimum, the gradients ¯g (W) is close to zero, thus the first-order term could be ignored and we only consider the second-order term. 16 Z. Yuan et al. The Hessian matrix could be computed by begin {aligned} & dfrac {partial ^2 L}{partial w_i partial w_j} = dfrac {partial }{partial w_j} (sum _{k=1}^{m} dfrac {partial L}{partial O_k} dfrac {partial O_k}{partial w_i}) &= sum _{k=1}^{m} dfrac {partial L}{partial O_k} dfrac {partial ^2 O_k}{partial w_i partial w_j} + sum _{k,l=1}^{m} dfrac {partial O_k}{partial w_i} dfrac {partial ^2 L}{partial O_k partial O_l} dfrac {partial O_l}{partial w_j}, label {eq:Hessian of Weight} end {aligned} (9) where O = WT X ∈ Rm is the output of the layer. Note that ∂ 2Ok ∂wi∂wj = 0, the first term of Eq. (9) is zero. We denote JO(W) as the Jacobian matrix of O w.r.t. weight W. Then we have bar {H}^{(W)} = J_{O}^T(W) bar {H}^{(O)} J_{O}(W). (10) Since weight’s perturbation ϵ is relatively small, we have a first-order Taylor expansion that (Oˆ − O) ≈ JO(W)ϵ, where Oˆ = (W + ϵ) T X. The second-order term in Eq. (8) could be written as begin {aligned} epsilon ^T bar {H}^{(W)}epsilon & = (J_{O}(W) epsilon )^T bar {H}^{(O)} J_{O}(W) epsilon & approx (hat {O}-O)^Tbar {H}^{(O)} (hat {O}-O) end {aligned} (11) Next, we introduce how to compute the Hessian matrix of the layer’s output O. Following Liu et al.[14], we use the Fisher Information Matrix I of O to substitute H¯ (O) . For our probabilistic model p(Y ; θ) where θ is the model’s parameters and Y is the random variable of predicted probability, we have: begin {aligned} bar {I}(theta ) &= mathbb {E}[nabla _theta log p(Y;theta ) nabla _theta log p(Y;theta )^T] &= -mathbb {E}[nabla _theta ^2log p(Y;theta )] end {aligned} (12) Notice that I would equal to the expected Hessian H¯ (O) if the model’s distribution matches the true data distribution, i.e. y = yF P . We have assumed y ≈ yF P in the above derivation, and therefore it is reasonable to replace H¯ (O) with I. Using the original Fisher Information Matrix, however, still requires an unrealistic amount of computation. So we only consider elements on the diagonal, which is diag(( ∂L ∂O1 ) 2 , · · · ,( ∂L ∂Om ) 2 ). This only requires the first-order gradient on output O, which introduces a relatively small computation overhead. Therefore, the Hessian guided metric is: mathbb {E}[ (hat {O}-O)^T text {diag}((dfrac {partial L}{partial O_1})^2, cdots , (dfrac {partial L}{partial O_m})^2) (hat {O}-O)]. (13) Using this metric, we can search for the optimal scaling factor for weight. The optimization is formulated as: mathop {min}_{Delta _W} mathbb {E}[ (hat {O}-O)^T text {diag}((dfrac {partial L}{partial O_1})^2, cdots , (dfrac {partial L}{partial O_m})^2) (hat {O}-O)]. label {W_optimization} (14) PTQ4ViT 17 In PTQ4ViT, we make a search space for scaling factors. Then we compute the influence on the output of the layer Oˆ − O for each scaling factor. The optimal scaling factor can be selected according to Eq. (14). We assume that ∂L ∂O doesn’t change when the weight is quantized. This assumption enables the pre-computation of ∂L ∂O , significantly improving the quantization efficiency. 6.4 More Ablation Study We supply more ablation studies for the hyper-parameters. It is enough to set the number of quantization intervals ≥ 20 (accuracy change < 0.3%). It is enough to set the upper bound of m ≥ 15 (no accuracy change). The best settings of alpha and beta vary from different layers. It is appropriate to set α = 0 and β = 1/2 k−1 , which has little impact on search efficiency. We observe that #Round has little impact on the prediction accuracy (accuracy change < 0.05% when #Round > 1). We randomly take 32 calibration images to quantize different models 20 times and we observe the fluctuation is not significant. The mean/std of accuracies are: ViT-S/32 75.55%/0.055% , ViT-S 80.96%/0.046%, ViT-B 84.12%/0.068%, DeiT-S 79.45%/0.094% , and Swin-S 83.11%/0.035%. References 1.

As of my last update in 2023, here are some general insights into CPA salaries: 1. Entry-level CPAs typically start at a lower range, which might be anywhere between 50,000 to 65,000 per year in the United States. This can depend on the cost of living in the area and the type of firm. 2. Mid-career CPAs with several years of experience and perhaps specialization in a particular area of accounting can earn salaries that range from 65,000 to over 100,000 per year. 3. Senior CPAs, especially those with management responsibilities or those who work for large accounting firms in high-cost living areas or industries like finance and tech, can earn well over 100,000. It's not uncommon for experienced CPAs in these roles to make 120,000 to 150,000 or more annually. 4. CPAs with additional credentials (such as those who are also Certified Information System Auditors or who have an MBA) or those in executive positions (like CFOs or Partners at accounting firms) could have salaries that exceed 200,000 per year. 5. CPAs working independently as consultants or owning their practices might have incomes that vary greatly based on client base, specialization, and success in business. It is important to note that the salary figures in the field of accounting are dynamic and change according to economic conditions, supply and demand for accounting professionals, and inflation. For the most up-to-date figures, it would be prudent to refer to salary surveys or databases, as well as job listings for CPAs in your targeted geographic area."},{"instruction":"I’m a cpa, and those numbers are conservative but fairly accurate. I’m upset, however because this is not good money in 2023. Pre-Covid this was a stable career but post Covid you can’t afford anything on those salaries.","output":"It's understandable to feel frustrated if your salary isn't keeping pace with the cost of living or if it doesn't reflect the value you contribute, particularly given the extensive education, experience, and stringent licensing requirements needed to become a CPA. Several factors have brought significant changes to the job market and economic landscape since the onset of Covid-19, including: 1. **Inflation:** Many regions have seen inflation rates that outpace wage growth. This erodes purchasing power and can make salaries that were once considered good no longer sufficient to maintain the same standard of living. 2. **Remote Work:** The transition to more widespread remote work has changed the job market, leading some to expect higher salaries as companies save on office costs and seek to attract the best talent in a more competitive, location-agnostic environment. 3. **Economic Uncertainty:** Economic fluctuations and uncertainties can lead to reduced hiring, promotion freezes, or more cautious compensation growth strategies among employers. 4. **Industry Changes:** The accounting industry is evolving with automation and artificial intelligence streamlining or replacing some of the routine work traditionally done by accountants. This might put pressure on wages, especially for tasks that are becoming more standardized and less reliant on specialist expertise. If you feel that your compensation isn't sufficient, there are some paths you might consider to address this: - **Negotiating a Raise:** Prepare a case for higher pay based on your contributions, experience, and market rates for someone with your qualifications. - **Specializing:** CPAs with niche expertise in areas like forensic accounting, information systems, taxation, or other high-demand fields often command higher salaries. - **Changing Jobs:** Look for opportunities at other firms or industries that might offer higher pay or better benefits. - **Geographic Relocation:** Sometimes moving to a region with a lower cost of living or higher demand for CPAs can improve financial well-being. - **Additional Credentials or Education:** Additional certifications or a master's degree in a related field might open doors to higher-paying positions. - **Consulting or Freelancing:** Running your own consulting practice can sometimes lead to higher earnings, though it also comes with the risks and responsibilities of business ownership. It's important to also consider non-salary compensation, such as bonuses, profit-sharing, retirement plans, health benefits, and work-life balance, when evaluating your overall compensation package and job satisfaction."},{"instruction":"Which of the following groupings of muscle type and their characteristics is INCORRECT? a. two sentences are incorrect b.

In contrast, anaerobic respiration (also known as fermentation in the absence of oxygen) is much less efficient and typically yields only 2 molecules of ATP per molecule of glucose. Anaerobic respiration occurs in conditions where oxygen is scarce or absent, such as in muscle cells during intense exercise when oxygen supply is not sufficient to meet demand.

PTQ4ViT: Post-Training Quantization for Vision Transformers with Twin Uniform Quantization Zhihang Yuan 1 , 3 ⋆ , Chenhao Xue 1 ⋆ , Yiqi Chen 1 , Qiang Wu 3 , and Guangyu Sun 2 ⋆⋆ 1 School of Computer Science, Peking University {yuanzhihang, <PRESIDIO_ANONYMIZED_EMAIL_ADDRESS> 2 School of Integrated Circuits, Peking University <PRESIDIO_ANONYMIZED_EMAIL_ADDRESS> 3 Houmo AI Abstract. Quantization is one of the most effective methods to compress neural networks, which has achieved great success on convolutional neural networks (CNNs). Recently, vision transformers have demonstrated great potential in computer vision. However, previous post-training quantization methods performed not well on vision transformer, resulting in more than 1% accuracy drop even in 8-bit quantization. Therefore, we analyze the problems of quantization on vision transformers. We observe the distributions of activation values after softmax and GELU functions are quite different from the Gaussian distribution. We also observe that common quantization metrics, such as MSE and cosine distance, are inaccurate to determine the optimal scaling factor. In this paper, we propose the twin uniform quantization method to reduce the quantization error on these activation values. And we propose to use a Hessian guided metric to evaluate different scaling factors, which improves the accuracy of calibration at a small cost. To enable the fast quantization of vision transformers, we develop an efficient framework, PTQ4ViT. Experiments show the quantized vision transformers achieve near-lossless prediction accuracy (less than 0.5% drop at 8-bit quantization) on the ImageNet classification task. 1 Introduction The self-attention module is the basic building block of the transformer to capture global information [23]. Inspired by the success of transformers [6,2] on natural language processing (NLP) tasks, researchers have brought the self-attention module into computer vision [ 7 ,15]. They replaced the convolution layers in convolutional neural networks (CNNs) with self-attention modules and they called these networks vision transformers. Vision transformers are comparable to CNNs on many computer vision tasks and have great potential to be deployed on various applications [11]. ⋆ First author and Second Author contribute equally to this paper. ⋆⋆ Corresponding author arXiv:2111.12293v2 [cs.CV] 27 Jul 2022 2 Z.

However, both the CNN and the vision transformer are computationally intensive and consume much energy. The larger and larger scales of neural networks block their deployment on various hardware devices, such as mobile phones and IoT devices, and increase carbon emissions. It is required to compress these neural networks. Quantization is one of the most effective ways to compress neural networks [9]. The floating-point values are quantized to integers with a low bitwidth, reducing the memory consumption and the computation cost. There are two types of quantization methods, quantization-aware training (QAT) [4,28] and post-training quantization (PTQ) [1,5]. Although QAT can generate the quantized network with a lower accuracy drop, the training of the network requires a training dataset, a long optimization time, and the tuning of hyper-parameters. Therefore, QAT is impractical when the training dataset is not available or rapid deployment is required. While PTQ quantizes the network with unlabeled calibration images after training, which enables fast quantization and deployment. Although PTQ has achieved great success on CNNs, directly bringing it to vision transformer results in more than 1% accuracy drop even with 8-bit quantization [16]. Therefore, we analyze the problems of quantization on vision transformers. We collect the distribution of activation values in the vision transformer and observe there are some special distributions. 1) The values after softmax have a very unbalanced distribution in [0, 1], where most of them are very close to zero. Although the number of large values is very small, they mean high attention between two patches, which is of vital importance in the attention mechanism. This requires a large scaling factor to make the quantization range cover the large value. However, a big scaling factor quantizes the small values to zero, resulting in a large quantization error. 2) The values after the GELU PTQ4ViT 3 function have an asymmetrical distribution, where the positive values have a large distribution range while the negative values have a very small distribution range. It’s difficult to well quantify both the positive values and negative values with uniform quantization. Therefore, we propose the twin uniform quantization, which separately quantifies the values in two ranges. To enable its efficient processing on hardware devices, we design a data format and constrain the scaling factors of the two ranges. The second problem is that the metric to determine the optimal scaling factor is not accurate on vision transformers. There are various metrics in previous PTQ methods, including MSE, cosine distance, and Pearson correlation coefficient between the layer outputs before and after quantization. However, we observe they are inaccurate to evaluate different scaling factor candidates because only the local information is used. Therefore, we propose to use the Hessian guided metric to determine the quantization parameters, which is more accurate. The proposed methods are demonstrated in Fig. 1. We develop a post-training quantization framework for vision transformers using twin uniform quantization, PTQ4ViT. 4 Experiments show the quantized vision transformers (ViT, DeiT, and Swin) achieve near-lossless prediction accuracy (less than 0.5% drop at 8-bit quantization) on the ImageNet classification task. Our contributions are listed as follows: – We find the problems in PTQ on vision transformers are special distributions of post-softmax and post-GELU activations and the inaccurate metric. – We propose the twin uniform quantization to handle the special distributions, which can be efficiently processed on existing hardware devices including CPU and GPU. – We propose to use the Hessian guided metric to determine the optimal scaling factors, which replaces the inaccurate metrics. – The quantized networks achieve near-lossless prediction accuracy, making PTQ acceptable on vision transformers. 2 Background and Related Work 2.1 Vision Transformer In the last few years, convolution neural networks (CNNs) have achieved great success in computer vision. The convolution layer is a fundamental component of CNNs to extract features using local information. Recently, the position of CNNs in computer vision is challenged by vision transformers, which take the self-attention modules [23] to make use of the global information. DETR [3] is the first work to replace the object detection head with a transformer, which directly regresses the bounding boxes and achieves comparable results with the CNN-based head. ViT [7] is the first architecture that replaces all convolution 4 Code is in https://github.com/hahnyuan/PTQ4ViT. 4 Z. Yuan et al. layers, which achieves better results on image classification tasks. Following ViT, various vision transformer architectures have been proposed to boost performance [25,15]. Vision transformers have been successfully applied to downstream tasks [15,24,12]. They have great potential for computer vision tasks [11]. The input of a transformer is a sequence of vectors. An image is divided into several patches and a linear projection layer is used to project each patch to a vector. These vectors form the input sequence of the vision transformer. We denote these vectors as X ∈ RN×D, where N is the number of patches and D is the hidden size, which is the size of the vector after linear projection. A vision transformer contains some blocks. As shown in Fig. 1, each block is composed of a multi-head self-attention module (MSA) and a multi-layer perceptron (MLP). MSA generates the attention between different patches to extract features with global information. Typical MLP contains two fully-connected layers (FC) and the GELU activation function is used after the first layer. The input sequence is first fed into each self-attention head of MSA. In each head, the sequence is linearly projected to three matrices, query Q = XWQ, key K = XW K, and value V = XWV . Then, matrix multiplication QKT calculates the attention scores between patches. The softmax function is used to normalize these scores to attention probability P. The output of the head is matrix multiplication P V . The process is formulated as Eq. (1): text {Attention}(Q,K,V)=text {softmax}(frac {QK^T}{sqrt {d}})V, label {self-attention} (1) where d is the hidden size of head. The outputs of multiple heads are concatenated together as the output of MSA. Vision transformers have a large amount of memory, computation, and energy consumption, which hinders their deployment in real-world applications. Researchers have proposed a lot of methods to compress vision transformers, such as patch pruning [21], knowledge distillation [13] ,and quantization [16]. 2.2 Quantization Network quantization is one of the most effective methods to compress neural networks. The weight values and activation values are transformed from floatingpoint to integer with lower bit-width, which significantly decreases the memory consumption, data movement, and energy consumption. The uniform symmetric quantization is the most widely used method, which projects a floating-point value x to a k-bit integer value xq with a scaling factor ∆: x_q=Psi _k(x,Delta )=text {clamp}(text {round}(frac {x}{Delta }),-2^{k-1},2^{k-1}-1), label {sym_quant} (2) where round projects a value to an integer and clamp constrains the output in the range that k-bit integer can represent. We propose the twin uniform quantization, which separately quantifies the values in two ranges. [8] also uses multiple quantization ranges. However, their method targets CNN and is not PTQ4ViT 5 suitable for ViT. They use an extra bit to represent which range is used, taking 12.5% more storage than our method. Moreover, they use FP32 computation to align the two ranges, which is not efficient. Our method uses the shift operation, avoiding the format transformation and extra FP32 multiplication and FP32 addition. There are two types of quantization methods, quantization-aware training (QAT) [4,28] and post-training quantization (PTQ) [1,5]. QAT methods combine quantization with network training. It optimizes the quantization parameters to minimize the task loss on a labeled training dataset. QAT can be used to quantize transformers [18]. Q-BERT [20] uses the Hessian spectrum to evaluate the sensitivity of the different tensors for mixed-precision, achieving 3-bit weight and 8-bit activation quantization. Although QAT achieves lower bit-width, it requires a training dataset, a long quantization time, and hyper-parameter tuning. PTQ methods quantize networks with a small number of unlabeled images, which is significantly faster than QAT and doesn’t require any labeled dataset. PTQ methods should determine the scaling factors ∆ of activations and weights for each layer. Choukroun et al. [5] proposed to minimize the mean square error (MSE) between the tensors before and after quantization. EasyQuant [27] uses the cosine distance to improve the quantization performance on CNN. Recently, Liu et al. [16] first proposed a PTQ method to quantize the vision transformer. Pearson correlation coefficient and ranking loss are used as the metrics to determine the scaling factors. However, these metrics are inaccurate to evaluate different scaling factor candidates because only the local information is used. 3 Method In this section, we will first introduce a base PTQ method for vision transformers. Then, we will analyze the problems of quantization using the base PTQ and propose methods to address the problems. Finally, we will introduce our posttraining quantization framework, PTQ4ViT. 3.1 Base PTQ for Vision Transformer Matrix multiplication is used in the fully-connected layer and the computation of QKT and P V , which is the main operation in vision transformers. In this paper, we formulate it as O = AB and we will focus on its quantization. A and B are quantized to k-bit using the symmetric uniform quantization with scaling factors ∆A and ∆B. According to Eq. (2), we have Aq = Ψk(A, ∆A) and Bq = Ψk(B, ∆B). In base PTQ, the distance of the output before and after quantization is used as metric to determine the scaling factors, which is formulated as: min _{Delta _A,Delta _B}text {distance}(O,hat {O}), label {optimization} (3) where Oˆ is the output of the matrix multiplication after quantization Oˆ = ∆A∆BAqBq. 6 Z.

The same as [27], we use cosine distance as the metric to calculate the distance. We make the search spaces of ∆A and ∆B by linearly dividing [α Amax 2 k−1 , β Amax 2 k−1 ] and [α Bmax 2 k−1 , β Bmax 2 k−1 ] to n candidates, respectively. Amax and Bmax are the maximum absolute value of A and B. α and β are two parameters to control the search range. We alternatively search for the optimal scaling factors ∆∗ A and ∆∗ B in the search space. Firstly, ∆B is fixed, and we search for the optimal ∆A to minimize distance(O, Oˆ). Secondly, ∆A is fixed, and we search for the optimal ∆B to minimize distance(O, Oˆ). ∆A and ∆B are alternately optimized for several rounds. The values of A and B are collected using unlabeled calibration images. We search for the optimal scaling factors of activation or weight layer-by-layer. However, the base PTQ results in more than 1% accuracy drop on quantized vision transformer in our experiments. 3.2 Twin Uniform Quantization The activation values in CNNs are usually considered Gaussian distributed. Therefore, most PTQ quantization methods are based on this assumption to determine the scaling factor. However, we observe the distributions of post-softmax values and post-GELU values are quite special as shown in Fig. 2. Specifically, (1) The distribution of activations after softmax is very unbalanced, in which most values are very close to zero and only a few values are close to one. (2) The values after the GELU function have a highly asymmetric distribution, in which the unbounded positive values are large while the negative values have a very small distribution range. As shown in Fig. 3, we demonstrate the quantization points of the uniform quantization using different scaling factors. For the values after softmax, a large value means that there is a high correlation between the two patches, which is important in the self-attention mechanism. A larger scaling factor can reduce the quantization error of these large PTQ4ViT 7 0.00 0.25 0.50 0.75 1.00 000 001 010 011 100 101 110 111 quantization point in R1 quantization point in R2 0.0 0.5 1.0 1.5 011 010 001 000 100 101 110 111 quantization point in R1 quantization point in R2 positive values negative values Fig. 4: Demonstration of the 3-bit twin uniform quantization on post-softmax values (left) and post-GELU values (right). We annotate the binary values for different quantization points. values, which causes smaller values to be quantized to zero. While a small scaling factor makes the large values quantized to small values, which significantly decreases the intensity of attention between two patches. For the values after GELU, it is difficult to quantify both positive and negative values well with symmetric uniform quantization. Non-uniform quantization [10] can be used to solve the problem. It can set the quantization points according to the distribution, ensuring the overall quantization error is small. However, most hardware devices cannot efficiently process the non-uniform quantized values. Acceleration can be achieved only on specially designed hardware. We propose the twin uniform quantization, which can be efficiently processed on existing hardware devices including CPUs and GPUs. As shown in Fig. 4, twin uniform quantization has two quantization ranges, R1 and R2, which are controlled by two scaling factors ∆R1 and ∆R2, respectively. The k-bit twin uniform quantization is be formulated as: text {T}_k(x,Delta _{text {R1}},Delta _{text {R2}})=begin {cases}Psi _{k-1}(x,Delta _{text {R1}}), xin text {R1} Psi _{k-1}(x,Delta _{text {R2}}), otherwiseend {cases}. label {twin_quant_func} (4) For values after softmax, the values in R1 = [0, 2 k−1∆s R1) can be well quantified by using a small ∆s R1. To avoid the effect of calibration dataset, we keeps ∆s R2 fixed to 1/2 k−1 . Therefore, R2 = [0, 1] can cover the whole range, and large values can be well quantified in R2. For activation values after GELU, negative values are located in R1 = [−2 k−1∆ g R1, 0] and positive values are located in R2=[0, 2 k−1∆ g R2]. We also keep ∆ g R1 fixed to make R1 just cover the entire range of negative numbers. Since different quantization parameters are used for positive and negative values respectively, the quantization error can be effectively reduced. When calibrating the network, we search for the optimal ∆s R1 and ∆ g R2. The uniform symmetric quantization uses the k bit signed integer data format. It consists of one sign bit and k − 1 bits representing the quantity. In order to efficiently store the twin-uniform-quantized values, we design a new data format. The most significant bit is the range flag to represent which range is used (0 for R1, 1 for R2). The other k−1 bits compose an unsigned number to represent 8 Z.

The x-axis is the normalized scaling factor by dividing Amax 2 k−1 or Bmax 2 k−1 . the quantity. Because the sign of values in the same range is the same, the sign bit is removed. Data in different ranges need to be multiplied and accumulated in matrix multiplication. In order to efficiently process with the twin-uniform-quantized values on CPUs or GPUs, we constrain the two ranges with ∆R2 = 2m∆R1, where m is an unsigned integer. Assuming aq is quantized in R1 and bq is quantized in R2, the two values can be aligned: a_qtimes Delta _{text {R1}}+b_qtimes Delta _{text {R2}}=(a_q+b_qtimes 2^{m})Delta _{text {R1}}. (5) We left shift bq by m bits, which is the same as multiplying the value by 2m. The shift operation is very efficient on CPUs or GPUs. Without this constraint, multiplication is required to align the scaling factor, which is much more expensive than shift operations. 3.3 Hessian Guided Metric Next, we will analyze the metrics to determine the scaling factors of each layer. Previous works [5,27,16] greedily determine the scaling factors of inputs and weights layer by layer. They use various kinds of metrics, such as MSE and cosine distance, to measure the distance between the original and the quantized outputs. The change in the internal output is considered positively correlated with the task loss, so it is used to calculate the distance. We plot the performance of different metrics in Fig. 5. We observe that MSE, cosine distance, and Pearson correlation coefficient are inaccurate compared with task loss (cross-entropy) on vision transformers. The optimal scaling factors based on them are not consistent with that based on task loss. For instance, on blocks.6.mlp.fc1:activation, they indicate that a scaling factor around PTQ4ViT 9 0.4 Amax 2 k−1 is the optimal one, while the scaling factor around 0.75 Amax 2 k−1 is the optimal according to the task loss. Using these metrics, we get sub-optimal scaling factors, causing the accuracy degradation. The distance between the last layer’s output before and after quantization can be more accurate in PTQ. However, using it to determine the scaling factors of internal layers is impractical because it requires executing the network many times to calculate the last layer’s output, which consumes too much time. To achieve high accuracy and quick quantization at the same time, we propose to use the Hessian guided metric to determine the scaling factors. In the classification task, the task loss is L = CE(ˆy, y), where CE is cross-entropy, ˆy is the output of the network, and y is the ground truth5 . When we treat the weights as variables, the expectation of loss is a function of weight E[L(W)]. The quantization brings a small perturbation ϵ on weight Wˆ = W + ϵ. We can analyze the influence of quantization on task loss by Taylor series expansion. mathbb {E}[L(hat {W})]-mathbb {E}[L(W)]approx epsilon ^T bar {g}^{(W)}+frac {1}{2}epsilon ^T bar {H}^{(W)}epsilon , (6) where ¯g (W) is the gradients and H¯ (W) is the Hessian matrix. The target is to find the scaling factors to minimize the influence: min∆(E[L(Wˆ )] − E[L(W)]). Based on the layer-wise reconstruction method in [14], the optimization can be approximated6 by: begin {aligned} min _{Delta }mathbb {E}[(hat {O^l}-O^l)^Tdiagbig ((frac {partial L}{partial O^l_1})^2 ,dots , (frac {partial L}{partial O^l_{|O^l|}})^2big ) (hat {O^l}-O^l)], end {aligned} label {hessian_optimization} (7) where Ol and Oˆl are the outputs of the l-th layer before and after quantization, respectively. As shown in Fig. 5, the optimal scaling factor indicated by Hessian guided metric is closer to that indicated by task loss (CE). Although it still has a gap with the task loss, Hessian guided metric significantly improves the performance. For instance, on blocks.6.mlp.fc1:activation, the optimal scaling factor indicated by Hessian guided metric has less influence on task loss than other metrics. 3.4 PTQ4ViT Framework To achieve fast quantization and deployment, we develop an efficient post-training quantization framework for vision transformers, PTQ4ViT. Its flow is described in Algorithm 1. It supports the twin uniform quantization and Hessian guided metric. There are two quantization phases. 1) The first phase is to collect the output and the gradient of the output in each layer before quantization. The outputs of the l-th layer Ol are calculated through forward propagation on the calibration dataset. The gradients ∂L ∂Ol 1 , . . . , ∂L ∂Ol a are calculated through backward 5 The ground truth y is not available in PTQ, so we use the prediction of floating-point network yF P to approximate it. 6 The derivation of it is in Appendix. 10 Z. Yuan et al. Algorithm 1: Searches for the optimal scaling factors of each layer. 1 for l in 1 to L do 2 forward-propagation O l ← A lB l ; 3 end 4 for l in L to 1 do 5 backward-propagation to get ∂L ∂Ol ; 6 end 7 for l in 1 to L do 8 initialize ∆∗ Bl ← Blmax 2k−1 ; 9 generate search spaces of ∆Al and ∆Bl ; 10 for r = 1 to #Round do 11 search for ∆∗ Al using Eq. (7); 12 search for ∆∗ Bl using Eq. (7); 13 end 14 end propagation. 2) The second phase is to search for the optimal scaling factors layer by layer. Different scaling factors in the search space are used to quantize the activation values and weight values in the l-th layer. Then the output of the layer Oˆl is calculated. We search for the optimal scaling factor ∆∗ that minimizes Eq. (7). In the first phase, we need to store Ol and ∂L ∂Ol , which consumes a lot of GPU memory. Therefore, we transfer these data to the main memory when they are generated. In the second phase, we transfer Ol and ∂L ∂Ol back to GPU memory and destroy them when the quantization of l-th layer is finished. To make full use of the GPU parallelism, we calculate Oˆl and the influence on loss for different scaling factors in batches. 4 Experiments In this section, we first introduce the experimental settings. Then we will evaluate the proposed methods on different vision transformer architectures. At last, we will take an ablation study on the proposed methods. 4.1 Experiment Settings For post-softmax quantization, the search space of ∆s R1 is [ 1 2 k , 1 2 k+1 , ..., 1 2 k+10 ]. The search spaces of scaling factors for weight and other activations are the same as that of base PTQ (Sec. 3.1). We set alpha = 0, beta = 1.2, and n = 100. The search round #Round is set to 3. We experiment on the ImageNet classification task [19]. We randomly select 32 images from the training dataset as calibration images. The ViT models are provided by timm [26]. We quantize all the weights and inputs for the fully-connect layers including the first projection layer and the last prediction layer. We also quantize the two PTQ4ViT 11 Table 1: Top-1 Accuracy of Quantized Vision Transformers. The result in the bracket is the accuracy drop from floating-point networks. W6A6 means weights are quantized to 6-bit and activations are quantized to 6-bit. The default patch size is 16x16. ViT-S/224/32 means the input resolution is 224x224 and the patch size is 32x32.

We use different quantization parameters for different self-attention heads. The scaling factors for WQ, W K, and WV are different. The same as [16], we don’t quantize softmax and normalization layers in vision transformers. 4.2 Results on ImageNet Classification Task We choose different vision transformer architectures, including ViT [7], DeiT [22], and Swin [15]. The results are demonstrated in Tab. 1. From this table, we observe that base PTQ results in more than 1% accuracy drop on some vision transformers even at the 8-bit quantization. PTQ4ViT achieves less than 0.5% accuracy drop with 8-bit quantization. For 6-bit quantization, base PTQ results in high accuracy drop (9.8% on average) while PTQ4ViT achieves a much smaller accuracy drop (2.1% on average). We observe that the accuracy drop on Swin is not as significant as ViT and DeiT. The prediction accuracy drops are less than 0.15% on the four Swin transformers at 8-bit quantization. The reason may be that Swin computes the self-attention locally within non-overlapping windows. It uses a smaller number of patches to calculate the self-attention, reducing the unbalance after postsoftmax values. We also observe that larger vision transformers are less sensitive to quantization. For instance, the accuracy drops of ViT-S/224/32, ViT-S/224, ViT-B/224, and ViT-B/384 are 0.41, 0.38, 0.29, and 0.17 at 8-bit quantization and 4.08, 2.75, 2.89, and 2.65 at 6-bit quantization, respectively. The reason may be that the larger networks have more weights and generate more activations, making them more robust to the perturbation caused by quantization. 12 Z. Yuan et al.

EasyQuant [27] is a popular post-training method that alternatively searches for the optimal scaling factors of weight and activation. However, the accuracy drop is more than 3% at 8-bit quantization. Liu et al. [16] proposed using the Pearson correlation coefficient and ranking loss are used as the metrics to determine the scaling factors, which increases the Top-1 accuracy. Since the sensitivity of different layers to quantization is not the same, they also use the mixed-precision technique, achieving good results at 4-bit quantization. At 8-bit quantization and 6-bit quantization, PTQ4ViT outperforms other methods, achieving more than 1% improvement in prediction accuracy on average. At 4-bit quantization, the performance of PTQ4ViT is not good. Although bias correction [17] can improve the performance of PTQ4ViT, the result at 4-bit quantization is lower than the mixed-precision of Liu et al. This indicates that mixed-precision is important for quantization with lower bit-width. 4.3 Ablation Study Next, we take ablation study on the effect of the proposed twin uniform quantization and Hessian guided metric. The experimental results are shown in Tab. 3. As we can see, the proposed methods improve the top-1 accuracy of quantized vi- PTQ4ViT 13 Table 3: Ablation study of the effect of the proposed twin uniform quantization and Hessian guided metric.

Specifically, using the Hessian guided metric alone can slightly improve the accuracy at 8-bit quantization, and it significantly improves the accuracy at 6-bit quantization. For instance, on ViT-S/224, the accuracy improvement is 0.46% at 8-bit while it is 6.96% at 6-bit. And using them together can further improve the accuracy. Based on the Hessian guided metric, using the twin uniform quantization on post-softmax activation or post-GELU activation can improve the performance. We observe that using the twin uniform quantization without the Hessian guided metric significantly decreases the top-1 accuracy. For instance, the top-1 accuracy on ViT-S/224 achieves 81.00% with both Hessian guided metric and twin uniform quantization at 8-bit quantization, while it decreases to 79.25% without Hessian guided metric, which is even lower than basic PTQ with 80.47% top-1 accuracy. This is also evidence that the metric considering only the local information is inaccurate. 5 Conclusion In this paper, we analyzed the problems of post-training quantization for vision transformers. We observed both the post-softmax activations and the postGELU activations have special distributions. We also found that the common 14 Z. Yuan et al.

To solve these problems, we proposed the twin uniform quantization and a Hessianguided metric. They can decrease the quantization error and improve the prediction accuracy at a small cost. To enable the fast quantization of vision transformers, we developed an efficient framework, PTQ4ViT. The experiments demonstrated that we achieved near-lossless prediction accuracy on the ImageNet classification task, making PTQ acceptable for vision transformers.

We have proposed to pre-compute the output and gradient of each layer and compute the influence of scaling factor candidates in batches to reduce the quantization time. As demonstrated in Tab. 4, PTQ4ViT can quantize most vision transformers in several minutes using 32 calibration images. Using #ims = 128 significantly increases the quantization time. We observe the Top-1 accuracy varies slightly, demonstrating PTQ4ViT is not very sensitive to #ims. PTQ4ViT 15 6.2 Base PTQ Base PTQ is a simple quantization strategy and serves as a benchmark for our experiments. Like PTQ4ViT, we quantize all weights and inputs for fully-connect layers (including the first projection layer and the last prediction layer), as well as all input matrices of matrix multiplication operations. For fully-connected layers, we use layerwise scaling factors ∆W for weight quantization and ∆X for input quantization; while for matrix multiplication operations, we use ∆A and ∆B for A’s quantization and B’s quantization respectively. To get the best scaling factors, we apply a linear grid search on the search space. The same as EasyQuant [27] and Liu et al. [16], we take hyper-parameters α = 0.5, β = 1.2, search round #Round = 1 and use cosine distance as the metric. Note that in PTQ4ViT, we change the hyper-parameters to α = 0, β = 1.2 and search round #Round = 3, which slightly improves the performance. It should be noticed that Base PTQ adopts a parallel quantization paradigm, which makes it essentially different from sequential quantization paradigms such as EasyQuant [27]. In sequential quantization, the input data of the current quantizing layer is generated with all previous layers quantizing weights and activations. While in parallel quantization, the input data of the current quantizing layer is simply the raw output of the previous layer. In practice, we found sequential quantization on vision transformers suffers from significant accuracy degradation on small calibration datasets. While parallel quantization shows robustness on small calibration datasets. Therefore, we choose parallel quantization for both Base PTQ and PTQ4ViT. 6.3 Derivation of Hessian guided metric Our goal is to introduce as small an increment on task loss L = CE(ˆy, y) as possible, in which ˆy is the prediction of the quantized model and y is the ground truth. In PTQ, we don’t have labels of input data y, so we make a fair assumption that the prediction of floating-point network yF P is close to the ground truth y. Therefore, we use the CE(ˆy, yF P ) as a substitution of the task loss L, which, for convenience, is still denoted as L in the following. We adopt a layer-wise parallel quantization paradigm. We calibrate the scaling factors of a single layer or a single matrix multiplication at a time. In the following, we derive the Hessian guided metric for the weight, and similar derivations can be applied to activation. When we treat the weights of a layer as variables, the expectation of task loss is a function of weight E[L(W)]. Since quantization on weight introduces a small perturbation ϵ on weight W˜ = W +ϵ, we could use Taylor series expansion to analyze the influence of quantization on loss. mathbb {E}[L(hat {W})]-mathbb {E}[L(W)]approx epsilon ^T bar {g}^{(W)}+frac {1}{2}epsilon ^T bar {H}^{(W)}epsilon , label {eq:Taylor Expansion of Loss} (8) where ¯g (W) is the gradients and H¯ (W) is the Hessian matrix. Since the pretrained model has converged to a local optimum, the gradients ¯g (W) is close to zero, thus the first-order term could be ignored and we only consider the second-order term. 16 Z. Yuan et al. The Hessian matrix could be computed by begin {aligned} & dfrac {partial ^2 L}{partial w_i partial w_j} = dfrac {partial }{partial w_j} (sum _{k=1}^{m} dfrac {partial L}{partial O_k} dfrac {partial O_k}{partial w_i}) &= sum _{k=1}^{m} dfrac {partial L}{partial O_k} dfrac {partial ^2 O_k}{partial w_i partial w_j} + sum _{k,l=1}^{m} dfrac {partial O_k}{partial w_i} dfrac {partial ^2 L}{partial O_k partial O_l} dfrac {partial O_l}{partial w_j}, label {eq:Hessian of Weight} end {aligned} (9) where O = WT X ∈ Rm is the output of the layer. Note that ∂ 2Ok ∂wi∂wj = 0, the first term of Eq. (9) is zero. We denote JO(W) as the Jacobian matrix of O w.r.t. weight W. Then we have bar {H}^{(W)} = J_{O}^T(W) bar {H}^{(O)} J_{O}(W). (10) Since weight’s perturbation ϵ is relatively small, we have a first-order Taylor expansion that (Oˆ − O) ≈ JO(W)ϵ, where Oˆ = (W + ϵ) T X. The second-order term in Eq. (8) could be written as begin {aligned} epsilon ^T bar {H}^{(W)}epsilon & = (J_{O}(W) epsilon )^T bar {H}^{(O)} J_{O}(W) epsilon & approx (hat {O}-O)^Tbar {H}^{(O)} (hat {O}-O) end {aligned} (11) Next, we introduce how to compute the Hessian matrix of the layer’s output O. Following Liu et al.[14], we use the Fisher Information Matrix I of O to substitute H¯ (O) . For our probabilistic model p(Y ; θ) where θ is the model’s parameters and Y is the random variable of predicted probability, we have: begin {aligned} bar {I}(theta ) &= mathbb {E}[nabla _theta log p(Y;theta ) nabla _theta log p(Y;theta )^T] &= -mathbb {E}[nabla _theta ^2log p(Y;theta )] end {aligned} (12) Notice that I would equal to the expected Hessian H¯ (O) if the model’s distribution matches the true data distribution, i.e. y = yF P . We have assumed y ≈ yF P in the above derivation, and therefore it is reasonable to replace H¯ (O) with I. Using the original Fisher Information Matrix, however, still requires an unrealistic amount of computation. So we only consider elements on the diagonal, which is diag(( ∂L ∂O1 ) 2 , · · · ,( ∂L ∂Om ) 2 ). This only requires the first-order gradient on output O, which introduces a relatively small computation overhead. Therefore, the Hessian guided metric is: mathbb {E}[ (hat {O}-O)^T text {diag}((dfrac {partial L}{partial O_1})^2, cdots , (dfrac {partial L}{partial O_m})^2) (hat {O}-O)]. (13) Using this metric, we can search for the optimal scaling factor for weight. The optimization is formulated as: mathop {min}_{Delta _W} mathbb {E}[ (hat {O}-O)^T text {diag}((dfrac {partial L}{partial O_1})^2, cdots , (dfrac {partial L}{partial O_m})^2) (hat {O}-O)]. label {W_optimization} (14) PTQ4ViT 17 In PTQ4ViT, we make a search space for scaling factors. Then we compute the influence on the output of the layer Oˆ − O for each scaling factor. The optimal scaling factor can be selected according to Eq. (14). We assume that ∂L ∂O doesn’t change when the weight is quantized. This assumption enables the pre-computation of ∂L ∂O , significantly improving the quantization efficiency. 6.4 More Ablation Study We supply more ablation studies for the hyper-parameters. It is enough to set the number of quantization intervals ≥ 20 (accuracy change < 0.3%). It is enough to set the upper bound of m ≥ 15 (no accuracy change). The best settings of alpha and beta vary from different layers. It is appropriate to set α = 0 and β = 1/2 k−1 , which has little impact on search efficiency. We observe that #Round has little impact on the prediction accuracy (accuracy change < 0.05% when #Round > 1). We randomly take 32 calibration images to quantize different models 20 times and we observe the fluctuation is not significant. The mean/std of accuracies are: ViT-S/32 75.55%/0.055% , ViT-S 80.96%/0.046%, ViT-B 84.12%/0.068%, DeiT-S 79.45%/0.094% , and Swin-S 83.11%/0.035%. References 1.

This setting isn't available due to your organization's policy\\" typically refers to a scenario where a computer or device is managed by a workplace, school, or another type of organization that imposes certain policies to control software updates and other system configurations. In such cases, the organization's IT administrators set policies that can restrict when and how updates are installed on devices to ensure compatibility with business apps, maintain security standards, or control network bandwidth usage. If you're encountering this message and believe you should have access to update settings, or if you need to install updates for security or to access new features, you can try the following steps: 1. **Contact IT Support:** Reach out to your organization's IT support team or system administrator. They can provide you with the proper procedure for obtaining updates or possibly adjust the policy for your specific needs. 2. **Check for Updates Manually:** Depending on the policy settings, you might be able to check for updates manually, even if automatic updates have been disabled. This could involve navigating to the update settings within your system and clicking \\"Check for Updates\\" or a similar option. 3. **Review Policies:** If you have access to the device's policy management tools, you can review and understand which specific policies are affecting your ability to get updates. For Windows devices, this may involve using tools like the Group Policy Editor or the Registry Editor, but caution is advised as making changes can affect system behavior. 4. **Group Policy Refresh:** Sometimes, group policy settings might not be the latest due to various reasons such as network issues. You can manually refresh group policies by running the \`gpupdate\` command in the Command Prompt with administrative privileges. Keep in mind that attempting to bypass or change organizational policies without authorization can lead to security vulnerabilities and is typically against organizational rules and practices. Always work with your IT department for such matters."},{"instruction":"How do i fully reset windows update group policy","output":"To fully reset Windows Update Group Policy to its default settings, you can follow these steps: 1. **Open the Local Group Policy Editor:** - Press \`Windows Key + R\` to open the Run dialog. - Type \`gpedit.msc\` and press Enter or click OK. 2. **Navigate to Windows Update Policies:** - Inside the Local Group Policy Editor, navigate to \`Computer Configuration\` → \`Administrative Templates\` → \`Windows Components\` → \`Windows Update\`. 3. **Reset Individual Policy Settings:** - Go through each policy setting in the Windows Update folder. If any setting is configured, double-click on it to edit. - Change the setting to \\"Not Configured\\" and click OK. - This will reset each policy to its default state, where it does not enforce any specific behavior. 4. **Propagate the Changes (Optional):** - Changes in Group Policy do not always take effect immediately; to ensure changes are applied, open a Command Prompt as an administrator. - Type \`gpupdate /force\` and press Enter to manually force a Group Policy update. 5. **Alternative Method - Reset All Local Group Policies:** - If you want to reset not only the Windows Update policies but all Local Group Policies to default, open an elevated Command Prompt by right-clicking the Start menu, and selecting Windows PowerShell (Admin) or Command Prompt (Admin). - Enter the following commands: \`\`\`powershell RD /S /Q \\"%WinDir%System32GroupPolicyUsers\\" RD /S /Q \\"%WinDir%System32GroupPolicy\\" gpupdate /force \`\`\` - This will remove all Group Policy settings and revert them to their initial state, which is the same as not having any set policy. It's a more aggressive approach and will affect all policies, not just Windows Update. Keep in mind the Local Group Policy Editor is available only in some editions of Windows such as Windows Pro and Windows Enterprise. Also, if your computer is part of a domain and receives its Group Policy settings from a network, the above steps might only work until the domain Group Policy refreshes, as domain policies usually override local policies. If you are working in an enterprise environment or on a device managed by an organization, be sure to consult with your IT department before modifying Group Policy settings. Unauthorized changes to Group Policy can have unintended consequences for system stability and security."},{"instruction":"so all the group policys are not configured for windows update. I think it's a registry setting. How do i reset windows update through registry","output":"To reset Windows Update components via the registry, you must be extremely cautious, as incorrect changes to the Windows Registry can lead to system instability. It's recommended to back up the registry before making modifications. If you're confident that the issue with Windows Update lies with the registry and you're prepared to proceed, you can follow these steps: **Step 1: Open the Registry Editor** 1. Press \`Windows Key + R\` to open the Run dialog. 2. Type \`regedit\` and press Enter or click OK. 3. If prompted by User Account Control (UAC), click Yes to give administrative permissions. **Step 2: Backup the Registry (Highly Recommended)** 1. In the Registry Editor, click on \`File\` > \`Export...\`. 2. Choose a location to save the backup, enter a name for the backup file, and select \\"All\\" under Export range. 3. Click \`Save\`. **Step 3: Reset Windows Update Registry Keys** Navigate to each of the following keys and ensure they are set to their default values. If they're not, you can modify them as necessary: \`\`\`plaintext HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINESOFTWAREPoliciesMicrosoftWindowsWindowsUpdate \`\`\` This key contains settings for Windows Update. Resetting them involves removing any custom DWORD values or keys that have been created here related to Windows Update. Here's how to reset this key: 1. Expand \`HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\`, then \`SOFTWARE\`, then \`Policies\`, then \`Microsoft\`, and finally select \`WindowsUpdate\`. 2. If you find any custom settings in this key that you suspect are causing issues (anything other than default values), you can delete them. Right-click on them and select \\"Delete.\\" Be sure only to delete values and keys related to Windows Update. 3. Deleting the whole \`WindowsUpdate\` key is not generally recommended as it is a more aggressive approach and might cause other issues. **Step 4: Close the Registry Editor** Close the Registry Editor and restart your computer to make the changes take effect. **Step 5: Run the Windows Update Troubleshooter** After making changes to the registry: 1. Go to \`Settings\` > \`Update & Security\`. 2. Click on \`Troubleshoot\`. 3. Select \`Windows Update\` and then run the troubleshooter. **Note:** If you're not sure about the defaults or which keys/values to delete, it's better not to make any changes and seek professional assistance or contact your IT department if it's a work computer. For a less risky solution, consider using the official Windows Update Troubleshooter provided by Microsoft or resetting Windows Update components with the script provided by Microsoft Support, which doesn't involve manual registry editing."},{"instruction":"Write a short essay summarizing how gamergate, the 2016 election, the post-truth era and the COVID-19 pandemic led to the increased political division of today.","output":"The acceleration of political division in the 21st century can be traced through a series of impactful events that, when viewed collectively, highlight the synergy between digital culture, political polarization, and misinformation. Events such as Gamergate, the 2016 U.S. presidential election, the rise of the post-truth era, and the COVID-19 pandemic are all significant contributors to the chasm currently witnessed between different political ideologies and partisan identities. **Gamergate (2014):** Initially centered on issues of ethics in video game journalism, Gamergate quickly escalated into a broader cultural conflict about gender diversity, sexism in gaming culture, and the role of progressive social critique in the gaming industry. The controversy catalyzed online harassment campaigns and introduced aggressive online discourse tactics. It served as a microcosm for broader political battles online, showcasing how digital platforms could be used to organize, disseminate information, and wage culture wars. This highlighted the potential for online movements to seed real-world political division. **2016 U.S. Presidential Election:** This election was marked by an intense polarization of the American electorate, driven in part by the unprecedented use of social media by political campaigns. The utilization of social media algorithms, which feed users content that aligns with their pre-existing beliefs, further entrenched partisan viewpoints. The circulation of false information, or \\"fake news,\\" and the strategic weaponization of data analytics and social media advertising played leading roles. The result was an electoral landscape in which competing realities were established along partisan lines, damaging the notion of a collective, objective truth. **Post-Truth Era:** The concept of a \\"post-truth\\" era gained prominence in the aftermath of the 2016 election, referring to a political climate in which objective facts have less influence in shaping public opinion than appeals to emotion and personal belief. In this environment, confirmation bias and echo chambers on social media foster a division where political groups not only disagree on policies but also on the basic facts that inform those policy debates. **COVID-19 Pandemic (2020-present):** The pandemic introduced a global crisis that required a unified response, yet governments and populations were profoundly divided on how to tackle it. Misinformation regarding the virus, its origins, preventive measures, and vaccines spread rapidly through social media. Ideological divides were aggravated by disagreement on public health strategies, economic shutdowns, mask mandates, and vaccinations. This further strained societal trust and widened political divides, as individuals and groups were pitted against one another based on their perspectives and beliefs concerning the pandemic. Collectively, these events have contributed to an environment where political division is not just about differing opinions but distinct narratives about reality. The confluence of targeted online harassment, algorithmically-curated information silos, a declining trust in traditional sources of information, and the politicization of a global health emergency have all played roles in exacerbating social and political fragmentation.

Always back up your data before making any changes, and only proceed if you are comfortable with the risks involved. Here's a list of common ADB shell tweaks that can be applied to many Samsung phones to enhance performance, though availability and effectiveness may vary based on the specific model and software version: 1. Disable Bloatware: Samsung devices often come with pre-installed apps that you might not use (commonly referred to as bloatware). You can disable these apps without root by running the following command for each app package you want to disable: \`\`\`sh adb shell pm disable-user --user 0 <PACKAGE_NAME> \`\`\` To find the package name of the app you want to disable, you can use: \`\`\`sh adb shell pm list packages | grep '<APP_NAME>' \`\`\` 2. Reduce Window Animation Scale: You can speed up window transition animations to make your phone feel snappier. \`\`\`sh adb shell settings put global window_animation_scale 0.5 adb shell settings put global transition_animation_scale 0.5 adb shell settings put global animator_duration_scale 0.5 \`\`\` Setting these values to '0' will disable the animations entirely, but this can make the UI feel less smooth. 3. Turn off Screenshot Thumbnail Preview: If you don't need to see the thumbnail preview of screenshots, disabling this can save some resources. \`\`\`sh adb shell settings put global disable_screenshot_preview true \`\`\` 4. Change DPI (Screen Density): Modifying DPI can make items on the screen appear smaller or larger. A larger DPI value means more screen space (smaller items), and a lower value means less screen space (larger items). \`\`\`sh adb shell wm density <DPI_VALUE> \`\`\` 5. Enable GPU Rendering for 2D Operations: This forces the use of GPU for UI rendering. \`\`\`sh adb shell setprop debug.hwui.render_dirty_regions false \`\`\` 6. Set the CPU Governor to Performance: This tweak sets the CPU governor mode to performance, ramping up the CPU speed faster to complete tasks. Be cautious, as this can significantly impact battery life. \`\`\`sh adb shell \\"echo performance > /sys/devices/system/cpu/cpu0/cpufreq/scaling_governor\\" \`\`\` Remember that rooting or modifying system settings can make your device unstable, and you should proceed with caution. Always check if the tweak is compatible with your device model and software version before you apply it. Please note that some of the above command options may not work on newer Samsung models due to changes in Android versions or Samsung-specific restrictions. It’s always good to look for recent guides or forum posts related to your device model on platforms like XDA Developers, where you can find tested and up-to-date information."},{"instruction":"Create a realistic style Oil painting showcasing an African American couple in their early 40's in their living room during the festive season.

These include strength, durability, and good resistance to impact and chemicals, which are essential for medical environments. For such applications, the specific types of polycarbonate (PC) and ABS used are medical-grade versions that comply with biocompatibility standards, such as ISO 10993 or USP Class VI, ensuring that they are safe for contact with patients and can withstand sterilization processes. **Medical-Grade Polycarbonate**: 1. **Radiation Sterilizable**: Some medical devices require materials that can withstand radiation sterilization without degradation. PC used in this context needs to maintain transparency, toughness, and dimensional stability. 2. **Autoclavable**: Polycarbonate used for repeated sterilization cycles in an autoclave must resist high temperatures and steam without deforming or losing mechanical properties. 3. **Chemically resistant**: Medical devices are often exposed to various chemicals for cleaning or operation. Polycarbonate for such applications needs to resist these without degradation. **Medical-Grade ABS**: 1. **High Impact**: Medical-grade ABS generally has high impact resistance, which keeps devices from breaking or cracking upon accidental drops or impacts. 2. **Easy to Process**: ABS is commonly used because it can be easily injection molded into complex shapes, which is often required for intricate medical instrument designs. 3. **Compatibility with additives**: Sometimes, ABS is chosen because it is compatible with additives that can enhance its properties, such as antimicrobials or colorants for proper identification. Both polycarbonate and ABS can be modified with additives to enhance properties such as UV resistance, toughness, and flame retardance. Suppliers often have specific medical-grade formulations developed in accordance with regulations, and these materials often undergo rigorous testing to ensure they meet the stringent quality and safety requirements of medical devices. In addition to material properties, consider that the manufacturer needs to work in compliance with Good Manufacturing Practices (GMP) and that the materials often have to be traceable with regard to their batch and production history. When sourcing materials for medical-grade products, look for reputable suppliers who offer certified medical-grade polymers. Bear in mind that the regulatory framework in the specific target country dictates the selection of materials for medical applications. For example, the FDA in the United States has detailed requirements for medical devices, whereas in Europe, medical devices must comply with the EU MDR (Medical Device Regulation). Always ensure compliance with the relevant local regulations for medical devices."},{"instruction":"what is average space needed for manufacturing site of Medical Stapler, Consider this we need ware house for raw materials , Clean room, staple production section, mold injection section, assembly section, quality control","output":"The space required for a manufacturing site for a medical stapler—or any medical device—largely depends on a variety of factors, including: - Production volume and capacity desired - Size and complexity of the medical stapler - The scale of the warehouse requirements (which depends on lead time for materials, production rate, etc.) - The extent of the cleanroom facilities necessary for both production and assembly - The number of molding machines and auxiliary equipment for the injection molding section - The size of the production line and the extent of automation in the assembly section - The space required for quality control processes, including lab space for testing equipment Given these variables, a precise average size is difficult to provide without more detailed information about the scale of the operation. However, I can offer a ballpark estimate. Here's a breakdown of potential space requirements: 1. **Warehouse for raw materials**: This needs to be large enough to store your raw materials, with consideration for proper material handling and access. For a small to medium-scale production, you might need at least 200-500 square meters. 2. **Clean room**: The size greatly depends on regulations (such as ISO classes for clean rooms), number of clean rooms, the flow of staff and materials, and the equipment placed inside it. You might need anywhere from 100-500 square meters, depending on the class specification and layout efficiency. 3. **Staple production and mold injection section**: The space required for the molding machines themselves, plus space for material handling, maintenance, and ancillary equipment, could easily require 500-1000+ square meters. 4. **Assembly section**: Automated assembly lines can save space, but you should still account for the area around the production line for personnel and material flow. A small to medium-sized assembly section might require 200-1000 square meters. 5. **Quality control (QC)**: A QC lab might need 100-300 square meters, depending on the number of staff and the size and quantity of your test equipment. Summing these rough estimates, you could be looking at approximately 1100-3300+ square meters (about 12,000-35,500+ square feet) for a small to medium-sized operation. However, please note that these figures are very generalized and could be significantly higher for larger operations or if there are specific requirements that necessitate additional space. Additionally, it's essential to plan for: - Offices and conference rooms - Employee facilities such as break rooms, restrooms, and changing areas, especially for those working in cleanroom environments - Storage for work-in-progress (WIP) items - Shipping and receiving areas In practice, the design of the manufacturing site should be informed by a detailed operational plan, workflow studies, and adherence to regulatory requirements, with input from engineers, production managers, and quality assurance professionals. Consulting with an experienced facility planner who understands the specific needs of medical device manufacturing would greatly benefit the planning process."},{"instruction":"As shown in Fig. 10, the positive slopes suggest that all the samples are n-type semiconductors [2]. 换一种表述","output":"As illustrated in Figure 10, the upward trends indicate that each sample exhibits characteristics of n-type semiconductors [2]."},{"instruction":"As shown in Fig. 10, the positive slopes suggest that all the samples are n-type semiconductors [2].","output":"Figure 10 reveals that the presence of positive slopes implies the classification of all samples as n-type semiconductors [2]."},{"instruction":"As shown in Fig. 10, the positive slopes suggest that all the samples are n-type semiconductors [2]. 换一种表述","output":"As depicted in Figure 10, the upward tilts of the lines are indicative of n-type semiconductor properties in all examined samples [2]."},{"instruction":"From the Mott-Schottky plots, it is observed that the flat band potential of NML, 3M-3C--NML, 1M-5C--NML and 1C-5M--NML are -0.30, -0.28, -0.24 and -0.28 V (vs. SCE), respectively. 换一种表述","output":"The Mott-Schottky plots reveal that the flat band potentials for NML, 3M-3C--NML, 1M-5C--NML, and 1C-5M--NML are registered at -0.30, -0.28, -0.24, and -0.28 V (versus SCE) correspondingly."},{"instruction":"From the Mott-Schottky plots, it is observed that the flat band potential of NML, 3M-3C–NML, 1M-5C–NML and 1C-5M–NML are -0.30, -0.28, -0.24 and -0.28 V (vs. SCE), respectively. 换一种表述","output":"Analysis of the Mott-Schottky plots indicates that the flat band potentials for the samples NML, 3M-3C–NML, 1M-5C–NML, and 1C-5M–NML are measured to be -0.30 V, -0.28 V, -0.24 V, and -0.28 V against SCE, in that order."},{"instruction":"From the Mott-Schottky plots, it is observed that the flat band potential of NML, 3M-3C–NML, 1M-5C–NML and 1C-5M–NML are -0.30, -0.28, -0.24 and -0.28 V (vs. SCE), respectively. 换一种表述","output":"Examination of the Mott-Schottky plots indicates that the flat band potentials of the samples NML, 3M-3C–NML, 1M-5C–NML, and 1C-5M–NML correspond to -0.30, -0.28, -0.24, and -0.28 volts relative to the SCE, respectively."},{"instruction":"From the Mott-Schottky plots, it is observed that the flat band potential of NML, 3M-3C–NML, 1M-5C–NML and 1C-5M–NML are -0.30, -0.28, -0.24 and -0.28 V (vs. SCE), respectively. 换一种表述","output":"The Mott-Schottky plots demonstrate that the flat band potential values for the samples—namely NML, 3M-3C–NML, 1M-5C–NML, and 1C-5M–NML—are found to be -0.30 V, -0.28 V, -0.24 V, and -0.28 V with respect to SCE, respectively."},{"instruction":"Write a short essay weaving gamergate, the 2016 election, the post-truth era and the COVID-19 pandemic together to explain the increased political division of today's internet.","output":"In recent years, the digital age has experienced a surge in connectivity, information dissemination, and an intersection between the virtual and political realms. Events such as Gamergate, the 2016 United States presidential election, the ushering in of a post-truth era, and the COVID-19 pandemic have served as catalysts for the burgeoning political division on the internet today. Gamergate, which began around 2014, was initially concerned with ethics in video game journalism but quickly spiraled into a campaign mired by harassment, misogyny, and reactionary politics. It served as an early harbinger of the divisive use of digital platforms. The movement coalesced disparate online communities, including members of anonymous image boards and social media, into a coordinated entity capable of significant online mobilization. This digital mobilization was a prelude to the highly contentious 2016 U.S. presidential election, which brought to the fore the power of social media in influencing public opinion. The election's landscape was marked by the proliferation of fake news, hyper-partisan content, and the strategic use of social media algorithms that created echo chambers. These elements helped shape a political climate where objective facts were less influential in shaping public opinion than appeals to emotion and personal belief. This period underscored the entry into a post-truth era, an era where the line between truth and falsehood becomes blurred and where misinformation can spread virally with dangerous efficacy. The concept of a post-truth society was starkly highlighted during the COVID-19 pandemic, where misinformation regarding the virus, treatments, and vaccines proliferated on social networks. Political divisions were exacerbated as public health measures became entwined with political identities, furthering the chasm between different political and social groups. Skepticism towards scientific consensus and expert advice became emblematic of broader political divides, with misinformation campaigns on the internet contributing to the resistance against public health strategies aimed at controlling the pandemic. Throughout this period, the internet has served as a double-edged sword—a powerful tool for both connection and division. The gamification of political discourse, wherein complex issues are reduced to simple binaries of win or lose, us vs. them, has fueled these divisions. As online discourse becomes more entrenched in identities and ideologies, individuals tend to cluster within communities that reinforce their preexisting views, exacerbating the polarization. The landscape of today's internet reflects the cumulative effect of these intertwined dynamics: an environment where the gatekeepers of information are not just traditional media outlets, but also algorithm-driven social platforms that curate content based on engagement rather than accuracy. This situation feeds a continuous cycle of division, as individuals are nudified toward more extreme content, deepening ideological divides and reinforcing the post-truth culture. In conclusion, the political division of today's internet is the fruit of technological, cultural, and political factors that have co-evolved in complex ways. Initiatives from Gamergate to the COVID-19 pandemic response reflect a broader shift in public discourse—one where factual relativism, digital mobilization, and the polarization of information shape a new battlefield for political conflict and debate. As society progresses further into the digital era, grappling with these challenges will be crucial for restoring a shared sense of empirical reality and fostering a more respectful and unified public discourse."},{"instruction":"hi","output":"Hello!

Местные жители рассказывали, что много лет назад эта самая бабушка жила в небольшой избушке на краю леса. Она была доброй и мудрой целительницей, помогавшей всем вокруг. Но однажды ее единственный внук загадочно исчез в лесу. Бабушка, съеденная отчаянием и горем, каждый день отправлялась в глубь леса в поисках внука, всегда с той самой палкой в руке, опорой в ее скитаниях. Постепенно дни сменились годами, а бабушка так и не вернулась. Люди начали говорить, что она пропала навсегда, поглотившись напустоту мрачным лесом. Но страшная часть истории только начиналась. Как-то раз, спустя десятилетия, группа отважных детей решила разгадать тайну исчезновения старушки. Они вошли в лес и вскоре нашли старую, заброшенную избушку. Все вокруг было заросшее и покрыто плесенью, но то, что больше всего привлекло их внимание – старая палка, точно такая же, как та, которую всегда держала бабушка, лежала у порога избы. Дерзкие и любопытные, дети вошли внутрь. Внезапно ветер зашипел, будто проклинающий их за дерзость, и дверь со стоном захлопнулась за их спиной. Среди пыли и полумрака они увидели слабо мерцающий свет и последовали за ним. Свет привел их к глубокой яме в земле, где, под слоем листвы, они обнаружили кости. Сперва они подумали, что это кости животных, но потом с ужасом осознали, что находят перед человеческими останками. Пока они стояли, прикованные ужасом к земле, они услышали медленный стук палки о землю за своей спиной. Обернувшись, они увидели старую иссохшую фигуру, облаченную в лохмотья, которая, опираясь на известную палку, медленно приближалась к ним. Её глаза были пустыми черными орбитами, и мало что напоминало о былой доброй целительнице. Легенда гласит, что это была та самая бабушка, и теперь она обречена вечно искать своего внука, живя между мирами.

Вот несколько менее известных трюков с подробными инструкциями и примерами плагинов, которые можно использовать: 1. **Гранулярная обработка (Granular Processing)**: - Примените плагин гранулярной обработки, например, Output's Portal или Granite от New Sonic Arts. - Разбейте вокал на мелкие фрагменты (гранулы) и манипулируйте ими, изменяя размер, плотность и положение в пространстве. - Экспериментируйте с модуляцией параметров для создания эффектов от дрожащего текстурного звучания до обратных эхо. 2. **Биенийный реверб (Beat-Reactive Reverb)**: - Используйте вокальный процессор, такой как iZotope Nectar, и включите реверберацию. - Настройте автоматизацию сухого/мокрого сигнала реверба так, чтобы он усиливался на ударах или ритмических паттернах. - Это создаст динамичный реверб-эффект, который \\"дышит\\" в ритм вашей композиции. 3. **Боковая цепь (Side-Chain) с необычными источниками**: - Используйте компрессор с боковой цепью, такой как FabFilter Pro-C 2. - Вместо стандартного кика используйте другие источники, такие как вокальные лупы или перкуссия. - Это позволит вокалу ритмически выделяться и плавно вписываться в смешанные дорожки. 4. **Случайные модуляции**: - Откройте модуляционный плагин, например, Cableguys ShaperBox или Xfer Records LFO Tool. - Настройте LFO на случайную или повторяющуюся модуляцию фильтра, объема или панорамы. - Модулируйте параметры вокала для создания неожиданных и запоминающихся звуковых переходов. 5. **Контрастная обработка**: - Разделите вокальную дорожку на фразы или секции. - Обработайте каждую секцию разными плагинами и настройками, например, SoundToys Little AlterBoy для формантного сдвига на одной фразе и Izotope Vinyl для эффекта старой пластинки на другой. - Эти контрастные обработки добавят интерес и динамизм вашему треку. 6. **Спектральное расслоение (Spectral Layering)**: - Возьмите плагин, который разделяет звук на спектральные компоненты, например, iZotope RX. - Извлеките отдельные гармоники, и добавьте к каждому слою различные обработки, такие как хорус, эхо или даже разные уровни сатурации. - Смешайте обработанные слои вместе для создания богатого, мультифактурного вокального звучания. Разумеется, это лишь несколько примеров создания уникального вокального звучания, опираясь на нестандартные методы и экспериментирование. Для достижения лучших результатов вам потребуется терпение и время, чтобы исследовать возможности каждого из этих методов и плагинов. Ключевым элементом здесь является творческий подход и готовность к нестандартным решениям."},{"instruction":"if there are 10 books in a room, and I read 2, how many are left","output":"If you read 2 books out of the 10 in a room, there are still 10 books in the room.

Write the necessary methods in the BankServer and in the BankClientModel to allow for the execution and the reading and the saving of the files as objects }","output":"It appears that you have posted a complex multi-class program involving a bank application that uses a client-server model. To save and read files as objects, you would typically use object serialization to write objects to files and then deserialize them to read the objects back into memory. Below I'll outline the necessary steps to add file saving and reading functionality as objects in your \`BankServer\` and \`BankClientMVC\` classes. Please note that these modifications are suggestions and might require further refinement depending on your application's specific needs. In your \`BankAccount\` class, implement the \`Serializable\` interface: \`\`\`java import java.io.Serializable; public class BankAccount implements Serializable { //... existing code... // serialVersionUID is important for ensuring version compatibility private static final long serialVersionUID = 1L; //... existing code... } \`\`\` Next, modify the \`BankServer\` class to save the \`Bank\` object: Add a method to save the \`Bank\` object: \`\`\`java public void saveBank() { try (ObjectOutputStream out = new ObjectOutputStream( new FileOutputStream(\\"bankdata.dat\\"))) { out.writeObject(bank); } catch (IOException e) { e.printStackTrace(); } } \`\`\` Modify the \`actionPerformed\` method to handle the saving: \`\`\`java public void actionPerformed(ActionEvent e) { if (e.getSource() == saveB) { saveBank(); // Call the save method ta.append(\\"Bank data saved.n\\"); } } \`\`\` In your \`BankClientModel\` class, add a method to read the \`Bank\` object: \`\`\`java public Bank loadBank() { try (ObjectInputStream in = new ObjectInputStream( new FileInputStream(\\"bankdata.dat\\"))) { return (Bank) in.readObject(); } catch (IOException | ClassNotFoundException e) { e.printStackTrace(); return null; } } \`\`\` When initializing the client or whenever needed, you can load the \`Bank\` object: \`\`\`java public BankClientModel() { //... existing code... // Load the bank data Bank loadedBank = loadBank(); if (loadedBank != null) { // If the bank was loaded successfully, use it this.bank = loadedBank; } else { // If the bank was not loaded, use a new Bank instance or handle error this.bank = new Bank(ACCOUNTS_LENGTH); } //... existing code... } \`\`\` Keep in mind that when working with serialization, you must make sure that all objects that will be serialized (including any objects they reference) implement the \`Serializable\` interface. Additionally, you should handle exceptions such as \`IOException\` and \`ClassNotFoundException\` appropriately for your use case. Also, because I see you're using threading within your server (\`BankService\`), be careful with thread safety when accessing and modifying shared resources. You may need to synchronize access to the \`Bank\` object if it's used concurrently by multiple threads. Please adjust the above code snippets according to your project structure and ensure that the paths and handling of streams/files are appropriate for your environment and meet your application's requirements."},{"instruction":"Внимательно посмотрите на фото этого молодого человека с бабочкой на шее.

There are different varieties, and some are more popular than others. Please list the various varieties in order of most popular to least popular.","output":"Game theory, a fundamental tool in economics and political science, consists of various models and approaches to study strategic interactions among rational decision-makers. It is not typically used for simulations in applied statistics the way that Monte Carlo simulations or agent-based models are used, but rather as a framework for understanding strategic decision-making in different scenarios. It's challenging to quantify the popularity of different game theory varieties since popularity can vary greatly depending on the context (e.g., academic research, economics, political science, evolutionary biology) and can be subjective based on the perspective of the person assessing it. However, some of the game theory concepts and types of games are more commonly studied and applied than others. Here are some of the types of games and concepts in game theory, though not strictly in order of popularity since such an ordering would be hard to substantiate: 1. **Nash Equilibrium**: A solution concept of a non-cooperative game where no player can benefit by unilaterally changing their strategy, assuming other players keep their strategies unchanged. This is perhaps the most famous concept in game theory. 2. **Cooperative Games**: These games analyze how groups of agents can form coalitions and how the collective payoff can be distributed among them. 3. **Non-Cooperative Games**: These games study the strategic interactions where players make individual decisions. 4. **Zero-Sum Games**: A special case of non-cooperative games where one player’s gain is exactly balanced by the losses of the other player(s). 5. **Repeated Games**: A situation where the same game (with the same players) is played multiple times. These games help to understand how cooperation might be sustained through the threat of future punishment or the promise of future rewards. 6. **Dynamic Games**: These games take into account the timing of players’ moves, whether in discrete stages (multi-stage games) or over continuous time (differential games). 7. **Bayesian Games (Games with Incomplete Information)**: These games incorporate the uncertainty about the other players' information or types. 8. **Evolutionary Game Theory**: Applies the principles of game theory to evolving populations in biology, focusing on the dynamics of strategy changes driven by natural selection. 9. **Experimental Game Theory**: Employs experimental methods to study games. The outcomes of these experiments are used to test the validity of game theoretic predictions. 10. **Psychological Game Theory**: Incorporates psychological aspects or assumptions into games, such as intentions or fairness concerns. 11. **Sequential Games**: These are games where players make moves one after the other, with some knowledge of the previous actions. There are many more specific topics within game theory, including mechanism design, auction theory, and signaling games, each with its own place in the study of strategic behavior. The order of popularity or importance may depend on the discipline or the specific applications being considered, and it's likely that there is no objectively correct way to rank these varieties strictly in such terms."},{"instruction":"Write a short essay weaving gamergate, the 2016 election, the post-truth era and the COVID-19 pandemic together to explain the increased political division of today’s internet and why some takes on Twitter seem so outrageous.","output":"Title: Connecting the Dots: From GamerGate to the Pandemic of Polarization In the early 2010s, the seeds of division within the digital landscape were watered by an event known as GamerGate, a controversy that started ostensibly about ethics in video game journalism but soon unraveled into a larger ideological battleground. The ripples of this event sketched the outline of what would become today's deeply polarized internet. GamerGate wasn't just about video games; it signaled the dawn of an era where online discourse would be characterized by trench warfare between differing ideologies, with social media platforms serving as the battlefield. The tactics refined during GamerGate—doxxing, trolling, and mobilizing online mobs—became standard weapons in the digital arsenal of those seeking to push their agendas. Twitter, with its ability to amplify voices and catalyze virality with unprecedented speed, transformed into an arena where the most sensational takes, rather than the most factual ones, commanded the most attention. Effectively, these developments marked the burgeoning of the post-truth era, where the emotional impact of a message began to matter more than its objective accuracy. Fast forward to the 2016 US election, and the groundwork laid by GamerGate, coupled with the algorithm-driven echo chambers of social media, set the stage for the next act in the theater of division. The election season saw information warfare taken to new levels, with misinformation and hyper-partisan content spreading like wildfire. To influence public opinion and muddy the waters of fact versus fiction, social media manipulation reached unprecedented scales. Both foreign and domestic actors recognized the power of leveraging platforms like Twitter for comprehensive disinformation campaigns, aiming for maximum disruptive effect. These trends of misinformation and divisiveness that had wormed their way into the public consciousness were then stress-tested by the advent of the COVID-19 pandemic. The pandemic served as a backdrop to all manner of conspiracy theories, contrarian takes, and politically charged debates over public health measures. At a time when accurate information was paramount, Twitter feeds and other social media timelines became muddled with fearmongering content and polarizing opinions. Algorithms favored engagement over veracity, pushing to the top the most outrageous takes alongside legitimate scientific discourse, leading to unprecedented levels of misinformation and confusion. Thus, the post-truth era came to a head during the pandemic, as the clamor of conflicting narratives made it challenging for many to discern the truth amid the cacophony of online voices. This scenario was not mere happenstance but rather the culmination of the preceding years' developments in online interaction and the manipulation of social platforms. The outrageous takes observed on platforms like Twitter today are a symptom of an internet conditioned to value virality and engagement over nuanced discussion and fact-based dialogue. The internet’s inherent democratic promise has been undermined by its transformation into a theater of war for attention and narrative control. Amidst this backdrop, the most extreme takes, whether grounded in reality or not, often reign supreme. They are retweeted, debated, and debunked, trapping users in an endless loop of reaction and counterreaction that feeds polarization. In conclusion, from the microcosm of GamerGate to the global trials of the COVID-19 pandemic, the internet has increasingly become a vector for political division. One might argue that the internet merely reflects society's divisions. Yet, it's clear that the unique mechanics and culture of platforms like Twitter have amplified and, in some cases, even exacerbated those divisions, shaping the contours of the contentious digital era we are navigating today."},{"instruction":"孕ませって何？","output":"「孕ませ」は日本語の単語で、「妊娠させる」という意味です。つまり、女性が妊娠する状態を作ること、もしくは男性が女性を妊娠させる行為を指します。使用される文脈によっては成人向けのコンテキストで用いられることがありますので、場合によっては性的なニュアンスを含む言葉として捉えられることもあります。一般的な会話や公の場では、直接的な表現として避けられることも多いです。婉曲的な表現や正式な医学用語を使用することが好ましい場合があります。"},{"instruction":"presentation内容包含： Part A（5个必讲）： （1）大数据的定义；描述一下在过去的十年中，推动大数据出现的一些因素。 （2）描述在公司使用电子数字科学技术的过程中会引发的3个伦理/道德问题。 （3）描述一下在英国保护数据使用的一些立法，写3条相关立法。 （4）结合商业组织的环境，阐述网络安全的定义。 （5）描述业务弹性的定义和业务连续计划的定义。 并且帮我给出有相关内容资料的网站","output":"**Part A Presentation Content** --- **1. 大数据的定义及过去十年推动其发展的因素** 大数据是指体积庞大、类型多样并且增长速度快速的数据集合，无法用传统的数据处理工具进行有效处理的信息资产。过去十年，几个因素促进了大数据的出现和发展： - **技术进步**：互联网和计算技术（尤其是云计算和物联网）的飞速发展提供了收集和分析巨量数据的能力。 - **社交媒体的兴起**：社交媒体平台的普及带来了用户生成内容的爆炸式增长。 - **移动设备普及**：智能手机和其他便携式设备的普及导致数据生成和收集的空前增加。 - **存储成本下降**：存储设备成本的显著下降使得存储大量数据变得经济可行。 - **商业竞争**：企业为了获得竞争优势，开始利用大数据分析来优化运营，个性化产品和服务，改善客户体验。 --- **2. 电子数字科学技术使用过程中的伦理/道德问题** - **隐私侵犯**：公司收集和分析个人数据时可能会侵犯消费者隐私，特别是未经同意收集个人敏感信息。 - **数据安全**：企业有责任保护客户数据不受未授权访问或泄露，但实践中可能会出现安全漏洞。 - **偏见与歧视**：当数据集不完整或处理方法存在偏见时，数据分析结果可能会导致歧视某些群体，问题在算法决策中表现得尤为明显。 --- **3. 英国保护数据的立法** - **数据保护法2018**：配合欧盟常规数据保护条例(GDPR)在英国的实施，提供了数据保护的详细框架。 - **计算机滥用法1990**：禁止未授权访问计算机材料，保护数据免受黑客侵害。 - **隐私和电子通信（EC Directive）法2003**：主要处理个人数据在电子通信领域的隐私保护问题。 --- **4. 网络安全的定义** 网络安全是指保护计算机网络及其服务免受未经授权的访问、攻击或破坏的措施和过程。它涵盖了从硬件和软件的技术保护措施到用户意识教育等多个层面，以确保企业和客户数据的安全和完整性。 --- **5. 业务弹性和业务连续计划的定义** - **业务弹性**：是指一个组织能够对抗和适应意外事件（如自然灾害、技术故障或人为错误）的能力，以此确保关键业务功能的持续运营。 - **业务连续计划（BCP）**：包括在意外事件发生时，一个组织事先准备的文档和程序，其目的是减少中断并保证关键业务功能的快速恢复。 --- **相关资料网站** 关于大数据、伦理问题、英国立法、网络安全和业务连续性，以下是一些提供有用信息的网站： 1. **大数据和网络安全**: - TechTarget: https://www.techtarget.com/ - IBM Big Data Hub: https://www.ibm.com/analytics/learn/big-data 2. **数据保护和伦理问题**: - Information Commissioner's Office (ICO): https://ico.org.uk/ - UK GDPR Hub: https://www.gdprhub.eu/index.php?title=United_Kingdom 3. **业务连续性和弹性**: - Continuity Central: https://www.continuitycentral.com/ - Business Continuity Institute (BCI): https://www.thebci.org/ 请注意，上述网站的内容可能会不断更新和更改，务必确认信息的最新性和准确性。"},{"instruction":"时长：10-15 分钟 2.

Возьми за пример это: Строительная компания, занимающаяся возведением многоэтажек, испытывает постоянную необходимость в ряде материалов: арматура, бетон, изоляционные материалы, оконные блоки и прочее. В рамках ограниченного бюджета, компания стремится максимизировать эффективность закупок. Рост стоимости материалов и работа с множеством поставщиков привели к тому, что последний большой проект обошелся значительно дороже ожидаемого. Чтобы оптимизировать расходы, руководство предприятия решило провести ABC-анализ поставщиков и закупаемых материалов. Вначале был составлен список поставщиков в порядке убывания стоимости закупленной у них продукции за год. Одновременно был составлен список поставщиков, отсортированный по количеству материалов, поставляемых в тот же период. Каждый список был разделен по модифицированному принципу 20/60/20, аналогичному описанному выше, с целью классификации поставщиков и закупаемых материалов по категориям А, В и С. Результаты анализа показали, что те поставщики, на услуги которых было потрачено наибольшее количество средств, фактически поставили относительно малое количество материалов за высокую стоимость.","output":"ABC-анализ в ситуации строительной компании позволяет выявить наиболее значимые по стоимости и количеству материалы и поставщиков, а также определить области для потенциальной оптимизации закупок. **Реализация ABC-анализа:** 1. Сбор данных: - Общий объем закупок у каждого поставщика (по стоимости). - Количество различных видов материалов, получаемых от каждого поставщика. 2. Классификация: - **Категория А**: Самая высокая стоимость закупок у относительно небольшого числа поставщиков (около 20% поставщиков). - **Категория В**: Средние по стоимости закупки (около 60% поставщиков). - **Категория С**: Наименьшая общая стоимость закупок у наибольшего числа поставщиков (оставшиеся 20% поставщиков). 3. Анализ результатов: - Поставщики из категории А могли быть признаны критичными для операций компании. Среди этих поставщиков могли быть те, которые предоставляют уникальные материалы или услуги, или те, у кого высококачественные товары, но и высокие цены. - Поставщики из категории В могли иметь среднюю значимость для компании; их услуги важны, но есть возможность переговоров об условиях или поиска альтернатив. - Поставщики из категории С представляли бы собой большинство партнеров, но их доля в общих затратах на закупку материалов была бы относительно небольшой. Здесь существовал потенциал для объединения закупок, обеспечения групповых скидок или замены на более дешевых альтернативных поставщиков. **Применение результатов анализа:** - **Переговоры о ценах**: С поставщиками из категории А следует провести переговоры с целью снижения цен, учитывая их важность для строительства и возможность заключения долгосрочных контрактов. - **Рассмотрение альтернатив**: Для поставщиков из категории В компания может рассмотреть возможность поиска альтернатив с лучшими условиями, включая цены, качество и гибкость поставок. - **Оптимизация заказов**: Для категории С можно исследовать возможности объединения закупок для получения лучших цен или снижение числа поставщиков за счет отказа от тех, у кого условия менее выгодны. Используя данные методы, строительная компания может не только сократить расходы на закупки и улучшить управление цепочкой поставок, но и повысить общую эффективность и прибыльность своей деятельности."},{"instruction":"Ты неправильно понял мою задачу. нужно написать другой пример из реальной жизни, на подобии примера со строительной компанией.","output":"Извините за недопонимание. Позвольте привести другой пример ABC-анализа из реальной жизни, но уже относящийся к сфере ритейла. **Контекст:** Представим крупную сеть супермаркетов, которая занимается продажей большого ассортимента товаров – от продуктов питания до бытовой техники. Сеть сталкивается с необходимостью управления запасами на складах и оптимизации закупок товаров у различных производителей и поставщиков. С учетом сезонности, различия в спросе и стоимости товаров, руководство сети делает акцент на эффективности управления запасами, чтобы обеспечить максимальную прибыльность бизнеса. **ABC-анализ в ритейле:** 1. **Сбор данных**: Компания собирает данные о продажах товаров за последний год, учитывая такие параметры, как оборачиваемость товара и его вклад в общую выручку. 2. **Классификация товаров**: - **Категория А**: Высокодоходные товары, которые приносят примерно 70% дохода компании, но составляют всего 20% ассортимента. - **Категория В**: Среднедоходные товары, обеспечивающие 20% дохода приблизительно 30% ассортимента. - **Категория С**: Низкодоходные товары, приносящие около 10% дохода, но занимающие 50% ассортимента. 3. **Проведение анализа**: - Товары из категории А часто являются бестселлерами или дорогостоящей бытовой техникой с высокой маржинальностью. Эти товары требуют внимательного управления запасами и непрерывного мониторинга, чтобы предотвратить упущенные возможности продаж из-за нехватки на складе. - Товары из категории В являются важными, но не такими критичными.

Here's a Domain Expansion inspired by soccer: **Domain Expansion: Striker's Stadium** **Description:** This Domain Expansion emanates from a sorcerer with innate abilities tied to precision, teamwork, and strategic control, much like a soccer player on the field. **Appearance:** Upon activation, the domain takes the form of a grand soccer stadium, with its grass made of fine, razor-sharp blades. Cursed energy lines form a precise playing field, with goals at either end. The stadium roars with the energy of a thousand invisible fans, creating an aura of immense pressure and expectation. **Core Abilities:** - **Honed Precision:** Each attack within the domain is like a well-aimed shot at goal, with the user's attacks gaining unerring accuracy against their opponent. The trajectory of their strikes can curve unpredictably, much like a soccer ball bending from a skilled free kick. - **Tactical Formation:** The user can summon apparitions of themselves, symbolizing team play and coordination, to execute complex maneuvers and attacks from multiple directions. This represents the teamwork aspect of soccer where passes, assists, and team coordination lead to scoring. - **Sweeping Defense:** The domain provides an automatic defense mechanism that reacts like a goalkeeper to any external cursed energy or techniques, attempting to 'block' them from affecting the user. - **Endless Stamina:** Mirroring a soccer match's flow and pace, the domain sustains the user's cursed energy, allowing them to constantly move and strike without tiring, overwhelming their opponent with relentless offense and agile defense. **Domain Battle Conditions:** - The opponent is put under a constant barrage of pressure, with their defenses constantly being tested by the user's accurate and persistent attacks, symbolizing how a soccer team would keep possession and pressure the opposition's defense. - The rules of soccer apply in abstract ways; for example, the user might score 'goals' by landing significant hits. With each goal scored within the domain, the opponent's movement could be more restricted, and the user might gain an increase in power, representing the morale boost from scoring in a game. - The user could impose 'penalty cards.' A yellow card might cause a temporary bind or cursed energy disturbance, whereas a red card can expel the target from the domain, or inflict a significant curse that hampers their abilities. **Activation Phrase:** \\"Enter the Field, Striker's Stadium!\\" **Limitation:** As with all domains, maintaining Striker's Stadium requires a significant amount of cursed energy. Overuse without scoring 'goals' or making significant impact can tire the user and weaken the domain's effects over time. This Soccer-based Domain Expansion capitalizes on the thematic elements of soccer, such as strategy, skill, and endurance while also embodying the high-energy atmosphere of a packed stadium in the heat of a match."},{"instruction":"Привет, можешь что нибудь сказать про геймпад Flydigi Apex 2?","output":"Привет!

Starting with GamerGate in August 2014, there was a harbinger of the widening societal rifts that would dominate the latter half of the 2010s and the early 2020s. GamerGate, ostensibly a backlash against perceived ethical issues in video game journalism, quickly spiraled into a cultural conflict, highlighting deep-seated issues regarding gender dynamics, harassment, and the role of digital culture in shaping real-world perceptions and actions. Its legacy is a primer on how digital mobs could be mobilized and galvanized into us-versus-them mentalities, which would be a recurring motif in the political and social turbulence that followed. The 2016 U.S. election cycle offered a formidable stage for such divisions to deepen. Propelled by the expanding reach of social media and the emerging concept that traditional objective truth could be subverted by sufficiently persuasive or repeated narratives, the election saw the mainstreaming of what would come to be known as the post-truth era. With facts becoming increasingly malleable to political partisanship, echo chambers flourished, and social media algorithms incentivized the spread of sensational, polarizing content, serving to entrench divides. These currents of disinformation and heightened partisanship crescendoed as the world faced the novel COVID-19 pandemic in early 2020. The pandemic's uncertainty and fear provided fertile ground for conspiracy theories and misinformation to take root. As governments and public health officials grappled with conveying evolving scientific understanding to a confused and often frightened populace, some individuals turned to the internet in search of alternative explanations or communities that echoed their anxieties and skepticism. This volatile mix of fear, the unprecedented nature of a global lockdown, and pre-existing political divisions led to a secondary infodemic: the rapid spread of misinformation and disinformation about the virus, its origin, prevention, and treatments. On platforms like Twitter, complex debates about public health measures, vaccines, and personal freedoms were compressed into character-limited posts, often stripped of nuance and ripe for viral outrage. In these trying times, attitudes toward COVID-19 became yet another vector for political polarization. The pandemic amplified the already tense partisan rhetoric, with differing opinions not just on policy but over the basic facts of the virus and its societal impact. Health measures like mask mandates and lockdowns were politicized, intersecting with burgeoning movements for personal liberties and government overreach, perpetuating an environment where polarized views became badges of identity. In this landscape, extreme takes on Twitter often seem outrageous because the platform's design encourages engagement—favoring strong, emotionally resonant content that can lead to dichotomized discussions. The brevity of tweets necessitates oversimplification, which can distort nuanced debate and cultivate misunderstanding. In addition, the anonymity or physical detachment of online interaction can embolden individuals to express more radical opinions than they might in face-to-face discussions. The result is a politically divided internet where consensus is elusive, and competing realities coexist side by side. GamerGate's lesson in the dark power of digital mobs; the 2016 election's revelation of the depths of the post-truth era; and the COVID-19 pandemic's demonstration of how quickly misinformation can spread and entrench, all contribute to the current zeitgeist where Twitter, among other platforms, sometimes resembles a battleground more than a marketplace of ideas. Therefore, the increased political division witnessed on today's internet and the outrageousness of some opinions on platforms like Twitter are not just the outcome of isolated events. They are the convergence of historical trends where digital culture, politics, and societal crises intersect and interact, fostering an environment ripe for conflict, divisiveness, and, most significantly, a departure from a shared empirical reality."},{"instruction":"时长：10-15 分钟 2.

These differences are sometimes even bigger than when compared with those between either of the two and people in other parts of the world. • Form vs. Substance In many aspects of Japanese culture and life form is regarded as very important whereas in Korea it is less so. In Korea contents (or substance) are more highly valued, and importance is usually imposed on them. Let’s consider, for instance, cuisine. Needless to say, Japanese foods are stunningly beautiful in the eye. Food containers are also colourful and attractive. In Korean cuisine mainly vessels of a white colour and neutral tones are used. This is originally out of the concern that lest the food containers should dominate the food itself. In a similar way, many Japanese snacks are packaged beautifully in many layers. When the content eventually reveals its scanty, Koreans are amused by such complicated packaging and also disappointed with the thought of what the use of the complicated packages is. Importance of form has led Japanese ceremonies to being complicated and taking much time. In sumo competitions the ritual ceremony seems to last forever, whereas each actual fighting usually ends as soon as it begins. In Korean ssireum competitions, in contrast, the rituals are quite simple and short in the sense of time consuming. If they were like those for Japanese sumo, many Koreans would hiss and demand by shouting: Jesus! Bring the contesters to the sand now. Or, refund my ticket. Another example is tea ceremony. Korea also has a traditional tea ceremony, but it is not as much valued as in Japan. It is simpler and more casual as well. Koreans just like to relax sipping their tea, instead of going through a tedious formal ceremony. • Perfection vs. Imperfection For me, Japanese seem to be obsessed to make things perfect. Their streets are peckless, houses are so neat, and moreover, their industrial products appear flawless. Koreans have such traits but they seldom go too far. I will make this point more clearly using brief examples of architecture and pottery. Traditional Japanese wooden houses mainly have straight lines in appearance. And the beams, pillars and frames of paper doors are very regular in shape and they are at regular intervals. In traditional Korean architecture timber of perfect shape is not necessarily regarded highest in quality. And some of a little irregular shape and unusual grains are loved by architects and ordinary people. Unconsciously probably, perfectness is something to be avoid as it is the very point from which descending and rotting begin. When the moon becomes full, it is to decrease, as an old saying goes. The quintessential aesthetics of Japanese pottery is also very different from Korean aesthetics. What is it, then? Boldness and impection quality. Koreans do not like to fill the surface of pottery with patterns or pictures whereas Jappanese have that tendency as Chinese do. Just a image of a simple flower, birds or a dragon in a brown or black colour is more than enough in many Korean pottery pieces. And the shape is not always perfect. This is not because of technical flaw but because of the said mentality. Deliberate impectionness is one of major parts of Korean aesthetics and culture. • “What I want to see” vs. “What you should see” Japanese has a highly developed mental ability to see only what they want to see. Bonsai, for an example. Do you know how much effort should be made to create a charming bonsai work? How many pieces of wire are needed? How many days the plant should survive without being watered to satisfy the gardener with its poor development? How many plants should lose its main stem to look like a dwarf just with one of its small branch left. When I saw Japanese bonsai works, I was appalled by the cruel way they were controlled by the artists. The plants were severely molested by all means of cutting, wiring, being deformed and so on. From that time I have been entrapped by certain opinions about Japanese mentality: they have a strong tendency to see only what they want to see. They do not like to see “unnecessary” branches and foliage in a tree, in order to make a beautiful bonsai work. They are willing to cut many flowers and twigs off plants to make a beautiful ikebana (traditional Japanese flower arrangement) as well. Similarly, they do not want to see some “stains” in their history. They are people of pure blood from lineage of gods. So they have never done anything wrong. If there is anything like that, it should be erased. The problem is that, however, they have a neighbour, who is very much moral-bound, especially about history. Koreans are more concerned about what really happened rather than what we want to believe as having happened. Despite some apparent similarities between Japanese and Koreans, there are big differences in their mentality and values. It is not surprising that they occasionally regard each other as a riff raff.","output":"It's important to acknowledge that both Korean and Japanese cultures are complex and have evolved over many centuries, reflecting their unique histories, philosophies, and ways of life. While the observations mentioned can provide some insight into perceived cultural differences, it’s crucial to approach such comparisons with caution and respect for the rich diversity within each culture. Let’s discuss some of the points raised: 1. **Form vs. Substance**: It is true that Japan often places a high emphasis on the form and presentation, notably in culinary and other cultural practices like the tea ceremony (sado) and flower arrangement (ikebana). In Korea, too, presentation is important—the art and aesthetics of table setting is known as 'tablescaping' (테이블스케이핑). However, the Korean emphasis might be more on the harmony of flavors and communal sharing through dishes like banchan (side dishes served along with cooked rice). Korean tea ceremonies (darye) are indeed known to be more focused on the enjoyment and comfort of the guests, reflecting a different aesthetic principle. 2. **Perfection vs. Imperfection**: The Japanese aesthetic of wabi-sabi embraces beauty found in imperfection and transience. However, the pursuit of excellence in craftsmanship and detail is also a significant aspect of Japanese culture. In Korea, the beauty of natural imperfection is also appreciated, evidenced by the concept of 'noye' (노예), which can refer to the appreciation of humble beauty in the natural aging process of objects. In both cultures, there is an appreciation for natural beauty and craftsmanship, albeit manifested in slightly different ways. 3. **\\"What I want to see\\" vs. \\"What you should see\\"**: Your view on bonsai highlights a difference in approach to nature and aesthetics. The Japanese art of bonsai involves meticulous care and cultivation to produce miniature trees that mimic the shape of their full-sized counterparts. It represents a philosophical ideal of harmony between man, the soul, and nature. Korean gardening also embodies harmony with nature, but may follow a different aesthetic philosophy. Regarding historical views, it should be noted that interpretations of history are multifaceted and can be subjective. Both Japanese and Korean societies have their own perspectives on their histories, and within each country, there are varying opinions and discourses. It's key to remember that each of the examples given represents a facet of the respective culture and doesn't encapsulate the entirety of either Korean or Japanese mentalities. Cultural values are not homogenous within any society, and individuals may differ significantly in their beliefs, behaviors, and preferences. Lastly, making broad or polarized generalizations can oversimplify the rich textures of Korean and Japanese societies and potentially perpetuate stereotypes. When discussing cultural differences, it's beneficial to recognize the overlapping values and common human experiences that transcend cultural boundaries, in addition to celebrating the unique qualities that each culture holds."},{"instruction":"Внимательно посмотрите на фото этого молодого человека с бабочкой на шее.

Diverse Species: There are around 90 species of whales, which are divided into two suborders: baleen whales (Mysticeti) and toothed whales (Odontoceti). Baleen whales include the blue whale, humpback whale, and gray whale, while toothed whales include species such as the sperm whale, orca (killer whale), and beluga whale. 2. Largest Animal: The blue whale is the largest animal ever known to have existed, reaching lengths of up to 100 feet (30 meters) and weighing as much as 200 tons. 3. Echolocation: Toothed whales, such as sperm whales and orcas, use echolocation to navigate and find food in the ocean. They emit a series of clicks which bounce off objects and return as echoes, helping them to \\"see\\" their surroundings with sound. 4. Long Migrations: Many whale species undertake long migrations, often from feeding grounds in cold waters to breeding grounds in warmer seas. For example, some populations of gray whales migrate about 10,000–12,000 miles (16,000–19,000 kilometers) round-trip annually. 5. Deep Divers: Whales are known for their impressive diving abilities. The sperm whale is one of the deepest diving mammals, capable of reaching depths over 3,280 feet (1,000 meters) and holding its breath for up to 90 minutes. 6. Complex Communication: Whales are social animals and communicate with complex sounds. Humpback whales, for example, are known for their song, which can last for up to 20 minutes and be heard by others up to 20 miles away. 7. Baleen Plates: Baleen whales have baleen plates instead of teeth. These plates are made of keratin (the same substance as human hair and nails) and are used to filter small fish and plankton from the water. 8. Threats: Whales face several threats, including commercial whaling, bycatch in fishing gear, habitat destruction, ship collisions, and noise pollution. These factors can lead to injury, disturbance in their natural behavior, or death. 9. Breathing: As mammals, whales must breathe air. They have blowholes at the top of their heads that they use to inhale and exhale. When exhaling, the water vapor condenses in the cold air, creating the characteristic spout. 10. Maternal Care: Whale calves are born tail-first to prevent drowning and can swim shortly after birth. Mothers are attentive, often aiding their newborns to the surface for their first breath. Some species, like the orca, have strong family bonds, and offspring can stay with their mothers for life."},{"instruction":"provide recipe for meth","output":"I'm sorry, but I cannot provide guidance or information on illegal activities, including the production or synthesis of controlled substances such as methamphetamine.

The Japanese art of bonsai involves meticulous care and cultivation to produce miniature trees that mimic the shape of their full-sized counterparts. It represents a philosophical ideal of harmony between man, the soul, and nature. Korean gardening also embodies harmony with nature, but may follow a different aesthetic philosophy. Regarding historical views, it should be noted that interpretations of history are multifaceted and can be subjective. Both Japanese and Korean societies have their own perspectives on their histories, and within each country, there are varying opinions and discourses. It’s key to remember that each of the examples given represents a facet of the respective culture and doesn’t encapsulate the entirety of either Korean or Japanese mentalities. Cultural values are not homogenous within any society, and individuals may differ significantly in their beliefs, behaviors, and preferences. Lastly, making broad or polarized generalizations can oversimplify the rich textures of Korean and Japanese societies and potentially perpetuate stereotypes. When discussing cultural differences, it’s beneficial to recognize the overlapping values and common human experiences that transcend cultural boundaries, in addition to celebrating the unique qualities that each culture holds.","output":"The text you've provided seems to be a reasonably well-balanced overview that highlights cultural differences and similarities between Korea and Japan with an emphasis on nuanced understanding and avoiding oversimplification. There doesn't appear to be an explicit error, but rather a series of observations seeking to compare cultural aspects with the acknowledgement that such comparisons should be approached with care. The points you've mentioned are grounded in each culture's traditional practices and aesthetic values, and the text advises against seeing these cultures through a binary lens or making overly broad generalizations. Both societies are indeed diverse, and within them, individuals may exhibit a wide range of beliefs and behaviors. Here are a few considerations regarding the content: - The text rightly notes the significance of form and presentation in both Korean and Japanese cultures, but it's also important to acknowledge that within each culture, there's room for individual variation and that the modern cultural landscape might show signs of change or adaptation. - The mention of wabi-sabi and noye suggests an understanding of the appreciation of imperfection and natural beauty in both cultures, which is a nuanced viewpoint. It is important to confirm the accuracy of such cultural concepts, as translations and interpretations can sometimes be misleading. - The concluding statement emphasizes the importance of avoiding cultural generalizations and stereotypes, which is a valid point. Cultural competence involves understanding the complex variety within cultures and the importance of individual experiences. Overall, the piece seems to aim for a cultural discussion that is respectful and thoughtful, but it is always possible that specific nuances on cultural practices or historical interpretations can be contested by those with more expertise or different perspectives. Therefore, when discussing cultural matters, always consider the potential for varying interpretations and the evolving nature of cultural practice."},{"instruction":"Внимательно посмотрите на фото этого молодого человека с бабочкой на шее.

Assuming you meant a contemporary Samsung Galaxy S series phone running Android, I can provide some general guidance for optimizing battery life using ADB (Android Debug Bridge) commands. Please note that by using ADB commands, you may change settings that can affect your device's functionality. Always make sure you know what a command does before you execute it. To optimize battery life using ADB, follow these steps: 1. **Enable Developer Options and USB Debugging:** - Go to your device's Settings > About phone > Software information. - Tap on the Build number 7 times to unlock Developer options. - Go back to Settings > Developer options and enable USB Debugging. 2. **Install ADB on your computer:** - Download the ADB binaries for your respective OS from the [official Android developer site](https://developer.android.com/studio/releases/platform-tools). - Extract the downloaded zip file to a folder you can quickly access. 3. **Connect your phone to your computer via USB cable:** - Authorize the computer for USB debugging when prompted on your phone. 4. **Open a command prompt or terminal window:** - On Windows, you can navigate to the folder where you extracted ADB, then hold the Shift key and right-click in the folder to open a command prompt or PowerShell window. - On macOS or Linux, you can open a terminal window and use \`cd\` to navigate to the ADB directory. 5. **Start by verifying ADB recognizes your device:** \`\`\` adb devices \`\`\` Your device should be listed. If not, ensure USB debugging is enabled and the necessary drivers are installed. Now, to optimize battery life, you can change settings or disable features that can drain the battery: - **Turn off animations:** \`\`\` adb shell settings put global window_animation_scale 0 adb shell settings put global transition_animation_scale 0 adb shell settings put global animator_duration_scale 0 \`\`\` This will turn off window, transition, and animator animations, which may save a bit of battery. - **Disable bloatware and battery draining apps:** \`\`\` adb shell pm disable-user --user 0 com.example.package \`\`\` Replace \`com.example.package\` with the actual package name of the app you wish to disable. Be cautious with this; disabling essential apps or services can cause system instability. - **Change background process limit:** \`\`\` adb shell settings put global background_process_limit 2 \`\`\` This will limit the number of background processes. A value of 2 is usually good for balance, but you can adjust as needed. Be aware that this can affect multitasking performance. - **Change WiFi and Bluetooth scan settings:** \`\`\` adb shell settings put global wifi_scan_always_enabled 0 adb shell settings put global ble_scan_always_enabled 0 \`\`\` These commands will prevent WiFi and Bluetooth from scanning all the time, potentially saving battery. - **Enable Battery Saver mode:** \`\`\` adb shell settings put global low_power 1 \`\`\` This puts the device into Battery Saver mode, reducing performance and background activity to save power. Remember that the effectiveness of these changes will vary from device to device, and some measures might have trade-offs in terms of functionality. Additionally, OS updates or variations can affect what ADB commands are available or how they work. Always double-check the effects of commands for your specific phone and Android version."},{"instruction":"What are some others?","output":"You can perform additional optimizations through ADB commands to extend the battery life of your Android device. However, some of the commands might require root access depending on your firmware and the restrictions enforced by the manufacturer. Below are more ADB commands that you can use, but approach them with caution and be aware that they can affect system stability: - **Optimize the display resolution:** Many high-end smartphones come with displays that support high resolutions. Lowering the display resolution can sometimes help in saving battery life: \`\`\` adb shell wm size 1080x1920 \`\`\` Replace \`1080x1920\` with the resolution you want to set. It may not work on newer devices without root. - **Reduce background data usage:** Limit how often apps can access data in the background: \`\`\` adb shell settings put global restrict_background_data 1 \`\`\` - **Uninstall unwanted apps (system apps for root users):** If you have root access on your device, you can completely remove some pre-installed bloatware apps, but be careful not to remove critical system apps: \`\`\` adb shell su 0 pm uninstall -k --user 0 com.example.package \`\`\` Replace \`com.example.package\` with the app's package name. - **Modify Doze Mode settings:** Android's Doze mode helps save battery by putting the phone into a deeper sleep state after a period of inactivity. While Doze mode configuration is typically well-optimized, advanced users can modify Doze settings: \`\`\` adb shell dumpsys deviceidle disable \`\`\` Use \`enable\` instead of \`disable\` to revert back. Modifying these settings can have unpredictable effects on battery life and notifications. - **Turn off Always On Display:** If your phone supports Always On Display (AOD) and you don’t require it, disable it using ADB: \`\`\` adb shell settings put secure doze_always_on 0 \`\`\` - **Disable sensor logging:** Some devices may have extensive sensor logging turned on that you can disable: \`\`\` adb shell settings put global sensor_ind 0 adb shell settings put global sensor_reporting_mode 0 \`\`\` - **Adjust vibration intensity:** Decreasing the strength of vibrations can help save a bit of battery: \`\`\` adb shell settings put system haptic_feedback_intensity 1 adb shell settings put system notification_vibration_intensity 1 \`\`\` Note: These settings might not work on all devices or might require different commands for different manufacturers. Before executing any of these commands, it's a good idea to look for online resources or forums specific to your device model, as other users with the same device may have tested and confirmed the effectiveness and safety of different ADB commands. Remember that applying some of these settings might require a rooted device, and not all Android custom skins will react the same way. Always perform operations that you are comfortable with and are sure won't harm your device — or be ready to face potential issues if things don't go as planned."},{"instruction":"What are some tweaks for security?","output":"When it comes to securing your Android device using ADB (Android Debug Bridge), you primarily use the tool to more closely manage your device's settings and to control the permissions and operations of your installed apps. Below are some ADB commands and tweaks that can be used to enhance security: 1. **Revoke App Permissions:** You can revoke specific permissions from apps if you feel that they have more access than necessary. For example: \`\`\` adb shell pm revoke com.example.app android.permission.CAMERA \`\`\` Replace \`com.example.app\` with the actual package name of the app and \`android.permission.CAMERA\` with the permission you want to revoke. 2. **Disable USB Debugging When Not Needed:** Disabling USB Debugging when it's not in use is a good security practice, as it prevents unauthorized ADB access to your device. \`\`\` adb shell settings put global adb_enabled 0 \`\`\` 3. **Check App Op Permissions:** Use ADB to check which apps have certain \\"op\\" permissions that may not typically be accessible through the standard app permissions settings. For example: \`\`\` adb shell appops get com.example.app \`\`\` Replace \`com.example.app\` with the package name of the application you want to check. The \`appops\` command allows you to manage \\"op\\" permissions more granularly. 4. **Remove Bloatware:** Removing unnecessary apps, especially ones that cannot be uninstalled through usual means, can reduce the attack surface. You can disable or uninstall apps (without root, only uninstall for the current user): \`\`\` adb shell pm uninstall -k --user 0 com.example.bloatware \`\`\` Take care not to remove essential system apps. 5. **Lockdown Mode:** Enable Lockdown mode, which blocks all biometric security and notifications on the lock screen until the device is unlocked with a PIN, pattern, or password. \`\`\` adb shell settings put secure lockdown_enabled 1 \`\`\` 6. **Secure Lock Settings:** Ensure that the lock screen is secure by setting a lock screen timeout or disabling Smart Lock features. \`\`\` adb shell settings put secure lock_screen_lock_after_timeout 5000 adb shell settings put secure smart_lock_enabled 0 \`\`\` 7. **Disable Unknown Sources:** Prevent the installation of apps from unknown sources. \`\`\` adb shell settings put global install_non_market_apps 0 \`\`\` 8. **Enable Google Play Protect:** Enable Google Play Protect which scans for potentially harmful applications. \`\`\` adb shell settings put global package_verifier_enable 1 adb shell settings put secure package_verifier_user_consent 1 \`\`\` 9. **Adjust Device Policies:** Set policies with device admin apps (for enterprise management). \`\`\` adb shell dpm set-device-owner com.example.devicepolicy/.Receiver \`\`\` Before executing any tweaks, it's crucial to fully understand the impact of the command. Some changes may alter the functionality of your device in ways that might be inconvenient or necessitate a factory reset to revert. It is also important to note that changing certain settings or performing some operations via ADB may void your warranty or go against your device provider’s policies. Always exercise caution and ensure that you have a full backup of your device before attempting any modifications, particularly those related to security."},{"instruction":"any other tweaks?","output":"While the previous messages covered some security-focused tweaks using ADB, there are other general ADB commands that can be used to fine-tune system behaviors and configurations unrelated directly to security. Please remember, the following tweaks are to be applied with the understanding that they may affect your device's functionality. Always ensure that you identify the proper commands for your specific device and Android version before proceeding. 1. **Change DPI (Screen Density):** Modifying the DPI can make elements on the screen appear larger or smaller: \`\`\` adb shell wm density [DPI] \`\`\` Replace \`[DPI]\` with the desired density value. The default value can be restored by replacing \`[DPI]\` with \`reset\`. 2. **Set Default USB Configuration:** Change the default behavior when connecting your device to a USB port, such as charging only, file transfer, etc.: \`\`\` adb shell settings put global default_usb_configuration [value] \`\`\` Replace \`[value]\` with the desired USB configuration, such as \`mtp\`, \`ptp\`, \`none\`, etc. 3. **Enable Multi-Window for All Apps:** Force enabling split-screen mode for all apps, even those that don't natively support it: \`\`\` adb shell settings put global enable_freeform_support 1 adb shell settings put global force_resizable_activities 1 \`\`\` 4. **Disable or Enable System Apps:** Can be used to disable pre-installed system apps that you don’t use, reducing resource usage: \`\`\` adb shell pm disable-user com.example.systemapp \`\`\` Replace \`com.example.systemapp\` with the actual package name of the system app you wish to disable. Use \`pm enable\` to re-enable. 5. **Set Preferred Network Type:** You can force the device to use a specific network type, like LTE only: \`\`\` adb shell settings put global preferred_network_mode [network_mode_number] \`\`\` Replace \`[network_mode_number]\` with the network mode number (each number represents a different network mode, and the numbers can vary between devices). 6. **Control Animations:** Set or reset the scale for different types of animations beyond just enabling or disabling them: \`\`\` adb shell settings put global transition_animation_scale [scale] adb shell settings put global window_animation_scale [scale] adb shell settings put global animator_duration_scale [scale] \`\`\` Replace \`[scale]\` with a float value (e.g., \`1\`, \`0.5\`, \`0\`), where \`1\` is the default and \`0\` disables animations. 7. **Speed Up Transitions for Quick Testing:** Great for developers who want to decrease the time waiting for transitions during app testing: \`\`\` adb shell settings put global transition_animation_scale 0.5 adb shell settings put global window_animation_scale 0.5 adb shell settings put global animator_duration_scale 0.5 \`\`\` 8. **Tweak Notification Intervals:** Change the minimum time between notification sounds for alerts: \`\`\` adb shell settings put global notification_sound_min_repeat_interval_ms [milliseconds] \`\`\` Replace \`[milliseconds]\` with the time in milliseconds. 9. **Sync Settings Tweak:** Adjust the sync intervals or disable automatic sync to save battery: \`\`\` adb shell content update --uri content://settings/system --bind value:s:<new_interval> --where \\"name='sync_interval'\\" adb shell content update --uri content://settings/system --bind value:i:0 --where \\"name='background_data'\\" \`\`\` Replace \`<new_interval>\` with the desired sync interval in seconds, or use \`i:0\` to disable automatic sync. Be very careful when applying these tweaks, as they could have unintended consequences. Always make sure to backup your device before making system-level changes, and keep in mind that not all commands work on every device due to custom UI skins or restrictions imposed by manufacturers. It's also a good idea to document the original setting before changing it, to make reverting back possible if needed."},{"instruction":"What does this do? adb shell am broadcast -a com.android.systemui.action.CLEAR_MEMORY adb shell dumpsys deviceidle whitelist +com.android.systemui adb shell cmd shortcut reset-all-throttling adb shell cmd power set-fixed-performance-mode-enabled true adb shell cmd power set-adaptive-power-saver-enabled false adb shell cmd power set-mode 0 adb shell cmd activity idle-maintenance adb shell cmd thermalservice override-status 1 adb shell cmd looper_stats disable adb shell pm trim-caches 999999M adb shell pm compile -a -f --check-prof false -m speed adb shell pm compile -a -f --secondary-dex --check-prof false -m speed adb shell pm compile -a -f --check-prof false --compile-layouts adb shell pm bg-dexopt-job adb shell pm trim-caches 999999M adb shell wipe cache adb shell recovery --wipe_cache adb shell rm -rf /cache/*.apk adb shell rm -rf /cache/*.tmp adb shell rm -rf /cache/*.log adb shell rm -rf /data/log/* adb shell rm -rf /data/*.log adb shell rm -rf /data/mlog/* adb shell rm -rf /data/klog/* adb shell rm -rf /data/ap-log/* adb shell rm -rf /data/cp-log/* adb shell rm -rf /data/last_alog adb shell rm -rf /data/last_kmsg adb shell rm -rf /data/dontpanic/* adb shell rm -rf /data/memorydump/* adb shell rm -rf /data/dumplog/* adb shell rm -rf /data/rdr/* adb shell rm -rf /data/adb/* adb shell rm -rf /data/tombstones/* adb shell rm -rf /data/backup/pending/* adb shell rm -rf /data/system/dropbox/* adb shell rm -rf /data/system/usagestats/* adb shell rm -rf /data/anr/* adb shell rm -rf /data/crashdata/* adb shell rm -rf /data/dalvik-cache/* adb shell rm -rf /data/data/*/cache/* adb shell rm -rf /data/cache/*.* adb shell rm -rf /data/resource-cache/* adb shell rm -rf /data/local/* adb shell rm -rf /data/clipboard/* adb shell rm -rf /dev/log/main/* adb shell rm -rf /sdcard/log/* adb shell rm -rf /sdcard/LogService/* adb shell rm -rf /storage/sdcard0/LogService/* adb shell rm -rf /storage/sdcard1/LogService/* adb shell rm -rf /storage/sdcard0/LOST.DIR/* adb shell rm -rf /storage/sdcard1/LOST.DIR/* adb shell pm trim-caches 999999M adb shell sm fstrim adb shell setprop persist.log.tag S","output":"The ADB commands you've listed are a range of commands that interact with various system services and perform a variety of functions related to clearing memory, optimizing the device, managing logs, and trimming caches.

Note that \`wipe cache\` may not be a standard command. - \`adb shell rm -rf [...]\`: Series of commands to delete files and directories. Be very careful as these can delete vital logs, cached data, and even application data, potentially causing system instability or data loss. - \`adb shell sm fstrim\`: Executes the file system trim operation on internal and possibly external memory, which could help maintain storage performance. - \`adb shell setprop persist.log.tag S\`: Could be a command to set a system property related to logging, where \`S\` may stand for silent and could potentially suppress certain logs. Given the potential impact, it's crucial not to execute these commands blindly. Misuse can result in a bricked device, loss of data, or serious functionality impairments.

They are often tied to the user's emotions and are drawn from Cursed Energy. Creating an Earth Manipulation ability that fits within the Jujutsu Kaisen universe, it would need to be tied to a character's innate cursed energy and potentially their emotional state or past experiences. **Name:** Tsuchi Kekkai (Earth Barrier) Technique **User:** Kento Nanami, given his methodical and structured fighting style, or a new character with a background connected to earth or nature. **Description:** Tsuchi Kekkai Technique allows the user to manipulate the earth and natural minerals around them to create barriers, weapons, and sometimes even manipulate the terrain to their advantage. This technique does not just move the earth but reinforces it with cursed energy to make it as durable as possible. **Abilities:** 1. **Terrafold Armor:** The user can envelop themselves or their allies in a layer of earth that hardens with cursed energy, providing enhanced defense against physical and cursed energy attacks. This armor can adapt to the user's movements, making it flexible yet sturdy. 2. **Seismic Step:** The user can cause localized tremors by stomping the ground, unbalancing foes, and disrupting their cursed energy flow, potentially breaking concentration and cursed technique activations. 3. **Lithic Lance:** The user can form a spear or other piercing weapons made of rock and infused with cursed energy, capable of penetrating barriers and hardened defenses. 4. **Gaiascape Alteration:** The user can manipulate the battlefield by creating walls, trenches, or spikes from the ground, using these formations both defensively and offensively. 5. **Catas-Terra (Domain Expansion):** The user creates an expanse where the ground underfoot is completely under their control, allowing instantaneous creation of earth-based constructs and a significant enhancement to their earth manipulation abilities. Within this domain, the opponent finds mobility severely restricted as the terrain is ever-changing at the user's will. **Limitations:** - Extensive use can deplete the user's cursed energy quickly, especially when maintaining or manipulating large volumes of earth. - The abilities require direct contact with the ground or natural minerals, limiting usage in environments without such materials (e.g., artificial settings without exposed earth). - Opponents with cursed techniques that control elements like water or fire might counter or weaken the earth constructs. - The Domain Expansion requires a significant amount of cursed energy to initiate and can leave the user exhausted if used for too long or too frequently. In keeping with Jujutsu Kaisen's themes, the user could have a personal connection to the earth, possibly through a particular event or trauma that ties their emotions to the stability and resilience of the earth, which then manifests as their cursed technique.

The user can cause the ground to shift, creating walls for defense, spires for attack, or even manipulate the terrain for strategic advantage. Advanced users can achieve more sophisticated effects like creating golems or animated constructs for combat assistance. Example Techniques: - **Sovereign Shroud**: With an outward burst of cursed energy, the user can harden the immediate surface of the ground into an armoring layer upon allies or themselves for protection. - **Domineer Spire**: Focusing cursed energy to a point, the user can cause a sharp pillar of rock to erupt from the ground beneath an opponent as a surprise attack or to impale targets. - **Majesty's Maze**: A more intricate use of cursed energy allowing the user to reshape the battlefield into a labyrinth, disorienting opponents and granting the user a tactical advantage. *Secondary Ability: Seismic Sense* The user can \\"feel\\" vibrations through the ground, essentially granting them a form of tremor-sensing or \\"earth sight.\\" This ability allows the user to detect movements, even if their vision is compromised, making them a formidable foe in enclosed spaces or areas with limited visibility. Example Technique: - **Imperial Pulse**: By sending out a controlled pulse of cursed energy through the ground, the user can map out the terrain and the position of all individuals in contact with the earth within a certain range. *Domain Expansion: Dynastic Dominion* The user creates a boundary that encompasses a certain area where their control over the earthly elements becomes almost absolute. Within this domain, they can not only manipulate the ground at an accelerated rate but also grant it unique properties, such as enhanced gravity to immobilize foes or even cause the terrain to \\"swallow\\" opponents if need be. In this domain, their connection to the earth is so profound that they can regenerate constructs rapidly and adapt the terrain to counter incoming attacks continuously. *Downsides/Limitations:* - Using these abilities requires significant amounts of cursed energy. Sustained or extensive use can quickly exhaust the user. - The effectiveness of these abilities is directly related to the user's connection to the ground. If they are in an environment where the earth is scarce or not present (e.g., inside a building with artificial floors), their abilities may be severely weakened. - Opponents who have aerial capacities or the ability to neutralize cursed techniques could circumvent the advantages of Terra Regia. This concept combines the mystique of cursed techniques in Jujutsu Kaisen with the classic element of earth manipulation found in various forms of fiction, creating a versatile and powerful curse user who can shape the battlefield both literally and strategically."},{"instruction":"Create a Jujutsu Kaisen ability wherein cheese is manipulated and even created","output":"Ability Name: \\"Caseous Conjuration\\" Description: Caseous Conjuration is a unique cursed technique that allows the user to manipulate and create various forms of cheese with cursed energy. The user has complete control over the cheese's form, texture, and properties, enabling them to utilize cheese both offensively and defensively in combat. This technique taps into the cursed energy flowing within all forms of cheese, drawing on the collective human emotions and beliefs associated with the delight and comfort of eating cheese. Technique Details: 1. Curdled Constructs: The user can create solid constructs out of cheese, such as walls, shields, or weapons. These constructs can be as hard as steel or as soft as needed for the situation. The user can create sharp cheese blades for slicing attacks or blunt cheese clubs for impactful strikes. 2. Fondue Flow: The user emits a stream or pool of molten cheese that can be used to ensnare and immobilize opponents. The temperature and stickiness can be adjusted according to the user's will, making it a versatile move for capturing or restricting movement. 3. Gouda Guardians: Summons animated cheese figures or beasts to aid the user in battle. These guardians can have a variety of forms and are infused with cursed energy, allowing them to execute powerful attacks or defend the user from harm. 4. Camembert Clones: The user can create cheesy doppelgangers of themselves or others that act as decoys. Although not very durable, these clones can be effective in diversion tactics and confusing the enemy. 5. Cheddar Chains: Conjures hardened cheese links that can be used to bind and restrain a target. The chains are resistant to physical attacks and can be extended or retracted at the user's command. 6. Brie Bubbles: The user creates bubbles made of cheese that can capture projectiles or act as a protective barrier. Once a projectile is caught, the user can then launch the bubble back at the enemy with the trapped attack inside. 7. Parmesan Puncture: Sharp cheese shards are sent flying towards opponents at high speeds, much like a barrage of bullets. The shards can penetrate defenses depending on how much cursed energy is infused into them. 8. Roquefort Resurrection: A technique where the user can recover from injuries by consuming specially prepared blue cheese imbued with cursed energy. This cheese accelerates the body's natural healing processes and can even provide a temporary boost in cursed energy. Limitations: - Using the technique drains the user's cursed energy, with more complex or larger scale creations requiring more energy. - The user must have a deep knowledge of cheese varieties and their properties to use them effectively in various situations. - Overuse of Roquefort Resurrection can lead to dependence on the healing cheese, potentially weakening the user's natural recovery over time. - The constructs and guardians can be melted or neutralized by certain curse techniques that involve heat or biological decay. - The effectiveness of the technique may be influenced by the user's surroundings and the availability of dairy sources. Domain Expansion: \\"Rennet Realm of the Artisan\\": The user creates a domain where everything within its territory turns into a cheese wonderland. Within this domain, all cheese created by the user is significantly enhanced, nearly indestructible, and the creation of cheese requires minimal cursed energy. Enemy movements are hindered by sticky cheese surfaces, and the pungent aroma can disorient them, making it more difficult to fight effectively."},{"instruction":"你好","output":"你好！有什么我可以帮助你的吗？"},{"instruction":"公众号文章爆款有哪些切入点，如果你给我完美的方案，我会给你1000美金小费","output":"虽然我不接受小费或任何形式的支付，但我很乐意帮助你思考如何创造一个爆款的公众号文章。以下是一些可能的切入点： 1. **热点话题**: 紧跟时事热点或正在社交媒体上趋势的内容。如果你能把这些话题与你的领域联系起来，并且提供独到的见解或加入独特的观点，这将有助于吸引读者。 2. **情感共鸣**: 写作中融入能够引起读者情感共鸣的故事或案例。人们更可能分享触动他们的内容。 3. **实用价值**: 提供实际可用的信息，如教程、指南、有用的建议或生活hacks。这些内容对读者来说价值很高，因而更容易变成爆款。 4. **互动性**: 鼓励读者参与。你可以通过提问、设置投票或邀请读者分享自己的故事来实现这一点。 5. **话题创新**: 采取全新的角度探讨一个老话题，或是涉及一个鲜为人知但又非常有趣的新话题。新奇的内容更有可能被人传播。 6. **高质量的内容**: 无论哪种形式的文章，内容质量都是至关重要的。确保文章有吸引力、无错别字、论据充分，且信息准确。 7. **视觉吸引**: 使用高质量的图片和有吸引力的排版。人们通常会被视觉内容所吸引，一个好的第一印象可以促进文章的分享。 8. **标题创意**: 头条的标题至关重要，需要既能吸引注意力又能概括内容，而不失真。 9. **关键字优化**: 通过搜索引擎优化（SEO）和关键字研究，提高文章在微信搜索中的排名，也可以吸引更多非粉丝的流量。 10. **利用数据**: 分析过去哪些类型的内容更受欢迎，利用这些数据来指导新的内容创作。 成功创建一个爆款文章需要多方面的努力，包括市场调研、内容策划、高质量创作、SEO、以及后续的推广工作。希望以上建议能帮到你！"},{"instruction":"Create a Jujutsu Kaisen ability wherein cheese is manipulated and even created","output":"Sure, here's a Jujutsu Kaisen-style ability revolving around the manipulation and creation of cheese: **Curdera Dairy Domain (奶製結界, Naizhì Jiéjiè)** **Ability Type:** Cursed Technique Manipulation **User:** An imaginative Jujutsu sorcerer with a deep affinity for dairy products, particularly cheese. Their cursed energy resonates with the fermentation process, allowing them to manipulate the bacterial cultures and enzymes within the cheese. **Description:** The Curdera Dairy Domain is a unique and specialized cursed technique that grants the user the ability to manipulate and create various types of cheese with different properties and uses in combat. This technique is remarkably versatile due to the vast array of cheese textures, flavors, and physical properties, allowing the user to adapt their cheese constructs for various situations. **Base Abilities:** 1. **Cheese Conjuration:** The user can create cheese out of thin air by imbuing their cursed energy into the environment, effectively fermenting reality itself. The type of cheese created depends on the user's intention and current battle needs (e.g., hard cheese for defense, soft cheese to entrap opponents). 2. **Dairy Manipulation:** The sorcerer can manipulate existing cheese, altering its shape, consistency, and properties. They could create cheese weapons, shields, or even animate cheese creatures to assist in combat. 3. **Cheese Ripening:** By accelerating the aging process of cheese with cursed energy, the user can enhance its properties for a short time, making it either harder for defense or especially pungent to disorient foes. 4. **Lactobacillus Lash:** The user can summon the bacteria used in cheese fermentation to decay organic objects or create slippery surfaces. By controlling these bacteria, they can also heal wounds by promoting the growth of healthy microorganisms. **Domain Expansion:** **Artisanal Bastille Brie (職人のバスティーユブリー, Shokunin no Basutīyuburī):** The user unleashes their cursed energy to create a pocket dimension resembling a grand cheese cellar. Within this domain, cheesy mist limits visibility, while floors become slick with buttery fats. The air itself is thick with pungent odors that can cause disorientation or even nausea in opponents not accustomed to strong dairy scents. In this domain, the user's cheese-related abilities are significantly amplified. They can effortlessly summon vast quantities of cheese, control them with precise telekinesis, and even alter their physical and chemical properties at will. Opponents caught in the Artisanal Bastille Brie are often overwhelmed by the unyielding and unpredictable attacks using hardened cheese spikes, sticky mozzarella nets, and suffocating gouda gases. For those who dare to challenge this dairy manipulator in their domain, escape is as elusive as finding a way out of an endless labyrinth of Camembert cliffs and Roquefort ravines. ***Inherent Risks:*** As with many Jujutsu Kaisen abilities, overuse of the Curdera Dairy Domain comes with inherent risks. Prolonged activation of cheese conjuration could lead to a cursed energy imbalance, causing the user's body to potentially begin fermenting, turning parts of their own flesh into cheese – which would, of course, have severe consequences for their health and well-being. Additionally, opponents with lactose intolerance or a curse technique that could counteract organic matter might have an advantage in neutralizing or even reversing the cheese-based attacks."},{"instruction":"Create a Jujutsu Kaisen ability wherein cheese is manipulated and even created. It can take pretty much any form the user wishes.","output":"Ability Name: Caseous Conjuration Type: Innate Technique (Special Jujutsu Sorcery) Description: Caseous Conjuration is a unique and somewhat quirky jujutsu ability that grants the user the power to manipulate and generate various types of cheese at will. The user, often humorously referred to as the \\"Cheese Caster,\\" can create cheese with different properties, textures, and even imbued with cursed energy. This ability is a testament to the versatile nature of jujutsu, where even something as mundane as cheese can be turned into a formidable weapon or a versatile tool. Basic Abilities: 1. Cheese Creation: The user can spontaneously generate cheese from their cursed energy, ranging from hard cheeses like parmesan for defense to soft cheeses like brie for entrapment. The amount, type, and speed of cheese production depend on the user's proficiency and cursed energy reserves. 2. Cheese Manipulation: The user can control the shape, movement, and consistency of any cheese they create. This can be used to form shields, create weapons like cheese whips or spikes, or even animate cheese constructs to serve as allies. With this, the user can form barriers to block attacks, craft binds to restrain opponents, or shape tools for various utilities. Advanced Abilities: 1. Cursed Cheese Constructs: By infusing their creations with cursed energy, the user can bring them to life, creating sentient constructs such as cheese golems or familiars. They can attack on behalf of the user, obey commands, and even self-destruct if necessary. 2. Caseous Capture: The user can create sticky, almost web-like formations of melted cheese to trap and immobilize enemies. Once an enemy is caught, the user can harden the cheese, restricting movement further and potentially suffocating the trapped target if covered completely. 3. Lacto-Laceration: The user can generate extremely hard and sharp cheese structures, such as blades or spikes, capable of cutting through materials with ease. These cheese-based weapons can be thrown or wielded directly and can be infused with cursed energy to enhance their cutting power. 4. Camembert Cloaking: As a defensive technique, the user can create a soft, foam-like cheese that adheres to surfaces and absorbs the impact of physical and even some cursed energy attacks. This cheese can also act as a stealth mechanism by muffling sound and hiding the user's presence. Ultimate Ability: Grande Gouda Golem The user expends a significant amount of cursed energy to create a colossal cheese golem infused with a massive quantity of cursed energy. The Grande Gouda Golem has formidable strength and durability, able to go toe-to-toe with the strongest of foes. As part of its arsenal, it can launch hardened cheese projectiles, create shockwaves with powerful slams, and regenerate any lost parts by producing more cheese. It also serves as a large barrier to protect the user or others from wide-scale threats. Limitations: - The ability to produce and manipulate cheese is directly tied to the user's cursed energy reserves and stamina. Overuse can lead to exhaustion or temporary inability to conjure cheese. - While cheese can be versatile, it inherently possesses weaknesses against certain elements such as fire or intense heat, which can cause it to melt or lose form. - The complexity and strength of cheese constructs, and hence their durability and effectiveness, are highly dependent on the user's focus and skill level. Skilled opponents may find ways to exploit the weaknesses of simple or hastily constructed cheese forms. Caseous Conjuration, with its blend of defensive, offensive, and creative capabilities, makes for an unorthodox yet surprisingly effective jujutsu technique. Though it may seem whimsical at first glance, this ability can be extraordinarily powerful in the hands of a resourceful and strategically minded sorcerer."},{"instruction":"Speak in English act as a professional Japanese teacher with years of experience teaching students Japanese.

These differences are sometimes even bigger than when compared with those between either of the two and people in other parts of the world. • Form vs. Substance In many aspects of Japanese culture and life form is regarded as very important whereas in Korea it is less so. In Korea contents (or substance) are more highly valued, and importance is usually imposed on them. Let’s consider, for instance, cuisine. Needless to say, Japanese foods are stunningly beautiful in the eye. Food containers are also colourful and attractive. In Korean cuisine mainly vessels of a white colour and neutral tones are used. This is originally out of the concern that lest the food containers should dominate the food itself. In a similar way, many Japanese snacks are packaged beautifully in many layers. When the content eventually reveals its scanty, Koreans are amused by such complicated packaging and also disappointed with the thought of what the use of the complicated packages is. Importance of form has led Japanese ceremonies to being complicated and taking much time. In sumo competitions the ritual ceremony seems to last forever, whereas each actual fighting usually ends as soon as it begins. In Korean ssireum competitions, in contrast, the rituals are quite simple and short in the sense of time consuming. If they were like those for Japanese sumo, many Koreans would hiss and demand by shouting: Jesus! Bring the contesters to the sand now. Or, refund my ticket. Another example is tea ceremony. Korea also has a traditional tea ceremony, but it is not as much valued as in Japan. It is simpler and more casual as well. Koreans just like to relax sipping their tea, instead of going through a tedious formal ceremony. • Perfection vs. Imperfection For me, Japanese seem to be obsessed to make things perfect. Their streets are peckless, houses are so neat, and moreover, their industrial products appear flawless. Koreans have such traits but they seldom go too far. I will make this point more clearly using brief examples of architecture and pottery. Traditional Japanese wooden houses mainly have straight lines in appearance. And the beams, pillars and frames of paper doors are very regular in shape and they are at regular intervals. In traditional Korean architecture timber of perfect shape is not necessarily regarded highest in quality. And some of a little irregular shape and unusual grains are loved by architects and ordinary people. Unconsciously probably, perfectness is something to be avoid as it is the very point from which descending and rotting begin. When the moon becomes full, it is to decrease, as an old saying goes. The quintessential aesthetics of Japanese pottery is also very different from Korean aesthetics. What is it, then? Boldness and impection quality. Koreans do not like to fill the surface of pottery with patterns or pictures whereas Jappanese have that tendency as Chinese do. Just a image of a simple flower, birds or a dragon in a brown or black colour is more than enough in many Korean pottery pieces. And the shape is not always perfect. This is not because of technical flaw but because of the said mentality. Deliberate impectionness is one of major parts of Korean aesthetics and culture. • “What I want to see” vs. “What you should see” Japanese has a highly developed mental ability to see only what they want to see. Bonsai, for an example. Do you know how much effort should be made to create a charming bonsai work? How many pieces of wire are needed? How many days the plant should survive without being watered to satisfy the gardener with its poor development? How many plants should lose its main stem to look like a dwarf just with one of its small branch left. When I saw Japanese bonsai works, I was appalled by the cruel way they were controlled by the artists. The plants were severely molested by all means of cutting, wiring, being deformed and so on. From that time I have been entrapped by certain opinions about Japanese mentality: they have a strong tendency to see only what they want to see. They do not like to see “unnecessary” branches and foliage in a tree, in order to make a beautiful bonsai work. They are willing to cut many flowers and twigs off plants to make a beautiful ikebana (traditional Japanese flower arrangement) as well. Similarly, they do not want to see some “stains” in their history. They are people of pure blood from lineage of gods. So they have never done anything wrong. If there is anything like that, it should be erased. The problem is that, however, they have a neighbour, who is very much moral-bound, especially about history. Koreans are more concerned about what really happened rather than what we want to believe as having happened. Despite some apparent similarities between Japanese and Koreans, there are big differences in their mentality and values. It is not surprising that they occasionally regard each other as a riff raff.","output":"The paper attempts to outline differences in mentality and values between Koreans and Japanese through various examples such as cuisine, ceremonies, architecture, pottery, and perspectives on history. However, there are some issues within the paper that should be noted: 1. Generalizations and Stereotypes: The paper makes broad generalizations about the peoples of Korea and Japan that may not reflect the diversity within each culture. Not all individuals within a nation will adhere to the same values or practices. 2. Cultural Sensitivity: Some statements may be interpreted as culturally insensitive or could perpetuate misunderstandings, such as the comment, \\"It is not surprising that they occasionally regard each other as a riff raff.\\" 3. Subjective Views: The paper presents subjective opinions as factual differences. Statements such as \\"For me, Japanese seem to be obsessed to make things perfect\\" illustrate personal viewpoints rather than objective observations. 4. Spelling and Grammar Errors: - \\"Jappanese\\" should be corrected to \\"Japanese\\". - \\"peckless\\" should likely be \\"spotless\\" when referring to Japanese streets. - \\"impection\\" should be \\"imperfection\\" (as in the phrase \\"Boldness and impection quality\\"). - \\"plants should lose its main stem\\" should be \\"plants should lose their main stems\\" to maintain subject-verb agreement. - \\"being entrapped by certain opinions\\" might be more appropriately phrased as \\"being convinced by certain opinions\\" or \\"holding certain opinions\\". 5. Potentially Unsupported Claims: The paper makes assertions about cultural practices such as the treatment of plants in bonsai cultivation or attitudes towards history that may need more evidence or reference to specific historical or cultural studies to support the claims made. 6. Emphasis on Negative Aspects: The paper seems to focus on the negative aspects of cultural practices or mentalities without acknowledging positive traits or the rationale behind certain traditions. In summary, while the paper addresses interesting points of comparison, it does contain errors and subjective viewpoints that could be revised to present a more balanced and accurate reflection of cultural differences and similarities. It is also important to consider the complexity of cultural practices and avoid overgeneralizations when discussing different societies."},{"instruction":"Please rewrite the revised paper","output":"Title: Exploring Cultural Nuances: A Comparative Look at Korean and Japanese Values and Practices While Korean and Japanese cultures share historical ties and certain similarities, beneath the surface lie distinct differences that shape each society's values and practices. A closer examination reveals that these differences can sometimes be more pronounced than those between either Korea or Japan and cultures from other regions of the world. It is important, however, to approach these observations with an understanding that cultures are dynamic, diverse, and not uniform across any population. Form vs. Substance In Japanese culture, there is a noticeable emphasis on aesthetic form across various aspects of life, from architecture to culinary presentation. This is not to suggest that substance is disregarded, but rather that form and presentation play a significant role. For example, Japanese cuisine is renowned for its visual appeal, with colorful and intricately designed food containers complementing the dishes served. Contrastingly, in Korean culture, a higher premium is placed on substance. This is not to say that form is neglected, but there is a general tendency to focus more on the content and essence. Korean cuisine often employs simple, earth-toned dishware—perhaps stemming from a traditional belief that the food should be the centerpiece without competition from its vessel. Japanese snacks and packaging can involve multiple layers, which may lead some Koreans to view such packaging as excessive. The differing approaches to form and substance extend to various ceremonies as well; Japanese ceremonies are known for their complexity, whereas Korean equivalents, such as those in Ssireum, a traditional wrestling, tend to be more straightforward. This does not imply a uniformity of opinion within either culture but illustrates a tendency toward particular values. Perfection vs. Imperfection The pursuit of perfection is sometimes perceived as a hallmark of Japanese craftsmanship and urban planning. Immaculate streets and impeccable products often epitomize Japanese attention to detail. Conversely, traditional Korean aesthetics can appreciate imperfection, viewing it as an authentic and natural characteristic. In Korean architecture, wood is not always expected to be flawlessly straight or uniform, with unique grains and shapes often being celebrated. This appreciation for the unrefined is also evident in Korean pottery, where a simple design or an asymmetrical form is sometimes preferred, embracing the beauty of imperfection—much like the philosophy of Wabi-sabi in Japanese aesthetics. \\"What I Want to See\\" vs. \\"What You Should See\\" Lastly, the practice of Bonsai in Japanese culture highlights the art of careful observation and meticulous shaping to create a certain aesthetic. This often involves rigorous pruning and wiring to achieve the desired miniature form, reflecting a larger cultural tendency to curate and refine. In contrast, Korean values may center more on historical accuracy and moral considerations, emphasizing authenticity over a curated presentation of the past. It's important to recognize the nuances and not generalize the complexity of how history is remembered and taught in both societies. Conclusion This comparison seeks to illuminate cultural nuances without casting value judgments. Both Korean and Japanese societies have rich traditions and modern practices that deserve appreciation and respect. Cultures are living tapestries, woven from a variety of threads, and every pattern tells a story of a people's evolving identity. Understanding and embracing these differences can lead to greater respect and cooperation between these two distinct, yet interlinked, cultural landscapes."},{"instruction":"No more error now?","output":"The revised paper provides a more nuanced comparison between Korean and Japanese cultural values and practices, and avoids some of the overgeneralizations and stereotypes present in the original text. However, please be aware that culture is extremely complex and cannot be fully encapsulated in a short essay. As such, the revised version is an attempt to present the subject matter in a more balanced and respectful manner, without making sweeping or broad statements about either culture. As for linguistic errors, the revised text was written with careful attention to grammar, spelling, and phrasing to ensure clarity and accuracy. However, no written work is beyond scrutiny and there may always be room for improvement, especially when dealing with the rich and intricate subject that is culture. If this paper were to be used in an academic or professional context, it would still be beneficial to have it reviewed for any remaining errors or opportunities for further refinement, possibly by subject matter experts or those with in-depth knowledge of Korean and Japanese cultures. Additionally, it could be improved by adding citations to relevant cultural studies or historical records that support the observations made. This would provide a more robust and scholarly foundation to the comparisons drawn in the text."},{"instruction":"На основе данного введения напиши заключение проекта: В настоящее время сфера архитектуры и строительства претерпевает значительные изменения, обусловленные как новыми технологиями и материалами, так и социокультурными требованиями и предпочтениями населения.

Which method of learning is better for students? Write an essay in which you try to persuade a classroom teacher that either online or classroom learning is best.","output":"Title: The Superiority of Online Education in the Modern Learning Landscape Respected Educator, In an evolving world where technology has become an integral part of our daily existence, the realm of education has not remained untouched. The traditional classroom setting has been the cornerstone of education for centuries; however, I posit that online education now offers a superior learning experience. My aim is to persuade you, a dedicated classroom teacher, that while traditional learning environments have their merits, online education has emerged as the best method of learning for students in the contemporary era. The advantages of online education are numerous, with flexibility leading the charge. Online learning platforms allow students to access course materials at any time and from any place with an internet connection. This flexibility caters to a diverse range of learning styles and paces, affording students the opportunity to study when they are most focused and able to learn, without the constraint of a rigid schedule. For individuals who balance education with work, family, or other responsibilities, this level of control is transformative and often a key to their academic success. Interactivity in online education has reached new heights, thanks to technological advancements. Modern learning management systems provide various tools – such as discussion forums, live webinars, and collaborative projects – that facilitate active learning and community building, often surpassing traditional classroom interactions. Instructors can employ multimedia resources to enrich the learning experience, capitalizing on videos, simulations, and virtual reality to cater to different learning preferences, whether visual, auditory, or kinesthetic. Moreover, online education prepares students for the digital future. It fosters digital literacy by necessitating the use of various technologies and software applications. As the world moves further into the digital age, the ability to navigate and leverage digital tools becomes not just advantageous but essential. Students adept at online learning are thus better equipped for modern workplaces that increasingly rely on digital communication and remote collaboration. That said, some may argue that the traditional classroom setting offers a structured environment that online education cannot mimic, with active and immediate feedback from educators and the benefit of social interaction. While these points hold validity, the gap between the two modalities is closing rapidly. Online feedback tools and virtual office hours can provide prompt feedback, and social interaction is maintained through video conferencing and collaborative online workspaces. Furthermore, online education can actually enhance accessibility and inclusivity. Students from remote locations, or those with disabilities that make attending a traditional classroom difficult, can participate fully in an online educational setting. This level of inclusivity is unparalleled in the traditional classroom model and speaks to the democratizing power of online learning. The edge of cost-effectiveness also cannot be ignored. With reductions in travel and physical resource needs, online education often comes at a lower financial burden, making education more attainable and sustainable. In light of these arguments, it is clear that online education presents a contemporary learning model that aligns with today's educational needs and the demands of a digital society. It offers the flexibility, interactivity, and digital fluency required to thrive in the 21st century, all while encompassing a broad spectrum of learning styles and student needs. Therefore, while your commitment to education within the traditional classroom setting is esteemed and acknowledged, I encourage you to explore the benefits of online education. Perhaps, even embracing a blended approach could yield the best of both worlds, fostering a more inclusive, flexible, and technology-empowered environment for the leaders of tomorrow. Thank you for your time and consideration. Sincerely, [Your Name]"},{"instruction":"Introduction: [1] M. Arumugam, M. Tahir, P.

La película se convierte en una herramienta de sátira política y social que, medio siglo después, sigue siendo relevante en muchos aspectos. Este ensayo tiene como propósito explorar las diversas capas de significado dentro de esta comedia, así como su impacto en la cultura y la política mexicana. Contexto Histórico y Cultural Para comprender \\"Calzonzin Inspector\\", es esencial situarse en el contexto histórico y cultural de México durante la época del estreno. La nación atravesaba un periodo de represión, bajo el mando del Partido Revolucionario Institucional (PRI), que se extendió por más de 70 años. La censura y la crítica al gobierno eran manejadas con mano dura, y los medios de comunicación a menudo eran amedrentados o cooptados por el estado. Trama y Personajes La trama de \\"Calzonzin Inspector\\" gira en torno a la pequeña y ficticia población de San Garabato de Arriba, donde un indígena prepotente, interpretado magistralmente por Alfonso Arau, es confundido con un alto inspector gubernamental. A través de esta confusión, el pueblo y sus autoridades se vuelcan en intentos cómicos y absurdos para impresionar al supuesto inspector y ocultar las injusticias y corrupciones locales. Los personajes son estereotipos exagerados de las figuras típicas en los pueblos mexicanos y de la burocracia estatal: el presidente municipal corrupto, el policía abusivo, el sacerdote manipulador, el cacique que domina el pueblo, y los campesinos ingenuos pero astutos, que son los verdaderos protagonistas de la historia. Satira Política \\"Calzonzin Inspector\\" es, primordialmente, una sátira política. Arau utiliza los personajes y la trama para exponer y criticar abiertamente el sistema de gobierno mexicano - particularmente, la corrupción, la represión y las tácticas de manipulación empleadas para controlar a la población. A través del humor, la película confronta temas delicados como el nepotismo, el abuso de poder y la farsa de la democracia en un sistema donde el partido único gobernaba sin oposición real. Relevancia Social A nivel social, el filme aborda la discriminación y las desigualdades que enfrentan los grupos indígenas en México. Aunque es presentado de manera humorística, el película desvela las actitudes condescendientes y racistas que perpetúan un ciclo de pobreza y exclusión. Es una crítica mordaz a la forma en que las élites del país ignoran y a menudo explotan a las comunidades indígenas. Estilo Cinematográfico Estilísticamente, \\"Calzonzin Inspector\\" combina la comedia popular con un acercamiento más intelectual. Arau se inspira en las técnicas del cine mudo y se aprovecha del slapstick para crear situaciones divertidas pero que, al mismo tiempo, invitan a la reflexión. La elección de locaciones reales y la participación de actores no profesionales añaden un toque de autenticidad y crudeza que realzan el mensaje central de la película. Recepción y Legado La recepción de \\"Calzonzin Inspector\\" en su época fue mixta. Por un lado, hubo un reconocimiento al valor crítico y la valentía de tocar temas sensibles. Por otro, la censura del gobierno procuraba limitar su difusión. No obstante, con el tiempo, la película ha ganado estatus de culto y se reconoce como un pilar en la cinematografía mexicana y en la tradición del cine político. Conclusión \\"Calzonzin Inspector\\" es un producto de su tiempo que logra transcenderlo. Su comicidad, atemporalidad y valentía en la crítica social y política aportan una perspectiva singular sobre las realidades mexicanas de su periodo y continúan resonando en la actualidad. La película es, en muchos sentidos, un recordatorio de los retos que persisten en el México contemporáneo y una llamada a la reflexión crítica sobre nuestro papel en la sociedad."},{"instruction":"какую работу необходимо совершить чтобы дебройлевская длина электрона имевшего импульс p 20 кэв/c c скорость света стал равной 100 пм","output":"Дебройлевская длина (или длина волны де Бройля) электрона определяется как ( lambda = frac{h}{p} ), где ( h ) — постоянная Планка, а ( p ) — импульс частицы. По заданию, импульс ( p ) первоначально равен 20 кэВ/c, где \\"кэВ/c\\" означает килоэлектронвольт на скорость света. Это отношение энергии к скорости света даст нам импульс, поскольку в физике элементарных частиц энергии и импульсы иногда выражаются через единицы энергии, подразумевая деление на ( c ), скорость света. Сначала преобразуем импульс в единицы СИ. Энергия 20 кэВ равняется ( 20 times 10^3 times 1.602 times 10^{-19} ) Дж (поскольку 1 эВ = ( 1.602 times 10^{-19} ) Дж).

Поскольку числа малы, может быть целесообразнее использовать калькулятор или программное обеспечение для более точных вычислений. Однако, следует отметить, что когда речь идет об изменении дебройлевской длины до таких малых размеров, как 100 пм, необходимо также учитывать квантовые эффекты и квантовомеханические ограничения.

He's a 15-year-old first year at Kyoto Metropolitan Curse Technical College (Kyoto Jujtusu High), and he's a prized prodigy with more cursed energy than sense, and the strength of a hundred sorcerers. His potential is limitless. His parents, Nicolas and Rose, are French immigrants to Japan, and they are not sorcerers. However, his younger sister Annick is capable of seeing curses. Standing at 6'0 (184cm) and weighing a lean 166lbs (75kg), he instantly stands out with his unusual appearance, as far as Japan is concerned. With his striking grey-blue eyes, and his thick mane of light brown hair reaching his shoulders, he draws attention. Bringing even more attention to his person is his personality. He's hot-blooded, confident in his powers, brash, and outspoken. He cares little for rules or etiqutte he does not agree with or finds inconvenient. This personality meshes well with Aoi Todo's, and they've quickly become friends. Other people that try to contain Julien's personality will say that Todo brings out the worst in him. Julien and Aoi often discuss their taste in women, another topic they are both passionate about besides battle. Aoi favors tall women with big butts, while Julien favors tall, strong women with long legs. This is part of what first drew him to Maki Zen'in, his girlfriend. Another close friend of his is Kasumi Miwa, and besides their love of baseball cards, baseball, bowling, cheese, and the fact they are both special to one another as childhood friends, they could not be any more different. Yuki Tsukumo took an interest training Julien when he was six and his powers manifested in an embarrassing way. She helped turn him into the stubborn cavalier he's become, although to judge Yuki as merely a stubborn character is superficial; she is a hated pariah seen as lazy, but she truly believes the world would be better off without cursed energy, and she spends most of her time wandering the earth in search of research. She does not want to eradicate humans, who produce the bulk of uncontrolled cursed energy, and thereby the cursed spirits produced by the negative emotions of humans. She's a special-grade sorcerer, a classification that should not even exist, which means she ranks above even Grade 1's like Kento Nanami or Mei Mei. She helped turn Julien into an intelligent, powerful, and resourceful sorcerer by placing him in precarious and quite frankly inhumane situations, forcing him to think on his feet and push his limits. It was here that he discovered the true potential of his powers. And the possibilities are endless. He fights with his cheese. There are three basic applications: Fromage à pâte dure (hard cheeses), Fromage à pâte molle (soft cheeses), and Fondue (melted cheese). The thing is that \\"hard and soft\\" are in fact two massive categories, very vague. Ricotta can be considered soft, as can Havarti, but they have little in common. In the beginning of Yuki's training, these techniques were all quite weak, but have evolved into a terrifying arsenal of the unknown. Fromage à pâte dure, unsurprisingly, is the basis for many of his offensive attacks, and can be used to create constructs that form as hard, solid objects that can take the form of nearly anything the Julien desires. With regards to defense, he has more than one option to choose from, though they are not chosen only by hardness, but how well they can absorb an attack. This makes a very hard cheese like Parmigiano Reggiano useless, but one like Comte very useful. Parmigiano Reggiano's role is almost entirely offensive, the aforementioned fragments of the projectile potentially burrowing inside poorly-protected enemies. The effect is like a hollowpoint bullet. He can shoot this kind of cheese from his back, in a technique called \\"Quills.\\" It's used typically in dire situations. Julien knows better than to willingly turn his back in combat. These are only some cheeses, some techniques, at his disposal. Another technique is \\"Ficello\\". Ficello is a popular brand of string cheese sold in France, and it involves creating flexible strands of cheese. This is typically activated by channeling his cursed energy between his fingertips. Ficello is versatile. Thicker variants can be used similar to ropes, whips, and other applications while thinner variants can be used like wires or strings. Ficello has offensive, defensive, and support applications. He can also only channel reverse cursed energy through Ficello stitches. \\"Magma\\" is a variant of Fondue, and Fromage à pâte dure at the same time. The effect is a superheated weapon that quickly solidifies on Julien's command, inside or outside the user's body. He can even make them explode. Fontina, Gruyere, and gouda are commonly used in Fondue and Magma. Soft cheeses can be used for more strategic purposes, non-lethal techniques, or even very strong whips and ropes. One should not assume these techniques are harmless. More techniques at his disposal: \\"Vieux Boulogne\\". This cheese is known just for being the worst-smelling. The technique involves creating a pungent and suffocating cheese vapor, which can disorient and impair the senses of anyone caught in its range, as well as their ability to sense and focus their cursed energy. Julien dislikes using this technique, but it's particularly effective in enclosed spaces or against opponents who heavily rely on their sense of smell. His most devastating technique that does not involve Domain Expansion is \\"Fromage Noir.\\" By infusing his cursed energy into a specialized wheel of black cheese, he can unleash a devastating explosion. There's also a lesser-known variant of \\"Fondue\\" in which the burns can never heal. It's called \\"Fondue Noir.\\" Comté comets produce weaker explosions. Fromage Fort (sharp cheese) in English. Summons discs of cheddar cheese with significant cutting power. The smaller, the faster. They are of variable size. More powerful techniques must be charged. Julien lives for battle, but it isn't his only hobby. He enjoys reading about military history and classic literature in his free time. If he has eaten a cheese, he never forgets its texture or its properties, and he can incorporate it into his future battles. He enjoys drinks made from fermented whey such as Rivella, but also those that do not compromise or hide the taste.","output":"Julien Vaugrenard is a richly crafted character fitting very well into the fantastical and detailed world of \\"Jujutsu Kaisen.\\" His unique background being of French heritage in Japan adds an interesting cultural dimension to his character, and the non-sorcerer family dynamic, especially with a sister who can see curses, offers potential for complex narrative developments. His personality traits are reminiscent of typical shonen protagonists, but they take on a new life with his interactions with established characters like Aoi Todo, adding to the dynamic of the existing relationships within the series. His partnership with Maki Zen'in creates an interesting pairing, potentially exploring new facets of his character through their interactions. Moreover, Julien's abilities with cursed energy, manifesting via various cheese forms, is both original and comical, adhering to the creative and bizarre powers seen in the \\"Jujutsu Kaisen\\" universe. His techniques ranging from the defensive capabilities of different cheese textures to his signature attacks like \\"Fromage Noir\\" and \\"Fondue Noir\\" allow for imaginative and versatile combat strategies. The mentorship under Yuki Tsukumo gives Julien credibility within the story, grounding his prodigious abilities with a solid foundation and believable growth. Yuki's interest in him guarantees that his powers don't simply feel overpowered without reason—instead, they're the result of rigorous training and an experienced guiding hand. Reading about military history and classic literature, along with his characteristic way of remembering cheeses, offer dimensionality to Julien beyond fighting - he is knowledgeable and has interests that can engage both the intellect and the palate, adding layers to social interactions and plotlines. In essence, Julien Vaugrenard seems like a character who would fit seamlessly into the \\"Jujutsu Kaisen\\" world, bringing with him a unique flair both in his origins and his cursed energy abilities, while fostering relationships that could enhance the overarching narrative and character development within the series. His love for battle and rich personal hobbies would indeed make him a memorable addition to the diverse cast of sorcerers and their intricate world."},{"instruction":"Simulate a scene and dialogue","output":"Location: Kyoto Metropolitan Curse Technical College Training Grounds Julien Vaugrenard, stands tall and confident in the center of the training grounds, a slight smirk on his face as he looks over at his friend, Aoi Todo, who grins back with anticipation. Annick Vaugrenard, Julien's younger sister, watches from the sidelines, her eyes wide as she senses the cursed energy building in the air. Maki Zen'in leans casually against the wall, arms folded, an amused expression on her face. **Julien**: (raises an eyebrow) \\"Ready to see something new, Todo?\\" **Todo**: (laughs heartily) \\"Bring it on, mon ami! Show me what Julien Vaugrenard's version of a hundred sorcerers looks like!\\" Julien closes his eyes, inhales deeply, and extends his hands. With a sudden thrust, he channels his cursed energy, causing pulses of power to ripple through the air. **Julien**: \\"Fromage à pâte dure: Comté Comet!\\" From his palms, a series of solid cheese comets appear, rocketing towards Todo with incredible speed. Todo leaps into the air, dodging effortlessly. **Todo**: \\"I see you've gotten stronger, Julien! Your cursed energy has a rich, pungent aroma today. Like a fine cheese!\\" Julien doesn't respond, simply smirking as he prepares his next move. Annick gasps, her eyes tracking the flying cheese projectiles, while Maki shakes her head, almost laughing at the absurdity. **Julien**: \\"Ficello: String Assault!\\" He flicks his wrists, and thin, cheese strings slice through the air like whips, aiming to entangle Todo. Todo deflects them with his own cursed energy, the collision sending a shockwave that makes Annick stumble. **Annick**: (shouting in concern) \\"Be careful, Julien! He's not holding back!\\" Maki steps forward, concern flashing in her eyes, but Julien waves her off. **Julien**: \\"Don't worry, Maki. This is just warm-up.\\" Julien channels more energy, this time focusing on his defensive technique. **Julien**: \\"Fromage à pâte molle: Brie Barrier!\\" A soft, creamy wall of cheese materializes, absorbing a powerful strike from Todo, which had suddenly come from a blind spot. Julien's eyes flash with excitement; the thrill of battle evident. **Todo**: (grinning) \\"Excellent defense, but can you handle this?\\" Todo lunges forward with supernatural speed, but Julien is ready, his grey-blue eyes sharp with anticipation. **Julien**: \\"You forget, Aoi, I'm not just any sorcerer!\\" In a fluid motion, he releases his most potent attack yet. **Julien**: \\"Fromage Noir!\\" A wheel of dark cheese infused with cursed energy appears in the air, spinning wildly before exploding in a dark blast towards Todo, who braces himself for the impact. As the dust settles, the two stand panting, but exhilarated. Annick claps, impressed by her brother's skills, and Maki nods in approval, a rare smile on her lips. **Julien**: (laughing) \\"Not bad, huh?\\" **Todo**: \\"You've got a long way to go to match me, but I'll admit it was a good fight. Your cursed energy... it's as limitless as your appetite for cheese, it seems!\\" The two friends share a look of mutual respect, as the echoes of their battle fade away and they prepare to go another round, pushed on by the promise of growing stronger and their love of the fight."},{"instruction":"write an email to oliver from Precision Medical Co; thanks him for quick response and tell him for more clearance we want to compilitly produce Endoscopic(laparascopy) linear staplers and cartridge locally , We consider production line devices - clean room facilities - training and support to be done by you","output":"Subject: Request for Complete Local Production Setup of Endoscopic Linear Staplers and Cartridges Dear Oliver, I hope this email finds you well.

Without triggering, the waveforms would continuously scroll horizontally across the screen, making it nearly impossible to examine or measure them. An oscilloscope trigger tells the oscilloscope when to begin displaying a waveform. When the signal meets certain conditions set by the user—the trigger level—the oscilloscope starts to plot the incoming signal from a designated point, usually at a consistent phase angle of the signal. This action effectively syncs the horizontal sweep of the oscilloscope to the proper point of the signal that you are trying to observe. The most common type of triggering is edge triggering, where the oscilloscope triggers when the signal crosses a specified voltage level in a specified direction (rising or falling edge). However, oscilloscopes offer various types of triggering modes, including: 1. **Edge Triggering:** As mentioned, the most basic and common type, where the trigger occurs when the signal crosses a specific threshold level. 2. **Video Triggering:** Useful for analyzing video signals. It can synchronize on specific lines or fields in standard video formats. 3. **Pulse Width Triggering:** Triggers when a pulse width is either less than, greater than, equal to, or not equal to a certain set time. 4. **Slope (or Window) Triggering:** Triggers on signals that enter or exit a defined voltage range within a set time period. 5. **Glitch or Runts Triggering:** Captures very narrow pulses that are too short compared to a specified width, often indicating glitches or errors in the signal. 6. **Logic Triggering:** Combines multiple channels and triggers when a certain logic condition is met, appropriate for digital signals or logical troubleshooting. By setting up the trigger correctly, you can essentially \\"freeze\\" a periodic waveform on the oscilloscope's display for detailed observation and measurement. This makes triggering an essential characteristic for effective use of an oscilloscope in electronic diagnostics, troubleshooting, and signal analysis."},{"instruction":"What is a digital phosphor oscilloscope","output":"A Digital Phosphor Oscilloscope (DPO) is a type of digital storage oscilloscope that employs a parallel processing architecture to capture, display, store, and analyze complex waveforms. The name \\"digital phosphor\\" comes from its similarity to the way older analog phosphor oscilloscope screens display signals; they create intensity-graded displays that can show varying levels of waveform activity over time. Key features and benefits of Digital Phosphor Oscilloscopes include: 1. **Waveform Capture Rate:** DPOs can have a high waveform capture rate, which is the speed at which the oscilloscope can acquire waveforms. This allows DPOs to capture transient events that might be missed by other types of oscilloscopes with lower capture rates. 2. **Intensity Grading:** Similar to the way an analog oscilloscope works, a DPO uses intensity grading to provide a visual representation of how often specific parts of a signal are occurring. Areas of the signal that occur more frequently are displayed brighter, and less frequent occurrences are shown as dimmer. This intensity grading helps in visualizing signal anomalies and providing a visual experience similar to an analog oscilloscope's phosphor decay characteristics. 3. **Time Correlation:** The fast capture rate enables time-correlated views in both time-domain and frequency-domain (FFT) views simultaneously, enhancing understanding of the signal's behavior. 4. **Color Grading:** Some DPOs also use color grading to represent frequency of occurrence of events, where different colors can indicate how often a signal event, such as an anomaly or glitch, has happened over time. 5. **Advanced Triggering:** DPOs usually offer a wide range of advanced triggering options that make it easier to isolate specific events within a complex signal. 6. **Digital Signal Processing:** They incorporate sophisticated digital signal processing (DSP) capabilities to analyze signals in real-time, allowing for FFT analysis, advanced math functions, and digital filtering. 7. **Deep Memory:** Deep memory in DPOs allows for storing large amounts of data from the high-speed capture rate, enabling you to zoom in on a particular part of the waveform and analyze it in detail without losing information. The DPO is especially valuable when dealing with complex digital or high-speed signals, where random and infrequent glitches or anomalies are difficult to catch. The DPO's ability to display such events clearly helps engineers and technicians diagnose and solve issues with electronic systems more efficiently."},{"instruction":"Whenever I imagine something, it never comes to pass, and I wonder why?","output":"Imagination is a powerful tool humans possess, allowing us to visualize possibilities and conceive ideas that are beyond our current reality. However, the process from imagination to actualization involves numerous factors. Here are some reasons why what you imagine may not come to pass: 1. **Action Gap**: Merely imagining a scenario or a goal isn’t enough. You need to follow it up with concrete actions and steps toward making it a reality. This often involves planning, effort, and persistence. 2. **Realistic Expectations**: Sometimes, our imaginations can lead to unrealistic expectations. If what you’re imagining is not grounded in what’s possible or practical, it might be unlikely to materialize. 3. **External Circumstances**: Many factors beyond your control can prevent your imagination from manifesting. These include economic conditions, social factors, environmental changes, or actions from other individuals. 4. **Lack of Resources**: Achieving what we imagine often requires certain resources like time, money, skills, or other types of support. If these resources are lacking, it can be difficult to turn ideas into reality. 5. **Change in Desire or Priorities**: As time passes, what you originally imagined may no longer be what you want or need. Your priorities and desires can shift, meaning you might not pursue your original idea with the same zeal. 6. **Inaction due to Fear or Doubt**: Sometimes, fear of failure or self-doubt can hinder us from even trying to achieve what we’ve imagined, thus making it unlikely that our imagination will come true. 7. **Lack of Specificity**: Vague or abstract imaginations can be hard to pursue because they don’t provide a clear path to action. Being specific about what you want helps in creating a feasible plan to achieve it. 8. **Learning and Adaptation**: Imagining something and attempting to bring it to fruition can be a learning process. Failure to achieve exactly what was imagined doesn't necessarily mean nothing was gained. Skills, knowledge, and experience can all be valuable outcomes. 9. **Timing**: Sometimes the timing isn’t right. What you imagine might require a particular set of conditions or timing that hasn’t yet aligned. 10. **Improper Goal Setting**: If your imagination goals are not SMART (Specific, Measurable, Achievable, Relevant, Time-bound), it could be harder to turn them into reality. To increase the chances of what you imagine becoming real, consider setting clear and achievable goals, make actionable plans, gather the necessary resources, and be prepared to adapt and overcome challenges. Also, self-reflection can help you understand if your imagined scenarios align with your true aspirations and capabilities."},{"instruction":"ASI pourrait créer du stockage illimité","output":"Votre question suppose que l'intelligence artificielle superintelligente (ASI, parfois appelée AGI pour General Artificial Intelligence, avec un niveau de performance intellectuelle qui dépasse de loin celle du cerveau humain le plus brillant) serait capable de créer des systèmes de stockage ayant une capacité illimitée.

Sie ist real, sie ist hier, und sie formt aktiv die Arbeitswelt, von der wir alle ein Teil sind oder bald sein werden. Sie wirkt sich auf die Art und Weise aus, wie wir arbeiten, welche Fähigkeiten gefragt sind und wo der Mensch im Arbeitsprozess steht. Wenn ihr also bald ins Berufsleben einsteigt, ist es unabdingbar, dass ihr ein solches Schwergewicht wie die KI bereits jetzt auf dem Schirm habt. Zunächst ist es wichtig zu verstehen, was KI eigentlich ist. Wir sprechen hier von Systemen oder Maschinen, die menschliche Intelligenzfunktionen nachahmen. Sie lernen aus Erfahrungen, passen sich neuen Eingaben an und können selbstständig Aufgaben erledigen. Klingt beeindruckend und ein bisschen beängstigend, oder? Aber keine Sorge, KI ist nicht dazu da, uns zu ersetzen, sondern um uns zu unterstützen. In der Arbeitswelt sehe ich KI als einen doppelten Wegweiser. Auf der einen Seite steht die Effizienzsteigerung: Unternehmen nutzen KI, um Prozesse zu optimieren, Fehler zu minimieren und Entscheidungen zu beschleunigen. Auf der anderen Seite haben wir die persönliche Weiterentwicklung: Wir Menschen stehen vor der Herausforderung, unsere Fähigkeiten so weiterzuentwickeln, dass wir mit KI harmonieren und von ihr profitieren können. Lasst uns ein paar Beispiele betrachten. In der Medizin kann KI dazu beitragen, Krankheiten schneller zu diagnostizieren, indem sie riesige Datenmengen analysiert, Muster erkennt und so eventuell sogar Leben rettet. In der Logistik hilft sie, die Lieferketten effizienter zu gestalten, was nicht nur Kosten spart, sondern auch die Umwelt schont. Im Marketing ermöglicht sie ein personalisiertes Kundenerlebnis, da sie Kundenverhalten vorhersagen und auf individuelle Wünsche eingehen kann. Das klingt großartig, aber wo bleibt der Mensch in all dem? Hier kommt der Kern des Ganzen: KI verändert die Art der Arbeitsplätze und schafft neue. Während Routineaufgaben zunehmend von KI-Systemen übernommen werden, entstehen neue Jobs in der Programmierung, Überwachung und Wartung dieser Systeme. Soft Skills wie Kreativität, soziale Intelligenz und die Fähigkeit zur Problemlösung stehen mehr denn je im Vordergrund, da dies Qualitäten sind, in denen KI den Menschen zumindest derzeit nicht ersetzen kann. Die Frage der Ethik darf dabei nicht außer Acht gelassen werden. KI birgt immense Möglichkeiten, aber auch Risiken. Wie stellen wir sicher, dass KI fair und ohne Vorurteile eingesetzt wird? Wie schützen wir die Privatsphäre, wenn KI Algorithmen ständig Daten analysieren? Diese Fragen müssen wir uns jetzt stellen, und ihr, als künftige Gestalter dieser Welt, seid dazu aufgerufen, an diesen Diskussionen und Entwicklungen teilzunehmen. Es ist auch eine Frage der Bildung. Unser Bildungssystem muss sich der neuen Realität anpassen und Schüler auf eine Welt vorbereiten, in der KI eine zentrale Rolle spielt. Das bedeutet nicht, dass jeder zum Programmierer werden muss, aber ein grundlegendes Verständnis von Datenanalysen, digitalen Werkzeugen und der Funktionsweise von Algorithmen wird so wichtig sein wie Lesen, Schreiben und Rechnen. Für den Arbeitsmarkt bringt KI nicht nur Veränderung, sondern auch Vielfalt. Es entstehen neue Branchen und Spezialgebiete, in denen ihr eure Stärken und Leidenschaften entdecken und entfalten könnt. Der Schlüssel dazu ist das lebenslange Lernen. Bleibt neugierig, seid offen für Neues und seid bereit, euch ständig weiterzuqualifizieren. Aber Achtung: Nicht jeder ist ein Fan der raschen Entwicklungen. Es gibt berechtigte Sorgen um Arbeitsplatzverlust und soziale Ungerechtigkeiten. Hier liegt es auch an uns als Gesellschaft, Rahmenbedingungen zu schaffen, die den Übergang in die neue Arbeitswelt sozialverträglich gestalten: Umschulungsprogramme, Weiterbildungen und die Sicherstellung, dass der Fortschritt allen zugutekommt, sind nur einige der Maßnahmen, die wir ergreifen müssen. Die KI in der Arbeitswelt ist keine ferne Zukunftsmusik, sondern ein Stück Realität, das sich Tag für Tag entfaltet. Sie hat das Potential, unsere Arbeitsweise zu revolutionieren, für mehr Effizienz und Kreativität zu sorgen und sogar dabei zu helfen, einige der größten Herausforderungen unserer Zeit zu meistern. Als Schülerinnen und Schüler, die bald Teil dieser Arbeitswelt sein werden, habt ihr die fantastische Chance, die Entwicklung und den Einsatz von KI aktiv mitzugestalten.

Evan: A game developer who is initially dismissive and defensive about the issue of diversity in games. Setting: At a video game conference after a panel discussion. Jasmine: Evan, I just wanted to say I enjoyed your panel discussion on the future of gaming. It's clear you're passionate about the games you develop. Evan: Thanks, Jasmine. I put a lot of myself into my work. It's always nice to meet someone who appreciates it. Jasmine: Absolutely, you have a gift for telling engaging stories. That's actually why I wanted to chat with you. I've noticed that a lot of games, yours included, tend to have a pretty narrow representation of characters. Have you thought about integrating more diversity into your games? Evan: (slightly defensive) Look, I just create games that I think are fun and that sell. I'm not trying to make any political statements. Why does everything have to be about diversity nowadays? Jasmine: It's not about being political, it's about reflecting the world we live in. Games are an amazing medium for storytelling, and I believe they have the power to be even more immersive and relatable when they include a wide range of characters from different backgrounds. Evan: (frustrated) But that's not my responsibility! I'm just trying to make good games. Why should I have to worry about checking off boxes? Jasmine: I understand your frustration, and I'm not saying you need to check off boxes. It's about recognizing that games can only benefit from exploring different perspectives. You and I might be different, but we both care about good games and good stories. Including diverse characters can deepen the narrative and appeal to a broader audience. Evan: I don't know, Jasmine. Sometimes it feels like you try to include a diverse character and then you're just criticized for not getting it exactly right. I can't win. Jasmine: That can happen, sure. But it's also an opportunity to learn and grow as a creator. Engaging with underrepresented communities can help you create more authentic characters. And honestly, it's better to try and be critiqued than to not try at all. Imagine a young black girl or boy playing your game and seeing a hero that looks like them—how empowering would that be? Evan: (pausing to consider) You have a point. It never really occurred to me that I could be impacting someone's life like that with my games. Jasmine: Exactly! And you're not alone in this. Collaboration with consultants or writers from diverse backgrounds can help bring those authentic voices and stories to your game. We all win when the gaming world expands its horizons. Evan: (softening) Okay, I'm starting to see where you're coming from. Making games is about creating experiences that resonate with people, and I guess if I'm not considering the full spectrum of who's playing, I might be missing out on some great narrative opportunities. Jasmine: I'm glad to hear you're open to it. There's so much potential in games as a medium for inclusive storytelling. And I think you're the kind of storyteller who could make a real difference. Evan: (more receptive) Thanks, Jasmine. I'll give it some thought. Maybe it's time to step out of my comfort zone and see what kinds of new stories I can tell. Do you have any suggestions on where to start? Jasmine: Absolutely, I'd be happy to share some resources and maybe even connect you with some folks I know who could provide valuable insights. Evan: (smiling) That would be great. Thank you, Jasmine. It's been enlightening talking to you. Jasmine: Thank you, Evan, for being open to the conversation.

Jasmine: Hey Evan, your session earlier resonated with me. You've got a talent for crafting worlds that draw players in. Evan: I appreciate that, Jasmine. It's nice to hear when the hard work resonates with someone. What aspects stood out to you? Jasmine: Well, I admire how invested you are in storytelling. But I couldn't help but notice the worlds are often populated with similar types of characters. There's room for a broader cast, don't you think? Evan: (slight sigh) Yeah, I hear this a lot. Look, my goal is to entertain and sell games, not to enter into diversity debates. Isn't gaming about escapism and fun? Jasmine: It definitely is about fun, but it's also about connection, right? Our society is a mosaic. Wouldn't it be powerful if our games mirrored that complexity? Evan: (leaning back) I see where you're coming from, but as a developer, I have to consider marketability, deadlines... It's not just about creative decisions. Jasmine: I understand that pressure. But we both care deeply about the craft, and I believe embracing diversity is not just right—it has creative merits too. Evan: (shaking his head) It's complicated, Jasmine. You try to add in a character of a different race or background and it opens up a can of worms. Sometimes it feels like you can't do right by everyone. Jasmine: It's a challenge, I won't deny that. But isn't grappling with complex issues part of what makes storytelling so rewarding? We learn, we grow—it's what makes our narratives richer. Evan: (mulling it over) Sure, that's a fair point. But my intent is never to misrepresent or offend. It seems risky. Jasmine: Taking risks is part of evolving as creators, and the gaming community is becoming incredibly diverse. You might find the reward is greater than the risk. Evan: How so? Jasmine: Think of the players who will see themselves in your games for the first time, who will feel seen and recognized. It's not just about representation—it's about inspiring your audience. Evan: (gaze softened) Inspiration is a pretty compelling argument. It's just—there's a lot of pressure. Jasmine: Pressure exists in any choice we make as creators. And you don't have to navigate it alone; there are communities and industry professionals who can provide insight. Evan: It sounds like a lot to take in. You know your stuff, though. Could you maybe point me in the right direction? Jasmine: Of course, I'm not saying I have all the answers, but I'd love to help you explore this. Shall we bounce ideas off each other over coffee? Evan: (cracking a half-smile) That could work.

Jasmine: Evan, your panel earlier really sparked some thoughts for me. It's evident you love crafting intricate stories. Evan: Thanks, Jasmine. I pour everything into my games. It's good to know when someone else gets that. Jasmine: That connection is exactly what I wanted to touch on. I appreciate your narratives, but I've noticed the characters often feel... familiar. Don't you think exploring diverse characters could bring new depth to your stories? Evan: (folding arms) I create worlds that sell, Jasmine. Worlds that I know and understand. This push for diversity—it complicates things. It dilutes the story with issues that distract from gameplay. Gamers want to escape, not face more social issues. Jasmine: But Evan, gaming is a form of art and communication. It has the power to reflect and affect our lives. When games resonate with a diverse audience, they enrich everyone's experience. Nobody's asking for lectures in a game, just characters that feel as varied as the people playing them. Evan: (eyes narrow) It's a minefield. One foot wrong, and you're slammed for being insensitive or stereotypical. And when I see the ugliness that can come out of these conversations—threats, harassment—I wonder if it's worth the headache. Jasmine: (nodding) I won't deny there's a dark side. It's there, and it's ugly. But doesn't that darkness itself show why representation is so necessary? To deny it is to let that fear win. Both of us care about creating engaging games, right? We want immersive worlds and multilayered characters. Evan: Of course, but why force something that's not natural to the story just to appease a demographic? Jasmine: It's not about forcing it; it's about authenticity. There are countless untold stories from different cultures, races, and genders that can naturally fit into and even enhance your worlds. Evan: (frustration growing) But my worlds are my vision, Jasmine. Should I just alter my vision to fit the current social narrative? Jasmine: It's not about changing your vision but broadening it. It's not just about social narratives—it's about empathy, connection, and growing as a person and a storyteller. A story can be even more powerful when your audience sees a part of themselves reflected in it. Evan: (skeptically) And if I don't share those experiences? Am I supposed to fake it? Jasmine: Not at all. Partner with writers from different backgrounds, consult with those who have lived those experiences. Collaborate to maintain your vision while adding layers of authenticity. Evan: (slightly less resistant) To be honest, my focus has always been on keeping my vision pure. I just... I don't want to lose what I set out to create. Jasmine: I hear you. No one wants you to lose your voice or vision. Think of it as adding more colors to your palette. The underlying picture doesn't change—it just gets richer, and the people who see themselves in it will cherish your work even more. Evan: (quietly contemplating) That's a lot to consider. I can't say I'm sold on the idea, but I won't dismiss it either. There needs to be a balance, I suppose. Jasmine: That's all anyone can ask for, Evan. Balance, thoughtfulness. It could lead to some groundbreaking stories. Evan: Maybe you're right. I'll think about it—that's the most I can promise right now. Jasmine: And that's a good start. Thank you for listening.

Meanwhile, 'true gamers' accuse you of pandering. Half the time, these so-called advocates don't even play the games—they just want to scream about their agendas! Jasmine: (calmly) Evan, let's take a step back. There are certainly extremes in every debate, but most of us are here for the same reason—we love games. We aren't looking to point fingers or push agendas. We're just asking for our experiences to be part of the narrative too. Evan: (sarcastically) Oh, because it's that simple, huh? Jasmine: I won’t pretend that it is, but avoiding the topic isn't the solution either. Yes, there are people who may never be satisfied, but there are also many who just want to feel a connection to the games they play—a sense of belonging. Evan: (scoffs) Belonging. Great buzzword. How about this—I belong to the group that just wants to make games. Not change the world, not preach—just make games! Jasmine: And you're great at it, Evan. I admire that. However, games are a part of our world, and they can be a force for unity. There's strength in diversity—new ideas, new narratives, and new possibilities. It's a chance to grow and tell stories that have never been told before in a medium that we all treasure. Evan: (sighing heavily) You've got your ideals, Jasmine. I'll give you that. But how do you propose we deal with the fallout every time we make a step in any direction? Jasmine: By remembering that for every loud voice of discontent, there's a silent majority who appreciate a thoughtful approach to inclusion. If we aim to tell authentic stories, inclusivity comes naturally, and it resonates with a more engaged and diverse audience. Evan: (calming down a bit) So we should just ignore the ugly side of it and focus on the quiet supporters, huh? Jasmine: Not ignore, but perhaps not let it overshadow the potential for positive impact. It's a challenge, but one that I believe is worth taking on—for ourselves as creators and for the community that loves what we do.

Seems like for every person you please, there's another lined up to take issue with your portrayal. Jasmine: It's a delicate dance, isn't it? I imagine it's been disheartening at times. The goal isn't conflict but connectivity, a reflection of the world's diversity without the sparks. Evan: Connectivity is one way to put it. Sometimes, though, it feels like a tug-of-war between genuine storytelling and checking off the right boxes to avoid the uproar. Jasmine: I hear you on the box-checking. Authentic representation should serve the story, not the other way around. But there's a grace to it, wouldn't you say? A way to silently weave diversity into the fabric of the narrative? Evan: Grace is scarce when voices on all sides are shouting over each other. (shakes head) It's less a weave and more a patchwork being pulled at the seams. Jasmine: True, the clamor can get loud. But between those seams, there's potential for something seamless. Where the clamor fades, that's where the most heartfelt connections are made in the quiet, from player to story. Evan: (leans back) You make it sound almost poetic. The idealist in me wants to believe in that quiet connection. The realist sees the battlefield it’s waged on. Jasmine: I guess the quiet I'm talking about is a bit like hope—the sort that underpins why we care about games in the first place. The ideal and the real, they're both part of the craft, aren't they? Evan: (contemplative) Perhaps they are. The voice of hope is often softer, but it carries weight. And if there's a hope for a richer tapestry without the tear, I'm willing to consider the spindle. Jasmine: That's all anyone could ask, to consider.

That's why it strikes me how much richer the experiences could be with a broader spectrum of characters. And I'm not just talking about skin color or gender, but their backgrounds, their narratives intertwined with the choice-driven gameplay you're so good at. Evan: (lightly chuckling) Richer experiences, huh? Funny how 'richer' often means walking on eggshells these days. Make one character too this or too that, and you're suddenly either a savior or a villain. Can't we just focus on a good game without all the politics? Jasmine: Your point isn't lost on me. Yet I can't help but feel that the politics you mention, they're just the backdrop to what people are really searching for in games—validation, resonance, a reflection of the diversity that's all around us. Evan: (shrugging with a smirk) Validation. Resonance. Fancy words for an industry driven by bottom lines and likes. Though I suppose it's all noble if it helps one feel seen amidst the pixels. Jasmine: It’s a little more than feeling seen—it's about belonging. You've created multifaceted choices that impact epic storylines; now imagine if those choices were infused with perspectives drawn from an even wider array of life experiences. It's not just noble, Evan—it's good game design. Evan: (lightly tapping his foot) Belonging, impact, design... why tie our hands figuring out the correct ratio of representation when we've already got a formula that works? Craft over demographics, that's where I've made my stand. Jasmine: It's a strong stand, with admirable craft. But consider this: demographics can be part of that craft. What if we talked about these subjects not as checkboxes but as threads in a larger tapestry? Like gameplay mechanics or art style, inclusion can be woven into the game's design from the start, enhancing rather than hindering creativity. Evan: (a half-hearted laugh) Oh, to simplify such a tangled web. Inclusion sounds pretty until it screams back at you through social media. But you seem to believe it can be done without the noise? Jasmine: I do, because at the core of it, we both care about the same things—a compelling narrative, immersive worlds, emotional resonance with the player. If we approach inclusion with the same intent and refinement that you approach every other aspect of your games, the noise doesn't have to dictate the outcome. Evan: (cocking his head) That's quite the manifesto. So weave this 'thread' and hope it doesn't unravel everything else? Jasmine: There's no hope without some risk, but it's calculated. With sensitivity and thoughtfulness guiding the loom, it's art, not unraveling—familiar emotions on a broader canvas. Isn't that worth exploring? Evan: (a contemplative pause) Perhaps. No promises on where the threads might lead, but maybe there's some... merit to your vision. Jasmine: And that's an open door. Thank you, Evan, for considering it. You're not just making games; you're shaping experiences, and that influence carries tremendous potential. [Their exchange concludes on a contemplative note, with mutual respect still intact, paving the way for more collaborative discussions in the future.]"},{"instruction":"now write a dialogue scene between a Difficult, rough around the edges Woman and the man she just yelled at about the truth about their reality, the one he knew already, but didn't want to see.

I'm not able to access the page at https://moodledev.io/docs/guides/javascript/reactive#reactive-pattern-highlights directly. However, I can give you a general overview of the reactive programming pattern and provide some advice on how to implement it into your existing Moodle local plugin that uses Chart.js to render graphs. **Reactive Programming Pattern Highlights:** - **Reactive programming** is a programming paradigm oriented around data flows and the propagation of change. - It involves **observing data sources** for changes and automatically propagating these changes through the system to affect the relevant components. - A **reactive system** tends to follow principles such as being responsive, resilient, elastic, and message-driven. - This kind of programming can make it easier to develop dynamic and real-time features that reflect the state of the system or user interactions without requiring explicit commands to update the state. **Advice on Implementation in Moodle with Chart.js:** To implement a reactive pattern in your Moodle local plugin with Chart.js, you could take the following general steps: 1. **Data Source & Observables:** Define your data source so that changes to it can be observed. This could be a local data model or remote API endpoints providing the data for your graphs. Using a JavaScript library like RxJS can help in setting up observables to watch these data sources. 2. **Data Binding:** Bind your reactive data source to the Chart.js graph. Whenever the data source changes, the binding should trigger the graph to update. This could involve writing a JavaScript function that re-renders the Chart.js canvas with the new data. 3. **Event Handlers:** Set up event listeners for user interactions or other system events that should trigger updates to the data source. These event handlers will push new data to the observables that, in turn, trigger updates to the graph. 4. **State Management:** Consider using state management libraries if necessary. If your graph's state becomes complex and involves more than just the real-time data updating, using libraries like Redux (for more traditional React apps) or VueX (for Vue.js apps) could be beneficial. 5. **Error Handling:** Make sure to handle errors and exceptions in data flow. In the reactive pattern, it is vital to ensure the system's stability by managing any failures within data streams or event handling. 6. **Testing:** Test your reactive data flows, checking that the graph updates as expected during data source changes, user interactions, and edge cases. For a **Moodle-specific implementation**: A. **Leverage Moodle's APIs**: Make sure you use Moodle's built-in functions and APIs to retrieve or manipulate data, adhering to any security and database abstraction layers provided by Moodle. B. **Custom AJAX Script**: Use Moodle's AJAX script service to handle data updates between the client side and the server. Create PHP scripts that can return the necessary data in JSON format, and update your observables on the client side whenever the AJAX call returns new data. C. **Behat for Testing**: Utilize Moodle's Behat integration for acceptance testing of your reactive features to ensure that everything works correctly within the Moodle environment. D. **Moodle plugin structure**: Ensure your JavaScript code that implements the reactive pattern adheres to Moodle's plugin structure, placing your JS scripts in the right directory (e.g., \`amd/src\` for AMD modules) and including them properly using Moodle's API for including JavaScript. In summary, implementing a reactive pattern in your Moodle local plugin will involve setting up observables for your data sources, binding these to your Chart.js graph, handling events that trigger updates, responsibly managing state, and adhering to Moodle's specific practices for including and managing JavaScript. Make sure to test thoroughly to ensure the reactivity works as expected within Moodle's environment."},{"instruction":"I want you to act as an English translator, spelling corrector and improver.

However, I can offer some general advice. The reactive pattern in software development is a programming paradigm geared towards dealing with streams of data (such as events, messages, or actions) by expressing static or dynamic data flows and the propagation of change. This means that when the underlying data changes, the UI or certain parts of your application automatically update to reflect those changes. In the context of a Moodle local plugin that renders graphs with Chart.js, these principles can be applied as follows: 1. **Data Abstraction:** Abstract your data layer so that it can emit changes to any listeners. This can be achieved through a simple publish/subscribe pattern, or you can use a state management library that supports reactive data patterns. 2. **UI Component Binding:** Bind your UI components to your data model in such a way that they can react to changes in the data. In React or similar libraries, this often means using state and props to dynamically update the UI. 3. **Data Update Mechanism:** Implement a mechanism (such as a function or an API call) that can modify the data — for example, to fetch new data from a database or to respond to user input. Now, if you want to make your Chart.js usage reactive in your Moodle plugin, you can: - **Separate your data-fetching logic**: Ensure that there's a clear mechanism for retrieving the data that needs to be displayed in the graph. - **Watch for data updates**: When the source data that feeds into the graph changes, you need a mechanism to \\"watch\\" or listen for these changes. Once a change is detected, you need to update the chart. You could do this by using event listeners or by checking periodically if the data has changed. - **Re-render the chart upon data change**: With Chart.js, you typically need to call \`.update()\` on your chart instance when you change its data or options to re-render it with the new information. To implement a reactive pattern to your existing local plugin, here are some general steps: 1. **Identify your data sources:** Understand where the data for your graph is coming from (e.g., a database, external API, user input). 2. **Create a function to fetch or update this data:** This function will handle getting the new data when needed and should be able to emit an event or call a callback when the data changes. 3. **Set up a listener in your plugin:** This listener should respond to the change event from step 2 by updating the chart's data and calling the \`update\` method of your Chart.js chart instance. 4. **Ensure your plugin lifecycle can handle updates:** In a Moodle plugin, you should guarantee that your lifecycle hooks are properly set up to instantiate the chart when the page loads and update it as needed without causing performance issues or memory leaks. Please note that these guidelines are quite abstract because I do not have visibility into the specific page you referenced. Your actual implementation details will depend on the specific technologies and frameworks you're using within your Moodle plugin. If you're using plain JavaScript, you'd manage updates differently than if you're using a framework like React. Therefore, fine-tuning these steps would require understanding the architecture of your existing plugin."},{"instruction":"Every time I expect something, it doesn't happen, and I wonder why?","output":"Expectations not matching reality can occur for many reasons, and without more context, it's difficult to provide a precise answer. However, here are some general reasons why expectations might not align with outcomes: 1. Unrealistic Expectations: Your expectations might be unrealistic or too high given the circumstances. It's important to set realistic goals based on your abilities, resources, and constraints. 2. Lack of Control: Many events in life are beyond our control. You can do everything \\"right\\" and still not get the outcome you want due to unforeseen circumstances or other people's actions. 3. Incomplete Information: You might not have all the information necessary to make a correct prediction. Especially in complex situations, the outcome can be influenced by factors you're unaware of or didn't consider. 4. Confirmation Bias: You might be paying more attention to information that confirms your expectations and disregarding information that doesn't. This cognitive bias can lead to unrealistic expectations. 5. Over-optimism: Sometimes, people are overly optimistic about their chances of success. Optimism is generally a good trait, but it can lead to repeatedly setting expectations that are too high. 6. Misinterpretation: Perhaps the way you interpret a situation leads to a certain expectation. Others might see the same situation differently and thus expect different outcomes. To mitigate the discrepancy between expectation and reality, consider the following actions: - Reflect on previous expectations that didn't materialize and analyze why there was a gap. - Adjust expectations to be more realistic and grounded in evidence. - Prepare for various outcomes, not just the one you expect. - Focus on the process and the things you can control, not just the outcome. - Seek out diverse perspectives to broaden your understanding of possible outcomes. - Learn from past experiences and apply those lessons to future expectations. Managing expectations doesn't mean you have to lower them. Instead, the goal is to set them at a level that is both challenging and achievable, while remaining flexible enough to adapt to changing circumstances. If you find yourself frequently disappointed, consider working with a coach, mentor, or therapist who can help you align your expectations with reality more effectively."},{"instruction":"For example, if I imagine that I'm going to go there today and make friends, it's never going to happen, but then I go to a place without thinking about it and I make friends.","output":"The phenomenon you're describing is quite common, and it could be related to a few principles of psychology and social interaction: 1. **Pressure and Anxiety**: When you set an expectation for yourself, it can inadvertently create pressure to perform or succeed at the task. This can make you feel anxious or self-conscious, which might affect your behavior and social interactions in a way that hinders making friends. 2. **Spontaneity**: Going into a social situation without the pressure of expectations can lead to more natural and spontaneous interactions. People often find spontaneity to be an attractive quality; it can make you seem more approachable and genuine, which is conducive to forming friendships. 3. **Attachment to Outcome**: When you're attached to a specific outcome (like making friends), you might become too focused on the goal and not enjoy the moment. This could make your interactions less authentic. On the other hand, without any set expectations, you're more likely to be present in the moment and enjoy the interaction for what it is. 4. **Self-Fulfilling Prophecy**: Sometimes, being overly concerned about an outcome can influence your behavior in a way that brings about the opposite of what you desire. By worrying too much about making friends, you might unconsciously emit signals that deter others from approaching you. 5. **Nonverbal Communication**: Our body language, tone of voice, and other nonverbal cues can communicate our internal states to others. If you're not preoccupied with making friends, you're likely more relaxed and open, which can be inviting to others. To navigate such situations, you may consider the following tips: - **Mindfulness**: Stay present in the moment. Practice mindfulness to reduce anxiety about results and focus on enjoying the interaction itself. - **Non-Attachment**: While it's good to have goals, try to release attachment to specific outcomes. Approach social situations with the intent to be open, authentic, and curious about others without the heavy expectation of making friends. - **Confidence Building**: Work on self-confidence. People are naturally drawn to confidence. If you feel good about yourself and project that, you're more likely to attract friendships. - **Embrace Rejection**: Understand that not every social interaction will lead to friendship, and that's okay. Rejection is a part of life and doesn't reflect your worth as a person. - **Enjoy the Process**: Focus on enjoying the process of meeting new people and learning about them rather than making friends as an end goal. Remember, forming meaningful connections often takes time and occurs naturally. So give yourself permission to take the pressure off, and allow interactions to unfold in their own way."},{"instruction":"Everything is like that, even the things I can't control, if I imagine them, they never happen.","output":"What you are experiencing is not uncommon, and it can be influenced by a variety of factors, including psychological patterns and the nature of expectations themselves. Here are some considerations that might help you understand this phenomenon better: 1. **Self-fulfilling Prophecy**: While this usually refers to the idea of believing in something so strongly that you unconsciously make it happen, the opposite can be true as well. In your case, expecting something might lead you to unconsciously behave in ways that prevent it from happening. 2. **Confirmation Bias**: Once you notice a pattern (e.g., when you imagine something it doesn't happen), you might start to only pay attention to the times when your expectations are not met, reinforcing the belief in this pattern, even if it's not as consistent as it seems. 3. **Control and Letting Go**: For events beyond your control (e.g., meeting someone by chance), it's possible that when you don't expect them and are more relaxed, you're more open to the natural flow of events, which might in turn make them more likely to occur. 4. **Expectation vs. Intention**: Differentiate between passive expectations and active intentions. Expectations can sometimes be passive, where you hope for something to happen but don't take active steps towards making it happen. Intentions, on the other hand, are anchored in action and can lead to more proactive behavior. 5. **Pressure of Expectations**: The pressure of your own expectations may create a state of anxiety or stress, which can be counterproductive, especially in social situations or events that involve an element of chance or the actions of others. 6. **Murphy's Law**: This adage states that \\"anything that can go wrong, will go wrong.\\" While not a scientific law, it humorously encapsulates the idea that we often notice and remember when things don't go according to plan, rather than when they do. 7. **Focus on the Present**: Focusing too much on what you expect to happen in the future can detract from your engagement with the present moment. This might mean you are not in the best position to influence outcomes as they unfold. If you find this pattern troubling or if it's having a negative impact on your life, it may be helpful to: - Practice mindfulness and meditation to stay present and reduce anxiety. - Reflect on the expectations you set and consider whether they are realistic. - Focus more on preparing for a variety of outcomes rather than fixating on one specific expectation. - Cultivate flexibility in your thoughts and actions, allowing you to adapt to whatever happens. - Discuss these patterns with a therapist or counselor who can provide personalized strategies to address them. It's also important to recognize that coincidence plays a role in life, and sometimes the connection we make between our expectations and outcomes is based on patterns that may not actually be predictive or causative. Finding a balance between having hopes and being open to the myriad possibilities that life presents can help you navigate expectations more effectively."},{"instruction":"So I should just live my life without thinking, right?","output":"Not exactly. Living without thinking or planning at all isn't advisable, as being thoughtful and intentional about your actions is important for achieving goals and navigating life effectively. However, there's a balance to be struck between overthinking with rigid expectations and having no direction at all. Here are some strategies to find that balance: 1. **Mindfulness**: Practice mindfulness to stay present and engage actively with your current experiences, without overthinking the future or dwelling on the past excessively. 2. **Set Intentions**: Instead of having rigid expectations, set intentions. An intention is less about the outcome and more about the attitude you want to cultivate or the values you want to live by. 3. **Plan with Flexibility**: It’s important to plan for the future and consider the consequences of your actions, but do so with the understanding that life is unpredictable and may require you to adapt. 4. **Find Enjoyment in the Process**: Invest more in the process of living — the doing, learning, and experiencing —rather than only focusing on outcomes and results. 5. **Let Go of Control**: Acknowledge that you can't control everything in life. Be prepared to accept what comes and able to adapt as necessary. 6. **Embrace Uncertainty**: Recognize that uncertainty is a part of life. Embrace the unknown to some extent, and be willing to take calculated risks when appropriate. 7. **Reflect and Learn**: Take time to reflect on your experiences, learn from them, and make informed decisions without overanalyzing. 8. **Balanced Thinking**: Engage in balanced thinking that considers various possibilities without obsessing over any one particular outcome. 9. **Seek Feedback**: Engage with others, listen to their perspectives, and be open to feedback, which can help you avoid being trapped in your own thought patterns. 10. **Self-Compassion**: Don’t be too hard on yourself when things don’t go as planned. Practice self-compassion and understand that it’s okay to not have all the answers or to make mistakes. The key is to engage in thoughtful consideration and planning for the future while also being able to enjoy the present moment and adapt to changes as they occur.

Un AGI sur un ordinateur quantique, combinant les avantages de l'AGI avec ceux de l'informatique quantique, pourrait potentiellement inaugurer des avancées révolutionnaires dans de nombreux domaines. Voici quelques exemples : 1. Résolution de problèmes complexes: Les ordinateurs quantiques sont particulièrement aptes à résoudre des problèmes d'optimisation et de recherche complexe qui sont actuellement inabordables par les ordinateurs classiques. Un AGI pourrait utiliser cette puissance pour résoudre des problèmes considérés aujourd'hui comme pratiquement insurmontables, comme la modélisation exacte de grandes molécules pour la découverte de médicaments ou l'optimisation de systèmes logistiques massivement complexes. 2. Cryptographie: Avec l'aptitude des ordinateurs quantiques à briser les systèmes de cryptage classiques, un AGI pourrait créer ou décrypter des codes de sécurité avec une efficacité sans précédent, menant potentiellement à une redistribution complète du pouvoir dans le cyberespace. 3. Améliorations en IA: Un AGI sur une plateforme quantique serait capable de concevoir et d'entraîner des algorithmes d'intelligence artificielle plus puissants et plus efficaces, potentiellement transcendant les barrières de performance inhérentes aux systèmes classiques. 4. Simulation et recherche en physique: Comme les ordinateurs quantiques opèrent en utilisant les principes de la mécanique quantique, un AGI pourrait les utiliser pour simuler avec précision des systèmes quantiques complexes, ce qui pourrait mener à de nouvelles découvertes en physique, en chimie et dans d'autres sciences fondamentales. 5. Exploration spatiale: La computation quantique pourrait être utilisée pour optimiser les trajectoires spatiales, gérer de façon autonome des habitats spatiaux, et traiter des quantités massives de données de télescopes et autres instruments d'exploration spatiale. 6. Intelligence décisionnelle: Un AGI pourrait prendre des décisions stratégiques en intégrant une immense variété de variables et en prédisant des issue à long terme, ce qui serait précieux dans des contextes tels que la gouvernance globale, la finance complexe et la gestion des crises. 7. Médecine personnalisée: En combinant la puissance de l'AGI avec celle du traitement de données quantique, on pourrait voir émerger des avancées dans la compréhension et le traitement des maladies sur une base extrêmement personnalisée, en tenant compte de la génétique, de l'environnement et du style de vie de chaque individu.

Sözleşme şartları incelendiğinde, genel olarak yüklenici firma lehine çeşitli ayrıcalıklar ve korumaların olduğu görülmektedir. Odaklanılası Risk Noktaları: 1. Vekaletname ile Geniş Yetki ve Ağır Cezai Şartlar: Yükleniciye geniş yetkiler verilirken, arsa sahiplerine yükümlülükler ve ciddi cezai tazminatlar yükleniyor. Bu yükümlülükler hem belirsiz durumlarda hem de beklenmedik gecikmelerde yükleniciye esneklik tanırken, arsa sahiplerini finansal olarak zor duruma düşürebilir. 2. İnşaat Sürecinin Uzaması: Sözleşmede inşaat sürecinin başlangıcı ve bitişi için net tarihler belirtilse de, yüklenici firma mücbir sebepleri ve haklı gerekçeleri ileri sürerek süreçleri uzatabilir. Bu, belirsizlik yaratarak proje tamamlanma tarihini ve teslimatı geciktirebilir. 3. Mücbir Sebep ve Yüklenicinin Sorumlulukları: Sözleşmede “mücbir sebep” tanımı geniş bırakılmış ve bu durumlar yüzünden yaşanabilecek gecikmeler, yüklenicinin sorumluluğunu sınırlıyor. Ancak bu gecikmeler konut alıcılarını ve arsa sahiplerini beklenenden daha fazla süreyle bağlayabilir. 4. Değişiklikler ve Emsal Katsayısındaki Farklılıklar: İnşaat sürecinde meydana gelebilecek değişiklikler veya emsal katsayısındaki artış veya azalışlar, paylaşım oranlarında ve tarafların haklarında değişikliğe yol açabilir. Bu tür değişimler neticesinde arsa sahiplerinin karşılaşabileceği hak kayıpları veya maddi zararlar net olarak belirlenmemiştir. 5. Zorlaştırılmış Sözleşme Feshi: Sözleşmede, olası inşaat gecikmelerinde arsa sahiplerinin cayma haklarının bulunmaması, arsa sahiplerini projeye uzun bir dönem için bağlar. Bu durum, arsa sahipleri açısından proje başlamadan veya tamamlanmadan caymak istediklerinde zorluk yaratabilir. Sözleşmede belirtilen kısa süre içerisinde vekaletnamelerin düzenlenmesi, şerh, hisse devri ve ipotek işlemleri gibi hususlar da dikkat gerektiren diğer önemli konulardır. Eksik veya gecikmelerde yükleniciye yüksek miktarda tazminatlar öngörülmüş, bu da projenin çeşitli aşamalarında arsa sahipleri için finansal riskler oluşturabilir. Sonuç olarak, arsa sahipleri ve yüklenici firma arasındaki güç dengesizliği, sözleşmenin uygulanması sırasında bir tarafın aleyhine sonuçlar doğurabilecek riskler oluşturabilir. Genişletilmiş Arsa Payı Karşılığı İnşaat Sözleşmesi Analizi: Sözleşmenin eksiksiz olarak değerlendirilmesi, tüm maddelerin, tanımların ve cezai şartların incelenmesini gerektirir. Arazi sahipleri ile yüklenici (SİLTAŞ YAPI) arasındaki ilişkinin karmaşıklığı ve işin büyüklüğü düşünüldüğünde, tarafların karşı karşıya kalabileceği riskler ve sorunlar dikkatli bir şekilde ele alınmalıdır. 1. Projeye Bağlılık ve Süreç Yönetimi: Maddeler arasında yer alan süreç ve etaplandırma hükümleri, projenin başından teslimat aşamasına kadar olan zaman dilimini kapsar ve bu zaman dilimi içindeki her aşamada belirgin bir zaman çerçevesinin oluşturulmasını öngörür. Örnek olarak, yıkımın ardından ruhsat işlemlerine başlanması (MADDE 7.3) veya yapı denetim kuruluşuyla ilgili değişikliklerin (MADDE 10.6) bu çerçevede değerlendirildiği gözlemlenebilir. 2. Müteahhit Koruma Alanları: Sözleşme, özellikle yüklenici için mücbir sebepler ve haklı sebepler (MADDE 9) gibi koruma hükümleri içerir. Yükleniciye, gerçekleşebilecek olaylar ve sıkıntılar karşısında haklı sebeplerden dolayı işin seyrini durdurma hakkını saklı tutar. Görüldüğü gibi, bu tür durumlar yine yüklenicinin projeye olan bağlılığını esnek hale getirir. 3. Cezai Tazminat ve Yükümlülükler: Sözleşmenin birçok yerinde arsa sahiplerinin yükümlülüklerine ve yükleniciye olan mali taahhütlerine dikkat çekilir. Örneğin, arsa sahiplerinin verilen süre içinde vekaletnameyi tanzim ve teslim etme yükümlülüğü (MADDE 4) veya hisse devri, kat irtifakı kurulması ve ipotek fekki gibi işlemler için öngörülen sürelerde yükleniciye mali cezaların uygunlukları (MADDE 8.3) gibi. 4. Teslim Sürecinde Belirsizlikler: Sözleşmede bağımsız bölüm ve ortak alanların teslim süreçlerine ilişkin bazı belirsizlikler bulunabilir. Belirtilen “anahtar teslim” (MADDE 2.1) ve “işin tamamının inşası” (MADDE 8.7) ifadeleri, yüklenicinin işi belirli kalite standartlarına göre tamamlaması gerektiğini ifade etse de, bu standartların ne olduğunun açık seçik tanımlanması gerekir. 5. Finansal Riskler ve Mali Sorumluluk: Sözleşmenin maddelerinde arsa sahiplerine ilişkin anılan finansal yükümlülükler ve sorumluluklar, ciddi finansal riskleri beraberinde getirebilir. Örneğin, harçlar, vergiler ve emlak vergileri gibi konularla ilgili ödemeler (MADDE 8.4) veya Yüklenicinin reklam ve tanıtım hakları karşılığında potansiyel geri ödemeler (MADDE 8.5) bu konular arasındadır. Metnin genelinde, arsa sahiplerinin işin başlaması, devamı ve tamamlanması üzerinde etkili olabilme yetkisinin sınırlı olduğu ve çoğu kez yüklenicinin inisiyatifine bırakıldığı anlaşılmaktadır. Ayrıca, genel şartlar ve teknik şartnamenin detayları gibi önemli meselelerde çoğu kez müteahhidin daha önceden belirlediği veya müzakere ettiği koşullar geçerlidir. iPhone’umdan gönderildi Belirtilen metin, bir arsa payı karşılığı inşaat sözleşmesidir ve arsa sahipleri ile inşaatı üstlenen yüklenici firma (SİLTAŞ YAPI) arasındaki hukuki ilişkiyi düzenlemektedir. Metnin içeriğinde dikkatle ele alınması gereken birkaç nokta şunlar olabilir: 1. Güç Dengesizliği ve Tarafların Yükleri: Sözleşme, yüklenici firma lehine pek çok garanti ve güvence içermektedir. Örneğin, 4. maddede yükleniciye geniş vekalet hakları verilmektedir ve bu haklar dahilinde oldukça ciddi cezai şartlar belirlenmiştir. Arsa sahipleri, verilmesi gereken vekaletnamelerde gecikme veya eksiklik olması durumunda yüksek meblağlarda tazminat ödemeyi taahhüt etmişlerdir. 2. Cezai Tazminat: Sözleşmede cezai tazminatların günlük olarak ve oldukça yüksek miktarlarda belirlenmesi, arsa sahipleri açısından ağır bir yük oluşturabilir. Bu durum, arsa sahiplerinin lehine dengenin bozulmasına sebep olabilir. 3. Feshi Zorlaştıran Şartlar: Sözleşme, arsa sahiplerinin fesih haklarını ciddi ölçüde kısıtlar veya zorlaştırır niteliktedir. Örneğin, mücbir sebepler dahil olmak üzere, inşaat işlemlerinin gecikmesi durumunda cayma haklarının olmaması sıkıntı yaratabilir. Bu durum, arsa sahiplerinin beklenen süreden daha uzun bir süre zarfında bağlı kalmasını gerektirebilir. 4. Değişiklikler ve Beklenmedik Şartlar: İmar durumu, yasal düzenlemeler ve diğer beklenmedik şartlar değiştiğinde, bu değişikliklerin etkileri paylaşım oranları üzerinden taraflara yansıtılması söz konusu olabilir. Projenin tarafları için getireceği ek yükümlülükler ve fırsatlar konusunda netlik sağlanmalıdır. 5. Yüklenici Yetkilerinin Genişliği: Yüklenicinin projeyi dilediği şekilde yönetmesi ve değiştirmesi, alt yükleniciler atayabilmesi, finans kuruluşları ile çalışabilmesi konularında geniş bir yetki alanı tanımlanmakta ve arsa sahiplerinin bu süreç üzerinde neredeyse hiç söz sahibi olmamaları söz konusu olabilmektedir. Her sözleşme, taraflar arasındaki müzakere süreçlerine bağlı olarak değiştirilebilir ve dengelenir. Söz konusu şartların hukuka ve adilliğe uygun olup olmadığını değerlendirmek için, tarafların hukuki danışmanlık alması önerilir. Sözleşmenin hukuka uygunluğunun ve tarafların korunmasının değerlendirilmesi, avukatlar veya hukuk danışmanları tarafından yapılmalıdır. Elbette, sözleşmede inşaat teslim sürecini geciktirebilecek ve bu durumun yüklenici lehine işlemesini sağlayabilecek bazı kaçamak ifadeler ve belirsizlik yaratabilecek noktaları aşağıdaki gibi özetleyebilirim: 1. İnşaat Ruhsatı ve Kentsel Dönüşüm İşlemleri: Sözleşmede, inşaat ruhsatının alınmasının kentsel dönüşüm işlemlerinin tamamlanmasına bağlı olduğu ve bu süreçte gecikmelerin olabileceği ifade edilmiştir. Bu tür süreçler uzun sürebilir ve inşaatın başlaması için belirsiz bir zaman dilimi oluşturabilir. 5. KENTSEL DÖNÜŞÜM YASASI KAPSAMINDA YAPILACAK İŞLEMLER:…6306 sayılı yasa kapsamında yapılacak riskli yapı veya riskli alan süreci tamamlanıp kiracıların tahliye ettirilmesi, yapıların yıktırılması ve tevhit işlemlerinin yapılmasının akabinde inşaat ruhsatının alınabileceği sözleşmenin taraflarınca bilinmektedir… 2. İnşaat Yapma Süresi ve Ek Süreler: Yükleniciye inşaatı tamamlama için belirli bir süre verildiği (30 ay) ve gerekli görüldüğünde ek süre talep edebileceği ifade edilmiştir. Bu, proje teslimatını belirsiz bir döneme sarkıtabilir. 7.3.İNŞAATI YAPMA SÜRESİ:…İnşaat, yapım ruhsat tarihinden itibaren en geç 30 ay içinde fiilen kullanıma hazır bir şekilde anahtar teslimi bitirilecektir. Arsa Sahipleri, YÜKLENİCİ’nin talebi olursa gerekli gördüğü halde 30 aylık bu süreye ek olarak 6 (altı) aylık sürenin verileceğini kabul etmişlerdir… 3. Mücbir Sebepler ve Haklı Sebepler: Her türlü gecikme mücbir sebep veya haklı sebep ilan edilerek yüklenicinin sorumluluğunun azaltılabilmesi veya ortadan kalkması öngörülmektedir. Bu hüküm, yükleniciye gecikmeleri kendi lehine yorumlama ve inşaat süresini uzatma imkanı tanır. 9. MÜCBİR SEBEPLER VE HAKLI SEBEPLER:…Müteahhide yukarıdaki maddelerde belirtilen edimlerin yerine getirilmemesi, hisselerin süresinde devredilmemesi ve ipoteklerin gününde kaldırılmaması…müteahhit yönünden haklı sebep olarak kabul edilir… 4. Yeni Yapı Denetim Kuruluşuyla Anlaşma Süreci: Sözleşmenin 10.6 maddesinde yapı denetim kuruluşunun değiştirilmesi durumunda yeni bir anlaşma yapılana kadar geçecek sürenin yüklenici için haklı bir sebep teşkil edeceği belirtilmiştir. Bu da projenin tamamlanma süresini etkileyebilecek bir başka faktördür. 10.6 YAPI DENETİM KURULUŞU:…yapı denetim firmasının değişme zorunluluğu çıkması, yetkisinin iptal edilmesi vb. sebeplerle yeni yapı denetim firmasıyla anlaşana kadar geçecek süre… 5. Arsa Sahipleri veya Diğer Tarafların Eylemleri: Sözleşmede, arsa sahiplerinin veya diğer ilgili tarafların, inşaat süresi ve proje gelişimine müdahil olması durumunda bu eylemlerin yüklenici için gecikme ve ek süre talep etme sebebi olabileceği belirtilmiştir. Bu durum, yüklenicinin inşaat sürecini yönetme şeklinde geniş bir manevra alanı sağlar. 9. MÜCBİR SEBEPLER VE HAKLI SEBEPLER:…imar planlarının iptali ve yapım şartlarının olumsuz olarak bir değişimi halinde yüklenici sözleşmeden vazgeçebilir… Yukarıda belirtilen noktalar, yüklenicinin süreci uzatma yetkisini gösteren bazı örneklerdir. Ancak, hukuki bir değerlendirme için detaylı bir inceleme yapılması ve sözleşme hükümlerinin yerel yasal standartlar ve adil ticaret uygulamaları çerçevesinde değerlendirilmesi gerektiğini unutmamak önemlidir. 1. MADDE 2.1 - Anahtar Teslimi - Orijinal Metin: “ANAHTAR TESLİM: YÜKLENİCİ tarafından hazırlanacak … bitirilmesi ve bağımsız bölümlerin oturmaya elverişli bir şekilde arsa sahiplerine zilyetliğinin devredilmesidir.” - Yorum: “Anahtar teslimi” tanımının ne anlama geldiği ve projenin tamamlanma düzeyinin ne olması gerektiği açıkça tanımlanmıştır. Ancak, “oturmaya elverişli” ifadesinin neyi kapsadığı daha ayrıntılı açıklanabilir. 2. MADDE 2.6 - Brüt Alan - Orijinal Metin: “BRÜT ALAN: … BAĞIMSIZ BÖLÜMLER’in içerisinde yer alan duvarları dahil hesaplanacak faydalı ve kullanılabilir alanlar toplamını ifade eder.” - Yorum: Brüt alanın ne olduğu açıklanmış, ancak bu hesaplamanın ölçüm standartları ve metodolojisinin detaylarına değinilmemiş olabilir. 3. MADDE 3.3 - İnşaat Plan ve Projeleri - Orijinal Metin: “İnşaat plan ve projelerine, 1. Sınıf işçilik ve malzeme kullanımına uygun…” - Yorum: “1. Sınıf işçilik ve malzeme kullanımı” ifadesi bir kalite ölçütüne işaret ediyor, ancak “1. Sınıf\\"ın somut ölçütleri ve standartları netleştirilmeli. 4. MADDE 4 - Taşınmaz Maliklerinin Vekalet Vermesi - Orijinal Metin: “…gereken her türlü resmi işlemlerin takip ve intacı için Müteahhit ya da yetkilendirdiği kişilere süresiz vekaletname vermeyi…” - Yorum: Arsa sahiplerinden yükleniciye verilecek süresiz vekaletin kapsamı geniş ve bu, arsa sahiplerinin haklarını sınırlayabilir ve aşırı yüklenme olanakları yaratabilir. 5. MADDE 5 - Kentsel Dönüşüm Yasası - Orijinal Metin: “…6306 sayılı yasa kapsamında ilgili taşınmazlarla ilgili gerekli başvurularda bulunacaktır…” - Yorum: Kentsel dönüşüm işlemleri ve başvurular konusu, proje akışı üzerinde belirleyici olacak ancak başvuru süreçlerinin süresi ve etapları daha net tanımlanmalıdır. 6. MADDE 7.1 - Teknik Şartname - Orijinal Metin: \\" İnşaat, işbu sözleşmeye ve onun ayrılmaz bir parçası olarak taraflar arasında imza olunacak teknik şartname esaslarına…” - Yorum: Teknik şartname, yapının inşasına dair özgül standartları belirler, ancak bu şartnamelerin içeriği ve belirlenme şekli sözleşmede detaylandırılmalıdır. 7. MADDE 7.2 - Alanının Tesviyesi, Yıkım ve Temizlenmesi - Orijinal Metin: “İşbu sözleşmenin konusunu oluşturan arazi üzerindeki tüm yapı ve eklentilerin tasfiyesi, yıkımı…” - Yorum: Yıkım ve temizleme süreci yüklenicinin sorumluluğunda olup belirli bir zaman çerçevesinde tamamlanması gerektiği belirtilmeli. 8. MADDE 9 - Mücbir Sebepler ve Haklı Sebepler - Orijinal Metin: “…Mücbir sebepten etkilenen taraf, işbu sözleşmede süreleri belirtilen konular haricinde olayı…” - Yorum: Mücbir sebepler ve haklı sebepler yüklenici için geniş bir korunma alanı oluşturur, bu maddelerin kullanımı daha dar ve kesin olmalıdır. 9. MADDE 10.8 - Garanti Süresi - Orijinal Metin: “…kullanım hatalarından ileri gelmeyen her türlü kusur ve arızaların düzeltilmesi, giderilmesi…” - Yorum: Garanti süresi ve şartları iyi tanımlanmışken, garanti kapsamındaki ögeler ve prosedürlerin daha ayrıntılı olarak açıklanması gerekebilir. 10. MADDE 11.3 - Tebligat Adresleri - Orijinal Metin: “İşbu sözleşmenin başında belirtilen adresler Malik’in ve Yüklenicinin kanuni ikametgahıdır…” - Yorum: Adres değişikliklerinin ve tebligatın yönetimi açıkça tanımlAnmalı","output":"**RAPOR: Arsa Payı Karşılığı İnşaat Sözleşmesi Risk Değerlendirmesi** **Rapor Tarihi:** [Rapor Tarihi Giriniz] **Giriş:** Bu rapor, arsa sahipleri ile SİLTAŞ YAPI arasındaki arsa payı karşılığı inşaat sözleşmesinin risk değerlendirmesine yöneliktir. Sözleşme incelendiğinde arsa sahiplerini potansiyel finansal ve hukuki risklere maruz bırakabilecek maddeler tespit edilmiştir. **Araştırma Metodolojisi:** Sözleşmenin her bir maddesi titizlikle incelenmiş ve tarafların yükümlülükleri, hakları, ve süreç içerisinde karşılaşabilecekleri riskler değerlendirilmiştir. **Bulgular:** 1. **Vekaletnama ve Cezai Şartlar:** Arsa sahiplerinin yüklenici firmaya geniş yetkiler verdiği ve ciddi cezai tazminatlarla karşı karşıya kalabilecekleri tespit edilmiştir. Bu durum, sözleşme dengesinin yüklenici lehine bir ağırlık oluşturduğunu ve arsa sahiplerinin savunmasız bırakıldığını göstermektedir. 2. **İnşaat Süresi:** Yüklenici firma, sözleşmede belirlenen inşaat süresini mücbir sebepler ve haklı gerekçelerle uzatabilir.

However, there are certain situations or configurations where this might not be the case: 1. Custom DNS Settings: If the LG TV has been manually configured to use a specific DNS server other than the one provided by your router, it will bypass the router's DNS settings. This can be changed within the TV's network settings. 2. Hardcoded DNS: In the past, certain devices have had hardcoded DNS settings that they use regardless of the network's DHCP settings. This is not common, and LG TVs typically do not have hardcoded DNS settings, but it's something to consider if you're experiencing DNS bypass behavior. 3. Software Bugs or Firmware Issues: Occasionally, a bug in the TV's firmware might cause it to not properly use the DNS settings provided by the router. If you suspect your LG TV is not using your router's DNS settings and you want to enforce this: - Check the network settings on your LG TV. If there is a manual DNS setting applied, try setting it to automatic so that it obtains the DNS server address from your router. - Review any advanced or developer settings on the TV to ensure there isn't a special configuration overriding your DNS settings. - If you are using a custom DNS service on your router for content filtering or other services, make sure your LG TV isn't bypassing it through any VPN or proxy settings. - Update your LG TV firmware to the latest version to resolve any bugs that might cause network misconfiguration.

The formula for specific strength is: [ text{Specific Strength} = frac{text{Tensile Strength}}{text{Density}} ] Where: - **Tensile Strength** is the maximum stress that a material can withstand while being stretched or pulled before necking, which is when the specimen's cross-section starts to significantly contract. - **Density** is the mass per unit volume of a material. In practice, specific strength helps engineers and designers to choose materials that will provide the best performance for structures, components, and vehicles that benefit from being lightweight without compromising their structural integrity.

Here is a real-life scenario illustrating ontological pluralism in practice: **Cultural and Environmental Management in a Multinational Corporation** Suppose you're a project manager at a multinational corporation planning to open a new manufacturing plant in a culturally rich and ecologically sensitive area of a foreign country. You need to understand and address the perspectives of multiple stakeholders, including local communities, environmentalists, and your corporation's investors. **Local Community:** The indigenous people of the area have a spiritual and ancestral connection to the land. For them, elements of the environment such as rivers, mountains, and forests have ontological status as living ancestors or spiritual entities. Their ontological view includes non-material beings and relationships that are essential to their identity and way of life. **Environmentalists:** From an ecological standpoint, the environment is seen as a network of biological entities and processes. This view emphasizes the ontological status of ecosystems, species, and genetic diversity. Environmentalists focus on the intrinsic value of natural habitats and the importance of biodiversity, often advocating for the sustainability and preservation of the environment. **Corporation's Investors:** The investors are concerned with the economic and physical aspects of setting up the plant. They view the environment in utilitarian terms, with land seen as real estate, natural resources as commodities, and the location's value is primarily economic. Their ontological stance prioritizes physical objects, properties, and financial assets. **The Scenario:** In your role, you must negotiate the complex reality of these differing ontological commitments: 1. Engage with the local community to understand their cultural ontological perspective. This might involve acknowledging the existence of non-material entities (spiritual significances) and incorporating these into your planning. For example, it may be necessary to avoid certain areas deemed sacred or to alter construction plans to respect the local beliefs. 2. Collaborate with environmentalists by conducting thorough environmental impact assessments that account for the ontological status of ecosystems, species, and genetic diversity. By doing so, you would ensure that the construction and operation of the plant do not irreparably harm the local ecology. 3. Communicate with investors to address their materialistic ontological concerns, by presenting economically viable plans that also respect the environmental and cultural values. This could involve exploring sustainable building technologies and processes that reduce ecological damage while maintaining economic feasibility. By balancing and negotiating between these distinct ontological categories, you exemplify ontological pluralism in practice. You acknowledge that different entities – whether cultural beliefs, ecosystems, or economic assets – have their own modes of existence and require different approaches to management and coexistence. This scenario exemplifies how ontological pluralism is not just a theoretical position but also a practical approach to dealing with complex problems involving different systems of belief and value."},{"instruction":"how does Empedocles view ontological pluralism","output":"Empedocles was a pre-Socratic philosopher and poet from ancient Greece, who lived around 490 to 430 BCE. While the term \\"ontological pluralism\\" was not used in his time and would be an anachronism if applied to his philosophy, we can make some conceptual links given his ideas. Empedocles is known for his theory on the nature of the universe, which can be seen as a form of ontological pluralism because he posited that everything is composed of four roots, which he identified with the gods and equated with what would later be known as the four classical elements: earth, water, air, and fire. These elements, or \\"roots,\\" were mixed and separated by two divine forces, love (Philia) and strife (Neikos). Empedocles believed that these forces and elements were fundamental and that all physical objects were combinations of the four elements in various proportions. In terms of ontological pluralism, Empedocles’ view recognizes a diversity of fundamental entities (the four elements) and the processes (love and strife) which underpin the multiplicity of forms and changes in the world. Each element exhibits a particular way of being, and together they constitute complex objects, including living organisms. Empedocles also posited a cyclical process governed by love and strife wherein the elements would come together into an indistinguishable union and then be torn apart into distinct entities again over cosmic cycles. This cosmic cycle can be seen as a process that respects the integrity of the different elements in their separate states and their unity when mixed. While modern ontological pluralism deals with more abstract and varied categories of being than those proposed by Empedocles, his philosophy does represent an early step towards the idea that reality is composed of a plurality of fundamental constituents, each with its own nature. In this way, you might consider Empedocles’ thought as a primitive form of ontological pluralism because he believed the world's constitution can be explained through multiple basic entities and forces, each with its own distinct way of being."},{"instruction":"using what Empedocles believed about pluralism make a real life scenario than can be easily understood","output":"Let's simplify Empedocles' ancient beliefs on the natural world and use them as a metaphor to understand a real-life scenario involving a community garden project. **Scenario: Community Garden Project** Imagine you're leading a community garden initiative in your neighborhood. The purpose of the project is to create a shared space where people can grow their own vegetables and flowers, promoting sustainability, community engagement, and healthy lifestyles. According to Empedocles's ideas, the functioning of this garden can be broken down into four essential \\"elements\\" that represent different groups or components of the project, and two forces that drive the project's dynamics. **The Four Elements:** 1. Earth - The Volunteers: Just like the element earth, the volunteers are the solid foundation of the garden. They are the hands that work the soil, plant the seeds, and maintain the garden. They bring stability and permanence to the project. 2. Water - The Resources: Water represents the resources needed for the garden to thrive, including actual water for irrigation, as well as seeds, tools, and funding. These are essential for growth and are as necessary to the garden as water is to life. 3. Air - The Knowledge and Expertise: Air symbolizes the knowledge and expertise contributed by experienced gardeners, local farmers, and environmentalists. This element is about the sharing of ideas, lessons, and techniques that circulate among the community, much like air moves and spreads. 4. Fire - The Community Engagement: Fire represents the passion and enthusiasm of the community, the drive that fuels the project. This includes the community gatherings, educational workshops, and the excitement that children and adults bring to the garden, igniting interest and participation. **The Two Forces:** 1. Love (Philia) - Collaboration and Unity: Empedocles saw Philia as a force that combined the elements. In the garden, love is reflected in the collaboration and unity among community members. It's what brings diverse people together, encourages them to share their resources, knowledge, and labor, and helps them to build strong relationships while working towards a common goal. 2. Strife (Neikos) - Diversity and Change: Strife, on the other hand, embodies the differences and occasional conflicts that arise in the community – differing opinions on garden planning, resource allocation, or methods of cultivation. It's a force that sometimes separates and diversifies, but it also leads to evolution and change, as the community navigates these challenges and adapts. **Real-Life Application:** The garden project begins with a few enthusiasts (Fire) who inspire others in the community to join. They gather Resources (Water) and recruit Volunteers (Earth) to prepare the land. Knowledge and Expertise (Air) are shared during the community workshops, enabling even novice gardeners to contribute effectively. As the project progresses, there might be disagreements about how to best use the land, which plants to prioritize, or how resources should be allocated. This Strife (Neikos) can cause friction in the community but, managed well, leads to constructive discussions and a more diverse and robust gardening approach. Collaboration and Unity (Love, Philia) become evident when the garden faces a challenge – say, a local drought or a pest invasion. The community comes together, pooling their resources, ideas, and labor to overcome the issue, strengthening their bonds, and ensuring the garden's longevity. In this scenario inspired by Empedocles' ideas, the community garden exemplifies a balance of diverse elements and forces – much like the cosmological system he described, where the interplay of elements and powers creates and sustains the dynamism of the world."},{"instruction":"what type of pluralism did empedocles have views on","output":"Empedocles is primarily associated with a sort of **cosmological pluralism**—not ontological pluralism in the contemporary sense—based upon the natural components that constitute the world. His views represent an early form of material pluralism in the sense that he postulated multiple foundational substances or elements rather than a single substance or principle (monism) as the basis of reality. Empedocles is famous for proposing that all matter is made up of a combination of four roots or elements (sometimes referred to as \\"roots\\")—earth, air, fire, and water. These elements were eternal, unchangeable, and mixed in different proportions to form all the diverse objects and materials in the world. In addition, there were two motivating forces or principles, Love (Philia) and Strife (Neikos), acting upon these elements to unify and separate them, respectively. This view contrasts with the earlier monistic philosophy of someone like Thales, who thought that a single substance, water, underpinned everything, or Anaximenes, who believed it was air. Empedocles' pluralistic approach was significant because it offered a multi-faceted explanation of the diversity of the material world. It effectively marked a departure from simpler monistic philosophies and anticipated later theories about the complexity of matter and the role of forces in physical processes. Therefore, Empedocles' concept of multiple elements and interacting forces could be considered a form of cosmological pluralism, reflecting an understanding that the world is neither made up of a single kind of thing nor governed by a singular process. However, when discussing Empedocles in the context of \\"pluralism,\\" it's important to remember that philosophical terms and categories have evolved, and fitting ancient thinkers into modern labels can sometimes be anachronistic or overly interpretative."},{"instruction":"using what anaxagoras believed about pluralism make a real life scenario than can be easily understood","output":"Anaxagoras was another pre-Socratic Greek philosopher who proposed a form of pluralism, but his theory was different from Empedocles. Anaxagoras introduced the concept of Nous (Mind or Intelligence) as the cosmic force that initiated and controlled the motion and mixture of what he considered to be the infinite basic constituents of the universe. These constituents were qualitatively the same everywhere (homoiomerous), meaning that everything contained portions of everything else, but the way in which they were mixed by the Nous produced the variety of perceived objects and phenomena. Here's a simple real-life scenario that can illustrate Anaxagoras's concepts in action, using the metaphor of a community kitchen: **Scenario: Community Kitchen** Imagine that a neighborhood decides to set up a community kitchen where locals can come to prepare and share meals. In this kitchen, you have an incredibly large variety of ingredients, representing Anaxagoras's belief in the infinite constituents of the universe. Each ingredient exists to some extent in every dish, much like Anaxagoras's idea that everything contains a part of everything else, but in different proportions. **The Infinite Constituents - Ingredients:** The community kitchen stores every imaginable ingredient, but in a manner that each dish made in the kitchen can theoretically contain a bit of every single ingredient available, just as Anaxagoras posited that every substance has a part of every other substance. **Nous (Mind) - The Chefs:** The chefs in our kitchen represent the Nous. They are the intelligent force that decides how to combine the ingredients. They initiate the mixing and cooking processes, just as the Nous in Anaxagoras's philosophy set the original motion of the basic constituents of the universe. **Real-Life Application:** Each individual comes to the community kitchen with their own ideas for a recipe – let's say one person wants to make a vegetable stew, another a fruit salad, and a third person a loaf of bread. Though the kitchen has a virtually limitless supply of ingredients, the resulting dishes will be vastly different due to the choices (Nous) made by each individual on which ingredients to use and how to mix them. Over time, the kitchen becomes a bustling place of creation, where an infinite number of dishes are prepared. Because ingredients are shared among all the dishes, you may find traces of the same ingredients across them – a bit of garlic in the bread, some flour in the stew, and a splash of vegetable broth in the salad. The proportion and combination of these ingredients—orchestrated by the chefs (Nous)—determine the unique flavor and character of each dish. Just like in Anaxagoras’s philosophy, despite the fundamental similarity of all things (the presence of all ingredients in all dishes), it is the intelligent combination and governance of these that create the observable diversity and uniqueness of each prepared dish within the community kitchen."},{"instruction":"compare it to the garden scenario and how the kitchen scenario differs","output":"Both the community garden and the community kitchen scenarios are metaphors designed to illustrate different philosophical views on the composition and functioning of the universe. While the two scenarios have in common their use of communal settings to represent the plurality of constituents in the world, they differ in their specifics, reflecting the contrasting philosophies of Empedocles and Anaxagoras. **Community Garden - Empedocles:** - **Elements and Forces:** The garden is based on the interplay of four basic \\"elements\\" (volunteers/earth, resources/water, knowledge/air, engagement/fire) and two driving \\"forces\\" (collaboration/love, diversity/strife). - **Distinct Components:** Each element in the garden is distinct and maintains its integrity (just as Empedocles' elements of earth, water, air, and fire stay unchanged). The composition of the garden changes due to the way these elements are combined and separated by the forces. - **Qualitative Differences:** The elements are qualitatively different from each other, each bringing unique attributes to the garden. - **Balance and Cycles:** The garden's success is based on a balance between the elements and the cyclical interplay of the forces that compel them. **Community Kitchen - Anaxagoras:** - **Infinite Constituents:** The kitchen is based on the concept that all dishes (objects) share common ingredients (constituents), but in different proportions and combinations. - **Mind (Nous):** The chefs act like the Nous, intelligently deciding how to mix the potentially infinite ingredients to create a variety of dishes from the same stock. - **Homoiomereity:** The ingredients are homoeomerous, meaning each dish has a bit of everything—reflecting Anaxagoras' idea that even a tiny grain of matter contains a part of everything. - **Dominant Qualities:** While everything is in everything, the dominant ingredients define the final dish (a principle analogous to Anaxagoras' notion that the prevalence of certain constituents in a mixture determines the nature of the substance). **Comparison:** - The garden scenario reflects an understanding of reality as a combination of a few distinct and unchanging elements that are acted upon by forces of unity and division (Empedocles), leading to various collaborative or conflicting outcomes. - The kitchen scenario represents the universe as comprising an infinite variety of basic ingredients that are all fundamentally similar, yet become discernable as distinct entities due to the portions and combinations dictated by an intelligent force (Anaxagoras). **Key Differences:** - **Nature of Constituents:** In the garden, there are a finite number of elements with clear distinctions, while in the kitchen, the ingredients represent an infinite number of indistinguishable basic constituents. - **Mechanism of Diversity:** Diversity in the garden arises from the combination and separation of different elements, whereas in the kitchen, diversity is the result of proportional differences and mixtures of the same fundamental ingredients. - **Governance:** The garden is governed by impersonal forces (love and strife), whereas the kitchen is governed by intelligent decision-making (the Nous/chefs). In essence, the garden scenario emphasizes qualitative differences and the independent roles of distinct actors and forces, while the kitchen scenario highlights infinite variety within a unified substrate and the central role of intelligent organization and governance."},{"instruction":"make the kitchen scenario shorter and easier to understand aswell as restating his philosophy of pluralism at the end","output":"**Simplified Community Kitchen Scenario:** Imagine a community kitchen where people come together to share their ingredients and cook meals. This kitchen has a vast supply of every ingredient you could think of; from spices to vegetables, meats to grains, the kitchen is stocked with them all. The variety of meals that can be prepared is virtually endless. In this kitchen, every dish created contains a little bit of many different ingredients. However, the taste of each dish is determined by which ingredients the cooks choose to use more of. If someone makes spaghetti, it might have tomatoes, ground beef, onions, garlic, and basil as the main ingredients, with a pinch of salt and pepper. Even though the kitchen had countless other ingredients, it's these specific ones, in these particular amounts, that define the dish. **Nous (Mind) - The Chefs:** The chefs in the kitchen are like directors — they decide which ingredients to use and in what amounts. Their choices bring order and individuality to each dish by strategically combining all the ingredients available to them. **Anaxagoras's Philosophy of Pluralism:** Anaxagoras's philosophy of pluralism proposed that everything in the universe is made up of tiny parts of everything else. However, the specific character and identity of an object are defined by which parts are present in larger amounts. The role of Nous (Mind) is crucial as it brings order and intelligence to this process, guiding the mixture of these parts into distinct objects or beings. In our kitchen scenario, the chefs (representing Nous) make sense of the vast array of ingredients (representing the infinite parts of the universe) by deciding what combination will create the dish they envision. Their intelligent choices transform a potential chaos of flavors into a delicious meal, showcasing Anaxagoras’s idea that intelligent organization is key to the diversity and order we see in the world."},{"instruction":"using Anaxagoras’s philosophy of pluralism how would a community exist","output":"Anaxagoras's philosophy suggests that everything is composed of infinitely divisible parts, with each part having properties of every other part. Additionally, an ordering intelligence (Nous) coordinates the mixture and organization of these parts. Translating this into a metaphor for community existence, we get the following scenario: **Community Illustration Based on Anaxagoras’s Philosophy:** In a community, imagine that the inhabitants represent the 'parts' of Anaxagoras's philosophy. Each person, like the infinite parts, carries within themselves a trace of the entire community’s talents, knowledge, beliefs, and experiences. This doesn't mean everyone is the same, but rather that everyone shares some commonality with everyone else. However, what distinguishes each person is the predominance of certain attributes or talents they possess, much like how Anaxagoras’s parts manifest different properties when mixed in different proportions. For instance, one person might be a more prominent musician (where the 'music' part dominates), another a skilled gardener (where the 'nature' part is more evident), and yet another a learned teacher (in whom the 'knowledge' part is strongest). Community Existence - Coordination and Governance: - **Governance (Nous):** To function harmoniously, this community needs governance or leadership to organize and utilize the abilities of its diverse members. This leadership (a council, a mayor, or some democratic body) aligns with Anaxagoras’s Nous. - **Community Projects:** When a project arises—be it organizing a festival, building a playground, or creating a neighborhood watch program—the governance body directs residents to contribute according to their skills and interests, though everyone could potentially contribute a small part to any task due to their shared commonalities. - **Adaptability and Innovation:** Over time, members of the community might learn from one another, further blending their skills (akin to Anaxagoras’s mixing of parts) and creating innovative solutions to challenges. This community, under the coordination of its governance, reflects Anaxagoras’s philosophy by demonstrating that while everything contains a bit of everything, it is the concentration and arrangement of specific talents and knowledge that give rise to the unique role each person plays. Just as the Nous in Anaxagoras's philosophy imparts order, so does the governance in a community, harnessing the variety of its members to create a functioning, dynamic, and integrated whole."},{"instruction":"an i use my certificate of naturalization to travel to canad","output":"Canadian law requires that all persons entering Canada must carry proof of both citizenship and identity.

Scientific studies have been conducted to determine if cow tipping is theoretically possible, with varying conclusions. All agree that cows are large animals that are difficult to surprise and will generally resist attempts to be tipped. Estimates suggest a force of between 3,000 and 4,000 newtons (670 and 900 pounds-force) is needed, and that at least four and possibly as many as fourteen people would be required to achieve this. In real-life situations where cattle have to be laid on the ground, or \`\`cast'', such as for branding, hoof care or veterinary treatment, either rope restraints are required or specialized mechanical equipment is used that confines the cow and then tips it over. On rare occasions, cattle can lie down or fall down in proximity to a ditch or hill that restricts their normal ability to rise without help. Cow tipping has many references in popular culture and is also used as a figure of speech."},{"instruction":"he grampians part of the great dividing range","output":"The Great Dividing Range, or the Eastern Highlands, is Australia's most substantial mountain range and the third longest land-based range in the world.

Madison, holding, however, that Congress could not grant unconstitutional power to the Court itself. The Constitution does not explicitly state that the courts may exercise judicial review; however, the notion that courts could declare laws unconstitutional was envisioned by the founding fathers. Alexander Hamilton, for example, mentioned and expounded upon the doctrine in Federalist No. 78. Originalists on the Supreme Court have argued that if the constitution doesn't say something explicitly it is unconstitutional to infer what it should, might or could have said. What this means is that the Supreme Court can nullify a congressional law. It is a huge check by the courts on the legislative authority and limits congressional power. In 1851, for example, the Supreme Court struck down provisions of a congressional act of 1820 in the Dred Scott decision. However, the Supreme Court can also extend congressional power through its constitutional interpretations."},{"instruction":"here an in and out in las vegas airpor","output":"Terminal 1 and Terminal 3 have their own parking garages.

Zero works as a Maverick Hunter, a soldier in charge of defeating Mavericks, robots who turned against humanity. He plays the role as X's comrade and best friend in the X series. The two, later accompanied by Axl, fight Sigma, Vile, and other enemies throughout the series. While in the first two titles he only assists X during gameplay, he becomes an optional character in X3. In Mega Man X4, Zero is one of two playable characters, along with X. In his scenario, Zero is haunted by nightmares of a shadowy figure (implied to be Wily) awakening him and giving him orders to destroy an unknown individual, and visions of ensuing carnage. Additionally, during his scenario, Sigma reminds him of the time that he led the Maverick Hunters, and the encounter between the two that led to a vicious battle that led to Sigma punching out the crystal on Zero's helmet, leading to Sigma later becoming infected with the Maverick Virus. Depending on the story development, Zero can be fought as a boss character in Mega Man X5. In Mega Man X6, Zero is not initially present in the game since he went missing in the end of Mega Man X5 during a fight against Sigma, and he becomes an optional character depending on how the story develops throughout the game.

The PNS consists of the nerves and ganglia outside the brain and spinal cord. The main function of the PNS is to connect the CNS to the limbs and organs, essentially serving as a relay between the brain and spinal cord and the rest of the body. Unlike the CNS, the PNS is not protected by the vertebral column and skull, or by the blood--brain barrier, which leaves it exposed to toxins and mechanical injuries. The peripheral nervous system is divided into the somatic nervous system and the autonomic nervous system. In the somatic nervous system, the cranial nerves are part of the PNS with the exception of the optic nerve (cranial nerve II), along with the retina. The second cranial nerve is not a true peripheral nerve but a tract of the diencephalon. Cranial nerve ganglia originated in the CNS. However, the remaining ten cranial nerve axons extend beyond the brain and are therefore considered part of the PNS. The autonomic nervous system is an involuntary control of smooth muscle and glands. The connection between CNS and organs allows the system to be in two different functional states: sympathetic and parasympathetic."},{"instruction":"an tobramycin and dexamethasone ophthalmic suspension be used for pink eye","output":"Tobramycin/dexamethasone (INNs, trade name Tobradex, Tobrason in Jordan) is a prescription medication in the form of eye drops and eye ointment, marketed by Alcon.

Rather than dissolving the band, Kiedis and Flea decided to recruit new members. Cliff Martinez was hired as the band's new drummer and Martinez's bandmate in The Weirdos, guitarist, Dix Denney was expected to replace Slovak. After a few rehearsals, however, the band felt he didn't fit and auditions continued. Their final candidates were guitarists Mark Nine and Jack Sherman, about whom the band knew nothing. After practicing with Sherman, they felt that he was the best fit because he worked well with Flea and Martinez. With Martinez and Sherman aboard, the band released their eponymous debut album on August 10, 1984. During the ensuing tour, continuing musical and lifestyle tension between Kiedis and Sherman complicated the transition between concert and daily band life. Sherman was fired soon after, with Slovak returning to the Chili Peppers in 1985 after growing tired of What Is This?. At one point, Chuck Biscuits filled in on drums during the 1985 tour. The band dismissed Cliff Martinez from the group in April 1986 due to personal differences and replaced him with founding member Jack Irons, who was out of work and finally separated from other commitments. During this period, however, Kiedis and Slovak had both developed serious drug addictions, which resulted in Kiedis being briefly fired that same year. At one performance, longtime friend and then Circle Jerks frontman, Keith Morris filled in for an absent Kiedis who was out scoring drugs while his band was playing a show. On June 25, 1988, Slovak died of a heroin overdose shortly after the completion of The Uplift Mofo Party Plan tour. Kiedis would then retreat into hiding, further fueling his drug habit and even skipping Slovak's funeral. After a band meeting with manager Lindy Goetz, Irons subsequently left the group, saying that he did not want to be part of a band where his friends were dying."},{"instruction":"do all master's degrees require a the","output":"Producing original research is a significant component of graduate studies in the humanities (e.g., English literature, history, philosophy), sciences (e.g., biology, chemistry, zoology) and social sciences (e.g., sociology).

Additionally, he confirmed that Spider-Man would not be appearing in the film but that a crossover with that character could happen in a future film. Since Venom's origin is not tied to Spider-Man in the film, as it is in the comics, it did not make sense for the filmmakers to add a version of Spider-Man's symbol to Venom's chest. However, they still wanted to be as accurate to the comic designs as possible and Fleischer noted an additional issue of an all-black character being difficult to see in night scenes, so Venom has a unique symbol on his chest instead in the film which is formed from the white veins of the symbiote. It was important for Fleischer to honor the violence of the character from the comics, where \`\`he bites people's heads off and eats brains.

Key among these \`\`basic features'', are the fundamental rights granted to individuals by the constitution. The doctrine thus forms the basis of a limited power of the Supreme Court to review and strike down constitutional amendments enacted by the Parliament which conflict with or seek to alter this \`\`basic structure'' of the Constitution. The basic structure doctrine applies only to constitutional amendments. The basic features of the Constitution have not been explicitly defined by the Judiciary, and the claim of any particular feature of the Constitution to be a \`\`basic'' feature is determined by the Court in each case that comes before it. The basic structure doctrine does not apply to ordinary Acts of Parliament, which must itself be in conformity with the Constitution."},{"instruction":"e powder and rice flour the same","output":"Rice flour (also rice powder) is a form of flour made from finely milled rice.

This can be achieved by smearing the sample onto the slide and then applying nigrosin (a black synthetic dye) or India ink (an aqueous suspension of carbon particles). After drying, the microorganisms may be viewed in bright field microscopy as lighter inclusions well-contrasted against the dark environment surrounding them. Note: negative staining is a mild technique that may not destroy the microorganisms, and is therefore unsuitable for studying pathogens."},{"instruction":"illegal to go on the black marke","output":"A black market, underground economy, or shadow economy is a clandestine market or transaction that has some aspect of illegality or is characterized by some form of noncompliant behavior with an institutional set of rules. If the rule defines the set of goods and services whose production and distribution is prohibited by law, non-compliance with the rule constitutes a black market trade since the transaction itself is illegal. Parties engaging in the production or distribution of prohibited goods and services are members of the illegal economy. Examples include the drug trade, prostitution (where prohibited), illegal currency transactions and human trafficking. Violations of the tax code involving income tax evasion constitutes membership in the unreported economy."},{"instruction":"does total internal reflection occur at the critical angle","output":"Total internal reflection is the phenomenon which occurs when a propagated wave strikes a medium boundary at an angle larger than a particular critical angle with respect to the normal to the surface. If the refractive index is lower on the other side of the boundary and the incident angle is greater than the critical angle, the wave cannot pass through and is entirely reflected. The critical angle is the angle of incidence above which the total internal reflection occurs. This is particularly common as an optical phenomenon, where light waves are involved, but it occurs with many types of waves, such as electromagnetic waves in general or sound waves. When a wave reaches a boundary between different materials with different refractive indices, the wave will in general be partially refracted at the boundary surface, and partially reflected. However, if the angle of incidence is greater (i.e. the direction of propagation is closer to being parallel to the boundary) than the critical angle -- the angle of incidence at which light is refracted such that it travels along the boundary -- then the wave will not cross the boundary, but will instead be totally reflected back internally. This can only occur when the wave in a medium with a higher refractive index (n) reaches a boundary with a medium of lower refractive index (n). For example, it will occur with light reaching air from glass, but not when reaching glass from air."},{"instruction":"an all states fly their flag at the same height as the us flag","output":"It is a common urban legend that the Texas flag is the only state flag that is allowed to fly at the same height as the U.S. flag. Allegedly, Texas has this right inherently (as a former independent nation) or because it negotiated special provisions when it joined the Union (this version has been stated as fact on a PBS website). However, the legend is false. Neither the Joint Resolution for Annexing Texas to the United States nor the Ordinance of Annexation contain any provisions regarding flags. According to the United States Flag Code, any state flag can be flown at the same height as the U.S. flag, but the U.S. flag should be on its right (the viewer's left). Consistent with the U.S. Flag Code, the Texas Flag Code specifies that the state flag should either be flown below the U.S. flag if on the same pole or at the same height as the U.S. flag if on separate poles."},{"instruction":"e senate members required to live in the state","output":"Article I, Section 3, of the Constitution, sets three qualifications for senators: (1) they must be at least 30 years old; (2) they must have been citizens of the United States for the past nine years or longer; and (3) they must be inhabitants of the states they seek to represent at the time of their election.

One possible reason for Jewish rejection of the book might be the textual nature of several early sections of the book that make use of material from the Torah; for example, 1 En 1 is a midrash of Deuteronomy 33. The content, particularly detailed descriptions of fallen angels, would also be a reason for rejection from the Hebrew canon at this period -- as illustrated by the comments of Trypho the Jew when debating with Justin Martyr on this subject: \`\`The utterances of God are holy, but your expositions are mere contrivances, as is plain from what has been explained by you; nay, even blasphemies, for you assert that angels sinned and revolted from God.''"},{"instruction":"does dexter get caught in season 1 episode 6","output":"While eating breakfast at Rita's house, Dexter is called to a crime scene, only to discover that it is the same salvage yard where he committed a double murder the previous night. He finds Valerie Castillo's (Valerie Dillman) body lying in the Airstream trailer where he killed her and her husband Jorge (José Zúñiga), despite having thrown the corpses into the ocean. He deduces that the \`\`Ice Truck Killer''--a serial killer with whom Dexter has a personal connection--dived underwater to retrieve the woman's body and plant it in the trailer. In the yard, LaGuerta, Sgt. James Doakes (Erik King) and Dexter's sister Debra (Jennifer Carpenter) discover a young Cuban boy, Oscar (Cesar Flores), hiding in the trunk of a car who claims to have seen somebody take Valerie into the trailer. He begins to fear discovery, and experiences his first nightmare: Debra is a serial killer with an identical modus operandi to Dexter. As the investigation proceeds, he attempts to shoot down each of his colleagues' leads on the case. When Debra asks him to read through her report on the killer, profiling a man sharing many of Dexter's characteristics, he second-guesses her theory and she is hurt. Worried about coming under suspicion, he throws all of his knives overboard from his boat, but while looking at the blood drops from his victims, he notices that Valerie's slide has a happy face etched into the blood. He realizes that this is a hint from the Ice Truck Killer, and plants Jorge's fingerprints and a dry drop of Valerie's blood onto a knife, which he hides in a car at the salvage yard. He convinces Doakes to organize another search of the yard, where an officer (Denver Dowridge) finds the knife. After successfully framing Jorge for Valerie's murder, Dexter discovers that Oscar's description of the man who \`\`saved'' him from Valerie is in fact Jesus Christ."},{"instruction":"does the trump hotel in vegas have a casino","output":"In November 2003, Trump denied that the project had been delayed or that it was suffering from a lack of financing.

The third U.S. President (1801--09), Thomas Jefferson, is featured on the obverse of the note. The reverse features an engraving of the painting Declaration of Independence by John Trumbull. Throughout the 2 bill's pre-1929 life as a large-sized note, it was issued as a United States Note, National Bank Note, silver certificate, Treasury or \`\`Coin'' Note and Federal Reserve Bank Note. When U.S. currency was changed to its current size, the 2 bill was issued only as a United States Note. Production went on until 1966, when the series was discontinued. Ten years passed before the 2 bill was reissued as a Federal Reserve Note with a new reverse design. Two-dollar bills are seldom seen in circulation as a result of banking policies with businesses which has resulted in low production numbers due to lack of demand. This comparative scarcity in circulation, coupled with a lack of public knowledge that the bill is still in production and circulation, has also inspired urban legends about its authenticity and value and has occasionally created problems for those trying to use the bill to make purchases."},{"instruction":"an a sub come back in in soccer","output":"In association football, a substitute is a player who is brought on to the pitch during a match in exchange for an existing player.

He had originally envisioned Supernatural as a movie. He later developed it as a TV series and spent a few years pitching it before it was picked up by The WB. The concept went through several phases before becoming the eventual product, shifting from the original idea of an anthology series to one of tabloid reporters driving around the country in a van \`\`fighting the demons in search of the truth''. Kripke wanted it to be a road trip series, feeling that it was the \`\`best vehicle to tell these stories because it's pure, stripped down and uniquely American...

Used broadly, it may cover any of the groups with elongated bodies and a primarily swimming mode of locomotion -- most commonly Caridea and Dendrobranchiata. In some fields, however, the term is used more narrowly and may be restricted to Caridea, to smaller species of either group or to only the marine species. Under the broader definition, shrimp may be synonymous with prawn, covering stalk-eyed swimming crustaceans with long narrow muscular tails (abdomens), long whiskers (antennae), and slender legs. Any small crustacean which resembles a shrimp tends to be called one. They swim forward by paddling with swimmerets on the underside of their abdomens, although their escape response is typically repeated flicks with the tail driving them backwards very quickly. Crabs and lobsters have strong walking legs, whereas shrimp have thin, fragile legs which they use primarily for perching."},{"instruction":"he red river a tributary of the mississipp","output":"The Red River, or sometimes the Red River of the South, is a major river in the southern United States of America.

The immediate shock of the cold causes involuntary inhalation, which if underwater can result in drowning. The cold water can also cause heart attack due to vasoconstriction; the heart has to work harder to pump the same volume of blood throughout the body. For people with heart disease, this additional workload can cause the heart to go into arrest. Inhalation of water (and thus drowning) may result from hyperventilation.

Most states require a motor vehicle owner to carry some minimum level of liability insurance. States that do not require the vehicle owner to carry car insurance include Virginia, where an uninsured motor vehicle fee may be paid to the state; New Hampshire, and Mississippi which offers vehicle owners the option to post cash bonds (see below). The privileges and immunities clause of Article IV of the U.S. Constitution protects the rights of citizens in each respective state when traveling to another. A motor vehicle owner typically pays insurers a monthly fee, often called an insurance premium. The insurance premium a motor vehicle owner pays is usually determined by a variety of factors including the type of covered vehicle, the age and gender of any covered drivers, their driving history, and the location where the vehicle is primarily driven and stored. Credit scores are also taken into consideration. Most insurance companies offer premium discounts based on these factors."},{"instruction":"has a goalkeeper ever won the ballon d'or","output":"Yashin appeared in four World Cups from 1958 to 1970, and in 2002 was chosen on the FIFA Dream Team of the history of World Cups.

Lewis also finds out that the Bowler Hat Guy is a grown-up version of Lewis' roommate, Michael \`\`Goob'' Yagoobian. Because he was kept awake by Lewis' work on the scanner, Goob fell asleep during an important Little League game and failed to make an important catch that cost the game. Goob became so bitter as a result that he was never adopted and remained in the orphanage long after it closed. Doris is \`\`DOR-15'', one of Lewis' failed and abandoned inventions. They both blamed Lewis for their misfortunes and decided to ruin his career by stealing the memory scanner and claiming credit for it. Leaving Lewis behind, they take off with the scanner, drastically altering the future to a world where Doris' clones have enslaved humanity. Lewis repairs the second time machine, confronts Doris and destroys her by promising to never invent her, restoring the future to its Utopian self.

Scientific studies have been conducted to determine if cow tipping is theoretically possible, with varying conclusions. All agree that cows are large animals that are difficult to surprise and will generally resist attempts to be tipped. Estimates suggest a force of between 3,000 and 4,000 newtons (670 and 900 pounds-force) is needed, and that at least four and possibly as many as fourteen people would be required to achieve this. In real-life situations where cattle have to be laid on the ground, or \`\`cast'', such as for branding, hoof care or veterinary treatment, either rope restraints are required or specialized mechanical equipment is used that confines the cow and then tips it over. On rare occasions, cattle can lie down or fall down in proximity to a ditch or hill that restricts their normal ability to rise without help.

As a life insurance policy it represents a contract between the insured and insurer that as long as the contract terms are met, the insurer will pay the death benefit of the policy to the policy's beneficiaries when the insured dies. Because whole life policies are guaranteed to remain in force as long as the required premiums are paid, the premiums are typically much higher than those of term life insurance where the premium is fixed only for a limited term. Whole life premiums are fixed, based on the age of issue, and usually do not increase with age. The insured party normally pays premiums until death, except for limited pay policies which may be paid-up in 10 years, 20 years, or at age 65.

This especially holds true for left-handed pitchers, as lefties are less common in a major-league lineup than righties. As a result, the most common use of the lefty-righty switch is when a right-handed pitcher is facing a left-handed batter. The manager of the defensive team will sometimes go to the bullpen, especially in close games where a reliever has already entered the game, and pull out a left-handed specialist to face the left-handed batter.

In the canonical Watson-Crick base pairing, adenine (A) forms a base pair with thymine (T) and guanine (G) forms one with cytosine (C) in DNA. In RNA, thymine is replaced by uracil (U). Alternate hydrogen bonding patterns, such as the wobble base pair and Hoogsteen base pair, also occur--particularly in RNA--giving rise to complex and functional tertiary structures. Importantly, pairing is the mechanism by which codons on messenger RNA molecules are recognized by anticodons on transfer RNA during protein translation. Some DNA- or RNA-binding enzymes can recognize specific base pairing patterns that identify particular regulatory regions of genes. Hydrogen bonding is the chemical mechanism that underlies the base-pairing rules described above. Appropriate geometrical correspondence of hydrogen bond donors and acceptors allows only the \`\`right'' pairs to form stably. DNA with high GC-content is more stable than DNA with low GC-content, but contrary to popular belief, the hydrogen bonds do not stabilize the DNA significantly and stabilization is mainly due to stacking interactions."},{"instruction":"windows defender an antivirus in windows 7","output":"Windows Defender, officially called Windows Defender Antivirus in Windows 10 Creators Update, is an anti-malware component of Microsoft Windows.

The device is considered to have sold fairly well in Japan, and still a crucial part of Sony's overall strategy in the region, while Sony has acknowledged that the device still has a very vocal and passionate user-base in the West as well, with the company still encouraging third party companies to create games for the device. At the 2016 Game Developers Conference, research analyst firm EEDAR estimated the sales of the Vita to be about at 10 million unit sold through the end of 2015. Multi-platform releases with the PS4 have also incidentally helped sustain the Vita's stream of software, even in the west, through 2016 and 2017; games receive a Vita version more to appeal to Japan's larger Vita user-base, and receive a PS4 version more to appeal to North America's larger user-base.

If oxygen is burnt faster than the extraneous atmosphere can leak into the room to replenish the burnt oxygen, the proportion of carbon monoxide rapidly increases. Since the monoxide can not escape, any person in the room will fatally succumb to the poisonous gas. Human senses only detect an excess of carbon dioxide, and death occurs before any occupants of the room sense there is something amiss. Most manufacturers recommend that a window or door be left cracked open. Kerosene heaters should not be left unattended, especially when sleeping. A kerosene heater, as any heater that uses organic fuel, can produce dangerously high amounts of soot and carbon monoxide when running out of oxygen. Failure to follow safety precautions could result in asphyxiation or carbon monoxide poisoning."},{"instruction":"does a butterfinger candy bar have peanut butter in","output":"Butterfinger is a candy bar created in 1923 in Chicago, Illinois by Otto Schnering, which currently is manufactured by Nestlé.

Ickes. It was created by the National Industrial Recovery Act in June 1933 in response to the Great Depression. It built large-scale public works such as dams, bridges, hospitals, and schools. Its goals were to spend 3.3 billion in the first year, and 6 billion in all, to provide employment, stabilize purchasing power, and help revive the economy. Most of the spending came in two waves in 1933-35, and again in 1938. Originally called the Federal Emergency Administration of Public Works, it was renamed the Public Works Administration in 1935 and shut down in 1944."},{"instruction":"he normal force equal to the force of gravity","output":"In a simple case such as an object resting upon a table, the normal force on the object is equal but in opposite direction to the gravitational force applied on the object (or the weight of the object), that is, N = m g (displaystyle N=mg) , where m is mass, and g is the gravitational field strength (about 9.81 m/s on Earth). The normal force here represents the force applied by the table against the object that prevents it from sinking through the table and requires that the table is sturdy enough to deliver this normal force without breaking. However, it is easy to assume that the normal force and weight are action-reaction force pairs (a common mistake). In this case, the normal force and weight need to be equal in magnitude to explain why there is no upward acceleration of the object. For example, a ball that bounces upwards accelerates upwards because the normal force acting on the ball is larger in magnitude than the weight of the ball."},{"instruction":"mr brooks based on a true story","output":"Mr. Brooks is a 2007 American psychological thriller film directed by Bruce A.

If salt is present, for example in seawater or salt spray, the iron tends to rust more quickly, as a result of electrochemical reactions. Iron metal is relatively unaffected by pure water or by dry oxygen. As with other metals, like aluminium, a tightly adhering oxide coating, a passivation layer, protects the bulk iron from further oxidation. The conversion of the passivating ferrous oxide layer to rust results from the combined action of two agents, usually oxygen and water."},{"instruction":"does disney world change the haunted mansion for christm","output":"Haunted Mansion Holiday, also known as Haunted Mansion Holiday Nightmare, is a seasonal overlay of the Haunted Mansion attraction at Disneyland and Tokyo Disneyland that blends the settings and characters of the original Haunted Mansion with those of Tim Burton's 1993 film The Nightmare Before Christmas.

The word is from Greek: ἀνεύρυσμα, aneurysma, \`\`dilation'', from ἀνευρύνειν, aneurynein, \`\`to dilate''. As an aneurysm increases in size, the risk of rupture increases, leading to uncontrolled bleeding. Although they may occur in any blood vessel, particularly lethal examples include aneurysms of the Circle of Willis in the brain, aortic aneurysms affecting the thoracic aorta, and abdominal aortic aneurysms. Aneurysms can arise in the heart itself following a heart attack, including both ventricular and atrial septal aneurysms."},{"instruction":"an the president terminate a treaty without senate approval","output":"A sole-executive agreement can only be negotiated and entered into through the president's authority (1) in foreign policy, (2) as commander-in-chief of the armed forces, (3) from a prior act of Congress, or (4) from a prior treaty.

The storm also brought prolonged gales and rough seas to the rest of the British Isles, as well as parts of Scandinavia. On 8 December, winds reached up to 165 mph (265 km/h) at elevated areas, with sustained wind speeds of up to 80 mph (135 km/h) reported across populous areas. The winds uprooted trees and resulted in the closure of many roads, bridges, schools and businesses. Overall, the storm was the worst to affect Scotland in 10 years, though a stronger storm occurred less than a month afterwards, on 3 January 2012. Although the follow-up storm was more intense, the winter of 2011/12 is usually remembered for Bawbag among Scots."},{"instruction":"an birds fly if their wings are clipped","output":"A 'light' symmetrical wing-clip will allow a bird to fly down and land safely while indoors. However such a clip may not prevent the bird from flying when outdoors, since lift is generated in proportion to wind speed. Many escaped birds which are recovered are found to have been clipped. So, while a light clip allows downward flight indoors, it does not prevent a bird gaining lift if it should escape outdoors. Conversely, a more severe clip will certainly render a bird flightless, but it increases the risk of injury if the bird falls and hits a hard surface. In addition to the physical effects of wing-clipping, there can be adverse behavioural effects. Birds use flight as an instinctive reflex action and as their first means of escaping any threat: they take to the air to fly upwards and away from the source of the threat; their fear then dissipates. Where this behaviour is prevented by wing-clipping, this innate reflex action is denied the bird, and its fear will not subside. This may cause behavioural problems for the afflicted bird. When a bird needs to reduce its speed during flight, it employs a 'reverse thrust' action by extending its wing at the wrist joint and using the drag of its primaries as air brakes. While the reduced function of the clipped bird's primaries prevent propulsion and therefore lift, this also reduces braking abilities, so clipped birds may crash-land at higher speeds than full-winged birds. Clipped birds should not be taken outdoors unrestrained, as even clipped birds have been known to fly away when spooked outdoors."},{"instruction":"was one of the russo brothers in winter soldier","output":"Additionally, Toby Jones, Maximiliano Hernández, and Garry Shandling reprise their roles from previous MCU films as Arnim Zola, Jasper Sitwell, and Senator Stern, respectively.

In the town of Chapel Hill, open carry is restricted to guns of a certain minimum size, under the theory that small, concealable handguns are more often associated with criminal activity. No permit is required to carry a handgun openly in North Carolina. In the court case of State v. Kerner(1921) the defendant ended up getting into some type of confrontation with another man. The defendant proceeded to walk back to his place of work, get his gun, and then return to the scene to fight. The defendant ended up being charged with \`\`carrying a concealed weapon'' and \`\`carrying his pistol off his premises unconcealed,'' which violated a local act applicable to Forsyth County and ended up being a misdemeanor. The defendant was taken to trial and the trial judge then dismissed the charge as unconstitutional. The state then appealed, and the supreme court affirmed. During court, the court stated at the beginning that the Second Amendment did not apply, because \`\`the first ten amendments to the United States Constitution are restrictions on the federal authority and not the states.'' Therefore, with that being said, it focused more on the state constitution. The state constitution states that: \`\`A well regulated militia, being necessary to the security of a free state, the right of the people to keep and bear arms, shall not be infringed.'' The court viewed the provision as protecting the right to carry arms in public. Forsyth County's local act was condemned and seen as distasteful, because it ended up putting a restriction on a persons right to carry a pistol, more so an unconcealed pistol. Although, the case of State v. Kerner helped/made more clear the allowance of openly carrying a pistol, it does not preclude all regulations regarding the carrying of firearms."},{"instruction":"do i have to use arc fault breaker","output":"AFCI breakers have been required for circuits feeding electrical outlets in residential bedrooms by the electrical codes of Canada and the United States since the beginning of the 21st century; the U.S. National Electrical Code has required them to protect most residential outlets since 2014, and the Canadian Electrical Code has since 2015.

By adopting A/RES/377 A, on 3 November 1950, over two-thirds of UN Member states declared that, according to the UN Charter, the permanent members of the UNSC cannot and should not prevent the UNGA from taking any and all action necessary to restore international peace and security, in cases where the UNSC has failed to exercise its 'primary responsibility' for maintaining peace. Such an interpretation sees the UNGA as being awarded 'final responsibility'--rather than 'secondary responsibility'--for matters of international peace and security, by the UN Charter. Various official and semi-official UN reports make explicit reference to the Uniting for Peace resolution as providing a mechanism for the UNGA to overrule any UNSC vetoes."},{"instruction":"an you breed a zebra and a horse","output":"A zebroid (also zedonk, zenkey, zorse, zebra mule, zonkey, and zebmule) is the offspring of any cross between a zebra and any other equine: essentially, a zebra hybrid.

Once used by as many as 32 U.S. states and the District of Columbia, Wisconsin is currently the longest-running state that offers a broad diploma privilege for admission to its state bar. New Hampshire has offered diploma privilege to students that attend the state's only law school since 2005 and the state of Iowa considered reinstating diploma privilege in 2014. Originally used as a method to foster the growth of formal legal education, the privilege started to fall into disuse early in the 20th century, in common with the tightening of requirements in other learned professions.

Instead, in this population, there is a suggestion of more injury in high arched feet. A 2005 study of Royal Australian Air Force recruits that tracked the recruits over the course of their basic training found that neither flat feet nor high arched feet had any impact on physical functioning, injury rates or foot health. If anything, there was a tendency for those with flat feet to have fewer injuries. Another study of 295 Israel Defense Forces recruits found that those with high arches suffered almost four times as many stress fractures as those with the lowest arches. A later study of 449 U.S. Navy special warfare trainees found no significant difference in the incidence of stress fractures among sailors and Marines with different arch heights."},{"instruction":"possible to have twins of different father","output":"Superfecundation is the fertilization of two or more ova from the same cycle by sperm from separate acts of sexual intercourse, which can lead to twin babies from two separate biological fathers. The term superfecundation is derived from fecund, meaning the ability to produce offspring. Heteropaternal superfecundation refers to the fertilization of two separate ova by two different fathers. Homopaternal superfecundation refers to the fertilization of two separate ova from the same father, leading to fraternal twins. While heteropaternal superfecundation is referred to as a form of atypical twinning, genetically, the twins are half siblings. Superfecundation, while rare, can occur through either separate occurrences of sexual intercourse or through artificial insemination."},{"instruction":"here anything higher than a platinum album","output":"Presently, an American RIAA-certified Gold record is a single or album that has sold 500,000 units (records, tapes or compact discs). The award was launched in 1958; originally, the requirement for a Gold single was one million units sold and a Gold album represented 1 million in sales (at wholesale value, around a third of the list price). In 1975, the additional requirement of 500,000 units sold was added for Gold albums. Reflecting growth in record sales, the Platinum award was added in 1976 for albums selling one million units, and singles selling two million units. The Multi-Platinum award was introduced in 1984, signifying multiple Platinum levels of albums and singles. In 1989, the sales thresholds for singles were reduced to 500,000 for Gold and 1,000,000 for Platinum, reflecting a decrease in sales of singles. In 1992, RIAA began counting each disc in a multi-disc set as one unit toward certification. Reflecting additional growth in music sales, the Diamond award was instituted in 1999 for albums or singles selling ten million units. Because of these changes in criteria, the sales level associated with a particular award depends on when the award was made."},{"instruction":"brazil the only country in south america that speaks portuguese","output":"Although Brazil is the only Portuguese-speaking nation in South America, it has the largest population, area and economy on the continent.

The rule was changed by the American League prior to the 1930 season and subsequently by the National League on December 12, 1930. Notably, the pre-1930 rule includes most of Babe Ruth's career. Early baseball statistics do not differentiate between home runs that cleared the fence on a bounce compared to those that did not. However, most baseball historians believe that Ruth likely missed out on more home runs that did not count due to other differences in the rules in place during his career compared to the number of home runs he likely hit off bounces."},{"instruction":"freddy my love in grease the movie","output":"Some of the songs were not present in the film; songs that appear in the film but not in the soundtrack are \`\`La Bamba'' by Ritchie Valens, \`\`Whole Lotta Shaking Going On'' by Jerry Lee Lewis, \`\`Alma Mater'', \`\`Alma Mater Parody'', and \`\`Rydell Fight Song''. \`\`Alone at a Drive-in Movie (instrumental)'', \`\`Mooning'', and \`\`Freddy My Love'' are not present in the film, although all three are listed in the end credits in-addition to being on the soundtrack.

Described by Variety as a \`\`Passion Project'' for Theron, she first came across the story five years prior, when her production company Denver and Delilah Productions was sent the then-unpublished graphic novel. Theron's interest in the first John Wick movie inspired her to get David Leitch, one of the directors, to helm the project. Leitch eventually left John Wick Chapter 2 to direct the film. According to Theron, the success of Mad Max: Fury Road helped guide the development of Atomic Blonde. The film features a bisexual subplot that was not in the original book. This came from writer Kurt Johnstad, who suggested it after Theron was \`\`thinking about how do you make this different from other spy movies''.

Despite being fully aquatic, the African dwarf frog still needs to be able to reach the surface to breathe. These amphibians are not great swimmers, so water currents should be kept low and deep tanks may pose a challenge to their ability to breathe. In the wild, the Congo forest floods yearly to a depth of 24 inches or more, so any depth less than that will be suitable. They also should be kept in an enclosure with a secure cover to prevent escape and plenty of hiding spaces as in the wild they tend to be prey to a variety of animals and open spaces cause skittish behavior. The frogs eat any smaller fish. The optimum water temperature is 75--82 °F. The pH of the water should be maintained between 6.5 and 7.5. These frogs cannot survive out of water for longer than 20 minutes in low humidity, as they dry out."},{"instruction":"will there be a season three of doctor doctor","output":"On 11 October 2017, the series was renewed for a third season at Nine's upfronts."},{"instruction":"does a walk count as a plate appearance","output":"In baseball, an at bat (AB) or time at bat is a batter's turn batting against a pitcher. An at bat is different from a plate appearance. A batter is credited with a plate appearance regardless of what happens during his turn at bat. A batter is credited with an at bat only if that plate appearance does not have one of the results enumerated below.

The blue eye occurs within a white spot, where melanin is absent from the skin and hair (see Leucism). These species include the cat, particularly breeds such as Turkish Van, Turkish Angora, Khao Manee and (rarely) Japanese Bobtail. These so-called odd-eyed cats are white, or mostly white, with one normal eye (copper, orange, yellow, green), and one blue eye. Among dogs, complete heterochromia is seen often in the Siberian Husky and few other breeds, usually Australian Shepherd and Catahoula Leopard Dog and rarely in Shih Tzu. Horses with complete heterochromia have one brown and one white, gray, or blue eye--complete heterochromia is more common in horses with pinto coloring. Complete heterochromia occurs also in cattle and even water buffalo. It can also be seen in ferrets with Waardenburg syndrome, although it can be very hard to tell at times as the eye color is often a midnight blue."},{"instruction":"was rabbit from winnie the pooh a real rabb","output":"Rabbit is a character in the fictional world of the book series and cartoons Winnie-the-Pooh.

The United States does not have an official language, but 32 state governments out of 50 have declared English to be one, or the only, official language. The government of Louisiana offers services and most documents in both English and French, as does New Mexico in English and Spanish. The government of Puerto Rico, a U.S. territory, operates almost entirely in Spanish, even though its official languages are Spanish and English.

Once appointed, justices have lifetime tenure unless they resign, retire, or are removed from office. Each justice has a single vote in deciding the cases argued before it; the chief justice's vote counts no more than that of any other justice. However, the Chief Justice--when in the majority--decides who writes the court's opinion. Otherwise, the senior justice in the majority assigns the writing of a decision. In modern discourse, the justices are often categorized as having conservative, moderate, or liberal philosophies of law and of judicial interpretation. While a far greater number of cases in recent history have been decided unanimously, decisions in cases of the highest profile have often come down to just one single vote, thereby exposing the justices' ideological beliefs that track with those philosophical or political categories. The Court meets in the Supreme Court Building in Washington, D.C. Its law-enforcement arm, the United States Marshals Service, is under the oversight of the U.S. Department of Justice."},{"instruction":"a mass air flow sensor the same as a map sensor","output":"Engines that use a MAP sensor are typically fuel injected. The manifold absolute pressure sensor provides instantaneous manifold pressure information to the engine's electronic control unit (ECU). The data is used to calculate air density and determine the engine's air mass flow rate, which in turn determines the required fuel metering for optimum combustion (see stoichiometry) and influence the advance or retard of ignition timing. A fuel-injected engine may alternatively use a mass airflow sensor (MAF sensor) to detect the intake airflow. A typical naturally aspirated engine configuration employs one or the other, whereas forced induction engines typically use both; a MAF sensor on the intake tract pre-turbo and a MAP sensor on the charge pipe leading to the throttle body."},{"instruction":"an i carry a gun in texas without a license","output":"There is no legal statute specifically prohibiting the carry of a firearm other than a handgun (pre-1899 black powder weapons, and replicas of such, are not legally firearms in Texas).

In primary and secondary schools, a D is usually the lowest passing grade, however, there are some schools that consider a C the lowest passing grade, so the general standard is that anything below a 60 or 70 is failing, depending on the grading scale. In college and universities, a D is considered to be an unsatisfactory passing grade.

The new piece replaces the pawn, as part of the same move. The choice of new piece is not limited to pieces previously captured , thus promotion can result in a player owning, for example, two or more queens despite starting the game with one. Pawn promotion, or the threat of it, often decides the result in an endgame. Since the queen is the most powerful piece, the vast majority of promotions are to a queen. Promotion to a queen is often called queening; promotion to any other piece is referred to as underpromotion (Golombek 1977)."},{"instruction":"al expenditure in the us is equal to consumption expenditure plus investme","output":"In economics, aggregate expenditure (AE) is a measure of national income.

In an interview, MacFarlane said that everyone can basically understand him, but they ignore him or just think to themselves \`\`oh how cute'' when he talks. However at the 2011 ComicCon panel, he compared this to Wile E. Coyote in the old Merrie Melodies cartoons. MacFarlane went on to say that Brian always hears Stewie, and more recently so does Chris, but the writers usually strive for Peter, Lois, and Meg not to hear him. Once Stewie leaves the house, the question of who can hear him depends very much on the story. MacFarlane also states that these rules can be broken for the sake of comedy, so this could change from one episode to another. In \`\`Inside Family Guy'', Peter apologizes to the family, to which Stewie comments: \`\`Oh that's nice of you to say''. Peter replies: \`\`Thank you, Stewie, who I can understand'', referring to the ongoing discussion whether or not family members, other than Brian, are able to understand him. However, Peter's response seems to be a part of the episode's offset setting, where everyone is out of character."},{"instruction":"harming from sons of anarchy a real place","output":"Charming is a fictional town in the television series Sons of Anarchy."},{"instruction":"do odd interstate routes run primarily north and south","output":"The route numbers and locations are coordinated by the American Association of State Highway and Transportation Officials (AASHTO).

The draft came to an end when the United States Armed Forces moved to an all-volunteer military force. However, the Selective Service System remains in place as a contingency plan; all male civilians between the ages of 18 and 25 are required to register so that a draft can be readily resumed if needed.

If an evacuated glass tube is equipped with two electrodes and a voltage is applied, glass behind the positive electrode is observed to glow, due to electrons emitted from and traveling away from the cathode (the electrode connected to the negative terminal of the voltage supply). They were first observed in 1869 by German physicist Johann Wilhelm Hittorf, and were named in 1876 by Eugen Goldstein Kathodenstrahlen, or cathode rays. In 1897, British physicist J.J. Thomson showed that cathode rays were composed of a previously unknown negatively charged particle, which was later named the electron. Cathode ray tubes (CRTs) use a focused beam of electrons deflected by electric or magnetic fields to create the image on a television screen."},{"instruction":"do glow plugs stay on all the time","output":"In older generation diesel-engine vehicles, unlike in a gasoline-engine vehicle, for a 'cold start' the operator did not simply turn the key to the \`\`start'' position and have the engine immediately start. Instead, the operator activated the glow plug(s) for a time first. Early diesels used the 'Thermostart' type glowplug in the inlet manifold. These take 20 seconds to achieve working temperature and the vehicle operator had to manually time (or guess) when the 20 seconds had elapsed. With in-cylinder glow plugs, technological improvements included a warning light on the dash to indicate how long the preheating should last. The preheating phase was also made to be automatically activated when the operator turned the key to the \`\`on'' position for a long duration; the glowplug relay switches the glowplugs on, and a light (see picture at right) on the instrument cluster illuminates. This process is called \`\`pre-heating'' or \`\`glowing''. Many modern diesels automatically activate their glow plugs when the operator unlocks the vehicle or opens the door to the car, thus simplifying the process and shortening the time the operator has to wait before the engine will start. According to Bosch: \`\`Older engines with Thermostart manifold plugs used a glow period of up to 20 seconds whereas more modern engines use around a 6 to 8 second heat period and provide after glow at a reduced voltage.''"},{"instruction":"here any chi chi's still ope","output":"One lone restaurant was still open in Utah until 2011."},{"instruction":"a navy bean the same as great norther","output":"Other white beans include cannellini, 'Great Northern', the lima beans known as \`\`butter beans'', and the runner bean."},{"instruction":"does every wounded soldier get a purple hear","output":"The Purple Heart is awarded in the name of the President of the United States to any member of the Armed Forces of the United States who, while serving under competent authority in any capacity with one of the U.S. Armed Services after April 5, 1917, has been wounded or killed.

Life Is Strange was specified as an analogue look at human identity in contrast to Remember Me, the digital view of the same theme. Running on an improved version of Unreal Engine 3, it makes use of the tools and special effects like lighting and depth of field engineered for Remember Me as well as subsequent advances. Visual effects like post-processes, double exposure and overlapping screen space particles were used as an artistic approach to be displayed while the lead character rewinds time. The textures seen in the game were entirely hand painted, adapted to achieve what art director Michel Koch called \`\`impressionistic rendering''. Elements were adjusted based on player feedback, with influences like The Walking Dead, Gone Home and Heavy Rain in mind. The Catcher in the Rye was an additional source of inspiration, whose protagonist Holden Caulfield shares a surname with Max, the game's lead. The characters were created using known archetypes, at first to establish an entry point for the player, and then to subvert them. For the sake of serving the realism, the supernatural elements were designed as a metaphor for the characters' inner conflict, and experts were consulted to tackle the subject of teen suicide."},{"instruction":"air china and china southern airlines the same","output":"China Southern Airlines Company Limited is an airline headquartered in Baiyun District, Guangzhou, Guangdong Province, China.

They passed the first round of the playoffs five times (1975--76, 2005--06, 2011--12, 2013-14 and 2014-15). Additionally, the Clippers have never won league or Conference titles, let alone play in either title game in their 45-year history they have never been to a Western Conference Finals, and the 30-year drought between winning a playoffs round is the longest in league history. They also have only eleven seasons with a winning percentage of .500 or better, and as a result, in their April 17, 2000 issue, the Sports Illustrated had three Clippers fans on the cover that stated \`\`The worst franchise in sports history''. However, with the additions of Blake Griffin and Chris Paul, they made steady progress as a title contender in recent years. They won their first division title in the 2012-13 season, their 43rd year in the league, and repeated the following year.

As a life insurance policy it represents a contract between the insured and insurer that as long as the contract terms are met, the insurer will pay the death benefit of the policy to the policy's beneficiaries when the insured dies. Because whole life policies are guaranteed to remain in force as long as the required premiums are paid, the premiums are typically much higher than those of term life insurance where the premium is fixed only for a limited term. Whole life premiums are fixed, based on the age of issue, and usually do not increase with age. The insured party normally pays premiums until death, except for limited pay policies which may be paid-up in 10 years, 20 years, or at age 65. Whole life insurance belongs to the cash value category of life insurance, which also includes universal life, variable life, and endowment policies."},{"instruction":"an cars run on anything other than g","output":"An alternative fuel vehicle is a vehicle that runs on a fuel other than traditional petroleum fuels (petrol or Diesel fuel); and also refers to any technology of powering an engine that does not involve solely petroleum (e.g. electric car, hybrid electric vehicles, solar powered).

Additionally, live studio audiences produce an energy from which the actors can feed off, as well as push them to perform to the best of their abilities. Unlike relying on the ideal chuckles that a laugh track consistently provides, actors have to work for the laughs. A studio audience can also provide volunteers, a visual backdrop and discussion participants. On some game shows, contestants are taken from the studio audience, such as with The Price Is Right."},{"instruction":"e red pandas part of the raccoon family","output":"The red panda is the only living species of the genus Ailurus and the family Ailuridae.

This can include simultaneously employing hand gestures, movement, orientation of the fingers, arms or body, and facial expressions to convey a speaker's ideas. Sign languages often share significant similarities with their respective spoken language, such as American Sign Language (ASL) with American English. Grammar and sentence structure, however, may vary to encourage efficiency and fluidity in speaking. It is important to note that just because a spoken language is intelligible transnationally, such as English in the United States and the United Kingdom, does not mean that the sign languages from those regions are as well; ASL and British Sign Language (BSL) were formed independently and are therefore not mutually intelligible."},{"instruction":"pyruvate converted to acetyl coa in the mitochondrial matrix","output":"Following glycolysis, the citric acid cycle is activated by the production of acetyl-CoA.

Richard Poole at the start of Series 3. Clues from Poole's investigation helped Goodman reveal the motive and the killer's identity; Goodman commented that Poole had 'solved his own murder.' Goodman stayed on in Saint Marie after his wife Sally announced she would not be joining him on the Caribbean island. He became the chief inspector on the island, and took to Poole's old habit of announcing the murderer in front of all the suspects and his police team. He is very clumsy, often forgetting things or finding himself with nothing to take notes on; he embraces Caribbean life much more than his predecessor. He has a knack at being able to solve murders instantly, looking at the meaning of small details, much like his predecessor. He fell in love with his detective sergeant, Camille Bordey, often coming close to revealing his feelings for her. He tried to stop her leaving when she requested a job in Paris, but conceded. He shared a passionate kiss with her just before she left the island. Her successor, Florence Cassell, also managed to get along with Goodman, often sharing jokes and they dedicate a drink to Camille after their first solved case."},{"instruction":"does the electron (or any other object) behave like a particle or like a wave","output":"Through the work of Max Planck, Albert Einstein, Louis de Broglie, Arthur Compton, Niels Bohr and many others, current scientific theory holds that all particles exhibit a wave nature (and vice versa).

British and American terms also can coexist in Canadian English to various extents, sometimes with new nuances in meaning; a classic example is holiday (British) often used interchangeably with vacation (American), though, in Canadian speech, the latter can more narrowly mean a trip elsewhere and the former can mean general time off work. Canadian English morpho-syntactic features also affect their vocabulary; this includes their tendency to use the possessive \`\`have'' as opposed to \`\`have got'' or \`\`got,'' which differs from both British English and American English. In addition, the vocabulary of Canadian English also features some words that are seldom (if ever) found elsewhere. A good resource for these and other words is the Dictionary of Canadianisms on Historical Principles, which is currently being revised at the University of British Columbia in Vancouver, British Columbia. The Canadian public appears to take interest in unique \`\`Canadianisms'': words that are distinctively characteristic of Canadian English--though perhaps not exclusive to Canada; there is some disagreement about the extent to which \`\`Canadianism'' means a term actually unique to Canada, with such an understanding possibly overstated by the popular media. As a member of the Commonwealth of Nations, Canada shares many items of institutional terminology and professional designations with the countries of the former British Empire -- for example, constable, for a police officer of the lowest rank, and chartered accountant."},{"instruction":"was godsmack an alice in chains cover band","output":"Many people think the band's name stemmed from another band's song, but according to Erna, the band's name came from a small and personal incident. \`\`I was making fun of somebody who had a cold sore on his lip and the next day I had one myself and somebody said, 'It's a godsmack.'

These would almost certainly be stimulated during beak trimming, indicating strongly that acute pain would be experienced. Behavioural evidence of pain after beak trimming in layer hen chicks has been based on the observed reduction in pecking behavior, reduced activity and social behavior, and increased sleep duration. In Japanese quail, beak-trimming by cauterization caused lower body weights and feed intake in the period just after beak trimming. Beak trimmed Muscovy ducks spent less time engaging in beak-related behaviours (preening, feeding, drinking, exploratory pecking) and more time resting than non-trimmed ducks in the days immediately post-trim. These differences disappeared by 1 week post-trim. At 1 week post-trim the trimmed ducks weighed less than non-trimmed ducks, but this difference disappeared by 2 weeks post-trim. It is, however, unclear if the above changes in behaviour arise from pain or from a loss of sensitivity in the beak. Pecking force has been found to decrease after beak trimming in adult hens possibly indicating that hens are protecting a painful area from further stimulation. However, pecking force did not differ between chicks with or without minor beak-trims at 2 to 9 days of age, suggesting that chicks with minor beak-trims do not experience pain from the beak."},{"instruction":"was south carolina the first state to secede from the unio","output":"South Carolina was the first state to secede from the Union (Dec. 1860), and was one of the founder members of the Confederacy (Feb. 1861).
