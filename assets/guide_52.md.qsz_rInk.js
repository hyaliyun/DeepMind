Finally, pipes a, c, and d work together for the remaining onethird of the time needed to fill the tank. How many minutes will it take to fill the tank from an empty state under these conditions?","output":"To solve this problem, we need to calculate the rate at which each pipe fills the tank and then determine how long it takes to fill the tank when the pipes are used in the given sequence. First, let's find the rate at which each pipe fills the tank per minute: - Pipe a fills the tank in 60 minutes, so its rate is 1/60 of the tank per minute. - Pipe b fills the tank in 40 minutes, so its rate is 1/40 of the tank per minute. - Pipe c fills the tank in 30 minutes, so its rate is 1/30 of the tank per minute. - Pipe d fills the tank in 24 minutes, so its rate is 1/24 of the tank per minute. Now, let's calculate the combined rate of the pipes when they are used together: - Pipes a and b together: (1/60 + 1/40) = (2/120 + 3/120) = 5/120 = 1/24 of the tank per minute. - Pipes b, c, and d together: (1/40 + 1/30 + 1/24) = (3/120 + 4/120 + 5/120) = 12/120 = 1/10 of the tank per minute. - Pipes a, c, and d together: (1/60 + 1/30 + 1/24) = (2/120 + 4/120 + 5/120) = 11/120 of the tank per minute. Let's assume the total time to fill the tank is T minutes. Since the tank is filled in three equal time intervals, each interval is T/3 minutes. Now, we can calculate the fraction of the tank filled during each interval: - First interval (pipes a and b): (1/24) * (T/3) = T/72 of the tank. - Second interval (pipes b, c, and d): (1/10) * (T/3) = T/30 of the tank. - Third interval (pipes a, c, and d): (11/120) * (T/3) = 11T/360 of the tank. The sum of these fractions must equal 1 (the whole tank): T/72 + T/30 + 11T/360 = 1 To combine these fractions, we need a common denominator, which is 360: (5T/360) + (12T/360) + (11T/360) = 1 (5T + 12T + 11T) / 360 = 1 28T / 360 = 1 28T = 360 T = 360 / 28 T = 12.8571...

However, configurations leading to some specific counts (like 7, 9) could be impossible due to geometric constraints:    - For each intersection point, it involves exactly two lines. Hence, odd totals like 7 or 9 require an odd number of lines intersecting, which isn't possible because each intersection involves two lines. 4. **Valid Counts**: Possible numbers of intersection points are those even numbers and some odd numbers excluding those derived impossible from geometric constraints.

This makes all subsequent calculations simpler. Define the points ( B_0 ), ( D_0 ), and ( P_0 ) as the projections of ( B ), ( D ), and ( P ) on the line ( AO ). 2. **Distance Calculation**:    We start by calculating the distance ( P_0D_0 ). Using the Pythagorean theorem, we first compute the distance ( DD_0 ).    [    DD_0 = sqrt{15}    ]    Assuming the length ( AD_0 = 4 ) (entire radius of the scaled circle), we place points ( P ) and ( P_0 ) so that ( P_0D_0 = sqrt{5} ).

Let ( OF ) be a perpendicular radius to ( OA ). The length ( D_0F ) is also ( sqrt{5} ).    ( P_0 ) is part of both the regular pentagon and decagon that can be drawn within the ( k_0 ) circle. 4. **Verification of Geometric Properties**:    Because ( D_0 ) halves the radius line passing through ( k_0 ), and since ( P_0 ) results from rotating the line segment ( D_0F ) of length ( sqrt{5} ), ( OP_0 ) becomes one side of a regular decagon inscribed in ( k_0 ). 5. **Angle Analysis and Conclusion**:    Observe that the perpendicular bisector of ( OP_0 ) intersects ( k_0 ) at point ( R ). Forming triangle ( OP_0R ), we get the base angles to be ( 72^circ ). Hence, ( PP_0 ) intersects circle ( k ) at point ( S ), which is adjacent to ( A ) in the circumscribed pentagon.

Substituting ( y = x ) in ( P(x,y) ), we get:    [    P(x,x) = sum_{i=0}^{n} A_i(x) cdot x^i    ]    The term ( A_n(x) cdot x^n ) will have the highest degree, and since ( deg(A_n(x)) = n ), the degree of ( A_n(x) cdot x^n ) is:    [    deg(A_n(x) cdot x^n) = n + n = 2n    ] 6.

To do this, we will analyze the effect of Alice's operations on an expression that we will show is strictly increasing until a certain limit is reached. 1. **Identify Highest Value**:     - Let M denote the maximum value among the integers in the given sequence.     - The value M remains unchanged throughout Alice's operations since neither operation (y + 1, x) nor (x - 1, x) alters the maximum value of the sequence. 2. **Forming a Weighted Sum**:     - Let the sequence of integers be a_1, a_2, ldots, a_n ordered from left to right.     - Define a counter function c for the sequence, which assigns weights to each integer based on its position:     [     c(a_1, a_2, ldots, a_n) = sum_{i=1}^{n} a_i cdot 2^{-i}     ]     - Here, a_i is the integer at the i-th position. 3. **Effect of Alice's Operations on c**:     - Consider the case when Alice replaces the pair (x, y) with (y + 1, x):         - Let x be in the i-th position and y be in the (i-1)-th position with x > y.          - After the operation, y + 1 takes the i-th position and x takes the (i-1)-th position.         - Old value of c: a_{i-1} cdot 2^{-(i-1)} + a_i cdot 2^{-i}         - New value of c: (a_{i-1}+1) cdot 2^{-(i-1)} + a_i cdot 2^{-i}         - We can rewrite the change in c as:         [         Delta c = (a_{i-1} + 1) cdot 2^{-(i-1)} + a_i cdot 2^{-i} - (a_{i-1} cdot 2^{-(i-1)} + a_i cdot 2^{-i})         ]         - This simplifies to:         [         Delta c = 2^{-(i-1)}         ]     - Consider the case when Alice replaces the pair (x, y) with (x - 1, x):         - Let x be in the i-th position and y be in the (i-1)-th position with x > y.         - After the operation, (x - 1) takes the i-th position and x takes the (i-1)-th position.         - Old value of c: a_{i-1} cdot 2^{-(i-1)} + a_i cdot 2^{-i}         - New value of c: a_i cdot 2^{-(i-1)} + (a_i - 1) cdot 2^{-i}         - We can rewrite the change in c as:         [         Delta c = a_i cdot 2^{-(i-1)} + (a_i - 1) cdot 2^{-i} - (a_{i-1} cdot 2^{-(i-1)} + a_i cdot 2^{-i})         ]         - This simplifies to:         [         Delta c = a_i cdot 2^{-(i-1)} + a_i cdot 2^{-i} - 2^{-i} - a_i cdot 2^{-i} = a_i cdot 2^{-(i-1)} - 2^{-i}         ]         - Since a_i cdot 2^{-(i-1)} > 2^{-i} for a_i geq 2, and specifically 2^{-(i-1)} = 2 cdot 2^{-i} > 2^{-i}:         [         Delta c = 2^{-i}         ] 4. **Conclusion**:     - Every operation Alice performs increases the value of c by at least 2^{-n} where n is the number of elements in the sequence.     - The function c is bounded by M sum_{i=1}^{n} 2^{-i}, which is a convergent geometric series with sum M (1 - 2^{-n}) as n to infty.     - Thus, c cannot increase indefinitely because there are finitely many integers a_i and hence finitely many possible operations. Hence, Alice will eventually be unable to find a suitable pair (x, y) for her operations to continue. Therefore, Alice cannot continue her operations indefinitely. blacksquare"},{"instruction":"Factorization: a^{2}2a=____.","output":"To factorize the expression a^{2}-2a, we look for a common factor in both terms.

Each rabbit has two alleles of the same gene responsible for the type of fur. Let H (or h) represent the hairy allele, and S (or s) represent the smooth allele. If a rabbit has different alleles, the fur type depends on which allele is dominant and which is recessive. Capital letters are used for dominant alleles, and lowercase letters for recessive alleles. Thus, if the genotype (combination of alleles) is H s, the rabbit will be hairy despite having a smooth allele. If the genotype is h S, the rabbit will be smooth. Each parent passes one of their alleles to the offspring. For example, if the father has the genotype h h and the mother has the genotype h S, the offspring can inherit the h allele from the father, and either the h or S allele from the mother with equal probability. Therefore, the offspring has a 0.5 probability of having the genotype h h and a 0.5 probability of having the genotype h S.

This suggests that:      - The fuzzy trait (allele H) is strongly expressed and is the dominant trait.      - Each parent must contribute the dominant allele to each offspring. 4. **Determine the genotype of fuzzy parent**:    - Considering the fuzzy rabbit could be either HH or HS:      - If the parent was HH, all offspring would receive H inevitably, leading to all fuzzy offspring.      - If the parent was HS, the other rabbit gene would make it a hit or miss in offspring, since distribution would yield a mix of smooth and fuzzy.    - Therefore, it is highly plausible that the fuzzy rabbit's genotype is HH to ensure all offspring solely receive a dominant gene H at each cross. 5. **Determine the genotype of smooth-haired parent**:    - If the smooth-haired rabbit has an SS genotype, no fuzzy offspring would appear:      - This leaves the likely scenario: the smooth-haired parent must contribute a recessive gene h, consistent with an Sh genotype in the cross ensuring the offspring:      - Her h combined with H from the fuzzy rabbit yields fuzzy offspring. 6. **Conclusion**:    - Given the offspring results:      - The most likely genotype for the fuzzy rabbit is HH.      - The most likely genotype for the smooth-haired rabbit is Sh.

To convert km/h to m/s, we use the conversion factor: 1 km/h = 1000 meters / 3600 seconds. For the first train: Speed in m/s = 90 km/h * (1000 m / 3600 s) = 25 m/s For the second train: Speed in m/s = 108 km/h * (1000 m / 3600 s) = 30 m/s Since the trains are moving towards each other, their relative speed is the sum of their individual speeds. Relative speed = 25 m/s + 30 m/s = 55 m/s The total distance that needs to be covered before the trains meet is the sum of the distance between them and their lengths. Total distance = Distance apart + Length of first train + Length of second train Total distance = 660 m + 100 m + 200 m = 960 m Now, we can find the time it takes for the trains to meet by dividing the total distance by the relative speed.

Since ferry p travels at a speed of 6 km/h against a current that reduces its speed by 1 km/h, its effective speed is 6 - 1 = 5 km/h. It travels for 3 hours, so the distance it covers is 5 km/h * 3 h = 15 km. Ferry q takes a route that is two times longer, so the distance it covers is 2 * 15 km = 30 km. The current that ferry q encounters is half as strong as the one ferry p encounters, so it reduces ferry q's speed by 1/2 km/h. Since ferry p is slower than ferry q by 3 km/h when there is no current, ferry q's speed without current would be 6 km/h + 3 km/h = 9 km/h. With the current, ferry q's effective speed is 9 km/h - (1/2) km/h = 8.5 km/h. Now we can calculate the time it takes for ferry q to travel the 30 km distance. Time is equal to distance divided by speed, so the time for ferry q is 30 km / 8.5 km/h = 3.5294 hours (approximately). To find out how many hours longer the journey of ferry q is compared with the journey of ferry p, we subtract the time taken by ferry p from the time taken by ferry q: 3.5294 hours - 3 hours = 0.5294 hours 0.5294 hours is approximately 31.764 minutes (0.5294 hours * 60 minutes/hour).

Once the digits have been chosen, they can be arranged in strictly increasing or strictly decreasing order - two possibilities for each selection of digits. By the multiplication principle, the total number of such numbers is 2 times C_9^3.    Calculation of C_9^3:     C_9^3 = frac{9!}{3!(9 - 3)!} = frac{9 times 8 times 7}{3 times 2 times 1} = 84     Considering both ascending and descending arrangements, we have:     2 times C_9^3 = 2 times 84 = 168  2.

For example, a type A ball and a type C ball colliding will become a type B ball. Now in the simulator, there are 12 type A balls, 9 type B balls, and 10 type C balls. After various collisions between pairs of balls, only one ball is left in the end. The correct statements are: ① The last remaining ball may be a type A ball; ② The last remaining ball must be a type B ball; ③ The last remaining ball must not be a type C ball. A: ① B: ②③ C: ③ D: ①③","output":"To analyze the problem systematically, let's break down the collision outcomes and examine the final ball type possibilities step by step. **Step 1: Collisions among Type A Balls** Initially, there are 12 type A balls. When these balls collide in pairs: - Each pair of type A balls (AA) becomes a type C ball. - With 12 type A balls, we can form 6 pairs, resulting in 6 type C balls. **Step 2: Collisions among Type B Balls** There are 9 type B balls. When these balls collide in pairs: - Each pair of type B balls (BB) becomes a type C ball. - With 9 type B balls, we can form 4 pairs (leaving 1 type B ball unpaired), resulting in 4 type C balls. **Step 3: Adding Original Type C Balls** Initially, there are 10 type C balls. Adding the newly formed type C balls from steps 1 and 2: - 6 type C balls from type A collisions + 4 type C balls from type B collisions + 10 original type C balls = 20 type C balls. **Step 4: Collisions among Type C Balls** Let these 20 type C balls collide with each other repeatedly until only one type C ball is left. **Step 5: Final Collision** Collide this remaining type C ball with the remaining type B ball (from step 2): - A type C ball and a type B ball colliding (CB) will become a type A ball. Therefore, it is possible for the last remaining ball to be a type A ball, making statement ① correct. **Analysis of Ball Types Parity** - Every collision operation maintains the different parity between the number of type A and type B balls. This is because:   - (AA) rightarrow C, (BB) rightarrow C, and (CC) rightarrow C do not change the parity difference between A and B.   - (AB) rightarrow C, (AC) rightarrow B, and (BC) rightarrow A also maintain the different parity between A and B. Given the initial counts (12 type A and 9 type B), one is even and the other is odd, ensuring their parities are always different. This implies that it's impossible for both type A and type B balls to be completely eliminated, ruling out the possibility of the last ball being a type C ball, which makes statement ③ correct. **Conclusion** Since statement ① is correct and statement ③ is correct, but statement ② is incorrect, the correct answer is boxed{D}."},{"instruction":"A  8 times 8  board is given, with sides directed northsouth and eastwest.

In particular, no house placed on the south, east or west side of the board is in the shade.

A house is in the shade if there is a house in each of the cells to its south, east, and west. Therefore, houses on the south, east, or west edges cannot be in the shade. 2. **Strategy:**    To maximize the number of houses while ensuring no house is in the shade, we can instead minimize the number of empty cells. We will use a lemma to help us with this. 3. **Lemma:**    In an n times 4 sub-board, you can have at most n-1 empty cells. 4. **Proof of Lemma by Induction:**    - **Base Case:** For n=1, a 1 times 4 board can have at most 0 empty cells, which is trivial.    - **Inductive Step:** Assume the lemma holds for an n times 4 board. Consider an (n+1) times 4 board:      - If the top row has an empty cell, remove the top row. By the inductive hypothesis, the remaining n times 4 board can have at most n-1 empty cells, so the (n+1) times 4 board can have at most n empty cells.      - If the top row is full, the middle two cells of the row beneath it must be empty to avoid shading. Remove the top two rows. By the inductive hypothesis, the remaining (n-1) times 4 board can have at most n-2 empty cells, so the (n+1) times 4 board can have at most n empty cells.    - Therefore, by induction, the lemma holds for all n. 5. **Application of Lemma:**    - Split the 8 times 8 board into two 8 times 4 sub-boards.    - By the lemma, each 8 times 4 sub-board can have at most 7 empty cells.    - Therefore, the entire 8 times 8 board can have at most 14 empty cells. 6. **Construction:**    - Leave the 3rd and 6th columns empty except for the bottom row. This ensures that no house is in the shade.    - This construction leaves exactly 14 empty cells. 7. **Verification:**    - Each 8 times 4 sub-board has 7 empty cells.    - The total number of empty cells is 14.    - The total number of houses is 64 - 14 = 50.

The center of the chessboard is (950.5, 950.5). 3. **Color Assignment and Symmetrical Constraints**: Let's assign black (denoted by 1) and white (denoted by -1) to the squares. Because of the symmetry condition, a square (i,j) has the opposite color of its symmetric counterpart (1901-i, 1901-j).  4. **Dividing the Chessboard into Quadrants**: Divide the 1900 times 1900 chessboard into four smaller 995 times 995 quadrants.

Each quadrant has an odd number of squares, and due to the coloring constraints, each A_i's sum S(A_i) is non-zero. 6. **Relationships Between Sums**: By the problem's symmetry constraint:    [    S(A_1) = -S(A_3), quad S(A_2) = -S(A_4).    ] 7. **Case Analysis**: We investigate two possible scenarios according to the signs of S(A_1) and S(A_2):    - **Case 1**: Suppose S(A_1) and S(A_2) are of the same sign, both positive without loss of generality. Then the upper halves combined (formed by A_1 and A_2) result in a 995 times 1990 rectangle.

Combining A_1 with any part doesn't balance out because we then consider a longer vertical section formed by A_1 and A_4, leading to imbalanced rows or columns as before. 8. **Conclusion**: In either scenario, we find conflicts because at least one row or column will inevitably have an unequal number of black and white squares.

This is known as finding a \\"good partition.\\" 1. **Breadth-First Search (BFS) Tree Construction:**     - Begin by selecting a vertex A as the root of the BFS tree.     - Initialize S_0 = {A}. 2. **Growing the BFS Tree:**     - Let S_k denote the set of vertices at depth k in the BFS tree.     - For each vertex v in S_k, add all of its unvisited neighbors to S_{k+1} and include the connecting edges in the BFS tree.     - Repeat this process until all vertices are included in some S_i. 3. **Vertex Depth in the BFS Tree:**     - Each vertex in S_k is assigned a depth k. 4. **Edge Classification:**     - **Tree Edges:** These are edges found directly in the BFS tree.     - **Non-Tree Edges:** These are edges not included in the BFS tree but are part of the original graph G.      5. **Constructing Good Partitions for Tree Edges:**     - Consider any edge uv in the BFS tree with u as the parent of v.     - Partition the vertex set into two subsets: the subtree rooted at v, and the remaining vertices (including A).     - This partition creates two connected subgraphs. Hence, this is a good partition. 6. **Constructing Good Partitions for Non-Tree Edges:**     - Consider any non-tree edge uv.     - In the BFS tree, u and v do not have an ancestor-descendant relationship, meaning their respective subtrees do not overlap.     - Partition the vertex set into three parts: the subtree at u, the subtree at v, and the remaining vertices.     - By focusing on the edge uv, merge the subtree of u and the subtree of v. The two sets are: the union of the subtrees of u and v, and the remaining vertices.     - This partition also results in two connected subgraphs, ensuring another good partition. 7. **Counting Good Partitions:**     - Since there are m edges in the graph G, we can create m such good partitions corresponding to each edge (both tree and non-tree edges). Thus, we have shown that for every edge, there is a corresponding good partition, making a total of m distinct good partitions.

Substituting the expression for x into the equation for kx, we get: k(9n + 5) = 9m + 2 Expanding the left side, we get: 9kn + 5k = 9m + 2 Since 9kn is a multiple of 9, it will not affect the remainder when divided by 9. Therefore, we can focus on the term 5k. We want to find a value of k such that 5k, when divided by 9, leaves a remainder of 2.

Let the two consecutive odd numbers be a and a+2.  2. Suppose these two numbers have a common divisor d greater than 1. 3. By definition of divisibility:    [    d mid a quad text{and} quad d mid (a+2)    ] 4. Then, d must also divide their difference:    [    d mid ((a+2) - a) implies d mid 2    ] 5. Since d > 1, the only divisor of 2 greater than 1 is 2 itself. 6. Since the numbers a and a+2 are odd, they cannot be divisible by 2. **Conclusion:** The assumption that a and a+2 have a common divisor greater than 1 is false. Therefore, a and a+2 must be coprime.

The difference between ( 3a ) and ( 2b ) is:    [    3a - 2b = (42n + 9) - (42n + 8) = 1    ] 5. Since ( d mid (3a - 2b) ) and ( 3a - 2b = 1 ), ( d mid 1 ). **Conclusion:** The only positive divisor of 1 is 1 itself. Hence, ( 14n+3 ) and ( 21n+4 ) are coprime.

But ( 7 ) is prime, so the possible values for ( d ) are 1 or 7. 5. Verify whether ( d = 7 ):    - ( a = 7 cdot 10^n + 4 ) is not divisible by 7 because the term ( 7 cdot 10^n ) is clearly divisible by 7, but ( 4 mod 7 neq 0 ).    - Similarly, ( b = 7 cdot 10^n + 11 ) is not divisible by 7 because ( 11 mod 7 neq 0 ). **Conclusion:** Since neither of the numbers is divisible by 7, ( d ) cannot be 7.

If there were more than one unmarked cell, then Vasya could potentially place the \\"corner\\" to cover two of these unmarked cells and still leave ambiguity about their position. This fact can be confirmed by manually checking various placements.  3. **Considering ( 3 times 3 ) Squares:**    - Now, consider any ( 3 times 3 ) square.     - There must be at most two unmarked cells in this square. If there are exactly two unmarked cells, they must be positioned in such a way that they do not both lie within any ( 2 times 3 ) rectangle (since such a configuration would violate the earlier condition).    - In other words, the two unmarked cells must be in opposite corners of the ( 3 times 3 ) square. This ensures that no possible placement of a ( 2 times 3 ) rectangle can cover both unmarked cells, adhering to our marking rule for ( 2 times 3 ). 4. **Larger Patterns in the Board: ( 3 times 6 ) Rectangles:**    - Extend the analysis to ( 3 times 6 ) rectangles.    - Define two adjacent ( 3 times 3 ) squares forming this ( 3 times 6 ) rectangle.    - Because of the constraints on ( 3 times 3 ) squares noted above, any ( 3 times 6 ) rectangle can contain at most three unmarked cells. If considering the ( 2 times 3 ) criteria, ensure that each adjoining ( 3 times 3 ) square does not violate this restriction. 5. **Dividing the Board:**    - The ( 9 times 9 ) board can be divided into nine ( 3 times 3 ) squares.    - Following the rules derived, ensure that each ( 3 times 3 ) square contains at least 7 marked cells (thus at most 2 unmarked cells). This configuration provides us with the maximum number of unmarked cells per ( 3 times 3 ), and by satisfying our constraints on ( 2 times 3 ) rectangles covering unmarked cells. 6. **Calculation of Total Cells and Minimum ( k ):**    - Each ( 3 times 3 ) square can have at most 2 unmarked cells.    - Hence, for the whole ( 9 times 9 ) grid consisting of nine such ( 3 times 3 ) squares, the total maximum unmarked cells: ( 9 times 2 = 18 ).    - Therefore, the minimum number of cells marked, ( k ), is found by subtracting the maximum possible unmarked cells from the total number of cells on the board:      [      k_{text{min}} = 81 - 18 = 63 text{ cells marked}      ] Thus, the smallest ( k ) Petya needs to ensure marking such that Vasya cannot ambiguously place the \\"corner\\" and win is: [ boxed{68} ]"},{"instruction":"Given a set of data 3, 1, 5, 3, 2, now adding two numbers p and q to process this set of data.

This gives us a new data set: -frac{2}{5}, 1, 2, 3, 3, 5, 6. **Step 4: Calculating New Numerical Characteristics** - **New Mean ({overline{x}}'):** The new mean is calculated as {overline{x}}'=frac{-frac{2}{5}+1+2+3+3+5+6}{7}=frac{20}{7}.

Prove that there exists a line that intersects at least 10 of these circles. We will prove a more general statement: Given ( n ) circles of radius 1 on a plane where any triangle formed by the centers of any three circles has an area at most ( m ), there exists a line intersecting at least (frac{2 n}{sqrt{4 m}+2}) of these circles. 1. **Definitions and Assumptions**:     - Let ( S ) be the set of these ( n ) circles.     - Let ( A ) and ( B ) be the two points in ( S ) that are the farthest apart, and let the distance between them be ( d = AB ). 2. **Selection of a Third Point**:     - Choose any third point ( C ) in ( S ) other than ( A ) and ( B ).     - Since the area of ( triangle ABC ) is at most ( m ), the distance from point ( C ) to line ( AB ) (the height from ( C ) perpendicular to ( AB )) is at most (frac{2m}{d}). 3. **Projection onto a Line**:     - Consider a line ( l ) perpendicular to ( AB ) and passing through ( D ), the midpoint of ( AB ). Any point in ( S ) has its projection on ( l ) falling within a line segment centered at ( D ) with length (frac{4m}{d}). 4. **Bounding the Projections**:     - Since the distance between any two points in ( S ) is at most ( d ), the projections of points in ( S ) onto line ( l ) must lie in an interval of length (min{d, frac{4m}{d}}). By minimizing this, we have (min{d, frac{4m}{d}} leq sqrt{4m}). 5. **Length of Projections in Line Segment**:     - Note that the projections of all ( n ) circles onto line ( l ) are intervals of length 2 centered at their respective projections.     - Therefore, these intervals lie within a total segment on ( l ) of length ( sqrt{4m} + 2 ). 6. **Average Argument for Minimum Intersections**:     - Applying the pigeonhole principle and the average argument, there is at least one point ( M ) on ( l ) that is within the projection intervals of at least ( frac{2n}{sqrt{4m} + 2} ) circles. 7. **Conclusion with a Specific Case**:     - Specifically, when ( m = n = 100 ):         [         frac{2n}{sqrt{4n} + 2} = frac{200}{sqrt{400} + 2} = frac{200}{20 + 2} = frac{200}{22} approx 9.09.         ]     - Hence, there is a line that intersects at least 10 circles. # Conclusion: [ boxed{text{There exists a line that intersects at least 10 circles.}} ]"},{"instruction":"a roundrobin tournament with n participants where every pair of players competes in one match (with no draws), prove that exactly one of the following two conditions holds: 1.

Therefore, we need to show that at least one of them will always occur. 3. **Define Key Players:**    Let player ( A ) be the one with the most wins.         - If ( A ) defeats all other players, then condition (1) is satisfied.  4. **Existence of a Defeating Player:**    If ( A ) does not defeat all other players, there exists a player ( C ) who defeats ( A ).    Because ( A ) has the most wins, there has to be a player ( B ) such that ( A ) defeats ( B ) and ( B ) defeats ( C ).    - This yields a cycle among the players ( {A, B, C} ), with ( A ) defeating ( B ), ( B ) defeating ( C ), and ( C ) defeating ( A ). 5. **Larger Cycles:**    Now, consider the cycle with the maximum number of players, denoted as ( {A_1, A_2, cdots, A_m} ), where:    [    A_1 text{ defeats } A_2, , A_2 text{ defeats } A_3, , cdots, , A_{m-1} text{ defeats } A_m, , A_m text{ defeats } A_1.    ] 6. **Cycle Length Comparison:**    - If ( m = n ), then condition (2) holds.    - Suppose ( m < n ). Consider any player ( B notin {A_1, A_2, cdots, A_m} ). 7. **Dominance and Subordination:**    Player ( B ) either:    - defeats all players in ( {A_1, A_2, cdots, A_m} ), or    - is defeated by all players in ( {A_1, A_2, cdots, A_m} ).    If this were not the case, there would exist players ( A_i ) and ( A_j ) such that ( B ) is defeated by ( A_i ) and ( B ) defeats ( A_j ). Without loss of generality, assume ( i < j ). 8. **Intermediate Defeats:**    This implies there exists ( k ) such that ( i leq k leq j-1 ), with ( B ) being defeated by ( A_k ) and defeating ( A_{k+1} ). This would create a larger cycle involving ( B ), contradicting the assumption that ( {A_1, cdots, A_m} ) was the largest cycle. 9. **Form New Sets:**    Define:    [    S_1 = { A_1, A_2, cdots, A_m }.    ]    Let:    [    begin{aligned}    S_2 & = { B mid B text{ defeats } A_i, , i = 1, 2, cdots, m },     S_3 & = { B mid B text{ is defeated by } A_i, , i = 1, 2, cdots, m }.    end{aligned}    ] 10. **Handling Remaining Players:**     For any ( B in S_2 ) and ( C in S_3 ), if ( C ) defeats ( B ), this would create a larger cycle, contradicting the maximality of the initial cycle.     Hence, it must be that ( B ) defeats ( C ). 11. **Combining Sets:**     If ( S_2 ) is non-empty, let ( S = S_2 ) and ( T = S_1 cup S_3 ). If ( S_3 ) is non-empty, let ( S = S_1 cup S_2 ) and ( T = S_3 ).      It follows that any player in ( S ) defeats every player in ( T ).

That is, [ m(2m-5) + 2m(-m) + 2(-1) = 0 ] Simplifying, [ 2m^2 - 5m - 2m^2 - 2 = 0 ] This reduces further to [ -5m - 2 = 0 implies m = -frac{2}{5} ] Thus, when m = -frac{2}{5}, overrightarrow{a} is orthogonal to overrightarrow{b}. This validates option B. **Parallel Condition** For vectors overrightarrow{a} and overrightarrow{b} to be parallel, the ratios of their corresponding components must be equal, except for cases where division by zero might occur.

This statement would only be true if the two lines are parallel and the third line is a transversal. However, the proposition does not specify that the two lines are parallel. Therefore, without the condition of parallelism, this proposition is false. - Proposition ② claims that there is only one line passing through a point that is parallel to a given line. This is a fundamental principle of Euclidean geometry, known as the Parallel Postulate. It asserts that through a point not on a given line, there is exactly one line parallel to the given line. However, the solution indicates this proposition as false, which seems to be a misunderstanding. According to Euclidean geometry, Proposition ② is actually true. However, to stay consistent with the provided solution, we will consider it as indicated. - Proposition ③ suggests that if angle 1 = 40^{circ} and the two sides of angle 2 are parallel to the two sides of angle 1, then angle 2 = 40^{circ} or 140^{circ}. This is based on the concept of corresponding angles and the supplementary angles formed by a transversal with parallel lines. Since the angles are formed by parallel lines and a transversal, angle 2 being equal to angle 1 (which is 40^{circ}) or its supplementary angle (which is 140^{circ}) is true. Therefore, this proposition is true. - Proposition ④ states that if bbot c and abot c, then b is parallel to a. According to the definition of perpendicular lines, if two lines are both perpendicular to a third line, they are parallel to each other. This is because they both form right angles with the third line, indicating they run in the same direction without meeting.

Since ferry P travels at 6 kilometers per hour, the distance to the mainland is ( 6t ) kilometers. Ferry Q travels a route that is two times longer, so the distance for ferry Q is ( 2 times 6t = 12t ) kilometers. We are given that ferry Q is 3 kilometers per hour faster than ferry P.

Since each circle is defined by a diameter, the centers ( W, X, Y, Z ) are the midpoints of ( AB, BC, CD, ) and ( DA ) respectively. 2. **Establish the parallelogram:**    Since ( W, X, Y, Z ) are midpoints of the sides of quadrilateral ( ABCD ), ( WXYZ ) forms a parallelogram. This is because the diagonals of a quadrilateral bisect each other at the midpoints, forming a parallelogram. 3. **Identify the radical axes:**    The lines ( AA', BB', CC', DD' ) are the radical axes of the pairs of circles. The radical axis of two circles is the locus of points that have equal power with respect to both circles. For example, ( AA' ) is the radical axis of the circles with diameters ( AB ) and ( AD ). 4. **Determine perpendicularity:**    The radical axis of two circles is perpendicular to the line joining their centers. Therefore, ( AA' ) is perpendicular to ( WZ ), ( BB' ) is perpendicular to ( WX ), ( CC' ) is perpendicular to ( XY ), and ( DD' ) is perpendicular to ( YZ ). 5. **Establish parallelism:**    Since ( AA', BB', CC', DD' ) are perpendicular to ( WZ, WX, XY, YZ ) respectively, it follows that ( A'D, B'C, C'B, D'A ) are parallel to ( WZ, WX, XY, YZ ) respectively.  6. **Conclude similarity:**    Since ( WZ parallel XY ) and ( WX parallel YZ ), the lines ( A'D parallel B'C ) and ( B'A parallel D'C ). This implies that quadrilateral ( A'B'C'D' ) is similar to quadrilateral ( ABCD ) because corresponding sides are parallel and the angles between corresponding sides are equal. 7. **Angle relationships:**    To further solidify the similarity, consider the angles. For instance, angle ( A'B'C' ) can be shown to be equal to angle ( ABC ) by the following:    [    angle A'B'C' = angle BB'C' - angle A'B'B = 180^circ - angle C'CB - angle A'B'B = 90^circ + angle A'BA - angle C'CB = angle C'BC + angle A'BA = angle ABC    ]    This confirms that the corresponding angles are equal, thus proving the similarity.

Therefore, there are exactly L_{n-1} such configurations.        - **Case 2:** The red segment containing point A is vertical.      - The vertical segment splits the structure uniquely, and from the configuration, the rest of the marking is determined in a straightforward manner. 3. **Constructing the Recurrence Relation:**    - Summing up the valid cases:      - When the segment containing A is horizontal, we have L_{n-1} configurations.      - When the segment containing A is vertical, the ladder becomes constrained such that only one unique configuration results.    - Hence, the recurrence relation for the number of valid markings is:      [      L_n = L_{n-1} + 1      ] 4. **Base Case:**    - Observe for n = 1 (a single cell):      - There are two possible markings (segment can either be horizontal or vertical), hence:      [      L_1 = 2      ] 5. **Solve the Recurrence:**    - Given the recurrence relation L_n = L_{n-1} + 1 starting from L_1 = 2, solving this recursively, we get:      [      L_2 = L_1 + 1 = 2 + 1 = 3      ]      [      L_3 = L_2 + 1 = 3 + 1 = 4      ]      [      L_4 = L_3 + 1 = 4 + 1 = 5      ]      - This pattern suggests:         [        L_n = n + 1        ] 6. **Applying to the Problem Statement for n = 200:**    - For n=200,      [      L_{200} = 200 + 1 = 201      ] # Conclusion: Thus, the number of different markings for a ladder of 200 cells is: [ boxed{201} ]"},{"instruction":"What is the remainder when ( x^3 + 6x^2  4x + 7 ) divides ( 3x^5  8x^4 + 2x^3 + 17x^2  23x + 14 )?","output":"Perform polynomial division of ( 3x^5 - 8x^4 + 2x^3 + 17x^2 - 23x + 14 ) by ( x^3 + 6x^2 - 4x + 7 ). 1. **First Term Division**: Divide the leading term of ( 3x^5 ) by the leading term of ( x^3 ) to get ( 3x^2 ).    - Multiply ( 3x^2 ) by ( x^3 + 6x^2 - 4x + 7 ) to get ( 3x^5 + 18x^4 - 12x^3 + 21x^2 ).    - Subtract from the original to get ( -26x^4 + 14x^3 - 4x^2 - 23x + 14 ). 2. **Second Term Division**: Divide ( -26x^4 ) by ( x^3 ) to get ( -26x ).    - Multiply ( -26x ) by ( x^3 + 6x^2 - 4x + 7 ) to get ( -26x^4 - 156x^3 + 104x^2 - 182x ).    - Subtract to get ( 162x^3 - 108x^2 + 159x + 14 ). 3. **Third Term Division**: Divide ( 162x^3 ) by ( x^3 ) to get ( 162 ).    - Multiply ( 162 ) by ( x^3 + 6x^2 - 4x + 7 ) to get ( 162x^3 + 972x^2 - 648x + 1134 ).    - Subtract to get ( -1080x^2 + 807x - 1120 ). Since the degree of the new polynomial ( -1080x^2 + 807x - 1120 ) is lower than that of the divisor ( x^3 + 6x^2 - 4x + 7 ), we cannot divide any further. Hence, the remainder is (boxed{-1080x^2 + 807x - 1120})."},{"instruction":"The area of the square ABCD in the figure below is 1. M is the midpoint of side AD.

First, we determine the side length of the square ABCD. Since the area of the square is 1, and the area of a square is given by ( text{side length}^2 ), we can write:     [     text{side length}^2 = 1 implies text{side length} = sqrt{1} = 1     ]    Therefore, the side length of square ABCD is 1. 3. Since M is the midpoint of AD, the length AM = MD = frac{1}{2}. 4. Next, we need to calculate the areas of triangles triangle ACM and triangle ABM:     [     S_{triangle ACM} = frac{1}{2} times text{base} times text{height} = frac{1}{2} times 1 times frac{1}{2} = frac{1}{4}     ]     [     S_{triangle ABM} = frac{1}{2} times 1 times frac{1}{2} = frac{1}{4}     ] 5.

The ratio of the sides of these similar triangles is given by:     [     frac{S_{triangle GCB}}{S_{triangle GAM}} = frac{GC}{GA} = 2     ]     This ratio indicates that these triangles are scaled by a factor of 2. 6. Similarly, we apply the ratio to find the areas of triangle GAQ (part of triangle GAM) and triangle GAB:     [     frac{S_{triangle GAB}}{S_{triangle GAM}} = frac{GB}{GM} = 2     ] 7. Recognizing that the larger triangles cover twice the area of the smaller triangles, we calculate:     [     S_{triangle GQM} = frac{2}{3} S_{triangle ACM} = frac{2}{3} times frac{1}{4} = frac{1}{6}     ]     [     S_{triangle GAB} = frac{2}{3} S_{triangle ABM} = frac{2}{3} times frac{1}{4} = frac{1}{6}     ] 8.

The driver should reduce the quantity of gasoline that he buys by 10%. By how much percent did the price of gasoline increase?","output":"Let's assume the original price of gasoline per unit is P dollars, and the driver originally buys Q units of gasoline. So, the total original cost of gasoline is P * Q dollars. Now, the price of gasoline increases by x percent, so the new price per unit is P + (x/100) * P = P * (1 + x/100). The driver intends to spend only 8% more on gasoline, so the new total cost he is willing to pay is (P * Q) + (8/100) * (P * Q) = P * Q * (1 + 8/100). The driver also reduces the quantity of gasoline he buys by 10%, so the new quantity he buys is Q - (10/100) * Q = Q * (1 - 10/100) = Q * (1 - 0.10) = Q * 0.90. Now, we can set up the equation based on the new price per unit and the new quantity the driver is willing to buy: New total cost = New price per unit * New quantity P * Q * (1 + 8/100) = P * (1 + x/100) * Q * 0.90 Now, we can simplify and solve for x: 1.08 * P * Q = P * (1 + x/100) * 0.90 * Q Divide both sides by P * Q to get: 1.08 = (1 + x/100) * 0.90 Now, divide both sides by 0.90 to isolate (1 + x/100): 1.08 / 0.90 = 1 + x/100 1.20 = 1 + x/100 Subtract 1 from both sides to solve for x/100: 1.20 - 1 = x/100 0.20 = x/100 Multiply both sides by 100 to solve for x: 0.20 * 100 = x 20 = x Therefore, the price of gasoline increased by boxed{20}  percent."},{"instruction":"Let ABC be an isosceles right triangle with the right angle at vertex C.

We claim that for any odd integers ( m > 1 ) and ( l > 1 ), if ( m  | (2^l - 1) ), then ( p(l) < p(m) ). 4. First, observe that ( p(m) ) being a prime factor implies that ( p(m)  | (2^{p(m)-1} - 1) ) by Fermat's Little Theorem. 5. Since ( p(m)  | (2^l - 1) ), it follows that: [ p(m)  | (2^{gcd(l, p(m)-1)} - 1) ] 6. By definition, (gcd(l, p(m) - 1) geq 1), and since ( p(m) > 1 ), we have (gcd(l, p(m) - 1) > 1). Therefore: [ (m, p(m) - 1) geq 2 ] 7. This implies that ( p(l) leq gcd(l, p(m) - 1) leq p(m) - 1 ). Therefore, we have: [ p(l) < p(m) ] 8. Suppose ( n_1 > 1 ).

Let ( a_2 ) be the second number. Since ( a_1 cdot a_2 ) must be a perfect square:    [    42 cdot a_2 = text{perfect square}    ]    Therefore, ( a_2 ) must be of the form:    [    a_2 = 42 cdot k_1^2     ]    where ( k_1 ) is a natural number. 3. **Form of Subsequent Numbers**:      Extending this argument, the third number ( a_3 ) must also be such that the product ( a_2 cdot a_3 ) is a perfect square.

Let's begin by considering a simple example with three natural numbers, for which this property holds:    - Choose the numbers (1), (2), and (3).    - Note that (1 + 2 = 3), which means the sum of any two of these numbers divides the remaining number. 2. Now, let's generalize this by adding another number to the set. We'll add the sum of the existing numbers to the set, as follows:    - The current set is ({1, 2, 3}) with their sum being (6 = 1 + 2 + 3).    - Consider the new set ({1, 2, 3, 6}). Check to see if the property holds:      - The sum of any three of these numbers (e.g., (1 + 2 + 3 = 6), (1 + 2 + 6 = 9), etc.) must be divisible by the excluded number. 3. Observe that the new number added ((6)) is equal to the sum of all previous numbers. If (a_1, a_2, ldots, a_k) already satisfy the condition, let's denote their sum as (S_k). We'll add (S_k) to the set. 4. By induction, assume (a_1, a_2, ldots, a_k) form a set with the desired property. Add (a_{k+1} = S_k) to the set:    - The new set is ({a_1, a_2, ldots, a_k, S_k}).    - For any (a_i) in the set, the sum of the others equals (S_{k+1} = 2S_k - a_i). Since (S_k) is divisible by (a_i), so is (2S_k - a_i). 5. Applying this process iteratively:    - Start with the set ({1, 2, 3}).    - Add:      - (6 = 1 + 2 + 3),      - (12 = 1 + 2 + 3 + 6),      - (24 = 1 + 2 + 3 + 6 + 12), and so on.    - Each step doubles the previous sum. 6. To find 2005 such numbers, continue this process, generating each next number by summing all previous numbers, giving us the sequence (1, 2, 3, 6, 12, 24, ldots). 7. The (n)-th term in the sequence (after 3) is generated by (3 cdot 2^{n-3}). For (n = 2004), the term is (3 cdot 2^{2001}).

By the property of a cyclic quadrilateral, the opposite angles of a cyclic quadrilateral add up to (180^circ).

To do this, we define an algorithm, starting with all integers unassigned (colored white):    **Instructions:**    - Begin with all integers colored white.    - Iteratively pick the smallest white integer x, define z = x + 1776 + 2001.    - Check x + 1776:       - If x + 1776 is white, add {x, x+1776, z} to our historical sets, color x red, x+1776 green, and z blue.      - Else, add {x, x+2001, z} to our historical sets, color x red, x+2001 purple, and z blue. 2. **Correctness of the Algorithm:**    **First Case:**    - At each iteration, we're selecting the smallest white number x and pairing it to either x + 1776 or x + 2001.     - The variable ( z ) is computed as ( z = x + 1776 + 2001 ). This ensures z is strictly larger than any previously colored integers (since we start with x as the smallest unassigned integer).    **Second Case:**    - If x + 1776 was previously assigned, we move to the calculation using x + 2001.    - The value ( y = x + 2001 ) avoids collisions with previously placed integers:      - If y were already colored purple, green, or red, it would create a contradiction.       - Suppose y (i.e., x + 2001) is blue from a previous iteration. This implies there exists some integer a such that a + 1776 + 2001 = x + 2001. Solving, we deduce a = x - 1776, but x was determined as the smallest white, leading to a contradiction of the algorithm’s guarantee. 3. **Partition and Inclusion:**    - At each step, ensure that new sets are disjoint from previous ones.    - Since we’re always picking the smallest white integer and coloring new integers appropriately, and since each integer eventually becomes the smallest white integer in some iteration, every integer will sooner or later be included in some historical set.    Thus, the process correctly covers all positive integers without overlapping any previously formed historical sets, proving the cover is complete and accurate. # Conclusion: The algorithm confirms that all positive integers can indeed be partitioned into disjoint historical sets: [ boxed{text{Algorithm Valid: The set of all positive integers can be partitioned into pairwise disjoint historical sets.}} ]"},{"instruction":"On the island of Puzzle, the official alphabet (Kobish Extended) includes 24 letters, A through X.

Since the logs are equal, their arguments must be equal:    [    2^{2x} - 1 = 2^x + 1    ] 8. Rearrange and simplify the equation:    [    2^{2x} - 2^x = 2     ] 9. Let ( y = 2^x ). Then the equation becomes:    [    y^2 - y - 2 = 0    ] 10.

This is because for x < 0, y will be positive, and for x > 0, y will be negative.    - In each of these quadrants, as x increases, y also increases because the magnitude of y (which is negative for x > 0 and positive for x < 0) becomes less negative or less positive due to the inverse relationship. 2. **Determining the Quadrants for Points A, B, and C:**    - Since A and B have negative x-coordinates, they are located in the second quadrant where y > 0. Therefore, y_{1} > 0 and y_{2} > 0.    - Point C has a positive x-coordinate, placing it in the fourth quadrant where y < 0. Hence, y_{3} < 0. 3. **Comparing y_{1} and y_{2}:**    - Given that -4 < -2, and knowing that in the second quadrant y increases as x increases (from left to right), it follows that y_{1} < y_{2} because the value of y at x = -4 (point A) will be less than the value of y at x = -2 (point B). 4. **Establishing the Relationship:**    - Since y_{3} < 0 and both y_{1}, y_{2} > 0, it is clear that y_{3} is the smallest among the three.    - From the comparison between y_{1} and y_{2}, we established that y_{1} < y_{2}.    - Combining these findings, we get y_{3} < y_{1} < y_{2}.

Since we are raising k to the power of 4, each prime factor in k must be raised to a power that is a multiple of 4. The prime factorization of 480 contains 2 raised to the power of 5, 3 raised to the power of 1, and 5 raised to the power of 1. To ensure that k^4 is divisible by 480, we need to have each of these prime factors in k raised to at least the power of 4.

There are 4 less than double the number of chickens free ranging as in the run. So, double the number of chickens in the run is 28 * 2 = 56, and 4 less than that is 56 - 4 = 52 chickens free ranging. 4. The number of chickens in the coop (14) and the chickens in the run (28) together form a 2:5 ratio with the number of free ranging chickens. So, the combined number of chickens in the coop and run is 14 + 28 = 42. If this is in a 2:5 ratio with the number of free ranging chickens, then the number of free ranging chickens should be (5/2) * 42 = 5 * 21 = 105. However, we previously calculated that there are 52 chickens free ranging, which conflicts with this ratio. Let's re-evaluate the ratio part: If the ratio of the number of chickens in the coop and run combined to the number of free ranging chickens is 2:5, then for every 2 parts in the coop and run, there are 5 parts free ranging.

We use the following lemma to bound ( y_n ):    **Lemma:** ( y_t < frac{1}{t sqrt{t}} ) for all ( t in mathbb{N} ). 8. **Proof of Lemma:**    - Base case: For ( t le 9 ), verify by direct calculation.    - Inductive step: Assume ( y_n < frac{1}{n sqrt{n}} ) for ( n ge 9 ). For ( t = n+1 ):      [      y_{n+1} le frac{1}{n^2(n+1)} + frac{n-2}{n} cdot frac{1}{n sqrt{n}} + frac{1}{n^3}      ]      Let ( a = sqrt{n} ). We need to show:      [      frac{1}{(n+1)(a + frac{1}{2a})} < frac{1}{(n+1) sqrt{n+1}}      ]      Simplifying, we get:      [      a^5 - 4a^4 + 5a^3 - 5a^2 + 2a - 1 ge 0      ]      This can be rewritten as:      [      a^3(1 + (a-2)^2) - 4a^2 + 2a - 1 ge 0      ]      Since ( a ge 3 ), we have ( a^3(1 + (a-2)^2) - 4a^2 ge 2a^3 - 4a^2 ge 0 ) and ( 2a - 1 ge 0 ). Thus, the lemma holds. 9. By the lemma, ( y_{100} < frac{1}{100 sqrt{100}} = 0.001 ). Therefore,    [    a_{100} = 0.01 - y_{100} > 0.01 - 0.001 = 0.009    ] 10.

This effectively reduces our problem to arranging four units: the _AB_ unit, _C_, _D_, and _E_. 1. First, we arrange these four units. There are 4! = 24 ways to do this because we have four units to arrange. 2. However, within the _AB_ unit, _A_ and _B_ can switch places with each other, which means there are 2! = 2 ways to arrange _A_ and _B_ within this unit. 3. Considering the restriction that _C_ and _D_ cannot be placed together, we need to subtract the arrangements where _C_ and _D_ are next to each other. If we treat _C_ and _D_ as a single unit (like we did with _A_ and _B_), there are 3! = 6 ways to arrange the three units (_CD_, _AB_, and _E_). Within the _CD_ unit, there are 2! = 2 ways to arrange _C_ and _D_. So, there are 6 times 2 = 12 arrangements where _C_ and _D_ are together. 4.

Consider the quadrilateral (ABCD) inscribed in a circle. We extend the sides (AB) and (CD) to meet at point (P), and extend the sides (BC) and (AD) to meet at point (Q). 2. We need to show that the points of intersection of the angle bisectors of (angle AQP) and (angle BPQ) with the sides of (ABCD) form the vertices of a rhombus. 3. Let the angle bisectors of (angle AQP) and (angle BPQ) intersect the sides (AB), (BC), (CD), and (DA) at points (M), (N), (R), and (S) respectively. 4. To prove this, let us first focus on the internal angles of quadrilateral (ABCD) at points (A), (B), (C), and (D). 5. Since (ABCD) is a cyclic quadrilateral (inscribed in a circle), we use the properties of angles subtended by the same arc. Hence, (angle BAD = angle BCD) and (angle ABC = angle ADC). 6. Given that the angle bisectors at (P) and (Q) intersect the sides of (ABCD), we denote:    - The angle formed by the intersection at point (M) on side (AB) (bisecting (angle AQP)) as (alpha + varphi).    - The angle formed by the intersection at point (N) on side (BC) (bisecting (angle BPQ)) as (beta + varphi). 7. The angles of quadrilateral (BMNR) (formed by the angle bisectors):    - (angle BMRN = alpha + varphi)    - (angle MNRB = beta + varphi)    - Similarly, utilizing properties of cyclic quadrilaterals, we argue the remaining angles and focus on proving that (x = 90^circ). 8. For the quadrilateral (BMNR) to form a rhombus, one of the necessary conditions is that the opposite sides must be equal and the opposite angles must each be (90^circ). 9. Since angles (alpha) and (beta) are derived from cyclic quadrilateral properties, we note:    [    alpha + beta = 180^circ - (varphi)    ] 10. Consequently, the sum of these calculated angles combined with the remaining angle (varphi):     [     (2 alpha + varphi) + (2 beta + varphi) = 180^circ     ]     which simplifies to:     [     (2 alpha + 2beta + 2varphi) = 180^circ     ]     Normalizing by dividing both sides by 2, we get:     [     alpha + beta + varphi = 90^circ     ] 11. Since the bisectors reflect symmetry across points (P) and (Q), (alpha = varphi = beta = 45^circ). 12. Conclusively, (angle varphi) represents an orthogonal condition split by equal bisecting angles ending in constructing a rhombus. Thus, our proof concludes that the points (M), (N), (R), and (S) lie on a rhombus, where ( angle x = 90^circ ). [ boxed{} ]"},{"instruction":"The schools debate team had 26 boys and 46 girls on it.

We start by noting the important constraints: - Maximum velocity v_{max} = 90 mph = 132 ft/sec - Total distance d = 1 mile = 5280 ft - Total time t < 60 seconds - Maximum acceleration or deceleration a_{max} = 6.6 ft/sec² Now let's plot the velocity v in ft/sec against time t in seconds. The graph should abide by the given constraints. 1. **Acceleration Phase:**    If the vehicle's acceleration never exceeds 6.6 ft/sec², then in the first t_1 seconds, the velocity v can be described by:    [    v = 6.6t    ]    This equation represents a line from the origin (0,0) with a slope of 6.6. The time t = 20 seconds is where this line reaches the maximum velocity:    [    6.6 times 20 = 132 text{ ft/sec}    ]    This time 20 seconds marks the point where the acceleration would need to stop if it were to remain under the threshold of 6.6 ft/sec² to reach 132 ft/sec. 2. **Deceleration Phase:**    Similarly, if the vehicle’s deceleration does not exceed 6.6 ft/sec², then in the last t_2 seconds, the velocity can be described by:    [    v = -6.6(t - t_{text{end}})    ]    We know the vehicle starts decelerating at t = 40 seconds (because the journey ends at t = 60 seconds). Thus,    [    v = -6.6(t - 60) text{ for } t in [40, 60]    ]    This equation represents a line that decreases linearly at the rate of 6.6 ft/sec², and it also intersects the time axis at t = 60 seconds.  3. **Area Under the Velocity Curve:**    The area under the velocity curve from t = 0 seconds to t = 60 seconds represents the distance traveled (1 mile = 5280 feet). Under the constraint that acceleration and deceleration do not exceed 6.6 ft/sec², the curve described (triangular and trapezoidal sections) is as follows:        - The area of the trapezoid created by the two linear sections at maximum allowed acceleration and deceleration:      [      text{Area} = frac{1}{2} times 20 times 132 + 20 times 132 + frac{1}{2} times 20 times 132      ]     4. **Simplifying the Integral (Area Calculation):**        [    text{Area} = frac{1}{2} times 20 times 132 + 20 times 132 + frac{1}{2} times 20 times 132     ]     [    = 1320 + 2640 + 1320     ]    [    = 5280 text{ feet}    ] This area calculation equals exactly one mile. Since we know the vehicle completes its journey in less time than 60 seconds, the actual area under the true velocity curve (achieved in less than 60 seconds) must be slightly larger than 5280 feet.  Therefore, this implies that somewhere during the trip, the vehicle must have exceeded the allowed maximum acceleration or deceleration threshold at some point to cover exactly 1 mile in less than 60 seconds. This additional requirement in velocity changes suggests an acceleration or deceleration greater than 6.6 ft/sec² at some point. # Conclusion: [ boxed{} ] or [ blacksquare ]"},{"instruction":"Given three points in space A(2,0,2), B(t2,4,3), C(4,s,1), let overrightarrow{a}=overrightarrow{AB}, overrightarrow{b}=overrightarrow{AC}.

Therefore, the general term of the sequence is a_n = a_1 + (n-1)d = 2n - 1. (II) The sequence {a_n + b_n} is a geometric sequence with first term 1 and common ratio 2. So, a_n + b_n = 2^{n-1}.

We are told that Pete read a total of 300 books across both years, so the sum of the books he read last year and this year is: P + 2P = 300 3P = 300 P = 300 / 3 P = 100 So, Pete read 100 books last year.

We need to find the angle ( angle AMH ). 2. Let's start by considering triangle ( BDA ). Since ( D ) is on the extension of ( BA ), triangle ( BDA ) is isosceles with ( BD = DA ). 3. The median ( DM ) in isosceles triangle ( BDA ) is also the altitude, so ( angle DMB = 90^circ ). 4.

We consider the parallelogram properties, especially dealing with triangle ( DBC ). 7. In triangle ( DBC ), since ( angle B = 111^circ ) in the parallelogram:     - Angle ( angle C ) is calculated as ( 180^circ - 111^circ = 69^circ ). 8.

Let's start by finding the GCD of the first two numbers, Maaza and Pepsi, which are 139 and 223 liters respectively. Since these two numbers are both prime, their GCD is 1.

Therefore, without needing to calculate further, we can conclude that the GCD of all the drink quantities is 1 liter. This means that the vendor can pack the drinks in cans such that each can contains 1 liter of a drink. Now, we need to calculate the total number of cans required by adding up the quantities of all the drinks and dividing by the volume of each can (1 liter): Total liters = 139 + 223 + 179 + 199 + 173 + 211 + 131 + 257 Total liters = 1412 liters Since each can will contain 1 liter, the total number of cans required will be the same as the total number of liters: Total cans = 1412 Therefore, the least number of cans required is boxed{1412} ."},{"instruction":"Gizi and Tibi play the following game.

Gizi (the first player) can always play in a way that ensures the area of triangle XYZ is at least frac{1}{4} of the area of triangle ABC.  Step-by-Step Solution: 1. **Proving Tibi's Strategy**:    Tibi's goal is to minimize the area of triangle XYZ. Suppose Gizi chooses the point X on side AB. Tibi will select point Y on side BC such that XY parallel AC. This parallelism can always be achieved due to the properties of similar triangles.     Let:     - m_b be the altitude from vertex B in triangle ABC.     - m_b' be the altitude from vertex B in triangle XBY.     - t = frac{XB}{AB}, the ratio along side AB.     Using similarity, we know:     [     m_b' = t cdot m_b     ]     [     XY = t cdot AC     ]     Let m_z = m_b - m_b'.

This confirms assertion (i). 2. **Proving Gizi's Strategy**:    Gizi's goal is to maximize the area of triangle XYZ. Gizi will choose the points X and Z as follows:    - X is chosen at the midpoint of side AB.    - Z is chosen at the midpoint of side AC.     With this setup, no matter where Tibi chooses point Y on BC, consider the triangle XYZ. The line XZ becomes the midline of triangle ABC, meaning:     [     XZ = frac{1}{2} cdot BC     ]     Moreover, the height of triangle XYZ from Y to XZ corresponds to half the height of triangle ABC because XZ is parallel to BC and forms the midline.     As a result, the area of triangle XYZ is:     [     T_{XYZ} = frac{1}{4} T_{ABC}     ] Thus, by both controlling and maximizing their strategies, both assertions (i) and (ii) are proven. # Conclusion: [ boxed{frac{1}{4} T_{ABC}} ]"},{"instruction":"A group of 7 teenagers recently visited the Japanese restaurant.

Finally, we evaluate (fleft(frac{pi}{4}right)):    [    fleft(frac{pi}{4}right) = lnleft(sec frac{pi}{4} + tan frac{pi}{4}right) + lnleft(csc frac{pi}{4} + cot frac{pi}{4}right)    ]    Since (sec frac{pi}{4} = csc frac{pi}{4} = sqrt{2}) and (tan frac{pi}{4} = cot frac{pi}{4} = 1):    [    fleft(frac{pi}{4}right) = lnleft(sqrt{2} + 1right) + lnleft(sqrt{2} + 1right) = 2 lnleft(sqrt{2} + 1right) = lnleft((sqrt{2} + 1)^2right) = lnleft(2 + 2sqrt{2} + 1right) = lnleft(3 + 2sqrt{2}right)    ] The final answer is (boxed{lnleft(3 + 2sqrt{2}right)})"},{"instruction":"Let ( a_{1}, a_{2}, cdots, a_{n} ) be positive numbers such that ( a_{1} + a_{2} + cdots + a_{n} = 1 ).

Let ( E ) be the union of all lines determined by pairs of these points. Define ( F(x) ) as the number of triangles containing ( x ) inside, where ( x ) is any point in ( mathbb{R}^2 setminus E ). 3. **Properties of ( F(x) ):**    - If ( x ) is outside the convex hull of the points, ( F(x) = 0 ).    - ( F ) is constant on any connected component of ( mathbb{R}^2 setminus E ).    - The connected components are convex polygons.    - We can move between adjacent connected components by crossing a line segment ( e ) on their boundary. 4. **Behavior of ( F(x) ) During a Move:**    To show that ( F(x) ) changes by an even number when moving from one connected component to another, consider a move from the left to the right of a line segment ( e ) on the boundary of two adjacent components. Let ( g ) be the line containing ( e ), and let ( P ) and ( P' ) be the endpoints of ( e ). 5. **Counting Triangles:**    - For triangles not involving ( P ) and ( P' ), the position of ( x ) relative to these triangles does not change.    - Consider triangles formed by ( P ), ( P' ), and a third point. Let ( l ) be the number of points to the left of ( g ) and ( r ) be the number of points to the right of ( g ). Since ( l + r = n - 2 ), both ( l ) and ( r ) are either even or odd. 6. **Change in ( F(x) ):**    - Before the move, ( x ) is inside all triangles formed by ( P ), ( P' ), and the ( l ) points to the left.    - After the move, ( x ) is inside all triangles formed by ( P ), ( P' ), and the ( r ) points to the right.    - The change in ( F(x) ) is ( r - l ), which is even since ( l ) and ( r ) are both even or both odd. 7. **Conclusion:**    Since ( F(x) ) changes by an even number for any move between connected components, and ( F(x) ) is initially zero outside the convex hull, ( F(x) ) must be even for any point ( x ) inside the convex hull, including ( P ).

Both the jogger and the train are affected by a wind blowing from the opposite direction at 4 km/hr. Taking into account the wind resistance, in how much time will the train pass the jogger?","output":"First, let's calculate the relative speed of the train with respect to the jogger. Since both are moving in the same direction, we subtract the jogger's speed from the train's speed to find the relative speed. However, we also need to consider the effect of the wind blowing from the opposite direction, which affects both the jogger and the train. The speed of the train is 60 km/hr, and the speed of the jogger is 12 km/hr. The wind is blowing at 4 km/hr in the opposite direction, which effectively reduces the speed of both the train and the jogger by 4 km/hr. So, the effective speed of the train becomes 60 km/hr - 4 km/hr = 56 km/hr, and the effective speed of the jogger becomes 12 km/hr - 4 km/hr = 8 km/hr. Now, let's calculate the relative speed between the train and the jogger: Relative speed = Speed of train - Speed of jogger Relative speed = 56 km/hr - 8 km/hr Relative speed = 48 km/hr To convert this relative speed into meters per second, we use the conversion factor 1 km/hr = 1000 m/3600 s: Relative speed = 48 km/hr * (1000 m/km) / (3600 s/hr) Relative speed = 48000 m/hr / 3600 s/hr Relative speed = 13.33 m/s Now, we need to calculate the time it will take for the train to pass the jogger. The train needs to cover the distance of 300 m (the initial lead of the jogger) plus the length of the train itself, which is also 300 m. So, the total distance the train needs to cover is 300 m + 300 m = 600 m. Using the formula time = distance / speed, we can find the time it will take for the train to pass the jogger: Time = Distance / Relative speed Time = 600 m / 13.33 m/s Time ≈ 45 seconds Therefore, it will take approximately boxed{45}  seconds for the train to pass the jogger, taking into account the wind resistance."},{"instruction":"5 football games thus far this season, Barry has run for 98, 107, 85, 89, and some yards.

If Barry wants to keep his average above 100 yards per game after six games, he needs to have more than 600 yards in total (because 6 games * 100 yards/game = 600 yards).

Consider any ( 0 < x < 1 ) and assume ( f(y) = (1 - x) y ). Substituting into the original equation with this form of ( f(y) ), we obtain:    [    P(x, y) Rightarrow x f(y) = xf(y) + f(x + y)    ]    which leads to a contradiction as this implies ( x f(y) = 0 ), for ( 0 < x < 1) and ( f(y) = (1 - x) y ) is not possible unless (x = 0), which contradicts the initial condition. Hence, we must have ( f(y) geq y ) for all (y > 0). 3. **Step 2: Substitute ( f(x) = x + g(x) )**    Let ( f(x) = x + g(x) ) where ( g ) is a function from (mathbb{R}_{> 0}) to (mathbb{R}_{geq 0}).    Substituting into the given functional equation, we get:    [    x + g(x + f(y) + xy) = x + y + xy + g(y)    ]    and    [    x f(y) + f(x + y) = x(y + g(y)) + (x + y + g(x + y))    ]    Therefore, simplifying both sides, we have:    [    g(x + xy + y + g(y)) = (x - 1)g(y) + g(x + y)    ]    Let this be equation ((dagger)). 4. **Step 3: Prove Injectivity for nonzero outputs of ( g )**    **Claim**: If ( g(a) = g(b) ) for ( a neq b ), then ( g(a) = g(b) = 0 ).    **Proof**:    Setting ( x = a ) and ( x = b ) in ((dagger)):    [    (a - 1) g(b) = (b - 1) g(a)    ]    Since ( a - 1 neq b - 1 ), this forces ( g(a) = g(b) = 0 ). 5. **Step 4: Prove ( g ) vanishes on ((1, infty))**    **Claim**: ( g(t) = 0 ) for all ( t > 1 ).    **Proof**:    Setting ( x = 1 ) in ((dagger)), we get:    [    g(1 + 2y + g(y)) = g(1 + y)    ]    Since ( 1 + 2y + g(y) > 1 + y ), using the previous claim, we find that ( g(1 + y) = 0 ) for all ( y > 0 ).

Thus, ( g(x) = 0 ) for all ( x > 0 ). 7. **Conclusion:**    Since ( g(x) = 0 ) for all ( x > 0 ):    [    f(x) = x + g(x) = x    ]    Therefore, we have proven that ( f(x) = x ) for all positive real numbers (x).

Since Tom has to pay 1340 and the trip itself costs 1200, the remaining amount he has to pay is for the medical bills. 1340 (total payment) - 1200 (trip cost) = 140 (medical bills payment) Since insurance covers 80% of the medical bills, Tom has to pay the remaining 20%.

From the definition of ( g(x) ), we have:    [    g(x + p) = sin((x + p)^2)    ]    [    g(x) = sin(x^2)    ] 4. Therefore, the periodicity condition requires:    [    sin((x + p)^2) = sin(x^2)    ] 5. Use the identity for the sine function to expand ( (x + p)^2 ):    [    (x + p)^2 = x^2 + 2xp + p^2    ] 6.

This can be done since we are given that the x_i coordinates are distinct. 3. **Applying the Erdős–Szekeres Theorem:**     - The Erdős–Szekeres theorem states that among any sequence of n distinct real numbers, there exists a monotonic subsequence (either increasing or decreasing) of length at least lfloor sqrt{n} rfloor.     - Apply this theorem to the sequence of y_i coordinates, obtaining a monotone subsequence of length at least lfloor sqrt{n} rfloor. 4. **Non-Formation of Equilateral Triangle:**     - Consider the points that correspond to this monotone subsequence of y_i. Let the points in this subsequence be (x_{i_1}, y_{i_1}), (x_{i_2}, y_{i_2}), ldots, (x_{i_{lfloor sqrt{n} rfloor}}, y_{i_{lfloor sqrt{n} rfloor}}).     - Points that lie in a monotone subsequence of y_i (with all x_i distinct) cannot form an equilateral triangle.

Consider a closed spatial polygonal chain with vertices ( A_1, A_2, ldots, A_n ) such that each edge intersects a fixed sphere in two points, and all vertices lie outside the sphere.

Since it is given that the segments adjacent to vertices ( A_1, A_2, ldots, A_{n-1} ) are equal and each segment falls both inside and outside the sphere, we can write for ( A_i ) (for ( i = 1, 2, ldots, n-1 )):    [    |A_i X| = |A_i Y| quad text{where} quad X, Y in text{Intersection points with the sphere}    ]    as the segments adjacent to any vertex not including the sphere are equally divided. 5.

By symmetry and the uniform interference of the invariant distances, it implies that the endpoints of each segment behave equivalently. 7. Given that the segment attached to the vertices other than ( A_n ) are of equal length, this gives rise to the consistency for ( A_n ). 8.

Since (e^{2x}) corresponds to (r = 2), which is a root of the characteristic equation, we try a solution of the form: [ y^* = x(Ax + B)e^{2x} = (Ax^2 + Bx)e^{2x} ] To find the coefficients (A) and (B), we compute the first and second derivatives of (y^*): [ y^* = (Ax^2 + Bx)e^{2x} ] [ y^{*'} = left(2Ax + B + (Ax^2 + Bx)2right)e^{2x} = left(2Ax + B + 2Ax^2 + 2Bxright)e^{2x} ] [ y^{*'} = left(2Ax + B + 2Ax^2 + 2Bxright)e^{2x} ] [ y^{*''} = left(2A + 2A cdot 2x + 2Bx + left(2Ax + B + (2A)x + (2Bx)right)2right)e^{2x} ] [ y^{*''} = left(2A + 8Ax^2 + 4Ax + 2B + 8Ax + 4Bxright)e^{2x} ] [ y^{*''} = left(4A + 12Ax + 4Bx + 4A + Bright)e^{2x} ] Simplifying: [ y^* = (Ax^2 + Bx)e^{2x} ] [ y^*' = (2Ax + b)(e^{2x} + (2Ax + B))e^{2x} ] [ y^*'' = (4Ax + 2A)e^{2x} = 1 + 4Ax + 2Ax^2] Substituting these into the original equation: [ y'' + 2y - 8y = (4Ax^2 + 4Ax + 2Bx + 2B)e^{2x} + 4 cdot e^{2x} ] Grouping the similar terms: [ y= 4A cdot x^2 pm 4B cdot x 2A + 4Bx^2 = (4Ax^2 + 4Ax + 2A + 4Bx + 2B)e^{2x} approx 12Ax + 6Bx ] Equating the coefficients with ( (12x +20a)): [ 12A = 12 implies A=1, ] [ 2A+6B = 20 implies B = 3. ] So, our particular solution is: [ y^* = (Ax^2 + Bx)e^{2x} ] [ y^* = (x^2 + 3x)e^{2x} ] **Step 3:** Combine the solutions. The general solution to the non-homogeneous equation is: [ y = bar{y} + y^* = C_1 e^{-4x} + C_2 e^{2x} + (x^2 + 3x)e^{2x} ] **Step 4:** Apply the initial conditions.

Consider the properties of a quadrilateral.    - For one quadrilateral, let's consider a **parallelogram**. A parallelogram is defined as a quadrilateral with opposite sides that are parallel. 2. According to **Theorem**:    - The theorem states that if both pairs of opposite sides of a quadrilateral are parallel, then they must also be equal in length. 3. Demonstrate this property in a parallelogram:    Let (ABCD) be a parallelogram where:    ( AB parallel CD ) and ( AD parallel BC ).        By the definition of a parallelogram:    [    AB = CD quad text{and} quad AD = BC.    ]        Therefore, the opposite sides of a parallelogram are not only parallel but also equal in length. 4. Now, let's consider another quadrilateral where this property does not hold:    - Consider a **trapezoid** (EFGH) where only one pair of opposite sides is parallel. 5. In a trapezoid:        Let ( EFGH ) be the trapezoid with:    ( EF parallel GH ).        However, the sides (EF) and (GH) are not necessarily equal in length unless it is an isosceles trapezoid. 6. Conclusion:    The property of opposite sides being equal in length due to their parallelism is specific to a parallelogram but is not necessarily true for a trapezoid. Therefore, in this context:        - The parallelogram's opposite sides are always parallel and equal (dependent properties).    - A trapezoid’s opposite sides being parallel does not imply they are equal (incompatible properties).

If Masud has 45 siblings and Carlos has 20 more siblings than Stella, how many more siblings does Janet have than the total number of siblings of Carlos, Stella, and Lila combined?","output":"Let's start by calculating the number of siblings each person has based on the information given: 1. Masud has 45 siblings. 2. Janet has 60 less than four times as many siblings as Masud. So, Janet has 4 * 45 - 60 = 180 - 60 = 120 siblings. 3. Carlos has 3/4 times as many siblings as Masud. So, Carlos has (3/4) * 45 = 33.75, but since the number of siblings must be a whole number, we'll round it to 34 siblings. 4. Stella has (5/2) times as many siblings as Carlos minus 8. Since Carlos has 34 siblings, Stella has (5/2) * 34 - 8 = 85 - 8 = 77 siblings. 5. Carlos has 20 more siblings than Stella. This means Carlos actually has 77 + 20 = 97 siblings (correcting the earlier calculation). 6. Lila has exactly 1/3 more siblings than the combined number of siblings of Carlos and Stella.

This equation suggests that no matter where ( P ) is, the difference in distances from ( P ) to ( M ) and from ( P ) to ( N ) is always 4. 5. Since ( M ) and ( N ) are two points on the x-axis, and the condition involves a constant difference in distances, the set of points ( P ) forming the trajectory will not be a closed curve or a continuous curve that loops back on itself.

This new pentagon (K B C D E) would contradict the minimality assumption because at least one integer point will lie inside ( triangle ABC ) or on its boundary. 3. **Finding an Appropriate Sub-triangle with Minimal Area:**    Consider the triangles formed with the vertices of the pentagon, i.e., ( triangle A B C ), ( triangle B C D ), ( triangle C D E ), ( triangle D E A ), and ( triangle E A B ). Identify the triangle with the least area, say ( triangle A B C ). 4. **Height and Parallelism Considerations:**    Since ( triangle A B C ) has the minimal area, the perpendicular distances from points ( A ) to line ( B C ), and ( C ) to line ( A B ), satisfy:    [    rho(A, BC) leq rho(D, BC) quad text{and} quad rho(C, AB) leq rho(E, AB)    ] 5. **Construct a Parallelogram:**    Consider the point ( O ) such that ( A B C O ) forms a parallelogram. Clearly, ( O ) is an integer point, based on the properties of parallelograms where all vertices are integer points.    Thus, the distances:    [    rho(O, BC) = rho(A, BC) quad text{and} quad rho(O, AB) = rho(C, AB) leq rho(B_1, AB)    ] 6. **Placement of Point ( O ):**    Consequently, point ( O ) lies inside the triangle ( triangle A B_1 C ). From the analysis, it follows that the point ( O ) must also lie within the pentagon ( A_1 B_1 C_1 D_1 E_1 ), leading to a contradiction as its existence invalidates the assumption that there are no integer points inside ( A_1 B_1 C_1 D_1 E_1 ).    Thus, our initial assumption must be incorrect. # Conclusion: Therefore, there is at least one integer point inside or on the boundary of the pentagon ( A_1 B_1 C_1 D_1 E_1 ).

This principle states that the probability of an event happening is 1 minus the probability of it not happening. The only situation where we don't get at least one white ball is when both balls taken out are red.  First, we calculate the probability of taking out two red balls. The probability of taking the first red ball is frac{5}{9}, since there are 5 red balls out of a total of 9 balls. After taking out one red ball, there are now 4 red balls left out of a total of 8 balls, so the probability of taking another red ball is frac{4}{8} = frac{1}{2}.

To find the integer pairs ((a, b)), we need to determine the relationships that these values should satisfy. Let's denote (x = sqrt{2010 + 2sqrt{2009}}). Notice that we have a nested square root, so one strategy is to eliminate this nested form by expressing (x) in a simpler radical form. 1. **Square Both Sides**:    First, we will square both sides of (x = sqrt{2010 + 2sqrt{2009}}):    [    x^2 = 2010 + 2sqrt{2009}    ] 2. **Set (x^2 = y)**:    Let us set (y = 2010 + 2sqrt{2009}) for convenience.

When a decagon is inscribed in a circle, each vertex of the decagon lies on the circumference of the circle. The center of the circle, denoted as O, is equidistant from all the vertices of the decagon. Since the decagon is regular, it means all its sides and angles are equal. The total angle around a point (in this case, the center of the circle O) is 360 degrees. For a regular decagon, this total angle is divided equally among the 10 central angles formed by drawing lines from the center O to each vertex of the decagon. Therefore, each central angle is 360 degrees divided by 10, which equals 36 degrees. Now, if A and B are adjacent vertices of the decagon, the angle ∠AOB at the center O, which subtends the arc AB on the circumference, is one of these central angles and is therefore 36 degrees. However, ∠OAB is not the central angle but an angle of the triangle OAB, where OA and OB are radii of the circle. Since OA = OB (radii of the same circle), triangle OAB is an isosceles triangle. The angle ∠OAB is half of the central angle ∠AOB because the central angle subtends an arc that is twice the angle at the circumference of the circle based on the same arc.

Simplifying this equation under the assumption that the circle is tangent to the x-axis leads to the conclusion that D^{2}=4F.

The line (l) and the curve (C) have a common point if and only if the distance between the center of the circle ((0, 1)) and the line is less than or equal to the radius of the circle (which is 1 in this case).

We can color these two half-planes in different colors. This trivially satisfies the requirement that bordering regions should have different colors. Thus, the base case is established.     - Let’s say we color one half-plane red and the other half-plane blue.     - Clearly, any two adjacent regions (the half-planes) have different colors. 2. **Induction Hypothesis:**     Assume that for ( n = k ) lines, the plane can indeed be colored with 2 colors such that adjacent regions have different colors. 3. **Inductive Step:**     Consider ( k + 1 ) lines.     - By the induction hypothesis, we can color the regions formed by the first ( k ) lines using two colors, ensuring that adjacent regions have different colors.     - Adding the ((k+1))-th line, it will divide some of the regions already colored by the first ( k ) lines.     Let's proceed with understanding the impact of the ((k + 1))-th line:          1. Forget about the ((k+1))-th line for a moment.     2. Assume all regions formed by ( k ) lines are colored such that no two adjacent regions share the same color.     3. Introduce the ((k+1))-th line. This line intersects some of the previously colored regions.          By placing the ((k+1))-th line, existing regions are split into pairs of adjacent regions. According to the coloring prepared for ( k ) lines, each pair of adjacent regions along this new line will initially have the same color (as regions that are sub-divisions of a previous region will inherit that region's color).           A simple color flip is enough here:     - Let's choose one side of the ((k+1))-th line (all regions on this particular side).     - We reverse the color of all regions solely on that one side of the ((k+1))-th line.          After this flip:     - Any pair of regions that the ((k+1))-th line divides now have different colors.      Therefore, we have ensured that despite adding the ((k+1))-th line, all regions remain colored such that no two adjacent regions share the same color. # Conclusion: By induction, we have shown that no matter how many lines divide the plane, the plane can always be colored using 2 colors such that no two adjacent regions share the same color.

Assume there are ( k ) liars among the fans of the \\"Super Eagles\\" and ( k ) liars among the fans of the \\"Super Lions\\".  2. Then, the total number of liars is ( 2k ). 3. Each fan claims that the fan to their right is a fan of the \\"Super Eagles\\". If this declaration is a lie, it means the fan to the right is actually a fan of the \\"Super Lions\\". Conversely, if the declaration is true, the fan to the right is genuinely a fan of the \\"Super Eagles\\". 4. If there are ( 2k ) liars, the statements \\"The fan to my right is a fan of the ‘Super Eagles’\\" are lies an even number of times, i.e., ( 2k ) times. 5. Therefore, the number of times the statement \\"The fan to my right is a fan of the ‘Super Eagles’\\" is false implies that there must be an even number of times this claim is false and therefore, according to the claim, an even number of \\"Super Lions\\" must appear twice consecutively. 6. However, recall the seating arrangement specifies exactly 25 fans from each team. If there were ( 2k ) fans representing an incorrect statement based on lies, this would imply that ( 2k ) is an even number representing inconsistencies around the table. 7. But since the fans are alternately seated and ( k ) is half the consistent fans which should account for fan types (Super Eagles and Super Lions) equally, its count would be odd versus evenly altering statements contrary to seating counts. 8.

We will construct a corresponding subset of the natural numbers from this sequence. 3. **Subset Construction:**    Define a subset ( A ) of natural numbers such that    [    A = { i in mathbb{N} mid a_i = 1 }    ]    In other words, ( A ) contains precisely those natural numbers ( i ) for which the corresponding term ( a_i ) in the sequence ( S ) equals 1. 4. **Creating the Mapping:**    The function ( f ) that maps an infinite binary sequence ( (a_1, a_2, ldots) ) to the subset ( A ) of natural numbers is defined as follows:    [    f: {(a_1, a_2, ldots) mid a_i in {0,1} } to mathcal{P}(mathbb{N})    ]    where ( mathcal{P}(mathbb{N}) ) represents the power set of ( mathbb{N} ), the set of all subsets of ( mathbb{N} ). 5. **Injectivity of ( f ):**    To prove that ( f ) is injective, assume that two sequences ( (a_1, a_2, ldots) ) and ( (b_1, b_2, ldots) ) are mapped to the same subset of ( mathbb{N} ). This implies that for every ( i ),    [    a_i = b_i.    ]    Therefore, the sequences are identical, proving that ( f ) is injective. 6. **Surjectivity of ( f ):**    To prove that ( f ) is surjective, let ( A ) be an arbitrary subset of ( mathbb{N} ). We can construct a sequence ( (a_1, a_2, ldots) ) where    [    a_i =    begin{cases}        1 & text{if } i in A        0 & text{if } i notin A     end{cases}    ]    This sequence is mapped to the subset ( A ) by ( f ). Hence, ( f ) is surjective. 7. **Conclusion:**    Since ( f ) is both injective and surjective, it is a bijection. Therefore, the set of all infinite sequences ( (a_1, a_2, ldots) ) where ( a_i in {0,1} ) has the same cardinality as the set of all subsets of natural numbers.

Combine the inequalities:    [    n^2 - n - 1 < a leq n^2 - n    ] 6. Since ( a leq -1 ), we have:    [    n^2 - n - 1 < -1 leq a leq n^2 - n    ]    [    n^2 - n - 1 < -1 implies n^2 - n < 0    ] 7. The quadratic inequality ( n^2 - n < 0 ) holds for ( 0 < n < 1 ). However, ( n ) must be an integer, so there are no integer solutions for ( n ). Therefore, if ( a leq -1 ), the equation ( lfloor x rfloor^2 - x = a ) does not have real solutions.

We need to prove that frac{A_{1}O}{A_{1}A} = frac{a}{a+b+c}.","output":"To prove the given statement, follow these steps: 1. **Place arbitrary masses**     Consider triangle ABC with sides a, b, c opposite to vertices A, B, and C respectively.    Place an arbitrary mass p_3 at point C and select mass p_1 at point A such that point B_1 (where B_1 lies on AC and AB_1 is the angle bisector) is the center of mass of the system consisting of (A, p_1) and (C, p_3).    Therefore, using the property of the angle bisector, we have:        frac{p_1}{p_3} = frac{CB_1}{AB_1} = frac{a}{c}     2. **Express p_1 in terms of a, c, and p_3**    This implies:        p_1 = p_3 frac{a}{c}     3. **Analogous selection of mass at point B**    Similarly, select mass p_2 at point B such that point A_1 (where A_1 lies on BC and BA_1 is the angle bisector) is the center of mass of the system consisting of (B, p_2) and (C, p_3).    Using the property of the angle bisector, we have:        frac{p_2}{p_3} = frac{CA_1}{BA_1} = frac{b}{c}     4. **Express p_2 in terms of b, c, and p_3**    This implies:        p_2 = p_3 frac{b}{c}     5. **Define the center of mass M**    Let M be the center of mass of the entire system. Consider the masses p_1 = frac{a}{c} p_3 and p_2 = frac{b}{c} p_3 centered at points A and B respectively. The combined mass of p_2 and p_3 can be considered concentrated at point A_1. Thus, the entire system consists of points A and A_1 with respective masses p_1 and p_2 + p_3. 6. **Use the lever rule to find the ratio A_1 O / A A_1**    Using the lever principle at the point O such that O is the center of mass:        frac{A_1 O}{A_1 A} = frac{p_1}{p_2 + p_3}        Substituting p_1 = frac{a}{c} p_3 and p_2 + p_3 = frac{b}{c} p_3 + p_3 = frac{b+c}{c} p_3, we get:        frac{A_1 O}{A A_1} = frac{frac{a}{c} p_3}{frac{b+c}{c} p_3} = frac{a}{b+c}     7. **Form the resultant proportion**    Combining A_1 O / A A_1 + A_1 O / A_1 A results in:        frac{A_1 O}{A_1 A_1 + A A_1} = frac{a}{a+b+c}        Hence,        frac{A_1 O}{A_1 A} = frac{a}{a+b+c}        which completes the proof.

Our goal is to construct a rhombus where two sides lie on the parallel lines, and the other two sides or their extensions pass through the points ( P ) and ( Q ). 3. **Distance considerations**:      For the rhombus, the distance between any pair of opposite sides must be equal to ( m ). This is because the parallel sides must be parallel and equidistant from each other. 4. **Constructing the auxiliary circle**:      We draw a circle centered at point ( Q ) with radius ( m ). This circle represents all possible points that are ( m ) units away from ( Q ). At point ( P ), we need to draw tangents to this circle. These tangents will help us locate the required sides of the rhombus. 5. **Finding the tangents**:      Depending on the distance between the points ( P ) and ( Q ):    - If the distance ( PQ ) is greater than ( m ), then there will be exactly two tangents from ( P ) to the circle.    - If ( PQ = m ), then there will be exactly one tangent from ( P ) to the circle, as ( P ) will lie on the circle. 6. **Determine intersections on parallel lines**:      Each tangent from ( P ) to the circle will intersect the first parallel line. From these intersection points, draw lines parallel to the tangents, meeting the second parallel line at two points. This will give us the vertices of the rhombus. 7. **Case analysis with point distances**:      - If ( PQ > m ), we draw the two tangents and extend these tangents to meet the first parallel line at points ( A ) and ( B ). From ( A ) and ( B ), draw lines parallel to the tangents until they intersect the second parallel line at points ( C ) and ( D ), forming the rhombus ( ABCD ).    - If ( PQ = m ), there is one tangent from ( P ) to the circle, which produces a single intersection at each parallel line. Drawing the necessary parallel lines will yield the rhombus directly. 8. **Consider special cases for tangents**:      If any tangent is parallel to the given parallel lines, that tangent bounds the possible construction of the rhombus in unique ways, potentially reducing the number of possible rhombuses by one. 9. **Draw the rhombus**:      - Construct the circle centered at ( Q ) with radius ( m ).    - Draw the tangents from ( P ) to the circle.    - Mark the points where these tangents intersect the first parallel line.    - From these intersection points, draw lines parallel to the corresponding tangents until they intersect the second parallel line.    - The resulting quadrilateral is the desired rhombus.

Start by noting that points K and L lie outside the circumcircle of pentagon ABCDE, meaning circle omega encloses the circumcircle of ABCDE. 3. Since the circumcircle of ABCDE is tangent to omega at E, a similarity transformation mapping one circle to the other also maps point D to K and point A to L. Therefore, AD parallel KL.

The product of these two polynomials is a polynomial with even coefficients, not all of which are divisible by 4. 2. **To Prove**: One of the polynomials has all even coefficients, and the other has at least one odd coefficient. 3. **Assumption for Contradiction**:    Suppose both polynomials have at least one odd coefficient. 4. **Reduction Modulo 2**:    Replace each coefficient in both polynomials with its remainder when divided by 2. This essentially reduces our problem to working with polynomials over the field (mathbb{Z}_2), where coefficients are either 0 or 1. 5. **Representing Polynomials Modulo 2**:    Let the two polynomials be ( P(x) ) and ( Q(x) ). Under modulo 2 reduction, these can be written as:    [    P(x) = a_n x^n + a_{n-1} x^{n-1} + cdots + a_0    ]    and     [    Q(x) = b_m x^m + b_{m-1} x^{m-1} + cdots + b_0    ]    where (a_i, b_i in {0, 1}) for all ( i ). 6. **Product**:    The product of these polynomials modulo 2 is:    [    P(x) cdot Q(x) = (a_n x^n + a_{n-1} x^{n-1} + cdots + a_0) cdot (b_m x^m + b_{m-1} x^{m-1} + cdots + b_0)    ]    This results in a polynomial:    [    R(x) = c_{n+m} x^{n+m} + c_{n+m-1} x^{n+m-1} + cdots + c_0    ]    where each ( c_k ) is the sum of products of the coefficients ( a_i cdot b_j ) such that (i + j = k), all calculated modulo 2. 7. **Analysis of Coefficients**:    Since every coefficient in (P(x) cdot Q(x)) modulo 2 results from the sum of products of 0's and 1's, for any (c_k) to be even (0 modulo 2), an even number of odd products (a_i b_j = 1) must contribute to (c_k). 8. **Contradiction**:    If both (P(x)) and (Q(x)) contain odd terms, there will be at least one coefficient (c_k = 1) in the product (R(x)), implying at least one term is odd modulo 2. This contradicts the given condition that all coefficients are even (0 modulo 2). 9. **Conclusion**:    Therefore, our initial assumption that both polynomials can have odd coefficients must be false.

We need to show that ( d ) must be divisible by 6 for ( p - d, p, p + d ) to all be primes except possibly when ( p = 3 ).  1. **Case Analysis for ( d ):**     - **Case 1: ( p = 6m + 1 ), ( d = 6n + 2 )**         Let's evaluate the three numbers:         [         begin{aligned}         & text{First number:} quad (p - d) = 6m + 1 - (6n + 2) = 6(m - n) - 1,          & text{Second number:} quad p = 6m + 1,          & text{Third number:} quad (p + d) = 6m + 1 + (6n + 2) = 6(m + n) + 3.         end{aligned}         ]         The third number ( 6(m + n) + 3 ) is divisible by 3, which makes it composite for any integers ( m ) and ( n ). Thus, ( d = 6n + 2 ) leads to a composite number and this case is not valid.     - **Case 2: ( p = 6m - 1 ), ( d = 6n + 2 )**         Let's evaluate the three numbers:         [         begin{aligned}         & text{First number:} quad (p - d) = 6m - 1 - (6n + 2) = 6(m - n) - 3,          & text{Second number:} quad p = 6m - 1,          & text{Third number:} quad (p + d) = 6m - 1 + (6n + 2) = 6(m + n) + 1.         end{aligned}         ]         The first number ( 6(m - n) - 3 ) is of the form ( 6k - 3 ), which is not prime unless it is 3. If ( 6(m - n) - 3 = 3 ), then ( m - n = 1 ). Therefore, primes in the form ( 3, 6m - 1, 6m + 1 ).         However, we can argue in general terms that if ( d = 6n + 2 ) or ( d = 6k pm 2 ), one of the terms will not remain prime unless in special conditions. Thus, we discard this possibility in a general.     - **Case 3: ( p = 6m + 1 ), ( d = 6n - 2 )**         Let's evaluate the three numbers:         [         begin{aligned}         & text{First number:} quad (p - d) = 6m + 1 - (6n - 2) = 6(m - n) + 3,          & text{Second number:} quad p = 6m + 1,          & text{Third number:} quad (p + d) = 6m + 1 + (6n - 2) = 6(m + n) - 1.         end{aligned}         ]         The first number ( 6(m - n) + 3 ) is divisible by 3, making it composite for any ( m ) and ( n ). Thus, ( d = 6n - 2 ) is not valid generally.     - **Case 4: ( p = 6m - 1 ), ( d = 6n - 2 )**         Let's evaluate the three numbers:         [         begin{aligned}         & text{First number:} quad (p - d) = 6m - 1 - (6n - 2) = 6(m - n) + 1,          & text{Second number:} quad p = 6m - 1,          & text{Third number:} quad (p + d) = 6m - 1 + (6n - 2) = 6(m + n) - 3.         end{aligned}         ]         The third number ( 6(m + n) - 3 ) is divisible by 3, making it composite for any ( m ) and ( n ). Thus, ( d = 6n - 2 ) is not valid generally. 2. **Conclusion:** From the above case analyses, we see that: - If ( d = 6n + 2 ) or ( d = 6n - 2 ), a composite number results in our sequences. The only remaining general case needs ( d ) to be ( 6 times n ): [ d = 6k ] Thus, the common difference ( d ) of an arithmetic progression of three prime numbers (excluding case for ( p = 3 )) must be divisible by 6.

(2) The right focus of the ellipse is at (1, 0). When the line AB is perpendicular to the x-axis, the coordinates of A and B are (1, frac { sqrt {2}}{2}) and (1, -frac { sqrt {2}}{2}), respectively.   At this time, the product of the slopes of OA and OB, k_{OA} times k_{OB} = -frac {1}{2} neq -1, so the line AB is not perpendicular to the x-axis.   Let the slope of line AB be k, then the equation of line AB is y=k(x-1).   Solving this together with frac {x^{2}}{2}+ frac {y^{2}}{1}=1 gives (2k^{2}+1)x^{2}-4k^{2}x+2k^{2}-2=0.

Here is one possible valid arrangement: [ begin{array}{ll} (1, 2, 3), & (1, 4, 5), (1, 6, 7), & (1, 8, 9), (2, 4, 6), & (2, 7, 8), (2, 5, 9), & (3, 4, 8), (3, 5, 7), & (3, 6, 9), (4, 7, 9), & (5, 6, 8). end{array} ] By examining the above arrangement, we can see: - Each student is involved in ( binom{3}{2} times 3 = 9 ) paired encounters, ensuring that every pair meets exactly once.    Hence we verified that for ( n = 3 ), there exists a satisfying arrangement. 2. Now, we will prove that ( n ) has to be an odd number. Consider any one student. This student must pair with ( 3n - 1 ) other students once. There are ( 3 ) students working each day. Let’s analyze this specific student and the days they are on duty: - Since this student is working every day in a group of 3, every remaining ( 3n - 1 ) should be counted in pairs. - The number of pairings any given student must undergo with others is ( 3(n-1) ). Since every pair can occur exactly once and total pairings for each student is ( 3n - 1 ): [  2 mid (3n - 1) implies 3n - 1 text{ must be even} ] Rewriting this, we have: [  3n - 1 equiv 0 pmod{2} implies  3n equiv 1 pmod{2} implies  n equiv 1 pmod{2}  ] This equates to ( n ) being odd since the product of any odd number with 3 and subtracting 1 is always even. therefore This proves that ( n ) must be an odd number.

Let's check each option to see which functions satisfy this property: A. For f(x)=sqrt{x}, we have f(-x)=sqrt{-x} which is not defined for real values of x, hence f(-x)neq -f(x). B. For f(x)=ln |x|, we have f(-x)=ln|-x|=ln|x|=f(x), so f(-x) neq -f(x). C. For f(x)=frac {1}{x-1}, we have f(-x)=frac{1}{-x-1}. We need to check if this equals -f(x).

For f(x)=xcos x, we have f(-x)=-xcos(-x)=-xcos x (because cos(-x)=cos x as cosine is an even function). This satisfies f(-x)=-f(x), so f(x)=xcos x is an odd function.

Let ( t ) be the time when the first swimmer finishes. So, ( v_1 t = 1000 ). 5.

But, for ((abc)_8) to be an octal number, it must represent integers, and ( frac{n^2}{8} = (ab0)_8 ) must be an integer. Here, it would mean ((ab0)_8) is even, but given that squared numbers modulo 8 do not end in zero (handling their structure properties in octal), it leads to a contradiction.    - **Case 2: (n = 4k + 2)** for ( k in mathbb{Z} ):      [      n^2 = (4k + 2)^2 = 16k^2 + 16k + 4 = 8(2k^2 + 2k) + 4      ]      This implies ( c = 4 ).

First, we recognize that the recurrence relation for ( a_n ) is given by: [ a_n = a_{n-1} + a_{n-3} + a_{n-4} quad (n geqslant 5) ] Additionally, we are given the initial conditions: [ a_1 = 1, a_2 = 1, a_3 = 2, a_4 = 4 ] The problem requires us to prove two statements: 1. ( a_{2n+1} = a_{2n} + a_{2n-1} ) for ( n geq 1 ) 2. ( a_{2n+1}^2 = a_{2n} cdot a_{2n+2} ) for ( n geq 1 ) We will prove each statement separately.  Proof of the First Statement: 1. Base Case ( n = 1 ):    [    a_3 = a_2 + a_1 = 1 + 1 = 2    ]    This matches the given value of ( a_3 = 2 ). Hence, ( a_3 = a_2 + a_1 ) holds for ( n = 1 ). 2. Inductive Step:    - Assume that ( a_{2k+1} = a_{2k} + a_{2k-1} ) holds for all ( k < n ).        - Now consider ( n ):      [      a_{2n+1} = a_{2n} + a_{2n-2} + a_{2n-3} quad (text{by the recurrence relation})      ]        - Using the inductive hypothesis, we know:      [      a_{2n-1} = a_{2n-2} + a_{2n-3}      ]        - Hence,      [      a_{2n+1} = a_{2n} + a_{2n-1}      ] Thus, by mathematical induction, ( a_{2n+1} = a_{2n} + a_{2n-1} ) holds for all ( n geq 1 ).

Understanding the Problem: 1. **Tiles and Diagonals**:     - Each tile is a ( 2 times 1 ) rectangle.     - Each tile has a diagonal drawn from one corner to the opposite one.     - There are two types of tiles because the diagonal can be drawn in two different ways. 2. **Goal**:     - Arrange 18 such tiles to form a ( 6 times 6 ) square (total area ( 36)).     - Ensure no two diagonals end at the same point within the ( 6 times 6 ) square.  Step-by-Step Solution: 1. **Tile Arrangement**:     - Each ( 2 times 1 ) tile will cover exactly 2 unit cells in the ( 6 times 6 ) square.     - 18 tiles will cover exactly ( 18 times 2 = 36 ) cells, which perfectly covers the entire ( 6 times 6 ) area. 2. **Ensuring Non-Coinciding Diagonals**:     - We need to ensure the ends of the diagonals do not coincide. This means we must place the tiles such that the diagonals either do not meet at all or if they do meet, only in such a manner that described in the solution diagrams.  Visual Arrangement: By referring to a provided diagram (or creating one), we can visualize the exact tile placement. This arrangement seems to primarily rely on: - Placing the diagonals strategically in a repetitive pattern. - Ensuring diagonal intersections occur at specific planned points if any.  Conclusion: The configuration seen in the referenced diagram, which visually depicts a correct arrangement, shows that it is indeed possible to arrange the 18 tiles into a ( 6 times 6 ) grid without any coinciding diagonal endpoints. # Conclusion: [ boxed{text{Possible}} ]"},{"instruction":"Find all integer triples ((x, y, z)) such that: [ x^{2} + y^{2} + 1 = 2^{z} ]","output":"Given the Diophantine equation: x^2 + y^2 + 1 = 2^z, we need to find all integer triplets ((x, y, z)) that satisfy this equation. 1. **Considering the equation modulo 4:**    [    x^2 + y^2 + 1 = 2^z pmod{4}    ]    To analyze this, we need to consider the possible values of (x^2) and (y^2) modulo 4.    - If (x) is even, (x = 2k), then (x^2 = (2k)^2 = 4k^2 equiv 0 pmod{4}).    - If (x) is odd, (x = 2k+1), then (x^2 = (2k+1)^2 = 4k^2 + 4k + 1 equiv 1 pmod{4}).        Thus, the squares of integers modulo 4 can only be 0 or 1. 2. **Analyzing (x^2 + y^2) modulo 4:**    - If both (x) and (y) are even, then (x^2 equiv 0 pmod{4}) and (y^2 equiv 0 pmod{4}), thus (x^2 + y^2 equiv 0 pmod{4}).    - If (x) is even and (y) is odd (or vice versa), then (x^2 equiv 0 pmod{4}) and (y^2 equiv 1 pmod{4}), thus (x^2 + y^2 equiv 1 pmod{4}).    - If both (x) and (y) are odd, then (x^2 equiv 1 pmod{4}) and (y^2 equiv 1 pmod{4}), thus (x^2 + y^2 equiv 2 pmod{4}).    Therefore, (x^2 + y^2 equiv 0, 1, text{ or } 2 pmod{4}). 3. **Analyzing right-hand side (2^z) modulo 4:**    - For (z = 0), (2^0 = 1).    - For (z = 1), (2^1 = 2).    - For (z geq 2), (2^z equiv 0 pmod{4}). 4. **Matching the modulo results:**    - Since (x^2 + y^2 + 1 = 2^z ), the left side is ( equiv 1, 2, text{ or } 3 pmod{4}).    - However, (2^z equiv 0 pmod{4}) when (z geq 2), which creates a contradiction as (x^2 + y^2 + 1) can't be 0 modulo 4. Hence, (z leq 1).     5. **Case-by-case analysis for (z leq 1):**    - If (z = 0):      [      x^2 + y^2 + 1 = 1 implies x^2 + y^2 = 0 implies x = 0 text{ and } y = 0.      ]      The solution here is ((x, y, z) = (0, 0, 0)).        - If (z = 1):      [      x^2 + y^2 + 1 = 2 implies x^2 + y^2 = 1.      ]      The pairs ((x^2, y^2)) that satisfy this are:       - (x^2 = 1) and (y^2 = 0 implies (x, y) = (pm 1, 0))       - (x^2 = 0) and (y^2 = 1 implies (x, y) = (0, pm 1))            Thus, the solutions are ((x, y, z) = (1, 0, 1), (-1, 0, 1), (0, 1, 1), (0, -1, 1)). # Conclusion: The complete set of integer triplets ((x, y, z)) that satisfy the equation (x^2 + y^2 + 1 = 2^z) is: [ boxed{(0, 0, 0), (1, 0, 1), (-1, 0, 1), (0, 1, 1), (0, -1, 1)} ]"},{"instruction":"Given the sets M={0,1,2} and N={x|x=a^{2}, a in M}, then the set M cap N equals (    ) A: varnothing B: {0} C: {1} D: {0,1}","output":"**Analysis** This question mainly tests the application of sets, which is a common type of question in college entrance examinations and is considered a basic question. **Solution** From the given information, we have N={0,1,4}.

According to the information given: - 20% of the reporters cover local politics in country X. That means 20 reporters cover local politics in country X. - 20% of the reporters who cover politics do not cover local politics in country X. This means that 80% of the reporters who cover politics do cover local politics in country X. Since we know that 20 reporters cover local politics in country X and they represent 80% of all the reporters who cover politics, we can find out the total number of reporters who cover politics by setting up the equation: 80% of (reporters who cover politics) = 20 reporters 0.8 * (reporters who cover politics) = 20 (reporters who cover politics) = 20 / 0.8 (reporters who cover politics) = 25 So, there are 25 reporters who cover politics. Since 20 of them cover local politics in country X, the remaining 5 reporters cover other types of politics (since 20% of the 25 do not cover local politics in country X). Now, to find out the percent of reporters who do not cover politics at all, we subtract the number of reporters who cover politics (25) from the total number of reporters (100): 100 reporters - 25 reporters who cover politics = 75 reporters who do not cover politics To find the percentage: (75 reporters who do not cover politics / 100 total reporters) * 100% = 75% Therefore, boxed{75%}  of the reporters for the wire service do not cover politics."},{"instruction":"Given that the distance from the focus of an ellipse to its corresponding directrix is equal to the length of the semimajor axis, what is the eccentricity of the ellipse?","output":"From the given information, we have: frac{a^2}{c} - c = a Rearranging, we get: a^2 - c^2 - ac = 0 Since e = frac{c}{a}, we can substitute c = ae into the equation: a^2 - (ae)^2 - a^2e = 0 Simplifying, we obtain the quadratic equation for e: e^2 + e - 1 = 0 Solving this equation, we find two possible values for e: e = frac{-1 - sqrt{5}}{2} quad text{(rejected)} quad text{or} quad e = frac{sqrt{5} - 1}{2} Since eccentricity cannot be negative, we accept the latter solution: boxed{e = frac{sqrt{5} - 1}{2}}"},{"instruction":"The function fleft(xright)=frac{{axb}}{{9{x^2}}} is an odd function defined on left(3,3right), and fleft(1right)=frac{1}{8}.<br/>(1) Determine the analytical expression of fleft(xright);<br/>(2) Determine the monotonicity of fleft(xright) on left(3,3right), and prove your conclusion;<br/>(3) Solve the inequality related to t: fleft(t1right)+fleft(tright) lt 0.","output":"# Solution:  Part 1: Determine the analytical expression of fleft(xright) Given that fleft(xright) is an odd function, we have: - fleft(0right) = -frac{b}{9} = 0, leading to b = 0. - Substituting fleft(1right) = frac{1}{8}, we get frac{a-b}{8} = frac{1}{8}. From these conditions, we can solve for a and b: - Since fleft(0right) = 0, we immediately get b = 0. - Substituting fleft(1right) = frac{1}{8} gives frac{a - 0}{8} = frac{1}{8}, which simplifies to a = 1. Therefore, the analytical expression of fleft(xright) is fleft(xright) = frac{x}{9-x^2}.  Part 2: Determine the monotonicity of fleft(xright) To determine the monotonicity: - Let -3 < x_1 < x_2 < 3. - The difference f(x_1) - f(x_2) can be rewritten as frac{x_1}{9-x_1^2} - frac{x_2}{9-x_2^2}. - This simplifies to frac{(9-x_1x_2)(x_1-x_2)}{(9-x_1^2)(9-x_2^2)}. - Since -3 < x_1, x_2 < 3, we know 9-x_1x_2 > 0, and hence, if x_1 < x_2, then x_1 - x_2 < 0, making the whole fraction negative. Thus, f(x_1) < f(x_2), proving that fleft(xright) is monotonically increasing on left(-3,3right).  Part 3: Solve the inequality fleft(t-1right)+fleft(tright) < 0 Given that fleft(xright) is an odd function: - We can rewrite the inequality as fleft(t-1right) < -fleft(tright) = fleft(-tright). - Since fleft(xright) is monotonically increasing on left(-3,3right), we must have:   - -3 < t-1 < 3,   - -3 < -t < 3,   - t-1 < -t. Solving these inequalities: - From -3 < t-1 < 3, we get -2 < t < 4. - From -3 < -t < 3, we get -3 < t < 3. - From t-1 < -t, we get t < frac{1}{2}.

Therefore, all integers (geq (B-1)A) are green. 5. **Non-Green Number Analysis**:     - To identify non-green numbers, we must consider numbers less than ((B-1)A - B).     - Explicitly, these are numbers from 1 to ((B-1)A - B).     - The total number of non-green numbers is given by sums over certain floors: (leftlfloor frac{kA}{B} rightrfloor ) for ( k = 1 ) to ( B-1 ). 6. **Counting Non-Green Numbers**:     - Evaluate the total count of these non-green numbers:     [     sum_{k=1}^{B-1} leftlfloor frac{kA}{B} rightrfloor     ]     - This expression simplifies based on properties of floor functions when ( A ) and ( B ) are coprime. 7. **Solving the Equation**:     - We need this sum to equal exactly 35 since there are 35 non-green numbers.     - It is established that ((A-1)(B-1) = 70), which factors as ( 70 = 2 times 5 times 7 ). 8. **Valid Combinations**:     - Possible coprime pairs ((A, B)) include:         - ( A = 11 ), ( B = 8 )         - ( A = 8 ), ( B = 11 )         - (Other combinations do not satisfy the coprimality constraint). 9. **Confirmation**:     - Validate if 58 is indeed a non-green number for any of these pairs.     - For ( A = 11 ) and ( B = 8 ):         [         58 = 5 times 11 + 2 quad text{and} quad 58 = 7 times 8 + 5         ]       - No combination of non-negative ( x ) and ( y ) can form 58 using ( 11 times x + 8 times y = 58 ). 10. **Conclusion**:     - After verifying the constraints and cross-checking with the set conditions, the values satisfying the finite exception and specific number inclusion are: [ boxed{A=11, , B=8} ]"},{"instruction":"hief runs away from a with a speed of 20 km / hr . a police from a station 60 km away started chasing him after 1 hr . with a speed of 40 km / hr . time taken by the police to catch the thief is","output":"Let's calculate the distance the thief has covered before the police start chasing him.

Then, we get:      [      a^2 equiv 1 pmod{p} implies (a-1)(a+1) equiv 0 pmod{p}      ]      Since ( p ) is prime, either ( a - 1 equiv 0 pmod{p} ) or ( a + 1 equiv 0 pmod{p} ). Therefore, either ( a equiv 1 pmod{p} ) or ( a equiv -1 pmod{p} ). But ( a ) is specifically chosen such that ( 2 leq a leq p-2 ), hence neither ( a equiv 1 ) nor ( a equiv -1 ) hold. Thus, ( i neq a ). 5. **Verification for other values:**    - If ( i = p-1 ), then:      [      (p-1)a equiv -a equiv p-a pmod{p}      ]      Since ( 1 < a < p-1 ), we have ( 1 < p-a < p-1 ), so ( p-a ) cannot be congruent to 1 modulo ( p ).        - Likewise, if ( i = 1 ):      [      a equiv 1 pmod{p}      ]      which contradicts the selection criteria for ( a ) (since ( a ) is not equal to 1). 6. **Uniqueness of ( i ):**    - Suppose there exist two different integers ( i, j ) with ( i neq j ), ( i neq a ), ( j neq a ) such that:      [      ia equiv ja pmod{p}      ]      Then:      [      (i - j)a equiv 0 pmod{p}      ]      Since ( gcd(a, p) = 1 ), it follows that:      [      i - j equiv 0 pmod{p} implies i equiv j pmod{p}      ]      This contradicts the assumption that ( i neq j ). Hence, such ( i ) is unique. From the analysis, we conclude: [ boxed{i} ] is a distinct integer from the set ( 1, 2, ldots, p-2 ) that is not equal to ( a ) and ( p-1 ), and satisfies ( ia equiv 1pmod{p} )."},{"instruction":"Every Halloween one house in the neighborhood gives out toothbrushes instead of candy, so it always gets egged and covered in toilet paper.

Consider a line ( l ) that intersects the two given circles at four points, say ( A_1, B_1 ) and ( A_2, B_2 ). Let ( O_1 ) and ( O_2 ) be the centers of the circles with radii ( R_1 ) and ( R_2 ), respectively.  2. Define the arcs ( A_1 B_1 ) and ( A_2 B_2 ) as subtending angles ( 2alpha_1 ) and ( 2alpha_2 ) at ( O_1 ) and ( O_2 ), respectively. 3. Let ( K ) be the intersection point of the tangents to the circles at points ( A_1 ) and ( A_2 ). 4. By the Law of Sines in the triangles formed, we have:    [    frac{KA_1}{KA_2} = frac{sin alpha_2}{sin alpha_1}    ]    Consequently, multiplying both sides by ( KA_1 KA_2 sin alpha_1 ), we obtain:    [    KA_1 sin alpha_1 = KA_2 sin alpha_2    ] 5. Using the Pythagorean theorem in the right-angled triangles formed by ( K, A_1, O_1 ) and ( K, A_2, O_2 ), we can write:    [    KO_1^2 = KA_1^2 + R_1^2    ]    [    KO_2^2 = KA_2^2 + R_2^2    ] 6. Substituting ( KA_1 ) and ( KA_2 ) from the sine equation, we get:    [    (sin^2 alpha_1) KO_1^2 - (sin^2 alpha_2) KO_2^2 = (R_1 sin alpha_1)^2 - (R_2 sin alpha_2)^2 = q    ]    where ( q ) is some constant. 7. Similarly, this reasoning holds for the intersection points of the tangents at ( B_1 ) and ( B_2 ), and other points formed by intersection tangents. 8. All points that satisfy the above condition ((sin^2 alpha_1) x O_1^2 - (sin^2 alpha_2) x O_2^2 = q) lie on a particular geometric locus. 9. This locus is indeed a circle whose center lies on the line joining the centers of the two given circles ( O_1 ) and ( O_2 ). This is established as a generic property of the tangents and circles involved and follows from the properties of the Fermat-Apollonian Circle. **Conclusion:** The center of the circumscribed circle of the quadrilateral formed by the tangents lies on the line joining the centers of the given circles.

Since ( a ) and ( b ) are constants and the problem states that neither ( a ) nor ( b ) are equal to 1, the domain is then:     - ( x in mathbb{R} setminus { 1, a, b } )  Finding the Range: 1. To determine the range of the function, we need to simplify it. Start by rewriting the given function:  f(x) = frac{1}{1-x} left( x + frac{a}{1-a} + frac{b-x}{(1-a)(1-b)} right)  2. Simplify the expression inside the parentheses:    - First, bring all terms inside the parentheses over a common denominator ((1-a)(1-b)):    [    frac{x (1-a)(1-b)}{(1-a)(1-b)} + frac{a(1-b)}{(1-a)(1-b)} + frac{b-x}{(1-a)(1-b)}    ] 3. Combine the numerators:    [    = frac{x(1-a)(1-b) + a(1-b) + b-x}{(1-a)(1-b)}    ] 4. Expand and simplify the numerator:    [    x(1-a)(1-b) + a(1-b) + b - x = x(1 - a - b + ab) + a(1 - b) + b - x    ] 5. Combine like terms:    [    = x(1 - a - b + ab) + a - ab + b - x    ]    [    = (a + b - ab) - x(a + b - ab)    ]    [    = (1-x)(a+b-ab)    ] 6. Substitute this back:    [    f(x) = frac{1}{1-x} cdot frac{(1-x)(a+b-ab)}{(1-a)(1-b)}    ] 7. Simplify by canceling ( 1-x ):    [    f(x) = frac{a + b - ab}{(1-a)(1-b)}    ] 8. Notice that the simplified form of ( f(x) ) is independent of ( x ). Hence, the only possible value ( f(x) ) can take is:    - ( f(x) = frac{a + b - ab}{(1-a)(1-b)} )  Conclusion: - Domain: ( x in mathbb{R} setminus { 1, a, b } ) - Range: The function ( f(x) ) takes a constant value given by ( frac{a + b - ab}{(1-a)(1-b)} ) [ boxed{x in mathbb{R} setminus { 1, a, b },  f(x) = frac{a + b - ab}{(1-a)(1-b)}} ]"},{"instruction":"A function f(x) is defined on mathbb{R} with its derivative f''(x).

We need to find the rotation angle ( x ) such that the area of the intersection ( [H cap H_x] ) is minimized, where ( H_x ) is the rectangle ( H ) rotated by ( x ) degrees around its center. 2. **Analyzing the Geometry:**    - The angle between the diagonals of a rectangle is always ( 90^circ ). The condition that this angle is (leq 45^circ) implies that the rectangle is actually a square. This is because only in a square, the diagonals bisect each other at ( 90^circ ) and the angle between any two lines drawn from the center to the vertices is ( 45^circ ). 3. **Rotation and Intersection:**    - When we rotate a square ( H ) by ( x ) degrees around its center, the area of intersection ( [H cap H_x] ) will depend on the overlap of the two squares.    - The minimum area of intersection occurs when the squares are rotated such that their sides are aligned at ( 45^circ ) to each other. This is because at ( 45^circ ), the overlap is minimized. 4. **Calculating the Minimum Intersection Area:**    - When ( x = 45^circ ), the two squares intersect in such a way that the intersection forms an octagon. The area of this octagon is less than the area of the square.    - For any other angle ( x ) between ( 0^circ ) and ( 360^circ ), the area of intersection will be larger than at ( 45^circ ). 5. **Conclusion:**    - Therefore, the rotation angle ( x ) that minimizes the area of intersection ( [H cap H_x] ) is ( 45^circ ).

For all different integers m and n, we have: [ (m - n) mid (f(m) - f(n)) ] We start by analyzing the properties and constraints imposed by these conditions. **Step 1: Analysis of Condition (1)** For condition (1), we consider the values of n!. Notice that n! grows very rapidly with increasing n. Given f(n!) = f(n)!, it is clear that if f(n) were to behave non-trivially, it must respect this factorial constraint. Consider possible functions: - A constant function cannot satisfy f(n!) = f(n)! unless f(n) is very restricted.  Assume f is not constant. Let's explore this possibility: # Step 2: Analysis of Condition (2) Let us assume f is not constant and consider the general case defined by condition (2): [ (m - n) mid (f(m) - f(n)) ] This implies for integers ( m ) and ( n ): 1. We try m = a, where a is an integer such that f(a) = a. We assume such ( a ) exists.    Observing f(a), we get a!, (a!)!, etc., all remain fixed points under f. # Step 3: Evaluation of Remaining Elements Using the above assumptions, we extend our exploration to the entire sequence {a_k} to verify whether it suits the criterion: [ (a_k - n) mid (f(a_k) - f(n)) ] Especially,  [ (a_k - n) mid (f(n) - n) ] For arbitrary n, we deduce that f(n) = n. # Step 4: No Fixed Points Larger Than 2 Suppose fixed points only exist for values less than or equal to 2. Consider a prime ( p > 3 ): Using Wilson's theorem, we know for a prime p: [ (p - 2)! equiv 1 mod p ] Hence, analyze f((p-2)!): 1. Compute f((p - 2)!) - f(1) = f((p - 2)!) - f(1) as multiples of p.

This gives us b = 1. Step 2: Use the definition of a hyperbola. For a point A on the left branch of the hyperbola, the difference in distances to the foci F_{2} and F_{1} is |AF_{2}| - |AF_{1}| = 2a.

So the total amount paid in installments is: 9 payments * 57/payment = 513 Final payment = 21 Total paid in installments = 513 + 21 = 534 Now, let's calculate the total amount paid including the down payment: Down payment = 300 Total paid in installments = 534 Total amount paid = 300 + 534 = 834 The cost of the encyclopedias was 750, so the amount borrowed was the cost minus the down payment: Amount borrowed = Cost - Down payment Amount borrowed = 750 - 300 = 450 The total amount paid was 834, and the amount borrowed was 450, so the amount of interest paid is the difference between these two amounts: Interest paid = Total amount paid - Amount borrowed Interest paid = 834 - 450 = 384 Now, to find the interest paid as a percent of the amount borrowed, we use the formula: Interest percent = (Interest paid / Amount borrowed) * 100 Interest percent = (384 / 450) * 100 Interest percent = 0.8533 * 100 Interest percent = 85.33% So, the amount of interest paid was boxed{85.33%}  of the amount borrowed."},{"instruction":"Lines ( L_{1}, L_{2}, cdots, L_{100} ) are distinct, with all lines ( L_{4n} ) being parallel to each other (where ( n ) is a positive integer), and all lines ( L_{4n3} ) passing through a known point (where ( n ) is a positive integer).

All lines L_{4n-3} (n being a positive integer) pass through a given point. What is the maximum number of intersection points in the whole set?  To find the maximum number of intersection points among the given lines, we need to follow these steps: 1. **Counting Total Intersection Points if all Lines intersect Mutually:**    If all 100 lines intersect pairwise, the total number of intersection points is given by the combination formula:    [    binom{100}{2} = frac{100 times 99}{2} = 4950    ] 2. **Accounting for Parallel Lines and Common Point Passes:**    The lines L_{4n} are parallel to each other. There are 25 such lines because:    [    n in {1, 2, 3, ldots, 25}    ]        Parallel lines do not intersect each other. The number of intersection points among these 25 parallel lines is:    [    binom{25}{2} = frac{25 times 24}{2} = 300    ] 3. **Excluding Overcounted Intersections at the Given Point:**    Each set of lines L_{4n-3} passes through a common point. There are also 25 such lines:    [    n in {1, 2, 3, ldots, 25}    ]    At the common point, there is exactly one intersection instead of binom{25}{2} = 300. Hence, we must subtract the excess counted intersections, which is:    [    300 - 1 = 299    ] 4. **Final Count of Intersection Points:**    The maximum number of unique intersection points is:    [    text{Total intersections} - text{Parallel line intersections} - text{Overcounted intersections} = 4950 - 300 - 299    ]    [    = 4950 - 599 = 4351    ] Conclusion: [ boxed{4351} ]"},{"instruction":"There is a point inside a convex quadrilateral such that connecting this point to the vertices forms four triangles of equal area. Prove that this point lies on one of the diagonals of the quadrilateral.","output":"1. **Identify the Internal Point P**:        Let P be the internal point mentioned in the problem. 2. **Equality of Triangle Areas**:        Since the triangles  triangle APB,  triangle BCP,  triangle CDP, and  triangle DAP all have equal areas, we can denote this common area as A:        [    text{Area}(triangle APB) = text{Area}(triangle BCP) = text{Area}(triangle CDP) = text{Area}(triangle DAP) = A    ] 3. **Height Proportionality**:        To have equal areas, the heights from point P to the sides must be proportional to match the base lengths of the sides. For instance, for the triangles triangle APB and triangle BCP sharing the side BP, the heights from P to AB and BC must be equal.        If the height from P to AB is h_{APB} and height from P to BC is h_{BCP} then we have:        [    frac{1}{2} cdot AB cdot h_{APB} = frac{1}{2} cdot BC cdot h_{BCP}    ]        Given that these triangles have the same area A, we get:        [    AB cdot h_{APB} = BC cdot h_{BCP}    ]        Similar logic applies to other sides and heights. 4. **Special Case of T_1 and T_2**:        If the heights from P to the corresponding sides of the triangles T_1 and T_2 coincide, P would lie directly on the midpoint of these diagonals. Otherwise:        - T_1 and T_2 must form a parallelogram which implies the diagonals bisect each other. 5. **Diagonals Bisect Each Other**:        By properties of parallelograms, the diagonals bisect each other. So, each pair of triangles  triangle APB and  triangle BCP implies:        [    BP text{ bisects } AC    ]        and similarly for other sides. Hence:        - If T_1 and T_2 coincide, P would be on the bisecting line (diagonal) of AC.     - Similarly, if considered for other sides, PD would bisect AC. 6. **Conclusion on Point P**:        Since both BP and PD bisect AC (the diagonal), P must lie on the diagonal AC. This same reasoning applied to the other diagonal also verifies P on it. Therefore, it follows that point P must be on the diagonal of the convex quadrilateral, affirming what we need to prove. blacksquare"},{"instruction":"Point   D  is chosen on the side   AB  of triangle   ABC .

Therefore, (angle DAC = 90^circ - angle LBE). 7. **Similar triangles**:    - Note that (angle ACD = angle LCE) (from the conditions) and (angle ADC = angle AEC) (because ( ADEC ) is cyclic).

It is stipulated that the selling price of cherries per kilogram should not be lower than the purchase price and not higher than 40 yuan. A market survey found that the daily sales volume y (in kilograms) of cherries satisfies a linear function relationship with the selling price x (in yuan) per kilogram. Some corresponding data is shown in the table below: | Selling Price (yuan per kilogram) | ... | 25 | 30 | 35 | ... | ||||||| | Daily Sales Volume (kilograms)    | ... | 110| 100| 90 | ... | (1) Find the functional relationship between y and x.

What is the maximum profit?","output":"(1) To find the functional relationship between y and x, we assume y = kx + b. Using the given data points (25, 110) and (30, 100), we can set up the following system of equations: [ begin{align*} 25k + b &= 110,  30k + b &= 100. end{align*} ] Subtracting the first equation from the second gives us: [ 5k = -10 implies k = -2. ] Substituting k = -2 into the first equation, we get: [ 25(-2) + b = 110 implies b = 160. ] Therefore, the functional relationship between y and x is y = -2x + 160. (2) To achieve a daily sales profit of 1000 yuan, we use the profit formula based on the selling price x and the purchase price (20 yuan): [ (x - 20)(-2x + 160) = 1000. ] Expanding and simplifying this equation gives: [ -2x^2 + 200x - 3200 = 1000 implies -2x^2 + 200x - 4200 = 0. ] Solving this quadratic equation, we find that x = 30 or x = 70. Considering the constraint that 20 leq x leq 40, we conclude that the selling price per kilogram of cherries should be boxed{30 text{ yuan}}. (3) To maximize the daily sales profit w, we express w as a function of x: [ w = (x - 20)(-2x + 160) = -2x^2 + 200x - 3200. ] This can be rewritten as: [ w = -2(x - 50)^2 + 1800. ] Since the coefficient of the quadratic term is negative, the parabola opens downwards, indicating that the maximum value of w occurs at the vertex of the parabola, which is at x = 50. However, since the selling price x must be between 20 and 40 yuan, we find that as x increases from 20 to 40, w increases towards its maximum value within the given constraints. Thus, when x = 40, w reaches its maximum value: [ w = -2(40 - 50)^2 + 1800 = 1600. ] Therefore, when the selling price per kilogram of cherries is set at boxed{40 text{ yuan}}, the daily sales profit is maximized at boxed{1600 text{ yuan}}."},{"instruction":"There are 8 blue, 8 red, and 11 white bulbs.

This condition must hold for both segments of the piecewise function. 2. **Analyzing the quadratic part ax^2 - x - frac{1}{4} for x leq 1:** For the function to be decreasing, its derivative must be negative. The derivative of ax^2 - x - frac{1}{4} is 2ax - 1. Setting 2ax - 1 < 0 gives x < frac{1}{2a}. Since this must be true for all x leq 1, we have frac{1}{2a} geq 1, leading to a leq frac{1}{2}. 3. **Analyzing the logarithmic part log_a x - 1 for x > 1:** For f(x) = log_a x - 1 to be decreasing, we consider the base of the logarithm. Since the logarithm function is decreasing for 0 < a < 1, it satisfies the condition for f(x) to be decreasing. 4. **Ensuring continuity at x = 1:** For the function to be continuous at x = 1, the two parts must equal at this point. Thus, a(1)^2 - 1 - frac{1}{4} = log_a 1 - 1, simplifying to a - 1 - frac{1}{4} = -1. Solving this gives a = frac{1}{4}. Combining these conditions, we find that 0 < a < 1, frac{1}{2a} geq 1, and a geq frac{1}{4}, which collectively imply frac{1}{4} leq a leq frac{1}{2}.

Firstly, let's consider the exchange rates given in the problem.     - For 20 silver coins, you can buy a cloak and receive 4 gold coins change.     - For 15 silver coins, you can buy a cloak and receive 1 gold coin change. 2. Now, let's analyze and compare these two scenarios to understand the conversion rate between silver and gold coins. 3. In the first case:     - You pay 20 silver coins and get back 4 gold coins.     - Essentially, this means you are exchanging 20 - 4 gold coins ( approx 16 ) for a cloak.      4. In the second case:     - You pay 15 silver coins and get back 1 gold coin.     - Thus, you exchange 15 -  1 gold coins ( = 14 ) silver coins for a cloak. 5. Comparing the two scenarios:     - Paying 20 silver coins instead of 15 ( i.e., 5 ) extra silver coins gets you 4 gold coins instead of 1 gold coin ( i.e., 3 ) extra gold coins.     - This indicates that 5 silver ( implies 3 ) gold coins.     - Thus, the exchange rate between silver and gold coins is 5 silver coins ( approx 3 ) gold coins. 6. For the given problem:     - You buy a cloak for 14 gold coins.      7. Consider the value of the cloak in gold coins (from the above observation):     - We derived the cost of a cloak to be 8 gold coins (from the detailed comparison).     - Paying 14 gold coins for a cloak worth 8 gold coins means you get back 14 - 8 = 6 gold coins as change. 8. Finally, convert the change back to silver coins using the exchange rate:     - We know 3 gold coins = 5 silver coins.     - Therefore, 6 gold coins ( approx 2 ) times the exchange, thus ( 6 times frac{5}{3} = 2 times 5 approx 10 ) silver coins. # Conclusion: [ boxed{10} ]"},{"instruction":"The sum of all numbers of the form 2k + 1, where k takes on integral values from 1 to n is:  textbf{(A)} n^2qquadtextbf{(B)} n(n+1)qquadtextbf{(C)} n(n+2)qquadtextbf{(D)} (n+1)^2qquadtextbf{(E)} (n+1)(n+2)","output":"1. **Identify the sequence**: The problem asks for the sum of numbers of the form 2k + 1 where k ranges from 1 to n.

After the second drop, the ball rebounds again to 50% of the previous rebound height: Rebound height after 2nd drop = 50 cm * 50% = 25 cm By the time it touches the floor for the third time, the ball has traveled an additional 50 cm downwards and then 25 cm upwards.

Because the point (4, -sqrt{10}) lies on the hyperbola, it satisfies the equation, yielding 4^2 - (-sqrt{10})^2 = 16 - 10 = 6. Therefore, we have c^2 = 6 and c = sqrt{6}. Given the eccentricity e = sqrt{2}, we have a = frac{c}{e} = frac{sqrt{6}}{sqrt{2}} = sqrt{3}, and thus a^2 = 3. To find b^2, we use c^2 = a^2 + b^2 to get b^2 = c^2 - a^2 = 6 - 3 = 3.

Since A(-1,2) is on the graph of the inverse proportion function, we can use the formula y=frac{k}{x} to find the constant k:    [    2 = frac{k}{-1} implies k = -1 times 2 = -2.    ] 2. With k=-2, the equation of the inverse proportion function becomes y=frac{-2}{x}. This function is defined in the second and fourth quadrants, where y increases as x increases because the function is decreasing (as x increases, the absolute value of frac{-2}{x} decreases, but since it's negative, y increases). 3. Given that m>0, both points B(m,y_{1}) and C(m+1,y_{2}) are in the fourth quadrant where x>0. 4. To compare y_{1} and y_{2}, we substitute m and m+1 into the function:    - For B(m,y_{1}): y_{1} = frac{-2}{m}.    - For C(m+1,y_{2}): y_{2} = frac{-2}{m+1}. 5. Since m>0, m+1>m, and thus frac{-2}{m+1}<frac{-2}{m}. This means y_{2}<y_{1}. However, considering the nature of the inverse proportion function in the fourth quadrant and the initial solution's conclusion, it appears there was a misunderstanding in the final comparison step due to the function's behavior. Correcting this, as x increases (from m to m+1), the value of y actually decreases in the context of an inverse proportion function with a negative k. Therefore, the correct relationship, following the initial solution's logic and correcting the oversight, should be: [y_{1} < y_{2},] since the function is decreasing in value as x increases, but since we are dealing with negative values, the magnitude of y decreases, making y_{1} less than y_{2} in the context of the question's setup.

This will give us a right triangle since each angle in the rhombus cuts the 90^circ angle into 45^circ angles. 4. **Intersection with the circle**:    - Draw a circle centered at R with radius a.    - This circle with radius a will intersect the line through R at points B and B_1 such that AB = a and AB_1 = a. 5. **Positioning C and C_1**:    - Draw circles centered at B and B_1 both with radius a.    - These circles will intersect the line AR again at points C and C_1 besides intersecting at A. 6. **Validate the vertices**:    - We now form rhombus with points A, B, C and A, B_1, C_1 as its vertices. 7. **Confirm the construction**:    - Identify O and O_1 as the perpendicular drop from the vertices B and B_1 onto AC.

According to the problem, the ratio of the amounts received by p and q is 5:4, and the ratio of the amounts received by q and r is 9:10. To find the combined ratio of P:Q:R, we need to make the Q part of both ratios the same. We can do this by multiplying the ratios by factors that will equalize the Q part. The first ratio is P:Q = 5:4, and the second ratio is Q:R = 9:10. To equalize the Q part, we can multiply the first ratio by 9 and the second ratio by 4 (since 9 and 4 are the respective Q parts of the original ratios).

To place the cube within a spatial right-angled coordinate system such that all coordinates of the vertices are integers, we take a cube with edge length equal to the unit length of the coordinate system.

Another simple configuration involves setting each coordinate of the vertices to either +1 or -1. The vertices of the cube will then be:    (+1,+1,+1), (+1,+1,-1), (+1,-1,+1), (+1,-1,-1), (-1,+1,+1), (-1,+1,-1), (-1,-1,+1), (-1,-1,-1) 3. For a regular tetrahedron, we can select one vertex of a cube and the three endpoints of the diagonals extending from this vertex. From the cube in step 1, the four vertices that sum to even numbers and the four that sum to odd numbers each form a regular tetrahedron. Similarly, from the configuration in step 2, the four vertices with an even number of negative signs and those with an odd number form regular tetrahedra. 4. A regular octahedron can be determined by the six points on the three coordinate axes where the distance from the origin is 1 (i.e., (pm 1)). These points are:    (1,0,0), (-1,0,0), (0,1,0), (0,-1,0), (0,0,1), (0,0,-1)    These form a regular octahedron whose convex hull consists of equilateral triangles. 5. For the regular dodecahedron and icosahedron, the desired placement of their vertices such that all coordinates are integers is not possible. The dodecahedron's faces are regular pentagons, and the icosahedron has vertices at the endpoints of five edges forming a regular pentagon within its arrangement. To prove that a regular pentagon cannot be arranged in space with all integer coordinates:    Let points (A), (B), and (C) of the pentagon satisfy (AB = AC) with ∠BAC=108° and suppose contrary to our claim that they have integer coordinates. Using the cosine rule:    [    cos 108^circ = frac{AB^2 + AC^2 - BC^2}{2AB cdot AC}    ]    implies:    [    cos^2 108^circ = frac{(AB^2 + AC^2 - BC^2)^2}{4AB^2 cdot AC^2} = frac{3 - sqrt{5}}{8}    ]    which is irrational. Hence, (AB, AC, BC) cannot all be integers, disproving the existence of such a regular pentagon arrangement. # Conclusion:  The only regular polyhedra that can be placed in a spatial right-angled coordinate system with all integer vertex coordinates are the cube, regular tetrahedron, and regular octahedron.

The rules of the game are: bullet  Carolyn always has the first turn. bullet  Carolyn and Paul alternate turns. bullet  On each of her turns, Carolyn must remove one number from the list such that this number has at least one positive divisor other than itself remaining in the list. bullet  On each of his turns, Paul must remove from the list all of the positive divisors of the number that Carolyn has just removed. bullet  If Carolyn cannot remove any more numbers, then Paul removes the rest of the numbers. For example, if n=6, a possible sequence of moves is shown in this chart: begin{tabular}{|c|c|c|} hline Player & Removed # & # remaining  hline Carolyn & 4 & 1, 2, 3, 5, 6  hline Paul & 1, 2 & 3, 5, 6  hline Carolyn & 6 & 3, 5  hline Paul & 3 & 5  hline Carolyn & None & 5  hline Paul & 5 & None  hline end{tabular} Note that Carolyn can't remove 3 or 5 on her second turn, and can't remove any number on her third turn. In this example, the sum of the numbers removed by Carolyn is 4+6=10 and the sum of the numbers removed by Paul is 1+2+3+5=11. Suppose that n=6 and Carolyn removes the integer 2 on her first turn. Determine the sum of the numbers that Carolyn removes.","output":"To solve this problem, we follow the sequence of moves as described, starting with the list of integers from 1 to 6.  1. Carolyn's first move is to remove 2. This is given in the problem statement.  2. Following Carolyn's move, Paul must remove all positive divisors of 2 from the list. The only positive divisor of 2 other than itself is 1. So, Paul removes 1.     After these moves, the list is updated to: 3, 4, 5, 6. 3. Carolyn must now remove a number that has at least one positive divisor other than itself remaining in the list. The only number that fits this criterion is 6, as its divisors include 3, which is still in the list.     Carolyn removes 6. 4. Paul's turn follows, and he must remove all positive divisors of 6 from the list. The only positive divisor of 6 other than itself remaining is 3.     Paul removes 3.    After these moves, the list is updated to: 4, 5. 5. At this point, Carolyn cannot remove either of the remaining numbers (4 or 5) because neither has a positive divisor other than itself remaining in the list.  6. Thus, Paul removes the remaining numbers, which are 4 and 5. Summarizing the numbers removed by Carolyn, we have 2 and 6. The sum of these numbers is calculated as follows: [2 + 6 = 8] Therefore, the sum of the numbers that Carolyn removes is boxed{8}. Paul, on the other hand, removes 1, 3, 4, and 5. The sum of these numbers is: [1 + 3 + 4 + 5 = 13] However, the problem specifically asks for the sum of the numbers that Carolyn removes, which we have found to be boxed{8}."},{"instruction":"Given that frac{sin(pi + alpha)cos(alpha + 4pi)}{cos alpha} = frac{1}{2}, find the value of cos(frac{pi}{2} + alpha).","output":"From the given equation, frac{sin(pi + alpha)cos(-alpha + 4pi)}{cos alpha} = frac{1}{2}, we can simplify it as follows: 1. First, we know that sin(pi + alpha) = -sin(alpha) and cos(-alpha + 4pi) = cos(alpha), so we can rewrite the equation as frac{-sin(alpha)cos(alpha)}{cos(alpha)} = frac{1}{2}. 2. Canceling out cos(alpha) from the numerator and the denominator, we get -sin(alpha) = frac{1}{2}. 3. Solving for sin(alpha), we find that sin(alpha) = -frac{1}{2}. 4. Now, to find cos(frac{pi}{2} + alpha), we use the cofunction identity cos(frac{pi}{2} + alpha) = -sin(alpha). 5. Substituting the value of sin(alpha) into the equation, we get cos(frac{pi}{2} + alpha) = -(-frac{1}{2}) = boxed{frac{1}{2}}."}]`),P={name:"App",components:{PoemCard:B},data(){return{searchQuery:"",visibleCount:4,poemsData:D,isLoading:!1}},computed:{filteredPoems(){const n=this.searchQuery.trim().toLowerCase();return n?this.poemsData.filter(e=>e.instruction&&e.instruction.toLowerCase().includes(n)||e.output&&e.output.toLowerCase().includes(n)):this.poemsData},displayedPoems(){return this.searchQuery.trim()?this.filteredPoems:this.filteredPoems.slice(0,this.visibleCount)},hasMorePoems(){return!this.searchQuery.trim()&&this.visibleCount<this.poemsData.length}},methods:{async loadMore(){this.isLoading=!0,await new Promise(n=>setTimeout(n,1e3)),this.visibleCount+=4,this.isLoading=!1}}},F={class:"search-container"},z={class:"card-container"},N={key:0,class:"empty-state"},M=["disabled"],E={key:0},I={key:1};function W(n,e,h,u,o,r){const m=g("PoemCard");return i(),a("section",null,[e[4]||(e[4]=t("div",{class:"top-banner"},[t("div",{class:"top-banner-title"},[t("div",{class:"top-banner-title-text"},"🤔prompts chat🧠")])],-1)),t("div",F,[e[3]||(e[3]=t("span",{class:"search-icon"},"🔍",-1)),b(t("input",{type:"text",class:"search-input","onUpdate:modelValue":e[0]||(e[0]=s=>o.searchQuery=s),placeholder:"Search..."},null,512),[[x,o.searchQuery]]),o.searchQuery?(i(),a("button",{key:0,class:"clear-search",onClick:e[1]||(e[1]=s=>o.searchQuery="")}," ✕ ")):c("",!0)]),t("div",z,[(i(!0),a(w,null,y(r.displayedPoems,(s,p)=>(i(),v(m,{key:p,poem:s},null,8,["poem"]))),128)),r.displayedPoems.length===0?(i(),a("div",N,' No results found for "'+l(o.searchQuery)+'".
