Write a sentence that about [Albuquerque, New Mexico AREA_CODE 505, 575].","output":"Albuquerque, New Mexico, is a vibrant and historic city known not only for its rich cultural heritage, Native American and Spanish influences, but also for its area codes 505 and 575. Situated in the heart of the state, it's enclosed by the Sandia Mountains to the east and the Rio Grande to the west, forming a picturesque natural backdrop that sets it apart from other locations in New Mexico. The 505 area code encompasses largely the metropolitan area of Albuquerque and the northern and western parts of New Mexico, attributed to populous and economically significant regions such as Santa Fe and Farmington. This area code has been in effect since the inception of area codes in 1947, serving as a critical identifier for telecommunications in this terrain of stunning landscapes, unspoiled wilderness, and rich Native American culture. However, due to increasing demand for telephone numbers and the limitation of numeric combinations, the 575 area code was introduced in 2007 to cater to new numbers in the region. This was mainly to serve the southern and eastern regions of New Mexico, including cities like Las Cruces, Roswell, and Carlsbad. Apart from the utilitarian purpose, these two area codes, 505 and 575, over time have become cultural identity markers, symbolizing a sense of community and belonging among the locals. The locals often associate area code 505 as synonymous with Albuquerque, exhibiting a sense of pride. It can be seen reflected in local business names, community initiatives, and even popular culture, showcasing the robust local flavor of Albuquerque. In terms of economy, the area coded 505 (Albuquerque inclusive) is home to vibrant sectors such as the technology, healthcare, and entertainment industries. It houses numerous high-tech research facilities and is the economic hub of New Mexico, supplemented by the art scene, which is thriving due to the city's cultural diversity. On the other hand, the 575 area experiences an economy largely based on agriculture, oil and gas, tourism, with a growing prominence in aerospace and defense sectors—especially with the presence of renowned institutes such as New Mexico State University, White Sands Missile Range, and the Very Large Array radio astronomy observatory.   Therefore, area codes 505 and 575, though seemingly just phone code extensions, are substantially more than that. They embody the diverse communities, vibrant economies, cultural identities, and the geographical uniqueness of Albuquerque and New Mexico while serving as a lifeline connecting the populace across distances."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant that follows instruction extremely well.

After 2 straight losses on the road, the Colts returned home to take on the Falcons.  The Falcons dominated scoring 21 unanswered points as Michael Turner would run for a 1-yard touchdown for a 7-0 lead.  It was then followed up by Matt Ryan finding Julio Jones on a 50-yard touchdown pass taking the game to 14-0 in the first quarter.  In the 2nd quarter, Ryan and Jones hooked up again on an 80-yard pass sending the game to 21-0.

Matt Ryan of the Falcons found Julio Jones on a 50-yard touchdown pass and then later connected once more for an 80-yard pass. Meanwhile, in the 3rd quarter, Ryan threw a 1-yard touchdown pass to Tony Gonzalez.  The difference in length between the longest and the shortest touchdown pass is calculated by subtracting the shortest length from the longest length. In this case, that would be 80 yards (the longest pass) minus 1 yard (the shortest pass).

His father, Nicomachus, died when Aristotle was a child, whereafter Proxenus of Atarneus became his guardian. At seventeen or eighteen years of age, he joined Plato's Academy in Athens and remained there until the age of thirty-seven (c. 347 BC). His writings cover many subjects  including physics, biology, zoology, metaphysics, logic, ethics, aesthetics, poetry, theater, music, rhetoric, linguistics, politics and government  and constitute the first comprehensive system of Western philosophy. Shortly after Plato died, Aristotle left Athens and, at the request of Philip of Macedon, tutored Alexander the Great beginning in 343 BC.  - Jupiter is the fifth planet from the Sun and the largest in the Solar System. It is a giant planet with a mass one-thousandth that of the Sun, but two and a half times that of all the other planets in the Solar System combined. Jupiter is a gas giant, along with Saturn, with the other two giant planets, Uranus and Neptune, being ice giants. Jupiter was known to astronomers of ancient times. The Romans named it after their god Jupiter. When viewed from Earth, Jupiter can reach an apparent magnitude of 2.94, bright enough for its reflected light to cast shadows, and making it on average the third-brightest object in the night sky after the Moon and Venus.  - Prometheus the Fire-Bringer (Ancient Greek:  , \\"Promtheús Pyrphóros\\") was probably the final play in the \\"Prometheia\\" trilogy traditionally ascribed to the 5th century BC Greek tragedian Aeschylus.  - Ancient Greek religion encompasses the collection of beliefs, rituals, and mythology originating in ancient Greece in the form of both popular public religion and cult practices. These groups varied enough for it to be possible to speak of Greek religions or \\"cults\\" in the plural, though most of them shared similarities.  - Greek mythology is the body of myths and teachings that belong to the ancient Greeks, concerning their gods and heroes, the nature of the world, and the origins and significance of their own cult and ritual practices. It was a part of the religion in ancient Greece. Modern scholars refer to and study the myths in an attempt to shed light on the religious and political institutions of Ancient Greece and its civilization, and to gain understanding of the nature of myth-making itself.  - In the Vedas, Indra is the king of Svarga and the Devas . He is the god of lightning, thunder, storms, rains and river flows. Indra is the most referred to deity in the \\"Rigveda\\". He is celebrated for his powers, and the one who kills the great symbolic evil named Vritra who obstructs human prosperity and happiness. Indra destroys Vritra and his \\"deceiving forces\\", and thereby brings rains and the sunshine as the friend of mankind. His importance diminishes in the post-Vedic Indian literature where he is depicted as a powerful hero but one who is getting in trouble with his drunken, hedonistic and adulterous ways, and the god who disturbs Hindu monks as they meditate because he fears self-realized human beings may become more powerful than him.  - In linguistics, cognates are words that have a common etymological origin. In etymology, the \\"cognate\\" category excludes doublets and loanwords. The word \\"cognate\\" derives from the Latin noun \\"cognatus\\", which means \\"blood relative\\".  - Zeus (\\"Zeús\\", ; Modern , \\"Días\\" ) was the sky and thunder god in ancient Greek religion, who ruled as king of the gods of Mount Olympus. His name is cognate with the first element of his Roman equivalent Jupiter. His mythologies and powers are similar, though not identical to those of the Indo-European deities such as Indra, Jupiter, Perun, Thor, and Odin.  - Ancient Greek includes the forms of Greek used in ancient Greece and the ancient world from around the 9th century BC to the 6th century AD. It is often roughly divided into the Archaic period (9th to 6th centuries BC), Classical period (5th and 4th centuries BC), and Hellenistic period (3rd century BC to the 6th century AD). It is antedated in the second millennium BC by Mycenaean Greek.  - Prometheus Unbound ( Ancient Greek :   , Promtheus Lyomenos ) is a fragmentary play by the Greek poet Aeschylus , concerned with the torments of the Greek mythological figure Prometheus who defies the gods and gives fire to humanity ( theft of fire ) , for which he is subjected to eternal punishment and suffering at the hands of Zeus . It inspired the play of the same title by Percy Bysshe Shelley . It is thought to have followed Prometheus Bound in the Prometheia trilogy attributed to the 5th - century BC Greek tragedian Aeschylus . The text of the Unbound survives only in eleven fragments preserved by later authors . Nevertheless , these fragments , combined with prophetic statements made in the first play of the trilogy , allow the reconstruction of a broad outline . A lengthy fragment translated into Latin by the Roman statesman Cicero indicates that the play would have opened with Prometheus visited by a chorus of Titans . Though Zeus had imprisoned them in Tartarus at the conclusion of the Titanomachy , he has at long last granted them clemency . This perhaps foreshadows Zeus 's eventual reconciliation with Prometheus in the trilogy 's third installment . Prometheus complains about his torment just as he had to the chorus of Oceanids in Prometheus Bound . As the dramatis personae of Prometheus Bound erroneously lists Gaea , it has been suggested that she is next to visit Prometheus in this play , in a sympathetic role that echoes Oceanus ' turn in the first play . Finally , the faulty dramatis personae mentioned above and several fragments indicate that Heracles visits the Titan just as Io had in Prometheus Bound . Heracles frees Prometheus from his chains and kills the eagle that had been torturing Prometheus by eating his regenerating liver every day . Again mirroring events in the previous play , Prometheus forecasts Heracles ' travels as he concludes his Twelve Labours . The play thus concludes with Prometheus free from the torments of Zeus , but the Titan and Olympian have yet to reconcile . This...  - Thunder is the sound caused by lightning. Depending on the distance and nature of the lightning, thunder can range from a sharp, loud crack to a long, low rumble (brontide). The sudden increase in pressure and temperature from lightning produces rapid expansion of the air surrounding and within a bolt of lightning. In turn, this expansion of air creates a sonic shock wave, similar to a sonic boom, which produces the sound of thunder, often referred to as a \\"clap\\", \\"crack\\", \\"peal of thunder\\", or \\"boom\\".  - Aeschylus (or ; \\"Aiskhulos\\" c. 525/524  c. 456/455 BC) was an ancient Greek tragedian. He is often described as the father of tragedy. Academics' knowledge of the genre begins with his work, and understanding of earlier tragedies is largely based on inferences from his surviving plays. According to Aristotle, he expanded the number of characters in theater allowing conflict among them; characters previously had interacted only with the chorus.  - Prometheus ( meaning \\"forethought\\") is a Titan in Greek mythology, best known as the deity in Greek mythology who was the creator of mankind and its greatest benefactor, who stole fire from Mount Olympus and gave it to mankind.  - The Oresteia is a trilogy of Greek tragedies written by Aeschylus concerning the murder of Agamemnon by Clytaemnestra, the murder of Clytaemnestra by Orestes, the trial of Orestes, the end of the curse on the House of Atreus and pacification of the Erinyes. This trilogy also shows how the Greek gods interacted with the characters and influenced their decisions pertaining to events and disputes. The only extant example of an ancient Greek theater trilogy, the \\"Oresteia\\" won first prize at the Dionysia festival in 458 BC. Many consider the \\"Oresteia\\" to be Aeschylus' finest work. The principal themes of the trilogy include the contrast between revenge and justice, as well as the transition from personal vendetta to organized litigation. \\"Orestia\\" originally included a satyr play \\"Proteus\\" following the tragic trilogy, but all except a single line of \\"Proteus\\" has been lost.  - The Prometheia is a trilogy of plays about the titan Prometheus. It was attributed in Antiquity to the 5th-century BC Greek tragedian Aeschylus. Though an Alexandrian catalogue of Aeschylean play titles designates the trilogy \\"Hoi Prometheis\\" (\\"the Prometheuses\\"), in modern scholarship the trilogy has been designated the \\"Prometheia\\" to mirror the title of Aeschylus' only extant trilogy, the \\"Oresteia\\". Unlike the \\"Oresteia\\", only one play from this trilogy\\"Prometheus Bound\\"survives. Inasmuch as the authorship of \\"Prometheus Bound\\" continues to be debated, the very existence of a Prometheus trilogy is uncertain. To the extent that modern scholars postulate the existence of such a trilogy by a single author, the consensus holds that it comprised \\"Prometheus Bound\\", \\"Prometheus Unbound\\", and \\"Prometheus the Fire-Bringer\\", in that order.  - In Norse mythology, Thor (from Old Norse Þórr) is a hammer-wielding god associated with thunder, lightning, storms, oak trees, strength, the protection of mankind, and also hallowing and fertility. The cognate deity in wider Germanic mythology and paganism was known in Old English as Þunor and in Old High German as Donar (runic þonar ), stemming from a Common Germanic *Þunraz (meaning \\"thunder\\").  - In Germanic mythology, Odin (from Old Norse Óðinn) is a widely revered god. In Norse mythology, from which stems most of the information about the god, Odin is associated with healing, death, royalty, the gallows, knowledge, battle, sorcery, poetry, frenzy, and the runic alphabet, and is the husband of the goddess Frigg. In wider Germanic mythology and paganism, Odin was known in Old English as Wden, in Old Saxon as Wdan, and in Old High German as Wuotan or Wtan, all stemming from the reconstructed Proto-Germanic theonym wanaz.  - Prometheus Bound (\\"Promtheus Desmts\\") is an Ancient Greek tragedy. In antiquity, it was attributed to Aeschylus, but now is considered by some scholars to be the work of another hand, and perhaps one as late as c. 430 BC. Despite these doubts of authorship, the play's designation as Aeschylean has remained conventional. The tragedy is based on the myth of Prometheus, a Titan who defies the gods and gives fire to mankind, acts for which he is subjected to perpetual punishment.  - In polytheistic systems there is a tendency for one divinity, usually male, to achieve pre-eminence as King of the Gods. This tendency is paralleled with the growth of hierarchical systems of political power, in which a monarch eventually comes to assume ultimate authority for human affairs. Other gods come to serve in a Divine Council or pantheon, usually linked by family ties from union of a single husband or wife, or else from an androgynous divinity who is responsible for the creation.

Article:","output":"Title: The Legacy of DC-9s: A Milestone in Aviation History Introduction: Born in 1965, the DC-9 aircraft revolutionized commercial aviation by opening jet routes to small airports and spurring travel across the nation. Delta, the last remaining U.S. carrier flying DC-9s, officially retired its fleet on January 6th. Throughout the years, these iconic airplanes have been used by various high-profile personalities, such as Hugh Hefner and 2012 Vice Presidential nominee Paul Ryan, who both owned a DC-9. Even though Delta's final five Series 50 DC-9s will be sold off, one will be preserved in a museum to showcase its significance in aviation history. Step 1: Discuss the birth and early years of DC-9s The DC-9 was introduced in 1965 as a response to the aviation industry's need for a twin-engine, short-to-medium-range jet for smaller airports. The aircraft quickly gained popularity due to its efficiency, reliability, and ability to service previously untapped markets. Step 2: Highlight DC-9s impact on commercial aviation During the 1960s and 1970s, DC-9s opened new possibilities for air travel, allowing airlines to expand their schedules and passengers to experience the convenience of flying more frequently and to previously inaccessible locations. By servicing smaller airports, the DC-9 helped drive economic growth and increased connectivity between cities across the country. Step 3: Discuss notable usage by high-profile personalities DC-9s have had their fair share of celebrity passengers, most notably Hugh Hefner, who owned a DC-9 for several years, and Paul Ryan, who campaigned in one during the 2012 Vice Presidential race. These instances underscore the aircraft's reliability and comfort for even the most discerning clientele. Step 4: Touch on the retirement and legacy of DC-9s As the last remaining U.S. carrier flying DC-9s, Delta officially retired its fleet on January 6th. Although these aircraft may no longer grace the skies, their impact on commercial aviation is undeniable. One of the final five Series 50 DC-9s will be preserved in a museum, serving as a testament to the crucial role they played in advancing air travel. Conclusion: The DC-9s may have retired, but their legacy lives on. By opening jet routes to small airports and spurring travel across the nation, these iconic aircraft forever changed the landscape of commercial aviation. As we bid farewell to these beloved workhorses, the industry and travelers alike are grateful for the enduring impact they have had on the history of air travel."},{"instruction":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

Answer the following question: Read the following context and choose the correct option to answer the question. Context: Surely the best thing about colomba, the Easter equivalent to panettone, is the sugared, toasted almond topping that covers the whole thing and crumbles when you cut it, so you sort of have no choice but just to pick up the crusty sugary bits and eat those on their own. I’d always thought that colomba would make a very good baking project but was somewhat intimated by getting the right shape  — it’s vaguely in the shape of a dove, if you use your imagination — and texture — wonderfully soft, fluffy, sweet yeasted bread. I had attempted making panettone (this fig, walnut and date panettone) a few years ago with fair results — absolutely delicious results, actually, they were just not as fluffy and bouncy as expertly made ones from your favourite pastry shop where panettoni are hung upside-down to maintain their height and airiness. But when I came across the familiar brown and gold paper forms for making colomba at the supermarket, I thought I’m only ever going to get a chance to make this now! Like the panettone, I referred to my favourite baking book for Italian specialties, Carol Field’s The Italian Baker. Field recounts a bit of history behind the colomba, which I’m sure is little known to anyone these days. Colomba is a fixture at Easter tables all around Italy (and is often given as presents), even though it comes from the north of Italy, Pavia. It is one of those traditions that are now a given, where a slice of colomba, perhaps eaten with pieces of a cracked chocolate Easter egg and an espresso or a glass of dessert wine, is a welcome end to the meal (or indeed breakfast the next day). But the legend behind it is a medieval one and rather disturbing — maybe it was made up to encourage young girls to learn how to bake their own colomba (and make sure it was good) to get themselves out of sticky, undesirable situations.

You are so clever.\\"  The king and queen were sitting in the royal library, of which the shelves were full of the most delightful fairy books in all languages, all equally familiar to King Prigio. The queen could not read most of them herself, but the king used to read them aloud to her. A good many years had passed--seventeen, in fact--since Queen Rosalind was married, but you would not think it to look at her. Her grey eyes were as kind and soft and beautiful, her dark hair as dark, and her pretty colour as like a white rose blushing, as on the day when she was a bride. And she was as fond of the king as when he was only Prince Prigio, and he was as fond of her as on the night when he first met her at the ball.  \\"No, I don't know what to do with Dick,\\" said the king.  He meant his son, Prince Ricardo, but he called him Dick in private.  \\"I believe it's the fault of his education,\\" his Majesty went on. \\"We have not brought him up rightly.

Sean Spicer, arguably the world’s most famous White House press secretary, is developing a talk show with the tentative title of “Sean Spicer’s Common Ground,” in which the former spokesman for President Trump interviews notable people in an informal setting.      A pitch sheet for the show’s pilot, obtained by The New York Times, describes Mr. Spicer hosting “some of the most interesting and thoughtful public figures for a drink and some lite conversation at a local pub or cafe.”      “The relaxed atmosphere is an ideal setting for Sean to get to know his guests as they discuss everything from the media to marriage,” the pitch continues. “They might even tangle over the merits of making your bed or the value of a great point guard.”      No network is attached to the project, but the pilot episode, to be filmed in July, is backed by heavy hitters in the realm of unscripted television. Debmar-Mercury, the syndicator of daytime series including “The Wendy Williams Show” and “Family Feud,” is co-producing with Pilgrim Media Group, which has developed basic-cable staples like “American Chopper.” ||||| Sean Spicer may be entering the TV business.      President Donald Trump's former spokesman is teaming with Lionsgate-owned Debmar-Mercury (The Wendy Williams Show) and Pilgrim Media Group (American Chopper) to develop a talk show called Sean Spicer's Common Ground, sources confirmed to The Hollywood Reporter.      The potential series — a network is not yet attached — would see Spicer interviewing notable people in an informal setting, according to The New York Times, which first reported the news. The Times, which acquired a pitch sheet for a potential pilot for the series, reported that the show would feature Spicer hosting public figures for a drink and light conversation at a local pub or cafe. The pilot is poised to be filmed in July and would feature one guest per week.      Attorney Michael Avenatti, who has repped Stormy Daniels, has been approached as a guest for Spicer's pilot. (He declined.)      \\"In this current environment, I think it’s important to have a platform where we can have civil, respectful and informative discussions on the issues of the day,” Spicer told the Times.      The talk show is one of multiple projects Spicer is pursuing since leaving the White House last July. Repped by WME, Spicer has also launched a podcast, Everything's Going to Be All Right, with conservative writer Katie Pavlich, and joined America First Action, a super PAC created to support Trump and his allies. He also penned a book covering his six months in the White House that is due out July 24.

If \\"3 men in a band playing electric guitar.\\", does it logically follow that \\"Three guys and their guitars jamming out.\\"?","output":"Yes, the statement \\"Three men in a band playing electric guitar\\" logically implies that these three individuals, possibly all playing electric guitars, are part of a musical ensemble. The second statement, \\"Three guys and their guitars jamming out,\\" can be understood as a description or rephrasing of the same general situation. Both statements convey the idea that three male members of a band are performing or rehearsing their respective guitar parts together. There are several aspects to consider when comparing and analyzing these two statements: 1. The number of participants: Both assertions mention \\"3 men\\" or \\"three guys,\\" establishing that there are three individuals involved in performing or rehearsing. 2. The instruments being played: Both statements specify that electric guitars are the instruments being played. While the first statement explicitly mentions \\"playing electric guitar,\\" the second statement implies this idea through the phrase \\"their guitars.\\" It would be reasonable to assume that these guitars are electric since the first statement highlights this aspect. 3. The situation: The first statement describes the situation as \\"3 men in a band,\\" which suggests that these individuals are not just friends or random musicians playing together; they are part of an organized musical group. The second statement uses the term \\"jamming out,\\" which connotes an informal and spontaneous setting, such as a practice, improvisation, or a casual performance. While the term \\"jamming out\\" does not explicitly state the formal organization of the musicians, it is consistent with the concept of a band since bands often \\"jam out\\" during their practice sessions or while improvising new material. 4. The gender of the individuals: Both statements exclusively mention men or guys. Although gender should not be an essential factor in determining musical abilities or performance, the two statements align in emphasizing male musicians in this particular scenario.  Considering all these aspects, we can conclude that the statement \\"Three men in a band playing electric guitar\\" logically follows and aligns with the statement \\"Three guys and their guitars jamming out.\\" The second statement can be viewed as a more informal or colloquial description of the musical scene implied by the first statement."},{"instruction":"Read the following context and choose the correct option to answer the question. Context: I love going to the spa. Honestly, who doesn't. These days, unfortunately, my spa trips are few and far between. I blame the damn kids for that one! So, as you can imagine, I was pretty damn excited when the in-laws presented me with an Urban Spa voucher for the Urban Indulgence package: one hour hot stone Lomi Lomi massage followed by a Heavenly Spa Facial - two hours on indulgent bliss, for Christmas. I had never had a hot stone massage before so was very much looking forward to this, if nothing else out of curiosity about what is involved. Whenever you see pictures advertising a hot stone massage, the beautiful model always has a bunch of largish stones on her back so I wasn't sure whether it was more an acupressure experience where they left the stones strategically placed on the back to work their magic or whether it was an actual massage.  Turns out that it is an actual massage. I requested a firm massage as my back has really been giving me issues. Carrying 15kgs of Crazy Kid or 9kgs of Kiki (or 26kgs of double babies) really isn't too good for the back so it had been causing me problems for a couple of months. My therapist (the lovely Kristy) gave me an expertly firm massage and used a small, smooth hot stone, along with her hands, to perform the massage. It was quite a unique experience as one minute I could sense that she was using her hands to do the massage then then next I'd get a sweep of hotness as the stone was run over me. It really was a delightful sensory experience. As my back was a problem area, Kristy spent 30 minutes just on that then the other 30 minutes was spent on the rest of my body. I could feel myself drifting in and out of consciousness throughout the massage. One really special thing about this massage was that the massage table was heated.

The 300-millimeter silicon wafers -- about the size of a standard pizza -- are shuttled around the facility in enclosed plastic pods, which ride on overhead tracks. They drop down from wires automatically into machines, sheathed in stainless steel and glass, for each stage of processing and fabrication. Throughout the 500 processing steps, which typically last 20 days, the wafers are not touched by human hands. The circuits etched into the chips are less than one thousandth the width of a human hair. Human operators are there to monitor the systems, catch errors and fine-tune the production process for maximum efficiency.

Answer based on context: In March 1768, Ming Rui began his retreat, pursued by a Burmese army of 10,000 men and 2000 cavalry. The Burmese then tried to encircle the Chinese by splitting the army into two. Maha Thiha Thura had now assumed the overall command, replacing Maha Sithu. The smaller army, led by Maha Sithu, continued to pursue Ming Rui while the larger army led by Maha Thiha Thura advanced through the mountainous route to emerge directly behind the Chinese. Through careful maneuvering, the Burmese managed to achieve complete encirclement of the Chinese at modern-day Pyinoolwin , about 50 miles northeast of Ava. Over the course of three days of bloody fighting, the Bannerman army was completely annihilated. The slaughter was such that the Burmese could hardly grip their swords as the hilts were slippery with enemy blood. Of the original 30,000 men of the main army, only 2500 remained alive and were captured. The rest had been killed either on the battlefield, through disease or through execution after their surrender. Ming Rui himself was severely wounded in battle. Only a small group managed to break through and escaped the carnage. Ming Rui himself could have escaped with that group. Instead, he cut off his queue and sent it to the emperor as a token of his loyalty by those who were escaping. He then hanged himself on a tree. In the end, only a few dozen of the main army returned. How did the Bannerman army soldiers die?","output":"The Bannerman army soldiers died through a combination of factors during the course of the battle and their subsequent defeat. These factors include: 1. The battlefield: Many soldiers were killed during the three days of intense and bloody fighting against the Burmese army. 2. Encirclement: The Burmese army used strategic maneuvering to achieve complete encirclement of the Chinese forces, further increasing casualties and limiting escape options. 3. Disease: The harsh conditions and possible lack of proper medical care might have led to the spread of diseases among the Bannerman army soldiers, contributing to their deaths. 4. Execution: After their surrender, some of the Bannerman army soldiers were executed by the Burmese forces. In summary, the Bannerman army soldiers died due to the consequences of the battle, strategic encirclement by the Burmese army, disease, and execution following their surrender."},{"instruction":"Given the following context:  The painting shows the moment from Summer in which Musidora, having removed the last of her clothes, steps into \\"the lucid coolness of the flood\\" to \\"bathe her fervent limbs in the refreshing stream\\". Damon is not shown; instead, Etty illustrates the scene from Damon's viewpoint. By placing the audience in Damon's position, Etty aimed to induce the same reactions in the viewer as Damon's dilemma as described by Thomson; that of whether to enjoy the spectacle despite knowing it to be inappropriate, or to follow the accepted morality of the time and look away, in what art historian Sarah Burnage has described as \\"a titillating moral test for spectators to both enjoy and overcome\\".The pose of Musidora is based on that of the Aphrodite of Cnidus and the Venus de' Medici. It is possible that Etty was also familiar with Thomas Gainsborough's Musidora, which shares similar elements. Gainsborough's Musidora, his only large nude, was never exhibited in his lifetime and remained in private hands until 1847, but Etty was familiar with its then-owner Robert Vernon and may have seen it in his collection. The setting for the painting is a pool in the grounds of The Plantation, a house in the village of Acomb, near York. The Plantation was the home of his close friend and patron the Reverend Isaac Spencer, vicar of Acomb, and its grounds were a scene Etty had previously painted. In 1846 Etty bought a house in York for his retirement; Burnage speculates that Etty chose Acomb on the grounds that a view of York was quintessentially English.Although Etty had traditionally worked in the Venetian style of painting, with rich colours and detail, for Musidora he adopted a much softer and earthier palette, although his use of reflected light on flesh is derived from Venetian styles.

His parents divorced when he was six months old, and Smith moved with his mother to Duncanville, Texas. Smith later had a tattoo of a map of Texas drawn on his upper arm and said: \\"I didn't get it because I like Texas, kind of the opposite. But I won't forget about it, although I'm tempted to because I don't like it there.\\" Context: Smith graduated from Hampshire College in Amherst, Massachusetts in 1991 with a degree in philosophy and political science. \\"Went straight through in four years\\", he explained to Under the Radar in 2003. \\"I guess it proved to myself that I could do something I really didn't want to for four years.

They were then signed to Virgin Records to release what became their final album, Mic City Sons (1996).  Around this time, Smith and Gust worked a number of odd jobs around Portland, including installing drywall, spreading gravel, transplanting bamboo trees, and painting the roof of a warehouse with heat reflective paint. The pair were also on unemployment benefits for some time, which they considered an \\"artist grant\\".

It has many important functions. The main function of the skin is controlling what enters and leaves the body. It prevents the loss of too much water from the body. It also prevents bacteria and other microorganisms from entering the body. The skin helps maintain a constant body temperature. It keeps the body cool in two ways. Sweat from sweat glands in the skin evaporates to cool the body. Blood vessels in the skin dilate, or widen. This action increases blood flow to the body surface. This allows more heat to reach the surface. The heat is then able to radiate off the body. The opposite happens to retain body heat. Blood vessels in the skin constrict, or narrow. This decreases blood flow to the body surface. This reduces the amount of heat that reaches the surface. When this happens, less heat can be lost to the air.

Question: What is the answer for the question: What is the first name of the man who scandalised some of his more austere colleagues by introducing his students to contemporary music. from the following article ?  In 1861 Saint-Saëns accepted his only post as a teacher, at the École de Musique Classique et Religieuse, Paris, which Louis Niedermeyer had established in 1853 to train first-rate organists and choirmasters for the churches of France. Niedermeyer himself was professor of piano; when he died in March 1861, Saint-Saëns was appointed to take charge of piano studies. He scandalised some of his more austere colleagues by introducing his students to contemporary music, including that of Schumann, Liszt and Wagner. His best-known pupil, Gabriel Fauré, recalled in old age: After allowing the lessons to run over, he would go to the piano and reveal to us those works of the masters from which the rigorous classical nature of our programme of study kept us at a distance and who, moreover, in those far-off years, were scarcely known. ... At the time I was 15 or 16, and from this time dates the almost filial attachment ... the immense admiration, the unceasing gratitude I [have] had for him, throughout my life. Saint-Saëns further enlivened the academic regime by writing, and composing incidental music for, a one-act farce performed by the students (including André Messager). He conceived his best-known piece, The Carnival of the Animals, with his students in mind, but did not finish composing it until 1886, more than twenty years after he left the Niedermeyer school.In 1864 Saint-Saëns caused some surprise by competing a second time for the Prix de Rome. Many in musical circles were puzzled by his decision to enter the competition again, now that he was establishing a reputation as a soloist and composer. He was once more unsuccessful. Berlioz, one of the judges, wrote: We gave the Prix de Rome the other day to a young man who wasn't expecting to win it and who went almost mad with joy. We were all expecting the prize to go to Camille Saint-Saëns, who had the strange notion of competing. I confess I was sorry to vote against a man who is truly a great artist and one who is already well known, practically a celebrity.... Answer:","output":"The first name of the man who scandalized some of his more austere colleagues by introducing his students to contemporary music is Camille.

A friend asked me to answer this question: What is the name of the person who told Bernhard Cossmann to \\"listen to the instrumentation\\" and claimed it was his own?, using the article: While Raff was able to offer \\"practical suggestions [in orchestration] which were of great value to Liszt\\", there may have been \\"a basic misunderstanding\\" of the nature of their collaboration. Liszt wanted to learn more about instrumentation and acknowledged Raff's greater expertise in this area. Hence, he gave Raff piano sketches to orchestrate, just as he had done earlier with Conradi—\\"so that he might rehearse them, reflect on them, and then, as his confidence in the orchestra grew, change them.\\" Raff disagreed, having the impression that Liszt wanted him on equal terms as a full collaborator. While attending an 1850 rehearsal of Prometheus, he told Bernhard Cossmann, who sat next to him, \\"Listen to the instrumentation. It is by me.\\"Raff continued making such claims about his role in Liszt's compositional process. Some of these accounts, published posthumously by Die Musik in 1902 and 1903, suggest that he was an equal collaborator with Liszt. Raff's assertions were supported by Joachim, who had been active in Weimar at approximately the same time as Raff. Walker writes that Joachim later recalled to Raff's widow \\"that he had seen Raff 'produce full orchestral scores from piano sketches.'\\" Joachim also told Raff's biographer Andreas Moser that \\"the E-flat-major Piano Concerto was orchestrated from beginning to end by Raff.\\" Raff's and Joachim's statements effectively questioned the authorship of Liszt's orchestral music, especially the symphonic poems. This speculation was debased when composer and Liszt scholar Peter Raabe carefully compared all sketches then known of Liszt's orchestral works with the published versions of the same works. Raabe demonstrated that, regardless of the position with first drafts, or of how much assistance Liszt may have received from Raff or Conradi at that point, every note of the final versions represents Liszt's intentions., what would be the answer ?

Article: Retirement experts nationwide are buzzing about one element of President Obama's State of the Union speech Tuesday night. That's his proposal for the \\"myRA,\\" a retirement account aimed chiefly at lower-income workers whose employers don't offer traditional defined-contribution plans such as 401k's.      In many respects the myRA is a welcome idea. But if Obama's goal is to distract policy-makers from more substantial proposals to shore up the American retirement crisis--by expanding Social Security, for example--then it won't cut the mustard.      The plan, as the President outlined it in his address and the White House fleshed out a bit more Wednesday, aims to give lower-income workers a way to start building retirement nest eggs in tax-deferred accounts, through regular payroll deductions made by their employers. The employers would have to agree to offer the service to employees.      The accounts would be available to those earning less than 191,000, but the minimum initial contribution would be 25 and subsequent contributions could be as little as 5.      The money would be invested in a government-backed bond with a yield pegged to the Government Securities Investment Fund offered to federal employees through the government's Thrift Savings Plan, a retirement program. That low-risk, low-return fund yielded 1.47% over the last year and an average 2.24% over the last three years. Like Series EE savings bonds, the myRA bonds wouldn't lose face value, which means the investments would be protected from market losses. But with such low yields they might barely keep up with inflation.      Once the accounts reach 15,000 in value, they would have to be rolled over into a conventional Individual Investment Account. That's a sop to the financial services industry, which makes billions from managing IRAS. And that's bad news, says economist Monique Morrissey of the Economic Policy Institute. \\"The president’s plan may serve to channel more savings into a high-risk, high-fee system without first addressing its failings,\\" she wrote on EPI's blog.      If the myRA's resemble Roth IRAs, then money invested in them wouldn't be tax deductible, but in most cases distributions would be tax-exempt. The White House says myRA funds could be withdrawn at any time. That may make them more palatable for low-income workers because their contributions wouldn't be tied up until retirement. But it might also encourage people to withdraw money for emergencies or household needs such as college tuition, medical bills or home purchases, which defeats the purpose of having a dedicated retirement account.      The proposal complements one that Obama has pushed before, most recently in his 2013 budget, for an \\"auto-IRA\\"--a mandate that small businesses without any other retirement benefits offer workers a simple individual retirement account and sign them up automatically unless they opt out. That program would require congressional approval, which hasn't been forthcoming.      The problem with these proposals is that they're only token solutions to the retirement income gap.      \\"Instead of putting forward the MyRA proposal and making some noises about auto-IRAs,\\" says Eric Kingson, a founding co-director of the advocacy organization Social Security Works, \\"I wish the president simply focused on the facts about the impending retirement income crisis, or acknowledged, along with his MyRA and auto-IRA rhetoric, that these proposals can, at best, only make a small dent in the larger problem.\\"      The myRA resembles, at least in its goals, a program devised by California State Sen. Kevin De Leon (D-Los Angeles) for \\"California Secure Choice.\\" That's a state-sponsored retirement account for low-income workers funded from their paychecks and guaranteed a modest annual yield. The program has been endorsed in principle by the state legislature and Gov. Jerry Brown, and De Leon is in the process of developing a feasibility study to determine its features.      A retirement crisis is looming for millions of Americans. Most households haven't saved enough to keep them secure through their retirement years; they'll be relying heavily on Social Security. That's why support is growing in Congress--albeit from a small kernel--to raise Social Security benefits, an idea being pushed vigorously by Democratic Sens. Elizabeth Warren of Massachusetts and Tom Harkin of Iowa. Harkin also is expected to release a new proposal for a government-sponsored retirement fund as early as Thursday.      President Obama's plan is a good start at facing up to the financial crisis facing millions of American retirees and near-retirees. But leaving things at \\"a good start\\" isn't going to be much help to very many people. ||||| President Barack Obama wants to give low-wage workers a new way to save for retirement. His proposal might do some good -- not by helping workers, most of whom are unlikely to take advantage of it, but by spurring a discussion about how to fix a broken retirement system.      It’s beyond dispute that the system is failing. Only 1 in 2 workers has access to a retirement plan through an employer. Half of Americans aren’t saving anything at all for retirement. And Social Security benefits, which averaged 1,269 a month in 2013, are barely enough to keep people out of poverty.      Obama says he’ll offer workers the chance to direct part of their pay toward new retirement accounts sponsored by the Treasury Department. They’ll have low minimum contributions, returns tied to the yield on government debt, guaranteed principal and no fees. “My Retirement Accounts,” or MyRAs, won’t require congressional approval -- which is good and bad. It’s good because it means something will happen; it’s bad because without legislation, the government can’t make employers offer the plans or tell workers they’re covered unless they choose not to be.      Without compulsion or inducements, participation in MyRAs is likely to be small. Fewer than 1 in 10 workers who are eligible to contribute to existing Individual Retirement Accounts bother to do so. Last night, Obama also asked Congress for legislation to create IRAs with automatic deductions and require most employers to offer them. Payroll deductions would still be voluntary as far as workers are concerned, but workers who don’t want to save this way would have to opt out. That would raise the participation rate a lot. But Congress has to go along.      The MyRA proposal and the auto-enroll IRA are both good ideas, but neither really measures up to the scale of the problem. Employer contributions to retirement savings, whether in the form of defined-benefit pensions or employer-matched 401(k) plans, have fallen. Without those contributions, especially in programs that encourage or require workers to make contributions of their own, most Americans are saving too little to retire in comfort.      Solving this problem is a formidable long-term challenge. It will require wholesale reform of taxes on savings, such that the generous reliefs granted to high-income taxpayers are consolidated, simplified and shifted to those with low incomes, as Obama rightly noted.      It will probably require gradual reform of Social Security as well, so that more generous benefits are given to those who need them, with the cost recouped from the better-off through lower benefits and higher contributions. That’s a can of worms that Obama had no intention of opening last night -- but don’t expect the subject to go away.      A retirement-savings crisis is coming. MyRAs will help a bit, but the problem will eventually demand much bolder thinking.

Supporting this point of view, experts highlight that only half of Americans are saving for retirement and Social Security benefits are barely sufficient to keep people out of poverty. There is a call for more comprehensive reform, such as changes in taxes on savings and adjustments to Social Security to provide more generous benefits to those who need them most, financed by lower benefits and higher contributions from the better-off.

While taking a sight-seeing tour on a small boat, he gazes into the ocean and sees something below the surface that fascinates him, while his older brother Freddie Bauer is walking around the boat fascinated by the women. Allen jumps into the water, even though he cannot swim. He grasps the hands of a girl who is inexplicably under the water with him and an instant connection forms between the two. Allen can now breathe under water as he is in the hands of a mermaid. However, Allen is pulled to the surface by the deck hands and the two are separated, though apparently no one else sees the girl. After the ferry moves off, Allen looks back at the girl, who dives underwater showing her mermaid's tail. Allen comes to believe the encounter was a near-death hallucination, but his bond with the mermaid proves so strong that his subsequent relationships with women fail as he seeks the connection he felt with the mermaid. Years later, Allen (Tom Hanks) is a co-owner of a wholesale fruit and vegetable business in New York City with his womanizing older brother Freddie (John Candy). Depressed after his latest breakup, Allen returns to Cape Cod, where he encounters eccentric scientist Dr. Walter Kornbluth (Eugene Levy). After Allen is left alone when his motorboat conks out, he again falls into the sea, and is knocked out when the boat hits his head. He wakes up with a headache on a beach, where he encounters a beautiful naked woman with long blonde hair, a necklace with a lion medal, and the inability to talk (Daryl Hannah) who, unknown to him, is the mermaid he met as a boy (her tail transforms into legs when it becomes dry). After kissing him, she dives into the sea and leaves Allen to return home.

Like all animals in the Chinese zodiac, the horse sign comes imbued with characteristics, such as vitality, loyalty and adventure. The year of the horse is generally considered an auspicious time. Health professionals say many patients have inquired about early delivery via Caesarean section to ensure a horse-year birth. It has also been noted that fertility consultations have spiked in recent months. The Year of the Sheep begins on February 19, 2015, so the window for conception closes around the end of this month. Some people in China believe sheep are meek and babies born in that year will grow up to be followers rather than leaders. Many couples are desperate to conceive in 2014 - the Year of the Horse - and thousands around the world celebrated the Chinese New Year earlier this year, above. Here is a summary of the highlights for this article:","output":"In China, some people believe that the year in which a baby is born can affect their future. They use the Chinese zodiac, which has twelve different animal signs, to help them decide when to have a baby. In 2014, it was the Year of the Horse, and many Chinese couples wanted to have a baby during this time because they believe that Horse babies will grow up to be strong leaders. On the other hand, 2015 was the Year of the Sheep, and some people think that babies born during this year will grow up to be followers, not leaders. They even believe that the Sheep children might have problems in their relationships when they grow up. Because of this, many couples in China tried very hard to have a baby in the Year of the Horse, so their child could have a better future. Some even asked doctors to deliver their babies early, by doing an operation called a Caesarean section. This made clinics busier than usual, as many people wanted help to make sure they could have a baby in the right year."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

And if the language spoken there is one other than your native one, for goodness' sake make sure you are able to speak it, at least passably. Explanation: The correct answer emphasizes the importance of familiarizing oneself with various aspects of the host country's culture and learning the local language. This will help an expatriate better adapt to and enjoy their time abroad. The other options are incorrect for the following reasons: - The first option is confusing and does not specifically address how to prepare oneself for living in a new country. It mentions an expat teaching and drawing up a business plan, which is irrelevant to the main idea. - The third option appears to be a mix of unrelated ideas, mentioning \\"Christmas customs in the U.S.\\" and \\"hiring an ironing professional.\\" It does not provide a coherent or relevant suggestion for someone preparing to live in a foreign country. - The fourth option focuses on the embassy or consulate's offerings, which is not the primary concern for someone seeking to adapt to and enjoy living in a new country.

Green plants obtain their carbohydrate supply from the carbon dioxide in the air by the process of photosynthesis. Carbon and oxygen are absorbed from the air, while other nutrients are absorbed from the soil. Nutrient uptake in the soil is achieved by cation exchange, wherein root hairs pump hydrogen ions (H+) into the soil through proton pumps. These hydrogen ions displace cations attached to negatively charged soil particles so that the cations are available for uptake by the root. In the leaves, stomata open to take in carbon dioxide and expel oxygen. The carbon dioxide molecules are used as the carbon source in photosynthesis.\\". Can you tell me what it is?

After more than a year of effort, attorneys with Northwest Justice Project earlier this week told 25 families in a mobile home park here that they can keep their homes and no longer need to fear eviction. The East Wenatchee City Council has entered into an Interlocal Agreement with the Wenatchee Housing Authority authorizing the Authority to purchase and maintain the Mobile Park Plaza mobile home park. Located just north of the Wenatchee Valley Mall, the park had been threatened with closure for more than a year. \\"We cannot say enough about how relieved we are that this is over,\\" said Manuel Luna, one of the residents of Mobile Park Plaza. \\"We were afraid that no solution would be found, and that our families would have no place to go. We are very grateful for the help of our attorneys. Without them, we would not have saved our homes. We are also thankful for the help of the Housing Authority, the City Council and Mayor Steve Lacy.\\" Formerly owned by local businessman Dan Jennings, Mobile Park Plaza had been home to 45 low-income families, many of them Latino farm workers. In October 2000 Jennings gave the park residents notice of his intent to close the park effective November 30, 2001. While some park residents decided to move, others, including 25 families, organized an informal association to relocate or save their homes. Unable to afford private legal counsel, the families asked for help from legal services attorneys at the Northwest Justice Project and Columbia Legal Services. In the succeeding months, these attorneys worked with representatives of the Greater Wenatchee Housing Authority, the state Office of Community Development, Chelan County, the City of East Wenatchee, state legislators, Jennings and others to secure funding and find a solution. \\"There seemed to be a never-ending set of obstacles,\\" said Patrick Pleas, an attorney with Northwest Justice Project. \\"Mr. Jennings had financial considerations, the City had growth and economic development considerations, and the State and Housing Authority had their own concerns. Thankfully, hard work and good will from all parties allowed us to find a solution that works for everyone.\\" Northwest Justice Project and Columbia Legal Services are non-profit organizations that provide civil legal assistance to low-income individuals and families throughout Washington state. Members of the state's Access to Justice Network, these organizations work with thousands of volunteer attorneys to ensure that justice is available to those who face critical legal problems and can't afford private legal counsel.

Answer based on context: Coming off their win over the Colts, the Patriots flew to Ford Field, donned their throwback uniforms, and played a Week 12 Thanksgiving game with the Detroit Lions. After the first three possessions of the game ended in punts, the struck first blood, driving all the way to the Lions 2-yard line, but could only muster a 19-yard field goal by Shayne Graham. The Lions countered, driving 71 yards in 11 plays, scoring on a 19-yard touchdown pass from Shaun Hill to Calvin Johnson. After a Patriots punt, another long Lions drive, going 63 yards in 13 plays, ended with running back Maurice Morris punching through a 1-yard touchdown run, increasing the Lions lead to 14-3. The Patriots answered their touchdown with one of their own, marching 83 yards in 10 plays, scoring on a 15-yard touchdown run by Green-Ellis with 0:45 seconds left in the half. The Lions appeared to have stopped the Patriots after Brady threw an incomplete pass on 3rd-and-6, but DeAndre Levy was called for pass interference, giving the Patriots a 1st down. Stefan Logan returned the ensuing kickoff 30 yards to the Lions 33. The return allowed the Lions to drive to the Patriots 26 and Dave Rayner was good on a 44-yard field goal, giving the Patriots a 17-10 halftime lead. After forcing a Patriots punt, McCourty intercepted Hill on an underthrown pass, and returned it 23 yards to the Lions' 26. Five plays later, Brady threw a 5-yard touchdown pass to Welker, tying the game 17-17. However, the Patriots weak defense couldn't catch a break. Aided by Logan's 42-yard return, the Lions countered, marching 58 yards in 9 plays, with Morris scoring on a 1-yard touchdown run, putting the Lions back out in front, 24-17. The Patriots needed just three plays to strike back, with Brady finding Branch deep on a 79-yard touchdown, capping off the 87-yard drive and tying the game 24-24. This was the Patriots' longest play from scrimmage of their 2010 season. After a 30-yard kick return by Logan, the Lions drove all the way to the Patriots 28, but Rayner missed a 46-yard field goal, keeping the game tied. The Patriots regained the lead on their ensuing drive, with Brady completing 3/3 passes for 59 yards on a 64-yard drive, finding Branch again on a 22-yard touchdown pass early in the fourth quarter. After a Lions punt, the Patriots marched 84 yards in 7 plays, scoring on a 16-yard touchdown pass to Welker, extending the lead to 38-24. On the third play of the Lions' next drive, Hill was intercepted by McCourty, who returned it 50 yards to the Lions 12. Four plays later, the Patriots put the game out of reach with a 1-yard touchdown run by Green-Ellis, making the score 45-24. During the extra point and afterwards, the Lions were called for three personal fouls, including one on defensive tackle Ndamukong Suh. This allowed the Patriots to kick off from the Lions' 40-yard line, and Graham was able to put the ball through the uprights, to a storm of boos from the Ford Field crowd. The Lions drove to the Patriots 6-yard line, but turned the ball over on downs and the Patriots took a knee to end the game. With the win, New England improved to 9-2. Brady (21/27, 341 yards, 4 touchdowns, perfect 158.3 passer rating) was named CBS's All-Iron Award winner by Phil Simms. Runners up for the award included Suh, Johnson, Branch, and Morris.

Businesses can view this increase in retail sales as an opportunity, adjusting their strategies to cater to the growing demand. However, they must also remain cautious about the potential impact of higher interest rates on their expenses and borrowing capacity, and should assess the financial landscape before making any significant financial decisions.

Ziyed Ben Belgacem, 39, was killed after he put a gun to a soldier's head saying he wanted to \\"die for Allah\\". Earlier on Saturday, he was involved in a shooting and then a carjacking. His father told French radio that his son had phoned after the first attack to say he had \\"screwed up with a gendarme\\", before proceeding to Orly. Belgacem is described as having been radicalised in prison, and was on a police watch-list. His criminal record included convictions for armed robbery and drugs offences, Paris prosecutor Francois Molins told reporters late on Saturday. Intelligence agents searched his home in Garges-les-Gonesse, north of Paris, for evidence of Islamist sympathies, but reportedly found nothing. However, traces of cocaine were discovered during the search. Early on Saturday morning, Belgacem was stopped at a checkpoint in Garges-les-Gonesse, north of Paris. He fired at police with a pellet gun before escaping in a car that was later found abandoned. Police say he then stole a car at gunpoint from a woman at Vitry, south of Paris. That car was later found at Orly airport. Belgacem arrived at the airport and attacked a military patrol in the south terminal. He tried to seize a servicewoman's automatic weapon, put his gun to her head and said: \\"I'm here to die for Allah. In any case people are going to die.\\" He was then shot dead by two other soldiers. A copy of the Koran was found on his body, Mr Molins added. His father, brother and cousin were taken in for questioning in the aftermath of the attack. All of them have since been released without charge. Speaking to Europe 1 radio on Sunday, the father said his son was not a terrorist, but someone who \\"never prayed and he drank\\". \\"This is what  happens under the influence of drink and cannabis,\\" the father said. He said he had received a phone call from Belgacem after his initial attack in which he said: \\"Dad, please forgive me. I've screwed up with a police  officer.\\" Then he hung up saying he was on the motorway. The BBC's Hugh Schofield in Paris says the picture is building up of a man on the criminal fringes of society, who also consorted with Islamist radicals. Orly -  located 13km (8 miles) south of Paris - is the capital's second-largest airport. The attack came at a sensitive time. France has presidential elections starting next month and remains under a state of emergency. The soldiers at Orly were part of Operation Sentinel - involving thousands of soldiers deployed to provide back-up to the police after the Charlie Hebdo attack in January 2015  and the Paris attacks of November 2015.

Your dermatologist can check your age spots to make sure there are no causes for concern. Additionally, they’ll help you learn what’s normal and what’s not. If you don’t have a dermatologist, ask your primary care physician for a referral or search for one online. Your doctor will numb the area around the spot before taking a skin biopsy. Then, they’ll insert a thin device or scalpel to remove a tiny piece of skin. Next, they’ll send that skin off to be tested to make sure the spot is benign. The biopsy may cause you discomfort, but you shouldn’t experience any pain. If over-the-counter bleaching creams don’t work for you, a prescription option can help. These creams can fade your age spots in a few months with regular use. For example, your doctor may prescribe a bleaching cream called hydroquinone. In some cases, they’ll pair this cream with retinoids and a mild steroid to speed up the process. If at-home treatments don’t work for you and the brown spots really bother you, there are treatments you can get in a dermatologist’s office. These treatments can be more effective than home remedies. Here are some treatments available to you:  Laser or light therapy can fade your brown spots, though you will likely need 2 or 3 sessions to see results. Cryotherapy targets the age spots with liquid nitrogen, which freezes the pigment and breaks it up. You might experience some discomfort with this treatment, and scarring can occur. Dermabrasion and microdermabrasion involve scrubbing off the top layer of your skin, which can fade your brown spots. However, you’ll likely need several treatments, and redness and scabbing can occur. Chemical peels remove the top layer of skin, which is replaced by new skin. With repeated treatments, chemical peels can fade your age spots. However, you’ll likely experience redness and discomfort.","output":"Age spots are normal and harmless but can sometimes resemble skin cancer.

You will be given a task. You must generate a detailed and long answer. Concepts: concrete, reinforce, site Write a sentence that includes all these words.","output":"As an Artificial Intelligence assistant, I am tasked with formulating a detailed and comprehensive response integrating the three concepts provided, which are \\"concrete,\\" \\"reinforce,\\" and \\"site.\\" Upon analyzing these three terms, it's evident that they all intersect in the construction industry, as concrete is a commonly used building material, reinforcement is a crucial process in construction, and a site is where the construction actually occurs. Beginning with the first term, \\"concrete\\" is a composite material that comprises coarse aggregate bonded with fluid cement, which hardens over time. It is a critical element in many construction projects due to its strength and durability. Concrete plays a pivotal role in structural engineering, given its unique capabilities, like high compressive strength, impermeability, and longevity, among others. It is used extensively for a multitude of structures such as buildings, dams, bridges, roads, and more. The second concept is \\"reinforce.\\" In the context of construction and engineering, reinforcement is the process of strengthening a particular structure to ensure it can sustain the load it's designed to bear. Reinforcement often involves the use of materials like steel bars, mesh, or fibers in the case of concrete, which improve the mechanical performance of the structure. This process greatly enhances the tensile strength, durability, and elasticity of the structure, making it more resilient to factors like weather conditions, weight, and geological influences. Lastly, the term \\"site\\" within the scope of construction refers to the actual locale where a building, infrastructure, or any engineered project is to be constructed. A site is subject to careful analysis and planning before the actual construction commences, taking into account factors like soil condition, topography, availability of resources, and accessibility. Moreover, site management is an essential aspect of a construction project, involving multiple complex tasks such as coordinating human resources, logistics, waste management, safety provisions, and more. Bringing these three concepts together, one could form a sentence like this: \\"On the construction site, the team utilized reinforced concrete to erect the framework of the building, ensuring that the structure is robust and durable enough to withstand the test of time and physical pressure.\\" This sentence reveals how these three terms interact and depend on each other in real-world scenarios. The construction \\"site\\" is where the activity happens. \\"Reinforce\\" describes the method used to strengthen the materials used on site, specifically \\"concrete\\" in this case. Consequently, the resulting reinforced concrete is a composite material that brings together the benefits of concrete's substantial compressive strength and reinforcement's enhanced tensile strength, presenting a compelling solution for demanding construction tasks."},{"instruction":"Given a definition of a task and a sample input, break the definition into small parts.

David Cameron’s vow that Britain and its allies would not allow Islamic State to form caliphate on Europe’s doorstep had a hollow ring for the besieged people of Kobani yesterday. Huge plumes of smoke billowed over the pivotal border town as jihadi fanatics – some claiming to be British – launched a terrifying onslaught. Kobani, which lies just inside Syria on the border with Nato member Turkey, has been described as the town the world cannot afford to lose to the terrorists. Scroll down for video Gran's army: Women line up with Kalashnikov assault rifles in the besieged border town of Kobani, Syria But the ease with which British and other fanatics slip between","output":"Europe and the Middle East to join the extremists has exposed the weakness of the Western response. Meanwhile, the Turkish government's hesitance to intervene militarily has further fueled criticism and frustration. As the situation in Kobani becomes increasingly dire, Western nations finally recognize the need for a more robust response. They increase their air strikes on ISIS positions around the town, and, after considerable diplomatic pressure, Turkey finally agrees to allow its military to join the fight. In a decisive battle, the joint forces of the international coalition and the local Kurdish defenders manage to break the ISIS siege of Kobani. The jihadi fanatics are driven out of the town and are forced to retreat. Many of the foreign fighters, including the so-called British jihadists, are captured and extradited to face justice in their home countries. Although the victory at Kobani is celebrated as a significant triumph over ISIS, it signals the beginning of a long and arduous journey to eliminate the extremist group's influence in the region completely. Slowly, with the support of the international community and the determination of local forces, the tide begins to turn against the terrorists. Over time, ISIS loses its territorial gains, and its once-feared caliphate crumbles. The group splinters and dwindles in influence as its leaders are hunted down and eliminated. Meanwhile, the people of Kobani and other war-torn regions work tirelessly to rebuild their lives and their communities, progressing towards a more stable and hopeful future. In the end, the story serves as a stark reminder of the importance of international cooperation and determination in the fight against extremism. The battle for Kobani stands as a symbol of the world's refusal to allow terror to triumph, and a testament to the resilience and courage of those who resist it."},{"instruction":"Please answer the following question: Given the following passage  \\"If the highest echelons of the governments also take advantage from corruption or embezzlement from the state's treasury, it is sometimes referred with the neologism kleptocracy.

Answer this question: Which of the following is formed when two elements combine chemically? Select from:  +an atom  +a compound  +an electron  +a mixture. Answer:","output":"A compound is formed when two elements combine chemically. In chemistry, a compound is a substance formed when two or more elements combine chemically, creating a completely new substance that has different properties from the original elements. This combination is undergone via a chemical reaction. In order to form a compound, the elements involved must be in fixed proportions. It's not enough for the elements just to be mixed together. They have to interact and bond, usually through sharing or transferring outer electrons. Two or more atoms join together to create a molecule of the compound. For instance, one atom of nitrogen can react with three atoms of hydrogen to form ammonium (NH3) which is a compound. It's important to note that a compound is different from a mixture (which is simply a physical combination of different substances, not a chemical one) or an atom (the smallest single part of an element) or an electron (a subatomic particle that orbits the atom's nucleus). Compounds exhibit properties entirely different to the elements that constitute them. For instance, sodium is a highly reactive metal and chlorine is a toxic gas. But when these two elements combine chemically, they form sodium chloride - common table salt which is safe to consume. So, essentially, when two different elements combine chemically, they form a compound, which has unique properties and exist at fixed proportions in the compound."},{"instruction":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

Answer the following question: I can use this background: Acromyrmex heyeri is a species of leaf-cutter ant, a New World ant of the subfamily Myrmicinae of the genus Acromyrmex. Acromyrmex heyeri workers construct the colonies nest by thatching together cut grass. At temperatures ranging from 20–30 °C, workers created more openings in the nest thatch as the internal nest temperature goes up as a method of temperature regulation for the colony. The workers will close openings in the nest thatch as the air humidity surrounding the nest decreases to reduce water loss for the colony.  Now, I have a new situation: Ants are one of the most interesting creatures on earth. David wants to study ants for his biology project. He is specifically interested in ant species Acromyrmex heyeri. This semester he studied this ant in Americas.  First day when he studied the ants the temperature was 10 degree Centigrade. In the second day of his study the temperature rose to 25 degree Centigrade. In the third  day of his study the air humidity was high. But in the fourth day of his study air humidity dropped. David wants to continue his study of this same ant species in Asia next semester.  Answer this question please: Which day David would see openings in the nest hatch open, third day or fourth day? Answer:","output":"David would likely observe openings in the nest thatch on the third day of his study. This is because Acromyrmex heyeri ants effectively manage their nest's internal temperature and humidity by controlling the airflow through the openings in the thatch. On the first day of his study, the temperature was 10°C, which is lower than the optimal temperature range of 20-30°C for these ants. It is less likely that the ants would create or maintain more openings to regulate temperature since the environment is cooler than their optimal range. On the second day, the temperature rose to 25°C, which falls within the ideal temperature range for Acromyrmex heyeri ants. This is when the ants might start creating more openings in the nest thatch as the internal nest temperature goes up to maintain a suitable temperature for the colony. On the third day, the air humidity was high, which makes it more favorable for the ants to maintain the openings in the nest thatch, as it would not lead to significant water loss for the colony. This day, therefore, presents the most suitable conditions for David to observe openings in the nest thatch. On the fourth day, the air humidity dropped, leading the ants to close the openings in the nest thatch to reduce water loss and maintain colony humidity. Consequently, David would observe fewer or no openings in the nest thatch on this day. As David plans to continue his study of the Acromyrmex heyeri species in Asia next semester, it is crucial for him to note that this ant species is native to the New World and may not be naturally found in Asia. David might have to replicate the environmental conditions and conduct his study on ants in a controlled laboratory setting, import the ants from the Americas or consider studying a similar leaf-cutter ant species that is native to Asia."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

These campaigns expanded Han sovereignty into the Tarim Basin of Central Asia, divided the Xiongnu into two separate confederations, and helped establish the vast trade network known as the Silk Road, which reached as far as the Mediterranean world. The territories north of Han's borders were quickly overrun by the nomadic Xianbei confederation. Emperor Wu also launched successful military expeditions in the south, annexing Nanyue in 111 BC and Dian in 109 BC, and in the Korean Peninsula where the Xuantu and Lelang Commanderies were established in 108 BC.\\"? The answer to this question is:","output":"What were the significant outcomes of the Han victory over the Xiongnu, and how did these events contribute to the establishment and expansion of the Silk Road? Answer: The significant outcomes of the Han victory over the Xiongnu were that the Xiongnu accepted vassal status as Han tributaries, Han sovereignty expanded into the Tarim Basin of Central Asia, the Xiongnu were divided into two separate confederations, and the Silk Road trade network was established, reaching as far as the Mediterranean world."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Mark Messier files suit against NYC over 350M Bronx project Updated: Wednesday, April 13, 2016, 6:40 AM Rangers legend Mark Messier wants to send Mayor de Blasio and the city’s Economic Development Corp. to the penalty box for failing to hand over the keys to the long-empty Kingsbridge Armory. Messier and the developers behind the Kingsbridge National Ice Center filed a lawsuit Tuesday accusing the city of breach of contract and purposely sabotaging the 350 million Bronx project. The suit, filed in Bronx Supreme Court, alleges former EDC President Kyle Kimball conspired with three former KNIC business partners in 2014 in a failed bid give them control over the project. The Norwood News first reported the legal slapshot. The lawsuit also accuses the EDC of delaying the closing and holding the lease to the cavernous site in escrow until KNIC raised 158 million for the project’s first phase. Messier, 55, and KNIC want a judge to order EDC to turn over the lease along with unspecified money damages. The agency denied any role in delaying the ice center project. “NYCEDC has bent over backwards to support the Kingsbridge project through continued legal and operational challenges faced by the KNIC team,” spokesman Anthony Hogrebe said. “Any allegations to the contrary are totally unfounded.” What are the most important parts of this text?","output":"1.

Given a task, you explain in simple steps what the task is asking, any guidelines it provides and how to use those guidelines to find the answer. In this task, you are given a premise, a hypothesis, and an update. The premise sentence describes a real-world situation and is always assumed to be true. The hypothesis sentence describes an assumption or inference that you might make about that situation having read the premise. The update provides additional information about the situation that might weaken or strengthen the hypothesis. A weakener is a statement that weakens the hypothesis. It makes you much less likely to believe the hypothesis is true. A strengthener is a statement that strengthens the hypothesis. It makes you much more likely to believe the hypothesis is true. Your task is to output 'strengthener' or 'weakener' if the update strengths or weakens the hypothesis, respectively.

Your task is to classify whether the given title is suitable or not for the research paper based on the given paragraph. Return \\"True\\" if title is proper according to paragraph else \\"False\\". Paragraph: Theiler's murine encephalomyelitis virus (TMEV) and other neurotropic virus infections result in degeneration of each component of the neuron: apoptosis of the cell body, axonal (Wallerian) degeneration, and dendritic and synaptic pathology. In general, axonal degeneration is detrimental for hosts. However, axonal degeneration can be beneficial in the case of infection with neurotropic viruses that spread in the CNS using axonal transport. C57BL/Wld S (Wld S , Wallerian degeneration slow mutant) mice are protected from axonal degeneration. Wld S mice infected with the neurovirulent GDVII strain of TMEV are more resistant to virus infection than wild-type mice, suggesting that axonal preservation contributes to the resistance. By contrast, infection with the less virulent Daniels strain of TMEV results in high levels of virus propagation in the CNS, suggesting that prolonged survival of axons in Wld S mice favors virus spread. Thus, axonal degeneration might be a beneficial self-destruct mechanism that limits the spread of neurotropic viruses, in the case of less virulent virus infection. We hypothesize that neurons use 'built-in' self-destruct protection machinery (compartmental neurodegeneration) against neurotropic virus infection, since the CNS is an immunologically privileged site. Early induction of apoptosis in the neuronal cell body limits virus replication. Wallerian degeneration of the axon prevents axonal transport of virus. Dendritic and synaptic degeneration blocks virus transmission at synapses. Thus, the balance between neurodegeneration and virus propagation may be taken into account in the future design of neuroprotective therapy. Neurons are the transmitting cells of the nervous system and communicate by chemical and electrical means. A neuron can be divided into different components: cell body (soma), a longer cell process called an axon, branching processes called dendrites and synapses. A neuron transmits information via the axon, which terminates at a synapse for conveying ongoing signals, while dendrites integrate incoming signals. Since axons as well as their neuronal cell bodies do not usually regenerate in the CNS, axonal damage often results in permanent neurological deficits. Axonal degeneration in the CNS can be seen in several neurological conditions, such as neurodegenerative diseases (e.g., amyotrophic lateral sclerosis and neuroaxonal dystrophy) [1], traumatic lesions and infections [2] [3] [4] [5] .

Provide a detailed answer so user don’t need to search outside to understand the answer. Given the question: I have a test where I am given the following article, what is an answer for the question: What is the first name of the person whose first husband murdered her second husband? ?  Monte Beragon, the second husband of Mildred Pierce, is shot. The police tell Mildred that the murderer is her first husband, Bert Pierce, after he is interrogated and confesses to the crime. Mildred protests that he is too kind and gentle to commit murder, and reveals her life story to the investigating officer in flashback. Mildred and Bert are unhappily married. Mildred must bake and sell pies and cakes to support the family after Bert splits with his business partner, Wally Fay. Bert bitterly accuses Mildred of favoring their daughters, especially Veda, over him. Their quarrel intensifies after a phone call from Bert's mistress, Maggie Biederhof, and they decide to separate. Mildred retains custody of her two daughters, the 16-year-old Veda, a bratty social climber and aspiring pianist, and 10-year-old Kay, a tomboy. Mildred's principal goal is to provide material possessions for Veda, who longs for a social status above that of her family and is ashamed of her mother's work as a baker. When Mildred is forced to take a job as a waitress, she tries to hide the fact from Veda, but Veda learns the truth and treats her mother with derision. Mildred meets Monte Beragon, a Pasadena society playboy and heir whose inheritance is almost depleted. Beragon owns the building that Mildred wants to purchase for a restaurant, and he pursues a romantic interest in her. While the two are at his beach house during a weekend jaunt, Kay contracts pneumonia and dies after a trip with Veda and Bert. Mildred channels her grief into work and throws herself into opening a new restaurant. With the help of her friend and former supervisor, Ida Corwin, Mildred's restaurant is a success. Wally helps Mildred buy the property, and soon she owns a chain of restaurants throughout Southern California. The answer is:","output":"Mildred"},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Premise: \\"Chinatown itself remains a hive of bustling activity, standing cheek by jowl with a Little India of pungent spice shops and ornate Hindu temples.\\" Based on this premise, is the hypothesis \\"There are a number of spice shops in Little India.\\" true?","output":"Based on the given premise, it can be reasonably inferred that the hypothesis \\"There are a number of spice shops in Little India\\" is true. The premise states that Little India is a place with \\"pungent spice shops,\\" suggesting that the presence of these shops is a significant and characteristic feature of the area. Moreover, the use of the term \\"bustling activity\\" implies that there is a notable level of commerce and movement within both Chinatown and Little India. It can be assumed that, within this context, the variety and number of spice shops would contribute to the vibrancy and dynamism of Little India. This inference is further supported by the description of Little India as standing \\"cheek by jowl with Chinatown.\\" The close proximity of these culturally distinct areas creates a vibrant and diverse setting, which may accommodate a higher concentration of unique businesses, such as spice shops. Additionally, the mention of \\"ornate Hindu temples\\" gives more context to the cultural makeup of Little India. As many Hindu religious ceremonies and traditions involve the use of fragrant and symbolic spices, it is fitting that the region would contain an abundance of spice shops to cater to the needs of its residents and visitors alike. While it is crucial to note that the given premise does not explicitly state the number of spice shops in Little India, the description leaves little doubt that they play a significant role in defining the area's ambiance and cultural identity. Therefore, based on these supporting factors, the hypothesis that there are a number of spice shops in Little India can be considered true."},{"instruction":"You are a teacher.

Solve 210*v - 219*v = 117*v - 1512 for v.","output":"Let's solve the equation step by step: 1. First, we need to simplify the equation by collecting like terms. On the left-hand side, we have 210*v - 219*v, and on the right-hand side, we have 117*v - 1512.  2. We can subtract the v coefficients on the left-hand side: 210*v - 219*v = (-9)*v Now the equation looks like this: (-9)*v = 117*v - 1512 3. Next, we'll get all the \\"v\\" terms on one side of the equation by adding 9*v to both sides: (-9)*v + 9*v = 117*v - 1512 + 9*v 0*v = 126*v - 1512 4. Now, we need to isolate \\"v\\" on one side of the equation. To do this, we'll divide both sides by the coefficient of \\"v\\" (126): 0 = v - (1512 / 126) 5. We can simplify the fraction by dividing both the numerator and denominator by the greatest common divisor (GCD) of 1512 and 126, which is 126: 0 = v - (12 / 1) 6. Finally, we'll add (12 / 1) to both sides of the equation to solve for \\"v\\": v = 12 So, the solution to the equation 210*v - 219*v = 117*v - 1512 is v = 12."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant that follows instruction extremely well.

North Korean forces struck massively in the summer of 1950 and nearly drove the outnumbered US and ROK defenders into the sea. However the United Nations intervened, naming Douglas MacArthur commander of its forces, and UN-US-ROK forces held a perimeter around Pusan, gaining time for reinforcement. MacArthur, in a bold but risky move, ordered an amphibious invasion well behind the front lines at Inchon, cutting off and routing the North Koreans and quickly crossing the 38th Parallel into North Korea. As UN forces continued to advance toward the Yalu River on the border with Communist China, the Chinese crossed the Yalu River in October and launched a series of surprise attacks that sent the UN forces reeling back across the 38th Parallel. Truman originally wanted a Rollback strategy to unify Korea; after the Chinese successes he settled for a Containment policy to split the country. MacArthur argued for rollback but was fired by President Harry Truman after disputes over the conduct of the war. Peace negotiations dragged on for two years until President Dwight D. Eisenhower threatened China with nuclear weapons; an armistice was quickly reached with the two Koreas remaining divided at the 38th parallel. North and South Korea are still today in a state of war, having never signed a peace treaty, and American forces remain stationed in South Korea as part of American foreign policy.

Q: Paragraph: Infectious bronchitis is considered to be one of the most devastating diseases in poultry. Control of its spread is typically attempted through biosecurity measures and extensive vaccination. However, the remarkable genetic and antigenic variability of the virus, which originate from both mutations and recombination events, represents an unsolved challenge for this disease. The present study reports on the emergence and spread of recombinant clusters detected in Italy and Spain between 2012 and 2014. A total of 36 Spanish and Italian infectious bronchitis virus (IBV) field strains were investigated and genetically characterized using phylogenetic, molecular, recombination and selection pressure analyses of the complete S1 gene. Based on the partial S1 sequencing, 27 IBV strains originating from Spain and nine from Italy were initially classified as being closely related to the Guandong/Xindadi (XDN) genotype. Phylogenetic analysis of the complete S1 gene revealed that the XDN strains formed a homogeneous clade with the Spanish IBV isolates within the QX genotype, whereas there was higher variability within the Italian strains. Recombination analysis determined that these strains belonged to four groups, which originated from independent recombination events between the QX and 793B IBV genotypes. Our data support the hypothesis of two different scenarios: firstly, in Spain, the large and homogeneous clade probably originated from a single offspring of the recombinant founder, which became dominant and spread throughout the country. Secondly, the nine Italian recombinants, which are characterized by three different recombination patterns, probably represent less fitted strains, because they were less viable with respect to their recombinant parents.

I’ve shared my feelings about Temple Spa before in my review of Repose Aromatherapy Resting Cream. Basically, my first experience was a very pushy salesperson at a wedding fair several years ago which really put me off the brand, and it took me a while to try their products again. But when I did I was really impressed, and I can honestly say that nothing I’ve reviewed since has disappointed me! Today I’m reviewing Temple Spa Trufflesque, an Ultra  Hydration & Radiance Masque for the face. Trufflesque aims to give hydration and radiance to the skin, and plumps to help reduce the appearance of fine lines and wrinkles. It’s a luxury mask suitable for all skin types, particularly dry or dull skin, and it helps to rejuvenate tired skin too. The impressive list of ingredients includes black truffles, gold and silk peptides, but unfortunately these expensive additives contribute to Trufflesque’s slightly expensive price tag. The first thing that strikes me about this product is the amazing packaging. All Temple Spa products have really amazing, premium packaging, and I feel that they add to the feeling that you are about to use something really special on your skin. The dark glass jar has a gold lid and it is nestled in a gold and chocolate brown box with the most amazingly cute mask brush slotted in too. The mask itself is gold and it shimmers so prettily, if you look closely it’s almost as if you can see the particles of real gold! To apply you just paint the golden mask onto your face with the cute little brush (it makes applying the mask so easy) then leave for 15-20 minutes.  The mask doesn’t dry completely, it stays a little bit tacky to the touch, and I find that it makes my skin tingle quite a bit. For extra benefits you can also then massage the mask into your skin for around 2 minutes, before removing with a damp muslin cloth or flannel. At the end of the story the narrator probably felt  A.

No. While the sentence \\"According to 14th century historiography (Cronica de Berno, 1309), Bern was founded in 1191 by Berthold V, Duke of Zähringen\\" provides valuable historical context regarding the city of Bern and its founding by a member of the Zähringen family, it does not provide a direct and valid answer to the question \\"Where did the Zahringer ruling family rise to power?\\" To answer the question, it is necessary to explore the origins of the Zähringer family and identify the areas where they initially gained influence and expanded their power. The Zähringer family originated in the Swabia region, which is currently part of southwestern Germany and eastern Switzerland. They eventually became a significant ruling family in the Holy Roman Empire during the High Middle Ages. The Zähringer family first rose to power in their ancestral estate, the County of Zähringen, located in the Duchy of Swabia. They then expanded their influence by establishing new territories in what is now modern-day Germany and Switzerland, including the cities of Freiburg, Brugg, and Bern, among others. The family's power continued to grow through strategic alliances, marriages, and territorial acquisitions in the Swabian and Alemannic areas of the empire. Through these political maneuvers, the Zähringer family earned the title of dukes in 1100 AD, and they would later become widely regarded as the founders of certain Swiss cities, with Bern as a notable example. In summary, while the sentence about Bern's founding by Berthold V, Duke of Zähringer, provides information about their territorial expansion and influence, it does not specifically address where the Zähringer family initially rose to power. The correct response to the question \\"Where did the Zahringer ruling family rise to power?\\" would be to point out that they came from the County of Zähringen within the Duchy of Swabia and subsequently expanded their power throughout the region."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Write an article based on this \\"Sauté Steam Microwave beans to cook them faster. Roast them for a crisp and flavorful side dish. Bake them into a casserole. Add them to soup.\\" Article:","output":"Title: Versatile Ways to Cook Beans for Fast, Flavorful, and Healthy Meals Introduction Beans are not only a nutritional powerhouse, but they are also an incredibly versatile ingredient that can be prepared in a myriad of ways. From sautéing and steaming to roasting and baking, there are plenty of methods to achieve delicious and healthy bean dishes for any meal. In this article, we will explore various techniques to cook beans faster, create a crisp and flavorful side dish, bake them into a casserole, and add them to soups. So, let's dive in and discover the wonderful world of bean preparation! 1. Sauté, Steam, and Microwave: Quick Methods to Cook Beans Time is of the essence in today's fast-paced world, and these three techniques will ensure that your beans are cooked quickly without sacrificing taste or nutrition:   - Sautéing: Heat a little oil in a pan, add your beans (preferably pre-soaked or canned), and cook them on medium-high heat for 5-10 minutes, stirring occasionally, until they are tender and lightly browned. Season with your favorite herbs, spices, or sauces for an easy and flavorful bean dish. - Steaming: Place the beans in a steamer basket over boiling water, cover, and steam for about 5-10 minutes, depending on the bean type, until tender. Steaming helps to preserve the nutrients and retain their bright color. You can enhance the flavor by adding herbs, spices, or even a splash of vinegar to the steaming water. - Microwaving: Rinse and drain your beans, then place them in a microwave-safe dish with a splash of water. Cover the dish with a microwave-safe lid or plate and cook on high for about 4-5 minutes, stirring halfway through, until your beans are tender. Season with salt, pepper, and other seasonings as desired. 2. Roast Them for a Crisp and Flavorful Side Dish Roasting is not only an excellent method to bring out the natural, nutty flavor of beans, but it also gives them a lovely, crispy texture. To roast beans, simply: - Preheat your oven to 400°F (200°C). - Drain and rinse your beans thoroughly, then pat them dry with a paper towel. - Place the beans in a single layer on a lined baking sheet. - Drizzle with a little olive oil, and toss with salt, pepper, and your favorite seasonings. - Roast the beans in the oven for approximately 20-25 minutes, flipping them halfway through, until they are golden brown and slightly crispy. 3. Bake Beans into a Hearty Casserole Bean casseroles are fantastic as a main dish, a side dish, or even for meal-prepping. There are countless bean casserole recipes to suit any taste, so feel free to get creative! To prepare a basic bean casserole: - Preheat your oven to 350°F (175°C). - Combine cooked beans, cooked vegetables (e.g., onions, bell peppers, or zucchini), a protein source (e.g., cooked chicken, ground beef, or tofu), and your preferred sauce or seasoning in a large mixing bowl. - Pour the bean mixture into a greased oven-safe dish. - Optionally, top with cheese or breadcrumbs for added flavor and texture. - Bake the casserole for about 30-40 minutes, or until bubbly and golden brown on top. 4. Add Beans to Soup for a Wholesome, Filling Meal Including beans in your soups is a great way to add protein, fiber, and a comforting, hearty texture. Beans work well in various soup types, from vegetable-based to protein-rich, and even cream-based soups. To add beans to your soup: - Choose a suitable bean variety that complements your soup's flavor profile. - If using canned beans, rinse and drain them before adding to the soup. - If using dried beans, pre-soak and cook them until tender. - Add the beans to the soup during the last 10-15 minutes of cooking to prevent them from turning mushy. Conclusion As you can see, beans are an incredibly versatile ingredient that can be cooked in numerous ways, depending on the desired outcome and the time available. These techniques will help you prepare beans that are delicious, fast, and perfect for any meal. From sautéing, steaming, and microwaving for a quick fix, to roasting for a crispy side dish, or incorporating them into casseroles and soups, beans are an indispensable addition to every healthy kitchen. Happy cooking!"},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant. You will be given a task. You must generate a detailed and long answer.

Summarize the following: Geishas cover up their eyebrows, and then redraw them. Since you have already covered your eyebrows, it’s time to draw them in. Using a steady hand, draw in the eyebrows with a black or dark brown eyebrow pencil.  Make sure that the eyebrows you draw in are not too thick, and that they have a gentle arch as opposed to being straight across. Some geishas incorporate a little red into the beginnings of their eyebrows. Do what you wish according to your preferences. Many geishas use red makeup for the outer corners of their eyes. Geisha apprentices, called maiko, usually use the most amount of red, and as they go through training they wear less and less. You have some liberty about what amount of red eye shadow you want to use. Some geishas draw red eye makeup in a small dot at the corner of their eye, while others draw diamond shapes, or simply layer a light layer of red without forming a specific shape. Use a gel liner or liquid eyeliner and apply a line of black against your top lash line. A gel or liquid eyeliner will give you the crisp, precise look that you want for your top lash line. If you wish, you can also apply eyeliner to the bottom lash line using a pencil. Use a red lip liner to create a lower and upper lip line about a centimeter in from your actual lip line. For the upper lip, draw the line slightly lower than your actual lip line. For the lower lip, draw the line a little higher than your natural line. In traditional Japanese culture, a small, pouty mouth is considered beautiful. This is why geishas draw their mouths smaller than they actually are. Use a red lipstick to fill in the lips that you outlined with pencil. Traditional geisha lipstick is made from beni, extract from Japanese safflower. This extract is mixed with water and applied using a brush.  However, you can use any bright-red lipstick that has a lustrous finish.","output":"In this text, the author outlines the process of recreating a traditional geisha makeup look, emphasizing the key aspects of drawing eyebrows, applying red makeup around the eyes, as well as lining and filling in the lips. Starting with the eyebrows, the author instructs to draw them in with a black or dark brown eyebrow pencil, ensuring that they are not too thick and have a gentle arch. Some geishas may add a touch of red at the beginnings of the eyebrows, depending on personal preferences.  Regarding eye makeup, geishas use red makeup for the outer corners of their eyes, with apprentices (maiko) generally wearing more red than experienced geishas. The amount and shape of red eye makeup varies, ranging from small dots to diamond shapes or simply a light layer of red without any specific shape. A gel or liquid eyeliner should be applied on the top lash line for a precise look and, if desired, a pencil can be used on the bottom lash line. For the lips, a red lip liner is used to draw lip lines about a centimeter in from one's actual lip line, creating a small, pouty mouth considered beautiful in traditional Japanese culture. The upper lip line should be slightly lower than one's actual lip line, while the lower lip line should be slightly higher. Finally, lips should be filled in with a bright-red lipstick that has a lustrous finish, traditionally made from beni, a Japanese safflower extract.

Understanding the choices: We have five options - linearity, have to wait for, long wait, anger, and irritation. We need to identify which of these options best represents the feeling James experiences. 3. Process of elimination:  - Linearity: This refers to being in a straight line. It doesn't describe a feeling, so it can be discarded. - Have to wait for: This phrase describes a situation but doesn't convey a feeling. It can be eliminated. - Long wait: This is another situation, not a feeling. It can be ruled out. - Anger: Anger refers to a strong feeling of annoyance, displeasure, or hostility. This could be a possible answer. - Irritation: Irritation refers to a feeling of mild annoyance or discomfort due to an unfavorable situation or circumstance. This also fits the description. 4. Contextual understanding: The prompt says James \\"hated\\" getting in line, but it doesn't mention that he had an extreme reaction like hostility or aggression, which is associated with anger.

Review: This book is a biography of Franz Kafka. Throughout the book we get summaries of Kafka's important works and we get to see Crumb's visual interpretation of these stories. That is the best part of the book for me. The biographical side is also very good, explaining a bit of why Kafka wrote like that.While reading the book, I felt like it is hard to call most of it a comic book, because it has a lot of prose. The parts of the book where we get to see Crumb interpret Kafka's stories definitely feel like a comic book, but the biography section doesn't. However, I thinks this works very well in the book, it makes the stories more alive when the images tell more than just being a drawing.I enjoyed the book, it is worth reading.

Do those questions have the same meaning? Options: A). no B). yes","output":"A) No While both questions ask for differences between Catholicism and another Christian denomination, the religions compared with Catholicism are different. In the first question, the comparison is made with Episcopalianism, while in the second question, it's made with Lutheranism. Therefore, the questions do not have the same meaning. Now, let's discuss the main differences between Catholics and these two denominations. 1. Episcopalians (The Episcopal Church) and Catholics: The Episcopal Church is a part of the Anglican Communion, also known as the Church of England. It was created during the Reformation and is rooted in English Christianity.  a. Authority: The most significant difference between Episcopalians and Catholics comes down to authority. Catholics believe the Pope is the highest authority on earth, while Episcopalians do not recognize papal authority. Episcopalians, rather, rely on the Book of Common Prayer to make important decisions together at general conventions. b. Sacraments: While both Episcopalians and Catholics recognize seven sacraments (Baptism, Eucharist, Confirmation, Penance, Anointing of the Sick, Matrimony, and Holy Orders), their interpretation and practice differ. The Catholic Church has stricter rules surrounding the sacraments. c. Women and Married Clergy: The Episcopal Church allows the ordination of women and married men, which the Roman Catholic Church does not. d. Views on Divorce: Additionally, Episcopalians generally have a more permissive view on divorce and remarriage in the church. 2. Lutherans and Catholics: Lutheranism was born from the Protestant Reformation led by Martin Luther, a German monk.  a. Justification: One of the main distinctions lies in their beliefs about justification, or how people are saved. Catholics believe in justification by faith and works, which means that faith in God and performing good deeds are both necessary for salvation. Conversely, Lutherans believe in justification by faith alone, meaning faith in Jesus is all that's needed for salvation. b. Authority: Like Episcopalians, Lutherans also do not recognize the Pope as an authority figure. The Lutheran Church is democratic, with leaders elected from among the congregation by the congregation. c. Sacraments: Lutherans only recognize two sacraments—baptism and the Eucharist—as they believe these two were explicitly given by Jesus in the Bible. d. Clergy: The Lutheran Church, similar to the Episcopal Church, allows for the ordination of women and married individuals, whereas the Catholic Church permits only unmarried men to become priests. In conclusion, the questions do not have the same meaning as they address differences between Catholicism and two different Christian denominations, both with unique beliefs and practices."},{"instruction":"You should describe the task and explain your answer.

You will be given a task. You must generate a detailed and long answer. Summarize the following: \\" When you sign a mortgage document, there's a promissory note that lenders are supposed to keep that details all the specifics of the loan agreement. During the housing boom, unscrupulous lenders underwrote so many loan documents and filed them away or sold them off, content simply to know they had made money. Now, many of the documents cannot be found, partly because they were sent off when the mortgage was securitized. The short story is this: if the lender cannot find the note, foreclosure can effectively be postponed, if not stopped completely.  Keep in mind that the note should be available to download in your online account. Making the lender \\"produce the note\\" can be effective, especially if the lender used less-than-savory means of getting you to agree to the loan, but it's not a long term strategy for success. You can buy a lot of time if the lender can't produce the note, but in most cases you won't be able to stop foreclosure once the note is found. If you can manage to sell the house before the foreclosure of your home actually clears, you can keep whatever equity you still have invested in the home. It may be hard to sell your home on such a quick turnaround, but it's definitely possible, especially with the market heating up. Read here for more tips on how to sell your home quickly. When a property is about to be foreclosed on, a database attempts to make sure that the ownership of the mortgage — from the time you signed the papers up to the present moment — is clear and unambiguous. This way, the courts can recognize the legality of the foreclosure. Because so many mortgages were bundled into complex securities and traded on the marketplace, the chain of title is often not clear and ambiguous. If you can successfully question the database that keeps track of the chain of title, you may be able to keep your home.  The database that keeps a record of the chain of title is called the Mortgage Electronic Registration System, or MERS. It was established specifically in order to track the chain of title, a tall task given the rate at which many mortgages were being securitized and then traded. But some courts are skeptical of MERS' legitimacy. One popular foreclosure defense rests on forcing the lender to independently verify the chain of title without using MERS.  In order to save your home from foreclosure using the chain of title defense, you're probably going to need a lawyer. This may be a bit more expensive than some of the other options, but it's a defense that's quickly gaining traction. in lieu of foreclosure. If you have few other options, you can always ask the lender's loss mitigation department if they're willing to accept a deed in lieu of foreclosure. This is a document where you legally agree to transfer ownership of the deed over to the lender in exchange for the ability to walk away owing nothing to the lender. If you don't think you'll be able to hold onto your house, this option can be especially attractive if you owe a significant amount on monthly payments in arrears. You may be able to negotiate a cash deal to cover some of your moving expenses. The lender usually provides several thousand dollars for this, so make sure to ask for it if you are returning the deed. Summary:","output":"When signing a mortgage document, a promissory note detailing the loan agreement specifics should be maintained by the lender. However, during the housing boom, some lenders underwrote numerous loan documents and misplaced or sold them. If the lender cannot find the note, foreclosure might be postponed or potentially stopped. However, this isn't a long-term strategy, and foreclosure may still occur if the note is eventually found. Selling the house before foreclosure is an option to retain any remaining equity. Regarding the chain of title, the Mortgage Electronic Registration System (MERS) database is utilized to track ownership of mortgages and confirm the legality of foreclosures. Challenging the legitimacy of MERS in courts is gaining traction as a foreclosure defense. In this case, hiring a lawyer is beneficial to navigate the complexities. Lastly, homeowners can consider a deed in lieu of foreclosure, where they transfer ownership to the lender and walk away debt-free. This option may also include cash deals to cover moving expenses. Overall, multiple strategies exist to combat or mitigate foreclosure, and seeking legal advice is recommended to determine the best course of action."},{"instruction":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

His sister Jenna comes home from college for Halloween, but things turn sour when Dougie finds out she brought her boyfriend, Alex, with her. After a fall out with Jenna, Dougie wanders off and finds a man dressed in a cheap costume arranging a dead body on his lawn as if it were a decoration. Dougie naively believes the man is Satan, and asks him for help in sending Alex to Hell, which \\"Satan\\" nods assent to. In the meantime, Alex comes up with the idea of bonding with Dougie by dressing as Satan for Halloween. When Dougie comes back home, he tries to lure Alex into the basement where Satan is waiting for him, but fails. Dougie ends up changing plans to instead have Alex ambushed by Satan while he and Alex go out shopping for a Satan costume, where Alex ends up being left for dead. Dougie brings Satan home, whom everyone believes to be Alex. Despite Satan becoming forcefully, physically intimate with Jenna and his unwillingness to speak, Jenna interprets these as Alex's devotion to his Satan costume. When Satan and Dougie leave to get Halloween candy, they end up shoplifting a market for candy and tools, where Satan subsequently kills a bagger who tries to stop them and the two engage in a brief physical assault spree with their shopping cart. On the way home, Satan engages in a combination of assaulting and killing several more people, including Alex's estranged dad, before he and Dougie are accosted by the police. Satan indicates to Dougie to run home while he confronts the police, who are later found to be dead.

Given the question: Found the following article online, use it to answer the question: What is the name of that which had become the most commonly used drilling fluid by 2009?  Drilling fluids are necessary for borehole stability in deep cores, and can also be used to circulate cuttings away from the bit.  Fluids used include water, ethanol/water and water/ethylene glycol mixtures, petroleum fuels, non-aromatic hydrocarbons, and n-butyl acetate. Water is the cheapest and cleanest option; it may be present on the glacial surface or may be created by thermal drilling.  In cold ice some form of antifreeze is necessary, or heat must be reapplied by reaming the hole periodically. Ethanol and water.  Ethanol acts as an anti-freeze in water; at sufficient concentrations it can reduce the freezing temperature of the mixture to well below any temperature likely to be encountered in ice drilling.  The concentration must be chosen to prevent the liquid freezing and also to maintain the borehole against the ice overburden pressure.  Because the density of the mixture decreases with lower temperatures, vertical convection will develop in boreholes where temperatures decrease with depth, as the lighter mixture rises.  This causes slush to form in the borehole, though successful drilling is still possible.  Ethanol is one of the cheapest options for a drilling fluid, and requires less storage space than other options because in use it is diluted with water.  A Soviet expedition left an 800 m borehole in Antarctica filled with ethanol and water at an ice temperature of −53 °C; after 11 months the borehole remained open and drilling was resumed with no problems.  A problem with this option is that the mixture will penetrate cores that have cracks. Ethylene glycol and water was used at Camp Century in 1966 in the lower part of the hole to dissolve the cuttings. Petroleum fuels.  This includes diesel, jet fuel, and kerosene. They are inexpensive and easily available, and were once in common use; disadvantages include flammability and the aromatics they contain, which are a health hazard. Non-aromatic hydrocarbons.  As of 2009 these had become the most commonly used drilling fluids; eliminating the... The answer is:","output":"non-aromatic hydrocarbons."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Cesc Fabregas faces Arsenal for the first time since leaving the Emirates this weekend as Chelsea host the Gunners at Stamford Bridge. We asked Arsenal fan site Highbury House just what the supporters feel about a former captain and hero lining up for their bitter rivals against them, especially since he's been playing so well. If you wanted a symbol of the divide among Arsenal supporters at the moment then you will find no better example than Cesc Fabregas. There is an on-going debate, both within the Emirates and on the numerous websites devoted to the club, about Arsene Wenger and his continued tenure and Barcelona’s sale of Fabregas to Chelsea has rubbed salt into those wounds. For many of us, Cesc epitomised the great things Wenger achieved over so many years. He was the lingering ember, still smouldering in Barcelona, that so many Arsenal fans believed could re-ignite Wenger's reign and breathe quality back into a central midfield that had become dull. Cesc Fabregas (right) will line up for Jose Mourinho's high-flying Chelsea against Arsenal this weekend. Fabregas has been the driving force behind Chelsea's improved creativity and goal scoring this season. He never spoke badly of the club, even after forcing the move that hurt so many of us. I could see why he wanted to go at the time, though. Barcelona had exerted a strong pull under Pep Guardiola and it was Cesc's homeland. All the rumours about him refusing to play for us in pre-season and feigning injury were disturbing for sure but fans’ forgiveness tends to be in proportion to the player's quality and nobody could dispute Cesc had that in abundance. After the FA Cup success the word was that Wenger would push the boat out in the summer and sign the players that just about everybody in football knew we needed. So, when it became clear that the golden boy was available and Arsenal had a clause in his contract of sale that gave the club the right of first refusal, at a discount price, then what was the problem? Sign him, Arsene. The problem was that our manager didn't see it that way at all. Arsene Wenger played a key role in shaping Fabregas at Arsenal into the talented player you see today. Fabregas became club captain at Arsenal and is pictured here celebrating a goal with Robin van Persie. After several attempts Fabregas finally left Arsenal to return his boyhood club Barcelona in summer 2011. Now, whether this was for purely footballing reasons in that he didn't want to inhibit the growth of Jack Wilshere and Aaron Ramsey or, as Cesc has said, because of the presence of Mesut Ozil. Or was it a bit of rather ill-judged payback for some shoddy behaviour against the man who had made him the great player he undoubtedly is? But the awful fact of the matter is that Arsenal said no and took a percentage of the transfer fee to, of all clubs, Chelsea. Fabregas is showing the midfield creativity at Chelsea that Arsenal would have benefited from this season. Will Wenger's decision not to resign Fabregas come back to haunt Arsenal at Stamford Bridge this weekend? Those of us who have watched Mourinho's team through gritted teeth this season couldn't have failed to have noticed that he is doing rather well for them. In fact, he puts the opposition under pressure just about every time he gets the ball in their half. Unfortunately for us and in my opinion, Cesc was exactly the player we needed and as Wenger seems to see Ozil as a left-winger I really can't see the sense in not signing him. The sudden drop in Ramsey's form and his subsequent two-month injury, plus the inconsistent nature of Jack's game has made the decision look worse and worse with each passing day. But, not to sign him and at the same time strengthening Sunday¹s opponents, Mourinho¹s Chelsea? Crazy and for some of us, painful too. Follow Highbury House on Twitter @Highbury_House. Summarize the highlights of this article.","output":"Cesc Fabregas, a former Arsenal captain, will face Arsenal for the first time since leaving the club as Chelsea hosts the Gunners at Stamford Bridge.

However, Wenger declined, and now Fabregas has become a driving force in Chelsea's success, causing Arsenal fans to question the decision not to sign him, especially as he could have provided the midfield creativity that Arsenal currently lacks."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

This is only the first of a series of misadventures caused by the drastically dysfunctional Ethan. Peter, now on the No Fly List and missing his wallet, agrees to drive with Ethan to Los Angeles. Ethan stops to buy marijuana, and Peter discovers that he is nearly out of money. Since Peter has no I.D., he gets his wife to wire the money to Ethan, but discovers Ethan had the money wired to his stage name instead of his legal name. When the Western Union employee (Danny McBride) refuses to accept Ethan's \\"Stage name I.D.\\" it leads to a violent altercation. After a night at a rest stop, Peter decides to drive off and leave Ethan there, but realizes that he still has Ethan's father's ashes, having forgotten to unload them with the rest of Ethan's stuff when he left. This causes him to wrestle with his conscience, and he decides to return. Peter gets Ethan to drive so Peter can get some rest, but Ethan falls asleep at the wheel and crashes the car. After Peter and Ethan are picked up by Peter's friend Darryl (Jamie Foxx), Peter again decides to part company with Ethan. Darryl initially persuades him otherwise, but then throws Ethan out after mistakenly drinking Ethan's father's ashes. When Darryl lets them use his Range Rover to make the rest of the trip, Ethan mistakenly drives to the MexicoâUnited States border. Despite assuring Peter that he'll handle the situation, Ethan flees, and Peter is arrested for possession of marijuana.

News article: JACKMAN, Maine (AP) — Leaders in a Maine town say they will meet with their town manager, who has come under fire for espousing white separatist views.      Jackman town manager Tom Kawczynski (kuh-ZIN-skee) recently made public comments bashing Islam and calling for preservation of white European heritage in northern New England.      The Portland Press Herald reports local officials are scheduled to meet with him Tuesday. Town lawyer Warren Shay said Sunday the town manager's beliefs aren't shared by Jackman officials and \\"do not reflect the beliefs of the townspeople in general.\\"      Kawczynski and Jackman town officials didn't return phone calls from The Associated Press.      The Jackman-Moose River Chamber of Commerce president says businesses in the area \\"do not condone\\" Kawczynski's views.      Many social media users are calling for Kawczynski to quit or be fired. ||||| Jackman Town Manager Thomas Kawczynski said Saturday his days as an employee of the small northwestern Maine town are probably numbered after he came under fire Friday for his views on racial separation and anti-Islamic comments. But he said he has no plans to quit his job.      Kawczynski also said he was sorry for any negative impact his views have had on the town and local businesses. He said he was not motivated by hate and denied being a racist.      Related Headlines Maine town manager under fire for promoting white separatism Jackman Town Manager Tom Kawczynski poses in front of his New Albion flag. Photo coutesy Tom Kawczynski      Meanwhile, Jackman selectmen remained silent Saturday about Kawczynski while the Jackman-Moose River Chamber of Commerce Facebook page filled up with public comments about Kawczynski and his New Albion website. The chamber issued a statement Saturday condemning Kawczynski’s comments.      Jackman, population 862, is in Somerset County near the Canadian border. The town bills itself as “a tourist friendly region” on its website.      Kawczynski, who was hired in June, started posting his ideas on his website in November and has regularly posted anti-Islamic and anti-feminist comments on Gab, a social networking service associated with the far right.      Kawczynski said living in northern Maine, where most people are white, allows him to “experience the joys of living in a monoculture.” He said he opposes Islam because it’s “not compatible with Western culture.”      On the New Albion website he wrote, “I believe in all people, living as they choose, in free determination. For the people of New England, our folk are white people of European ancestry and ideas, emphasizing the value of work, communing with nature and a society based upon order. While I am not an absolutist on race understanding, the many complications created by the American system, I do believe to the extent we voluntarily separate, the happier every group will be as they regain self-determination.”      He also attacked feminists on social media.      “It’s no accident unattractive women make up the vast majority of feminists, ” he said on Gab this month. “Their issue is less with the roles men and women play, and more with resentment about the lack of attention they draw from men due to these attributes.”      Kawczynski said in a telephone interview Saturday he had not heard from the selectmen or the town’s lawyer, Warren Shay, since the controversy erupted Friday. When reached by phone Saturday, Shay said he was not immediately ready to speak about the controversy.      The town manager posted comments on Gab Saturday about his doubts that he would remain on the job.      “I’m guessing I should be working on my resume as my public sector career looks likely to draw to a close in one form or another,” he wrote. “Do any gabbers need a smart writer who has plenty of skills to do independent work from home? I plan on writing a book about this all now.”      Kawczynski said Saturday that he planned to fight for his right to free speech and did not intend to resign. He has created a crowd fund on the Hatreon website. Hatreon lacks the hate speech restrictions of other crowd funding websites.      “Funds given to this project will serve to sustain Tom Kawczynski of New Albion during any legal fight about the effort to lose his job due to expressing free speech in support of Western Civilization, positive white identity, and against Islam,” the post on Hatreon said.      Three of the four Jackman selectmen – Jayme French, Charles Lumbert and Scott Smith – did not respond to multiple phone calls and phone messages Saturday, while the fourth, Alan Duplessis, answered his phone to say: “We are working through our attorney. I can’t comment on that. We really appreciate you calling.”      Gary Hall, president of the Jackman-Moose River Chamber of Commerce, issued the following statement Saturday: “We the business community of Jackman, would like to state that we do not condone the current view of Tom Kawczynski. We believe in American values of freedom, diversity and inclusiveness. At this time, we are calling on our selectmen to take appropriate measures and protect our community for which so many have come to know and love. To ensure due process is followed, we ask for your patience as this issue is resolved.”      When Kawczynski’s comments were reported in news stories Friday, critics pounced on his views.      They included the Rev. Christina Sillari of First Parish Church, a Unitarian Universalist church in Portland.      “It’s really awful what he’s doing,” she said.      Kawczynski said Saturday his phone had been ringing continuously with anonymous hate calls.      Kawczynski is a 2003 graduate of Swarthmore College, where he studied British history. He was a courier and legal clerk in Pennsylvania, where he tried to run for Congress. He last worked for a private contractor in New Hampshire. He grew up in Arizona. He said both his parents are deceased and he is the sole provider for his family. He said his wife suffers from Lyme disease.      Kawczynski said New Albion is a reference to New England. Albion is the ancient name for Britain. The flag he designed for the New Albion organization, which features a golden tree and pine cones, is based on the St. Andrew’s Cross, which has its roots in Scotland, and is not based on the Confederate flag, Kawczynski said.

But the truth is, even here in Singapore, security cannot be taken for granted. It is a small nation that has no natural resources to speak of, even something as basic as water is constantly threatened to be cut off by Malaysia. Months after the September 11thattacks on US oil, a plot to bomb American soldiers near their military base in Singapore was uncovered by the local authorities. The United Nations has tried for more than half a century to architect peace for the world. But it has clearly failed. The grand horrors of the World Wars may have stopped but only in the forms they had existed before. When the enemy is unseen and there are no front lines, have we in fact created a more peaceful and secure place? Where have we gone wrong? Perhaps it is because the international body has never understood that peace was, is, and will never be something it can manage. Not recognizing this truth, the methods it provides are often short-lived and some even dangerous. Solutions for threatening situations tend to require the countries to carry out economic and political reforms so that they will become idealized democratic society like America or Britain. The UN fails to consider that hundreds of years of evolution gave rise to these strong democracies. So the result is further chaos and corruption, worse for all. Actually, an international organization or a government cannot possess peace to give away, but there are those who do possess it. Those who own peace are us, as individuals who cherish life, not our own but all others'. The act of achieving peace lies in us when we choose to respect social and cultural differences and appreciate that all our lives are fragile.

What is the answer??","output":"To solve the given equation -23*p + 13*p + 30 = 0 for p, we can follow these steps: Step 1: Combine like terms The equation involves two terms containing p (-23*p and 13*p). We'll combine them to simplify the equation. (-23 * p + 13 * p) = -10 * p So, the simplified equation becomes: -10 * p + 30 = 0 Step 2: Isolate p To solve for p, we need to isolate p in the equation. First, we will move the constant term to the other side of the equation by subtracting 30 from both sides. -10 * p = -30 Step 3: Solve for p Now, we will divide both sides of the equation by the coefficient of p, which is -10, to get the value of p. p = -30 / (-10) Step 4: Simplify Dividing -30 by -10 gives us: p = 3 So, the solution to the equation -23*p + 13*p + 30 = 0 for p is p = 3."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Summarize this article: Similar to starting any business, starting a home decorating business involves creating a solid business plan. Your business plan should include information such as the budget for your business, the type of clients you wish to have, and the medium you will use to reach your clients.  Decide whether you will be a product-driven decorator or will be a consultant who does not sell products. There is room for both types of decorators in the industry. Remember to consider how and from where you will purchase your inventory, and don’t forget to include costs such as insurance and vehicle maintenance. You may need to consult with several specialists for help in this area, as requirements vary by state, county and municipality. Make sure you have the appropriate business license before decorating any homes on commission.  The Department of State can provide you with the business licensing and permit requirements for you to start a business in different states. Keep in mind that these requirements may vary widely based on state. Consult an insurance agent to help you find the proper coverage to protect your personal assets from business liabilities. Talk to a tax professional to learn how to ensure that your company is paying the correct amount of taxes. See an attorney or consult the Department of State (for your state) for guidance in incorporating your company. Startup costs for decorating businesses are often relatively low and you likely won’t need a big budget to begin.Two must-haves are a good computer and reliable transportation that is also in good condition. Your basic startup costs will include the purchase of sample books, business cards, software, and promotional tools (such as brochures or any advertising you might like to do).  You'll likely need to prepare a certain amount of working capital to start your decorating business. Unless you plan to work from a home office, you'll need to pay rent for an office space, electricity and internet access. You may need to pay for parking space for yourself and your future clients. A good business name will be something that is evocative, professional, and memorable. Thinking about choosing a name that is imaginative to show your clients your creative side. However, it's probably best to avoid a name that's too \\"cute\\" or trendy. Your business name should provide insight into the kind of professional work your interior decorating company will provide.  Give your company name a lot of thought. Selecting a business name is one of the most important steps in planning your business. Don’t underestimate the power of your name. Some of the best names for businesses are simply a combination of your name and what you do; for example, “Jake Collins Decorating”. Advertising can follow many different paths. You may want to start spreading word of your business by word of mouth; to do this, you should speak with as many members of your community as possible. Let them know about your business and encourage them to contact you with any potential inquiries.  Make sure you attend any markets or trade shows where people might be going to look for goods for their homes, and discuss your availability as an interior decorator. Once your business is official, you can start advertising in newspapers, on radio, or on television. This is a great way to spread information about your business without depending on word of mouth alone. You will reach a much larger audience this way. A great way to advertise your decorating business is by starting a website. You should fill this website with as many pictures as possible of your home designs and decorations. Other decorators and designers, as well as architects and real estate agents, may be able to offer you referrals. If there is any sort of builders or decorators guild in your area, join it to start connecting with other professionals in your line of work.  Using social media is a great way to network with other professionals, and to promote your business. Keep an active blog so that people can see what you're doing in a day-to-day manner. Using your online presence to promote other people's work encourages them to promote your work as well. Summary:","output":"Starting a home decorating business requires a solid business plan, including information on budget, client types, and marketing strategies. Decide on your role as a product-driven decorator or consultant and consider inventory sources and costs. Consult with specialists for licensing, insurance, tax, and incorporation requirements, as these may vary by location. Startup costs are typically low, with essential expenses being a good computer and reliable transportation. Select a professional and memorable business name, and use multiple advertising channels, such as word of mouth, print, radio, television, and web presence.

What is this text about?","output":"This text is about the transformation and progress of the University of California, Berkeley's (also known as Cal) football program, the Golden Bears, over the years. Geoff McArthur, likely a former or current member of the team, observes that a short walk around the campus in summer is enough to showcase how much the football culture has evolved since his freshman year. The author mentions that the Golden Bears football team had only won a single game in the year 2001, which indicates that the team was struggling significantly during that time. Additionally, the team holds the longest Rose Bowl drought among all the Big Ten and Pac-10 teams, which means they have gone the longest time since participating in the prestigious Rose Bowl game, one of the major college football bowl games traditionally played between the champions of the Big Ten and Pac-10 conferences.  In the past, the school was more recognized for its history of protests and political activism, rather than its prowess on the football field. However, this is changing as the Golden Bears football program is finally getting the attention it deserves. The underlying message is that the team's improvement and success has led to a shift in how the University of California, Berkeley is perceived and now there is a newfound appreciation for football on campus."},{"instruction":"You should describe the task and explain your answer.

This might relieve some discomfort associated with symptoms of crohn's disease, such as bloating and gas. Every individual with crohn's disease will have different needs. OPT: (1). Choose foods high in fiber, vitamins, and minerals for optimal nutrition. Foods that may help with these needs include : Seed and fruit nuts nuts such as almonds and walnuts almonds lentils applesauce, egg yolks, and soy purees tofu Supplement fiber with fruits and vegetables.; (2). You will likely need to go through a trial and error period to find the foods that work best for your child. Try different foods to see how you can best fulfill your child's nutritional needs.; (3). If you've developed symptoms, you probably will not need to consider foods high in fiber for your child to enjoy. Foods rich in fiber include: oats, peas, lentils, cashews, and barley.; (4). Increasing fiber increases this follicle, causing it to tear. High levels of soluble fiber can help reduce bloating and discomfort.; The answer is:","output":"(2). You will likely need to go through a trial and error period to find the foods that work best for your child. Try different foods to see how you can best fulfill your child's nutritional needs. Explanation: (1) is incorrect because people with Crohn's disease might not handle high-fiber foods well. High-fiber foods can make symptoms worse.  (3) is incorrect because it's saying you don't need to consider high-fiber foods but then lists a bunch of high-fiber foods. That's confusing! (4) is incorrect because it talks about increasing fiber, but it's not clear what it means by \\"this follicle.\\" Also, it says increasing fiber can help reduce bloating, but for some people, more fiber can make bloating worse in Crohn's disease. So, we can't be sure.  (2) is the best answer because it says to try different foods and see how your child reacts to them. This is true because every child with Crohn's disease might have different needs and reactions to certain foods."},{"instruction":"Given a definition of a task and a sample input, break the definition into small parts.

Article: There is a popular belief among parents that schools are no longer interested in spelling. No school I have ever taught in has ever ignored spelling or considered it unimportant as a basic skill. There are, however, different ideas about how to teach it, or how much priority   it must be given over general language development and writing ability. The problem is how to encourage a child to express himself freely and confidently in writing without holding him back with the complexities   of spelling. If spelling becomes the only focal   point of his teacher's interest, clearly a bright child will be likely to \\"play safe\\". He will tend to write only words within his spelling range, choosing to avoid adventurous language. That's why teachers often encourage the early use of dictionaries and pay attention to content rather than technical ability. I was once shocked to read on the bottom of a sensitive piece of writing about a personal experience: \\"This work is terrible! There are far too many spelling errors and your writing is terrible.\\" It may have been a sharp criticism of the pupil's technical abilities in writing, but it was also a sad reflection on the teacher who had omitted to read the essay, which contained some beautiful expressions of the child's deep feelings. The teacher was not wrong to draw attention to the errors, but if his priorities had centered on the child's ideas, an expression of his disappointment with the presentation would have given the pupil more motivation   to seek improvement. Question: Teachers encourage the use of dictionaries so that   _  . - students will be able to express their ideas more freely - students will have more confidence in writing - students will have less trouble in correcting mistakes - students will learn to be independent of teachers The answer is:","output":"students will be able to express their ideas more freely"},{"instruction":"You are a teacher.

Input: geve me a solution i didn't ask for a solution i don't have a problem i have no life no gf i feel suicidal Output:","output":"The task is asking you to determine the emotion that is being expressed in a given piece of dialogue. The emotions to choose from are: happy, sad, angry, or other. It is key to examine the language used in the text, consider the context, as well as any explicit emotions mentioned by the speaker. The guidelines provided are not specific, so you'll need to use your judgment and understanding of language and emotions to arrive at the appropriate response. You need to determine whether the person communicating seems to be in a state of happiness, sadness, anger, or another emotional state. Keep in mind that emotions can sometimes be complex, and there may be more than one emotion present in the text. Now let's apply these guidelines to the given input:  \\"geve me a solution i didn't ask for a solution i don't have a problem i have no life no gf i feel suicidal\\" Start by looking at words and phrases that might indicate emotional state. You can see phrases such as \\"i didn't ask for a solution,\\" \\"i have no life,\\" \\"no gf,\\" and especially \\"i feel suicidal.\\" These phrases give us a clear indication that the speaker is not expressing happiness or anger. It is clear that this person is in a state of distress and is expressing a feeling of extreme sadness, possibly even depression, suicidal thoughts further indicate profound distress and emotional turmoil. Hence, the output for this input would be \\"sad.\\"  Remember, interpreting emotions in text can be difficult due to lack of facial cues and tone of voice, it is important to carefully read and interpret the text to determine the underlying emotion.

I taught the kitten the way Pa taught me: I threw him into water where he could not stand, and I watched, ready to grab him if he went under. Tiger did not thrash desperately like me. He merely paddled urgently for the edge of the plastic pool with his head high and his thin legs churning. Little Bit said, \\"Dog paddle,\\" and we all laughed. \\"Tiger paddle,\\" I said, and we all laughed some more, even Jordy. That was probably when Ma noticed the kitten swimming lessons and stopped them. Our swimming lessons happened in two places. When Pa took us, we went to Hawkins Springs behind Mrs. DeLyons' Fountain of Youth Motor Hotel. When Ma took us, we drove to Mermaid Springs State Park, where we would sometimes meet Mr. Drake. I liked Mermaid Springs better because I felt safe there. Ma could not swim, so she never made me jump off a dock into deep water, and she always insisted that I wear an orange styrofoam cylinder on my back like a skindiver or spaceman. Ma usually sat on a towel on the grass near the beach, reading a magazine or a book while tanning her legs. Every now and then she would call to us not to go too far or not to splash each other. When she wore her one-piece red swimming suit, she would come in up to her waist, then lower herself to her shoulders, being careful not to get her hair wet. On the rarest occasions, she would wear a swimming cap and float on her back in the shallow water. Often she stayed in her shorts and shirt, adding sunglasses and removing shoes as her concession to summer and the beach.

Caught out: Radio presenter Burden has hit out over the BBC's move to Salford. Many BBC staff have never made a secret of their disdain for their new northern base. But one presenter has taken the sniping to a new level...by making an on-air joke accusing the Corporation’s neighbours in Salford of being light-fingered. The gaffe came when BBC Five Live breakfast show host Rachel Burden was interviewing Olympic cycling hopeful Laura Trott, who won two gold medals at the Track Cycling World Championships in Melbourne, about her success. But when Miss Trott, 19, joked about accidentally leaving the medals in her car, Miss Burden quipped: ‘What? Around here?’ The suggestion that the car was at risk of being broken into caused fury among radio listeners in Salford, who help to pay 35-year-old Miss Burden’s wages through the licence fee and say the city is being unfairly reviled as a crime hotspot by BBC staff. Edward Reid, a legal worker, said of Tuesday’s interview: ‘It’s time presenters like Rachel kept their prejudices to themselves rather than airing them to listeners. She is employed to do a job, not pass snide remarks about an area which she knows little or next to nothing about. Grow up.’ Joanna Smith, 29, a clerical worker, said: ‘It’s just ignorance really. Salford does have a reputation as a hard city but so has London – they need to get a grip.’ Salford MP Hazel Blears said of Salford Quays, where the BBC is based: ‘I go down there on a regular basis and there’s always a lot of activity. It seems like a safe place to be. In any urban environment you get the odd incident.’ This week it emerged that BBC managers have offered staff in Salford personal security guards to escort them to their cars and tram stops from their studios. However, crime rates for Shepherd’s Bush, home to the BBC’s White City London headquarters, are higher than in Salford, and its figures for violent crime and robbery are way above the national average. Furthermore, recent figures show that although Salford remains slightly above the national average for violence and robbery, crime there has dropped. The BBC’s move to Media City in Salford Quays – where about 1,600 staff are now based, has been riddled with gaffes and controversy, with many presenters refusing to move. BBC Breakfast presenters Sian Williams and Chris Hollins both refused to make the change and have since been replaced. Left behind: Laura Trott, centre, with her gold medal following at the Track Cycling World Championships in Melbourne, Australia. Top Gear presenter Jeremy Clarkson blasted the BBC’s move last year, describing Salford as ‘a small suburb with a Starbucks and a canal with ducks on it’ and said that he would resign if the motoring programme was moved north. Miss Burden, a mother-of-three, last year said she was ‘excited’ by the prospect of a move to the North and a new base in Salford. But she revealed she and her partner would not be selling their four-bedroom London home in Ealing, valued at £650,000. ‘London prices are likely to rise faster than other parts of the country so we want to hold on to it and let it out,’ she said. Double winner: Laura Trott with her Gold Medal after winning the Women's Omnium during day four of the 2012 UCI Track Cycling World Championships in Melbourne, Australia. She added that she was looking forward to settling in an upmarket Cheshire village with good schools and an easy commute to Salford. She said: ‘I was surprised prices in Cheshire aren’t much cheaper for a similar-sized house to our home, although the gardens are larger. It may not be easy to find a home that ticks every box so we are likely to rent first.’ A spokesman for BBC North said: 'During a light-hearted moment at the end of the interview with Laura Trott, an off-the-cuff remark was made. No offence was intended and we’re sorry if anyone was upset.' Burden's remarks follow reports that a number of staff have been warned over their safety following the move to Salford. Corporation chiefs have offered personal security guards to escort men and women to their cars and tram stops from the studios. And an extraordinary email intended to reassure staff about on-site security will serve only to increase fears, with a BBC executive admitting she has been looking at site security ‘following a couple of incidents’. In a move costing an estimated. £1.5billion, the BBC has relocated 2,500 staff across five departments. including Sport, Children’s and Radio 5 Live to the Media City site. BBC Breakfast made its Salford debut. on Tuesday, while Blue Peter and Match of the Day are among the. programmes which air from the futuristic complex. Fears: The BBC's £200m Media City development in Salford. Staff were told that it was a 'different kettle of fish' from West London. Incidents there over the past year include:. The offer of personal security applies. particularly for those working late at night or early in the morning. In a leaked email intended to reassure staff about on-site safety, Rhian. Roberts, head of development for Radio 5 Live and Sports Extra, said. the measures had been tightened after incidents affecting staff. ‘I’ve been looking at on-site security. on 5 Live’s behalf following a couple of incidents – and also the. reality that Media City is a different kettle of fish to W12.’ The BBC’s buildings at White City have. private car parks manned by security and which require a pass to enter,. while the Tube station is yards away. Concerned: Rhian Roberts, left, head of development for BBC Radio 5 live and Sports Extra, said Salford was a 'different kettle of fish' to west London and there has been an offer of personal security for those working late. By contrast, the Salford Quays area. has open access as a number of businesses operate in the area and is. relatively deserted after normal working hours. The site is patrolled by. security guards on foot and on Segway electric two-wheeled vehicles. In the same email, Tony Chebrika, the. head of security for Peel Media Group – which owns and polices the site –. said he could ‘arrange for escorts’ for frightened staff. Mr Chebrika. also reassured staff that the site had 300 CCTV cameras, guards on. constant patrol and a 24-hour control room. In spite of these precautions,. however, a wide range of crimes were reported by BBC employees since. last year including assault, spray-paint damage and thefts. Paul Newman, head of communications. for Peel Media, said that the Salford complex includes more than 50. commercial businesses – including Costa Coffee, Wagamama and Prezzo –. and 378 apartments. He said: ‘From day one our policy has. been to, on request, offer escorts to people who want to get to their. cars or the tram stop, particularly late at night.’ The crime rate has dropped in Salford. in recent years but remains slightly above the national average for. violent crime and robbery. Upping sticks: Bill Turnbull and Susanna Reid present BBC Breakfast, just one of the programmes that has been forced to relocate to the north. Leafy: BBC Television Centre in White City, west London, where staff had previously been based before the move to Salford. Last year a student staying at a hotel in. Salford Quays was shot dead in what police described as an ‘unprovoked. attack’. However, crime rates for the Shepherd’s Bush area around White. City are higher than Salford and its figures for violent crime and. robbery are well above the national average. John Merry, leader of Salford City Council, yesterday pointed out that crime was not unique to the city. ‘This is just scaremongering,’ he. said. ‘It is not unusual for complexes like MediaCityUK to have high. levels of security, whether in Salford, London or any other city.’ BBC Breakfast presenters Susanna Reid. and Bill Turnbull were teased yesterday over their move to Salford. Shaun Ryder, of the Happy Mondays, said: ‘I only live four minutes away. ... great to have you on in the North.’ When Ryder started asking Turnbull. where exactly in Cheshire he would be living, the presenter replied:. ‘Careful’, acknowledging that the travel and residential arrangements of. BBC broadcasters in the North are intended to be kept off screen. Turnbull then joked: ‘All back  to Shaun’s for some breakfast –  he’s closest!’ What are the important parts of this article?","output":"The important parts of this article are: 1. BBC Five Live breakfast show host, Rachel Burden, made an on-air joke suggesting that Salford, the location of the BBC's new northern base, may have higher crime rates. The comment caused outrage among Salford residents who felt their city was being unfairly maligned. 2. Many BBC staff members have expressed disdain over the move to Salford and some, such as BBC Breakfast presenters Sian Williams and Chris Hollins, opted out of relocating. 3. Salford MP Hazel Blears defended the city and the BBC's Salford Quays location, stating that there is a lot of activity in the area and it feels safe. 4. BBC staff in Salford have been offered personal security guards to escort them to their cars and tram stops from their studios, despite the fact that crime rates in Shepherd's Bush, London (the previous location of BBC headquarters) are higher than in Salford. 5.

Answer the above question based on the context below:  It is not clear why, in 1873, Alkan decided to emerge from his self-imposed obscurity to give a series of six Petits Concerts at the Érard piano showrooms. It may have been associated with the developing career of Delaborde, who, returning to Paris in 1867, soon became a concert fixture, including in his recitals many works by his father, and who was at the end of 1872 given the appointment that had escaped Alkan himself, Professor at the Conservatoire. The success of the Petits Concerts led to them becoming an annual event (with occasional interruptions caused by Alkan's health) until 1880 or possibly beyond. The Petits Concerts featured music not only by Alkan but of his favourite composers from Bach onwards, played on both the piano and the pédalier, and occasionally with the participation of another instrumentalist or singer. He was assisted in these concerts by his siblings, and by other musicians including Delaborde, Camille Saint-Saëns, and Auguste Franchomme.Those encountering Alkan at this phase included the young Vincent d'Indy, who recalled Alkan's \\"skinny, hooked fingers\\" playing Bach on an Érard pedal piano: \\"I listened, riveted to the spot by the expressive, crystal-clear playing.\\" Alkan later played Beethoven's Op. 110 sonata, of which d'Indy said: \\"What happened to the great Beethovenian poem ... I couldn't begin to describe – above all in the Arioso and the Fugue, where the melody, penetrating the mystery of Death itself, climbs up to a blaze of light, affected me with an excess of enthusiasm such as I have never experienced since. This was not Liszt—perhaps less perfect, technically—but it had greater intimacy and was more humanly moving ...\\"The biographer of Chopin, Frederick Niecks, sought Alkan for his recollections in 1880 but was sternly denied access by Alkan's concierge – \\"To my ... enquiry when he could be found at home, the reply was a ... decisive 'Never'.\\" However, a few days later he found Alkan at Érard's, and Niecks writes of their meeting that \\"his reception of me was not...

At the end of 1872, he was given the appointment of Professor at the Conservatoire, a position that had eluded Alkan himself.

In the Chinese zodiac, years are represented by twelve different animals, and each animal is associated with a cycle of five elements: Wood, Fire, Earth, Metal, and Water. Each full cycle of the zodiac takes 60 years to complete, as each animal sign combines with each of the five elements, creating a unique combination. The Chinese zodiac cycle begins with the Rat and proceeds in this order: Ox, Tiger, Rabbit, Dragon, Snake, Horse, Goat, Monkey, Rooster, Dog, and Pig. In 1998, the year fell under the Tiger. The combination of Tiger and Earth element creates an Earth Tiger year. Tigers are seen as brave, confident, strong, and independent creatures in Chinese culture. Individuals born in the Year of the Tiger are typically known for their charismatic and dynamic personality. They have a natural ability to lead and inspire others with their captivating presence. Being an Earth Tiger, people born in 1998 are expected to be more grounded, practical, and reliable than other Tiger counterparts. They possess the Tiger's natural courage and enthusiasm but are also responsible and attentive to their surroundings. Some notable individuals born in the Year of the Earth Tiger (1938 and 1998) include: 1. Michael Caine (born March 14, 1938) - A renowned British actor. 2. Natalie Wood (born July 20, 1938) - An American actress who reached fame during the mid-20th century. 3. Shawn Mendes (born August 8, 1998) - A Canadian singer-songwriter known for his hit songs, such as \\"Stitches\\" and \\"Treat You Better.\\" In conclusion, 1998 was the Chinese year of the Earth Tiger, a year that combined the natural strength and charisma of the Tiger with the stability and practicality of the Earth element."},{"instruction":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

The Verve were an English rock band formed in Wigan in 1990 by lead vocalist Richard Ashcroft, guitarist Nick McCabe, bass guitarist Simon Jones and drummer Peter Salisbury. Guitarist and keyboard player Simon Tong later became a member. Beginning with a psychedelic sound with their debut LP The band's physical and mental turmoil continued into the chaotic recording sessions of the band's second album, 1995's A Northern Soul, produced by Owen Morris. The band departed from the experimental psychedelic sounds of A Storm in Heaven and focused more on conventional alternative rock, with Ashcroft's vocals taking a more prominent role in the songs, although reminiscent of some of the early work. Around this period, Oasis guitarist and friend of Ashcroft, Noel Gallagher, dedicated the song \\"Cast No Shadow\\" on the album (What's the Story) Morning Glory? to Ashcroft, and Ashcroft returned the gesture by dedicating the song \\"A Northern Soul\\" to Noel.  The band released the album's first single \\"This Is Music\\" in May, and it reached No. 35, their first single to reach the Top 40. It was followed by \\"On Your Own\\" in June which performed even better, reaching No. 28. This single was particularly new for the Verve as it was a soulful ballad. The album reached the UK Top 20 upon its release in July, but Ashcroft broke up the band three months later, just before the release of the third single \\"History\\", which reached No. 24 in September. Ashcroft later stated: \\"I knew that I had to do it earlier on, but I just wouldn't face it. Once you're not happy in anything, there's no point living in it, is there? But my addiction to playing and writing and being in this band was so great that I wouldn't do anything about it. It felt awful because it could have been the greatest time of our lives, with \\"History\\" doing well, but I still think I can look myself in the mirror in 30 years time and say, 'Yeah man, you did the right thing.' The others had been through the same thing. It was a mixture of sadness and regret, and relief that we would have some time away.\\"  Ashcroft reunited with Jones and Salisbury just a few weeks after the break-up, but McCabe did not rejoin them. The new band hired former Suede guitarist Bernard Butler, but he spent only a couple of days with the band. The band then chose Simon Tong, a school friend credited with originally teaching Ashcroft and Jones to play guitar. The band made no live appearances for all of 1996, apart from a solo performance from Ashcroft supporting Oasis in New York. The rest of the year was spent playing and recording songs for a new album.Answer this question using a quote from the following article: did it have any other music?","output":"Yes, The Verve had other music as well.

Millions of men and women readied themselves for work. Some made their way to the Twin Towers, the signature structures of the World Trade Center complex in New York City. Others went to Arlington, Virginia, to the Pentagon. Across the Potomac River, the United States Congress was back in session. At the other end of Pennsylvania Avenue, people began to line up for a White House tour. In Sarasota, Florida, President George W. Bush went for an early morning run. For those heading to an airport, weather conditions could not have been better for a safe and pleasant journey. Among the travelers were Mohamed Atta and Abdul Aziz al Omari, who arrived at the airport in Portland, Maine. Boston: American 11 and United 175. Atta and Omari boarded a 6:00 A.M. flight from Portland to Boston's Logan International Airport. When he checked in for his flight to Boston, Atta was selected by a computerized prescreening system known as CAPPS (Computer Assisted Passenger Prescreening System), created to identify passengers who should be subject to special security measures. Under security rules in place at the time, the only consequence of Atta's selection by CAPPS was that his checked bags were held off the plane until it was confirmed that he had boarded the aircraft. This did not hinder Atta's plans. Atta and Omari arrived in Boston at 6:45.

Write a title for this article: Grete Waitz, the Norwegian schoolteacher who won more New York City Marathons — nine — than anyone else, and whose humility and athleticism made her a singularly graceful champion and a role model for young runners, especially women, died Tuesday in Oslo. She was 57. Her death was confirmed by Helle Aanesen, the manager of Aktiv Mot Kreft (Active Against Cancer), the foundation Waitz founded in 2007. In 2005, Waitz had received a diagnosis of cancer, though she never publicly revealed what kind. She lived in Oslo, and she and her husband, Jack, also had a home in Gainesville, Fla. In 1991, Runner’s World magazine named Waitz the female runner of the quarter-century, and she was perhaps the pre-eminent female distance runner in history. She twice set the world record at 3,000 meters, and she set world records at distances of 8 kilometers, 10 kilometers, 15 kilometers and 10 miles. But it was in the marathon, the 26.2-mile symbol of human endurance, that Waitz most distinguished herself, setting a world record of 2 hours 32 minutes 30 seconds the first time she ran one, in New York in 1978, and subsequently lowering the world standard three more times. In addition to her New York City victories, Waitz won the London Marathon twice, the Stockholm Marathon once and the world championship marathon in 1983. “She is our sport’s towering legend,” said Mary Wittenberg, the president of the New York Road Runners. “I believe not only in New York, but around the world, marathoning is what it is today because of Grete. She was the first big time female track runner to step up to the marathon and change the whole sport.” Grete Waitz (whose name was pronounced GREH-tuh VITES) was not simply a champion, however; she was also something of a pioneer. At the time of her first New York victory, women’s distance running was a novelty. Just 938 out of 8,937 entrants in the 1978 New York marathon were women — in 2010, 16,253 of 45,350 entrants were — and the women’s marathon would not be added to the Olympics until the 1984 Summer Games in Los Angeles, where Waitz finished second to Joan Benoit Samuelson. “I lost a mentor and a role model,” Samuelson, 53, said Tuesday, a day after running the Boston Marathon in 2:51:29. She decided to run at the last minute, Samuelson said, because, although she had been battling back problems, she was inspired by Waitz’s courage. “What will endure forever is that she was able to balance a competitive career with the most gracious lifestyle, and a character that emanated good will,” Samuelson said. Remarkably, Waitz, a champion track runner, ran her first marathon as a lark, with the encouragement of her husband, who was also her coach, and who told her that a trip to New York would be like a second honeymoon for them. Even in training she had never run more than 13 miles, and the science of the sport was young enough that her dinner the night before the race included shrimp cocktail and filet mignon, hardly the load of carbohydrates that even today’s rankest amateurs know to consume. As she recalled in later interviews, the last 10 miles of the race were agony, and she was so angry at her husband that when she crossed the finish line, she tore off her shoes and flung them at him. “I’ll never do this stupid thing again,” she yelled. She was, however, hooked. The next year, she finished the race in 2:27:33, beating her record by almost five minutes and becoming the first woman to officially run a marathon faster than two and a half hours. Her legendary status was assured. In her home country, her New York victories conferred on her the status of a national hero; a statue of her stands outside Bislett Stadium, an international sports arena in Oslo, and her likeness appeared on a Norwegian postage stamp. She established a 5-kilometer race in Oslo that eventually expanded to 40,000 runners, and in 2007, she started her foundation, which sponsors runners in major races and supports cancer hospitals and patient centers.

What is the answer: What is the name of the Irish whiskey illicitly made from barley?","output":"The name of the Irish whiskey illicitly made from barley is \\"Poitín\\" (pronounced as \\"potcheen\\" or \\"poteen\\"). Poitín has a long, rich history deeply rooted in Irish tradition and culture. Dating back to the 6th century, Poitín is one of the oldest distilled beverages in the world, often regarded as the predecessor of modern Irish whiskey. Its name is derived from the Irish word \\"pota,\\" which means \\"pot.\\" This is a reference to the small copper pot stills that were historically used in the distillation process. Poitín was typically produced in rural homes and hidden away in remote areas to evade the watchful eye of the British authorities who sought to control and heavily tax the production and sale of whiskey in Ireland. The primary ingredient for Poitín is malted barley, but it can also be made using other grains, sugar beets, or potatoes. The fermentation process uses a mixture of these ingredients along with water and yeast. After several days of fermentation, the liquid, known as \\"wash,\\" is ready for distillation. The wash is heated until it reaches the boiling point of ethanol, allowing the vapor to be collected and condensed back into liquid form. This process is often repeated multiple times to increase the alcohol concentration. Despite its illicit nature, Poitín became a fundamental part of Irish culture and society. It was often used to mark special occasions like weddings, funerals, and harvest celebrations and played a significant role in the bonding of communities. Poitín was also used for medicinal purposes and as a form of currency in economic transactions. The Irish government criminalized the production of Poitín in 1661, marking the beginning of its association with the term illicit. However, this ban did little to quash its production or its popularity. Covert distillers, known as \\"moonshiners,\\" continued to produce Poitín in well-hidden locations in the Irish countryside, using traditional recipes that have been passed down through generations. In the late 20th century, the Irish government began to acknowledge the historical and cultural importance of Poitín, and in 1997, it was granted a Geographical Indicative Status by the European Union. This means that Poitín is now recognized as a product unique to Ireland, much like Champagne is to France. In the same year, a legal version of Poitín was launched, the production of which adheres to strict guidelines set by the Irish government. Today, multiple brands produce legal Poitín, which can be found in a variety of establishments, both in Ireland and across the globe. However, the illicit and mystical charm of traditional Poitín continues to capture the imagination of many, and its clandestine production remains a strong representation of Ireland's enduring spirit and resilience."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Here is a detailed explanation: Premise: A man wearing a hat with blond dreadlocks holds juggling pins under a blue sky. In the premise, we are given the following pieces of information: 1. The man's appearance: He is wearing a hat and has blond dreadlocks. 2. The man's belongings: He is holding juggling pins. 3. The setting: It occurs under a blue sky. Now, let's analyze the hypothesis: Hypothesis: An aspiring juggler is learning to juggle pins. The hypothesis offers more contextual information: 1. The man's goal or profession: He is an aspiring juggler, possibly looking to gain skill or experience in juggling. 2. The activity being undertaken: The man is learning to juggle using pins, which are a common object to juggle. The premise and the hypothesis are correlated through the mention of juggling pins. However, the distinction lies in their wording, in which the premise suggests that the man is merely holding the pins, while the hypothesis goes a step further and states that he is learning to juggle them. Although the presence of juggling pins implies that the man might be an aspiring juggler or at least interested in juggling, we cannot definitively conclude the hypothesis based on the given premise alone. Additional information, such as observing the man actually practicing juggling or the man's own confirmation of his aspirations, would be needed to confirm the hypothesis definitively. In summary, while there is a correlation between the premise and the hypothesis, we cannot conclude that the hypothesis is entirely true based on the premise.

Write an article that answers the following question: Which was smaller, households with one or more children under 18 or households with someone over 65?","output":"Title: Comparing Households: One or More Children Under 18 vs. Households with Someone Over 65 Introduction At the crossroads of demography and family life, an essential aspect of understanding the dynamics of society lies in the composition of households. In this article, we will examine and compare two types of households in terms of size - those with one or more children under 18, and those with someone over 65. The comparison will provide insights into the living arrangements and socio-economic trends of different age groups. Statistical Data Overview Before diving into the analysis, it is essential to gain a comprehensive understanding of household composition. Households can be defined as a group of individuals residing together under one roof, sharing fundamental resources such as food, housing, and financial assets. Historically, households have evolved from large, extended families to smaller units, usually containing a nuclear family with two adults and a few children. More recently, households have diversified even further, encompassing various living arrangements, such as single-parent families, cohabiting couples, and adult children living with parents. Households with One or More Children Under 18 Families with children form a significant part of the population in most countries. In the United States, according to the 2019 American Community Survey, the number of such households amounted to approximately 33.3 million. These households typically include married couples with children, single-parent families, and cohabiting couples. Households with children often reflect the dynamics of childcare, education, and other social services. Additionally, they are vital in identifying trends in family size, childbirth, and child-rearing practices. Households with Someone Over 65 With the increasing global longevity and aging population, households with seniors over 65 years of age have become increasingly common. In the United States alone, the number of households with someone over 65 was over 31.4 million in 2019, as per the American Community Survey. Such households include seniors living independently, with a spouse or partner, or with other family members or caregivers. Notably, this type of household carries considerable importance when considering healthcare services, social security expenditures, geriatric facilities, and retirement policies. Comparing Household Sizes Having laid out the statistical background, we can now compare the sizes of households with one or more children under 18 and households with someone over 65. Given that there were approximately 33.3 million households with children under 18 and 31.4 million households with someone over 65 in the United States in 2019, households with one or more children under 18 appear more common. This prevalence of households with children under 18 may be influenced by several factors. First, these families reflect the past few decades' birth rates that increased the overall population growth. Moreover, cultural norms, such as marriage and having children, still play a significant role in family formation and sustainability. Finally, there has been a noticeable trend of adult children residing with their parents longer due to economic factors, further adding to this cohort's number. On the other hand, a relatively smaller number of households with someone over 65 can be attributed to the later stages of life, often accompanied by a decrease in life expectancy and an increase in the mortality rate among seniors. However, these numbers have been growing steadily as the global population sees a rise in the overall aging population. As such, the number of households with someone over 65 is expected to increase in the coming years. Conclusion In conclusion, households with one or more children under 18 are more common than households with someone over 65 in terms of size. This difference is attributed to the dynamics of population growth, family formation, and social and economic factors. As the population continues to age and family structures evolve further, it is crucial to understand and cater to the diverse needs and living arrangements of different households. By doing so, we can ensure a more sustainable, inclusive, and efficient provisioning of services and resources for all members of society."},{"instruction":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

Think like you are answering to a five year old. Write some highlights for the following article: Last week, we gave you digital tips and tricks for surviving a layoff -- the first seven days, at least. Now, here we are again, an entire Wednesday later, prepared to help you gird your loins for the job search ahead. So, wipe the Cheeto dust from your fingers and peel yourself out of that body-shaped imprint you've made on your bed. Your bout in the ranks of the unemployed probably won't be short -- on average, unemployed workers have been jobless for 40 weeks, a number that hasn't changed much in the last six months. But of course, you should aim to make it as brief as possible. \\"The longer you're laid off, the harder it is to get back in the market,\\" says Nicole Williams, LinkedIn's connection director. Act fast to get the ball rolling before you forget what it feels like to wear real pants and chit-chat over a box of donuts (with other people, that is). One positive note: The whole ordeal might not be as miserable as you think (\\"funemployment,\\" anyone?). Last year, an Australian study found that unemployed folks were actually happier than the drones stuck in miserable jobs. Maybe this'll be the best thing that ever happened to you. (Cheerleader jump! Cheerleader jump! Rah! Rah!) Read on for a few social network to-dos to get you back in the rat race. Target your pleas. Last week we covered strategically letting your circles know about the change in employment status (in short: Be brief, be upbeat, and only tell those who could specifically help you). A similar principle is at play as you're seeking out potential business contacts to bug. \\"A mistake a lot of people make is just contacting everyone they can find with a generic note,\\" Williams says. A better approach: Figure out something (or someone) you have in common with the individual, and send a personalized note along with your Facebook/Twitter/LinkedIn request. \\"You have to get them to be interested in your situation,\\" she adds, \\"because people are busy, and why should they worry about your career?\\" Stalk potential employers. Not literally, of course. But when job-searching online, most people tend to think about job boards such as Monster.com and Craigslist.com. While there's nothing wrong with keeping an eye out for appropriate openings (and plenty of people indeed find new gigs on such sites), massive job listings are often a slang word that rhymes with \\"duster-duck\\" -- meaning they're disorganized, crowded and teeming with humanity. Sometimes a job will be posted days after the hiring managers have made a decision, when corporate policy requires it. Months-old listings will mysteriously float to the top long after they've been filled. And in the journalism world, for example, a listing on industry tracker MediaBistro.com can yield hundreds of enthusiastic applications. Go ahead and wade in the morass of job aggregators, but we recommend taking a more targeted approach in the meantime. Brainstorm some corporations that should be dying to hire you, and figure out how you can keep dibs on them. \\"That way you'll be privy to any movement in jobs or anything they're doing industry-wise,\\" Williams says. If the company's striking out on a new project that matches your skills, you have an in to request an informational interview with a higher-up over there, for example. And if you note that someone with your dream job just departed for Company X, you can swoop in. Poke around their website for an RSS feed of company news and add it to your own feed reader (such as Google Reader) for easy stalk-age. Follow the company on LinkedIn (go to the company tab along the top, search, and follow) to see who's leaving (and who will, presumably, leave behind a vacancy), and what current employees are in your circle -- they're your goldmines in the \\"Whom do I address this cover letter to?\\" game. Downplay the layoff in your job apps. Here's the thing: If you're the right candidate, then you're the right candidate -- whether you're currently at another company or currently signing up for market research focus groups to pay the bills between rounds of job-searching. While there's no shame in having been let go (at this point, we all know upstanding employees who fell victim to the economy), your cover letter should shimmer with hireability, not with the grayish Braille of woe-is-me teardrops. Think of it this way: If you come across as defensive, insecure or bitter about the layoff, you'll raise all sorts of red flags in a hiring manager's mind. But if you're bursting with confidence and talent and good ideas (and, oh yeah, it comes up in the interview that you're looking for a new job because you don't have one but the job termination was circumstantial and, hey, here's a recommendation letter from your former boss), you seem like the kind of employee who always lands on his feet. And in this earthquake of an economy, a little catlike agility is a very good thing. Highlights:","output":"1.

Given the following context:  Throughout the early years of the July Monarchy, Alkan continued to teach and play at public concerts and in eminent social circles. He became a friend of many who were active in the world of the arts in Paris, including Franz Liszt (who had been based there since 1827), George Sand, and Victor Hugo. It is not clear exactly when he first met Frédéric Chopin, who arrived in Paris in September 1831. In 1832 Alkan took the solo role in his first Concerto da camera for piano and strings at the Conservatoire. In the same year, aged 19, he was elected to the influential Société Académique des Enfants d'Apollon (Society of the Children of Apollo), whose members included Luigi Cherubini, Fromental Halévy, the conductor François Habeneck, and Liszt, who had been elected in 1824 at the age of twelve. Between 1833 and 1836 Alkan participated at many of the Society's concerts. Alkan twice competed unsuccessfully for the Prix de Rome, in 1832 and again in 1834; the cantatas which he wrote for the competition, Hermann et Ketty and L'Entrée en loge, have remained unpublished and unperformed.In 1834 Alkan began his friendship with the Spanish musician Santiago Masarnau, which was to result in an extended and often intimate correspondence which only came to light in 2009. Like virtually all of Alkan's correspondence, this exchange is now one-sided; all of his papers (including his manuscripts and his extensive library) were either destroyed by Alkan himself, as is clear from his will, or became lost after his death. Later in 1834 Alkan made a visit to England, where he gave recitals and where the second Concerto da camera was performed in Bath by its dedicatee Henry Ibbot Field; it was published in London together with some solo piano pieces. A letter to Masarnau and a notice in a French journal that Alkan played in London with Moscheles and Cramer, indicate that he returned to England in 1835. Later that year, Alkan, having found a place of retreat at Piscop outside Paris, completed his first truly original works for solo...  answer the following question:  Who returned to England in 1835?

Answer the questions at the end based on the text. Native Hawaiians (Hawaiian: \\"kānaka ʻōiwi\\", \\"kānaka maoli\\", and \\"Hawaiʻi maoli\\") are the indigenous Polynesian people of the Hawaiian Islands or their descendants. Native Hawaiians trace their ancestry back to the original Polynesian settlers of Hawaii.  According to the U.S. Census Bureau report for 2000, there are 401,000 people who identified themselves as being \\"Native Hawaiian\\" alone or in combination with one or more other races or Pacific Islander groups. 141,000 people identified themselves as being \\"Native Hawaiian\\" alone.  The majority of Native Hawaiians reside in the state of Hawaii (two-thirds), and the rest are scattered among other states, especially in the American Southwest, and with a high concentration in California.  The history of Native Hawaiians, like the history of Hawaii, is commonly classified into four major periods:  One hypothesis is that the first Polynesians arrived in Hawaii in the 4th century from the Marquesas, and were followed by Tahitians in AD 1300, who then conquered the original inhabitants. Another is that a single, extended period of settlement populated the islands. Evidence for a Tahitian conquest of the islands include the legends of Hawaiiloa and the navigator-priest Paao, who is said to have made a voyage between Hawaii and the island of \\"Kahiki\\" (Tahiti) and introduced many customs.

Hampshire (, ; abbreviated Hants) is a county on the southern coast of England in the United Kingdom. The county town of Hampshire is Winchester, the former capital city of England. Hampshire is the most populous ceremonial county in the United Kingdom (excluding the metropolitan counties) with almost half of the county's population living within the South Hampshire conurbation which includes the cities of Southampton and Portsmouth. The larger South Hampshire metropolitan area has a population of 1,547,000. Hampshire is notable for housing the birthplaces of the Royal Navy, British Army, and Royal Air Force. It is bordered by Dorset to the west, Wiltshire to the north-west, Berkshire to the north, Surrey to the north-east, and West Sussex to the east. The southern boundary is the coastline of the English Channel and the Solent, facing the Isle of Wight.  Hampshire is the largest county in South East England and remains the third largest shire county in the United Kingdom despite losing more land than any other English county in all contemporary boundary changes. At its greatest size in 1890, Hampshire was the fifth-largest county in England. It now has an overall area of , and measures about east–west and north–south.  Hampshire's tourist attractions include many seaside resorts and two national parks: the New Forest and the South Downs (together covering some 45% of the county).

You will be given a task. You must generate a detailed and long answer. Do these questions have the same meaning? How can I repair a corrupt file? How can I repair a corrupted file?","output":"Yes, these two questions have the same meaning as they both refer to the process of fixing a file that has been damaged or altered in a way that affects its usability. In both questions, \\"corrupt\\" and \\"corrupted\\" imply that the file's original content has been compromised and cannot be accessed normally. The goal of the user likely is to restore the file (if possible) so that it can be used again.  To provide a detailed answer to this question, let's look at various steps you can take to repair a corrupt or corrupted file: 1. Identify the file type: Before attempting to repair the file, it's essential to know its type, such as a text document, image file, or video file. Each file type may require a different method to fix corruption. 2. Use backup copies: If you have a backup of the file which was created before the corruption occurred, you can simply replace the corrupt file with the backup version. 3. Repair via built-in tools: Some software applications, such as Microsoft Office, have built-in features that can help diagnose and repair corrupted files. Look for the 'Open and Repair' or similar options in the application's menu. 4. Use third-party repair tools: There are many specialized tools available for different file types (e.g., Word, Excel, PDF, JPEG, etc.). These tools can be either free or paid and can be found with a simple Google search. Some examples include Stellar Repair for Word, Kernel for Excel, and SysInfoTools PDF Repair. 5. Convert the file: You can try converting the file to another format or an updated version. For example, if you have a corrupted Word document, you can try converting it to a different format like RTF (Rich Text Format) or opening it in another Word-compatible software such as Google Docs, and then save it back in the original format. 6. Open file in a different software: Sometimes, corrupt files can still be accessed with other software programs that are similar in function. For example, if you have a damaged video file, you can try opening it in a different media player like VLC Media Player. 7. Use a hexadecimal editor: Hexadecimal editors, also known as hex editors, can be used to examine and modify the binary data of a file manually. However, using a hex editor requires advanced knowledge of file formats and is not recommended for inexperienced users. 8. Seek professional help: If the file holds critical information, consider hiring a data recovery professional to repair the file. Although this may be more expensive, professionals have more extensive experience, knowledge, and tools to retrieve and repair corrupt files. Please note that the success of repairing a corrupt or corrupted file depends on the severity of the damage, and in some instances, it may not be possible to recover or repair the file. In such cases, it's crucial to learn from the experience and implement a reliable data backup and protection strategy to minimize the risk of data loss in the future. Regularly backing up important files, using antivirus software, and safely disconnecting storage devices will help prevent file corruption."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

She removed any unnecessary obstacles, ensuring a straight path to the designated corner. Additionally, Jan placed several thick blankets on the floor to protect both the desk and the hardwood floor from potential damage during the moving process. Once Mark arrived, both Jan and Mark put on gloves to protect their hands and proceeded to inspect the desk for the best points where they could exert force without risking injury or damage to the desk. Finding the most suitable points on the sides of the desk, they each bent their knees and kept their backs straight while lifting it off the ground. Jan and Mark communicated throughout the entire process, making sure to move in unison and in a slow, controlled manner. Their careful approach paid off, as they successfully avoided any scratches, dents, or other damages to the desk or floor. After reaching the designated corner, both Jan and Mark gently lowered the desk into its new spot. They took a moment to appreciate their hard work and shared a sense of camaraderie from having accomplished this challenging task together. Jan then spent some time arranging her office supplies on the desk’s smooth surface, feeling a sense of satisfaction and motivation with her newly reorganized workspace. Once everything was neatly arranged and in place, Jan thanked Mark for his help and they shared a well-deserved break, enjoying a cup of coffee together as they marveled at how the desk looked in its newly appointed corner. Jan knew she couldn't have moved the desk without Mark's help, and she was grateful for his friendship and willingness to lend a hand. In conclusion, with the help of her friend Mark, Jan was able to successfully move the desk into the corner of the family room. The newly reorganized workspace not only served as a functional area for Jan and her children, but also preserved the sentimental value of the antique desk while breathing new life into the family room. The experience, though challenging, ultimately strengthened the bond between Jan and Mark and reminded them of the importance of teamwork and friendship."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Think like you are answering to a five year old. What is a one-sentence summary of the following article? This type of organizational system is best for people who tend to categorize events chronologically in their minds, though it really just boils down to a matter of preference. To organize your personnel files chronologically, you’ll create a separate file for each employee. Within that employee file, you will include all of the pertinent documents in chronological order. For example, one employee’s file might begin with a completed job application, résumé/CV, and W-4, then add newer documents behind – like annual performance evaluations. This type of organizational system is best for people who tend to look at the bigger picture more, though personal preference is the main determining factor. For this type of organization, you’ll need to group files by document type, keeping all similar files together for every employee. For example, you could have one file that contains all of the employee drug tests, another one for all employee performance evaluations, and yet another for necessary medical records. Within each document type grouping, you should organize the files alphabetically to make it easier to find each employee’s forms as needed. Most governments have laws in place related to what documents a company is required to keep for each employee. Make sure you check with local and national laws to ensure that you’re maintaining your personnel files according to their requirements.  Your personnel files should include all information related to the hiring/application process and the relationship between the employee and the company. This includes documents related to performance evaluations, employee commendations, and even disciplinary measures taken. Most laws require businesses to maintain documentation (even after an employee has been terminated) for at least 3 years, though it’s recommended to keep them for a minimum of 5 years to cover your bases in case an unforeseen issue arises. While it’s important to organize and maintain your original documents, it’s also a good idea to make electronic copies of those documents. This could come in handy in case anything happens to the hard copies – lost, damaged, destroyed, etc. Remember to continuously back up your electronic copies to make sure your safety net is up-to-date.

Archaeologist: \\"I don't know how to do it today without mechanical equipment\\" The wall appears to have been used to defend path that led to spring. Wall is believed to have been built by Canaanites.","output":"Title: Unearthing a 3,700-year-old Architectural Marvel: The Mysterious Canaanite Wall Introduction A team of archaeologists have recently uncovered a massive and ancient wall thought to have been constructed around 3,700 years ago. The wall, which is made of boulders weighing between 4 to 5 tons each, stands at a staggering height of 26 feet. This architectural marvel not only highlights the ingenuity and resourcefulness of the ancient people who built it, but also elicits deep-seated questions about the techniques and tools they may have employed. A Herculean Task One of the most striking aspects of the wall's construction is the sheer size and weight of the boulders used to build it. According to the archaeologists, each individual boulder weighs between 4 to 5 tons. Such a feat leaves both experts and laypeople alike to wonder how the ancient inhabitants of the region were able to transport and assemble these colossal stones. As one of the archaeologists on the project put it best, \\"I don't know how to do it today without mechanical equipment.\\" The wall's existence is a testament to its builders' determination, patience, and creativity. Defensive Architecture The wall appears to have been strategically positioned to defend a path leading to a spring. The architects behind this monumental feat were probably well aware of the importance of securing access to essential resources, such as water. Springs were crucial for supporting human civilization, and by creating a defensive barrier, the wall efﬁciently protected this vital resource while guaranteeing control over it. A Canaanite Edifice The wall is believed to have been built by the Canaanites, a group of people who resided in the area of modern-day Israel, Palestine, Lebanon, and parts of Syria and Jordan during this period. The Canaanites were home to a diverse range of cultures and backgrounds, and many biblical historians link them to some of the oldest accounts mentioned in the Bible. This ﬁnding, therefore, serves as a window into the lives and capabilities of an ancient and enigmatic society. Implications and Future Research The discovery of this 3,700-year-old Canaanite wall presents a unique opportunity for historians, archaeologists, and researchers in the ﬁeld of ancient architecture. The incredible ingenuity required to build such a structure using rudimentary tools and methods provides insight into the skills and techniques of the people. In addition, the defensive purpose of the wall sheds light on the social and political climate of the time, revealing important information about the priorities and concerns of those who resided in the region. Continued studies of the wall, as well as similar ancient structures, can broaden our understanding of the development of technology, architecture, and societal organization across various epochs of human history. Conclusion The wall, constructed from massive 4 to 5-ton boulders and reaching a height of 26 feet, stands as a testament to the ingenuity of the ancient Canaanites and their advanced architectural prowess. The defensive nature of the wall highlights the importance of securing valuable resources, such as water, while also giving us a glimpse into their society and culture 3,700 years ago. As research and exploration continue, this fascinating discovery will undoubtedly provide valuable insights into the lives and capabilities of those who came before us."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant. You will be given a task. You must generate a detailed and long answer. Summarize this article: As discussed earlier, sit in team formation and designate a dealer. Grab your Euchre deck and have the dealer give each player 5 cards and assemble the kitty. Starting to the person left of the dealer, rotating clockwise, ask each player whether or not he wishes to declare the suit that is showing as trump until someone does (or a new cycle begins).  If he does wish to declare this suit trump, he says \\"pick it up.\\" If he does not want to declare this suit trump, he says \\"pass,\\" or declares a pass by knocking on the table. He/She then discards one of their other cards (usually a low card of the non-trump suit). If a rotation of the circle is completed without anyone telling the dealer to \\"pick it up,\\" the card is turned face down and another rotation ensues. During this rotation, a player can call trump of any suit other than the one that was originally turned up. If the rotation completes without anyone calling trump, the deal is forfeited and passed clockwise to the next person in the circle. It's generally wise to only call a trump suit if you have a good hand. Otherwise, stay mum. Each player must follow suit -- meaning if a player has a card of the same suit as was led, he must play it on that trick. If a player does not have a card of that suit, he can trump the trick, or simply throw a card off suit. The highest card of the suit that was led takes the trick, unless a trump card is played. The highest card of trump will win any hand. If you lay a card that does not follow suit but you do have a card that does, this is called a \\"renege.\\" If another player calls you out on what you've done, they receive 2 points. If you are going alone, however, the penalty is 4 points (for whichever side is guilty). Because each game of Euchre is so short, it's a little easier to memorize the cards. Think about what cards you believe your opponents are holding to determine how to lead off and what to throw away. For example, if the dealer adds the original trump card to his hand, don't forget it.  If you are leading and have two or more trump cards, go with those. Always lead a high trump if your partner called it; it'll help them locate the missing cards. Otherwise, work in a sequence. Say diamonds are trump -- lead with the Ace of Spades or Clubs to try to win it. Don't hold onto your good cards. Euchre goes fast -- if you act slowly, you'll miss your opportunity to use them. When opportunity knocks, answer the door. \\" Once one team gets to 9 points, this means they are \\"in the barn.\\" You must announce this with great enthusiasm, since it typically indicates that you are about to win the game. If you really want to have fun with it, have one partner interlock their fingers together, and flip upside down with the thumbs making \\"udders\\" and let the other partner \\"milk\\" them. The five tricks of Euchre can go by pretty fast, so it's best to keep score as you go. Use the 6 and 4 cards to keep tabs. Once a team reaches ten, you'll probably want to play again. Switch teams if skill sets are better suited in different combinations. Summary:","output":"This article explains the rules of the card game Euchre: players sit in teams and a dealer is designated, who gives each player five cards and assembles the kitty. The players declare the trump suit in clockwise order, starting from the dealer's left. If no one declares a trump suit after a full rotation, the dealer flips the top card face down and another rotation begins. Players must follow suit when playing a card, but if they don't have a matching card, they can use a trump card or play off-suit. The highest card of the trump suit or the led suit wins the trick. Reneging is penalized with points deductions. In Euchre, card memorization is essential. Leading with multiple trump cards is a good strategy and leading a high trump when your partner called it is helpful in locating missing cards. Since Euchre is quick-paced, acting fast and using your good cards is vital. Teams announce when they reach nine points (also known as \\"in the barn\\"), and the game continues until a team reaches ten points. Scorekeeping is important, and switching teams for better skill sets is recommended for subsequent games."},{"instruction":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

Are questions 1 and 2 asking the same thing?","output":"To answer these questions, I will first provide definitions of the key terms and then compare and contrast them.  1. Irony: Irony refers to a situation, event, or outcome in which there is a significant difference or disconnect between what is expected and what actually happens. It is often used in literature, speech, or humor to create a surprising or interesting effect. 2. Contradiction: A contradiction occurs when two or more statements are opposed to one another, making it impossible for both to be simultaneously true. It can happen in logical statements, arguments, or claims. 3. Paradox: A paradox is a statement or situation that seems to be self-contradictory or absurd, yet may contain a hidden truth or valid reasoning. Paradoxes often challenge our understanding of logic or force us to think more deeply about a subject. Now, I will answer each question. Question 1: The difference between irony, contradiction, and paradox lies in their nature. Irony pertains to the discrepancy between expected and actual outcomes, while contradiction involves the opposition of two statements or claims. Finally, a paradox is a seemingly self-contradictory or absurd statement that may have an underlying truth. Question 2: A paradox contains statements or elements that seem to contradict each other but might reveal a hidden truth upon closer examination. It provokes thought and often offers a new perspective on a topic. Conversely, a logical contradiction shows the clear opposition of two statements or premises in a logical argument, which makes the overall argument invalid.  Comparison of questions 1 and 2: Although there is some overlap in the subject matter of both questions, they are not the same question. Question 1 addresses differences among irony, contradiction, and paradox due to their nature, while Question 2 focuses on the specific difference between paradox and logical contradiction."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Heat from the soup was transferred to the spoon: This option seems the most plausible, as the soup was heated on the stove, making it hot. When the metal spoon was immersed in the hot soup, the heat from the soup transferred to the spoon due to the metal's conductivity. 4. The student's hand transferred heat to the spoon: The student's hand would not be warm enough to heat the metal spoon significantly; the hand would also quickly feel uncomfortable if it were to transfer that much heat.

Q:Write a multi-choice question for the following article: Article: We live in a sweet world. The average American kid consumes more than 20 teaspoons of sugar per day, and adults eat 50% more sugar today than they did in the 1970s. We all know that too much sugar isn't good for you. But did we know it could be dangerous? A team of researchers at the University of Utah used mice to conduct a study on the negative effects of sugar. They found it could have serious effects on people's health. Sugar is found not only in sweets and candies, but also in many household items like pasta and crackers. During the 58-week-long study, mice were fed a diet containing 25% more sugar. This percentage equals a healthy human diet along with three cans of soda daily. The team found that these mice were twice as likely to die as mice fed a similar diet without the sugar. Though the mice did not show signs of obesity or high blood pressure, male mice were 26% less territorial and produced 25% fewer offspring than the other mice. Scientists often use mice for research because they have a similar genetic  structure to humans. \\"Since most substances that are dangerous in mice are also dangerous in people, it's likely that those physical problems that cause those mice to have increased deaths also work in people,\\" says study author James Ruff of the University of Utah. Findings from this study reveal negative effects that are not as noticeable as weight gain or heart problems. Sugar can contribute to long-term changes in the body that can change development and even shorten lives. Cutting sugar out of the American diet altogether may be difficult. But making the effort to control our nation's sugar desire will provide for a truly sweeter future. A:","output":"Which of the following statements accurately describes the findings of the University of Utah study on the negative effects of sugar? A) Mice fed a diet with 25% more sugar showed signs of obesity and high blood pressure. B) Mice fed a diet with 25% more sugar had similar territorial behavior as mice fed a similar diet without sugar. C) The study focused on weight gain and heart problems as the key negative effects of sugar consumption. D) Mice fed a diet with 25% more sugar were twice as likely to die and male mice experienced decreased territorial behavior and produced fewer offspring.  Answer: D) Mice fed a diet with 25% more sugar were twice as likely to die and male mice experienced decreased territorial behavior and produced fewer offspring."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Context: The Georgian-Armenian War was a short border dispute fought in December 1918 between the newly-independent Democratic Republic of Georgia and the First Republic of Armenia, largely over the control of former districts of Tiflis Governorate, in Borchaly  and Akhalkalaki. In March 1918, Russia signed the Treaty of Brest-Litovsk and in doing so agreed to return to the Ottoman Empire territory gained during the 1877-78 Russo-Turkish War. These territories were, however, no longer under the functional control of the Russian central government; rather, they were being administered collectively by the Georgians, Armenians and Azerbaijanis through the Transcaucasian Sejm. The Trebizond Peace Conference aimed to resolve the dispute, but when the conference failed to produce a resolution, the Ottomans pursued a military campaign to control the disputed territories. Under persistent attack, the Transcaucasian collective eventually dissolved with the Georgians, Armenians and Azerbaijanis declaring independent nation states in quick succession in late-May 1918. On 4 June, the Ottoman Empire signed the Treaty of Batum with each of the three Transcaucasian states, which brought the conflict to an end and awarded the southern half of the ethnically-Armenian Lori Province and Akhalkalaki district to the Ottomans. Against the wishes of Armenia, Georgia, supported by German officers, took possession of northern Lori and established military outposts along the Dzoraget River. When the Ottomans signed the Armistice of Mudros in October, they were subsequently required to withdraw from the region. Armenia quickly took control of territory previously controlled by the Ottomans, and skirmishes between Armenia and Georgia arose starting on 18 October. Open warfare began in early December, after diplomatic efforts failed to resolve the issue of the disputed border, and continued until 31 December, when a British-brokered ceasefire was signed, leaving the disputed territory under joint Georgian and Armenian administration. Question: How many years did the Russo-Turkish war last? Answer:","output":"The Russo-Turkish War lasted for approximately one year.  It began in 1877 and ended in 1878. The war was ignited by the rising tension between the Ottoman Empire and the Russian Empire and was primarily a result of conflict of interest in the Balkans region. The war ended with the signing of the Treaty of San Stefano and later the Treaty of Berlin, which led significant territorial losses for the Ottoman Empire and gains for Russia. However, the territories gained by Russia during this war became a central point of conflict in the Georgian-Armenian War of 1918, as discussed in the context above. The territories were returned to the Ottoman Empire as per the Treaty of Brest-Litovsk signed by Russia in March 1918. This further led to the dissolution of the Transcaucasian collective and the declaration of independence by Georgia, Armenia, and Azerbaijan. Subsequent treaties and military actions led to complex territorial control dynamics between these new nation states and the withdrawing Ottoman Empire, culminating in the short border conflict between the Democratic Republic of Georgia and the First Republic of Armenia."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Please answer the following question: I have known, and admired, Julia Busuttil Nishimura, for many years now and always felt connected through our love of Italian food, Tuscany (Julia lived in Florence and in Orbetello, just 10 minutes away from where we lived in Porto Ercole while I was writing Acquacotta) and Japan. So I have been eagerly awaiting her debut cookbook, Ostro: The Pleasure that Comes From Slowing Down and Cooking with Simple Ingredients, and it is a beauty — it is full of food I want to make and eat. It’s also a joy to look at, as it is presented so beautifully with photographs of Julia (and often her darling little boy Haruki) at home and tables full with food that look Caravaggesque. I have already made her everyday banana loaf, several times, after years of searching for my ideal everyday cake, it is now my go-to banana loaf. I tested her ricciarelli (soft almond cookies from Siena) and pork braised in milk (a classic Italian dish that I have always loved) when she was writing the book and I have long-known her absolutely wonderful, incredibly moist lemon olive oil cake (which is also divine with blood oranges). I absolutely love her homemade approach to everything, including all the wonderful handmade pasta like trofie and orecchiette (look at those beautiful dishes below), but also things like classic tiramisu — homemade savoiardi, homemade mascarpone (yes and yes, I absolutely believe that for the freshest, most delicious mascarpone, it needs to be homemade especially if you live outside of Italy). Yes, these are all things you can also buy in a packet, but Julia’s point is, it is a pleasure to make these things by hand, and the ingredients are so simple — water, flour, cream, eggs, — you probably have them all in your house already. She is a woman after my own heart. Her book inspires you to give it a go. Question: What is a joy to look at?

He prefers to stand most of the day at a desk raised above stomach level. \\"I've got my knees bent. I feel totally alive,\\" he said. \\"It feels more natural to stand.\\" In the past few years, standing has become the new sitting for 10 percent of AOL employees at the firm's Virginia branch. Part of a standing popularity is among accountants, programmers, telemarketers and other office workers across the nation. GeekDesk, a California firm that sells desks raised by electric motors, says sales will triple this year. Standers give various reasons for taking to their feet: It makes them feel more focused, prevents drowsiness , and makes them feel like a general even if they just push paper. (Former Defense Secretary Donald Rumsfels works standing up. So does novelist Philip Roth.) But unknown to them, a debate   is spreading among ergonomics experts  and public-health researchers about whether all office workers should be encouraged to stand--to save lives. Doctors point to surprising new research showing higher rates of diabetes, obesity, heart disease and even mortality among people who sit for long stretches. A study earlier this year in theAmerican Journal of Epidemiologyshowed that among 123,000 adults followed over 14 years, those who sat more than six hours a day were at least 18 percent more likely to die during the time period studied than those who sat less than three hours a day. \\"Every rock we turn over when it comes to sitting is astonishing,\\" said Marc Hamilton, a leading researcher on inactivity physiology at the Pennington Biomedical Research Center in Louisiana. \\"Sitting is harmful.

Produced by Marvel Studios and distributed by Walt Disney Studios Motion Pictures, it was directed by Anthony and Joe Russo, with a screenplay by Christopher Markus and Stephen McFeely. Sebastian Stan, a Romanian-American actor, was born on August 13, 1982, in Constanța, Romania. He gained attention for his role as Carter Baizen in the popular TV series \\"Gossip Girl\\" and later went on to appear in films such as \\"Black Swan\\" (2010), \\"Gone\\" (2012), and \\"The Martian\\" (2015). Stan's debut as Bucky Barnes first occurred in \\"Captain America: The First Avenger\\" (2011). He reprised this role in \\"Captain America: The Winter Soldier\\" (2014), where the character's transformation into the Winter Soldier was revealed. Subsequently, he appeared in \\"Captain America: Civil War\\" (2016), which further explored the conflict between the Winter Soldier and his friend-turned-adversary, Steve Rogers (Captain America), played by Chris Evans. In \\"Captain America: Civil War,\\" Bucky Barnes finds himself at the center of a divide among the Avengers due to a disagreement over international oversight of the superhero team. As the Winter Soldier, Bucky's past actions come into question, and a battle ensues between Captain America, who protects his friend, and Iron Man, who abides by the newly-implemented regulations. Sebastian Stan's performance in the film was well-received by critics and audiences alike, praising his ability to bring emotional depth to a character who struggles with his past as a dangerous assassin and his present as a man trying to reclaim his identity. Sebastian Stan would continue to portray Bucky Barnes in subsequent MCU films, including \\"Black Panther\\" (2018), \\"Avengers: Infinity War\\" (2018), and \\"Avengers: Endgame\\" (2019).

Here is a question: What are geckos ? Would the answer to this question be an entity, an abbreviation, a description, a human, a location, or a numeric value?","output":"The answer to this question, \\"What are Geckos?\\" would be a description. Geckos are a diverse and widespread group of small to medium-sized reptiles belonging to the infraorder Gekkota, within the larger order Squamata, which also includes snakes and other lizards. There are more than 1,500 known species of geckos found across various regions worldwide, including Asia, Africa, Australia, and the Americas. Typically, geckos inhabit warm climates and can be found in numerous ecosystems, such as deserts, rainforests, grasslands, and even urban environments. Geckos are characterized by several unique features. Their most famous trait is their outstanding ability to climb and adhere to various surfaces, including smooth, vertical or overhanging ones. This ability is facilitated by specialized adhesive toe pads consisting of millions of hairs (called setae) which interact with surfaces at the molecular level, utilizing van der Waals forces. This enables geckos to effectively stick to a wide range of materials without the need for sticky secretions or suction cups. Most gecko species are nocturnal, meaning they are active primarily during the night. They have large eyes with vertically elliptical pupils, which can dilate widely, allowing them to capture as much light as possible in low-light conditions. Geckos also possess excellent vision, which helps them locate food and detect potential threats. Geckos exhibit various patterns of coloration and markings, ranging from vivid hues to dull shades, often allowing them to blend with their environment. These colors and patterns can also change based on their mood, temperature, or stress levels. In certain gecko species, these changes can be quite dramatic. Geckos are predominantly insectivorous, feeding on a diet mainly comprising insects and other small invertebrates. Some species, however, are known to consume fruits and nectar as well. Geckos have unique feeding behavior where they use their long, sticky tongues to catch their prey. Geckos reproduce through laying eggs, and many gecko species are oviparous, meaning they lay eggs that hatch outside the mother's body. Some species, however, exhibit ovoviviparous reproduction, where embryos develop inside eggs that are retained within the mother's body until they are ready to hatch. These fascinating creatures have cultural significance in various parts of the world, often symbolizing good luck and prosperity. They also hold scientific interest due to their unique features, such as their adhesive abilities and capacity for regeneration, inspiring innovations in areas like materials science and biomedical research."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant that follows instruction extremely well.

Article: Honorary knighthoods are appointed to citizens of nations where Queen Elizabeth II is not Head of State, and may permit use of post-nominal letters but not the title of Sir or Dame. Occasionally honorary appointees are, incorrectly, referred to as Sir or Dame - Bill Gates or Bob Geldof, for example. Honorary appointees who later become a citizen of a Commonwealth realm can convert their appointment from honorary to substantive, then enjoy all privileges of membership of the order including use of the title of Sir and Dame for the senior two ranks of the Order. An example is Irish broadcaster Terry Wogan, who was appointed an honorary Knight Commander of the Order in 2005 and on successful application for dual British and Irish citizenship was made a substantive member and subsequently styled as \\"Sir Terry Wogan KBE\\". Now answer this question: What is an example of irish broadcaster?","output":"An example of an Irish broadcaster is Terry Wogan. Terry Wogan, born in Limerick, Ireland, was a popular and well-respected television and radio host with a long and successful career primarily in the United Kingdom.

Later, upon obtaining dual British and Irish citizenship, his honorary appointment was converted to a substantive one, which allowed him to be officially styled as \\"Sir Terry Wogan KBE.\\" This demonstrates how honorary knighthoods can be granted to individuals from nations where Queen Elizabeth II is not the Head of State and later potentially converted into a substantive appointment, enabling them to enjoy all the privileges and titles that come with the honor."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

The full scale of spending on private contractors by the UK’s biggest police force is laid bare today as the nation’s most senior officer is summoned by MPs to account for millions of pounds in wasted public money. A leaked list seen by The Mail on Sunday shows the Metropolitan Police has signed deals worth £3.5 billion with more than 300 companies, to supply everything from high-tech weaponry to sandwiches. The huge sums will be scrutinised when Met Commissioner Bernard Hogan-Howe appears before a powerful group of MPs on Tuesday, with Scotland Yard under pressure to save more than £500 million without losing officers from the streets. Mounting costs: The Metropolitan Police have been criticised for their spending including £500,00 going on cleaning up horse manure. Full details of the Met’s spending with private firms, spanning more than a decade and with some contracts ongoing, reveal the force is paying out:. Keith Vaz, the chairman of the Home Affairs Select Committee, said: ‘This is the first time that we have received such a comprehensive list about the expenditure of a  police force. We will be exploring some of the expenditure with the Commissioner when he appears before the Committee on Tuesday.’ Joanne McCartney, chairwoman of the London Assembly’s Police and Crime Committee, said: ‘I think procurement at the Met does need to be looked at. We have raised issues with the Met’s spending on dog kennelling before. Its IT costs have been looked at before. ‘I think the budget needs to be tightened, otherwise it will mean fewer police officers being employed.’Jenny Jones, the deputy chair of the Police and Crime Committee, said: ‘Police officers tell me they see waste all the time at the Met. Aiming high: The force spent £21.1million on weapons and armour. They tell me it costs the Met £100 just to put a whiteboard up in their office. The police officers say they get angry because it means bobbies on the beat are cut back. There is waste at every level of the organisation.’ With national responsibility for counterterrorism and protecting VIPs as well as keeping Londoners safe, the Met currently has 31,548 officers, a further 2,738 police community support officers and another 20,000 civilian staff. Like other forces, it must cope with 20 per cent cuts to main Home Office funding, but the Met is yet to finalise how it will make savings totalling £548 million by 2015-16. The Met is behind schedule after the phone-hacking scandal led to the departure of three senior figures, including the Commissioner, while much of the past year was spent preparing for  the Olympics. However, although salaries account for a large proportion of bills, the Met cannot easily lose officers after London Mayor Boris Johnson made an election vow to protect police numbers. Frying squad: £920,000 went on 'bread and morning products' His Deputy Mayor for Policing and Crime, Stephen Greenhalgh, has said that only about 500 posts will be cut and has promised to ‘sweat’ the assets and introduce ‘smarter procurement’ at an organisation he described as an ‘enormous beast’. Mr Greenhalgh told the Home Affairs Select Committee in September that he was ‘staggered’ by how much the force spends on IT. It also employs 802 in-house computer maintenance staff because counterterrorism officers are worried about the security risks of using outside external contractors. Mr Greenhalgh said the Met did  not need a ‘plethora of expensive buildings’ and spent a ‘staggering’ £200 million on running them. Last month, the force announced plans to sell its New Scotland  Yard headquarters, famous for its revolving sign, in an attempt to  save money. The reassuring presence of police stations across London is also under threat, with proposals to replace them with counters inside supermarkets and cafes. The full list of the Met’s 319 contracts with private companies, some dating back as far as 2003, suggest many more areas where the axe is likely to fall. According to the document, the total value of the listed deals is £3.5 billion. A third of this has gone on IT alone. The money spent on food and drink to be sold in canteens includes £920,000 on ‘bread and morning products’ and £148,000 on fruit squash. The outlay on weapons and armour included £3.2 million on Tasers, £7,000 on ‘grenade boxes’, £641,000 on ammunition for sniper rifles and £400,000 on Heckler & Koch pistols. A Met spokesman refused to say what its Recon Scout robots were used for on ‘security grounds’. The document also shows the force has spent more than £40,000 on storing evidence relating to their investigation into the death of Mr Litvinenko, who detectives say was killed with the poison polonium-210 in 2006.

Among £13.7 million-worth of vehicles bought were a Volkswagen  Caravelle people carrier, 18 Ford Transit vans, mountain bikes, multi-vehicle transporters and six Jaguars. A Scotland Yard spokesman could not explain why it leased five electric cars for £64,000. In total, £10.9 million was spent on caring for animals – both those used by the force and those seized from the public. This included a £500,000-a-year deal with Balfour Beatty to remove manure from horse stables and dispose of it, and £1.3 million on ‘forage/bedding’. A further £22.6 million was spent on clothing, ranging from £151,876 for ‘embroidered inspector epaulettes’ to £46,134 on riot police balaclavas. Major contracts included £280 million to clean and maintain police buildings, £107 million to provide concessionary travel for officers and £220 million to repair the Met’s fleet of vehicles. Millions of pounds were also spent on fees for doctors who check on the health of suspects in custody. More unusual items of spending included £62,000 to improve oil storage at a bothy near Balmoral, £600,000 for ‘conflict management services’ and £358,696 to build a ‘temporary armoury’ in an ‘underground car park’. A spokesman for the Met declined to comment on individual contracts.  He insisted: ‘The Met gets best value for money through stringent procurement processes.’ A spokesman for the Mayor’s Office for Policing and Crime said: ‘The Mayor’s Office has put tough new processes in place to monitor spending, cut out waste and ensure more money goes towards frontline policing.’ What are the important parts of this article?","output":"The article highlights the Metropolitan Police's expenditure on private contractors, which totals £3.5 billion with more than 300 companies, for various services and supplies ranging from high-tech weaponry to sandwiches.

Michael, on the other hand, just began adulthood and is still quite young. Both of them want to ask the doctor about their risks for future health problems.  But I can use this background: During late adulthood, the risk of developing diseases such as cardiovascular diseases and cancer continues to rise. Most people also have a decline in strength and stamina. Their senses may start failing, and their reflex time typically increases. Their immune system also doesn’t work as well as it used to. As a result, common diseases like the flu may become more serious and even lead to death. The majority of late adults develop arthritis, and as many as one in four develop Alzheimer’s disease.

Write a title for this article: Wednesday, February 23rd 2011, 4:00 AM TAMPA - Don't think for a second that Hank Steinbrenner didn't intend to jab Derek Jeter with his line on Monday about \\"players building mansions,\\" no matter how much the Yankee owner was back-pedaling Tuesday. This is a page right out of the old George Steinbrenner playbook, and Hank suddenly seems to have decided to take up for the late Boss when it comes to calling out star players. Essentially Hank was reminding Jeter that the Yankees agreed this winter to pay him a lot more money than they think he is worth, so he better go out and earn it. And while Jeter, whose Tampa-area mansion has attracted much attention locally, laughed it off Tuesday, he has to know this only further heightens the scrutiny on him this season as he tries to bounce back from hitting .270 and prove his career is not in significant decline. Put it this way: If the captain gets off to a slow start, his countdown to 3,000 hits this season may not be so warm and fuzzy. As it is, the onus is likely to be on the Yankee lineup to make up for a lack of dominant starting pitching in 2011, which means Jeter needs to hit and be on base for the thumpers in the middle of the lineup. His history is that he responds in a big way to criticism. When The Boss himself got on Jeter for his nightlife activities before the 2003 season - remember the subsequent Visa conga-line commercial? - the shortstop hit .324 and helped lead the Yanks back to the World Series. Of course, he turned 29 that year, and he'll turn 37 this year. All of which makes for some fascinating intrigue, especially now that Hank has escaped the dungeon in which he had apparently been locked for a couple of years. He's not George, to be sure. George wouldn't have backed off his obvious knock on Jeter so quickly, as Hank did Tuesday, saying, \\"You don't win five rings by being complacent. So it was definitely not Derek I was talking about.\\" From everything you see and hear about Hank, he doesn't have George's bully side. So while he made his point about Jeter one day, he seemed concerned the next about bruising his shortstop's feelings. Still, Hank did stick to his theme, hammering the Yankees as a whole for not being hungry enough last year. Obviously such a theme would carry more weight if the club had missed the playoffs, rather than reaching the ALCS, but then, as we've come to learn, when Hank shoots from the hip, his comments are more scattershot than measured. Indeed, Bud Selig has already reacted to Hank's ranting about revenue-sharing, calling brother Hal Tuesday to remind him of the gag order the commissioner has placed on the subject.

Article: The Communist Party of Germany featured similar attitudes. In Die Welt, a communist newspaper published in Stockholm[e] the exiled communist leader Walter Ulbricht opposed the allies (Britain representing \\"the most reactionary force in the world\\") and argued: \\"The German government declared itself ready for friendly relations with the Soviet Union, whereas the English–French war bloc desires a war against the socialist Soviet Union. The Soviet people and the working people of Germany have an interest in preventing the English war plan.\\" Question: The British army was considered to be what by Walter Ulbricbht?","output":"Walter Ulbricht, the exiled communist leader of Germany, regarded the British army as part of \\"the most reactionary force in the world.\\" In his statement published in Die Welt, a communist newspaper in Stockholm, Ulbricht expressed his opposition to the allies, represented by Britain and France. Ulbricht's view of the British army, as well as Britain and its allies, was rooted in the historical, political, and ideological context of the time. During the era in which Ulbricht was active, the world was divided by conflicting ideologies – primarily between communism and capitalism. Ulbricht, as a devoted communist, saw the capitalist, imperialist nations, like Britain and France, as enemies of the socialist cause and working-class people. For Ulbricht, the British and French war alliance posed a significant threat to the Soviet Union, which was the major power representing and championing socialism and communism at the time. He believed that the British and their allies were actively seeking a war against the Soviet Union to weaken or even eliminate the power of socialism in the world. In contrast, the German government, at least in rhetoric, had declared its willingness to maintain friendly relations with the Soviet Union, an approach that Ulbricht saw favorably, especially given his devotion to communism. Ulbricht's perspective on the British forces, therefore, was shaped by his ideological convictions and the geopolitical dynamics of the time. In his eyes, the British army, as part of \\"the most reactionary force in the world,\\" represented an obstacle to the advancement and consolidation of socialism on the global stage. He urged the Soviet people and working people of Germany to prevent the plans of the British and their allies, which he believed were aimed at starting a war against the Soviet Union, the bastion of socialism."},{"instruction":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

The foreign currency got more expensive and they had problems with a shadow currency exchange. Bradland people were more cautious and less inclined to take risks, but didn't have those problems.  Which country had a more shadow market problems?  Hint: Often, foreign exchange controls can result in the creation of black markets to exchange the weaker currency for stronger currencies. This leads to a situation where the exchange rate for the foreign currency is much higher than the rate set by the government, and therefore creates a shadow currency exchange market. As such, it is unclear whether governments have the ability to enact effective exchange controls.[1]","output":"Based on the information provided, it appears that Booneland experienced more significant shadow market problems compared to Bradland due to the changes in their foreign exchange controls. When Booneland altered their foreign exchange controls, the foreign currency became more expensive, leading to difficulties with a shadow currency exchange. Foreign exchange controls are policies that restrict or guide the flow of foreign currencies and investments in and out of a nation. These controls can have multiple purposes, such as protecting a country's financial stability, safeguarding the value of its currency, or giving the government more control over financial decisions and trade policies. However, these controls can also produce unintended consequences, such as the rise of shadow markets. In contrast to Booneland, Bradland did not change their foreign exchange controls, and the people were more cautious and less inclined to take risks. As a result, Bradland did not experience many problems associated with shadow currency exchanges. The hint provided suggests that foreign exchange controls can lead to the creation of black markets to exchange the weaker currency for stronger currencies, which is likely what has happened in Booneland's case. In the shadow market, people may engage in illegal transactions by exchanging their weaker national currency for a stronger foreign currency at a significantly higher exchange rate than the one set by the government. This informal market can create distortions in the national economy and provide incentives for criminal activities, such as money laundering, tax evasion, and currency speculation. Furthermore, as the hint indicates, the effectiveness of exchange controls can be difficult to determine as they may not always achieve their intended purpose. In some cases, they might exacerbate the very problems they intended to solve, making it even harder to manage the flow of foreign currencies and investments. Booneland's experience serves as an example of how foreign exchange controls can lead to unintended consequences, such as the emergence of shadow markets. In conclusion, Booneland faced more shadow market problems due to the changes in their foreign exchange controls, which caused the foreign currency to become more expensive and resulted in difficulties with a shadow currency exchange. Bradland, on the other hand, did not experience such issues as they did not change their policies, and their citizens were more cautious and risk-averse."},{"instruction":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

Baldwin is then picked up from work by an airplane flown by his wife Claudia. On the way home, Claudia tells Michael that she wants to move the kids back to Los Angeles where they can live in a more civilized environment. Michael argues that he cannot just walk away from the exploration since it was his idea. Upon arriving home, Michael and Claudia must deal with their three children arguing with each other about the existence of Santa Claus. To make matters worse for Michael, Murdock, portrayed as the stereotyped insensitive corporate boss, threatens to terminate his employment if the exploration does not produce results. The next day, Michael returns to his office, where he is met by Santa Claus's chief elf Ed. Ed informs Baldwin that their dynamiting is causing damage to North Pole City, the home of Santa Claus and his elves.  He explains that while their activities at \\"Site A\\", their primary drilling area, are causing extensive damage, any blasts at their secondary site, known as \\"Site B\\", would destroy North Pole City due to the greater proximity of the dynamite blasts.  Assuming that Ed was just hired to pull off a practical joke, Baldwin bursts into uncontrollable laughter. The next day, Ed arrives at the Baldwins' house in a modified World War II-era snowcat, explaining that he intends to take Michael and his family to North Pole City to prove that Santa Claus is real and reveal the damage that is being done.

A:","output":"The Shvetsov ASh-82 (M-82) is a Soviet 14-cylinder, two-row, air-cooled radial aircraft engine that can trace its origins back to a series of engines leading back to an American engine. The development process involved successive modifications and improvements to existing engines to cater to various performance needs of the Soviet aviation industry. The ASh-82 was derived from the Shvetsov M-62 engine, which itself was the product of development efforts based on the Shvetsov M-25. Before delving further into the evolution of these engines, it is essential to understand the birth of the M-25 engine. The Shvetsov M-25 was a Soviet licensed version of the American Wright R-1820 Cyclone 9 engine. This nine-cylinder, single-row, air-cooled radial aircraft engine was developed by the Wright Aeronautical Corporation in the 1930s. The Cyclone 9 was widely utilized in various aircraft, particularly in military applications, and played a significant role in propelling aviation technology during that era. In the early 1930s, the Soviet Union realized the need for advanced aircraft engines to bolster their military and aviation capabilities. They purchased a license to manufacture the Wright R-1820 Cyclone 9 engine and began producing their own version, which was designated the Shvetsov M-25. This engine was an influential foundation for the later Soviet radial engines, as it was integrated into many aircraft types and continuously improved. As both the aviation capabilities and the performance requirements grew in the Soviet Union, the M-25 underwent multiple changes, upgrades, and developments. One key result of this ongoing process was the Shvetsov M-62. The M-62 was an enhanced version of the M-25, boasting more power and better performance characteristics. It featured increased displacement, a higher compression ratio, a new two-speed supercharger, and a higher overall output, making it suitable for larger and faster aircraft. However, the demands of the aviation industry did not stop there. The development of the Shvetsov ASh-82 (M-82) continued from the foundation set by the M-62. One of the most significant changes in this engine was the transformation from a single-row, nine-cylinder layout to a 14-cylinder, two-row configuration. This new design improved cooling efficiency and allowed for even higher power output. The ASh-82 went on to power numerous Soviet military aircraft, such as the Lavochkin La-5, La-7, and Tupolev Tu-2. In summary, the Shvetsov ASh-82 (M-82) Soviet radial aircraft engine had its roots in the American Wright R-1820 Cyclone 9 engine. The Soviet Union acquired a license to produce their own version, the M-25, which formed the basis for the development of the M-62 and eventually the ASh-82. The series of engines showcase the continuous evolution and progression of aircraft engine technology as well as the Soviet Union's efforts to maintain a robust aviation industry."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

When I was seven years old, my family created one. First, we put clean sand in a thin glass box and put the ants into it. Soon they got to work making tunnels. I was amazed that each one knew exactly what to do. With my mom's help, I kept a record of what happened each day and named the ants. One day when I had put my face close to the structure (building), accidentally I knocked it over, and all the tunnels fell in. Although the ants survived their earthquake, one by one they began to die. I was frightened as I watched them give up their tunnel-building to carry the bodies to a corner of the farm. My mother reported that the ants were dying of \\"frustration  \\". They simply could not stand the reality that their tunnels had been destroyed. Although much time has passed, I still think of that ant farm. Over the years, I came to realize the ants have the spirit of teamwork. Working together, they were able to create an amazing world for themselves. I also learned that they should be admired for their hard work. Day in and day out, each worked at their task. The ant farm showed that teamwork and perseverance   are indeed the keys to success. But there was an even larger lesson that I did not realize until recently --Adversity   is a natural part of life, and must be accepted. Unlike the ants, humans cannot give up when they face disappointment. So I try to live my life like those hardworking ants. But, unlike them, I try not to let frustration defeat   me. I will have to keep building my tunnels. Question: Which of the following is NOT the lesson from the ant farm? Options: A: The ants have the spirit of teamwork. B: The ants give up when they face frustration. C: The ants should be admired for their hard work. D: Teamwork and perseverance are indeed the keys to success.

They flee in a medical helicopter, chased by Tuco, in a dogfight that leaves BA with a fear of flying. The battle ends when they lure Tuco's helicopter into American airspace, where it is shot down by a USAF F-22 Raptor for trespassing. Eight years later in Iraq, Hannibal is contacted by CIA Special Activities Division operative Lynch (Patrick Wilson), who assigns them a black ops mission to recover U.S. Treasury plates and over 1 billion in cash from Iraqi insurgents slated to move it out of Baghdad in an armored convoy. Hannibal's commanding officer, General Morrison (Gerald McRaney), consents to the operation but Face's former girlfriend, Defense Criminal Investigative Service Capt. Charissa Sosa (Jessica Biel), tries to discourage the team against getting the plates. The mission is successful; when the team returns to base, however, the money and Morrison's vehicle are destroyed by Brock Pike (Brian Bloom) and his men from the private security firm Black Forest. Without Morrison (the only proof that they were authorized to act), Hannibal, Face, Murdock, and BA are court martialed and they are sentenced to ten years in separate prisons and dishonorably discharged. Sosa also ended up court-martialed and is demoted to lieutenant.

You will be given a task. You must generate a detailed and long answer. Summarize: If you can manage to grab a large object, such as a plank or a piece of rafter, you'll greatly increase your chances of survival. The object will absorb some of the impact when you land, taking a little stress off of your bones. If you're falling next to a building, or off a cliff in the wilderness, do your best to break your fall into segments by hitting a ledge, a lower cliff, a tree, or another object. This breaks up the momentum of your fall and divides it into several shorter falls, which gives you a much better chance of surviving. If your knees and elbows are locked and your muscles are rigid, the impact of the fall will do more harm to your vital organs. Don't hold yourself stiff. Do your best to relax your body so that when you hit the ground your body is more easily able to take the impact.  One way to remain (relatively) calm is to focus on performing the steps that lead to greater survival rates. Stay aware of your body, moving your arms and legs to make sure they aren't locked. Possibly nothing is more important to surviving a fall (or simpler to do) than bending your knees. Research has shown that having one's knees bent at impact can reduce the magnitude of impact forces 36-fold. However, do not bend them too far - only keep a slight bend so they are not locked. No matter what height you fall from, you should always try to land on your feet.  Landing feet-first concentrates the impact force on a small area, allowing your feet and legs to absorb the worst of the blow.  If you are in any other position, try to right yourself before you hit the ground.  Fortunately, attaining the feet-first position seems to be an instinctive reaction. Keep your feet and legs tightly together so that both your feet hit the ground at the same time. Land on the balls of your feet. Point your toes slightly down before impact so that you will land on the balls of your feet. This will allow your lower body to more effectively absorb the impact. Once you land on your feet, you will fall either to the side, front or back. Try to avoid falling on your back. Falling to the side is statistically best. If you can't manage that, try to fall forward instead, breaking your fall with your arms. When you fall from a great height onto land, you will usually bounce. Some people who survive the initial impact (often with a feet-first landing) suffer a fatal injury on their second impact. You will most likely be unconscious when you bounce. Cover your head with your arms by placing your arms on the sides of your head with your elbows facing forward (and projecting in front of your face), and your fingers laced behind your head or neck.  This covers a large portion of your head. With all the adrenaline flowing in response to your flight, you may not even feel injured upon landing.  Even if you are not visibly injured, you may have sustained fractures or internal injuries that must be treated immediately.  No matter how you're feeling, get to a hospital as quickly as possible.","output":"To increase one's chance of survival when falling from a great height, taking several steps can help absorb and distribute the impact forces effectively. Firstly, grabbing a large object like a plank or a piece of rafter can help absorb some of the landing impact, reducing stress on bones. It's also recommended to try and break the fall into segments by hitting ledges, cliffs, or trees as it divides the fall into shorter sections, improving chances of survival. When falling, avoid locking knees and elbows and try to relax muscles to protect vital organs. Focusing on performing the steps that lead to greater survival rates can help stay relatively calm.

During landing, keep feet and legs together and land on the balls of the feet with toes pointing slightly down. After landing feet-first, try falling to the side, which is statistically the best, or fall forward and use arms to break the fall.

James Michael \`\`Jimmy'' Anderson, OBE (born 30 July 1982) is an English cricketer who plays for Lancashire and England, in all forms of the game. Widely regarded as one of the game's greatest fast bowlers, he is known for his swing bowling, being able to swing the ball both ways and is adept at extracting late swing. Currently holding the record of most wickets for England in both ODI cricket and Test cricket, Anderson is the only English bowler, and the 6th overall, to pass 500 test wickets. is jimmy anderson the best bowler in the world?","output":"While it is difficult to definitively say that Jimmy Anderson is the best bowler in the world, there is no denying his exceptional skill and numerous accomplishments that place him among the top bowlers globally. Various factors contribute to the overall assessment of a bowler's excellence, including personal statistics, impact on the team, consistency, and longevity. It is essential to recognize that opinions on the best bowler in the world are often subjective and influenced by personal biases and allegiances. A comprehensive look at Jimmy Anderson's career achievements and abilities can provide valuable context for evaluating his position among the best bowlers in the world. With over 600 Test wickets to his name, Anderson is the highest wicket-taker among fast bowlers in Test cricket history. This record is a clear testament to his mastery and consistency in the longest format of the game, making him an undeniable legend in Test cricket. Furthermore, Anderson's ability to generate considerable swing with the ball while maintaining exceptional control makes him a challenging adversary for batsmen. His prowess with both the new and the old ball and expertise in extracting late swing further solidify his status as a fearsome fast bowler. Another factor that highlights Anderson's greatness is his longevity in the sport. Fast bowling is physically demanding, and it is rare for a fast bowler to consistently perform at the highest level for an extended period. Anderson's ongoing career of nearly two decades at the top level speaks volumes about his dedication, fitness, and durability. Taking these factors into account, there is little doubt that Jimmy Anderson is one of the best bowlers in the world. However, it is important to acknowledge that there are other exceptional bowlers, like Dale Steyn, Glenn McGrath, and Wasim Akram who similarly have outstanding records and unique skill sets that make them strong contenders for the title. As cricket is a continuously evolving game with various formats and playing conditions, the best bowler in the world can be a matter of personal opinion or preference, depending on what factors one considers most significant. Nevertheless, Jimmy Anderson certainly ranks among the elite bowlers in the history of the game, and his enduring success has cemented his status as a true legend of cricket."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant that follows instruction extremely well.

In the first quarter, Baltimore took flight first with kicker Matt Stover getting a 21-yard field goal for the only score of the period.  In the second quarter, the Ravens increased its lead with Stover getting a 28-yard field goal.  The Cardinals would respond with kicker Neil Rackers getting a 48-yard field goal.

Open warfare broke out in 1352, when John V, supported by Venetian and Serbian troops, launched an attack on Matthew Kantakouzenos. John Kantakouzenos came to his son's aid with 10,000 Ottoman troops who retook the cities of Thrace, liberally plundering them in the process. In October 1352, at Demotika, the Ottoman force met and defeated 4,000 Serbs provided to John V by Dushan. This was the Ottomans' first victory in Europe and an ominous portent. Two years later their capture of Gallipoli marked the beginning of the Ottoman conquest of the Balkans, culminating a century later in the Fall of Constantinople. Meanwhile, John V fled to the island of Tenedos, from where he made an unsuccessful attempt to seize Constantinople in March 1353. John VI Kantakouzenos responded by having Matthew crowned as co-emperor, but John V Palaiologos, enlisting Genoese support and relying on the declining popularity of Kantakouzenos, succeeded in entering the capital in November 1354. John VI Kantakouzenos abdicated and retired to a monastery. Matthew held out in Thrace making war upon the Serbs in 1356. Then Matthew gathered an army of 5,000 Turks and marched on Serres the Serbian held capital of John Ugleisha. Stephen Urosh V whose mother also ruled at Serres decided to raise an army to defend his mother and in 1357 when Matthew and his Turks attacked, The Serbian army under Vojin The Count of Drama came to the rescue and the Turks were defeated and Matthew captured and held hostage until his ransom was paid by the Emperor John V Palaiologos who was now the sole master of a rump state.

Individuals often have a tendency to lump all debt together, when in reality debt differs significantly in cost, value, and risk. Knowing these differences helps you recognize which debt to tackle first.","output":"In the following paragraph on how to start living a debt-free life, the discussion will continue by suggesting practical steps on prioritizing and tackling different types of debt, managing finances effectively, and avoiding future debt. Here's an outline of the possible content: 1. Prioritize your debt    a. Pay off high-interest, unsecured debt first - For instance, credit card debts and payday loans typically have higher interest rates than secured debt. By focusing on reducing these debts first, you can save more money on interest charges and prevent them from ballooning.    b. Consider refinancing or consolidating secured debts - If you have multiple secured debts such as mortgages, auto or student loans, explore the possibilities of refinancing or consolidating them if it leads to a lower interest rate. This can help in reducing the total debt repayment amount and make it easier for you to manage. 2. Develop a budget and track your expenses    a. Create a realistic budget that suits your lifestyle and financial goals. Allocate chunks of your monthly income to essential expenses (rent, groceries, utilities), debt repayment, and savings. Stick to this budget to avoid unnecessary spending.    b. Track your expenses and analyze your spending habits. Identify areas of excessive spending and find ways to cut back. For instance, if you spend too much on entertainment, look for inexpensive alternatives or limit your outings. 3. Establish an emergency fund    a. Set aside money in an emergency fund to cover unexpected expenses that would otherwise force you to rely on credit cards or loans. Start by saving a small amount each month and aim to build a fund that can cover at least three to six months' worth of living expenses. 4. Automate your debt payments    a. Ensure timely debt repayments by setting up automatic deductions from your bank account towards your loans or credit card balances. This will help you avoid late payment fees and maintain a healthy credit score. 5. Review and monitor your credit    a. Regularly review your credit reports to ensure accuracy and detect any fraudulent activity. Also, monitor your credit score and stay informed about factors affecting it. 6. Seek professional assistance    a. If you feel overwhelmed by your debt situation, consider seeking the help of a financial advisor or a credit counselor. They can help create a personalized plan to pay off your debts and provide advice on improving your financial health. 7. Develop healthy financial habits    a. Adopt long-term financial habits that focus on savings and responsible spending. For example, create a shopping list and avoid impulse purchases, use cash instead of credit for everyday expenses, and only take on debt for necessary investments like education or housing. By following these steps, individuals will not only effectively manage and eliminate their current debt, but also significantly reduce the risk of accumulating future debt. These strategies will empower them to create a stable financial foundation to work from and achieve their long-term financial goals."},{"instruction":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

Leap village was inhabited by vegetarians and vegans.Their food consumption was moderate.  Hint: Any unused energy in food, whether it comes from carbohydrates, proteins, or lipids, is stored in the body as fat.

He's assigned to deliver an expensive Mercedes-Benz from Los Angeles all the way to its owner in Miami, which will also allow him to attend the wedding of his sister. He's given strict instructions not to damage the vehicle or pick up any hitchhikers. Sean is driving cross country when he picks up Nick, a hitchhiker who happens to be a vampire hunter hunting a group of vampires led by one of the Forsaken--a group of knights who made a pact with the fallen angel Abaddon to live forever. Two of the Forsaken are located in the United States (including the one Nick is tracking, Kit). Nick was bitten and infected by a vampire but, thanks to an antiviral drug cocktail, the vampire virus is kept at bay. Each of the Forsaken carry a unique strain of vampirism; killing a Forsaken kills his entire bloodline and reverses the condition of anyone infected. Nick believes that if he kills Kit, he will be cured before he turns (as the drug cocktail eventually will lose effect). At first Sean is less than willing to indulge his new acquaintance; however, he is convinced after the two come across a disoriented young woman, Megan, at a diner, who was bitten by the vampires and left for dead. Nick also proves he is telling the truth by killing a vampire, Teddy, with exposure to sunlight. Sean and Nick take Megan to their motel room, but she goes into a rage and bites Sean; they realize they must kill the Forsaken responsible to prevent Sean from turning. Forsaken can only be slain on hallowed ground, so the three head for a Spanish mission 60 miles away. They stop at a gas station where an old woman, Ina, lets them in.

Jones has criticized both Republican Illinois Governor Bruce Rauner and President Donald Trump in the past, accusing Trump of having \\"surrounded himself with hordes of Jews.\\" But regardless of his potential nomination, prospects look grim for Jones' electoral success. The Washington Post reports that the district is heavily Democratic, and Jones is expected to lose to either Rep. Dan Lipinski or Democratic primary challenger Marie Newman in November.  In conclusion, while Arthur Jones may secure the GOP nomination for Illinois' 3rd Congressional District, his extremist views and the district's strong Democratic leaning all but ensure his defeat in the general election."},{"instruction":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

Just like my fellow yelper, I too had purchased a warranty for 99.00. For some reason 6 months later the TV would turn but no picture. I called FRY's and they transferred me to the warranty department. I was told that someone would come to my home to fix it. In a few days 2 technicians from an LG approved company (no Frys) came and took 2 min. to let me know that I needed a new panel. They said they would be back next week to fix it.  Three weeks go by, no call, no show. I called the company back and asked for status. They told me that Fry's denied the claim. They said I should call Fry's for more information. I called Fry's and they said they denied it because it was too expensive to purchase the new panel. I asked then why did I purchase this warranty for if it doesn't do me any good? They transferred me to a manager, Gabriel. He said I could exchange it. I told him I didn't want to do that because it's not a regular TV. Its an LG EZ Sign TV. He said he would check on it and that he or someone else would get back to me. It's been 3 days. No call from anyone. I won't be holding my breath. I'm still patiently waiting. If I don't get a call tomorrow. I'm going to have to call back.

Please tell me the sentiment of the following review: When I saw the film for the first time in the early 1970s, I was in awe of this film. Visually it was stunning and the events on campuses in Europe and USA made you relate with what Antonioni was trying to say so well visually in the final 15 minutes of the movie: blowing up in your mind the \\"tyrannical\\" establishments and big business interests. The repeated blowing up of the beautiful house in the middle of a desert, the lead female character enjoying the natural stream of cold water, painting a plane in psychedelic designs (even the staid British Airways did it a few years ago) are some of the images that were copied by advertising personnel all over the world for decades. Even Pink Floyd increased their fan following after the film was released. You see this film some 30 years later and you begin to wonder why the same film has lost its appeal. Today anti-establishment films have more substance--facts, documentation, fine performances, and superb screenplays. Antonioni seems to be out-of-date; a flawed genius. Even viewing Antonioni's \\"Blow Up\\" today gives you the similar feeling that he is passe. \\"Zabriski Point\\" has to be evaluated for what it was when it was released. It was a great film if you were to see it on a wide Panavision screen as opposed to the dwarfed TV screens. The visual and aural (Mick Jagger, Kieth Richards, Pink Floyd, et al.) allure of the film still remains. The lead pair were not great actors but they were cute and natural. One of them (Mark Frechette) died in prison in USA extending the reality of the non-conformist values he personified in the film. Today, Antonioni seems out of \\"sync.\\" But watch carefully and you will appreciate the muted sounds of the regular actors--Rod Taylor, G.D. Spradling, the ladies at the swimming pool, the cops at the air-strip. The real sounds in contrast are from the non-conformists. Antonioni was relevant 30 years ago but his grasp of the medium cannot be questioned even today. He knew what he was doing.","output":"The sentiment of the review can be interpreted as mixed to positive, with the reviewer appreciating the film for its historical significance and the emotions it evoked when it was first released. The writer acknowledges the film's visual and aural appeal, impact on popular culture, and its reflection of the events happening in the 1970s. Although the lead actors were not seen as exceptional, they were described as \\"cute and natural.\\" The reviewer also recognizes the talent and vision of the director, Michelangelo Antonioni, and his mastery of the medium, even though they believe his work may feel somewhat dated today. However, the sentiment becomes more negative when the reviewer reflects on their impression of the film after seeing it again 30 years later. They mention that the movie has lost its appeal and feels outdated when compared to contemporary anti-establishment films that have more substance in terms of facts, documentation, performances, and screenplay. Additionally, the reviewer feels that Antonioni's influence is now considered \\"passe\\" and his work is \\"out-of-sync.\\" In summary, the sentiment of the review seems to be predominantly positive when looking back on the film and its historical context, but the reviewer has lingering feelings of disappointment and disillusionment when comparing it to modern film standards. Nonetheless, they still acknowledge and respect Antonioni's skills as a filmmaker and his significant contributions to cinema."},{"instruction":"Given a definition of a task and a sample input, break the definition into small parts.

Answer the following question: Title: A Great Hits Package. Review: I've followed The Motels since 1982's All Four One album, but it's their greatest hits package that stands out. 19 tracks, all of them great post-punk and punk songs. It's difficult to categorize The Motels because they incorporate elements of punk, new wave and adult contemporary. Their individual albums are not quite as solid as this hits package, but you might want to listen to 1982's All Four One cd. The Motels disbanded in 1985, after the release of Shock. Martha did a solo cd in 1987, and then in 1990 this hits package was released. The hits are all here: \\"Only the Lonely\\", \\"Take the L\\", \\"Suddenly, Last Summer\\" and \\"Shame\\" plus other non-hits like \\"Icy Red\\", \\"So L.A.\\", \\"Who's Problem Am I?\\", \\"Kix\\", \\"Total Control\\" and \\"Danger\\". I'd highly recommend this compilation of songs for those who like early new wave/late punk served up with style. Does this product review convey a negative or positive sentiment? Answer:","output":"The product review conveys a positive sentiment.

Translate this to English?","output":"The Community industrial designs system and the international registration system established by the Geneva Act complement each other. In detail, the Community industrial designs system refers to the design protection system within the European Union, providing protection for the appearance of a product resulting from its features such as lines, contours, colors, shape, texture, or materials. This system is governed by the Council Regulation (EC) No. 6/2002, which is a legal framework that aims to harmonize the rules for protecting designs within the EU member states. Under this system, when a design is registered, it offers protection of that design throughout the entire European Union as a Registered Community Design (RCD). On the other hand, the international registration system established by the Geneva Act, known as the Hague System for the International Registration of Industrial Designs, allows designers to protect their designs globally by filing only one application at the World Intellectual Property Organization (WIPO). This system simplifies the process of obtaining protection for designs in multiple countries and reduces costs, time, and administrative efforts. The Geneva Act came into existence in 1999 as a revision of the Hague Agreement Concerning the International Registration of Industrial Designs, and it enhances the international design registration system by providing more flexibility, diversity, and cooperation among its member states. Hence, both the Community industrial designs system and the international registration system established by the Geneva Act complement each other by providing different levels of design protection - one at the European Union level and the other at a global level. These systems facilitate designers to efficiently register and protect their designs in multiple jurisdictions while optimizing the entire registration process. By working in conjunction with each other, the two systems significantly contribute to the development, promotion, and enforcement of intellectual property rights related to industrial designs."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

The conference opened in November 1922, with representatives from the United Kingdom, France, Italy and Turkey. It heard speeches from Benito Mussolini of Italy and Raymond Poincaré of France. At its conclusion, Turkey assented to the political clauses and the \\"freedom of the straits\\", which was Britain's main concern. The matter of the status of Mosul was deferred, since Curzon refused to be budged on the British position that the area was part of Iraq. The British Iraq Mandate's possession of Mosul was confirmed by a League of Nations brokered agreement between Turkey and Great Britain in 1926. The French delegation, however, did not achieve any of their goals and on 30 January 1923 issued a statement that they did not consider the draft treaty to be any more than a \\"basis of discussion\\". The Turks therefore refused to sign the treaty. On 4 February 1923, Curzon made a final appeal to Ismet Pasha to sign, and when he refused the Foreign Secretary broke off negotiations and left that night on the Orient Express. Answer this question: Which happened first, the Conference of Lausanne or the League of Nations brokered agreement between Turkey and Great Britain regarding Mosul?","output":"The Conference of Lausanne happened first.

A: This area has a number of functions, the most prominent being to mark where the goalkeeper may handle the ball and where a penalty foul by a member of the defending team becomes punishable by a penalty kick.  Does the answer correctly answer the question","output":"A: In the context of the sport of football (soccer), only the goalkeeper can handle the ball with their hands, but under specific conditions. The rules of the game indicate that the goalkeeper can use their hands only within the penalty area, which is an 18-yard box surrounding their goal. The purpose of these rules is to provide a fair and balanced gameplay experience, as well as to define the roles and responsibilities of different players on the field. When inside the penalty area, the goalkeeper is allowed to handle the ball to block shots, catch crosses, and initiate their team's attacking moves by distributing the ball to their teammates. However, when outside of the penalty area, the goalkeeper must follow the same rules as other players, and handling the ball will result in a free kick for the opposing team. It is essential to remember that there are specific instances when even the goalkeeper is not allowed to handle the ball with their hands, such as receiving a back-pass from their teammate using feet or when they are already holding the ball. In such cases, they are expected to play the ball with their feet like any other player on the field. In summary, only the goalkeeper can handle the ball with their hands, but this privilege is restricted within the penalty area and subject to specific rules and conditions. Violation of these rules might result in penalizing the offending team, potentially providing the opposing team with an advantage, such as a free kick or even a penalty kick if the infringement occurs within the penalty area."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Please answer the following question: Read the following paragraph and extract the answer for the question: Who is the client Dr. Cy Kosis joins on the couch?  The Goofy Gophers are about to harvest the vegetables on the farm when the farmhands beat them to the punch. Worried that their food source is being \\"vandalized,\\" they follow the truck to the barn so they can recover what they consider to be their food. However, they spot the guard dog and realize that if he were to awaken and spot them stealing the vegetables, he would cause them trouble. The Gophers spend most of the rest of the cartoon using psychological weardown tactics to drive Barnyard Dawg insane and remove him as a threat to their well-being. A deadpan pig watches as the dog is repeatedly the victim of the Gophers' pranks, and can only shake his head as the dog's psyche is broken down. Meanwhile, the pooch tries to convince himself that all that is going on is nothing but a bad dream (consulting Sigmund Fraud and using sleeping pills to laugh off each attempt). In the end, the Gophers get rid of their foe for good by tying a harness around the sleeping Barnyard Dawg's belly, then attaching it to a hot air balloon before launching it (getting a tear in at as it goes up), leaving them free to \\"raise their vegetables\\" into a long pipe leading from the barn to their burrow. Meanwhile, the balloon's hull leaks out completely, and the dog awakens atop a light pole. After he wakes up and realising his surroundings, Barnyard Dawg mentally snaps and begins to fly! The pig - confused about everything he has seen - goes to psychiatrist Dr. Cy Kosis for counseling. Kosis realizes he needs counseling (and joins his client on the couch) when he sees the Barnyard Dawg flying by the window.

Write a text based on this summary: candidates withdraw from local elections in nepal Text:","output":"Title: Unprecedented Wave of Withdrawals Hit Local Elections in Nepal In a surprising turn of events, numerous candidates have decided to withdraw from the upcoming local elections in Nepal. The move has left political analysts and the electorate questioning the state of democracy in the country. This unprecedented wave of withdrawals has the potential to reshape the political landscape and further complicate the already challenging process of democratic governance in Nepal. Nepal, a small landlocked country sandwiched between India and China, has experienced severe political turmoil in the past. The country transitioned to a democratic system of governance after years of autocratic rule and a decade-long civil war that ended in 2006. However, the journey towards establishing a stable political establishment has been fraught with challenges, including the elusive search for political consensus among various national and regional political players. The recent announcement by several candidates to withdraw from the local elections has intensified the ongoing debate surrounding the functionality and integrity of Nepal's political system. The reasons for these withdrawals are manifold but appear to stem from a combination of personal, political, and financial considerations. Firstly, some candidates have cited a lack of confidence in the electoral process as their primary reason for withdrawal. The increasing instances of violence and intimidation at the polls have led to heightened concerns about the safety and security of those running for office. Moreover, allegations of vote rigging and other forms of electoral malpractice have further undermined the credibility and trust in the electoral system. Another contributing factor is the dissatisfaction with the political parties themselves. Many candidates who have withdrawn from the race have cited disillusion with their party's internal workings and lack of transparency in the nomination process. The perception of nepotism and favoritism within party structures, along with the underrepresentation of women, ethnic minorities, and other marginalized groups, has led to an erosion of faith in the very institutions meant to uphold democratic values. Moreover, financial pressures have also caused some candidates to rethink their electoral ambitions. Running for office is an expensive endeavor, with significant outlays required for campaigns, advertising, and general logistics. For many prospective candidates, the daunting prospect of raising the necessary funds was enough to dissuade them from pursuing their political ambitions. It is worth noting that the wave of withdrawals has affected various political parties across the spectrum, with both the ruling and opposition parties witnessing a similar trend. This phenomenon serves to underscore the deep-rooted issues that plague the political system in Nepal. The implications of these withdrawals on the local elections are far-reaching and could significantly alter the political landscape at the grassroots level. The withdrawal of prominent candidates has the potential to pave the way for less experienced individuals to fill the positions. This could lead to a lack of qualified leadership, mismanagement, and incompetence – the very issues that a functioning local government needs to combat. Furthermore, these withdrawals have the potential to weaken the local democratic process by eroding public trust in the electoral system and reducing voter turnout. The absence of strong candidates may make people feel disillusioned by the electoral process and less likely to participate. The Nepalese government, the election commission, and political parties must take this issue seriously and strive to address the underlying factors responsible for this sudden exodus. Robust policy measures aimed at ensuring the safety and security of candidates, promoting transparency in the nomination process, addressing the underrepresentation of marginalized groups, and offering financial support to lesser-endowed candidates are just a few initiatives essential to bolster the electoral process. In conclusion, the recent wave of candidate withdrawals from local elections in Nepal signifies a concerning trend of disillusionment and instability within the political sphere. It is crucial for the success of democracy in the country that urgent and tangible steps are taken to redress these issues, thereby ensuring the integrity, credibility, and strength of local governance, and ultimately, the democratic process itself."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Given the question: Gasoline-powered vehicles emit a lot of harmful materials. Nitrogen oxides are formed when atmospheric nitrogen reacts with oxygen at the high temperatures found in a car engine. Carbon monoxide is a by-product of incomplete combustion of hydrocarbons. Evaporated and unused fuel releases volatile hydrocarbons into the atmosphere to help form smog. The presence of a catalytic converter in the exhaust system of the car causes these materials to react and be changed into less harmful products.

Which village emitted less carbon monoxide? The answer is:","output":"Mound village. Step 1: Identify the key information given in the question - Gasoline-powered vehicles emit harmful materials, including carbon monoxide. - Carbon monoxide is a by-product of incomplete combustion of hydrocarbons, which occurs in gasoline-powered vehicles. - Electric vehicles do not have gasoline engines, so they do not combust hydrocarbons. - Bend village used gasoline-powered vehicles. - Mound village used electric vehicles. - The question asks which village emitted less carbon monoxide. Step 2: Apply reasoning based on the key information Since carbon monoxide is a by-product of incomplete combustion of hydrocarbons, it is directly related to the use of gasoline-powered vehicles.

You will be given a task. You must generate a detailed and long answer. Background: Glaciers, while geographically restricted, are effective agents of landscape change. The gradual movement of ice down a valley causes abrasion and plucking of the underlying rock. Abrasion produces fine sediment, termed glacial flour. The debris transported by the glacier, when the glacier recedes, is termed a moraine. Glacial erosion is responsible for U-shaped valleys, as opposed to the V-shaped valleys of fluvial origin.The way glacial processes interact with other landscape elements, particularly hillslope and fluvial processes, is an important aspect of Plio-Pleistocene landscape evolution and its sedimentary record in many high mountain environments. Environments that have been relatively recently glaciated but are no longer may still show elevated landscape change rates compared to those that have never been glaciated. Nonglacial geomorphic processes which nevertheless have been conditioned by past glaciation are termed paraglacial processes. This concept contrasts with periglacial processes, which are directly driven by formation or melting of ice or frost.  Paragraph: Two geologists were researching agents of landscape change. Danny studied glaciated environments, while Manny researched those that have never been glaciated. They later compared and exchanged data.  Given the paragraph above, please answer correctly the following question: Which researcher studied less about abrasion? The answer to this question is:","output":"Manny studied less about abrasion. This is because Manny researched environments that have never been glaciated, and thus, his focus would have been on landscapes without the significant impact of glacial erosion, including abrasion. On the other hand, Danny studied glaciated environments where abrasion plays a crucial role in shaping the landscape and creating glacial flour due to the gradual movement of ice down a valley. As a result, Danny's research would have involved a more extensive focus on the process of abrasion as compared to Manny's research."},{"instruction":"Given a definition of a task and a sample input, break the definition into small parts.

It is used to assist in the growing of agricultural crops, maintenance of landscapes, and revegetation of disturbed soils in dry areas and during periods of inadequate rainfall. Additionally, irrigation also has a few other uses in crop production, which include protecting plants against frost, suppressing weed growth in grain fields and preventing soil consolidation. In contrast, agriculture that relies only on direct rainfall is referred to as rain-fed or dry land farming.  - New South Wales (abbreviated as NSW) is a state on the east coast of :Australia. It borders Queensland to the north, Victoria to the south, and South Australia to the west. It has a coast line with the Tasman Sea on its east side.

New South Wales' state capital is Sydney, which is also Australia's most populous city. , the estimated population of New South Wales was 7.5 million, making it Australia's most populous state. Just under two-thirds of the state's population, 4.67 million, live in the Greater Sydney area. Inhabitants of New South Wales are referred to as \\"New South Welshmen\\".  - In geography, a plain is a flat area. Plains occur as lowlands along the bottoms of valleys, coastal plains and as plateaus or uplands at high elevations. In a valley, a plain is enclosed on two sides but in other cases a plain may be delineated by a complete or partial ring of hills, by mountains or cliffs. Where a geological region contains more than one plain, they may be connected by a pass (sometime termed a gap). Plains may have been formed from flowing lava, deposited by water, ice, wind, or formed by erosion by these agents from hills and mountains.  - The Riverina  is an agricultural region of south-western New South Wales (NSW), Australia. The Riverina is distinguished from other Australian regions by the combination of flat plains, warm to hot climate and an ample supply of water for irrigation. This combination has allowed the Riverina to develop into one of the most productive and agriculturally diverse areas of Australia. Bordered on the south by the state of Victoria and on the east by the Great Dividing Range, the Riverina covers those areas of New South Wales in the Murray and Murrumbidgee drainage zones to their confluence in the west.  - Australia, officially the Commonwealth of Australia, is a country comprising the mainland of the Australian continent, the island of Tasmania and numerous smaller islands.

Given the context: How would you describe Bailey? pick from the following. [+] happy to be done with work; [+] tired and ready for bed; [+] busy; Answer:","output":"Based on the context provided, it would be appropriate to describe Bailey as a combination of tired and ready for bed and busy. The reason behind this characterization is as follows: 1. Tired and ready for bed: Bailey works at night, which implies that they might be following a nocturnal schedule and are often awake during the hours when most people are asleep. This can be quite physically and mentally draining due to the body's natural sleep cycle and the fact that the majority of people in society tend to be active during the day. Following a night shift, Bailey goes to the store early in the morning, which means that they likely have limited time to rest between work and their personal errands. This can certainly contribute to feelings of tiredness and the desire to go to bed once their tasks are completed. 2. Busy: In addition to working at night, Bailey also finds time to run errands such as going to the store early in the morning. This demonstrates that they have a packed schedule and a good amount of responsibilities, both professional and personal, to manage. As a result, it is quite conceivable that Bailey leads a busy life, trying to juggle multiple roles and tasks. While it is possible that Bailey may also be happy to be done with work, there is not enough context provided to confidently infer that emotion. Happiness could vary depending on their level of satisfaction with their job or personal circumstances, which the information given does not elucidate. In conclusion, based on the context available, Bailey can be best described as tired and ready for bed, as well as busy, given their night work schedule and early morning errands. Their happiness, on the other hand, cannot be reliably determined based on the details provided."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant that follows instruction extremely well.

Answer the following question: Process:  - Bacteria enters the body - Bloodstream - Cells in the body are attacked - Cells are killed - Different kinds of sickness are formed.  Perturbation hypothesis: suppose there is more bacteria present happens, how will it affect less bacteria enters the body.  Does the supposed perturbation have an effect (direct or indirect) on the process? Answer:","output":"The perturbation hypothesis considers alterations or disturbances in a system or process, which can cause changes in the dynamics of that system. In the context of the given question, the perturbation refers to the presence of either more or fewer bacteria than normal in the body. To analyze if this perturbation has an effect on the process, we must first understand the process itself. When bacteria enter the body, they pass through various barriers such as skin and mucous membranes before reaching the bloodstream. Once present in the bloodstream, the circulating bacteria will come into contact with various types of cells that constitute the immune system. These immune cells are designed to detect and eliminate pathogens, such as bacteria, from the body. When bacteria invade and attack cells in the body, the immune system responds with a heightened inflammatory response to try and destroy the bacteria. If the immune system is successful in this process, it will effectively protect the body from infection. However, if the immune system is unable to neutralize the bacteria or if the infection is left untreated, the spread and impact of the bacteria on the host's cells can lead to cell death. The death of these cells can result in different kinds of illness or sickness, depending on the specific type of bacteria and the organ system affected by the infection. Now, considering the perturbation hypothesis in this context, we will analyze how an altered amount of bacteria entering the body (either more or less than usual) could affect the process: 1. More bacteria entering the body: If more bacteria than normal are present in the body, the immune system will need to work harder to protect the host. The increased bacterial load may overwhelm the immune system and lead to a higher chance of cells being attacked and killed, resulting in more severe or prolonged sickness. The indirect effect of this can be the immune system becoming overloaded, causing a negative impact on overall health and potentially making the host more susceptible to other infections. Furthermore, administering antibiotics to treat the bacterial infection could potentially lead to antibiotic resistance due to the presence of a larger population of bacteria. 2. Less bacteria entering the body: If there is a lower amount of bacteria entering the body, the immune system may be more effective at neutralizing the pathogens before they can cause significant damage to cells. The reduced bacterial load can result in a quicker recovery time, with fewer cells being attacked and killed, and milder symptoms of sickness. An indirect effect of this scenario is that the host's immune system remains functional and does not become overwhelmed, maintaining a good level of overall health and a lower risk of secondary infections. In conclusion, the perturbation hypothesis, regarding the change in the amount of bacteria present in the body, can indeed have both direct and indirect effects on the process of bacterial infection. These effects can manifest themselves in the form of severity of sickness, immune system function, duration of illness, and potential development of antibiotic resistance. The overall health of the affected individual and the body's ability to combat infections depend on the balance between the bacterial load and the effectiveness of the immune response."},{"instruction":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

Which of the following statements best explains this difference? Select from: (i). Eukaryotic cells are smaller than prokaryotic cells. (ii). Eukaryotic cells have less DNA than prokaryotic cells. (iii). Eukaryotic cells have more cell walls than prokaryotic cells. (iv). Eukaryotic cells are more structurally complex than prokaryotic cells.","output":"(iv). Eukaryotic cells are more structurally complex than prokaryotic cells. To understand why eukaryotic cells do not divide as quickly as prokaryotic cells, it is crucial to know the differences between the two types of cells in terms of their size, genetic material, and structure. The statement that best explains this difference is that eukaryotic cells are more structurally complex than prokaryotic cells. Although some elements of the other statements might be true or contribute to the overall difference in cell division rates, the primary cause lies in their structural complexity. Size and DNA content: Eukaryotic cells are generally bigger than prokaryotic cells, and eukaryotic cells have more DNA than prokaryotic cells. In fact, eukaryotic cells have a true nucleus, which houses their genetic material, while prokaryotic cells lack a nucleus and have a single, circular DNA molecule floating in the cytoplasm. Thus, statements (i) and (ii) do not accurately explain the difference in replication speed. Cell walls: Statement (iii) is incorrect, as eukaryotic cells typically have fewer cell walls than prokaryotic cells. Among eukaryotes, fungi and plant cells have cell walls, while animal cells do not. Prokaryotic cells, however, generally have a cell wall, often consisting of peptidoglycan. Structural complexity: Eukaryotic cells are structurally more complex than prokaryotic cells, leading to a slower rate of cell division. This complexity results from the presence of numerous membrane-bound organelles found in eukaryotic cells, including the endoplasmic reticulum, Golgi apparatus, mitochondria, and chloroplasts in plant cells. Additionally, eukaryotic cells possess a more extensive and elaborate cytoskeleton than prokaryotic cells, which plays a crucial role in orchestrating cell division. The process of cell division in eukaryotes involves a series of carefully regulated steps, including DNA replication, chromosome condensation, and the dismantling and reformation of the nuclear envelope. The presence of multiple chromosomes also makes the segregation process more complicated in eukaryotes as compared to prokaryotes. Moreover, the mitotic spindle, which is involved in chromosome separation, has to be carefully assembled and disassembled during eukaryotic cell division. Prokaryotic cells, on the other hand, can divide more rapidly due to their simpler structure and relatively lower amount of genetic material. The process of prokaryotic cell division, called binary fission, is far less complicated than eukaryotic cell division and involves fewer steps. As a result, prokaryotic cells can reproduce much faster than eukaryotic cells, potentially dividing multiple times per hour. In conclusion, the primary reason eukaryotic cells do not divide as quickly as prokaryotic cells is their increased structural complexity. This complexity necessitates more extensive and intricate cellular processes during division, leading to a slower rate of reproduction compared to the simpler, more streamlined binary fission seen in prokaryotic cells."},{"instruction":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

The given statement is from the perspective of a decision-maker involved in negotiations. They are briefly explaining that they have resolved to continue the discussion regarding a new agreement between the European Union (EU) and Russia. This is despite the unspecified incidents that happened in Georgia in the month of August. It is insinuated that these events had the potential to disrupt or end these negotiations. To further understand the context, it's crucial to be aware that the EU and Russia have a vast, complex and significant relationship, encompassing an array of issues from trade and economic cooperation to security and political dialogue. This relationship has, however, often been characterized by tension and disagreement, influenced by various socio-political events, not least those that relate to Georgia, a country that has its own complicated history with Russia. In August, the time mentioned in the statement, there have been serious incidents involving Georgia and Russia in the past, most notably the Russo-Georgian War in August 2008. This five-day military conflict in the region of South Ossetia resulted in hundreds of deaths and had larger geo-political implications, straining relations between Russia and the Western world, including the EU. The decision-maker's statement, therefore, highlights an instance where, despite potential set-backs brought by unfavorable circumstances (as symbolised by the events in Georgia in August), the EU and Russia decided to move forward with their negotiations. This could be seen as an effort to prioritize diplomatic dialogue and cooperation over confrontation, recognizing the long-term importance of a solid agreement between these two entities.

In 1995, she auditioned for Michael Barrymore's My Kind of People.  In 1999, Boyle submitted a track for a charity CD to commemorate the Millennium produced at a West Lothian school. Only 1,000 copies of the CD, Music for a Millennium Celebration, Sounds of West Lothian, were pressed. An early review by Amber McNaught in the West Lothian Herald & Post said Boyle's rendition of \\"Cry Me a River\\" was \\"heartbreaking\\" and \\"had been on repeat in my CD player ever since I got this CD...\\" The recording found its way onto the internet following her first televised appearance and the New York Post said it showed that Boyle was \\"not a one-trick pony.\\" Hello! said the recording \\"cement[ed] her status\\" as a singing star.  In 1998, Boyle recorded three tracks--\\"Cry Me A River\\", \\"Killing Me Softly\\", and \\"Don't Cry for Me Argentina\\"--at Heartbeat Studio, Midlothian. She used all her savings to pay for a professionally cut demo, copies of which she later sent to record companies, radio talent competitions, local and national TV. The demo consisted of her versions of \\"Cry Me a River\\" and \\"Killing Me Softly with His Song\\"; the songs were uploaded to the Internet after her BGT audition.  After Boyle won several local singing competitions, her mother urged her to enter Britain's Got Talent and take the risk of singing in front of an audience larger than her parish church. Former coach O'Neil said Boyle abandoned an audition for The X Factor because she believed people were being chosen for their looks. She almost abandoned her plan to enter Britain's Got Talent believing she was too old, but O'Neil persuaded her to audition nevertheless. Boyle said that she was motivated to seek a musical career to pay tribute to her mother. Her performance on the show was the first time she had sung in public since her mother died.  In August 2008, Boyle applied for an audition for the third series of Britain's Got Talent (as contestant number 43212) and was accepted after a preliminary audition in Glasgow. When Boyle first appeared on Britain's Got Talent at the city's Clyde Auditorium, she said that she aspired to become a professional singer \\"as successful as Elaine Paige\\". Boyle sang \\"I Dreamed a Dream\\" from Les Miserables in the first round, which was watched by over 10 million viewers when it aired on 11 April 2009. Programme judge Amanda Holden remarked upon the audience's initially cynical attitude, and the subsequent \\"biggest wake-up call ever\\" upon hearing her performance.  Boyle was \\"absolutely gobsmacked\\" by the strength of the reaction to her appearance. Afterwards, Paige expressed interest in singing a duet with Boyle, and called her \\"a role model for everyone who has a dream\\". Boyle's rendition of \\"I Dreamed a Dream\\" was credited with causing a surge in ticket sales in the Vancouver production of Les Miserables. Cameron Mackintosh, the producer of the musical, also praised the performance, as \\"heart-touching, thrilling and uplifting\\".  Boyle was one of 40 acts that were put through to the semi-finals. She appeared last on the first semi-final on 24 May 2009, performing \\"Memory\\" from the musical Cats. In the public vote, she was the act to receive the highest number of votes to go through to the final. She was the clear favourite to win the final, but ended up in second place to dance troupe Diversity; the UK TV audience was a record of 17.3 million viewers.  The Press Complaints Commission (PCC) became concerned by press reports about Boyle's erratic behaviour and speculation about her mental condition and wrote to remind editors about clause 3 (privacy) of their code of press conduct. The day after the final, Boyle was admitted to The Priory, a private psychiatric clinic in London, Talkback Thames explained, \\"Following Saturday night's show, Susan is exhausted and emotionally drained.\\" Her stay in hospital attracted widespread attention, with Prime Minister Gordon Brown wishing her well. Cowell offered to waive Boyle's contractual obligation to take part in the BGT tour. Her family said \\"she's been battered non-stop for the last seven weeks and it has taken its toll [...but...] her dream is very much alive,\\" as she had been invited to the Independence Day celebrations at the White House.  Boyle left the clinic three days after her admission and said she would participate in the BGT tour. Despite health concerns, she appeared in 20 of the 24 dates of the tour, and was well received in cities including Aberdeen, Edinburgh, Dublin, Sheffield, Coventry, and Birmingham. The Belfast Telegraph stated that \\"Despite reports of crumbling under the pressure..., she exuded a confidence resembling that of a veteran who has been performing for years\\".  Boyle's first album, I Dreamed a Dream, was released on 23 November 2009. The album includes covers of \\"Wild Horses\\" and \\"You'll See\\" as well as \\"I Dreamed a Dream\\", and \\"Cry Me a River\\". In Britain, Boyle's debut album was recognised as the fastest selling UK debut album of all time selling 411,820 copies, beating the previous fastest selling debut of all time, Spirit by Leona Lewis.

It topped the Billboard chart for six straight weeks and although it narrowly failed to become the best-selling album of 2009, with sales of 3,104,000 compared to 3,217,000 for Taylor Swift's Fearless, it was one of only two albums to sell over 3 million copies in the US, and was also the top selling \\"physical\\" album of 2009, with only 86,000 of its sales coming from digital downloads. This has in turn garnered more media attention, as mentioned by People magazine.  In Italy, it was the first album of the month in the Italian No. 1 Account by a non-Italian artist ever. In only a week, it sold more than 2 million copies worldwide, becoming the fastest selling global female debut album.  On 13 December 2009 she appeared in her own television special \\"I Dreamed a Dream: the Susan Boyle Story\\", featuring a duet with Elaine Paige. It got ratings of 10 million viewers in the United Kingdom and in America was the TV Guide Network's highest rated television special in its history.  In November 2009 it was reported that Boyle's rendition of \\"I Dreamed a Dream\\" would be the theme song of the anime movie Eagle Talon The Movie 3 which was later released in Japan on 16 January 2010. Boyle performed for Pope Benedict XVI on his tour of Britain in 2010. In May 2010, Boyle was voted by Time magazine as the seventh most influential person in the world.

Playing in his 14th and final NBA All-Star Game in 2003, Jordan passed Kareem Abdul-Jabbar as the all-time leading scorer in All-Star Game history (a record since broken by Kobe Bryant). That year, Jordan was the only Washington player to play in all 82 games, starting in 67 of them. He averaged 20.0 points, 6.1 rebounds, 3.8 assists, and 1.5 steals per game. He also shot 45% from the field, and 82% from the free throw line. Even though he turned 40 during the season, he scored 20 or more points 42 times, 30 or more points nine times, and 40 or more points three times. On February 21, 2003, Jordan became the first 40-year-old to tally 43 points in an NBA game. During his stint with the Wizards, all of Jordans home games at the MCI Center were sold out, and the Wizards were the second most-watched team in the NBA, averaging 20,172 fans a game at home and 19,311 on the road. However, neither of Jordans final two seasons resulted in a playoff appearance for the Wizards, and Jordan was often unsatisfied with the play of those around him. At several points he openly criticized his teammates to the media, citing their lack of focus and intensity, notably that of the List of first overall NBA draft picks in the 2001 NBA draft, Kwame Brown.

One foggy night in Devon, Gail, a working border collie Herding dog, gives birth to a litter of three puppies, cozy in a barn on Borough Farm. As she lies quietly with her newborn litter, her father, Sir Gregory, walks inside, not realizing she had her puppies until she summons his attention and he spots them curled up next to her. She has already named two of them Storm and Drift but she thinks Sir Gregory should name the third. He looks out of the window and names her Mist after the \\"misty\\" night she was born. All the other dogs, Swift, her son Ernie, and Jake, are delighted to meet the puppies at last but Fern doesn't seem to like puppies and is not happy to be their auntie. When the puppies realize they can finally see things, Mist looks out of a nearby window and sees a flock of sheep pass by, but does not exactly know what they are. She points them out to Storm and Drift, but by the time they come to the window, the sheep are gone. They think Mist is making it up, and they playfully tease and wrestle each other around the barn. This soon tires them out, and they slowly fall asleep side by side. Mist seems to like the idea of working the flock more than her brother and sister. Later that day, Sir Gregory talks with Gail about how well Mist is doing compared to Storm and Drift. Gail realises it is finally time to choose which of the puppies will stay on Borough Farm to be trained as a working sheepdog, and which have to leave. One day the puppies are playing in the yard when two different families come to take Storm and Drift away. They are placed in the cars and Gail sadly watches them drive away. Winter arrives at Borough Farm, but Fern has still not warmed up to Mist. One day Mist gets giddy and runs off into the woods; a dark place where she soon gets lost and has to be rescued by the Boss and Sir Gregory. This amuses Fern.

A:","output":"No, the given answer, \\"His father, Lord Randolph Churchill, was a charismatic politician who served as Chancellor of the Exchequer; his mother, Jennie Jerome, was an American socialite,\\" would not be a reasonable answer to the question, \\"Where did Winston Churchill go to school?\\" The provided answer option focuses on the background of Winston Churchill's parents and does not address his educational history. A more suitable and detailed answer to the question would be: Winston Churchill attended several schools throughout his early life, which were pivotal in shaping his future as a prominent statesman and his contributions during World War II. Churchill's formal education began at St. George's School in Ascot, Berkshire, which he joined in 1882 at the age of eight. However, he struggled academically and did not enjoy his time at the school, partly due to the strict environment and frequent punishments. His poor performance led to his parents transferring him to Brunswick School in Hove in 1883, where he showed an aptitude for English, but his overall academic performance was still below average. In 1888, at the age of thirteen, Churchill joined Harrow School, an all-boys boarding school in London. Although his academic struggles continued, particularly in subjects like Latin and mathematics, he began to develop an interest in history and military strategy. He excelled in these areas, which would later prove essential to his political career and leadership during World War II. During his time at Harrow, Churchill also joined the Harrow Rifle Corps, where he gained practical experience in military drills and rifle shooting. After his time at Harrow, Churchill aimed to join the Royal Military College at Sandhurst, but it took him three attempts to pass the entrance exams. He was eventually accepted, and from 1893 to 1894, Churchill attended the Royal Military College, where he enjoyed the structured and disciplined environment. He graduated with honors and was commissioned as a second lieutenant in the 4th Queen's Own Hussars, shortly after which he embarked on the illustrious political and military career that would define his legacy. In conclusion, while the given answer option highlights Winston Churchill's family background, it does not address his educational history. To answer the question of where Winston Churchill went to school, it is essential to discuss institutions like St. George's School, Brunswick School, Harrow School, and the Royal Military College at Sandhurst, which played a significant role in molding his character and future achievements."},{"instruction":"Please answer the following question: Q: Met, asn, trp, and gln connect together like beads on a necklace and are an example of what type of acids?

As the can heats up, it may explode. The kinetic-molecular theory explains why. The air inside the rigid can of soup is given more kinetic energy by the heat coming from the campfire. The kinetic energy causes the air molecules to move faster and they impact the container walls more frequently and with more force. The increase in pressure inside may eventually exceed the strength of the can and it will explode. An additional factor is that the soup may begin boiling which will then aid even more gas and more pressure to the inside of the can.  and the situation: Two campers were in the woods over the week-end.

Besides a birthday and a couple dead parents, there wasn't much else we shared in common. She was an over-achiever and a bit of a kiss-ass, always trying to make mom and dad proud, which she seemed to pull off with ease. She was the girl in high school who played every sport, joined every club, ran the student council, and somehow still managed to pull A's without breaking a sweat. Intense doesn't even begin to describe her. I could never compete with that, so instead I decided to build an identity for myself as the rebel. Unfortunately, I somehow equated rebelling with turning into a giant asshole. We grew up in a middle-class suburban family. Our father was a teacher and our mother an architect. They were the kind of couple that kept a date night to go dancing every Friday for the 31 years they were married. They died when Jenny and I were twenty-two. We sold the house where we grew up and split the cash; neither of us wanted to set foot in it again. Jenny used the money to pay for her Master's. After school she went to work for James McPherson, one of the most powerful and richest men in the city. Aside from owning the St. Augustine, McPherson had interests in real estate, land development, venture capital, and other things I really should've known more about.

Gordon Parks, the prolific black Life magazine photographer, made a true ticking-timebomb of a movie here - one that does not mess around! Based upon the true story of two NYC cops - later dubbed Batman and Robin - who singlehandedly employed radical tactics to clean up their precinct neighborhood of drugs, this is a cop-buddy movie before that term became a repetitive formula. Lightning paced, there is not one unimportant throwaway scene here. Man, early '70s NYC must have been a terrible place to be a police officer, from the looks of movies like this and \\"Serpico.\\" These two cops start out as safety-division rookies, busting dealers in plainclothes in their spare time. But instead of receiving applause from the city police department, they receive nothing but resistance and antagonism from their peers. They have to singlehandedly navigate a minefield of police and legal corruption, boneheaded assignments meant to keep them from their work on the streets, ruthless drug kingpins, and a nasty ghetto neighborhood. Both David Selby and Ron Leibman are fantastic in the leads; part of the entertainment is watching Leibman's eyes darting around crazily in every scene in what is a flawless comic performance, and Selby's acting is low-key and wry. These two make all the comedy aspects of the story work - displaying a palpable frustration mixed with gutsy determination. Director Parks, who was already known for his coverage of controversial subjects in his photography, does not shy away from the grittiness of the story. Rather, the movie is uncompromising in portrayal of the toughness of the world of police and streets criminals that these two men inhabit. Adding to this realism is the fact that the real Hantz and Greenberg acted as technical advisors for the film, and even appear in surreal cameo roles as two fellow officers who ridicule the protagonists. It is a real tribute to the effectiveness of Parks' direction that he manages to perfectly balance this depressing mileu with bright comedy.

Article: Most of the time, we choose colors for decorating based on our personal taste and our sense of aesthetics  . But, a number of color experts believe that colors have an effect on our emotions and that it would be wise of us to be conscious of that before settling on a definite choice. Some of the effects of colors are well known and accepted by most people. In fact, those effects have been the subject of serious research and experiments and have been scientifically proven. But not all scientists agree on the validity   of the results. When we become interested in the psychological effects of colors, it is important to know that not all societies share our opinion of those effects on our emotions. What we hold as an \\"objective\\" observation on a color is often nothing more than a reflection of our cultural belongingness, which has attributed properties to that color for generations. Why is it not possible for us to hold a really objective discourse on the subject? In part, because it is very difficult to separate the psychological from the symbolic, the symbolic aspects are definitely cultural. Often, and this without our realizing it, they influence our understanding of colors and the following emotions - both psychological aspects. Black and white are good examples. In western countries, black is considered serious, dramatic and sometimes sad. People are warned against its potentially depressing effects on decoration. Black is the traditional color of mourning. White, on the other hand, is associated with purity, peace and optimism. For those reasons, white is the traditional color of bridal dresses. No one would think of attending a funeral in white. Any more than it would occur to a bride to wear black. We simply remain convinced that it is not in the \\"nature\\" of those colors.

Question: Why is it not possible for us to hold a really objective discourse on the subject? Answer: Answer:","output":"It is not possible for us to hold a really objective discourse on the subject of color and its psychological effects because the perception of colors and their meanings is influenced by various factors, most notably, cultural background and symbolic associations. Our interpretation of colors is often deeply rooted in the culture we belong to, which has been assigning specific meanings and traits to colors for generations. One of the main reasons it is challenging to separate the psychological from the symbolic aspects is that these symbolic associations are often so deeply ingrained in our understanding of colors that they influence our emotions and the way we perceive the world around us. These cultural associations can be passed down through generations, making it difficult to see colors without the filter of cultural symbolism. The example of black and white demonstrates how different cultural perspectives can shape our understanding of colors. In Western countries, black is typically associated with seriousness, drama, and sadness, while white is linked to purity, peace, and optimism. However, in certain Eastern cultures, the color white is actually associated with mourning, reflecting a completely different meaning. This cultural influence makes it challenging for people from different backgrounds to have a truly objective discussion about the psychological effects of colors. Furthermore, the scientific research on the effects of colors has not reached a consensus, and not all scientists agree on the validity of the results. This uncertainty in the scientific field adds another layer of complexity when trying to establish objectivity in discussing colors and their emotional impact. In summary, the main reason it is not possible for us to hold a truly objective discourse on the subject of color psychology is the significant influence of cultural backgrounds, symbolic associations, and differing scientific opinions. These factors create an intricate web of subjectivity that makes it challenging for individuals or groups to discuss and understand colors without personal and cultural biases."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

The band is known for their diverse musical style, incorporating elements of alternative rock, heavy metal, gothic rock, and electronica.  \\"1979\\" is a departure from the band's typical heavier sound, taking on a more melodic and dreamy approach. The lyrics explore themes of youth, nostalgia, and the fleeting nature of time. The song is memorable for its distinct guitar riff and Corgan's soft, introspective vocal delivery. The music video for \\"1979,\\" directed by Jonathan Dayton and Valerie Faris, depicts the band as teenagers driving around their suburban neighborhood wreaking havoc and attending a house party. The video's concept, like the song itself, explores a sense of youthful freedom and chaos, capturing both the excitement and the uncertainty of adolescence. \\"Mellon Collie and the Infinite Sadness,\\" the album that features \\"1979,\\" was released on October 24, 1995. The ambitious double album spans two hours and includes a wide range of musical styles, from heavy rock to mellow ballads. It received widespread critical acclaim and topped the Billboard charts upon its release. \\"1979\\" is considered one of The Smashing Pumpkins' most iconic and successful songs. It reached No. 12 on the Billboard Hot 100 and No. 1 on the Modern Rock Tracks chart. In addition, \\"1979\\" garnered a Grammy nomination for Best Rock Performance by a Duo or Group with Vocal, and its music video earned multiple nominations at the 1996 MTV Video Music Awards, winning Best Alternative Video. In summary, \\"1979\\" is a song by American alternative rock band, The Smashing Pumpkins. It was released as the second single from their third studio album, \\"Mellon Collie and the Infinite Sadness\\" on October 23, 1995, in the UK. The song's title, \\"1979,\\" is derived from Billy Corgan's birth year and serves as a tribute to the nostalgia of youth."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant that follows instruction extremely well.

Article: Most people think that the capital of the movie world is Hollyhood, in the United States. However, the real movie capital is Mumbai, in India. Mumbai used to be known as Bombay, and so the film industry there is called \\"Bollywood.\\" Bollywood makes twice as many movies each year as Hollyhood--more than 800 films a year. The movies from Bollywood are very different from Hollywood movies. For one thing, Bollywood movies are much longer than most Hollywood movies. Most Bollywood movies are more than three hours long, and contain singing, dancing, action, adventure, mystery, and romance (but usually no kissing). Because Bollywood films contain so many different features, this style of film is sometimes called a \\"masala\\" film. (\\"Masala\\" is an Indian word for a mixture of spices.) Another big difference between Bollywood and Hollywood movies is the way movies are made. It takes much longer to make a movie in Hollywood than in Bollywood. In fact, filming may begin on a Bollywood movie before the script even finished. The director and writers can make up the story while the film is being made. Sometimes they will even write the script by hand instead of taking time to type it. Bollywood actors are very popular and some are in such high demand that they may work on several movies at the same time. They may even shoot scenes for several films on the same day using the same costumes and scenery. Since most Bollywood movies follow the same kind of story, shooting scenes for several films at the same time is not a big problem for actors or directors. This also helps keep the cost of Bollywood movies lower than the cost of Hollywood movies. The average Bollywood film, with a budget of only two million U.S. dollars, seems very cheap compared to the average budget of sixty million U.S. dollars for a Hollywood film--thirty times as much! Question: What is NOT true about Mumbai? - It is the movie capital of India. - The new name is Bombay. - More movies are made there than in Hollywood. - It is less expensive to make films there than in Hollywood.

Without thinking we consult our internal list of “things that make me, ME” and find ourselves recalling words like “creative, outgoing, photography, guitar” before we’ve even had a chance to fully process the question. But how much does this internal list define us? I believed that my internal list was the best representation of myself until I read a quote by Annie Dillard that states: “How we spend our days, is of course, how we spend our lives”. This quote hit me like a punch in the gut, it’s blatant truth so indisputable; how I spent my days, regardless of what I told myself about myself, was ultimately who I was. Or at the very least would be how I had spent my life. This is why, when completing my self portrait, I decided to focus on the everyday. Within my self portrait I wanted to present the viewer with a familiar yet abstract sense of reality through which we get to see amalgamated glimpses of the everyday acts that define me, rather than a linear narrative or a simple re-telling of ‘a day in the life’. Thus combining to create a picture of: my daily life, through an abstracted version of ‘the everyday’. To create a sense of ‘the day’ or linear progression of time I segmented my video with four still images of the sky in various stages of daylight (morning, midday, afternoon, evening) that match the lighting seen in each concurrent video segment. The everyday acts that define me were presented in a series of short video segments that include scenes of me catching the tram, recording music and riding my bike. To disrupt the sense of linear narrative the visual segments are bluntly edited together, with nothing linking the sequential shots and a quite abrupt ending. I also attempted to create an overall sense of confounded time and space by overlaying audio from certain video segments onto others. Long, singular focus, handheld shots were also used to enhance the sense of voyeuristic glimpses. When do people use broad brushstrokes according to the author?

Its members consist of record labels and distributors, which the RIAA says \\"create, manufacture and/or distribute approximately 85% of all legally sold recorded music in the United States.\\" The RIAA headquarters is in Washington, D.C.  - Fiddle is another name for the bowed string musical instrument more often called a violin. It is also a colloquial term for the instrument used by players in all genres, including classical music. Fiddle playing, or fiddling, refers to various styles of music. Fiddle is also a common term among musicians who play folk music on the violin. The fiddle is part of many traditional (folk) styles of music which are aural traditions, taught 'by ear' rather than via written music. Fiddle is normally the term used for Irish Traditional Music.  - Country music is a genre of United States popular music that originated in the southern United States in the 1920s. It takes its roots from the southeastern genre of United States, such as folk music (especially Appalachian folk music), and blues music. Blues modes have been used extensively throughout its recorded history. Country music often consists of ballads and dance tunes with generally simple forms and harmonies accompanied by mostly string instruments such as banjos, electric and acoustic guitars, dobros and fiddles as well as harmonicas. According to Lindsey Starnes, the term \\"country music\\" gained popularity in the 1940s in preference to the earlier term \\"hillbilly music\\"; it came to encompass Western music, which evolved parallel to hillbilly music from similar roots, in the mid-20th century. The term \\"country music\\" is used today to describe many styles and subgenres. The origins of country music are the folk music of working-class Americans, who blended popular songs, Irish and Celtic fiddle tunes, traditional English ballads, and cowboy songs, and various musical traditions from European immigrant communities. In 2009 country music was the most listened to rush hour radio genre during the evening commute, and second most popular in the morning commute in the United States.  - \`\` Relentless '' is a song written by James LeBlanc and John Paul White and recorded by American country music artist Jason Aldean . It was released in May 2008 as the third and final single from his 2007 album of the same name . The song peaked at number 15 on the Billboard Hot Country Songs in late 2008 .  - The word Dobro is, in popular usage, the generic term for a wood-bodied, single cone resonator guitar. It is also an American brand of resonator guitar, currently owned by the Gibson Guitar Corporation. The Dobro was originally made by the Dopyera brothers when they formed the Dobro Manufacturing Company. Their design, with a single inverted resonator, was introduced in competition to the patented Tricone and biscuit designs produced by the National String Instrument Corporation. The Dobro name appeared on other instruments, notably electric lap steel guitars and solid body electric guitars and on other resonator instruments such as Safari resonator mandolins.  - Broken Bow Records is an American independent record label based in Nashville, Tennessee. Founded in July 1999 by Benny Brown, the label specializes in country music. The label's general manager is Jon Loba.  - Europe is a continent that comprises the westernmost part of Eurasia. Europe is bordered by the Arctic Ocean to the north, the Atlantic Ocean to the west, and the Mediterranean Sea to the south.

Question: \\"What type of media did Norte Dame have for those who listened to news on ear buds but not visually\\"  Context: \\"As at most other universities, Notre Dame's students run a number of news media outlets. The nine student-run outlets include three newspapers, both a radio and television station, and several magazines and journals. Begun as a one-page journal in September 1876, the Scholastic magazine is issued twice monthly and claims to be the oldest continuous collegiate publication in the United States. The other magazine, The Juggler, is released twice a year and focuses on student literature and artwork. The Dome yearbook is published annually. The newspapers have varying publication interests, with The Observer published daily and mainly reporting university and other news, and staffed by students from both Notre Dame and Saint Mary's College. Unlike Scholastic and The Dome, The Observer is an independent publication and does not have a faculty advisor or any editorial oversight from the University. In 1987, when some students believed that The Observer began to show a conservative bias, a liberal newspaper, Common Sense was published. Likewise, in 2003, when other students believed that the paper showed a liberal bias, the conservative paper Irish Rover went into production. Neither paper is published as often as The Observer; however, all three are distributed to all students. Finally, in Spring 2008 an undergraduate journal for political science research, Beyond Politics, made its debut.\\"  Answer: A:","output":"Notre Dame had a radio station for those who listened to news on earbuds but not visually. Step 1: Analyze the context provided In the context, it is mentioned that Notre Dame's students run a number of news media outlets, including newspapers, a radio and television station, and several magazines and journals. Step 2: Identify the type of media suitable for earbuds Considering the media options listed, the radio station would be the most suitable type of media for those who listen to news on earbuds but not visually, as radio broadcasts are primarily audio-based. Step 3: Respond with the relevant type of media Based on the analysis, it becomes clear that the suitable media outlet for those who listened to news on earbuds, but not visually, was the Notre Dame radio station."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Subtract the constant term (1209) from both sides of the equation to isolate the term with the variable. This helps to get rid of any constants that don't involve the variable we're solving for. 119*h + 1209 - 1209 = 19 - 1209 119*h = -1190 3. Now we have an equation where the left side is only a multiplication of the variable (h) and a constant (119). To solve for h, we need to undo the multiplication and isolate the variable. To do this, divide both sides of the equation by the constant (119) in front of the variable (h). (119*h) / 119 = -1190 / 119 h = -10 4. Now we've solved for h.

WASHINGTON — U.S. President Barack Obama has shortened the sentences of 214 inmates of U.S. federal prisons, in what the White House called the largest batch of commutations on a single day in more than a century. The early release is part of Obama's effort to correct what he views as unreasonably long mandatory minimum sentences. The president's push to lessen the burden on nonviolent drug offenders reflects his long-stated view that the nation should remedy the consequences of decades of onerous sentencing rules, which have put tens of thousands of Americans behind bars for far too long. Among those affected by Wednesday's presidential order were 67 individuals serving life sentences - almost all for nonviolent drug crimes, although a few also were charged with firearms violations related to their drug activities. To date, Obama has granted 562 commutations, more than the previous nine presidents combined, and more clemency actions that by any other president in nearly a century. White House counsel Neil Eggleston said in the White House blog that Obama examines each clemency application on its specific merits to identify the appropriate relief, including whether the prisoner would be helped by additional drug treatment, educational programs or counseling. Presidents tend to use their powers to commute sentences or issue pardons more frequently near the end of their terms of office. Administration officials said the rapid pace will continue before Obama's leaves the White House in January 2017. \\"We are not done yet,\\" Deputy Attorney General Sally Yates said. \\"We expect that many more men and women will be given a second chance through the clemency initiative.\\" Obama has long called for phasing out strict sentences for drug offenses, arguing they lead to excessive punishment and incarceration rates unseen in other developed countries. With presidential support, the Justice Department in recent years has directed prosecutors to rein in the use of harsh mandatory minimums. Eggleston once again called on...

Here are possible answers to this question: - eye - clam - bathing suit - shoes - beach  I believe the correct choice is \\"eye\\", here's why:","output":"The correct choice is indeed \\"eye,\\" and there are several key reasons why a grain of sand in the eye can cause a person substantial discomfort and potentially damage their sight.  First, let us consider the structural and functional aspects of the human eye. The eye is a delicate and highly sensitive organ, featuring multiple components working together to provide our sense of sight. Key components include the cornea, iris, pupil, lens, retina, and the optic nerve, amongst others. Each of these components plays a specific role in the overall process of vision, and any direct damage or irritation to any of these parts can result in disruption of that process. Now, let's examine how and why a grain of sand can inflict pain and potentially harm these components: 1. Corneal abrasion: The cornea is the transparent outer layer at the front of the eye, responsible for refracting light onto the lens and retina. A grain of sand coming into direct contact with the cornea can cause corneal abrasion or a scratch to the surface. Because the cornea has a high concentration of nerve endings, even a tiny scratch can cause significant pain, tearing, and sensitivity to light. 2. Inflammation: When a foreign object, like a grain of sand, enters the eye, the body's natural response is to produce inflammation. This can manifest itself as redness, swelling, and discomfort in the affected area. Prolonged inflammation may even lead to complications in vision or cause other eye-related issues. 3. Infection: If the grain of sand carries bacteria or other pathogens, and it lodges itself within the eye, it can introduce infection to the sensitive ocular structures. Left untreated, such an infection can cause further inflammation, pain, and potentially permanent damage to one's sight. 4. Irritation to other structures: Apart from the cornea, a grain of sand could also irritate other structures within the eye, such as the conjunctiva – the clear, thin membrane that covers the sclera (white part) and inside of the eyelids. This could lead to conjunctivitis, also known as \\"pink eye\\", which can be highly uncomfortable and contagious in some forms. In comparison to the other options listed - clam, bathing suit, shoes, and beach - none of these alternatives pose a direct threat to one's sight and intense pain in the same manner that a grain of sand can when it enters the eye. These alternatives may indeed cause discomfort in other ways, such as a grain of sand within a shoe causing abrasion on the foot, or sand in a bathing suit leading to chafing; however, these scenarios do not present the same level of risk to a person's vision as the \\"eye\\" option does. In conclusion, a grain of sand entering the eye can be not only incredibly painful but can also lead to complications such as corneal abrasion, inflammation, infection, and damage to other ocular structures. For these reasons, the \\"eye\\" is the correct choice in answering the question of where a grain of sand can cause a person the most pain and potential sight-related issues."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Possible answers: A. no; B. yes;","output":"A. No, the questions have different meanings. The first question asks about how a decrease in oil prices can affect people's everyday life. When oil prices go down, it usually means things like gasoline for cars and other things that use oil become cheaper. This can make people happy because they save money when they fill up their cars with gas or use things made from oil. The second question is about an agreement or MoU (Memorandum of Understanding) between India and Abu Dhabi to store some of Abu Dhabi's crude oil in India's reserves. This might affect global oil prices in the future, but it's not the same as asking how a decrease in oil prices affects people's lives directly.

I had drunk too much, I confess, though we all had. Somehow, Tasha and I began to argue the worth of Solevgrad jazz, as inconsequential a topic as I can imagine. She had studied it in school, so she thought herself as an expert. I once had a neighbor who played it constantly, loudly, and badly, so I thought I knew it better. Malaquez tried to mediate, but I saw him as siding with Tasha. So, I think, did she. The subject shifted from music to Tasha's obsession with fame, undoubtedly by a leap that I made. She had no choice but to follow. (I do not remember any of this well, just now, nor do I care to.

Atta and Omari boarded a 6:00 A.M. flight from Portland to Boston's Logan International Airport. When he checked in for his flight to Boston, Atta was selected by a computerized prescreening system known as CAPPS (Computer Assisted Passenger Prescreening System), created to identify passengers who should be subject to special security measures.

Please answer the following question: I can use this background: Biodiversity loss is the extinction of species (plant or animal) worldwide, and also the local reduction or loss of species in a certain habitat.  The latter phenomenon can be temporary or permanent, depending on whether the environmental degradation that leads to the loss is reversible through ecological restoration / ecological resilience or effectively permanent (e.g. through land loss). Global extinction has so far been proven to be irreversible.  Even though permanent global species loss is a more dramatic phenomenon than regional changes in species composition, even minor changes from a healthy stable state can have dramatic influence on the food web and the food chain insofar as reductions in only one species can adversely affect the entire chain (coextinction), leading to an overall reduction in biodiversity, possible alternative stable states of an ecosystem notwithstanding. Ecological effects of biodiversity are usually counteracted by its loss. Reduced biodiversity in particular leads to reduced ecosystem services and eventually poses an immediate danger for food security, also for humankind.[1]  Now, I have a new situation: Two islands of identical size with similar ecosystems experienced different destinies. Caribu island, inhabited by more natives, hunted a few of the animal species there, contributing to the extinction of a few. People from Hiji island, were pescotarian, and hardly ever fished.  Answer this question please: Which island experienced more environmental degradation? A:","output":"Caribu island experienced more environmental degradation due to the overhunting of a few animal species, contributing to their extinction. Although both islands have similar ecosystems and are identical in size, the difference in human behavior and their impact on the flora and fauna of each island led to distinct environmental outcomes. Caribu island's natives hunted multiple animal species, which likely caused local reduction or loss of species in their habitat. This decline in the number of animal species ultimately led to a decrease in local biodiversity. When biodiversity loss occurs, it can have a cascading impact on the entire ecosystem. Food webs and food chains become disrupted, as the extinction or reduction of a single species can adversely affect all other organisms that depend on it, whether directly or indirectly. On the other hand, Hiji island had inhabitants that were pescatarian and rarely fished. This indicates that the people of Hiji island had a lesser impact on the habitats and populations of local species. As a result, the island's biodiversity was likely more stable and resilient, allowing the ecosystem to maintain a healthier balance of flora and fauna. The ecological effects of biodiversity loss are usually countered by efforts to preserve or restore the affected ecosystems. However, in the case of Caribu island, the permanent extinction of some species means that the consequences are irreversible, leaving lasting harm to the environment. Reduced biodiversity also leads to decreased ecosystem services, negatively affecting the quality of life not only for the native inhabitants who depend on the surrounding environment for various resources but also posing a threat to global food security. Therefore, it is reasonable to conclude that Caribu island experienced more environmental degradation as compared to Hiji island due to the human activities and their impacts on the local biodiversity."},{"instruction":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

Please answer the following question: In this article, I’ll address a real mainstay of modern medicine: laboratory tests that require drawing blood. This is sometimes referred to as “checking labs,” “doing bloodwork,” or even “checking blood.” Most older adults have been through this. For instance, it’s pretty much impossible to be hospitalized without having bloodwork done, and it’s part of most emergency room care. Such testing is also often done as part of an annual exam, or “complete physical.” Last but not least, blood testing is usually — although not always — very helpful when it comes to evaluating many common complaints that affect aging adults. Fatigued and experiencing low energy? We should perhaps check for anemia and thyroid problems, among other things. Confused and delirious? Bloodwork can help us check on an older person’s electrolytes (they can be thrown off by a medication side-effect, as well as by other causes). Blood tests can also provide us with information related to infection, kidney function, and much more. Like much of medical care, blood testing is probably overused. But often, it’s an appropriate and an important part of evaluating an older person’s health care concerns. So as a geriatrician, I routinely order or recommend blood tests for older adults. Historically, laboratory results were reviewed by the doctors and were only minimally discussed with patients and families. But today, it’s becoming more common for patients to ask questions about their results, and otherwise become more knowledgeable about this aspect of their health. In fact, one of my top recommendations to older adults and family caregivers is to always request a copy of your laboratory results. (And then, keep it in your personal health record!) This way, if you ever have questions about your health, or need to see a different doctor, you’ll be able to quickly access this useful information about yourself.

PUBLISHED:. 06:32 EST, 13 November 2012. |. UPDATED:. 05:03 EST, 14 November 2012. The crippling rise in university tuition fees has fuelled the biggest increase in the cost of living for more than a year, official figures revealed yesterday. Inflation jumped to 2.7 per cent in October, up from 2.2 per cent in September. This means it has been above the Government target of two per cent since November 2009, when it stood at 1.9 per cent. The Consumer Prices Index rate of inflation rose to 2.7 per cent - a bigger-than-expected increase after falling steadily since June. The rise of nearly 20 per cent in. education costs helped push up the figure, said the Office for National. Statistics. It is the largest monthly increase in this category since. its records began in 1996. Tuition fees rose to up to £9,000 a year from September. Andrew Goodwin, of accountants’ Ernst. & Young’s ITEM Club, said the sharp rise in the Consumer Price. Index was ‘a very nasty surprise’ at a time when Britons are still. suffering a squeeze on their incomes. The ONS figures also showed that the price of essentials was still rising. Between September and October,. clothes and shoes cost 1.2 per cent more and food jumped 0.5 per cent,. with the rise blamed mainly on meat, fish, fruit and sugar. The cost of living has risen sharply, fuelled by increases in food prices and the trebling of tuition fees. The Treasury said the figures were. ‘disappointing’ as experts predicted the Consumer Prices Index would. break through three per cent by the New Year. Inflation had been steadily falling in recent months after peaking at 5.2 per cent in September 2011. But the rate of rises in prices. continues to outstrip pay increases for those in work, leaving millions. of families worse off every month in real terms. The ONS said education costs jumped by 19.1 per cent last month - the largest increase since records began. It follows the government’s decision to increase tuition fees from £3,375 to up to £9,000. The decision to increase tuition fees to £9,000, which triggered angry protests and clashes between students and police, has fuelled a sharp rise in inflation. Terrible. weather this summer has blighted crops, in particular potatoes and. carrot harvests. As a result food prices have risen sharply. Since. last month’s most of the big energy firms have announced major. increases in prices which are likely to bump up inflation in the coming. weeks and months. Some experts think CPI could reach 3.5 per cent by the middle of next year. James Knightley, an economist at ING Bank, said he expected inflation to rise to 3 per cent by January.Economist Samuel Tombs, of Capital Economics, said the inflation data provides an ‘uncomfortable backdrop’ to the Bank of England’s inflation report tomorrow. ‘Nonetheless, we still think that the weakness of economic activity will bring inflation down further in time,’ he added. This week the government managed to quell a rebellion from Tory backbenchers over a planned 3p rise in fuel duty with a promise that more help for hard-pressed families will be announced in next month's autumn budget. Catherine McKinnell, Labour’s shadow treasury minister, said: ‘This is a worrying increase in the inflation rate. But instead of easing the squeeze, the Government is adding to the cost of living crisis for people on low and middle incomes.’","output":"This news article tells us that the cost of living for people in the UK went up a lot because of university tuition fees getting higher. Inflation, which is when prices of things we buy go up, increased from 2.2% to 2.7% in October 2012. The price of things like clothes, shoes, and food also went up, making life harder for many families. The government says they are disappointed with these numbers and they think they will keep going up. This is important because when prices go up, it can be tough for people to afford what they need."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant. You will be given a task.

Iterate through the list to compare each element with the current max_value and min_value, updating them accordingly. 4. For 1, since it's smaller than min_value (22):    - Update min_value: min_value = 1 5.

Please write a short summary for the following article: Visualizing 'Officer-Involved' Deaths Across America: Photos A cookie-cut subdivision, a mall parking lot, a rural country road. Linking these unremarkable pockets of America, and hundreds of places just as ordinary, is the fact that they’ve all been sites where people were killed by U.S. police officers in a variety of situations. Josh Begley, a research editor at The Intercept, an investigative journalism outlet focused on governance, surveillance, civil liberties and security, launched the project Officer Involved to visualize these dispersed locations, creating an ever-evolving portrait of death with each site represented by a Google Maps screen grab or by a Google Street View still image. Both the detachment of the Maps birds-eye-view and the soft-focus and warped perspective of Google Street View have the effect of unnerving the viewer. The accompanying caption info is simply the victim’s name followed by the city and state where death occurred. Officer Involved “is an immersion in the environment of someone’s last moments,” writes Teju Cole in the introduction to the project, with the relentlessness of Google’s mechanical eyes and capture ratcheting a mood of disturbed natural order that runs through the work. “It’s a lot of ghosted intersections,” says Begley. The names of Michael Brown, Eric Garner, and Tamir Rice are etched in our collective memory, inspiring the Black Lives Matter movement and igniting a national debate about violence, institutional racism and police oversight. However, for the few names we know and remember, there are hundreds that are quickly forgotten, if acknowledged at all. One of the more remarkable things about Officer Involved is that the data upon which it is built did not exist until very recently. In the wake of the high profile killings such as Garner, Brown and Rice, journalists, activists and politicians alike wanted answers. However, solid statistics were not readily available. Police forces, sheriff departments and federal agencies had not been required to keep figures on officer-involved deaths and there certainly was no central database. Fatal Encounters a database administered by Reno News & Review journalist D. Brian Burghart has slowly amassed records on officer-involved deaths dating back to the year 2000, but real-time statistics have never been reliably accessible. Until now. Early in 2015, The Guardian set about sourcing and presenting information in The Counted, which uses local news reports, among other sources, to count the death. Yet, Begley cannot be sure The Counted has a complete set of data. He is confident, however, that The Counted is the most complete data set out there. “The Guardian has a team of top-notch journalists—and the weight of a great institution behind them,” says Begley. “In the absence of official data, theirs is the best we’ve got.” In 2016, Federal authorities intend to catch up to the watchdog efforts of journalists. In December 2015, the FBI announced the launch of a database counting officer involved deaths. It has, for the past decade, underestimated the deaths by over 50% citing annual figures of 423, when The Guardian counted 1136 in 2015 alone. Politicians in some states have also begun efforts to chart figures in their own jurisdictions. In September, California’s Attorney General Kamala Harris launched OpenJustice, a transparency initiative that tracks arrests, custody and arrest-related deaths and the assault and killing of law enforcement officers. For Officer Involved, Begley uses two bits of code that rely heavily on Google’s Geocoding API, which converts addresses into geographic coordinates. The journalist ran one set of locations against the Static Maps API, and another set against the Street View API. (You can find a sample of the code here.) Begley conceived of the idea with Maya Raiford-Cohen, a young writer who has reported on the #BlackLivesMatter movement, among other things. When The Guardian published The Counted, Raiford-Cohen and Begley were both at an academic conference in Florence, Italy about black portraiture. Under a Tuscan sun, more than 5,000 miles from the deaths that concerned them, they pored over the information. “One of the first things Maya saw was how complete many of the data fields appeared to be—there are street addresses, for instance—so I started playing with the Google Maps API and examining what the data might be able to show us.” It didn’t take long for Begley to modify the script. Sensitively pairing the visuals with the memory of a human life cut short was much more taxing. “The bulk of my time was spent looking at the photographs,” says Begley. “Modifying Street View angles, and trying to sit still with the notion of premature death.” So far, Begley has generated 615 tiles, representing a little over half of the deaths recorded by The Guardian in 2015 alone. The Intercept rolled out Officer Involved in June 2015 yet, inasmuch as Begley is interpreting others’ reporting, he insists that the project is art, not journalism. He also maintains a perspective about the extent, or not, to which Officer Involved shifts the conversation. “Credit where it’s due: Mariame Kaba, Mervyn Marcano, Jesse Williams, Ashley Yates, dream hampton and the #BlackLivesMatter founders—Alicia Garza, Patrisse Cullors and Opal Tometi—have all done more to change the conversation about race and policing in this country than any visualization of data ever could.” Still, some are moved by visual “evidence” more than words or statistics. Sometimes an image gets to the point more directly. For those people, Begley and Raiford-Cohen’s Officer Involved is another point of entry into our current and urgent discussions about race and policing. Pete Brook is an independent writer and curator whose work focuses incarceration, power and images. He is founder of Prison Photography and editor of Vantage.

And the answer is?","output":"The drink sometimes referred to as \\"Adam's ale\\" is water. This expression is derived from the biblical story of Adam, the first human created by God in the religious narratives of Christianity, Islam, and Judaism. The term \\"Adam's ale\\" implies that water was the only drink available to Adam in the Garden of Eden and symbolizes the pure and natural state of life during that time. Furthermore, it suggests that water is essential to all humans' existence and survival, as it would have been for Adam himself. Water is a fundamental and indispensable resource for everyone, as it is vital for numerous bodily functions, such as maintaining temperature, conducting metabolic processes, and providing the means for absorbing nutrients. Additionally, water is a part of implementing proper hygiene practices and contributing to our overall health.  Historically, expressions like \\"Adam's ale\\" often arose from cultures or communities that valued purity or cleanliness in their daily lives. For example, during the Middle Ages, some people were known to avoid consuming alcoholic beverages, as they believed such substances were detrimental to their health or spirituality. On the other hand, clean water symbolized virtue and discipline by representing the original state of life. In summary, the drink known as \\"Adam's ale\\" refers to water, drawn from the biblical narrative of Adam, the first human, and represents the purity and importance of water throughout human history. As a fundamental resource for all life, water is crucial for our survival and maintaining overall well-being."},{"instruction":"User will you give you a task with some instruction.

Article: Sometimes the best advice doesn't come from a book, a microphone, from behind a desk in Washington or even from the people who are the leaders in their fields. Sometimes the best life lessons are found deep in the roots of where we came from. My father passed away years ago, but I always remember the lessons he taught me. Three of them particularly shape my perspective day after day.  The first one is that little things make big things happen. To the best of my memory, when I was young, we needed to build a new shed. Those were the days when stores like Home Depot and Lowes didn't exist. Brand-new timber   was expensive, so folks often reused the materials that others in the community didn't need. That summer, Dad and I used the boards from an old abandoned barn. We pulled them down one by one, drew the nails out and took off the tin and straightened it in order to reuse it. We got our supplies back to our yard and got to work. I don't know how much of a help I really was, but I chose to stay beside Dad the entire period, working along with him. The sun was hot that day, and sweat formed and ran down our faces. I stood there and handed him the nails one by one, which were hammered into that shed. Dad made me feel proud of my work. Even though I just handed him the nails, he repeatedly emphasized how we built the new shed \\"together\\". He taught me that when you're willing to do hard work, even in little things, big things come together. The second one is that we should honor our promises. As a young man, my father always carried a pocket-sized Bible in his chest pocket. Shortly before the invasion of Normandy in 1944, he prayed for God's protection and promised God that if he made it home, he would make sure his family attended church every Sunday. Well, he made it home and he kept that promise. I cannot remember a Sunday when Dad did not take my mother, my siblings and me to church -- even when we were away on vacation. I now have my Dad's pocket Bible. It is one of my most treasured possessions, and it serves...

The popular Ariana Grande look swept the school and Angela became more popular than Betty because","output":"of her uncanny resemblance to the pop star. Her long high ponytail, winged eyeliner, and oversized sweatshirts became the ultimate style inspiration for many of the students. Here's how it all began and the consequences it had on the school's social dynamics. Step 1: Recognizing the trend Initially, it was a handful of trend-savvy students who started replicating Ariana Grande's look by adopting her hairstyles and makeup techniques. Slowly but surely, the style began to gain traction as more and more students joined the bandwagon. The trend was mostly fueled by the endless admiration for Ariana Grande and her extraordinary style, which girls across campus wanted to recreate. Step 2: Angela's transformation Angela, a relatively average girl in terms of popularity, took on the challenge of replicating the Ariana Grande look more intensively than anyone else. She spent hours researching different makeup tutorials and carefully studying Ariana's fashion choices. With her naturally similar facial features, it wasn't long before Angela emerged as the perfect embodiment of the pop icon, further popularizing the trend and captivating the attention of both her peers and teachers. Step 3: The shift in popularity As Angela's transformation became more noticeable, she started receiving compliments and admiration from students and even teachers. This newfound attention significantly boosted her self-confidence and social standing. She began hanging out with a more popular crowd, and as a result, her friendship with Betty—once her best friend—started fading. Step 4: The growing divide between Angela and Betty Betty, who had always been a popular girl at school, could not keep up with the Ariana Grande trend. Her attempts to replicate the style were futile, making her feel increasingly left out of the new social circle. The growing distance between her and Angela eventually led to both emotional and social consequences: Betty's jealousy and insecurity increased, and she found herself losing friends to the ever-growing \\"Ariana\\" fan club. Step 5: The impact on the school's social landscape The Ariana Grande trend elevated Angela's social status and reshaped the school's popularity hierarchy. Cliques formed around those who could pull off the Ariana look best, leaving others like Betty feeling alienated or rejected. The once-harmonious school environment slowly turned into a battleground of competition, with people constantly vying for attention and trying to outdo each other in terms of style — with Angela as their ultimate inspiration. In conclusion, the Ariana Grande look created a seismic shift in the social dynamic of the school. Angela's successful transformation into an Ariana doppelgänger led to the disruption of friendships, a new hierarchy based on style and appearance, and a culture of emulation and competition among students. While this change awarded Angela fame and acclaim, it also brought along less desirable consequences, as friendships became collateral damage in the pursuit of popularity."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

After about 30 minutes he had completed this and then offered as a free service to inspect the electrical parts of the house. He went out back to the fuse box to look and then after inspection offered to show me what he had found. It was mid to late afternoon in the back yard and that’s when the sun is aiming straight to my back yard. I should mention we live in Texas. He went over ever single fuse and wire that we had and explained about the piping and all the other things that go with it and that what we have isn’t what is recommended anymore.

There is no ambiguity or confusion in the message being conveyed. 4. Completeness: The sentence is complete and does not leave the reader wondering about any missing information. It provides enough information about the subject, verb, and object to create a coherent idea. 5. Tense and Agreement: The verb \\"hunt\\" is in the present tense, which is appropriate because the sentence is describing a general fact about the activities of tigers. Furthermore, the subject \\"tigers\\" agrees with the verb \\"hunt\\" in this case, as both of them are plural in form. This agreement is essential for linguistic acceptability. In conclusion, a linguist would rate the sentence \\"The tigers hunt prey at night.\\" to be linguistically acceptable because it follows the rules of English syntax, uses standard vocabulary, conveys a clear meaning, has a complete structure, and maintains tense and subject-verb agreement."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Is it possible to conclude that if the premise is true, then so is the hypothesis?","output":"To analyze the relationship between the premise and the hypothesis, let's break down each statement and think step by step. Premise: \\"But while creativity may exist, it doesn't necessarily exist over and over again.\\" This statement acknowledges the existence of creativity, but suggests that it might not be a recurring phenomenon. Hypothesis: \\"Creativity exists over and over again throughout time.\\" This statement claims that creativity is indeed a recurring phenomenon that happens repeatedly across time. Now, considering the relationship between the premise and the hypothesis: Step 1: Identify if the statements are in agreement or disagreement. The premise and the hypothesis disagree with each other, as one suggests creativity might not be recurring, while the other asserts that it is. Step 2: Determine if one statement contradicts or negates the other. The premise suggests that the recurrence of creativity is uncertain (\\"doesn't necessarily exist over and over again\\"), while the hypothesis declares that it does. They have conflicting viewpoints but the premise does not completely dismiss the possibility of the recurring creativity. Step 3: Assess whether one statement can support the other as true. Since the premise leaves room for doubt regarding the recurrence of creativity, it doesn't necessarily invalidate the hypothesis, but it also doesn't support it.  Conclusion: Based on the analysis, it is not possible to conclude that if the premise is true, then the hypothesis is true. The premise and hypothesis have opposing viewpoints, and the premise does not provide enough evidence or foundation for the hypothesis to be proven true."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant that follows instruction extremely well.

Step 1: Analyze the first sentence In the sentence \\"Blow on the soup to cool it down,\\" \\"blow\\" serves as a verb meaning to exhale air gently through the lips. The purpose of blowing in this context is to reduce the temperature of the soup. Step 2: Analyze the second sentence In the sentence \\"The fuse blew,\\" \\"blew\\" is the past tense of the verb \\"blow.\\" Here, it means a sudden and powerful release of energy caused by an electrical overload, resulting in the failure of the fuse. The purpose of blowing in this context is to protect the electrical circuit by stopping the current when it becomes excessive. Step 3: Compare the meanings and contexts of the two sentences In the first sentence, \\"blow\\" means to exhale air gently to cool something down. In the second sentence, \\"blow\\" refers to a sudden release of energy causing a fuse to fail. The meanings are different.

Back when I worked in a primary care clinic, this is when we made a big push to offer the seasonal flu shot to all of our patients. (And we got ourselves immunized, as well.) Not all of our patients agreed. Many older adults are skeptical of the need to get a yearly vaccination against influenza. They aren’t sure it will help. Or they think that the vaccination will actually give them a mild case of the flu. Or they just don’t like needles. Or maybe they aren’t sure which type of seasonal flu shot to get: the regular one or one of the newer “stronger” versions, designed for older adults? I’m never surprised when people bring up these questions. Vaccination for seasonal influenza can indeed be a confusing topic. But it’s certainly important to consider. Depending on the year, the Centers for Disease Control (CDC) estimates that every year, influenza affects 9-60 million Americans, causes 140,000-710,100 hospitalizations, and results in 12,000-56,000 deaths. (Influenza is more severe in some years than others.) Most people get better without needing hospitalization, but some people get very sick. Older adults are especially likely to get dangerously ill from catching the flu. So I agree with the CDC’s recommendation: everyone over the age of 6 months should get their seasonal flu shot. In fact, I’m about to go get mine. As a healthy woman in her 40s, I’m not that concerned about getting dangerously ill from influenza. Instead, I get my annual flu shot because I want to minimize my chance of getting sick and perhaps exposing my older patients to influenza. This month, you’ll probably be encouraged to get vaccinated too. So in this article, I’ll address some key things to know about influenza and the flu shot, along with some common questions and concerns.

Only a bus driver and a boy, Julien, help her collect her books that the others have thrown into a puddle. To cheer Sophie up, Julien gives her a small tin box, a gift from his fatally ill mother. Because it is important to him, he asks her to lend it back to him from time to time. As Julien wants the box back at the moment he gave it to her, Sophie demands proof of how important it is to him. Julien disengages the handbrake of the bus without hesitation, and the bus full of children rolls down a hill. Their game has begun: the box changes its owner after each completed dare. Between the son of wealthy Belgian parents and the daughter of poor Polish immigrants a lasting friendship develops. As children they misbehave in school, wreak havoc on a wedding, and ask silly tasks of each other. As teenagers their romantic relationships with others suffer as a result of their dares. Meanwhile, the two friends ignore any consequences or punishment during their game. While they are always looking for the next kick, a love is slowly evolving between the protagonists. Not wanting to admit it, they divert their attention from it by even more extreme dares. As young adults, Julien tells Sophie that he wants to get married, only later revealing that he means to someone else.

Woods, along with the rest of the American team, faced difficulties during the biennial Ryder Cup event held earlier this month. The Ryder Cup is a prestigious golf competition that takes place every two years, pitting the best players from the United States against those from Europe. In recent years, the European team has dominated the event, leading to questions regarding the performance of the US team and the decisions made by its leadership.

Answer by taking a quote from the following article: Napalm Death are a British extreme metal band formed in Meriden, West Midlands, England, in 1981. While none of its original members remain in the group since December 1986, the lineup of vocalist Mark \\"Barney\\" Greenway, bassist Shane Embury, guitarist Mitch Harris and drummer Danny Herrera has remained consistent of the band's career since 1992's Utopia Banished, although, from 1989 to 2004, Napalm Death were a five-piece band after they added Jesse Pintado as the replacement of one-time guitarist Bill Steer; following Pintado's departure, the band reverted to a four-piece rather than replace him. Napalm Death are credited as pioneers of the grindcore genre by incorporating elements of crust punk and death metal, using a noise-filled sound that uses heavily distorted, down-tuned guitars, grinding overdrive bass, high speed tempo, blast beats, and vocals which consist of incomprehensible growls, or high-pitched shrieks, extremely short songs, fast tempos, and sociopolitical lyrics. The band's debut album Scum, released in 1987 by Earache Records, proved substantially influential throughout the global metal community. With the departure of Broadrick and Bullen, the band had to look for new members. Guitarist Bill Steer played in a band based in Liverpool, called Carcass and given the affinity between the bands, he joined Napalm Death while still playing an active role in Carcass. The band asked a friend, Coventrian (Lee Dorrian), to join as vocalist due to his good relationship with the band (he had organised a number of concerts for the band), even though he had never been in a band before. This line-up recorded the B side of the Scum LP at Rich Bitch studios in May 1987, and the album was released through Earache Records. Bill Steer also came third place on Decibel Magazine's \\"Top 20 Death Metal guitarists of all time.\\"  The band promptly lost another member just after they undertook a short tour after the release of Scum. Jim Whiteley left the group (and subsequently joined Weston-Super-Mare based band Ripcord with whom the aforementioned tour had been shared) and Shane Embury (former drummer of Unseen Terror) moved to bass. The band then appeared on two compilation records ('North Atlantic Noise Attack' and the 'Pathological Compilation'), recorded two Peel sessions and a split 7\\" with Japanese band S.O.B. They also returned to Rich Bitch studio once more and recorded their second album: From Enslavement to Obliteration.  A follow-up release to \\"Enslavement...\\" came in the form of the six song 12\\" EP \\"Mentally Murdered\\", which was to be the last recording with the Harris/Steer/Dorian/Embury line-up. This EP was recorded at the Slaughterhouse Studios and took on a slightly different sound, blending grindcore with death metal. Following the release, Napalm Death were featured on national television in the United Kingdom in a heavy metal special by Arena (BBC 2).  The band continued to tour, but as soon as they came back home from Japan, in July 1989, Steer and Dorrian left the band: Steer decided to dedicate himself full-time to Carcass, while Dorrian formed the doom metal group Cathedral. The group recruited Jesse Pintado (ex-Terrorizer) on guitar and Mark \\"Barney\\" Greenway (ex-Benediction) as vocalist. This line-up took part in the Grindcrusher tour organised by Earache Records and featuring fellow label-mates Carcass, Bolt Thrower and Morbid Angel. The group recruited Mitch Harris (ex-Righteous Pigs) as second guitarist after the tour. Was part did Coventrian play in the group?","output":"Coventrian, also known as Lee Dorrian, played a significant role as the vocalist in Napalm Death.

Brett wanted to properly clean up Neil's blonde dyed hair so","output":"Brett studied various hair care techniques and products to achieve the best results. He did some research online about the most effective ways to help restore Neil's hair health, color, and texture without damaging it further. Brett took detailed notes and prepared a list of the necessary supplies: sulfate-free shampoo, a deep conditioner, clarifying shampoo, a wide-tooth comb, a soft towel, and a hair mask containing hydrating and restorative ingredients. Once he was ready, he invited Neil to his apartment for a hair intervention. Neil, a bit skeptical, reluctantly agreed, knowing that his hair needed help after the unsuccessful dye job left it dull, tangled, and dry. Once Neil arrived, Brett shared his research findings and laid out the plan to rejuvenate Neil's hair. The first step involved washing the hair with the sulfate-free shampoo, as sulfates could further strip and damage the hair. They went to the bathroom, and after having Neil lean over the tub, Brett gently massaged the shampoo into his hair, being sure to distribute it evenly and carefully. After a thorough rinse, Brett moved onto the second step, which was using a deep conditioner. He applied a generous amount of the conditioner to Neil's hair while making sure to avoid the roots. As the conditioner worked its magic, Brett gently went through Neil's hair with the wide-tooth comb to untangle any knots and equally distribute the product. He advised Neil to let the conditioner sit for a few minutes to allow for maximum absorption. While they waited, Brett and Neil discussed various hair care tips and tricks to maintain healthy hair, like minimizing heat styling and using silk pillowcases to reduce friction and breakage during the night. After the conditioner had done its job of moisturizing and repairing Neil's hair, Brett rinsed it out with lukewarm water, making sure not to leave any residue behind. The next step involved using the clarifying shampoo to remove any remaining dye and product build-up from Neil's hair. Brett massaged this shampoo into Neil's hair much like the sulfate-free shampoo, making sure to create a rich lather. After rinsing twice, he noticed a considerable improvement in the hair's brightness and clarity. Finally, the last step in the process was to apply the hair mask. Since Neil's hair was slightly damp, Brett deemed it perfect for the mask as the hair shaft would be open, allowing the ingredients to penetrate deeply. He applied the mask, focusing on the mid-lengths to the ends of Neil's hair as these parts required the most hydration. He combed Neil's hair to ensure even distribution and advised him to let the mask sit for at least 15 minutes. As they waited, Brett provided additional recommendations, like getting a trim to remove split ends and scheduling regular deep-conditioning treatments to maintain hair health. Once the 15 minutes were up, Brett rinsed the mask out of Neil's hair with cool water to close the hair cuticle and lock in moisture. When they were done, Neil examined his hair in the mirror. In just a few hours, his hair had drastically improved in appearance and felt much healthier. It was significantly softer, shinier, and more manageable than it had been in a long time. Neil thanked Brett profusely for his help, promising to heed his advice and properly care for his hair going forward. Brett, satisfied with the outcome, was glad he could help his friend. Not only had they managed to improve the appearance and health of Neil's hair, but they had also strengthened their friendship through the experience."},{"instruction":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

News article: Obama Parries With House GOP on Budget, Immigration      Tom Williams/CQ Roll Call Obama arrives at the Capitol for a meeting with House Republicans on Wednesday, accompanied by House Sergeant-at-Arms Paul Irving.      President Barack Obama continued his push for a grand bargain, an immigration overhaul and the rest of his agenda in a meeting with House Republicans on Wednesday, but GOP leaders immediately shut the door on any compromises that would include new taxes.      Obama appealed to Republicans to come to the table on a bipartisan budget package — saying he’s willing to back 2 in spending cuts for every 1 in tax revenue — and he argued that reaching agreement on immigration would benefit them politically.      But he also told them balancing the budget over the next 10 years is not on his priority list.      Republicans thanked the president for the rare sojourn to the Capitol and said they hoped that this would start a new dialogue with the president on a range of issues. But many lawmakers said deep suspicions and divisions remain.      GOP leaders immediately held a news conference where they praised the president’s visiting but reiterated their opposition to his tax demands.      “If the president wants to let our unwillingness to raise taxes get in the way, then we are not gonna be able to set differences aside and focus on what we agree on,” House Majority Leader Eric Cantor of Virginia said. Cantor suggested that there are “low-hanging fruit” among spending cuts that both sides support.      And Speaker John A. Boehner of Ohio said he’s heard the president before but that it was good for his members to hear it.      “Republicans want to balance the budget, the president doesn’t. Republicans want to solve our long-term debt problem. The president doesn’t. We want to unlock our energy resources to put more Americans back to work. The president doesn’t. But, having said that, today was a good start, and I hope that these kind of discussions can continue,” he said.      Obama, members said, talked about areas where he was willing to trim entitlements, including adopting a stingier measure of inflation and means-testing Medicare — but he explicitly tied those proposals to new revenue. Or, in the words of Boehner, he threatened to hold cuts “hostage.”      “He does not want balance the budget in 10 years and he wants tax increases and he wants new spending, but other than that we are close,” quipped Rep. Darrell Issa, R-Calif.      Obama also faced tough questioning on the sequester-related closing of White House public tours — the president pointed the finger at the Secret Service, causing an audible gasp in the audience.      When the president announced in the middle of the meeting that white smoke had been seen at the Vatican — signifying a new pope — Rep. Billy Long of Missouri seized the occasion. “Billy just blurted out, as Billy does, ‘Does that mean we’ll have tours at the White House?’ and it broke the place up and even the president laughed at that,” Nebraska’s Lee Terry said. Obama reportedly replied that tours of the Vatican were still available.      Please enable JavaScript to view the comments powered by Disqus.      Disqus ||||| President Barack Obama tangled with House Republicans for more than an hour Wednesday, answering questions on topics ranging from whether the White House spends too much time campaigning to how serious the administration is about slashing the nation’s deficit.      Republicans focused on political issues — quizzing Obama on why his White House stopped giving tours after the sequester took effect. But the House GOP also delved into policy, where Republicans heard Obama say he doesn’t want to balance the budget in 10 years. That’s the challenge issued by Rep. Paul Ryan in the GOP budget unveiled on Tuesday.      Text Size -      +      reset BTC: Obama's tax problem Paul Ryan questions Obama's 'charm offensive'      It was the first opportunity House Republicans had in nearly two years to directly confront Obama, a president that many of them were elected by lambasting, and all of them tried to defeat in 2012.      The exchange — which was serious, but interspersed with a few jokes — allowed the GOP lawmakers to vent on a range of concerns, including the time they think Obama spends campaigning against them. They’re concerned that Obama’s not committed to lowering the deficit and whether the president’s so-called “charm offensive” in reaching out to lawmakers to strike a grand bargain on the deficit is sincere. Obama shook hands and answered private questions after the session, a source said.      The meeting was part of an aggressive outreach effort by the president to Hill lawmakers to try and find common ground on the deficit. On Tuesday, Obama met with Senate Democrats, and on Thursday, he will meet with Senate Republicans and House Democrats. Obama met with Senate Democrats on the Hill on Tuesday.      A White House official called the meeting a “good, substantive exchange” and said Obama “enjoyed the conversation.”The aide said that the two parties didn’t need to agree on everything to compromise on some things.      “The President handled a variety of questions on a range of topics from the members and reinforced his strong desire, especially now that the election is over, to find bipartisan common ground on a range of legislative priorities,” the aide said.      The president heard from old and new faces. None of the issues that surfaced, though, were a complete surprise.      Rep. James Lankford (R-Okla.) — the Republican Policy Committee chairman — brought up a familiar hobby-horse for House Republicans: that Obama is always campaigning.      He asked about Organizing for Action’s (OFA) meeting. He complained that Obama called Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee Chair Steve Israel (D-N.Y.) before Boehner on election night. Obama said that wasn’t true and that he had called Boehner, but Boehner had gone to sleep, according to a source familiar with the meeting. The speaker said the president was right, the source said.      Lankford argued that Obama is too focused on defeating House Republicans instead of “saving the next generation” from debt problems. He then mentioned Bill Clinton working successfully to balance the budget and asked if he’d commit to balancing the budget in 10 years, as Ryan’s budget dictates.      “OFA is organized around issues rather than 2014,” Obama said in a lengthy, 10-minute answer to Lankford, according to a source inside the meeting. ||||| House Republicans peppered President Obama with pointed questions on the budget, White House tours and the proposed Keystone XL oil pipeline during an hourlong meeting Wednesday that yielded no major breakthroughs between the two divided parties.      While the exchanges during Obama’s first meeting in nearly two years with his chief opponents on Capitol Hill were polite, they only underscored the wide ideological gulf between the reelected Democratic president and the Republican House majority.      “It didn’t change anything at all. He didn’t offer anything new,” said Rep. Tom Latham (R-Iowa), a close ally of Speaker John Boehner John BoehnerTrump’s new weapon?

ADVERTISEMENT      Obama spent a majority of the meeting taking questions from members hand-picked by the Republican leadership. The topics ranged from the nation’s fiscal impasse to immigration, guns, cybersecurity, Israel, Keystone and the cancellation of White House tours due to sequestration spending cuts.      The president told lawmakers he believed they had “about a nine-month window” to act on major budget priorities like overhauling the tax code, Rep. Tom Cole (R-Okla.) said. On immigration, Obama spoke in frank political terms and sought to dispel Republican suspicions that he would rather see comprehensive legislation fail so he can use the issue as a hammer on the GOP in 2014.      A victory on immigration, he told the lawmakers, would help Republicans more than it would help Democrats in 2014. But, Cole quoted Obama as saying, “it needs to happen, and I want to work toward it.”      In a press conference afterward, Boehner John BoehnerTrump’s new weapon? The bully pulpit President-elect Trump: Please drain the student loan swamp GOP leaders face crunch in Trump's first 100 days MORE thanked the president for coming, and described the meeting in classic Washington vernacular. “I think that we had a very frank and candid exchange of ideas and frankly I think it was productive,” he said.      Yet when asked what specifically came out of the meeting that was positive, the Speaker referred only to a tone that he called “respectful” and “very good.”      Boehner, who has often served as a conduit between the White House and his conference, said it was good for Republican lawmakers to hear from the president directly, even if the message was familiar.      “I heard what the president had to say. I’ve heard it before,” he said. “I thought it was good for all of our members to hear it, so they can have an understanding of where’s he’s coming from. We’ve got big problems in this country that need to be addressed. We’re willing to get them addressed. I hope the president continues his outreach.”      About the only news that Obama brought to House Republicans, multiple lawmakers said, was the announcement that there was a new pope. While billions outside the closed-door meeting learned through television about the historic selection, House Republicans learned from the president.      There’s “white smoke at the Vatican. We don’t know a name,” Obama told the members after receiving a message.      “Does that mean you’ll open up the White House for tours?,” asked Rep. Billy Long (R-Mo.).      Over the laughter of the attendees, Obama chuckled. “No, but it means they’ll open the Vatican,” he said.      Leaving the meeting, a smiling Obama spoke briefly of the election of a pope, saying “we look forward to hearing about it.”      Of the meeting itself, Obama was terse. “It was good. I enjoyed it,” he told reporters. “It was useful.”      Obama earned a standing ovation from Republicans when he entered the meeting, the second of four sessions the president is having on Capitol Hill this week with House and Senate Republicans and Democrats, and there was only one moment of testiness, according to a number of GOP lawmakers in the room.      Rep. Candice Miller (R-Mich.), chairwoman of the House Administration Committee, asked why Obama ended the White House tours in light of the sequester, instead of the annual Christmas party or congressional picnic.      The president pointed blame at the Secret Service, saying they didn’t want to have to furlough staff and opted instead to cut non-essential tasks.      Members responded with “groans in disbelief,” said one Republican, prompting Obama to caution: “Now, now, let’s be respectful.”      “In fairness, the president said he’s looking into ways to get school groups in, and that would take less [security personnel] because you could check them in advance,” a separate lawmaker conceded, noting that it takes a lot of Secret Service to check in the dozens of tourists who take tours of the White House.      The most significant point of contention, however, remained the central impasse that has divided the White House and congressional Republicans for more than two years: the federal budget.      Under the leadership of Rep. Paul Ryan Paul RyanWhy the GOP shouldn't get too cocky after winning in November Trump eyes House members for Cabinet jobs Trump’s new weapon? The bully pulpit MORE (R-Wis.), House Republicans on Tuesday introduced a budget resolution that eliminates the federal deficit within a decade through steep spending cuts and entitlement reforms. Rep. James Lankford (R-Okla.), asking the first question of Obama, sought a commitment from the president for a 10-year balanced budget.      Obama said no.      “The president tactfully said ‘That’s not my priority, my priority is not slowing the recovery down and the long-term economic health of the country,’ ” Rogers said.      Obama instead talked about balancing the budget “in principle,” lawmakers said, meaning eliminating all deficits except for payments of interest on the debt.      Rep. Greg Walden (R-Ore.) said the president’s definition of a budget that balances “in principle” is like “telling a family that your budget balances without counting the interest on your credit card debt or your mortgage.”      “It matters,” Walden said.      Lawmakers also pressed Obama on the approval of the Keystone XL oil sands pipeline from Canada, a long-standing priority for Republicans who argue its construction would expand U.S. energy and create jobs. Obama said a decision will arrive soon, but lawmakers emerged split over whether or not he suggested that he’s leaning toward approval.      Obama lingered after the meeting to shake hands and chat privately with members. Rep. Jeff Fortenberry Jeff FortenberryWHIP LIST: Republicans breaking with Trump Pence rallies GOP before final stretch Pence to House GOP: Trump needs your help MORE (R-Neb.) said he approached Obama afterward and asked the president “about conscience rights,” a reference to the administration’s decision to require most employers to cover birth control for their workers — something Fortenberry has fought tooth and nail.      “I did want to raise this because this is a deep concern for some of us,” Fortenberry said. He asked Obama “if there’s an opening to reconsider the administration’s position.”      Fortenberry did not reveal Obama’s response, but said he felt as if Obama took his concerns seriously.      Republicans told Obama he is welcome to address their conference “anytime,” although some doubted the usefulness of the discussion, saying it could improve — but not fix — the deficit of trust between the two sides.

He said he was willing to do hard things, and he never said what those hard things were.”      Cole, however, said he thought members came out of the meeting “with a higher opinion of Obama than going into the meeting.”      “We’ll see what comes of it. That’s what matters,” said Walden, chairman of the National Republican Congressional Committee. “The question is, is this just the latest chapter in the never-ending campaign?”      — Published at 2:28 p.m. and updated at 8:36 p.m. ||||| J. Scott Applewhite/AP Photo      Talk about white smoke: I am told, by Republican sources, that President Obama got standing ovations at the beginning and end of his meeting today with House Republicans on Capitol Hill - his first such meeting in four years.      There were tough questions and no breakthroughs, but a source inside the closed-door meeting called it \\"very cordial\\" and told me that virtually every House Republican who stood up to ask a question began by saying, \\"Thank you for coming\\" and \\"You are welcome here anytime.\\" Some added, \\"We need to work together.\\"      The biggest laugh line: The president informed the group that there was white smoke at the Vatican, and Rep. Billy Long of Missouri yelled out, \\"Does that mean the White House is open for tours?\\" Obama responded: \\"No, but the Vatican is.\\"      This was Obama's first visit to Capitol Hill to meet with House Republicans in four years. He has met with them a total of four times, the most recent being at the White House 2011.      The president's message was straightforward and unsurprising. He began the meeting by saying he wanted to get things done on the budget and taxes, immigration and guns. On entitlement reform, he made it clear he was willing to push Democrats to make tough cuts but only if Republicans agreed to higher tax revenues. He also mentioned the strong bi-partisan commitment to Israel, which he will visit next week.      He was asked about eight questions, including these:      Rep. James Lankford of Oklahoma accused Obama of being too focused on defeating Republicans and asked, \\"Can we agree that we need to get to a balanced budget in 10 years?\\" The president responded by saying that domestic spending had already been cut deeply, and that balancing the budget too quickly would hurt the economy.      Rep. Candace Miller of Michigan asked about the cancellation of White House tours. The president said it was a Secret Service decision.      Rep. Steve Scalise of Louisiana asked about offshore oil drilling and the Keystone pipeline. The president said there were broad areas of agreement on energy, but that it was important to have a broader energy policy beyond fossil fuels. He said a decision on the Keystone pipeline would be coming \\"soon.\\"      Rep. Dave Camp of Michigan, the chairman of the tax-writing Ways and Means Committee, asked if Obama and Republicans agreed on some entitlement reforms (specifically, means-testing for Medicare and reducing annual cost-of-living increases for Social Security), why couldn't those things be done now? The president said he would agree to those reforms only if Republicans agreed to raise tax revenues by closing loopholes, because we have to ask \\"everybody to sacrifice.\\"      Rep. Peter Roskam of Illinois, who served with Obama in the Illinois state legislature, brought up the fiscal mess in Illinois and said Republicans were worried that Obama's policies would cause the same thing to happen here. Obama said the budget mess in Illinois was a bipartisan mess.      Rep. Tom Price of Georgia brought up the lack of trust between Republicans and the White House, and said the delay on the White House budget seemed politically motivated. Obama insisted the delay was not political: \\"I am done with campaigns,\\" he said. \\"I am not running for re-election.\\" The president hit that theme several times during the meeting.      Several of the questioners brought up the lack of trust and pointed to the fact that the president would be meeting tonight on behalf of his grassroots group Organizing for Action, raising money, as Roskam put it, \\"to thin our herd.\\" ||||| WASHINGTON — President Obama ’s meeting with a restive and resistant House Republican majority on Wednesday underscored their deep divisions over fiscal policy as both sides acknowledged that an overarching budget compromise was in doubt despite a new push by the White House.      One day after Republicans rolled out a detailed proposal aimed at eliminating the federal deficit through steep cuts and repealing many of the president’s accomplishments, Mr. Obama told them pointedly in a rare visit that their highest fiscal priority was not his.      “Our biggest problems in the next 10 years are not deficits,” the president said, according to accounts from the meeting, bluntly rejecting an idea that has become Republican fiscal dogma.      That left many Republicans, who are resisting the president’s calls to close tax loopholes that benefit the wealthy, wondering where they could find room for compromise.      “Well, he doesn’t want to balance the budget in 10 years, and he wants tax increases, and he wants new spending,” Representative Darrell Issa of California said as he left the meeting early. “But other than that, we’re close.”      The hourlong discussion at the Capitol, and the release of a new budget by Senate Democrats on Wednesday that adds 100 billion in new stimulus spending and would impose higher taxes on large corporations and wealthy Americans, illustrated anew just how difficult it will be to resolve the issues that have split the Congress for years and created a perpetual cycle of deadline-driven short-term fiscal policy. Given the gap in the budget approaches, the president conceded as much in an interview with ABC News that ran on Wednesday before he went to the Capitol for the second consecutive day.      “Ultimately, it may be that the differences are just too wide,” said Mr. Obama, who will meet Thursday with Senate Republicans and House Democrats. “It may be that ideologically, if their position is, ‘We can’t do any revenue,’ or, ‘We can only do revenue if we gut Medicare or gut Social Security or gut Medicaid,’ if that’s the position, then we’re probably not going to be able to get a deal.”      While the White House and Republicans characterized Wednesday’s discussion as a cordial first step in what they hope will be a continuing dialogue, those who attended were frank about the prospects for compromise.      “The president seemed to say, ‘If we’re going to do the areas we agree on, you have to also do some of mine,’ ” said Representative James Lankford of Oklahoma, bristling at Mr. Obama’s suggestion. “If we can find the areas we agree on, why can’t we just do those?”      The problem in coming together on areas of agreement is that there are so few. Republicans and Democrats cannot agree on the fundamental, underlying problem with the country’s fiscal governance. Congressional Democrats and Mr. Obama, noting that the government has long operated with deep deficits, do not see a need for a balanced budget as long as spending is kept in check.      Senator Patty Murray, the Washington Democrat and Senate Budget Committee chairwoman who outlined her budget on Wednesday, summed up her party’s objections to Republican austerity measures, which Democrats have said rob the country of needed investment.      “Deficit reduction at the expense of economic growth is doomed to failure,” she said.      Under their budget, Senate Democrats would have the government running a deficit of nearly 600 billion in 10 years.      In another sign of just how different the parties’ priorities are, just before Mr. Obama arrived to meet with House Republicans, the Senate rejected a Republican effort to cut off financing for the president’s signature health care overhaul in a party-line vote.      Other issues surfaced in Wednesday’s talks that only further highlighted the partisan gulf.      Republicans vented their frustration that the president always seemed to be in campaign mode, questioning why he would speak to Organizing for Action, a nonprofit that supports his priorities, on the same day he visited them.      They pushed him to approve the Keystone oil pipeline and to reopen the White House for tours. Representative Candice S. Miller of Michigan told him that if he wanted to save on expenses, he should cancel the White House picnics and Christmas parties held for members of Congress instead. ||||| What is a shorter version of the above article?","output":"President Barack Obama met with House Republicans to discuss budget, immigration, and other issues on his agenda.

What may happen to a parent if they get a nanny ?","output":"If a parent decides to get a nanny, several outcomes may occur.  1. Initial assessment: First, the parent needs to analyze their specific requirements and preferences. They may choose between live-in or live-out nannies, full-time or part-time assistance, and evaluate their budget constraints. 2. Searching for a nanny: The parent will have to begin the process of searching for a suitable nanny, either through a reputable agency, online platform, or through personal connections. 3. Screening and interviewing: This step is crucial for ensuring the security and well-being of the family. Parents need to conduct thorough background checks, verify references, and hold multiple interviews to assess the nanny's qualifications, experience, and personality. 4. Contract agreement: Once a suitable candidate is identified, the parent needs to negotiate terms of employment, including working hours, salary, holidays, and any other relevant details. A written contract would legally bind both parties and protect their rights. 5. Building trust and rapport: The parent and nanny relationship needs to develop trust and rapport since the nanny will be taking care of the children. Regular communication between the parent and the nanny will be essential in building a strong, professional relationship. 6. Adjusting to new routines: As the nanny enters the home, both the family and the nanny will need time to adjust to the new dynamics. The children might take a while to feel comfortable with their new caregiver during the transition. 7. Improved family life balance: With a nanny in place, parents will have more time for work, self-care, and social engagements while being confident that their children are in safe hands. The nanny’s presence can reduce stress and create a more harmonious atmosphere within the home. 8. Potential challenges: Hiring a nanny may come with some challenges including possible conflicts of opinions on child rearing or personality clashes, and potential turnover if the nanny leaves the job. To manage these challenges, parents should maintain open communication and address any concerns promptly. In summary, if a parent decides to get a nanny, they need to follow a sequential process of assessing needs, searching, interviewing, forming a contract, building trust, adjusting to routines, and managing potential challenges. Having a nanny can ultimately provide relief and support in managing family life balance for parents without live-in caregivers."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant that follows instruction extremely well.

Given the question: Read the article and select the best answer. Article: While success is surely sweeter than failure, it seems failure is a far better teacher, and organizations that fail spectacularly often flourish more in the long run, according to a new study by Vinit Desai, assistant professor of management at the University of Colorado Denver Business School. Researchers have found that people missing their goals perform much better in the long run. That is because they gain more knowledge from their failures than their successes and the lessons are more likely to stay longer in their minds. \\"We found that the knowledge gained from success was often fleeting while knowledge from failure stuck around for years,\\" said professor Desai, who led the study. \\"But companies often ignore failure. Managers may fire people or turn over the whole workforce while they should treat the failure as a learning opportunity.\\" Prof Desai compared the flights of the space shuttle Atlantis and the Challenger. During the 2002 Atlantis flight, a piece of insulation   broke off and damaged the left solid rocket booster   but didn't influence the program. There was little investigation. The Challenger was launched next and another piece of insulation broke off. This time the shuttle and its seven-person crew were destroyed. The disaster led to a major investigation resulting in 29 changes to prevent future disasters. The difference in response in the two cases came down to this: Atlantis was considered a success and the Challenger a failure. \\"Despite crowded skies, airlines are extremely reliable,\\" he said. \\"The number of failures is extremely small. And past researches have shown that older airlines, those with more experience in failure, have a lower number of accidents.\\" Prof Desai doesn't recommend finding out failure in order to learn. Instead, he advises organizations to analyze small failures to collect useful information rather than wait for major failures. Question: Fewer accidents happen to older airlines in that   _  .

Avoid answers that are incorrect or provides incomplete justification for the question. Q: Passage: The second main legislative body is the Council, which is composed of different ministers of the member states. The heads of government of member states also convene a \\"European Council\\" (a distinct body) that the TEU article 15 defines as providing the 'necessary impetus for its development and shall define the general political directions and priorities'. It meets each six months and its President (currently former Poland Prime Minister Donald Tusk) is meant to 'drive forward its work', but it does not itself 'legislative functions'. The Council does this: in effect this is the governments of the member states, but there will be a different minister at each meeting, depending on the topic discussed (e.g. for environmental issues, the member states' environment ministers attend and vote; for foreign affairs, the foreign ministers, etc.). The minister must have the authority to represent and bin the member states in decisions. When voting takes place it is weighted inversely to member state size, so smaller member states are not dominated by larger member states. In total there are 352 votes, but for most acts there must be a qualified majority vote, if not consensus. TEU article 16(4) and TFEU article 238(3) define this to mean at least 55 per cent of the Council members (not votes) representing 65 per cent of the population of the EU: currently this means around 74 per cent, or 260 of the 352 votes.

Lake Burley Griffin is crossed by Commonwealth Avenue Bridge (310 metres or 1,020 feet), Kings Avenue Bridge (270 metres or 890 feet) and a roadway over Scrivener Dam. The two bridges were constructed before the lake was filled, and replaced wooden structures. Site testing for both the Commonwealth Avenue and Kings Avenue bridges took place during late 1959 to early 1960. The construction of the Kings Avenue Bridge began in 1960, followed by Commonwealth Avenue Bridge the year after. Fortunately for the builders, Canberra was in a drought and the ground remained dry during construction. Both bridges use post-tensioned concrete, reinforced with rustproof steel cables.Both bridges are made of concrete and steel and are dual-carriageway; Commonwealth Avenue has three lanes in each direction while Kings Avenue has two. Instead of traditional lamp post lighting, Kings Avenue Bridge was illuminated by a series of fluorescent tubes on the handrails, a concept known as \\"integral lighting\\". The design was deemed a success, so it was introduced to the Commonwealth Avenue Bridge also. Both structures won awards from the Illumination Engineering Society.Kings Avenue Bridge opened on 10 March 1962.

Manitoba's major lakes are Lake Manitoba, Lake Winnipegosis, and Lake Winnipeg, the tenth-largest freshwater lake in the world. Some traditional Native lands and boreal forest on Lake Winnipeg's east side are a proposed UNESCO World Heritage Site.Manitoba is at the centre of the Hudson Bay drainage basin, with a high volume of the water draining into Lake Winnipeg and then north down the Nelson River into Hudson Bay. This basin's rivers reach far west to the mountains, far south into the United States, and east into Ontario. Major watercourses include the Red, Assiniboine, Nelson, Winnipeg, Hayes, Whiteshell and Churchill rivers. Most of Manitoba's inhabited south has developed in the prehistoric bed of Glacial Lake Agassiz. This region, particularly the Red River Valley, is flat and fertile; receding glaciers left hilly and rocky areas throughout the province.Baldy Mountain is the province's highest point at 832 metres (2,730 ft) above sea level, and the Hudson Bay coast is the lowest at sea level. Riding Mountain, the Pembina Hills, Sandilands Provincial Forest, and the Canadian Shield are also upland regions. Much of the province's sparsely inhabited north and east lie on the irregular granite Canadian Shield, including Whiteshell, Atikaki, and Nopiming Provincial Parks.Extensive agriculture is found only in the province's southern areas, although there is grain farming in the Carrot Valley Region (near The Pas). The most common agricultural activity is cattle husbandry (34.6%), followed by assorted grains (19.0%) and oilseed (7.9%). Around 12 percent of Canada's farmland is in Manitoba.  answer the following question:  What is the name of the province in whose southern areas are found the only extensive agriculture?

This article: In his personaggi listed in the 1609 score, Monteverdi unaccountably omits La messaggera (the Messenger), and indicates that the final chorus of shepherds who perform the moresca (Moorish dance) at the opera's end are a separate group (che fecero la moresca nel fine). Little information is available about who sang the various roles in the first performance. A letter published at Mantua in 1612 records that the distinguished tenor and composer Francesco Rasi took part, and it is generally assumed that he sang the title role. Rasi could sing in both the tenor and bass ranges \\"with exquisite style ... and extraordinary feeling\\". The involvement in the premiere of a Florentine castrato, Giovanni Gualberto Magli, is confirmed by correspondence between the Gonzaga princes. Magli sang the prologue, Proserpina and possibly one other role, either La messaggera or Speranza. The musicologist and historian Hans Redlich mistakenly allocates Magli to the role of Orfeo.A clue about who played Euridice is contained in a 1608 letter to Duke Vincenzo. It refers to \\"that little priest who performed the role of Euridice in the Most Serene Prince's Orfeo\\". This priest was possibly Padre Girolamo Bacchini, a castrato known to have had connections to the Mantuan court in the early 17th century. The Monteverdi scholar Tim Carter speculates that two prominent Mantuan tenors, Pandolfo Grande and Francesco Campagnola may have sung minor roles in the premiere.There are solo parts for four shepherds and three spirits. Carter calculates that through the doubling of roles that the text allows, a total of ten singers—three sopranos, two altos, three tenors and two basses—is required for a performance, with the soloists (except Orfeo) also forming the chorus. Carter's suggested role-doublings include La musica with Euridice, Ninfa with Proserpina and La messaggera with Speranza. contains an answer for the question: What is the last name of the scholar that believes role-doublings were used in the performance of the Montverdi piece?, what is it ?","output":"The last name of the scholar that believes role-doublings were used in the performance of the Monteverdi piece is Carter."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Plot title: Death on the Nile Movie plot: Jacqueline De Bellefort introduces her fiancÃ© Simon to her friend Linnet Ridgeway in the hope that Linnet will give him a job. Instead, Linnet marries Simon herself and they head off for a honeymoon in Egypt (the same place where Jacqueline had planned her honeymoon with Simon). A bitter Jacqueline follows them to Egypt, appearing wherever they go. Hercule Poirot (David Suchet) is also on holiday in Egypt. While staying in the same hotel as the newlyweds, he is approached by Linnet Doyle who is getting tired of Jacqueline's harassment. Poirot doesn't accept the job, as he believes that Jacqueline has been treated shamefully by Linnet and Simon. He nevertheless tries to warn Jacqueline against pursuing the Doyles any further. She ignores his warning and joins their cruise on the river Nile. Linnet Doyle comments that she is \\"surrounded by enemies\\" on the cruise, as some of the other travellers are also known to her. They include Andrew Pennington (David Soul), her American trustee, who has orchestrated their 'coincidental' meeting in Egypt in order for her to sign some legal documents. Linnet has also upset her maid Louise (Felicite du Jeu) by interfering in her romantic affairs. Rosalie Otterbourne (Zoe Telford) and aristocrat-turned-Marxist Mr Ferguson (Alastair MacKenzie) take an instant dislike to Linnet. Miss Van Schuyler (Judy Parfitt) admires Linnet's pearls and Tim Allerton (Daniel Lapaine) has a history of being present when precious jewels have been stolen.

Movie title: Troy Context: The story takes place in the fertile, eastern lands bordered by the Mediterranean Sea and kept by the gods. Within the cradle of ancient civilization empires are built, wars fought, alliances forged, and heroes born.Agamemnon (Brian Cox), king of Mycenae, has united most of Greece's kingdoms under his rule and now advances his army upon the nation of Thessaly, hoping to include it in his collection of ever-growing conquests. King Triopas (Julian Glover) bargains with Agamemnon to each let one of their best fighters decide who wins the battle rather than engaging in open war. Triopas calls upon the giant Boagrius (Nathan Jones) while Agamemnon calls to Achilles, but the legendary warrior is nowhere to be found. A messenger boy (Jacob Smith) is sent to fetch him and Agamemnon curses the stubborn nature of the fiercest warrior Greece has ever seen. A half-god and blessed with incomparable strength and skill, Achilles lives to fight but he refuses to associate with Agamemnon, preferring instead to seek his own destiny and be immortalized in history. Achilles easily defeats Boagrius, sealing Agamemnon's control over the nation, and calls out if there is anyone else worthy enough to fight him.Meanwhile, Prince Hector (Eric Bana) and Paris (Orlando Bloom) of Troy feast in the banquet hall of King Menelaus of Sparta (Brendan Gleeson) as honored guests and peace ambassadors to their home nation. However, young Paris sneaks away to be with Menelaus' beautiful wife, Helen (Diane Kruger), whom he loves dearly. He convinces her to come back with him to Troy, stowing her away on his brother's ship. When Hector finds out he is clearly angry but it is too late to return to Sparta with Helen and seek pardon. Finding Helen gone, Menelaus vows revenge on Troy and seeks the approval of his brother, Agamemnon, who is only too happy to oblige, though Agamemnon's decision comes mostly from his desire to sack Troy.Odysseus (Sean Bean), king of Ithaca and under command of Agamemnon, goes to convince Achilles to accompany them in the...

Here is a goal: Animal trainer How would you accomplish this goal?","output":"Becoming an animal trainer involves a variety of steps, each with its own set of skills and knowledge. In broad strokes, here is a detailed process that can guide someone to accomplish the goal of becoming an animal trainer. 1. **Research the Profession**: Understand what being an animal trainer entails. Research the different types of legal requirements in your location. Consider the daily tasks, scheduling, client interaction, animal behavior management, and overarching responsibilities associated with the profession. Look into job outlook, average salary, and job growth predictions too. Being an animal trainer can give you the opportunity to work in a variety of settings, including zoos, aquariums, movie sets, or private homes. 2. **Educational Requirements**: While a high school diploma or an equivalent is often a minimum educational requirement, having a bachelor's degree in biology, animal behaviour, or a similar field will significantly improve your candidacy. Degree programs often offer coursework in areas like wildlife studies, animal behaviour, and animal nutrition. 3. **Get Experience with Animals**: Experience is crucial in this line of work. Volunteer or work in places where you could work with animals like veterinary clinics, animal shelters, farms, stables, or boarding kennels. This experience can provide you with practical knowledge about animal habits, behavior and care requirements. 4. **Obtain Necessary Certification**: Depending on where you live and the specific type of animal you want to train, you may need to be certified. For example, to become a pet dog trainer, you may pursue certification through organizations like the Certification Council for Professional Dog Trainers or the Association of Professional Dog Trainers. These certifications usually involve coursework, exams, and sometimes practical assessments or internships. 5. **Specialize**: Figure out what type of animal trainer you want to be. This might include dogs, cats, horses, birds, marine animals, and more. Each of these animals require different kinds of knowledge and techniques for training. Additionally, some specialize in specific areas such as obedience, agility, hunting, service dogs, therapy animals, or animal acting. 6. **Get a Job as an Animal Trainer**: Look for job postings in local classifieds, online employment websites, animal organizations and professional trainer associations. As a start, you might work as an assistant to a seasoned trainer where you can learn hands-on training techniques. 7. **Develop Your Skills**: Keep learning, improving, updating and practicing your skills. Attend seminars, workshops and conferences, read relevant literature, and stay updated with the latest research in animal behavior. Building a strong network with other professionals in your field can also present opportunities for continual learning and professional growth.  8. **Start Your Own Business or Freelance**: After gaining some experience, you might consider starting your own animal training business or providing freelance animal training services. This would require additional skills in business, marketing, and customer service. Remember, patience, compassion, and solid communication skills are also key qualities that will help you succeed as an animal trainer. It is a rewarding career where you get to strengthen the bond between humans and animals and ensure the welfare of animals.

Here, the hypothesis says: \\"Our group of friends finds it difficult to accept some truths.\\" Now, let's see if the guess (hypothesis) can be true when the first statement (premise) is true. If our group of friends has to accept some truths (premise), it means there are times when we need to face facts. But the guess (hypothesis) says that we find this difficult.

You will be given a task. You must generate a detailed and long answer. Spoilers of both this and The Matrix follow. I liked the original Matrix a great deal. It was not a deep movie, despite Fishburne's attempts to philosophize, but it was fairly well paced, fun, and I have a soft spot for Hong Kong fights. In the original, Neo was the secret life of the rather unhappy cube worker Anderson. By day, corporate drone, and by night, brave hacker. Eventually, he eventually is forced to choose between these lives by his actions - does he become an outlaw fighting the machine, or does he go back to the safe, forgettable world he started in. Interestingly, he discovers that once one is shorn of illusions, life rather sucks. He has his girl by his side and his boon companions, but he eats processed swill, dresses in sweats, and lives in a truly skungy bit of machinery. Still, the truth makes him free. At least part of the fun of that first movie lay in the \\"what if it were me\\" questions raised in the viewer's mind. What if _I_ were capable of the impossible? What if I were \\"The One\\". It does not even matter that much what you are The One example of, with a cool title like that. Further, agent Smith made a wonderful bad guy, as he embodied all of the fear of authority that we carry with us. He was as unstoppable as a terminator, and as merciless. At the end of the Matrix, Neo must return to the Matrix to share his good news of freedom. This movie fails to completely to carry through on the ideas of the original movie, and it does so with such lack of gusto, such poor scriptwriting and such poor editing that I cannot believe they had planned these changes. When the dialog is at a fifth grade level, with various long words dropped in randomly, I find it hard to believe that they understand what they are saying. My short list of characterization failures: The Oracle goes from mildly helpful, if deceitful to utterly obstructionist without any real reason. Major \\"personalities\\" of the matrix are introduced without need - the keymaster, for example, was a cute idea, but just not that interesting a character. Fishburne loses his \\"advisor\\" role, and gets nothing to replace it with. The people of Zion are not particularly likable, nor would you really _want_ them running the world. Special effects problems: The fight scenes are pointless and intermitable. In The Matrix, you felt Neo could lose, and that he had to become something greater in order to survive. In The Matrix Reloaded, he is merely the viewpoint character of a particularly poorly plotted video game. The fight on the freeway looked quite fake, and not that interesting. Pacing problems. As I mentioned above, the fight scenes were interminable. The rave went on too long - everyone in my row at the theater was looking at their watch. Not because we mind good dancing and good orgies, but because we did not know about the people pictured, nor did we care. Whatever hack wrote the creator's soliloquy should be blacklisted from the business. It meandered, used words that the scriptwriter clearly did not understand, and was a waste of time and a pacing killer. The creator's speech could have been done in a tenth the time, and with more peril as \\"Zion exists to give rebels a place to go so they do not destroy the Matrix. There are now too many people who do not believe; the matrix is in danger of crashing and killing every person hooked up to it. Further, the earth cannot support even the people in Zion, let alone these others. You may choose one person from Zion to form the new Zion, while I wipe the memories of the people currently in the Matrix.\\" Instead, we got a long, drawn out bunch of twaddle. If someone argues that it is deep, ask for a transcript, and try breaking down the sentences. Each one is too long by several clauses, and uses words with clearer, shorter synonyms. So, in summary, not worth seeing. I have seen the third one, and despite what a number of reviewers have said, skip it. It does not save this turkey. The reviewers who feel that the second and third movies were \\"deep\\" should go see some truly deep movies. Perhaps read a book or two on rhetoric and debate, and perhaps a bit of philosophy. This movie is just not hard to understand, but it is hard to stomach. Scott Choose your answer. How would you describe the sentiment of this review? pick from the following.

Plot title: UHF Movie plot: George Newman (\\"Weird Al\\" Yankovic) is a daydreamer whose hyperactive imagination keeps him from holding a steady job. The opening sequence is one of George's daydreams as a spoof of the opening scene of 'Raiders of the Lost Ark' with George as Indiana Jones venturing to a temple to steal a gold Academy Award statue and being chased, run over and flattened by a giant boulder. Awaking from his daydream, George and his best friend and roommate Bob (David Bowe) are working at a Big Edna's Burger World, a local fast food eatery in the small Midwest town where they live. When George makes a disparaging remark about Big Edna and she hears it, both George and Bob are fired and litteraly thrown out onto the street.George's inablity to keep a steady job puts a strain on his long-suffering girlfriend Teri (Victoria Jackson) who tolerates his antics to a limit. George and Teri go to his uncle and aunt's house for a party where his compulsive gambling uncle Harvey Bilchik (Stanley Brock) wins the deed to a nearly bankrupt UHF television station in a poker game. After prodding by his wife, Harvey gives control of Channel 62 to George so he can manage the place.The next morning, George and Bob arrive at the station and meet the Channel 62 staff which is made up of the receptionist and wannabe reporter Pamela Finklestein (Fran Drescher), dwarf photojournalist and cameraman Noodles MacIntosh (Billy Barty), and eccentric engineer Philo (Anthony Geary). George attempts to introduce himself to the rival VHF network Channel 8 station but its owner, the mean and cynical R.J. Fletcher (Kevin McCarthy), chases him out angrily.

Think like you are answering to a five year old. Write a title for this article: When many of us have a little cash to invest, we might buy a mutual fund or a stock â if we donât blow it on the latest tech gadget. Not the truly wealthy, however. They often put their money in property, art, businesses and other investments that the rest of us can only dream of owning. How this rarified group uses their cash differentiates them from the rest of us â and keeps them in the black. Take Joshua Coleman, for example. When his family sold their Chicago-based telecom company for 400m in 2004, they didnât run out and buy something extravagant. Instead, they began seeking advice on ways to save their newfound riches and help them grow. Their quest sparked an idea for Coleman, now 27. In 2011, he launched Momentum Advanced Planning â a firm that connects people to tax, legal and wealth experts. If the business one day sells, he could see a big return, just like his familyâs first business. If you think that starting a business is an odd way to invest your money, then you probably arenât among the ultra-wealthy. People who have at least 30m in assets â dubbed ultra high net-worth â invest in stocks and bonds, but they also grow their money by buying companies and investing in unusual securities, such as airline leasing funds. They also own art and cars that they hope will appreciate in value. âItâs called alpha risk,â said Coleman. âItâs this kind of stuff where there can be a lot of upside.â As for the downside, many of these investments are riskier than traditional investments, so thereâs a higher chance of losing a large chunk of change. As well, theyâre far less liquid than stocks and it could talk months or years for the wealthy to get their money out of an investment. Even if you donât have millions to invest, though, you can learn a thing or two about how the rich reap returns and apply it your own portfolios.

The premise and the hypothesis present two different scenarios involving two people near a body of water. There are a few key differences between these two statements that indicate that they do not directly confirm or deny the truth of one another. 1. Location: In the premise, the two people are crossing the river by walking on the rocks. This indicates that the location is a river, where there are rocks present to provide a path for crossing. In the hypothesis, the two people are playing in the waves at the beach. This scenario takes place at a beach, which is a different location compared to a river. 2. Activity: The premise describes an action of crossing the river, presumably to get from one side of the river to the other. Walking on the rocks implies that the individuals are attempting to avoid getting wet and navigating the river safely. In the hypothesis, the two people are playing in the waves, which suggests that they are likely engaged in recreational activities, possibly splashing in the water, swimming, or engaging in water sports. The activities in these two scenarios are quite different from one another. 3. Interaction with water: The premise implies that the two people are trying to avoid getting wet by walking on the rocks as they cross the river. In contrast, the hypothesis has them immersed in the water and actively playing in the waves at the beach, which indicates that they are not avoiding getting wet and are likely to be enjoying the water. Given these differences, the premise does not provide any information about the truth of the hypothesis. It does not confirm or deny that the two people are playing in the waves at the beach. It is possible that the two people cross the river by walking on the rocks at one point and later play in the waves at the beach, or they could be two entirely separate instances with different people or circumstances.

Your goal is to complete the task as faithfully as you can. While performing the task think step-by-step and justify your steps. News article: The New York Times In this age of information overload, information providers and social networks are competing to provide just the highlights that you want, when you want them. News outlets send alerts with breaking news and editors’ picks of top stories. Twitter curates top tweets, organized by subject, into collections it calls Moments. Weather apps warn you of rain minutes before the droplets arrive. Now Facebook, whose popular social network uses an inscrutable algorithm to predict which posts from friends and organizations you most want to see, is trying to corral the highlights and bulletins you receive from other services into one place. On Wednesday, it introduced a new iPhone app called Notify that it says will deliver “timely notifications about the things that matter to you, from the sources you love, all in one place.” The Notify app is separate from the main Facebook service, although users must have a Facebook account to log in. Notify’s primary purpose is to let you sort through and choose to receive mobile-device notifications from various news and information sources on specific topics. If you want final scores or live updates from a San Francisco 49ers games, for example, Fox Sports lets you sign up for those. Dying to know what the cover stories are in the latest issue of Vogue? Those, too, are available as alerts. There is even a daily meditation from Headspace. The notifications are delivered to your iPhone just like any other notification, meaning they show up on some of the most valuable real estate on today’s smartphones: the lock screen that appears when a phone has been idle for a while. The app also shows users all of their recent and saved notifications. “This is a central place you can go where you can build a notification experience that works for you,” Julian Gutman, the Notify product manager, said in an interview. There are about 70 content partners participating, including big broadcasters, like ABC and Fox News; lifestyle publications like Bon Appétit and Thrillist; business news outlets like Bloomberg and MarketWatch; The Weather Channel; and the daily deals site Groupon. The New York Times is also a partner. In some cases, you can customize the alerts by your location, for things like weather or local news. Facebook envisions adding partners, including commercial partners like retailers, as it works out the kinks in the service, which initially will be available only in the United States. Currently, advertisements cannot be sent as notifications, although it is easy to imagine how Facebook could eventually slip in some commercials, as it does with its Instagram photo-sharing service or the news feed in its core social network. Facebook’s other recent initiative to court content creators, called Instant Articles, hosts articles on its social network to speed them up. Notify is more traditional — the partner organizations write the notification text and add a link to a mobile website of their choosing. The idea of pushing information to Internet users, instead of asking them to pull up information through a browser or an app, has been around since the early days of the Internet. PointCast, for example, offered a push information service that was popular in 1996 and 1997, back when most Internet users were on dial-up connections. Many modern apps use push notifications heavily, including the recommendation service Foursquare and Facebook itself. More recently, the introduction of the Apple Watch spurred a new round of interest in notifications as a canvas unto themselves, instead of as just a way to alert people to content in other apps. Niche apps like Yo and IFTTT use notifications at the core of their services. Apple and Google are also building more notifications into their smartphone operating systems that seek to anticipate what each user will want next. Facebook says Notify is a way to experiment with the notification format and to provide a simple tool to help other companies deliver the right information at the right time. “It’s the most intimate way for you and the information you’re interested in to connect,” said Michael Cerda, a director of product management at Facebook who works on new media products.

Based on that paragraph can we conclude that this sentence is true? Frederick William Chesson never met anyone named Harriet","output":"Based on the information provided in the paragraph, we cannot conclude that the sentence \\"Frederick William Chesson never met anyone named Harriet\\" is true. In fact, the paragraph states the opposite: Frederick William Chesson met Harriet Ann Jacobs when she was in England in 1858. Harriet Ann Jacobs was an African-American writer and abolitionist who gained fame with her autobiography, \\"Incidents in the Life of a Slave Girl,\\" which sheds light on the struggles and hardships faced by enslaved women in the 19th century. To further understand Frederick William Chesson's connection with Harriet Ann Jacobs, it is essential to delve into his background as an anti-slavery campaigner and journalist. Chesson actively participated in the London Aborigines' Protection Society and Emancipation Committee, organizations dedicated to combating slavery and promoting the rights and protection of indigenous peoples. Given his commitment and involvement in abolitionist movements, it is not surprising that Chesson would have crossed paths with Harriet Ann Jacobs, an influential figure who shared his mission to end slavery. Their meeting in England in 1858 would have been an opportunity for them to exchange ideas, experiences, and strategies in their fight against slavery and for the emancipation of oppressed populations. Moreover, Chesson's vocal support of the Union side during the American Civil War further demonstrates his dedication to the abolition of slavery. The Union fought to dismantle the Confederate states' institution of slavery and unite the United States under a common government that abolished the practice. Chesson's alignment with the Union cause is consistent with his fervent activist work in England, showing that he would have likely forged connections with like-minded campaigners, such as Harriet Ann Jacobs."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Which is better? Question 2: Which is better CA or an MBA? Would the answer to these two questions be the same?","output":"To answer these questions, I will go step-by-step and compare various aspects of both careers, such as curriculum, job opportunities, duration, and cost. Step 1: Understand the difference between CA and MBA. CA (Chartered Accountant) is a professional certification in the field of accountancy, auditing, finance, and taxation. It is more focused on the technical aspects of the financial world. MBA (Master of Business Administration) is a postgraduate degree that covers various aspects of business management, such as marketing, finance, HR, operations, and project management. It is more focused on developing management and leadership skills.  Step 2: Compare curriculum. CA curriculum involves comprehensive study and practical training in accounting, tax regulations, financial reporting, and auditing. MBA curriculum covers diverse aspects of business and management, allowing students to choose a specialization as per their interest. In this aspect, the best choice depends on the individual's preference for a focused technical skill set (CA) or broader management skills (MBA).  Step 3: Compare job opportunities. Both CA and MBA professionals have a wide range of job opportunities. CA professionals mostly work in accounting firms, auditing companies, and finance departments of organizations. MBA professionals can work in various industries depending on their specialization, such as marketing, HR, finance, and operations. MBA professionals generally have access to a wider range of sectors, whereas CA professionals have niche opportunities in the finance and accounting domain. Step 4: Compare duration and cost. CA certification typically takes longer to complete, usually 4-5 years, including practical training. MBA programs usually last for 2 years. In terms of fees, CA courses are relatively cheaper than MBA courses from reputed institutions. Based on the above comparison, to answer the first question: the better choice between CA and MBA depends on the individual's interests, skills, and long-term goals. If one wants to follow a technically focused and specialized financial career, CA might be better. If one wants a versatile management-oriented career with diverse opportunities, MBA might be better. To answer the second question: the better choice between CA and MBA depends on the context. If someone is asking specifically about job sectors related to accounting and finance, the answer might be CA. If they are asking about general job opportunities and management roles, the answer might be MBA. So, while the answer to the first question is more personal and depends on individual preferences and goals, the answer to the second question can differ based on the context in which it is being asked."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

You will be given a task. You must generate a detailed and long answer. Here is a goal: Increase drainage of garden pots. Which way makes more sense to accomplish this goal?","output":"To accomplish the goal of increasing drainage in garden pots, various methods can be considered. I will discuss three popular approaches to help you determine which might make the most sense for your particular situation: 1) modifying the pot itself, 2) selecting and using appropriate soil, and 3) adding layers to create additional drainage. 1. Modifying the pot itself: One of the simplest ways to increase drainage is to ensure that the pot has enough drainage holes. Many pots come with pre-drilled drain holes, but sometimes they are insufficient or become blocked. In order to improve drainage, you may want to: -Enlarge existing drainage holes or drill additional ones: Using a drill or a sharp tool, carefully enlarge the existing holes or create new ones in the bottom of the garden pot. Ensure the holes are evenly spaced and not too close to the edges to avoid weakening the structure of the pot. The more holes you have, the better the drainage will be. -Use pots with elevated bottoms: Some pots have a built-in elevated platform on the bottom to keep the soil away from any excess water. These types of pots have better drainage than those with flat bottoms. -Use pot feet or stands: Elevating your garden pot by placing it on feet or a stand can also help improve drainage. This allows excess water to flow out easily and prevents it from pooling at the bottom of the pot. 2. Selecting and using appropriate soil: Using the right type of soil can greatly impact drainage. The ideal potting soil should be light, well-aerated, and porous. To achieve good drainage, consider the following options: -Choose pre-made well-draining potting mix: Many garden centers offer a well-draining potting mix that is specifically formulated for use in containers. These mixes often contain high levels of perlite, vermiculite, or coarse sand which help to promote good drainage. -Create your own well-draining soil mix: If you prefer, you can create your own well-draining soil mix by combining garden soil or compost with generous amounts of perlite, vermiculite, or coarse sand. A general guideline is to use a 2:1 ratio of the base material (garden soil or compost) to the drainage-enhancing ingredient. 3. Adding layers to create additional drainage: Adding layers inside the garden pot can help to improve drainage and prevent the soil from becoming waterlogged. Some popular options include: -Add a layer of drainage material: Before adding the soil to the pot, place a layer of drainage material at the bottom. This can include materials like gravel, pebbles, rocks, or broken pieces of terracotta pots. This layer serves to create a barrier between the soil and water, allowing excess water to flow out more easily. -Use a drainage screen or mesh: Another option is to place a porous screen or mesh at the bottom of the pot above the drainage holes. This prevents soil from clogging the holes while still allowing water to escape. In conclusion, the most sensible approach to increasing drainage in garden pots depends on your specific situation, the materials and tools available to you, and your personal preferences. Modifying the pot itself, selecting an appropriate well-draining soil, and adding layers inside the pot are all viable options. You may choose to combine these methods to achieve the best possible drainage for your plants. Ultimately, a well-drained garden pot is essential for the health of your plants, as it prevents root rot and other issues associated with waterlogged soil."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Given the fact \\"cold environments contain few organisms\\", what is the answer to the question or completion \\"There are very few species of plants and animals in places like the North Pole because the temperatures are always very\\"","output":"There are very few species of plants and animals in places like the North Pole because the temperatures are always very low, often reaching well below freezing. These harsh conditions greatly limit the number and diversity of organisms that can survive there. The primary reasons behind this lack of biodiversity in cold environments are as follows: 1. Challenges to Survival: Extremely low temperatures can impede the growth, reproduction, and overall functioning of living organisms. As a result, only species that have evolved specific adaptations to these conditions can survive in such environments. 2. Limited Food and Resources: The scarcity of liquid water, sunlight, and nutrients in cold environments, especially during the long winter months, makes it difficult for plants and animals to flourish. Primary producers (plants) struggle to photosynthesize, leading to energy and food limitations at every level of the ecological pyramid. 3. Slow Metabolism: Cold-blooded animals (ectotherms), like reptiles and most invertebrates, depend on the environmental temperature to regulate their metabolic processes. In cold environments, these animals experience low metabolic rates, leading to decreased energy reserves, slow growth, and reduced reproductive capabilities. 4. Freeze Tolerance and Prevention: In freezing temperatures, ice may form within an organism's body, causing cellular damage or death. The organisms that are able to survive in these environments have evolved specific adaptations, such as producing antifreeze proteins or undergoing hibernation to minimize ice formation and tissue damage. 5. Short Growing Season: In high-latitude ecosystems, such as the polar regions, the growing season is incredibly brief due to the extreme tilt of the Earth relative to the sun. This results in considerably less sunlight available for plants to use in photosynthesis and ultimately, less energy production and primary productivity. 6. Limited Habitat: Cold environments are often characterized by ice, permafrost, or snow cover, which limits the availability of suitable habitats for plants and animals. This curtails the possibilities for organisms to establish and maintain diverse populations. 7. Low Genetic Diversity: The small number of organisms in these settings can lead to low genetic diversity. This low diversity could make it difficult for species to adapt to changing conditions, placing them at greater risk of extinction. 8. Dispersal Barriers: Cold regions often present barriers to dispersal for many species. This lack of connectivity can contribute to a reduced gene flow and increased risk of inbreeding, limiting the capacity of species to adapt to changing conditions or colonize new areas. In conclusion, the low biodiversity observed in cold environments like the North Pole is primarily due to the range of challenges that these harsh conditions represent. Organisms in these environments must overcome numerous obstacles, including low temperatures, limited food and resources, slow metabolism, freeze tolerance, a brief growing season, habitat limitations, and low genetic diversity, among others. These combined factors make it exceptionally difficult for plants and animals to establish and maintain diverse populations, resulting in the few species that are specially adapted to withstand such extreme conditions."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant that follows instruction extremely well.

Article: Facebook Vice President of Product Chris Cox delivers a keynote address at Facebook's ''fMC'' global event for marketers in New York City in this February 29, 2012 file photograph.      SAN FRANCISCO |      SAN FRANCISCO (Reuters) - Facebook Inc aims to raise about 10.6 billion in Silicon Valley's largest IPO, dwarfing the coming-out parties of tech companies like Google Inc and granting the world's largest social network a market value close to Amazon.com's.      The eight-year-old social network that began as Mark Zuckerberg's Harvard dorm room project indicated an initial public offering price range of between 28 and 35 a share on Thursday, which would value the company at 77 billion to 96 billion.      The size of the IPO reflects the company's growth and bullish expectations about its money-making potential as a hub for everything from advertising to commerce.      \\"We certainly haven't ever seen a tech IPO on this grandiose a scale,\\" said Lise Buyer, a principal with the IPO advisory firm Class V Group.      Buyer, who worked on Google's 2004 IPO, said the question about a company \\"that's already this big and that is raising this much money is how many of the glory days of growth are in the past versus how many are ahead.\\"      Facebook stands to raise as much as 12 billion at the upper end of its planned range. If an over-allotment or \\"greenshoe\\" option is triggered, the company could sweep up a maximum of 13.6 billion, according to a Thursday prospectus.      Facebook is only getting about half, or 5.6 billion, of the estimated 10.6 billion that it would raise at the midpoint of its planned IPO range. About 4.9 billon will go to some existing shareholders.      Facebook's stock could begin trading as soon as May 18, according to a road show schedule obtained by Reuters. The offering's price range can be adjusted depending on Wall Street's response during the road show.      Investors are expected to flock to the highly anticipated IPO, although there have been growing concerns about the social network's longer-term growth and Zuckerberg's majority control.      Facebook will trade at 13 to 16 times the revenue that GreenCrest Capital analyst Max Wolff believes it will generate this year. By comparison, Google, the world's dominant Internet search engine, currently trades at 5.5 to 6 times expected 2012 revenue, he said.      Google's valuation was higher when it went public in 2004, though Facebook's IPO valuation is still higher than Google's was back then, Wolff noted.      But some observers said the rich premium was unlikely to deter investors.      \\"People are going to be very comfortable with this valuation,\\" said Sam Schwerin of Millennium Technology Value Partners, which owns Facebook shares worth roughly 200 million. The firm is not selling in the IPO.      \\"A price range of 28 to 35 will be a relief to some people who are concerned that they may try to take the highest possible price because of high demand,\\" he said.      \\"The amount being raised is noteworthy. Selling stockholders are raising about 5 billion in the IPO, which is a lot.\\"      Facebook executives are due to hit the road on Monday, presenting their investment case to audiences. They will start in New York, go to other major cities such as Chicago and Boston, and end up on Facebook's home turf in Menlo Park, California, according to the schedule.      Zuckerberg is expected to participate in the two-week road show, a source has said, although Chief Operating Officer Sheryl Sandberg and Finance Chief David Ebersman will lead the briefings.      TANTALIZING WALL STREET      Zuckerberg's involvement in the road show will be key for investors with concerns about Facebook's long-term strategy and money-making potential, said Brian Wieser, an analyst with Pivotal Research Group.      Zuckerberg's control of the company -- which was underscored when he orchestrated the 1 billion acquisition of mobile app maker Instagram last month -- means that investors need to \\"get comfortable\\" with the 27-year-old CEO, said Wieser.      Last week, Facebook reported its first quarter-to-quarter revenue slide in at least two years, a sign that the social network's sizzling growth may be cooling just as it prepares to go public. Some observers have also flagged the company's lack of revenue on mobile devices such as smartphones as an area of concern.      Dressed in a gray t-shirt and jeans, the copper-haired Zuckerberg appeared in a 31-minute road show video posted online on Thursday. In the video, Zuckerberg predicted that in five years almost every software app would be integrated with Facebook.      Facebook generated the lion's share of its 3.7 billion in revenue last year from online advertising. It also collects fees when consumers use its special Credits currency to purchase virtual goods in social games such as Zynga's Farmville. The company has said it may expand the use of its payment business beyond games.      Facebook, which plans to list its stock on the Nasdaq under the ticker \\"FB\\", has long tantalized investors with the prospect of a mega IPO.      As a private company, shares of Facebook have traded briskly in secondary markets for the past couple of years, as investors sought to get a piece of the fast-growing company ahead of its expected IPO.      The IPO price range indicated in Facebook's filing on Thursday would value the company a hair below the level it has traded at in the secondary markets in recent months, with some trades valuing the company at slightly more than 100 billion.      But some investors think Facebook, which touts 900 million users worldwide, is setting itself a fairly conservative target.      \\"The price range may be tactical. They will likely walk the range up,\\" Schwerin argued.      Facebook plans to sell 337.4 million shares, or 12.3 percent of the company, in the offering. The capital-raising target far outstrips big Internet IPOs that came before it. Google raised just shy of 2 billion in 2004, while last year Groupon tapped investors for 700 million and Zynga raked in 1 billion.      At the top end of the IPO range, Facebook would rival the market value of Amazon.com and Cisco Systems Inc, which are worth just over 100 billion, and surpass the combined market value of older technology companies Hewlett-Packard Co and Dell Inc.      Among existing shareholders, the largest seller in the IPO will be venture capital firm Accel Partners, which will make about 1.2 billion assuming the shares sell at the 31.5 mid-point. Zuckerberg is selling the next largest chunk of shares, worth a little under 1 billion.      Facebook said that a \\"substantial majority\\" of the proceeds from Zuckerberg's stock sale will be used to satisfy taxes he will incur from exercising his options.      In its prospectus, Facebook said the \\"lock-up\\" period, during which employees cannot sell shares after the IPO, would range from 151 days to 181 days.      Facebook also added two new underwriters, including online broker E*Trade Securities. The broker caters to retail clients who some have speculated may try to pile into the IPO.      \\"No doubt Facebook doesn't want to upset the average mom and pop out there,\\" said Craig Huber, research analyst, at independent research firm Huber Research Partners.

McCormick, Bernadette Baum, Matthew Lewis and Richard Pullin) ||||| Buried in Facebook’s amended S-1 is a fun little nugget of information: CEO Mark Zuckerberg will be selling 30.2 million of his shares in the company’s initial public offering, a sale that will net him roughly 1 billion.      In the lead-up to its IPO, Facebook set its opening price range at 28 to 35 a share Thursday — but that could change. Financial data company PrivCo said that underwriters plan to raise the range to 38 to 40 per share prior to the IPO for an initial day price pop.      Depending on the final share price, Zuckerberg will take home between 845 million and 1.2 billion on IPO day. Alas, the 1 billion payout will be largely used for the oh-so-fun activity of paying taxes. Good times.      “Mark Zuckerberg, our founder, Chairman, and CEO, will exercise an outstanding stock option with respect to 60,000,000 shares of Class B common stock and will then offer 30,200,000 of those shares as Class A common stock in our initial public offering,” Facebook said in an amendment to its S-1 Thursday. “We expect that the substantial majority of the net proceeds Mr. Zuckerberg will receive upon such sale will be used to satisfy taxes that he will incur in connection with the option exercise.”      And fear not faithful Facebook subjects, the sale of shares won’t adversely affect Zuckerberg’s control of the board. The social networking company’s founder and CEO will control approximately 57.3 percent of voting power when the company pops up on the public market, according to the revised prospectus.

Facebook's initial public offering price range was anticipated to be between 28 and 35 a share, placing the company's value at 77 billion to 96 billion. The unprecedented scale of Facebook's IPO highlighted the company's massive growth and the optimistic expectations for its financial potential, including advertising and commerce. The high IPO valuation was not expected to deter investors, with Facebook's stock anticipated to trade at 13 to 16 times its expected revenue for that year.

Sentence 1: \\"uh-huh yeah i've read a lot of his too\\" implies that the speaker has read a considerable amount of the author's work. Sentence 2: \\"I have been reading his work for a long time.\\" indicates that the speaker has been reading the author's work over an extended period. Step 2: Compare the core meanings of both sentences. Both sentences express that the speaker has engaged in reading the author's work, but they convey slightly different aspects. Sentence 1 describes the quantity of the author's work the speaker has read, while Sentence 2 involves the duration of the speaker's engagement with the author's work. Step 3: Determine whether the second sentence is entailed by the first sentence. Given the differences in the aspects highlighted by the two sentences, it is not possible to determine for certain that the second sentence is entailed by the first one. The first sentence allows for the possibility that the speaker has read a lot of the author's work in a short period of time, while the second sentence specifically mentions a long time.

Cries of farewell and loud wailing came from the battlements above and from the open gateway, as the condemned emerged from the fortress, a long line of men and women in black. Roland's heartbeat broke its rhythm. During the fifteen days of grace granted under the terms of surrender, he had waited in camp with the other crusaders. Now that Diane and Perrin were safely off on the road to Paris, he felt impelled to be with the Cathars in their final moments, to bear witness. He had volunteered, despite his dread, to help escort the prisoners to their execution. Those Cathars who joined the Catholic religion would now be allowed to leave in peace, though they would be forced to give everything they owned to the Church and wear the yellow crosses for the rest of their lives. But those who clung to their faith would die. As the Cathars emerged, a man-at-arms directed each to stop at a table beside the doorway, where two Dominican friars sat with parchment scrolls. The friars recorded the name of each person about to die. This meticulous record-keeping, Roland thought, was one source of the Inquisition's power.

Given the question: Process:  - Sunlight hits chloroplasts in the plant - The energy from the sunlight causes an enzyme in the plant to break apart the water - The water breakes into oxygen, hydrogen, and electrons - Hydrogen, along with electrons energized by light, converts NADP into NADPH - Oxygen diffuses out of the plant as a waste product of photosynthesis -   Perturbation hypothesis: suppose it is raining happens, how will it affect less sunlight hits chloroplasts.  Does the supposed perturbation have an effect (direct or indirect) on the process? The answer is:","output":"Yes, the supposed perturbation of rain resulting in less sunlight hitting the chloroplasts will have an indirect effect on the process of photosynthesis.  Step-by-step explanation: 1. Sunlight is a crucial component for the process of photosynthesis, as it provides the energy required to initiate the reaction. 2. If it's raining and cloudy, less sunlight will reach the plant's chloroplasts, which will, in turn, limit the plant's ability to efficiently carry out photosynthesis. 3. With limited sunlight, the energy available to break apart water molecules into oxygen, hydrogen, and electrons will also be reduced. This will lower the overall rate of the photosynthesis process. 4. The production of NADPH, which is an essential molecule for the Calvin cycle and the creation of glucose, will decrease due to the limited availability of energized hydrogen and electrons. 5. Consequently, the plant's overall growth and energy production will be affected, as photosynthesis is the primary way in which plants convert sunlight into usable energy. To summarize, the perturbation of rain and the resulting decrease in sunlight will have an indirect effect on the photosynthesis process. The reduced availability of sunlight will limit the efficiency of the reaction, leading to decreased production of vital molecules such as oxygen and NADPH, and ultimately impacting the plant's growth and energy production."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant, who knows every language and how to translate one language to another.

Answer a question about this article: Due to the patriarchal nature of Arab society, Arab men, including during the slave trade in North Africa, enslaved more black women than men. They used more black female slaves in domestic service and agriculture than males. The men interpreted the Qur'an to permit sexual relations between a male master and his female slave outside of marriage (see Ma malakat aymanukum and sex), leading to many mixed-race children. When an enslaved woman became pregnant with her Arab master's child, she was considered as umm walad or \\"mother of a child\\", a status that granted her privileged rights. The child was given rights of inheritance to the father's property, so mixed-race children could share in any wealth of the father. Because the society was patrilineal, the children took their fathers' social status at birth and were born free. What were female slaves used for?","output":"Female slaves were mainly used for domestic work and helping in agriculture. They took care of the household chores and helped in farming.

OPT:  + unacceptable  + acceptable","output":"A linguist would likely consider the sentence \\"This polish cleans, protects, and shines.\\" to be acceptable linguistically as it conforms to the general rules and principles of grammar, syntax, and semantics. The sentence properly conveys a coherent and meaningful message that an English speaker can understand and interpret. Let's break down the components of the sentence to analyze its linguistic acceptability. 1. Grammar: The sentence follows standard English grammar rules. The subject, \\"This polish,\\" is a noun phrase that refers to a specific object or product. The verbs in the sentence, \\"cleans,\\" \\"protects,\\" and \\"shines,\\" are simple present tense forms and are parallel in structure. The use of commas to separate the verbs is also a proper grammatical application of listing several actions related to the subject. 2. Syntax: The sentence is structured appropriately, with the subject at the beginning (This polish) followed by the main verbs and their respective objects. The proper comma usage in the list of actions makes the sentence syntactically sound. 3. Semantics: The meaning of the sentence is clear and unambiguous. It conveys the notion that the stated polish has multiple functions like cleaning, protecting, and shining. Each verb in the sentence describes a specific quality or action of the polish, and these actions are related to the intended purpose of the product, which would most likely be to care for and maintain the appearance of an object or surface. 4. Cohesion: The sentence is coherent and cohesive since the verbs used are all related to the primary subject - the polish. Each action provided can be understood as a feature or benefit of the polish and communicates its value and function. Based on these points, a linguist would deem the sentence \\"This polish cleans, protects, and shines.\\" to be acceptable from a linguistic perspective. It meets the necessary criteria for proper grammar, syntax, semantics, and cohesion, resulting in a clear and comprehensible message."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.
