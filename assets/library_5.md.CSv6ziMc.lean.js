Acromyrmex heyeri workers construct the colonies nest by thatching together cut grass. At temperatures ranging from 20–30 °C, workers created more openings in the nest thatch as the internal nest temperature goes up as a method of temperature regulation for the colony. The workers will close openings in the nest thatch as the air humidity surrounding the nest decreases to reduce water loss for the colony.  Paragraph: In the ant world a war has been waged. Two rival groups of Acromyrmex heyeri ants, group A and group B, are battling each other to gain territory. The goal is to attack the rival group when they have more openings in their nest thatch. In battle day one group A territory had 5 °C temperature. In battle day two group A territory had 22 °C temperature. In battle day three group A territory had low air humidity. In battle day four group A territory had high air humidity.  Given the paragraph above, please answer correctly the following question: In battle day two would group A have less openings or more openings in their nest thatch? The answer to this question is:","output":"In battle day two, group A would have more openings in their nest thatch. This is because, as mentioned in the background information, Acromyrmex heyeri workers create more openings in the nest thatch as the internal nest temperature goes up in order to regulate the temperature for the colony. On battle day two, group A territory had a temperature of 22 °C, which falls within the range of 20–30 °C where the workers are known to create more openings for temperature regulation. Therefore, it can be concluded that on battle day two, group A would have more openings in their nest thatch as a method of maintaining an optimal environment for the colony."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Deena no longer keeps any of her promises, skips school and leaves the family home whenever she pleases. Her newfound harsh attitude upsets her mother, Cynthia, who once enjoyed a close relationship with her daughter. Cynthia is frustrated because the lines of communication have broken down between mother and daughter. Cynthia's relationship with her own mother is not entirely pleasant. Although Cynthia's alcoholic mother advises her daughter to be stricter with Deena, Cynthia does not  heed the advice. For example, she tidies Deena's bedroom, a chore which Cynthia has consistently and politely reminded her daughter to do.

One of the aliens raises its weapon and burns Brian's hand. They rush back to the house and try to convince their incredulous family to flee while there is still time. They see lights in the sky and a furtive figure outside a window, but the family refuses to believe the brothers' story until Tommy plays them the tape. Suddenly, a high-frequency screech incapacitates everyone but five-year-old Rose. When it stops, Kurt straps a flashlight to his shotgun and decides to get everyone in his truck and leave.

The thieves need a way to smuggle the two tons of gold bars into Europe. There are only four master criminals considered able to smuggle the gold: a Frenchman, so crippled he can barely move his wheelchair; an Irishman, so nearsighted that he is arrested after trying to hold up a police station instead of a bank; a German, so fat he can barely get through a door â and Aldo Vanucci (Peter Sellers), also known as The Fox, a master criminal with a talent for disguise. Vanucci is in prison. He knows about the smuggling contract, but is reluctant to accept it, because he does not want to disgrace his mother and young sister, Gina (Britt Ekland). However, when his three sidekicks inform him that Gina has grown up and does not always come home after school, an enraged, over-protective Vanucci vows to escape. He succeeds by impersonating the prison doctor and convincing the guards that Vanucci has tied him up and escaped. The guards capture the real doctor and bring him face to face with Vanucci, who flees with the aid of his gang. Vanucci returns home where his mother tells him that Gina is working on the Via Veneto. Vanucci takes this to mean that Gina is a prostitute. Disguised as a priest, Aldo sees Gina, who is provocatively dressed, flirting and kissing a fat, middle-aged man.

It offered me a program, \\"Equestrian Therapy Program\\" ,whose mission is to build self-esteem and confidence in children who have been through difficult times in their lives. Being with animals was the only time I truly felt 1 had a place in the world. But I had never been around a horse in my life. I found myself a little apprehensive during my first day--being around such large strong animals was much harder than the three cats I'm accustomed to caring for. I found that I wasn't different during my first day around these fantastic creatures from the kids who came into the program. But there is a strange transformation when one is around horses. I found myself playing the role of student, observer, teacher, mentor, worker, friend, and companion; not only to the kids,but to the horses and staff! Before long, I was good at handling the horses and kids and having a grand time working with human and animal elements equally. I realize this experience has helped me to develop my horizons in ways I never thought likely. I started this wanting to give others help and realized in doing so I was the one who really benefited the most. 1 believe the companionship and peace that comes from working with our animal brothers is something that can and will make the world a better place!

Pierre Benjamin Monteux (pronounced [pjɛʁ mɔ̃.tø]; 4 April 1875 – 1 July 1964) was a French (later American) conductor. After violin and viola studies, and a decade as an orchestral player and occasional conductor, he began to receive regular conducting engagements in 1907.  He came to prominence when, for Sergei Diaghilev's Ballets Russes company between 1911 and 1914, he conducted the world premieres of Stravinsky's The Rite of Spring and other prominent works including Petrushka, Ravel's Daphnis et Chloé, and Debussy's Jeux. Thereafter he directed orchestras around the world for more than half a century. From 1917 to 1919 Monteux was the principal conductor of the French repertoire at the Metropolitan Opera in New York. He led the Boston Symphony Orchestra (1919–24), Amsterdam Concertgebouw Orchestra (1924–34), Orchestre Symphonique de Paris (1929–38) and San Francisco Symphony (1936–52).  In 1961, aged eighty-six, he accepted the chief conductorship of the London Symphony Orchestra, a post which he held until his death three years later.  Although known for his performances of the French repertoire, his chief love was the music of German composers, above all Brahms. He disliked recording, finding it incompatible with spontaneity, but he nevertheless made a substantial number of records. Monteux was well known as a teacher. In 1932 he began a conducting class in Paris, which he developed into a summer school that was later moved to his summer home in Les Baux in the south of France. After moving permanently to the US in 1942, and taking American citizenship, he founded a school for conductors and orchestral musicians in Hancock, Maine. Among his students in France and America who went on to international fame were Lorin Maazel, Igor Markevitch, Neville Marriner, Seiji Ozawa, André Previn  and David Zinman. The school in Hancock has continued since Monteux's death. The answer to this question is:","output":"Monteux"},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant. User will you give you a task.

Read the following article and answer the question. Article: In the 1500s, South American fishermen said that the sea became warmer every few years. They gave this special event a Spanish name 'El Nino', meaning 'the baby'. It is called 'the baby' because it arrives around Christmas. El Nino is a huge area of warm water in the middle of cold water in the Pacific Ocean. It happens every two to seven years. It moves around the ocean and becomes bigger and smaller at different times. This warm water affects the weather. It is always raining over El Nino. El Nino contains a lot of energy. Scientists think this energy is formed when wind comes from the northern half of the world. The winds blow across warm sea water in the south. When the strong wind hits the warm water, violent weather happens. Scientists think that El Nino existed for many thousands of years. El Nino affects every person in the world because it affects the entire world's weather. It can bring the rain that farmers need. It can bring storms that destroy homes. It can mean that fishermen cannot catch fish, and it can bring floods. There is nothing we can do about El Nino. It is an event of nature. We can help the world's weather by trying to stop the greenhouse effect and air pollution. The most important job for scientists is to learn how to predict when El Nino is going to bring dangerous weather. Then, people can try to prepare for storms, floods and droughts. New technology like satellite pictures and temperature measuring equipment can help. Still, it is very hard to say when or where El Nino will cause damage. Question: It happens   _  .

What might be the first step of the process? Answer:","output":"The first step of the digestion process is the consumption of food and its entry into the mouth. It is here that the process of mechanical digestion begins as the food is chewed by the teeth. The chewing action not only breaks down the food into smaller particles but also increases the surface area, making it easier for the enzymes in saliva to act upon. As the food is being chewed, the salivary glands in the mouth release saliva, a digestive fluid containing enzymes like salivary amylase. This enzyme initiates the breakdown of carbohydrates present in the food. While chewing, the tongue helps to mix the food with saliva, allowing the enzymes to properly coat the food particles and making it easier for the food to be swallowed as a cohesive and moist bolus.

The time period comes first, followed by the locations: \\"Angeles City\\" and \\"Manila.\\" The sequence of events is clarified with the conjunction \\"before,\\" which shows that moving to Manila happened after her initial years spent in Angeles City. In sentence 2, the sentence structure is more straightforward and active. The subject \\"She\\" is clearly mentioned at the beginning, followed by the verb \\"spent.\\" The time period and locations are conveyed in a similar manner as in sentence 1, with \\"the first six years of her childhood\\" indicating the duration, and \\"Angeles City\\" and \\"Manila\\" showing where she lived during these periods.

Q:Burma had many tropical forests, while a sister country from a temperate climate, Belarus, had beautiful ancient temperate forests. Both countries were significant lumber exporters.  Which country had a longer growing season? A:","output":"The length of the growing season in a country is determined by its climate. In the case of Burma (now Myanmar) and Belarus, the geographical location and distinctive climatic conditions of each significantly influence their growing seasons.  Burma, located in Southeast Asia, enjoys a tropical monsoon climate. It has three specific seasons: the hot season (March to April), the rainy season (May to October), and the cool season (November to February). However, given it's a tropical climate, the region experiences relatively high temperatures throughout the year, leading to a long growing season. Even the distinction between seasons in a tropical zone like Burma is more related to rainfall than temperature. And thanks to the tropical climate's ample sunlight and warmth, plants can grow year-round, making Burma's effective growing season quite extensive. Contrarily, Belarus, located in Eastern Europe, has a temperate continental climate with relatively mild summers and long, cold winters, which limit its growing season. The Belarusian growing season typically starts in late April or early May and ends by mid-October. Once winter sets in, the drop in temperature, the frost, and the snow leave the ground too cold for plant growth. So, while anytime from May through October can be considered as having suitable conditions for growth, the growing season is limited by these harsh winters. Comparing both countries, even though they are both significant lumber exporters, Burma's tropical climate provides it with a longer growing season relative to Belarus's temperate continental climate. This extended growing season in Burma allows it to sustain tropical rainforests rich with a diverse range of flora, including many hardwood tree species suitable for lumber. On the other hand, Belarus' temperate forests have seasonal variations that lead to a shorter growing season, but they support a different set of tree species also used for lumber production.  It's also important to note that while a longer growing season can enhance lumber output, it doesn't necessarily denote the value or quality of the produced lumber. The specific type of trees and the lumber properties they have, which can vary greatly between tropical and temperate forests, significantly affect their uses and demand in global markets."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant that follows instruction extremely well.

Information:  - In a modern sense, comedy (from the , \\"kmidía\\") refers to any discourse or work generally intended to be humorous or amusing by inducing laughter, especially in theatre, television, film, and stand-up comedy. The origins of the term are found in Ancient Greece. In the Athenian democracy, the public opinion of voters was influenced by the political satire performed by the comic poets at the theaters. The theatrical genre of Greek comedy can be described as a dramatic performance which pits two groups or societies against each other in an amusing agon or conflict. Northrop Frye depicted these two opposing sides as a \\"Society of Youth\\" and a \\"Society of the Old\\". A revised view characterizes the essential agon of comedy as a struggle between a relatively powerless youth and the societal conventions that pose obstacles to his hopes. In this struggle, the youth is understood to be constrained by his lack of social authority, and is left with little choice but to take recourse in ruses which engender very dramatic irony which provokes laughter.  - Melanie Clare Sophie \\"Mel\\" Giedroyc (born 5 June 1968) is an English presenter, actress and comedian, best known for her comedy work with Sue Perkins, co-hosting series including \\"Light Lunch\\" for Channel 4, \\"The Great British Bake Off\\" for the BBC and chat show \\"Mel and Sue\\" for ITV.  - BBC One is the flagship television channel of the British Broadcasting Corporation in the United Kingdom, Isle of Man and Channel Islands. It was launched on 2 November 1936 as the BBC Television Service, and was the world's first regular television service with a high level of image resolution. It was renamed BBC TV in 1960, using this name until the launch of sister channel BBC2 in 1964, whereupon the BBC TV channel became known as BBC1, with the current spelling adopted in 1997.  - The United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland, commonly known as the United Kingdom (UK) or Britain, is a sovereign country in western Europe. Lying off the north-western coast of the European mainland, it includes the island of Great Britain (the name of which is also loosely applied to the whole country), the north-eastern part of the island of Ireland, and many smaller islands. Northern Ireland is the only part of the UK that shares a land border with another sovereign statethe Republic of Ireland. Apart from this land border, the UK is surrounded by the Atlantic Ocean, with the North Sea to its east, the English Channel to its south and the Celtic Sea to its south-south-west, giving it the 12th-longest coastline in the world. The Irish Sea lies between Great Britain and Ireland. With an area of , the UK is the 78th-largest sovereign state in the world and the 11th-largest in Europe. It is also the 21st-most populous country, with an estimated 65.1 million inhabitants. Together, this makes it the fourth most densely populated country in the European Union.  - The British Broadcasting Corporation (BBC) is a British public service broadcaster. It is headquartered at Broadcasting House in London, is the world's oldest national broadcasting organisation, and is the largest broadcaster in the world by number of employees, with over 20,950 staff in total, of whom 16,672 are in public sector broadcasting; including part-time, flexible as well as fixed contract staff, the total number is 35,402.  - Light Lunch was a Channel 4 lunch-time comedy chatshow broadcast on weekdays at 12:30 between March 1997 and February 1998. It starred Mel and Sue (Sue Perkins and Mel Giedroyc). The show was a huge success initially but audience figures declined slowly eventually resulting in low viewer figures and was deemed \\"unsatisfactory\\" by Channel 4.  - Susan Elizabeth \\"Sue\\" Perkins (born 22 September 1969) is an English comedian, broadcaster, actress and writer, born in East Dulwich, London. Originally coming to prominence through her comedy partnership with Mel Giedroyc in \\"Mel and Sue\\", she has since become best known as a radio broadcaster and TV presenter, notably of \\"The Great British Bake Off\\" (20102016) and \\"Insert Name Here\\" (2016present).  - Irony, in its broadest sense, is a rhetorical device, literary technique, or event in which what appears, on the surface, to be the case, differs radically from what is actually the case. Irony may be divided into categories such as verbal, dramatic, and situational. Verbal, dramatic, and situational irony are often used for emphasis in the assertion of a truth. The ironic form of simile, used in sarcasm, and some forms of litotes can emphasize one's meaning by the deliberate use of language which states the opposite of the truth, denies the contrary of the truth, or drastically and obviously understates a factual connection.  - Channel 4 is a British public-service television broadcaster that began transmission on 2 November 1982. Although largely commercially self-funded, it is ultimately publicly owned; originally a subsidiary of the Independent Broadcasting Authority (IBA), the station is now owned and operated by Channel Four Television Corporation, a public corporation of the Department for Culture, Media & Sport, which was established in 1990 and came into operation in 1993. With the conversion of the Wenvoe transmitter group in Wales to digital on 31 March 2010, Channel 4 became a UK-wide TV channel for the first time.  - The Channel Islands (Norman: \\"Îles d'la Manche\\", French: \\"Îles Anglo-Normandes\\" or \\"Îles de la Manche\\") are an archipelago in the English Channel, off the French coast of Normandy. They include two Crown dependencies: the Bailiwick of Jersey, consisting of Jersey, the largest of the islands; and the Bailiwick of Guernsey, consisting of Guernsey, Alderney, Sark and some smaller islands. They are considered the remnants of the Duchy of Normandy, and although they are not part of the United Kingdom, it is responsible for the defence and international relations of the islands. The Crown dependencies are not members of the Commonwealth of Nations nor of the European Union. They have a total population of about 168,000, and the bailiwicks' respective capitals, Saint Helier and Saint Peter Port, have populations of 33,500 and 16,488, respectively. The total area of the islands is 198 km.  - Television or TV is a telecommunication medium used for transmitting moving images in monochrome (black-and-white), or in color, and in two or three dimensions and sound. It can refer to a television set, a television program (\\"TV show\\"), or the medium of television transmission. Television is a mass medium, for entertainment, education, news, and advertising.  - A film, also called a movie, motion picture, theatrical film or photoplay, is a series of still images which, when shown on a screen, creates the illusion of moving images due to the phi phenomenon. This optical illusion causes the audience to perceive continuous motion between separate objects viewed rapidly in succession. The process of filmmaking is both an art and an industry. A film is created by photographing actual scenes with a motion picture camera; by photographing drawings or miniature models using traditional animation techniques; by means of CGI and computer animation; or by a combination of some or all of these techniques and other visual effects.  - Herman Northrop Frye (July 14, 1912  January 23, 1991) was a Canadian literary critic and literary theorist, considered one of the most influential of the 20th century.  - Political satire is a significant part of satire that specializes in gaining entertainment from politics; it has also been used with subversive intent where political speech and dissent are forbidden by a regime, as a method of advancing political arguments where such arguments are expressly forbidden.  - Stand-up comedy is a comic style in which a comedian performs in front of a live audience, usually speaking directly to them. The performer is commonly known as a comic, stand-up comic, stand-up comedian, or simply a stand-up. In stand-up comedy, the comedian usually recites a grouping of humorous stories, jokes and one-liners typically called a monologue, routine, or act. Some stand-up comedians use props, music, or magic tricks to \\"enhance\\" their acts. Stand-up comedy is often performed in comedy clubs, bars and pubs, nightclubs, neo-burlesques, colleges and theatres. Outside of live performance, stand-up is often distributed commercially via television, DVD, CD and the internet.  - The Isle of Man, also known simply as Mann, is a self-governing crown dependency in the Irish Sea between England and Northern Ireland. The head of state is Queen Elizabeth II, who holds the title of Lord of Mann. The Lord of Mann is represented by a Lieutenant Governor. Foreign relations and defence are the responsibility of the British Government.  - Satire is a genre of literature, and sometimes graphic and performing arts, in which vices, follies, abuses, and shortcomings are held up to ridicule, ideally with the intent of shaming individuals, corporations, government, or society itself into improvement. Although satire is usually meant to be humorous, its greater purpose is often constructive social criticism, using wit to draw attention to both particular and wider issues in society.  - A double act, also known as a comedy duo, is a comic pairing in which humor is derived from the uneven relationship between two partners, usually of the same gender, age, ethnic origin and profession but drastically different in terms of personality or behavior. Often one of the members of the duothe straight man, feed, dead wood, or stoogeis portrayed as reasonable and serious, while the other onethe funny man, banana man or comicis portrayed as funny, less educated or less intelligent, silly, or unorthodox. If the audience identifies primarily with one character, the other will often be referred to as a comic foil. The term \\"feed\\" comes from the way a straight man is wont to set up jokes and \\"feed\\" them to his partner.  - A television channel is a physical or virtual channel over which a television station or television network is distributed. For example, in North America, \\"channel 2\\" refers to the broadcast or cable band of 54 to 60 MHz, with carrier frequencies of 55.25 MHz for NTSC analog video (VSB) and 59.75 MHz for analog audio (FM), or 55.31 MHz for digital ATSC (8VSB).

More recently they have hosted the BAFTA Award - winning BBC One cookery series The Great British Bake Off .  - Laughter is a physical reaction in humans and some other species of primate, consisting typically of rhythmical, often audible contractions of the diaphragm and other parts of the respiratory system. It is a response to certain external or internal stimuli. Laughter can arise from such activities as being tickled, or from humorous stories or thoughts. Most commonly, it is considered a visual expression of a number of positive emotional states, such as joy, mirth, happiness, relief, etc. On some occasions, however, it may be caused by contrary emotional states such as embarrassment, apology, or confusion such as nervous laughter or courtesy laugh. Age, gender, education, language, and culture are all factors as to whether a person will experience laughter in a given situation.

Context: U.S. President Donald Trump attempted to reset his relationship with Africa on Monday, as he hosted Nigerian President Muhammadu Buhari. Buhari is the first sub-Saharan African leader to have a White House summit with Trump, who has been criticized for reportedly making derogatory comments about Africa. During his public remarks with Buhari, Trump focused mostly on common goals and shared interests, such as fighting terrorism and expanding trade. \\"We love helicopters — he loves them more than I do,\\" joked Trump, referring to his administration's decision to approve a 600 million military sales deal to Nigeria. Buhari thanked Trump for approving the deal, which the administration of former President Barack Obama had suspended over allegations of human rights abuses. \\"I worked it out so that now you can buy the helicopters that you want,\\" Trump said, adding, \\"We make the best military equipment in the world, and our friends can now buy it.\\" Human rights groups have accused the Nigerian military of torture, rape and extrajudicial killing in its almost decade-long campaign against the Boko Haram extremist group. Tens of thousands of people have been killed in the insurgency, and hundreds of schoolgirls kidnapped, as the group gained notoriety and spread to neighboring countries, posing one of the most severe threats to West Africa's Sahel region in recent years. Although Nigeria has been a major partner in the U.S. fight against Islamist extremists in Africa, relations have faced challenges over the past year.

Write some highlights for the following article: In 1981, Dr Mohga Kamal-Yanni was preparing to leave Egypt for a clinical attachment in England when her father had a heart attack. He fell in the street, and was taken to a public hospital, where Dr Kamal-Yanni kept vigil at his bedside until he regained his strength. A doctor at a hospital in India where health indicators have showed no significant improvement  in seven years. During his stay in the hospital, she was appalled at the low level of healthcare available to him. \\"It was awful. There was no medicine,\\" she told CNN. As a doctor, Kamal-Yanni was able to watch over her father's progress. Her professional opinion on his recovery was striking. \\"My father survived that heart attack for two reasons,\\" she said. \\"One, because of God's will, and two, because he had a strong will. It was nothing to do with the health service.\\" The following year, Kamal-Yanni came to England to do a clinical attachment. She found herself deeply affected by the stark contrast between the healthcare available in Britain, on the publicly funded National Health Service, and the healthcare available at home in Egypt. She found herself slipping into depression. \\"I couldn't talk to the patients; I couldn't talk to the doctors. I just couldn't cope with it,\\" she revealed to CNN. \\"I couldn't understand why every time I saw a monitor next to a patient I was so upset.\\" It dawned on her that the gulf in care was troubling her. \\"I kept thinking why on earth my dad didn't have that. The only reason was that he happened to be born in Egypt and these people had the luck to be born [in England].\\" Kamal-Yanni is now a senior health & HIV policy advisor at third-world charity Oxfam. Her first-hand experience of the divide between the healthcare available in richer countries, and that on offer in poorer ones, has given her the impetus to try and narrow the gap. While Western countries are pushing the boundaries of scientific knowledge, discovering the potential of nanotechnology and other high-tech solutions to the developed world's diseases, like diabetes, cancer and obesity, poor countries are struggling to combat health problems such as HIV, malaria and TB. Lack of infrastructure. And it's not as simple as shipping medicines and supplies in bulk quantities. Oxfam's \\"Paying for People\\" report, published in February this year, said that poor countries are suffering because they lack the infrastructure of a health service. The WHO's 2006 \\"World Health Report\\" also indicates that 4.25 million doctors, nurses and health workers are needed across 57 countries. Sub-Saharan Africa, for example, has 600,000 health workers: one million more are required. Without these key workers, it is questionable whether healthcare in poor countries can be improved. Nicky Wimble, a spokesperson for Oxfam, told CNN, \\"There is money coming in for drugs now, but there's no commitment to long-term aid.\\" Governments are unable to give healthcare workers with job security and doctors and nurses, where they do exist, are largely poorly paid: so people choose other careers. \\"They're either becoming taxi drivers, or working for private businesses,\\" Wimble says. This double brain-drain (one internal, one external as those who do train are tempted away by higher salaries and brighter futures in developed countries) means that even if drugs make it to poorer areas, there can be no one to administer them. \\"Drugs are sitting in cupboards,\\" Wimble told CNN. \\"Or they're available in cities but people in rural areas don't have the bus fares to get to them.\\" Vulnerable to disease. Dr Kamal-Yanni backs this up. She told CNN, \\"There is no public investment in health systems so people have to pay for it. If you're poor you can't buy your healthcare and if you're a woman who happens to be poor you might as well forget it.\\" And in countries where no healthcare system exists, people are extremely vulnerable to diseases, which can spread rampantly and unchecked through communities. Dr Kamal-Yanni paints a worrying picture. \\"Particularly in Africa, they're not equipped to face anything -- not HIV, let alone avian flu. If something like avian flu hit Africa with no health system, no health workers and no money, it would spread. We can't contain it in Africa. The world would wake up and realize that, but in the meantime, it would have wiped out goodness knows how many millions of people.\\" It's not just in Africa. HIV is a known crisis there, but it is anticipated that more people will be infected in India than anywhere else, as the disease spreads quickly through its billion-strong population. Increasingly, countries like these are having to deal with a boom in incommunicable diseases, like diabetes and cancer. Chronic diseases like diabetes have the additional problem that they require long-term care, and therefore long-term funding. Dr Kamal-Yanni explained the difficulties of that situation. \\"You buy the pills today, but maybe tomorrow you don't have enough money so you're never cured and develop complications.\\" What lies ahead? Dr Kamal-Yanni sees three possible outcomes for health in poor countries. The first, as she explained, is bleak. She told CNN, \\"If things continue as they are, with rising infection, increasing resistance to drugs, HIV and malaria run unchecked, chronic and non-communicable diseases are ignored and no money is spent on a health system, then the gap will just increase and the situation will get worse and worse.\\" Dr Kamal-Yanni is hopeful, however, that the situation will improve somewhat. She explained a second scenario, the one she feels is most likely to happen. \\"If the international community invests a little bit, things will be slightly better,\\" she told CNN. \\"More people with HIV will get treatment, as will people with TB and malaria. But non-communicable chronic diseases [like diabetes] will be ignored.\\" But large-scale epidemics like avian flu or SARS would still remain a huge threat in this scenario, as would diseases like cancer. \\"Who's going to pay for medicine for cancer, which is increasing like anything in developing countries?\\" asks Dr Kamal-Yanni. \\"Nobody.\\" Hope for the future. But there is a third scenario, which holds out more hope for people in developing countries. Dr Kamal-Yanni says, \\"If public pressure is high, southern governments, donors and the international community will decide that health is really a priority. We'll put our money where our mouth is and we'll fulfil the commitments that we've made before.\\" She says that in the first instance, African countries need to be encouraged to divert 16 percent of their budget to health. (Currently, nearly a third allocate less than five percent.) \\"Then they will realize that this is not enough, so they'll put in more,\\" she continues. If this money were to be added to the 50 billion promised by G8, the Group of Eight leading industrialized nations, in Gleneagles in 2005, it would have a huge impact on health and education, particularly in Africa. And education is the key, Dr Kamal-Yanni believes. She explained, \\"You can't separate health and education because unless you educate doctors and nurses, and midwives and pharmacists, you can't run a health service.\\" Working together. It's also important for donors and governments to work together to provide a cohesive service, she says. \\"They really need to start coordinating their work so it's not a series of vertical programs that don't relate to each other and waste resources.\\" Oxfam's Nicky Wimble agrees. She told CNN, \\"Over the last 100 years, countries like France, Britain and America have developed by giving their people free education and healthcare. It's a major way to bring people out of poverty.\\" Wimble cites the example of education, where the number of children not in school worldwide has fallen from around 120 million to around 80 million. \\"The key is getting governments to commit to it as a part of their aid package, and monitoring the aid package so that the money is tracked to ensure that it gets to where it's intended,\\" she said. \\"It's working for education, and they think it'll work for healthcare too, but it needs committed investment.\\" And in the meantime, people like Mohga Kamal-Yanni will continue their work to pressure governments to encourage positive change. She says, \\"That's my motivation to do this work. It's not for me; it's a life thing. My dream in life is for everybody in Africa to have access to a publicly financed, publicly run healthcare service with strong regulation, quality, care and equity.\\" E-mail to a friend.

Do you think the right answer to the question \\"what absorbs sunlight? \\" is \\"earth orbiting the Sun\\", given that  solar panels absorb sunlight. ?","output":"In order to determine the right answer to the question \\"what absorbs sunlight?\\" I'll analyze the two options provided: Option 1: Earth orbiting the Sun Option 2: Solar panels Step 1: Understanding the context of the options Both options are related to the absorption of sunlight. Earth receives and absorbs sunlight due to its orbit around the Sun, which allows sunlight to reach its surface, be absorbed by various materials, and subsequently support life. Solar panels, on the other hand, are specifically designed to absorb sunlight and convert it into usable electricity. Step 2: Comparing the scope of the options Between the two options, solar panels have a narrower scope as they specifically focus on the absorption and conversion of sunlight for a specific purpose (electricity generation). Earth orbiting the Sun has a broader scope as it involves a variety of absorption-types and processes (heat, energy for photosynthesis, etc.), not solely electricity generation. Step 3: Choosing the most appropriate answer Given that solar panels absorb sunlight and have a more specific purpose, the better answer to the question \\"what absorbs sunlight?\\" would be \\"solar panels.\\" This is because the context of the question is likely about the absorption and conversion of sunlight for a practical application and not specifically about the general concept of Earth being illuminated by the Sun. However, it's important to note that there are other possible answers too, such as plants (they absorb sunlight for photosynthesis) and various surfaces on Earth that absorb sunlight for heating purposes. The context of the question should guide the choice of the most appropriate answer."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant. You will be given a task. You must generate a detailed and long answer.

However, we can consider each option and make a logical choice based on the provided information. Option 1: The man ends with a walk along a rocky beach and carrying his skateboard on his right shoulder. This option seems plausible since the man is already on the move, skating through different areas. Ending his journey at a beach is probable, and carrying his skateboard could indicate the end of his skating session. Option 2: The man finally parallels the walkway showing music while also passing houses. This can be seen as a possibility considering he is already passing houses, but the statement \\"showing music\\" feels out of context, as there was no earlier reference to any music-related activity. Option 3: The man walks and gains leg room. This statement is a bit ambiguous as it's unclear what it means for the man to \\"gain leg room\\". If it's referring to him getting off his skateboard and walking, it could potentially be a logical sequence, but the \\"leg room\\" part doesn't quite align with the given context. Option 4: The man turns quickly to continue doing his walkthroughs with his dogs, then transitions back into the same man dancing. This option introduces two new elements - dogs and dancing. Given that there was no previous mention of him having dogs or dancing, this ending seems less probable compared to others. In conclusion, on evaluating all the options, Option 1: \\"The man ends with a walk along a rocky beach and carrying his skateboard on his right shoulder\\" appears to be the most plausible and coherent ending based on the initial narrative. It appears to be a smooth transition and logical continuation of his journey with the skateboard."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant. User will you give you a task.

Please answer the following question: I have a test where I am given the following article, what is an answer for the question: What is the last name of the person who became well-known for his fascination with contrasts in skin tones? ?  William Etty was born in 1787 in York, the son of a miller and baker. He showed artistic promise from an early age, but his family were financially insecure, and at the age of 12 he left school to become an apprentice printer in Hull. On completing his seven-year indenture he moved to London \\"with a few pieces of chalk-crayons in colours\\", with the aim of emulating the Old Masters and becoming a history painter. Etty gained acceptance to the Royal Academy Schools in early 1807. After a year spent studying under renowned portrait painter Thomas Lawrence, Etty returned to the Royal Academy, drawing at the life class and copying other paintings. In 1821 the Royal Academy exhibited one of Etty's works, The Arrival of Cleopatra in Cilicia (also known as The Triumph of Cleopatra). The painting was extremely well received, and many of Etty's fellow artists greatly admired him. He was elected a full Royal Academician in 1828, ahead of John Constable. He became well respected for his ability to capture flesh tones accurately in painting and for his fascination with contrasts in skin tones. Following the exhibition of Cleopatra, Etty attempted to reproduce its success, concentrating on painting further history paintings containing nude figures. He exhibited 15 paintings at the Summer Exhibition in the 1820s (including Cleopatra), and all but one contained at least one nude figure. In so doing Etty became the first English artist to treat nude studies as a serious art form in their own right, capable of being aesthetically attractive and of delivering moral messages. Although some nudes by foreign artists were held in private English collections, Britain had no tradition of nude painting, and the display and distribution of nude material to the public had been suppressed since the 1787 Proclamation for the Discouragement of Vice. The supposed prurient reaction of the lower classes to his nude paintings caused concern throughout the 19th century. Many critics condemned his repeated depictions of female nudity as...

Article: It often happens that a number of applicants with almost the same qualifications and experience all apply for the same position. In their educational background, special skills and work experience, there is little, if anything, to choose between half a dozen candidates. How then does the employer make a choice? Usually on the basis of an interview. There are many arguments for and against the interview as a way of selection. The main argument against it is that it results in a wholly _ decision. As often as not, employers do not choose the best candidate. They choose the candidate who makes a good first impression on them. Some employers, of course, reply to this argument by saying that they have become so experienced in interviewing staff that they are able to make a good assessment of each candidate's likely performance. The main argument in favor of the interview is that an employer is concerned not only with a candidate's ability, but with his or her suitable personality for the particular work situation. Many employers, for example, will overlook occasional mistakes from their secretary if she has a pleasant personality. It is perhaps true to say, therefore, that the real purpose of an interview is not to assess the assessable aspects of each candidate but to make a guess at the things that are hard to measure, such as personality, character and social ability. Unfortunately, both for the employers and applicants for jobs, there are many people of great ability who simply do not interview well. There are also, of course, people who interview extremely well, but are later found to be very unsatisfactory employees. Candidates who interview well tend to be quietly confident, but never boastful , direct and straightforward in their questions and answers; cheerful and friendly, but never over-familiar; and sincerely enthusiastic and optimistic.

January will reveal what is going to happen. ‘We may well get some offers for Saido and if we do the club will deal with them. ‘The chairman has already said he doesn’t want to sell Saido in January so I’m guessing nothing has changed as far as that is concerned.’ Alan Irvine remains adamant Berahino will not be sold during the January transfer window.

Think like you are answering to a five year old. Article: Many anti-dandruff shampoos only have one formula, but others are formulated for different hair types. Focus on finding a shampoo that helps cut down dandruff first; if that shampoo makes your overall hair quality worsen (e.g., making your hair limp, dry, or weak), consider looking for a special formula that contains the same active ingredient while correcting the new problem. While some dandruff shampoos are also available in multiple scents, the smell of your shampoo should be the last concern on your list. Dandruff control and overall hair health maintenance should be of greater concern. While the conditioner itself won't help fight the dandruff, it's important to select a conditioner that won't strip away the active ingredient in the shampoo. Your best bet is to select a conditioner specifically formulated to accompany your shampoo of choice. If you are unable to find a conditioner that matches your shampoo, try to find one made with natural or organic ingredients. Gentle moisturizers are usually best, but stay away from clarifying conditioners. If you eventually decide to introduce a normal shampoo back into your hair care routine, stay away from those containing ingredients ammonium lauryl sulfate and other anionic surfactants, which tend to dry the scalp and worsen the problem. Try to find a sulfate-free shampoo instead. Also note that washing your hair too frequently or not often enough can worsen dandruff. Once your dandruff problem is under control, you should only wash your hair once every other day at most, and at least two or three times per week at minimum. If you are unable to get your dandruff under control on your own, consult your family doctor or dermatologist and ask for a prescription-strength shampoo or steroid lotion. While dandruff is frequently caused by dry skin, it could also be caused by a medical condition, like seborrheic dermatitis, psoriasis, eczema, or fungal infections. Your doctor will be able to determine the cause of your dandruff and work with you to find the best solution for it. What is a summary of what this article is about?","output":"This article talks about finding the right shampoo and conditioner for dealing with dandruff. It suggests focusing on a shampoo that works well on dandruff while keeping your hair healthy, and using a matching conditioner that doesn't remove the shampoo's active ingredient.

You will be given a task. You must generate a detailed and long answer. What is the answer: How many full terms in office did US President F D Roosevelt serve?","output":"Franklin Delano Roosevelt, the 32nd President of the United States, served four terms in office. Elected in November 1932, he assumed the presidency during the Great Depression and held the office until his death in April 1945. However, it's important to note that he only served three full terms and part of a fourth term.  Roosevelt's tenure in the White House can be divided as follows: 1. First Term (1933-1937): Upon taking office, FDR prioritized economic recovery by enacting various policies and programs as part of his New Deal. Aimed at providing relief for the unemployed, fostering recovery for businesses and the economy, and reforming the financial system to prevent future crises, his first term focused on addressing the immediate challenges caused by the Great Depression. 2. Second Term (1937-1941): Building on the foundations of the New Deal, FDR continued implementing social programs and policies in his second term to protect the American people from the harsh economic conditions. Although economic recovery faced setbacks during this period, leading to a recession in 1937-1938, the prevailing global tensions foreshadowed the onset of World War II. Roosevelt responded by pushing for increased military spending and preparedness. 3. Third Term (1941-1945): With Europe engulfed in World War II, and the U.S. responding to the attack on Pearl Harbor, FDR's third term focused on the nation's war efforts. He seamlessly transformed the U.S. economy into a war machine, building alliances and fostering cooperation among the Allied Powers. The strategic decisions made during this period ultimately paved the way for the Allies' victory. 4. Fourth Term (1945): FDR was elected to his historic fourth term in November 1944, with the end of World War II in sight. He attended the Yalta Conference in February 1945, which sought to shape the post-war world order. However, his rapidly declining health led to his untimely death on April 12, 1945, leaving Vice President Harry S. Truman to assume the presidency. Consequently, Roosevelt only served approximately three months of his fourth term. In summary, Franklin Delano Roosevelt served three full terms and the beginning of a fourth term in office as the U.S. President before his death in 1945. It's important to highlight that the 22nd Amendment, ratified in 1951, now imposes a two-term limit on U.S. Presidents, preventing any future president from serving more than two terms in office. Roosevelt remains the only president to have served more than two terms."},{"instruction":"You should describe the task and explain your answer.

The app provides a plethora of customization options, which, for an enthusiast like me who likes to tinker around with settings, is a definite plus. In particular, the ability to adjust CPU frequency and monitor system performance is quite useful for power users. I also appreciate the constant updates made by the developers to ensure the app remains compatible with the latest Android versions. However, there are several areas where the app falls short. Firstly, it requires a certain level of technical understanding to fully exploit, which might not be suitable for the average user. A more intuitive and beginner-friendly interface would definitely make this app more appealing to a wider set of users. Additionally, I have experienced sporadic crashes, which interrupted the user experience and caused some frustration.

Finally, the ads within the app can be intrusive at times, making navigation slightly cumbersome. I wish there was an option to remove them completely.

When historian Jonathan Bass wrote of the incident in 2001, he noted that news of King's incarceration was spread quickly by Wyatt Tee Walker, as planned.  King's supporters sent telegrams about his arrest to the White House. He could have been released on bail at any time, and jail administrators wished him to be released as soon as possible to avoid the media attention while King was in custody.  However, campaign organizers offered no bail in order \\"to focus the attention of the media and national public opinion on the Birmingham situation\\".Twenty-four hours after his arrest, King was allowed to see local attorneys from the SCLC. When Coretta Scott King did not hear from her husband, she called Walker and he suggested that she call President Kennedy directly. Mrs. King was recuperating at home after the birth of their fourth child when she received a call from President Kennedy the Monday after the arrest. The president told her she could expect a call from her husband soon. When Martin Luther King Jr. called his wife, their conversation was brief and guarded; he correctly assumed that his phones were tapped. Several days later, Jacqueline Kennedy called Coretta Scott King to express her concern for King while he was incarcerated.Using scraps of paper given to him by a janitor, notes written on the margins of a newspaper, and later a legal pad given to him by SCLC attorneys, King wrote his essay \\"Letter from Birmingham Jail\\". It responded to eight politically moderate white clergymen who accused King of agitating local residents and not giving the incoming mayor a chance to make any changes. Bass suggested that \\"Letter from Birmingham Jail\\" was pre-planned, as was every move King and his associates made in Birmingham. The essay was a culmination of many of King's ideas, which he had touched on in earlier writings.

Fatt and Cook had been talking about quitting touring for many years; Cook announced his intention to retire first, citing a desire to spend more time with his family, and then Fatt announced his own retirement shortly thereafter.  Page, who was still struggling with his health issues and had stated that his interest was in working with the group's original line-up, was subsequently asked to extend his stay until the end of the year so he would leave alongside Cook and Fatt, to which he agreed.  Cook reported that the original members were confident that the new group would be accepted by the fans because they passed on their founding concepts of early childhood education to Watkins, Gillespie, and Pryce.

Review: playing characters who sometimes feel more like literary conceits than flesh-and-blood humans  Is this movie review sentence negative or positive?","output":"This movie review sentence can be interpreted as having a negative undertone. The reviewer is discussing the characters in the movie, and they mention two specific points that contribute to the negative implication: 1. The reference to \\"literary conceits\\" suggests that the characters are not fully developed or relatable, but rather feel more like abstract ideas or intellectual constructs. This can lead to the audience feeling detached from the story and having a hard time empathizing with the characters, ultimately resulting in a less satisfying movie-watching experience. 2. When the reviewer says that the characters feel like \\"literary conceits\\" rather than \\"flesh-and-blood humans,\\" they are implying that the characters lack depth, complexity, and authenticity. This statement suggests that the moviegoers may struggle to connect with the characters on a personal level, as they seem more like narrative devices employed by the filmmakers to convey a specific concept, instead of being portrayed as genuine, believable individuals. Overall, the movie review sentence points towards a criticism of the film's character development. The reviewer seems to be suggesting that the movie's portrayal of its characters is a weakness, as it does not effectively engage audience members by creating believable, multi-dimensional characters. This could negatively impact the overall reception of the film, given that character development is a crucial aspect of any storytelling medium, and an essential element in establishing an emotional connection between the audience and the narrative."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Background: Merman was born in her maternal grandmother's house located at 359 4th Avenue in Astoria, Queens in New York City in 1908, though she would later emphatically insist that it was actually 1912. Her father, Edward Zimmermann (1879-1977), was an accountant with James H. Dunham & Company, a Manhattan wholesale dry-goods company, and her mother, Agnes (Gardner) Zimmermann (1883-1974), was a teacher. Edward Zimmermann had been raised in the Dutch Reformed Church and his wife was Presbyterian. Context: Merman began to become forgetful with advancing age, and on occasion, had difficulty with her speech. At times her behavior was erratic, causing concern among her friends. On April 7, 1983, she was preparing to travel to Los Angeles to appear on the 55th Academy Awards telecast, when she collapsed in her apartment. Merman was taken to Roosevelt Hospital, where doctors initially thought she had suffered a stroke. However, after undergoing exploratory surgery on April 11, Merman was diagnosed with stage 4 glioblastoma. The New York Times reported that she underwent brain surgery to have the tumor removed, but it was inoperable and her condition was deemed terminal (doctors had given Merman eight and half months to live). The tumor caused Merman to become aphasic, and, as her illness progressed, she lost her hair and her face swelled. According to Merman biographer Brian Kellow, Merman's family and manager did not want the true nature of her condition revealed to the public. Merman's son Robert, Jr., who took charge of her care, later said he chose not to publicly disclose his mother's true condition because Merman strove to keep her personal life private. He stated, \\"Mom truly appreciated [her fans'] presence and their applause. But you shouldn't attempt to be personal--she drew lines, and she could cut you off.\\"  Merman's health eventually stabilized enough for her to be brought back to her apartment in Manhattan. On February 15, 1984, 10 months after she was diagnosed with brain cancer, Merman died at her home in Manhattan at the age of 76. On the evening of Merman's death, all 36 theatres on Broadway dimmed their lights at 9 pm in her honor. A private funeral service for Merman was held in a chapel at St. Bartholomew's Episcopal Church on February 27, after which Merman was cremated at the Frank E. Campbell Funeral Chapel. In accordance with her wishes, Merman's remains were given to her son Robert, Jr. Merman was interred in the Shrine of Remembrance Mausoleum in Colorado Springs, Colorado, next to her daughter Ethel.  On October 10, 1984, an auction of her personal effects, including furniture, artwork, and theatre memorabilia, earned in excess of 120,000 at Christie's East. The 56th Academy Awards, held on April 2, 1984, ended with a performance of \\"There's No Business Like Show Business\\" in tribute to Merman. Question: Was there anything significant done after her death?. Whats the answer?","output":"Yes, after Merman's death, there were a few significant things done to honor her. On the evening she passed away, all 36 Broadway theatres dimmed their lights in her honor. Additionally, the 56th Academy Awards, held on April 2, 1984, ended with a special performance of \\"There's No Business Like Show Business\\" as a tribute to Merman.

The summer of 1975 I'd just graduated from college in Southern California and received a 1968 Ford Capri for a graduation present. I had my first job, in Los Angeles. One Sunday night, thinking myself a very independent gown-up, I left my uncle's place in South Laguna after a visit, without admitting to him that I had less than an eighth of a tank of gas and no cash to buy more on the way to L.A. I pulled onto the Pacific Coast Highway and watched the needle move down as I headed north. When the engine started giving off strong smells, I pulled into a gas station. There was no self-serve then; there were no credit cards, no ATMs. I begged the guy at the station. I could write him a check for gas, I said, or I could sleep in my car and try to walk to a town with a bank the next morning. As he was informing me that I could sleep in my car but he'd have me arrested, a station wagon pulled up to the next pump. The driver--a thin, plain, middle-aged guy--overheard the tail end of my failed request. As the attendant went to serve him, he nodded at me. \\"Fill her tank first,\\" he said. \\"Really?\\" I said. Hope bloomed. \\"Oh, thank you. Thank you. But please. I just need two bucks' worth. I just need to get home.\\" \\"Fill it,\\" he repeated to the attendant. Then he turned to me, \\"You'll do the same one day, for someone else.\\" The author had hoped that the gas station attendant would allow him to pay   _  .

In the story, the author had run out of gas and didn’t have any cash on him. He was trying to negotiate with the gas station attendant, seeking his understanding to allow him to write a check for the gas he needed to continue his journey. At the time, there were no credit cards, no ATMs, and the concept of self-serve at gas stations wasn't in use. The author finds himself in a challenging situation. He proposes to the attendant that he could write a check for the gas or sleep in his car and walk to a town with a bank the next morning, implying that he will withdraw money from the bank to pay back the gas station attendant. However, the attendant refuses him, citing that he would have him arrested before allowing him to pay with a check or promise to pay him later.  The situation is resolved when a middle-aged man, overhearing the author's plight, steps in and instructs the attendant to fill the author’s car tank. He does this with the hope that the author, one day when he’s able, would do the same for someone else in need.

Fiona Salmon, 40, is guilty of cruelty towards seven residents of a care home in St Ives, Cornwall. A care home bully who tormented vulnerable care home residents was found guilty of seven charges of cruelty today. Fiona Salmon sat on one woman's legs to stop her getting out of bed, and washed another woman's face with a flannel so hard she made her nose bleed. This afternoon a jury took just two-and-a-half hours to find her guilty on all seven charges of ill-treating or neglecting residents suffering from insufficient mental capacity. Salmon, 40, committed the offences at Cornwallis Care Services' nursing home in St. Ives, Cornwall between June 2011 and January 2012. Phillip Lee, prosecuting, told Truro Crown Court that Salmon's crimes ranged from pinching and slapping to rough handling. He said Salmon also called residents names such as 'dirty b****' and told them their breath stank of dog mess. Salmon, from Camborne, Cornwall, listened in the dock as former colleague Joanna Clarke gave evidence against her. Miss Clarke told the court: 'One morning Fiona washed a resident's face with a flannel so hard that it caused a nosebleed. 'I also saw her squeezing talcum powder into a woman's face and she called her a grubby b****. 'While helping another patient she flung her on her bed so hard she hit her head on a metal railing, making her cry. 'She also pinched a patient's upper arm and sprayed deodorant in her face.' Miss Clarke added: 'Her behaviour was humiliating and there was no compassion. 'She spoke to them disrespectfully, as if they were not worth anything and as if they were an inconvenience.' Truro Crown Court heard that Fiona Salmon pinched a patient's upper arm and gave another a nosebleed. Fiona Salmon is no longer working at Cornwallis Care Services' nursing home in St Ives, Cornwall. Miss Clarke admitted to the court that she didn't tell anyone of the abuse because she feared no-one would believe her, before eventually telling a friend's mother who told the police. Another colleague, Stephanie Fielding, spoke from behind a screen to describe the horrors that Salmon put the elderly residents through over the seven-month period. She revealed how Salmon once dug her nails into a patient's skin, drawing blood. She added: 'One night we were putting a patient on her bed but she did not want to stay. Fiona decided to sit on her legs to force her. 'She cried out and shouted at Fiona to get off as she was hurting her but she just laughed and carried on for a couple of minutes until I told her to get off. A colleague told the court that Salmon's behaviour was 'humiliating, and there was no compassion' 'Fiona also swore and told a patient her breath smelt like dog mess. The patient said she was sorry.' She also said that when she was washing two male patients, Salmon made a lewd suggestion to her. Salmon listened as another colleague described her as 'cruel'. Jo Martin, defending, argued Miss Clarke was jealous of Salmon because she had been offered day shifts. She also said Miss Fielding instigated the accusations because she fell out with Salmon over a personal matter. Salmon will be sentenced at Truro Crown Court on May 10. Sorry we are unable to accept comments for legal reasons.","output":"Fiona Salmon, a 40-year-old care home worker, was found guilty of cruelty towards seven vulnerable residents at Cornwallis Care Services' nursing home in St Ives, Cornwall. The offences occurred between June 2011 and January 2012, and included a range of abusive actions such as pinching, slapping, and rough handling of the elderly residents. Salmon was also reported to have verbally insulted residents, calling them degrading names and commenting on their hygiene. Joanna Clarke, a former colleague who testified against Salmon in court, recounted incidents where she witnessed Salmon washing a resident's face so hard that the resident's nose bled, as well as other situations where Salmon's rough actions caused residents physical harm. Clarke described Salmon's behavior as humiliating and lacking in compassion, treating the residents as if they were inconveniences. Several other colleagues, including Stephanie Fielding, also provided testimony outlining Salmon's cruel actions towards the residents. While Clarke admitted to initially not reporting the abuse out of fear of not being believed, she eventually confided in a friend's mother, who informed the police. The jury took only two and a half hours to find Salmon guilty on all seven charges of ill-treating or neglecting residents suffering from insufficient mental capacity.

This option effectively conveys the information regarding the current and future weights of Igor, the white lion cub, and Ice, the white Bengal tiger. The focus on the animals' weights sheds light on their growth and how it will eventually impact their relationships with Hugo, the bulldog, who at some point may not be able to physically discipline them during play fights due to their size.

The restaurant opened in 1935, six years after the con‐ The cause of the fire, which broke out about 4:30 A.M., was not determined. How­ever, it was believed to have been caused by spontaneous combustion in a steward's area containing drygoods. Jones Beach firemen noti­fied the Wantagh Fire De­partment, which had the 80 men and eight pieces of equipment on the scene within 10 minutes. The restaurant was on the east side of the center mall, opposite parking fields 4 and 5. Wantagh Fire Chief War­ren Sparke said his men were hampered by lack of water pressure and because it was necessary to stretch hoses as much as 1,400 feet to hydrants. Flames from the burning building, which had closed about 10 A.M., rose 20 to 30 feet as the roof and walls collapsed. Firemen were still wetting down the twisted steel girders and wood beams seven hours after the fire started. Park officials plan to con­vert other park restaurants to serve diners and to expand the service hours at the Ma­rine Dining Room at the west bathhouse and at the Marine Theater's patio buffet.

Context: The Good, The Bad and The Ugly is a great film, and often regarded as one of the greatest films of all time. I never much paid attention to how the film was lit, but on examination I don’t know what I think of the lighting. Maybe i’m totally wrong, but the lighting seems quite obvious when you pay attention to it, which makes me thing it could have been done better? Certainly the lighting is masterfully done, in the way it properly exposes the characters faces and splashes off and around certain props and objects, adding a great deal of dimension to many of the shots. But it does look quite obvious, once you pay attention to it, especially when you can see multiple shadows coming from a single character. All that said, the lighting is still pretty masterful and I’m very intrigued to properly analyse it. The first shot of the scene has extremely beautiful (even though it is obvious 😉 ) lighting. As the cowboy stands in the hallway you can tell that there is a strong key light coming from the left of the frame, that will light his face once he steps out of the shadows. It seems like there is another light, maybe coming from high up near the roof, lighting the right hand side of the frame, near the back of the hallway. Most likely facing towards the character to light him from his right hand side, to seperate him from the background. The lighting setup of this shot is extremely beautiful the way it enhances the various pieces of wood and props within the frame, and how they’ve managed to keep the cowboy drenched in shadows as he sneaks around, even though there is quite a lot of light within the frame. It looks like they may have used a cutter to achieve that effect as its a very specific area, essentially just the top half of the cowboy thats drenched ins shadow. Theres also this curious black circular shadow which exists at the very top of the door near the cowboys head which permanently stays extremely dark, much darker than the rest of the shadows in the frame.

A command can be broken down into many different actions. Actions are uppercase and are individual steps that serve as the building blocks for a command. For commands, 'left' and 'right' are used to denote the direction of an action. The word 'opposite' turns the agent backward in the specified direction. The word 'around' makes the agent execute an action while turning around in the specified direction. The word 'and' means to execute the next scope of the command following the previous scope of the command. The word 'after' signifies to execute the previous scope of the command following the next scope of the command. The words 'twice' and 'thrice' trigger repetition of a command that they scope over two times or three times, respectively. There are only six actions: 'I_LOOK', 'I_WALK', 'I_RUN', 'I_JUMP', 'I_TURN_LEFT', and 'I_TURN_RIGHT'.

An ambulance from Smith's Grove, IL makes its way along the road in a thunderstorm toward the Ridgemont Federal Sanitarium, where Michael, who has been in a coma since then, has been incarcerated. After the apprehensive transfer crew is seen off by medical chief of staff Dr. Hoffman, the ambulance makes its way up the driveway in the storm and back out onto the highway toward Smith's Grove. While in the ambulance, he hears that eight-year-old Jamie Lloyd, his niece and the daughter of Laurie Strode, his first target, is residing in Haddonfield. He immediately grabs and repeatedly bashes a hospital attendant's head against the wall of the ambulance and stabs his finger right into his skull. The other attendant, trapped by the ambulance's locked doors, can only watch helplessly. Soon after, the film introduces Jamie, who has been adopted by the Carruthers family and is still mourning the loss of her mother. Laurie supposedly died in a car accident eleven months earlier. Her older foster sister Rachel comes into her room and consoles her, telling her that she will love her just as much as her mother did. Rachel sends Jamie off to bed and exits the room. Jamie kneels down next to the bed and says her prayers when suddenly, lightning and thunder crash outside, startling her. The door creaks open and as Jamie gets up to close it, the reflection of Michael, donned in his classic white mask and black coveralls, appears in the mirror. Jamie returns to her bed and instantly, Michael's hand reaches out from under the bed and grabs her by the leg. Jamie struggles, gets loose, and runs to her closet. Opening the door, a second Michael appears in front of her, raising his knife. Jamie screams again, attracting the attention of her foster mother, Darlene, who rushes into the room.

Context: Sigmoid colon volvulus, also known as sigmoid volvulus, is a common cause of bowel obstruction and constipation. It is common in Asia, India (7% of intestinal obstruction) and especially South India because of the high fibre diet. It is very common cause of large bowel obstruction in Peru and Bolivia due to high altitude. Hypothesis: Sigmoid colon volvulus is a cause of constipation. pick from the following. +Yes. +It's impossible to say. +No.","output":"+Yes. The context provided does support the hypothesis that Sigmoid colon volvulus is a cause of constipation. The context states that Sigmoid colon volvulus is a common cause of bowel obstruction and constipation. This intestinal condition involves a twist in the bowel, particularly the sigmoid colon, causing a blockage. When this happens, it prevents the normal passage of digested food and waste, which would characterize as constipation or bowel obstruction. The context further establishes that this condition is prevalent in regions like Asia, particularly India, and South America, notably Peru and Bolivia. The high occurrence rate in these locations is attributed to specific local factors such as dietary habits and environmental conditions. In South India, the high fiber diet shared among the population is a possible implication for the commonality of sigmoid colon volvulus since the excessive consumption of fiber can lead to gastrointestinal issues not limited to constipation. Similarly, high altitude regions like Peru and Bolivia see high instances of this condition, which contribute to large bowel obstruction within such populations. However, it is crucial to indicate that while sigmoid colon volvulus can indeed cause constipation, it is not the sole cause. Many other factors can lead to constipation, such as a less active lifestyle, certain medications, a lack of adequate hydration, and more. Therefore, somebody suffering from constipation does not automatically indicate the presence of sigmoid colon volvulus. It is one of the severe categorizations of constipation causes leading to a medical emergency if not remedied in time. Diagnosis and intervention by a healthcare professional would be necessary to ascertain the cause and appropriate treatment for constipation.

Background: Andrea Jane Corr MBE (born 17 May 1974) is an Irish musician, songwriter, and actress. Corr debuted in 1990 as the lead singer of the Celtic folk rock and pop rock group The Corrs along with her three elder siblings Caroline, Sharon, and Jim. Aside from singing lead vocals Corr plays the tin whistle, the ukulele, and the piano. Context: While her siblings were on hiatus to raise their families, Andrea launched a solo career. She released her first album, Ten Feet High, on 25 June 2007. It was produced by Nellee Hooper, who has worked with Gwen Stefani and Madonna; Bono was an executive producer. Her first single, \\"Shame on You\\" was an up-tempo pop song about men and women going to war and leaving behind partners they may never see again. It received positive reviews from music critics; IndieLondon described the song as a \\"slick package\\" that was \\"polished, well produced and with a message that's difficult to ignore\\". Losing Today's David Adair gave the song a strong review, writing that Corr's vocals were \\"crisp and uplifting\\". Liverpool's Daily Post gave the song a three-star rating, commenting that it was \\"deceptively upbeat\\", which masked its \\"heavier message about conscription and war\\".  On 10 April 2009 Andrea announced on Claudia Winkleman's BBC Radio 2 show that she would be releasing a second album of old songs and covers. She spoke of her disappointment and how 'gutted' she had been when her 2007 album Ten Feet High had failed to gain commercial success. She also spoke at length of her experiences while acting in the play Dancing at Lughnasa and how it has given her hope for upcoming projects, including a second solo album of 'old songs'.

I am verifying the answers generated by an automatic system to the following question: when did charles dickens live Suggested answer: His novels, most published in monthly or weekly instalments, pioneered the serial publication of narrative fiction, which became the dominant Victorian mode for novel publication. Should I validate this answer? Answer:","output":"While the suggested answer provides some valuable information about Charles Dickens and the novel publication methods during the Victorian era, it does not directly answer the specific question you posed, which is regarding the time period in which Charles Dickens lived. Therefore, I would recommend not validating this particular answer, as it does not accurately address the inquiry. To provide a more appropriate response to the question \\"when did Charles Dickens live?\\": Charles Dickens was an English writer and social critic who lived from February 7, 1812, to June 9, 1870. Known as one of the most important authors of the Victorian era, Dickens wrote numerous well-regarded novels, including \\"A Tale of Two Cities,\\" \\"Great Expectations,\\" and \\"A Christmas Carol.\\" His works often explored themes of social injustice and the struggles faced by the poor. As the given answer mentioned, Dickens' novels were primarily published in serialized formats, which were released as either monthly or weekly installments. This method of publishing allowed literature to reach a wider audience, making it more accessible and affordable for the lower and middle classes. Serialization also contributed to the popularity and anticipation of new installments, which generated further interest in current events and social issues of the time. In conclusion, while the original suggested answer is relevant to Charles Dickens and his influence on novel publication during the Victorian era, it does not directly answer the question about when he lived. To better guide future responses, it would be helpful to focus on providing accurate and relevant information that addresses the specific question being asked."},{"instruction":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

There, Lincoln befriends a young African American boy, William Johnson (Anthony Mackie), and intervenes when he sees Johnson being beaten by a slaver. Because of his son's actions, Thomas is fired. That night, Lincoln sees Barts break into his house and attack Nancy. She falls ill the following day, and dies shortly afterwards. Thomas tells Lincoln that Barts poisoned Nancy.Nine years later, Lincoln decides to get revenge against Barts. He attacks Barts at the docks, but Barts, who is actually a vampire, overpowers him. However, before Barts can kill him, Lincoln is rescued by Henry Sturgess (Dominic Cooper). Sturgess explains that vampires exist, and offers to teach Lincoln to be a vampire hunter. Lincoln accepts and, after a decade of training, travels to Springfield, Illinois. During his training, Sturgess tells Lincoln that the vampires in America descend from Adam (Rufus Sewell), a vampire who owns a plantation in New Orleans with his sister, Vadoma (Erin Wasson). Sturgess also tells Lincoln of the vampires' weakness, silver, and presents him with a silver pocket watch.In Springfield, Lincoln befriends shopkeeper Joshua Speed (Jimmi Simpson), and meets Mary Todd (Mary Elizabeth Winstead).

Before dying, Barts reveals that Sturgess is also a vampire. Lincoln confronts Sturgess, who reveals that, several years ago, he was attacked and bitten by Adam.

Here is an article: James Blake lost his cool and cursed ESPN analyst Pam Shriver while losing his first-round match in straight sets to Robin Haase at Wimbledon today. It was a low point for the world's former No. 4, who has sunk to 109, but it also was an embarrassing and unprofessional moment for Shriver. The commentary from Shriver, a veteran of numerous grand slam tournaments as a player, could be heard on court. Blake pointed that out in mid-match, just after she had criticized his game. \\"Amazing you used to play tennis,\\" Blake yelled up. \\"I can still hear you.\\" Shriver didn't lower her volume, and went on to say, \\"James just yelled at me . . . I'm way above the court, but evidently he can hear me. He's got rabbit ears.\\" Well, yeah. It's Wimbledon, and the slightest bit of yammering draws a request for silence from the chair umpire. That part of the game hasn't changed since Shriver won her 21 grand slam doubles titles with Martina Navratilova, from 1981-91. After the next point, Blake yelled, \\"You have to be an ass about it, too? . . . And act like I'm at fault.\\" Shriver again failed to retreat, saying, \\"And there he is, talking again.

Answer the following question: Here's a complex question that requires someone to reason about the input, can you answer it? Have both St Albans Cathedral and All Saints' Church, Newcastle upon Tyne served multiple purposes in the past? Answer:","output":"To answer this question, I will have to research individually about St Albans Cathedral and All Saints' Church, Newcastle upon Tyne. This includes finding out about their historical significance, their functional changes over the centuries, and their present status.  1. Starting with St Albans Cathedral: St Albans Cathedral, also known as the Cathedral and Abbey Church of St Alban, is a Church of England cathedral church at St Albans, England. It was originally an abbey church that became a cathedral in 1877, and it's one of the oldest churches in England. Early records suggest that it was used for religious purposes, as a place of worship and pilgrimage. But during the Dissolution of the Monasteries, monastic institutions were closed, and its lands and properties were taken by the Crown. The abbey church became part of the new diocese of St Albans in 1877 and was then used also as a cathedral, marking a dual-purpose in its history.  2. Moving to All Saints' Church, Newcastle upon Tyne: All Saints' Church is a Church of England parish church in the city of Newcastle upon Tyne. It's one of the city's most iconic landmarks. Historically, it served as a place of worship. However, due to a dwindling congregation, the church was declared redundant in 1961. It was then passed to the care of the Churches Conservation Trust and has been used not only as a place for regular worship but also for concerts, exhibitions, and private events, indicating that this church, too, has served multiple purposes. In conclusion: Yes, both St Albans Cathedral and All Saints' Church, Newcastle upon Tyne, have indeed served multiple purposes in the past. They have functioned as places of worship and at different times have adopted new purposes like serving as a cathedral and a venue for events. Their purposes have evolved in response to the changing cultural, religious, and social contexts they exist within."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant. User will you give you a task.

Question: Information:  - Field artillery is a category of mobile artillery used to support armies in the field. These weapons are specialized for mobility, tactical proficiency, long range, short range and extremely long range target engagement.  - Infantry is the general branch of an army that engages in military combat on foot. As the troops who engage with the enemy in close-ranged combat, infantry units bear the largest brunt of warfare and typically suffer the greatest number of casualties during a military campaign. Historically, as the oldest branch of the combat arms, the infantry are the tip of the spear of a modern army, and continually undergo training that is typically more physically demanding and psychologically stressful than that of any other branch of the combat arms. Common representations of infantry fighting forces include the U.S. Army Infantry Branch, U.S. Marine Corps Infantry, Royal Canadian Infantry Corps, Infantry of the British Army, and the Royal Australian Corps of Infantry.  - Artillery is a class of large military weapons built to fire munitions far beyond the range and power of infantry's small arms. Early artillery development focused on the ability to breach fortifications, and led to heavy, fairly immobile siege engines. As technology improved, lighter, more mobile field artillery developed for battlefield use. This development continues today; modern self-propelled artillery vehicles are highly mobile weapons of great versatility providing the largest share of an army's total firepower.  - Fortifications are military constructions or buildings designed for the defense of territories in warfare, and also used to solidify rule in a region during peace time. Humans have constructed defensive works for many thousands of years, in a variety of increasingly complex designs. The term is derived from the Latin \\"fortis\\" (\\"strong\\") and \\"facere\\" (\\"to make\\").  - A siege is a military blockade of a city or fortress with the intent of conquering by attrition or assault. This derives from \\"sedere\\", Latin for \\"to sit\\". Siege warfare is a form of constant, low-intensity conflict characterized by one party holding a strong, static defensive position. Consequently, an opportunity for negotiation between combatants is not uncommon, as proximity and fluctuating advantage can encourage diplomacy.  - A tractor unit (prime mover or traction unit) is a characteristically heavy-duty towing engine that provides motive power for hauling a towed or trailered load. These fall into two categories: very heavy-duty typically off-road capable, often 6×6, military and commercial tractor units, including ballast tractors, and heavy and medium duty military and commercial rear-wheel drive \\"semi tractors\\" used for hauling semi-trailers.  - A ballast tractor is a specially weighted tractor unit of a heavy hauler combination. It is designed to utilize a drawbar to pull or push heavy or exceptionally large trailored loads. When feasible, lowboy-style semi-trailers are used to minimize a load's center of gravity. Typical drivetrains are 6×4 and 6×6.  - In international arms control, small arms include revolvers and pistols, rifles and carbines, assault rifles, submachine guns and light machine guns. Together with light weapons (heavy machine guns; hand-held grenade launchers; portable anti-aircraft and anti-tank guns; recoilless rifles; portable launchers of anti-aircraft and anti-tank missile systems; and mortars of calibres of less than 100 mm), they comprise the Small Arms and Light Weapons (SALW) protocol.  - A half-track is a civilian or military vehicle with regular wheels at the front for steering and continuous tracks at the back to propel the vehicle and carry most of the load. The purpose of this combination is to produce a vehicle with the cross-country capabilities of a tank and the handling of a wheeled vehicle.  - Self-propelled artillery (also called mobile artillery or locomotive artillery) is artillery equipped with its own propulsion system to move towards its target. Within the term are covered self-propelled guns (or howitzers) and rocket artillery. They are high mobility vehicles, usually based on continuous tracks carrying either a large howitzer, field gun, a mortar or some form of rocket or missile launcher. They are usually used for long-range indirect bombardment support on the battlefield.  - A semi-trailer (British English) or semitrailer (American English) is a trailer without a front axle. In the US, the term is also used to refer to the combination of a truck and a semi-trailer, a tractor-trailer.  - An artillery tractor , also referred to as a gun tractor , is a specialized heavy - duty form of tractor unit used to tow artillery pieces of varying weights and calibres . It may be wheeled , tracked , or half - tracked .  - A siege engine is a device that is designed to break or circumvent city walls and other fortifications in siege warfare. Some have been operated close to the fortifications, while others have been used to attack from a distance. From antiquity, siege engines were constructed largely of wood and tended to use mechanical advantage to fling stones and similar missiles. With the development of gunpowder and improved metallurgical techniques, siege engines became artillery. Collectively, siege engines or artillery together with the necessary troops and transport vehicles to conduct a siege are referred to as a siege-train.    What object entity has the relation of 'subclass of' with the subject 'artillery tractor'?   Choices: - ability  - arms control  - army  - artillery  - blockade  - branch  - city  - class  - combat  - device  - diplomacy  - field  - fortress  - gravity  - grenade  - gun  - infantry  - latin  - light  - locomotive  - machine  - military  - military vehicle  - missile  - mortar  - number  - own  - party  - position  - power  - protocol  - range  - road  - rocket  - siege engine  - style  - support  - system  - time  - tractor  - trailer  - truck  - warfare Answer:","output":"military vehicle"},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Lewis Hamilton will start the first ever Russian Grand Prix in pole position after coming out on top in Saturday's tense qualifying session. The Mercedes driver has been on dazzling form in recent weeks, winning consecutive races in Italy, Singapore and Japan to climb atop the overall driver's standings, and his hot streak continued in the Black Sea resort town of Sochi. Hamilton clocked a fastest lap of one minute, 38.338 seconds but was made to sweat by the Williams of Valtteri Bottas who looked set to trump that time only to skid off at the very end of the third qualifying run. The slip ensured the Finn finished third fastest behind Hamilton's teammate and title rival Nico Rosberg. McLaren's Jenson Button will begin the race from fourth position ahead of the Toro Rosso of home favourite Daniil Kvyat who edged out Kevin Magnusson of McLaren and Daniel Ricciardo of Red Bull. \\"Pole is a great place to start,\\" Hamilton told the waiting press after coming off the track. \\"It wasn't the easiest of sessions. Rosberg and Bottas were looking quite strong and hooking up a good lap wasn't the same as practice. It will be tough tomorrow in the race. It is a long way down to turn one. We'll see how that works out.\\" Elsewhere on the track, Fernando Alonso clocked the eighth fastest time just ahead of Ferrari teammate Kimi Raikkonen. Four-time world Champion Sebastian Vettel, meanwhile, will start in eleventh position after failing to make the final qualifying run. \\"I wasn't comfortable in the car today. It was very difficult,\\" Vettel said. \\"The car felt nervous, so I couldn't take the speed into the corners, I lost the rear many times around the lap and therefore wasn't quick enough.\\" The day's qualifying took place under calm, sunny conditions that were in stark contrast to the heavy rain a week earlier in Japan that led to Marussia driver Jules Bianchi suffering a severe head injury. The 25-year-old Frenchman remains in hospital in Yokkaichi and a number of drivers spoke earlier this week about the difficulty of competing again so soon after such a traumatic incident. Hamilton said he was praying for the Frenchman while all 21 drivers have put the words \\"Tous avec Jules #17\\" on their helmets this weekend to show their support. Bianchi's Marussia teammate, Max Chilton, took to the track Saturday but finished the day in 21st position and will start last on the grid Sunday. He later described the emotions he and his team felt and the difficulties of trying to focus on racing under the circumstances. \\"(It's been) a tough weekend and one that hasn't got any easier as we've progressed towards the race,\\" Chilton said. \\"I'm grateful for having the whole Team around me as I think that it is helping all of us to focus. \\"Performance-wise, we didn't get the qualifying position we wanted today, but there are some reasons for that. \\"We'll keep pushing hard this evening, and do our best to get ahead of the Caterhams tomorrow, but the fact is, it's not the same without my teammate.\\" Here is a summary of the highlights for this article:","output":"Lewis Hamilton secured pole position for the first ever Russian Grand Prix in Sochi after a tense qualifying session.

Question:   Don is getting screened for cancer. Because his cancer is caught early, at the first screening, the chance of a cure is greater or lesser?    Text:  The sooner cancer is treated, the greater the chances of a cure. Answer:","output":"Based on the provided text, it can be inferred that the sooner cancer is detected and treated, the greater the chances are of a successful cure. In Don's case, his cancer is caught at the first screening, which means it is likely detected early in its development. This early detection allows for more effective treatment options and an increased likelihood of successfully eliminating the cancer from his body. Since the text emphasizes the importance of early treatment in increasing the chances of a cure, it can be concluded that Don's greater chance of a cure is directly related to the cancer being caught early at the first screening. Early detection plays a critical role in ensuring better treatment outcomes and improving a patient's overall prognosis.

Q: In 1974, at the Glensville Sanatorium in West Virginia, three deformed patients known as the Hillicker Brothers escape from their cells and release the other patients; together they massacre the orderlies and the doctors.Twenty-nine years later in 2003, nine Weston University students: Kenia (Jennifer Pudavick), Jenna (Terra Vnesa), Vincent (Sean Skene), Sara (Tenika Davis), Bridget (Kaitlyn Leeb), Kyle (Victor Zinck, Jr.), Claire (Samantha Kendrick), Daniel (Dean Armstrong) and Lauren (Ali Tataryn), are snowmobiling, on their way to their friend Porter's cabin in the mountains. However, they get lost in a snowstorm and are forced to take shelter in the Glensville Sanatorium for the night, where the Hillickers are living. Lauren remembers her brother's stories about the sanatorium and the cannibalistic Hillickers, but her friends don't believe her. As the group goes to bed, Vincent continues to explore the asylum, where he finds Porter's corpse before being killed by Saw Tooth.The next day, with the storm still in full effect, the teens remain trapped and go in search of Vincent. Jenna comes across the Hillickers butchering Porter's body in the kitchen, and runs back to warn the others. After Porter's severed head is thrown at the group, Claire is hung from a balcony with barbed wire by the trio and decapitated. The group attempts to flee the building, but find their snowmobiles have been sabotaged. Lauren skis down the mountain to seek help, while the others barricade themselves in a doctor's office.Kyle, Daniel, and Sara go into the basement to get weapons but Daniel gets abducted, tied to a table in the kitchen, and then slowly eaten alive. The rest of the group chases the cannibals and locks them in a cell; Kyle stays behind to watch them while the others search for spark-plugs for the snowmobiles. When Kyle falls asleep, the brothers escape their cell and the girls accidentally stab Kyle to death after he has his tongue cut out and is dressed up like one of the Hillickers. The cannibals appear and chase the girls through the building, forcing them to climb out of a window; Jenna gets stuck and is impaled with a ground driller by Saw Tooth. The Hillickers chase the girls on the snowmobiles, where Kenia gets injured and Bridget gets crushed under one of them by One Eye.As the day dawns, Lauren has frozen to death in the storm. Kenia is still being chased by One Eye when Sara reappears and knocks him off the snowmobile, allowing the pair to steal it. As they gleefully drive away, they are simultaneously decapitated by a strip of barbed wire. Three Finger picks up their heads and puts them in a yellow tow truck from the first film, before moving away with his brothers from the sanatorium. A:","output":"1.

Question: \\"Who visited St Helena more recently, King George VI or the Princess Royal?\\"  Context: \\"One commentator has observed that, notwithstanding the high unemployment resulting from the loss of full passports during 1981–2002, the level of loyalty to the British monarchy by the St Helena population is probably not exceeded in any other part of the world. King George VI is the only reigning monarch to have visited the island. This was in 1947 when the King, accompanied by Queen Elizabeth (later the Queen Mother), Princess Elizabeth (later Queen Elizabeth II) and Princess Margaret were travelling to South Africa. Prince Philip arrived at St Helena in 1957 and then his son Prince Andrew visited as a member of the armed forces in 1984 and his sister the Princess Royal arrived in 2002.\\"  Answer: The answer to this question is:","output":"The Princess Royal visited St Helena more recently than King George VI. Based on the context provided, King George VI visited the island in 1947 during a trip to South Africa, along with Queen Elizabeth, Princess Elizabeth, and Princess Margaret. In contrast, the Princess Royal, who is Prince Andrew's sister, visited St Helena in 2002.

Plot title: Clockstoppers Movie plot: The NSA-funded QT (Quantum Tech) Corporation has slated a project to develop Hypertime, a technology which allows the user's molecules to speed up to the point where the world appears to be standing still. After realizing that such technology, contained within a wristwatch frame, could also be used against the USA, the NSA orders the project stopped. However, the research is farther along than the NSA expected and Henry Gates, the head of QT, plans on using the technology to usurp the leader of the NSA and dominate the world. He uses the prototype to stretch the weekend in order to give the brilliant lead scientist, Earl Dopler, time to fix the remaining glitch in the technology after his henchmen Richard and Jay prevent Earl's incognito departure at the airport. However, the disadvantage of Earl being in Hypertime for too long was him aging rapidly in real time, as his molecular age continued at the same rate despite time slowing down.However, initially unknown to Gates, the lead scientist had sent a prototype to a former colleague of his named Dr. Gibbs. His son Zak discovers the watch accidentally and initially uses it for his own purpose, much to Francesca's amusement. Once Gates finds out about the leaked prototype, he attempts to retrieve it. He sends his henchmen after Zak, who break into his house and search for evidence. Upon learning about the ulterior motive of QT Corporation, Zak sets out to warn his father of the danger he could be in.A chase sequence ensues, with Zak crashing the car into the river and thus damaging the watch. He awakes in hospital with a broken watch, and only by a stroke of luck manages to avoid Jay and Richard again.

Background: Duke was born in New York City, the only child of tobacco and hydroelectric power tycoon James Buchanan Duke and his second wife, Nanaline Holt Inman, widow of Dr. William Patterson Inman. At his death in 1925, the elder Duke's will bequeathed the majority of his estate to his wife and daughter, along with 17 million in two separate clauses of the will, to The Duke Endowment he had created in 1924. The total value of the estate was not disclosed, but was estimated variously at 60 million to 100 million (equivalent to 837 million to 1.395 billion in 2018), the majority culled from J.B. Duke's holds in Lucky Strike cigarettes. Duke spent her early childhood at Duke Farms, her father's 2,700-acre (11 km2) estate in Hillsborough Township, New Jersey. Context: Duke's first major philanthropic act was to establish Independent Aid, Inc., in 1934, when she was 21 years old, in order to manage the many requests for financial assistance addressed to her. In 1958, she established the Duke Gardens Foundation to endow the public display gardens she started to create at Duke Farms. Her Foundation intended that Duke Gardens \\"reveal the interests and philanthropic aspirations of the Duke family, as well as an appreciation for other cultures and a yearning for global understanding.\\". Duke Gardens were the center of a controversy over the decision by the trustees of the Doris Duke Charitable Foundation to close them on May 25, 2008.  In 1968, Duke created the Newport Restoration Foundation with the goal of preserving more than eighty colonial buildings in the town. Historic properties include Rough Point, Samuel Whitehorne House, Prescott Farm, the Buloid-Perry House, the King's Arms Tavern, the Baptist Meetinghouse, and the Cotton House. Seventy-one buildings are rented to tenants. Only five function as museums. She also funded the construction of Maharishi Mahesh Yogi's ashram in India, visited by the Beatles in 1968.  Duke's extensive travels led to an interest in a variety of cultures, and during her lifetime she amassed a considerable collection of Islamic and Southeast Asian art. After her death, numerous pieces were donated to The Asian Art Museum of San Francisco and the Walters Art Museum of Baltimore.  Duke did much additional philanthropic work and was a major benefactor of medical research and child welfare programs. In the late 1980s, Duke donated 2 million to Duke University to be used for AIDS research. Her foundation, Independent Aid, became the Doris Duke Foundation, which still exists as a private grant-making entity. After her death, the Doris Duke Charitable Foundation was established in 1996, supporting four national grant making programs and Doris Duke's three estates, Shangri La, Rough Point, and Duke Farms. Question: What is Philanthropy?. Whats the answer?","output":"Philanthropy is the act of promoting the welfare of others by donating time, money, resources, or expertise to support various causes or initiatives that aim to improve the quality of life for individuals and communities. It involves a genuine concern for the well-being of others and a commitment to creating positive social change. Philanthropists often support organizations, projects, and programs that address a wide range of issues, such as education, healthcare, poverty alleviation, human rights, environmental conservation, arts and culture, and scientific research. The scope of philanthropy can range from local initiatives to global efforts, with the focus on long-term sustainable impact. Doris Duke's long history of philanthropic activities serves as a prime example of how an individual can use their resources and influence to support causes and initiatives that align with their values or interests. From the establishment of Independent Aid, Inc. in 1934, to funding the construction of Maharishi Mahesh Yogi's ashram in India, Duke dedicated her life to using her wealth and influence to create positive change in various communities and disciplines. Duke's philanthropic works included the establishment of the Duke Gardens Foundation, which aimed to support public display gardens and foster global understanding; the creation of the Newport Restoration Foundation, focused on preserving and restoring historical properties; and significant contributions to medical research, child welfare programs, and art collections. Her continued legacy is reflected in the Doris Duke Charitable Foundation, which carries on her philanthropic vision through national grant-making programs and maintaining her preserved estates. In summary, philanthropy involves the selfless dedication to improving the lives of others and supporting causes that promote positive change. It encompasses activities like donating resources, volunteering time, and advocating for social or environmental issues, all with the intent to help make the world a better place for everyone. Doris Duke serves as an inspiring example of what an individual can achieve through a life of committed philanthropy."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant that follows instruction extremely well.

Generate a question about the following movie plot: The story follows the sexual exploits of two Amherst College roommates over a 25-year period, from the late 1940s to the early 1970s. Sandy (Art Garfunkel) is gentle and passive, while Jonathan Fuerst (Jack Nicholson) is tough and aggressive. Sandy idolizes women, Jonathan objectifies women. He frequently uses the term \\"ballbuster\\" to describe women as emasculating teases whose main pleasure as he sees it is to deny pleasure to men. Since each man's perspective of womanhood is extreme and self-serving, neither is able to sustain a relationship with a woman. The film has three parts. Part I occurs when Sandy and Jonathan are college roommates. Part II follows the men several years after college. In the final part, the men have become middle-aged. In the beginning, Sandy and Jonathan are discussing women, and what kind appeals to each. Sandy wants a woman who is intellectual. Jonathan is more interested in a woman's physical attributes. Sandy shyly meets Susan (Candice Bergen) at an on-campus event and they begin dating. Although they enjoy each other's company, Susan is reluctant to enter into a physical relationship. Unknown to Sandy, she meets Jonathan, feeling a physical attraction for him. They have sex. Jonathan convinces Susan not to have sex with Sandy.

Question: suppose human intervention is lowered happens, how will it affect MORE butterflies.  How does the supposed perturbation influence the second effect mentioned. Answer by more, less or no effect The answer to this question is:","output":"more. If human intervention is lowered, it will generally have a positive effect on butterfly populations and lead to more butterflies. The second effect mentioned in the process was the hatching of the egg and the emergence of the larva (caterpillar). The supposed perturbation, in this case, the reduction of human intervention, would likely have a more significant effect on the outcome. There are several reasons why reducing human intervention can lead to more butterflies and influence the hatching process: 1. Habitat preservation: Reducing human intervention often means creating and maintaining more natural habitats for butterflies. These habitats provide essential resources for the insects, such as host plants for laying eggs, places for the larvae to safely hatch, and accessible food sources for caterpillars, which are critical for their growth. 2. Reduction in pesticide use: Lowering human intervention also implies the reduced use of pesticides, which can be harmful to butterflies in various life stages. Pesticides can directly kill eggs, larvae, or adult butterflies. They can also lead to the loss of necessary host plants or negatively impact the availability of food resources for caterpillars. 3. Increased biodiversity: When human intervention decreases, it creates more biodiversity in ecosystems. Greater biodiversity allows for healthier and more resilient ecosystems. Consequently, this encourages larger butterfly populations by providing better foraging opportunities for adult butterflies and better host plants for egg-laying and larval development. 4. Support for natural predators: Reduced human intervention supports the survival of predators that prey on pests, providing a more balanced ecosystem. This balance can help manage pest populations that could be detrimental to butterflies or their host plants. Reducing human intervention ultimately benefits butterfly populations by positively impacting their life cycles, starting from egg-laying to the hatching process and beyond. The preservation of natural habitats, decrease in pesticide use, increased biodiversity, and support for natural predators all contribute to the growth and success of butterfly populations, leading to a more significant effect on the second aspect mentioned, the hatching of the egg and the emergence of the larva."},{"instruction":"You are a teacher.

A teenager, whose name has been withheld to protect the family's privacy, is believed to have fallen off the Arbroath Cliffs on the Angus coastline sometime during the past few days. The incident has prompted a massive search and rescue operation, with the teenager's distressed family members actively participating in the effort alongside local authorities and volunteers. The Arbroath Cliffs, a breathtaking feature carved for millennia by the relentless waters of the North Sea, rise up at an average height of 60 meters (197 feet) above sea level. The popular hiking trails that run along the coastline attract countless visitors every year, awed by the natural beauty and panoramic views of the area. However, the allure of these captivating rock formations can sometimes prove fatal, as their treacherous cliff edges and strong winds pose significant risks to those who dare approach too closely. The cliffs' grim history of past accidents and casualties serve as a somber testament to the danger they present. Upon receiving the alarming news, the teenager's loved ones quickly jumped into action, desperate to find any clues that might shed light on his whereabouts and fate. In a heartrending display of unwavering support and love, family members joined forces with an extensive network of tireless emergency response personnel, search teams from Tayside Police Division, coastguard helicopters, and lifeboats from nearby harbors. Local residents have also been quick to lend a hand, organizing ad-hoc search parties among themselves and using their intimate knowledge of the terrain in hopes of helping to find the missing teen. Over the past few days, these diligent searchers have been combing the Angus coastline, leaving no stone unturned, and scanning the waters with an unwavering determination to find the young man. Despite their tireless efforts, the only sign of the missing teenager uncovered thus far has been some personal belongings discovered near the cliff's edge, a chilling reminder of the tragedy that may have unfolded. The Tayside Police Division has been coordinating the search and rescue efforts, using all resources at their disposal, including maritime search and rescue units, police dog teams, and specialist search officers. They are also making a concerted effort to piece together the teenager's movements in the days leading up to his disappearance and are urging anyone in the community who might have information to come forward. The disappearance of the teenager has cast a shadow over the usually tranquil and idyllic surroundings of Arbroath, as concerned residents and visitors alike thicken in support of the family and their search efforts. As more information surfaces, the community remains united in the hope that the missing teenager will be found safe and sound. We implore anyone with information regarding the incident to contact Tayside Police Division on 101, or anonymously through Crimestoppers by calling 0800 555 111. With the help of our tight-knit communities, it is our collective hope that the anguished family will be reunited with their missing loved one as soon as possible."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Betty accused Jennifer of being a flirt because she was always touching men's arms.","output":"Step 1: Identify the main characters and context of the story. The primary characters in the story are Betty and Jennifer. The context involves Betty accusing Jennifer of being a flirt. The basis for this accusation is that Jennifer frequently touches men's arms. Step 2: Build upon the established context and characterizations.  All right, let's continue with the story. Jennifer, in her usual calm demeanor, remained unfazed by Betty's accusation. \\"There's a difference between being friendly and being flirtatious, Betty,\\" Jennifer said nonchalantly while flipping her glossy hair with an air of indifference. She didn't feel the need to alter her behavior. After all, it was her nature to indulge in a tactile form of communication. How was she to blame if Betty misconstrued it as flirting? Step 3: Introduce counter-argument or conflict. Betty, oblivious to Jennifer's logic, growled in response. As far as she was concerned, there was no need for such physical contact. Nevertheless, Jennifer's actions had sparked a bitter rivalry between the pair. Their once blossoming friendship started withering, and a tension-filled cloud began to fill their shared spaces. They found their conversations constantly riddled with sarcasm and undertones of anger. Step 4: Progress the story.  Over time, Jennifer eventually became aware of the depth of Betty's disdain. She made an effort to be mindful of her actions, especially when they were together. Yet, she could not fully suppress her habitual way of connecting with people. This sparked further frustration between Jennifer and Betty, with the former feeling constrained and the latter feeling disrespected. Step 5: Build a climactic situation. One day, during a social gathering, they found themselves in a heated confrontation, drawing the attention of those around them. Jennifer, tired of the constant nagging, finally challenged Betty. \\"If you think it's such a problem, then why don't you prove it? Prove that I am crossing a line!\\" Step 6: Ensure there is a cliffhanger or unresolved conflict for future development. Betty was left stunned, unable to respond immediately to Jennifer's challenge. The crowd around them fell silent, waiting for Betty's reaction. Would she be able to substantiate her claims against Jennifer, or will this confrontation serve as a testament to Jennifer's innocence? With each of these steps, the story has been elaborated while maintaining consistency with the initial scenario.

Write a text based on this summary: gambling bill fails to clear legislative floor Text:","output":"Title: Legislative Floor Halts Progress of Gambling Bill, Future Remains Uncertain The much-debated gambling bill faced a significant hurdle as it failed to clear the legislative floor recently. The proposal, which was expected to bring significant changes to the gambling landscape, met opposition from various groups and lawmakers, resulting in its setback.  The gambling bill had been gathering attention and support for several months, as it aimed to introduce new regulations and possibilities for the industry. Its potential benefits included increased revenue for the state and an expansion of employment opportunities within the gambling sector. However, not everyone agreed on these positive outcomes. Many lawmakers and community groups expressed concerns about the possible negative effects arising from the potential bill's passage. Some of the key arguments made against it revolved around the fear of increased gambling addiction, negative outcomes for low-income households, and potential growth in crime rates around gambling establishments. As the bill failed to secure the necessary votes on the legislative floor, it will now face an uncertain future. Proponents of the bill will need to strategize and potentially revise parts of the legislation in order to garner more support. Meanwhile, opponents will continue to emphasize their concerns and rally for alternative solutions to address the potential social and economic challenges that the expansion of gambling could bring. In the coming months, the fate of the gambling bill will likely be influenced by further negotiations, public opinion, and potential shifts in the political landscape. For now, the state's gambling industry will remain unchanged as lawmakers and stakeholders continue to grapple with the right approach to balance potential economic benefits with social concerns. In conclusion, the gambling bill's failure to clear the legislative floor signals the ongoing struggle to determine the future of gambling in the region. While its proponents argue its potential benefits, opponents maintain valid concerns regarding the negative impacts it could have on society. Its ultimate success or failure depends on addressing these challenges while navigating the ever-changing political landscape."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Solve this instance: TIP48 and TIP49 are two related and highly conserved eukaryotic AAA(+) proteins with an essential biological function and a critical role in major pathways that are closely linked to cancer. They are found together as components of several highly conserved chromatin-modifying complexes. Both proteins show sequence homology to bacterial RuvB but the nature and mechanism of their biochemical role remain unknown. Recombinant human TIP48 and TIP49 were assembled into a stable high molecular mass equimolar complex and tested for activity in vitro. TIP48/TIP49 complex formation resulted in synergistic increase in ATPase activity but ATP hydrolysis was not stimulated in the presence of single-stranded, double-stranded or four-way junction DNA and no DNA helicase or branch migration activity could be detected. Complexes with catalytic defects in either TIP48 or TIP49 had no ATPase activity showing that both proteins within the TIP48/TIP49 complex are required for ATP hydrolysis. The structure of the TIP48/TIP49 complex was examined by negative stain electron microscopy. Three-dimensional reconstruction at 20 A resolution revealed that the TIP48/TIP49 complex consisted of two stacked hexameric rings with C6 symmetry. The top and bottom rings showed substantial structural differences. Interestingly, TIP48 formed oligomers in the presence of adenine nucleotides, whilst TIP49 did not. The results point to biochemical differences between TIP48 and TIP49, which may explain the structural differences between the two hexameric rings and could be significant for specialised functions that the proteins perform individually.

Commissioned by the Hampshire Cultural Trust, it was unveiled at a ceremony attended by civic figures as well as Austen fans in Regency costume. Jane Austen spent the first 25 years of her life in nearby Steventon where her father was vicar. Sculptor Adam Roud said it represented Austen as a \\"daughter and a sister\\" as she walked through the town. \\"We have all the hoo-ha about Jane Austen the author - and rightly so -  but she's a real person and that made me a bit more connected to the idea of her just walking here,\\" he said. The Austen family lived in Steventon until they moved to Bath in 1801. Austen knew Basingstoke well and attended social gatherings at the Assembly Rooms in Market Square and regularly visited family friends at The Vyne, Oakley Hall and Ashe House. Her experiences are thought to have provided her with material for her novels. She wrote drafts for Northanger Abbey, Sense and Sensibility and Pride and Prejudice while in Steventon. What Austen actually looked like has been a source of debate among academics. The only confirmed portrait of the author made during her lifetime is by her sister Cassandra.

Answer the above question based on the context below:  English-Tamil musician M.I.A. (Mathangi \\"Maya\\" Arulpragasam) released her second album Kala in 2007, which achieved widespread critical acclaim, and was certified gold in the United States and silver in the United Kingdom. Six months after giving birth to her son Ikyhd in February 2009, she began composing and recording her third studio album in a home studio section of the Los Angeles house she had bought with her partner Ben Bronfman. She used instruments such as the portable dynamic-phrase synthesizer Korg Kaossilator to compose. She took the beat machine and began recording atop Mayan pyramids in Mexico. Much of the work on the album was undertaken at her house in Los Angeles, in what she called a \\"commune environment\\", before it was completed in a rented studio in Hawaii. She collaborated with writer-producer Blaqstarr because, in her opinion, \\"he simply makes good music\\". M.I.A.'s collaboration with Derek E. Miller of Sleigh Bells on the track \\"Meds and Feds\\" prompted her subsequent signing of the band to her label N.E.E.T., and according to Miller, this experience gave him the confidence to record the band's debut album Treats.Her creative partnership with the comparatively unknown Rusko grew from a sense of frustration at what she saw as her now more mainstream associates suggesting sub-standard tracks due to their busy schedules. Diplo worked on the track \\"Tell Me Why\\", but at a studio in Santa Monica rather than at the house.

Write a summary based on this article:      The chocolate deficit is about to go way up. (AP Photo/Dan Goodman, File)      There's no easy way to say this: You're eating too much chocolate, all of you. And it's getting so out of hand that the world could be headed towards a potentially disastrous (if you love chocolate) scenario if it doesn't stop.      Those are, roughly speaking, the words of two huge chocolate makers, Mars, Inc. and Barry Callebaut. And there's some data to back them up.      Chocolate deficits, whereby farmers produce less cocoa than the world eats, are becoming the norm. Already, we are in the midst of what could be the longest streak of consecutive chocolate deficits in more than 50 years. It also looks like deficits aren't just carrying over from year-to-year—the industry expects them to grow. Last year, the world ate roughly 70,000 metric tons more cocoa than it produced. By 2020, the two chocolate-makers warn that that number could swell to 1 million metric tons, a more than 14-fold increase; by 2030, they think the deficit could reach 2 million metric tons.      The problem is, for one, a supply issue. Dry weather in West Africa (specifically in the Ivory Coast and Ghana, where more than 70 percent of the world's cocoa is produced) has greatly decreased production in the region. A nasty fungal disease known as frosty pod hasn't helped either. The International Cocoa Organization estimates it has wiped out between 30 percent and 40 percent of global cocoa production. Because of all this, cocoa farming has proven a particularly tough business, and many farmers have shifted to more profitable crops, like corn, as a result.      Then there's the world's insatiable appetite for chocolate. China's growing love for the stuff is of particular concern. The Chinese are buying more and more chocolate each year. Still, they only consume per capita about 5 percent of what the average Western European eats. There's also the rising popularity of dark chocolate, which contains a good deal more cocoa by volume than traditional chocolate bars (the average chocolate bar contains about 10 percent, while dark chocolate often contains upwards of 70 percent).      For these reasons, cocoa prices have climbed by more than 60 percent since 2012, when people started eating more chocolate than the world could produce. And chocolate makers have, in turn, been forced to adjust by raising the price of their bars. Hershey's was the first, but others have followed suit.      Efforts to counter the growing imbalance between the amount of chocolate the world wants and the amount farmers can produce has inspired a bit of much needed innovation. Specifically, an agricultural research group in Central Africa is developing trees that can produce up to seven times the amount of beans traditional cocoa trees can. The uptick in efficiency, however, might be compromising taste, says Bloomberg's Mark Schatzker. He likens the trade-off to other mass-produced commodities.      Efforts are under way to make chocolate cheap and abundant -- in the process inadvertently rendering it as tasteless as today’s store-bought tomatoes, yet another food, along with chicken and strawberries, that went from flavorful to forgettable on the road to plenitude.      It's unclear anyone will mind a milder flavor if it keeps prices down. And the industry certainly won't mind, so long as it keeps the potential for a gargantuan shortage at bay. ||||| In the Asia-Pacific region, home to more than half the world’s population and 12 percent of chocolate demand, each person will eat 200 grams (0.4 pounds) in 2014, double the amount of a decade earlier, according to Euromonitor International Ltd.

Read More      In the Asia-Pacific region, home to more than half the world’s population and 12 percent of chocolate demand, each person will eat 200 grams (0.4 pounds) in 2014, double the amount of a decade earlier, according to Euromonitor International Ltd. Close      Global cocoa supplies are headed for the longest production shortfall in more than five decades as chocolate demand surges in Asia.      Cocoa use will top output by about 70,000 metric tons in the 12 months started Oct. 1 and deficits will persist through 2018, a six-year stretch that would be the longest since the data began in 1960, said Laurent Pipitone, head of statistics at the International Cocoa Organization in London. Prices may rally 15 percent to 3,200 a ton by the end of 2014, according to the median of 14 trader estimates in a Bloomberg News survey.      Global sales of chocolate confectionary will gain 2.1 percent to a record 7.3 million tons next year, after a 2 percent gain in 2013, estimates Euromonitor International Ltd. Sales in China more than doubled in the past decade, outpacing gains in Western Europe, the biggest consumer. Tighter supplies will mean higher costs for food makers including Nestle SA, Barry Callebaut AG and Lindt & Spruengli AG.      “Demand for chocolate is great,” said Ashmead Pringle, the president of Atlanta-based GreenHaven Commodity Services, which oversees about 340 million. “A lot of the world population is moving to the middle class and will have more money to spend, in particular in emerging markets and Asia.”      Photographer: Tomohiro Ohsumi/Bloomberg A man uses a smartphone outside a Godiva chocolate shop in the Sanlitun area of Beijing.

Cocoa climbed 24 percent this year to 2,771 a ton on ICE Futures U.S. New York, the second-biggest gain among the 24 commodities tracked by the Standard & Poor’s GSCI gauge, which slid 3.4 percent. The MSCI All-Country World Index of equities gained 16 percent, while the Bloomberg Dollar Index, a gauge against 10 major trading partners, rose 3 percent. The Bloomberg Treasury Bond Index fell 2.8 percent.      Smaller Harvests      Dry weather in Ivory Coast and Ghana, the biggest cocoa growers, drove price gains this year even as most commodities slumped. Commerzbank estimates the production declines in West Africa mean this year’s deficit may exceed 100,000 tons, or 43 percent more than the ICCO forecast. Cocoa beans are processed into butter and powder used to make chocolate.      In the Asia-Pacific region, home to more than half the world’s population and 12 percent of chocolate demand, each person will eat 200 grams (0.4 pounds) in 2014, double the amount of a decade earlier, according to Euromonitor. Sales in China will rise 6.9 percent to a record 193,100 tons this year and expand 6.6 percent further in 2014, the researcher said.      Asian demand is dwarfed by the 2.2 million tons eaten last year in Western Europe, where per-capita consumption was unchanged from 10 years earlier at 4.5 kilograms. Euromonitor predicts sales in the region will rise 0.5 percent this year before expanding 0.6 percent next year.      ‘Untapped Market’      China is a “huge untapped market” that signals more potential for cocoa-supply shortages, said Claudio Oliveira, the head of trading at Castlestone Management LLC in New York.      The world population will expand by 1 billion people over the next 12 years to 8.2 billion, before reaching 9.6 billion by 2050, the United Nations said in a June report. China and India will remain the most-populous nations, and most of the future growth will be in developing countries, the UN said.      Farmers in West Africa, which accounts for about 70 percent of world output, are struggling to boost production as aging trees curb yield potential, said Francesco Gibbi, a project manager at the Common Fund for Commodities, set up by the United Nations.      In Ghana, the largest grower behind Ivory Coast, old trees that yield fewer beans cover about 30 percent of planted areas, and it takes about three years for new ones to be productive, Gibbi said. The government also said in August it will cut the use of subsidized pesticides by half in the season that began Oct. 1, raising the risk of pest damage that the ICCO said damages as much as 40 percent of the global crop annually.      Ample Rains      While drier-than-normal weather may have hurt the crop that’s currently being collected, ample precipitation will boost the next harvest. Ivory Coast growers gather cocoa twice annually, with 70 percent of production supplied by the larger main crop and the rest by the mid-crop.      In November, the country had as much as double the normal rainfall, helping replenish soil moisture, David Streit, an agricultural meteorologist at Commodity Weather Group in Bethesda, Maryland said in a telephone interview. Ghana had as much as 25 percent above normal rains, he said.      Since the start of the season on Oct. 1, bean deliveries to ports in Ivory Coast were estimated to have risen to 711,000 tons as of Dec. 15, from 498,000 tons a year earlier, according to data on the website of KnowledgeCharts, a unit of Commodities Risk Analysis in Bethlehem, Pennsylvania.      “We’re just finishing harvesting the main crop, and that was very good,” Adrien Koffi Kauadio, who farms 4 hectares (9.9 acres) in Gbogue, Ivory Coast, said in a Dec. 11 interview in London. “If the rains come, we could also have a good mid-crop.”      Margins Narrow      Cocoa accounts for about 10 percent of the average price of a chocolate bar, the ICCO estimates. One ton of cocoa makes about 7,250 chocolate bars of 100-grams (3.5 ounces) each, according to Commodity Risk Analysis.      Nestle SA (NESN), the Vevey, Switzerland-based maker of Kit Kat and Crunch bars, said Aug. 8 that profit margins fell in the six months ended June 30 in its confectionery unit amid rising competition and increased spending on marketing in Latin America. Since the end of June, cocoa prices are up 29 percent.      Hershey Co. is betting on rising consumption in Asia, building a 250 million confectionery plant in Malaysia, the region’s biggest cocoa grinder, to help meet its revenue target of 10 billion a year by 2017. Chocolate sales in China are now at about 1.5 billion, Chief Executive Officer John Bilbrey said on an earnings conference call in October.      Consumer Tastes      For Will Papa, the Hershey, Pennsylvania-based company’s head of research and development, meeting that goal will mean tailoring chocolate recipes to consumer taste in China, where the market is dominated by milky candies. Papa employs a team of 12 scientists and product developers in Shanghai to test new products with local residents, he said in an interview.      Sales of chocolate confectionary in the Asia-Pacific region will expand 5 percent annually for Minneapolis-based Cargill Inc., Job Leuning, the head of cocoa in Asia, said Dec. 4 in Jakarta. The company is investing 100 million to open a cocoa-bean processing plant in Indonesia, the third-largest grower. The plant is Cargill’s first in Asia, where demand is growing, and will have a capacity of 70,000 tons, he said.      Hedge funds still expect more price gains. The net-long position almost doubled in the past year to 77,556 futures and option contracts as Dec. 10, U.S. government data show. That’s within about 7 percent of an all-time high reached in November.      Delayed Expansion      Farmer compensation in Ivory Coast hasn’t kept up with the gain in futures as most of the crop was sold in the first half of this year, before prices rallied. The government said Oct. 2 that it will pay farmers 3.4 percent more for their beans in the main harvest of the season started in October. That means farmers probably won’t be able to ramp up production until after next year’s harvest, when they’ll receive higher prices and be able to invest in fertilizers and pesticides. Some are planting other crops, including rubber, farmer Kauadio said.      Stockpiles of cocoa at warehouses monitored by ICE Futures U.S. tumbled 36 percent since this year’s peak in June and are at the lowest since June 2011.      “There’s loads of evidence that the amounts of fertilizer, pesticides and spraying being done in both Ivory Coast and Ghana have fallen,” said Edward George, head of soft-commodities research at Lome, Togo-based lender Ecobank Transnational Inc., which finances the cocoa trade in West Africa. “Cocoa still has a long way to go. If you’ve been watching imports into China of chocolate, cocoa powder, cocoa butter, all that, they are rising exponentially. The trend isn’t changing, it’s just intensifying.”      To contact the reporters on this story: Luzi Ann Javier in New York at ljavier@bloomberg.net; Isis Almeida in London at ialmeida3@bloomberg.net; Marvin G.

It was devised by Fintan Coyle and Cathy Dunning , and developed for television by the BBC Entertainment Department . The first ever episode went on air on 14 August 2000 . It has since been replicated around the world . The UK version was hosted by Anne Robinson and narrated by Jon Briggs . In April 2011 , Robinson announced that she would end her role as the show 's hostess by the time her contract would expire as she had served longer than she originally intended to . The original run ended on Saturday 31 March 2012 with the 1,693rd episode . The BBC continues to air the show internationally on BBC Entertainment .  - Anne Josephine Robinson (born 26 September 1944) is an English television presenter and journalist, known for her acerbic style of presenting. She was one of the presenters on the long-running British series \\"Watchdog\\" from 1993 to 2001 and 2009 to 2015. She gained fame as the hostess of the BBC game show \\"The Weakest Link\\" from 2000 to 2012, which earned her the nickname \\"Queen of Mean\\".  - Magdalen College School is an independent school for boys aged 7 to 18 and girls in the sixth form, located on The Plain in Oxford, England. It was founded as part of Magdalen College, Oxford, by William Waynflete in 1480.  - Channel 4 is a British public-service television broadcaster that began transmission on 2 November 1982. Although largely commercially self-funded, it is ultimately publicly owned; originally a subsidiary of the Independent Broadcasting Authority (IBA), the station is now owned and operated by Channel Four Television Corporation, a public corporation of the Department for Culture, Media & Sport, which was established in 1990 and came into operation in 1993. With the conversion of the Wenvoe transmitter group in Wales to digital on 31 March 2010, Channel 4 became a UK-wide TV channel for the first time.  - A game show is a type of radio, television, or internet programming genre in which contestants, television personalities or celebrities, sometimes as part of a team, play a game which involves answering questions or solving puzzles usually for money and/or prizes. Alternatively, a \\"gameshow\\" can be a demonstrative program about a game (while usually retaining the spirit of an awards ceremony). In the former, contestants may be invited from a pool of public applicants. On some shows, contestants compete against other players or another team, while other shows involve contestants playing alone for a reward or a high score. Game shows often reward players with prizes such as cash, trips and goods and services provided by the show's sponsor prize suppliers, who in turn usually do so for the purposes of product placement. One of the reasons that television broadcasters make game shows is because they are substantially less costly than producing scripted drama shows. Some TV game shows fall under the category of reality television.  - A presenter is a person who introduces or hosts television programs (or segments thereof such as an infomercial advertiser) Nowadays, it is common for minor celebrities in other fields to take on this role, but some people have made their name solely within the field of presenting, particularly within children's television series, to become television personalities.  - BBC Entertainment is an international television channel broadcasting comedy, drama, light entertainment, reality and children's programming (some regions only) from the BBC, Channel 4 and other UK production houses.

He is best known for his voiceover work, particularly as the British voice used by Apple's Siri software. He was educated in Oxford at Dragon School and Magdalen College School, Oxford  - The Dragon School is one school on two sites based in Oxford, England, UK. The Prep School (children aged 8-13) and Dragon Pre-Prep (aged 4-7) are both co-educational schools based in Oxford. The Dragon Prep School founded in 1877 as the Oxford Preparatory School is one of England's best known boarding schools, although it also takes day pupils.   - BBC Prime was the BBC's general entertainment TV channel in Europe and the Middle East from 30 January 1995 until 11 November 2009, when it was replaced by BBC Entertainment.  - Light entertainment is the broad range of usually televisual performances. These include comedies, variety shows, quiz/game shows, sketch shows and people/surprise shows.  - A journalist is a person who collects, writes, or distributes news or other current information. A journalist's work is called journalism. A journalist can work with general issues or specialize in certain issues. However, most journalists tend to specialize, and by cooperating with other journalists, produce journals that span many topics. For example, a sports journalist covers news within the world of sports, but this journalist may be a part of a newspaper that covers many different topics.

His sister ended up accepting some plans for her wedding that I don’t think she was really that fond of, but she went along with them anyways. One of the things that stands out the most to me, was this idea that they would make a large wooden box with a hole in it, and people would smash their dinner plates into the box. Then the fragments of the broken plates would be put into metal keepsake tins for the guests to take home. (The tins were cute, the trash inside seemed very weird to me.) So imagine it’s the evening of your wedding reception, and people are in a corner of the room smashing their plates into a box.

Context: With the onset of the Crusades in 1095, and the expulsions from England (1290), France (1394), and parts of Germany (15th century), Jewish migration pushed eastward into Poland (10th century), Lithuania (10th century), and Russia (12th century). Over this period of several hundred years, some have suggested, Jewish economic activity was focused on trade, business management, and financial services, due to several presumed factors: Christian European prohibitions restricting certain activities by Jews, preventing certain financial activities (such as \\"usurious\\" loans) between Christians, high rates of literacy, near universal male education, and ability of merchants to rely upon and trust family members living in different regions and countries. Answer:","output":"Lithuania was affected by the Crusades through the migration of Jewish people into the region around the 10th century. As a result of the expulsions from England, France, and parts of Germany, Jewish populations moved eastward into Poland, Lithuania, and Russia. In Lithuania, Jewish economic activity primarily focused on trade, business management, and financial services. This was due to several factors such as Christian European prohibitions restricting certain activities by Jews, preventing certain financial activities between Christians, high rates of literacy, near universal male education, and the ability of merchants to rely upon and trust family members living in different regions and countries.

FINAL EXAM  Question 1. The 2013 Denver Broncos were coached by which now-coach of the Chicago Bears? Answer:","output":"The 2013 Denver Broncos were coached by John Fox, who later went on to coach the Chicago Bears from 2015 to 2017. John Fox is a veteran in the field of professional football with nearly 40 years of coaching experience. He kicked off his career in the NFL as an assistant coach with various teams including the San Diego Chargers, Kansas City Chiefs and Oakland Raiders. His first head coaching position came in 2002 with the Carolina Panthers, where he led the team to a Super Bowl appearance in the 2003 season. In his nine seasons with the Panthers, Fox had a record of 73–71 (playoffs included). Following his tenure with the Carolina Panthers, Fox was hired as the head coach of the Denver Broncos in 2011. In the 2013 season, Fox led the Broncos to an impressive record of 13–3, winning the AFC West division, and subsequently advancing to Super Bowl XLVIII. Unfortunately, the Broncos fell to the Seattle Seahawks in the final. After parting ways with the Broncos after the 2014 season, Fox was hired as the head coach of the Chicago Bears in 2015. Despite starting off promisingly, Fox's time with the Bears was marred by a string of poor performances and challenges rebuilding the team, resulting in a final record of 14–34 over the course of his three-season tenure. To this day, Fox is highly regarded as a skilled coach adept at team building. His coaching style, which emphasizes tight, defensive gameplay and opportunistic offense, was a staple of his career and allowed him to leave an indelible mark on those teams he served. Although he is presently retired from coaching since 2018, his legacy in the NFL continues to inspire today's and future coaching staff in the NFL."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Answer the above question based on the context below:  Wilfred Glendon is a wealthy and world-renowned English botanist who journeys to Tibet in search of the elusive mariphasa plant. While there, he is attacked and bitten by a creature later revealed to be a werewolf, although he succeeds in acquiring a specimen of the mariphasa. Once back home in London he is approached by a fellow botanist, Dr. Yogami, who claims to have met him in Tibet while also seeking the mariphasa. Yogami warns Glendon that the bite of a werewolf would cause him to become a werewolf as well, adding that the mariphasa is a temporary antidote for the disease. Glendon does not believe the mysterious Yogami. That is, not until he begins to experience the first pangs of lycanthropy, first when his hand grows fur beneath the rays of his moon lamp (which he is using in an effort to entice the mariphasa to bloom), and later that night during the first full moon. The first time, Glendon is able to use a blossom from the mariphasa to stop his transformation. His wife Lisa is away at her aunt Ettie's party with her friend, former childhood sweetheart Paul Ames, allowing the swiftly transforming Glendon to make his way unhindered to his at-home laboratory, in the hopes of acquiring the mariphasa's flowers to quell his lycanthropy a second time.

A:","output":"No, the given statement does not accurately describe how Frederick tricks Napoleon in \\"Animal Farm.\\" In George Orwell's \\"Animal Farm,\\" Mr. Frederick, who is the owner of a neighboring farm (Pinchfield), tricks Napoleon by purchasing a pile of timber from him. Napoleon becomes increasingly desperate for money to purchase supplies to build a windmill on Animal Farm. To gain these supplies, Napoleon agrees to sell a massive pile of timber to Mr. Frederick, despite being warned by the other pigs that Frederick is untrustworthy. Mr. Frederick pays for the timber with counterfeit money, fooling Napoleon and the animals. Shortly after the transaction, the animals discover that the banknotes are fake, and their supplies are essentially stolen. This act of deceit deeply humiliates Napoleon and puts Animal Farm in a vulnerable position. After acquiring the timber, Mr. Frederick and his men destroy the windmill by blowing it up with explosives. This devastation further exemplifies how Frederick duped Napoleon in order to cause chaos and undermine the animals' efforts to run the farm. Thus, a more suitable answer would be: Mr. Frederick tricks Napoleon in \\"Animal Farm\\" by purchasing timber from him with counterfeit banknotes, ultimately humiliating Napoleon and causing significant damage to the farm's infrastructure."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Nothing about the somnambulant performances or trite script would raise the dead in \\"The House of Seven Corpses,\\" but a groovie ghoulie comes up from his plot (ha!) anyway, to kill the bloody amateurs making a low-rent horror flick in his former abode! In Hell House (sorry, I don't remember the actual name of the residence), a bunch of mysterious, unexplained deaths took place long ago; some, like arthritic Lurch stand-in John Carradine (whose small role provides the film's only worthwhile moments), attribute it to the supernatural; bellowing film director John Ireland dismisses it as superstitious hokum. The result comes across like \\"Satan's School for Girls\\" (catchy title; made-for-TV production values; intriguing plot) crossed with \\"Children Shouldn't Play With Dead Things\\" (low-rent movie about low-rent movie makers who wake the dead); trouble is, it's nowhere near as entertaining or fun. \\"The House of Seven Corpses\\" is dead at frame one, and spends the rest of its 89 minutes going through rigor mortis, dragging us along for every aching second... What is the sentiment of this review?","output":"The sentiment of this review is predominantly negative. The reviewer appears to have watched \\"The House of Seven Corpses\\" with the expectation of an engaging, entertaining horror flick and was sorely disappointed. The reviewer describes the acting performances as 'somnambulant' and labels the script as 'trite', suggesting that they found it uninspiring, dull and lacking originality.  The reference to the film being 'dead at frame one' implies that, in the reviewer's opinion, the film never successfully captivated them or sparked their interest, right from the beginning. The usage of the term 'rigor mortis' is a clever wordplay on the film's genre that underscores the reviewer's perspective on how unenjoyable and tedious they found the film to be.  The reviewer also compares \\"The House of Seven Corpses\\" unfavorably to \\"Satan's School for Girls\\" and \\"Children Shouldn't Play With Dead Things\\". By stating that the film 'comes across like' these two, the reviewer means that while \\"The House of Seven Corpses\\" attempts to utilize similar storylines or themes, it fails to achieve the entertainment value or intrigue that these productions have. The reviewer doesn't solely criticize the film's scripting or performances, they also take issue with the production value, likening it to a 'low-rent horror flick'. This suggests that they found the overall quality of the film poor and lacking in professional polish or finesse. Even the one saving grace of the film, the performance of 'John Carradine', is described as small, suggesting that it's not enough to salvage the overall experience of the movie. Therefore, in conclusion, this reviewer's sentiment is highly negative as they found the movie severely lacking in quality, originality, and entertainment."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Q: Abstract: We have used recombinant or synthetic alphaIIb and beta3 integrin cytoplasmic peptides to study their in vitro complexation and ligand binding capacity by surface plasmon resonance. alpha.beta heterodimerization occurred in a 1:1 stoichiometry with a weak KD in the micromolar range. Divalent cations were not required for this association but stabilized the alpha.beta complex by decreasing the dissociation rate. alpha.beta complexation was impaired by the R995A substitution or the KVGFFKR deletion in alphaIIb but not by the beta3 S752P mutation. Recombinant calcium- and integrin-binding protein (CIB), an alphaIIb-specific ligand, bound to the alphaIIb cytoplasmic peptide in a Ca2+- or Mn2+-independent, one-to-one reaction with a KD value of 12 microM. In contrast, in vitro liquid phase binding of CIB to intact alphaIIbbeta3 occurred preferentially with Mn2+-activated alphaIIbbeta3 conformers, as demonstrated by enhanced coimmunoprecipitation of CIB with PAC-1-captured Mn2+-activated alphaIIbbeta3, suggesting that Mn2+ activation of intact alphaIIbbeta3 induces the exposure of a CIB-binding site, spontaneously exposed by the free alphaIIb peptide. Since CIB did not stimulate PAC-1 binding to inactive alphaIIbbeta3 nor prevented activated alphaIIbbeta3 occupancy by PAC-1, we conclude that CIB does not regulate alphaIIbbeta3 inside-out signaling, but rather is involved in an alphaIIbbeta3 post-receptor occupancy event..

The Apache crews will train at Naval Air Facility El Centro in California, about 90 miles east of San Diego, officials said. The prince, 27, also will be training at the Gila Bend Air Force Auxiliary Field in southern Arizona. It's part of a two-month series of maneuvers dubbed Exercise Crimson Eagle, in which British fliers will practice with the Apaches in terrain similar to southern Afghanistan, where some British troops are currently based.

The disease, also known as German measles, has devastating consequences for unborn children, including blindness, deafness, and heart defects, when pregnant women catch it in the first trimester. In a big US outbreak in 1964 and 1965, 11,000 fetuses died and 20,000 children suffered serious birth defects, the New York Times reports. The last endemic cases reported in the Americas were in Argentina and Brazil in 2009 and health chiefs now say that in a \\"historic achievement,\\" the Americas are the first region in the world that can be declared free of the virus, reports the BBC. \\"Although it has taken some 15 years, the fight against rubella has paid off,\\" the director of the Pan American Health Organization tells the Times. \\"Now, with rubella under our belt, we need to roll up our sleeves and finish the job of eliminating measles as well.\\" She says the eradication shows \\"how important it is to make vaccines available even to the remotest corners of our hemisphere.\\" Health authorities aim to make Europe the next rubella-free region by the end of this year, and hope to make the disease extinct worldwide by 2020, the Huffington Post reports. (Smallpox is the only infectious human disease to have been completely wiped out, but the deadly cattle virus rinderpest was eradicated in 2010.)","output":"Title: Rubella Eradicated: Americas Celebrate Victory Over Devastating Disease Introduction: Rubella, also known as German measles, has been eradicated from the Americas, joining smallpox and polio in a list of diseases that no longer threaten public health in the region. This momentous achievement is a testament to the success of efforts to expand vaccine availability and highlights the importance of continued vaccination campaigns. Background on Rubella and Its Devastating Effects: Rubella poses a significant threat to unborn children when pregnant women contract the virus in the first trimester of pregnancy. The disease can lead to blindness, deafness, heart defects, and even fetal death. Rubella outbreaks have caused considerable suffering throughout history, with one American epidemic in 1964 and 1965 resulting in the death of 11,000 fetuses and 20,000 children being born with severe birth defects. Eradication Efforts in the Americas: The last endemic cases of rubella in the Americas were reported in Argentina and Brazil in 2009. Health officials have declared that in a \\"historic achievement,\\" the Americas are the first region in the world to be free of the virus. The Pan American Health Organization (PAHO) says that this milestone has been reached after 15 years of hard work and emphasizes the importance of making vaccines available even in the most remote areas of the continent. Rubella's eradication in the Americas paves the way for further efforts to eliminate other diseases, starting with measles. Future Eradication Plans: Health authorities hope that Europe will become the next region to be declared rubella-free by the end of this year and aim to make the disease extinct worldwide by 2020. Furthermore, the successful eradication of rubella from the Americas serves as a reminder of the power and importance of vaccination campaigns in addressing other infectious diseases. Smallpox is the only infectious human disease to have been completely eradicated, but the global health community is determined to continue making progress in this area. Conclusion: The eradication of rubella from the Americas serves as a prime example of how concerted public health efforts can achieve extraordinary results. This historic milestone highlights the impact of vaccination campaigns in protecting communities from potentially devastating diseases and sets the stage for continued progress in the global fight against infectious diseases."},{"instruction":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

Article: Tornadoes are nature's most violent storms, which can cause deaths and destroy a neighborhood in seconds. A tornado appears as a funnel-shaped   cloud from a thunderstorm to the ground with whirling   winds that can reach 300 miles per hour. Damage paths can be over one mile wide and 50 miles long. Every state is at some risk from this disaster. Some tornadoes can be seen clearly, while rain or nearby low-hanging clouds _ others. At many times, tornadoes develop so rapidly that little, if any, advance warning is possible. Before a tornado hits, the air may become very still. A cloud of debris   can mark the location of a tornado even if a funnel can not be seen. Tornadoes generally occur near the edge of a thunderstorm, when the strong wind may die down. It is not uncommon to see clear, sunlit skies behind a tornado. The following are facts about tornadoes: The average forward speed of a tornado is 30 MPH, but may also vary from still to 70 MPH. Debris is picked up or a cloud forms in the funnel. The average tornado moves from southwest to northeast, but tornadoes have been known to move in any direction. Tornadoes are most often reported east of the Rocky Mountains during spring and summer months. Tornadoes can happen together with tropical storms and hurricanes as they move onto land. Waterspouts are tornadoes that form over water. The tornado season in the southern states of America is March through May; in the northern states, it is late spring through early summer. Tornadoes are most likely to occur between 3 p.m. and 9 p.m., but can occur at any time. Question: From the passage, where may tornadoes come from? Options: A: Hurricanes. B: Great heat.

It lies in the northern section of the Isthmus of Corinth opposite the island of Salamis, which belonged to Megara in archaic times, before being taken by Athens. Megara was one of the four districts of Attica, embodied in the four mythic sons of King Pandion II, of whom Nisos was the ruler of Megara. Megara was also a trade port, its people using their ships and wealth as a way to gain leverage on armies of neighboring poleis. Megara specialized in the exportation of wool and other animal products including livestock such as horses. It possessed two harbors, Pegae, to the west on the Corinthian Gulf and Nisaea, to the east on the Saronic Gulf of the Aegean Sea.  - Thucydides (\\"Thoukudíds\\", ; c. 460  c. 400 BC) was an Athenian historian and general. His \\"History of the Peloponnesian War\\" recounts the 5th century BC war between Sparta and Athens to the year 411 BC. Thucydides has been dubbed the father of \\"scientific history\\" because of his strict standards of evidence-gathering and analysis of cause and effect without reference to intervention by the gods, as outlined in his introduction to his work.  - Acanthus the Lacedaemonian ( Ancient Greek :  ) , was the victor in two footrace events , the diaulos (  ) and dolichos (  ) , in the Olympic Games of 720 BC. He was also , according to some accounts , the first who ran naked in these games . Other accounts ascribe this to Orsippus the Megarian . Thucydides says that the Lacedaemonians were indeed the first who contended naked in gymnastic games , although he does not mention Acanthus by name .  - Orsippus was a Greek runner from Megara who was famed as the first to run the footrace naked at the Olympic Games and \\"first of all Greeks to be crowned victor naked.\\" Others argue that it was Acanthus instead who first introduced Greek athletic nudity. Orsippus won the stadion-race of the 15th Olympic Games in 720 BC.  - Sparta (Doric Greek: ; Attic Greek: ) was a prominent city-state in ancient Greece. In antiquity the city-state was known as Lacedaemon, while the name Sparta referred to its main settlement on the banks of the Eurotas River in Laconia, in south-eastern Peloponnese. Around 650 BC, it rose to become the dominant military land-power in ancient Greece.  - The History of the Peloponnesian War (Greek: \\"\\") is a historical account of the Peloponnesian War (431404 BC), which was fought between the Peloponnesian League (led by Sparta) and the Delian League (led by Athens). It was written by Thucydides, an Athenian historian who also happened to serve as an Athenian general during the war. His account of the conflict is widely considered to be a classic and regarded as one of the earliest scholarly works of history. The \\"History\\" is divided into eight books.  - A historian is a person who researches, studies, and writes about the past, and is regarded as an authority on it. Historians are concerned with the continuous, methodical narrative and research of past events as relating to the human race; as well as the study of all history in time. If the individual is concerned with events preceding written history, the individual is a historian of prehistory. Although \\"historian\\" can be used to describe amateur and professional historians alike, it is reserved more recently for those who have acquired graduate degrees in the discipline. Some historians, though, are recognized by publications or training and experience. \\"Historian\\" became a professional occupation in the late nineteenth century as research universities were emerging in Germany and elsewhere.  - Athens (\\"Athína\\" ) is the capital and largest city of Greece. Athens dominates the Attica region and is one of the world's oldest cities, with its recorded history spanning over 3,400 years, and its earliest human presence starting somewhere between the 11th and 7th millennia BC. Classical Athens was a powerful city-state that emerged in conjunction with the seagoing development of the port of Piraeus, which had been a distinct city prior to its 5th century BC incorporation with Athens. A centre for the arts, learning and philosophy, home of Plato's Academy and Aristotle's Lyceum, it is widely referred to as the cradle of Western civilization and the birthplace of democracy, largely because of its cultural and political impact on the European continent, and in particular the Romans. In modern times, Athens is a large cosmopolitan metropolis and central to economic, financial, industrial, maritime, political and cultural life in Greece.

Think like you are answering to a five year old. Article: Phentermine's effects tend to plateau over time, and many patients develop a resistance to the drug. This is why it is essential that you get on a stable, sustainable diet and exercise plan, even while taking the drug. A healthy diet and regular exercise can allow you to maintain your weight loss or perhaps even continue to lose weight. Phentermine will help you lose weight in those crucial first few weeks, but only diet and exercise will give you long-term success in your weight-loss journey. A licensed dietitian can help you adjust your diet in a way that is both safe and effective for weight loss. Ideally, your dietitian will also be able to monitor your progress to ensure that you are responding well to your new weight-loss regime. Every patient will require a different plan; however, some common weight-loss strategies include:  Meal replacements (especially for patients who struggle with portion control)  A very-low-calorie diet, often taken in liquid form, under close supervision  Lifestyle modification. This can include rather simple changes such as avoiding processed snack foods, eating lots of low-fat proteins and fresh fruits and veggies, and steering clear of alcohol, simple carbohydrates, and sugars. Make sure that you are sticking to your diet plan by keeping track of the calories you consume. Make a list of all the food you eat throughout the day. Using a simple online tool or phone app, you can calculate your daily calories intake. Confirm that your daily calories fit within the diet plan worked out by your dietitian and physician. A food journal (using an app, a website, or just pen and paper) might also be useful. By recording everything you eat, you can learn to resist temptations more readily. Depending on your current weight and health, there are some exercises that might be safer for you to perform than others. Talk with your doctor about some of the best ways for you to integrate exercise into your life in a healthy way. Ideally your exercise plan will allow you to continue losing weight even after you discontinue your use of phentermine. If you cannot exercise strenuously right away, consider low-impact exercise such as swimming, or even walking. You can always work your way up to more strenuous exercises such as running, jogging, or lifting weights. Behavioral therapy is an integral part of medical weight-loss programs. A behavioral specialist can help you stick to your diet and exercise goals. Perhaps you get tempted to eat because of television commercials, or perhaps you overeat when you are stressed out. A behavioral specialist will use cognitive behavioral therapy to retrain your mind to respond to stress and temptation in healthier, more positive ways. This will help you lose weight while on phentermine as well as after you stop taking the appetite suppressant. What is a summary?","output":"Phentermine is a medicine that helps people lose weight for a short time, but then it stops working. To keep losing weight and stay healthy, it's important to eat a good diet and do exercise. People can see a dietitian, who is someone who knows a lot about food, to help them plan their meals. They should also try different types of exercise and maybe talk to a doctor about what is safe for them. It's a good idea to write down what you eat and how much exercise you do. A behavioral specialist can help you learn new ways to think, so that you don't want to eat too much when you see yummy food on TV or feel upset."},{"instruction":"You should describe the task and explain your answer.

Here is a question about this article: This means that a 5% reduction in operating voltage will more than double the life of the bulb, at the expense of reducing its light output by about 16%. This may be a very acceptable trade off for a light bulb that is in a difficult-to-access location (for example, traffic lights or fixtures hung from high ceilings). Long-life bulbs take advantage of this trade-off. Since the value of the electric power they consume is much more than the value of the lamp, general service lamps emphasize efficiency over long operating life. The objective is to minimize the cost of light, not the cost of lamps. Early bulbs had a life of up to 2500 hours, but in 1924 a cartel agreed to limit life to 1000 hours. When this was exposed in 1953, General Electric and other leading American manufacturers were banned from limiting the life. What is the answer to this question: What is an example of a good application for a long-life bulb?","output":"A good example of a good application for a long-life bulb is in traffic lights or in light fixtures hung from high ceilings.

Solve this math problem Solve 16*w = -14*w + 4*w + 286 for w.","output":"Hey little buddy! Let's try solving this step by step, like a puzzle: 1. First, we have to combine all the pieces with \\"w\\" on one side. We have -14 * w and 4 * w together. If you had -14 apples and someone gave you 4 apples, you would have -10 apples. So it becomes: 16 * w = -10 * w + 286 2. Now, let's move all the \\"w\\" pieces to one side by adding 10 * w to both sides. We want to bring all the \\"w\\" parts together like a family! 16 * w + 10 * w = -10 * w + 10 * w + 286 3. After adding 10 * w to both sides, it cancels the -10 * w on the right side, and on the left side, we have 16 * w plus 10 * w. If you have 16 toys and add 10 more toys, you'll have 26 toys. Now it looks like this: 26 * w = 286 4. The last step is to find out how many times 26 can fit into 286. This is like sharing 286 candies equally with your 26 friends. To find out, we'll divide 286 by 26: w = 286 / 26 5. When we divide 286 by 26, we find out that it fits 11 times! So, w = 11. So the answer to this puzzle is w = 11!

What are some scientifically proven impossible fossils? What are the different types of fossils? Would you say that these questions are the same?","output":"I will first answer your questions individually and then address if they are the same or not. 1. Scientifically proven impossible fossils: To determine if a fossil is impossible, it's important to understand the concept of temporal paradoxes. A temporal paradox occurs when a fossil is found in rock layers that are much older or younger than the time period when the organism is known to have existed. Therefore, a scientifically proven impossible fossil would be a fossil that cannot exist based on the current understanding of geologic time and the fossil record. There aren't many examples of such fossils, as the scientific community constantly updates its understanding of Earth's history and the organisms that inhabited it. However, one of the alleged impossible fossils, termed 'Out-of-place artifacts' (OOPArts), is the \\"Coso artifact.\\" It was initially believed to be a 500,000-year-old spark plug encased in a geode (rock with a hollow cavity lined with crystals). However, further research debunked this claim, revealing that it was just a 1920s-era spark plug mistaken as an impossible fossil. 2. Different types of fossils: Fossils can be categorized into several different types based on the method of preservation: a. Permineralization: Minerals replace the original organic material, creating a cast of the creature. Examples include petrified wood and dinosaur bones. b. Carbonization: The organism's remains are compressed, and only a carbon film remains. This is also called carbon film fossils. c. Molds and casts: A mold forms when an organism is buried in sediment, leaving an impression of its body. A cast is made if minerals fill this mold and create a replica of the original organism. d. Amber: Small organisms, like insects, can get trapped in tree sap. Over time, the sap hardens into an amber, preserving the organism inside. e. Trace fossils: These are not actual remains but rather the impression left behind by the organism's activities (e.g., footprints, burrows, and coprolites). 3. Are these questions the same? No, these questions are not the same. The first question is about specific fossils that are believed to be impossible based on our current understanding of geological time and the organisms that have lived in the past. The second question is about the different methods of preservation that result in the various types of fossils we find."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Your task is to classify given movie review into two categories: 1) positive, and 2) negative based on its content. Several posters have quoted Renoir voicing his desire to make a film showing Ingrid Bergman smiling to camera. The short answer is wouldn't we all whilst the harsh reality is that only a select few got to do so. At this stage of her career Bergman couldn't get arrested; in 1949 she left Hollywood to make a picture in Europe, fell for director Roberto Rossellini and never looked forward. After five turkeys in Italy she was probably ready to open a vein but within the year, after making this for Renoir, she was back where she belonged and with an Oscar to boot for Anastasia. This is one of three movies that Renoir made in color around this time and on balance it's better than The Golden Coach, which isn't hard, and about even with French Can Can. Renoir probably figured that with so much going for her Bergman could get away with a couple of wooden leading men and Renoir picked two doozys in Jean Marais and Mel Ferrer, solid mahogany in both cases. The plot is actually based on a real incident in French history but Renoir is content to give it a once-over-lightly and concentrate on replicating the paintings of his father in set up after set up. In its pastel colors it resembles another film of the period Les Grandes Manouvres which is no bad thing. All in all it remains a pleasant trifle showcasing a beautiful and charismatic actress.

Summarize this article: Renault trackside operations director Alan Permane said the engine performed as expected in testing in Spain this week, adding: \\"It looks good.\\" Renault sources had predicted a performance improvement of 0.4-0.5 seconds a lap from the development. The extra power should put Red Bull at Ferrari's level at all tracks. Red Bull's average qualifying deficit to Ferrari over the first five races of the season is 0.454secs - and Red Bull's fastest lap in Sunday's Spanish Grand Prix was 0.235secs slower than Ferrari's. Mercedes remain at least a further half-second ahead at the front of the field. Red Bull's Max Verstappen won Sunday's race from Ferrari's Kimi Raikkonen, after Mercedes team-mates Lewis Hamilton and Nico Rosberg crashed out. After testing the new engine on Tuesday, Red Bull's Daniel Ricciardo, who led the first half of the Spanish race, said: \\"The progress is definitely there. \\"Now to make that next step; that is the last little step we are after to try to really get on Mercedes. But we are getting closer. That is exciting.\\" Renault reserve driver Esteban Ocon added: \\"It is really good. Really good. I can tell it will be quicker for sure.\\" The new power unit is about 30bhp more powerful thanks to a redesign of the combustion of the internal combustion engine, adopting a clever new technology pioneered by Mercedes when turbo hybrid engines were introduced in 2014. The power boost will still leave the Renault - which in the Red Bull is badged after a sponsor - short of the Mercedes and Ferrari engines, which are reputed to be about 50bhp more powerful than the engine Renault have raced so far this year. But in combination with the excellence of the Red Bull chassis - widely regarded as the second best on the grid after Mercedes - it should be enough to reduce the gap to Ferrari to virtually nothing. Media playback is not supported on this device Renault had originally planned the engine's debut for the Canadian Grand Prix on 10-12 June. There is a possibility they could bring that forward to the race in Monaco next week, but no decision has yet been made. Either way, Ricciardo expects the team to perform well in Monaco. \\"Monaco will be our best chance yet,\\" the Australian said. \\"We had a good chance at the weekend - but for pure speed, Monaco should be interesting.\\" Red Bull team principal Christian Horner said after the Spanish Grand Prix that Renault \\"have done a great job in making progress\\". He added: \\"With what's in the pipeline for the coming races, there is a lot of reason for optimism. \\"If we get what's advertised, it is going to put us in a position at least to race Ferrari every weekend.

But last night 14-year-old Anna Ermakova stepped out of Boris Becker's shadow and on to the catwalk as she appeared at Berlin Fashion Week. The tennis star's  lovechild was conceived during a scandalous, short-lived and much disputed encounter at the London outpost of celebrity haunt Nobu in 1999. Her mother Angela Ermakova initially claimed the liaison took place in a store cupboard but Becker later confessed they had made love on a staircase between two bathrooms. Scroll down for video It cost my marriage, it cost for the next couple of years my private life but having","output":"Anna in my life put things in perspective': In a recent interview, Becker, now 49, opened up about the affair and its impact on his marriage to former wife Barbara Feltus, saying that despite the consequences, having Anna in his life has brought him joy. Step 1: Understand the background and context of the event. In this case, Boris Becker, a famous tennis star, had a lovechild with Angela Ermakova during a scandalous affair in 1999. The child, Anna Ermakova, is now 14 years old and recently made her debut at Berlin Fashion Week. Step 2: Acknowledge the significance of the event. Anna Ermakova's debut at Berlin Fashion Week represents a significant milestone in her life, as she is stepping out of her father's shadow and beginning to forge her path. Step 3: Consider the perspectives of the people involved. Boris Becker has admitted that the affair cost him his marriage and disrupted his private life for several years. However, he also expressed happiness about having Anna in his life. Angela Ermakova, as the mother, likely supports her daughter's endeavors at Berlin Fashion Week. Anna herself might feel a sense of accomplishment and independence from her father's fame with her debut. Step 4: Evaluate the impact of this event on the individuals involved and the wider society. For Anna, her debut at Berlin Fashion Week could open up doors to a career in the fashion industry. Her presence at the event also draws attention to the circumstances of her birth, keeping the public discussion alive regarding the scandalous affair between Becker and Ermakova. In wider society, this event highlights the life and career progression of children born to famous parents, especially those with controversial backstories. Step 5: Conclude with an overview and any future implications. Overall, Anna Ermakova's debut at Berlin Fashion Week marks a crucial turning point in her life as she steps out of her father's shadow and embraces a career in the fashion world.

Please answer the following question: What are the full names of the people who could not coordinate their schedules?  Answer the above question based on the context below:  Aaliyah began recording the album in 1998. She recorded a few songs, including two with longtime collaborator Timbaland, before working on Romeo Must Die. In 1999, while working on the record in New York City, Aaliyah called and asked Trent Reznor, one of her musical idols, to produce a song, but they could not coordinate their schedules. She intended to finish the album by the end of 2000 and resumed its recording while filming in Australia for Queen of the Damned (2002), as she shot her part for the film during the day and recorded songs at night. She said in an interview for Billboard, \\"there were nights when I didn't go into the studio—I was too tired. On the weekends, I always made it.\\" Jomo Hankerson, Blackground president and Aaliyah's cousin, said that he had to \\"bribe the producers\\", who did not want to \\"go halfway around the world!\\" He added that they ultimately had \\"a beautiful time ... making hot music\\".Most of the album's songs were recorded at either Sony Studios in New York City or Sing Sing Studios in Melbourne, including \\"Loose Rap\\", which was done at both studios. Aaliyah recorded \\"More Than a Woman\\" at Manhattan Center Studios, \\"U Got Nerve\\" at Soundtracks Studios in New York City, \\"We Need a Resolution\\" at Westlake Studios, and \\"I Care 4 U\\" at Magic Mix Studios and Music Grinder Studios in Los Angeles. She had first recorded \\"I Care 4 U\\", written by past collaborator Missy Elliott, in 1996 for One in a Million, but scrapped it after that album's completion. Aaliyah worked with Blackground Records' in-house crew of musicians, songwriters, and producers, including novice producers Bud'da, J. Dub, Rapture, and Eric Seats.

Write some highlights for the following article: July 1, 2014, the 17th anniversary of Hong Kong's return to Chinese rule, is set to be a hot, possibly stormy day. But the suffocating weather won't stop pro-democracy Hong Kongers -- possibly hundreds of thousands of them -- from filling the streets, beginning at 3 p.m today. Activists are openly challenging China's vision for the city's political future, and they believe the public is on their side. In a recent unofficial referendum organized by pro-democracy activist group Occupy Central with Love and Peace (OCLP), 787,767 Hong Kongers voted in support of free elections for the city's next leader. READ MORE: Hong Kong's 'referendum' -- What you should know. The almost-800,000 figure represents about 22% of registered voters in Hong Kong, out of a total of 3.5 million registered voters, according to government figures. Before the vote began ten days ago, organizers were hoping around 100,000 people would participate. Benny Tai, a co-organiser of OCLP, said Hong Kongers were \\"using this opportunity to at least show Beijing how determined we are for universal suffrage.\\" Hong Kong's former second-highest-ranked official, Anson Chan, echoed the sentiment in an interview with CNN on Monday. \\"Whatever Beijing says in public now I think it can hardly afford to ignore the voices of 780,000 people.\\" But the Chinese government's reaction was decidedly more frosty, with the government declaring the poll \\"illegal\\" and its results \\"invalid\\" even before the ballots were counted. Rimsky Yuen, Hong Kong's Secretary for Justice, has previously said there is no legal basis for the vote. Yuen, as well a number of other, pro-establishment voices, declined to speak to CNN. A recent Chinese state media editorial said the poll was a \\"farce.\\" Searches for the referendum have also been heavily censored on the Chinese internet. Showdown over democracy. The city's pro-democracy camp wants fully democratic elections for the city's next leader, while China insists it will only allow elections in which it gets to approve the nominees. Specifically, Beijing says it will only allow candidates who \\"love China.\\" The Occupy Central referendum outlined three plans to reform the upcoming election. All three plans proposed that candidates be nominated publicly, regardless of whether the candidates have Beijing's blessing. 42% of participants picked a proposal by the Alliance for True Democracy, which said candidates for Hong Kong's chief executive should be nominated by the public, and conditions such as requiring candidates to \\"love China\\" should not be allowed. Another question asked if Hong Kong's legislature should veto any nomination process that did not meet \\"international standards.\\" This was overwhelmingly approved in the referendum. The high numbers are a sign that Hong Kongers are not about to back down, said Tai. \\"We have an offer and we have a baseline, and this is the thing we will give to the (Hong Kong government),\\" he told CNN. \\"I think a responsible government must respond to that. I cannot see any reason for refusing to meet with us.\\" But if negotiations fail, and no progress is made through legal means, then the group is prepared to disrupt the city to make their statement heard. As a final strategy, Tai says his group may marshal 10,000 people to sit and peacefully block traffic in downtown Hong Kong as a way to pressure Beijing into allowing Hong Kong to exercise \\"genuine universal suffrage.\\" \\"We will only resort to the civil disobedience action as our last resort,\\" said Tai. \\"Only after exhausting all the legal means and still fail to achieve our goals will we resort to civil disobedience.\\" Grassroots support. The city is politicized like at no other time in its recent past. While the July 1st anniversary of the handover has always brought demonstrators out onto Hong Kong's hot, crowded streets, often numbering over 100,000, this year protests are expected to be super-sized. Many Hong Kongers are enraged after the recent publication of a white paper by the Chinese government which declares Beijing's \\"comprehensive jurisdiction\\" over Hong Kong. READ MORE: Alarm in Hong Kong at Chinese white paper affirming Beijing control. Chan said the white paper violates the \\"one country, two systems\\" principle enshrined in Hong Kong's constitutional Basic Law, which lets the city maintain high autonomy despite being a part of China. The white paper \\"makes it quite clear that whatever autonomy we enjoy is for the central government to give and to take away at its pleasure,\\" she said. \\"I think this has caused real concern.\\" The inflammatory document came days after 100,000 people showed up to an annual candlelit vigil for the victims of the 1989 Tiananmen Square crackdown. \\"(The white paper) has spectacularly backfired, it's made people even more angry,\\" Chan said. What's next? The situation in Hong Kong is volatile. Some activists fear a crackdown on freedoms by the Chinese central government, and others look nervously to the possibility of unrest at tomorrow's mass protest. Michael DeGolyer, Director of the Hong Kong Transition Project, an independent organization that monitors governance in the territory, said the future is incredibly difficult to assess because no one is totally sure what China's officials are thinking. \\"We're in a situation where we have a new regime in power and much more volatile circumstances, and we have groups that are much more separatist, challenging the legitimacy of the central government altogether,\\" he said. \\"In these circumstances, it is extremely difficult to tell what the central government intends and what they're thinking and how they'll react.\\" But despite the uncertainty, Hong Kong's democracy supporters remain hopeful. \\"I do not think Beijing has made up its mind on universal suffrage, so let's see what happens in the months ahead,\\" said Chan. \\"The government stance has a little bit softened in the last few days. There's a chance there,\\" said Tai. \\"After (the July 1 protest), we may be able to see whether there's any change in the stance of the Chinese government.\\"","output":"- On July 1, 2014, Hong Kong marked the 17th anniversary of its return to Chinese rule, with potentially hundreds of thousands of pro-democracy Hong Kongers taking to the streets. - In an unofficial referendum organized by pro-democracy group Occupy Central with Love and Peace (OCLP), 787,767 Hong Kongers voted in support of free elections for the city's next leader. - Hong Kong's democracy supporters want fully democratic elections for the city's next leader; however, China insists it will only allow elections in which it gets to approve the nominees. - If negotiations with the Chinese government fail and no progress is made, OCLP may use civil disobedience as a last resort to achieve their goals. - Many Hong Kongers were angered by the Chinese government's recent publication of a white paper asserting Beijing's \\"comprehensive jurisdiction\\" over Hong Kong, which they see as violating the \\"one country, two systems\\" principle."},{"instruction":"I heard that Kai needed a bedtime story each night before going to sleep.

Article: This will appear next to all of your comments      This will NOT appear anywhere on Newser ||||| Weekend Box Office: 'Fantastic Beasts' No. 1 With 75M, Makes Rivals Disappear      Ang Lee's 'Billy Lynn's Long Halftime Walk' and the Miles Teller boxing biopic 'Bleed for This' were both KO'd, while edgy, R-rated teen drama 'The Edge of Seventeen' fared only slightly better; overseas, 'Fantastic Beasts' debuted to 143.3 million for a 218.3 million global launch.      Harry Potter creator J.K. Rowling can still cast a magic spell at the box office — although not as powerful sans the Boy Who Lived, at least in North America.      Warner Bros.' Harry Potter spinoff and prequel Fantastic Beasts and Where to Find Them, from a script by Rowling, topped the weekend domestic box office with 75 million from 4,144 theaters, behind the openings of all eight Harry Potter movies but in line with other high-profile spinoffs, such as the Hobbit trilogy.      Overseas was a different matter, at least in numerous territories. Fantastic Beasts bowed to 143.3 million offshore for a global debut of 218.3 million, and it has yet to open in China and Japan. In South Korea (14.3 million) and Russia (9.8 million), it came in ahead of every Harry Potter film, while in the U.K., it earned 18.3 million, behind only the two final installments.      Fantastic Beasts, which grabbed an A CinemaScore from U.S. audiences, is a crucial test for Warners and Rowling as they look to further expand the Harry Potter Wizarding World with five new films set decades before the events in Harry Potter and featuring a magical new world populated by adults. Eddie Redmayne stars as Newt Scamander, a collector of magical creatures who travels to 1920s New York, where several of his creatures get out. (He's the author of a textbook later used by Harry Potter and other Hogwarts students.)      \\"This was a magical weekend that's the result of inspired storytelling by J.K. and kicks off five new movies,\\" said Warner Bros. domestic distribution president Jeff Goldstein. \\"The Harry Potter films were all based on Rowling's books. Here, J.K. taught herself how to write an original screenplay, and she inspired all those many fans around the world and to take this ride with her.\\"      In the U.S., Fantastic Beasts — rated PG-13 — played notably older than the final two Harry Potter movies, with 65 percent of the audience over the age of 25, compared to 56 percent and 55 percent for Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows — Part 1 and Part 2, respectively. At the same time, there was a large concentration of moviegoers in the 25-35 age range, with 55 percent of Friday's audience under the age of 35. (Females made up 55 percent of ticket buyers overall.)      Disney and Marvel's Doctor Strange continued to wow as it crossed the 570 million mark globally, and will soon overtake fellow Marvel Cinematic Universe title Iron Man (585 million) after already topping several other MCU installments.      However, the post-presidential election bump the box office enjoyed last weekend didn't last, as holdovers saw their usual drops. Doctor Strange, for example, fell 59 percent domestically to 17.7 million to place No. 2. Overseas, the pic took in another sturdy 26 million for a foreign total of 390 million and a global haul of 571.5 million. That includes 103 million in China, where Doctor Strange has exceeded the lifetime totals of superhero titles including Guardians of the Galaxy and Batman v. Superman: Dawn of Justice.      In North America, Fox and DreamWorks Animation's Trolls followed with 17.5 million to pass the 100 million mark domestically and finish Sunday with a 116.2 million cume in North America and 261.3 million worldwide. Paramount release Arrival placed No. 4 with 11.8 million for a domestic total of 43.4 million. And Universal's Almost Christmas rounded out the top five with 7 million for a domestic tally of 25.4 million.      After Fantastic Beasts, the three other new films opening nationwide this weekend fared poorly.      STX's edgy, R-rated coming-of-age drama The Edge of Seventeen debuted to 4.8 million for a seventh-place finish. The film, which cost 9 million to make, had hoped to launch in the 10 million range. \\"We were disappointed but we were very financially responsible, so we were able to take a creative risk,\\" said Adam Fogelson, president of STX's Motion Picture Group.      Bestowed with glowing reviews and an A- CinemaScore, Edge of Seventeen stars Hailee Steinfeld as an awkward teen dealing with her friend falling for her brother, and was helmed by Kelly Fremon Craig in her directorial debut. It also stars Blake Jenner and Woody Harrelson.      Open Road's boxing biopic Bleed for This fared even worse with 2.5 million from 1,459 theaters. The film stars Miles Teller as Vinny Pazienza, a boxer who attempts to make a comeback after a terrible car accident.      Ang Lee's Billy Lynn's Long Halftime Walk is the biggest bomb, earning an estimated 1 million from 1,176 theaters for Sony/TriStar after opening last weekend in New York and Los Angeles. That's even worse than last year's The Walk, which opened to 1.5 million from 448 theaters. Sony studio chief Tom Rothman made both titles when running TriStar and before being named chairman of Sony's Motion Picture Group.      Lee's modern-day war drama, which cost a net 40 million to produce, was shot with groundbreaking technology that virtually no theater can project without new equipment, so it is playing in a digital format everywhere save for a select few theaters. Billy Lynn grossed 350,000 on Friday.      With Hollywood entering the heart of awards season, several high-profile releases debuted in select theaters at the specialty box office this weekend, including Tom Ford's Nocturnal Animals, from Focus Features, and Kenneth Lonergan's Manchester by the Sea, from Amazon Studios and Roadside Attractions.      Manchester, which launched in four cinemas in New York and Los Angeles, grossed 241,230 for a location average of 60,308, one of the best showings of the year and best ever for Roadside.      Nocturnal Animals opted for a larger footprint, opening to 494,000 from 37 locations for a location average of 13,351. Both films hope to serve as strong counterprogramming over Thanksgiving weekend.      Nov. 20, 1 p.m. Updated with foreign numbers. ||||| What is a summary?","output":"J.K.

Please answer the following question: Question: \\"Why were Europeans excited?\\"  Context: \\"By 17 May, the main Austrian army under Charles had arrived on the Marchfeld. Charles kept the bulk of his troops several miles away from the river bank in hopes of concentrating them at the point where Napoleon decided to cross. On 21 May, the French made their first major effort to cross the Danube, precipitating the Battle of Aspern-Essling. The Austrians enjoyed a comfortable numerical superiority over the French throughout the battle; on the first day, Charles disposed of 110,000 soldiers against only 31,000 commanded by Napoleon. By the second day, reinforcements had boosted French numbers up to 70,000. The battle was characterized by a vicious back-and-forth struggle for the two villages of Aspern and Essling, the focal points of the French bridgehead. By the end of the fighting, the French had lost Aspern but still controlled Essling. A sustained Austrian artillery bombardment eventually convinced Napoleon to withdraw his forces back onto Lobau Island. Both sides inflicted about 23,000 casualties on each other. It was the first defeat Napoleon suffered in a major set-piece battle, and it caused excitement throughout many parts of Europe because it proved that he could be beaten on the battlefield.\\"  Answer: Answer:","output":"Europeans were excited because the Battle of Aspern-Essling marked the first time Napoleon had been defeated in a major set-piece battle. This proved that he could be beaten on the battlefield, which was a significant morale boost for those who opposed his dominance in Europe.

Movie plot title: Rock & Rule Movie plot: This plot is for the original Canadian version of the film. Mok, an aging yet legendary rock musician, is on the search for a very special voice that can unleash a powerful demon from another dimension to fulfill his wish of being immortalized as a musician/Magic Man. After traveling around the world looking for the right voice, he returns to his hometown of Ohmtown, a remote, storm-ravaged village famous for its unique power plant. Meanwhile, at a nightclub, Omar, Angel, Dizzy and Stretch perform in a small rock band. As Angel performs a gentle love ballad to a mostly empty audience, Mok hears her sing and his special ring goes off, and he realizes that Angel has the voice he needs. He invites Angel and the band to his mansion outside of town. Omar goads Mok upon meeting him, annoying Mok enough to suggest the band tries \\"Edison Balls\\"- a modern drug, which Omar and Stretch take, incapacitating them. Dizzy sneaks away. Meanwhile, Mok takes Angel on a stroll through his garden and tries to convince her to join him. Initially unaware of Mok's true intentions, she refuses to abandon her band. Unwilling to admit defeat, Mok kidnaps her and takes his blimp to Nuke York, where his summoning, disguised as a concert, will be performed. After Dizzy snaps his band-mates out of their stupor, the trio find out what happened to Angel and they follow the blimp in a stolen police car. Before they reach Nuke York, they are arrested by a border guard. Meanwhile, Angel attempts to escape with the unwitting help of Cinderella, a sister of Mok's goons. While sneaking through the ventilation system, Angel overhears Mok confirming his plans with his computer.

The U.S. Supreme Court signaled Wednesday it may be open to new limits on the government's ability to track someone's movements by accessing data on that person's cellphone.  A case before the high court could result in a landmark decision in the ongoing debate over civil liberties protections in an era of rapid technological change.  At issue is whether law enforcement will be able to access cellphone data that can reveal a person's whereabouts without having to first obtain a court-issued search warrant.  The case stems from the conviction of Timothy Carpenter for a series of robberies back in 2010 and 2011. Prosecutors were able to obtain cellphone records that indicated his location over a period of months, information that proved crucial to his conviction. On Wednesday, lawyers for the American Civil Liberties Union argued that law enforcement should be required to obtain a court-ordered search warrant before obtaining such information.  They also argued that allowing law enforcement to access the cellphone data without a warrant would violate the prohibition on unreasonable search and seizures contained in the Fourth Amendment to the U.S. Constitution.  \\"It is impossible to go about our daily lives without leaving a trail of digital breadcrumbs that reveal where we have been over time, what we have done, who we spent time with,\\" said ACLU attorney Nathan Freed Wessler, who spoke to reporters outside the Supreme Court following oral arguments. \\"It is time for the court, we think, to update Fourth Amendment doctrine to provide reasonable protections today.\\"  Some of the justices also raised concerns about privacy in the digital age.  \\"Most Americans, I think, still want to avoid Big Brother,\\" Justice Sonia Sotomayor, who often sides with the liberal wing of the court, said.  Chief Justice John Roberts, who often sides with conservatives on the court, said the central question was whether the cellphone information should be accessible to the government \\"without a warrant.\\" Question: How long after Timothy Carpenter was convicted did he continue to rob people?

Vere Gordon Childe (14 April 1892 – 19 October 1957) was an Australian archaeologist who specialized in the study of European prehistory. He spent most of his life in the United Kingdom, working as an academic for the University of Edinburgh and then the Institute of Archaeology, London, and wrote twenty-six books during his career. Initially an early proponent of culture-historical archaeology, he later became the first exponent of Marxist archaeology in the Western world. Born in Sydney to a middle-class English migrant family, Childe studied classics at the University of Sydney before moving to England to study classical archaeology at the University of Oxford. There, he embraced the socialist movement and campaigned against the First World War, viewing it as a conflict waged by competing imperialists to the detriment of Europe's working class. Returning to Australia in 1917, he was prevented from working in academia because of his socialist activism, instead working for the Labor Party as the private secretary of the politician John Storey. Growing critical of Labor, he wrote an analysis of their policies and joined the far-left Industrial Workers of the World. Emigrating to London in 1921, he became librarian of the Royal Anthropological Institute and journeyed across Europe to pursue his research into the continent's prehistory, publishing his findings in academic papers and books.

The gloves are very tight. They can hurt the astronauts' fingernails  and even make them fall off. In space, you don't have many choices in what you eat. It's hard to get fresh fruits and vegetables. It is not OK to eat bread because it leaves crumbs . Crumbs could fly around everywhere. In space, it is impossible to have a good shower because water can fly all over the ship and break the machines. Astronauts have to use a special water-shooting  gun and a washcloth. Astronauts lose their bone strength quickly during their stay in space. So far, there is no way to solve this problem. They do exercise while they're in space to try to keep their bones strong as long as possible. Perhaps the hardest part of life in space is the feeling of loneliness.

I'm really terrible with the rules set by others, especially companies. Even as a child, I could never stay inside the lines in colouring books. Some of you might put this down to poor hand-eye coordination, but I maintain that I was a rule-breaker right from the beginning. One of my roles as an engineer with a multiplicity of companies was to set up projects, define the scope of the work, contract the work out and manage the project. I was setting up a robot-based manufacturing cell for the company in the business of making early cellphones. The cell design required some equipment to be designed and built from scratch, so I got a local designer, Fergus, to give me a quote and got him started on the work. Now, any project will run over budget and take longer than planned and the contractor may come back for more money. And so it was with this designer; he wasn't really vocal about it, but he indicated that the work did take a lot more time and expense than he's originally budgeted. My usual reaction to these things is that this is not my problem. Most of the companies I've work for have lost money, so why should I give a rat's ass if some other company comes up a little short? In this case though, I liked Fergus and, as he was really a one-man operation, I decided to cut him some slack. But first, I had to get permission from my boss to drop another few grand into Fergus's jeans. My boss refused. Having someone tell me I can't do something really brings out my dark side; especially around the time of the full moon. Not long before, we had just waved a fond(-ish) farewell to our president as he was going on to greener fields. As a parting gift, the company bought him either a boat or a motor home, I forget which, and equipped it with three of their cell phones.

Write a summary based on this article: A filmmaker has gone into hiding after his movie attacking Islam's Prophet Muhammad sparked assaults on U.S. missions in Egypt and Libya, where an American State Department officer was killed.      Writer and director Sam Bacile spoke on the phone Tuesday from an unidentified location. He remained defiant, saying Islam is \\"a cancer\\" and he wanted his film to make a political statement.      The 56-year-old identifies himself as an Israeli Jew and says he believes his video will help his native land by exposing Islam's flaws to the world. Excerpts dubbed into Arabic were posted on YouTube.      Among other claims that have caused outrage, the film claims Muhammad was a philanderer who approved of child sexual abuse.      Bacile says he's sorry for the person who died, but blames lax embassy security. ||||| Read this story in Arabic.      Cairo (CNN) -- The United States said it was taking measures to protect its citizens worldwide after protesters angry about an online film considered offensive to Islam attacked U.S. diplomatic compounds in Libya and Egypt on Tuesday, killing an American.      In Cairo, several men scaled the walls of the U.S. Embassy and tore down its American flag, according to CNN producer Mohamed Fadel Fahmy, who was on the scene.      In Libya, witnesses say members of a radical Islamist group called Ansar al-Sharia protested near the U.S. Consulate in Benghazi, where NATO jets established no-fly zones last year to blunt ground attacks from then Libyan strongman Moammar Gadhafi.      The group then clashed with security forces in the city, blocking roads leading to the consulate, witnesses said.      A U.S. State Department officer was killed in the violence in Benghazi, Secretary of State Hillary Clinton said in a statement late Tuesday.      \\"We are heartbroken by this terrible loss,\\" Clinton said. \\"Our thoughts and prayers are with his family and those who have suffered in this attack.\\"      Clinton said that she condemned the attack on the U.S. facilities \\"in the strongest terms\\" and that following Tuesday's events, the U.S. government was \\"working with partner countries around the world to protect our personnel, our missions and American citizens worldwide.\\"      Libya's General National Congress also condemned the attack, saying it \\"led to the regrettable injury and death of a number of individuals.\\" Lawmakers said in a statement Tuesday night that they were investigating.      It was unclear whether the two attacks were coordinated, CNN national security contributor Fran Townsend said Tuesday night.      \\"One such breach of an embassy or consulate's walls or security on any given day would be tremendous news. ... The fact that two of them happened on the same day that is the 9/11 anniversary where Americans are remembering those that we lost, you have to ask yourself, what are American officials trying to understand about this and whether or not these two are related?\\" she asked.      In Egypt, police and army personnel formed defensive lines around the U.S. Embassy in an effort to prevent demonstrators from advancing, but not before the protesters affixed a black flag atop a ladder in the American compound.      The black flag, which hangs in full view from inside the complex, is adorned with white characters that read, \\"There is no God but Allah and Mohammed is his messenger,\\" an emblem often used by Islamic radicals.      A volley of warning shots were fired, as a large crowd gathered around the compound, although it is not clear who fired the shots.      Are you there? Share your images and videos.      Egyptian groups point to U.S. websites, including YouTube, that have scenes from the film. Some anti-Muslim blogs also have flagged the movie.      In a series of disjointed scenes, the film depicts Prophet Mohammed as a child molester, womanizer and ruthless killer.      The movie was made by Sam Bacile, an Israeli-American real-estate developer, according to the Wall Street Journal.      Bacile -- who wrote, directed and produced the film -- said he wanted to showcase his view of Islam as a hateful religion, the Journal reported, citing a telephone interview with him.      Bacile, 52, told the newspaper that to make the film, he had raised 5 million from about 100 Jewish donors, who he declined to identify. He said he made the two-hour movie over a three-month period last year in California, using about 60 actors and 45 crew members, the Journal reported.      Most of the Muslim world considers depictions of Mohammed to be blasphemous and deeply offensive.      \\"Some have sought to justify this vicious behavior as a response to inflammatory material posted on the Internet,\\" Clinton said. \\"The United States deplores any intentional effort to denigrate the religious beliefs of others. Our commitment to religious tolerance goes back to the very beginning of our nation.\\"      But she stressed that \\"there is never any justification for violent acts of this kind.\\"      Embassy officials issued a warning to Americans in Egypt, telling them to avoid the demonstrations which \\"may gather in front of the U.S. Embassy, or Egyptian government buildings such as the People's Assembly and Ministry of Interior.\\"      \\"It is unclear if large numbers will take to the streets, but clashes may occur should two opposing groups come into contact with one another,\\" the U.S. Embassy said in a statement. \\"Large gatherings and non-essential travel in and around downtown and Garden City should be avoided this afternoon.\\"      Frenzied protesters could been seen Tuesday afternoon holding up bits of a shredded American flag to television camera crews while chanting anti-U.S. slogans.      An embassy phone operator told CNN that the compound had been cleared of diplomatic personnel earlier in the day ahead of the apparent threat, while Egyptian riot police and the army were called in.      \\"This is an expression of a feeling that is thought to be an insult,\\" said Nizih El Naggary, a spokesman for the Egyptian Foreign Ministry. \\"But events like this are extremely deplorable. And we have to work to get things under control.\\"      The Foreign Ministry issued a statement Tuesday, pledging to protect embassies and warning of the protests' potentially debilitating effects on the Egyptian economy.      \\"There are police forces at the demonstrations,\\" El Naggary said. \\"They should be protecting the embassy and asking people to leave.\\"      Several individuals claimed responsibility for organizing the demonstrations Tuesday, including Salafist leader Wesam Abdel-Wareth, who is president of Egypt's conservative Hekma television channel.      Mohamed al-Zawahiri -- the brother of al Qaeda leader Ayman al-Zawahiri -- added, \\"We called for the peaceful protest joined by different Islamic factions including the Islamicc Jihad (and the) Hazem Abu Ismael movement.\\"      \\"We were surprised to see the big numbers show up, including the soccer Ultra fans,\\" he said. \\"I just want to say, how would the Americans feel if films insulting leading Christian figures like the pope or historical figures like Abraham Lincoln were produced?\\"      He added that \\"the film portrays the prophet in a very ugly manner, alluding to topics like sex, which is not acceptable.\\"      The U.S. Embassy in Cairo announced that it had canceled visa services for Wednesday.      It also said in a statement that it \\"condemns the continuing efforts by misguided individuals to hurt the religious feelings of Muslims -- as we condemn efforts to offend believers of all religions.\\"      \\"Respect for religious beliefs is a cornerstone of American democracy,\\" the statement said. \\"We firmly reject the actions by those who abuse the universal right of free speech to hurt the religious beliefs of others.\\"      The embassy statement set off a political spat back in the United States after the Republican presidential nominee, Mitt Romney, criticized its message and linked it to his opponent for the White House.      \\"It's disgraceful that the Obama Administration's first response was not to condemn attacks on our diplomatic missions, but to sympathize with those who waged the attacks,\\" Romney said in a statement released late Tuesday.      He said he was \\"outraged\\" by the attacks in Libya and Egypt.      The Obama campaign quickly responded to Romney's comments.      \\"We are shocked that, at a time when the United States of America is confronting the tragic death of one of our diplomatic officers in Libya, Governor Romney would choose to launch a political attack,\\" Ben LaBolt, an Obama campaign spokesman said in an email.      Demonstrations elicited a mixture of reactions from the Egyptian street, where last year tens of thousands turned out in opposition to former Egyptian President Hosni Mubarak.      This summer, Egypt's first Islamist president, Mohamed Morsy, was sworn into power at Tahrir Square, the scene of the nation's revolution in 2011.      Though Tuesday's embassy protests are the first that Morsy has dealt with, Egypt recently produced similar scenarios when protesters attacked the Israeli and Syrian embassies in unrelated episodes.      \\"These protests are a bad image for Egypt,\\" said a Cairo street vendor named Ahmed. \\"Of course I'm against insulting Islam, but it's the undereducated, poor people who are out here causing problems.\\"      \\"All I want for Egypt is security and stability,\\" he said. \\"And as you can see this isn't it.\\"      The incident occurred on the 11th anniversary of the 9/11 attacks as crowds gathered across the United States in somber remembrance of a day that left nearly 3,000 people dead.      Tuesday's focus on the controversial film also drew comparisons to outcry generated from a 2008 movie produced by an anti-Muslim Dutch lawmaker to portray Islam as a violent religion.      Geert Wilders' film \\"Fitna,\\" which he released online, featured images of terrorist acts superimposed over verses from the Quran.

Obama's Syria Policy Slammed by Diplomats in Internal Memo Dozens of U.S. diplomats have signed an internal memo lambasting President Barack Obama’s strategy in Syria, demanding stronger military action and targeted air strikes on the country’s leader Bashar Assad. The memo has been endorsed by 51 members of the State Department and slams Assad’s repeated violation of a cease-fire agreement amid his country’s five-year civil war, the New York Times reports. It also says American policy has been “overwhelmed” in Syria and advocates “a judicious use of stand-off and air weapons” to bolster U.S. diplomatic efforts. Obama’s military focus in the Middle Eastern nation thus far has been about eradicating the Islamic State (ISIS) extremist group while attempting to win over Assad through dialogue, but the memo argues that Assad’s bombing of his own citizens is the “root cause of the instability that continues to grip Syria and the broader region.” What is a short summary of the above article?","output":"The article discusses an internal memo signed by 51 US diplomats criticizing President Barack Obama's strategy in Syria.

Mo told a reception in the Chinese Embassy in Stockholm that it was a responsibility to protect the diversity in cultures while creating the diversity as well. He said that translation played a very important role in bridging different cultures, adding that without the translators who had translated his books he couldn't have won the Nobel Prize. \\"I think translation is much harder than writing itself,\\" said Mo Yan, explaining that it only took 43 days to write the work Life and Death Are Wearing Me Out, while it took Swedish sinologist Anna Gustafsson Chen six years to translate the work. Earlier in the day he visited a Swedish middle school, where about 20 Swedish students who were studying Chinese welcomed him by singing the theme song in the movie \\"Red Sorghum\\" which was based on his novel of the same name. \\"Unlike the rough and husky voice in the movie, the Swedish students presented the song with a gentle and soft voice, making it rather a romantic song,\\" Mo told the gathering at the Chinese Embassy. He said he hoped that there were going to be some outstanding translators among the students, adding that meeting them made him \\"extraordinarily happy.\\" He said language was going to be \\"the most reliable way\\" for interaction between peoples because one had to know the language of a nation to understand the people's inner world and spiritual life. Lan Lijun, Chinese Ambassador to Sweden, said that Chinese literature had stepped into the spotlight worldwide after Mo Yan had won the Nobel Prize, which would help contribute to the literature communication and dialogue between China and the rest of the world.

Question: What does the alien use to activate the transportation device? Title: Being from Another Planet Movie plot: While California University of the Sciences professor Douglas McCadden (Ben Murphy) explores the tomb of the ancient Egyptian king Tutankhamun, an earthquake causes a wall in the tomb to collapse, revealing a hidden chamber. Inside, McCadden finds a mummy in a sarcophagus. Unbeknownst to McCadden, the \\"mummy\\" is not the body of a dead Egyptian, but an extraterrestrial alien in suspended animation, being wrapped up and buried alive thousands of years before and covered with a dormant, green fungus. The body is brought back to California and McCadden has it examined by Dr. Ken Melrose (Austin Stoker) and X-rayed by student Peter Sharpe (Kevin Brophy) before a big press conference about the discovery. While reviewing the X-rays, Sharpe notices there are five crystals around the \\"mummy's\\" head. Sharpe steals the crystals and makes new X-rays to cover up his theft. He sells four of the crystals to students who are unaware of their origin. The second set of X-rays overdose the body with radiation. This causes the fungus to re-activate and the alien to awaken from suspended animation. At the press conference the next day, one of the students touches the fungus on the sarcophagus, which eats away one of his fingers. The sarcophagus is then opened in front of the press to reveal that the mummy is gone. Melrose and his colleague Dr. Hayworth (Antoinette Bower) attempt to identify the fungus and destroy it. At first, everyone assumes that the mummy's disappearance is because of a fraternity prank. However, University President Wendell Rossmore (James Karen) wants to pin the \\"theft\\" on McCadden, so that he can give the Egyptian department's directorship to his flunkie, Bruce Serrano (Sam Chew Jr).

Rose was born April 14, 1941, in Cincinnati, Ohio, one of four children born to Harry Francis \\"Pete\\" and LaVerne Rose. He was a member of the Order of DeMolay as a young boy and was encouraged by his parents to participate in sports. He played baseball and football at Western Hills High School. Although Rose was small for his age, he earned the starting running back position on his freshman football team. During a spring training game against the Chicago White Sox in 1963, the Reds' regular second baseman, Don Blasingame, pulled a groin muscle; Rose got his chance and made the most of it. During another spring training game against the New York Yankees, Whitey Ford gave him the derisive nickname \\"Charlie Hustle\\" after Rose sprinted to first base after drawing a walk. Despite (or perhaps because of) the manner in which Ford intended it, Rose adopted that nickname as a badge of honor. In Ken Burns' documentary Baseball, Mickey Mantle claimed that Ford gave Rose the nickname after Rose, playing in left field, made an effort to climb the fence to try to catch a Mantle home run that everyone could see was headed over everything.  Rose made his major league debut on April 8, 1963 (Opening Day) against the Pittsburgh Pirates and drew a walk in his first plate appearance. After going 0-for-11, Rose got his first Major League hit on April 13, a triple off Pittsburgh's Bob Friend. He hit .273 for the year and won the National League Rookie of the Year Award, collecting 17 of 20 votes.  Rose entered the US Army Reserves after the 1963 baseball season. He was assigned to Fort Knox for six months of active duty, which was followed by six years of regular attendance with a 478th Engineering Battalion USAR at Fort Thomas, Kentucky. At Fort Knox, he was a platoon guide and graduated from United States Army Basic Training January 18, 1964, one week before his marriage to Karolyn. Rose then remained at Fort Knox to assist the sergeant in training the next platoon and to help another sergeant train the Fort's baseball team. Later in his Fort Thomas service, Rose served as company cook which entailed coming in early for the one weekend/month meeting so that he could get out early enough to participate in local Reds games.

Given the background: Earthquakes may take place every day near a volcano. But before an eruption, the number and size of earthquakes increases. This is the result of magma pushing upward into the magma chamber. This motion causes stresses on neighboring rock to build up. Eventually the ground shakes. A continuous string of earthquakes may indicate that a volcano is about to erupt. Scientists use seismographs to record the length and strength of each earthquake.  and the situation: Two neighboring cities are situated in a volcanic area with lots of earthquakes. Park city is situated near a very active volcano, while Hill city is situated 50 miles north.  Answer the following question: Which city experiences more motion causing stresses on neighboring rock to build up?","output":"Based on the information given, Park City would experience more motion causing stresses on neighboring rock to build up as it is situated near a very active volcano. The proximity to the volcano suggests that the city would be more affected by the push upward of magma into the volcano's magma chamber - the process that contributes to stresses accumulating in the adjacent rock. Consequently, this build-up of stress is likely to induce more earthquakes in Park City as compared to Hill City, which is situated 50 miles north.    It's important to note that the occurrence of earthquakes and their strength can vary greatly in different locations based on a variety of factors including distance from the epicenter, the depth of the earthquake, the geology of the area, amongst other factors. However, under the assumption that all other factors are equal, the closer proximity of Park City to the active volcano would make it more susceptible to the build-up of stresses on neighboring rock and therefore more earthquakes."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant that follows instruction extremely well.

Is it possible to conclude that if the premise is true, then so is the hypothesis?","output":"Yes, it is possible to conclude that if the premise is true, then so is the hypothesis. To understand this, let's break down and analyze the premise and hypothesis separately, and then identify their relationship. Premise: \\"It makes you very predictable.\\" This statement suggests that there is a specific factor or situation (let's call it X) that leads to a person becoming highly predictable in their actions, behaviors, or decisions. In other words, due to the presence of X, one can anticipate what the person will do in certain circumstances. Hypothesis: \\"It doesn't make you unpredictable.\\" This statement works as a negation or contradiction of the original premise. The hypothesis implies that the same factor or situation (X) does not lead to a person becoming unpredictable or difficult to anticipate in their actions, behaviors, or decisions. In essence, the hypothesis is arguing that it's not the case that X contributes to unpredictability. Now, let's analyze the relationship between the premise and the hypothesis. If the premise is true (that the presence of X makes a person very predictable), it inherently leads to the fact that X does not make the person unpredictable. The concept of predictability and unpredictability are opposites; therefore, if you are one, you cannot be the other. So, when the premise is considered true, it is a logical conclusion to say that the hypothesis is also true. If X makes you very predictable, then it cannot make you unpredictable. The connection between these two statements creates a cause and effect relationship. Since being predictable is the opposite of being unpredictable, it is impossible for X to cause both at the same time. In conclusion, if the premise is true, then it logically implies that the hypothesis is true as well. The presence of X, which makes a person very predictable, inherently disallows the same person from being unpredictable. The statements are mutually exclusive, and if one is true, the other must be true too."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

There have been horrible nights at the table, where we shared bad news. There have been fabulous nights where we celebrated successes and talked about exciting things to come. There have been nights where the kids can see that Mom and Dad are “at odds” and nights where they see us push that aside and joke with each other for the sake of saving the evening. When they were little, we did “About Your Day” - one funny thing, one sad thing, one new thing you learned. Now, they are all teenagers, and the conversations just seem to flow, with never enough time to fit it all in before someone has to rush off to work, to study, or to get ready for bed because we are eating “after practice”. My twins will be Seniors next year, and I know that our table will look a little different from now on. But when I look at that worn oak (outdated) table, that needs refinishing in the worst way - I am grateful for the evenings there, where my kiddos learned to be a family. Don’t be misled, we are not the Cleavers. We have “Fun Friday” where Mom does not get to badger them about their table manners (ugh - they revel in this), Sometimes we eat in the living room while we watch a movie, sometimes we eat in shifts because of our schedules. However, the majority of meals have been together ~ I feel like this is a gift we gave them. According to the above context, choose the correct option to answer the following question. Question: The narrator is likely in what situation at the end of the story?

But the Muslim cleric who is running for parliament in Afghanistan is calling for the murder of American children in response to scorched Korans, which is worse. Where is the media's focus?      Book burning is antithetical to American ideals. People have a constitutional right to burn a Koran if they want to, but doing so is insensitive and an unnecessary provocation – much like building a mosque at Ground Zero.      I would hope that Pastor Terry Jones and his supporters will consider the ramifications of their planned book-burning event. It will feed the fire of caustic rhetoric and appear as nothing more than mean-spirited religious intolerance. Don’t feed that fire. If your ultimate point is to prove that the Christian teachings of mercy, justice, freedom, and equality provide the foundation on which our country stands, then your tactic to prove this point is totally counter-productive.      Our nation was founded in part by those fleeing religious persecution. Freedom of religion is integral to our charters of liberty. We don’t need to agree with each other on theological matters, but tolerating each other without unnecessarily provoking strife is how we ensure a civil society. In this as in all things, we should remember the Golden Rule. Isn’t that what the Ground Zero mosque debate has been about?      - Sarah Palin ||||| It turns out that tolerant, moderate Malaysian Muslims didn’t see things quite that way. They took the Christians’ ecumenical gesture as an affront — an effort to proselytize for Christianity or, as Imam Rauf himself put it, “to manipulate the word [“Allah”] to win converts.” So the tolerant, moderate Muslims did their usual Terry-Jackass-Jones-on-steroids routine: They didn’t just burn Bibles, they fire-bombed churches. Non-Islamic proselytism is prohibited by sharia, as Imam Rauf, who wants the United States to be more sharia-compliant, could tell you.      And what did Rauf do? Did he condemn this blatant Christianophobia? Did he lecture Malaysians that thewas perfectly within its legal rights to invoke “Allah” in the service of Christianity, and that living in a tolerant, pluralistic society that ensures free expression means accepting the’s actions even if they make Muslims uncomfortable?      Are you kidding?      Instead, Imam Rauf took to the newspapers to admonish Christians on the need to show more sensitivity to Muslims’ feelings. “My message to the Christian community in Malaysia,” he proclaimed, “is that using the word Allah to mean the Christian God may be theologically and legally correct, but in the context of Malaysia, it is socially provocative. If you want to have influence with people in Malaysia, you must find a way to convey your message without provoking this kind of response.”      You know what else might be “socially provocative”? A giant mosque at Ground Zero.      – Andrew C. McCarthy, a senior fellow at the National Review Institute, is the author, most recently, of The Grand Jihad: How Islam and the Left Sabotage America. ||||| There is nothing you can do about the crazy 5 percent except ask the police to keep an eye on them during large public events, where they sometimes appear carrying machine guns just to make a political point about the Second Amendment. And, in situations like a Koran-burning, make it clear that the rest of us disagree.      Photo      So far, the people lining up to denounce the burning of the Koran include the pope, Gen. David Petraeus and Secretary of State Hillary Clinton . On the Republican side, Haley Barbour , theMississippi governor and would-be presidential contender, stepped up to the plate. “I don’t think there is any excuse for it,” said Barbour at a breakfast sponsored by The Christian Science Monitor .      Unfortunately, Barbour followed up his bow to tolerance by suggesting that the public’s confusion over Barack Obama ’s religion is because of the fact that “this is a president that we know less about than any other president in history.” The governor claimed that Americans had been particularly deprived of information on Obama’s youth, while they knew a great deal about the formative years of the other chief executives all the way back to the way the youthful George Washington “chopped down a cherry tree.”      Let us reconsider the above paragraph in light of the fact that while Obama wrote an entire book about his childhood, Washington never chopped down the cherry tree.

While a pope, a general and a cabinet member are speaking out, the candidates running in this year’s elections seem to be superquiet about the Koran-burning. However, quite a few have been racing to bash the Muslim community center for Lower Manhattan . In Florida, the gubernatorial candidate Rick Scott has an ad railing against a mosque “just yards away” from ground zero, which is semiaccurate only if you believe “city blocks” and “yards” are the same thing. And in New York, the Republican candidates for governor appear to be running for the Mosque Removal slot on the ballot.      “Just before the primary, we had candidates who thought they might gain more votes by bashing Islam,” said Saleh Sbenaty, a leader of the Muslim families in Murfreesboro, Tenn., whose community center construction site has been vandalized twice in recent weeks. “We had a rough, rough time during the primary.”      My memories of Sept. 11, 2001, are still intense, and they are mainly about the outpouring of concern from the rest of the country. The piles of donated clothes and food piled up, unused but not necessarily unwanted since each bit was a token of someone’s good will toward the city. Helping us achieve that state of public grace is the highest possible duty of every elected official.      But, lately, they’ve abdicated or worse. And the fight for public sanity has fallen to average citizens, like Professor Sbenaty, who is still trying to explain to the rest of the world what happened in his community. “Let me say first,” he told an interviewer on NPR, “there are crazy people in every society.” ||||| A summary of this is?","output":"The news article discusses the controversy surrounding book burning, particularly the burning of the Koran, and the construction of a mosque near Ground Zero. It highlights the insensitive and provocative nature of these acts, calling for consideration of the ramifications of planned book-burning events and reminding that America is built upon ideals of religious freedom and tolerance. The article also mentions instances of backlash against Christian churches in Malaysia by moderate Muslims who perceived the use of the word \\"Allah\\" as an insult, as well as Imam Rauf's response, which called for Christians to show more sensitivity to Muslims' feelings. The article also touches upon the response of public figures such as the pope, Gen. David Petraeus, and Secretary of State Hillary Clinton to the Koran-burning events, while noting that political candidates have been more vocal about opposing the construction of a Muslim community center in New York City. The author concludes by emphasizing the importance of religious tolerance and acknowledging that there are extremists everywhere, but this should not compromise the core values of society."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Получение повышения на работе обычно означает улучшение финансового положения, признание ваших усилий и профессионального роста. Однако это может быть вызовом, особенно если вам нужно просить о нем у вашего непосредственного руководителя. Важно быть готовым предложить рациональные аргументы и продемонстрировать свою ценность для компании. Вот несколько советов и идей, как это сделать: 1. Покажите свои достижения и результаты работы: Составьте список своих достижений и результата работы, демонстрирующих, как вы способствовали росту и успеху компании. Опишите новые навыки, которыми вы овладели и как они были полезны для компании. 2. Сравните свою заработную плату с рынком: Исследуйте стандарты оплаты труда для людей с аналогичными навыками и опытом, как в вашем регионе, так и в вашей отрасли. Это поможет вам понять, предлагает ли ваш работодатель конкурентоспособную зарплату. 3. Получите обратную связь от коллег и партнеров: Нейтральные и объективные комментарии о вашей работе от других людей могут также укрепить вашу позицию и показать вам глаза начальника с лучшей стороны. 4. Имейте конкретную сумму в виду: Зная, сколько вы хотите получить и как она позиционируется на рынке, вы сможете предложить конкретное и обоснованное требование к увеличению зарплаты. 5. Готовьтесь к переговорам: Начальник может предложить компромисс – меньше денег или дополнительные льготы, такие как больше отпуска или гибкое рабочее время. Главное – знать, насколько вы готовы идти на уступки и как далеко можете зайти. 6. Выбирайте правильный момент: Подумайте о том, когда лучше всего будет обратиться к начальнику с просьбой о повышении. Хорошим моментом может быть после успешного завершения проекта или после получения крупного клиента. 7. Будьте конструктивными и уверенными: Во время разговора старайтесь оставаться спокойными, уверенными и конструктивными, используя свои аргументы и сконцентрировавшись на фактах, а не на эмоциях. 8. Не бойтесь просить помощи: Если представление о прошении о повышении кажется вам слишком стрессовым, обратитесь к коллегам, друзьям или профессиональным консультантам, которые могут вам помочь.

Firstly, the tweet highlights physical discomfort as the user mentions their left hip hurting, and uses the phrase \\"hurting a lot,\\" which implies a significant level of pain. Pain and discomfort are predominantly associated with negative emotions and experiences, further supporting the categorization of the sentiment as negative. Secondly, the tweet outlines an issue that occurred during sleep, mentioning that the pillows came out from between the person's legs. This statement insinuates that the individual is concerned about the potential consequences of this event, especially as they are already experiencing pain in their hip. The uncertainty and worry expressed in this part of the tweet contribute to the overall negative sentiment. Lastly, the tweet concludes with the words \\"I hope nothing bad happened,\\" which implies concern and is indicative of a negative sentiment. The use of the word \\"bad\\" strengthens this association, as it directly refers to an unfavorable outcome. In this context, the person's thoughts are focused on potential harm or negative consequences related to their health or well-being, further reiterating the sentiment's negativity.

You will be given a task. You must generate a detailed and long answer. Philip Alfred Mickelson (born June 16, 1970), nicknamed Lefty, is an American professional golfer. He has won 43 events on the PGA Tour, including five major championships: three Masters titles (2004, 2006, 2010), a PGA Championship (2005), and an Open Championship (2013). Mickelson is one of 16 players in the history of golf to win at least three of the four majors. He has won every major except the U.S. Open, where he has finished runner-up a record six times. Mickelson attended Arizona State University in Tempe on a golf scholarship and became the face of amateur golf in the United States, capturing three NCAA individual championships and three Haskins Awards (1990, 1991, 1992) as the outstanding collegiate golfer. With three individual NCAA championships, he shares the record for most individual NCAA championships alongside Ben Crenshaw. Mickelson also led the Sun Devils to the NCAA team title in 1990. Over the course of his collegiate career, he won 16 tournaments.  Mickelson was the second collegiate golfer to earn first-team All-American honors all four years. In 1990, he also became the first with a left-handed swing to win the U.S. Amateur title. Mickelson secured perhaps his greatest achievement as an amateur in January 1991, winning his first PGA Tour event, the Northern Telecom Open, in Tucson. At age 20, he was only the sixth amateur to win a tour event and the first in over five years after Scott Verplank at the Western Open in August 1985. Other players to accomplish this feat include Doug Sanders (1956 Canadian Open) and Gene Littler (1954 San Diego Open). With five holes remaining, Mickelson led by a stroke, but made a triple-bogey and was then three behind. The leaders ahead of him then stumbled, and he birdied 16 and 18 to win by a stroke. To date, it is the most recent win by an amateur at a PGA Tour event.  That April, Mickelson was the low amateur at the Masters Tournament in Augusta, Georgia. With his two-year PGA Tour exemption from the Tucson win, he played in several tour events in 1992 while an amateur but failed to make a cut. Answer this question using a quote from the following article: Did Phil play golf in college?","output":"Yes, Phil Mickelson did play golf in college. As mentioned earlier, he attended Arizona State University in Tempe on a golf scholarship and became the face of amateur golf in the United States.

Step 2: Compare the key elements with the new sentence - In the sentence \\"The siblings are petting their pet pig\\", the key elements are siblings, petting, and pet pig. Step 3: Analyze the similarities and differences between the two groups of key elements: - The action of 'petting' is present in both sentences. - The original sentence mentions 'young children' while the new sentence refers to 'siblings'. Siblings can be considered a group of young children, but the specific relationship of the original group of young children as siblings is not explicitly stated. - The original sentence mentions a 'piglet' while the new sentence mentions a 'pet pig'. A piglet can grow up and become a pet pig. However, a pet pig might not necessarily be a piglet, and the fact that it's a pet is not mentioned in the original sentence. Step 4: Conclusion - Based on the analysis, the sentence \\"The siblings are petting their pet pig.\\" can be related to the original sentence, but it includes additional information about the relationship between the children and the pig, as well as the pig's status as a pet. Therefore, the new sentence is not a true sentence based solely on the original sentence.

Given the question: Given the following context:  Descriptions of Imogen as a small child indicate that she had blue eyes, fair hair, an oval face reminiscent of her father's, and a rather prominent nose inherited from her mother.  In 1912, at the age of five, she joined the kindergarten class at the Froebel Institute, and remained at the school for five years. Summers were often spent at the Holsts' rented country cottage at Thaxted in Essex, where Gustav Holst began an annual Whitsun Festival in 1916.In 1917 Imogen began boarding at Eothen, a small, private school for girls in Caterham, where Jane Joseph, Gustav's star pupil from SPGS, taught music.  A letter home, dated 17 July 1917, tells of \\"compertishions [sic], and ripping prizes, and strawberries and cream for tea\\".  At the school, Imogen studied piano with Eleanor Shuttleworth, violin with André Mangeot (described as \\"topping\\") and theory with Jane Joseph (\\"ripping\\"). Under Joseph's tuition Imogen produced her first compositions—two instrumental pieces and four Christmas carol tunes—which she numbered as Ops. 1, 2, and 3. In the summer term of 1920, she composed and choreographed a \\"Dance of the Nymphs and Shepherds\\", which was performed at the school under her direction on 9 July.Imogen left Eothen in December 1920 hoping to study under Ruby Ginner at the Ginner-Mawer School of Dance and Drama, but was rejected on health grounds, although there appeared to be no significant medical issue. She then studied at home under a governess, while waiting to start at St Paul's Girls School in the autumn. At Whitsun 1921 she took part as a dancer in her father's production of Purcell's semi-opera from 1690, Masque of Dioclesian, held in the St Paul's School grounds and repeated a week later in Hyde Park.In September 1921 Imogen began at St Paul's Girls School, and became a boarder from Spring 1922.

Disappointed but undeterred, she began searching for alternative options that would provide the same aesthetic appeal without breaking the bank. As a creative and resourceful individual, Janie considered a variety of solutions. First, she thought about learning how to create her own prints using affordable tools and materials. She researched online tutorials and various techniques, such as block printing, screen printing, and digital art software. While it would take some time to develop her skills, Janie realized that creating her own prints would not only save money but also provide a sense of personal accomplishment and an opportunity to express her artistic flair. Next, Janie explored local thrift stores and flea markets in the hopes of finding a similar print at a reduced price. She spent her free time visiting these locations, perusing the wide assortment of pre-owned artwork, and chatting with vendors to negotiate better deals. Through her diligent efforts, Janie eventually found a beautifully framed print that matched her desired aesthetic and was within her budget. Another option that Janie contemplated was reaching out to local artists for a commissioned artwork based on the original print she had admired. This way, she could support local talent, have a unique piece of art tailored to her preferences, and potentially pay a more reasonable price than what the store had demanded for the print. After contacting a few artists and discussing her ideas, Janie received several quotes that were much more affordable than the original print she had seen at the store.

She signed up for newsletters and set up sale alerts, allowing her to stay informed about any upcoming promotions. After a few weeks of monitoring different websites, she was excited to find a substantial discount on the print, making it more reasonably priced. In the end, Janie's determination to find a more cost-effective solution paid off. She managed to acquire the desired print during an online sale, and through her research and exploration, she gained valuable knowledge and experience in the world of art and design.

This rapid evolution has introduced new media models to cater to diverse preferences and needs. One model, however, has gained increasing attention for its potential to set itself apart from the competition—let's call this \\"Yet Another New Media Model\\" or YANMM. In this article, we'll explore the core elements that define YANMM, examine its key advantages and challenges, and discuss its potential implications on the future of media. Defining Yet Another New Media Model (YANMM) YANMM reflects a groundbreaking approach to content creation, distribution, and monetization. It seeks to address the shortcomings of existing models while capitalizing on their strengths. The model can be characterized by the following primary features: 1. Hybridization: YANMM integrates various forms of content dissemination, such as subscription-based services, ad-supported content, pay-per-view pieces, and sponsored collaborations. By blending these revenue streams, this model ensures enhanced financial stability and offers a catered experience to users with different willingness to pay for content. 2. Personalization and Customization: YANMM leverages sophisticated algorithms and data analysis to offer highly tailored content recommendations that cater to users' specific interests, preferences, and behaviors. This personalization propels user engagement and increases satisfaction. 3. Mobile-first Focus: Recognizing the rising dominance of mobile devices in content consumption, YANMM prioritizes mobile optimization in its design and distribution strategies. This creates an intuitive and seamless experience for its target audience. 4. Creator Empowerment: YANMM places strong emphasis on supporting content creators by enabling them to retain control over their intellectual property, set their pricing structures, and maintain direct relationships with their audiences. 5. Emphasis on User Experience (UX): YANMM ensures an interactive and engaging experience by incorporating multimedia content, gamified elements, and a user-friendly interface. A positive UX is paramount in attracting and retaining the audience's attention in the digital era. Key Advantages YANMM's hybrid and adaptable nature promises several benefits over traditional media models. These advantages include: 1. Diversification of Revenue Streams: By amalgamating multiple monetization techniques, YANMM increases financial security and decreases the risks associated with relying on a single revenue source. 2. Inclusivity: By offering different pricing tiers and consumption options, YANMM caters to various consumer profiles, promoting inclusivity and broadening its market reach. 3. Enhanced User Satisfaction: With a focus on personalization, mobile optimization, and UX, YANMM promises a more enjoyable and engaging experience for its users. 4. Creator Incentivization: By giving content creators flexibility in monetization, ownership, and connection to their audience, YANMM encourages the production of high-quality content. Challenges While the YANMM model offers enticing prospects, it is not without its challenges: 1. Scalability: The overlapping nature of content types and monetization could complicate YANMM's scalability as it grows and expands its user base. 2. Privacy and Data Protection: Personalization requires extensive data collection and analysis, which raises concerns about user privacy and data protection. 3. Regulation: As YANMM operates within the intersections of various content types, it may face regulatory challenges and require compliance with different industry laws. Implications for the Future of Media If YANMM successfully navigates these challenges and grows in prominence, it has the potential to profoundly impact the media landscape. By offering a versatile and user-centric experience, YANMM may emerge as a strong contender among traditional media models. By empowering creators and fostering inclusivity, while marrying innovative ideas with tried-and-tested monetization strategies, YANMM might indeed pave the way for a new era of content consumption and creation. Conclusion As technology and audience preferences continue to evolve, so must the media models that deliver content. Yet Another New Media Model represents an innovative approach that addresses the diverse and ever-changing needs of the contemporary media landscape. While challenges lie ahead, YANMM's potential to reshape the way we create, distribute, and consume media warrants close attention and ongoing evaluation."},{"instruction":"Please answer the following question: Skylar was a baker and had to mix all the ingredients for the recipe.

Patient A maintains a high-fat diet, but patient B does not maintain a high fat diet. Greg is advising the patients how lifestyle change can improve their health.  Which patient would more likely risk cardiovascular disease, patient A or patient B?  Hint: Although some lipids in the diet are essential, excess dietary lipids can be harmful. Because lipids are very high in energy, eating too many may lead to unhealthy weight gain. A high-fat diet may also increase lipid levels in the blood. This, in turn, can increase the risk for health problems such as cardiovascular disease. The dietary lipids of most concern are saturated fatty acids, trans fats, and cholesterol. For example, cholesterol is the lipid mainly responsible for narrowing arteries and causing the disease atherosclerosis.

News article: The coral die-off crisis is a climate crime and Exxon fired the gun Coral reefs are probably Earth’s most life-packed ecosystem; those who’ve had the privilege of diving in the tropics know the reef as an orderly riot of colour and flow, size and shape. Which is why a white, dead reef is so shocking – as shocking in its way as a human corpse lying on the street, which still takes the form of the living breathing person it used to be, but now suddenly is stopped forever, the force that made it real suddenly and grotesquely absent. When a body falls on the street, the police come to investigate. Did this person die of natural causes, or was there foul play involved? When a reef dies, we ask the scientists. And this year they’ve told us the answer in no uncertain terms. The amazingly rapid die-off of a huge percentage of the world’s coral reefs is not a sad but normal tragedy; it’s a crime. Perhaps the fastest, most widespread crime of the global warming era. Related: The Great Barrier Reef: a catastrophe laid bare Vast swaths of coral were bleached this spring, much of the damage done in a matter of weeks as a wave of warm water swept across the Pacific and west into the Indian Ocean. The immediate culprit was clear: the ongoing rise in global ocean temperatures that comes from climate change. But that’s like saying “he was killed by a bullet”. The important question is: who fired the gun? We know the biggest culprits now, because great detective work by investigative journalists has uncovered key facts in the past year. The world’s biggest oil company, Exxon, knew everything there was to know about climate change by the late 1970s and early 1980s. Its scientists understood how much and how fast it was going to warm, and how much damage that was going to do. And the company knew the scientists were right: that’s why they started “climate-proofing” their own installations, for instance building their drilling rigs to accommodate the sea level rise they knew was coming. What they didn’t do was tell the rest of us. Instead, they – and many other players in the fossil fuel industry – bankrolled the rise of the climate denial industry, helping fund the “thinktanks” and front groups that spent the last generation propagating the phoney idea that there was a deep debate about the reality of global warming. As a result, we’ve wasted a quarter century in a phoney argument about whether the climate was changing. Had Exxon and its ilk merely told the truth, that argument would have been over: no one would have accused them of being “climate alarmists”. We would have gone to work to solve the problem. Our work wouldn’t be over by now, but it would be well advanced; the atmospheric level of CO2 wouldn’t have topped 400 parts per million, and the temperature rise wouldn’t be flirting with 1.5C. There would be coral bleaching, but there likely wouldn’t be a coral massacre on the scale we’ve seen this year. Which means that the victims should be angry as well as sad. The people who depend on the reefs for food, and for shelter from the waves; the economies that count on tourist dollars; the people who take spiritual sustenance from the ongoing drama beneath the waves. The reefs can’t be made whole again: if they recover at all it will be slowly, and in the face of ongoing warming that seems unlikely. But at the very least, the nations that sustained this damage should be compensated. Exxon and its brethren made record profits in the last decades of denial and deceit; that money should rightfully go to pay for the damage it caused, and to build the energy systems that can power our lives without destruction. We need to remember that there’s nothing natural about this horror. It was caused, as so many crimes are, by greed. And that greed is ongoing – Exxon continues to search for more hydrocarbons, and to reject even modest changes to its policies. That’s why we’re wrapping crime scene tape this week around those bleached coral heads, those dead staghorns. That’s why we’re taking crime scene photos with underwater cameras. That’s why we’re protesting on the reefs. We’re not going to let them get away with murder. What are the most important parts of this news article?","output":"1. The rapid die-off of a large percentage of the world's coral reefs is attributed to climate change, specifically the ongoing rise in global ocean temperatures. This crisis is being referred to as a crime. 2. Investigative journalists have discovered that Exxon, the world's largest oil company, knew about climate change and its impacts from the late 1970s and early 1980s but failed to disclose this information. 3. Instead, Exxon and other fossil fuel companies funded the rise of climate denial, contributing to a 25-year delay in acting on climate change. 4. The delayed action has led to severe consequences, including the extensive damage to coral reefs and their ecosystem. 5. The author calls for compensation from Exxon and similar companies to nations affected by the damage, as well as for a shift towards clean energy systems. 6. Protests and demonstrations are being staged to hold these companies accountable for the damage they caused to the environment due to their actions and greed."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant that follows instruction extremely well.

The claim: The EU referendum is a big risk to UK and global markets. Reality Check verdict: There is considerable uncertainty about any predictions about what would happen to the economy, but the Bank of England's warning that leaving would be bad for it are in line with mainstream economic thinking. In the minutes from its latest meeting, the MPC warned the pound \\"would fall further, perhaps sharply\\" if there was a Brexit. Currencies generally get stronger or weaker based on what the markets think about how strong economies are. A weaker pound would make imported goods more expensive in the UK, which would cause inflation, and it would make holidays in Europe more expensive. But it would make products and services provided in the UK cheaper to customers overseas, which would be good news for exporters. The MPC said leaving the EU would worsen the terms of trade, reduce productivity and increase the level of risk associated with the economy. It also warned of the danger posed to the global economy, saying that the referendum campaign had dampened sentiment in traders around the world. \\"The outcome of the referendum continues to be the largest immediate risk facing UK financial markets, and possibly also global financial markets,\\" it said. The warnings followed a robust response from Bank of England governor Mark Carney to a letter from Vote Leave campaigner Bernard Jenkin MP, who had reminded him of rules preventing publicly funded bodies making statements in the month leading up to the referendum that might influence it. Mr Carney stressed that the warnings were part of the normal job of the MPC to provide an assessment of the state of the economy and risks facing it.

Enraged by this, Aalavandhan barges into the newspaper office and shouts at Renuka. The audio recording of her interview disappears (courtesy Aalavandhan), and she is fired from her job for falsified reporting. Ashwin later risks his life to capture the pictures of Aalavandhan who actually engages in child marriage in a temple at midnight.

Thor Heyerdahl (Norwegian pronunciation: [tu:r 'haei@da:l]; October 6, 1914 - April 18, 2002) was a Norwegian adventurer and ethnographer with a background in zoology, botany, and geography. He became notable for his Kon-Tiki expedition in 1947, in which he sailed 8,000 km (5,000 mi) across the Pacific Ocean in a hand-built raft from South America to the Tuamotu Islands. The expedition was designed to demonstrate that ancient people could have made long sea voyages, creating contacts between separate cultures. This was linked to a diffusionist model of cultural development. In 1955-1956, Heyerdahl organized the Norwegian Archaeological Expedition to Rapa Nui (Easter Island). The expedition's scientific staff included Arne Skjolsvold, Carlyle Smith, Edwin Ferdon, Gonzalo Figueroa and William Mulloy. Heyerdahl and the professional archaeologists who travelled with him spent several months on Rapa Nui investigating several important archaeological sites. Highlights of the project include experiments in the carving, transport and erection of the notable moai, as well as excavations at such prominent sites as Orongo and Poike. The expedition published two large volumes of scientific reports (Reports of the Norwegian Archaeological Expedition to Easter Island and the East Pacific) and Heyerdahl later added a third (The Art of Easter Island). Heyerdahl's popular book on the subject, Aku-Aku was another international best-seller.  In Easter Island: The Mystery Solved (Random House, 1989), Heyerdahl offered a more detailed theory of the island's history. Based on native testimony and archaeological research, he claimed the island was originally colonized by Hanau eepe (\\"Long Ears\\"), from South America, and that Polynesian Hanau momoko (\\"Short Ears\\") arrived only in the mid-16th century; they may have come independently or perhaps were imported as workers. According to Heyerdahl, something happened between Admiral Roggeveen's discovery of the island in 1722 and James Cook's visit in 1774; while Roggeveen encountered white, Indian, and Polynesian people living in relative harmony and prosperity, Cook encountered a much smaller population consisting mainly of Polynesians and living in privation.  Heyerdahl notes the oral tradition of an uprising of \\"Short Ears\\" against the ruling \\"Long Ears\\". The \\"Long Ears\\" dug a defensive moat on the eastern end of the island and filled it with kindling. During the uprising, Heyerdahl claimed, the \\"Long Ears\\" ignited their moat and retreated behind it, but the \\"Short Ears\\" found a way around it, came up from behind, and pushed all but two of the \\"Long Ears\\" into the fire. This moat was found by the Norwegian expedition and it was partly cut down into the rock. Layers of fire were revealed but no fragments of bodies.  As for the origin of the people of Easter Island, DNA tests have shown a connection to South America, critics conjecture that this was a result of recent events, but whether this is inherited from a person coming in later times is hard to know. If the story that (almost) all Long Ears were killed in a civil war is true, as the islanders story goes, it would be expected that the statue-building South American bloodline would have been nearly utterly destroyed, leaving for the most part the invading Polynesian bloodline. Answer this question using a quote from the following article: How many people went along?","output":"The text does not provide a specific quote that directly answers the question \\"How many people went along?\\" There are mentions of multiple individuals who accompanied Thor Heyerdahl in his expeditions, such as Arne Skjolsvold, Carlyle Smith, Edwin Ferdon, Gonzalo Figueroa and William Mulloy for the Easter Island expedition, but it does not provide a distinct number.

Just last Tuesday, just days before BHS collapsed, he transferred £1.5m from the struggling company to a Swedish firm owned by a friend and fellow board member. The BHS CEO ordered its repayment which when it came was £50,000 short. The good news for BHS and its 11,000 employees is that his is one of the more unlikely bids in a competitive field of over 50 expressions of interest for some or all of the business.

Think like you are answering to a five year old. Solve 18*z = 193*z + 1575 for z.. What is the answer??","output":"Alright! Let's break this down step by step. We have an equation: 18 * z = 193 * z + 1575.  The goal is to find what number z should be to make this equation true. First, we'll subtract 193*z from both sides of the equation. This will help us get all the z terms on one side of the equation: (18 * z) - (193 * z) = (193 * z) - (193 * z) + 1575. Now we have: -175 * z = 1575. See how we grouped all the z terms together? That's going to help us find the answer. Next, we're going to divide both sides of the equation by -175 to find the value of z: (-175 * z) / -175 = 1575 / -175. This simplifies the equation to: z = -9. So there you have it, the answer is: z = -9. Good job!"},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant. You should describe the task and explain your answer.

Please answer the following question: Information:  - The San Diego Museum of Art is a fine arts museum located at 1450 El Prado in Balboa Park in San Diego, California that houses a broad collection with particular strength in Spanish art. The San Diego Museum of Art opened as The Fine Arts Gallery of San Diego on February 28, 1926, and changed its name to the San Diego Museum of Art in 1978. The official Balboa Park website calls the San Diego Museum of Art \\"the region's oldest and largest art museum\\". Nearly half a million people visit the museum each year.  - The Young Shepherdess is an 1885 painting by William - Adolphe Bouguereau ( 1825 -- 1905 ) . It is owned by the San Diego Museum of Art. This and similar images by the artist attracted collectors in Europe and America because of their nostalgic content . In such works the artist depicted a variety of poses and expressions , in this case showing the mild curiosity of the girl . In portraying a shepherdess Bouguereau is working within the pastoral mode or theme , as developed by ancient Greek and Hellenistic artists and poets . French painters who preceded him in this include Claude Lorrain , Poussin , and Watteau .  - William-Adolphe Bouguereau (November 30, 1825  August 19, 1905) was a French academic painter and traditionalist. In his realistic genre paintings he used mythological themes, making modern interpretations of classical subjects, with an emphasis on the female human body. During his life he enjoyed significant popularity in France and the United States, was given numerous official honors, and received top prices for his work. As the quintessential salon painter of his generation, he was reviled by the Impressionist avant-garde. By the early twentieth century, Bouguereau and his art fell out of favor with the public, due in part to changing tastes. In the 1980s, a revival of interest in figure painting led to a rediscovery of Bouguereau and his work. Throughout the course of his life, Bouguereau executed 822 known finished paintings, although the whereabouts of many are still unknown.  - San Diego (Spanish for \\"Saint Didacus\\") is a major city in California, United States. It is in San Diego County, on the coast of the Pacific Ocean in Southern California, approximately south of Los Angeles and immediately adjacent to the border with Mexico.    What is the relationship between 'the young shepherdess' and 'france'? Answer:","output":"The relationship between \\"The Young Shepherdess\\" and France stems from the fact that the painting was created by a French artist, William-Adolphe Bouguereau, who was active during the 19th century. Born on November 30, 1825, Bouguereau was a renowned academic painter and traditionalist in France and played an influential role in shaping French art during his time. In his paintings, he often depicted realistic genre scenes, with a particular emphasis on mythological themes and the female human body. \\"The Young Shepherdess,\\" painted in 1885, is an excellent example of Bouguereau's skill in capturing the beauty and innocence of his subjects. The painting portrays a young shepherdess with a gentle expression of curiosity, which exemplifies Bouguereau's ability to represent a variety of poses and emotions in his work. This image and other similar works by Bouguereau attracted collectors in Europe and America due to their nostalgic content. In creating \\"The Young Shepherdess,\\" Bouguereau drew inspiration from the pastoral mode or theme, which can be traced back to ancient Greek and Hellenistic artists and poets. He also followed in the footsteps of earlier French painters such as Claude Lorrain, Poussin, and Watteau, who had explored this theme in their own work. As a result, \\"The Young Shepherdess\\" not only highlights the artistic prowess of William-Adolphe Bouguereau but also reflects an important aspect of French art history and tradition. In summary, the relationship between \\"The Young Shepherdess\\" and France lies in its creation by a notable French artist, William-Adolphe Bouguereau, who drew upon the country's rich artistic heritage and pastoral themes. The painting stands as a testament to the artist's remarkable talent and serves as a remarkable example of French art from the 19th century."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

This is sometimes referred to as “checking labs,” “doing bloodwork,” or even “checking blood.” Most older adults have been through this. For instance, it’s pretty much impossible to be hospitalized without having bloodwork done, and it’s part of most emergency room care. Such testing is also often done as part of an annual exam, or “complete physical.” Last but not least, blood testing is usually — although not always — very helpful when it comes to evaluating many common complaints that affect aging adults. Fatigued and experiencing low energy? We should perhaps check for anemia and thyroid problems, among other things. Confused and delirious? Bloodwork can help us check on an older person’s electrolytes (they can be thrown off by a medication side-effect, as well as by other causes). Blood tests can also provide us with information related to infection, kidney function, and much more. Like much of medical care, blood testing is probably overused. But often, it’s an appropriate and an important part of evaluating an older person’s health care concerns. So as a geriatrician, I routinely order or recommend blood tests for older adults. Historically, laboratory results were reviewed by the doctors and were only minimally discussed with patients and families. But today, it’s becoming more common for patients to ask questions about their results, and otherwise become more knowledgeable about this aspect of their health. In fact, one of my top recommendations to older adults and family caregivers is to always request a copy of your laboratory results. (And then, keep it in your personal health record!) This way, if you ever have questions about your health, or need to see a different doctor, you’ll be able to quickly access this useful information about yourself.

The film opens with newspaper photojournalist Audrey Aimes (Castle) accidentally stumbling upon a small town in Illinois which has been inexplicably destroyed. All 150 people in the town are missing, and the evidence indicates they are dead. Incredibly, the local fields are also barren, as if a swarm of locusts had eaten all the crops. Aimes suspects that the military is covering something up, and travels to a nearby United States Department of Agriculture experimental farm to learn what creature might have caused the agricultural destruction. She meets Dr. Ed Wainwright (Graves), who is experimenting with radiation as a means of growing gigantic fruits and vegetables to end world hunger. Dr. Wainwright reports that there have been a number of mysterious incidents nearby, and that locusts have eaten all the radioactive wheat stored in a nearby grain silo.Gigantic mutant locusts rampage over the countryside. Dr. Wainwright and Ms. Aimes begin to track down the source of the mysterious occurrences, and quickly discover that the locusts which ate the grain have grown to the size of a city bus. The monsters have eaten all the crops in the area, and now are seeking human beings as a means of sustenance. It is also clear that they are headed for the city of Chicago. Wainwright and Aimes meet with General Hanson (Ankrum), Colonel Sturgeon (Henry), and Captain Barton (Seay) to strategize a solution. Machine gun and artillery fire seem ineffective against the creatures, and there are far too many to effectively deal with all at once. The United States Army and Illinois National Guard are called upon to help protect the city. But the monsters quickly invade Chicago, and began to feast on human flesh as well as several buildings.General Hanson concludes that the only way to destroy the beasts en masse is to use a nuclear weapon and destroy Chicago. However, Dr. Wainwright realizes that the locusts are warm-weather creatures. He concludes that he might be able to lure the locusts into Lake Michigan. There, the cold water will incapacitate them, and they will drown. The lure itself will be a decoy locust mating call, generated electronically with test-tone oscillators. The plan is put into effect, and it works at the last possible moment. The monstrous locusts drown, but Dr. Wainwright and Ms. Aimes wonder if other insects or animals might have eaten other radioactive crops. They ponder whether the whole world might be facing an attack of monstrous creatures.","output":"Question: What is Audrey Aimes' profession?

His mother Hannah Vaughan told the inquest Harley had loved throwing stones in the water. A verdict of accidental death was recorded at the hearing in Salisbury. He had been feeding a horse in a field at the stables in Gastard, near Corsham, when he disappeared on the morning of 28 July. Ms Vaughan said she had given him some feed to take to the horse in the field and \\"that was the last time I saw him alive\\". She said she never saw Harley open the gate to the pond but started calling and looking around for him before finding him in the pond. Neighbour Jennifer Gibson, a midwife, heard her cries for help and rushed to her aid. She told Ms Vaughan to go to her house and ring for an ambulance while she began resuscitation. Harley was taken to the Royal United Hospital in Bath, where he was later pronounced dead by doctors. A post-mortem examination found Harley died from freshwater drowning.

It was the subject of some meetings with ubuntu-women, something I have discussed with my friend Sulamita in a Brazilian bar at 4.30am and the subject of various ad-hoc discussions at the Ubuntu Developer Summit. As the wider Open Source community grows, it becomes more of an issue every day, and something we all need to be aware of. While in Brazil I made a promise to Sulamita that I would be blogging about the issue of discrimination against women, and I have been holding off writing an entry until I had some real, practical, implementable steps that I can advise people to take to help make the situation better. Although I will never fully understand how some women are made to feel at the hands of such discrimination, I have been hoping my contribution could be to help contribute to an awareness of the issue, and for that to happen I felt I needed to construct some doable steps that people can execute. Solving social problems is hard though, which ain’t all that surprising, so I had held off on a blog post until I had some such action points. I have since discovered that there is really one key step that we all need take – don’t accept or allow discrimination in your community. In my mind all discrimination is bad. Every day people get up and are discriminated due to gender, age, race, mobility, technical knowledge and more. The issues of discrimination, while different in the specifics (e.g. women are discriminated in different ways to age discrimination), the underlying issue is very similar – mistreating people because of a grouping they are part of. We have all suffered this in different ways, from serious racial hatred to someone not taking you seriously because you have long hair and an Iron Maiden t-shirt.

Question: \\"What connects the adenine-thymine pairs?\\"  Context: \\"Two chains of DNA twist around each other to form a DNA double helix with the phosphate-sugar backbone spiralling around the outside, and the bases pointing inwards with adenine base pairing to thymine and guanine to cytosine. The specificity of base pairing occurs because adenine and thymine align form two hydrogen bonds, whereas cytosine and guanine form three hydrogen bonds. The two strands in a double helix must therefore be complementary, with their sequence of bases matching such that the adenines of one strand are paired with the thymines of the other strand, and so on.:4.1\\"  Answer:","output":"The adenine-thymine pairs in a DNA double helix are connected by hydrogen bonds. In the context provided, the DNA double helix consists of two chains that twist around each other with the phosphate-sugar backbone spiralling around the outside and the bases pointing inwards. Adenine base pairs with thymine, and guanine pairs with cytosine. The specificity of these base pairings occurs due to the interactions between the atoms in the purine and pyrimidine nucleobases. In the case of the adenine-thymine (A-T) pairs, two hydrogen bonds are responsible for holding the two nucleotide bases together. In their molecular structure, adenine has an amino group and a ring nitrogen atom capable of forming hydrogen bonds, while thymine has two carbonyl oxygen atoms that can act as hydrogen bond acceptors. The arrangement of these atoms in the two bases allows for the formation of two hydrogen bonds between them, contributing to the stability of the DNA double helix. The hydrogen bonds between adenine and thymine are relatively weak compared to covalent bonds, but they provide enough strength to hold the two strands of DNA together. These hydrogen bonds can be broken and reformed during processes such as DNA replication, transcription, and repair, which require the separation of the two strands. On the other hand, cytosine-guanine (C-G) pairs form three hydrogen bonds, which makes their pairing stronger than that of adenine-thymine pairs. The presence of both A-T and C-G pairs in a DNA molecule contributes to the overall stability of the double helix and maintains the proper spacing between its two strands. The two strands in a DNA double helix must be complementary to each other, meaning the sequence of bases on one strand matches the opposing strand in a way that adenines pair with thymines and guanines pair with cytosines. This complementary base pairing is a fundamental feature of DNA's structure and function, as it allows accurate replication and transmission of genetic information during cell division and gene expression. In conclusion, the adenine-thymine pairs in a DNA double helix are connected by two hydrogen bonds. These bonds contribute to the specificity of base pairing, stabilize the double helix structure, and maintain the complementary nature of the two DNA strands. The hydrogen bonding between adenine and thymine, along with the bonding between cytosine and guanine, is a critical component of the DNA molecule's structure and its ability to store, replicate, and transmit genetic information."},{"instruction":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

William John Evans ( , August 16, 1929 - September 15, 1980) was an American jazz pianist and composer who mostly worked in a trio setting. Evans' use of impressionist harmony, inventive interpretation of traditional jazz repertoire, block chords, and trademark rhythmically independent, \\"singing\\" melodic lines continue to influence jazz pianists today. Born in Plainfield, New Jersey, in 1929, he was classically trained, and studied at Southeastern Louisiana University and the Mannes School of Music, where he majored in composition and received the Artist Diploma. In 1955, he moved to New York City, where he worked with bandleader and theorist George Russell. In July 1955, Evans returned to New York City and enrolled in the Mannes College of Music for a three-semester postgraduate course in musical composition. He also wrote classical settings of poems by William Blake. Along with his studies, Evans played in mostly low-profile \\"Tuxedo gigs\\" at the Friendship Club and the Roseland Ballroom, as well as Jewish weddings, intermission spots, and over-40 dances. However, better opportunities also arose, such as playing solo opposite the Modern Jazz Quartet at the Village Vanguard, where one day he saw Miles Davis listening to him. During this period, Evans also met Thelonious Monk.  Evans soon began to perform in Greenwich Village clubs with Don Elliott, Tony Scott, and Mundell Lowe; as well as with bandleader Jerry Wald. While Evans may have played on some of Wald's discs, his first proven Wald recording was Listen to the Music of Jerry Wald, which also featured his future drummer Paul Motian.  In early 1955, singer Lucy Reed moved to New York City to play at the Village Vanguard and The Blue Angel, and in August she recorded The Singing Reed with a group which included Evans. During this period, he met two of Reed's friends: manager Helen Keane, who, seven years later, would become his own agent; and George Russell, with whom he would soon work. That year, he also made his first recording, in a small ensemble, in Dick Garcia's A Message from Garcia. In parallel, Evans kept with his work with Scott, playing in Preview's Modern Jazz Club in Chicago during December-January 1956/7, and recording The Complete Tony Scott. After the Complete sessions, Scott left for a long overseas tour.

They are tetrapods, but the snakes and a few species of lizard either have no limbs or their limbs are much reduced in size. Their bones are better ossified and their skeletons stronger than those of amphibians. The teeth are conical and mostly uniform in size. The surface cells of the epidermis are modified into horny scales which create a waterproof layer. Reptiles are unable to use their skin for respiration as do amphibians and have a more efficient respiratory system drawing air into their lungs by expanding their chest walls. The heart resembles that of the amphibian but there is a septum which more completely separates the oxygenated and deoxygenated bloodstreams. The reproductive system has evolved for internal fertilization, with a copulatory organ present in most species. The eggs are surrounded by amniotic membranes which prevents them from drying out and are laid on land, or develop internally in some species. The bladder is small as nitrogenous waste is excreted as uric acid.Turtles are notable for their protective shells. They have an inflexible trunk encased in a horny carapace above and a plastron below. These are formed from bony plates embedded in the dermis which are overlain by horny ones and are partially fused with the ribs and spine. The neck is long and flexible and the head and the legs can be drawn back inside the shell. Turtles are vegetarians and the typical reptile teeth have been replaced by sharp, horny plates. In aquatic species, the front legs are modified into flippers.Tuataras superficially resemble lizards but the lineages diverged in the Triassic period. There is one living species, Sphenodon punctatus. The skull has two openings (fenestrae) on either side and the jaw is rigidly attached to the skull. There is one row of teeth in the lower jaw and this fits between the two rows in the upper jaw when the animal chews. The teeth are merely projections of bony material from the jaw...

A flashback shifts to his boxing career in 1941 against his opponent, Jimmy Reeves, in the infamous Cleveland bout. Losing the fight by a fixed result causes a fight to break out at the end of the match. Jake's brother Joey LaMotta (Joe Pesci) is not only a sparring partner to him but also responsible for organizing his fights.Joey discusses a potential shot for the title with one of his mob connections, Salvy Batts (Frank Vincent), on the way to his brother's house in their neighborhood in the Bronx. When they are finally settled in the house, Jake admits that he does not have much faith in his own abilities. Accompanied by his brother to the local open-air swimming pool, a restless Jake spots a 15-year-old girl named Vickie (Cathy Moriarty) at the edge of the pool. Although he has to be reminded by his brother he is already married, the opportunity to invite her out for the day very soon comes true when Joey gives in.Jake has two fights with Sugar Ray Robinson, set two years apart, and Jake loses the second when the judges rule in favor of Sugar Ray because he was leaving the sport temporarily for conscription in the United States Army. This does not deter Jake from winning six straight fights, but as his fears grow about his wife, Vickie, having feelings for other men, particularly Tony Janiro, the opponent for his forthcoming fight, he is keen enough to show off his sexual jealously when he beats him in front of the local Mob boss, Tommy Como (Nicholas Colosanto) and Vickie.The recent triumph over Janiro is touted as a major boost for the belt as Joey discusses this with journalists, though Joey is briefly distracted by seeing Vickie approach a table with Salvy and his crew.

You will be given a task. You must generate a detailed and long answer. Answer this: What is the outermost structure in a plant cell?","output":"The outermost structure in a plant cell is known as the cell wall, which plays a vital role in maintaining the shape and rigidity of the cell. The cell wall is a protective layer composed primarily of carbohydrates, mainly cellulose, hemicellulose, and pectin. It forms a network of complex structural fibrous materials that helps the cell maintain its shape, provide mechanical strength, and protect the cell from damage, pathogens, and environmental stressors. The cell wall also plays a crucial role in cell growth, communication, and various physiological processes. Composition of the cell wall: 1. Cellulose: Cellulose is the primary component of the plant cell wall. It is a linear polymer that consists of thousands of glucose molecules linked together by β-1,4 glycosidic bonds forming a cellulose microfibril. These microfibrils are bundled together to form larger structures called cellulose fibers. This structural arrangement provides the cell wall with tensile strength and rigidity. 2. Hemicellulose: Hemicellulose is a heterogeneous group of polysaccharides that cross-link cellulose microfibrils within the cell wall, helping to maintain their structure. They are composed of various sugar units such as xylose, mannose, galactose, and glucose, forming a branched structure. Hemicellulose interactions with cellulose fibers contribute to the cell wall's mechanical properties. 3. Pectin: Pectins are a group of complex polysaccharides found in the cell wall, primarily composed of galacturonic acid and other sugar units, which form a gel-like matrix. Pectins contribute to the cell wall's porosity, hydration, and flexibility by forming hydrogen bonds with cellulose and hemicellulose. They play a significant role in cell adhesion and plant growth, as well as in the defense against pathogens. 4. Proteins: Various proteins are embedded within the plant cell wall. These proteins serve multiple functions, such as structural reinforcement, enzymatic activities, communication pathways for signaling molecules, and defense against pathogens. Examples include structural proteins like extensin and hydroxyproline-rich glycoproteins (HRGPs), as well as enzymes like cellulases and pectinases, which help modify the cell wall during plant growth and development. 5. Lignin: Lignin is a complex phenolic polymer that provides additional structural support and rigidity to the cell wall, particularly in specialized structures such as xylem vessels. Lignin also plays a vital role in water and nutrient transport by imparting waterproofing properties to the cell walls, especially in vascular plants. Moreover, it contributes to the plant's defense by forming a physical barrier against pathogens and herbivores. In summary, the outermost structure in a plant cell, the cell wall, is a complex, dynamic, and essential component, crucial for overall plant health, growth, and adaption to environmental conditions. Its primary components, cellulose, hemicellulose, pectin, proteins, and lignin, provide strength, flexibility, structural support, and protection to the cells, enabling plants to thrive and adapt to their surroundings."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

There are subtle differences in meaning, sentence structure, and word choice that distinguish the two statements. Let's break down each sentence to better understand the differences. 1) \\"Michael advises the girls to try their poses in the cold to avoid wasting time on set and get backstage.\\" In this sentence, Michael is suggesting that the girls practice their poses in a cold environment. This recommendation is made with the intention of minimizing time spent on the set, allowing the girls to quickly proceed backstage after posing. Here, the primary concern appears to be efficiency in terms of time management on set. The sentence implies that the girls may be currently in a cold environment and preparing their poses there would save time. 2) \\"Michael advises girls to try their poses in the backstage in order to avoid wasting time on the set and to cold.\\" In this sentence, Michael is recommending that the girls practice their poses backstage instead of on the set. The purpose of this suggestion is to avoid wasting time on the set and to avoid 'cold,' which is used ambiguously and likely needs clarification. The intended meaning could either be 'to avoid feeling cold' or 'to avoid being exposed to cold conditions' while posing on the set. In this case, Michael's focus is not only on time management but also on keeping the girls comfortable and avoiding the cold. To sum up, while both sentences convey similar ideas – Michael advising the girls to practice their poses to save time and avoid discomfort – the nuances and contexts differ. The first sentence emphasizes practicing poses in a cold environment, while the second sentence focuses on practicing backstage to avoid cold conditions. The differences in emphasis and word choices result in the sentences having distinct meanings."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant. User will you give you a task.

Blades doesn't hit the non sequitur heights of Anchorman or Talladega Nights, but the cast is great and several gags hit hard. 2. Silly as a drag queen convention and subtle as an un-flushed toilet, Blades of Glory is everything you'd hope for in a Will Ferrell comedy. 3. With Blades of Glory, Will Ferrell and Jon Heder stake an early claim to being the comedy couple of the year. 4. Ferrell and Heder have yet to prove themselves as great actors, but they are great clowns, working the material for all it's worth. 5. Equal parts inspiration, perspiration and hairspray, Blades of Glory is silly and enjoyable but not as consistently funny as Talladega Nights: The Ballad of Ricky Bobby, Ferrell's last sports spoof. 6. On ice, the movie is often fairly funny. Off it, the garish outfits, the genitalia jokes, the beer-slob gags about gays, the women as cheap laughs, even the cute guest cameos start to shiver and melt. 7. Blades of Glory is a feeble satire that doesn't do much that's incisive or interesting, and the tame PG-13 rating keeps the raunchiness in check. 8. [Will Ferrell's] new film is easily on a par with [his] earlier efforts. 9. Dumb with a capital D, Blades of Glory takes its (almost) fleshed-out sketch-comedy idea as far as an ice-skating buddy movie with we're-not-gay jokes and a psycho stalker can go. 10. If there was an Olympics for purely fun movies, this would skate away with one of those pretty medals. What is the consensus?","output":"The consensus for Blades of Glory is that it is a fun, silly, and enjoyable comedy featuring the talents of Will Ferrell and Jon Heder. While not as consistently funny or reaching the same level of absurdity as some of Ferrell's previous films like Anchorman or Talladega Nights, the cast and several gags manage to hit hard and entertain. The on-ice humor works well, although off-ice elements like crude jokes and stereotypes may not land as effectively. The film's PG-13 rating prevents it from pushing into raunchier territory, and it has been likened to an extended sketch-comedy. Overall, Blades of Glory is a lighthearted sports spoof that offers a good time for fans of Will Ferrell's comedic style, even though it may not be his strongest work."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Think like you are answering to a five year old. It was the worst attack on Kenyan soil since the 1998 US embassy bombing by al-Qaeda - leaving 67 people dead and more than 200 wounded. The military, police and spy agency have been battling to save face over the handling of the rescue operation. Here are five key issues that remain unresolved: Initially, the police and members of the public tried to repel the attack. As hours went by, the government sent in the military. Rivalry between the two forces started when a commander of the police elite squad was killed in friendly fire by the military. The changeover angered the police and they left in protest as the army took control of the building. A military commander involved in the operation, who spoke to the BBC on condition of anonymity, said that is when things started to go wrong. \\"We entered the mall blindly with no guide, with no concept of anything. Command and control was not there,\\" he said. \\"The police felt they were undermined. The military thought the police didn't want to give them enough information so everything went wrong.\\" Interior Minister Joseph Ole Lenku maintains the operation was handled well. \\"I am happy with the way police responded. However, it was necessary for the military to bring protective gear and armoured carriers and their skill. As a country we are happy how they worked together.\\" Somalia's al-Qaeda affiliate, al-Shabab, said it had attacked the mall because Kenya sent troops to Somalia to bolster the UN-backed government. Kenya's military spokesman named four of the gunmen as Abu Baara al-Sudani, Omar Nabhan, Khattab al-Kene and Umayr. \\"I confirm those are the names of the terrorists,\\" Major Emmanuel Chirchir tweeted at the time. All four were said to have crossed over the border from Somalia before the attack. It is thought the names given by the military may be noms de guerre as one of the gunmen was subsequently identified as Hassan Abdi Dhuhulow, a 23-year-old Norwegian citizen of Somali origin. Voices from the mall Recovered remains of the alleged attackers are still undergoing forensic tests by the FBI. Kenya's chief pathologist Johannes Oduor, who was part of the team initially examining them, says he was unable to confirm if the bodies were those of the attackers. \\"I am still waiting for the report,\\" he says. Mr Ole Lenku says the report on forensic analysis samples may be able to answer these questions. \\"Until we get it we can't give any concrete information on their identities to establish their names and nationalities.\\" President Uhuru Kenyatta promised to form a commission of inquiry to investigate the attack and any failings by security agencies. But to date nothing has happened. \\"We did promise, but parliament took up the process and did their best and came up with a report that actually necessitated a number of actions towards improving the country's security,\\" Mr Ole Lenku says. But no-one was sacked or held responsible as a result of the MPs' report, released in March. Security analysts say a public inquiry into Westgate could have been embarrassing. The parliamentary investigation was a way of protecting the military, which had been criticised following allegations that soldiers looted shops in Westgate, they say. The military was accused of looting when CCTV footage emerged showing soldiers carrying bags out of the shopping centre. When merchants returned to Westgate they found most of their shops had been vandalised. Pictures circulating on social media revealed shelves, cash drawers and safes broken into. The government said the soldiers with carrier bags were helping themselves to water from a supermarket to quench their thirst during the operation. In October, two soldiers were named, charged and jailed for the looting. Victor Otieno and Victor Ashihundu were court-martialled but their sentences have not been made public. They were allegedly found in possession of mobile phones, cameras and battery chargers. The government promised to pay compensation to survivors and help settle their medical bills. But those contacted by the BBC say this has not happened. \\"It's been tough because I don't have any income,\\" says Anne Moraa, a manager of a shop selling handbags in Westgate, who was trampled as she tried to escape. She had to pay her own hospital bills. She is continuing to pay for counselling as she is too traumatised to go into any shopping centre. \\"We have been waiting for the government to compensate [us] - I haven't seen anything yet,\\" Ms Moraa says. \\"After Westgate many people went to hospital, the government didn't follow them up. There is no support group for survivors.\\" A military officer injured by a grenade thrown by one of the militants says he is also waiting. The grenade killed two of his colleagues. \\"I have not been compensated. Neither have the families of those soldiers that died in the attack. I have not been told anything. Maybe it's in the process and has not been communicated to us,\\" said the soldier, who is still receiving treatment for his injuries. Mr Ole Lenku told the BBC he could not comment on these cases. \\"I know the concern has been raised but it involves a lot of variables,\\" he said.

In the English language, certain words can have multiple meanings based on the context in which they are used. In this case, the word \\"taste\\" has two different meanings in the given sentences. In the first sentence, \\"She enjoyed her brief taste of independence\\", the word \\"taste\\" refers to a brief experience or sample of something. Here, the term is used metaphorically to describe the woman's enjoyment of a short period of independence. It implies that she had an opportunity to experience a situation or context in which she had more freedom or autonomy than she typically has. The focus of this usage is on the temporary nature of the experience and the pleasure or satisfaction she derived from it. In the second sentence, \\"His cold deprived him of his sense of taste\\", the word \\"taste\\" refers to one of the five primary senses that humans have. Specifically, it pertains to the ability to perceive and differentiate flavors in food and drink. The sense of taste works in conjunction with the sense of smell to help identify and enjoy various taste sensations, such as sweet, sour, bitter, and salty. In this context, the sentence explains that due to the man's cold, he was unable to properly taste the foods he consumed because his sense of taste was temporarily impaired, which is a common symptom of colds and other illnesses that affect the nasal passages and throat.

President Obama’s endorsement of same-sex marriage is energizing Christian conservative support for Mitt Romney in a way that the likely GOP nominee has so far not been able to do on his own, according to religious leaders and activists.      Pastors in Ohio, North Carolina, Florida and other swing states are readying Sunday sermons inveighing against same-sex unions, while activist groups have begun laying plans for social media campaigns, leaflet drives and other get-out-the-vote efforts centered on the same-sex marriage issue. Romney could benefit from a strong turnout among evangelicals and other social conservatives, many of whom remain skeptical of his commitment to their causes.      “So many people were rather lukewarm toward governor Romney and were really looking for some more tangible reasons to support him,” said Phil Burress, president of Citizens for Community Values, who led the ballot drive that banned gay marriage in Ohio in 2004. “Then lo and behold, it just fell out of the sky when Obama came out and endorsed same-sex marriage. . . . We are going to make this our key issue: the attack on marriage.”      The National Organization for Marriage, a leading anti-gay-marriage group, lashed out at Obama after his announcement and promised to campaign against him “ceaselessly” in swing states.      Same-sex marriage has long been a galvanizing political force for core constituencies in both parties, particularly conservative Catholics and evangelical Republicans. But the president’s public embrace of the idea alters the landscape in ways that promise to complicate the political calculus for both sides.      While more than 30 states now ban same-sex marriage and voters in North Carolina on Tuesday approved a constitutional amendment forbidding it, anti-gay-marriage activists acknowledge that public opinion on the issue has shifted dramatically since 2004, when ballot measures in Ohio and 10 other states helped drive social conservatives to the polls in support of George W. Bush.      Romney and other establishment Republicans have treaded softly on the issue so far, but many evangelicals think that a forceful anti-gay-marriage campaign could pay huge dividends for Republicans in the fall.      Some on the religious right also remain deeply uncertain about Romney’s convictions on cultural issues and are unhappy with his statements in recent days that he supports allowing gay couples to adopt children and that he does not view same-sex marriage as a religious issue. Many activists say they will continue to push Romney on the issue.      “Romney says he is for traditional marriage and then immediately says he is fine with homosexuals adopting children,” said David Lane, who organizes conservative pastors and congregations nationwide and helped lead anti-gay-marriage efforts in Iowa, California and other states. “Our base does not react well to that. They are not going to turn out [for a candidate] who tries to triangulate” on topics such as marriage and other traditional values.      The sentiments underscore the continued difficulties that Romney faces in attempting to navigate thorny cultural issues while attempting to woo independent voters with an economic message. Romney is slated to appear Saturday at Liberty University, an evangelical bastion in Lynchburg, Va., where he will deliver a commencement address. Romney says he is opposed to same-sex marriage and civil unions and favors a constitutional amendment banning gay marriages nationwide. But the former Massachusetts governor has also said that the “tender and sensitive” issue will not be a central part of his campaign.      Justin Peery, 27, a Virginia filmmaker who will attend Romney’s speech at Liberty, said he plans to vote for Romney this fall but is not passionate about his candidacy. That could change, he said, if Romney firmly denounced Obama’s endorsement of same-sex marriage.      “I don’t think it’s by coincidence that Obama came out in favor of gay marriage days before Romney will speak to a crowd of evangelicals,” Peery said. “If he talks about his opposition in a very clear way, he’ll probably get many, many standing ovations.”      Same-sex marriage does not appear to be the galvanizing force it once was, particularly among younger voters. A poll last year by the Public Religion Research Institute found that 44 percent of young white evangelicals favor allowing gay and lesbian people to marry, compared with 12 percent of evangelical seniors and 19 percent of evangelicals overall.      Some conservatives hope the issue drives a wedge between black voters, who largely oppose same-sex marriage, and the president. The Rev. John Coats II, who leads an African American church in Columbus, Ohio, said his Facebook page erupted on Wednesday with critical comments about the president from people who had previously defended him. He is already preparing to preach on Sunday posing the question: Why doesn’t the black community produce politicians who reflect the community’s values?      “I’m not saying they will be pushed to the point to vote for Romney,” Coats said of black voters. “But I believe it will increase voter apathy, and I have to say I’m surprised, and somewhat delightfully, that people are taking a closer look at this president who would never do that before.”      In Ohio, Burress said his group plans to re-create many of the tactics used in 2004 to spur social conservatives to the polls, including organizing rallies and meetings and placing tens of thousands of fliers in church bulletins across the state. The group will also renew its alliance with Amish voters there, who turned out in record numbers for the 2004 ballot measure, Burress said.      Aggressive use of Facebook, text messaging and other social media technologies will help amplify the message, he and others said.      “This could really be a difference-maker,” said J.C. Church, pastor of the 600-member Victory in Truth Ministries congregation in Bucyrus, Ohio, north of Columbus. “People will get fired up on this issue. North Carolina is an indication — this will awaken the conservative evangelicals to become aware, and the result will be action.”      But Robert Bennett, chairman of the Ohio Republican Party, said changing demographics and the struggling economy mean that same-sex marriage may not prove as central as it was eight years ago in the state. While he supports Romney’s position on the issue, he said the GOP presidential candidate would do best to focus on jobs and other economic issues.      “In Ohio, there are people on both sides of the issue who have largely made up their minds,” Bennett said. “Obviously it’s going to unite the social conservatives who maybe had some doubts about Romney, but there are other issues to unite people. This is more of a sidebar issue now.”      Staff writers Tom Hamburger in Washington and Krissah Thompson in Lynchburg, Va., contributed to this report. ||||| President Barack Obama has seen an uptick in fundraising since he announced his shift on gay marriage, with some Democratic rainmakers citing renewed interest from gay and lesbian donors who had been urging the president to clarify his stance on the divisive social issue.

(Associated Press)      \\"The phone calls went on until one in the morning after the president spoke _ people calling saying \`Where do I go, what can I do to help, what events are coming up,'\\" said Robert Zimmerman, a Long Island, N.Y., Obama bundler. \\"People I've been seeking out for campaign support for months have been calling me saying, \`I'm ready to give.'\\"      Obama's campaign has declined to say how much it has collected since the announcement but some staffers have asked supporters to give money as a way of expressing their approval. Following the Obama interview with ABC News, Rufus Gifford, Obama's national finance director, said in a posting to the campaign website that \\"if you're proud of our president, this is a great time to make a donation to the campaign.\\"      Chad Griffin, an Obama bundler and incoming president of the gay advocacy group Human Rights Campaign, said most prominent gay donors had been supporting Obama all along despite his reluctance to champion gay marriage. Most had already given the maximum contribution to his campaign, Griffin said. But he said Obama's announcement had boosted enthusiasm among many gay donors.      \\"There was a tad bit of uncomfortableness because of his position on marriage, even though most people saw where he was headed,\\" Griffin said. \\"The thing he did (Wednesday) cleared any uncomfortableness anyone had.\\"      Obama said Wednesday he supported gay marriage, marking a shift in his personal view on the issue after once opposing it and saying more recently that his views were \\"evolving.\\"      Even before the gay marriage news, Obama has long stressed his commitment to gay rights. The president repealed the military's 18-year-old ban on openly gay service members, called \\"Don't Ask, Don't Tell,\\" and instructed the Justice Department last year to stop enforcing the Defense of Marriage Act, which denies federal recognition of same-sex marriages.      Some gay rights advocates have pressed Obama to sign an executive order barring discrimination against gays and lesbians who work for companies with federal contracts.      Obama was attending a New York fundraiser Monday with gay and lesbian donors hosted by singer Ricky Martin, his first fundraising event with gay supporters since his announcement. The president is scheduled to attend a major fundraiser with gay supporters in Los Angeles on June 6, with tickets priced as high as 25,000 per couple. Griffin, who is co-hosting the event, said he was confident it would sell out.      At least one leading gay activist has said he will attend the June 6 event after pledging to withhold support for Obama if the president did not embrace gay marriage.      Lance Black, and Academy Award-winning screenwriter based in Los Angeles, penned a column in the Hollywood Reporter last month saying he would not contribute to or vote for Obama and urged other gay activists to withhold support as well. Obama's statement Wednesday changed his mind, Black said.      Now I can do all I can to help him financially. I am going to go big, and I'm not alone there,\\" Black said. \\"He blew me away (Wednesday). I walked around for the first time in three years thinking, \`Yes we can.'\\"      ___      Thomas reported from Washington. ||||| Write a summary.","output":"President Obama's endorsement of same-sex marriage has generated support among Christian conservative leaders and activists for Mitt Romney, the likely GOP nominee. Many religious leaders, particularly those in swing states, are preparing sermons and get-out-the-vote efforts focused on opposing same-sex marriage. While Romney faces difficulties in navigating cultural issues and appealing to independent voters, his stance on traditional marriage could help improve turnout among evangelicals and other social conservatives. However, the landscape has changed since 2004, with public opinion shifting on the issue of same-sex marriage. Despite the challenges, a forceful stance against same-sex marriage could potentially benefit Republicans in the upcoming elections and strengthen evangelicals' support for Romney."},{"instruction":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

I don't wanna feed 3 dogs at once  How would the sentiment of this tweet be described?","output":"The sentiment of the tweet \\"I don't wanna feed 3 dogs at once\\" can be described as negative, expressing reluctance or dissatisfaction with a specific situation. In this case, the task of feeding three dogs simultaneously seems to be perceived as a burden or challenge by the author of the tweet. However, there is no clear indication of the exact cause of the negative sentiment, such as whether it is the complexity of the task, the frustration with the dogs themselves, or a general feeling of not wanting to do this job at this particular moment. To better understand the negative sentiment, it is important to consider some key elements in the message: 1. The use of contractions: The author has shortened \\"do not\\" to \\"don't\\" and \\"want to\\" to \\"wanna.\\" This informal language may signify a casual or conversational tone, further emphasizing the feelings of discontent or reluctance. 2. The number \\"3\\": By specifying that there are three dogs, the author suggests that the task may be more difficult than feeding a single dog, which could contribute to the negative sentiment. 3. The action \\"feeding\\": Feeding can be a routine chore for pet owners, but it may also be seen as tedious or time-consuming. In this context, the author's dissatisfaction or disinterest in performing that task is highlighted. 4. The word \\"at once\\": This phrase emphasizes the idea that the task of feeding the three dogs has to be carried out simultaneously, which could imply a sense of urgency or an additional level of complexity. In conclusion, the sentiment of the tweet can be described as negative, indicating the author's dissatisfaction or reluctance to feed three dogs at once. While it may be rooted in the perceived challenge or inconvenience of the task, the casual tone and informal language add to the overall sense of frustration or unwillingness to complete it."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Much of his music, including operas, masses, and other large-scale vocal works, is lost. His reputation today rests on a set of programmatic keyboard sonatas published in 1700, in which each sonata depicted in detail a particular story from the Bible. After his death, Kuhnau was succeeded as \\"Thomaskantor\\" by Johann Sebastian Bach.  - Der beglückte Florindo ( HWV 3 ) is an opera composed by Handel at the request of Reinhard Keiser , the manager of the Hamburg Opera . It was first performed ( after Handel had left for Italy ) at the Theater am Gänsemarkt in January 1708 . It was probably directed from the harpsichord by Christoph Graupner . The opera was the first part of a double opera , with the second part , Die verwandelte Daphne , intended to be performed on the following evening . Keiser inserted a play in low German , called die lustige Hochzeit , into the opera , afraid that the audience would get tired otherwise . Handel was not pleased , according to Romain Rolland . Only fragments of the score survive , but a copy of the libretto exists in the Library of Congress . The libretto was by Hinrich Hinsch , a lawyer , who also wrote the text for Keiser 's first opera in Hamburg : Mahumet II ( 1696 ) , based on the life of Mehmet II. Hinsch had been writing librettos since 1681 . He died in 1712 .  - Georg Philipp Telemann ( 25 June 1767) was a German Baroque composer and multi-instrumentalist. Almost completely self-taught in music, he became a composer against his family's wishes. After studying in Magdeburg, Zellerfeld, and Hildesheim, Telemann entered the University of Leipzig to study law, but eventually settled on a career in music. He held important positions in Leipzig, Sorau, Eisenach, and Frankfurt before settling in Hamburg in 1721, where he became musical director of the city's five main churches. While Telemann's career prospered, his personal life was always troubled: his first wife died only a few months after their marriage, and his second wife had extramarital affairs and accumulated a large gambling debt before leaving Telemann.  - Reinhard Keiser (9 January 167412 September 1739) was a popular German opera composer based in Hamburg. He wrote over a hundred operas. Johann Adolf Scheibe (writing in 1745) considered him an equal to Johann Kuhnau, George Frideric Handel and Georg Philipp Telemann (also associated with the Oper am Gänsemarkt), but his work was largely forgotten for many decades.  - Christoph Graupner (13 January 1683 in Kirchberg  10 May 1760 in Darmstadt) was a German harpsichordist and composer of high Baroque music who was a contemporary of Johann Sebastian Bach, Georg Philipp Telemann and George Frideric Handel.  - Johann Sebastian Bach (28 July 1750) was a German composer and musician of the Baroque period. He enriched established German styles through his skill in counterpoint, harmonic and motivic organisation, and the adaptation of rhythms, forms, and textures from abroad, particularly from Italy and France. Bach's compositions include the \\"Brandenburg Concertos\\", the \\"Goldberg Variations\\", the Mass in B minor, two Passions, and over three hundred cantatas of which around two hundred survive.

Article: I was an only child up until the age of eight.Every time I saw other girls playing or sharing their secrets with their sisters or brothers,I would feel sad for myself .At Christmas I found out that I was soon to be a big sister.I had no idea how I would deal with a baby in our house.The little experience I had with kids taught me that I didn't really like them.They were always making trouble.  My parents set off to the hospital one evening and planned to have the rest of my family and I come to the hospital later .To this day, I don't think I have gone through a more nerve-wracking  experience than sitting in the hospital's waiting room.I was sleepless all night .When I was finally allowed to see my new baby sister , I was so scared.I reached out and when I got a hold of her,I fell in love with her. For the first time,holding my sister had an effect on whom I want to be and because of her,rather than my parents' frequent requests.I have set out goals to improve my future.I want to be her role model,someone she can respect.The past two years has seemed to go by very fast.I've watched her grow older;I have seen her learn to walk and learn to talk.The fear that she held over me seems so small now.

Think like you are answering to a five year old. In one sentence, describe what the following article is about: Babies naturally explore the world through biting and hitting things around them. Hands and teeth are a child's first social tools. A child learns to use them to explore the things around them as well as the reactions she gets from others when she uses them.  Biting and hitting is most common between the ages of 18 months and 2 1/2 years, while language is still developing. Biting usually stops as language develops, but hitting often continues for several years into early childhood. If your child is hitting in particular environments, such as at a particular child's house or at preschool, take a look at these places to see what might be causing her behavior. Consider the behavior as a nonverbal communication, and think about what she might be trying to communicate.  Most children have shorter tempers when tired. Consider whether the hitting is happening at a particular time of day or in a limited number of situations. Consider the possibility that your child is responding to unkind behavior. Teasing and bullying often occur very subtly, in ways that your child may not be able to communicate. If this is the situation, you'll need to address those behaviors even as you teach your child alternatives to hitting. Teaching your child to identify her feelings is important. Anger, frustration, and jealousy are feelings, and feelings are natural and normal. Never make your child feel ashamed of having a feeling, even though you are trying to teach her alternative behaviors.  Notice how you respond to your own feelings of anger. Use these moments to help teach your child alternatives to hitting. For example, if you get angry at someone, use your hand like a puppet. \\"Okay, hand, you feel angry, but no hitting, okay?\\" It might feel silly, but your child will get the message. Using words to identify your feelings will help your child better connect words to his own feelings. Saying out loud when you're feeling upset, angry or frustrated can help your child learn that these feelings are normal and okay. Follow up by stating what you're going to do to help yourself feel better. For example, you might say, \\"I feel angry, but I'll feel better if I take 5 big breaths.\\" Summary:","output":"The article talks about how young children explore their world and express themselves using biting and hitting, and it provides suggestions for parents to help kids learn better ways to communicate their feelings as they grow up."},{"instruction":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

Cooke, a Creator of Head Start, Dies at 93\\" Article:","output":"Title: Robert E. Cooke, a Creator of Head Start, Dies at 93 Body: Robert E. Cooke, a renowned pediatrician and an instrumental figure in the creation of the influential Head Start educational program, passed away at the age of 93. A pioneer in early education, Dr. Cooke dedicated his life to supporting at-risk children and their families to ensure broader access to educational opportunities, developmental resources, and healthcare services. His legacy continues to inspire policymakers and educators today, as tens of millions of children have directly benefited from Head Start programs since their inception in 1965. Born on March 15, 1928, in New York City, Robert E. Cooke showed early proficiency in the sciences, which led him to pursue a degree in medicine. He completed his undergraduate degree at Yale University and then earned his medical degree from Cornell University Medical College. During his studies, Dr. Cooke focused on pediatrics, driven by an intrinsic passion for serving the needs of children and families. This passion propelled him throughout his distinguished career, shaping his professional pursuits and leaving an indelible mark on the field of early childhood education and healthcare. Dr. Cooke began his career in the mid-1950s at the Johns Hopkins Hospital, where he first noticed a pattern of gaps in the developmental and educational experiences of children living in low-income communities. He observed that these disadvantages were especially prevalent among children of color, leading to long-lasting disparities in educational attainment and health outcomes. Driven by a deep sense of responsibility to address these injustices, Dr. Cooke fervently advocated for policy changes and innovative solutions to improve the lives of these vulnerable children. In 1965, amidst the Civil Rights era and the War on Poverty initiated by President Lyndon B. Johnson, Dr. Cooke was appointed to the President's task force on health and education, where he made a tremendous impact. Recognizing that early intervention could be a key driving force in closing achievement gaps and promoting equal access to opportunities, Dr. Cooke proposed a comprehensive, community-based program that would target the educational, health, and social-emotional development of children in need. Inspired by his dedication to this cause, the task force embraced his proposal, eventually resulting in the creation of the Head Start program. Since its establishment in 1965, Head Start has served over 36 million children and their families across the United States. The program provides low-income children aged 0-5 with early education, healthcare services, nutritional support, and parent involvement programs, all aiming to foster healthy development and long-term success. Dr. Cooke's vision for early intervention has been remarkably successful, with studies showing that children who participate in Head Start programs exhibit significant improvements in academic achievement, cognitive skills, and emotional development compared to their non-Head Start counterparts. Head Start graduates are also more likely to complete high school, pursue higher education, and secure stable employment. Dr. Robert E. Cooke's contributions to early childhood education and health extend beyond the establishment of the Head Start program. Throughout his career, Dr. Cooke held numerous esteemed positions, such as professor and chairman of the pediatrics department at Johns Hopkins Hospital and the University of Wisconsin School of Medicine. He was also the recipient of numerous awards and honors for his lifelong dedication to children's wellbeing. The death of Dr. Robert E. Cooke at the age of 93 leaves behind a transformative legacy in early childhood education and healthcare. As a pioneer in the field and a tireless advocate for children and families in need, his work has left an indelible impact on the lives of millions of children around the country. As we mourn the passing of this luminary figure, we also celebrate his remarkable achievements and remember his enduring vision for a more equitable society, where all children have the opportunity to learn, grow, and thrive."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant that follows instruction extremely well.

Premise: The two friends are having fun. This statement informs us that two individuals, who are friends, are engaging in some enjoyable activity. However, it does not explicitly mention the type of activity they are participating in. Hypothesis: Two friends play a game together. In this statement, we have a specific scenario where two friends are engaged in playing a game together. Now, let's assess the connection between the premise and the hypothesis. 1. Both the premise and the hypothesis involve two friends. 2. The premise states that the friends are having fun, whereas the hypothesis suggests a specific type of fun activity, playing a game. If the hypothesis was true, it would be completely consistent with the premise: playing a game together is an example of an activity that could be fun for two friends. However, the premise does not provide enough information to exclusively conclude the hypothesis. There could be many other activities that the two friends are having fun doing. They might be watching a movie, attending a concert, or engaging in a stimulating conversation. The list of potential activities that friends can have fun doing is expansive.

Q: ROLAND HELD HIS BODY STIFF AS HE FACED THE CATHAR FORTRESS and watched the tall wooden doors swing open. He saw now that the fire of that final night's battle, now fifteen days past, had left no structure standing but the stone keep. Inside the limestone walls stood forlorn, crude shelters made of tent cloths spread over blackened beams. Cries of farewell and loud wailing came from the battlements above and from the open gateway, as the condemned emerged from the fortress, a long line of men and women in black. Roland's heartbeat broke its rhythm. During the fifteen days of grace granted under the terms of surrender, he had waited in camp with the other crusaders. Now that Diane and Perrin were safely off on the road to Paris, he felt impelled to be with the Cathars in their final moments, to bear witness. He had volunteered, despite his dread, to help escort the prisoners to their execution. Those Cathars who joined the Catholic religion would now be allowed to leave in peace, though they would be forced to give everything they owned to the Church and wear the yellow crosses for the rest of their lives. But those who clung to their faith would die. As the Cathars emerged, a man-at-arms directed each to stop at a table beside the doorway, where two Dominican friars sat with parchment scrolls. The friars recorded the name of each person about to die. This meticulous record-keeping, Roland thought, was one source of the Inquisition's power. At the head of the procession was the Cathar bishop. Bertran d'en Marti's head glowed with the red-gold rays of the low afternoon sun striking his white hair, as if it were already enveloped in flames. \\"Form around them,\\" called the leader of Roland's party. Roland reluctantly stepped forward with the other crusaders. His longsword and dagger swung heavy at his waist. He wore them only because, as a knight, he was expected to. He had left his helmet and mail shirt back in his tent. According to the above context, answer the following question. Who held his body stiff as he faced the CAthar Fortress? Available options: [1]. Dominican friar; [2]. Roland; [3]. not enough information; [4]. Diana; The answer is:","output":"[2]. Roland"},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant. You will be given a task.

Think like you are answering to a five year old. Which entity is this text about? Weather Report was an American jazz fusion band of the 1970s and early 1980s. The band was initially co-led by the Austrian-born keyboard player Joe Zawinul, the American saxophonist Wayne Shorter and Czech bassist Miroslav Vitous. Due to creative and financial disagreements, Vitous left the band after a few years. Zawinul took increasing control and steered the band towards a more funk, R&B oriented sound. 1976's Black Market album was perhaps the most rock-oriented work which the group had produced to date. Weather Report's music had evolved further from open-ended funk jams into more melody-oriented, concise forms, which also offered a greater mass-market appeal. Zawinul further consolidated his use of keyboard synthesizers, while Shorter experimented with an early form of wind synthesizer, the Lyricon.  However, the album was recorded during yet another period of change for the group, with multiple personnel shuffles. Although Alyrio Lima played percussion on one track, he was replaced during the sessions by Don Alias (his first appearance with the group since the debut album debacle) and by Alex Acuna (a Peruvian drummer and conga player based in Las Vegas, who had played with Elvis Presley and Ike Turner, among others). Alphonso Johnson was also worn out from the strain put on the rhythm by the band's frequent changes of drummer. During a break in activity halfway through the recording of Black Market, Johnson opted to leave Weather Report to play with the Billy Cobham/George Duke Band (which featured a young John Scofield on guitar).  Prior to his departure, Johnson played on all but two of the new album's tracks. His replacement was Jaco Pastorius, a virtuoso fretless bass guitarist from Florida, who had been in touch with Zawinul for several years, and who came in to play on \\"Cannon Ball\\" and his own composition \\"Barbary Coast\\". Zawinul and Shorter had assumed that Chester Thompson would be departing alongside his friend Johnson, and for the second set of sessions they replaced him (on Jaco Pastorius' recommendation) with the former Mahavishnu Orchestra drummer Narada Michael Walden. Although Walden played on several album tracks, he ultimately proved unsuitable. Thompson returned for the final Black Market sessions, but left again after failing to gel as a rhythm section with Pastorius (whose style was much busier than that of Johnson). Thompson subsequently joined Genesis as their touring drummer.  Black Market continued Weather Report's ongoing run of success, selling well and being the fourth of the band's albums to win the album of the year award from Down Beat magazine. For the subsequent tour, Alex Acuna moved from percussion to the drum kit, and Don Alias was replaced by the young Puerto Rican percussionist Manolo Badrena, who had previously played with various Latin rock bands and with Art Blakey. The band made a very well-received appearance at the Montreux Jazz Festival, which was filmed for future release.

Write the next sentence in the following story. How to build self‐control  Recognize impulsive thoughts.  Having strategies to help you resist temptation in the moment will help you build self-control. Start by making a list of the behaviors you'd like to control and the situations that often trigger the behavior.","output":"Next, analyze the patterns that emerge in these situations and identify the thought processes that lead to impulsive actions. For instance, you might notice that emotional stress or fatigue often precedes such behaviors. Understanding these warning signs can empower you to preemptively avoid the triggers or adopt coping mechanisms before the situations arise. One effective approach to enhance self-control is by employing the \\"if-then\\" strategy. With this technique, you preemptively plan a certain response whenever a specific trigger occurs. For example, you could tell yourself \\"If I feel stressed and want to eat junk food, then I will take a few deep breaths and drink a glass of water instead.\\" Another vital component of self-control is learning to delay gratification. This means enduring short-term discomfort, so you can reap long-term benefits. By frequently practicing delayed gratification, you can gradually train your brain to resist impulses and maintain focus on long-term goals. One way to develop this skill is by engaging in activities that require patience, such as reading a book, meditating, or working on complex puzzles. Moreover, it's important to recognize that willpower can be depleted over time - a phenomenon known as \\"ego depletion.\\" To counteract this, ensure you have adequate rest and relaxation periods, as this regeneration allows your self-control reserves to replenish. Establishing a healthy sleep routine, eating nutritiously, and engaging in regular physical activity can help increase your overall willpower levels. Having a reliable support network can also be a significant factor in building self-control. Share your goals and progress with friends, family, or even supportive online communities that can provide the motivation, inspiration, and accountability you need to stay on course. Additionally, consider seeking professional assistance from therapists, coaches, or counselors who can help you devise personalized strategies for self-control. Tracking your progress can be incredibly helpful in this process. Maintain a dedicated journal or a progress-tracking app to document your journey toward enhanced self-control. Make note of any successful instances of impulse resistance, as well as any lapses that may occur. This self-reflection will help you gauge your progress, identify areas for improvement, and celebrate milestones as you reach them. Lastly, remember that self-control is a continuous and evolving process. Everyone experiences setbacks at times, but cultivating a growth mindset and embracing the idea that self-control can be strengthened with practice will guide you on your path to success. Always be compassionate with yourself in the face of challenges and strive to learn from each experience, using these insights to develop even more effective self-control strategies for the future."},{"instruction":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

She is then killed by mutant leader Papa Hades (Michael Bailey Smith) for being unable to provide healthy offspring. Later, scientists working in the New Mexico desert are attacked by Letch. A group of National Guardsmen in training are sent into the desert to resupply the scientists, who were working for the United States Department of Defense on installing a surveillance system (implied to be a result of the events in the first film). The soldiers arrive to find the camp apparently abandoned, and outside radio contact impossible due to the topography. When the radio operator, Spitter (Eric Edelstein), picks up a faint distress call, the sergeant (Flex Alexander) organizes a search and rescue mission, leaving behind Napoleon (Michael McMillian) and Amber (Jessica Stroup). The search party discovers the mutilated body of a scientist in the hills, while Amber and Napoleon pull another dying scientist out of the portable toilet. On her way to join the group Amber is attacked by Stabber (Tyrell Kemlo), but a returning Mickey (Reshad Strik) wards him off. Just as Napoleon catches up, Mickey is pulled into a bolt-hole and killed. At the same time, the remaining troops are attacked by Letch, and the sergeant is accidentally killed by Spitter's friendly fire. Napoleon and Amber reunite with the group, and Spitter is killed by an unseen mutant sabotaging his rappelling gear as the others attempt to lower him down the hill. With their remaining gear stolen they are forced to try to find another way down. The remaining troops soon locate their commanding officer, who has clearly become unhinged from recent events. He warns them of the mutants' plans to capture women for breeding and kill everyone else. He then commits suicide after telling them the only way down the hill is through the mining caves. After the group kills Stabber, Missy is captured and taken into the mining caves by Chameleon. Chameleon attempts to rape her, but Missy fights... The answer to this question is:","output":"The search party discovers the mutilated body of a scientist in the hills."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant. You will be given a task.

The band moved to London upon finding fame in 1964. The Animals were known for their gritty, bluesy sound and deep-voiced frontman Eric Burdon, as exemplified by their signature song and transatlantic No. 1 hit single, \\"House of the Rising Sun\\", as well as by hits such as \\"We Gotta Get Out of This Place\\", \\"It's My Life\\", \\"I'm Crying\\" and \\"Don't Let Me Be Misunderstood\\". The band balanced tough, rock-edged pop singles against rhythm and blues-orientated album material. The original Animals line-up of Burdon, Price, Valentine, Chandler and Steel reunited for a benefit concert in Newcastle in December 1968 and re-formed in late 1975 to record again. Burdon later said nobody understood why they did this short reunion. They did a mini-tour in 1976 and shot a few videos of their new songs like \\"Lonely Avenue\\" and \\"Please Send Me Someone to Love\\". They released the album in 1977 aptly called Before We Were So Rudely Interrupted. The album received critical praise. Burdon and Valentine also recorded some demos at that time, which were never released. On 12 December 1982, Burdon performed together with Alan Price and a complete line-up, foreshadowing later events.  All five original band members reunited again in 1983 for the album Ark and a world concert tour, supplemented by Zoot Money on keyboards, Nippy Noya on percussion, Steve Gregory on saxophone and Steve Grant on guitar. The first single \\"The Night\\" reached #48 at the US Pop Singles and #34 at the Mainstream Rock Charts, also gaining success in Greece. They released a second single called \\"Love Is For All Time\\".  The Ark tour consisted of about one-third material from the original 1960s and two-thirds material from Ark or other songs. The latter included the songs \\"Heart Attack\\", \\"No More Elmore\\" (both released a year earlier by Burdon), \\"Oh Lucky Man\\" (from the 1973 soundtrack album to O Lucky Man! by Price), \\"It's Too Late\\", \\"Tango\\", and \\"Young Girls\\" (later released on Burdon's compilation, The Night). On 9 September, they had their first show in New York at the Mid-Hudson Civic Center, the tickets for which sold out. A Wembley Arena concert followed on 31 December (supporting The Police) which was released on the Rip it To Shreds live album in 1984 after they had disbanded again. Their concert at the Royal Oak Theatre in Royal Oak, Michigan on 29 November 1983 was released on 27 February 2008, as Last Live Show. A film about the reunion tour was shot but never released.

Plot title: Superman: Doomsday Movie plot: Lois Lane (Anne Heche) and Superman (Adam Baldwin) are romantically involved, but Lois is unsatisfied with keeping their relationship secretive and confined to the Fortress of Solitude. While digging for a project, workers from LexCorp unearth the spaceship of Doomsday, a genetically-engineered super-soldier. The creature is highly hostile toward anything that moves; it kills the digging crew and begins a bloody rampage towards Metropolis. Superman and Doomsday engage in a battle until Superman kills Doomsday and succumbs to his own injuries. Lex Luthor (James Marsters) kills his personal assistant Mercy Graves to ensure no one else knows of LexCorp's involvement. The world mourns and Metropolis honors him with a memorial. Superman's friends cope with his death in various ways: Jimmy Olsen takes a job at a tabloid newspaper, the National Voyeur, Perry White becomes an alcoholic, and Lois, who realized that Clark was Superman, visits Martha Kent for counsel. In Superman's absence, Metropolis is overwhelmed by criminals. Toyman uses a giant mechanical spider to hold children hostage. Lois decides to save them herself, but Toyman tries to kill her and a little girl. Superman digs out of his grave and saves Lois, apprehending Toyman. He doesn't seem quite the same but Lois dismisses it as shock. She becomes suspicious, however, when Martha tells her Clark has not called home. The resurrected Superman is revealed to be a clone created by Lex from a blood sample retrieved after the Doomsday battle. Lex is keeping the real Superman's body preserved in a tube, unaware that Superman is still barely alive. He periodically tortures the clone Superman in a special lead-lined red-sunlight room with kryptonite gauntlets. A robot from the Fortress of Solitude recovers Superman's body after detecting he was still alive and begins restoring Superman to health.

First question: How does an imessage appear to the sender when I'm in airplane mode? Second question: Can Apple tell me what time it was when I put my iPhone on airplane mode? Are these two questions asking the same thing? OPT:  -no  -yes","output":"First question: How does an iMessage appear to the sender when I'm in airplane mode? When you put your iPhone in airplane mode, it disables the cellular and wireless connections. As a result, your device cannot send or receive any iMessages, text messages, or calls. When someone sends you an iMessage while your phone is in airplane mode, the message will remain undelivered on their end until you turn off airplane mode and reconnect to the internet (either via Wi-Fi or cellular data).  To the sender, the iMessage will appear showing a status of \\"Delivered\\" once it has been successfully delivered to your device. However, if you are in airplane mode, their message will show a status of \\"Sending...\\" or \\"Not Delivered\\" under the iMessage text bubble. Depending on the sender's settings, they may also see a red exclamation mark next to the message, indicating that the message could not be delivered. It is essential to understand that the iMessage won't show \\"Read\\" status on the sender's device until you actually read the message after turning off the airplane mode and reconnecting to the internet.  Second question: Can Apple tell me what time it was when I put my iPhone on airplane mode? Apple cannot directly tell you the exact time you enabled airplane mode on your iPhone. The only way to determine when airplane mode was enabled is by checking your own device. You could use your memory or look at the time-stamps on any messages, calls, or notifications received right before entering airplane mode. Regrettably, there is no built-in feature that logs or records the times airplane mode is toggled on or off. However, if you have Location Services enabled on your device, you may be able to get a rough idea of when your device was disconnected from cellular or Wi-Fi by checking your location history within Apple Maps. This solution will not give you the exact time but an approximation of when you lost connection by looking at your last updated location tied to a timestamp. To answer the final question, these two questions are not the same. They address separate issues related to airplane mode on an iPhone. The first question focuses on the sender's perspective when sending iMessages to a recipient in airplane mode, while the second question is related to determining the time you enabled airplane mode on your device. Therefore, the answer to whether these questions are asking the same thing is: - No"},{"instruction":"About 45 percent of Americans don't get enough sleep, according to a recent survey.

Just over half of all households in the country own at least one Apple product, a new survey says, showing just how far the reach of the company has come in the last decade. At the turn of the 21st century, Apple was in rough shape. It had narrowly avoided bankruptcy, and Steve Jobs' return as CEO a few years earlier was turning the company around, but the market share of its products -- then almost exclusively Mac computers -- was dismal, at about 2% worldwide. Then came the iPod, which begat the iPhone and the iPad. As Apple's gadgets gobbled up market share (and in some cases created new markets), its Macs experienced a rebound, too. Now, according to CNBC's All-American Economic Survey, 51% of U.S. households own at least one Apple product. Few brands have such a deep reach among American consumers. Certainly, product categories such as refrigerators or even smartphones have achieved even deeper penetration, but looking at single companies, it's a short list with probable names such as GE (light bulbs) or 3M (Scotch tape). Reducing to just technology companies would make it even shorter. See also: Sorry, Google: Apple is America's Valentine This Year [study]. Of the households that own Apple products, they own an average of three, making the overall ownership rate of the American public 1.6 Apple products per household. About 25% plan to buy another Apple product in the next year. The survey shows Apple buyers tend to skew male, young, with higher education and incomes (77% of households making 75,000 or more have an Apple product). If you have kids, the likelihood of being an Apple household grows -- 61% compared with 48% if you don't. As far as politics is concerned, both Republicans and Democrats appear to like Apple products equally, with 56% of people counting themselves a member of either party owning Apple, although a greater portion of Democrats plan to buy more products soon. CNBC's survey polled 836 Americans via both landlines and cellphones over three days in March. The network says it has a margin of error of plus or minus 3.4%. Do you own Apple products?

First, the question asks what one must do if they want to buy something. This implies that there is a necessary action required to complete the purchasing process. 2. When considering the options, \\"spend money\\" directly relates to the act of buying something, as it involves exchanging money for the desired item. This is a fundamental aspect of purchasing, so it is the most appropriate answer. 3. \\"Go shopping\\" and \\"a shop\\" are related to the process of finding and acquiring items to purchase but do not represent the actual requirement of making a purchase. 4. \\"Paying\\" closely relates to \\"spend money,\\" but it is not as direct. Paying can also be in the form of exchanging goods or services rather than just spending money. Thus, \\"spend money\\" is a more accurate answer. 5. \\"Have in mind\\" is not directly related to the act of purchasing.

British Designer Is at it Again, Debuts 17.7 Million Diamond Dress It looks like Debbie Wingham took the adage “diamonds are a girl’s best friend,” seriously. The British designer debuted her latest creation: a red diamond-encrusted dress valued at a whopping 17.7 million (£11.7 million). Dubbed the “Abaya,” the dress is a loose black gown inspired by traditional North African and Arabic attire worn by some women in parts of the Islamic world, NBC Today reported. (PHOTOS: Fashion Month in 75 Photos: Trends from New York, London, Milan and Paris) The dress is simple, except that there’s 2,000 stones embellished on it. One of which, at the center of the garment, is a rare and expensive red diamond, apparently worth 7.4 million. The dress also has 50 2-carat white diamonds, 50 2-carat black diamonds and 1,899 pointer diamonds, all of which are set in platinum. But this blinged-out number isn’t the first from Wingham. Last September the designer debuted her 5.7 million Little Black Dress at Kiev Fashion Week, and launched a collection of diamond-studded jeans soon afterwards. If you’re hoping to get your hands on the pricey Abaya, you’ll have to think again. The designer told NBC Today that the red diamond is borrowed and because of its rarity she wouldn’t be able to get another one. “The dress will never be sold, it’s a show piece,” she said.

Unfortunately, this conduct can be jarring for many people, with some going as far to give up sharing their creative endeavours so as not to deal with the “wrath of the Internet”. As some of you will know, this has been bothering me for a while now. While there is no silver bullet for solving these issues, one thing I have learned over the years is how to put negative, anti-social, and non-constructive comments and feedback into perspective. To help others with this I have written a free book called Dealing With Disrespect. Dealing With Disrespect is a short, simple to read, free book that provides a straight-forward guide for handling this kind of challenging feedback, picking out the legitimate criticism to learn from, and how to not just ignore the haters, but how to manage them. The book helps put all communication, whether on or offline, into perspective and helps you to become a better communicator yourself. My goal with the book is that when someone reads something anti-social that demotivates them, a friend can recommend ‘Dealing With Disrespect’ as something that can help put things in perspective. According to the above context, choose the correct option to answer the following question. Question: What happened before the book Dealing With Disrespect was written? Options: - the Internet trolls, the haters, the comment boxes filled with venom - publishing content - the new generation of technology - not enough information Answer:","output":"- the Internet trolls, the haters, the comment boxes filled with venom"},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

And yes, I was even shown the \\"End of Evangelion\\" and that still made me hate it even more. Not to mention the countless rip-offs of this show! I don't mind psychological and philosophy untertones, but Evangelion drags it out into the mud like nothing else! Not many of the characters seemed to be very interesting. The only ones that seemed to be interesting were Asuka, Misato and Pen-Pen. Other than that, mostly everyone else were a bunch of whiny crybaby losers. They need to go to a psyciatric center, not piloting giant robots against aliens called \\"Angels\\". Even the mecha and alien fights did not help at all. Goes something like this: \\"Well, there are these robots, and they are really cool because they bleed(!) when they get hurt, but they are not really mecha, but captured angels, so sometimes they go insane and don't do what the underaged pilots want, and they have to be controlled better...blah blah blah!\\" I am so sorry, but I just cannot recommend Evangelion to anyone, anime otakus or not. To those who love this series greatly, fine you're entitled to that opinion, I respect you. But to thoses that have a \\"out of your mind\\" obsession to think that every one will like this series, you are more of an egotist.

Answer:","output":"Based on the analysis of the product review and its title, it seems that the reviewer has expressed a negative sentiment towards the Kindle version of the product. The primary concern stated by the reviewer is that the Kindle version is outdated, as it is a 2004 edition of \\"The Wire.\\" This indicates that the reviewer may find the content and information provided within the Kindle version irrelevant or not up-to-date. Additionally, the reviewer has expressed their situation of being overseas and relying on Kindle as a medium to access books. This implies that their access to this specific book is limited due to the outdated version. In this case, the reviewer would prefer an updated version that corresponds to the latest content. The use of caps and exclamation marks in the review also points out the urgency, frustration, and dissatisfaction of the reviewer. While the reviewer's comments might be constructive, the overall sentiment is negative since they are demanding an update and seem quite dissatisfied with the current outdated Kindle version.

Second question: Why aren't there a lot of Muslim cricketers in the Indian cricket team? Are these two questions asking the same thing? Choices: [1]. no [2]. yes","output":"[1]. No The two questions you've asked are not asking the same thing, they pertain to different aspects of cricket in India. Now, to answer your questions in detail: 1. The selection in an Indian cricket team, especially at a national level, involves a few steps. Here are details on that process: • Local Club and School Teams: Start by practicing and honing your skills at a local level by playing in school teams, local cricket club or in district cricket leagues. This is primarily to gain experience and understand the intricacies of the game better. • Cricket Academies: Next, you might want to consider joining a cricket academy. These academies have experienced coaches who can help refine your skills and teach you the advanced technicalities of cricket. • District Level Cricket: By playing for your local or district cricket leagues, you may be noticed by state selectors. They choose proficient players and offer them a chance to play at the state level. • State Level and First Class Cricket: If your performance at the district level stands out, you'll be given opportunity to represent your state. Playing well at the state level can give you an entry into Ranji Trophy, the premier domestic cricket championship in India. • National Level: Consistently good performances in these tournaments may attract attention of the national selectors who are always on the lookout for potential players for the Indian cricket team.  • Performance at Every Level: Keep in mind that it's not only about reaching these various levels, it's mainly about performing exceptionally at each level. For you to rise through this hierarchy, your performance, dedication and resilience matter the most. • Age Groups: Also, there are age-group tournaments like the U-16, U-19 and U-23 conducted by BCCI. By performing well in these tournaments, you get a chance to play for India A and India U-19 teams. It's to be noted that joining a cricket academy is not compulsory but can be very beneficial for improved training and guidance, especially from a very young age.   2. About the representation of different religions in sports, it's essential to understand that selection for the Indian cricket team is based on merit and not on religion or any other communal basis.  There are several Muslim cricketers, like Zaheer Khan, Mohammad Shami, Irfan Pathan and Yusuf Pathan, who have represented India internationally. It's just that the number might be proportional to the population distribution and also interest and access to facilities and opportunities in the particular sport within different communities. Furthermore, talent doesn't discriminate on the basis of religion.  It could also be that more Muslim players are not making it to the national team because they are not passing through the rigorous selection and performance criteria set by BCCI, not because of their religion. Talent, consistent performance, fitness, and discipline – these are aspects that determine a cricketer's journey to the Indian team. In conclusion, the road to becoming a part of the Indian cricket team requires commitment, hard work, consistency and a passion for the game, irrespective of one's religious beliefs."},{"instruction":"You are a teacher.

After his accession to the throne in 1820, King George IV continued the renovation with the idea in mind of a small, comfortable home. While the work was in progress, in 1826, the King decided to modify the house into a palace with the help of his architect John Nash. Some furnishings were transferred from Carlton House, and others had been bought in France after the French Revolution. The external façade was designed keeping in mind the French neo-classical influence preferred by George IV. The cost of the renovations grew dramatically, and by 1829 the extravagance of Nash's designs resulted in his removal as architect. On the death of George IV in 1830, his younger brother King William IV hired Edward Blore to finish the work. At one stage, William considered converting the palace into the new Houses of Parliament, after the destruction of the Palace of Westminster by fire in 1834.

The fashion shoot not only aimed to raise awareness about the rising issue of acid attacks in India, but also intended to empower and uplift the survivors, who have often faced discrimination, ostracization, and intense physical and emotional pain as a result of their attacks. The photo shoot took place in a beautifully lit and thoughtfully designed studio, which served as a safe and comfortable space for the survivors to express themselves and their creativity. Each woman was encouraged to choose clothing and accessories from Rupa's collection that resonated with her personal style and allowed her to feel confident and beautiful. The garments in Rupa Designs' collection were created with the intention of celebrating the individuality and strength of these women, using vibrant colors, bold patterns, and unique silhouettes to accentuate their features and tell their stories. In addition to the professional styling and photography, the survivors also received support from makeup artists and hair stylists who were brought in to enhance their natural beauty and help them feel pampered and cared for. The team worked together to ensure that each survivor felt comfortable and confident in their skin, using their skills to emphasize each woman's unique features and create powerful, stunning looks that capture the essence of their resilience and inner strength.

Write an article that answers the following question: What happened first: Battle of Poitiers or Edward permitted John to return to Brittany?","output":"Writing an article involves several steps, such as understanding the topic, researching, sorting out relevant data, and articulating them in a structured manner. In this case, the topic at hand involves historical events: the Battle of Poitiers and Edward's permission for John to return to Brittany. Step 1: Understand the Topic Firstly, we need to clearly understand the task in hand. The user wants an article that answers the question of which event occurred first: the Battle of Poitiers, or Edward granting permission for John to return to Brittany. To write this article, we'll need to do research and determine the timings of these two historical events. Step 2: Research The Battle of Poitiers refers to one of two major historical events – the Battle of Poitiers in 732 where Charles Martel stopped the Arab advance into Western Europe or the Battle of Poitiers in 1356 during the Hundred Years' War. Since we are comparing it with an event involving English and Breton nobility, it's likely the latter scenario, as the Hundred Years' War involved England and France. Edward, in this instance, likely refers to Edward I of England (reigned 1272-1307). John is presumably John I, Duke of Brittany (reigned 1237-1286). Research reveals that Edward I allowed John I to return to Brittany around 1274. Step 3: Analyze the Information Upon analyzing the research data, it is seen that Edward I's permission to John to return to Brittany was in the 13th century, specifically around 1274, whilst the Battle of Poitiers relevant to the English monarchy took place in the 14th century, in 1356 to be precise. Step 4: Construct the Article Now that we've gathered and analyzed the necessary data, it's time to write an article detailing the findings. I'll ensure the article is informative and organized, with a clear statement answering the initial question. Step 5: Proofread and Review After writing the article, it's crucial to proofread for any potential errors and ensure the article is cohesive, relevant, and accurate. Here's how the article might look: Title: Which Happened First: The Battle of Poitiers or Edward Granting Permission to John to Return to Brittany? History is a grand tapestry, interwoven with countless threads of events. One might find themselves wondering about the sequence of past events, like the Battle of Poitiers and Edward's allowance for John to return to Brittany. This article clarifies which of these events happened first. To identify which occurred first, we first need to pinpoint the time frames of these events. The Battle of Poitiers involved in this comparison occurred during the Hundred Years' War in the year 1356. This was a decisive battle between the kingdoms of England and France.  On the other hand, the event of Edward I, King of England, permitting John I, Duke of Brittany, to return to his dukedom is documented to have happened significantly earlier, around 1274, during Edward's reign. From the analysis, it becomes clear that Edward granting permission for John to return to Brittany happened first, predating the Battle of Poitiers by about 82 years. Therefore, even within the intricate panorama of history, chronology unravels the sequence of events."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant. User will you give you a task.

Summarize: Since you will be painting on your plywood, you want it to have a smooth texture. Signboard is a great option, but if you can’t get it, sanded plywood or medium-density fiberboard will also work.  A common size is 4 by 4 feet (120 by 120 cm), but you can make your barn quilt whatever size you want. A smaller one is an easy way to start. A lumberyard or a home supply store are good places to look for plywood. Do your priming and painting outside or in an open garage. Lay down drop clothes to protect the floor if you are painting on the ground. You can also put your plywood on top of sawhorses or on a work table. If you don’t have ventilation when you paint, the paint fumes can be really harmful. Pour primer into a rolling tray, and dip your paint roller into it. Rub the paint roller along the plywood in smooth, even strokes. It’s important to use an exterior primer, since barn quilts are normally hung outdoors. Allow the coat to dry, following the instructions on the primer. Different kinds of primer will take different amounts of time to dry, so check the instructions on your can of primer to figure out how long you need to let it sit. Then paint on the second coat just as you did the first one. Let the primer dry again. You need to prime the back of your board as well, even though you won’t be painting it. This helps keep your artwork waterproof, since the barn quilt will have to withstand the weather outdoors. Be patient and wait for the primer to dry in between each coat. It will help your quilt last much longer.","output":"To prepare plywood for painting a barn quilt, choose a smooth-textured material like signboard, sanded plywood, or medium-density fiberboard.

Write an article that answers the following question: Which group from the census is larger: Irish or Polish?","output":"Title: Irish or Polish: A Dive into Census Data to Determine the Larger Group Introduction: While pondering over ethnically diverse communities, one might find oneself questioning: which group is larger, the Irish or the Polish? To answer this question, we must rely on reliable and accurate data from national census records, specifically focusing on their population statistics. In this article, we will examine the latest census data from both Ireland and Poland and deduce which ethnic group constitutes a larger portion of the population. Step 1: Research on reliable sources for census data To ensure the most accurate information, it is essential to find the latest official national census data for both countries. National census can be obtained from government agencies like the Central Statistics Office (CSO) in Ireland and the Central Statistical Office (GUS) in Poland.  Step 2: Analyze the Irish census The most recent Irish census took place in 2016, with the next one scheduled for 2021. In 2016, the Irish population was reported at approximately 4.76 million people. According to the Central Statistics Office, the majority of the population identified themselves as ethnically Irish, with certain individuals belonging to other minority ethnic groups such as Polish living in the country.  Step 3: Analyze the Polish census The latest Polish census was conducted in 2011, with a more recent one planned for 2021 or 2022. The population of Poland as of 2011 was approximately 38.5 million people. Just like in Ireland, most individuals residing in the country identified themselves as ethnically Polish, with minority groups such as the Romani, Belarusians, and Ukrainians, among others, comprising smaller portions of the population. Step 4: Compare the results With the Irish population at around 4.76 million and the Polish population at around 38.5 million, it is clear that the ethnically Polish group is significantly larger than the ethnically Irish group.  Step 5: Consider potential external factors It is important to acknowledge that census data may not always provide a complete picture of the actual sizes of these communities globally. External factors such as immigration and emigration patterns, births, and deaths between the time of census collection and the present day may influence final figures. However, given the significant gap between the populations, it is reasonable to conclude that the ethnically Polish group is larger than the ethnically Irish group. Conclusion: Based on the available census data from the Central Statistics Office in Ireland and the Central Statistical Office in Poland, we can conclude that the ethnically Polish group is larger than the ethnically Irish group. It is vital to examine official census data using a careful and systematic approach to ensure the accuracy of the information being presented. While acknowledging the potential impact of external factors, we can confidently recognize the Polish as a more significant demographic."},{"instruction":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

She has two brothers, Martin and Steve, who plays in her concert band as of 2017, and a sister, Gina. Martina's parents, Daryl and Jeanne Schiff, owned a dairy farm. Daryl, who was also a cabinetry shop owner, exposed Martina to country music at a young age. Released in 1995, Wild Angels accounted for another top five hit in its lead single \\"Safe in the Arms of Love\\", which had previously been recorded by both Wild Choir and Baillie & the Boys, and was concurrently released in Canada by Michelle Wright at the time of McBride's version. The album's title track went on to become McBride's first No. 1 single on the country charts in early 1996. However, the three follow-ups,\\"Phones Are Ringin' All Over Town\\", \\"Swingin' Doors\\" and \\"Cry on the Shoulder of the Road\\" were less successful, reaching the lower regions of the top 40.  In early 1997, after \\"Cry on the Shoulder of the Road\\" peaked, McBride released two duets. \\"Still Holding On\\", a duet with Clint Black which was the lead-off single to her album Evolution and his album Nothin' but the Taillights, and \\"Valentine\\", a collaboration with pop pianist Jim Brickman which appeared on his album Picture This. She also sang duet vocals on \\"Chances Are\\" with Bob Seger, featured on the soundtrack of the 1998 motion picture Hope Floats.  She had her second number one on the country charts with \\"A Broken Wing\\", the second single from her album Evolution, in late 1997 This album went on to produce four more top ten hits at country radio: a re-release of \\"Valentine\\", \\"Happy Girl\\", \\"Wrong Again\\" (which also went to number one), and \\"Whatever You Say\\". Towards the end of 1998, the album was certified double platinum in sales by the Recording Industry Association of America for selling two million units.

Please answer the following question: Question: \\"What do many people do to their water before storing it?\\"  Context: \\"Solar water disinfection (SODIS) involves exposing water-filled plastic polyethylene terephthalate (PET) bottles to sunlight for several hours. Exposure times vary depending on weather and climate from a minimum of six hours to two days during fully overcast conditions. It is recommended by the World Health Organization as a viable method for household water treatment and safe storage. Over two million people in developing countries use this method for their daily drinking water.\\"  Answer: A:","output":"Many people, especially in developing countries, treat and disinfect their water before storing it to ensure its safety for drinking and other household purposes. Solar water disinfection (SODIS) is one such method widely accepted and recommended by organizations such as the World Health Organization. This method, as mentioned, involves the use of plastic polyethylene terephthalate (PET) bottles that are filled with water and then exposed to sunlight for varying lengths of time, depending on the weather and climatic conditions. The treatment period ranges from a minimum of six hours up to two days during fully overcast conditions. The process of solar water disinfection works by leveraging the natural germicidal properties of sunlight. Ultraviolet (UV) radiation helps inactivate a wide range of microorganisms, such as bacteria, viruses, and protozoa, in the water. Moreover, when combined with an increase in water temperature (thermal inactivation), this treatment method becomes even more effective in eradicating harmful pathogens. The utilization of PET bottles further ensures that the water stored remains uncontaminated. These bottles, when adequately cleaned and sealed, prevent the entry of dust, pollutants, and insects, thus maintaining the quality of the treated water. This method of water treatment has been widely adopted by over two million individuals, particularly in rural and remote areas where access to clean drinking water is limited or nonexistent. Due to its simplicity, low cost, and ease of implementation, SODIS serves as an efficient and practical solution for addressing the urgent need for safe drinking water in these communities. In addition to being readily available, sunlight is a free and renewable resource that makes the SODIS method sustainable and environmentally friendly. There are a few essential factors that must be taken into consideration while using this method to achieve the best possible results: 1. The water source: The water to be treated needs to have low levels of turbidity or cloudiness, preferably below 30 nephelometric turbidity units (NTU). If the water is too cloudy or includes large particles, it should be filtered or allowed to settle before filling the PET bottles. 2. Bottle preparation: The plastic PET bottles should be thoroughly cleaned and rinsed before use. Additionally, any labels or other obstructions should be removed, allowing for maximum exposure to sunlight. 3. Exposure duration: The time needed for sufficient disinfection depends on the weather conditions, intensity of sunlight, and the water's turbidity levels. In bright and sunny conditions, the treatment can be achieved in as little as six hours. However, during periods of cloudiness or low sunlight, the exposure time may extend up to two days. 4. Storage: Once treated, the water in the PET bottles should be stored in a clean and covered environment to maintain its quality and keep it safe for drinking. Ideally, bottles should be consumed within several days to reduce the risk of recontamination. It's important to note that while the SODIS method is effective in inactivating a significant number of pathogens, it might not be as efficient against certain resistant microorganisms, such as Cryptosporidium or some viruses. In such cases, additional treatment methods, like boiling or adding chlorine, may be necessary to ensure complete water safety. Nevertheless, solar water disinfection serves as a practical and cost-effective option for individuals and communities in developing countries, providing them with access to clean and safe drinking water, which is vital for their overall health and well-being."},{"instruction":"You should describe the task and explain your answer.

(August 2016) (Learn how and when to remove this template message) In 1955, William Smith (Jeremy Irons), a widower, lives with his nine-year-old son, Danny (Samuel Irons), in a vardo behind the filling station and garage where he works in the English countryside. The land that the station and garage is built upon is coveted by businessman Victor Hazell (Robbie Coltrane), who owns the surrounding land and lives in a large mansion several miles away. He attempts to buy the Smiths' land, but William turns down his offers. Used to getting his own way, he begins a campaign of harassment, trying to force them off their land. Several inspectors from the local council come and assess William's property, and it becomes obvious that Hazell has sent them there by alerting them with false stories. William decides to poach Hazell's prized game pheasants in retribution, using raisins to lure them out, but comes home empty handed; Danny had detected his absence and was relieved to see him return. Afterwards, he reveals that he was out poaching. A while afterwards, William informs Danny that he will be going out poaching again at night. Danny wakes up during the night, detects his absence (he had promised to be back three hours before), and decides to go and look for him. He heads for the forest at the wheel of a vintage Austin Seven that William had been repairing, but on the way there he passes a police car, which turns around to pursue him after the officers realized that the car was being driven by an underage driver. He manages to shake them off by darting through a gap in the roadside hedges and driving along a country lane until he reaches the forest. He then spots two gamekeepers and hides from them, but then he hears them talking to someone in a deep hole in the ground; when they walk off to tell Hazell, Danny goes over and finds that the man in the hole is William,...

Article: Advertisement is the difficult business of bringing information to great numbers of people.The purpose of an advertisement is to make people respond to make them react to an idea,such as helping prevent forest fires,or to make them want to buy a certain product or service.At the beginning of the 20th century,advertisement was described as\\"salesmanship in print\\".If this definition were expanded to include radio and television,it would still stand today.The most effective way to sell something is through person-to-person contact.But the cost of person-to-person selling is high because it takes a great deal of time,and it increases the cost of the product or service.Advertising distributes the selling message to many people at one time.The first printed advertisement in the English language appeared in 1278,more than a century before Shakespeare's first play was produced.This early advertisement was the work of William Caxton,England's first printer,who used it to advertise religious books from his own workshop Caxton posted small printed notices along London's main streets.Besides advertising his product,he identified his shop with a red-striped shield so that customers could find it easily. This same sort of simple informational advertising is still used.Examples are the roadside signs that tell travelers that they can buy fresh corn just down the road or that there is a restaurant in the next town. The Industrial Revolution,in the 18th and 19th centuries,brought a new kind of advertising.Large factories took the place of small workshops and goods were produced in large quantities. Manufacturers used the newly built railroads to distribute their products over wide areas.They had to find many thousands of customers in order to stay in business.They couldn't simply tell people where shoes or cloth or tea could be bought---they had to learn how to make people want to buy a specific product. Thus modern advertising was born. Advertising created new markets and helped to raise standards of living as people came to...

Please answer the following question: Information:  - Six by Seven (also written as SIX.BY SEVEN or six.by seven or six.byseven) are a Nottingham-based indie rock band who originally consisted of Chris Olley on vocals and guitars, James Flower on keyboards, Sam Hempton on guitar, Paul Douglas on bass and Chris Davis on drums. Exponents of building, atmospheric drone-rock, influenced heavily by bands such as My Bloody Valentine and Spacemen 3 they found a niche in the industry with a considerable underground following, but despite some attempts to commercialise their sound, this never crossed over into mainstream success. After splitting up in 2008, the band reformed in 2012 with Olley and Flower the only original members.  - Spacemen 3 were an English alternative rock band, formed in 1982 in Rugby, Warwickshire by Peter Kember and Jason Pierce. Their music was \\"colourfully mind-altering, but not in the sense of the acid rock of the 1960s; instead, the band developed its own minimalistic psychedelia\\" (Stephen Erlewine, \\"AllMusic\\"). Spacemen 3 came to prominence on the independent music scene around 1989, gaining a cult following. However, they disbanded shortly afterwards, releasing their final studio album post-split in 1991 after an acrimonious parting of ways. They gained a reputation as a drug band due to the members drug taking habits and the candid interviews and outspoken views of Kember about recreational drug use. Kember and Pierce were the only members common to all line-ups of the band. Both founding members have enjoyed considerable success with their respective subsequent projects; Sonic Boom/Spectrum and Spiritualized.  - Club Sandwich at the Peveril Hotel was the final release by Six by Seven , made after the group disbanded . Following the split in late 2005 , 3 original members of the band ( Chris Olley , James Flower and Chris Davis ) formed a new band ( tentatively called ' Collision ' ) with two additional members ( Ady Fletcher and Tony ' Doggen ' Foster ) , with the hope of developing a new sound . Understandably , the sessions ended up sounding like Six by Seven , and so the recordings were released under that moniker .  - Indie rock is a genre of alternative rock that originated in the United States and the United Kingdom in the 1980s. Indie rock encapsulates indie pop and lo-fi, among others. Originally used to describe record labels, the term became associated with the music they produced and was initially used interchangeably with alternative rock. As grunge and punk revival bands in the US, and then Britpop bands in the UK, broke into the mainstream in the 1990s, it came to be used to identify those acts that retained an outsider and underground perspective. In the 2000s, as a result of changes in the music industry and the growing importance of the Internet, some indie rock acts began to enjoy commercial success, leading to questions about its meaningfulness as a term.  - Paul Howard Douglas (March 26, 1892  September 24, 1976) was an American politician and Georgist economist. A member of the Democratic Party, he served as a U.S. Senator from Illinois for eighteen years, from 1949 to 1967. During his Senate career, he was a prominent member of the liberal coalition.  - Nottingham is a city and unitary authority area in Nottinghamshire, England, located south of Sheffield and north of Leicester.  - Chris Olley is a Nottingham based musician and photographer.

Please briefly summarize this news article: Inquest: Gary Speed found by Louise Speed hanged at home - News Updated Nov 29, 2011 3:55 PM ET An inquest into the death of Gary Speed was told that the Wales manager was found hanged at his home by his wife. The 42-year-old was found dead at his Cheshire home on Sunday morning. Detective Inspector Peter Lawless, of Cheshire Police, told Cheshire coroner Nicholas Rheinberg that Speed's body was found by his wife Louise just before 7am. He said there appeared to be no suspicious circumstances and a post mortem examination found Speed's death was caused by hanging. The inquest has been adjourned until the end of January. Mr Rheinberg said: \\"I adjourn this inquest until January 30, 2012. The inquest will be heard in Warrington and will commence at 2pm.\\" There was a huge media presence at the inquest in Warrington but members of Speed's family did not attend. The coroner asked the media to \\"respect the privacy\\" of Speed's family, who said in statement on Monday that they had been overwhelmed by the messages of support they had received. Reports had suggested that Thursday's meeting of the Football Association of Wales council would include tentative talks over finding the man to fill the void left by Speed's death. Former Wales and Manchester City manager Mark Hughes has been linked with the role but Press Association Sport understands the council will not hold talks over finding a successor for Speed when they meet on Thursday, with the FAW considering any discussions of such a nature to be highly insensitive given that Speed's funeral has yet to take place. Any deliberations are set to be put on hold until at least the next council meeting in late December. Wales do not have a game until a planned friendly in February, against as yet unnamed opposition. Snapshots from Speed's time with Leeds, Everton, Newcastle, Bolton, Sheffield United and Wales. A stream of tributes have poured in from around the world in memory of the former Wales, Leeds, Everton, Newcastle, Bolton and Sheffield United midfielder. The FAW have opened a book of condolence at their headquarters in Cardiff while tributes have been left outside the grounds of Speed's former clubs. Earlier on Tuesday Welsh Assembly Members observed a minute's silence in the Senedd, Cardiff Bay, while flags continue to fly at half mast outside the Welsh Assembly buildings Ty Hywel and the Senedd. In Westminster, Labour, Conservative, Liberal Democrat and Plaid Cymru MPs tabled a Commons motion offering the House's sympathies to Speed's wife and two sons, and demanding a \\"greater understanding of the pressures placed on those in the media spotlight and of mental health issues in general\\". FAW chief executive Jonathan Ford spoke on Monday of the organisation's desire to find a fitting tribute to the late Wales manager. It is understood one of the options is for the February friendly to be used as an opportunity to celebrate Speed's life and career. Costa Rica, the country against whom Speed won the first of his 85 caps in 1990, could potentially provide the opposition although a deal for the game is not thought to be close to being agreed at this time. Tottenham manager Harry Redknapp was among the latest to pay a glowing tribute to Speed. He said: \\"I was with Gary a few weeks back - I managed a team in a charity game for (former Wales striker) John Hartson. He managed a Welsh team of ex-players and celebrities, I did an England team. \\"We had a great night at Derby and raised some money for John's charity. Gary played, looked like he could still play - he never stopped running around. He was like a 20-year-old. He was in such great condition and he was a great guy. \\"We talked about Wales, how well he'd got them playing. He got them playing so well.\\" Celtic manager Neil Lennon added his tribute to Speed, a regular opponent in Premier League competition during Lennon's time at Leicester. Lennon, who met Speed on a course recently, said on Celtic's official website, www.celticfc.net: \\"All the tributes coming his way are genuine. \\"He was a fantastic pro and a fantastic player. I sometimes think that gets overlooked because of the longevity he had in his career.\\" The Premier League on Tuesday confirmed that a minute's applause would be observed at all matches this weekend, in honour of Speed, who made 535 appearances in the competition. A minute's silence was called at the Liberty Stadium on Sunday for Swansea's clash with Aston Villa, which spontaneously became one of applause as fans from both sides began to clap.","output":"A news article talks about an investigation into the death of Gary Speed, a famous soccer player and manager.

The term is derived from the Latin word \\"septem,\\" which means \\"seven,\\" and \\"annum,\\" meaning \\"year.\\" In various contexts, a septennium can be utilized to describe a specific time frame or to classify historical events based on a seven-year duration. For instance, scholarly fields may employ a septennium as a reference tool when tracking the progression of social, cultural, economic, or political developments over time. Additionally, some religious traditions assign particular significance to the number seven, and thus, a septennium could symbolize a significant period of spiritual growth or change. In certain legal or financial contexts, a septennium may serve as a guideline for planning purposes, as evidenced by the cyclical seven-year schedule employed by some economic systems or tax regulations. Overall, a septennium's importance varies depending on the specific context in which it is used.

They'd been trying so hard for a child, suffered more mid-term miscarriages than the ewes they shuttled off to market most Thursdays. They dressed him in a one-year babygro and took him home to their hill farm. They fought to get up nights and give him his milk. His teeth made breast-feeding impossible. They sat hours gazing down in his cot. They dressed him fine and took him to their church and gave their thanks. Showed him off like the proud parents they were. Others cooed and smiled. But they never asked to hold. They gave thanks the Blakeys were happy, and that the monkey-baby had not been born to them. Jimbob's folks never gave a second thought that their boy might be different. The first Spring he walked, he stomped the moors in his welly-boots helping herd the pregnant ewes down in-by. He copied his father, kicking and cuffing at the stragglers, when the flock was returned to the hills in May. As Jimbob grew, his hair became thicker, his arms longer.

At birth, a zebra foal weighs about 55 to 88 pounds (25 to 40 kilograms) and stands approximately 3 feet (90 centimeters) tall. They can stand up on their own and start walking within 15 minutes of being born. This immediate mobility is crucial for the survival of a baby zebra in the wild, as it enables them to swiftly flee from potential predators. The unique stripe patterns mentioned in your Google search result are indeed distinctive for each zebra, much like our own fingerprints. These patterns have multiple functions: they help in camouflage, temperature regulation, and even as a way for family members to recognize each other within a herd. However, this information, while interesting, does not relate to the size of baby zebras at birth."},{"instruction":"Ash sold Casey's house and enjoyed it so much he got his realty license.

Q: Passage: Piper reported that as he was leaving Exchange Buildings to return to Houndsditch he saw a man acting suspiciously in the shadows of the cul-de-sac. As the policeman approached him, the man walked away; Piper later described him as being approximately 5 feet 7 inches (1.70 m), pale and fair-haired. When Piper reached Houndsditch he saw two policemen from the adjoining beats—constables Woodhams and Choate—who watched 120 Houndsditch and 11 Exchange Buildings while Piper went to the nearby Bishopsgate Police Station to report. By 11:30 seven uniformed and two plain clothes policemen had gathered in the locality, each armed with his wooden truncheon. Sergeant Bentley from Bishopsgate police station knocked at number 11, unaware that Piper had already done so, which alerted the gang. The door was answered by Gardstein, who made no response when Bentley asked if anyone was working there. Bentley asked him to fetch someone who spoke English; Gardstein left the door half-closed and disappeared inside. Bentley entered the hall with Sergeant Bryant and Constable Woodhams; as they could see the bottom of his trouser legs, they soon realised that someone was watching them from the stairs. The police asked the man if they could step into the back of the property, and he agreed. As Bentley moved forward, the back door opened and one of the gang exited, firing from a pistol as he did so; the man on the stairs also began firing. Bentley was shot in the shoulder and the neck—the second round severing his spine. Bryant was shot in the arm and chest and Woodhams was wounded in the leg, which broke his femur; both collapsed. Although they survived, neither Bryant or Woodhams fully recovered from their injuries.As the gang exited the property and made to escape up the cul-de-sac, other police intervened. Sergeant Charles Tucker from Bishopsgate police station was hit twice, once in the hip and once in the heart by Peters: he died instantly. Choate grabbed Gardstein and wrestled for his gun, but the Russian managed to shoot him in the leg. Other members of the gang ran to Gardstein's assistance, shooting Choate twelve times in the process, but Gardstein was also wounded; as the policeman collapsed, Gardstein was carried away by his accomplices, who included Peters. As these men, aided by an unknown woman, made their escape with Gardstein they were accosted by Isaac Levy, a passer-by, whom they threatened at pistol-point. He was the only witness to the escape who was able to provide firm details; other witnesses confirmed they saw a group of three men and a woman, and thought one of the men was drunk as he was being helped by his friends. The group, which included Peters, went to Svaars' and Peter the Painter's lodgings at 59 Grove Street (now Golding Street), off Commercial Road, where Gardstein was tended by two of the gang's associates, Luba Milstein (Svaars' mistress) and Sara Trassjonsky. As they left Gardstein on the bed, Peters left his Dreyse pistol under the mattress, either to make it seem the wounded man was the one who had killed Tucker, or to enable him to defend himself against a possible arrest.

Are these two questions paraphrases of each other? Pick from: (I). no; (II). yes;","output":"(I). no; While the two questions are closely related, they are not paraphrases of each other. The first question specifically asks about the existence of moderators that oversee Quora moderators, while the second question seeks a broader understanding of the overall Quora moderation system. To provide a comprehensive answer for both questions, I will first explain how Quora moderation works, and then address the existence of moderators moderating other Quora moderators. Quora, a platform for users to ask questions and share knowledge, relies on a combination of human moderators and artificial intelligence (AI) algorithms to maintain conversation quality. The moderation process can be broken down into several key elements: 1. Community Guidelines: Quora has established clear guidelines that participants are expected to follow. This includes prohibitions on spam, harassment, and hate speech, ensuring that answers remain relevant and respectful. 2. User Reports: Users can report inappropriate content or behavior directly through the platform. This helps the moderation team identify and address potential violations of community guidelines. 3. AI Algorithms: Quora leverages AI algorithms to detect and filter content that violates guidelines. These algorithms can analyze patterns and identify potential issues, such as spam or offensive language, even before a user reports them. 4. Human Moderators: Quora employs a team of moderators who review flagged content, make decisions on potential community guideline violations, and enforce penalties as needed. While AI algorithms play a vital role in content moderation, human judgement remains an essential component in ensuring that the system remains fair and accurate. 5. Appeals Process: Users who believe their content was unfairly flagged or removed can appeal the decision. This ensures that users' perspectives are heard and allows for adjustments in the moderation process if mistakes have been made. Now, to address the question of whether there are moderators moderating the Quora moderators, the answer is yes, but indirectly. Quora's moderation team, like any organization, is likely subject to hierarchical oversight and internal policies for quality assurance and accountability. Moderators' actions and decisions may undergo audits or reviews by higher-level staff members to ensure consistency, accuracy, and adherence to Quora's guidelines. In summary, the Quora moderation system relies on a combination of community guidelines, user reports, AI algorithms, and human moderators to maintain a high quality of conversation on the platform. Furthermore, the moderation team itself is likely subject to oversight and monitoring by higher-level staff members within the organization, ensuring that all moderation actions align with Quora's guidelines and objectives."},{"instruction":"I am verifying the answers generated by an automatic system to the following question: how an oil rig works Suggested answer: In many cases, the platform contains facilities to house the workforce as well.

The 15-year-old child bride featured on controversial television programme Benefits Street has had a baby with her Romanian migrant 'husband', it has been revealed. The girl was seen on the Channel 4 series on Monday, where she was on screen alongside her husband, who gave his name only as Alex and described the marriage - illegal in both the UK and Romania - as 'alright, no problem'. It has now been revealed that months after documentary makers finished filming the series on James Turner Street in Birmingham, where 90 per cent of residents receive state handouts, the couple had their fist child. Child 'bride': A 20-year-old Romanian, right, boasted to cameras that his 15-year-old 'wife', left, was 'no problem' Boast: 20-year-old Romanian Alex, right, boasted that having a 15-year-old 'wife', left, was 'no problem' The baby girl was reportedly born in a hospital in the city, although the couple were thought to have temporarily left the UK for Romania to sign official papers relating to the three-month-old. The child's birth means the couple are now entitled to receive £88 every month in child benefit, as well as additional tax credits - although it is not known if they intend to claim them. Despite giving his name as Alex, the new father's family said his name was in fact Stefan Stana, while his partner, who was unnamed in the show, is Madalina Balasa, who is now 16. Mother: The girl, named by family members as Madalina Balasa, had the child in October after she turned 16. Unpleasant: Rubbish is piled on up James Turner Street, Birmingham. They featured on the series as part of a Romanian family, who did not claim benefits but worked as professional bin raiders, trying to scavenge for scrap metal to sell. Stefan's brother Florin confirmed the birth of the child, and said the couple, understood to still be living in Birmingham, had gone to Romania to get papers for the child. 'They have had a baby together,' Florin told The Sun. Ceremony: A wedding video shows the couple being 'married' - despite it being illegal in both the UK and Romania. 'It was born in October - she is called Miruna. Madalina was 16 when the baby was born.' Madalina was just 15 and a half when she and Stefan, then 20, were interviewed for the programme. He was seen boasting to the camera about his. child bride - aged just 15-and-a-half - and defending their union as. 'tradition' on the Channel 4 documentary series. The couple were shown talking about their 'marriage' in Monday's episode. Despite the girl being too young to. legally marry either in Romania or in the UK, her 'husband' said: 'This. scares people in England because she is a minor. 'In my country it’s. alright – no problem.' His wife was also asked if she loved him, replying 'Yes, I love him'. The couple were also seen showing off their wedding photograph, in which Stefan, dressed in a shiny black tuxedo and tie, holding his young bride's hand as she stands next to him in a white wedding dress and veil. Florin said that the couple had got married in Romania. Lib Dem MP John Hemming described child marriage as 'unacceptable' in the wake of the controversial programme. The episode showed Stefan and his family as the subject of a torrid of abuse from their neighbours, especially after the council stopped collecting rubbish after bin bags were torn open. One resident, known by her friends as 'White Dee', said: 'People move into a house and two days later they're rooting through your bin bags, that's not a nice thing and we don't want it on our road.' Another described the Romanians as 'little tramps'. Residents claimed that the situation with the rubbish was so bad, after no collections were made for two weeks, that rats were crawling through the streets. Controversial: The series has been attacked for its portrayal of claimants. The family of 14 had crammed into a small property, built for just four people, which they rented privately for £400 a month. In the programme they were shown rooting through bins looking for things to sell, heaping up disused appliances, pots and pans and old buggies. One family member admitted on the programme that neither her nor any other family members are legally entitled to work in the UK. Instead they make ends meet by collecting scrap - old cookers, microwaves, pots, pans and baby buggies - and selling it on to dealers. They claim to make only around £75 a week from this - barely enough to cover the rent on their home. Only George, a 12-year-old boy who goes to school, could speak English and communicate with their landlord or the neighbours. Notorious: James Turner Street is in the Winson Green area of Birmingham. They found the UK less attractive than they had hoped. At one point the father of the family said: 'In Romania life was much better. We had water, gas and electricity. We had our own house.', while another adds 'This is worse than Romania.' The family was eventually evicted after they couldn't keep up their rent payments, but were soon replaced by another group of Romanians - fourteen men who had come to England on the promise of farm labour, paid at £40 per day. The programme, which sparked outrage on social networks including Twitter focuses on the day-to-day lives of locals living in James Turner Street, Winson Green, Birmingham. Ninety. per cent of residents living in the 137-house street claim one or more. benefits ranging from £500 to £900 a month in free hand-outs.

Question: One way animals usually respond to a sudden drop in temperature is by What is the correct answer to the question from the following choices? Choose from: [+] sweating; [+] shivering; [+] blinking; [+] salivating;","output":"The correct answer to the question is: [+] shivering. When animals experience a sudden drop in temperature, their bodies react to maintain a constant internal temperature, also known as homeostasis. For many animals, the primary response to cold environments is shivering, which aids in generating heat by rapidly contracting and relaxing muscles. Shivering is an automatic and involuntary response that occurs when the body's core temperature decreases and the thermoregulatory system is triggered. The body goes through this process as a means to protect itself from the negative impacts of cold stress, such as hypothermia and frostbite. The other options presented do not appropriately reflect an animal's response to a sudden drop in temperature: [+] Sweating: This is a process by which animals release excess heat from their bodies through the evaporation of moisture from the skin or through specialized structures like sweat glands. Sweating is a response to elevated body temperatures, not a drop in temperature. [+] Blinking: Blinking is an action done with the eyelids, usually to clean and moisturize the eyes. It does not have a direct correlation with regulating body temperature nor responding to a sudden change in environmental temperature. [+] Salivating: This is the process of secreting saliva, a fluid produced by the salivary glands in the mouth. Saliva has several functions, including the digestion of carbohydrates, lubrication of the oral cavity, and maintaining oral hygiene. Salivation does not play a significant role in responding to a decrease in environmental temperature. In conclusion, shivering is the most accurate answer to the question of how animals typically respond to a sudden drop in temperature. It allows them to generate heat needed to maintain their core body temperature, ensuring their survival in cold environments."},{"instruction":"You should describe the task and explain your answer.

Question: Who assassinates the director? Movie title: The Soldier Movie plot: Renegade KGB agents hijack a plutonium shipment inside the United States and use it to plant a nuclear device in the Saudi Arabian Ghawar oilfield. They threaten to detonate it, thereby contaminating 50% of the world's oil reserve, unless Israel withdraws its settlements from the West Bank. The fact that the KGB is behind this threat is unknown, as the culprits are believed by the Israelis and Americans to be Islamic fundamentalist extremists. The American president contemplates starting a war with Israel, in order to save the world from oil crisis. The director of the CIA offers the president an alternative solution. A CIA agent codenamed The Soldier (Ken Wahl), working outside the usual channels, is assigned to the case. After Russian agent Dracha (Klaus Kinski) attempts to terminate him, he contacts the CIA director from the US embassy in Berlin. A KGB agent assassinates the director and frames The Soldier for his murder, leaving no official knowledge of his activities other than the president, who has disavowed any knowledge of his actions. On the run from his own government, he seeks refuge in the Israeli embassy. He and his team cooperate with the Israeli Mossad, represented by their director of covert operations Susan Goodman (Alberta Watson). Meanwhile, the president authorizes military action against Israel. Given the unpleasant options of the KGB destroying a large part of the world's oil supply or the United States having to invoke a military response to force Israel to remove its settlements from the West Bank, the title character decides to take a third option. His team infiltrates and captures a US nuclear missile silo in Smith Center, Kansas, and obtains independent launch capability.

Background: John Wood Campbell Jr. (June 8, 1910 - July 11, 1971) was an American science fiction writer and editor. He was editor of Astounding Science Fiction (later called Analog Science Fiction and Fact) from late 1937 until his death and was part of the Golden Age of Science Fiction. Campbell wrote super-science space opera under his own name and stories under his primary pseudonym, Don A. Stuart. Campbell also used the pen names Karl Van Kampen and Arthur McCann. Context: Editor T. O'Conor Sloane lost Campbell's first manuscript that he accepted for Amazing Stories, entitled \\"Invaders of the Infinite\\". \\"When the Atoms Failed\\" appeared in January 1930, followed by five more during 1930. Three were part of a space opera series featuring the characters Arcot, Morey, and Wade,. A complete novel in the series, \\"Islands of Space\\", was the cover story in the Spring 1931 Quarterly. During 1934-35 a serial novel, The Mightiest Machine, ran in Astounding Stories, edited by F. Orlin Tremaine, and several stories featuring lead characters Penton and Blake appeared from late 1936 in Thrilling Wonder Stories, edited by Mort Weisinger.  The early work for Amazing established Campbell's reputation as a writer of space adventure. When in 1934 he began to publish stories with a different tone he wrote as Don A. Stuart, a pseudonym derived from his wife's maiden name.  From 1930 until the later part of that decade, Campbell was prolific and successful under both names. Three significant stories published under the pseudonym are \\"Twilight\\" (Astounding, November 1934), \\"Night\\" (Astounding, October 1935), and \\"Who Goes There?\\" (Astounding, August 1938). \\"Who Goes There?\\", about a group of Antarctic researchers who discover a crashed alien vessel, formerly inhabited by a malevolent shape-changing occupant, was published in Astounding almost a year after Campbell became its editor and it was his last significant piece of fiction, at age 28. It was filmed as The Thing from Another World (1951), The Thing (1982), and again as The Thing (2011).  Campbell held the amateur radio call sign W2ZGU, and wrote many articles on electronics and radio for a wide range of magazines.  The Encyclopedia of Science Fiction wrote: \\"More than any other individual, he helped to shape modern sf.\\" After 1950, new magazines such as Galaxy Science Fiction and The Magazine of Fantasy & Science Fiction moved in different directions and developed talented new writers who were not directly influenced by him. Campbell often suggested story ideas to writers (including \\"Write me a creature that thinks as well as a man, or better than a man, but not like a man\\"), and sometimes asked for stories to match cover paintings he had already bought.  Campbell had a strong formative influence on Asimov and eventually became a friend. Asimov said of Campbell's influence on the field: \\"By his own example and by his instruction and by his undeviating and persisting insistence, he forced first Astounding and then all science fiction into his mold. He abandoned the earlier orientation of the field. He demolished the stock characters who had filled it; eradicated the penny dreadful plots; extirpated the Sunday-supplement science. In a phrase, he blotted out the purple of pulp. Instead, he demanded that science-fiction writers understand science and understand people, a hard requirement that many of the established writers of the 1930s could not meet. Campbell did not compromise because of that: those who could not meet his requirements could not sell to him, and the carnage was as great as it had been in Hollywood a decade before, while silent movies had given way to the talkies.\\"  One example of the type of speculative but plausible science fiction that Campbell demanded from his writers is \\"Deadline\\", a short story by Cleve Cartmill that appeared during the wartime year of 1944, a year before the detonation of the first atomic bomb. As Ben Bova, Campbell's successor as editor at Analog, wrote, it \\"described the basic facts of how to build an atomic bomb. Cartmill and Campbell worked together on the story, drawing their scientific information from papers published in the technical journals before the war. To them, the mechanics of constructing a uranium-fission bomb seemed perfectly obvious.\\" The FBI descended on Campbell's office after the story appeared in print and demanded that the issue be removed from the newsstands. Campbell convinced them that by removing the magazine \\"the FBI would be advertising to everyone that such a project existed and was aimed at developing nuclear weapons\\" and the demand was dropped.  Campbell was also responsible for the grim and controversial ending of Tom Godwin's short story \\"The Cold Equations\\". Writer Joe Green recounted that Campbell had \\"three times sent 'Cold Equations' back to Godwin, before he got the version he wanted ... Godwin kept coming up with ingenious ways to save the girl! Since the strength of this deservedly classic story lies in the fact that the life of one young woman must be sacrificed to save the lives of many, it simply would not have the same impact if she had lived.\\"  Green wrote that Campbell \\"enjoyed taking the 'devil's advocate' position in almost any area, willing to defend even viewpoints with which he disagreed if that led to a livelier debate.\\" As an example, he wrote, Campbell \\"pointed out that the much-maligned 'peculiar institution' of slavery in the American South had in fact provided the blacks brought there with a higher standard of living than they had in Africa ... I suspected, from comments by Asimov, among others - and some Analog editorials I had read - that John held some racist views, at least in regard to blacks.\\" Finally, however, Green agreed with Campbell that \\"rapidly increasing mechanization after 1850 would have soon rendered slavery obsolete anyhow. It would have been better for the USA to endure it a few more years than suffer the truly horrendous costs of the Civil War.\\"  In a June 1961 editorial called \\"Civil War Centennial,\\" Campbell argued that slavery had been a dominant form of human relationships for most of history and that the present was unusual in that anti-slavery cultures dominated the planet. He wrote, \\"It's my bet that the South would have been integrated by 1910. The job would have been done - and done right - half a century sooner, with vastly less human misery, and with almost no bloodshed ... The only way slavery has ever been ended, anywhere, is by introducing industry ... If a man is a skilled and competent machinist - if the lathes work well under his hands - the industrial management will be forced, to remain in business, to accept that fact, whether the man be black, white, purple, or polka-dotted.\\"  According to Michael Moorcock, \\"He also, when faced with the Watts riots of the mid-sixties, seriously proposed and went on to proposing that there were 'natural' slaves who were unhappy if freed. I sat on a panel with him in 1965, as he pointed out that the worker bee when unable to work dies of misery, that the moujiks when freed went to their masters and begged to be enslaved again, that the ideals of the anti-slavers who fought in the Civil War were merely expressions of self-interest and that the blacks were 'against' emancipation, which was fundamentally why they were indulging in 'leaderless' riots in the suburbs of Los Angeles.\\"  On February 10, 1967, Campbell rejected Samuel R. Delaney's Nova a month before it was ultimately published, with a note and phone call to his agent explaining that he didn't feel his readership \\"would be able to relate to a black main character\\". There reputedly exists a letter from him to horror writer Dean Koontz in which Campbell argues that a technologically advanced black civilization would be a social and a biological impossibility. Question: What was Campbell's take on Slavery?. Whats the answer?","output":"John W. Campbell had a controversial take on slavery. He believed that it provided some benefits to the enslaved African people brought to the American South, as it gave them a higher standard of living than they had in Africa. Campbell also argued that the increasing mechanization of the 19th century would have rendered slavery obsolete in a few more years without the need of the Civil War. Moreover, he implied that there were 'natural' slaves who were unhappy when freed and equated them to worker bees who die of misery when unable to work. While these opinions are seen as highly controversial and racist, it does show that Campbell's take on slavery was not straightforward and his views might have been shaped by a need to spark debate or provoke thought."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

It is essential to address these feelings and evaluate various aspects before concluding that \\"It's just another worry on my mind that you are so occupied anyway.\\" 1. Empathy: Put yourself in the other person's shoes and try to understand why they might be so busy. They could be dealing with work, family, personal, or financial pressures that require their full attention. By empathizing, you may develop a more comprehensive understanding of their situation and perhaps alleviate some of your concerns. 2. Communication: Open communication is critical in such situations. Discuss your feelings with the person and let them know that their constant busyness is adding to your worries. Allow them to explain their circumstances and work together to establish a better understanding of each other's needs and expectations. 3. Boundaries: To effectively manage your concerns and maintain a healthy relationship, it is essential to establish and respect each other's boundaries. This can involve setting aside specific times for uninterrupted communication or creating a system where both parties know what to expect concerning the other's availability. 4. Support: Offer support where possible, which can include practical help with tasks or providing emotional support by listening and understanding their situation. Sometimes, just knowing that someone cares and is willing to lend a hand can alleviate stress and make the situation more manageable for both parties. 5. Self-Care: While it's natural to worry about someone else's well-being, don't forget to take care of yourself as well. Make sure you invest time in your hobbies, interests, and nurturing your mental and emotional health, ensuring you have the resources to cope with any worries that arise due to the other person's busyness. In conclusion, while it is valid to feel that having a busy person in your life adds another worry to your mind, it is essential to approach the situation with empathy, open communication, respect for boundaries, and mutual support. Taking care of yourself is a vital aspect of managing your worries and maintaining healthy relationships.

Step 2: Prepare the pan I would place the pan on the stovetop and turn on the heat to a medium setting. This ensures that the pan is preheated and ready for cooking. Step 3: Add oil to the pan Once the pan is heated, I would add the desired amount of oil (typically about 1-2 tablespoons) to the pan. This oil will serve as a lubricant to prevent the eggs from sticking to the pan while cooking. Step 4: Crack and beat the eggs While the oil is heating up in the pan, I would crack the desired number of eggs into the mixing bowl, being careful not to include any eggshell fragments. Using the whisk or a fork, I would beat the eggs until the yolks and whites are thoroughly combined. The beaten eggs will have a uniform color and consistency, promoting even cooking. Step 5: Mix the eggs and oil together Once the oil is hot and shimmering, I would carefully and slowly pour the beaten eggs into the pan with the oil, ensuring that the eggs are evenly spread out across the pan.  Step 6: Cook the eggs Using the spatula, I would gently stir the eggs in the pan, allowing the oil and eggs to mix together. As the eggs cook, they will start to solidify. I would continue to gently stir the eggs to ensure an even distribution of oil throughout the cooking process. Step 7: Turn off the heat and serve Once the eggs have reached the desired level of doneness, I would turn off the heat and, using the spatula, transfer the cooked eggs from the pan to a serving plate.

Water to my waist… a little more…. closer to the blue…..just a little more…water to my chest… yes, keep going…a bit more…water to my neck….almost there….the blue gaze of those depths held me in awe…oh my..so beaut- — Going up a sort of endless escalator. I can't see very well what's in front of me. It's all very dark. I can sense someone behind me, but I dare not look back. For some reason I cannot see my feet. In fact, I cannot see any of me at all. It feels very strange and …well,creepy! I want to whistle, to kinda comfort myself, but it feels like I've lost the ability to speak. My mind just doesn't know how to carry out this desire to speak.

The situation they were in was quite disorienting and unusual, with the transition from a peaceful pool scene to an unsettling escalator experience and then suddenly back to the pool. Their senses were being bombarded with contrasting elements, making it difficult to comprehend what was happening. Additionally, they felt creeped out at various moments, unable to see their body and feeling an eerie presence behind them on the escalator. Their desire to whistle or speak for comfort was impossible to achieve, further adding to their confusion and discomfort. When they were snapped back to the pool with people screaming and a hand reaching out, it was another abrupt shift in the situation. Just as they were about to grasp the hand, the alarm sounded, jolting them out of this experience. Not knowing the outcome of what would have happened next would undoubtedly leave them feeling confused and somewhat disoriented.

He played as a member of the Washington Wizards in an NBA game vs. the Philadelphia 76ers. Jordan, often considered the greatest basketball player of all time, had an illustrious career that spanned over almost two decades. Born on February 17, 1963, in Brooklyn, New York, Michael Jordan attended E.A. Laney High School in Wilmington, North Carolina, where he began his basketball journey. He then played college basketball for the University of North Carolina under the tutelage of Dean Smith. Known for his remarkable acumen and sheer talent, Jordan later joined the NBA in 1984 as the third overall pick for the Chicago Bulls. Michael Jordan's NBA career can be divided into three distinct phases: 1. First stint with the Chicago Bulls (1984-1993): Jordan played for the Chicago Bulls for almost a decade and led the league in scoring for 10 seasons. He catapulted the team to its first-ever NBA championship in 1991, eventually winning a \\"three-peat\\" with back-to-back championships in 1991, 1992, and 1993. 2. First retirement and brief stint in minor league baseball (1993-1995): In October 1993, Jordan shocked the world by announcing his first retirement from basketball. He declared his desire to pursue a career in professional baseball and signed a contract with the Chicago White Sox. After playing one season in the minor leagues, Jordan decided to return to basketball. 3. Second stint with the Chicago Bulls (1995-1998): Jordan rejoined the Chicago Bulls late in the 1994-95 season and led the team to another \\"three-peat\\" with NBA championships in 1996, 1997, and 1998. During this period, Jordan reestablished his dominance in the league and accomplished numerous records and milestones. 4. Second retirement and eventual return with the Washington Wizards (1998-2003): In January 1999, Jordan announced his second retirement from professional basketball. He later returned to the NBA as a part-owner and president of basketball operations for the Washington Wizards. However, in September 2001, Jordan stepped down from his executive positions to make a comeback as a player. He played two seasons with the Washington Wizards (2001-2003) before finally retiring for the third and final time.

Summarize: Media playback is not supported on this device The 45-year-old is among those being considered as a replacement for David Moyes after the Black Cats' relegation. \\"It just doesn't play a part to be honest,\\" he said before Saturday's game. \\"There's loads of speculation at this stage of the season.\\" McInnes would not be drawn on whether he would welcome an approach. \\"All my interest is on tomorrow's game and preparing the team,\\" he said. Aberdeen, who finished runners-up to Brendan Rodgers' side in the Scottish Premiership and lost to the Glasgow side in the League Cup, stand between Celtic and a fourth domestic treble. McInnes insisted that denying them their first such feat since 2001 was no extra incentive for him and his side. But he stated: \\"I think the level of player they have and the performances they've produced, anything other than a treble would be disappointing for them. \\"I think more Celtic teams should have won the treble in the last few years and, for whatever reason, they haven't.\\" \\"So, while we put ourselves under pressure to win, we've still had a very good season even if we lose tomorrow. \\"But we can have a brilliant season - a season to remember - and a special season by winning this tomorrow.\\" \\"The players are really relaxed and we are going into the game taking confidence from the performances we've had of late,\\" he said of a side that have won their last six games away from Pittodrie. \\"I feel we couldn't be more ready.\\" However, McInnes recognised the task ahead of his players if they are to end Celtic's season-long unbeaten domestic run. \\"We probably need a near-perfect performance from the majority,\\" he said.

However, McInnes stressed that he will have no qualms about fielding the 25-year-old in the final. \\"It's ridiculous to think he wouldn't be fully committed during tomorrow's game,\\" he added. \\"He's an Aberdeen boy and he'd love nothing more in his last game for Aberdeen to be a Scottish Cup winner. \\"There are a few in that boat who are moving and hopefully they can finish in a blaze of glory and be a winner at the end of it.\\"","output":"Aberdeen manager Derek McInnes dismisses speculation about being considered as a replacement for David Moyes.

Here are possible answers to this question: - sore feet - amazement - retrospection - boredom - crowding  I believe the correct choice is \\"crowding\\", here's why: A:","output":"When visiting a museum that has narrow halls, the most prominent experience or effect is likely to be crowding. While other factors, such as sore feet, amazement, retrospection, and boredom, may play a role in one's visit to the museum, crowding is the most directly related answer to the question. First, let's examine how crowding can occur in a museum with narrow halls. When a museum is designed with narrow hallways or exhibition spaces, the limited space can cause people to congregate more closely together. This is especially true during peak museum attendance hours, such as weekends or special exhibitions. The narrow halls provide less space for individuals to explore displays and take in the artwork, thereby contributing to larger crowds forming in the confined areas. Now let's look at the other possible answers: 1. Sore feet: While standing or walking for extended periods may result in sore feet when visiting a museum, this issue is not necessarily unique to museums with narrow halls, and can occur in any museum or exhibition space. 2. Amazement: Experiencing amazement when visiting a museum usually depends on one's personal taste in art and the museum's specific exhibits, rather than the physical design of the building. One may feel amazement in a museum with wide halls, narrow halls, or even outdoor sculpture gardens. 3. Retrospection: Retrospection, or contemplating the past, may occur when viewing historical artifacts or works of art at a museum. However, like amazement, this experience is more related to the content of the museum and the individual's engagement with the exhibits rather than the specific design of the facility. 4. Boredom: Boredom, again, is a highly subjective experience that depends more on the individual's interest or connection with the museum's content than the design of the museum itself. In conclusion, the most suitable answer to the question \\"What happens when visiting a museum that has narrow halls?\\" is crowding. The restricted space created by the narrow halls causes visitors to cluster more closely together, leading to the experience of crowding, which differs from the other possible answers, as they are more related to the emotional and physical reactions that can take place in any museum or gallery, regardless of the architectural design."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

If the question isn't answerable, please output \\"Can't answer\\". Question: To whom does the LK lander belong? Title: Apollo 18 Movie plot: In December 1974, the crew of the cancelled Apollo 18 mission is informed that it will now proceed as a top secret Department of Defense (DoD) mission disguised as a satellite launch. Commander Nathan Walker, Lieutenant Colonel John Grey, and Captain Ben Anderson are launched toward the Moon to place detectors to alert the United States of any impending ICBM attacks from the USSR. Grey remains in orbit aboard the Freedom command module while Walker and Anderson land on the moon in the lunar module Liberty. While planting one of the detectors, the pair take moon rock samples. After returning to Liberty, the pair hear noises outside and a camera captures a small rock moving nearby. Houston claims the noises are interference from the ICBM detectors. Anderson finds a rock sample on the floor of Liberty despite having secured the samples. During further lunar exploration they discover footprints that lead them to a bloodstained, functioning Soviet LK lander, and a dead cosmonaut in a nearby crater. Walker queries Houston about the Soviet presence, but he is told only to continue with the mission. The following day the pair find that the flag they had planted is missing. Their mission complete, the crew prepares to leave, but the launch is aborted when Liberty suffers violent shaking. An inspection reveals extensive damage to Liberty and non-human tracks that Walker cites as evidence of extraterrestrial life. Walker feels something moving inside his spacesuit and is horrified as a spider-like creature crawls across the inside of his helmet. Walker disappears from view and Anderson finds him unconscious outside of Liberty. Walker later denies the events. A wound is discovered on Walker's chest; Anderson removes a moon rock embedded within him. The pair find themselves unable to contact Houston or Grey due to increased levels of interference from an unknown source. Anderson speculates that the true intention of the ICBM warning devices is to monitor the aliens, and that the devices are the source of the interference,...

I have a new situation: Two cities, Appleton and Orangeburg, are approximately 100 miles apart and are currently experiencing different weather. Appleton is windy and cloudy, but Orangeburg has very calm air but is also cloudy.  But I can use this background: Electrons can be removed from some objects using friction, simply by rubbing one substance against another substance. There are many examples of objects becoming charged by friction, including a rubber comb through hair, and a balloon on a sweater. In both these instances, the electrons move from the second object to the first, causing the first object to become negatively charged and the second one positively charged. Friction between the tires on a moving car and the road cause the tires to become charged, and wind causes friction between clouds and air which causes clouds to become charged and can result in tremendous bolts of lightning.  What is an answer for this question: Are the clouds in Appleton positively or negatively charged?","output":"Based on the background information provided, we know that friction can cause objects like clouds to become charged. Wind can cause friction between clouds and the air, leading to a transfer of electrons. In your situation, Appleton has windy and cloudy weather.  While friction is definitely playing a role in the charging of clouds in Appleton, it is challenging to definitively state if the clouds are positively or negatively charged. The charge depends on the specific materials involved in the friction process and the direction in which the electrons are transferred. Unfortunately, this information is not available in the provided scenario. However, a generic concept related to thunderstorm development could provide some insights. Usually, as a thunderstorm develops, the lower part of the cloud becomes negatively charged while the upper part becomes positively charged. This has to do with particle collisions and vertical air movements in the storm. Nonetheless, it is still important to note that without specific information on the types of cloud and the material involved in the friction process, it is impossible to conclude whether the clouds in Appleton are positively or negatively charged."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.
