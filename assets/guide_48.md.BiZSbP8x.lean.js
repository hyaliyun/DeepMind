From these scenarios, we can set up the following equations based on the total amount needed to buy the sheep: - In the first scenario, the total amount needed is equal to the amount contributed by each person (5 coins) times the number of people (x) plus the shortfall (45 coins).

Since these pieces are missing from the total, we can express the total number of pieces that were originally present as 3P + 15. However, we know that in a standard chess set, there are: - 2 rooks per player - 2 knights per player - 2 bishops per player - 1 queen per player - 1 king per player - 8 pawns per player This totals to 2 + 2 + 2 + 1 + 1 + 8 = 16 pieces per player in a standard set.

The equatorial cut, when transformed, spans the whole circumference and thus transforms the torus into a flat band or a cylinder when laid flat.    3. **Examining the Second Snail's Path**:    - The second snail travels along a helical path on the torus. After the transformation into a flat cylinder, the path of the second snail intersects the boundaries of this cylinder.    - Upon the flattening, visualize the path of the second snail cutting the cylinder in a way that forms a spiral (helical) path crossing the surface multiple times. 4. **Determine the Number of Cuts by the Second Snail**:    - Each full 360-degree loop (helix) by the second snail from bottom to top must intersect the cylindrical surface at least twice on each wrap around.    - However, as the snail travels around and back to starting position, the flattened paths on the cylindrical representation will be three distinct helical cuts inside the boundaries. 5. **Identifying the Cycles/Sections Created**:    - These three helical cuts will intersect the cylindrical surface in such manner that the clear divides the cylinder into three distinct regions.     - Each intersection line effectively separates a contiguous segment creating a series of partitions. 6. **Conclusion**:    - Geometrically, the helical path intersects at three points, translating the cylindrical section into three distinct parts.

The outcomes are straightforward: one player wins (1 point), one loses (0 points). Hence, ( C_1^0 = 1 ) and ( C_1^1 = 1 ).      - **Inductive step:** Assume the claim is true for some ( n ).

An equilateral triangle has three axes of symmetry, but none of these axes are perpendicular to one another.     - Let us examine whether the theorem holds under these conditions. 3. **Equilateral Triangle Properties**:     - **Axes of Symmetry**: An equilateral triangle has three mirror symmetry axes. Each axis passes through one vertex and the midpoint of the opposite side.     - **Angles Between Symmetry Axes**: In an equilateral triangle, the angles between any two symmetry axes are 120^circ, not 90^circ. 4. **Implication of Non-Perpendicular Axes**:     - The initial theorem assumes perpendicular axes of symmetry. If these axes are not perpendicular (as in the equilateral triangle case), the conditions of the theorem are not met.     - Therefore, this change in the condition (non-perpendicular symmetry axes) may invalidate the theorem if its proof fundamentally depends on such orthogonality. 5. **Conclusion**:     - Since an equilateral triangle is an example where the axes of symmetry are not perpendicular, and the behavior and properties change significantly, the theorem from the previous problem would not necessarily remain true under these new conditions.

For ( n = 9 ):       - Each person knows exactly 5 others (to avoid contradictions in steps 3 and 4).       - The total number of friend pairs is:       [       frac{9 times 5}{2} = 22.5 quad (text{not an integer})       ]       - This implies difficulties in pair distributions without contradictions. 7. **Conclusion**:    [    text{The largest } n text{ satisfying the conditions is } boxed{8}    ]"},{"instruction":"w much older is the 3rd fastest dog than the 2nd fastest dog if the average age of the 1st and 5th fastest dogs is 18 years old, the 1st fastest dog is 10 years old, the 2nd fastest dog is 2 years younger than the first fastest dog, the 3rd fastest dog is 4 years older than the 2nd fastest dog, the 4th fastest dog is half the age of the 3rd fastest dog, and the 5th fastest dog is 20 years older than the 4th fastest dog?","output":"Let's break down the information given step by step: 1.

If one such triangle is acute-angled, the statement is trivial because the only triangle we consider is already acute-angled. 2. **Inductive Step: Assume True for n-k**    Suppose the statement is true for any n-gon for n geqslant 3 up to k, i.e., for an (n-1)-gon there are at least n-3 acute-angled triangles. We need to show it is also true for an n-gon. 3. **Choosing and Removing Vertices:**    Let us fix an acute-angled triangle A_p A_q A_r in our n-gon. We will consider the removal of a vertex A_k which is not one of A_p, A_q, A_r.

First Approach: 1. Assume, for contradiction, that the center (O) of the frying pan lies outside the convex pancake (B). 2. Since (B) is convex, for any point outside (B), there exists a line through that point that does not intersect (B) (this is a property of convex figures).  3. Let us draw such a line through (O). This line divides the frying pan into two halves. 4. Since (O) is outside (B) and the line does not intersect (B), (B) must lie entirely in one of these two halves. 5. Each half of the frying pan has an area of (frac{1}{2}). 6. Therefore, if (B) lies entirely within one half, its area cannot exceed (frac{1}{2}), since the maximum area that can fit in one half is (frac{1}{2}). 7. This contradicts the given condition that the area of (B) is greater than (frac{1}{2}). Hence, our initial assumption that (O) lies outside (B) must be false. Therefore, the center (O) must be under the pancake (B).  Second Approach: 1. Suppose again, for contradiction, that the center (O) of the frying pan lies outside the convex pancake (B). 2. Consider a point (A) on the boundary of (B). 3. Every point on (B) has a corresponding symmetric point relative to (O). Denote this symmetric point as (A'). Since (O) is outside (B), the symmetric image of (A) with respect to (O) will lie outside (B).  4. These symmetric points form a new figure (B'), which is the symmetric image of (B) with respect to (O). 5. Because (O) lies outside (B), none of the points of (B') can lie within (B), as that would contradict the convex nature and the symmetry about (O). 6. Hence, (B) and (B') do not overlap. They are disjoint, meaning their combined area would be (2 times text{Area}(B)). 7. Given that (text{Area}(B) > frac{1}{2}), the combined area ( text{Area}(B) + text{Area}(B') > 1).

Let's denote the vertices of the pentagon as ( A_1, A_2, A_3, A_4, A_5 ). 2. **Translation of Lines:**    We translate each of the lines that form the sides of the pentagon outward by 4 units in a direction parallel to itself. This operation effectively enlarges the pentagon by a consistent margin around its perimeter. 3. **Constructing Perpendicular Rays:**    At each vertex of the original pentagon, we draw rays perpendicular to each adjacent side and extend these rays outward. These rays, being perpendicular to the sides, are naturally parallel to each other in pairs. 4. **Consideration of Angles:**    For each vertex of the pentagon, consider the angle formed by the perpendicular rays and the angles between the sides of the pentagon. If we denote the internal angle at vertex (A_i) of the pentagon as (theta_i), the complete angle around (A_i) is (360^circ). From these, subtract the internal angle (theta_i) of the pentagon and the two right angles ((90^circ) each) made by the perpendicular rays.

Because the sum of the internal angles of a pentagon is (540^circ):    [    sum_{i=1}^{5} theta_i = 540^circ    ]    The remaining angles sum to:    [    sum_{i=1}^{5} (180^circ - theta_i) = 5 times 180^circ - 540^circ = 360^circ    ] 5. **Creating New Shapes:**    When the lines are translated outwards, they form new intersections which create a combination of five new rectangles and five kite-like (deltoid) shapes around the original pentagon. 6. **Calculating the Added Area:**    Let's calculate the total area of the newly added regions:        - The added rectangles are easy to calculate. Each rectangle has its length equal to the side of the pentagon and width equal to 4 units.    - The deltoid shape can be analyzed by splitting it into simpler geometric sections. However, let's focus on using another simpler method:     7. **Area of Circular Segments:**    We'll consider circular segments at each vertex, which are parts of circles with 4-unit radii. These segments fit perfectly around the pentagon, thus effectively creating an additional complete circle.       8. **Summing Areas:**    Since four such segments around each vertex add up to a complete circle:    [    text{Total area of circular segments} = pi times 4^2 = 16pi    ]    Using the approximation (pi approx 3.14):    [    16pi > 16 times 3.14 = 50.24    ] 9. **Conclusion:**    Given the total added area includes at least the area of this circle formed by (16pi), which exceeds 50, we conclude that the new pentagon's area is increased by more than 50 square units.

In that case: sin{alpha} = -frac{1}{2} cdot 1 = -frac{1}{2} Again, since alpha is an acute angle, we look for its value in the first quadrant and take the absolute value of the sine: alpha = sin^{-1}{left( left| -frac{1}{2} right| right)} = 30^{circ} Once again, this answer is incorrect. To resolve this issue, let's return to the original equation and square both sides: left( frac{1}{2} right)^2 = (sin{alpha})^2 frac{1}{4} = sin^2{alpha} Now, solving for alpha, we have: alpha = sin^{-1}{left( sqrt{frac{1}{4}} right)} alpha = sin^{-1}{left( frac{sqrt{2}}{2} right)} Since alpha is an acute angle, we look for its value in the first quadrant: alpha = 45^{circ} Therefore, the correct answer is: boxed{C: 45^{circ}}"},{"instruction":"For which triangles does the following inequality hold, where ( S ) is the centroid of triangle ( ABC ) and ( r ) is the radius of its circumscribed circle: [ S A^{2}+S B^{2}+S C^{2}> frac{8 r^{2}}{3} ]","output":"1. **Determine Conditions for Inequality to Hold:**    We begin by verifying if the inequality     [    SA^2 + SB^2 + SC^2 > frac{8r^2}{3}    ]     holds for various types of triangles. 2. **Regular (Equilateral) Triangle:**    - For an equilateral triangle, we observe that each side is equal, and hence the distances from the centroid (S) to the vertices (A), (B), and (C) are equal and given by ( frac{2}{3} times text{altitude} ).    - The altitude of an equilateral triangle with side length (a) is (frac{sqrt{3}}{2}a), thus the distance from the centroid to each vertex is:      [      frac{2}{3} times frac{sqrt{3}}{2}a = frac{sqrt{3}}{3}a = frac{sqrt{3}}{3} times 2r = frac{2sqrt{3}r}{3}      ]    - Therefore, for each side:      [      SA^2 = SB^2 = SC^2 = left(frac{2sqrt{3}r}{3}right)^2 = frac{4r^2}{3}      ]    - Summing these, we get:      [      SA^2 + SB^2 + SC^2 = 3 times frac{4r^2}{3} = 4r^2      ]    - Clearly, ( 4r^2 > frac{8r^2}{3} ). 3. **Right-Angled Triangle:**    - For a right-angled triangle, the centroid coordinates are well-known and the distances from the centroid to each vertex can be expressed in similar terms involving the legs and the hypotenuse. Let's consider a right-angled triangle with legs (a) and (b) and hypotenuse (c).    - Express the distances:      [      SA^2 = frac{1}{9}(2b^2 + 2left(frac{a^2}{4}right) - left(frac{c^2}{4}right))      ]    - Simplifying the square sum of median lengths of the right triangle:      [      frac{4}{9}(b^2 + frac{a^2}{4} + a^2 + frac{b^2}{4}) = frac{2}{3}c^2      ]    - Since the circumradius ( r = frac{c}{2} ), we have:      [      frac{2}{3}c^2 = frac{8}{3} left(frac{c}{2}right)^2 = frac{8r^2}{3}      ]    - This shows the inequality does **not** hold. 4. **Various Other Triangle Types:**    - Similar logic applies to obtuse-angled triangles where the squared distances from the centroid to the vertices will not sufficiently exceed the radius-related comparison as in equilateral triangles. 5. **Verification in Acute-Angled Triangles:**    - For general acute triangles, the squared distance sum (SA^2 + SB^2 + SC^2) (using the well-known relation of medians and sides) reduces to:      [      frac{1}{3}(a^2 + b^2 + c^2) > frac{4r^2}{3}(sin^2 alpha + sin^2 beta + sin^2 gamma)      ]    - For maximum values in acute cases, geometric properties ensure ( sin^2 alpha + sin^2 beta + sin^2 gamma > 2 ). 6. **Conclusion Based on Derived Conditions:**    - Using trigonometric properties and cosine product, the cosine product inequality must hold:      [      cos alpha cos beta cos gamma > 0      ]    - This is true precisely when all angles are acute (all cosine values are positive). Thus, we conclude that the inequality holds **if and only if** the triangle is acute-angled.

Suppose Mark has already rolled ( k ) unique numbers, where ( 1 leq k leq 5 ).

We're interested in finding subsets Asubseteq U that adhere to the given conditions. 1. **Dealing with Even Numbers**: Consider any even number xin P_{n}. We can represent x as mcdot 2^{k}, where m is an odd number and kin mathbb{N}^{*}. This is achieved by repeatedly dividing x by 2 until we get an odd quotient, m. This process ensures that every even number can be uniquely associated with an odd number in this way. 2. **Relation Between x and m in A**: Based on the conditions:    - If min A, then x can only be in A if k is even.    - If mnotin A, then x can only be in A if k is odd.        Therefore, the membership of x in A depends directly on whether m is in A and the parity of k. 3. **Considering Q_{n}**: Let Q_{n} be the set of all odd numbers in P_{n}. The key insight is that the decision to include or exclude an odd number m in/from A determines the inclusion/exclusion of all even numbers that can be expressed as mcdot 2^{k}. Thus, the number of subsets A that satisfy all conditions is equivalent to the number of ways to pick odd numbers to include in A, which is the number of subsets of Q_{n}. 4. **Calculating f(n)**: The function f(n), representing the number of subsets of Q_{n}, depends on whether n is even or odd:    - If n is even, the number of odd numbers in P_{n} is frac{n}{2}, so f(n)={2}^{frac{n}{2}}.    - If n is odd, the number of odd numbers in P_{n} is frac{n+1}{2}, thus f(n)={2}^{frac{n+1}{2}}. 5. **Applying to P_{10}**: Given P_{10}={1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10}, and since 10 is even, we use the formula for even n:    [    f(10) = {2}^{frac{10}{2}} = {2}^{5} = 32    ] Thus, the number of sets A that satisfy all three conditions simultaneously is boxed{32}, which corresponds to choice C."},{"instruction":"Alexis has four times as many mangoes as Dilan and Ashley combined.

A: 1 B: 1 C: 3 D: 3","output":"Since α = 2kπ - frac{π}{5}, we know that angle α is in the fourth quadrant because 2kπ (k being an integer) is a full revolution either clockwise or counterclockwise, and -frac{π}{5} places the terminal side of the angle within the fourth quadrant. For an angle θ in the fourth quadrant, the following trigonometric sign properties are true: - sin θ < 0, because the sine of an angle is the y-coordinate on the unit circle, which is negative in the fourth quadrant. - cos θ > 0, because the cosine of an angle is the x-coordinate on the unit circle, which is positive in the fourth quadrant. - tan θ < 0, because the tangent of an angle is the ratio of the sine to the cosine, and since they have opposite signs in the fourth quadrant, the tangent is negative. Therefore, evaluating the original expression for y with these sign considerations, we have: begin{align*} y &= frac{sin θ}{|sin theta|} + frac{|cos θ|}{cos theta} + frac{tan θ}{|tan theta|}    &= frac{-sin θ}{|-sin θ|} + frac{|cos θ|}{cos θ} + frac{-tan θ}{|- tan θ|}    &= frac{-sin θ}{sin θ} + frac{cos θ}{cos θ} + frac{-tan θ}{tan θ}    &= -1 + 1 - 1    &= boxed{-1}. end{align*} Therefore, the correct choice is boxed{B}.

We need to find all such triples ((a, b, c)) that satisfy this condition. 2. Asymptotically, ( S_r(n) ) grows like ( frac{n^{r+1}}{r+1} ). This is derived from the fact that the sum of the first ( n ) ( r )-th powers can be approximated by the integral:    [    int_1^n x^r , dx = left[ frac{x^{r+1}}{r+1} right]_1^n = frac{n^{r+1}}{r+1} - frac{1^{r+1}}{r+1} approx frac{n^{r+1}}{r+1}    ]    for large ( n ). 3.

From the two equations ( a + 1 = c(b + 1) ) and ( a + 1 = (b + 1)^c ), we get:    [    c(b + 1) = (b + 1)^c    ]    Dividing both sides by ( b + 1 ) (assuming ( b + 1 neq 0 )), we get:    [    c = (b + 1)^{c-1}    ] 7.

For ( c = 1 ):    [    1 = (b + 1)^0 = 1    ]    This is always true, and from ( a + 1 = c(b + 1) ), we get ( a = b ). Thus, the nice triples are ( (k, k, 1) ) for any positive rational ( k ). 9. For ( c neq 1 ):    [    c = (b + 1)^{c-1}    ]    Since ( b + 1 ) must be an integer, let ( b + 1 = k ) where ( k ) is an integer.

The problem states that the time it takes for person A to process 25 components is the same as the time it takes for person B to process 20 components. We can express this relationship as a ratio of components to time, which gives us the equation: [ frac{25}{x+2} = frac{20}{x} ] To solve for x, we cross-multiply: [ 25x = 20(x + 2) ] Expanding the equation: [ 25x = 20x + 40 ] Subtracting 20x from both sides: [ 5x = 40 ] Dividing both sides by 5: [ x = 8 ] After solving the equation, we find that x = 8.

Finally, ( T ) is called balanced if the average of the elements of ( T ) is a median number of ( T ). Show that the number of nonempty balanced subsets of ({1, ldots, n}) is odd.","output":"\`\`\`markdown 1. **Understanding the Problem**:    Given a strictly positive integer n and a non-empty subset T subset {1, ldots, n}, a number m is called a median of T if there are as many elements of T less than or equal to m as there are elements of T greater than or equal to m.        The subset T is called balanced if the mean of the elements of T is a median of T. We aim to show that the number of non-empty balanced subsets of {1, ldots, n} is odd. 2. **Mean and Median of Balanced Sets**:    To illustrate the concept, let's consider the set {1, n}. The mean is frac{1 + n}{2}, which also serves as the median since there are exactly as many elements (one in this case) above and below frac{n+1}{2}. Hence, this subset is balanced. 3. **Formation of Balanced Subsets**:    We need to construct these balanced subsets. For a fixed n, given a subset A subset {1, ldots, n}, let's define the set n + 1 - A as {n + 1 - k mid k in A}. For instance, if A = {1, 2, 3}, then n + 1 - A = {n-2, n-1, n}.    If A is a balanced subset of {1, ldots, n}, then n + 1 - A must be balanced too. 4. **Arithmetic Mean of Transformed Sets**:    Let a_1 < ldots < a_r be the elements of A, with m being the arithmetic mean of these elements.        The arithmetic mean hat{m} of the elements of n + 1 - A is:    [    hat{m} = frac{(n+1-a_1) + ldots + (n+1-a_r)}{r} = frac{r(n+1) - (a_1 + ldots + a_r)}{r} = n+1 - m     ]        Additionally, if a geq m, then n+1-a leq hat{m}, and vice versa. This ensures that n+1-A is balanced if A is balanced. 5. **Pairing Balanced Sets**:    The idea is to pair A and n+1-A. Notably, n+1-(n+1-A) = A. Hence, we can partition the set of balanced subsets into pairs: {A, n+1-A}.     An important observation is that the set P = {A subset {1, ldots, n}, A neq n+1-A} can be partitioned into pairs, so |P| is even. 6. **Counting Palindromic Sets**:    We need to determine the remaining balanced sets, where A = n+1-A, called palindromic sets. For such a set A, if k in A, then n+1-k in A, making frac{n+1}{2} a median and mean of A. 7. **Number of Palindromic Sets**:    Each palindromic set is determined by whether or not specific pairs are included from:    [    mathcal{F} = left{{1, n}, {2, n-1}, ldots, left{leftlfloor frac{n+1}{2}rightrfloor, leftlceil frac{n+1}{2}rightrceilright} right}    ]    Each pair can be either included or excluded independently, leading to (2^{leftlfloor frac{n+1}{2}rightrfloor}) combinations. Excluding the empty set gives us:    [    2^{leftlfloor frac{n+1}{2}rightrfloor} - 1     ] 8. **Conclusion**:    Since the number of palindromic sets is always odd (because (2^x - 1) is odd for any integer x), and the remainder of the balanced subsets forming pairs {A, n+1-A} is even, the total number of non-empty balanced subsets of {1, ldots, n}) is odd.

Each room is either inhabited by a liar or a knight. Knights always tell the truth, and liars always lie. Each person states that \\"At least one of the neighboring rooms has a liar.\\" 2. **Identifying key constraints**:    - If a knight says that at least one neighboring room has a liar, then that statement must be true.    - If a liar says that at least one neighboring room has a liar, then that statement must be false, implying all their neighbors are knights. 3. **Considering pairs of rooms**:    Note that two neighboring rooms cannot both be inhabited by liars because if they were, they would both be telling the truth saying that they have a liar as a neighbor, which contradicts their nature as liars. Therefore, at most one room in each pair of neighboring rooms can be a liar. 4. **Maximizing the number of liars**:    - We take advantage of color-coding the 4 times 4 grid like a chessboard with alternating colors (black and white squares). Since each color covers half the grid, each will have 8 rooms.    - To satisfy the condition that every room that contains a person says that at least one neighboring room is a liar, we need to place liars and knights such that their statements fit this condition perfectly. 5. **Placing the liars and knights**:    - Consider placing all liars (maximum possible number) in rooms of one color (say black), and all knights in the other color (say white). This satisfies the scenario described. Each liar (in black rooms) will have only knight neighbors, but the knight neighbors will ensure the liars' statements (lies) are false. Each knight (in white rooms), when stating the existence of a neighboring liar, is truthful. 6. **Verification of the solution**:    - By arranging the grid as described with liars and knights in alternative pattern colors, we cover all rooms once.    - Each liar’s statement (in black rooms) that there’s at least one neighboring liar will be false, satisfying the liar’s nature.    - Each knight (in white rooms) will truthfully state that they have a liar neighboring them, thus satisfying the knight’s nature.

This step avoids the division by zero issue and simplifies the inequality to:    [    x(x-1) lt 0    ] 2. **Solve the Quadratic Inequality**: To find when the product x(x-1) is less than zero, we identify the roots of the equation x(x-1) = 0, which are x = 0 and x = 1. These roots divide the number line into intervals. We test each interval to see where the product is negative:    - For x < 0, both x and (x-1) are negative, so their product is positive.    - For 0 < x < 1, x is positive but (x-1) is negative, making their product negative.    - For x > 1, both x and (x-1) are positive, so their product is positive.    Therefore, the product x(x-1) is negative only in the interval (0, 1). 3. **Write the Solution Set**: The solution set of the inequality frac{{x-1}}{x} lt 0 is the interval where the product x(x-1) is negative, which is (0, 1). Therefore, the solution set of the inequality is boxed{(0,1)}. **Explanation**: This step-by-step solution demonstrates how to convert a fractional inequality into a quadratic inequality to find the solution set directly. It's a straightforward approach that involves identifying the intervals where the product of the terms is negative. **Review**: This question tests the understanding of solving fractional inequalities, which is a fundamental skill in algebra. It requires knowledge of how to manipulate inequalities and understand the implications of multiplying both sides by an expression."},{"instruction":"the new budget, the price of kerosene oil rose by some percentage. A person must reduce his consumption by 20% so that his expenditure on it does not increase. By how much percent did the price of kerosene oil rise?","output":"Let's assume the original price of kerosene oil is P per unit and the person originally consumes C units. So, the original expenditure is P * C. Now, the price of kerosene oil rises by x percent. Therefore, the new price of kerosene oil is P + (x/100) * P = P * (1 + x/100). The person reduces his consumption by 20%, so the new consumption is C - (20/100) * C = C * (1 - 20/100) = C * 0.8. The person's expenditure should not increase, so the original expenditure is equal to the new expenditure: P * C = (P * (1 + x/100)) * (C * 0.8) Now, we can solve for x: 1 = (1 + x/100) * 0.8 1 = 0.8 + 0.8x/100 1 = 0.8 + 0.008x 0.2 = 0.008x x = 0.2 / 0.008 x = 25 Therefore, the price of kerosene oil rose by boxed{25}  percent."},{"instruction":"Collin learned that he could earn 0.25 per aluminum can that he brought into the recycling center.

We know that he has to put 43 into savings, which represents half of his entire earnings. Therefore, the total amount he earned is twice that, which is 43 * 2 = 86. Now, let's calculate how many cans Collin collected in total to earn 86. Since he earns 0.25 per can, we divide the total amount earned by the amount earned per can: 86 / 0.25 = 344 cans. We know the number of cans he collected from different sources except his grandparents' house: - At home: 12 cans - Neighbor: 46 cans - Dad's office: 250 cans Let's add these up to find out how many cans he collected from these three sources: 12 + 46 + 250 = 308 cans. Now, let's subtract this number from the total number of cans to find out how many cans he collected from his grandparents' house: 344 cans (total) - 308 cans (known sources) = 36 cans from his grandparents' house. Finally, we need to find the ratio of the number of cans found at his grandparents' house to the number of cans found at home. The number of cans from his grandparents' house is 36, and the number of cans from home is 12. The ratio is 36 (grandparents' house) : 12 (home). To simplify the ratio, we divide both numbers by the greatest common divisor, which is 12: 36 / 12 : 12 / 12 = 3 : 1. So, the ratio of the number of cans found at his grandparents' house to the number of cans found at home is boxed{3:1} ."},{"instruction":"The measure of angle ACB is 70 degrees.

Let X be the midpoint of segment EC. Then we have:     MX = frac{BE}{2}      3. Using the property of cevians in a triangle:    - A cevian (such as AM or MX) must be less than or equal to one of the sides of the triangle originating from the same vertex.  4. From the given condition BE geq 2AM, we have:     MX geq AM  5. Since AM < AC and MX < MC, it follows that M must lie within the limits set by these distances.

To verify by contradiction:    7.1 Assume that angle A is not obtuse. The center O of the circumscribed circle around triangle ABC would then either lie on BC or on the opposite side of A relative to BC. Applying the triangle inequalities in this scenario, we get a contradiction:     2AM geq 2AO = OB + OC geq BC > BE     This contradicts the given condition since BE geq 2AM was assumed. 8.

According to the problem, 27% of these female officers were on duty. So, the number of female officers on duty can be represented as 0.27F. The problem also states that the ratio of male to female officers on duty is 4:3. This means that for every 4 male officers on duty, there are 3 female officers on duty. If we let M represent the number of male officers on duty, then we can express the number of female officers on duty as (3/4)M, because for every 4 males, there are 3 females. We know that the total number of officers on duty is 275, which is the sum of male and female officers on duty. So we can write the equation: M + 0.27F = 275 We also know that the number of female officers on duty is (3/4)M, so we can substitute this into the equation: M + (3/4)M = 275 Now, let's solve for M: (4/4)M + (3/4)M = 275 (7/4)M = 275 M = 275 * (4/7) M = 1100/7 M = 157.14 (approximately) Since the number of male officers must be a whole number, we can round M to 157.

Let the tangents from ( A ) and ( B ) intersect at point ( M ). We are to determine the geometric locus of points ( M ) as ( x ) varies from ( 0 ) to ( b ). 1. **Assessing Properties of Tangents**:    - Tangents drawn to a circle from an external point are equal in length.    - Tangents from ( A ) and ( B ) to the circle centered at ( O ) will meet to form point ( M ), whose properties we need to derive. 2. **Angle Bisector Theorem**:    - The line segment ( MO ) will bisect the angle formed by the tangents, due to symmetry of tangents at the meeting point ( M ).    - In the triangle ( AMB ), the line segment ( OM ) serves as the internal angle bisector. 3. **Applying Angle Bisector Properties**:    - By the Angle Bisector Theorem, the distances from ( M ) to points ( A ) and ( B ) will be proportional to the lengths ( AO ) and ( OB ):      [      frac{MA}{MB} = frac{AO}{OB} = frac{a}{b}      ] 4. **Apollonius Circle**:    - The constant ratio ( frac{MA}{MB} ) denotes that ( M ) lies on the Apollonius circle of points ( A ) and ( B ) that maintains the ratio ( frac{a}{b} ).    - The Apollonius circle of two points ( A ) and ( B ) with ratio ( frac{a}{b} ) divides the plane into two distinct regions.

After placing the order, Ivan Ivanovich received a message from another company (the delivery service), stating that the laptop and headphones would be delivered on different days with about a oneweek interval: first the headphones, then the laptop. The buyer has the option to return any purchased item even after receiving it (under the return conditions). (a) Explain why, with free delivery, it might be beneficial for the delivery service to deliver items from one order on different days? This delivery policy is used by many large logistics companies delivering goods to end customers. (b) If the buyer has the option to return any purchased item after receiving it, how can the company selling the office equipment limit the buyer's desire to keep the free headphones while returning the laptop? Provide an example of a mechanism the company should use to achieve this and explain how it works on the buyer.","output":"**(a)** There are several reasons why it might be beneficial for a delivery company to deliver items from a single order on different days. We will consider a few factors that might contribute to this decision: 1. **Different Arrival Times of Goods at the Warehouse**: Products ordered from an online store may arrive at the warehouse at different times. For example, the headphones may arrive at the warehouse earlier than the laptop. 2. **Different Suppliers Located in Various Geographical Areas**: The suppliers of the headphones and the laptop might be located in different cities or regions. Hence, the items are received at different times. 3. **Warehouses Located in Different Areas**: The online store's warehouses, where different items are stored, may be situated in various parts of the city or region. Consequently, consolidating all items to a single location before delivery may not be efficient. Additionally, the costs associated with storing each product in warehouses and the logistics involved in combining all items from a customer's order into a single delivery can be significant. It might be more cost-effective to deliver the items on different days. Large items like office equipment may occupy a lot of space and may require special transportation conditions. Hence, bulky items may be inconvenient to deliver alongside smaller items, and smaller items might be cheaper to deliver separately. **(b)** The company selling office equipment can adopt a mechanism to prevent the customer from keeping the free headphones and returning the laptop. Here is an example mechanism and its principle of operation: 1. **Price Segmentation**: The company can split the price of the items into two parts on the invoice. For example, list the price of the headphones as 15,000 RUB and the price of the laptop as 115,000 RUB. When delivering these items on separate days, the purchaser will receive a receipt for the corresponding amount split - as specified in the invoice for the delivered item. If the payment was not completed before the delivery of the headphones, then the customer will need to pay the specified amount upon receiving the headphones. Thus, if the headphones are delivered first and the customer chooses to return the laptop, they will have already paid 15,000 RUB for the headphones. This mechanism disincentivizes the customer from returning the laptop once the headphones are received, as the discount associated with the combined purchase becomes more apparent. In conclusion, by billing the customer distinctly for each part of the order, the company ensures that the customer has little financial incentive to return part of the order.

Consider an equilateral triangle ABC with side length a inscribed in a circle. 3. Let P be a point on the circumcircle of ABC such that P lies on the arc BC that does not contain A. 4. Extend the distance PB to intersect the circle again at point D such that PD = PB. Consequently, triangle PBD is an equilateral triangle, which means PB = PD. 5. Note that AB = AC and the angle angle PAB = angle PCB because both angles subtend equal arcs by the property of the circle. 6. Therefore, triangle ADB cong triangle CPB by the Side-Angle-Side (SAS) criterion since AB = CB and angle ABD = angle ACB. 7. As a result, we have the congruence AD = PC. Adding the distances PD = PB to both sides, we get:    [    AD + PD = PC + PB    ] 8. Simplifying the terms, we find:    [    AP = PC + PB    ] 9.

Setting up the equation with the initial amount of alcohol plus the added alcohol equal to the amount of alcohol in the final solution, we get: 1.8 + x = 0.50 * (6 + x) Now, let's solve for x: 1.8 + x = 3 + 0.50x x - 0.50x = 3 - 1.8 0.50x = 1.2 x = 1.2 / 0.50 x = 2.4 So, 2.4 liters of pure alcohol must be added to the 6-liter solution to produce a solution that is boxed{50%}  alcohol."},{"instruction":"the life safety theme education activity, in order to understand the mastery of life safety knowledge among students in schools A, B, C, and D, Xiao Li formulated the following plan.

Now, let's calculate the cost of the cherries for the cherry pie. She needs a four-pound bag for 14, so the cost for the cherries is 14. Next, we add the cost of sugar and eggs and butter for both pies, which is 1 + 1.5 = 2.5. Now, let's compare the total cost of each pie: For the blueberry pie: Cost of blueberries + Cost of sugar and eggs and butter = 13.50 + 2.5 = 16. For the cherry pie: Cost of cherries + Cost of sugar and eggs and butter = 14 + 2.5 = 16.5. Since the total price to make the cheapest pie is 18, and we already have the cost of the blueberry pie without flour (16), we can calculate the cost of flour for the blueberry pie: Total cost - Cost of blueberries, sugar, eggs, and butter = 18 - 16 = 2.

The midpoint (frac{x}{2}, frac{y}{2}) must lie on the line, and we calculate its squared distance to (0,0): left(frac{x}{2}right)^2 + left(frac{y}{2}right)^2 = frac{1}{4}(x^2 + y^2) = frac{1}{4}(9) = 2.25.

This distances the midpoint a fixed distance of 1.5 units from (0,0), describing a quarter-circle with radius 1.5 at each corner of the square within the bounds of the square itself. Since each corner has an identical quarter-circle and they do not overlap, the area enclosed by all midpoints is that of a full circle with radius 1.5 minus the area outside the boundary of the circle but inside the square. The full circle area is pi(1.5)^2 = 2.25pi, and each quarter-circle has an area of frac{pi (1.5)^2}{4} = frac{2.25pi}{4} = 0.5625pi.

In this situation, both binomial coefficients ( C_{p-k+1}^{k} ) and ( C_{p-k-1}^{k-2} ) are zero according to the properties of binomial coefficients. Similarly, if ( 2k = p + 1 ), both coefficients are 1. Therefore, to avoid trivial cases, we will proceed under the assumption ( 2k leq p ). 2. **Expanding Binomial Coefficients:**    We start by expressing ( C_{p-k+1}^{k} ) and ( C_{p-k-1}^{k-2} ) in factorials:    [    C_{p-k+1}^{k} = frac{(p-k+1)!}{k!(p-k+1-k)!} = frac{(p-k+1)!}{k!(p-2k+1)!}    ]    [    C_{p-k-1}^{k-2} = frac{(p-k-1)!}{(k-2)!(p-k-1-(k-2))!} = frac{(p-k-1)!}{(k-2)!(p-2k+1)!}    ] 3. **Consolidating the Differences:**    Simplify the expression ( C_{p-k+1}^{k} - C_{p-k-1}^{k-2} ):    [    C_{p-k+1}^{k} - C_{p-k-1}^{k-2} = frac{(p-k+1)!}{k!(p-2k+1)!} - frac{(p-k-1)!}{(k-2)!(p-2k+1)!}    ]    [    = frac{(p-k-1)!}{k!(p-2k+1)!} left( (p-k+1)(p-k) - k(k-1) right)    ]    Breaking down the expression inside the parentheses:    [    (p-k+1)(p-k) - k(k-1) = (p-k)(p-k+1) - k^2 + k    ]    Since ( k leq p-2 ), we can further simplify:    [    (p-k+1)(p-k) - k^2 + k = p^2 - 2pk + p - k^2 + k    ]    Notice that the expression simplifies to:    [    p(p - 2k + 1)    ] 4. **Final Expression:**    Substitute this back into the binomial difference:    [    C_{p-k+1}^{k} - C_{p-k-1}^{k-2} = frac{(p-k-1)!}{k!(p-2k+1)!} cdot p(p - 2k + 1)    ]    [    = frac{p(p-k-1)!}{k!(p-2k)!}    ]        Since ( p ) is a prime number, it is not a factor of any term in the denominator.

Specifically, determine if ( C_{n-k+1}^{k} - C_{n-k-1}^{k-2} ) being divisible by ( n ) implies ( n ) is prime. 1. **Consider ( p )-Composite:**    Suppose ( p ) is composite and let one of its factors be ( q ) such that ( p = nq ). Then following a similar arrangement:    [    frac{C_{p-q+1}^{q} - C_{p-q-1}^{q-2}}{p} = frac{(p-q-1)!}{q!(p-2q)!}    ]     2. **Analyzing Factorial Terms:**    The numerator contains terms from ( p-2q+1 ) to ( p-q-1 ). Importantly, none of these terms is ( q ), but ( q ) appears in the denominator. 3. **Seeing Non-Integer Result:**    Hence the fraction cannot yield an integer since there will be a factor ( q ) in the denominator which does not have a corresponding factor in the numerator. Therefore, the difference ( C_{p-q+1}^{q} - C_{p-q-1}^{q-2} ) is not divisible by ( p ). Thus, the converse statement does not hold.

When we append \\"1\\", we shift the bits one position to the left and add a 1.    - When we append \\"001\\", we shift the bits three positions to the left and add the binary sequence \\"001\\".    - Example:      - For ( n = 5 ) (binary: 101), ( 2n + 1 ) would be ( 11 = 111 ) and ( 8n + 1 ) would be ( 41 = 101001 ). 3. **Identifying Unique Halls**:    - A hall is essentially a set of rooms that can be reached from each other using the operations given.    - To determine if there can be infinitely many distinct halls, we examine the room numbers ( n ) whose binary representations end in \\"10\\".    - For a number ( n ) whose binary ends in \\"10\\", the operations ( 2n + 1 ) and ( 8n + 1 ) will result in numbers extending in a manner maintaining certain properties in their binary form. 4. **Invariant Analysis**:    - Consider the parity of the number of zeros after the last '1' in their binary representation.    - Removing \\"1\\" or \\"001\\" changes the end of the binary representation appropriately, but it does so while maintaining the parity (odd/even property) of the remaining number of trailing zeros.    - Starting from a room ( n ) ending in \\"10\\":      - It implies that the last zero is isolated and cannot reach a number by appending \\"1\\" or \\"001\\" without adding additional zeros, which keeps the parity. This room starts a new sequence hence a new hall. 5. **Constructing Infinite Halls**:    - Each number ( n ) of the form having last bits as \\"10\\" (e.g., ( 2, 10, 6, 18, 34, ...)), starts a distinct hall.    - These numbers are not reachable from other numbers and do not exhaust the binary representation, ensuring they can be extended into more distinct halls. **Conclusion**: - Since each room starting with \\"10\\" in the binary can start a new hall and we can have an infinite number of such configurations, this implies that there can theoretically be infinitely many different halls in the castle.

This contradicts our objective. 6. **Isolated Empty Spaces:**     - An empty space must not be adjacent to the boundary of the board to ensure adjacent tiles are immovable. 7. **Counting Empty Squares:**     - To ensure no tiles are movable, each empty square must be placed in a way that it is surrounded by tiles which make the tiles surrounding it immovable. 8. **Calculation of Minimum Tiles:**     - If we isolate every empty square and each tile covers 2 squares, we need to place tiles such that they form the desired configuration.     - Mathematically:         ( 8 times 8 = 64 ) squares in total.         If we leave (k) squares empty:         - (N = frac{64 - k}{2})     - To ensure no two empty squares are adjacent and every empty square remains isolated, precise placement is crucial. 9. **Optimal Solution Using (28) Tiles:**     - Leaving (8) squares empty (not forming any adjacent empty squares configurations).     - Therefore, ( (64 - 8) / 2 = 28 )     - Visually representable in an (8 times 8) grid:         - Each 4 empty squares is part of a unique isolated positioning within an optimal tile arrangement. 10. **Conclusion:**     - Placing 28 (2 times 1) or (1 times 2) tiles is the solution where there will be 8 isolated empty squares ensuring that no tile is movable horizontally or vertically.

This is a fundamental property of triangle geometry, making this statement correct. Thus, it does not match the question's requirement for an incorrect statement. **Option B**: The statement that the perpendicular bisectors of the three sides of a triangle intersect at one point, and this point is equidistant from the three vertices, describes the circumcenter of a triangle. This is another well-established fact in triangle geometry, indicating that this statement is also correct. Therefore, it does not fulfill the criteria for being the incorrect statement sought by the question. **Option C**: The statement that an isosceles triangle with an angle of 60^{circ} must be an equilateral triangle is based on the properties of triangles. In an isosceles triangle, if any angle is 60^{circ}, the other two angles must also be 60^{circ} to satisfy the total sum of 180^{circ} for the angles in a triangle. This means the triangle has three equal angles and, by definition, must also have three equal sides, making it equilateral.

While it's true that propositions can have converses, the statement that every theorem may not necessarily have a converse is misleading. Theorems can have converses, but whether those converses are true or not is a separate matter of proof.

Let's denote:    - AD as the altitude from vertex A to side BC.    - BM as the median from vertex B to side AC.        Given that the median BM and the altitude from C are equal indicates a specific relationship in the triangle. The median splits AC into two equal segments. 3. **Position of Vertex B and Perpendicular Observation:**        To use the fact that angle A = 30^circ, consider the properties of a triangle with a 30^circ angle. In a right-angled triangle, where one angle is 30^circ, a key property is that the side opposite 30^circ is half the hypotenuse. 4. **Circle and Diameter Argument:**        The condition that both the median from B and the height from C are equal to half the side they are drawn to suggest that B is on the circle with the diameter AC. This observation implies a right triangle scenario:    Notice that a right-angled triangle shares the property that the altitude and median split the sides in such a way that involves symmetrical properties around a circle. 5. **Conclusion Using Angle Sum Property:**        The angles in a triangle sum to 180^circ.

Suppose (a^{2}) also ends in two 4s. The difference between these squares would be:    [    a^{2} - 144 = (a + 12)(a - 12)    ]    This expression must end in 00, meaning it is divisible by 100. Therefore, both (a) and ((a + 12)(a - 12)) must meet certain criteria:        - (a) must be even, as only then would ((a + 12)(a - 12)) be divisible by 4, part of 100.    - The product ((a + 12)(a - 12)) must be divisible by 25.    For this product to satisfy the divisibility condition by 25, one of the terms must be divisible by 25, or both terms should end in 0 or 5. However, the differential between factors ((a + 12)) and ((a-12)) is 24, which is not divisible by 5, leaving us with one of the factors.    When (a) ends in 12, 38, 62, or 88, the square should end in two 4s due to the last common two digits rule in squaring numbers:        - (38^2 = 1444)    - (88^2 = 7744)    - (12^2 = 144)    - (62^2 = 3844)    Hence, all numbers ending in 12, 38, 62, and 88 have squares ending in two 4s. 2. **Identifying the numbers whose squares end in three identical digits 4**:    First, consider a number whose square ends in three identical digits 444.

Details of divisibility:    - (b) must be even for the factors to be divisible by 4.    - To be divisible by 8, at least one of these factors must be divisible by 4, which implies both must be divisible by 4 as neither factor alone suffices.    For divisibility by 125, one factor must be divisible by 125, as the numbers must be relatively prime to 125. Since:    [    (b + 38) - (b - 38) = 76    ]    76 is not divisible by 5 and serves as a confirmation of elementary prime condition.    Outcomes of numbers fitting the criteria:    - (b ) ending in 038, 462, 538, or 962 achieve the stated three identical digits:        [    38^{2}=1444, quad 462^{2}=213444, quad 538^{2}=289444, quad 962^{2}=925444    ] 3. **Conclusion**:        - Numbers ending in 12, 38, 62, and 88 have squares ending in two 4s.    - Numbers ending in 038, 462, 538, and 962 have squares ending in three 4s.

The tape cannot be wrapped around the apex of the cone, nor can it be cut or twisted. If necessary, you can assume it is infinite in length, and the angle between the axis and the generatrix of the cone is sufficiently small.","output":"1. Let's consider the problem of wrapping an inextensible ribbon around an infinite cone in such a way to make infinitely many turns around its axis.  2. First, let’s cut the cone along one of its generators (a line segment from the apex to the base) and unfold it onto a plane. This transformation provides a flat angle A_0OA_1 of the cone with the magnitude alpha. This is illustrated in the reference image. 3. The trace of the ribbon on this flat figure, which represents the first loop, will look like a strip with parallel edges extending from the side OA_0 to OA_1. 4. Let's extend this flat figure by adding another unwrapped section of the cone, forming an angle A_1OA_2 of the same magnitude alpha. As the ribbon crosses the side OA_1 of the second section, it will continue as the same strip on the second unfolded part until it reaches the side OA_2, representing the second loop, and so on. 5. To analyze this configuration, assume the ribbon makes n loops around the cone where n > frac{pi}{alpha}. This implies our strip, per condition, cannot pass through the point O, hence it will intersect the rays OA_0, OA_1, ldots, OA_n. However, this situation leads to a contradiction:     [     pi > angle A_0OA_n = nalpha > pi     ]    This results in an inconsistency since the angular sum exceeds the possible angle limit. 6. Consequently, the number of loops n that the ribbon can make surrounding the cone is bounded by frac{pi}{alpha}, affirming that it is definitively finite. # Conclusion: Therefore, it is impossible to wrap the inextensible ribbon around the infinite cone to achieve an infinite number of loops.   boxed{text{No}}"},{"instruction":"w many positive factors does 180 have?","output":"The prime factorization of 180 is 180 = 2^2 cdot 3^2 cdot 5.

So the total distance covered when crossing the platform is: Distance = Length of train + Length of platform Distance = 300 m + 285 m Distance = 585 m We are given that the train crosses this distance in 39 seconds.

Since the speed of the train is constant, the time it takes to cross the signal pole (which is the same as the length of the train) can be calculated using the formula: Time = Distance / Speed The distance in this case is the length of the train, which is 300 m.

What is the maximum number of distinct substrings of the string Sean is looking at?","output":"1. **Understanding the Problem:**    - We are given a string of length 66 composed of the letters (A), (T), (C), and (G).    - We need to find the maximum number of distinct substrings of this string. 2. **Counting Substrings:**    - A substring is a contiguous sequence of letters in the string.    - For a string of length (n), the number of substrings of length (k) is (n - k + 1). 3. **Distinct Substrings:**    - We need to ensure that all possible substrings are distinct.    - For a string of length 66, the number of substrings of length (k) is (67 - k). 4. **Graph Theory Approach:**    - Consider a directed graph with vertex set ({A, T, C, G}^2).    - For all (x, y, z in {A, T, C, G}), draw an edge from (xy) to (yz) and label it with (xyz).    - This graph is connected and has all indegrees and outdegrees equal to 4, so it has an Eulerian cycle (a cycle that visits every edge exactly once). 5. **Eulerian Cycle:**    - If such a cycle travels through (a_1a_2, a_2a_3, dots, a_{65}a_{66}) in that order, then (a_1 a_2 dots a_{66}) includes each three-letter string exactly once.    - This means that for all (k ge 3), all (67 - k) of the (k)-letter substrings will be distinct. 6. **Counting Distinct Substrings:**    - There are 4 substrings of length 1 (since there are 4 distinct letters).    - There are (4^2 = 16) substrings of length 2.    - For substrings of length 3, there are (4^3 = 64) substrings.    - For substrings of length (k) where (k ge 3), there are (67 - k) distinct substrings. 7. **Summing Up:**    - The total number of distinct substrings is:      [      4 + 16 + 64 + 63 + 62 + dots + 1      ]    - This is the sum of an arithmetic series with the first term (a = 1), the last term (l = 64), and the number of terms (n = 64). 8. **Sum of Arithmetic Series:**    - The sum of the first (n) natural numbers is given by:      [      S = frac{n(n + 1)}{2}      ]    - Here, (n = 64), so:      [      S = frac{64 cdot 65}{2} = 2080      ] 9. **Adding the Substrings of Length 1 and 2:**    - Total distinct substrings:      [      4 + 16 + 2080 = 2100      ] The final answer is (boxed{2100})"},{"instruction":"Which of the following statements about propositions is correct?

This number is referred to as the \\"step\\" of the player. 2. **Establish the minimum step:**     - From the problem, it is given that every player, after playing a game, must rest for at least n games before playing again. Thus, every step of any player must be at least n+1. 3. **Consider a sequence of n+3 consecutive games:**     - Let's denote these n+3 consecutive games as ( g_{1}, g_{2}, ldots, g_{n+3} ).     - These n+3 games involve 2(n+3) = 2n+6 participations by players (each game involves 2 players). 4. **Identify the frequency of player participations:**     - Only three players can participate in two games within these n+3 games, without breaching the given restrictions.     - This can only occur for specific pairs of games such as ( (g_{1}, g_{n+2}), (g_{1}, g_{n+3}), ) and ( (g_{2}, g_{n+3}) ). In each pair, there can only be one such player participating twice. 5. **Count all participants:**     - Therefore, to accumulate 2n+6 participations, other players must participate exactly once in these games.     - Hence, the steps of players who played in game g_{1} must be either n+1 or n+2. 6. **Show the existence of a player with steps n+2:**     - Assume a player has every one of their steps sized ( n+2 ).     - The total number of steps this player takes in 2n+1 games is ((n+2)(2n+1) = 2n^2 + 5n + 2). 7. **Total games calculation:**     - The total number of games is frac{(2n+3)(2n+2)}{2} = 2n^2 + 5n + 3.     - This one additional game indicates this player participated in both the first and the last game. 8. **Proof by contradiction:**     - Suppose every player's step is n+1.     - Consider a player X, who took their first step last. Let Y be their opponent in game t.     - If player Y had the last step ending at t, their last step before this must be at q to (q+n+1). 9. **Step deductions:**     - Sequentially, the following steps must follow n+2 until game t by player Y.     - Then t = q+(n+1)+k(n+2).     - On the other hand, player's preceding steps X would have steps n+2.     - If X had at least k such steps preceding t, X participated in subsequent t-(n+1)-k(n+2)=q.     - Thus, X and Y meet twice creating a contradiction. 10. **Conclude contradiction:**     - If all the previous steps of player X were less, thus making the first game number at least q+(n+2) ge n+3.

Given that alpha - beta is an integer by our assumption, then alpha^2 - beta^2 being an integer implies that alpha + beta must be rational. 3. Given alpha - beta = k and alpha + beta rational, we can express alpha and beta as:    [    alpha = frac{(alpha + beta) + (alpha - beta)}{2} quad text{and} quad beta = frac{(alpha + beta) - (alpha - beta)}{2}    ]    These forms suggest alpha and beta are rational. Let alpha = frac{a}{c} and beta = frac{b}{c} where a, b, c are integers, and gcd(a, b, c) = 1. Thus:    [    alpha^n - beta^n = left( frac{a}{c} right)^n - left( frac{b}{c} right)^n = frac{a^n - b^n}{c^n}    ]    This fraction is an integer if and only if c^n divides a^n - b^n. 4. Since n=1 implies c mid a - b, it follows that a equiv b pmod{c}. 5. The polynomial factorization shows a^n - b^n = (a - b)(a^{n-1} + a^{n-2}b + cdots + b^{n-1}). Therefore:    [    c^n mid (a - b)(a^{n-1} + a^{n-2}b + cdots + b^{n-1})    ] 6. Consider a prime divisor p of c. Since c mid a - b, we get a equiv b pmod{p}. Hence, modulo p the expression a^{n-1} + a^{n-2}b + cdots + b^{n-1} equiv n cdot a^{n-1} pmod{p}. 7. If n is not divisible by p, then n cdot a^{n-1} is not divisible by p because gcd(a, p) = 1. This means:    [    p^n nmid a^n - b^n    ]    Therefore, a sufficient condition for a^n - b^n not to be divisible by c^n is choosing an n such that p nmid n and a neq b. 8. Such an n can be chosen, for instance, n = p|a-b| + 1. Here |a - b| < n < p^n, satisfying the conditions and ensuring alpha^n - beta^n is not an integer. # Conclusion: Thus, there always exists a positive integer n such that alpha^n - beta^n is not an integer.

A tourist asked each of the 10 inhabitants whether there are more knights, more liars, or an equal number of both in their group. Five people responded, \\"There are more liars.\\" 2. **Analyzing the Statements**:    Let's denote the number of knights as ( K ) and the number of liars as ( L ).    The statements by the first five people that \\"There are more liars\\" can be either true or false.        - If the statement \\"There are more liars\\" was true, then ( L > K ). In this case, all five people who made this statement would be knights because knights tell the truth.    - If the statement \\"There are more liars\\" was false, then ( K ge L ). In this case, all five people who made this statement would be liars because liars always lie. 3. **Determining the Group Composition**:    Since exactly five people made the statement \\"There are more liars,\\" we need to consider the implications:    - If exactly five people are knights and they tell the truth that ( L > K ), then one would expect more than half to be liars (( L ) should exceed ( K )). However, this leads to a contradiction as we assumed the statement was true if they were knights.    - If exactly five people are liars, saying \\"There are more liars,\\" then they are lying, meaning ( L le K ). This would imply that the statement about more liars cannot be true and must be false.  4. **Concluding the Group Composition**:    The only scenario that fits is having an equal number of knights and liars:        - If ( K = L ), then no one would truthfully say there are more liars. Thus, being all knights and liars, they would perfectly balance each other's statements, allowing for five liars to falsely say there are more liars. 5. **What Did the Remaining Five Say?**:        Therefore, the remaining five people must have said \\"There are an equal number of knights and liars\\".

Specifically, let ( A = lceil frac{n}{2} rceil ) and ( B = lfloor frac{n}{2} rfloor ).

At least one of the edges of the triangle must join two vertices that are either both in ( A ) or both in ( B ). The number assigned to this edge is at least ( |A||B| + 1 = lfloor frac{n^2}{4} rfloor + 1 ). 5. **Compare with the required bound:**    Since ( lfloor frac{n^2}{4} rfloor + 1 ) is a lower bound for the sum of the numbers assigned to the edges of any triangle, we need to show that this is greater than or equal to ( 3n - 1000 log_2 log_2 n ). 6. **Verify the inequality:**    [    lfloor frac{n^2}{4} rfloor + 1 > 3n - 1000 log_2 log_2 n    ]    For large ( n ), ( frac{n^2}{4} ) grows much faster than ( 3n ) and ( 1000 log_2 log_2 n ).

Since the train is accelerating, we can't simply use the initial speed to calculate the distance. Instead, we need to use the kinematic equation that relates distance (s), initial velocity (u), acceleration (a), and time (t): s = ut + (1/2)at^2 However, we don't have the value of the acceleration (a) yet. To find the acceleration, we would need additional information, such as the final velocity of the train after the acceleration period or the total distance over which the train accelerates. Since we don't have that information, we cannot calculate the exact length of the train. If we assume that the acceleration is negligible and the speed of the train remains constant at 60 km/hr while crossing the pole, we could estimate the length of the train using the initial speed. But this would not be accurate if the acceleration is significant. Assuming negligible acceleration for estimation purposes only: Convert the speed from km/hr to m/s: 60 km/hr = 60 * (1000 m / 1 km) * (1 hr / 3600 s) = 16.67 m/s Now, using the initial speed and the time it takes to cross the pole: s = ut + (1/2)at^2 Since we are assuming a ≈ 0 for this estimation: s ≈ ut s ≈ 16.67 m/s * 30 s s ≈ 500.1 m So, the estimated length of the train would be approximately boxed{500.1}  meters.

Notice that (5+sqrt{26})^n + (5-sqrt{26})^n is an integer. Let's understand why this expression is an integer. 2. **Integer Analysis:**    - Since both (5+sqrt{26}) and (5-sqrt{26}) are roots of a quadratic polynomial with rational coefficients, say (x^2 - 10x + (text{some constant}) = 0), their powers when added together yield an integer.  3. **Inequalities for Bounds:**    We examine the term ((5 - sqrt{26})^n).    - First, calculate the magnitude of (5 - sqrt{26}):      [ 5 - sqrt{26} ]    - We establish an inequality for this term:      [      5 - sqrt{26} = frac{1}{sqrt{26}+5}      ]            Observe:      [      0 < sqrt{26} - 5 < 1      ]      Hence,      [      0 < frac{1}{sqrt{26} + 5} < 0.1      ]      4. **Behavior for Even and Odd (n):**    **Case 1: (n) is even:**    - When (n) is even, ((5 - sqrt{26})^n) remains positive.    - Consequently,      [      0 < (5-sqrt{26})^n < frac{1}{10^n}      ]    - The integer part of ((5+sqrt{26})^n) plus a very small positive fraction leaves the fractional part to be all 9s up to at least the first (n) digits because ((5+sqrt{26})^n)'s fractional part is essentially 1 - epsilon where (epsilon) is very small:      [      begin{align*}      text{If }a &= (5+sqrt{26})^n,       text{then } a& = lfloor a rfloor + {a} text{ where }  {a} text{ is the fractional part}.      end{align*}      ]      Here, ({a} = 1 - epsilon implies epsilon} < frac{1}{10^n}).

If not, repeat the process. 9. **Iterate the Process**:    Continue this process. Each time the number of members considered decreases, and so does the divisor for the pigeonhole principle. Eventually, we will narrow down to a point where:    [    leftlceil frac{n}{k} rightrceil = 1    ]    would force the presence of a suitable number satisfying the given conditions. # Conclusion: Using the pigeonhole principle and the iterative process of checking differences, it guarantees the presence of at least one member whose number is equal to the sum of the members' numbers of two other members or twice the number of one other member from the same country.

We now need to calculate the probabilities step-by-step: 4. **Probability Analysis**:      - **Probability of 4th Move**: If Travis is not at ((1,1,1)) after three moves, he has a (frac{1}{3}) chance of returning to the original vertex ((0,0,0)) on the 4th move.     - **Dominant Probability**: From any vertex other than ((1,1,1)), the probability to move to ((0,0,0)) on the last move remains (frac{1}{3}), because each vertex has three adjacent vertices. 5. **Breaking Down the Steps**:     - **At 3 Moves**: The probability that Travis is at ((1,1,1)) after 3 moves is (frac{2}{9}) (as computed by examining combinations of moves).     - **Not at ((1,1,1))**: So, the probability that Travis is not at ((1,1,1)) after 3 moves is (1 - frac{2}{9} = frac{7}{9}). 6. **Combining Probabilities**:     - Given that after 3 moves, Travis is not at ((1,1,1)), the probability of reaching ((0,0,0)) on the 4th move is (frac{1}{3}).     - Thus, the combined probability is:     [     P(text{return to } (0,0,0)) = frac{7}{9} times frac{1}{3} = frac{7}{27}     ] # Conclusion: The probability that Travis is back at the vertex where he started after four moves on the cube is given by: [ boxed{frac{7}{27}} ]"},{"instruction":"Observe the following inequalities: 1+frac{1}{2}+frac{1}{3} > 1, 1+frac{1}{2}+frac{1}{3}+cdots +frac{1}{7} > frac{3}{2}, 1+frac{1}{2}+frac{1}{3}+cdots +frac{1}{15} > 2, cdots Following this pattern, what is the nth inequality?","output":"This problem primarily tests analogical reasoning and the key to solving it is finding the pattern in the inequalities.

This is because the cube's structure allows you to traverse from one vertex to a vertex on the opposite side by moving through at most three connected edges. 3. **Analyzing the Assigned Numbers**:    We are given that each of the vertices of the cube are numbered uniquely from 1 to 8.

According to the cube's structure, moving from vertex 1 to vertex 8 can be achieved in at most 3 steps (edges).  5. **Difference in the Numbers Across the Edges**:    Since the maximum sum of steps (distance) between any two vertices is 3 and the fact that we have numeric labels 1 to 8 where 8 - 1 = 7, we consider the path from 1 to 8 and the differences at each step:    - To move from 1 to 8 directly in maximum three steps means that the sum of differences across these three edges must sum to 7 or more.    - Since each edge in this triplet of edges must sum to at least 7, at least one edge will have to cover a numerical difference of ( leftlceil frac{7}{3} rightrceil = 3 ). 6. **Conclusion**:    Consequently, at least one of the edges will have the ends labeled with numbers that differ by at least 3.

The equations of the asymptotes are y=pm dfrac{b}{a}x. Given the parabola y^{2}=4x, we can substitute y=dfrac{b}{a}x to find the intersection points in the first and fourth quadrants. This substitution yields: [y^{2} = left(dfrac{b}{a}xright)^{2} = 4x] Solving for x and y, we get: [x = dfrac{4a^{2}}{b^{2}}, quad y = pm dfrac{4a}{b}] Therefore, the points A and B are Aleft(dfrac{4a^{2}}{b^{2}}, dfrac{4a}{b}right) and Bleft(dfrac{4a^{2}}{b^{2}}, -dfrac{4a}{b}right).

Variance measures the spread of the scores around the average. A smaller variance indicates that the scores are more tightly clustered around the average, implying more consistent performance. Comparing the variances: - Athlete A: Variance = 0.69 - Athlete B: Variance = 0.03 Since athlete B's variance is smaller than athlete A's, it means athlete B's scores are more consistently close to their average score of 9.1 points.

We start by understanding the setup: we are given a triangle whose sides are the diagonals of three different parallelograms. The sides of these parallelograms are parallel to two mutually perpendicular lines, ( l ) and ( p ). 2. Consider the three parallelograms. Each parallelogram is constructed in such a way that its sides align with the lines ( l ) and ( p ). Note that these parallelograms share the property of having diagonals that lie on the sides of the triangle. 3. Observe that if we overlay these three parallelograms, they form a larger parallelogram (say ( ABDC )) which is circumscribed around the given triangle. This larger parallelogram is divided into four smaller parallelograms. Let's denote these smaller parallelograms as:     - (P_1)     - (P_2)     - (P_3)     - (P_4)      4. Given the mutual arrangement of the parallelograms, we see that diagonals of the individual smaller parallelograms intersect. By the properties of parallelograms, specifically that the diagonals bisect each other, we note that any two diagonals from different smaller parallelograms will intersect at a single point inside each parallelogram. 5. When we consider the main triangle formed, the diagonals (let's denote them as ( d_1 ), ( d_2 ), and ( d_3 )) that are not sides of the triangle intersect at a common point ( M ). This intersection property is due to the parallelogram's diagonals' bisecting nature. 6. The intersection point ( M ) lies on the circumscribing circle of the triangle with vertices being the midpoints of the sides of the triangle. This is because the diagonals of a parallelogram forming are such that each diagonal splits the vertex angles into equal parts thus ensuring the vertex relationship maintained in the larger circumscribing construction. 7. So, the geometric locus of the intersection point ( M ) of the diagonals should be a circle that passes through the midpoints of the sides of the original triangle. 8. Hence, the circle that satisfies this condition is known as the **nine-point circle** (also called the Euler circle) for the given triangle. This circle passes through:     - The midpoints of the sides of the triangle     - The feet of the altitudes of the triangle     - The midpoints of the line segments joining the orthocenter to the vertices of the triangle. # Conclusion: Thus, the geometric location of the intersection point ( M ) where the diagonal lines of the three parallelograms intersect is on the nine-point circle of the given triangle.

If all switches were in the off position at the beginning, how many lights are switched on by the end of this operation?","output":"To solve this problem, we need to determine which lights are turned on by X and Y's actions. Since all lights start in the off position, a light will only be on if its switch is flipped an odd number of times. X flips every seventh switch, so he flips the switches for lights 7, 14, 21, and so on up to the highest multiple of 7 that is less than or equal to 200. To find out how many times X flips a switch, we divide 200 by 7: 200 ÷ 7 = 28 with a remainder (we only care about the whole number for the count of switches X will flip). So, X flips 28 switches. Y flips every eleventh switch, so she flips the switches for lights 11, 22, 33, and so on up to the highest multiple of 11 that is less than or equal to 200. To find out how many times Y flips a switch, we divide 200 by 11: 200 ÷ 11 = 18 with a remainder. So, Y flips 18 switches. However, some lights may be flipped by both X and Y if they are multiples of both 7 and 11. To find these lights, we need to find the least common multiple (LCM) of 7 and 11, which is 77 (since 7 and 11 are both prime numbers, their LCM is just their product). Now, we need to find out how many multiples of 77 are there up to 200. We divide 200 by 77: 200 ÷ 77 = 2 with a remainder. So, there are 2 lights that are flipped by both X and Y (at positions 77 and 154). Now, let's calculate the total number of lights that are on: - Lights flipped by X: 28 - Lights flipped by Y: 18 - Lights flipped by both X and Y: 2 Since the lights flipped by both X and Y are flipped twice, they will end up in the off position. We need to subtract these from the total count of lights flipped by X and Y: Total lights on = Lights flipped by X + Lights flipped by Y - Lights flipped by both X and Y Total lights on = 28 + 18 - 2 Total lights on = 46 - 2 Total lights on = 44 Therefore, by the end of the operation, boxed{44}  lights are switched on."},{"instruction":"The owner of a small store divided the sugar into 12 packs.

Since (AB) and (AC) are equal chords, the arcs ( widehat{AB} ) and ( widehat{AC} ) are also equal. Therefore: [ widehat{AB} = widehat{AC} = frac{160^circ}{2} = 80^circ ] 4.

From a_4, a_7, a_{12} forming a geometric sequence, we deduce that: a_7^2 = a_4 cdot a_{12} Substituting with the terms of the arithmetic sequence, this leads to: (11 + 3d)^2 = (11 + d)(11 + 4d) Given that d neq 0, solving the above equation results in d = 2. Therefore, a_1 = 11 - 3 cdot 2 = 3, which gives us the general term formula for the sequence: a_n = 2n + 1 **(II)** To prove the given inequality, we first express S_n in terms of the sequence's general term: S_n = frac{n(a_1 + a_n)}{2} = n(n + 2) Now consider the reciprocal of S_n: frac{1}{S_n} = frac{1}{n(n + 2)} = frac{1}{2}left(frac{1}{n} - frac{1}{n+2}right) Therefore, T_n can be expressed as a telescoping series: T_n = frac{1}{S_1} + frac{1}{S_2} + ldots + frac{1}{S_n} = frac{1}{2}left[left(1 - frac{1}{3}right) + left(frac{1}{2} - frac{1}{4}right) + ldots + left(frac{1}{n} - frac{1}{n+2}right)right] Upon simplification, we get: T_n = frac{1}{2}left[1 + frac{1}{2} - left(frac{1}{n+1} + frac{1}{n+2}right)right] = frac{3}{4} - frac{1}{2}left(frac{1}{n+1} + frac{1}{n+2}right) Observing that frac{1}{n+1} + frac{1}{n+2} > 0, it follows that: T_n < frac{3}{4} - frac{1}{2} cdot 0 = frac{3}{4} Therefore, we have proved that T_n < boxed{frac{3}{4}}"},{"instruction":"Given that the inequalities x^{2}ax+1leqslant 0 and ax^{2}+x1 > 0 with respect to x do not hold, find the range of a.

The constraints are ( frac{1}{2} n < k leq frac{2}{3} n ). 2. **Claim:**    The least number ( m ) of pawns required is ( 4(n - k) ). 3. **Constructing the Configuration:**    - Start by placing a pawn in the first row in the ( n - k )-th column.    - Move one square down and right, placing another pawn, and continue this until reaching the ( k - 1 )-th column.    - This ensures that each row has at least ( k - 1 ) squares to the right and left of the pawn, satisfying the condition. 4. **Continuing the Pattern:**    - After reaching the ( k - 1 )-th column, place pawns diagonally as before but also place a pawn to the left of each, ensuring there are exactly ( k - 1 ) squares between them.    - Continue this pattern until reaching the edge of the board, which will be at the ( k )-th column. 5. **Repeating the Pattern:**    - The second diagonal starts at row ( 2k - n + 1 ) and continues until row ( n ).    - By adding another pawn to continue the diagonal, we reach row ( n - k ), allowing us to repeat the initial pattern. 6. **Verification:**    - The configuration satisfies the condition for columns as well, since rotating the board ( 90^circ ) clockwise and reflecting over its horizontal line of symmetry maintains the pattern. 7. **Proving the Pattern Completes Twice:**    - Suppose we can't complete the pattern twice:      [      k + 2k - n > n implies k > frac{2n}{3}      ]      This contradicts ( k leq frac{2}{3} n ).    - Suppose we can complete the pattern more than twice:      [      2k > n implies k > frac{n}{2}      ]      This contradicts ( frac{1}{2} n < k ). 8. **Calculating the Number of Pawns:**    - During each pattern, there is one pawn per row in the first part and two pawns per row in the second part.    - Thus, the total number of pawns is:      [      m = 2(2k - n) + 2(n - 2k + n) = 4(n - k)      ] 9. **Proving the Lower Bound:**    - Consider a configuration with the minimum number of pawns.    - Define ( N ) as a set of ( n ) pairs representing the row and column of pawns, ensuring no row appears more than once.    - Define \\"good\\" numbers as those in ( [n - k, k - 1] ) and \\"bad\\" numbers otherwise.    - Let ( n_1 ) be pairs of two bad numbers, ( n_2 ) be pairs of one good and one bad number, and ( n_3 ) be pairs of two good numbers.    - We have:      [      n_1 + n_2 + n_3 = n      ]      Since there are ( 2k - n ) good numbers, ( n_3 leq 2k - n ).

Luciano keeps drawing tangent segments until no more can be drawn. Find all possible numbers of tangent segments when he stops drawing.","output":"We want to determine the total number of tangent segments s that can be drawn between 2017 mutually external circles under the given conditions.   Step 1: Understanding the Configuration and Counting Segments for a Specific Case - Consider an arrangement of n circles C_1, C_2, ldots, C_n where the centers are aligned, and each circle is eclipsed by its neighboring circles. - In this arrangement, we only need to consider adjacent circles C_i and C_{i+1}. Between each pair of adjacent circles, exactly three tangents can be drawn. Therefore, for n circles:   [   s = 3(n-1).   ] This gives us the count of tangent segments for one specific configuration.  Step 2: Generalizing to an Arbitrary Arrangement - For a general arrangement without restrictions on positions of the circles, we start from the final configuration where no more tangent segments can be drawn and use a continuous process of resizing and moving circles. - We need to show that moving circles around does not change the number of tangent segments drawn.  Step 3: Transitions and Tangent Segments - A transition (change in the number of tangent segments) happens when a circle becomes tangent or ceases to be tangent in a way involving three circles being simultaneously tangent to a common line. - Because of this property, once we reach a configuration where no more segments can be drawn, the total number of segments must remain consistent with our initial specific case where we calculated 3(n-1) segments.  Step 4: Using Graph Theory and Euler's Formula - We model the circles and tangents as a graph G where circles are vertices, and tangent segments are the edges. - An internal region bounded by tangents will consist of three sharp corners as there are exactly three tangents forming each such region. - Each circle touches exactly three tangent lines, and hence defines vertices in a connected plane (multi-)graph. - According to Euler's formula for a connected planar graph,    [   v - e + f = 2,   ]   where v is the number of vertices, e is the number of edges, and f is the number of faces (including the outer face). - Setting v = n (the number of circles), and calculating the faces in terms of sharp corners:   [   2s = 3f.   ]  Step 5: Solving the Equations - Relate the number of segments s, the number of regions r, and the total circles n using Euler’s formula and the sharp corner argument:   [   e = s = 3(n-1),   ]   [   f = 2s / 3,   ]   [   v - e + f = 2.   ] - Substituting and solving for number of segments,   [   n - 3(n-1) + frac{2s}{3} = 2,   ]   [   n - 3n + 3 + 2n - frac{2}{3} = 2,   ]   Simplify,   [   -2n + frac{2s}{3} = 2.   ]  Conclusion: - Solving for s:   [   2s = 3 times  (2017 - 1),   ]   [   s = 3 times 2017 - 3 times 1,   ]   [   s = 3 times 2016,   ]   [   s = 6048.   ] Thus, the only possible number of tangent segments that Luciano can draw is: [ boxed{6048} ]"},{"instruction":") Given a rectangular table of size (4 times 10) (cells).

For this to be true, if a column has an even number of rows (which it does in this case), there must be at least one empty cell in the column (otherwise it would have an even number of crosses).    - This implies that in each of the 10 columns, there should be at least one empty cell.

Recall that the grid is now 5 times 10, totaling 5 times 10 = 50 cells.        - For each row to contain an odd number of crosses, the sum of crosses in all rows must be odd because the sum of an odd number of odd numbers is odd.            Similarly, for each column to contain an odd number of crosses, the sum of crosses in all columns must also be odd. This implies:      [      text{Sum of crosses} = text{odd}      ]        - However, if we count the total number of crosses based on columns, the sum must be even because there are 10 columns, and the sum of ten odd numbers is even:      [      text{Sum of crosses} = text{even}      ]        - These two conditions are contradictory (the sum cannot be both odd and even simultaneously).

Consider the original equation of the parabola y = x^2. We aim to find its reflection about the point (1, 1). 2.

Additionally, out of the three even digits 2, 4, and 6, there must be exactly one pair of adjacent even digits. How many such sixdigit numbers can be formed?","output":"First, let's consider the condition of the three even numbers 2, 4, and 6. To satisfy the requirement that exactly two of them are adjacent, we can treat any pair of these numbers as a single entity. There are A_3^2 = 6 ways to choose this pair.  Next, we need to arrange the three odd digits (1, 3, 5), which can be done in A_3^3 = 6 ways. This creates four potential slots where we could insert our \\"paired\\" evens and the single even digit: one slot before the first odd number, two slots between the odd numbers, and one slot after the last odd number. There are A_4^2 = 12 ways to choose two slots out of these four. Applying the principle of counting, we multiply these possibilities: 6 times 6 times 12 = 432. However, this includes cases where 1 might still be at either end. We need to subtract these scenarios. If 1 is at either end, we have A_2^1 = 2 choices to place it (front or back), and since the order of the remaining two even digits relative to one another matters, there are also A_2^2 = 2 ways to arrange them, which results in 4 options.  For inserting the \\"paired\\" even and the remaining single even among the three odd numbers, which now have formed three slots instead of four, we have A_3^2 = 6 ways. This yields an additional 6 times 4 times 6 = 144 arrangements. To find the total number of valid six-digit numbers with 1 not at either end and with exactly one pair of adjacent even numbers, we subtract the invalid arrangements from the total calculated earlier: 432 - 144 = boxed{288} different six-digit numbers."},{"instruction":"Let ( a, b, ) and ( c ) be distinct real numbers.

The shopkeeper allows a certain percentage of discount to achieve a certain gain. If the discount allowed is 20%, what is the percentage of gain the shopkeeper wants to achieve?","output":"Let's assume the cost price (CP) of the item is 100. The shopkeeper marks up the price by 35%, so the marked price (MP) is: MP = CP + (35% of CP) MP = 100 + (0.35 * 100) MP = 100 + 35 MP = 135 Now, the shopkeeper allows a discount of 20% on the marked price. The selling price (SP) after the discount is: SP = MP - (20% of MP) SP = 135 - (0.20 * 135) SP = 135 - 27 SP = 108 The shopkeeper wants to achieve a certain gain, which is the difference between the selling price and the cost price. The gain (G) is: G = SP - CP G = 108 - 100 G = 8 To find the percentage of gain, we use the formula: Percentage of Gain = (Gain / CP) * 100% Percentage of Gain = (8 / 100) * 100% Percentage of Gain = 0.08 * 100% Percentage of Gain = 8% Therefore, the shopkeeper wants to achieve a gain of boxed{8%} ."},{"instruction":"rewrite: 2.

Тенденции развития буржуазной государственности в России в 1917 г. 1. Древнерусское государство и право (IX-XII в.в.). Государственный строй В понятие государственный строй входят: -Вопросы устройства государства -Политическая форма правления -Структура и компетенция центральных и местных органов власти и управления -Военное устройство; -судебная система государства Формирование древнерусского государства шло вплоть до первой трети XII века. Это было целостное, основанное на принципе сюзеренитета-вассалитета государство. По форме правления древнерусское государство являлось раннефеодальной монархией с достаточно сильной монархической властью. Развитие древнерусского феодального права В Древнерусском государстве источником права, как и во многих раннефеодальных государствах, является правовой обычай, унаследованный от первобытнообщинного строя. В \\"Повести временных лет\\" отмечается, что племена имели \\"обычаи свои и законы отцов своих\\". В источнике имеются в виду нормы обычного права, и понятия употреблены как синонимы. С развитием феодализма и обострением классовых противоречий обычное право теряет свое значение. Во времена Владимира Святославовича все большее значение приобретает законодательство, выражающее интересы феодалов, утверждающее феодальные принципы и влияние церкви. Первым правовым документом, дошедшим до нас, был устав князя Владимира Святославовича \\"О десятинах, судах и людях церковных\\". Устав создан на рубеже X-XI вв. в виде короткой уставной грамоты, которая была придана церкви Святой Богородицы. Оригинал до нас не дошел. Известны лишь списки, составленные в XII в. (Синодальные и Оленецкие редакции). Устав выступает как соглашение между князем (Владимиром Святославовичем) и митрополитом (предположительно Лионом). По уставу изначально - князь: а) покровитель церкви (защищает церковь и обеспечивает ее материально) б) не вмешивается в дела церкви; Для существования церкви определяется десятина. По уставу князь должен 1/10 часть средств полученных от: - судебных дел - в виде дани от других племен; отдать церкви - от торговли Подобно князю, каждый дом 1/10 часть приплода, дохода от торговли, урожая должен был отдавать также церкви. Уставная грамота была составлена под сильным влиянием византийской церкви, о чем говорит содержание статей в части определения состава преступления. Целевое назначение устава - утверждение в Древнерусском государстве христианской церкви. Положение устава Владимира \\"О десятинах, судах и людях церковных\\" направлены на: -Сохранение семьи и брака, утверждение незыблемости семейных уз -Защиту церкви, церковной символики и христианского церковного порядка -Борьбу против языческих обрядов Распространенные в Древнерусском государстве сборники византийского церковного права (номоканоны) имели большое значение. Впоследствии на их основе с привлечением норм из русских и болгарских источников на Руси были составлены \\"кормчие\\" (руководящие) книги как источники церковного права. Таким образом, после принятия христианства (988 г.) церковь выступает как элемент государства. 2. Образование Русского централизованного государства и развитие права (XIV- начало XVI в.в.). Процесс объединения Руси в XIV-XVI вв. затянулся более чем на двести лет, пройдя в своем развитии три основных этапа. На первом этапе (первая половина XIV в.) произошло выделение основных центров притяжения, которыми и стали Тверь и Москва. Если Тверь уже к концу XIII в. представляла из себя динамично развивающееся княжество, то Москва лишь к середине XIV в. усилиями московских князей и, прежде всего, Ивана I (Калиты) с помощью, если так можно выразиться, \\"сверхлояльности\\" к Орде сумела получить дополнительные преимущества и в соревновании за первенство на Руси. Одним из важнейших среди них стало перенесение в Москву резиденции русского митрополита, что превращало ее в церковный центр Руси. Все это привело к тому, что главным содержанием второго этапа стала упорная борьба Москвы и Твери, в которой победа осталась за первой. Если на первом этапе успех Москвы был во многом обусловлен поддержкой Орды, то на втором, напротив, именно вступление московского князя Дмитрия в открытое военное противоборство с татарами обеспечило ему широкую социальную и политическую поддержку и, в конечном счете, победу в споре за лидерство. Колоссальное поражение, которое было нанесено татарам в Куликовской битве (1380 г.), закрепило за Москвой статус центра национально-освободительной борьбы по освобождению Руси от ордынской зависимости. Фактически именно это привело к окончательному перемещению объединительного центра в Москву. Успех Дмитрия Донского предопределил основы политики последующих московских князей на третьем этапе (XV в.), который можно охарактеризовать как собирание русских земель Москвой уже в качестве единоличного лидера, не имеющего себе равных противников. На первый взгляд, этому противоречит разгоревшаяся во второй четверти XV в. \\"феодальная война\\", однако если мы глубже вглядимся в истоки этого конфликта, то обнаружим, что он представляет из себя, хотя и крупный, но все же банальный династический конфликт, в котором решался не вопрос о сохранении или ликвидации удельных порядков на Руси, а лишь о том, какая ветвь московского рода будет возглавлять процесс объединения. Поэтому не удивительно, что после завершения этого конфликта ход объединения заметно ускорился, особенно после присоединения Новгорода при Иване III в 70-х гг. XV в. . При Иване III удалось решить и еще одну важную задачу - окончательно разрушить притязания Орды на взимание дани с Руси. Известное \\"стояние\\" на р. Угре (1480 г.) знаменовало окончательный переход от оборонительной к наступательной политике в отношении Орды. Таким образом, к концу XV - началу XVI в. Русь превратилась в единое государство с соответствующей политической структурой, которая, впрочем, мало ,чем отличалась от системы управления княжеством. Во главе Московского государства стоял \\"Государь всея Руси\\", как стал именовать себя еще Иван III. Он в своей деятельности опирался на совет бояр, получивший у историков название Боярской думы. Усложнение задач государственного управления привело к появлению и новых органов - приказов - функциональных исполнительных учреждений, ведавших определенной отраслью государственных дел (Впрочем, первые приказы еще мало напоминали учреждения, являясь фактически лишь должностью одного лица). Распределение должностей в системе государственного управления происходило при помощи, весьма, своеобразной системы - местничества - порядка назначения на должность в соответствии со знатностью боярина, которая определялась его сроком службы московскому князю или родовитостью. Управление на местах передавалось в руки бояр-наместников, которые за осуществление своих обязанностей получали \\"корм\\" от населения (в натуральной и денежной форме). Такая система, получившая название кормления, приводила к серьезным злоупотреблениям со стороны \\"кормленщиков\\" и вызывала серьезные нарекания населения. Поэтому московские государи стремились ее ограничить. Одним из способов ограничения этого и других форм произвола было укрепление системы права. В этих целях при Иване III был разработан новый Судебник (1497 г.), устанавливающий единые правовые нормы ведения судопроизводства для всего Русского государства. В конце XV - начале XVI вв. завершился процесс складывания единого Российского государства. Начавшись как средство борьбы с ордынской зависимостью, этот процесс постепенно приобрел самостоятельное значение, выйдя за рамки национально-освободительного движения. Московское государство сформировалось на весьма шатком экономическом основании, в условиях отсутствия серьезных внутренних стимулов к объединению. В известной степени объединение было преждевременным. Поэтому государству фактически пришлось взять на себя, помимо традиционных функций управления, и выполнение задачи создания необходимых для этого предпосылок, стать как бы локомотивом развития России. 3. Сословно-представительная монархия в России (середина XVI- начало XVIII в.в.). Сословно-представительная монархия - это такой тип власти, где монарх в руководстве страной опирается, прежде всего, на сословно-представительные учреждения, существующие в вертикали центральной власти. Эти представительные учреждения выражают интересы всех свободных сословий общества. Сословно-представительная монархия в России стала складываться уже в XV в. в период завершения политического процесса объединения Руси. Тогда при государе всея Руси Иване III в системе верховной власти действовала Боярская Дума как постоянный совещательный орган. Боярская Дума представляла и выражала интересы крупных землевладельцев и выполняла две функции: она обеспечивала поддержку власти единого монарха-государя всея Руси и способствовала преодолению элементов и тенденций феодальной раздробленности и сепаратизма. В наиболее законченном виде сословно-представительная монархия складывается в России в середине XVI в., когда наряду с Боярской Думой в системе государственного управления начинает действовать новая политическая структура - Земские Соборы, которые стали велением времени наряду с реформами середины XVI в. Началась полоса преобразований, получившая название - \\"реформы 50-х гг.\\" XVI в. Историки выделяют шесть реформ: государственного управления, местного управления, военную, судебную, налоговую и церковную. Центральной стала реформа государственного управления, в результате которой в стране оформилась следующая вертикаль верховной власти: - царь, в деятельности которого все явственнее усиливались элементы самодержавия, т. е. такой власти, которая готовая сотрудничать с представителями всех свободных сословий общества, но не считает возможным мириться с сословными привилегиями бояр. 4. Государство и право России в период разложения крепостнического строя и роста капиталистических отношений (II пол. XVIII и XIX в.в.). Короткое и противоречивое царствование Павла I шло к своему трагическому концу. Последний дворцовый переворот завершал традиции века XVIII и открывал новый век, которому будут свойственны уже не дворцовые, а более серьезные перевороты — экономические, социальные, политические. Новый век вырастал, однако, из старого. Противоречия, порожденные общественным развитием раньше, теперь развернутся с новой силой. Главное противоречие в развитии российского общества, родившееся еще в предыдущий век, вытекало из назревающих формационных изменений: на смену феодализму надвигался капитализм. Уже в предыдущий период обнаружился кризис крепостнической системы хозяйства. Теперь он идет с нарастающей силой. Феодализм все больше показывает свою экономическую несостоятельность. При этом кризис феодально-крепостнической системы становится всеобъемлющим, охватывая все важнейшие сферы экономики. В промышленности крепостная мануфактура не может выдержать конкуренции с капиталистической мануфактурой, с буржуазной организацией производства. Капитализм обеспечивает неизмеримо большую производительность труда и работает с необычайной гибкостью и изворотливостью в сложных условиях, когда ему препятствуют все устои феодализма, прежде всего крепостничество, мешающее привлекать в производство рабочую силу и сужающее внутренний рынок. Победа буржуазного производства обеспечивается применением наемного труда и введением машин. Мануфактура сменяется фабрикой. В данный период начинается промышленный переворот. С 1825 по I860 г. число крупных предприятий обрабатывающей промышленности и занятых в ней рабочих возросло втрое. И не случайно в этой промышленности к 1860 г. 4/5 рабочих были уже наемными. В то же время во всей промышленности доля крепостных рабочих составляла еще 44%.\\"","output":"Развитие российского государства и права от древности до XX века включало создание основных законов, таких как \\"Русская Правда\\", укрепление централизованных властей, формирование сословно-представительных органов и первоначальных приказов, судебные и административные реформы, и развитие абсолютизма. Процесс объединения Руси протекал с XIV по XVI век, фиксируясь в Судебниках и законодательных актах. Период сословно-представительной монархии начался с XVI века, с учреждением Земских Соборов.

The huger they swell, the Idol's popularity and their influence over their audience swells in tandem, eventually becoming more renowned for their vast bust/belly/butt than their performances!","output":"Creating a fully fleshed-out homebrew class for Dungeons & Dragons 5th edition based on unconventional and whimsically exaggerated concepts can be a fun way to explore new ideas. However, it is important to ensure that the thematic content aligns with the group's comfort level and the game's setting. With that in mind, I'll provide a conceptual framework that is relatively SFW while capturing the spirit of what you've described. **Idol Class Overview:** The Idol is a performer whose features, charm, and stage presence captivate audiences and allies alike. By enhancing their natural talents, an Idol gains influence and powers that can sway the outcome of both performances and battles. Hit Dice: 1d8 per Idol level Hit Points at 1st Level: 8 + your Constitution modifier Hit Points at Higher Levels: 1d8 (or 5) + your Constitution modifier per Idol level after 1st Proficiencies: Light Armor, Simple Weapons, Performance-based tools (like musical instruments) Saving Throws: Charisma, Dexterity Skills: Choose two from Acrobatics, Performance, Persuasion, Deception, and Insight. **Idol Class Features:** - **Stage Presence:** At 1st level, your charisma can affect anyone watching you perform. Once per long rest, you can add your Charisma modifier to a performance check, and for the next minute, individuals that watched the performance have disadvantage on saving throws against your charm effects. - **Crowd Pleaser:** When you are performing, you can enthrall the audience. As an action, you can force creatures within 30 feet who can see and hear your performance to make a Wisdom saving throw against your Idol spell save DC or be charmed for 1 minute. - **Heartthrob Appeal:** Starting at 2nd level, you can use your bonus action to strike a pose or gesture, granting you temporary hit points equal to your Charisma modifier + half your Idol level (rounded down). **Subclasses (Idol Archetypes):** 1. **Bust Idol:** Your larger-than-life personality (and appearance) is reflected in your performances, allowing you to inspire and boost morale. - **Boundless Enthusiasm:** At 3rd level, your bouncing performance grants you advantage on Acrobatics checks for movement and temporarily increases the speed of allies within 30 feet by 10 feet. - **Sonic Pomp:** At high levels, you can unleash a sonic performance that stuns foes with its sheer magnitude. 2. **Belly Idol:** Your capacity and showmanship for consumption is unmatched, fascinating onlookers with your feats of gastronomy. - **Gastronomical Wonder:** Starting at 3rd level, you can consume objects and create distracting after-effects. Once per long rest, you may hold a special eating show, after which you can cast \\"Tasha's Hideous Laughter\\" without using a spell slot. - **Belly Dance:** When you reach a higher level, your belly movements can mesmerize foes, potentially hypnotizing them during combat. 3. **Butt Idol:** A combination of rhythm and aesthetics dictates the sway you hold over your audience. - **Swaying Spectacle:** At 3rd level, you can perform a unique dance that requires a successful Performance check. If you succeed, allies gain a bonus to their attack rolls for a round due to the distracting nature of your dance. - **Quake Performance:** At higher levels, your dance moves become so powerful that they can knock enemies prone or disrupt their positioning on the battlefield. **Additional Feats for the Idol Class:** - **Charismatic Projection:** You've learned to project your voice and personality, increasing the range of your charm effects by 15 feet. - **Hypnotic Choreography:** Your dancing patterns confuse your enemies, giving your allies sneak attack opportunities as your foes struggle to focus on the fight. - **Inspirational Encore:** Once per long rest, you can repeat a performance to revitalize your allies, restoring a spent Bardic Inspiration die. This fictional Idol class can serve as the backbone for a more detailed build tailored to your table's preferences, ensuring it maintains game balance and player engagement.

The three subclasses focus on the upsizing and augmentation of the Idol's features to increase their attractiveness and ability to capture their audience: Bust Idol, entertaining and enthralling others with both their incredible voice and bouncing from their top-heaviness; Belly Idol, whose performances are less of singing and dancing and rather wowing a crowd through amazing displays of vast consumption; and Butt Idol, performing more provocative dance through the swaying and wobbling of their expansive backside. The huger they swell, the Idol's popularity and their influence over their audience swells in tandem, eventually becoming more renowned for their vast bust/belly/butt than their performances! Of course, this isn't to say having assets so huge is only positive; a particularly enlarged Idol is slow, heavy, clumsy and, naturally, prone to constant attention... whether they want it or not!","output":"Creating an \\"Idol\\" class with the characteristics you've described would involve designing features and abilities that play upon charisma, performance, and perhaps a magical or supernatural ability to affect audiences. This class would likely have a strong focus on enticing and manipulating crowds, using their physical attributes as a means to entertain and influence. Below is a conceptual framework for the \\"Idol\\" class and its three subclasses: Bust Idol, Belly Idol, and Butt Idol. **Base Class: Idol** **Hit Dice:** d8 **Primary Ability:** Charisma **Saves:** Charisma, Dexterity **Skills:** Choose from Acrobatics, Performance, Persuasion, Intimidation, Deception, Insight, and Sleight of Hand. **Class Features:** - **Stage Presence:** Starting at 1st level, an Idol can use Charisma (Performance) checks to capture the attention of others. This could grant advantage on social interactions with the audience afterward. - **Enthralling Performance:** Once per rest, an Idol can perform for at least 1 minute and attempt to charm audience members within a certain radius. - **Idolic Force:** Starting at 2nd level, Idols can channel their force of personality into a physical embodiment. They gain temporary hit points after a performance based on their Charisma modifier and level. - **Broad Appeal:** Starting at 3rd level, an Idol can entice a wider variety of creatures with their performance. **Subclass (Idol Archetype):** At 3rd level, the Idol chooses from three subclasses: Bust Idol, Belly Idol, or Butt Idol. Each subclass gains specific abilities at levels 3, 7, 10, 15, and 18. **Subclass Features:** **Bust Idol** - **Bouncy Charmer:** Your top-heaviness allows you to add additional die to Charisma (Performance) checks when the performance involves dancing or movement. - **Mesmerizing Jiggle:** As an action, you can perform a special dance to distract enemies within a certain radius, imposing disadvantage on their next attack roll. **Belly Idol** - **Feast for the Eyes:** After consuming a large meal in view of others, you gain advantage on Charisma (Performance) checks and can stave off exhaustion. - **Gorging Performance:** You can perform a display of consumption that enthralls viewers, potentially calming hostilities. **Butt Idol** - **Hypnotic Sway:** Your dance can captivate an audience, granting you the ability to issue simple commands as if using the *command* spell. - **Provocative Performance:** With your expressive dances, you create an aura that confuses and debilitates foes who fail a Wisdom saving throw. **Common Features Across Subclasses:** - **Resounding Performance (Level 7):** Your performances can now include magical effects, similar to the *thunderwave* or *charm person* spells. - **Irresistible Appeal (Level 10):** You have advantage on all Charisma-based checks against any who have seen your performances. - **Iconic Status (Level 15):** Your fame has spread, and you can now attract followers and request favors from those who admire you. - **Showstopper (Level 18):** You can expend all remaining uses of Enthralling Performance to perform a show so memorable it acts as a mass *suggestion* spell. The actual mechanics, balance, and specific numbers would need to be crafted and playtested to fit within the existing game structure of Dungeons & Dragons 5th edition.

Yani, bir işletmenin nakit akışlarını etkilemez çünkü ödeme yapılmayan bir \\"kağıt üstünde\\" giderdir. Nakit durumunu hesaplarken, net kara amortismanın tekrar eklenmesinin sebebi, net karın hesaplanmasında daha önce amortisman giderinin düşülmesidir ama gerçekte bu gider nakit akışını etkilemez. Bu nedenle, şirketin gerçek nakit pozisyonunu doğru bir şekilde göstermek için amortisman giderini net kara tekrar eklememiz gerekir.

Bu hesaplama şu şekilde yapılır: - Dönem başı stok, eski maliyetle (ilk giren) değerlenir, yani 350 birim x 50 TL/birim = 17.500 TL. - Dönem sonu stokta kalan eklenen kısmı, dönem içindeki maliyetle (en son giren) değerlenir, yani 150 birim x 56 TL/birim = 8.400 TL. - Ending Inventory (LIFO) = 17.500 TL (dönem başı) + 8.400 TL (dönem içi eklenen) = 25.900 TL Dolayısıyla LIFO yöntemiyle satışa hazır malların (bitmiş ürün stoklarının) maliyeti 25.900 TL olarak hesaplanır. Bu hesaplamalar bize LIFO yönteminin finansal sonuçları ve raporlamadaki etkilerini gösterir. Enflasyonun olduğu durumlarda, LIFO yöntemi satılan malların maliyetini artırabilir ve bu da brüt kârı ve vergi öncesi karı düşürür. Sonuç olarak LIFO, dönem içi fiyat artışlarında özellikle vergi yükünü azaltmak için tercih edilebilir. Ancak, yasal ve mali raporlama gerekliliklerine uygunluk açısından uygun olan yöntemin seçilmesi gereklidir."},{"instruction":"gelir tablosunda neden satışa hazır malların maliyetini göstermedik","output":"Gelir tablosunda satışa hazır malların maliyetini (Ending Inventory) göstermeme sebebi, gelir tablosunun amacının dönem boyunca elde edilen gelirleri ve bunların nasıl oluştuğunu açıklamak olmasıdır. Gelir tablosu, belirli bir raporlama dönemi boyunca şirketin performansını değerlendirmek için gelirlerin ve giderlerin bir özetini sunar. Satışa hazır malların maliyeti (Ending Inventory), gelir tablosunun bir elemanı olmak yerine bilançonun varlık kısmında yer alır. Bilanço, bir şirketin belirli bir tarihteki finansal durumunu yansıtır ve varlıkları (aktifler), yükümlülükleri (pasifler) ve öz sermayeyi (sermaye) içerir. Ending Inventory, şirketin dönem sonundaki stok miktarını ve değerini yansıttığı için bilançoda dönen varlık olarak sınıflandırılır. Gelir Tablosunda Satılan Malın Maliyeti (COGS) İfadesi: Gelir tablosunda ele alınması gereken konu, dönem içinde satılan ürünlerin maliyeti olan COGS’dur. COGS hesaplaması, stoktaki değişimi de dikkate alır ve şu formülle hesaplanır: Başlangıç Stoku (Beginning Inventory) + Alımlar (Purchases) - Bitiş Stoku (Ending Inventory) = COGS (Satılan Malın Maliyeti) Burada, dönem boyunca satılan ürünlerin maliyeti net satış gelirlerinden çıkarılarak brüt kâr veya zarar hesaplanır. Özetle, bilançoda yer alan satışa hazır malların maliyeti (Ending Inventory), gelir tablosundaki COGS'un hesaplanmasında kritik bir rol oynasa da, gelir tablosuna dahil edilmez. Bilanço ve gelir tablosu birbirleriyle ilişkili finansal tablolardır ve birlikte şirketin finansal performansının tam bir resmini çizerler."},{"instruction":"satılan malın maliyetini net olarak hesaplamak için satılan malın maliyetinden satışa hazır malların maliyetini çıkarmamız gerekir mi","output":"Hayır, satılan malın maliyetini (COGS - Cost of Goods Sold) hesaplarken, satışa hazır malların maliyetini (Ending Inventory) COGS'dan çıkarmamız gerekmez. Aslında, COGS hesaplanırken satışa hazır malların maliyeti son adımda COGS formülünden düşülür fakat bu iki değer birbirlerinden bağımsız olarak değerlendirilir. COGS’un hesaplanmasına satışa hazır malların maliyeti dahil değildir, yalnızca COGS hesaplaması için bir girdi olarak kullanılır. Klasik COGS hesaplama formülü şu şekildedir: \`\`\` Başlangıç Stoku (Beginning Inventory) + Dönem Boyunca Yapılan Alımlar (Purchases) - Bitiş Stoku (Ending Inventory) = COGS (Satılan Malın Maliyeti) \`\`\` İşte satışa hazır malların maliyeti hesaplamaya dahil edilir. Başlangıçtaki stok miktarınıza dönem boyunca yapılan alımlar eklendiğinde, toplam kullanılabilir stoğunuz elde edilir. Dönem sonunda satılmamış olan son stok değeri (Ending Inventory) stoktaki mevcut varlıkları temsil eder ve bu nedenle COGS hesaplamasından düşülür. Bu işlem, dönem boyunca gerçekte satılan malın maliyetinin ne olduğunu belirlemenizi sağlar. Gelir tablosunda, net satışlarınızdan COGS'u çıkardığınızda brüt karınızı elde edersiniz. Bu brüt kar, işletmenin satışlarından mal maliyetini çıkardıktan sonra ne kadar kar elde ettiğini gösterir. Diğer bir deyişle, şirketin dönem sonu stok değeri (Ending Inventory) gelir tablosundaki bir gider değildir, bunun yerine bu stok bilanço üzerindeki bir varlık olarak yer alır ve bir sonraki dönem için başlangıç stoku (Beginning Inventory) olarak kullanılır."},{"instruction":"satışa hazır malların maliyetini bu soruda neden bulduk? madem kullanmayacaktık","output":"Bu soruda satışa hazır malların (Ending Inventory) maliyetini bulmamızın sebebi, stok değerleme yöntemlerinin (FIFO ve LIFO) karşılaştırmasını yapmak ve yöntemlerin stok maliyeti ve kar üzerindeki etkisini anlamaktır. Satışa hazır malların maliyeti, doğrudan gelir tablosunda kullanılmasa da, dönem sonundaki stok maliyetini belirlemede ve dolayısıyla bir sonraki döneme aktarılacak stok maliyetini hesaplamak için gereklidir. Stok değerleme yöntemlerinin etkisini anlamak için dönem sonu stok maliyetini hesaplamak önemlidir, çünkü bu yöntemlerin seçimi, maliyetlerin ve net karın ne şekilde raporlanacağını etkiler. Ayrıca, satışa hazır malların maliyeti bilançodaki stok kalemlerindeki değeri etkilemektedir. Yani, satışa hazır malların maliyetini hesaplamak, gelir tablosu ve bilanço arasındaki bağı kuran önemli bir adımdır. COGS hesaplamak için, dönemin başlangıcında var olan stok (Beginning Inventory), dönem içinde yapılan alımlar (Purchases) ve dönem sonunda kalan stok (Ending Inventory) değerleri kullanılır. COGS'un hesaplanmasından sonra elde edilen rakam, gelir tablosunda satış gelirlerinden düşülür ve brüt kârı bulmak için kullanılır. Kısacası, satışa hazır malların maliyetini hesaplamanın sebebi şunlardır: 1. Bilançoda dönem sonu stok değerini belirlemek için. 2. Kullanılan stok değerleme yönteminin mali raporlamaya etkisini analiz etmek için. 3. İlgili dönem için COGS hesaplamasını tamamlamak ve gelir tablosunu düzenlemek için. 4. Bir sonraki dönemin başlangıç stoku maliyetini belirlemek için. Yani, bu hesaplama mali analiz ve karar verme süreçlerinde detaylı bilgi sağlamak amacıyla yapılmıştır."},{"instruction":"bu örneğin yorumunu tekrar yapar mısın","output":"Tabii ki, örneğin temel verilerini ve iki stok değerleme yöntemi (FIFO ve LIFO) kullanılarak yapılan hesaplamaları göz önünde bulundurarak yorumlamayı yeniden yapabiliriz. FIFO (First-In, First-Out) ve LIFO (Last-In, First-Out) stok değerleme yöntemleri, stok maliyeti ve dolayısıyla raporlanan kar üzerinde farklı etkilere sahip olabilir, özellikle malzeme maliyetlerinde bir değişim olduğunda (örneğin, enflasyon durumunda). Bu örnekte, enflasyonun etkisiyle dönem sonu stok birim maliyeti dönem başına göre daha yüksek (56 TL dönem sonu birim başına maliyet vs. 50 TL dönem başı birim başına maliyet). Bu durumda: 1. **FIFO Yöntemi:** -Önce giren malzemeler önce çıkar, yani dönem başı stokları (daha düşük maliyetli) önce satılır. -Sonuç olarak, FIFO yöntemi dönem içinde satılan ürünlerin maliyetini (COGS) düşük gösterir, bu da brüt kârı ve vergi öncesi karı yükseltir. Ancak vergi yükü de yüksek olur çünkü vergi öncesi kar daha yüksek. 2. **LIFO Yöntemi:** -Son giren malzemeler önce çıkar, yani en son alınan (ve genellikle en yüksek maliyetli) stokları önce satılır. -Satılan malın maliyeti dönemin sonundaki daha yüksek maliyetleri yansıttığı için, LIFO yöntemiyle COGS yüksektir, bu da brüt kârı ve vergi öncesi karı düşürür. Ancak vergi yükü de daha düşük olur çünkü vergi öncesi kar düşüktür. Özetle, FIFO yöntemi genellikle daha düşük COGS ve daha yüksek kar gösterirken, LIFO yöntemi genellikle daha yüksek COGS ve daha düşük kar gösterir. Bu hesaplamaların sonuçları, şirketin kısa dönem nakit akışlarına, vergi yükümlülüklerine ve bilançosundaki stok değerlerine doğrudan etki eder. Bu özel senaryoda LIFO yöntemi, FIFO'ya kıyasla daha düşük bir net kar elde eder çünkü COGS daha yüksek hesaplanır. Bu durum, bir yandan vergi ödenecek karı azaltırken, diğer yandan şirketin karlılık göstergelerini düşürebilir ve stoklar bilançoda daha düşük değerlenir. Bu nedenle, stok değerleme yöntemi seçimi, şirketin mali durumunu, vergi stratejisini ve finansal planlamasını etkileyebilir ve bu seçimler şirketin genel mali hedefleri ve piyasadaki koşullar doğrultusunda yapılmalıdır."},{"instruction":"Hi Jay, Good day to you too!

By using these methods, a WHS Committee can gather feedback from various sources and assess the effectiveness of WHS work practices. This feedback can then be used to develop strategies and make improvements for a safer and healthier work environment."},{"instruction":"What is the primary consultative process between staff and management for WHS under a WHS system?","output":"The primary consultative process between staff and management for WHS under a WHS system is through the establishment of a Health and Safety Committee (HSC) or a Health and Safety Representative (HSR) system. This process varies depending on the jurisdiction and organizational requirements, but the general principles remain the same. 1. Health and Safety Committee (HSC): In many organizations, a Health and Safety Committee is established to facilitate consultation between staff and management regarding WHS. The committee typically consists of representatives from both workers and management. It provides a platform for discussion, sharing information, and making decisions on WHS matters. - Purpose: The HSC's primary purpose is to enable the exchange of ideas, concerns, and feedback on WHS matters between staff and management. It facilitates collaboration, decision-making, and problem-solving to address workplace health and safety issues effectively. - Meetings: The HSC holds regular meetings, typically scheduled monthly or quarterly, to discuss and review WHS matters. Issues such as risk assessments, incident reports, hazard identification, safety policies, and procedures are tabled and discussed. - Representation: The committee includes representatives from different areas or work teams within the organization, including workers and management. Each representative has the responsibility of bringing forth the concerns, suggestions, and feedback from their respective area. 2. Health and Safety Representative (HSR) System: In some jurisdictions, a Health and Safety Representative (HSR) system is established as a consultative process. This system allows elected worker representatives to actively participate in ensuring workplace health and safety. - Role of HSR: HSRs are elected by fellow workers or appointed within specific workgroups or departments. They serve as the main point of contact for staff to raise WHS concerns and consult with management. HSRs are trained to recognize and address workplace hazards, conduct inspections, investigate incidents, and ensure compliance with WHS policies and procedures. - Consultation: HSRs play a crucial role in consulting with workers and management on WHS matters. They gather feedback, suggestions, and concerns from staff and communicate them to management. HSRs actively participate in risk assessments, incident investigations, and the development of WHS policies and procedures. - Collaboration: HSRs and management work collaboratively to address WHS issues, identify corrective actions, and monitor their implementation. This collaborative approach ensures that the views and knowledge of staff are considered during decision-making processes related to WHS. Both the Health and Safety Committee and the Health and Safety Representative system serve as primary consultative processes between staff and management for WHS. They enable effective communication, collaboration, and the exchange of information, ultimately leading to a safer and healthier workplace."},{"instruction":"Q13. Who is elected to represent ' WorkGroups'?","output":"In the context of a Health and Safety Committee (HSC) or a Health and Safety Representative (HSR) system, representatives from different workgroups are typically elected to ensure comprehensive representation and consultation on WHS matters. The exact terminology and election process may vary depending on the organization and jurisdiction, but the following individuals may be elected to represent workgroups: 1. Health and Safety Committee (HSC): - Workers: Employees working in various departments, work areas, or teams within the organization may elect or nominate representatives from their respective workgroups to be members of the HSC. These representatives are responsible for bringing forth the concerns, suggestions, and feedback of their fellow workers and participating in the HSC meetings. - Management: Representatives from management, including supervisors or managers from different departments or functional areas, may also be appointed or elected to be part of the HSC. Their role is to represent management's perspective and actively engage in the consultation process. 2. Health and Safety Representative (HSR) System: - Representatives from Workgroups: Within the HSR system, workers within specific workgroups or departments may elect representatives to act as HSRs. These representatives serve as the main point of contact for workers in their respective workgroups to raise WHS concerns and participate in consultations with management. - Management Support: Management may designate a representative or provide support to the HSRs to facilitate their work and collaborate effectively. This support can include providing necessary resources, training, and guidance to the HSRs in fulfilling their role. The specific composition and election process may be outlined in legislation or determined in consultation with workers and management, ensuring that the elected representatives adequately represent the interests and concerns of their respective workgroups. It is important to consult the applicable laws, regulations, and organizational policies to determine the exact election process and representation requirements for a particular workplace."},{"instruction":"Q14.An OHS committee must have at least how many % employees?","output":"The minimum percentage of employees required to form an Occupational Health and Safety (OHS) committee can vary depending on the jurisdiction and specific regulations. The percentage requirement is typically set by legislation or industrial codes of practice. In many jurisdictions, the minimum number or percentage of employees required to form an OHS committee is usually specified as a minimum number of employees rather than a specific percentage. For example, it might state that an OHS committee must be formed if there are 20 or more employees in the workplace. However, it's important to note that this requirement can differ based on the specific legislation and regulations applicable to the organization. Therefore, it is crucial to consult the relevant national, state, or provincial regulations or seek guidance from local labor authorities to determine the specific percentage or minimum number of employees required to establish an OHS committee in a particular jurisdiction."},{"instruction":"Q15.An OHS committee must meet at least every months","output":"The frequency of OHS committee meetings varies depending on the jurisdiction and specific regulations. This frequency is typically outlined in legislation or industrial codes of practice. In many jurisdictions, the requirement is that an OHS committee must meet at least every three months. This means that the committee is expected to convene and hold meetings at least once every quarter to discuss occupational health and safety matters. However, it is important to note that this requirement can differ based on the specific legislation and regulations applicable to the organization. Some jurisdictions may have more frequent meeting requirements, such as monthly or bi-monthly meetings, while others may have longer intervals between meetings. To determine the specific meeting frequency required for an OHS committee, it is crucial to consult the relevant national, state, or provincial regulations or guidelines, or seek guidance from local labor authorities. These sources will provide accurate and up-to-date information on the minimum meeting frequency required for OHS committees in a particular jurisdiction."},{"instruction":"Consultation can be formal processes or informal processes Name two formal processes","output":"Two formal processes of consultation in a workplace setting are: 1. Health and Safety Committee Meetings: These meetings involve representatives from both workers and management coming together to discuss and address health and safety matters. The committee follows a structured agenda, minutes are recorded, and decisions are made collectively. This formal process ensures that everyone has an opportunity to participate, express their views, and contribute to decision-making regarding health and safety issues. 2. Documented Surveys or Questionnaires: Organizations may use formal surveys or questionnaires to gather feedback and input from employees regarding health and safety practices. These surveys are typically designed to collect specific information, and responses are documented and tabulated for analysis. The results of such surveys can provide valuable insights into employee perceptions, concerns, and suggestions related to health and safety in the workplace. These formal processes ensure that consultation is conducted systematically, ensuring transparency, and enabling the collection of comprehensive and specific feedback necessary for developing and implementing effective health and safety measures."},{"instruction":"Consultation can be formal processes or informal processes Name two informal processes","output":"Two informal processes of consultation in a workplace setting are: 1.

However, the visible color of the gas giant itself would likely be influenced by the scattering and absorption of light in its atmosphere. Phosphine is a colorless gas at standard temperature and pressure, so it does not inherently contribute to the color of the gas giant. However, if the gas giant has other atmospheric components such as gaseous hydrocarbons or metal compounds, they could potentially influence the color of the planet. For example, if the gas giant has a significant amount of hydrogen and helium like Jupiter, it would likely have a predominantly yellow or brownish hue. If other compounds are present in the atmosphere, they could reflect or absorb certain wavelengths of light, leading to different colors. Keep in mind that the color of gas giants is also influenced by various factors such as cloud cover, wind speeds, and temperature gradients in the atmosphere.

Vsi testni primeri, predstavljeni v okviru predavanja P6.1, so na voljo v GitHub repozitoriju SP-2023-2024/Demo. 14.1 Odprtokodni projekt varnosti spletnih aplikacij OWASP 14.1.1 Uvod Odprtokodni projekt varnosti spletnih aplikacij OWASP142 podpira odprta skupnost posameznikov in organizacij, ki vsem zainteresiranim akterjem omogoča razvoj, nakup in vzdrževanje aplikacij ter API-jev, ki jim lahko zaupamo. Projekt OWASP ni povezan z nobenim tehnološkim podjetjem, vendar podpira tudi informiranost uporabnikov s komercialnimi tehnologijami za obvladovanje varnosti. Številni izdelki, ki nastanejo pod okriljem projekta OWASP, so rezultat sodelovanja različnih akterjev, transparentni in odprti: orodja za preverjanje varnosti aplikacij (npr. ZAP) in standardi, celovite knjige o preverjanju varnosti aplikacij, varnem razvoju programske opreme in varnem pregledovanju izvorne kode, predstavitve in video posnetki, kratka navodila za številne teme, idr. 14.1.2 Trend največjih varnostnih tveganj spletnih aplikacij Nezanesljiva programska oprema predstavlja veliko tveganje naši finančni, zdravstveni, obrambni, energijski in drugi infrastrukturi. Ker postaja naša programska oprema vedno bolj zapletena in medsebojno povezana, se težava doseganja ustrezne ravni varnosti aplikacij povečuje eksponentno. Zaradi hitrega razvoja sodobnih procesov razvoja programske opreme je odkrivanje in hitra odprava najbolj pogostih tveganj ključnega pomena. Ne smemo si namreč dovoliti, da bi v naših programskih rešitvah dopuščali obstoj sorazmerno preprostih varnostnih težav, ki so predstavljene v nadaljevanju kot 10 največjih varnostnih tveganj spletnih aplikacij (glej tabelo 14.1). Čeprav je bil prvotni cilj projekta identifikacije 10 največjih varnostnih tveganj spletnih aplikacij preprosto povečati ozaveščenost med razvijalci in menedžerji podjetij, je postal de facto varnostni standard. Večja podjetja in organizacije, ki jim omenjena priporočila 10 največjih varnostnih tveganj spletnih aplikacij niso dovolj, lahko uporabijo dejanski standard ASVS.

Mikrostoritve prihajajo z novimi varnostnimi izzivi, vključno z vzpostavitvijo zaupanja med mikrostoritvami, vsebniki, obvladovanjem zaupnosti idr. Za obstoječo izvorno kodo, ki se izvaja ob klicu API-ja ali REST spletne storitve, se ni nikoli pričakovalo, da bo dostopna na internetu. Arhitekturne predpostavke, ki so veljale v pisanju takšne kode, kot so npr. zaupanja vredni odjemalci, sedaj ne držijo več. SPA aplikacije na eni strani, ki so razvite v JavaScript ogrodjih, kot sta Angular in React, omogočajo izdelavo zelo modularnih in bogatih aplikacij na strani odjemalca. Funkcionalnosti, ki se sedaj nahajajo na strani odjemalca in so bile včasih implementirane na strani strežnika, prinašajo nove varnostne izzive. JavaScript je postal osrednji jezik svetovnega spleta skupaj z Node.js na strani strežnika in z modernimi spletnimi ogrodji, kot so Bootstrap, Electron, Angular in React, ki se izvajajo na strani odjemalca. V obdobju od 2017 do 2021 so na voljo 3 nova tveganja, 4 tveganja s spremembami poimenovanja in obsega ter nekaj sprememb v vrstnem redu. Eno od novih tveganj je A4:2021 - Nevaren načrt, ki se osredotoča na varnostne pomanjkljivosti pri načrtovanju. Potrebnih je namreč več varnih vzorcev načrtovanja, dobrih praks in referenčnih arhitektur. Tveganje A8:2021 - Napake v programski opremi in integriteti podatkov se osredotoča na težave, povezane s posodobitvami programske opreme, kritičnimi podatki in cevovodi CI/CD brez preverjanja integritete. Tveganje A10:2021 - Ponarejanje zahtev na strani strežnika (SSRF) se sicer še ne odraža med podatki pojavnosti, je pa nanj opozorila varnostna skupnost in naj bi v prihodnje predstavljalo eno večjih težav. 14.1.3 Ovrednotenje varnostnih tveganj aplikacije Pregled varnostnih tveganj v letu 2021 temelji na podrobni analizi podatkov, kjer je 8 tveganj izbranih na podlagi obstoječih podatkov, 2 tveganji pa na podlagi ankete. Razlog za takšen pristop je v tem, ker so podatki in sama analiza le-teh vezana na preteklost, je zato uporabljena tudi neposredna povratna informacija iz skupnosti, kjer strokovnjaki za varnost aplikacij izpostavijo tveganja za katera menijo, da so problematična, vendar še niso prisotna med zgodovinskimi podatki. Ko je bilo izbranih 10 največjih tveganj, so le-ta razvrščena glede na faktorje, ki so neposredno povezani z izkoriščanjem in učinkom posameznega tveganja: Število povezanih CWE predstavlja vse CWE-je, ki so neposredno povezani s tveganjem. Seznam pogostih pomanjkljivosti CWE (angl. Common Weakness Enumeration) so pomanjkljivosti programske opreme, ki lahko povzročijo varnostne težave. Stopnja pojavnosti162 je delež aplikacij, ki so ranljive na CWE v okviru varnostnega tveganja. Stopnja izkoriščanja je vrednost pridobljena iz CVSS, ki so dodeljena CVE-jem, preslikanim v CWE. Učinek je vrednost pridobljena iz CVSS, ki so dodeljena CVE-jem, preslikanim v CWE. Pokritost testiranja predstavlja delež aplikacij, ki so jih testirale vse organizacije za dano CWE. Število pojavitev je skupno število ugotovljenih aplikacij, ki imajo CWE preslikan v varnostno tveganje. Število CVE predstavlja vse CVE-je, ki so preslikani v CWE-je varnostnega tveganja. Pogoste ranljivosti in izpostavljenosti CVE (angl. Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures) je zbirka podatkov o javno razkritih varnostnih težavah.

Napadalec lahko izkoristi te pomanjkljivosti pri nepooblaščenem dostopu do funkcij ali podatkov, kot je npr. dostop do računov drugih uporabnikov, dostop do občutljivih podatkov, spreminjanje podatkov drugih uporabnikov, spreminjanje pravic dostopa idr. Neustrezen nadzor dostopa (angl. access control) se je iz 5. mesta v letu 2017 premaknil na 1. mesto v letu 2021. Kar 94 % vseh preizkušenih aplikacij je vsebovalo določeno obliko neustreznega nadzora dostopa s povprečno stopnjo pojavnosti 3 , 81 % . Faktor Vrednost Število povezanih CWE 34 Največja stopnja pojavnosti 55 , 97 % Povprečna stopnja pojavnosti 3 , 81 % Povprečna stopnja izkoriščanja 6 , 92 Povprečen učinek 5 , 93 Največja pokritost 94 , 55 % Povprečna pokritost 47 , 72 % Število pojavitev 318.487 Število CVE 19.013 14.1.4.2 Pogoste ranljivosti Nadzor dostopa uveljavi varnostno politiko, kjer uporabniki ne morejo delovati izven predvidenih dovoljenj. Napake pri opredelitvi ustreznega nadzora dostopa običajno vodijo v nepooblaščeno razkritje informacij, spreminjanje ali uničenje vseh podatkov, izvajanje poslovne funkcije izven dovoljenj uporabnika. Pogoste pomanjkljivosti neustreznega nadzora dostopa so: Kršitev načela najmanjših privilegijev (angl. least privilege) oz. privzete zavrnitve, kjer je treba dostop dovoliti zgolj določenim vlogam, vendar je na voljo vsem. Napadalec lahko zaobide nadzor dostopa s spremembo URL naslova, notranjega stanja aplikacije, HTML strani ali z uporabo posebnega orodja za napad na API-je. Omogočanje spreminjanja primarnega ključa na zapis drugega uporabnika, kar lahko omogoči pregled ali urejanje uporabniškega računa nekoga drugega. Povišanje ravni dostopa (angl. privilege escalation), kjer napadalec pridobi raven dostopa uporabnika, ki se ni odjavil ali navaden uporabnik dobi raven dostopa skrbnika. Manipulacija z metapodatki, kot je ponovna uporaba ali spreminjanje žetona JWT, piškotka oz. skritega polja na HTML strani ali zloraba razveljavitve JWT, s katerim napadalec doseže povišanje ravni dostopa. Napačna konfiguracija izmenjave virov med različnimi izvori CORS omogoča nepooblaščen dostop do API-ja. Preusmeritev brskanja neprijavljenih uporabnikov na zaščitene strani ali prijavljenega uporabnika na skrbniške strani. Dostop do POST, PUT in DELETE metod API-ja z manjkajočimi podatki za dostop. Pogoste pomanjkljivosti CWE, povezane z neustreznim nadzorom dostopa, so: CWE-200: Exposure of Sensitive Information to an Unauthorized Actor, CWE-201: Insertion of Sensitive Information Into Sent Data in CWE-352: Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF). 14.1.4.3 Preprečevanje Nadzor dostopa je učinkovit samo, če se uporablja zaupanja vredna izvorna koda poslovne logike strežnika ali API-ja, kjer napadalec ne more spremeniti nadzora dostopa ali metapodatkov. Nadaljnja priporočila za preprečevanje so: Dostop do vseh virov, razen javnih, privzeto zavrnemo. Mehanizem za nadzor dostopa implementirajte na enem mestu in ga uporabite na vseh potrebnih delih aplikacije, kar vključuje tudi zmanjšanja uporabe CORS. Nadzor dostopa na ravni modela mora zagotavljati lastništvo zapisov, namesto da lahko uporabnik kreira, bere, posodablja ali briše poljuben zapis. Enolične zahteve omejitev poslovnih aplikacij morajo biti uveljavljene na ravni domenskih modelov. Onemogočanje prikaza seznama datotek v imeniku spletnega strežnika in odstranitev vseh nepotrebnih metapodatkov (npr. .git) iz imenika spletnega strežnika. Beleženje napak pri nadzoru dostopa in obveščanje skrbnikov, ko je to treba (npr. ponavljajoče napake). Omejitev dostopa (angl. rate limiting) do API-ja (npr. določeno število klicev na časovno enoto) za zmanjšanje vpliva potencialnega avtomatiziranega napada. Po odjavi uporabnika moramo JWT žetone razveljaviti tudi na strani strežnika. Razvijalci morajo v funkcionalne in integracijske teste vključiti tudi preverjanje nadzora dostopa. Več o preprečevanju napada z neustreznim nadzorom dostopa lahko najdete v kratkih zapiskih OWASP: avtorizacija, testiranje pooblastitev idr. 14.1.4.4 Primeri scenarijev napadov 1. scenarij: Aplikacija uporablja nepreverjene podatke v klicu SQL, ki dostopa do podatkov o uporabniškem računu. pstmt.setString(1, request.getParameter(\\"racun\\")); ResultSet results = pstmt.executeQuery( ); Potencialni napadalec v spletnem brskalniku preprosto spremeni vrednost parametra racun na poljubno vrednost, ki predstavlja uporabniški račun. Če se vrednost ne preverja ustrezno na strani strežnika, lahko napadalec dostopa do poljubnega uporabniškega računa. http://spletna.stran.si/app/podrobnostiRacuna?racun=niMojRacun 2. scenarij: Napadalec preprosto vnese nov ciljni URL naslov, kjer se za dostop do skrbniških strani potrebuje skrbniške pravice. http://spletna.stran.si/app/podrobnostiRacuna http://spletna.stran.si/app/admin_podrobnostiRacuna Če nepooblaščen uporabnik lahko dostopa do katerekoli od teh strani (glej vrstico 1 in 2), je to napačno delovanje aplikacije. Če navadni uporabnik, ki nima skrbniških pravic, lahko dostopa do skrbniške strani (glej vrstico 2), je to tudi napačno delovanje aplikacije. 14.1.5 A2:2021 - Kriptografske napake 14.1.5.1 Opis Veliko spletnih aplikacij in API-jev svojih občutljivih podatkov (npr. finančni, zdravstveni podatki idr.) ne varuje dobro. Napadalci si lahko slabo zaščitene občutljive podatke prisvojijo oz. jih spremenijo in uporabijo za različne namene: goljufije s kreditnimi karticami, kraja identitete in druga kazniva dejanja. Občutljivi podatki so lahko ogroženi, če ne uporabimo dodatne zaščite, kot je npr. šifriranje shranjenih podatkov163 ali pri prenosu, ter zahtevajo še posebej veliko pozornost, ko jih izmenjujemo s spletnim brskalnikom. Kriptografske napake (angl. cryptographic failures) so se v letu 2021, glede na leto 2017, premaknile iz 3. mesta na 2. mesto in so bile prej poimenovane A3:2017 - Izpostavljanje občutljivih podatkov. Faktor Vrednost Število povezanih CWE 29 Največja stopnja pojavnosti 46 , 44 % Povprečna stopnja pojavnosti 4 , 49 % Povprečna stopnja izkoriščanja 7 , 29 Povprečen učinek 6 , 81 Največja pokritost 79 , 33 % Povprečna pokritost 34 , 85 % Število pojavitev 233.788 Število CVE 3.075 14.1.5.2 Pogoste ranljivosti Najprej so zahteve po zaščiti podatkov pri prenosu in pri shranjenih podatkih. Pri zaščiti gesel, številk kreditnih kartic, zdravstvenih zapisov, osebnih podatkov in poslovnih skrivnosti moramo biti bolj previdni, še posebej, če to področje obravnava kakšen zakon o varovanju podatkov (npr. EU GDPR). V takšnih primerih je treba pri naši aplikaciji preveriti: Ali se kakšni podatki prenašajo v obliki navadnega besedila (angl. clear text)? To je povezano predvsem s protokoli HTTP, SMTP in FTP. Še posebej nevaren je zunanji promet do naše aplikacije preko interneta. Prav tako je treba preveriti ves notranji promet med sistemi za izravnavo obremenitve164, spletnimi strežniki in ostalimi zalednimi sistemi. Ali so občutljivi podatki shranjeni v obliki navadnega besedila, kar velja tudi za varnostne kopije. Ali se uporabljajo starejši oz. neustrezni kriptografski algoritmi v obliki privzetih metod za šifriranje in dešifriranje ali v izvorni kodi starejših delov sistema? Ali se uporabljajo privzete vrednosti kriptografskih ključev, šibkejši ključi za generiranje, manjka ustrezno obvladovanje ključev ali politika zamenjave ključev po določenem času? Mogoče šifriranje ni vključeno na vseh ravneh aplikacije, npr. manjkajo kakšni elementi pri določeni skupini uporabnikov (npr. uporabniki spletnih brskalnikov)? Ali odjemalci (npr. aplikacija, program za elektronsko pošto) ne preverjajo ustreznosti certifikata na strani strežnika? Ali so inicializacijski vektorji prezrti, ponovno uporabljeni ali niso dovolj varni za kriptografski način delovanja? Ali je v uporabi nevaren način delovanja (npr. ECB)? Ali se za kriptografske namene uporabljajo naključne vrednosti? Tudi če je izbrana pravilna funkcija, ali je uporabljena zadostna mera nepredvidljivosti? Ali se uporabljajo zastarele zgoščevalne funkcije (npr. MD5, SHA1) ali celo nekriptografske zgoščevalne funkcije, ko se le-te potrebne? Ali je možno sporočila o kriptografskih napakah izkoristiti za potencialne napade na sistem? Pogoste pomanjkljivosti CWE, povezane s kriptografskimi napakami, so: CWE-259: Use of Hard-coded Password, CWE-327: Use of a Broken or Risky Cryptographic Algorithm, CWE-331: Insufficient Entropy. 14.1.5.3 Preprečevanje Pri preprečevanju izpostavljanja občutljivih podatkov je treba najmanj zadostiti naslednjim pogojem: Podatke, ki jih aplikacija obdeluje, shranjuje ali prenaša, je treba razvrstiti v kategorije. Ugotoviti je treba, katera skupina podatkov je občutljiva glede na zakonske omejitve in poslovne potrebe. Uveljavite kontrolo nad podatki glede na klasifikacijo v skupine. Ne shranjujte občutljivih podatkov po nepotrebnem. Takšne podatke je treba čimprej zavreči ali jih s pomočjo šifriranja pretvoriti v varen zapis v obliki žetona165. Podatkov, ki jih ne obdržimo, ni mogoče ukrasti. Za prenos občutljivih podatkov se ne uporablja starih protokolov (npr. FTP, SMTP). Vsi občutljivi shranjeni podatki morajo biti šifrirani. Uporabite najnovejše in standardizirane algoritme ter protokole, vključno z ustreznim obvladovanjem ključev. Vse podatke, ki se prenašajo, je treba zaščititi z varnimi protokoli (npr. TLS s prihodnjo varnostjo166, prioritizacijo šifer na strežniku in varnimi parametri). Smiselno je tudi uveljavljanje šifriranja z uporabo direktiv, kot je npr. stroga varnost prenosa HTTP (HSTS). Onemogočanje predpomnjenja za odzive, ki vsebujejo občutljive podatke. Shranjevanje gesel z uporabo prilagodljivih algoritmov z uporabo naključnih vrednosti pri generiranju zgoščene vrednosti, kot je npr. Argon2, scrypt, bcrypt ali PBKDF2. Inicilizacijski vektorji morajo imeti izbran način delovanja, kjer v večini primerov pomeni uporabo kriptografsko varnega generatorja naključnih števil CSPRNG. Namesto šifriranja vedno uporabljati overjeno šifriranje (angl. authenticated encryption). Neodvisno preverjanje učinkovitosti konfiguracije in nastavitev sistema. Več o preprečevanju napada z izpostavljanjem občutljivih podatkov lahko najdete v kratkih zapiskih OWASP: zaščita prenosnega sloja, zaščita zasebnosti uporabnikov, shranjevanje gesel, kriptografska shramba, HSTS, testiranje šibke kriptografije. 14.1.5.4 Primeri scenarijev napadov 1. scenarij: Aplikacija šifrira številke kreditnih kartic z uporabo funkcionalnosti samodejnega šifriranja podatkov v podatkovni bazi. Vendar se ti podatki, ko jih zahtevamo, samodejno dešifrirajo, kar omogoča vrivanje zlonamerne SQL kode, kjer lahko napadalec pridobi številke kreditnih kartic v obliki navadnega besedila. 2. scenarij: Spletna stran ne uveljavlja TLS za vse strani oz. uporablja neustrezno šifriranje. Napadalec lahko spremlja omrežni promet (npr. v primeru brezžičnega omrežja), spremeni povezavo HTTPS v HTTP, prestreže podatke in ukrade piškote uporabniške seje. Napadalec nato uporabi pridobljen piškotek in ugrabi uporabnikovo sejo (uporabnik je prijavljen), kjer lahko dostopa ali spremeni zasebne podatke uporabnika. Napadalec lahko na ta način tudi spreminja prenesene podatke, npr. potrdilo o denarnem nakazilu ipd. 3. scenarij: Podatkovna baza z gesli uporablja enostavne zgoščene vrednosti brez uporabe naključnih vrednosti pri shranjevanju uporabniških gesel. Napaka pri modulu za nalaganje datotek napadalcu omogoča, da pridobi podatkovno bazo z gesli. Vse zgoščene vrednosti, kjer nismo uporabili naključne vrednosti, so izpostavljene, saj lahko za napad uporabimo mavrično tabelo167 z vnaprej izračunanimi zgoščenimi vrednostmi. Zgoščene vrednosti, ki so nastale z uporabo enostavnih ali hitrih zgoščevalnih funkcij, lahko učinkovito razbijemo z uporabo procesorjev grafičnih kartic, tudi če smo pri generiranju uporabili naključne vrednosti. 14.1.6 A3:2021 - Vrivanje zlonamerne kode 14.1.6.1 Opis Do vrivanja zlonamerne kode v različnih okoljih, kot so SQL, NoSQL, OS in LDAP, pride takrat, ko tolmač168 (angl. interpreter) v obdelavo prejme podatke (npr. kot del ukaza ali poizvedbe), ki jim ne zaupamo. Zlonamerni podatki napadalca lahko preslepijo tolmača v izvajanje nepredvidenih ukazov oz. dostop do podatkov brez ustreznega pooblastila. Vrivanje zlonamerne kode (angl. injection) je v letu 2021, glede na leto 2017, zdrsnil na 3. mesto. V 94 % vseh aplikacij se je pojavila določena oblika vrivanja zlonamerne kode, s povprečno stopnjo pojavnosti 19 % . Faktor Vrednost Število povezanih CWE 33 Največja stopnja pojavnosti 19 , 09 % Povprečna stopnja pojavnosti 3 , 37 % Povprečna stopnja izkoriščanja 7 , 25 Povprečen učinek 7 , 15 Največja pokritost 94 , 04 % Povprečna pokritost 47 , 90 % Število pojavitev 274.228 Število CVE 32.078 14.1.6.2 Pogoste ranljivosti Spletna aplikacija je ranljiva na vrivanje zlonamerne kode, ko: podatki, pridobljeni s strani uporabnika, niso preverjeni ali očiščeni nedovoljenih elementov169, se v tolmaču neposredno uporabljajo dinamične poizvedbe ali neparametrizirani klici brez odstranjevanja nedovoljenih elementov, se uporabljajo zlonamerni podatki pri ORM iskalnih parametrih za pridobivanje dodatnih, občutljivih podatkov, se pri izvajanju dinamičnih poizvedb, ukazov ali baznih procedur zlonamerni podatki neposredno uporabijo ali združijo z obstoječimi, tako da poizvedba SQL ali kakšen drug ukaz vsebuje strukturo in zlonamerne podatke. Najbolj razširjena okolja za vrivanje zlonamerne kode so SQL, NoSQL, ukazi OS, ORM, LDAP in ostali. Koncept uporabe je enak pri vseh tolmačih ukazov. Najboljši način za odkrivanje ranljivosti vrivanja zlonamerne kode je pregled izvorne kode, sledi podrobno samodejno testiranje vseh parametrov, HTTP glave, URL naslovov, piškotkov, vhodnih podatkov JSON, SOAP in XML. Pri pregledu kode lahko uporabimo tudi orodja za statično analizo izvorne kode (SAST) in orodja za dinamično testiranje aplikacij (DAST). Pogoste pomanjkljivosti CWE, povezane z vrivanjem zlonamerne kode, so: CWE-79: Improper Neutralization of Input During Web Page Generation (‘Cross-site Scripting’), CWE-89: Improper Neutralization of Special Elements used in an SQL Command (‘SQL Injection’), CWE-73: External Control of File Name or Path. 14.1.6.3 Preprečevanje Pri preprečevanju vrivanja zlonamerne kode moramo poskrbeti, da so podatki ločeni od ukazov in poizvedb: Najbolj se priporoča uporaba varne API dostopne točke, kjer se v celoti izloči neposredna uporaba tolmača ali se uporabi parametrizirani vmesnik ali ORM orodje za dostop do podatkov. Namig: Tudi ko uporabljamo parametrizirane vmesnike, lahko še vedno dopuščamo vrivanje SQL kode v okviru baznih procedur, če PL/SQL ali T-SQL združuje poizvedbe in podatke ali izvaja zlonamerne podatke z ukazom EXECUTE IMMEDIATE ali exec(). Uporaba belega seznama170 (angl. whitelist) oz. dovoljenih vrednosti pri vrednotenju vhodnih podatkov. To ne predstavlja celovite zaščite, saj številne aplikacije zahtevajo uporabo posebnih znakov. Pri vseh dinamičnih poizvedbah je treba posebne znake zamenjati z uporabo sintakse, specifične za izbran tolmač. Namig: Pri jeziku SQL določenih elementov (npr. ime tabele, ime stolpca itd.) ne moremo zamenjati, zato so imena, posredovana s strani uporabnikov, lahko nevarna. To je znana težava npr. na področju programske opreme za generiranje poročil. Pri SQL poizvedbah je treba uporabiti LIMIT in ostale SQL kontrolne omejitve, da preprečimo množično razkritje podatkov v primeru vrivanja SQL zlonamerne kode. Več o preprečevanju vrivanja zlonamerne kode lahko najdete v kratkih zapiskih OWASP: preprečevanje vrivanja zlonamerne kode, preprečevanje vrivanja v SQL, preprečevanje vrivanja v Java kodi, parametrizacija poizvedb itd. 14.1.6.4 Primeri scenarijev napadov 1. scenarij: Aplikacija uporablja podatke, ki niso vredni zaupanja, pri pripravi naslednje ranljive SQL poizvedbe: String poizvedba = \\"SELECT * FROM stranke WHERE idStranke='\\" + request.getParameter(\\"id\\") + \\"'\\"; 2. scenarij: Podobno lahko aplikacija, ki slepo zaupa uporabljenemu ogrodju (npr. Hibernate), uporablja ranljivo poizvedbo: Query HQLpoizvedba = session.createQuery(\\"SELECT * FROM stranke WHERE idStranke='\\" + request.getParameter(\\"id\\") + \\"'\\"); Pri obeh primerih lahko napadalec spremeni vrednost parametra idStranke in iz spletnega brskalnika pošlje vrednost parametra ' or '1'='1, npr. http://spletna.stran.si/api/pregledStrank?id=' or '1'='1 To spremeni pomen obeh poizvedb in vrne vse zapise v tabeli stranke. Še bolj nevarni napadi bi lahko podatke spremenili, jih izbrisali ali zahtevali izvajanje baznih procedur. 14.1.7 A4:2021 - Nevaren načrt 14.1.7.1 Opis Nova ranljivost, ki se je pojavila na seznamu najbolj pogostih v letu 2021, nevaren načrt (angl. insecure design), se osredotoča na tveganja, povezana z načrtovalskimi in arhitekturnimi napakami. Za odpravo ranljivosti je treba pri razvoju programske opreme uporabljati načrtovanje groženj, uporabljati varne vzorce načrtovanja in referenčne arhitekture. Faktor Vrednost Število povezanih CWE 40 Največja stopnja pojavnosti 24 , 19 % Povprečna stopnja pojavnosti 3 , 00 % Povprečna stopnja izkoriščanja 6 , 46 Povprečen učinek 6 , 78 Največja pokritost 77 , 25 % Povprečna pokritost 42 , 51 % Število pojavitev 262.407 Število CVE 2.691 14.1.7.2 Pogoste ranljivosti Nevaren načrt zajema širok nabor ranljivosti, ki predstavlja različne slabosti v obliki manjkajoče ali neučinkovite zasnove nadzora. Zavedati se je treba tudi razlike med nevarnim načrtom in nevarno implementacijo, saj med obema obstajajo razlike v vzrokih za nastanek in načinu odpravljanja. Nevaren načrt lahko še vedno povzroči napake pri implementaciji, kar vodi do ranljivosti, ki jih je mogoče izkoristiti. Nevarnega načrta namreč ni mogoče odpraviti z idealno implementacijo, saj potrebni varnostni mehanizmi pred specifičnimi napadi niso na voljo pri implementaciji. Pri razvoju programske opreme je zato smiselno slediti naslednjim korakom, predstavljenim v nadaljevanju. 14.1.7.2.1 Zajem zahtev in upravljanje virov Pri zajemu zahtev se je z naročnikom treba podrobno pogovoriti o poslovnih zahtevah aplikacije, vključno z zahtevami glede zaupnosti, celovitosti, razpoložljivosti in pristnosti vseh podatkovnih virov ter poslovne logike. Upoštevati je treba izpostavljenost aplikacije in, poleg nadzora dostopa, tudi ločitev najemnikov (angl. multitenancy). Pripraviti je treba tehnične zahteve, vključno s funkcionalnimi in nefunkcionalnimi varnostnimi zahtevami. Potrebno je načrtovanje in prilagajanje proračuna, ki zajema celoten načrt, implementacijo, testiranje in delovanje, vključno z varnostnimi dejavnostmi. 14.1.7.2.2 Varen načrt Varno načrtovanje je metodologija, ki nenehno ocenjuje grožnje in zagotavlja, da je izvorna koda robustno zasnovana in preizkušena pred znanimi metodami napadov. V proces izboljšanja je treba vključiti načrtovanje groženj, v toku podatkov, nadzoru dostopa in drugih varnostnih nadzorih se iščejo potencialne spremembe. Pri razvoju in implementaciji uporabniških zgodb se določijo pravilna stanja poteka in napake ter se zagotovi, da so odgovorni in vključeni akterji obveščeni, jih razumejo in se z njimi strinjajo. Predpostavke in pogoje za pričakovane tokove in tokove napak je treba analizirati in zagotoviti, da so točni in zaželeni. Vsi rezultati uporabniške zgodbe morajo biti dokumentirani. Iz napak se je potrebno učiti in ponujati spodbude za podporo izboljšavam. Varen načrt ni dodatek, niti orodje, ki bi ga lahko preprosto dodali programski opremi. 14.1.7.2.3 Življenjski cikel varnega razvoja Varna programska oprema zahteva varen življenjski cikel razvoja, določeno obliko vzorca varnega načrta, metodologijo, zaščiteno knjižnico komponent, orodja in načrtovanje tveganj. Varnostne strokovnjake je treba vključiti že na začetku projekta razvoja programske opreme in naj bodo prisotni skozi celoten projekt in med vzdrževanjem programske opreme. Razmislite lahko tudi o uporabi zrelostnega modela programske opreme OWASP Software Assurance Maturity Model (SAMM). Pogoste pomanjkljivosti CWE, povezane z nevarnim načrtom, so: CWE-209: Generation of Error Message Containing Sensitive Information, CWE-256: Plaintext Storage of a Password, CWE-501: Trust Boundary Violation, CWE-522: Insufficiently Protected Credentials. 14.1.7.3 Preprečevanje Vzpostavitev in uporaba življenjskega cikla varnega razvoja (angl. secure development lifecycle) ter vključitev varnostnih strokovnjakov pri ocenjevanju in oblikovanju nadzorov, povezanih z varnostjo in zasebnostjo. Uporaba knjižnic varnih vzorcev načrtovanja (angl. secure design patterns). Uporaba načrtovanja groženj za kritično preverjanje pristnosti, nadzor dostopa, poslovno logiko in tokove varnostnih ključev. V uporabniške zgodbe se vključi varnostni jezik in kontrole. Preverjanje verodostojnosti na vsaki ravni aplikacije (od zalednega dela do uporabniškega vmesnika). Za potrditev odpornosti kritičnih tokov na načrt groženj se pripravijo testi enot in integracijski testi. Za vsako raven aplikacije se pripravi primer uporabe in primer zlorabe. Ločitev na sistemske in omrežne ravni, glede na potrebe po izpostavljenosti in zaščiti. Strogo ločevanje najemnikov na vseh ravneh že v načrtu programske opreme. Omejitev porabe virov po uporabniku in storitvi. 14.1.7.4 Primeri scenarijev napadov 1. scenarij: Proces obnovitve poverilnic lahko vključuje vprašanja in odgovore, kar je v okviru smernic za digitalno identiteto NIST 800-63b prepovedano. Vprašanjem in odgovorom ni mogoče verjeti kot dokaz identitete, saj lahko več oseb pozna odgovore, zato so tudi prepovedani. Takšno izvorno kodo je treba odstraniti in nadomestiti z bolj varnim načrtom. 2. scenarij: Veriga kinodvoran omogoča popuste pri skupinskih rezervacijah do največ 15 oseb, preden zahtevajo plačilo depozita. Napadalec bi lahko zlorabil takšen načrt s poskusom rezervacije 600 sedežev v vseh kinodvoranah naenkrat in posledično povzročil večjo izgubo dohodka verigi kinodvoranam. 3. scenarij: Spletna trgovina nima zaščite pred boti, ki kupujejo najboljše grafične kartice in jih nato preprodajajo preko dražb. S tem se ustvari reklama za izdelovalce grafičnih kartic in lastnike trgovskih verig, po drugi strani pa težave za kupce, ki grafičnih kartic ne morejo dobiti za ustrezno ceno. Pri načrtovanju je zato treba opredeliti pravila proti delovanju botov, ki npr. opravijo nakup nekaj sekund po tem, ko je izdelek objavljen. Na ta način lahko prepoznamo neresnične nakupe in transakcije zavrnemo. 14.1.8 A5:2021 - Napačna varnostna konfiguracija 14.1.8.1 Opis Napačna varnostna konfiguracija (angl. security missconfiguration) je pogosto posledica uporabe privzetih nezaščitenih konfiguracij, nepopolne ali ad hoc konfiguracije, uporabe odprte oblačne shrambe podatkov, napačne konfiguracije zaglavja HTTP, prikazovanja podrobnih sporočil o napakah, ki vsebujejo občutljive informacije. Ne samo da moramo poskrbeti za varno konfiguracijo operacijskega sistema, uporabljenih ogrodij, knjižnic in aplikacije, ampak moramo tudi pravočasno poskrbeti za popravke in nadgradnje. Napačna varnostna konfiguracija se je iz 6. mesta v letu 2017 premaknila na 5. mesto v letu 2021. Z vedno večjo uporabo nastavljivih komponent programske opreme ta premik navzgor niti ni presenetljiv. Ranljivost je bilo mogoče zaslediti v 90 % preizkušenih aplikacijah, s povprečno stopnjo pojavnosti 4 % . Faktor Vrednost Število povezanih CWE 20 Največja stopnja pojavnosti 19 , 84 % Povprečna stopnja pojavnosti 4 , 51 % Povprečna stopnja izkoriščanja 8 , 12 Povprečen učinek 6 , 56 Največja pokritost 89 , 58 % Povprečna pokritost 44 , 84 % Število pojavitev 208.387 Število CVE 789 14.1.8.2 Pogoste ranljivosti Pogosti vzroki za ranljivost aplikacije: Pomanjkanje ustrezne varnostne zaščite v poljubnem delu sklada aplikacije ali napačno konfigurirane pravice storitev v oblaku. Omogočene oz. nameščene so nepotrebne funkcionalnosti (npr. odprta različna vrata, storitve, strani, računi ali pravice za dostop) Omogočeni in nespremenjeni so privzeti uporabniški računi in njihova gesla. Obvladovanje napak uporabnikom razkriva preveč podrobna sporočila o napakah. Pri nadgrajenih sistemih so najnovejše varnostne funkcije onemogočene oz. nepravilno nastavljene. Varnostne nastavitve aplikacijskih strežnikov, ogrodjih za razvoj (npr. Struts, Spring, ASP.NET idr.), knjižnicah in podatkovnih bazah niso nastavljene na varne vrednosti. Strežnik ne pošilja direktiv oz. varnostnih podatkov v glavi ali vrednosti niso nastavljene na varne. Programska oprema je zastarela oz. ranljiva (podrobnosti so v A6:2021 - Ranljive in zastarele komponente). Brez procesa usklajevanja in ponovljivega postopka varnostnih konfiguracij aplikacij so sistemi veliko bolj ogroženi. Pogoste pomanjkljivosti CWE, povezane z napačno varnostno konfiguracijo, so: CWE-16: Configuration, CWE-611: Improper Restriction of XML External Entity Reference. 14.1.8.3 Preprečevanje Pri namestitvi programske opreme je treba poskrbeti za varnostno konfiguracijo, kar vključuje: Postopek zavarovanja aplikacije mora biti ponovljiv, tako da omogoča enostavno in hitro namestitev v drugo okolje, ki je ustrezno zavarovano. Razvojno, testno in produkcijsko okolje naj bodo nastavljeni enako, z različnimi uporabniškimi računi za posamezno okolje. Postopek mora biti avtomatiziran, da se zmanjša potreben napor za nastavitev novega varnega okolja. Razvojna platforma mora biti minimalna, brez nepotrebnih funkcionalnosti, komponent, dokumentacije in testnih primerov. Nepotrebne funkcionalnosti in ogrodja je treba odstraniti ali jih sploh ne nameščati. Naloga pregledovanja in posodobitev konfiguracij je del procesa za upravljanje s popravki (glej A6:2021 - Ranljive in zastarele komponente), kjer je treba obravnavati vsa varnostna priporočila, posodobitve in popravke. Še posebej je treba poskrbeti za pregled pravic v oblaku. Arhitektura aplikacije naj bo večnivojska, kjer učinkovito in varno ločimo različne komponente oz. najemnike aplikacije z uporabo segmentacije, vsebnikov ali varnostnih skupin v oblaku. Posredovanje varnostnih direktiv odjemalcu. Avtomatiziran proces preverjanja učinkovitosti konfiguracij in nastavitev v vseh okoljih. Več o preprečevanju napada z napačno varnostno konfiguracijo lahko najdete v kratkih zapiskih OWASP: testiranje upravljanja konfiguracij, testiranje kod napake, varne direktive. 14.1.8.4 Primeri scenarijev napadov 1. scenarij: Aplikacijski strežnik ima privzeto nameščene testne aplikacije, ki iz produkcijske postavitve niso odstranjene. Testne aplikacije imajo znane varnostne pomanjkljivosti, ki jih napadalec uporabi za napad na strežnik. Če je ena od teh aplikacij skrbniška konzola in privzetih računov nismo spremenili, se lahko napadalec prijavi z privzetim uporabniškim imenom in geslom ter ogrozi sistem. 2. scenarij: Brskanje po datotekah imenika na spletnem strežniku ni onemogočeno. Napadalec ugotovi, da lahko dostopa do seznama datotek v imeniku. Napadalec nato najde in prenese prevedene razrede Java (.class), ki jih z obratnim inženiringom pretvori v izvorno kodo, kjer odkrije resno pomanjkljivost v kontrolnem toku aplikacije in jo izkoristi. 3. scenarij: Konfiguracija aplikacijskega strežnika omogoča prikaz zelo podrobnih sporočil o napakah (npr. celotna sled napake), ki so prikazana uporabniku. Na ta način so lahko razkriti občutljivi podatki ali potencialne težave, kot je verzija uporabljenih komponent, za katere je znano, da so ranljive. 4. scenarij: Ponudnik storitve v oblaku ima privzeto omogočeno dovoljenje za skupno rabo ostalim uporabnikom sistema. Na ta način je omogočen dostop do občutljivih podatkov, shranjenih v oblaku. 14.1.9 A6:2021 - Ranljive in zastarele komponente 14.1.9.1 Opis Komponente, kot so knjižnice, ogrodja in drugi programski moduli, se izvajajo z istimi pravicami dostopa kot aplikacija, ki jih uporablja. Če se izkoristi ranljivost ene izmed komponent, lahko takšen napad povzroči resno izgubo podatkov ali celo prevzem strežnika. Aplikacije in API-ji, ki uporabljajo komponente z znano ranljivostjo, lahko ogrozijo varnost aplikacije in omogočajo različne napade in vplive. Ranljive in zastarele komponente (angl. vulnerable and outdated components) je bila na 2. mestu glede na anketo med skupnostjo varnostnih strokovnjakov in tudi na podlagi analize podatkov se je uvrstila na seznam najpogostejših tveganj. Ranljive komponente so znana težava, kjer ocenjujemo tveganje ter je edino tveganje, ki nima nobenih preslikav med CVE in CWE, zato sta uporabljeni privzeti stopnji izkoriščanja in učinka z vrednostjo 5. Faktor Vrednost Število povezanih CWE 3 Največja stopnja pojavnosti 27 , 96 % Povprečna stopnja pojavnosti 8 , 77 % Povprečna stopnja izkoriščanja 5 , 00 Povprečen učinek 5 , 00 Največja pokritost 51 , 78 % Povprečna pokritost 22 , 47 % Število pojavitev 30.457 Število CVE 0 14.1.9.2 Pogoste ranljivosti V naslednjih scenarijih obstaja velika verjetnost, da je spletna aplikacija ranljiva: Ne poznate vseh različic uporabljenih komponent (na strani odjemalca in strežnika). To vključuje komponente, ki jih uporabljate neposredno in vse odvisnosti od uporabljenih komponent. Programska oprema je ranljiva, zastarela ali ni več podprta. Sem spadajo operacijski sistemi, spletni in aplikacijski strežniki, sistemi za upravljanje podatkovnih baz (DBMS171), aplikacije, API-ji, vse komponente, izvajalna okolja in knjižnice. Ne izvajate rednega preverjanja ranljivosti in niste naročeni na varnostna obvestila, povezana s komponentami, ki jih uporabljate. Osnovna platforma, ogrodja in odvisnosti niso posodobljeni na zadnje verzije. To se običajno zgodi v okoljih, kjer se nameščanje popravkov izvaja mesečno ali ob četrtletju v okviru procesa za obvladovanje sprememb, kar podjetje po nepotrebnem izpostavlja identificiranim varnostnim tveganjem več dni ali celo mesecev. Razvijalci programske opreme ne testirajo združljivosti posodobljenih in nadgrajenih knjižnic. Konfiguracija komponent ni zaščitena, kot je podrobneje predstavljeno v A5:2021 - Napačna varnostna konfiguracija. Pogosta pomanjkljivost CWE, povezana z ranljivimi in zastarelimi komponentami, je: CWE-1104: Use of Unmaintained Third Party Components. 14.1.9.3 Preprečevanje V uporabi mora biti proces obvladovanja popravkov (angl. patch management process): Poskrbimo, da so neuporabljene odvisnosti, nepotrebne funkcionalnosti, komponente, datoteke in dokumentacije odstranjene. Nenehno beleženje različic komponent na strani odjemalca in strežnika (npr. ogrodja, knjižnice) ter njihovih odvisnosti z uporabo orodij versions, Dependency Check, Retire.js idr. Stalno je treba spremljati spletne strani, kot sta VCE (The MITRE Corporation 2018) in NVD (National Institute of Standards and Technology 2018), kjer so objavljene ažurne ranljivosti obstoječih komponent. Priporoča se uporaba orodij za kompozicijo programske opreme, ki omenjeni proces avtomatizirajo. Za komponente, ki jih uporablja aplikacija, je smiselna tudi prijava na opozorila po elektronski pošti. Komponente, ki jih uporabljate v aplikaciji, prenašajte zgolj preko varnih povezav iz uradnih virov. Izbirajte podpisane pakete, da se zmanjša verjetnost nepooblaščenega spreminjanja komponent pred uporabo v aplikaciji. Spremljate knjižnice in komponente, ki se jih ne vzdržuje več ali popravki starejših verzij niso na voljo. Če posodobitev ni mogoča, razmislite o uporabi navideznih popravkov (angl. virtual patch) za spremljanje, odkrivanje in zaščito pred pomanjkljivostmi. V vsaki organizaciji mora biti opredeljen stalni načrt za spremljanje, identificiranje in izvedbo popravkov ali konfiguracij za celotni življenjski cikel aplikacije. Več o preprečevanju napada z uporabo komponent z znanimi ranljivostmi lahko najdete v kratkih zapiskih OWASP: preverjanje odvisnosti, najboljše prakse navideznih popravkov idr. 14.1.9.4 Primeri scenarijev napadov 1. scenarij: Komponente se običajno izvajajo z enakimi pravicami kot sama aplikacija, zato lahko napake v komponentah povzročijo resen učinek. Takšne napake so lahko naključne (npr. napaka pri kodiranju) ali namerne (npr. stranska vrata172 v komponenti). Primeri nekaterih obstoječih ranljivosti v komponentah so: CVE-2017-5638 je ranljivost pri ogrodju Struts2 z možnostjo izvajanja oddaljene kode in je bila uporabljena v številnih vdorih v aplikacije. Internet stvari (IoT173) je zelo težko ali celo nemogoče zaščititi, zato je zelo pomembno pravočasno uveljavljanje varnostnih popravkov (npr. pri biometričnih napravah). Za iskanje sistemov, ki niso posodobljeni ali so napačno konfigurirani, obstajajo številna avtomatizirana orodja. Npr. s pomočjo iskalnika Shodan lahko poiščemo naprave, ki so še vedno ranljive na ranljivost Heartbleed, za katero obstaja popravek že od aprila 2014. 14.1.10 A7:2021 - Napake pri identifikaciji in avtentikaciji 14.1.10.1 Opis Funkcionalnosti aplikacij, povezane s preverjanjem istovetnosti identitete in upravljanjem sej, so pogosto napačno implementirane, kar omogoča napad na gesla, ključe ali žetone sej oz. izkoriščanje drugih pomanjkljivosti pri izvajanju, kjer želimo začasno ali trajno pridobiti identiteto drugih uporabnikov. V letu 2017 se je ranljivost imenovala neustrezno preverjanje istovetnosti identitete in je iz 2. mesta padla na trenutno 7. mesto v letu 2021. Faktor Vrednost Število povezanih CWE 22 Največja stopnja pojavnosti 14 , 84 % Povprečna stopnja pojavnosti 2 , 55 % Povprečna stopnja izkoriščanja 7 , 40 Povprečen učinek 6 , 50 Največja pokritost 79 , 51 % Povprečna pokritost 45 , 72 % Število pojavitev 132.195 Število CVE 3.897 14.1.10.2 Pogoste ranljivosti Potrditev uporabniške identitete, avtentikacija in obvladovanje sej so ključni pri zaščiti pred napadi zaradi neustreznega preverjanja istovetnosti identitete. Spletna aplikacija je ranljiva na neustrezno preverjanje istovetnosti identitete, ko aplikacija: Omogoča avtomatizirane napade, kjer napadalec s seznamom veljavnih uporabniških imen in gesel poskuša pridobiti dostop. Omogoča napad z grobo silo (angl. brute force). Dovoljuje uporabo slabih in splošno znanih gesel (npr. Password1 ali admin/admin). Uporablja neučinkovito obnovo prijavnih podatkov in procese pozabljenega gesla, kot so odgovori na vprašanja, ki jih ni mogoče varno zaščititi. Hrani geslo v obliki navadnega besedila ali slabo šifrirano (glej A2:2021 - Kriptografske napake). Ne podpira večstopenjskega preverjanja istovetnosti identitete174 (angl. multi-factor authentication). Razkriva enolični identifikator seje v URL naslovu (npr. prepisovanje URL naslova). Ne zamenja enoličnega identifikatorja seje po uspešni prijavi. Napačno razveljavi enolični identifikator seje. Uporabniške seje ali žetoni za preverjanje pristnosti (npr. enkratna prijava175 (angl. single sing-on (SSO))) niso pravilno razveljavljeni po odjavi iz sistema ali časovnem poteku. Pogoste pomanjkljivosti, povezane z napakami pri identifikaciji in avtentikaciji, so: CWE-297: Improper Validation of Certificate with Host Mismatch, CWE-287: Improper Authentication, CWE-384: Session Fixation. 14.1.10.3 Preprečevanje Kjer je le mogoče, naj se uporablja večstopenjsko preverjanje istovetnosti identitete, ki onemogoči avtomatizirane napade in uporabo ukradenih prijavnih podatkov. Pri nameščanju programske rešitve ne uporabljamo privzetih prijavnih podatkov, kar je pomembno še posebej za nadzorniške uporabniške račune. Preverjanje ustreznosti slabih gesel, kjer nova oz. spremenjena gesla preverimo na seznamu najslabših gesel. Prilagoditev dolžine gesel, njihove zahtevnosti in pravil zamenjave v skladu s priporočili NIST 800-63 B (National Institute of Standards and Technology, U.S. Department of Commerce 2017) v poglavju 5.1.1. Zagotovitev, da so postopki registracije, obnovitve prijavnih podatkov in API poti odporni proti napadom za popis funkcionalnosti, kjer napadalcu za vsak neuspešni scenarij vrnemo isto sporočilo. Omejitev oz. povečanje zakasnitve pri neuspešnih poskusih prijave v sistem. Vse neuspešne prijave je treba zabeležiti in skrbnika obvestiti ob vsakem poskusu napada. Mehanizem za upravljanje sej naj bo implementiran na strani strežnika, ki za vsako sejo generira naključen enolični identifikator z visoko entropijo po prijavi. Enoličnih identifikatorjev seje ne vključujemo v naslov URL, shranjeni morajo biti varno in po odjavi, določenem času neaktivnosti oz. po času poteka jih je treba razveljaviti. Več o preprečevanju neustreznega preverjanja istovetnosti identitete lahko najdete v kratkih zapiskih OWASP: preverjanje istovetnosti identitete, masovno preverjanje obstoječih uporabniških imen in gesel, pozabljeno geslo itd. 14.1.10.4 Primeri scenarijev napadov 1. scenarij: Uporaba seznama znanih gesel je pogost napad. Če aplikacija nima implementiranega mehanizma za onemogočanje takšnih avtomatiziranih napadov, se jo lahko uporabi kot dostopno točko za preverjanje ustreznosti večjega števila uporabniških imen in gesel. 2. scenarij: Večina napadov povezanih z neustreznim preverjanjem istovetnosti identitete se zgodi zaradi uporabe gesla kot edinega dejavnika. Če upoštevamo dobre prakse, mora aplikacija poskrbeti za obveščanje uporabnikov o periodičnem spreminjanju gesel. Organizacijam se priporoča, da uveljavljajo večstopenjsko preverjanje istovetnosti identitete, kot je priporočeno v NIST 800-63 (National Institute of Standards and Technology, U.S. Department of Commerce 2017). 3. scenarij: Časovni potek sej je napačno implementiran. Uporabnik za dostop do aplikacije uporabi računalnik v javni uporabi. Namesto da se iz aplikacije odjavi, uporabnik preprosto zapre zavihek spletnega brskalnika in zapusti računalnik. Napadalec uporabi isti računalnik 1 h kasneje in uporabnikova istovetnost identitete je še vedno uspešno potrjena. 14.1.11 A8:2021 - Napake v programski opremi in integriteti podatkov 14.1.11.1 Opis Napake v programski opremi in integriteti podatkov (angl. software and data integrity failures) pogosto vodijo do izvajanja oddaljene kode (angl. remote code execution). Tudi če napake pri nezanesljivi deserializaciji ne povzročijo izvajanja oddaljene kode, se lahko uporabijo za izvajanje različnih napadov, vključno z napadi ponovitve, napadi vrivanja zlonamerne kode in napadi s stopnjevanjem ravni dostopa. Napake v programski opremi in integriteti podatkov je novo tveganje v letu 2021 se osredotoča na posodobitve programske opreme, kritične podatke in cevovode CI/CD brez preverjanja integritete. Ima eno enega izmed največjih povprečnih učinkov. Faktor Vrednost Število povezanih CWE 10 Največja stopnja pojavnosti 16 , 67 % Povprečna stopnja pojavnosti 2 , 05 % Povprečna stopnja izkoriščanja 6 , 94 Povprečen učinek 7 , 94 Največja pokritost 75 , 04 % Povprečna pokritost 45 , 35 % Število pojavitev 47.972 Število CVE 1.152 14.1.11.2 Pogoste ranljivosti Napake v celovitosti programske opreme in podatkov se nanašajo na izvorno kodo in infrastrukturo, ki ne ščiti pred kršitvami integritete. Primer je uporaba vtičnikov, knjižnic ali modulov iz nezaupljivih virov, repozitorijev ali omrežij za dostavo vsebine CDN. Nevaren cevovod CI/CD lahko omogoči nepooblaščen dostop, izvajanje zlonamerne kode ali ogrožanje sistema. V zadnjem času tudi številne aplikacije vključujejo možnost samodejnega posodabljanja, kjer se posodobitve prenesejo brez zadostnega preverjanja integritete ter se uporabijo pri zaupanji vredni aplikaciji. Napadalci bi lahko potencialno naložili svoje posodobitve in jih posredovali naprej ter izvajali na vseh namestitvah. Pogoste pomanjkljivosti, povezane z napakami v programski opremi in integriteti podatkov, so: CWE-829: Inclusion of Functionality from Untrusted Control Sphere, CWE-494: Download of Code Without Integrity Check, CWE-502: Deserialization of Untrusted Data. 14.1.11.3 Preprečevanje Edini varni arhitekturni vzorec je zavračanje serializiranih objektov iz nezaupljivih virov ali uporaba medijev za serializacijo, ki dovoljujejo uporabo zgolj enostavnih podatkovnih tipov. Če to ni izvedljivo, je smiselno upoštevati naslednja priporočila: Uporaba digitalnih podpisov ali podobnih mehanizmov pri preverjanju spremembe podatkov oz. programske opreme iz pričakovanega vira. Knjižnice in odvisnosti (npr. npm in Maven) morajo uporabljati zaupanja vredne repozitorije. Če imamo večji profil tveganja, se uporabi lastno gostovanje repozitorija, ki je dodatno preverjen. Uporaba orodij (npr. OWASP Dependency Check ali OWASP CycloneDX) za preverjanje komponent glede znanih ranljivosti. Prisotnost postopka pregleda sprememb izvorne kode in konfiguracije, s čimer se zmanjša možnost vnosq zlonamerne kode ali konfiguracije v postopek razvoja programske opreme. Cevovod CI/CD ima ustrezno ločevanje, konfiguracijo in nadzor dostopa, da je zagotovljena celovitost izvorne kode, ki teče skozi proces gradnje in postavitve. Nepodpisani in nešifrirani serializirani podatki se ne pošiljajo nezaupljivim odjemalcem brez preverjanja integritete in digitalnega podpisa za odkrivanje nedovoljenega poseganja ali neustrezne deserializacije. 14.1.11.4 Primeri scenarijev napadov 1. scenarij: Posodobitev brez podpisa. Številni domači usmerjevalniki in ostala strojna programska oprema naprav ne preverjajo posodobitev vdelane strojne programske opreme. Takšna programska oprema je lahko tarča napadalcev, kar predstavlja vedno večjo težavo. Pogosto namreč mehanizem za odpravo te težave ne obstaja, razen popravka v prihodnji različici in čakanje, da prejšnje različice zastarajo. 2. scenarij: Zlonamerna posodobitev SolarWinds. Znano je, da nekatere države napadajo mehanizme posodabljanja, kjer je eden izmed primerov napadov SolarWinds Orion. Podjetje, ki razvija programsko opremo, je imelo vzpostavljene varne procese celovitosti gradnje in posodabljanja. Kljub temu je prišlo do napada, kjer je podjetje nekaj mesecev posredovalo zlonamerne posodobitve več kot 18.000 organizacijam, kjer jih je bilo prizadetih nekaj 100 . Šlo je za eno največjih takšnih kršitev v zgodovini. 3. scenarij: Nevarna deserializacija. Aplikacija v okolju React zahteva izvajanje mikrostoritev v okolju Spring Boot. V trenutni rešitvi je implementirana serializacija stanja uporabnika in posredovanje tega podatka pri vsaki zahtevi. Napadalec opazi podpis Java objekta \\"R00\\" in uporabi orodje Java Serial Killer za izvajanje oddaljene zlonamerne kode na aplikacijskem strežniku. 14.1.12 A9:2021 - Varnostno beleženje in spremljanje napak 14.1.12.1 Opis Neustrezno beleženje in spremljanje, skupaj s pomanjkljivo ali neučinkovito integracijo z odzivom na incidente, omogoča napadalcem nadaljevanje njihovega napada, dostop do drugih sistemov, pridobivanje in celo uničenje podatkov. Večina študij dokazuje, da je povprečen čas za identifikacijo vdora več kot pol leta in da po navadi vdor zaznajo prej zunanji uporabniki kot pa notranji procesi beleženja in spremljanja. Leta 2020 je bil povprečen čas, ki ga je podjetje potrebovalo za identifikacijo vdora v sistem, kar 287 dni (na področju zdravstva kar 329 dni), medtem ko je za odpravo vdora podjetje potrebovalo v povprečju 80 dni. Kibernetski napad se zgodi vsakih 39 s. Pri kar 34 % vdorov so vpleteni notranji akterji. 48 % vseh zlonamernih prilog elektronske pošte so bile datoteke Microsoft Office. Prvi računalniški virus The Creeper je bil odkrit že leta 1971. Varnostno beleženje in spremljanje napak se je iz 10. mesta leta 2017 povzpelo na 9. mesto v letu 2021. To tveganje je lahko zelo zahtevno za testiranje in pogosto vključuje intervjuje v zvezi z odkritimi napadi med penetracijskimi testi. Za tveganje ne obstaja veliko CWE-jev, vendar je odkrivanje in odziv ključnega pomena. Faktor Vrednost Število povezanih CWE 4 Največja stopnja pojavnosti 19 , 23 % Povprečna stopnja pojavnosti 6 , 51 % Povprečna stopnja izkoriščanja 6 , 87 Povprečen učinek 4 , 99 Največja pokritost 53 , 67 % Povprečna pokritost 39 , 97 % Število pojavitev 53.615 Število CVE 242 14.1.12.2 Pogoste ranljivosti Do neustreznega beleženja, spremljanja in posledično prepoznega odziva skrbnika pride v naslednjih scenarijih: Manjka beleženje dogodkov neuspešne prijave in transakcij z visoko dodano vrednostjo. Opozorila in napake ne povzročijo ustreznih sporočil v dnevniških zapisih. Sumljivih aktivnosti v dnevniških zapisih aplikacij in API-jev se ne spremlja. Dnevniški zapisi so shranjeni zgolj lokalno. Ustrezni pragovi za opozorila in procesi stopnjevanja niso vzpostavljeni ali so neučinkoviti. Aplikacija ni sposobna zaznave, stopnjevanja ali opozarjanja v realnem času (oz. blizu realnega časa) na aktivni napad. Aplikacija je občutljiva na uhajanje informacij, če je beleženje in generiranje opozoril vidno uporabniku ali napadalcu (podrobnosti v A1:2021 - Neustrezen nadzor dostopa). Pogoste pomanjkljivosti, povezane z varnostnim beleženjem in spremljanjem napak, so: CWE-778: Insufficient Logging, CWE-117: Improper Output Neutralization for Logs, CWE-223: Omission of Security-relevant Information, CWE-532: Insertion of Sensitive Information into Log File. 14.1.12.3 Preprečevanje Odvisno od tveganja shranjenih podatkov oz. procedure so potrebni naslednji ukrepi: Zagotoviti je treba ustrezno raven beleženja vseh podatkov v zvezi s prijavami v sistem, napakami nadzora dostopa in preverjanjem vnosnih podatkov uporabnikov na strani strežnika. Z zbranimi podatki moramo biti sposobni identificirati sumljive ali zlonamerne uporabniške račune s pomočjo forenzične analize v dovolj kratkem času. Dnevniški zapisi naj bodo zapisani v obliki, ki jo je mogoče vključiti v centralizirano informacijsko rešitev za upravljanje dnevniških zapisov. Transakcije z visoko dodano vrednostjo morajo imeti na voljo revizijsko sled s kontrolami celovitosti, da preprečimo poseganje ali brisanje obstoječih dnevniških zapisov. Vzpostavljeno je učinkovito spremljanje in generiranje opozoril, tako da so zlonamerne dejavnosti hitro odkrite in se na njih odzovemo pravočasno. Testiranje učinkovitosti varovanja računalniškega sistema s simulacijo napadov in pregledi z orodji za dinamično testiranje aplikacij (npr. OWASP ZAP (The OWASP Foundation 2018c)). Opredeliti je treba načrt za odziv ob vdoru v sistem in načrt za obnovitev sistema, kot je npr. NIST 800-61 r2. Na trgu obstajajo številna komercialna in odprtokodna ogrodja: za zaščito aplikacij, kot je npr. OWASP AppSensor (The OWASP Foundation 2018a), požarni zid za spletne aplikacije, kot je npr. OWASP ModSecurity (The OWASP Foundation 2018b), programska oprema za iskanje korelacij v dnevniških zapisih (npr. Elasticsearch, Logstash, Kibana) idr. Več o preprečevanju napada z neustreznim beleženjem in spremljanje lahko najdete v kratkih zapiskih OWASP: beleženje. 14.1.12.4 Primeri scenarijev napadov 1. scenarij: Upravljalec spletne strani ponudnika zdravstvenih zavarovanj za otroke ni zaznal kršitev zaradi pomanjkanja spremljanja in beleženja. Zunanja oseba je ponudnika zdravstvenih zavarovanj obvestila, da je napadalec dostopal in spremenil nekaj tisoč občutljivih zdravstvenih zapisov več kot 40.000 otrok. Pregled po incidentu je ugotovil, da razvijalci spletnega mesta niso odpravili obstoječih varnostnih pomanjkljivosti. Ker beleženja in spremljanja sistema ni bilo prisotnega, je takšna kršitev potekala že več let. 2. scenarij: Večja indijska letalska družba je doživela vdor s krajo podatkov, ki je vključeval več kot desetletne osebne podatke milijona potnikov, vključno s podatki o potnih listih in kreditnih karticah. Do vdora je prišlo na gostovanju v oblaku pri enem od poslovnih partnerjev, ki je šele čez nekaj časa obvestil letalsko družbo. 3. scenarij: Večja evropska trgovska veriga je utrpela kršitev GDPR. Napadalec je izkoristil pomanjkljivost in pridobil več kot 400.000 zapisov o plačilih strank. Regulator je trgovsko verigo kaznoval z 20 milijoni evrov. 14.1.13 A10:2021 - Ponarejanje zahtev na strani strežnika (SSRF) 14.1.13.1 Opis Ponarejanje zahtev na strani strežnika (angl. server-side request forgery (SSRF)) je v letu 2021 dodano na seznam največjih tveganj, kot prvo priporočila s strani skupnosti varnostnih strokovnjakov. Podatki kažejo razmeroma nizko stopnjo pojavnosti z nadpovprečno pokritostjo in učinkom. Faktor Vrednost Število povezanih CWE 1 Največja stopnja pojavnosti 2 , 72 % Povprečna stopnja pojavnosti 2 , 72 % Povprečna stopnja izkoriščanja 8 , 28 Povprečen učinek 6 , 72 Največja pokritost 67 , 72 % Povprečna pokritost 67 , 72 % Število pojavitev 9.503 Število CVE 385 14.1.13.2 Pogoste ranljivosti Napake SSRF se pojavijo vedno, ko spletna aplikacija pridobi oddaljeni vir brez preverjanja veljavnosti naslova URL, ki ga je posredoval uporabnik. Napadalcu omogoča, da prisili aplikacijo k pošiljanju zahteve na nepričakovani ciljni naslov, tudi če je le-ta zaščiten s požarnim zidom, VPN ali kakšno drugo vrsto seznama za nadzor dostopa do omrežja. Ker sodobne spletne aplikacije uporabnikom omogočajo priročne funkcije, postane pridobivanje podatkov iz naslova URL običajen primer uporabe. Posledično se zaradi storitev v oblaku in zapletenosti arhitektur povečujeta tudi pojavnost in resnost SSRF. Pogosta pomanjkljivost CWE, povezana s ponarejanjem zahtev na strani strežnika, je: CWE-918: Server-Side Request Forgery (SSRF). 14.1.13.3 Preprečevanje Razvijalci lahko preprečijo SSRF z izvajanjem naslednjih obrambnih postopkov: na omrežni ravni, za zmanjšanje vpliva SSRF se funkcionalnost oddaljenega dostopa do virov porazdeli v ločenih omrežjih, uveljavitev privzetega zavračanja na požarnem zidu ali pravila za nadzor dostopa do omrežja, kjer je blokiran ves promet, razen nujno potrebnega, namigi: vzpostavitev lastništva in življenjskega cikla pravil požarnega zidu na podlagi aplikacij, beleženje vseh potrjenih in zavrnjenih omrežnih zahtev na požarnem zidu (glej A9-2021 - Varnostno beleženje in spremljanje napak), na aplikacijski ravni, preverjanje vseh vhodnih podatkov, ki jih posreduje uporabnik, uveljavitev sheme URL, vrat in ciljnih lokacij s seznamom dovoljenih lokacij, uporabnikom ne posredujemo neobdelanih odgovorov, onemogočite preusmeritve HTTP, težav SSRF ne rešujte s seznamom zavrnitev ali regularnimi izrazi - napadalci lahko takšen seznam pridobijo in izvedejo obhod, dodatni postopki, ne uporabljajte ostalih varnostno pomembnih storitev na čelnih sistemih (npr. OpenID) in nadzirajte lokalni promet na teh sistemih (npr. localhost), pri visokih varnostnih zahtevah uporabite šifriranje omrežja (npr. VPN) za čelne sisteme z namenskimi skupinami uporabnikov. 14.1.13.4 Primeri scenarijev napadov Napadalci lahko uporabijo SSRF za napad na sisteme, zaščitene s požarnimi zidovi, in sicer: 1. scenarij: Pregledovanje vrat strežnikov v lokalnem omrežju. Če omrežna arhitektura ni porazdeljena, lahko napadalci preiščejo strukturo lokalnega notranjega omrežja in ugotovijo, katera vrata na notranjih strežnikih so odprta. 2. scenarij: Izpostavljenost občutljivih podatkov. Napadalec lahko dostopa do lokalnih datotek preko lokalnih storitev, kot je npr. file:///etc/passwd ali http://localhost:28017/. 3. scenarij: Dostop do shrambe metapodatkov storitev v oblaku. Večina ponudnikov storitev v oblaku ima shrambo metapodatkov, kot je npr. http://169.254.169.254/. Napadalec lahko metapodatke prebere in pridobi občutljive informacije. 4. scenarij: Ogrožanje internih storitev. Napadalec lahko zlorabi interne storitve za izvajanje nadaljnjih napadov, kot je npr. oddaljeno izvajanje kode RCE ali zavrnitev storitev DoS. 14.1.14 Priporočila za razvijalce Če ste na področju varnosti spletnih aplikacij še začetnik ali ste z varnostjo že zelo dobro seznanjeni, je objava varne spletne aplikacije zelo naporno opravilo. V nadaljevanju je prikazanih nekaj priporočil s strani OWASP, ki jih lahko razvijalci uporabijo pri razvoju varnih spletnih aplikacij in API-jev. 14.1.14.1 Zahteve varnih spletnih aplikacij Za razvoj varne spletne aplikacije je treba opredeliti, kaj pomeni varno v kontekstu aplikacije. OWASP priporoča uporabo standarda za preverjanje varnosti aplikacij ASVS kot vodnik pri nastavitvah varnostnih zahtev vaše aplikacije. Če nastopate v vlogi zunanjega izvajalca, se priporoča uporaba pogodbe o razvoju varne programske opreme (angl. secure software contract annex). 14.1.14.2 Arhitektura varnih spletnih aplikacij Namesto da po končanem razvoju informacijske rešitve poskrbimo za varnost, je veliko bolj učinkovita skrb za varnost od samega začetka razvoja. OWASP priporoča uporabo izhodišč za načrtovanje varnosti aplikacije od začetka razvoja, ki jih najdemo v kratkih zapiskih OWASP. 14.1.14.3 Standardni varnostni nadzor Oblikovanje učinkovitega varnostnega nadzora je zagotovo zahtevno opravilo. Z uporabo gradnikov za standardni varnostni nadzor si lahko močno poenostavimo razvoj varnih aplikacij in API-jev. OWASP priporoča uporabo smernic iz proaktivnega nadzora; številna novejša aplikacijska ogrodja pa že v osnovi podpirajo standardni in učinkovit varnostni nadzor za avtorizacijo, validacijo, preprečevanje CSRF ipd. 14.1.14.4 Varni življenjski cikel razvoja programske opreme Za izboljšanje procesa razvoja, ki je v uporabi pri razvoju aplikacij in API-jev, OWASP priporoča uporabo zrelostnega modela za zagotavljanje kakovosti programske opreme (angl. software assurance maturity model (SAMM)). Predlagan model pomaga pri oblikovanju in izvajanju strategije varnosti programske opreme, saj je prilagojen posameznim tveganjem, s katerimi se sooča organizacija. 14.2 Osnovni varnostni pregled Demo aplikacije z OWASP ZAP 14.2.1 Priprava Demo aplikacije v lokalnem okolju Z orodjem OWASP ZAP bomo preverili osnovno varnost naše aplikacije, ki jo poženemo na lokalnem računalniku in je na voljo na http://localhost:3000. Pred začetkom testiranja poskrbimo, da uporabljamo lokalno podatkovno bazo in lokalni strežnik, saj lahko v nasprotnem primeru porabimo vire, ki so nam na voljo v okviru brezplačnega gostovanja na Heroku in MongoDB Atlas. Smiselno je izdelati tudi varnostno kopijo podatkovne baze (za to že imamo pripravljene skripte), saj bo pri aktivnem testiranju napolnjena s številnimi testnimi vrednostmi. Pred testiranjem poskrbimo še za brisanje morebitnih starih podatkov in dodajanje novih testnih podatkov. Podatke za uvoz lokacij in komentarjev že imamo na voljo, dodatno pa poskrbimo še za uporabnike. Pripravimo novo datoteko testni-uporabniki.json s testnim uporabnikom dejan@lavbic.net in geslom test. data/testni-uporabniki.json [ { \\"name\\": \\"Dejan Lavbič\\", \\"email\\": \\"dejan@lavbic.net\\", \\"salt\\": \\"9981a3df943d041cf3e9d69332e3c87a\\", \\"hash\\": \\"177251e9308fdddfc52298964b2b0ad504351c9fd0090b81ca00bee3348ab23c84055f19126a1497a7f5eaf1e6d6780925a7824bc1c534d44f942a287211cf2c\\" } ] Nato dopolnimo še skripte za pomoč pri uvozu podatkov uporabnikov. package.json { ... \\"scripts\\": { \\"start\\": \\"node server.js\\", \\"import:db-docker\\": \\"docker cp ./data/kulturne-dediscine.json sp-mongo-db:/kulturne-dediscine.json; docker cp ./data/testni-uporabniki.json sp-mongo-db:/testni-uporabniki.json; docker exec -it sp-mongo-db mongoimport --db Demo --collection Locations --mode upsert --upsertFields id --jsonArray --file kulturne-dediscine.json; docker exec -it sp-mongo-db mongoimport --db Demo --collection Users --mode upsert --upsertFields email --jsonArray --file testni-uporabniki.json; docker exec -it sp-mongo-db rm -rf kulturne-dediscine.json; docker exec -it sp-mongo-db rm -rf testni-uporabniki.json\\", \\"delete:db-docker\\": \\"docker exec -it sp-mongo-db bash -c \\"mongosh Demo --eval 'db.Locations.deleteMany({})'; mongosh Demo --eval 'db.Users.deleteMany({})'\\"\\", \\"view:db-docker\\": \\"docker exec -it sp-mongo-db bash -c \\"mongosh Demo --eval 'db.Locations.find()'; mongosh Demo --eval 'db.Users.find()'\\"\\", \\"transfer:db-docker-atlas\\": \\"docker exec -it sp-mongo-db bash -c \\"mongodump -h localhost -d Demo -o ./\\"; docker exec -it sp-mongo-db bash -c \\"mongorestore --drop --uri mongodb+srv://app@demo.548y4py.mongodb.net ./Demo/Locations.bson\\"; docker exec -it sp-mongo-db bash -c \\"mongorestore --drop --uri mongodb+srv://app@demo.548y4py.mongodb.net ./Demo/Users.bson\\"; docker exec -it sp-mongo-db bash -c \\"rm -rf ./Demo\\"\\", }, ... } 14.2.2 Podpora SSL Pri razvoju spletnih aplikacij je ena izmed ključnih zahtev gostovanje aplikacije preko varnega protokola HTTPS, ki predstavlja razširitev protokola HTTP, saj ga pogosto imenujemo HTTP over TLS oz. HTTP over SSL. Na takšen način je med strežnikom, ki gosti aplikacijo in odjemalcem, ki do nje dostopa, vzpostavljen varen kanal, ki uporabnike ščiti predvsem pred napadom s posrednikom (angl. man-in-the-middle attack). Če boste gostovali svoje lastne rešitve, potem lahko enostavno in predvsem brezplačno uporabite storitev Let’s Encrypt, ki omogoča uporabo brezplačnega SSL certifikata za poljubno spletno domeno, kjer boste gostovali svojo aplikacijo. Večina ponudnikov spletnega gostovanja aplikacija omenjeno podporo že omogoča brezplačno. V našem primeru lokalnega razvoja pa bomo s pomočjo knjižnice OpenSSL generirali lasten certifikat, ki ga bomo sami izdali in podpisali. Zaradi tega nas bo brskalnik sicer opozoril, da naša povezava ni varna, ker ne uporabljamo zaupanja vreden certifikat, vendar bo to za naše potrebe dovolj. Kreirali bomo novo mapo cert, kjer bomo hranili privatni ključ server.key in certifikat server.cert. Pri procesu kreiranju vnesemo tudi zahtevana podatke certifikata. mkdir cert cd cert openssl req -nodes -new -x509 -keyout server.key -out server.cert Generating a 2048 bit RSA private key ...................................................................................................................................................................+++++ ....................+++++ writing new private key to 'server.key' ----- You are about to be asked to enter information that will be incorporated into your certificate request.

HTTPS strežnik. server.js /** * Start server */ if (process.env.HTTPS == \\"true\\") { const fs = require(\\"fs\\"); const https = require(\\"https\\"); https .createServer( { key: fs.readFileSync(\\"cert/server.key\\"), cert: fs.readFileSync(\\"cert/server.cert\\"), }, app ) .listen(port, () => { console.log( \`Secure demo app started in '{ process.env.NODE_ENV || \\"development\\" } mode' listening on port {port}!\` ); }); } else { app.listen(port, () => { console.log( \`Demo app started in '{ process.env.NODE_ENV || \\"development\\" } mode' listening on port {port}!\` ); }); } Skladno s spremembo moramo dopolniti tudi okoljske spremenljivke aplikacije Angular. angular/src/environments/environment.ts export const environment = { apiUrl: \\"https://localhost:3000/api\\", production: false, allowedChainId: 1337, contractUrl: \\"https://localhost:3000/ABI/SimpleVoting.json\\", contractAddress: \\"0xD76d2DF6994C2e515F8e2279CBd4309C144EC395\\", }; Prav tako dodamo HTTPS REST API strežnik za testiranje dostopne točke. server.js const swaggerDocument = swaggerJsDoc({ definition: { ... servers: [ { url: \\"https://localhost:3000/api\\", description: \\"Secure development server for testing\\", }, { url: \\"http://localhost:3000/api\\", description: \\"Development server for testing\\", }, { url: \\"https://sp-2023-2024.fly.dev/api\\", description: \\"Production server\\", }, ], ... }, ... }); 14.2.3 Zagon aplikacije Pred začetkom testiranja poskrbimo, da je pognana MongoDB podatkovna baza in nato poženemo verigo blokov Ganache. 1. terminal npm run ganache ... Sledi postavitev pametno pogodbo SimpleVoting na verigo blokov, prevedemo Angular aplikacijo v razvojnem okolju, kjer uporabljamo lokalno podatkovno bazo. Prav tako izbrišemo vse obstoječe podatke in podatkovno bazo napolnimo z novimi začetnimi podatki. 2. terminal cd dapp truffle migrate ... cd .. cd angular ng build --output-path build --configuration development ... cd .. npm run delete:db-docker ... npm run import:db-docker ... npm run start > demo@0.1.0 start > node server.js Secure demo app started in 'development mode' listening on port 3000! Mongoose connected to mongodb://127.0.0.1/Demo. 14.2.4 Konfiguracija orodja OWASP ZAP Najprej nastavimo kontekst varnostnega preverjanja tako, da z dvojnim klikom v seznamu na levi strani izberemo Contexts → Default Context. Med nastavitvami izberemo Session → Contexts → 1: Default Context. V okviru nastavitev bomo varnostnemu pregledu bolj podrobno opredelili na kakšni tehnologiji temelji naša spletna aplikacija. Pri 1: Technology izberemo: DB → MongoDB, Language → JavaScript, OS → Linux, MacOS in Windows, SCM → GIT. Glede na to, da imamo na voljo dokumentiran REST API vmesnik, bomo uvozili tudi to OpenAPI specifikacijo, tako da v meniju izberemo Import → Import an OpenAPI definition from a URL in nastavimo URL Pointing to OpenAPI defn na spletni naslov Swagger datoteke, ki jo generira naša aplikacija https://localhost:3000/api/swagger.json ter potrdimo s klikom na gumb Import. Na seznamu strani v okviru Sites se pojavijo vse metode naše dostopne točke, kjer ohranimo zgolj lokacijo https://localhost:3000, medtem ko gostovanje v oblaku na https://web-dev.fly.dev odstranimo. Nato uvozimo nekaj spletnih naslovov aplikacije, ki jih bo lahko orodje ZAP uporabilo pri varnostnem pregledu, in sicer v meniju izberemo Import → Import a File Containing URLs. data/url.txt https://localhost:3000/ https://localhost:3000/login https://localhost:3000/register https://localhost:3000/about https://localhost:3000/locations/64f95f7a8229d6428762c547 https://localhost:3000/locations/64f95f7a8229d6428762c678 https://localhost:3000/locations/64f95f7a8229d6428762c5c0 https://localhost:3000/vote Vse spletne naslove, ki niso na našem naslovnem prostoru https://localhost:3000/ izločimo tako, da jih označimo in izberemo iz menija Exclude from → Proxy ter potrdimo s klikom na gumb Exclude. Lahko pa na ravni celotne OWASP ZAP seje opredelimo, da se naj testiranje izvede zgolj na naslovu localhost:3000. Omenjeno nastavitev zahtevamo z dvojnim klikom v seznamu na levi strani Contexts → Default Context in nato Session. Pri vsaki izmed nastavitev Exclude from Proxy, Exclude from Scanner in Exclude from Spider dodamo regularni izraz, kjer zahtevamo omenjeno omejitev delovanja zgolj na lokalno okolje. Rezultat uvoza OpenAPI specifikacije REST API strežnika in ročno dodanih spletnih naslovov je prikazan na sliki 14.1. V nadaljevanju bomo s pomočjo funkcionalnosti Manual Explore (glej sliko 14.1) demonstrirali uporabo naše aplikacije, da orodju OWASP ZAP še dodatno olajšamo analizo. Začetni čarovnik za varnostno analizo aplikacije v orodju OWASP ZAP Slika 14.1: Začetni čarovnik za varnostno analizo aplikacije v orodju OWASP ZAP Pri ročnem preiskovanju aplikacije je priporočljiv vklop funkcionalnosti HUD (angl. Heads Up Display), ki nam sproti prikazuje pomanjkljivosti aplikacije, ko se sprehajamo po posameznih delih. Kot je prikazano na sliki 14.2, lahko izvajamo usmerjene napade, ves čas pa imamo na voljo statistiko o težavah na obstoječi strani (orodna vrstica na levi strani strani) in na celotnem spletnem mestu (orodna vrstica na desni strani strani). Funkcionalnost HUD v orodju OWASP ZAP Slika 14.2: Funkcionalnost HUD v orodju OWASP ZAP Ko končamo z ročno demonstracijo uporabe naše spletne aplikacije, lahko dodatno poženemo še naslednje teste: Spider, ki se sprehodi po začetnih spletnih naslovih in poišče še morebitne preostale, Ajax Spider ima podobno funkcionalnost kot Spider s to razliko, da zna slediti tudi povezavam, ki so dinamično opredeljene z jezikom JavaScript (npr. SPA aplikacija) in Active Scan, ki na podlagi znanih pomanjkljivosti izvede aktivne napade. Ko se varnostna analiza aplikacije izvede (lahko traja nekaj minut), se izkaže, da so v naši aplikaciji prisotna tveganja, predstavljena v nadaljevanju. 14.2.5 Odprava težav s HTTP odgovori Najbolj enostavno lahko na začetku odpravimo identificirana nizka in srednja tveganja, povezana s pomanjkanjem določenih podatkov v glavi HTTP odgovora, in sicer: Server Leaks Information via “X-Powered-By” HTTP Response Header Field(s), X-Frame-Options Headers Not Set, Cross Site Scripting Weakness in X-Content-Type-Options Header Missing. Spremembe je treba dodati v datoteko app.js, kjer je implementirana Express aplikacija, in sicer na začetku vzpostavitve strežnika, kot prikazuje naslednji izsek kode. app.js /** * Odprava varnostnih pomanjkljivosti */ app.disable(\\"x-powered-by\\"); app.use((req, res, next) => { res.header(\\"X-Frame-Options\\", \\"DENY\\"); res.setHeader(\\"X-XSS-Protection\\", \\"1; mode=block\\"); res.setHeader(\\"X-Content-Type-Options\\", \\"nosniff\\"); next(); }); 14.2.6 Odprava težav z registracijo in prijavo Pri registraciji in prijavi ne preverjamo pravilnosti elektronskega naslova, zato v tem primeru dodamo regularni izraz, ki poskrbi za ustrezno obliko vnesenega podatka elektronskega naslova. api/controllers/authentication.js const register = async (req, res) => { if (!req.body.name || !req.body.email || !req.body.password) return res.status(400).json({ message: \\"All fields required.\\" }); else if (!(/(?:[a-z0-9!#%&'*+/=?^_\`{|}~-]+(?:.[a-z0-9!#%&'*+/=?^_\`{|}~-]+)*|\\"(?:[x01-x08x0bx0cx0e-x1fx21x23-x5bx5d-x7f]|[x01-x09x0bx0cx0e-x7f])*\\")@(?:(?:[a-z0-9](?:[a-z0-9-]*[a-z0-9])?.)+[a-z0-9](?:[a-z0-9-]*[a-z0-9])?|[(?:(?:(2(5[0-5]|[0-4][0-9])|1[0-9][0-9]|[1-9]?[0-9])).){3}(?:(2(5[0-5]|[0-4][0-9])|1[0-9][0-9]|[1-9]?[0-9])|[a-z0-9-]*[a-z0-9]:(?:[x01-x08x0bx0cx0e-x1fx21-x5ax53-x7f]|[x01-x09x0bx0cx0e-x7f])+)])/.test(req.body.email))) return res.status(400).json({\\"sporočilo\\": \\"E-mail is not valid!\\"}); const user = new User(); user.name = req.body.name; user.email = req.body.email; user.setPassword(req.body.password); try { await user.save(); res.status(200).json({ token: user.generateJwt() }); } catch (err) { if (err.code === 11000) res.status(409).json({ message: \\"User with given e-mail address already registered.\\", }); else res.status(500).json({ message: err.message }); } }; api/controllers/avtentikacija.js const login = (req, res) => { if (!req.body.email || !req.body.password) return res.status(400).json({ message: \\"All fields required.\\" }); else if (!(/(?:[a-z0-9!#%&'*+/=?^_\`{|}~-]+(?:.[a-z0-9!#%&'*+/=?^_\`{|}~-]+)*|\\"(?:[x01-x08x0bx0cx0e-x1fx21x23-x5bx5d-x7f]|[x01-x09x0bx0cx0e-x7f])*\\")@(?:(?:[a-z0-9](?:[a-z0-9-]*[a-z0-9])?.)+[a-z0-9](?:[a-z0-9-]*[a-z0-9])?|[(?:(?:(2(5[0-5]|[0-4][0-9])|1[0-9][0-9]|[1-9]?[0-9])).){3}(?:(2(5[0-5]|[0-4][0-9])|1[0-9][0-9]|[1-9]?[0-9])|[a-z0-9-]*[a-z0-9]:(?:[x01-x08x0bx0cx0e-x1fx21-x5ax53-x7f]|[x01-x09x0bx0cx0e-x7f])+)])/.test(req.body.email))) return res.status(400).json({\\"sporočilo\\": \\"E-mail is not valid!\\"}); else passport.authenticate(\\"local\\", (err, user, info) => { if (err) return res.status(500).json({ message: err.message }); if (user) return res.status(200).json({ token: user.generateJwt() }); else return res.status(401).json({ message: info.message }); })(req, res); }; 14.3 Osnovni funkcionalni testi aplikacije Demo s Selenium Poleg varnostnih pregledov aplikacij so zelo pomembni tudi funkcionalni testi spletnih aplikacij. Mogoče na prvi pogled avtomatizacija testiranja uporabniškega vmesnika deluje kot zelo zahtevno opravilo, vendar imamo na voljo določena orodja, ki nam to olajšajo. Eno takšnih orodij je tudi ogrodje Selenium, ki avtomatizira delovanje spletnega brskalnika. Omogoča nam izvajanje vnaprej pripravljenih avtomatiziranih testov spletnih aplikacij, pri tem pa podpira množico različnih spletnih brskalnikov in programskih jezikov, v katerih lahko zapišemo in poganjamo teste. S popolno avtomatizacijo testiranja aplikacij se pri tem predmetu ne bomo ukvarjali, če vas že na tem mestu zanimajo podrobnosti, si lahko preberete pregleden članek Setting up your own test automation environment, ki predstavi način avtomatiziranega testiranja spletnih aplikacij v produkcijskem okolju v okviru CI/CD podpornih aktivnosti. Za poganjanje Selenium avtomatizacije se priporoča uporaba ločenega okolja (glej sliko 14.3), kjer je nameščen Selenium strežnik, in sicer kar v obliki Docker vsebnika. Za testiranje in izvajanje testov se zelo dobro izkaže selenium/standalone-chrome-debug, ki ga namestite z naslednjim ukazom (na sistemu moramo imeti nameščeno okolje Docker): docker run -d -p 4445:4444 -p 5901:5900 --shm-size=2g selenium/standalone-chrome-debug Če uporabljate ARM arhitekturo (npr. Apple M1 oz. M2), potem lahko uporabite naslednji Docker vsebnik: docker run -d -p 4445:4444 -p 5901:5900 --shm-size 2g --name selenium-chrome-debug seleniarm/standalone-chromium:4.0.0-beta-1-20210215 Prednost omenjenega Docker vsebnika je v samostojnem Selenium strežniku, do katerega imamo tudi VNC dostop, kjer lahko sproti spremljamo izvajanje testa. Arhitektura testnega sistema Slika 14.3: Arhitektura testnega sistema Opomba: Alternativa uporabe Docker vsebnika je namestitev Selenium strežnika in je na voljo v obliki datoteke JAR, ki jo preprosto poženete v samostojnem (angl. standalone) načinu z ukazom java -jar selenium-server-<verzija>.jar standalone --port 4445. Prav tako mora biti v isti mapi, kjer poganjate Selenium strežnik, na voljo tudi ChromeDriver. Alternative: Poleg Seleniuma imamo na voljo tudi druge pogosto uporabljene alternative za testiranje programske opreme, in sicer Puppeteer, Cypress idr. Selenium teste lahko zapišemo v poljubnem programskem jeziku (npr. C#, Java, JavaScript, R, Python ipd.). V nadaljevanju bo predstavljen primer funkcionalnega testa aplikacije Demo v programskem jeziku JavaScript z uporabo testov v ogrodjih Mocha in Chai. Najprej bomo poskrbeli za namestitev vseh potrebnih Node.js knjižnic. npm install selenium-webdriver chromedriver mocha mochawesome chai --save-dev Nato kreiramo novo mapo test, kamor bomo shranili naš funkcionalni test Demo.test.js. Teste bomo razvili s pomočjo ogrodij Selenium, Mocha in Chai. Najprej v okviru spremenljivke seleniumServerUrl opredelimo naslov, kjer je na voljo Selenium strežnik, kamor se bo naš izvajalec testov povezal. Nato s pomočjo ogrodja Mocha opredelimo funkcionalne teste, ki jih združimo v strukturo describe → context → it, kjer je it najmanjša enota funkcionalnosti, ki jo testiramo. V našem primeru imamo opredeljene naslednje teste: Location list number of locations on the home page About application select about application accuracy of data on the about aplication page page title page text Location details select Ljubljana - Viško pokopališče accuray of data on the location details page location title location properties location sidebar Register new user delete user from database user login select register user data entry check if user user is logged in get JWT token Add comment delete user’s comments from the database select Ljubljana - Viško pokopališče check if Ljubljana - Viško pokopališče page is displayed click the button to add a comment check if the comment has been added delete user’s comment User logout check if the user is logged in request logout check if the user is logged out Pričakovane vrednosti nato preverjamo s pomočjo knjižnice Chai, kjer uporabimo rezervirano besedo expect v povezavi s primerjalnim operatorjem (npr. to.be.an, to.have.lengthOf, to.not.be.empty, to.have.string itd.). test/Demo.test.js /** * Functional tests */ (async function Demo() { /** * Libraries */ const { execSync } = require(\\"child_process\\");

Progressive Web App (PWA)) je posebna vrsta spletne aplikacije, ki je zasnovana tako, da je: sposobna (angl. capable), Že trenutne aplikacije na svetovnem spletu so zelo sposobne, saj lahko npr. zgradite napredno aplikacijo za video klepet s pomočjo obvestil WebRTC, uporabo geolokacije in potisnimi sporočili. Takšno aplikacijo je mogoče namestiti in jo dodatno podpreti s tehnologijami WebGL in WebVR. Z vpeljavo Web Assembly lahko razvijalci prenesejo številno obstoječo programsko opremo na splet. zanesljiva (angl. reliable) in Hitrost je ključnega pomena pri uporabniški izkušnji. Ko se čas nalaganja strani poveča iz 1 s na 10 s , se verjetnost izgube stranke poveča za 123 % . Zanesljive aplikacije morajo biti uporabne ne glede na status povezave. jo je mogoče namestiti (angl. installable), Nameščene progresivne aplikacije se izvajajo v samostojnem oknu in ne zgolj v zavihku brskalnika. Takšne aplikacije lahko tudi sprejemajo vsebino iz drugih aplikacij ali postanejo privzete za odpiranje določenih datotek. V osnovi so progresivne aplikacije zgolj spletne aplikacije. Z vpeljavo postopnih izboljšav pa jim v sodobnih spletnih brskalnikih omogočimo nove sposobnosti. Kot prikazuje slika 14.5 gre za nadgradnjo spletne aplikacije, ki po sposobnostih dosega domorodno aplikacijo (npr. namizno aplikacijo za določen operacijski sistem.) Primerjava PWA z domorodnimi in spletnimi aplikacijami Slika 14.5: Primerjava PWA z domorodnimi in spletnimi aplikacijami Zanimivost: Podjetja, ki so uvedla progresivne spletne aplikacije, v večini izboljšajo svojo uspešnost. Pri Twitterju se je za 65 % povečalo število strani na sejo in uporabniki so kreirali 75 % več sporočil, medtem ko so razvijalci uspeli zmanjšati velikost aplikacije za 97 % . S progresivnimi spletnimi aplikacijami so povezane številne funkcionalnosti, ki jih lahko razdelimo v naslednji kategoriji: Osnovne lastnosti progresivnih aplikacij: Hiter zagon in delovanje sta ključna pri vsaki spletni uporabniški izkušnji, saj so spletna mesta z visoko zmogljivostjo bolj privlačna in bolje zadržijo uporabnike, kot manj zmogljiva. Delovanje v vseh brskalnikih, saj imajo uporabniki izbran poljuben brskalnik za dostop do spleta, še preden namestijo vašo aplikacijo. Odzivnost na poljubno velikost zaslona, saj lahko uporabniki PWA aplikacijo uporabljajo na poljubni velikosti zaslona, vsa vsebina pa je na voljo v poljubni velikosti prikaza. Na voljo je stran po meri brez povezave, kjer imajo uporabniki boljšo izkušnjo, če ob izgubi povezave ostanejo znotraj vaše PWA, kot pa da so preusmerjeni na privzeto stran brez povezave na ravni brskalnika. Možna je namestitev aplikacije, saj uporabniki, ki lahko aplikacijo namestijo ali dodajo v svojo napravo, samo aplikacijo tudi bolj uporabljajo. Napredne lastnosti progresivnih aplikacij: Zagotavlja izkušnjo brez povezave pri tistih funkcionalnostih, kjer povezljivost ni potrebna in aplikacija deluje enako kot s povezavo v splet. Popolna dostopnost, kjer so vse uporabniške interakcije skladne z WCAG 2.0. Enostavno jo je odkriti z iskanjem, kjer se osredotočimo predvsem na dostopnost s strani spletnih pajkov večjih spletnih iskalnikov. Ključno je, da ima vsak URL naslov enoličen naslov in meta oznako. Deluje s poljubno vrsto vnosa, kjer je na voljo uporabniška izkušnja z miško, tipkovnico, pisalom ali dotikom. Zagotavlja kontekst pri varnostnih zahtevah, kjer pri zahtevi dovoljenja za uporabo zmogljivih funkcionalnosti uporabniku opredelite kontekst in jih zahtevajte le takrat, ko je to potrebno. Progresivne spletne aplikacije izkoriščajo zmogljivosti sodobnih spletnih tehnologij in ponujajo nabor najboljših praks in sodobnih spletnih API-jev. Kot prikazuje slika 14.6 lahko z uporabo Service worker-ja obstoječo stran z uporabo predpomnjenja virov in napovedovanja nalaganja pohitrimo in naredimo bolj zanesljivo. Če poleg tega omogočimo še namestitev na napravo, lahko uporabniki enostavno dostopajo do aplikacije kar neposredno iz domačega zaslona. Za obveščanje uporabnikov in ponovno vključitev v aplikacijo pa lahko izkoristimo tehnologijo spletnih potisnih obvestil. Povzetek PWA funkcionalnosti Slika 14.6: Povzetek PWA funkcionalnosti V nadaljevanju si bomo pogledali, kako obstoječo aplikacijo postopoma pretvorimo v progresivno in si pri tem pomagamo z obstoječimi orodji za analizo spletnih aplikacij. 14.4.2 Pregled obstoječe aplikacije s pomočjo Lighthouse Lighthouse je odprtokodno orodje za revizijo spletnih aplikacij, ki so ga razvili pri Googlu in se lahko uporablja za pregled spletnih mest in aplikacij z vidika učinkovitosti, dostopnosti, SEO, najboljših praks in podpore PWA. Zaradi lažjega testiranja bomo zopet sprememnili naslov iz host.docker.internal v localhost. angular/src/environments/environment.ts export const environment = { apiUrl: \\"https://localhost:3000/api\\", apiUrl: \\"https://host.docker.internal:3000/api\\", production: false, }; Spremembo moramo tudi uveljaviti, zato ponovno zahtevamo prevajanje Angular aplikacije. cd angular ng build --output-path build --configuration development ... cd .. npm start Do orodja Lighthouse lahko najlažje dostopate v spletnem brskalniku Google Chrome, in sicer odprete JavaScript konzolo, kjer je funkcionalnost na voljo v zavihku Lighthouse. Pri izvedbi revizije spletne aplikacije lahko izbiramo med različnimi kategorijami (zmogljivost (angl. performance), PWA, najboljše prakse (angl. best practices), dostopnost (angl. accessibility) in SEO), napravami (mobilna naprava (anlg. mobile) ali namizni računalnik (angl. desktop)) in načinom delovanja (navigacija (angl. navigation), časovno obdobje (angl. timespan) oz. posnetek (angl. snapshot)), kot je prikazano na sliki 14.7. Začetne nastavitve v Lighthouse Slika 14.7: Začetne nastavitve v Lighthouse Za začetek bomo izvedli revizijo nad vsemi kategorijami za namizni računalnik. Ko se analiza izvede, najprej dobimo povzetek rezultatov, ki je prikazan na sliki 14.8. Povzetek rezultatov analize Slika 14.8: Povzetek rezultatov analize Opazimo, da ima naša aplikacija kar nekaj težav pri zmogljivosti (angl. performance) ter SEO, medtem ko PWA pri našem dosedanjem razvoju sploh nismo naslovili. Za vsako izmed kategorij si lahko pogledamo podrobnosti, kjer so najbolj koristna priporočila za izboljšanje delovanja naše aplikacije. Pri analizi zmogljivosti (angl. performance) na sliki 14.9 med metrikami vidimo podrobnosti o posamezni izboljšavi, vključno s potencialnim doprinosom v času nalaganja. Za vsako priporočilo imamo na voljo tudi podrobnosti, kako jo implementirati. Največ težav je povezanih z neoptimizirano uporabo knjižnic (npr. Angular ipd.). Rezultati analize zmogljivosti Slika 14.9: Rezultati analize zmogljivosti Naslednja kategorija je dostopnost (angl. accessibility), kjer so podrobnosti prikazane na sliki 14.10. Opazimo lahko manjše pomanjkljivosti v zvezi s kontrastom in uporabo velikosti naslovov. Rezultati analize dostopnosti Slika 14.10: Rezultati analize dostopnosti V okviru kategorije uporabe dobrih praks (angl. best practices) so podrobnosti na voljo na sliki 14.11, kjer smo dosegli vse možne točke. Rezultati analize uporabe dobrih praks Slika 14.11: Rezultati analize uporabe dobrih praks Z vidikom optimizacije spletne strani SEO za prikaz med rezultati spletnega iskanja se pri našem razvoju sploh nismo ukvarjali, zato smo tudi dosegli nižjo oceno. Imamo pa sedaj na sliki 14.12 zbrana vsa priporočila, ki bi jih bilo smiselno upoštevati. Rezultati analize SEO Slika 14.12: Rezultati analize SEO Na tem mestu je za nas najbolj koristno poročilo PWA, ki je na voljo na sliki 14.13. Opazimo lahko, da naša aplikacija ni skladna z zahtevami progresivnih aplikacij, zato jih bomo v nadaljevanju postopoma dodali.

V nadaljevanju bomo postopoma nadgradili ogrodje PWA aplikacije, ki smo ga dodali obstoječi SPA aplikaciji. Ključna funkcionalnost, ki jo želimo nasloviti, je delovanje aplikacije v stanju brez povezave, kjer bomo poskrbeli za čim boljšo uporabniško izkušnjo. 14.4.4.1 Testiranje PWA aplikacij Pri testiranju funkcionalnosti progresivnih aplikacij je treba biti previden, saj jih Angular privzeto omogoči zgolj v produkcijski verziji aplikacije, kar je tudi smiselno. Če bi te funkcionalnosti bile na voljo tudi v razvojni različici (z zagonom ng serve), bi v procesu testiranja naša aplikacija vračala shranjene medpomnjene vrednosti, kar bi otežilo razvoj. Zaradi tega je pri testiranju PWA aplikacij potreben dodaten korak, in sicer generiranje produkcijske verzije aplikacije ter strežba te verzije v samostojnem spletnem strežniku ali kar s pomočjo že obstoječe Express aplikacije, kjer imamo to podporo že na voljo. Če bi želeli zgolj preveriti delovanje Angular PWA aplikacije pa je priporočilo, da uporabimo kar npm modul http-server, kjer gre za enostaven spletni strežnik, s katerim lahko postrežemo našo produkcijsko Angular PWA aplikacijo. Namig: Spletni strežnik namestimo z ukazom npm install -g http-server. Tudi tokrat si bomo ponavljajoča opravila avtomatizirali v obliki skript, in sicer v okviru package.json datoteke Angular aplikacije. angular/package.json { ... \\"scripts\\": { ... \\"build\\": \\"ng build --output-path build\\", ... }, ... } Dopolnili smo skripto build, kjer zahtevamo izgradnjo razvojne verzije Angular aplikacije v mapi build, ki jo nato postreže Express strežnik. Ker smo pri predhodnjem razvoju zanemarili preverjanje produkcijske različice, moramo sedaj dopolniti določene pomanjkljivosti. Najprej bomo tudi v produkcijskem okolju spremenili lokacijo REST API strežnika na lokalno okolje. angular/src/environments/environment.prod.ts export const environment = { apiUrl: \\"https://sp-2023-2024.fly.dev/api\\", apiUrl: \\"http://127.0.0.1:3000/api\\", production: true, }; Prav tako bomo zaradi lokalnega testiranja izključili varno povezavo HTTPS. .env # HTTPS HTTPS=truefalse V nadaljevanju se bomo postopoma lotili dodajanja podpore brskanja brez povezave. 14.4.5 Brskanje brez povezave 14.4.5.1 Indikator povezave V obstoječi aplikaciji bomo najprej vpeljali indikator, da je odjemalec, na katerem se aplikacija izvaja, brez povezave v omrežje in ga bomo prikazali na uporabniškem vmesniku v orodni vrstici, kot to prikazuje slika 14.14. Indikator povezave v orodni vrstici aplikacije Slika 14.14: Indikator povezave v orodni vrstici aplikacije Funkcionalnost bomo implementirali s pomočjo nove storitve connection in indikatorja isConnected, ki se ob spremembi stanja povezave s pomočjo dogodkov tudi ustrezno posodobi. ng generate service shared/services/connection CREATE src/app/shared/services/connection.service.ts (139 bytes) angular/src/app/shared/services/connection.service.ts import { Injectable } from \\"@angular/core\\"; import { fromEvent, merge, Observable, Observer } from \\"rxjs\\"; import { map } from \\"rxjs/operators\\"; @Injectable({ providedIn: \\"root\\", }) export class ConnectionService { public isConnected: boolean = false; constructor() { merge( fromEvent(window, \\"offline\\").pipe(map(() => false)), fromEvent(window, \\"online\\").pipe(map(() => true)), new Observable((sub: Observer<boolean>) => { sub.next(navigator.onLine); sub.complete(); }) ).subscribe((connected: boolean) => (this.isConnected = connected)); } } Omenjeno funkcionalnost bomo najprej vključili v osrednjo komponento framework, kjer bo na voljo kot vizualni indikator, ki je prikazan na sliki 14.14. angular/src/app/shared/components/framework/framework.component.ts ... import { ConnectionService } from \\"../../services/connection.service\\"; @Component({ selector: \\"app-framework\\", templateUrl: \\"framework.component.html\\", styles: [], }) export class FrameworkComponent implements OnInit { constructor( private authenticationService: AuthenticationService, private historyService: HistoryService, private connectionService: ConnectionService ) {} public isConnected(): boolean { return this.connectionService.isConnected; } ... } Pogled dopolnimo do te mere, da vključimo ikono, ki se prikaže takrat, ko povezava ni aktivna. angular/src/app/shared/components/framework/framework.component.html <nav class=\\"navbar navbar-expand-md navbar-dark bg-primary\\"> <div class=\\"container-fluid\\"> ... <div class=\\"collapse navbar-collapse\\" id=\\"navbarContent\\"> ... <ul class=\\"navbar-nav justify-content-end\\"> <li class=\\"nav-item p-2\\" *ngIf=\\"!isConnected()\\"> <i class=\\"fa-solid fa-triangle-exclamation text-light\\"></i> </li> ... </ul> </div> </div> </nav> 14.4.5.2 Onemogočene funkcionalnosti v načinu brez povezave Če odjemalec nima povezave do REST API strežnika, je smiselno določene funkcionalnosti onemogočiti, in sicer: prijavo, registracijo, prikaz Google Maps zemljevida in dodajanje komentarjev. Podobno kot pri komponenti framework, bomo sedaj tudi pri komponentah login in register dodali referenco na storitev connection ter poskrbeli za onemogočanje vnosnih polj in gumba spletnih obrazcev. angular/src/app/shared/components/login/login.component.ts ... import { ConnectionService } from \\"../../services/connection.service\\"; @Component({ selector: \\"app-login\\", template: \`<app-header [content]=\\"header\\"></app-header> <div class=\\"row\\"> <div class=\\"col-12 col-md-8\\"> ... <form (ngSubmit)=\\"onLoginSubmit()\\" autocomplete=\\"off\\"> ... <div class=\\"form-group mt-3\\"> <button [disabled]=\\"!isConnected()\\" type=\\"submit\\" class=\\"btn btn-sm btn-primary me-2\\" > <i class=\\"fa-regular fa-circle-check pe-2\\"></i>Login </button> </div> </form> </div> ... </div>\`, styles: [], }) export class LoginComponent implements OnInit { constructor( private router: Router, private authenticationService: AuthenticationService, private historyService: HistoryService, private connectionService: ConnectionService ) {} public isConnected(): boolean { return this.connectionService.isConnected; } ... } angular/src/app/shared/components/register/register.component.ts ... import { ConnectionService } from \\"../../services/connection.service\\"; @Component({ selector: \\"app-register\\", template: \`<app-header [content]=\\"header\\"></app-header> <div class=\\"row\\"> <div class=\\"col-12 col-md-8\\"> ... <form (ngSubmit)=\\"onRegisterSubmit()\\" autocomplete=\\"off\\"> ... <div class=\\"form-group mt-3\\"> <button [disabled]=\\"!isConnected()\\" type=\\"submit\\" class=\\"btn btn-sm btn-primary me-2\\" > <i class=\\"fa-regular fa-circle-check pe-2\\"></i>Register </button> </div> </form> </div> ... </div>\`, styles: [], }) export class RegisterComponent implements OnInit { constructor( private router: Router, private authenticationService: AuthenticationService, private historyService: HistoryService, private connectionService: ConnectionService ) {} public isConnected(): boolean { return this.connectionService.isConnected; } ... } V okviru pregleda podrobnosti izbrane zanimivosti je na voljo tudi dodajanje komentarjev, ki v primeru načina brez povezave ne deluje. Zato bomo obrazec za vnos komentarjev skrili, gumb za dodajanje novega komentarja in prijavo za komentiranje pa onemogočili. Ravno tako v načinu brez povezave ne bomo prikazovali lokacije na Google Maps zemljevidu in bomo vsebino na levi strani (opis in oznake) razširili čez področje, kjer bi se nahajal zemljevid. angular/src/app/shared/components/location-details/location-details.component.ts ... import { ConnectionService } from \\"../../services/connection.service\\"; ... export class LocationDetailsComponent implements OnInit { modalRef?: BsModalRef; constructor( private modalService: BsModalService, private demoDataService: DemoDataService, private authenticationService: AuthenticationService, private connectionService: ConnectionService ) {} public isConnected(): boolean { if (!this.connectionService.isConnected) this.closeModal(); return this.connectionService.isConnected; } ... } angular/src/app/shared/components/location-details/location-details.component.html <div class=\\"row\\" *ngIf=\\"location\\"> <div class=\\"col-12 col-md-6\\" [ngClass]=\\"{ 'col-12': true, 'col-md-6': isConnected() }\\" > ... </div> <div class=\\"col-12 col-md-6\\" *ngIf=\\"isConnected()\\"> ... </div> <div class=\\"col-12\\"> <div class=\\"card mt-4\\"> <div class=\\"card-header bg-light\\"> <div class=\\"d-flex justify-content-between align-items-center\\"> ... <div [ngSwitch]=\\"isLoggedIn()\\"> <a *ngSwitchCase=\\"true\\" class=\\"btn btn-primary btn-sm\\" [ngClass]=\\"{ 'disabled': !isConnected() }\\" (click)=\\"openModal(commentForm)\\" ><i class=\\"fa-regular fa-comment-dots pe-2\\"></i ><span>Add comment</span></a ><a *ngSwitchDefault routerLink=\\"/login\\" class=\\"btn btn-primary btn-sm\\" [ngClass]=\\"{ 'disabled': !isConnected() }\\" ><i class=\\"fa-solid fa-right-to-bracket pe-2\\"></i>Login to post comment</a > </div> </div> </div> ... </div> </div> </div> 14.4.5.3 Medpomnjenje oddaljenih podatkov Ko smo naši aplikaciji dodali PWA podporo, se je kreiral tudi Service worker, ki skrbi za medpomnjenje podatkov na strani odjemalca v okviru njegovega spletnega brskalnika. Osrednja konfiguracijska datoteka, kjer lahko opredelimo delovanje mehanizma medpomnjenja je ngsw-config.json. Vse nastavitve konfiguracije Service worker lahko najdete med uradno Angular dokumentacijo. Privzete vrednosti, ki so nastavljene ob dodajanju podpore PWA obstoječi aplikaciji, bomo dopolnili tako, da bomo še dodatno zahtevali medpomnjenje zahtev na REST API strežnik (lokalno namestitev in produkcijsko okolje). angular/ngsw-config.json { \\"schema\\": \\"./node_modules/@angular/service-worker/config/schema.json\\", \\"index\\": \\"/index.html\\", \\"assetGroups\\": [ { \\"name\\": \\"app\\", \\"installMode\\": \\"prefetch\\", \\"resources\\": { \\"files\\": [ \\"/favicon.ico\\", \\"/index.html\\", \\"/manifest.webmanifest\\", \\"/*.css\\", \\"/*.js\\" ] } }, { \\"name\\": \\"assets\\", \\"installMode\\": \\"lazy\\", \\"updateMode\\": \\"prefetch\\", \\"resources\\": { \\"files\\": [ \\"/assets/**\\", \\"/*.(svg|cur|jpg|jpeg|png|apng|webp|avif|gif|otf|ttf|woff|woff2)\\" ] } } ], \\"dataGroups\\": [ { \\"name\\": \\"demo-api\\", \\"urls\\": [ \\"http://127.0.0.1:3000/**\\", \\"https://127.0.0.1:3000/**\\", \\"http://host.docker.internal:3000/**\\", \\"https://host.docker.internal:3000/**\\", \\"https://sp-2023-2024.fly.dev/api/**\\" ], \\"cacheConfig\\": { \\"strategy\\": \\"freshness\\", \\"maxSize\\": 20, \\"maxAge\\": \\"1h\\", \\"timeout\\": \\"5s\\" } } ] } Pri opredelitvi medpomnjenja zahtev REST API strežnika zahtevamo freshness strategijo osveževanja (vedno poskušamo dobiti dejanske podatke in postrežemo medpomnjene šele takrat, ko povezava ni na voljo po časovnem poteku 5s (timeout)), in sicer hranimo 20 odzivov strežnika (maxSize), kjer so v medpomnilniku shranjeni najdlje 1h. Če se še enkrat osredotočimo na rezultat testiranja naše aplikacije z vidika podpore PWA, predstavljene na sliki 14.13, moramo izpeljati še manjšo dopolnitev, da bodo testi orodja Lighthouse pozitivni. Poskrbeti je treba za ikone Apple naprav v datoteki index.html. Pri tem lahko preprosto uporabimo eno izmed ikon aplikacije, ki je bila samodejno generirana ob dodajanju podpore PWA naši aplikaciji. angular/src/index.html <!DOCTYPE html> <html lang=\\"en\\"> <head> <meta charset=\\"utf-8\\" /> <title>Demo</title> <base href=\\"/\\" /> <meta name=\\"viewport\\" content=\\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1\\" /> <link rel=\\"icon\\" type=\\"image/x-icon\\" href=\\"favicon.ico\\" /> <link rel=\\"apple-touch-icon\\" href=\\"/assets/icons/icon-192x192.png\\" /> <link rel=\\"stylesheet\\" href=\\"/assets/styles/fa.all.min.css\\" /> <link rel=\\"stylesheet\\" href=\\"/assets/styles/bootstrap.sandstone.min.css\\" /> <link rel=\\"stylesheet\\" href=\\"/assets/styles/style.css\\" /> <link rel=\\"manifest\\" href=\\"manifest.webmanifest\\" /> <meta name=\\"theme-color\\" content=\\"#1976d2\\" /> </head> <body> <app-framework></app-framework> <script src=\\"/assets/javascript/bootstrap.bundle.min.js\\"><\/script> <noscript >Please enable JavaScript to continue using this application.</noscript > </body> </html> 14.4.6 Končno testiranje cd angular ng build ✔ Browser application bundle generation complete. ✔ Copying assets complete. ✔ Index html generation complete. ✔ Service worker generation complete.

Mongoose connected to mongodb://127.0.0.1/Demo. Ko izvedemo vse spremembe, lahko z ukazom npm run build generiramo produkcijsko verzijo. Ko ponovno izvedemo analizo skladnosti z zahtevami PWA v okviru orodja Lighthouse, ugotovimo, da smo našo aplikacijo uspešno pretvorili v progresivno aplikacijo, kar prikazuje slika 14.15. Rezultati končne analize PWA Slika 14.15: Rezultati končne analize PWA Seveda so možne še številne izboljšave, vendar smo sedaj izboljšali uporabniško izkušnje obstoječe aplikacije do te mere, da je sama funkcionalnost zelo blizu domorodne aplikacije, saj za svoje delovanje ne potrebuje stalne spletne povezave.

İşçinin günlük ücretini hesaplarken, saat başı ücreti doğru şekilde uygulamak gerekmektedir. Fakat verdiğiniz bilgilere dayanarak doğru hesaplamayı yapmam gerektiğini fark ettim. Öncelikle, işçinin çalıştığı saatlerin detaylı bir şekilde netleştirilmesi gerekiyor. İşçinin bekleyiş ve makine hazırlığı gibi çalışma saatleri dışında geçirilen zamanlar da ücretlendirilip ücretlendirilmediğine dair bir bilgi vermemişsiniz. Normal şartlarda, bir işçinin günlük çalışma saatleri içinde geçirdiği tüm vakit (çalışma, bekleme, hazırlık, temizlik vb.) ücretlendirilir. Ancak özel bir anlaşma veya işveren politikası olmadığı sürece, bu vakitlerin de ücretli olduğunu varsayacağım. Bu durumu açıklığa kavuşturmak için, işte daha net bir hesaplama: 1. Çalışma süresini hesaplama: - 07:30 - 10:30 arası 3 saat - 11:00 - 11:30 arası 0.5 saat - 12:30 - 13:30 arası 1 saat - 13:30 - 16:00 arası 2.5 saat - 16:00 - 16:30 arası 0.5 saat Toplam çalışma süresi = 3 + 0.5 + 1 + 2.5 + 0.5 = 7.5 saat 2. Bekleme süresini hesaplama: - 10:30 - 11:00 arası 0.5 saat Bu süre de iş verilmesi beklenirken geçiyor ve eğer işveren tarafından ücretlendiriliyorsa toplam çalışma süresine eklenmelidir. Bu durum burada net değil. 3. Günlük toplam ücreti hesaplama: Toplam çalışma süresi (ve eğer bekleme süresi de ücretlendiriliyorsa) doğrultusunda işçinin günlük ücreti hesaplanır. Bu örnekte, eğer bekleme süresi de ücretlendiriliyorsa: Toplam çalışma süresi = 7.5 saat + 0.5 saat (bekleme süresi) = 8 saat Günlük toplam ücret = 8 saat x 400 TL/saat = 3200 TL Eğer bekleme süresi ücretlendirilmiyorsa: Günlük toplam ücret = 7.5 saat x 400 TL/saat = 3000 TL Sonuç olarak defter kaydı şu şekilde olacaktır: ---------------------Borç------------------------ | ---------Alacak--------- Personel Giderleri (veya Ücretler ve Maaşlar) | 3200 TL (veya 3000 TL) Nakit/Banka | 3200 TL (veya 3000 TL) Bu kayıt işçinin o günkü toplam çalışma saatine karşılık aldığı ücreti ifade eder ve işletmenin maliyet olarak hesaplarına eklenir. Bilgilerinize göre net bir hesaplama yapabilmem için işçinin bekleme süresinin ücretlendirilip ücretlendirilmediğini belirtmeniz gerekecektir. Daha kesin bilgi için iş sözleşmesi veya iş yerinin politikalarına başvurulması gerekir."},{"instruction":"bekleme süresi de dahil ediliyor","output":"Anladım, bekleme süresinin de ücretli olduğunu dikkate alarak, işçinin toplam çalışma süresi 8 saattir ve saat ücreti 400 TL olduğuna göre, günlük toplam ücreti hesaplayabiliriz.

Het was een hartverwarmende gebeurtenis, waarbij de traditionele betekenis van Kerstmis centraal stond. De kapel werd verlicht met zachte kaarsen en versierd met een keur aan kerstornamenten, die een gevoel van warmte en gezelligheid uitstraalden. Tijdens de viering heerste er een gevoel van kameraadschap en werden verschillende kerstliederen ten gehore gebracht.

Na afloop van de viering kwamen we samen om lekkere wafels te eten en koffie te drinken met het bestuur van Ziekenpastoraal-Samana.\\" - \\"Op Woensdag\\" moet \\"op woensdag\\" zijn: dagen van de week krijgen geen hoofdletter in het Nederlands. - \\"Eucharistie\\" is in de context van een zin met kleine letter, tenzij het aan het begin van een zin staat of in de titel van een werk of een specifieke benaming (zoals 'Heilige Eucharistie'). - \\"Bestuur van Ziekenpastoraal-Samana\\" zou met kleine letters moeten worden geschreven (\\"bestuur van Ziekenpastoraal-Samana\\"), omdat het hier gebruikt wordt als algemene term en niet als de officiële naam van het bestuur. - De komma na \\"viering\\" voor \\"kwamen we samen\\" is niet nodig."},{"instruction":"The panel used to control images and soumds in Animate CC","output":"In Adobe Animate (formerly known as Adobe Flash), there are multiple panels and tools that you can use to control images and sounds for your animations. Some of the main panels and features are: 1. **Timeline Panel**: This is the core part of Animate where you control the timing of your animations. It allows you to add frames, keyframes, and layers. You can place graphical elements and sounds on specific frames and control how they play over time. 2. **Library Panel**: This is where all of your imported media assets are stored, such as images, sounds, symbols, and movie clips. You can drag items from the library onto the stage or directly into the layers on the Timeline. 3. **Properties Panel**: When you have an object or a frame selected, the Properties Panel shows the properties of that object or frame. For images, you can adjust properties like position, size, rotation, and color effects. For sound, you can adjust its properties such as sync (e.g., event, start, stop, stream), effect (e.g., fade in, fade out), and repeat settings. 4. **Tools Panel**: This offers a variety of tools for creating and editing your images and sounds. For images, tools like the Brush Tool, Pencil Tool, Selection Tool, and Transform Tool are used for drawing and manipulating graphical elements on the stage. For sounds, while there's no direct sound editing tool within Animate, you can import sounds and then use the Timeline and Properties Panel to synchronize them with your animations. 5. **Sound Editing**: Adobe Animate CC does not have advanced sound editing capabilities, and you would generally edit your sound files in a dedicated program like Adobe Audition or another digital audio workstation (DAW) before importing them into Animate. 6. **ActionScript or JavaScript Panel**: For interactivity, including control over sounds, you might need to write some ActionScript (for SWF files) or JavaScript (for HTML5 Canvas). The Code Editor in Animate allows you to write and manage this code, which can be used to programmatically control the playback of sounds and images within your animations. Remember that Adobe frequently updates its software, adding new features and changing the way some functions may be accessed or used. Always check for the latest documentation or tutorials specific to the version of Adobe Animate CC you are using."},{"instruction":"Tell in one word","output":"Panel."},{"instruction":"The panel used to control images and sounds in Animate CC document.","output":"Timeline."},{"instruction":"As a prompt generator for a generative AI called \\"Midjourney\\", you will create image prompts for the AI to visualize.

مورد خودامدادی شامل موارد زیر است: 1. پیشگیری: آموزش و دانشی که باید قبل از وقوع بحران به دست آید. این شامل فراگیری مهارت‌های اولیه مانند خواندن نقشه، استفاده از وسایل ارتباط جمعی در شرایط اضطراری، شناخت نشانه‌های هشدار در طبیعت و همچنین تهیه و نگهداری کیف اضطراری شخصی است. 2. آمادگی: تدارک و برنامه‌ریزی برای شرایط اضطراری، شامل تهیه طرح‌های خروج اضطراری، آموزش خانواده‌ها و اطمینان از داشتن موجودی لازم از اقلام ضروری مانند غذا، آب، دارو و سایر وسایل کمک‌های اولیه. 3. واکنش: مهارت‌هایی که لازم است به فوریت به کار گرفته شوند هنگامی که یک حادثه رخ می‌دهد. این شامل اقدامات اولیه‌ای مانند ارزیابی سریع محیط، ایمن‌سازی محل و کمک‌های اولیه است. 4. بقا: دانش و مهارت‌هایی که لازم است برای ماندن زنده در شرایط اضطراری به کار روند. این ممکن است شامل پیدا کردن و تصفیه آب، شناخت و جمع‌آوری غذاهای قابل خوردن در طبیعت، ساخت پناهگاه و حفاظت در برابر شرایط آب و هوایی افراطی باشد. 5. بازیابی: مهارت‌های لازم برای بازیابی و بازسازی شرایط عادی زندگی پس از گذر از بحران، که شامل بازسازی خانه‌ها، ارزیابی خسارات و از سرگیری فعالیت‌های روزمره است. تاکید بر آموزش‌های خودامدادی از این جهت حائز اهمیت است که سازمان‌های امدادرسان ممکن است نتوانند به سرعت در دسترس قرار گیرند و افراد و جوامع باید تا رسیدن کمک‌ها قادر به مراقبت از خود و دیگران باشند. آموزش‌های خودامدادی نه تنها افزایش شانس بقاء را به دنبال دارد، بلکه می‌تواند به کاهش بار روانی پس از بحران و افزایش احساس کنترل و بازیابی سریع‌تر نیز کمک کند."},{"instruction":"아래 내용을 확인하고 한글로 요약해줘.

The fact of the matter is that Google installed a new login item without the user's specific consent and macOS allowed Google to do that. THIS is the real issue. Claiming that you gave your consent to this whenever you installed a Google software in the past is nonsense, since this new item was NOT part of the contract back then. So basically Google unilaterally modified the contract, which makes it void. Moreover, I specifically disallow every single background activity and every single automatic update feature for anything I don't deem important. So, this item was not only installed without my specific consent, it was installed against my specific prohibition (ie. disabling automatic updates). So, I think that instead of trying to make this a \\"no biggie\\" and passing the blame to the user, we should really ask the question WHY macOS even allowed this to happen! On this premise, any other software company could just do whatever they wanted on your Mac and Apple would allow it! I hope you get my point.

(5) Reply User profile for user: mhfaustmhfaust mhfaust User level:Level 1 8 points Nov 13, 2023 1:53 PM in response to stingysting I found this answer on the chrome support site. I'm still not 100% sure this is the legit answer, because the answer isn't' from Google themselves, but it's on their forum. The OP pasted the same image of the two background items (\\"Google Updated\\" and \\"Google LLC\\") in their question. =============== The \\"Google LLC\\" login item on MacOS is a feature that allows certain Google software or services to automatically start when you log in to your Mac. This can include items related to Google Drive, Google Chrome, or other Google applications. These login items are set to launch at startup to provide seamless integration with Google services and improve the user experience. Here are answers to your questions: What is Google LLC login item? The Google LLC login item is essentially a mechanism that enables Google-related services or applications to start when you log in to your Mac. It's a convenience feature that allows for quicker access to Google services and applications. What is it doing? The specific actions of the Google LLC login item may vary depending on the Google services or applications you have installed. For example, if you have Google Drive installed, the login item might be related to syncing files to your Google Drive account. In the case of Google Chrome, it could be for updating the browser or maintaining browser-related settings. How is it functionally different from Google Updater? Google LLC login items and Google Updater serve different purposes. Google LLC login items are related to the behavior of Google services or applications upon logging in to your Mac. They ensure that specific Google-related functionality is readily available. Google Updater, on the other hand, is primarily responsible for keeping Google software up to date. It checks for updates and installs them, ensuring that you're using the latest version of Google software. Why is it able to install itself in my login items without any authentication or opt-in action on my part? Google software often adds these login items as part of its installation process to enhance user experience and convenience. However, the exact behavior can vary depending on the software or the installation method. Sometimes, Google software might automatically add these items to startup without requiring explicit user consent. This is typically done to ensure that users have a seamless experience, but it can be adjusted in your Mac's settings. You can review and modify your login items in your Mac's settings. To do this, go to \\"System Preferences\\" > \\"Users & Groups\\" > your user account > \\"Login Items.\\" From there, you can manage which items are allowed to start at login, including those related to Google services. https://support.google.com/chrome/thread/243035925/what-is-the-google-llc-login-item-on-macos-and-what-is-it-doing?hl=en (4) Reply User profile for user: neil76neil76 neil76 User level:Level 1 12 points Nov 13, 2023 10:52 AM in response to chimpGPT When governments eventually have the gumption to lock these kinds of CEOs up for a long stretch, this kind of behaviour will reduce and eventually stop. Apple is as complicit as Google in letting these things happen and they should be held accountable too. For too long have these tech types been pushing the boundaries of consent with what they can and can't do with users' machines and data. In many other industries, this would be deemed illegal but the Tech world seems to get away with it because they are allowed to get away with it. Legislation needs bringing in to make them stop behaving like this.

I think that is why he keeps on answering this \\"you agreed .... google\\" answer and the \\"your question was answer multiple times\\" because he believes that is the answer. I am not taking it personally but he seems to answer all my messages on this matter so he is my example for this. \\"You gave Google permission, so it's not mysterious. \\" no, I installed it once, then update it since. My contract with google doesn't exempt apple from notifying me when something is added to the start, in fact, apple requires me to add my password to remove it, so why wouldn't do the same for the adding it, this seems stupid on my part. \\"If you don't like Google having this level of permissions, uninstall Google apps\\" well that is a solution to a ... jk, that isn't a solution. The solution would be apple to require authorization from the user to add it again not to remove the application, otherwise why would apple be saying they are on the consumer side of privacy and then let the application add itself over and over without your password prompt. This again, is stupid and a nonsense. My work place has google as the default browser, required, because of the many issues using from pc users using IE and mac users using safari. Again, your solution, isn't one, or at least isn't one that fits all. Maybe it fits your case scenario, but most of us do not find it useful.

Google is specifically designed to do that, and they are very good at what they do. Installing Google turns your Mac into a full time information-harvesting and -uploading \\"bot\\", rendering most of a Mac's advantages moot. - unfortunately, I have to have Chrome for one particular application that won't work on Firefox or Safari, but I won't use it for anything else. Understood. If you like Chrome, consider using Brave instead. Unlike Chrome, Brave does not impose the demands on a Mac that Google requires. Brave works well on Macs. Google works well for...

I believe I know the reason. Occasionally I will open up a YouTube video that someone has emailed to me. I use Safari for my email links, not Chrome. In Chrome, I am logged in to my Google account and have decided I am OK with (but not thrilled with) their knowing my preferences. I am not logged in to my Google account in Safari. Popping up a YouTube video in Safari seems to be the time when I find out that Google LLC is back in business. APPLE: I would appreciate an option that says that I don't want anything in my OS settings messed around with just because something on a web page tries to make it happen.

You could try to manually delete the LaunchDaemons Google installs, but I suspect it would just put them back there: Go to the main /Library/LaunchDaemons folder (not the one in your User folder, but the one in the root folder of your Macintosh HD) and delete any file which has Google in its name :) Alternatively, just uninstall Chrome and use a browser which is not spying on you.

This just showed up this morning, 11/8/23. I also have Google Updater, which has been there likely since I installed Chrome years ago. This new Login Item has no icon and just showed up separately from the existing Google item. This is how I got to this forum. Yes, I understand that Google installs updaters etc etc, and whether or not one wants this or agrees with it or not has nothing to do with why an odd Login Item was created called Google LLC. Which incidentally, these can be called anything you want them to be called, so there remains the possibility that this is not from Google at all. Does anyone else have this on their computer and can provide thoughts, input about it other than just \\"Google is evil\\" rhetoric?

General explanation Intel Mode uses a different technical solution to manipulate the charging behavior of MacBooks. This method only works with Intel MacBooks. On the other hand, this method works “permanently”, which means even if you boot into Windows via Bootcamp. However, there are several disadvantages to the Intel Mode. First, all other functions except the Charge Limiter don’t work anymore. Second, the Charge Limiter will always use the Hardware Battery Percentage which can deviate from the macOS battery percentage by up to 10%. You can read more about the Hardware Battery Percentage here. Example: Someone uses his MacBook a lot via Bootcamp in Windows and wants to set a charge limit also in Windows. To do this, you first have to boot into macOS and set the desired charge limit of, for example, 70%. Then you can boot into Windows and charging will stop in the range of 60%-80%.

There are a few issues that can be found in the given code snippets. Frontend JavaScript: 1. \`response\` is declared as a \`const\`, meaning it's a constant and cannot be reassigned. Later in the code, there is an attempt to reassign it with \`response = await response.json();\` which would cause a runtime error because you cannot change the value of a \`const\`. 2. The line \`console.log(response.body)\` may not yield the expected result because the body of a fetch response is a ReadableStream and must be processed (like with \`.json()\` method) before it can be logged. Since we've already called \`await response.json()\`, if you wanted to log the body content, you should log \`console.log(response)\` after this point. 3. The error toast message \`'Lyckades inte hämta bilderna.'\` is in Swedish, which might be intentional, but inconsistent with the rest of the code that is in English. This isn't necessarily an error, but something to be aware of regarding localization and internationalization practices. 4. The toast message severity is set to \`'info'\` which by common practice might be misleading since the situation describes an error condition. Typically, you would set the severity to \`'error'\` for better user communication. Backend Python: 1. The \`get_prepareItem_images\` function doesn't sound correctly named in English. It seems to be a mix of \`get_images\` and \`prepare_item_images\`, which can be confusing. It's better to choose a more descriptive name that follows the function's actual purpose. 2. There's a risk of returning binary-encoded image data directly in a JSON response. This is can be inefficient as Base64 encoding increases the size of the images by about 33%. Also, depending on the size and number of images, this can be very heavy for the response. It may be worthwhile to serve images as URL links to actual image files or use different methods for handling image data. 3. There's no error handling in the Python function. If the directory does not exist or there's an issue reading files, the server will likely throw an internal server error. Proper error handling and response codes should be included. Cross-language/Functionality: 1. The JavaScript function does not supply a request body or content type for the POST request. Generally, POST requests are expected to carry data and specify their content type (e.g., 'Content-Type': 'application/json') in the header unless the API is explicitly designed to handle POST requests without a body. 2. It's not clear whether there's any authorization or authentication taking place. Both the frontend and backend code should include measures to ensure that not everyone can access these endpoints or fetch images. 3. CORS (Cross-Origin Resource Sharing) isn't addressed here, but if the frontend is on a different domain from the backend, the backend will need to properly handle CORS to allow the frontend to access the resources. Based on the provided code snippets, these are the main issues that could be identified. There might be more issues, but they would require additional context about the application's requirements and environment."},{"instruction":"show me how to fix it on the typescript side","output":"To fix the code on the TypeScript side (assuming this is meant to be a method within a class containing \`host\`, \`images\` and \`toast\` properties), you will need to adjust the method to correctly handle the response, reassign variables where necessary, and ensure proper typing. Here's a version of the method with those changes: \`\`\`typescript class YourClass { // ... other properties and methods of the class ... host: string; images: Array<any>; // You should replace 'any' with the appropriate type for your images toast: { add: (obj: { severity: string, summary: string, detail: string, life: number }) => void }; async getImages(): Promise<void> { try { // We will assume response is correctly typed. let response = await fetch(\`{this.host}api/get_prepareItem_image\`, { method: 'POST', headers: { // assuming you aren't sending any actual data, you might omit 'Content-Type', but it depends on the server-side implementation } }); if (!response.ok) { this.toast.add({ severity: 'error', summary: 'Error', detail: 'Failed to retrieve images.', life: 3000 }); return; } // Instead of reassigning, use a new variable for the parsed JSON const data = await response.json(); console.log(data); // Assuming 'images' is part of the JSON response, you'll see it here // Assign the images property to the received data this.images = data.images; } catch (error) { // This will catch network errors, JSON parse errors, etc. console.error(error); // log the error to the console for developers this.toast.add({ severity: 'error', summary: 'Error', detail: 'An error occurred while fetching images.', life: 3000 }); } } } \`\`\` Here's what's been modified and why: 1. Changed the method name to \`getImages\` to follow camelCase naming conventions typically used in JavaScript/TypeScript. 2. Instead of reassigning \`response\`, we now declare \`data\` as a new variable to hold the parsed JSON. 3. Added try/catch to handle potential exceptions like network errors or invalid JSON. 4. The severity for the toast notification has been set to \`'error'\` when the fetch isn't successful since this is a more appropriate level for such situations. 5. Removed the \`console.log(response.body)\`, since \`response.body\` is a stream and doesn't hold the data directly. We're logging the parsed \`data\` instead. 6. Added generic types where necessary, but you should add specific types instead of \`any\` for real-world usage. 7. If there aren't any headers or body to include in the fetch request, you might consider simplifying your server to accept GET requests instead, unless POST is expressly required for other reasons (like side effects, security concerns, etc.). Make sure that the backend server sends back a JSON response that includes an \\"images\\" key with the array of images as its value for this frontend code to work correctly."},{"instruction":"You are head chef in a large five star hotel after looking at the minutes of an OHS committee meeting.

At which stage in this flow chart would you conduct a risk assessment and why?","output":"The risk assessment is conducted during the assessment stage of the flow chart. The flow chart you mentioned follows the basic steps of the risk management process, which are identification, assessment, control measures, evaluation, and monitoring. During the identification stage, potential hazards and risks within the workplace are identified. This can be done through various methods such as workplace inspections, hazard reporting, incident data analysis, or consultation with employees. Once the hazards are identified, the next step is the risk assessment. This involves evaluating the likelihood and severity of the identified hazards, considering factors such as the frequency of exposure, potential harm, and the number of individuals exposed. The risk assessment is a crucial step because it helps prioritize risks based on their severity and likelihood. By assessing the risks, organizations can determine which hazards pose the greatest threats to the health and safety of employees, allowing them to allocate resources and prioritize control measures accordingly. Based on the risk assessment, control measures are then identified and implemented to reduce or eliminate the identified risks. Evaluation and monitoring follow to ensure that the implemented control measures are effective and to review any new hazards that may arise. Therefore, the risk assessment stage is conducted after the identification of hazards to evaluate their potential risks and determine the appropriate control measures. It is an essential step that helps organizations make informed decisions about risk management and prioritize actions to ensure the safety and well-being of their employees."},{"instruction":"Risk is a measurement of two components. What are those two components?","output":"Risk is commonly calculated based on the combination of two components: the likelihood (probability) of an event occurring and the severity (consequence) of that event. 1. Likelihood: Likelihood refers to the chance or probability of a specific event or hazard occurring. It assesses the potential frequency or possibility of an adverse event happening. Likelihood can be categorized into various levels such as rare, unlikely, possible, likely, or frequent, depending on the likelihood scale used in the risk assessment process. 2. Severity: Severity relates to the potential impact or consequence of an event or hazard occurring. It measures the potential harm, damage, or loss that could result from the event. Severity is often graded on a scale, such as minor, moderate, significant, major, or catastrophic, depending on the severity scale used in the risk assessment process. When assessing risk, these two components, likelihood and severity, are considered together to determine the overall level of risk associated with a particular hazard or event. By analyzing both likelihood and severity, organizations can prioritize and allocate resources to control measures based on the level of risk posed and the potential impact on health, safety, and operations."},{"instruction":"A storeman working in the stores of a large hotel must regularly move boxes of goods onto and off trolleys. Use the table below to measure the risk and explain your reasons for your judgement. Fatality Major Injury Minor Injury Negligible Injury Very Likely HIGH HIGH HIGH MEDIUM Likely HIGH HIGH MEDIUM MEDIUM Unlikely HIGH MEDIUM MEDIUM LOW Highly Unlikely MEDIUM MEDIUM LOW LOW","output":"To assess the risk of moving boxes of goods onto and off trolleys for a storeman working in the stores of a large hotel, we can use the provided risk matrix table. Based on the given information, we can make the following judgment: Likelihood: Since the storeman regularly moves boxes of goods onto and off trolleys, it can be assumed that the likelihood of an incident occurring is \\"Likely\\". This is because there is a high chance that accidents or injuries may happen during the repetitive lifting and handling tasks. Severity: Considering the nature of the task, we can determine the severity of the potential outcomes. Moving boxes can result in various levels of injury, such as minor injuries like strains or sprains, major injuries like fractures or dislocations, or even fatal incidents in rare cases if, for example, a heavy box falls on someone. Thus, it can be classified as \\"Major Injury\\" in terms of severity. Based on these assessments, we can refer to the risk matrix table to measure and categorize the risk. According to the table: - Likelihood: Likely (second column from the left) - Severity: Major Injury (second row from the top) The point of intersection falls under the \\"MEDIUM\\" level of risk. Therefore, the measured risk for the storeman's task of moving boxes onto and off trolleys would be categorized as \\"MEDIUM\\". This categorization means that while the risk is not at the highest level, it still requires attention and appropriate control measures. It is essential to implement strategies to minimize the likelihood of incidents (such as providing training on safe lifting techniques) and to mitigate the potential severity of any accidents (such as using proper equipment and ensuring the weight of the boxes is manageable). Regular monitoring and evaluation should also be employed to ensure the effectiveness of control measures and continually improve safety in the stores of the hotel."},{"instruction":"Q7.Name four things which may lead you to believe that training is required by staff in correct lifting techniques","output":"Four things that may lead to a belief that staff training is required in correct lifting techniques are: 1.

Let's fix both the frontend (JavaScript) and backend (Python) code so they work together properly. First, let's fix the backend code by making sure that the base64 encoded string is properly converted to a format that can readily be used in the frontend – commonly, this means prepending it with the appropriate data URI scheme based on the image type. Here's the modified Python code with the assumption that the images are in JPEG format: \`\`\`python from fastapi import FastAPI from fastapi.responses import JSONResponse import os import base64 app = FastAPI() @app.post(\\"/api/get_prepareItem_image\\") async def get_prepareItem_images(): images = [] for image in os.listdir(\\"downloaded_images\\"): image_path = os.path.join(\\"downloaded_images\\", image) with open(image_path, \\"rb\\") as image_file: encoded_string = base64.b64encode(image_file.read()) # Assuming the images are in JPEG format images.append('data:image/jpeg;base64,' + encoded_string.decode('utf-8')) return JSONResponse({\\"images\\": images}) \`\`\` Note: If the images are in a format other than JPEG, be sure to change \`data:image/jpeg;base64,\` to the correct MIME type (e.g., \`image/png\` for PNG files). Now, let's fix the frontend JavaScript code. You need to declare \`response\` with \`let\` since you're reassigning it, and you need to properly reference the \`images\` property of the response body: \`\`\`javascript async get_images() { try { let response = await fetch(\`{this.host}api/get_prepareItem_image\`, { method: 'GET', }); if (!response.ok) { this.toast.add({ severity: 'Error', summary: 'Error', detail: 'Lyckades inte hämta bilderna.', life: 3000 }); return; } const responseBody = await response.json(); console.log(responseBody.images); this.images = responseBody.images; } catch (error) { console.error(\\"Error fetching images:\\", error); this.toast.add({ severity: 'Error', summary: 'Error', detail: 'Ett fel uppstod vid hämtning av bilder.', life: 3000 }); } } \`\`\` With this, after the \`get_images\` method is called, \`this.images\` should contain the base64 encoded images, which can then be used as \`src\` attributes in your image tags in the HTML like so: \`\`\`html <img v-for=\\"(imageSrc, index) in images\\" :key=\\"index\\" :src=\\"imageSrc\\" alt=\\"Image\\"> \`\`\` Please check that \`this.host\` contains the correct host information and includes the trailing slash. Also, make sure that your server is set up correctly to serve the images, the path \`downloaded_images\` is correct, and the folder contains images. Remember to handle CORS issues if your frontend and backend are not served from the same domain or port."},{"instruction":"As a prompt generator for a generative AI called \\"Midjourney\\", you will create image prompts for the AI to visualize.

رویکرد همکاری و مشارکت بین سازمان‌ها، نهاد‌ها و افراد است که در زمینه‌های مختلفی از جمله امداد و نجات به موجب توافق‌نامه‌ها یا پروتکل‌هایی از پیش تعریف‌شده، پیاده‌سازی می‌شود. این مفهوم بیانگر زیرساخت همکاری متقابل بین سازمان‌های مختلف به منظور به اشتراک گذاری منابع، تجربیات و توانایی‌ها در تنگناها و بحران‌هایی است که از توان یک نهاد یا منطقه خاص فراتر می‌روند. در حوزه امداد و نجات، دگرامدادی به ویژه در مواقع حوادث طبیعی مانند زلزله‌ها، سیل‌ها، طوفان‌ها و یا حوادث انسانی مانند تصادفات گسترده، آتش‌سوزی‌های بزرگ و حوادث تروریستی مورد استفاده قرار می‌گیرد. در این شرایط، همکاری میان نیروهای محلی، استانی و ملی برای پاسخگویی سریع و موثر به نیازهای ضروری و اضطراری، حیاتی است. اصول و عملیات دگرامدادی شامل موارد زیر می‌شود: 1. هماهنگی پیش از بحران: سازمان‌ها و نهادهای مرتبط باید پیش از وقوع حوادث با یکدیگر ارتباط برقرار کرده و در مورد نحوه همکاری توافق کنند. 2. منابع مشترک: از جمله تجهیزات، پرسنل، دانش فنی و مواد غذایی می‌تواند میان نهادهای مختلف به اشتراک گذاشته شود. 3. فرماندهی متحد: وجود یک ساختار فرماندهی متحد در هنگام بحران برای تصمیم‌گیری‌های واحد و جلوگیری از اقدامات متفاوت و گاهی متضاد ضروری است. 4. آموزش مشترک: برای اینکه همکاری در هنگام فعالیت‌های امداد و نجات به خوبی صورت گیرد، نیروهای امدادی مختلف باید از آموزش‌های مشابه و متداول برخوردار باشند. 5. تمرین‌ها و مانورهای مشترک: برگزاری تمرین‌ها و مانورهای مشترک کمک می‌کند تا سازمان‌ها با روش‌های کار همدیگر و چالش‌هایی که ممکن است در مواقع واقعی بحران با آن مواجه شوند آشنا شوند. 6. ارتباطات: برقراری یک سیستم ارتباطی قابل اعتماد و موثر بین سازمان‌های مختلف برای انتقال اطلاعات دقیق و به‌موقع از اهمیت بالایی برخوردار است. 7. مدیریت پس از عملیات: ارزیابی عملکرد و بازنگری در روش‌ها بعد از اتمام عملیات امدادی جزو مراحل مهم دگرامدادی است. موفقیت در دگرامدادی به عواملی نظیر اعتماد، همکاری متقابل، فداکاری جمعی و به اشتراک گذاشتن منابع در یک چارچوب منظم و هماهنگ وابسته است. اکثر کشورها دارای ساختارها و توافق‌نامه‌های رسمی برای اجرای این رویکرد هستند، و بسیاری از آن‌ها از طریق سازمان‌های بین‌المللی مانند صلیب سرخ و هلال
