Question: What does Annie start calling Ebby? If there is no answer, please output \\"Insufficient information to provide an answer.\\". Movie title: Bull Durham Context: \\"Crash\\" Davis (Costner), a veteran of 12 years in minor league baseball, is sent down to the single-A Durham Bulls for a specific purpose: to educate hotshot rookie pitcher Ebby Calvin LaLoosh (Robbins, playing a character loosely based on Steve Dalkowski)[2][3] about becoming a major-league talent, and to control Ebby's haphazard pitching. Crash immediately begins calling Ebby by the degrading nickname of \\"Meat\\", and they get off to a rocky start. Thrown into the mix is Annie (Sarandon), a \\"baseball groupie\\" and lifelong spiritual seeker who has latched onto the \\"Church of Baseball\\" and has, every year, chosen one player on the Bulls to be her lover and student. Annie flirts with both Crash and Ebby and invites them to her house, but Crash walks out, saying he's too much a veteran to \\"try out\\" for anything. Before he leaves, Crash further sparks Annie's interest with a memorable speech listing the things he \\"believes in\\", ending with \\"I believe in long, slow, deep, soft, wet kisses that last three days... Good night\\". Despite some animosity between them, Annie and Crash work, in their own ways, to shape Ebby into a big-league pitcher. Annie plays mild bondage games, reads poetry to him, and gets him to think in different ways (and gives him the nickname \\"Nuke\\"). Crash forces Nuke to learn \\"not to think\\" by letting the catcher make the pitching calls (memorably at two points telling the batters what pitch is coming after Nuke rejects his calls), and lectures him about the pressure of facing major league hitters who can hit his \\"heat\\" (fastballs). Crash also talks about the pleasure of life in \\"The Show\\" (Major League Baseball), which he briefly lived for \\"the 21 greatest days of my life\\" and to which he has tried for years to return. Meanwhile, as Nuke matures, the relationship between Annie and Crash grows, until it becomes obvious that the two of them are a more appropriate match, except for the fact that Annie and Nuke are currently a couple.

UPDATED:. 17:42 EST, 29 January 2014. A college professor today calmly live tweeted the moment he was told his plane would make an emergency landing and oxygen masks dropped from the cabin roof. Shashi Bellamkonda, an adjunct professor at Georgetown University, was on the flight from Washington DC to Boston this morning when smoke started coming out of the cabin's vents. But he and the total 58 passengers remained calm and the Embraer 170 aircraft eventually landed at a small regional airport without incident. He told MailOnline that it was midway through the flight when the oxygen masks dropped, but most of the passengers didn't even put them on until instructed by the crew. One last snap: Georgetown professor Sashi Bellamkonda (left) took this picture as his flight from Washington DC to Boston had to make an emergency landing this morning. Calm: Mr Bellamkonda and his seat mate were calm enough to take selfies during the emergency landing. Soon after, the pilot came over the intercom to announce that they would not make it to Boston, and would need to make an emergency landing because air pressure had dropped. Mr Bellamkonda said the atmosphere in the cabin remained calm, with passengers joking and taking pictures which she says is a testament to 'the period we live in'. There was a little bit of stress amongst the passengers over whether there would be a water landing, but luckily the pilot was able to set down at a small airport in Wilmington, Delaware. Once safely out of the plane, the passengers had to suffer for a while in the bitter cold on the tarmac until the airport could dispatch buses to bring them inside to the terminal. Safe but cold! The flight made a safe landing at a small airport in Wilmington, Delaware but the passengers had to wait for a while in the bitter cold for a bus to take them to the terminal. Out in the cold: Mr Bellamkonda sends a picture of the runway to United, asking for answers. And it wasn't until mid-afternoon that another plane was brought in to take them on to their destination in Boston. United Airline spokesman Luke Punzenberger issued a statement following the emergency landing. 'The Mesa Air flight, operating as United Express, landed safely in Delaware and we are working to get our customers to their final destinations as quickly as possible. The flight crew diverted the plane after a report of smoke in the cabin,' Mr Punzenberger said. There were 58 people on board in addition to 4 crew members. But Mr Bellamkonda said he was happy with the way the situation played out, and is especially thankful to the pilot for a safe landing and to the small airport's hospitality. He says the airport even bought pizzas for the passengers to eat since they didn't have any food vendors. Limbo: United Airlines brought in another plane to take the flight to Boston around 2pm on Wednesday. In the hours between, the airport provided free pizza to the stranded passengers. Free pizza! The airport was kind enough to provide food for the stranded passengers. Highlights:","output":"1.

(September 2016) (Learn how and when to remove this template message) A group of college friends consisted of Harvey, Nikki, Rob, Skip, Nan, Chaz, Kit, and Archâgather, celebrate spring break by spending the weekend at the island mansion of their friend and Skip's sister Muffy St. John, on the weekend leading up to April Fools' Day. The tone is set almost immediately with Muffy preparing details around the house, and finds an old jack-in-the-box she remembers in a flashback sequence. Meanwhile, her friends are joking around on the pier, then on the ferry to the island. When en route to the island, local deckhand buck Buck is seriously injured in a gruesome accident. Once on the island and in the mansion, it turns out Muffy has set up a variety of little jokes from the simple such as whoopee cushions and dribble glasses, to the more complex and disturbing such as an audiotape of a baby crying in someone's room and heroin paraphernalia in a guest's wardrobe. Through it all, despite the friends in general try to relax, Skip goes missing. Kit catches a glimpse of what looks like his dead body. Soon, Arch and Nan also go missing next. During a search, Nikki falls into the island's well and finds the severed heads of Skip and Arch and the dead body of Nan. Afterward, the remaining group discover that the phones are dead and there is no way to get off the island until Monday. One after another, the group either vanishes or being killed and their bodies being found.

Indonesia is an archipelago located in Southeast Asia, comprising approximately 17,508 islands. It is the world's fourth most populous country, with an estimated population of around 270 million people.  According to data on religious demographics, Muslims represent the majority of Indonesia's population. Approximately 87.2% of the Indonesian population identify as Muslims, which equates to roughly 229 million people. This large number of followers places Indonesia at the forefront in terms of the Muslim population globally. Islam reached Indonesia around the 13th century, and ever since, it has played a significant role in shaping the country's culture, politics, and societal structure. The major Islamic denomination in Indonesia is Sunni Islam, adhering to the Shafi'i school of Islamic jurisprudence. However, it is important to note that Indonesian Islam is famous for promoting religious tolerance and coexisting harmoniously with other religious communities, such as Christians, Hindus, and Buddhists. Following Indonesia, the countries with the next highest Muslim populations are: 1. Pakistan: With approximately 204 million Muslims, it is the world's second-most populous Muslim-majority country. Over 96% of Pakistan's population is Muslim, with the majority being Sunni, followed by a significant Shia minority. 2. India: Even though it is a Hindu-majority country, India has the third-largest Muslim population in the world, consisting of around 195 million Muslims or about 14% of the country's total population. Indian Muslims mainly practice Sunni Islam, but there is a notable Shia minority as well. 3. Bangladesh: This South Asian country has a population of about 164 million, with around 90% of them identifying as Muslims. Islam is the state religion of Bangladesh, but the country does promote religious freedom and tolerance. These figures reflect the significant presence of Muslims around the world, distributed across various countries, and highlighting the rich diversity within the Islamic community."},{"instruction":"What is the final step of the following process: -  Rock begins as magma from a volcano - The magma cools - Crystals form and the magma become igneous rocks - The igneous rocks break down into sediment - Become sedimentary rocks - If subjected to heat and/or pressure from plate-tectonic activity the sedimentary rocks become metamorphic rock - The metamorphic rocks melt","output":"The final step of the process, after metamorphic rocks melt, is that the melted rock (magma) returns to the mantle and can eventually be released through volcanic activity, starting the cycle all over again.

They arrive at a small cabin near Øksfjord, about a 45-minute walk from the road where they have left their cars. The cabin is owned by Sara, another student who is the girlfriend of Vegard (Lasse Valdal), the student in the main group with the most knowledge of the wilderness. She has been skiing across the mountains to meet them, but has not yet arrived.They drink and party until a mysterious hiker (Bjørn Sundquist) arrives. He tells them the dark history of the region; during World War II, a force of Einsatzgruppen led by the dreaded Standartenführer Herzog occupied the area. During three long years the Nazis abused and tortured the local people, and near the end of the war, with Germany's defeat looming, looted all their valuables before starting to withdraw from the area. The citizens managed to stage an uprising and ambushed the Nazis, killing many. The surviving Nazis, including Herzog, were chased into the mountains, and it was assumed that they all froze to death. The hiker says the area still has an evil reputation. He leaves to continue on his way. Later the hiker is murdered by zombies while camped in the snow.The next morning Sara has still not arrived and Vegard takes the group's snowmobile to look for her.

Mass murderer Nikolas Cruz is getting stacks of fan mail and love letters sent to the Broward County jail, along with hundreds of dollars in contributions to his commissary account.      Teenage girls, women and even older men are writing to the Parkland school shooter and sending photographs — some suggestive — tucked inside cute greeting cards and attached to notebook paper with offers of friendship and encouragement. Groupies also are joining Facebook communities to talk about how to help the killer.      The South Florida Sun Sentinel obtained copies of some of the letters showing that Cruz, who had few friends in the outside world, is now being showered with attention.      The attraction of women to prison bad boys echoes the fascination with killers like notorious cult leader Charles Manson. Lyle and Erik Menendez, the Beverly Hills brothers convicted in 1994 of murdering their parents, attracted a pair of brides while spending life in prison. So-called “Bundyphiles” sent bags of mail to Ted Bundy, the serial rapist-murderer who was electrocuted on Florida’s Death Row in 1989.      \\"I reserve the right to care about you, Nikolas!\\" wrotes a Texas woman in neat blue script in a letter addressed to the jail’s Post Office Box in Fort Lauderdale. The letter was mailed six days after Cruz murdered 17 students and staff and injured 17 others with an AR-15 rifle at Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School on Feb. 14.      Supporters express devotion to confessed Parkland school shooter Nikolas Cruz in letters, greeting cards and on Facebook. The killer's fans cite his diagnoses with autism and other disabilities, mental illness, and that he was bullied and orphaned as reasons why he deserves sympathy. (Doreen Christensen, Brittany Wallman) (Doreen Christensen, Brittany Wallman)      The reverent note takes up all available space on the front and back of a kiddie-like greeting card showing a furry bunny holding binoculars looking out at the ocean. The inside of the card says, \\"Out of sight, but never out of mind.\\"      A teenager wrote on March 15: “I’m 18-years-old. I’m a senior in high school. When I saw your picture on the television, something attracted me to you.”      The letter was mailed from Texas and tucked inside an envelope covered with hand-drawn hearts and happy faces. “Your eyes are beautiful and the freckles on your face make you so handsome.” She goes on to describe herself as white with big, brown eyes. “I’m really skinny and have 34C sized breasts.” She ends the letter with three preschool-rated jokes about gummy bears and peanut butter.      A woman from Chicago enclosed nine suggestive photos, including a shot of cleavage, another in a skimpy bikini eating a Popsicle and a tight shot of her backside as she bent over. Another girl sent photos with Hello Kitty Snapchat filters.      An 18-year-old from New York wrote: “No one else is dealing w/your demons, meaning maybe defeating them could be the beginning of your meaning, friend. I know you could use a good friend right now. Hang in there and keep your head up.\\" The letter closes with hearts colored in pink ink.      \\"There's piles of letters,\\" said Broward County Public Defender Howard Finkelstein, whose office is representing Cruz. \\"In my 40 years as public defender, I've never seen this many letters to a defendant. Everyone now and then gets a few, but nothing like this.\\"      Not all of the letters are from women. One card with a cat on the front is from an New York man sporting a bushy, gray, mustache. He enclosed photos of himself behind the wheel of his white, 1992 Nissan convertible.      Cruz has not seen the mail because he is on suicide watch, Finkelstein said. Customarily, inmates on suicide watch are locked in bare cells by themselves.      The jail opens inmates’ mail (except legal mail), according to the Broward Sheriff’s Office inmate handbook. Obscene mail or mail deemed to be a safety or security threat to staff is returned to the sender, the handbook says.      “We read a few religious ones to him that extended wishes for his soul and to come to God,” Finkelstein said, “but we have not and will not read him the fan letters or share the photos of scantily-clad teenage girls.”      Finkelstein said he worries “everyday boys and girls are starting to view him in an elevated way, looking up to his fame and notoriety.”      Confessed Parkland school shooter Nikolas Cruz appears in a Fort Lauderdale courtroom.      \\"The letters shake me up because they are written by regular, everyday teenage girls from across the nation,” he said. “That scares me. It's perverted.”      Jail workers have been busy screening letters, photos, greeting cards, postcards and the occasional book sent to Cruz, jail records show.      Cruz requested a Bible, according to jail records released by the Broward Sheriff’s Office, but it was denied because of the suicide watch, the public defender said.      Cruz also now has 800 deposited into his growing commissary account, apparently sent by fans, Finkelstein said. From Feb. 15 through March 5, 630 was deposited, jail records show. The county deducts 8 per day for “subsistence fees.”      Inmates can use the commissary account to buy snacks, personal hygiene products, radios and coffee.      Cruz’s fan club also extends to Facebook, with several groups of empathizers forming to talk about his case and how they can help him avoid the death penalty.      On the “Nikolas Cruz – the First Victim,” a now-secret group that until recently had 300 members, one young woman solicited photos for a collage to send to the killer. “I want him to see how many people love and care for him and all the beautiful faces,” she posted.      The page features a photo of Cruz wearing a baseball cap and glasses along with the hashtags #StopBullying and #OurBoy #NikFam.      The group describes its mission as “in complete support of Nikolas Cruz. Whether or not he did this, he was completely failed. He deserved to get the help he needs and he deserves a fair trial.”      “I want you all to know that Nikolas knows about us and he had the biggest smile on his face when he was told that we all support him,” a female commenter wrote on March 16. “Keep the letters coming because he can’t wait to finally get them.” She wrote that “hate mail is filtered out so no one can upset our boy!!! Haters gonna hate, potatoes gonna potate.” ||||| A 13-year-old boy from Central Florida told police he wanted to be “the next school shooter” — allegedly going so far as to keep photos of confessed Parkland gunman Nikolas Cruz on his Playstation, along with images related to the Columbine massacre.      “He wanted to kill a lot of kids,” said the Polk County Sheriff’s Office in an official incident report, recalling the Kissimmee teen’s alleged statements to cops.      “He wanted to die and see God,” officials said, according to WESH Orlando.      “He wanted to shoot up Westside K-8 School (in Osceola County, where he attended) because he wanted to be the next school shooter.”      According to police, the boy had been found passed out on a sidewalk in Davenport on Saturday.      He told deputies that he swiped a bottle of booze from his parents’ liquor cabinet and used it to down a bunch of “happy pills.” The teen claimed that he drank the whole thing, according to WESH.      “He wanted to kill different kids because they ‘snitched’ on him and got him expelled from Westside K-8,” officials said, noting how he claimed to have been arrested and charged in the past for threatening a kid who “tried him.”      The boy told cops on Saturday that he buried a handgun in his neighbor’s backyard — because he was afraid his mother would find it — but no weapon was ever found.      “This teen is clearly in trouble,” explained Polk County Sheriff Grady Judd.      “We hope he receives the treatment he needs to deal with his desires to hurt himself and others, but we have also placed him under arrest for felony aggravated stalking,” she said. “We cannot allow anyone of any age to get away with criminal threats to kill, especially when they are aimed towards schoolchildren.” ||||| What is a one-paragraph summary of the above article?","output":"Mass murderer Nikolas Cruz, the Parkland school shooter, has been receiving stacks of fan mail, love letters, and financial contributions in Broward County jail.

However, he arrives too late to find it destroyed and his family murdered, under Commodus' orders. Maximus buries them and collapses from his wounds and grief. He is found by slavers who take him to Zucchabar, a colonia in the Roman North African province of Mauretania Caesariensis, where he is sold to a lanista (gladiator trainer) named Proximo. Although reluctant at first, Maximus fights in local tournaments and makes friends with two other gladiators named Juba, a Numidian, and Hagan, a German. As he wins every match because of his military skills and indifference to death, he gains fame and recognition. But Proximo, who reveals that he himself was once a gladiator who fought well enough to be given his freedom, advises Maximus that being a good killer is not enough; a good gladiator is one who can \\"win the crowd\\". Proximo encourages Maximus to go to Rome and fight in the Colosseum because Commodus has organized 150 days of games. He could then use the power he commands in the arena as leverage against the Emperor. Maximus' first gladiatorial combat in the Colosseum is a re-enactment of the Roman victory over Carthage at the Battle of Zama. Although the gladiators (portraying the Carthaginians) are expected to be massacred, Maximus leads them to victory over the legionaries of Scipio Africanus. This prompts a...","output":"The duel between Maximus and Commodus, the climax of the movie Gladiator, takes place in the Colosseum in Rome. Throughout the film, the Colosseum serves as the primary location for gladiatorial combats, and it is where Maximus gains fame and recognition as a skilled gladiator, aligning with his intentions to take revenge against Commodus. As the Colosseum was a central symbol of Roman power and a popular venue for entertainment, it serves as a fitting location for the climactic conflict between Maximus and Commodus. Holding the duel in the Colosseum also heightens the tension and stakes, as it positions Maximus not just as an individual seeking justice, but as a symbol of resistance against a corrupt emperor before a captive audience. An important aspect to consider when deciding whether or not to invest in this film proposal is the potential for strong storytelling and character development. The movie Gladiator offers a compelling plot that combines elements of political intrigue, betrayal, and personal revenge, while providing viewers with an immersive look into the world of ancient Rome and its gladiatorial games. The central characters, Maximus and Commodus, are well-developed and serve as compelling foils for one another, highlighting the chasm between virtue, selflessness, and honor as embodied by Maximus and the corruption, cruelty, and egocentrism of Commodus. By pitting these two characters against each other in the Colosseum, the movie taps into both the historical context of the time and the human struggle between good and evil. In addition, the film's historical setting and attention to detail lends it an air of authenticity that can engage and educate audiences while also providing a strong foundation for visual spectacle. The inclusion of the Colosseum as both a symbolic and literal backdrop for the characters' struggles underscores how the grandeur and scale of the ancient world can be effectively exploited for dramatic effect. Additionally, Gladiator's plot and character arcs offer solid opportunities for actors to showcase their range and depth, potentially leading to strong performances that can further enhance the film's appeal. Sound production values and direction, combined with an engaging score, competitive marketing strategy, and the right cast, could all contribute to the movie's success in the box office and potentially garner critical acclaim. However, it is important to weigh the potential benefits against the risks. The film's historical setting and high production values might also come at a cost, requiring a significant investment in sets, costumes, special effects, and locations. Additionally, the film may be subject to scrutiny over historical accuracies or public reception, which could affect its overall performance and reputation. When considering this film proposal as an investment, it is essential to thoroughly review the budget, production plan, and projected financial returns, alongside evaluating the creative elements, as well as the potential audience appeal and market viability."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant that follows instruction extremely well.

Sweden has broken up large companies into many smaller companies. But Norway kept the handful of large electric power suppliers they had intact, and didn't take initiative to increase their numbers.  and a hint : Since the 1990s, many regions have broken up the generation and distribution of electric power to provide a more competitive electricity market. While such markets can be abusively manipulated with consequent adverse price and reliability impact to consumers, generally competitive production of electrical energy leads to worthwhile improvements in efficiency. However, transmission and distribution are harder problems since returns on investment are not as easy to find.  Please answer this question : Would companies in Norway find return on investment harder or easier? Answer:","output":"Companies in Norway would likely find return on investment harder in the electric power sector, as they have maintained a few large power suppliers rather than encouraging competition through the creation of smaller companies. In a competitive market, such as the one in Sweden, efficiency improvements can lead to worthwhile returns on investment. However, in Norway, where there is less competition among power suppliers, there might be less incentive to invest in efficiency improvements, thus making it harder to find attractive returns on investment. Additionally, the transmission and distribution aspects of the electric power sector, which are already challenging problems to tackle, might not see significant returns on investment due to the lack of competition in the Norwegian market."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Effusive opinions flowed from all directions: some saw the acquisition as a sensible fit for Microsoft to better support developers, and some saw it as a tyrant getting their grubby fingers on open source’s ecosystem. I am thrilled for Microsoft and GitHub for many reasons, and there will be a bright future ahead because of it, but I have been thinking more about the reaction some of the critics have had to this, and why. I find it fascinating that there still seems to be a deep-seated discomfort in some about Microsoft and their involvement in open source. I understand that this is for historical reasons, and many moons ago Microsoft were definitely on the offensive against open source. I too was critical of Microsoft and their approach back in those days. I may have even said ‘M’ instead of ‘MS’ (ugh.) Things have changed though. Satya Nadella, their CEO, has had a profound impact on the company: they are a significant investor and participant in open source across a multitude of open source projects, they hire many open source developers, run their own open source projects (e.g. VSCode), and actively sponsor and support many open source conferences, events, and initiatives. I know many people who work at Microsoft and they love the company and their work there. These are not microserfs: they are people like you and me. Things have changed, and I have literally never drunk Kool-aid; this or any other type. Are they perfect? No, but they don’t claim to be. But is the Microsoft of today a radically different company to the Microsoft of the late nineties. No doubt. Still though, this cynicism exists in some.

Article: (CNN) -- In the last week, the Apple iWatch has made the jump from unlikely rumor to a real product that's probably in development, thanks to reports showing up in various publications. The clues are planting the seeds of an Apple watch in consumers' minds. The general public has not been crying out for a better watch. And Apple prides itself on knowing what the people want before they do, and an Apple watch would be much more than just a fancy timepiece. It's not about the watch form factor, but creating a wearable mobile device that takes advantage of advances in mobile computing technology such as cheap sensors, better battery life and improved voice recognition. If executed correctly, an Apple watch could bring about a profitable industry of products to go with it, like it did with the iOS App Store and mobile applications. \\"It's unlimited, the number of wearable things you can put into,\\" said Gene Munster, an analyst with Piper Jaffray, who imagines small companies making inexpensive products like belts with sensors that send warnings to the watch when you've eaten too much. Apple is not entering virgin territory. There are already a handful of fancy smart watches available, but most act as accessories , connecting to the more powerful Android and iOS smartphones and tablets over Bluetooth. For example, the new Pebble smart watch passes on alerts from a smartphone, so when you receive a text, e-mail, or Facebook notification it is pushed to the watch, which vibrates . Wearable technology is also booming, thanks to cheap sensors that can be used to track things like movement and heart rates. The number of wearable fitness products has been growing at a fast pace, but an Apple offering would shake up the industry completely. \\"We're finally getting some players involved, and Apple is the real one that can add some value to some of this wearable technology,\\" said Munster.

Frequently; Given those answer options, answer the question: Dietary supplements are big business, with around half of the Australian population using at least one type per year; most commonly a multivitamin and mineral pill. Many people take supplements as a form of dietary insurance in case they are not meeting their nutrient needs from foods alone. Others take them as a form of health insurance – to protect against certain diseases. Some just take them out of habit. Supplements do have a role to play in some situations. People with a diagnosed deficiency, those with malabsorption conditions, women planning pregnancy, and people with very poor diets all can benefit from specific nutrient supplementation. But what about the benefit of supplements across the broad population? The mantra of most health professionals, which is even etched on the label of many supplements, is that supplements may only be of assistance if dietary sources are lacking. To see if this is supported by solid evidence, a systematic review of 63 clinical trials involving some form of supplementation in non-pregnant adults was carried out by a team of medical researchers. The clinical trials were broad in their nature with many nutrients studied including vitamins A, B6, B12, C, D and E; folic acid; calcium; selenium, omega-3 fatty acids; ginkgo biloba; glucosamine; saw palmetto; and milk thistle. All of the studies were randomised controlled trials and evaluated a range of health outcomes including risk of heart disease, cancer, diabetes, bone fractures, cognitive function and all-cause mortality. From the 63 studies, no benefit was seen in 45 studies with 10 of these showing a trend towards harm and just two showing a trend towards a benefit. Of the remaining studies, four showed harm with a greater risk of cancer with beta-carotene and a higher risk of fractures with a once-yearly dose of vitamin D.

A team from the School of Dentistry's Violence Research Group studied drinking habits in children aged 11 - 16 in England. They found not only a link between drink and violence but also that children who drank were more likely to be hit, even if they weren't violent themselves. The researchers are now calling for measures to prevent alcohol misuse to reduce injury risk. Current policy focuses on reducing aggression but this research shows that there should be equal effort to reduce victimization. More than 4,000 children were surveyed at 13 schools at four local authorities in the North, the Midlands, London, and the South. The study found that 25% of 11-year-olds were drinking monthly and 3.6% daily, with 12.8% admitting to getting drunk 3 to 5 times a year. By the age of 16, 40% were drinking weekly and 6.2% were drinking every day. The research also showed 22.6% of 16-year-olds were getting drunk more than 21 times a year. The study, which has just been published in the Journal of Adolescence, found a strong link between frequency of drinking and frequency of hitting other people. However, children who reported drinking monthly were also three times more likely to be hit. Adolescents  who drank but didn't get into fights were more likely to be hit than those who did fight.

Given the question: Background: A major use for petroleum products is fuel for cars, trucks, airplanes, trains, and other vehicles. The chemical used are usually a mixture of compounds containing several carbon atoms in a chain. When the material is ignited, a massive amount of gas is created almost instantaneously. This increase in volume will move the pistons in an internal combustion engine to provide power. A jet plane works on a similar principle. Air comes into the front of the engine and mixes with the jet fuel. This mixture is ignited and the gases formed create a lot of pressure to push the plane forward. The idea can be seen even more clearly in the case of a rocket launch. The ignition of the fuel (either solid-state or liquid) creates gases produced under great pressure that pushes the rocket up.

(CNN) -- An ex-judge accusing Venezuelan President Hugo Chavez of manipulating court rulings is a fugitive who \\"sold his soul to the devil\\" when he agreed to talk with U.S. investigators, the nation's foreign minister said Thursday. \\"People like him will keep being defeated and his lies will be unveiled,\\" Foreign Minister Nicolas Maduro said. Eladio Aponte Aponte, who was a Supreme Court justice until the Venezuelan government accused him of connections with an alleged drug trafficker last month, told SOiTV in an interview that aired this week that he made rulings in cases based on requests from Chavez and other top officials. When asked whether there were political prisoners in Venezuela -- something Chavez has previously denied --","output":"Aponte Aponte said in the interview that it was true there were people detained on political grounds and that these requests were often made by Chavez himself or his close associates. He added that the Venezuelan judiciary system had become deeply entangled in the political framework, making it almost impossible for the courts to render fair and impartial decisions in such cases. This revelation sparked outrage among opposition groups, who have long accused the Chavez administration of human rights abuses and the suppression of dissent. In response to the allegations, the Venezuelan government launched a campaign to discredit Aponte, claiming that his actions were motivated by personal vendettas against the authorities and that he was attempting to gain favor with the United States. This was further fueled by reports from state-run media outlets asserting that Aponte had met with U.S. officials shortly before his dismissal, suggesting a possible conspiracy. As tension between the opposition groups and the Venezuelan government escalated, protests erupted across the country demanding the release of political prisoners and a call for judicial reform. Faced with mounting public pressure, the Chavez administration announced the formation of a commission to investigate the allegations of political interference within the judiciary. However, critics argued that the commission was comprised mainly of government loyalists and that its findings would likely be biased in favor of the administration. The situation reached international attention when the United Nations and human rights organizations such as Amnesty International expressed concern over the treatment of political prisoners and the integrity of the Venezuelan judicial system. In response, the UN Human Rights Council unanimously passed a resolution urging the Venezuelan government to take immediate steps to address these concerns, including the prompt release of political prisoners and the establishment of a more transparent and impartial judiciary. Despite the international community's demands, President Hugo Chavez remained defiant and criticized the resolution as an example of foreign interference in Venezuela's domestic affairs. He accused the United States and other Western powers of using this issue to destabilize his government and promote regime change in the country. As the crisis persisted, it became clear that the Venezuelan government would not yield to the pressure and continued to resist calls for judicial reform and the release of political prisoners. This ongoing dispute significantly weakened the already-straining relationship between Venezuela and the international community, particularly the United States, culminating in diplomatic standoffs and a deepening sense of mistrust. In conclusion, the most logical completion of this news story would be that the accusations made by ex-judge Aponte Aponte would further entrench the political divide in Venezuela and exacerbate existing tensions with the international community.

Options are: + No + Yes Answer:","output":"Yes, Warren Harding was the first elected president after women gained voting rights in 1920. However, this statement does not directly answer the question of how many presidents of the US there have been. As of November 2021, there have been 46 presidencies, including the current president, Joe Biden, as some presidents have served non-consecutive terms, such as Grover Cleveland, who served as the 22nd and 24th president. The question regarding the number of presidents and the statement provided seem to discuss two separate topics. The question asks for the total number of US Presidents, while the statement refers to the first president elected following the ratification of the 19th Amendment, which granted women the right to vote in 1920. Although the statement is correct and provides an interesting piece of information about US presidential history, it does not adequately answer the question. A more direct and comprehensive answer would be to state the total number of US presidents and provide some context, as I have done in this response."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Due to its position between two unfriendly neighbours, Armenia has close security ties with Russia. At the request of the Armenian government, Russia maintains a military base in the northwestern Armenian city of Gyumri as a deterrent against Turkey.[citation needed] Despite this, Armenia has also been looking toward Euro-Atlantic structures in recent years. It maintains good relations with the United States especially through its Armenian diaspora. According to the US Census Bureau, there are 427,822 Armenians living in the country.

Kennedy, the 36-year-old grandson of the late Sen. Robert F. Kennedy and great-nephew of the late Sen. Ted Kennedy and President John F. Kennedy, has been a low-key presence in the House since he was first elected in his Boston-area district in 2012. But he emerged last week as a major Democratic voice against the Republican health care bill, delivering several speeches in a committee’s all-night session that have been viewed millions of times on the internet. While the technology may be new, his support for the Obama-era health care law and more services for the poor are familiar Kennedy territory. Sen. Ted Kennedy spent decades pushing for comprehensive health care before his death from brain cancer in August 2009. Now his great-nephew is fighting Republicans who are trying to unravel the 2010 law. They say the system is failing as premiums have risen and insurers have pulled out. Kennedy challenged House Speaker Paul Ryan, R-Wis., who had called the GOP replacement bill an “act of mercy.” “With all due respect to our speaker, he and I must have read different scripture,” Kennedy said during the debate. “The one that I read calls on us to feed the hungry, to clothe the naked, to shelter the homeless, and to comfort the sick. It reminds us that we are judged not by how we treat the powerful, but how we care for the least among us.” He added: “This is not an act of mercy. It’s an act of malice.” His office posted the video on Facebook, and as of Monday, it had almost 10 million views and more than 225,000 shares. Kennedy acknowledged his family legacy but stressed that he can’t allow it to overwhelm his actions. “I obviously am very proud of what my family has accomplished and what they have done,” he said in an interview, but “if you try to do this job and carry that weight around, you’re never going to be able to do anything.” When talking about his grandfather’s speeches, he is emotional, putting his hand on his heart. “God, have you read some of his speeches?” he asks, and notes that a one-minute viral clip is an easier task. It’s clear that he’d rather be talking about the details of his opposition to the health bill. During the committee debate, he criticized the bill for its one-year freeze in Planned Parenthood funding, and the resulting decrease in health services for women, and the repeal of a requirement that state Medicaid plans must provide “essential health benefits,” including mental health care. A separate Facebook video of him talking about mental health care has more than 4 million views. That issue is important in his family — mainly to his cousin, former Rep. Patrick Kennedy, who left Congress in 2011 and has since been open about his own battles with substance abuse and mental health. Now an advocate for increased mental health services, Patrick Kennedy says his cousin “managed to capture a moment when all eyes were on health care, and focus it with laser precision.” He says Joe is the right person to carry on the family legacy. “Most members have to be around for a long time and pay their dues before they garner the kind of credibility he’ll have,” Patrick said of Joe. “The fact is, is he going to use that to good purpose? As he demonstrated this week, he is not only prepared but is using to good purpose that incredible family legacy he was given by birth.” One of Kennedy’s good friends in Congress is Rep. Markwayne Mullin, a 39-year-old Oklahoma Republican who entered Congress with Kennedy four years ago and says he disagrees with the Massachusetts Democrat on almost everything. Mullin says they joke a lot, but they rarely joke about health care. They both sit on the Energy and Commerce Committee, where they took opposite sides on the bill last week. “He doesn’t speak out very often. He’s not someone that is front and center,” Mullin said. “But health care is something that is very important to him.” The internet took notice, with retweets and Twitter shout-outs from Massachusetts Sen. Elizabeth Warren, former first daughter Chelsea Clinton and former Vermont Gov. Howard Dean, who tweeted: “Wow. This is a Kennedy who could be President. A must watch.” House Democratic leader Nancy Pelosi cited his “passion and his leadership.” New Jersey Rep. Frank Pallone, the top Democrat on the Energy and Commerce Committee and a lawmaker who worked with both Ted Kennedy and Patrick Kennedy before Joe came to Congress, says his party needs more young people talking about the benefits of the health care law, since many don’t think it helps them. Joe Kennedy says millennials are engaged, apolitical, want the system to work and want solutions. “Trying to get to some of the solutions here is difficult,” Kennedy said. “But we need to find a way to get there.”","output":"Joe Kennedy, the grandson of the late Sen. Robert F. Kennedy, has emerged as a major Democratic voice against the Republican health care bill, garnering millions of views on his speeches posted on the internet."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Answer the following question: Information:  - North Africa or Northern Africa is the northernmost region of Africa. The United Nations definition of \\"North Africa\\" includes seven countries and territories; Algeria, Egypt, Libya, Mauritania, Morocco, Sudan, Tunisia, and Western Sahara. The countries of Algeria, Morocco, Tunisia, and Libya are often collectively referred to as the Maghreb, which is the Arabic word for \\"sunset\\". Egypt lies to the northeast and encompasses part of West Asia, while Sudan is situated on the edge of the Sahel, to the south of Egypt.  - Byrsa was the walled citadel above the harbour in ancient Carthage . It was also the name of the hill it rested on . The name is derived from the Phoenician word for citadel . In Virgil 's account of Dido 's founding of Carthage , when Dido and her party were encamped at Byrsa , the local Berber chieftain offered them as much land as could be covered with a single oxhide . Therefore , Dido cut an oxhide into tiny strips and set them on the ground end to end until she had completely encircled Byrsa . This story is considered apocryphal , and was most likely invented because Byrsa sounds similar to the Greek word  , meaning oxhide . The citadel dominated the city below and formed the principal military installation of Carthage . It was besieged by Scipio Aemilianus Africanus in the Third Punic War and was defeated and destroyed in 146 BC. Saint Louis Cathedral was built on Byrsa Hill starting in 1884 . Today , it serves as a cultural center . Today , the Byrsa , is part of the archaeological site of Carthage and in addition to the cathedral monument , has the Carthage National Museum built on it .  - The Mediterranean Sea (pronounced ) is a sea connected to the Atlantic Ocean, surrounded by the Mediterranean Basin and almost completely enclosed by land: on the north by Southern Europe and Anatolia, on the south by North Africa, and on the east by the Levant. The sea is sometimes considered a part of the Atlantic Ocean, although it is usually identified as a separate body of water.  - Carthage (from ; Phoenician \\"\\" \\"New City\\") was the centre or capital city of the ancient Carthaginian civilization, on the eastern side of the Lake of Tunis in what is now the Tunis Governorate in Tunisia.  - Carthage (' \\"new city\\") was the Phoenician city-state of Carthage and during the 7th to 3rd centuries BC, included its sphere of influence, the Carthaginian Empire. The empire extended over much of the coast of North Africa as well as encompassing substantial parts of coastal Iberia and the islands of the western Mediterranean Sea.  - A city-state is a sovereign state that consists of a city and its dependent territories. Historically, this included cities such as Rome, Athens, Carthage, and the Italian city-states during the Renaissancebut today only a handful of sovereign city-states exist, with some disagreement as to which are city-states. A great deal of consensus exists that the term properly applies to Singapore, Monaco, and Vatican City.    What entity does 'byrsa' has the relation 'country' with? Answer:","output":"Byrsa is related to the country of Tunisia, as it is located within the ancient city of Carthage, which is now part of the Tunis Governorate in Tunisia."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Background: Compared to conventional milk production, organic milk production tends to have lower eutrophication potential per ton of milk or per hectare of farmland, because it potentially reduces leaching of nitrates (NO3−) and phosphates (PO4−) due to lower fertilizer application rates. Because organic milk production reduces pesticides utilization, it increases land use per ton of milk due to decreased crop yields per hectare. Mainly due to the lower level of concentrates given to cows in organic herds, organic dairy farms generally produce less milk per cow than conventional dairy farms. Because of the increased use of roughage and the, on-average, lower milk production level per cow, some research has connected organic milk production with increases in the emission of methane.Animal welfare issues vary among dairy farms and are not necessarily related to the way of producing milk (organically or conventionally).  Paragraph: Two neighboring dairy farms produced milk for half the state.  Berry farm produced conventional milk, while Rose farm produced organic milk.  Given the paragraph above, please answer correctly the following question: Which farm had milk production which reduced leaching of phosphates?","output":"Rose farm, which produced organic milk, had milk production that reduced leaching of phosphates. This is because organic milk production tends to have a lower eutrophication potential compared to conventional milk production, like the one at Berry farm. Organic milk production, such as the one practiced at Rose farm, aims to reduce the environmental impact of dairy farming by using lower fertilizer application rates. This, in turn, results in decreased leaching of nitrates (NO3−) and phosphates (PO4−). By reducing the utilization of pesticides and synthetic fertilizers, organic farming methods help to minimize the contamination of water sources and soil, contributing to a more sustainable agriculture approach. It is important to note, however, that organic milk production may lead to increased land use per ton of milk due to the decreased crop yields per hectare that result from the limited use of pesticides and synthetic fertilizers. Moreover, organic dairy farms typically produce less milk per cow since the animals receive lower levels of concentrates. This practice may be associated with increased methane emissions due to the higher intake of roughage by the cows. In conclusion, Rose farm, which produced organic milk, had milk production practices that contributed to the reduced leaching of phosphates as opposed to Berry farm, which focused on conventional milk production. Although organic dairy farming has its own set of challenges, it tends to have a lower environmental impact, particularly in terms of eutrophication potential."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Families of the 202 victims who died in the bombings of two nightclubs in Bali have marked the second anniversary of the attacks with emotional ceremonies on the Indonesian resort island and in Australia.","output":"The event you are referring to concerns the tragic bombings that occurred on October 12, 2002, in Bali, Indonesia. Two separate bombs targeted popular nightclubs, namely the Sari Club and Paddy's Bar, both located in the busy tourist district of Kuta. The attacks were later discovered to be orchestrated by the terrorist group known as Jemaah Islamiyah, which had ties to al-Qaeda.  These devastating bombings claimed the lives of 202 people, including 88 Australians, 38 Indonesians, and numerous other citizens from around the world. The loss of life not only affected the families of the victims but also had a deep impact on the Bali locals and international communities collectively. On the second anniversary of the fateful event, emotionally-charged memorial ceremonies were organized both in Bali and Australia as a way for the grieving families, friends, and fellow nationals to come together in remembrance of the lives that were lost in the attacks.  In Bali, much like in the previous year, mourning families placed flowers, lit candles, and released white doves as symbols of peace on the bomb site, located at the heart of the tourist district. Religious leaders from various faiths - including Christianity, Islam, Buddhism, and Hinduism - led prayers and provided solace during the somber gathering, reflecting the diverse cultural background of the victims. A parallel commemoration ceremony was held in Australia, where a significant number of the victims hailed from. The Australian government arranged a gathering that brought together families, friends, and caring citizens who were distraught by the incident. The ceremony included the reading of the names of the Australian victims, observing moments of silence, and sharing of personal stories. Symbolic gestures, such as the forming of a 'survivors' circle,' further enabled attendees to remember and honor the lives of those who perished in the attacks. These memorial ceremonies served a dual purpose. Firstly, they helped provide collective grieving spaces for families, friends, and communities affected by the attacks. By coming together, they could offer mutual support and comfort, finding solace in their unity and shared experiences.  Secondly, the ceremonies acted as a powerful reminder of the importance of vigilance against terrorism and the necessity of international cooperation in fighting such menaces. By commemorating the lives lost, the ceremonies symbolized a steadfast commitment to prevent such tragedies from recurring and ensuring that the memories of the victims would not be forgotten.  The Bali bombings remain one of the most brutal terrorist attacks in recent history, and the anniversaries serve as a solemn reminder of the fragility of life and the need for global collaboration in maintaining peace and security."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Learn rules specific to your country or organization.\\"","output":"Title: Embracing the Goalkeeper Role: A Comprehensive Guide to Soccer's Unsung Hero Introduction Soccer, or football as it is known in many parts of the world, is a universally beloved sport with countless fans and players alike. One of the key positions in the sport is the goalkeeper, often hailed as the team's last line of defense. The pivotal role of a goalie cannot be underestimated, as their unique skill set can make or break a team's performance. This article aims to provide a comprehensive guide on the basic rules of soccer, the specific rules for goalkeepers, goalkeeper equipment, and organizational rules that might vary from one country to another. I. Learning the Basic Rules of Soccer Before diving into the specifics of the goalkeeper's role, it is crucial to understand the basic rules of soccer. Here are some essential rules to keep in mind: 1. The primary objective is to score more goals than the opposing team by kicking the ball into the opposing team's net. 2. There are two teams, each consisting of 11 players, including a goalkeeper. 3. The game is played in two halves of 45 minutes each, with a 15-minute break in between. 4. If a game ends in a tie, extra time and/or penalty shootouts may come into play as a tiebreaker, depending on the competition. 5. Players must avoid using their hands and arms to touch the ball unless they are the goalkeeper within their penalty area. 6. Offside rules restrict the movement of offensive players, preventing goal hanging and cherry-picking. II. Rules Specific to the Goalkeeper's Role Knowing the basic rules of soccer will make it easier to grasp the rules specifically tailored for goalkeepers. These include: 1. A goalkeeper may use their hands and arms to touch the ball within their designated goal area (the 18-yard box). 2. They may not touch the ball with their hands and arms outside of the penalty area. 3. Goalkeepers must release the ball within six seconds after gaining possession or controlling it with their hands. 4. They are not allowed to pick up the ball from a deliberate pass with their teammate's feet (backpass). 5. Goalkeepers must avoid touching the ball or moving off the goal line before a penalty kick is taken. III. Goalkeeper Equipment and Protective Gear Goalkeepers require specialized equipment to ensure their safety and optimize their performance, including: 1. Goalkeeper gloves: These gloves provide a better grip on the ball and protect fingers from injuries. 2. Goalkeeper jersey: This long-sleeved and padded garment distinguishes the goalie from other players and offers added padding for protection. 3. Soccer cleats: Appropriate footwear ensures good traction on the field, preventing slips and falls. 4. Shin guards: These protect the lower legs from injuries when engaging in tackles. 5. Padded shorts or goalkeeper pants: They provide extra protection for the hips, knees, and thighs during dives and slides. IV. Goalie Gameplay and Strategies A goalkeeper must be prepared to make saves, distribute the ball efficiently, and communicate with their team to coordinate defensive strategies. Key aspects of goalie gameplay include: 1. Positioning: Constantly adjusting and maintaining the right position in goal to effectively defend against shots. 2. Shot-stopping: Reacting quickly to save shots and prevent the ball from entering the net. 3. Distribution: Accurately and effectively passing the ball to teammates, utilizing both hands and feet. 4. Communication: Continuously offering guidance, directions, and encouragement to teammates to maintain defensive organization. V. Understanding Rules Specific to Your Country or Organization Lastly, it is important to familiarize yourself with the rules and regulations specific to the soccer organization or league in which you will be participating. These rules may vary depending on factors like age, gender, and skill levels. Most organizations follow FIFA's Laws of the Game, but they may have slight variations or additional regulations in place that you must learn and adhere to as a goalkeeper. Conclusion Becoming a skilled and effective goalkeeper does not happen overnight, but understanding the basic rules of soccer, mastering the specific responsibilities of a goalie, acquiring proper equipment, and staying informed about regional rules can set you on the right path. With dedication, practice, and determination, anyone can rise to the challenge and make their mark as a formidable force on the pitch."},{"instruction":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

Richards, an unemployed heir living off a multi-million-dollar trust fund, was spared jail time when Judge Jurden reasoned that he \\"would not fare well\\" in prison. Attorney General Biden has recently shown his support for Judge Jurden's decision on the grounds that the case against Richards would have faced significant challenges during a trial due to its \\"weakness.\\" Biden's support comes amidst public outcry over the handling of the case, especially given the shocking details of the offense and an alleged assault on Richards' infant son revealed in a lawsuit brought on by his ex-wife, Tracy. The case has sparked a nationwide debate on the role that wealth and social status may play in influencing legal outcomes, as critics argue that Richards' influential background has unfairly kept him out of jail despite the severity of his alleged crimes. Supporters of Judge Jurden's decision, however, argue that the judge was faced with the difficult task of weighing the likelihood of a guilty verdict in a trial with insufficient evidence. As the debate surrounding the controversial call continues, one thing is certain - the outcome of this case has brought to light questions about the fairness and impartiality of the legal system, and has prompted renewed calls for transparency and accountability in the decision-making process of judges and other legal authorities."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Sunk costs are sometimes contrasted with prospective costs, which are future costs that may be incurred or changed if an action is taken. In that regard, both retrospective and prospective costs could be either fixed costs (continuous for as long as the business is in operation and unaffected by output volume) or variable costs (dependent on volume). However, many economists consider it a mistake to classify sunk costs as \`\`fixed'' or \`\`variable.'' For example, if a firm sinks 400 million on an enterprise software installation, that cost is \`\`sunk'' because it was a one-time expense and cannot be recovered once spent. A \`\`fixed'' cost would be monthly payments made as part of a service contract or licensing deal with the company that set up the software. The upfront irretrievable payment for the installation should not be deemed a \`\`fixed'' cost, with its cost spread out over time. Sunk costs should be kept separate. The \`\`variable costs'' for this project might include data centre power usage, for example. Based on the above text, what's the best answer to this question: is a fixed cost always a sunk cost? Options:  (A). no.  (B). yes.","output":"(A). no. The best answer to the question is \\"no,\\" a fixed cost is not always a sunk cost. Fixed costs are continuous costs for as long as the business is in operation and are unaffected by output volume. Examples of fixed costs include monthly payments made as part of a service contract or licensing deal. In contrast, sunk costs are one-time expenses that cannot be recovered once spent, such as the 400 million spent on the enterprise software installation. While both fixed and sunk costs can be considered retrospective and prospective costs, they should not be confused with one another since they have different characteristics and implications for business decisions."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Premise: a bar with 2 girls and a man sitting on a table Hypothesis: People are walking along the beach. .Given the premise, can we conclude the hypothesis?","output":"Based on the information given in the premise, it would be inaccurate to conclusively infer the hypothesis.  The premise describes a scene within a bar where two girls and a man are sitting on a table. The crucial details in the premise entail an inside setting and the presence of three people. The premise does not extend information about additional scenes or events happening outside the bar. Therefore, the context remains restricted to the interior of the establishment and the individuals mentioned.  Meanwhile, the hypothesis introduces an entirely separate scenario with people walking along the beach. This situation is completely unrelated to the original premise as it has no reference from a bar setting or the presence of the two girls and a man. Instead, it introduces a new locale, which is outside and involves a beach, and an unidentified group of people engaged in a different activity – walking. In argument logic, to draw an accurate conclusion from a premise, there should be a logical transition or extension from the information provided. The hypothesis, in this case, does not fit into this logical chain since it introduces new elements that cannot be inferred based on the initial premise. Hence, from the provided premise concerning a scenario in a bar, we cannot conclude people are walking along the beach, as the hypothesis suggests. The scenario described in the premise does not contain any information about a beach or people walking along it. In conclusion, the premise does not provide any assertion whether this scene at the bar is happening near a beach, far from it, or even during a time in which people would typically be walking along the beach.

Kenan, one of the suspects, leads them from one water fountain to another; at the time of the crime he was drunk and he cannot recall where he and his mentally challenged brother buried the body. The darkness and visual indistinctness of the landscape do not help; each spot looks the same as the others. Meanwhile, the men discuss a variety of topics, such as yoghurt, lamb chops, urination, family, spouses, ex-wives, death, suicide, hierarchy, bureaucracy, ethics, and their jobs. Philosophy is also discussed, with one apparently central and particular idea/theme mentioned a couple of times throughout the filmâthe idea that children invariably pay for their parents' mistakes. After many stops the prosecutor begins to tell the doctor about a particularly mysterious death where a woman correctly predicted to her husband the exact date of her own death, which was a short time after she had given birth to a child. The story is interrupted when the prosecutor sees some of his men lashing out at Kenan after discovering that once again they are in the wrong spot. As the group discusses what to do next, Kenan asks the doctor for a cigarette which he tries to give him. Commisar Naci stops him however and tells Kenan that he can have a cigarette when he earns it. The group stops at a nearby village to eat at the home of the town mayor. The mayor pleads with the prosecutor to speak to the authorities of his town to help provide funds to build a morgue where bodies can be prepared.

I remember back in the late 1970’s when I first started investing in property as a young guy, being taken to a house that felt EXTREMELY cold, strange, and rather chilling. Okay it was an older house that need some renovation work, but there was something about the place that just did not seem right. But despite that, it was available for purchase at what seemed to be a very attractive price … always a good starting point. Anyway, the real estate agent finished taking me around the property answering the questions that I had, and I left with a plan to do some costings before making a decision. But something was niggling me and making me feel a little uncomfortable, so I decided to investigate the property further. A couple of days later I was around at a friends house. He was in the Police force and as it happened he was in the same neighbourhood, I mentioned this particular property that I was looking at buying. He asked me the actual address after which he ‘kindly’ informed me that that that house had been the scene of a murder 6 months previously. It turned out that the property had been rented to a homosexual couple and that after an argument, one had murdered the other in the bath and then proceeded to cut his head off. Apparently the head was subsequently discovered a week later in the trunk of a car that had been abandoned up by a local golf-course. Less than impressed that the real estate agent had been less than forthcoming with me, I made the decision to not to proceed with the purchase. As they say in the property business ‘Location, Location, Location’ is always an important factor in determining the value of a property.

John saw Fred.","output":"From a linguistic perspective, the sentence \\"John saw Fred.\\" can indeed be considered correct by the strictest standards, depending on the context and the linguistic criteria that are being applied. Let us examine the sentence more closely by breaking it down into various components and applying different linguistic perspectives. 1. Syntax: The sentence is syntactically sound, as it follows the basic structure of a declarative sentence in English: Subject (John) + Verb (saw) + Object (Fred). It also adheres to the Subject-Verb-Object (SVO) word order that is common in English sentences. 2. Morphology: Both \\"John\\" and \\"Fred\\" are proper nouns, which are capitalized and function appropriately as the subject and object of the sentence, respectively. The verb \\"saw\\" is the past tense of \\"see,\\" which accurately conveys the completed action in the past. 3. Semantics: The sentence is semantically well-formed as it has a clear meaning. \\"John,\\" the subject, is the one performing the action, while \\"Fred,\\" the object, is the one being perceived in the action. The verb \\"saw\\" effectively conveys the act of visual perception. 4. Pragmatics: Context is crucial in determining the correctness of a sentence in pragmatics. Assuming that the listener/reader already knows who John and Fred are, the sentence conveys pertinent information and appears pragmatically correct. If the identities of John and Fred have not been previously established, the sentence could be confusing, and additional information might be necessary for clearer understanding. 5. Phonology: The sentence is phonologically well-formed, as all the words are pronounced according to the standard rules of English. There are no unusual phoneme combinations that might cause pronunciation difficulties for native speakers. 6. Prescriptive vs. Descriptive: From a prescriptive standpoint, the sentence is grammatically correct according to the standard rules of English. Descriptively speaking, this sentence is also acceptable as it is a construction commonly used by English speakers in everyday communication. In conclusion, by the strictest linguistic standards and across various dimensions of language, the sentence \\"John saw Fred.\\" can be considered correct. However, it is crucial to remember that context plays a significant role in determining the correctness and appropriateness of a sentence."},{"instruction":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

Like summer megahit Stranger Things, the intriguing new show about a 20-something woman looks to combine elements of science fiction, mystery and horror. It’s also notable that the trailer dropped just a few days before The OA premieres, a show of faith that this new offering doesn’t need much hype to hook audiences. Netflix didn’t release much information about the premise, but here’s what we know so far.      What it’s about:      The story centers on a woman who may or may not have it together: Prairie Johnson (Brit Marling) who returns to her family seven years after she disappeared without explanation. Twist #1: when she went missing as a kid, she was blind, and now she can see. In the trailer, Prairie plays a low-key game of “what happened to me for the last seven years?” If Prairie experienced severe trauma (or even resurrection) related to her disappearance, she couldn’t see it, but she can recall people through touch. The series asks the audience to buy into the “unknown,” and Netflix describes it as a “powerful, mind-bending tale about identity, human connection and the borders between life and death.”      Who’s involved:      The creators are the team behind the 2013 thriller The East: Brit Marling, who stars, and Zal Batmanglij, who directs all eight episodes. And you’ve probably seen Marling’s co-stars before: Emory Cohen (Tony Fiorello in Brooklyn), Scott Wilson (Hershel Greene in The Walking Dead) and Jason Isaacs (Lucius Malfoy in the Harry Potter movies.)      What it’s like:      From what we can tell from the vibes of the trailer, this may be a strong contender to fill the gaping Stranger Things hole in your heart until the second season premieres in 2017. As Prairie’s recovers her memory, she seems to access some very supernatural experiences including that time she had a confused walkabout on a terrain that looks a lot like a video game. Like many stories about young female “science experiments” before her (Stranger Things and Firestarter anyone?) Prairie’s a small town girl participating in psychological experiments at an unethical lab, but there’s no telling how familiar it will be just yet. As far as mysteries about missing people go, it seems less horror-like than True Detective’s first season.      It might also scratch the Westworld itch before that show returns in 2018. As detectives question Prairie about her disappearance, she seems to flash back to memories that will give everyone some clarity on what happened to her. Dolores much? So if hopping on a rollercoaster “who am I?” ride is your thing, then this might be your show.      More cryptic hints from Netflix:      All ideal icebreakers for holiday parties.      Everyone will know more on Friday. Watch the full trailer above. ||||| The trailer looks spookily familiar      Today we’re all watching a new trailer for The OA, a sci-fi drama and psychological thriller that drops on Netflix this Friday – and might just become a whirlwind success.      The synopsis (from what we can gather from the trailer)      A young woman (Prairie Johnson, played by Brit Marling) goes missing and returns to her family seven years later. At first she doesn’t recognise them. It is revealed that when she went missing she was blind; she has now miraculously gained her sight, but can only recognise her parents from touch memory.      She then begins to talk about what happened when she went missing. “I didn’t disappear. I was present for all of it,” she says. The trailer cuts through clips of Prairie going through scientific experiments, slipping off the edge of a boat into the sea, running through the woods, and being spied upon through a door, revealing strange red and orange markings on her back. She rides on the back of a bicycle as the video cuts to a lorry falling from a viaduct. Cue lots of crescendo, running, blood falling backwards and, finally, the woman standing in a glass box in a house. It’s creepy as hell, and looks pretty incredible.      The new Stranger Things? The sequel to Stranger Things?      It’s very Stranger Things, but there’s no kid in sight. Take the scientific experimentation for example:      Very reminiscent of Eleven’s sensory deprivation tank.      And the bike riding. And van crashing.      Familiar?      This video is taken from The OA Instagram page.      Dreams don't give you nosebleeds. A video posted by The OA (@the_oa) on Dec 9, 2016 at 11:31am PST      Quite Eleven-like, don’t you think?      Still      They’ve done several collage images, taking individual Instagram squares to create a larger image. And one of those images? UPSIDE DOWN.      The OA/Instagram      And if this doesn’t give you Stranger Things feels, I don’t know what will.      The OA/Instagram      Could The OA and Stranger Things be part of the same universe? Is Prairie Johnson an adult Eleven, or another one of Papa’s experiments from the Hawkins National Laboratory? Or is The OA just piggybacking on the Netflix success of July’s spooky thriller? Either way, it’s rather exciting.      READ: Stranger Things Season 2: Everything you need to know ||||| Here’s a concept: A medical mystery of a girl is seen hooked up to wires in a secretive research facility that appears to conduct high-tech mind-based experiments. The scene is contrasted by images of her running through woods and bleeding from the nose.      The character in question is Prairie Johnson in Netflix’s upcoming series “The OA” ― but she’s giving us serious Eleven from “Stranger Things” vibes. (Minus the whole ‘80s thing.) Netflix announced by surprise on Monday that all eight episodes of the drama series are set for release Friday.      Trust the unknown. All chapters of Netflix Original Series #theOA launch this Friday. pic.twitter.com/hTNiEPbdp9 — The OA (@The_OA) December 12, 2016      Although the streaming service produces a lot of new original content on the regular, we usually know what’s coming out when. In this case, there’s almost no information about “The OA” on Netflix ― and only some creepy hints on Twitter.      Have you seen death? — Netflix US (@netflix) December 12, 2016      Have you seen darkness? — Netflix US (@netflix) December 12, 2016      Have you seen the light? — Netflix US (@netflix) December 12, 2016      The series comes from creators Brit Marling and Zal Batmanglij, who partnered up on a environmental-themed thriller, “The East,” which premiered at Sundance in 2013.      Its trailer reveals little, but sets itself apart from “Stranger Things” with somber violin music and scenes bathed in muted tones. Marling stars as Prairie, who went missing for seven years as a girl and returned as an adult with her blindness mysteriously cured. After returning home to some intense public attention, a team of men questions Prairie about her disappearance, and she undergoes some kind of memory recovery therapy. In flashes, she’s also shown running through woods and fields, jumping off a bridge, and uncovering odd markings on her back. There’s a gun, blood, and an accident on a bridge.      Also appearing are Emory Cohen (Tony Fiorello in “Brooklyn”), Scott Wilson (Herschel Greene in “The Walking Dead”), Jason Isaacs (Lucius Malfoy in “Harry Potter”) and Phyllis Smith (Phyllis Vance in “The Office”).      So: What’s “The OA” about? We’re still not quite sure. Social media pages for the series offer only the most cryptic of hints.      On Instagram, images showing pills and people hooked up to machines are peppered with messages reading “This is a dream but you’re wide awake,” “I liked it better when you were blind,” “How do we fight the cold?” and “Which way is up?” ||||| What is a shorter version of the above article?","output":"There's a new show on Netflix called \\"The OA\\" that is a bit mysterious and exciting.

They started off poorly again, being held scoreless in the first half. Donovan McNabb tossed three interceptions in the first three quarters, with two of them being returned for touchdowns by Tampa Bay cornerback Ronde Barber. Trailing 17-0, McNabb found fullback Thomas Tapeh in the end zone. A short touchdown pass to Reggie Brown brought the Eagles to within three. The Bucs added a field goal, making it 20-14. With&#160;:33 left in the game, Brian Westbrook took a short pass and rumbled to a 52-yard touchdown. The point after gave the Eagles the lead, and it seemed as though they had pulled out a dramatic victory. However, a last-ditch 62-yard field goal attempt by Matt Bryant somehow made it through the uprights, robbing Philadelphia of the win. Westbrook had over 100 yards in both rushing and receiving in the defeat.

Translate this to English?","output":"Madam President, I would like to talk about the Schengen Information System. The Schengen Information System (SIS) is a vital component of the Schengen Agreement, which allows for passport-free travel within the participating countries in Europe. This large-scale information-sharing system connects the law enforcement authorities, border control agencies, and immigration offices of the 26 Schengen Area member states. The primary objective of the SIS is to maintain public safety and security, reinforce border control, and facilitate cooperation among the participating countries, while at the same time minimizing the negative impacts of free movement within the Schengen Area. The SIS was initially established in 1995 and has evolved over time, with the implementation of the second-generation system, SIS II, in 2013. SIS II offers more advanced functionalities, such as the use of biometric data, better compatibility with other EU information systems, and a more efficiently managed technical infrastructure. Data sharing in the SIS is of utmost importance, as it enables member states to exchange critical information and alerts on individuals and objects of interest. This includes, but is not limited to, information on wanted or missing persons, criminal suspects, persons subject to entry bans, stolen or lost vehicles, and stolen or lost firearms. The system also supports the European Arrest Warrant mechanism and assists in the location and arrest of individuals sought for serious crimes or terrorism-related activities. To ensure the protection of personal data, the SIS adheres to strict data protection rules and principles. Access to the system is limited to authorized personnel, and the use of the information is restricted to the purpose for which it was entered into the system. Additionally, individuals have the right to request access to their personal data stored in the SIS, and they can ask for corrections or deletions if the data is inaccurate or has been processed unlawfully. The efficiency and effectiveness of the SIS depend on the active participation of the member states. Close cooperation, regular exchange of information, and compliance with the data protection rules are essential for the proper functioning of the system. As a testament to its importance, the SIS remains one of the most frequently used and successful information-sharing tools in Europe. It has proven to be a crucial asset in promoting cooperation between law enforcement and border control agencies and in maintaining security and safety across the Schengen Area."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Rugby union takes foothold in US with rise of crossover competitors There are always those who would prefer rugby union to remain untouched by progress. Think of some of the things now taken for granted that felt bold at the time: the inaugural Rugby World Cup (1987), the five-point try (1992), the advent of professionalism (1995). When people blithely trot out the cliche that rugby will never take off in the US, they do so with the same confidence the Flat Earth Society used to exude in the good old days before satellite technology spoiled everything. Look at the evidence and make up your own mind. The population of the US is more than 310 million. Olympic recognition for rugby sevens has freed up the sort of national funding that had been a distant dream. There are thousands of American footballers and basketball players who are not going to gain a professional NFL or NBA contracts but who are increasingly realising there is a global sport that potentially suits their skill set perfectly. Perhaps the most feared forward in the Premiership, Northampton's Samu Manoa, is an American international. The All Blacks are set to play a Test in the States – the likely venue is Soldier Field, Chicago – on 1 November. Stick it all together and you have a country that, one day, really could play ball with the best of them. The 60m question, surely, is when rather than if. The 2016 Olympics in Rio will have the American women's sevens team pushing for a medal. In last week's Tokyo leg of the HSBC Sevens, the American men beat Samoa and drew with the eventual champions Fiji. There are 25 rugby players training full time at the US Olympic training centre in California; the vast majority are sevens players but not exclusively so. Premiership clubs will also once again be flying out to monitor the national college sevens in Philadelphia at the end of May, an event screened by NBC Sports. A company called RugbyLaw is trying to establish a professional club tournament in the US and is holding trials in Minnesota early next month – presided over by the former Ireland coach Eddie O'Sullivan – for gridiron athletes keen to pursue a union career. They include a former wide receiver named Yamon Figurs, who apparently makes the American sevens blur, Carlin Isles, look pedestrian. The concept of \\"crossover\\" athletes is definitely on the rise. All it needs is for something – or someone – to stoke public interest on a wider scale. It could just happen this Saturday. If the USA Eagles defeat Uruguay in Atlanta, Georgia, they will qualify for next year's Rugby World Cup in England – in the same group as South Africa, Scotland, Samoa and Asia 1 (probably Japan), and kick-start all kinds of fresh star-spangled possibilities. The International Rugby Board believes American-based rugby supporters are already in the top three in terms of numbers when it comes to travelling abroad to watch Rugby World Cups. It does not require much imagination, should they make it to next year's tournament, to foresee Eagles fans enjoying themselves in Brighton before and after their potential opening pool game against Samoa, or relishing a trip to the Olympic Stadium, where they would be facing South Africa. Yes, the flat-earthers will say, but the Americans were stating this in the early 1990s and they are still nowhere near becoming a consistent international force. But steady on. In November, the Eagles defeated Georgia the week before their opponents beat the not inconsiderable might of Samoa. They should also have beaten an (admittedly weakened) Ireland last June and are already licking their lips at the prospect of Scotland's visit to Houston on 7 June. Admittedly, they only drew 27-27 with Uruguay in last week's first-leg qualifier, almost falling foul of their hosts' superior scrummaging muscle, but their European-based pros were still blinking away their jet lag. This week, with Northampton's Manoa, Leicester's Blaine Scully, Saracens' Chris Wyles et al able to enjoy a full week of preparation, they will fully expect to make home advantage pay. In the background, too, there is increasing private money being invested to try to strengthen the grassroots of American rugby, with some other interesting organisations doing their best to accelerate that process. Among them is Serevi Rugby, who count the former Rugby World Cup tournament manager Ross Young and the former England sevens international Ben Gollings as chief executive and lead coach respectively. Armed with corporate and private equity investment, Young and his group hope to fill the gaps that USA Rugby, presided over by the former England captain Nigel Melville, cannot always reach. \\"Until I came across I didn't realise rugby is as big as it is, especially around the smaller colleges in the US and in terms of the women's game,\\" Young says. \\"Our role is to drive awareness further, get kids involved from as young an age as possible and help provide a pathway through to national representation.\\" Representing the US at the Olympics is an obvious carrot but, stresses Young, there is also recognition that progress is not only about the top of the pyramid. \\"The long-term goal is to make rugby successful in the US. It took soccer a long while but they certainly have a strong foothold here now.\\" The thousands of Samoan and Tongan ex-pats in the Bay area of San Francisco where Manoa grew up offer obvious raw material; there is also a growing belief the spatial awareness of basketball players could make them even better rugby assets than more programmed gridiron linebackers or tightends. In the past few days, a New Zealand company, The Rugby Site, has sold its coaching modules to USA Rugby, which means any affiliated US coach can download tips from such names as Wayne Smith, Joe Schmidt and Richie McCaw to a mobile phone and instantly use them at training. The rugby world is changing fast. So, no pressure on the Eagles to get the job done in Atlanta this Saturday. \\"Rugby World Cup qualification is massively important,\\" Young says. \\"NBC showed the 2011 tournament on terrestrial television for the first time and there's talk about them doing more. They've put on Premiership games prior to Premier League football on a Saturday morning. Sport is hugely aspirational over here and success at national level is crucial.\\" It might take another two decades for the American dream to be realised fully but to insist it will never happen in a million years is the kind of nihilistic thinking rugby union needs to eradicate. No one could fail to wish Jonny Wilkinson all the best when he finally hangs up his boots – and kicking tees – at the end of the season. After all the injuries he has sustained, no modern player is more deserving of the luxury of picking his preferred time to go. The only faint alarm bells surround what precisely he will do next. He is brilliant with children and would make a brilliant Beckham-esque role model/ambassador but Leigh Halfpenny's kicking coach at Toulon? There are some superfluous jobs in the world and that would definitely be one of them. Leinster v Munster, Northampton v Leicester … who said the Six Nations has a monopoly on tribal passion? With our regular hutch-based expert suspended until May following allegations of possible irregular carrot consumption, this is a week for big statements from anyone with aspirations of Heineken Cup quarter-final glory next month. Few are more practised at refocusing at this time of year than Leinster and Leicester … and look out for Niki Goneva, the Tigers' winger, who is as dangerous with ball in hand as anyone in Europe. What are the most important parts of this text?","output":"Rugby union, a sport played with a ball where two teams try to score by running, passing, and kicking, is becoming more popular in the United States. This is because many American football and basketball players who won't play professionally in the NFL or NBA can use their skills in rugby instead. With more people and money supporting rugby in the US, it is possible that one day the American team could compete with the best teams in the world. The US rugby team's success could inspire more kids to start playing and grow the sport even more in the country."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Background Paragraph: The mechanism describing the formation of the ozone layer was described by British mathematician Sydney Chapman in 1930. Molecular oxygen absorbs high energy sunlight in the UV-C region, at wavelengths shorter than about 240 nm. Radicals produced from the homolytically split oxygen molecules combine with molecular oxygen to form ozone. Ozone in turn is photolysed much more rapidly than molecular oxygen as it has a stronger absorption that occurs at longer wavelengths, where the solar emission is more intense. Ozone (O3) photolysis produces O and O2. The oxygen atom product combines with atmospheric molecular oxygen to reform O3, releasing heat. The rapid photolysis and reformation of ozone heats the stratosphere resulting in a temperature inversion. This increase of temperature with altitude is characteristic of the stratosphere; its resistance to vertical mixing means that it is stratified. Within the stratosphere temperatures increase with  altitude (see temperature inversion); the top of the stratosphere has a temperature of about 270 K (−3°C or 26.6°F). This vertical stratification, with warmer layers above and cooler layers below, makes the stratosphere dynamically stable: there is no regular convection and associated turbulence in this part of the atmosphere. However, exceptionally energetic convection processes, such as volcanic eruption columns and overshooting tops in severe supercell thunderstorms, may carry convection into the stratosphere on a very local and temporary basis. Overall the attenuation of solar UV at wavelengths that damage DNA by the ozone layer allows life to exist on the surface of the planet outside of the ocean. All air entering the stratosphere must pass through the tropopause, the temperature minimum that divides the troposphere and stratosphere. The rising air is literally freeze dried; the stratosphere is a very dry place. The top of the stratosphere is called the stratopause, above which the temperature decreases with height.  Story: Barbara and Jane are two  students.  They both like meteorology. Barbara studies the formation of the ozone layer, while Jane studies about the stratosphere.  Question: Which student learned less about radicals produced from homolytically split oxygen molecules?","output":"Jane learned less about radicals produced from homolytically split oxygen molecules."},{"instruction":"Q: Q: The law of conservation mass states that matter cannot be created or what?

Please answer the following question: Q: What is the role of the sodium ion in the neutralization reaction of sodium flouride?    Choices:  - reflection ion  - circuit ion  - team ion  - spectator ion  A: Answer:","output":"The role of the sodium ion in the neutralization reaction of sodium fluoride is as a spectator ion. In a neutralization reaction, an acid and a base react to form a salt and water. Sodium fluoride is a salt formed from the reaction of a strong acid, hydrofluoric acid (HF), and a strong base, sodium hydroxide (NaOH). The reaction can be represented as: HF + NaOH → NaF + H2O In this reaction, the sodium ion (Na+) doesn't directly participate in the neutralization process. The actual neutralization occurs between the hydroxide ion (OH-) from the base and the hydrogen ion (H+) from the acid, forming water (H2O). The sodium ion (Na+) and the fluoride ion (F-) are paired together in the product, forming the salt sodium fluoride (NaF). Thus, the role of the sodium ion (Na+) in this reaction is that of a spectator ion, meaning it is present during the reaction but does not directly participate in the formation of the product.

In 1959 King got to know Sonny Thompson, a pianist, producer, and A&R man for Cincinnati's King Records. King's owner, Syd Nathan, signed King to the subsidiary Federal Records in 1960. King recorded his debut single for the label on August 26, 1960: \\"Have You Ever Loved a Woman\\" backed with \\"You've Got to Love Her with a Feeling\\" (again credited as \\"Freddy\\" King). From the same recording session at the King Studios in Cincinnati, Ohio, King cut the instrumental \\"Hide Away,\\" which the next year reached number 5 on the R&B chart and number 29 on the Pop chart, an unprecedented accomplishment for a blues instrumental at a time when the genre was still largely unknown to white audiences. It was originally released as the B-side of \\"I Love the Woman\\". \\"Hide Away\\" was King's melange of a theme by Hound Dog Taylor and parts by others, such as \\"The Walk\\", by Jimmy McCracklin, and \\"Peter Gunn\\", as credited by King. The title of the tune refers to Mel's Hide Away Lounge, a popular blues club on the West Side of Chicago. Willie Dixon later claimed that he had recorded King performing \\"Hide Away\\" for Cobra Records in the late 1950s, but such a version has never surfaced. \\"Hide Away\\" became a blues standard.

A study by Eric Steig published in 2009 noted for the first time that the continent-wide average surface temperature trend of Antarctica is slightly positive at >0.05 °C (0.09 °F) per decade from 1957 to 2006. This study also noted that West Antarctica has warmed by more than 0.1 °C (0.2 °F) per decade in the last 50 years, and this warming is strongest in winter and spring. This is partly offset by autumn cooling in East Antarctica. There is evidence from one study that Antarctica is warming as a result of human carbon dioxide emissions, but this remains ambiguous.

Instead the recent increases in glacier outflow are believed to be due to an inflow of warm water from the deep ocean, just off the continental shelf. The net contribution to sea level from the Antarctic Peninsula is more likely to be a direct result of the much greater atmospheric warming there.In 2002 the Antarctic Peninsula's Larsen-B ice shelf collapsed. Between 28 February and 8 March 2008, about 570 km2 (220 sq mi) of ice from the Wilkins Ice Shelf on the southwest part of the peninsula collapsed, putting the remaining 15,000 km2 (5,800 sq mi) of the ice shelf at risk. The ice was being held back by a \\"thread\\" of ice about 6 km (4 mi) wide, prior to its collapse on 5 April 2009. According to NASA, the most widespread Antarctic surface melting of the past 30 years occurred in 2005, when an area of ice comparable in size to California briefly melted and refroze; this may have resulted from temperatures rising to as high as 5 °C (41 °F).A study published in Nature Geoscience in 2013 (online in December 2012) identified central West Antarctica as one of the fastest-warming regions on Earth.

This is some data: Aleksey Chirikov (icebreaker), builder, Finland; Finland, demonym, Finns; Aleksey Chirikov (icebreaker), builder, Helsinki; Finland, leader, Sauli Niinistö. Generate a detailed description of this data","output":"The data provided offers significant information about the Aleksey Chirikov icebreaker, its construction, the country of Finland and its leader, Sauli Niinistö. Let's breakdown this information into a comprehensive and detailed description. 1. Aleksey Chirikov (icebreaker): Aleksey Chirikov is an icebreaker ship named after Aleksey Chirikov, the 18th-century Russian explorer who played a crucial role in mapping the Alaskan coast. Icebreakers are specialized vessels designed to navigate and break through ice-covered waters, enabling the movement of other vessels in frozen regions like the Arctic and Antarctic. The Aleksey Chirikov icebreaker specifically is built with reinforced hulls, powerful engines, and a unique hull shape, giving it the necessary force to break and push through thick ice. 2. Builder, Finland: The Aleksey Chirikov icebreaker was built in Finland, a Nordic country with a long history and experience in shipbuilding, particularly icebreakers. Finland is known for expertly blending advanced engineering and technology to create top-tier icebreakers, and their shipbuilding industry is highly acclaimed globally. Finnish icebreakers are sought after for their state-of-the-art designs and capabilities, making Finland a key player in the shipbuilding market. 3. Finland and its people: Finland, officially the Republic of Finland, is situated in Northern Europe, sharing borders with Sweden, Norway, and Russia. It's famous for its thousands of lakes, massive stretches of forests, and excellent education system. The people of Finland are called Finns, who are known for their hospitality, resilience, and strong cultural identity. The Finnish culture is rich, with historic influences from the East and West due to its geographical location. The country’s official languages are Finnish and Swedish, with a small minority speaking native languages like Sami and Romani. 4. Aleksey Chirikov (icebreaker), builder, Helsinki: The Aleksey Chirikov icebreaker was constructed in the city of Helsinki, Finland's capital, and largest city. Helsinki is located on the southern coast of Finland, and it's an economic and political hub with over 1.4 million inhabitants in the metropolitan area. The city is home to several major shipyards, green spaces, museums, and a thriving startup scene. Helsinki's location near the Baltic Sea has facilitated the growth of its maritime industry, and as a result, it has become a leading center for shipbuilding, including icebreakers like Aleksey Chirikov. 5. Leader, Sauli Niinistö: Sauli Väinämö Niinistö is the current leader and 12th President of Finland, serving since 2012. Niinistö is a seasoned Finnish politician and a member of the National Coalition Party. Prior to his presidency, he has held multiple political positions, such as the Deputy Prime Minister and Minister of Finance. As the President, Niinistö's responsibilities include overseeing foreign policy, representing Finland at the international level, and ensuring the country's stability and welfare. His presidency has been marked by a focus on economic growth, environmental conservation, and forging stronger ties with the European Union and NATO. Niinistö's role in governing Finland is crucial for maintaining its social, economic, and political balance and ensuring the country's continued growth and prosperity."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

The Bourne Ultimatum - Jason Bourne (Matt Damon in his best role ever), the newest spy kid on the block, brings his quest for his identity to a close as he also seeks to end the CIA's latest program \\"Blackbriar\\" to make super assassins like himself. I was so psyched for this one that I watched it's predecessors yesterday and today. Identity was as brilliant as I recall and Supremacy remains the weak (but still enjoyable) link in the chain for the weakest plot and, aside from a car chase which this film's chase easily tops, slight lacking in action and suspense. Hoo boy, does Ultimatum have suspense! Even when you know Bourne will escape the authorities (and boy do these films spotlight the police as inept), it's still brilliant watching him do it. It's mind-boggling to think that two guys with handguns and mopeds can create 10x more suspense than anything those 150 million giant robots did in Transformers. Chalk it up to Paul Greengrass, who has this idiosyncratic style of shooting stedicam a la documentary, even though he's filming characters that are far from ordinary, in places like CIA headquarters where no one within 10 miles would be allowed with a camcorder. He seemed to listen to my various complaints with Supremacy, as the action in Ultimatum is nothing less than awe-inspiring, with various implements used as weapons being a candlestick, a hardcover book (I'll never look at those the same way again) and an electric fan (Don't ask). The music also helped generate much suspense, and there was hardly ever a moment to not nail-bite over. The acting is good, and the evolution of Julia Stiles' character \\"Nicky\\" put her situation into a new highly sympathetic light. Damon plays his signature role with reserve but competency (which sounds minor but that it genuinely looks like Matt Damon could evade the CIA and Interpol is something), but noticeable moments of poignancy as he still struggles to find his humanity. This longing of his for a real life could get boring, and almost did in Supremacy, but just works better in Ultimatum (better script).  I am reminded of a scene in \\"Goldeneye\\" (the only good Pierce Brosnan Bond film) in which Sean Bean's character asks James if the martinis ever silence the screams of all the men he's killed. Bourne regrets all the people he killed, and he considers (or at least made me consider) the meaning of action without purpose, life without meaning, and how the government has transformed men into resources. Albeit, resources that know Krav Maga and can make weapons out of anything. Sidenote: it's always bothered me that, despite being a superspy and hunted by the CIA, Interpol, and the police nearly ANYWHERE he goes, that Bourne never thought to make even the smallest attempts to disguise his features or forge some new passports. Sunglasses maybe?  If you have a pulse and love action movies, than Bourne Ultimatum is for you. Hell, it's probably the best action film to come out this year. Of course, you'd be a fool to see it without watching the others first. It kind of drags a touch near the end, but I almost feel tempted to overlook that. This is the first \\"3\\" movie this summer to at least match, if not exceed, the original and that is saying something. A- How would you describe the sentiment of this review?","output":"The sentiment of this review is highly positive and enthusiastic.

Q:Information:  - \`\` Der gute Kamerad '' ( \`\` The good Comrade '' ) , also known by its incipit as Ich hatt ' einen Kameraden ( \`\` I had a comrade '' ) is a traditional lament of the German Armed Forces . The text was written by German poet Ludwig Uhland in 1809 . Its immediate inspiration was the deployment of Badener troops against the Tyrolean Rebellion . In 1825 , the composer Friedrich Silcher set it to music , based on the tune of a Swiss folk song . The song is about the immediate experience of a soldier losing a comrade in battle , detached from all political or national ideology ; as a result , its use was never limited to one particular faction and was sung or cited by representatives of all political backgrounds throughout the 19th and 20th centuries , and was translated for use in numerous fighting forces , French , Dutch , Spanish , Japanese and others . \`\` The Good Comrade '' still plays an important ceremonial role in the German Armed Forces and is an integral part of a military funeral , continuing a tradition started at some point around 1871 . The song has also become traditional in obsequies of the Military of Austria , the Austrian firebrigades and the highly prussianized Chilean Army . It is also used to some degree in the French Army , particularly in the Foreign Legion . When the song is played , soldiers are to salute , an honour otherwise reserved for national anthems only . Occasionally the song is played at civil ceremonies , most often when the deceased had been affiliated with the military . It is also commonly sung at the funerals of members of a Studentenverbindung . Finally , the song is often played on Volkstrauertag , the German Remembrance Day , at memorials for the fallen . The above text is Uhland 's original version . Various variants have been recorded over the years . Heyman Steinthal in an 1880 article in Zeitschrift für Völkerpsychologie noted a variant he heard sung by a housemaid , Die Kugel kam geflogen / Gilt sie mir ? Gilt sie dir ? ( i.e. \`\` the bullet came flying '' instead of...  - Grief is a multifaceted response to loss, particularly to the loss of someone or something that has died, to which a bond or affection was formed. Although conventionally focused on the emotional response to loss, it also has physical, cognitive, behavioral, social, cultural, and philosophical dimensions. While the terms are often used interchangeably, \\"bereavement\\" refers to the state of loss, and \\"grief\\" is the reaction to that loss.  - Mourning is, in the simplest sense, grief over someone's death. The word is also used to describe a cultural complex of behaviours in which the bereaved participate or are expected to participate. Customs vary between cultures and evolve over time, though many core behaviors remain constant.  - A song, most broadly, is a single (and often standalone) work of music that is typically intended to be sung by the human voice with distinct and fixed pitches and patterns using sound and silence and a variety of forms that often include the repetition of sections. Written words created specifically for music or for which music is specifically created, are called lyrics. If a pre-existing poem is set to composed music in classical music it is an art song. Songs that are sung on repeated pitches without distinct contours and patterns that rise and fall are called chants. Songs in a simple style that are learned informally are often referred to as folk songs. Songs that are composed for professional singers who sell their recordings or live shows to the mass market are called popular songs. These songs, which have broad appeal, are often composed by professional songwriters, composers and lyricists. Art songs are composed by trained classical composers for concert or recital performances. Songs are performed live and recorded on audio or video (or in some, cases, a song may be performed live and simultaneously recorded). Songs may also appear in plays, musical theatre, stage shows of any form, and within operas.  - Music is an art form and cultural activity whose medium is sound and silence, which exist in time. The common elements of music are pitch (which governs melody and harmony), rhythm (and its associated concepts tempo, meter, and articulation), dynamics (loudness and softness), and the sonic qualities of timbre and texture (which are sometimes termed the \\"color\\" of a musical sound). Different styles or types of music may emphasize, de-emphasize or omit some of these elements. Music is performed with a vast range of instruments and vocal techniques ranging from singing to rapping; there are solely instrumental pieces, solely vocal pieces (such as songs without instrumental accompaniment) and pieces that combine singing and instruments. The word derives from Greek  (\\"mousike\\"; \\"art of the Muses\\"). In its most general form, the activities describing music as an art form include the production of works of music (songs, tunes, symphonies, and so on), the criticism of music, the study of the history of music, and the aesthetic examination of music. Ancient Greek and Indian philosophers defined music as tones ordered horizontally as melodies and vertically as harmonies. Common sayings such as \\"the harmony of the spheres\\" and \\"it is music to my ears\\" point to the notion that music is often ordered and pleasant to listen to. However, 20th-century composer John Cage thought that any sound can be music, saying, for example, \\"There is no noise, only sound.\\"  - A poet is a person who writes poetry. Poets may describe themselves as such or be described as such by others. A poet may simply be a writer of poetry, or may perform their art to an audience.  - Crying is the shedding of tears in response to an emotional state. The act of crying has been defined as \\"a complex secretomotor phenomenon characterized by the shedding of tears from the lacrimal apparatus, without any irritation of the ocular structures\\". A related medical term is lacrimation, which also refers to non-emotional shedding of tears. Crying is also known as \\"weeping\\", \\"wailing\\", \\"whimpering\\", and \\"bawling\\".  - A lament or lamentation is a passionate expression of grief, often in music, poetry, or song form. The grief is most often born of regret, or mourning. Laments can also be expressed in a verbal manner, where the participant would lament about something they regret or someone they've lost, usually accompanied by wailing, moaning and/or crying. Laments constitute some of the oldest forms of writing and examples are present across human cultures.   - Johann Ludwig Uhland (26 April 1787  13 November 1862), was a German poet, philologist and literary historian.  - Poetry (the term derives from a variant of the Greek term, \\"poiesis\\", \\"making\\") is a form of literature that uses aesthetic and rhythmic qualities of languagesuch as phonaesthetics, sound symbolism, and metreto evoke meanings in addition to, or in place of, the prosaic ostensible meaning.

Her brother comes to her defense but is killed. Barbara flees the cemetery and discovers what at first seems to be an abandoned farmhouse. She seeks shelter there, only to find another pack of zombies. Shortly after, a man named Ben arrives, and the two clear the house of the dead and begin the process of barricading the doors and windows. They discover other survivors who have been hiding in the cellar of the house: Harry Cooper, a loud and argumentative husband; his wife Helen; their daughter Sarah, who was bitten by a zombie and has fallen seriously ill; teenager Tom Bitner and his girlfriend Judy Rose Larson. The group is divided over what their next course of action should be. Harry believes everyone should retreat to the cellar and barricade the door to wait for the authorities. Ben thinks the cellar is a \\"death trap\\" and that they would be better served fortifying the house, which at least has alternate escape routes, and Barbara suggests that the group should simply leave the house on foot after she notices the zombies' limited mobility. An argument between Ben and Harry leaves the Coopers in the basement to tend to their ailing daughter, and the remaining members remain upstairs to continue their work reinforcing the doors and windows. The loud construction attracts even more zombies to the farmhouse, soon collecting a large mob.

The Afghan Hound is a highly distinctive breed, set apart by its thick, fine, and silky coat, as well as its tail, which features a ring curl at the end. This breed was selectively bred for these unique qualities that have not only made it an admired and sought-after breed but also allowed the dogs to survive and thrive in their native environment. The Afghan Hound traces its origins back to the cold mountains of Afghanistan. The country's harsh and rugged terrain, often marked by frigid temperatures, necessitated the development of specific physical characteristics in these dogs. For instance, their thick and silky coat serves as insulation, protecting them from the cold and allowing them to stay warm even in the elevated and mountainous regions of Afghanistan. Simultaneously, the coat's length and texture offer an effective camouflage, enabling the Afghan Hounds to blend into their surroundings while hunting. The origin of the Afghan Hound is believed to date back thousands of years, making it one of the most ancient dog breeds in existence. These dogs were bred primarily for their hunting prowess, speed, and agility. The breed's ability to navigate the challenging topography and elevation of its native Afghan mountains, along with its keen sense of sight, made it a valuable hunting companion. The Afghan Hounds were originally used for hunting large animals such as gazelles, hares, and even leopards in the region. As time progressed, the Afghan Hound transcended its role as a hunting dog in Afghanistan and became symbolic of class and nobility. Esteemed Afghan tribes and upper-class families took great pride in possessing these proficient, elegant, and regal canines. Moreover, the Afghan Hound gained popularity worldwide, particularly among dog enthusiasts and breeders who admired its striking appearance and unique qualities. In conclusion, Viscount Grant, also known as Gable, who won the Best In Show title at the Crufts dog show in 1987, belonged to the Afghan Hound breed, originally developed in the cold mountains of Afghanistan. These impressively agile and resilient dogs were selectively bred for their distinctive traits, such as their fine, silky, temperature-regulating coat and curled tail, which facilitated their survival and performance in their harsh native environment. The prestigious history and characteristics of the Afghan Hound breed have ensured its continued popularity and admiration in the dog world."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

The government's consultation on the proposals closes on Monday. And the Department for Education has indicated that it makes \\"no apology\\" for wanting to ensure children are properly protected. David Cameron has warned that \\"teaching intolerance\\" had to be stopped. But in a response, the mosque leaders say the plans are based on \\"the flawed assumption that radicalisation takes place within some madrassas\\" and that such \\"control and monitoring\\" over lessons would \\"effectively lead to a form of state sanctioned religious expression\\".

He claimed that in some madrassas, children were \\"having their heads filled with poison and their hearts filled with hate\\". This was followed by plans from the Department for Education for the compulsory registration of out-of-school places of education, such as madrassas, which currently operate outside of the oversight of the authorities. It would give inspectors powers to ensure that children were \\"properly safeguarded\\" and would allow sanctions to be imposed, such as barring individuals from teaching or shutting down such centres where failings were found. As well as stopping \\"unsuitable staff\\" and \\"undesirable teaching\\" it would mean preventing corporal punishment. Such regulation would apply to places where children were regularly taught six to eight hours a week - and not to occasional or less frequent sessions. But the Northern Council of Mosques, with a membership in places such as Bradford, Manchester and Rochdale, says such an approach will be counter-productive and will \\"alienate\\" faith groups. The mosque group say that young people need to be able to debate ideas openly and \\"faith providers may simply avoid such open conversations with children for fear of being labelled extremists themselves\\". There are believed to be about 2,000 madrassas in the UK. They teach Muslim children subjects such as Arabic to recite the Koran and lessons in the principles and practices of their faith. A Department for Education spokesman said: \\"We recognise many out-of-school education settings do a great job in supporting children's education and development but, without proper oversight, there is a risk that some children attending them may be exposed to harm, including from extremism. \\"We want to hear the views of all interested parties about how settings which children attend intensively might be required to register so that they can be inspected in a way that does not place unnecessary burdens on good providers.\\" As well as extra scrutiny for part-time, out-of-school settings, Ofsted has called for illegal, unregistered schools to be shut down. Ofsted chief Sir Michael Wilshaw said inspectors had found \\"squalid\\" conditions in places teaching children for more than 20 hours a week, which were not registered or accountable to inspectors, local authorities or the Department for Education.","output":"The Northern Council of Mosques, which represents 400 mosques, has criticized plans by the UK government to regulate and inspect madrassas (Islamic religious schools) as an infringement on religious freedom. The Department for Education intends to introduce tighter scrutiny over \\"out-of-school education settings\\" in an effort to ensure children are properly protected and prevent the teaching of intolerance. However, mosque leaders argue that such control and monitoring would lead to state-sanctioned religious expression and unduly encroach on the right of faith providers to teach their faith. Furthermore, they claim that the term \\"extremism\\" is vaguely defined and potentially all-encompassing. The Northern Council of Mosques warns that the proposed regulations could alienate faith groups and discourage open conversations about ideas for fear of being labeled as extremists. The Department for Education maintains that the purpose of the proposed regulations is to protect children from potential harm, including from extremism, without placing unnecessary burdens on good education providers."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

If you want a movie that will keep you on the floor laughing, this is the perfect movie to get. From Cabot's wild-style mullet/sweater combo to Parmistan (and it's four billion assorted ninjas), everything about this film reeks of crap.

Translate this to English?","output":"To begin with, generally, the lessee (lease-purchaser) selects the equipment from the supplier (lease-seller). Allow me to provide an elaborative explanation of this statement: In the context of this statement, a lease agreement is being discussed. A lease agreement is a contract between two parties, the lessor (lease-seller) and the lessee (lease-purchaser), in which the lessor allows the lessee to use an asset (in this case, equipment) in exchange for periodic payments. The lessor retains ownership of the asset, while the lessee obtains the right to use it. In most lease agreement scenarios, the lessee (lease-purchaser) starts by choosing the equipment they need from the supplier (lease-seller). The supplier, who could be a manufacturer or a distributor of the required equipment, allows the lessee to use it in exchange for regular payments made over the agreed lease term. Selecting the equipment from the supplier is a crucial step for the lease-purchaser as it ensures that they choose the most suitable equipment to fulfill their business needs, preferences, or requirements. The type of equipment can vary from vehicles, machinery, and tools, to IT equipment like computers, telephones, and servers - depending on the lease-purchaser's industry and specific requirements. Once the equipment is selected, the lease-purchaser typically enters into a lease agreement with the lease-seller. This agreement outlines the specific terms and conditions, including the duration of the lease, the amount and frequency of payments, the responsibilities of both the lessor and lessee, and provisions for termination, renewal, or purchase at the end of the lease term. Moreover, it is essential for both the lease-purchaser and the lease-seller to clearly understand and communicate their respective obligations in the lease agreement. This will help prevent any potential misunderstandings, conflicts, or issues that may arise during the course of the lease term. In conclusion, the sentence \\"Pour commencer, généralement, le preneur à bail (loueur-acheteur) choisit le matériel chez le fournisseur (loueur-vendeur)\\" emphasizes the initial step in a lease agreement, where the lease-purchaser selects the desired equipment from the lease-seller or supplier before proceeding with the contractual agreement. This process ensures that both parties are aware of the equipment involved and can agree upon the terms and conditions of the lease."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant that follows instruction extremely well.

And the answer is?","output":"The Blue Lagoon is a popular cocktail that includes the alcoholic spirit vodka as its primary ingredient. The cocktail is known for its striking blue color, which is achieved by the combination of vodka, blue curaçao liqueur, and lemonade or lemon-lime soda. The blue curaçao is what gives the drink its unique color and adds a slightly sweet, orange flavor to the mix. The classic Blue Lagoon cocktail recipe typically consists of the following ingredients: 1. Vodka: Vodka serves as the base spirit for this cocktail, providing a clean and neutral flavor profile. Although any vodka brand will work, it is recommended to use a good-quality vodka for a smoother taste. The standard measurement is around 1 to 2 ounces (30 to 60 milliliters) of vodka per cocktail. 2. Blue Curaçao: This Caribbean liqueur is made from the dried peels of the Laraha citrus fruit, which is a close relative of the Valencia orange. Its distinctive blue color comes from food coloring, while its flavor is a blend of bitter orange and sweet citrus. You will need approximately 1 ounce (30 milliliters) of blue curaçao for a Blue Lagoon. 3. Lemonade or Lemon-Lime Soda: Both lemonade and lemon-lime soda work well as mixers in this cocktail, providing a tangy citrus note that complements the vodka and blue curaçao. Depending on your preference, you may opt for a still or sparkling lemonade. Alternatively, a lemon-lime soda such as Sprite or 7-Up can also be used for added fizz. About 4 ounces (120 milliliters) of the chosen mixer will give the right balance to the cocktail. 4. Optional Garnish: For a sophisticated presentation, you can garnish the Blue Lagoon with a lemon wheel, a slice of orange, or even a maraschino cherry. Adding a straw or a stirrer will enhance the overall look and make it easier to mix and enjoy the cocktail. To prepare a Blue Lagoon, follow these steps: 1. Fill a highball or Collins glass with ice cubes. 2. Add the vodka and blue curaçao to the glass. 3. Pour in the lemonade or lemon-lime soda, leaving enough space for the garnish. 4. Stir gently to combine the ingredients. 5. Add your desired garnish to the cocktail. 6. Serve immediately and enjoy. Since its creation, the Blue Lagoon has become a popular cocktail choice, especially during the summer months, thanks to its refreshing taste and vibrant appearance. You can also experiment with variations, such as replacing the vodka with gin or combining different liqueurs, to create your personalized version of the classic Blue Lagoon."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Step 2: Establish the setting and the characters' lives The movie is set in a bustling Indian metropolis where all three Laxminarayans live in different neighborhoods, unaware of each other's existence. The undergarments salesman works in a busy marketplace, the car salesman runs a successful showroom, and the wannabe gangster is in a street gang committing petty crimes. Each Laxminarayan has his own dreams and aspirations. Step 3: Introduce the inciting incident A wealthy businessman named Mr. Kapoor acquires a rare and valuable artifact that several criminal organizations want to obtain. To retrieve this artifact, they approach the three Laxminarayans, each believing them to be a different contact person due to name confusion. Step 4: Develop separate plotlines for each Laxminarayan The first Laxminarayan is mistaken for a well-connected criminal due to his knowledge of concealed undergarments used by criminals to hide weapons. The car salesman Laxminarayan crosses paths with a mob boss who asks him to help smuggle some cars containing hidden loot. Meanwhile, the wannabe gangster's street gang gets the opportunity of a lifetime when they're asked to pull off a heist, thanks to his new, yet mistaken reputation. Step 5: Merge the three plotlines into one The three Laxminarayans individually start getting entangled in various criminal schemes related to the artifact, and soon, their paths cross. One fateful night, all three Laxminarayans meet each other on the roof of a building while trying to retrieve the artifact for their respective clients. Step 6: Create conflict and climax In the climax, the three Laxminarayans realize that they've been mistaken for one another and decide to join forces to outwit the criminal organizations. As they devise a plan, they leverage their unique strengths and professions to concoct a scheme that has the various criminal organizations turning against each other. While the criminals are distracted, they manage to get their hands on the artifact and escape. Step 7: Tie up loose ends and conclude the story In the end, the three Laxminarayans decide to form a bond and become their own crime-busting team, leveraging their new skills and connections in the underworld. They give the artifact back to Mr. Kapoor and receive a sizable reward.

Firstly, the reviewer starts off by praising the restaurant, referring to it as \\"one of the best places to eat Asian food with a western twist.\\" This statement indicates that the reviewer appreciates the unique blend of cuisines offered by the establishment, which sets it apart from other Asian food options. The use of \\"best\\" denotes a high level of satisfaction and endorsement, contributing to the overall positive sentiment.  Another aspect of the review that supports the positive sentiment is the mention of the dish sizes. While the reviewer notes that the portion sizes are small, they do not present this as a negative factor. Instead, the contrast is made to \\"all you can eat\\" dining experiences, suggesting that the restaurant's smaller, more satisfying portions are distinctive and worth the visit.  The comment on the prices only mildly detracts from the overall positive sentiment; the reviewer describes the prices as \\"OK\\" and within an acceptable range for the dining experience. The use of the phrase \\"very bite is special\\" serves to balance the sentiment about the price, as it conveys the idea that the quality and the culinary experience provided by the restaurant justify the cost per person. Finally, the fact that the reviewer is leaning towards a positive sentiment as their choice further reinforces that the overall sentiment of the review is positive. They are essentially stating that despite the caveats mentioned, they still appreciate the dining experience and would likely recommend the restaurant to others."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Step 2: Extract relevant information from the context - Review the context provided and pinpoint the essential information. Here, it mentions Willett's 1907 proposal used the term daylight saving, and later term summer time replaced daylight saving time. Additionally, it explains that in Italy, the term ora legale, which translates to legal time, is used in place of the term daylight saving or summer time. Step 3: Identify the correct answer based on context - As the context mentioned that William Willett was the person who came up with the idea for daylight saving time and the subsequent adoption of the term 'summer time' (which led to the term 'legal time' in Italy), William Willett can be identified as the person who made the original term for what is now called legal time."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

OPTIONS: + World. + Sports. + Business. + Science/Tech.","output":"This topic is about: + Business. The information given revolves around the financial market and macroeconomic aspects, specifically related to U.S. Treasury debt prices and oil prices. The impacts of oil prices on the economy and monetary policy fall under the business news category, which covers finance, the market, and its corresponding consequences on the global economy. The news article mentioned above highlights the relationship between oil prices and the U.S. Treasury debt prices. Investors are taking into account the potential side effects of near-record high oil prices on the economy. The higher the price of oil, the higher the cost of production and transportation, which might slow economic growth. This could affect businesses' ability to generate profits, repay loans, and create new employment opportunities. High oil prices also result in higher inflation which impacts consumer purchasing power and indirectly affects the overall economy. In response to these concerns, investors are likely to divert their investments from riskier assets to the relatively safer and less volatile U.S. Treasury debt securities, in anticipation of stalled monetary tightening. Monetary tightening occurs when central banks raise interest rates or adopt other strategies to reduce money supply in order to control inflation. When the economy is slowed down, central banks may refrain from tightening monetary policy to support economic growth. In this context, the relationship between oil prices and U.S. Treasury debt prices can be considered a vital topic under business news. The effects of such market activities influence investment decisions and monetary policies, and help paint a clear picture of how different aspects of the financial market and the economy are interconnected."},{"instruction":"You are a teacher.

Within the series' narrative, William was an unsuccessful aspiring poet in the Victorian era who was mocked and called \`\`William the Bloody'' because of his \`\`bloody awful'' poetry. Sired by the vampire Drusilla (Juliet Landau), William became an unusually passionate and romantic vampire, being very violent and ready to battle, but not as cruel as his companions. Alongside Drusilla, Darla (Julie Benz) and Angelus (David Boreanaz), Giles thinks William acquired the nickname Spike for his preferred method of torturing people with railroad spikes, but it is revealed it is because his poetry was \`\`so bad you could stick a railroad spike through your head.'' He was noted for killing two vampire Slayers; one in China at the end of the 1800s during the Boxer Rebellion, the other was Nicki Wood in 1977 New York, where Spike acquired his trademark leather duster.

Any unused energy in food—whether it comes from carbohydrates, proteins, or lipids—is stored in the body as fat. An extra 3,500 Calories of energy results in the storage of almost half a kilogram (1 pound) of stored body fat. People who consistently consume more food energy then they need may become obese. Obesity occurs when the body mass index is 30.0 kg/m 2 or greater. Body mass index (BMI) is an estimate of the fat content of the body. It is calculated by dividing a person’s weight (in kilograms) by the square of the person’s height (in meters). Obesity increases the risk of health problems such as type 2 diabetes and hypertension.  Two groups of adults were a part of a diet experiment. Group Brown ate 3500 extra calories a day for 3 months, while group Yellow, had a normal diet. Group Brown gained a lot of weight.  Which group has a smaller chance of getting a BMI above 30.0? Answer:","output":"Group Yellow has a smaller chance of getting a BMI above 30.0. Step 1: Understand the problem - The problem states that Group Brown ate 3500 extra calories a day for 3 months and gained a lot of weight. - Group Yellow had a normal diet. - Obesity occurs when the BMI is 30.0 kg/m2 or greater. Step 2: Determine the relationship between calories and BMI  - A surplus of 3,500 Calories of energy results in the storage of almost half a kilogram (1 pound) of stored body fat.  - Increased body fat can contribute to a higher BMI. Step 3: Analyze the dietary habits of each group - Group Brown consumed a significant amount of extra calories daily, leading to increased body fat and a higher likelihood of reaching or exceeding a BMI of 30.0. - Group Yellow had a normal diet, so they are less likely to have an excessive calorie intake that would lead to increased body fat and a BMI greater than 30.0. Conclusion: Based on their dietary habits, Group Yellow has a smaller chance of getting a BMI above 30.0 compared to Group Brown."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Franco-Prussian War The Germans expected to negotiate an end to the war but immediately ordered an advance on Paris; by 15 September Moltke issued the orders for an investment of Paris and on 20 September the encirclement was complete. Bismarck met Favre on 18 September at the Château de Ferrières and demanded a frontier immune to a French war of revenge, which included Strasbourg, Alsace and most the Moselle department in Lorraine of which Metz was the capital. In return for an armistice for the French to elect a National Assembly, Bismarck demanded the surrender of Strasbourg and the fortress city of Toul. To allow supplies into Paris, one of the perimeter forts had to be handed over. Favre was unaware that the real aim of Bismarck in making such extortionate demands was to establish a durable peace on the new western frontier of Germany, preferably by a peace with a friendly government, on terms acceptable to French public opinion. An impregnable military frontier was an inferior alternative to him, favoured only by the militant nationalists on the German side.

Growth in the Russian Empire's power, threatening the Kingdom of Prussia and the Habsburg Austrian Empire, was the primary motive behind this first partition. Frederick the Great engineered the partition to prevent Austria, jealous of Russian successes against the Ottoman Empire, from going to war. The weakened Commonwealth's land, including what was already controlled by Russia, was apportioned among its more powerful neighborsAustria, Russia and Prussiaso as to restore the regional balance of power in Central Europe among those three countries.

This is because eating too much junk food, like chips, candy, and soda, is not healthy for kids.

She was selected in the second round of the 2012 WNBA Draft ( 20th overall ) by the Minnesota Lynx . Are these two sentences paraphrases of each other?","output":"Yes, these two sentences are paraphrases of each other. They both convey the same information, which is that the individual being referred to was drafted in the second round of the 2012 WNBA draft as the 20th overall pick by the Minnesota Lynx.  Paraphrasing is the act of expressing the same idea or concept using different words, phrases, or sentence structures, while maintaining the original meaning. In this case, both sentences convey the same idea but are expressed slightly differently: 1. \\"It was selected in the second round of the WNBA draft 2012 (20th overall) by Minnesota Lynx.\\" 2. \\"She was selected in the second round of the 2012 WNBA Draft (20th overall) by the Minnesota Lynx.\\" The differences between the sentences include: a) The use of the pronoun \\"It\\" in the first sentence, as opposed to \\"She\\" in the second sentence. Though both pronouns refer to the same individual, \\"She\\" makes it clear that the individual is a woman, which fits appropriately in the context of the WNBA. b) The placement of the year \\"2012\\" in the first sentence comes after the phrase \\"WNBA draft,\\" while in the second sentence it is placed before \\"WNBA Draft.\\" This is a minor variation in the structure of the sentence but does not change the meaning. c) Lastly, capitalization slightly differs between the two sentences where \\"WNBA Draft\\" is capitalized in the second sentence, while in the first sentence \\"draft\\" is not capitalized. Again, this difference is minimal and does not alter the meaning of the sentence. Despite these small differences, the core information in both sentences is identical, indicating that they are paraphrases of each other."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant, who knows every language and how to translate one language to another.

Answer based on context: The Colts began three straight home games in Week 8 with an interconference duel against the San Francisco 49ers.  Indianapolis would find themselves trailing in the first quarter as 49ers running back Frank Gore got a 64-yard touchdown run.  The Colts answered with kicker Matt Stover getting a 38-yard field goal.  In the second quarter, Indianapolis crept closer as Stover made a 33-yard field goal, yet San Francisco answered with quarterback Alex Smith completing an eight-yard touchdown pass to tight end Vernon Davis.  The Colts closed out the half with a 31-yard field goal from Stover. In the second half, Indianapolis narrowed San Francisco's lead to two as Stover booted a 40-yard field goal. In the fourth quarter, they executed a halfback option play as running back Joseph Addai's threw a 22-yard touchdown pass to wide receiver Reggie Wayne. Afterwards, the defense held off against the various comeback attempts from the 49ers. With the win, the Colts improved to 7-0 for the fourth time in five seasons and they set a franchise record with 15 consecutive regular season wins. Also, quarterback Peyton Manning (31/48 for 347 yards) joined Dan Marino, Brett Favre, and John Elway as the only players in NFL history to complete 4,000 career passes.  In addition, he became the fastest to reach the milestone as he reached it in 183 games.

Please briefly summarize this news article: East Falls Church broken rail problem fixed on Metro Metro said trains are no longer sharing a track after an earlier problem with a broken rail that affected the Orange and Silver lines. Riders should expect residual delays in both directions. The broken rail was outside the East Falls Church stop. There was also a report of delays in both directions on the Green and Yellow lines because of a medical emergency at the Fort Totten stop. Trains are sharing a track between the Georgia Avenue and Fort Totten stops. Metro said it expects to have the broken rail near the East Falls Church station fixed by noon Tuesday. The broken rail caused some delays in the snowy morning commute. Crews were on the scene and working to install “splice bars,” according to Metro spokesman Dan Stessel. Once that piece is installed, he said, test trains will be run through the area and normal service will resume at that point. Trains are sharing a track through the East Falls Church stop on the Orange and Silver lines as a result of the problem. Stessel said the broken rail is likely weather-related. At times, rails crack when outside temperatures fluctuate from warm to very cold. Metro said trains continue to share a track through the East Falls Church stop on the Orange and Silver lines. There is a broken rail outside the East Falls Church station. Delays are in both directions. Dan Stessel, a Metro spokesman, said the delays should be relatively short and last about 20 minutes.

Think like you are answering to a five year old. Which entity is this text about? Jason Gilbert Giambi (; born January 8, 1971) is an American former professional baseball first baseman and designated hitter. In his Major League Baseball (MLB) career, which began in 1995, he played for the Oakland Athletics, New York Yankees, Colorado Rockies and Cleveland Indians. Giambi was the American League MVP in 2000 while with the Athletics, and is a five-time All-Star who led the American League in walks four times, in on-base percentage three times, and in doubles and in slugging percentage once each, and won the Silver Slugger Award twice. Giambi has publicly apologized for using performance-enhancing drugs during his career. Late in 2003, Giambi was named by FBI officers investigating the Bay Area Laboratory Co-operative (BALCO) as being one of the baseball players believed to have received anabolic steroids from trainer Greg Anderson.  In December 2004, the San Francisco Chronicle reported it had seen Giambi's 2003 grand jury testimony in the BALCO investigation. The newspaper said that in his testimony, Giambi admitted to using several different steroids during the off-seasons from 2001 to 2003, and injecting himself with human growth hormone during the 2003 season. In a press conference prior to the 2005 season, Giambi apologized publicly to the media and his fans, though he did not specifically state what for. The lawyer who illegally leaked the testimony later pleaded guilty, and was sentenced to 2 and a half years in prison.  Giambi apologized again on May 16, 2007, this time specifically for using steroids, and urged others in the sport to do the same. \\"I was wrong for using that stuff\\", he told USA Today. \\"What we should have done a long time ago was stand up--players, ownership, everybody--and said, 'We made a mistake.'\\" When asked why he used steroids, Giambi responded: \\"Maybe one day I'll talk about it, but not now.\\" Giambi did speak with George J. Mitchell, after being forced to do so by Bud Selig. Subsequently, in December 2007, the Mitchell Report included Giambi along with his brother Jeremy Giambi, who also admitted to using steroids during his career.  The prosecution in the Barry Bonds perjury case indicated they intended to call both Jason and Jeremy Giambi to testify against Bonds in his March 2009 trial.","output":"This text is about Jason Gilbert Giambi, a former professional baseball player who played in Major League Baseball (MLB) for teams like Oakland Athletics, New York Yankees, Colorado Rockies, and Cleveland Indians.

We characterized the single-stranded DNA (ssDNA)-binding properties of Pseudomonas aeruginosa PAO1 SSB (PaSSB) by using fluorescence quenching measurements and electrophoretic mobility shift analysis (EMSA). Analysis of purified PaSSB by gel filtration chromatography revealed a stable tetramer in solution. In fluorescence titrations, PaSSB bound 22-32 nucleotides (nt) per tetramer depending on salt concentration. Using EMSA, we characterized the stoichiometry of PaSSB complexed with a series of ssDNA homopolymers, and the size of the binding site was determined to be 29 ± 1 nt. Furthermore, EMSA results indicated that the dissociation constants of PaSSB for the first tetramer were less than those for the second tetramer. On the basis of these biophysical analyses, the ssDNA binding mode of PaSSB is expected to be noncooperative.

This film was the first British teen movie to actually address the reality of the violent rock and roll society, rather than being a lucid parody of 1950s teenage life. In an attempt to celebrate the work of Liverpool's Junior Liaison Officers the opening title points out that 92% of potential delinquents, who have been dealt with under this scheme, have not committed a second crime. However, this becomes merely a pretext to the following teen-drama until the film's epilogue where we are instructed that we shouldn't feel responsible or sorry for such delinquents however mixed-up they might seem. Stanley Baker plays a tough detective who reluctantly takes on the post of Juvenile Liaison Officer. This hard-boiled character is a role typical of Baker. Having been currently on the trail of a notorious arsonist known as the firefly and does not relish the distraction of the transfer. However, as in all good police dramas he is led back full circle by a remarkable turn of events, back to his original investigation. His first case leads him to the home of two young children, Mary and Patrick Murphy (played by real-life brother and sister duo), who have committed a petty theft. Here he meets Cathie (satisfyingly portrayed by Anne Heywood) their older sister whom he eventually becomes romantically involved with. It quickly becomes obvious that the squalid environment of such inner-city estates is a breeding ground for juvenile delinquency. The elder brother of the Murphy family, Johnny, is the leader of a gang of rock and roll hoodlums. McCallum does an eye-catching turn as the Americanized mixed-up kid, who owes more to the likes of Marlon Brando, than any previous British star. One is reminded of Brando's character Johnny from 'The Wild One' who led a leather-clad gang of rebellious bikers in much the same way as this film's 'Johnny' leads his gang. Thankfully the preachiness of earlier Dearden crime dramas such as 'The Blue Lamp' is not so apparent. Instead we are presented with several well drawn-out characters on both sides of the law as the drama of the delinquents and the romantic interest between Heywood and Baker takes the forefront. The plot, whilst at times predictable, does deliver some memorable scenes. The disruptive influence that rock and roll music was thought to have had is played out in a scene where Johnny abandons himself to the music, leading a menacing advance on the police sergeant. The most grippingly memorable piece of film however is the climatic classroom scene where a bunch of terrified school children, including Mary and Patrick, are held hostage at gunpoint by Johnny. Obviously in the light of the real-life Dumblaine Massacre this scene seems all the horrifying. Understandably because of this the film is seldom aired or available to modern audiences.

Researchers have since cloned cats, goats, cows, mice, pigs, rabbits, horses, deer, mules and gaur, a large wild ox of Southeast Asia. So far, efforts to clone a monkey or another primate with the same techniques have failed.  Uncertainties about the health and life span   of cloned animals continue to exsist; Dolly died at a young age in 2003 after developing cancer and arthritis.  Wilmut and others  _ Hwang's achievement, reported Wednesday in the journal Nature. But they said politicians and scientists must face the larger issue -- how to go on with the research without crossing the moral boundary of copying human life in the lab. \\"The ability to use the technology is hopeful,\\" said Robert Schenken, president of the American Society for Reproductive Medicine. \\"However, the paper also points out that in dogs as in most species, cloning for reproductive purposes is unsafe.\\"  The cloned puppy was the lone success from more than 100 dogs implanted  with more than 1,000 cloned embryos.  In a news conference in Seoul, the cloning team also condemned the reproductive cloning of humans as \\"unsafe and inefficient.\\" Human reproductive cloning already is banned in South Korea. Other nations, including the United States, are divided on whether to ban just human cloning or cloning of all kinds, including the production of stem cells.

Researchers from the National Park Service collected more than 1.5million hours of acoustical monitoring data from around the country and found that the quietest areas were in national parks. The team found sound levels that are as quiet as before European colonization in some wild places of the country, according to Science. Scientists from the National Park Service used a computer program to map the noise levels throughout the entire country. This map shows the combined decibel levels from both natural and human-made noise, which ranged from below 30 decibels to above 60. National parks, such as Yellowstone in Wyoming, Idaho and Montana, were the quietest places in the entire country, with low levels of human noise. While the most peaceful places saw less than 20 decibels of background noise on a typical summer day, places such as New York City can average up to 60 decibels. The map shows a stark difference between the noisy eastern half of the country and the West, where large swaths of land see measurements below 30 decibels. Noise is measured logarithmically in decibels, with a jet engine  around 100 decibels, an office environment measured at about 60 and a whisper at 20. The quietest places in the US are found at the Rockies and westward, with secluded areas such as Yellowstone National Park in Wyoming and Great Sand Dunes National Park in Colorado leading the way. Haleakalā National Park in Hawaii was also among the quietest, lead author Dr Daniel Mennitt told Daily Mail Online. Urban environments and towns along the interstate system got the noisiest ratings, according to maps from a study by  Dr Mennitt, Dr Ken Fristrup and Dr Lisa Nelson. Researchers have previously pointed out how long-term exposure to loud background noise can cause health problems. Dr Fristrup has said that constant noise may be creating a 'deaf generation' that is unable to use our bodies' ability to hear sounds far away. The researchers also made a map of the country's noise if humans were taken out of the equation (above). Large amounts of natural noise, which was mapped on a smaller scale than the total noise, was found in areas with rivers and insects, such as the Southeast. The naturally noisiest parts of the country include the area around the Mississippi River (pictured) while naturally quiet places were generally high,dry shrubland. However, the difference between the bustling East and the more peaceful West was not only limited to areas with large amounts of human development. A map of sounds created by natural sources, where scientists redid the map as if there were no people, also shows a country split in half. Warm areas in the Southeast and interior Midwest saw high values and appear in yellow, though the scale for the amount of noise is smaller than for when human sounds are included. Non-human noise came mostly from running water, rain and 'wind-induced vegetation sounds'. The wetlands and area around the Mississippi River also support a huge amount of wildlife and the constant buzz of insects can be heard even in areas with few or no people. Humans' contribution to the noise levels were mapped by subtracting the natural levels from the soundscape (seen above). Even areas without large human populations saw man-made noise from roads and airplanes flying overhead. Big cities such as New York (pictured) can see background noise levels as high as 60 decibels, roughly the same as an office environment or a conversation in a restaurant. The quietest places in terms of natural sounds were high, dry shrubland and barren, flat terrain'. Dr Mennitt and his team then measured the affect that humans have on the soundscape by finding the difference between the total noise and natural noise levels. Even remote spots saw some man-made noise, with the rumble of aircraft overheard destroying the natural stillness. Other patches of would-be quiet were also broken up by roads or other transportation networks. One aircraft can be heard 25 miles from from its path and cars can be heard six miles from the road, the study said. The largest areas without large amounts of unnatural noise were the Adirondacks in northern New York state and parts of the Rocky Mountains. Half of 'low impact' areas were in protected lands. The scientists were unable to collect data from every point in the entire country, and used Random Forest, a 'tree-based machine learning algorithm' to create their maps. Though the researchers originally began looking just at the country's national parks, their more recent research has included data from urban areas and airports. The noise study's combined map bears a striking resemblance to NASA's map of nighttime light, with much of the activity clustered around humans in big cities.","output":"Scientists have found the quietest places in America by studying noise levels throughout the country. They discovered that national parks are the most peaceful areas, with low levels of human noise. Some of the quietest spots include Yellowstone National Park in Wyoming and Great Sand Dunes National Park in Colorado. The map shows that the eastern half of the country is noisier than the west, where many areas have noise levels below 30 decibels. Loud noise can cause health problems, and researchers are concerned that constant noise might be creating a \\"deaf generation\\" that can't hear far away sounds well."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Is the premise \\"A man holding a small child who is wearing a backpack.\\" true if \\"The backpack is filled with food.\\"?","output":"The statement \\"A man holding a small child who is wearing a backpack\\" describes a scenario where there is an adult male carrying a young child with a backpack on their back. However, this statement by itself does not provide any information about the contents of the backpack, as it simply describes the physical scenario of a man, a child, and a backpack. Now, let's consider the additional piece of information you provided: \\"The backpack is filled with food.\\" This statement clarifies what is inside the backpack, and now we know that the contents of the backpack are food items. With this additional information, we can analyze and determine the accuracy of the entire premise. The premise \\"A man holding a small child who is wearing a backpack\\" is still true, as it accurately describes the scenario. The presence of food in the backpack does not negate or contradict this statement in any way. In fact, the additional context from the second statement serves to provide more detail about the situation. However, if you'd like to create a more comprehensive and inclusive statement that reflects the additional information, you could say: \\"A man is holding a small child who is wearing a backpack filled with food.\\" This new statement provides a clearer and more complete picture of the situation at hand, ensuring the accurate representation of all the known variables. It captures not only the presence of the man, the child, and the backpack but also the contents of the backpack, which is food. In conclusion, the premise \\"A man holding a small child who is wearing a backpack\\" is true regardless of whether or not the backpack contains food, and the presence of food does not change the validity of this statement. The fact that the backpack is filled with food adds an extra layer of detail to the scenario, painting a more vivid picture of the circumstance."},{"instruction":"Please answer the following question: Suggest a movie title for the following movie plot: In the American Old West of 1874, construction on a new railroad will soon be going through Rock Ridge, a frontier town inhabited exclusively by white people with the surname Johnson. The conniving State Attorney General Hedley Lamarr (Harvey Korman) wants to force Rock Ridge's residents to abandon their town, thereby lowering land prices. After he sends a gang of thugs, led by his flunky assistant Taggart (Slim Pickens), to shoot the sheriff and harass the townspeople, the townspeople demand that Governor William J. Le Petomane (Mel Brooks) appoint a new sheriff to protect them. Lamarr persuades the dim-witted Le Petomane to appoint Bart (Cleavon Little), a black railroad worker who was about to be hanged. A black sheriff, he reasons, will offend the townspeople, create chaos, and leave the town at his mercy. With his quick wits and the assistance of recovering alcoholic gunslinger Jim, the Waco Kid (Gene Wilder), Bart works to overcome the townspeople's hostile reception. He subdues and befriends Mongo (Alex Karras), an immensely strong, slow-thinking, but surprisingly philosophical henchman sent to kill him, and then beats German seductress-for-hire Lili von Shtupp (Madeline Kahn) at her own game. Lamarr, furious that his schemes have backfired, hatches a larger plan involving a recruited army of thugs, including common criminals, Ku Klux Klansmen, and Nazi soldiers. Three miles east of Rock Ridge, Bart gathers the townspeople and the black and Chinese railroad workersâwho have agreed to help in exchange for acceptance by the communityâto build a fake town as a diversion.

United States of America: The torch relay's North American leg occurred in San Francisco, California on April 9. On the day of the relay officials diverted the torch run to an unannounced route. The start was at McCovey Cove, where Norman Bellingham of the U.S. Olympic Committee gave the torch to the first torchbearer, Chinese 1992 Olympic champion swimmer Lin Li. The planned closing ceremony at Justin Herman Plaza was cancelled and instead, a ceremony was held at San Francisco International Airport, where the torch was to leave for Buenos Aires. The route changes allowed the run to avoid large numbers of China supporters and protesters against China. As people found out there would be no closing ceremony at Justin Herman Plaza, there were angry reactions. One demonstrator was quoted as saying that the route changes were an effort to \\"thwart any organized protest that had been planned.\\" San Francisco Board of Supervisors President Aaron Peskin, a critic of Mayor Gavin Newsom, said that it was a \\"cynical plan to please the Bush State Department and the Chinese government because of the incredible influence of money.\\" Newsom, on the other hand, said he felt it was in \\"everyone's best interest\\" and that he believed people had been \\"afforded the right to protest and support the torch\\" despite the route changes. Peter Ueberroth, head of the U.S. Olympic Committee, praised the route changes, saying, \\"The city of San Francisco, from a global perspective, will be applauded.\\" People who saw the torch were surprised and cheered as shown from live video of CBS and NBC. The cost to the city for hosting the event was reported to be USD 726,400, nearly half of which has been recovered by private fundraising.

Lloyd (Woody Harrelson). But Lloyd shoots Max before passing out from being gassed by the thieves. Max survives and tells Lola to get the diamond. She does, leaving in its place the one-dollar bill that she had received as a tip for washing the agents' windshield (while in disguise). Max and Lola then fly to Paradise Island in The Bahamas. Agent Lloyd shows up 6 months later and accuses Burdett of planning to steal the third Napoleon diamond, which is on a cruise ship that will be docking for a week on the island. He denies this, and unwittingly turns the tables and befriends the frustrated detective Lloyd, showing him the pleasures that Paradise Island has to offer, even paying for the most expensive suite, the bridge suite, for as long as Lloyd is there. Lloyd, out of his element, adapts quickly to the easy-going Caribbean lifestyle and partners up with Sophia, a local constable, to try and capture Max at last when he steals the diamond, which Max visits and later gives in to the temptation to steal. Henri MoorÃ©, a powerful, popular tycoon thought of by some as a gangster, learns of Burdett's impressive history as a thief and offers him additional island-life benefits and pleasures in return for stealing the diamond.

But Julia was suspected to be not only cheating on Clyde, but also stealing from him, for gangster boyfriend Joe Morelli.And the Wynant family was as happy as Nick last left them.

Frank happily welcomes his brother and takes him home, catching up on old times. But his wife, Ida (Irene Papas), reminds him that \\"they're going to send someone,\\" suggesting that perhaps Vinnie is the one. In a flashback, Frank recalls better times in New York, beginning with Vinnie's homecoming from military service and subsequent marriage to Emma Bertolo (Susan Strasberg). The father of the bride, Dominick Bertolo (Luther Adler) is a Mafia don, as is the groom's brother, Frank. And among those paying their respects as guests at the wedding are mob leaders like Egan (Murray Hamilton), Rotherman (Val Avery) and Levin (Alan Hewitt), who are the equals of Frank and Dominick in the New York region's organized crime. These capos within the Organization meet as a board to coordinate their business. The majority becomes increasingly unhappy with Frank's position, as he seems opposed to every new idea. Frank also dispenses justice on his own in the old Sicilian fashion, without seeking approval from the others.

Given the question: Answer the following question given this paragraph:      Q: When animals get rid of their gaseous waste, what is exhaled through their mouth and nose?   Choices:  - oxygen  - carbon monoxide  - hydrogen  - carbon dioxide  A: The answer is:","output":"carbon dioxide When animals, including humans, consume food, their bodies break it down through a process called cellular respiration. During this process, the energy stored in the food is converted into a form of energy that the body can use, called adenosine triphosphate, or ATP. The process of cellular respiration involves a series of chemical reactions, which ultimately produces carbon dioxide and water as waste products. This process also requires oxygen as a reactant, which is why animals need to breathe in oxygen from their environment. As the cellular respiration process generates carbon dioxide as a byproduct, it begins to accumulate in the animal's bloodstream. In response, the animal's respiratory system works to expel this excess carbon dioxide out of the body to maintain its internal homeostasis. This gaseous waste, or carbon dioxide, is exhaled through an animal's mouth and nose. The options given were oxygen, carbon monoxide, hydrogen, and carbon dioxide. The answer is carbon dioxide because it is the gaseous waste generated through the process of cellular respiration and expelled through an animal's mouth and nose. Oxygen is necessary for the cellular respiration process, but it is not a waste product. Carbon monoxide is not produced in significant amounts during cellular respiration and is a toxic gas to humans and animals alike. Hydrogen, although involved in some of the chemical reactions in cellular respiration, is not the primary gaseous waste product exhaled by animals."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Article: Charles \\"Wag\\" Bennett, one of the judges at the 1966 competition, was impressed with Schwarzenegger and he offered to coach him. As Schwarzenegger had little money, Bennett invited him to stay in his crowded family home above one of his two gyms in Forest Gate, London, England. Yorton's leg definition had been judged superior, and Schwarzenegger, under a training program devised by Bennett, concentrated on improving the muscle definition and power in his legs. Staying in the East End of London helped Schwarzenegger improve his rudimentary grasp of the English language. Also in 1966, Schwarzenegger had the opportunity to meet childhood idol Reg Park, who became his friend and mentor. The training paid off and, in 1967, Schwarzenegger won the title for the first time, becoming the youngest ever Mr. Universe at the age of 20. He would go on to win the title a further three times. Schwarzenegger then flew back to Munich, training for four to six hours daily, attending business school and working in a health club (Rolf Putziger's gym where he worked and trained from 1966–1968), returning in 1968 to London to win his next Mr. Universe title. He frequently told Roger C. Field, his English coach and friend in Munich at that time, \\"I'm going to become the greatest actor!\\" Question: Which part of his body did Schwarzenegger work to develop with Coach Bennett?","output":"Schwarzenegger worked to develop the muscle definition and power in his legs with Coach Bennett."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Please answer the following question: Process:  - Gather the ingredients for the cake - Mix the flour, sugar, egg, and water to make batter - Pour the mixture into a cake pan - Place the cake in the oven to cook - Take the cake out when it is cooked through - Let the cake cool - Serve the cake -   Perturbation hypothesis: suppose eggs are used in the batter happens, how will it affect the cake will not rise.  Does the supposed perturbation have an effect (direct or indirect) on the process? A:","output":"Yes, the supposed perturbation does have an effect on the process, both directly and indirectly.  In the context of baking, a perturbation refers to a change, disturbance, or modification in the standard recipe or procedure. The perturbation hypothesis mentioned in the question assumes that eggs are used in the batter. However, it also states that the cake will not rise, which suggests that something is amiss with the expected chemical reactions within the cake. Direct effect:  The use of eggs plays an essential role in the process of baking a cake, as eggs contribute to the structure, leavening, and texture of the cake. The proteins in eggs help in creating a stable structure, while the fats contribute to a moister and tender crumb. More specifically, eggs help the cake to rise by incorporating air into the batter during mixing. The proteins then coagulate during baking, providing the necessary structure for the cake. The perturbation hypothesis suggests that the inclusion of eggs will not result in the cake rising as expected. This indicates that there may be a problem with either the eggs themselves, the other ingredients, or the method being followed. Indirect effect: As observed, the failure of the cake to rise due to the supposed perturbation affects the various stages of the process. The different steps involved in the process, such as mixing the ingredients, baking, cooling, and serving the cake, would be impacted by the cake's failure to rise and achieve the proper texture and structure. The unsuccessful leavening process might be attributed to several factors, such as expired or chemically imbalanced baking powder or baking soda, inadequate amounts of eggs or other leavening agents in the recipe, insufficient mixing, or a disruption in the heating process during baking. In this scenario, the perturbation hypothesis has both direct and indirect effects on the overall cake-making process, as it results in an undesired outcome—the lack of rise in the cake—that would influence not only the texture and structure of the cake but also the steps that follow with cooling and serving a well-baked cake. Consequently, it may be necessary to reevaluate the recipe or technique being used to prepare the batter, ensure the use of fresh and appropriate ingredients, and maintain proper baking procedures to achieve a well-risen cake."},{"instruction":"You should describe the task and explain your answer.

Help as much as you can. Detailed Instructions: In this task you are expected to fix an SQL query based on feedback. You will be given an SQL statement and an English description with what is wrong about that SQL statement. You must correct the SQL statement based off of the feedback. An SQL query works by selecting data from a table where certain conditions apply. A table contains columns where every row in that table must have a value for each column. Every table has a primary key that uniquely identifies each row, usually an id. To choose which columns are returned you specify that after the \\"SELECT\\" statement. Next, you use a \\"FROM\\" statement to specify what tables you want to select the data from. When you specify a table you can rename it with the \\"AS\\" statement. You can reference that table by whatever name follows the \\"AS\\" statement. If you want to select data from multiple tables you need to use the \\"JOIN\\" statement. This will join the tables together by pairing a row in one table with every row in the other table (Cartesian Product). To limit the number of rows returned you should use the \\"ON\\" statement. This will only return rows where the condition specified after the statement is true, this is usually an equals operator with primary keys. You can also use the \\"WHERE\\" statement to specify that only rows with column values statisfying a certain condition, should be returned. The \\"GROUP BY\\" statement will group rows together that have equal column values for whatever columns follows the statement. The \\"HAVING\\" statement will return groups that statisfy whatever condition follows the statement. Any column(s) being returned from grouped rows must either be an aggregate function, (AVG, MAX, COUNT, SUM, ...) of a column, or the column(s) that the data was grouped by. To sort the returned data you can use the \\"ORDER BY\\" command which will order the data by whatever aggregate function or column follows the statement. The \\"DESC\\" statement will sort in descending order and the \\"ASC\\" statement will sort in ascending order. Finally, you can use the \\"LIMIT\\" statement to return a certain number of rows. When \\"*\\" is used in an SQL statement every column is returned. For example, SELECT * FROM table WHERE attribute = 1, will select every column from rows with the attribute column equal to 1.

DUSSELDORF - Struggling German retail concern KarstadtQuelle asked shareholders Monday for a EUR 500 million capitalisation increase, at the same time cautioning that it may only just barely turn a profit again in 2005. What is this text about?","output":"This text is essentially about the financial condition and strategic plans of the German retail company KarstadtQuelle. It explains how the company, which is currently facing financial difficulties, is trying to enhance its capital and significantly augment its financial health through a proposal to its shareholders for an increase in capitalization by EUR 500 Million. Capitalization, in business, can refer to the sum of a company's long-term debt, short-term debt, common equity, and preferred equity. Therefore, a request to increase capitalization is an appeal for more investment from shareholders, which can be used for various purposes such as running the company's operations, paying off debts, investing in new projects or strengthening the company's overall financial position. Alongside this important proposal, KarstadtQuelle is also expressing a cautious outlook for the future. The firm anticipates just barely returning to profitability in 2005. An assertion that suggests the company is in a recovery phase and that it may take a while for the effects of the capital injected - if the shareholders do agree with the increase - to manifest in significant profit.  The move by KarstadtQuelle to increase its capitalization thus signifies a key step in its business strategy to overcome current struggles and improve its financial standing. At the same time, the cautionary note about likely limited profitability in the following year highlights the continuing challenges and uncertainties the company faces in its bid to achieve financial stability and growth.  It reflects that the company is in a critical phase of reshaping its financial structure, where its operational performance, strategic plans, shareholders' confidence, market conditions, and other financial and non-financial aspects will possibly determine its future success or failure."},{"instruction":"Q:Write a multi-choice question for the following article: Article: The following five destination shall never be missed *Blue Lagoon :     Blue Lagoon geothermal  spa is one of the most visited attractions in Iceland.

The mixed reviews are not only reflected on various online platforms, but it's also a common topic among the community, causing a palpable level of disappointment for what was once a beloved joint. Customers highlight a need for significant improvements, noting that the meals are predominantly greasy, processed, and often served lukewarm, reflecting a seemingly clear disregard for the intricacies connected with the art of cooking, thus contributing to its low standing in the fiercely competitive world of food and hospitality. In addition, some argue that The Phoenix is not living up to its name; instead of rising from the ashes, improving, and revitalizing its menu, it stubbornly clings to outdated fast food practices that fail to meet the increasingly health-conscious and quality-aware demands of today's customers. Despite the owner's attempts to justify it as a nostalgic ode to classic fast food, public sentiment seems to converge on the idea that time has overtaken The Phoenix, leaving it a relic of a bygone era, much in need of a gastronomic and customer service overhaul to reclaim its glory days, rescue its dwindling customer rating and start to show signs of the legendary phoenix's rebirth in its service."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

If not, let me know by writing \\"Not answerable\\".  Plot title: The Untouchables Movie plot: During Prohibition in 1930, Al Capone has nearly the whole city of Chicago under his control and supplies illegal liquor. Bureau of Prohibition agent Eliot Ness is assigned to stop Capone, but his first attempt at a liquor raid fails due to corrupt policemen tipping Capone off. He has a chance meeting with Irish-American veteran officer Jimmy Malone, who is fed up with the rampant corruption and offers to help Ness, suggesting that they find a man from the police academy who has not come under Capone's influence. They recruit Italian-American trainee George Stone (aka-Giuseppe Petri) for his superior marksmanship and intelligence. Joined by accountant Oscar Wallace, assigned to Ness from Washington, D.C., they conduct a successful raid on a Capone liquor cache and start to gain positive publicity, with the press dubbing them \\"The Untouchables.\\" Capone later kills the henchman in charge of the cache as a warning to his other men. Wallace discovers that Capone has not filed an income tax return for some years and suggests that the team try to build a tax evasion case against him, since he is well-insulated from his other crimes. An alderman offers Ness a bribe to drop his investigation, but Ness angrily refuses it and throws him out of the office. When Capone gunman Frank Nitti threatens Ness' family, Ness has his wife and daughter moved to a safe house. His team flies to the CanadaâUnited States border to intercept an incoming liquor shipment, aided by the Royal Canadian Mounted Police, killing several gangsters and capturing George, a Capone bookkeeper. Malone shoots a gangster through the mouth (not revealing the man is already dead) to scare George into agreeing to testify against Capone. Wallace prepares to escort George from the Chicago police station to a safe house, but they are shot and killed by Nitti, who has infiltrated the station. Ness confronts Capone and his men over the deaths, but Malone intervenes to save him from being killed and urges him to persuade the district attorney not to dismiss... My question: Who prepares to escort George from the Chicago police station to a safe house?

Certainly the stuff he'd been helping Chloe and her gang of followers do for the last few hours was technically illegal. He'd asked them why they were helping him, what did they hope to gain? They'd told him that this is what they did for fun. Chloe assured him that they \\"lived for this kinda shit.\\" Ok, fine. He could sort of see that. Once he was there, helping them come up with the plan and then actually carrying it out, it sure as hell was exciting - probably the most exciting thing he'd ever done. Now that he was home and alone with his misgivings and paranoia, it all seemed like a really stupid idea. If it weren't for Chloe and her mesmerizing enthusiasm, there's no doubt that he wouldn't be doing this at all. But it was too late now. Or was it? It was five in the morning when Paul got back to his apartment. He'd told Chloe that he wanted to get a few hours sleep before the big meeting, but he now realized that there was no way he was going to be able to relax. When he'd stepped out the door twenty-two hours earlier he'd still had his job and was looking forward to a showing the rest of the art team his new designs for some of the higher-level monsters he wanted to add to the game. Screw that, he thought, they're my monsters now. I'll use them somewhere else. It could never work. How could it? Right then and there Paul decided that he was going to call the whole thing off. It wasn't too late. They hadn't done anything yet that wasn't reversible. No one had been hurt. No money had changed hands. No one had been lied to.

It has continents and ocean basins. Continents are large land areas. These are the areas that are mostly above sea level. Ocean basins extend from the edges of continents. They include the ocean floor and Earths deep ocean trenches. You will also notice the ocean floor is not flat. It too has many Continents are much older than ocean basins. Some rocks on the continents are billions of years old. Ocean basins may only be millions of years old. Because the continents are so old, a lot has happened to them! As we view the land around us, we see landforms. Landforms are physical features on Earths surface. These features change over time, but how? There are actually two types of forces at work.  Question: \\"What are continents?\\" Answer: \\"Large stretches of connected land\\" Is this answer correct?","output":"Yes, that answer is correct. Continents are large stretches of connected land on Earth's surface, often separated by vast bodies of water such as oceans. They house diverse ecosystems, climates, and peoples. There are seven continents on Earth: Africa, Antarctica, Asia, Europe, North America, Australia, and South America. Now, let's imagine what Earth would look like without the oceans. If we were to completely drain all of Earth's oceans, the results would be nothing short of astonishing. Instead of vast stretches of open water, we would now be looking at a complex and varied landscape of underwater terrain. The ocean floor, once hidden beneath miles of water, would be prominently on display. The massive underwater mountains and ridges that line the ocean floor, such as the Mid-Atlantic Ridge, would be visible, giving us new peaks to explore similar to those found on dry land. In fact, if the tallest point on Earth, Mount Everest, were placed underwater at the bottom of the Mariana Trench, there would still be over a mile of open space between the summit and the surface of the ocean. We might notice newly exposed underwater valleys, plains, and canyons that dwarf their dry counterparts. With the water gone, the abyssal plains would stretch out as vast, flat desert regions covering the planet's now-exposed ocean floor. Draining Earth's oceans would also reveal leftover remnants of human civilization. Sunken ships, aircraft, and other underwater artifacts would suddenly become accessible to exploration and examination. In regards to marine life, the disappearance of the oceans would cause a catastrophic loss of biodiversity. The millions of species that call the ocean home would suddenly find themselves without a suitable environment, leading to one of the largest mass extinction events in Earth's history. Furthermore, Earth's weather patterns would be severely impacted with the absence of the oceans, leading to much more extreme climate fluctuations and bringing about numerous unforeseen consequences for life on land. In summary, draining Earth's oceans would produce an entirely new world, filled with unexpected geological features and landscapes. It would alter the planet's climate and ecosystems dramatically, ultimately causing severe consequences for both marine and terrestrial life forms."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

The league is owned by the 20 member clubs that participate in the competition each season. These clubs act as shareholders, and they collectively make decisions related to league operations, including the election of the chairman and chief executive, as well as other major decisions. Since the composition of the Premier League changes every season due to promotion and relegation, the list of current shareholders is subject to change. However, as of the 2021-2022 season, the 20 Premier League clubs acting as shareholders are: 1. Arsenal Football Club 2. Aston Villa Football Club 3. Brentford Football Club 4.

What is the answer for the question: What building the architect and owner of Portland's quarries design and build? from the following article ?  Weymouth originated as a settlement on a constricted site to the south and west of Weymouth Harbour, an outlying part of Wyke Regis. The town developed from the mid 12th century onwards, but was not noted until the 13th century. By 1252 it was established as a seaport and became a chartered borough. Melcombe Regis developed separately on the peninsula to the north of the harbour; it was mentioned as a licensed wool port in 1310. French raiders found the port so accessible that in 1433 the staple was transferred to Poole. Melcombe Regis is thought to be the first port at which the Black Death came into England in June 1348, possibly either aboard a spice ship or an army ship. In their early history Weymouth and Melcombe Regis were rivals for trade and industry, but the towns were united in an Act of Parliament in 1571 to form a double borough. Both towns have become known as Weymouth, despite Melcombe Regis being the main centre. The villages of Upwey, Broadwey, Preston, Wyke Regis, Chickerell, Southill, Radipole and Littlemoor have become part of the built-up area. King Henry VIII had two Device Forts built to protect the south Dorset coast from invasion in the 1530s: Sandsfoot Castle in Wyke Regis and Portland Castle in Castletown. Parts of Sandsfoot have fallen into the sea due to coastal erosion. During the English Civil War, around 250 people were killed in the local Crabchurch Conspiracy in February 1645.  In 1635, on board the ship Charity, around 100 emigrants from the town crossed the Atlantic Ocean and settled in Weymouth, Massachusetts. More townspeople emigrated to the Americas to bolster the population of Weymouth, Nova Scotia and Salem, Massachusetts; then called Naumking. There are memorials to this on the side of Weymouth Harbour and near to Weymouth Pavilion and Weymouth Sea Life Tower.

When the entire British royal family is killed in a freak accident outside Buckingham Palace, Sir Cedric Willingham leads a search for any surviving heirs to whom to pass the crown. After days of researching, his team finally locates a living heir in the form of an American named Ralph Jones. Shortly after being fired from his job as a lounge singer in Las Vegas, Ralph is informed by Cedric's assistant private secretary Duncan Phipps that his grandmother Constance had an affair with the first Duke of Warren while working as a hotel waitress when the Duke was visiting the United States, resulting in Ralph having royal blood. Phipps provides further proof by showing Ralph a duplicate of the ring his grandmother used to wear that the Duke had given her. Ralph is flown to London, where Cedric gives him a crash course on royal etiquette. In only his second day as King, he goes to a strip club and meets Miranda Greene, an out-of-luck exotic dancer and aspiring fashion designer, and dares her to go out on a date with him if the British press proves his claim to the monarchy. Meanwhile, Lord Percival Graves is opposed to having an American on the throne and proposes to declare the reigning House of Wyndham at an end and replace it with the House of Stuart, of which he is patriarch. Prime Minister Geoffrey Hale states that Ralph's succession is legitimate unless he commits a grievous error.

Background: Arthur Wellesley, 1st Duke of Wellington,  (1 May 1769 - 14 September 1852), was an Anglo-Irish soldier and statesman who was one of the leading military and political figures of 19th-century Britain, serving twice as Prime Minister. His defeat of Napoleon at the Battle of Waterloo in 1815 puts him in the first rank of Britain's military heroes. Wellesley was born in Dublin, into the Protestant Ascendancy in Ireland. He was commissioned as an ensign in the British Army in 1787, serving in Ireland as aide-de-camp to two successive Lords Lieutenant of Ireland. Context: Wellesley was born into an aristocratic Anglo-Irish family in Ireland as The Hon. Arthur Wesley, the third of five surviving sons (fourth otherwise) to Anne and Garret Wesley, 1st Earl of Mornington. His mother was the eldest daughter of The 1st Viscount Dungannon. As such, he belonged to the Protestant Ascendancy. His biographers mostly follow the same contemporary newspaper evidence in saying that he was born on 1 May 1769, the day before he was baptised. His birthplace is uncertain. He was most likely born at his parents' townhouse, 24 Upper Merrion Street, Dublin, now the Merrion Hotel. But his mother Anne, Countess of Mornington, recalled in 1815 that he had been born at 6 Merrion Street, Dublin. Other places have been put forward as the location of his birth, including Mornington House (the house next door on Upper Merrion), as his father had asserted; the Dublin packet boat; and the mansion in the family estate of Athy (consumed in the fires of 1916), as the Duke apparently put on his 1851 census return.  He spent most of his childhood at his family's two homes, the first a large house in Dublin and the second Dangan Castle, 3 miles (5 km) north of Summerhill on the Trim Road (now the R158) in County Meath. In 1781, Arthur's father died and his eldest brother Richard inherited his father's earldom.  He went to the diocesan school in Trim when at Dangan, Mr Whyte's Academy when in Dublin, and Brown's School in Chelsea when in London. He then enrolled at Eton College, where he studied from 1781 to 1784. His loneliness there caused him to hate it, and makes it highly unlikely that he actually said \\"The Battle of Waterloo was won on the playing fields of Eton\\", a quotation which is often attributed to him. Moreover, Eton had no playing fields at the time. In 1785, a lack of success at Eton, combined with a shortage of family funds due to his father's death, forced the young Wellesley and his mother to move to Brussels. Until his early twenties, Arthur showed little sign of distinction and his mother grew increasingly concerned at his idleness, stating, \\"I don't know what I shall do with my awkward son Arthur.\\"  A year later, Arthur enrolled in the French Royal Academy of Equitation in Angers, where he progressed significantly, becoming a good horseman and learning French, which later proved very useful. Upon returning to England in late 1786, he astonished his mother with his improvement. Question: Did he go to college.. Whats the answer?","output":"Yes, Arthur Wellesley, 1st Duke of Wellington, attended college. He initially enrolled at Eton College, a prestigious independent boarding school in England, where he studied from 1781 to 1784. However, he did not experience much success at Eton and was not happy there, partly due to feelings of loneliness.  In 1785, following his lack of success at Eton and financial difficulties in the family, Wellesley and his mother moved to Brussels. Later, in 1786, Arthur enrolled in the French Royal Academy of Equitation in Angers, France. At this academy, he made significant progress, becoming an accomplished horseman and learning to speak French fluently. His time spent at the French Royal Academy of Equitation vastly improved his skills and demeanor, much to the astonishment of his mother upon his return to England in late 1786."},{"instruction":"Given the following context:  Avery, who wears a Confederate Army uniform even though he didn't serve in the Civil War, demands that the men who work for rancher John Rutherford avenge him after Rutherford is killed trying to remove a squatter, Corey Everett, from his land.

Complicating their longtime working relationship is Guido's wife Nelle, who is still in love with former boyfriend Johnny. She gives Johnny an expensive custom pocket watch, the twin of a birthday present she gave her husband, except Johnny's has a romantic engraving on the back. Johnny gives the watch, along with a rejection note, to Harriet Hobson, a hat-check girl at the casino, to return to Nelle. Harriet, however, apparently commits suicide using gas. Her sister Nancy shows up to find out what happened. She becomes attracted to Johnny. They eventually learn from Police Inspector Koch that Harriet was killed by poison. Harriet was dating Chuck Blayden, a crooked cop who is trying to persuade Guido to let him take Johnny's place. When Blayden also turns up dead, Koch suspects that either Johnny or Marchettis is responsible. Though Johnny tries to resist, little by little, he falls for Nancy. When Koch shows both Johnny and Marchettis Johnny's watch and note, Johnny tells Nancy their relationship is through and takes her to the airport. As he is driving away, however, he narrowly survives a drive-by shooting, and Nancy realizes he was only trying to protect her. She refuses to leave him. Johnny decides to flee to South America with Nancy, but not before brazenly cashing in his share of the casino. Marchettis pulls out a gun when Johnny's back is turned. They shoot it out; Marchettis is killed and Johnny wounded. Afterward, Nelle offers to testify it was self-defense, but only if he will come back to her. He refuses, so she tells Koch it was cold-blooded murder. Johnny's first instinct is to run away, but Nancy convinces him to give himself up., can you guess it ? Answer:","output":"Harriet Hobson was returning the watch for Johnny O'Clock. Johnny gave Harriet the expensive custom pocket watch, along with a rejection note, to return to Guido Marchettis' wife, Nelle. This is because Nelle had given the watch to Johnny, but he wanted to reject her romantic advances."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant. User will you give you a task.

They briefly called themselves the Blackjacks, before changing their name to the Quarrymen after discovering that a respected local group was already using the other name. Fifteen-year-old Paul McCartney joined them as a rhythm guitarist shortly after he and Lennon met that July. In February 1958, McCartney invited his friend George Harrison to watch the band. The fifteen-year-old auditioned for Lennon, impressing him with his playing, but Lennon initially thought Harrison was too young for the band. After a month of Harrison's persistence, during a second meeting (arranged by McCartney), he performed the lead guitar part of the instrumental song \\"Raunchy\\" on the upper deck of a Liverpool bus, and they enlisted him as their lead guitarist.By January 1959, Lennon's Quarry Bank friends had left the group, and he began his studies at the Liverpool College of Art. The three guitarists, billing themselves at least three times as Johnny and the Moondogs, were playing rock and roll whenever they could find a drummer. Lennon's art school friend Stuart Sutcliffe, who had just sold one of his paintings and was persuaded to purchase a bass guitar, joined in January 1960, and it was he who suggested changing the band's name to Beatals, as a tribute to Buddy Holly and the Crickets. They used this name until May, when they became the Silver Beetles, before undertaking a brief tour of Scotland as the backing group for pop singer and fellow Liverpudlian Johnny Gentle. By early July, they had refashioned themselves as the Silver Beatles, and by the middle of August shortened the name to The Beatles.Allan Williams, the Beatles' unofficial manager, arranged a residency for them in Hamburg, but lacking a full-time drummer they auditioned and hired Pete Best in mid-August 1960.

Problem: peter invests a sum of money and gets back an amount of  800 in 3 years . david invests an equal amount of money and gets an amount of  854 in 4 years . if both amounts were invested at the same rate ( simple interest ) what was the sum of money invested ?  Options: a ) 653 , b ) 664 , c ) 698 , d ) 744 , e ) 700 Output:","output":"First, let's identify the variables: P: principal (sum of money invested) R: rate (simple interest rate) T_peter: 3 years T_david: 4 years For Peter: Amount_peter = P + Simple_Interest_peter 800 = P + (P * R * T_peter) For David: Amount_david = P + Simple_Interest_david 854 = P + (P * R * T_david) Both amounts were invested at the same rate and the same initial amount. We can write the simple interest equation for Peter and David: 800 = P + (P * R * 3) 854 = P + (P * R * 4) Next, we need to find the value of P. First, we can isolate the (P * R) term in each equation: 800 - P = P * R * 3 854 - P = P * R * 4 Now we can divide the first equation by 3 and the second equation by 4: (800 - P)/3 = P * R (854 - P)/4 = P * R Since both of these terms are equal to P * R, we can set them equal to each other: (800 - P)/3 = (854 - P)/4 Next, we need to solve the equation for the value of P. Cross-multiply: 4 * (800 - P) = 3 * (854 - P) 3200 - 4P = 2562 - 3P Add 4P to both sides: 3200 = 2562 + P Subtract 2562 from both sides: P = 638 Now we have found that the sum of money invested is 638, which is not in the given options. Therefore, we need to double-check our calculations to make sure we didn't make any mistakes. Going back to the simple interest equations for Peter and David: 800 = P + (P * R * 3) 854 = P + (P * R * 4) Let's plug in the value of P that we found: 800 = 638 + (638 * R * 3) 854 = 638 + (638 * R * 4) Now, let's solve for R. For Peter: 162 = 638 * R * 3 162 = 1914 * R R = 162 / 1914 R = 0.084639 For David: 216 = 638 * R * 4 216 = 2552 * R R = 216 / 2552 R = 0.084639 Since we got the same rate for both Peter and David, our calculations for P seem to be correct.

About 1/4 of the way thru I became deeply intrigued, and I wanted to know the ending right away. The way that Mitchard took the chapter writings to bring Arley and Annie together as a family was unique in that it showed how two different lives can be touched and altered by two completely different circumstances.

Information:  - Vertebrates comprise all species of animals within the subphylum Vertebrata (chordates with backbones). Vertebrates represent the overwhelming majority of the phylum Chordata, with currently about 64,000 species described. Vertebrates include the jawless fish and the jawed vertebrates, which include the cartilaginous fish (sharks and rays) and the bony fish.   - Invertebrates are animals that neither possess nor develop a vertebral column (commonly known as a \\"backbone\\" or \\"spine\\"), derived from the notochord. This includes all animals apart from the subphylum Vertebrata. Familiar examples of invertebrates include insects; crabs, lobsters and their kin; snails, clams, octopuses and their kin; starfish, sea-urchins and their kin; and worms.  - Chitin (CHON) is a long-chain polymer of an \\"N\\"-acetylglucosamine, a derivative of glucose, and is found in many places throughout the natural world. It is a characteristic component of the cell walls of fungi, the exoskeletons of arthropods such as crustaceans (e.g., crabs, lobsters and shrimps) and insects, the radulae of molluscs, and the beaks and internal shells of cephalopods, including squid and octopuses and on the scales and other soft tissues of fish and lissamphibians. The structure of chitin is comparable to the polysaccharide cellulose, forming crystalline nanofibrils or whiskers. In terms of function, it may be compared to the protein keratin. Chitin has proved versatile for several medicinal, industrial and biotechnological purposes.  - Binomial nomenclature (also called binominal nomenclature or binary nomenclature) is a formal system of naming species of living things by giving each a name composed of two parts, both of which use Latin grammatical forms, although they can be based on words from other languages. Such a name is called a binomial name (which may be shortened to just \\"binomial\\"), a binomen or a scientific name; more informally it is also called a Latin name. The first part of the name identifies the genus to which the species belongs; the second part identifies the species within the genus. For example, humans belong to the genus \\"Homo\\" and within this genus to the species \\"Homo sapiens\\". The \\"formal\\" introduction of this system of naming species is credited to Carl Linnaeus, effectively beginning with his work \\"Species Plantarum\\" in 1753. But Gaspard Bauhin, in as early as 1623, had introduced in his book \\"Pinax theatri botanici\\" (English, \\"Illustrated exposition of plants\\") many names of genera that were later adopted by Linnaeus.  - British Columbia (BC) is the westernmost province of Canada, with a population of more than four million people located between the Pacific Ocean and the Rocky Mountains.  British Columbia is also a component of the Pacific Northwest and the Cascadia bioregion, along with the U.S. states of Idaho, Oregon, Washington and Alaska.  - In biology, an organism is any contiguous living system, such as an animal, plant, fungus, archaeon, or bacterium. All known types of organisms are capable of some degree of response to stimuli, reproduction, growth and development and homeostasis. An organism consists of one or more cells; when it has one cell it is known as a unicellular organism; and when it has more than one it is known as a multicellular organism. Most unicellular organisms are of microscopic scale and are thus loosely described as microorganisms. Humans are multicellular organisms composed of many trillions of cells grouped into specialized tissues and organs.  - Calgary is a city in the Canadian province of Alberta. It is situated at the confluence of the Bow River and the Elbow River in the south of the province, in an area of foothills and prairie, about east of the front ranges of the Canadian Rockies. In the 2011 census, the City of Calgary had a population of 1,096,833 and a metropolitan population of 1,214,839, making it the largest city in Alberta, and the third-largest municipality and fifth-largest census metropolitan area (CMA) in Canada.  - Insects (from Latin ', a calque of Greek ['], \\"cut into sections\\") are a class of invertebrates within the arthropod phylum that have a chitinous exoskeleton, a three-part body (head, thorax and abdomen), three pairs of jointed legs, compound eyes and one pair of antennae. They are the most diverse group of animals on the planet, including more than a million described species and representing more than half of all known living organisms. The number of extant species is estimated at between six and ten million, and potentially represent over 90% of the differing animal life forms on Earth. Insects may be found in nearly all environments, although only a small number of species reside in the oceans, a habitat dominated by another arthropod group, crustaceans.  - In biology, a phylum (plural: phyla) is a taxonomic rank below kingdom and above class. Traditionally, in botany the term division was used instead of \\"phylum\\", although from 1993 the International Code of Nomenclature for algae, fungi, and plants accepted the designation \\"phylum\\". Depending on definitions, the kingdom Animalia contains approximately 35 phyla, Plantae contains about 12, and Fungi contains around 7. Current research in phylogenetics is uncovering the relationships between phyla, which are contained in larger clades, like Ecdysozoa and Embryophyta.  - In biology, moulting (British English), or molting (American English), also known as sloughing, shedding, or in many invertebrates, ecdysis, is the manner in which an animal routinely casts off a part of its body (often, but not always, an outer layer or covering), either at specific times of the year, or at specific points in its life cycle.  - Habelia is an enigmatic genus of extinct arthropod from the Middle Cambrian . Its fossils have been found in the Burgess Shale in British Columbia , Canada . 54 specimens of Habelia are known from the Greater Phyllopod bed , where they comprise 0.1 % of the community .  - A body plan (also written bodyplan), Bauplan (German plural Baupläne), or ground plan is \\"an assemblage of morphological features shared among many members of a phylum-level group\\". The vertebrate body plan is one of many: invertebrates consist of many phyla.  - Canada (French: ) is a country in the northern half of North America. Its ten provinces and three territories extend from the Atlantic to the Pacific and northward into the Arctic Ocean, covering , making it the world's second-largest country by total area and the fourth-largest country by land area. Canada's border with the United States is the world's longest land border. The majority of the country has a cold or severely cold winter climate, but southerly areas are warm in summer. Canada is sparsely populated, the majority of its land territory being dominated by forest and tundra and the Rocky Mountains. About four-fifths of the country's population of 36 million people is urbanized and live near the southern border. Its capital is Ottawa, its largest city is Toronto; other major urban areas include Montreal, Vancouver, Calgary, Edmonton, Quebec City, Winnipeg and Hamilton.  - A genus ( genera) is a taxonomic rank used in the biological classification of living and fossil organisms in biology. In the hierarchy of biological classification, genus comes above species and below family. In binomial nomenclature, the genus name forms the first part of the binomial species name for each species within the genus.  - Quebec City (pronounced or ) officially Québec) is the capital city of the Canadian province of Quebec. In 2015 the city had a population estimate of 545,485, and the metropolitan area had a population of 806,400, making it Canada's seventh-largest metropolitan area and Quebec's second-largest city after Montreal, which is about to the southwest.   - Toronto is the most populous city in Canada, the provincial capital of Ontario, and the centre of the Greater Toronto Area, the most populous metropolitan area in Canada. Growing in population, the 2011 census recorded a population of 2,615,060. As of 2015, the population is now estimated at 2,826,498, making Toronto the fourth-largest city in North America based on the population within its city limits. Toronto trails only Mexico City, New York City, and Los Angeles by this measure, while it is the fifth-largest (behind also Chicago) if ranked by the size of its metropolitan area . An established global city, Toronto is an international centre of business, finance, arts, and culture, and widely recognized as one of the most multicultural and cosmopolitan cities in the world.  - Ottawa is the capital city of Canada. It stands on the south bank of the Ottawa River in the eastern portion of southern Ontario. Ottawa borders Gatineau, Quebec; the two form the core of the OttawaGatineau census metropolitan area (CMA) and the National Capital Region (NCR). The 2011 census reported a population of 883,391, making it the fourth-largest city in Canada; and 1,236,324 within the CMA, making it the fourth-largest CMA in Canada. The City of Ottawa reported that the city had an estimated population of 960,754 as of December 2015.  - Idaho is a state in the northwestern region of the United States. It borders the state of Montana to the east and northeast, Wyoming to the east, Nevada and Utah to the south, and Washington and Oregon to the west. To the north, it shares a small portion of the Canadian border with the province of British Columbia. With a population of around 1.7 million people and an area of , Idaho is the 14th largest and 39th most populous of the 50 states. The state's capital and largest city is Boise.  - The Pacific Northwest (in the United States, commonly abbreviated as PNW), sometimes referred to as Cascadia, is a geographic region in western North America bounded by the Pacific Ocean to the west and loosely, by the Rocky Mountains on the east. Though no agreed boundary exists, a common conception includes the U.S. states of Oregon and Washington and the Canadian province of British Columbia. Broader conceptions reach north into Alaska and Yukon, south into far northern California and east to the Continental Divide, thus including Idaho, Western Montana, and western Wyoming. Narrower conceptions may be limited to the northwestern US or to the coastal areas west of the Cascade and Coast mountains. The variety of definitions can be attributed to partially overlapping commonalities of the region's history, geography, society, and other factors.  - An exoskeleton (from Greek , \\"éx\\" \\"outer\\" and , \\"skeletos\\" \\"skeleton\\") is the external skeleton that supports and protects an animal's body, in contrast to the internal skeleton (endoskeleton) of, for example, a human. In usage, some of the larger kinds of exoskeletons are known as \\"shells\\". Examples of animals with exoskeletons include insects such as grasshoppers and cockroaches, and crustaceans such as crabs and lobsters. The shells of certain sponges and the various groups of shelled molluscs, including those of snails, clams, tusk shells, chitons and nautilus, are also exoskeletons. Some animals, such as the tortoise, have both an endoskeleton and an exoskeleton.  - An arthropod (from Greek \\"arthro-\\", joint + \\"podos\\", foot) is an invertebrate animal having an exoskeleton (external skeleton), a segmented body, and jointed appendages (paired appendages). Arthropods form the phylum Arthropoda, which includes the insects, arachnids, myriapods, and crustaceans.  Arthropods are characterized by their jointed limbs and cuticle made of chitin, often mineralised with calcium carbonate. The arthropod body plan consists of segments, each with a pair of appendages. The rigid cuticle inhibits growth, so arthropods replace it periodically by moulting. Their versatility has enabled them to become the most species-rich members of all ecological guilds in most environments. They have over a million described species, making up more than 80% of all described living animal species, some of which, unlike most animals, are very successful in dry environments.  - Arachnids are a class (Arachnida) of joint-legged invertebrate animals (arthropods), in the subphylum Chelicerata. All arachnids have eight legs, although the front pair of legs in some species has converted to a sensory function, while in other species, different appendages can grow large enough to take on the appearance of extra pairs of legs. The term is derived from the Greek word (\\"aráchn\\"), meaning \\"spider\\". Spiders are the largest order in the class.  - Animals are multicellular, eukaryotic organisms of the kingdom Animalia (also called Metazoa). The animal kingdom emerged as a basal clade within Apoikozoa as a sister of the choanoflagellates. Sponges are the most basal clade of animals. Animals are motile, meaning they can move spontaneously and independently at some point in their lives. Their body plan eventually becomes fixed as they develop, although some undergo a process of metamorphosis later in their lives. All animals are heterotrophs: they must ingest other organisms or their products for sustenance.  - Alaska is a U.S. state located in the northwest extremity of North America. The Canadian administrative divisions of British Columbia and Yukon border the state to the east; its most extreme western part is Attu Island; it has a maritime border with Russia to the west across the Bering Strait. To the north are the Chukchi and Beaufort seasthe southern parts of the Arctic Ocean. The Pacific Ocean lies to the south and southwest. Alaska is the largest state in the United States by area, the 3rd least populous and the least densely populated of the 50 United States. Approximately half of Alaska's residents (the total estimated at 738,432 by the U.S. Census Bureau in 2015) live within the Anchorage metropolitan area. Alaska's economy is dominated by the fishing, natural gas, and oil industries, resources which it has in abundance. Military bases and tourism are also a significant part of the economy.

The motion, filed in common pleas court by the Pennsylvania Manufacturer's Association, says Penn State did not provide it with information relevant to the insurable risk the association assumed. The association has already sued Penn State over the coverage of one of Sandusky's victims' claims against the university, filed in November 2011. Report: Penn State faced 4-year 'death penalty' The NCAA handed","output":"down unprecedented sanctions against Penn State in 2012, including a 60 million fine, a four-year postseason ban, and the loss of scholarships. The university's football program faced these penalties as a result of the administration's failure to address and report Sandusky's abusive behavior. The ongoing legal battle between Penn State and its insurer highlights the university's continued struggle to resolve the fallout from the Sandusky scandal. As both parties seek to determine the extent of their respective liabilities, it remains to be seen how these disputes will ultimately be resolved, and what long-term effects they may have on the institution and its reputation."},{"instruction":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

Let's solve the math problem together step by step. We need to solve the equation -31*n + 116 + 70 = 0 for 'n'.  Step 1: Add 116 and 70 together. 116 + 70 = 186 Now, the equation looks like this: -31*n + 186 = 0 Step 2: Move the 186 to the other side of the equation. To do this, we'll subtract 186 from both sides. -31*n = -186 Step 3: Now, we need to find the value of 'n'. We can do this by dividing both sides by -31. n = -186 / -31 When we divide -186 by -31, we get: n = 6 So, the solution to the math problem is: n = 6"},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Please answer the following question: Found the following article online, use it to answer the question: What albums did the original lead guitarist for the band that had a member die in August 1992 perform lead vocals on?  Lukather is the original lead guitarist for Toto, serving in that capacity for the band's entire history, as well as a lead and backing vocalist and composer. Lukather won three of his five Grammy Awards for work with Toto, twice as an artist and once as a producer. David Paich led the band's songwriting efforts during the development of 1978's Toto—he penned all but two of the album's tracks, including all four of its singles. Lukather also credits Jeff Porcaro for his leadership within the band during that period. However, Lukather's role in Toto evolved over time owing to the changing needs of the band. In August 1992, Jeff Porcaro collapsed while doing yard work at home and subsequently died of heart failure. The death profoundly affected Toto and Lukather in particular, who felt that he needed to step up and make sure the band kept going. Thus, he began taking more of a leadership role. Toto went through several lead vocalists over the years, including Bobby Kimball, Fergie Frederiksen, and Joseph Williams. After the 1990 dismissal of their fourth vocalist, Jean-Michel Byron, Toto was without a lead singer until around 1997; Lukather assumed most of the vocal duties for the band during that time. He performed lead vocals for every track on 1992's Kingdom of Desire and 1995's Tambu except for two instrumental tracks. The Tambu single \\"I Will Remember\\", co-written by Lukather and Stan Lynch, reached number 64 on UK charts. Some Tambu reviewers contrasted Lukather's vocals with those of former singers Kimball and Williams (and indeed, heavily criticized the entire album), some concert reviewers noted that he struggled vocally on certain songs, and a number of backup singers and guest vocalists accompanied the band's live shows during that period. It was not until Toto brought back Williams and Kimball to collaborate on 1998's Toto XX that Lukather returned predominantly to the role of backup vocalist.Lukather's songwriting contributions grew from a smattering of tracks on early Toto albums to co-writing...

Its activation alerts Tetrax (known as Hoverboard in \\"Hunted\\"), who travels with his alien blob-like pilot Gluto to Earth in order to retrieve Ben. He explains the situation to Ben, who hasn't figured out the meaning of the countdown. He leaves Gwen and Grandpa Max behind, not wanting the latter to be recognized during their trip. Gwen sneaks on board anyway. Using the advanced medical equipment on board his ship, Tetrax finds the DNA signature of the Omnitrix's creator, Azmuth, and tracks him to a prison facility called Incarcecon. During the journey, Tetrax hopes Ben would stop being a hero when the Omnitrix stop the countdown and Azmuth would shut it up for good. Ben is upset that he'll never be a hero again. After staging a breakout, they free a female Chimera Sui Generis (Vilgax's species) named Myaxx, who is Azmuth's assistant; she had switched her DNA signature for Azmuth's when he refused to give her credit for helping to create the Omnitrix. Myaxx is also unable to disarm the self-destruct, which will not only kill Ben, but most of the universe's inhabitants, including Earth itself, but Myaxx knows how to find Azmuth, and leads them to the planet he's hiding out on: Xenon.

Novak Djokovic eased into the third round of the French Open with a comprehensive 6-1 6-4 6-2 victory over Jeremy Chardy at Roland Garros. The clay court showpiece is the only grand slam to have eluded Djokovic so far in his career but he looked in ferocious form on Wednesday as he blew away Chardy in just an hour and 31 minutes. Chardy held serve in his opening game but when he dropped the fourth, the world number two never looked back. Dominant: Novak Djokovic beat Jeremy Chardy in straight sets to progress in the French Open. No contest: Djokovic won 6-1 6-4 6-2 to reach the third round of the French Open. More to come: However, it is the one Grand Slam to elude the Serb and he will have his work cut out to win it. Djokovic was demonstrating all of his trademark athleticism to make it hard for his opponent but Chardy was not helping himself with unforced errors and the Serbian closed out the set in just 25 minutes. Djokovic broke Chardy in the first game of the second but the Frenchman broke right back before dropping his serve again with a double fault to hand the initiative back to his opponent. The rest of the set went with serve and Djokovic never looked overly troubled as he appeared to be going through the motions. Djokovic made it five from five on break point in the opening game of the third and looked set to steamroller his way to victory but he handed Chardy a second serve as he attempted to break back and the world number 42 took advantage with a crushing forehand. The run of breaks continued as Djokovic took the next and he was well in control despite letting out an almighty cry of frustration when sending a backhand into the net. Djokovic dropped his first two break points of the match in the next but made no mistake with the third, a backhand pass securing a 4-1 lead and ending Chardy's resistance. The remaining games went with serve as the rain began to fall on Court Philippe Chatrier and Djokovic eased into the next round. Photographic memory: Djokovic's coach Boris Becker was paying close attention to the match. Team: Becker later celebrated with Marian Vajda (2nd L), physical trainer Gebhard Phil-Gritsch (2nd R) and physiotherapist Milan Amanovic.

To secure commercial publication in 1896, Crane agreed to remove profanity, but he also made stylistic revisions. Bowers's approach was to preserve the stylistic and literary changes of 1896, but to revert to the 1893 readings where he believed that Crane was fulfilling the publisher's intention rather than his own. There were, however, intermediate cases that could reasonably have been attributed to either intention, and some of Bowers's choices came under fire – both as to his judgment, and as to the wisdom of conflating readings from the two different versions of Maggie.

This union could refer to any political, economic, or cultural union, such as the European Union, but it is important to understand that the key objective in the given scenario is to facilitate the integration of certain states into this union. In contrast, the statement emphasizes that this is not about conducting real negotiations among equal partners. This suggests that the dialogue involved in this process might not be built on a foundation of equal footing or fair exchange. Instead, the negotiation may be characterized by certain power imbalances or hierarchical dynamics between the different parties involved, wherein one party might have more authority or say in the final decisions. Such an absence of genuine negotiations could lead to potential challenges, as it may not be conducive to finding mutually beneficial or agreeable outcomes for all the involved parties. In order to foster robust cooperation and ensure successful integration, it is important for true negotiations to take place, which account for the varying needs and perspectives of each stakeholder. To address this issue, involved parties may need to adopt a more inclusive, collaborative, and transparent approach to their discussions. By engaging in open dialogue and being receptive to the various concerns of each party, they can ensure that the integration of certain states into the union is handled in a manner that acknowledges and respects the interests of all involved.

John Carter (Taylor Kitsch), a decorated former captain in the Confederate Army, is prospecting for gold. The locals don't seem to like him. Colonel Powell (Bryan Cranston) of the cavalry tries to press Carter into service to fight the Apache. Carter refuses to cooperate, and after several failed escape attempts, he tricks a cell guard, knocks him out, and escapes Fort Grant on Colonel Powells' horse. Powell and the rest of the cavalry give chase but are forced to halt when they see that Carter has met up with a mounted Apache war band. Both sides are armed and wary, and a language barrier increases the tension. Soon a gunfight breaks out. Carter takes the chance to run off, but Colonel Powell is shot, and Carter returns to retrieve the injured man.The two escape into a box canyon and find a small cave. The Apache approach but quickly withdraw when they see something on the the rock above the cave. Confused, Carter returns to where the Apache had been standing, and notices the spider symbol on the rock face. Leaving Powell near the opening, he goes deeper into the cave to investigate. There Carter finds a chamber with strange markings, the walls and roof lined with gold. Entranced, he misses the stranger who appears behind him, and Powell is almost too late to shout a warning. The stranger is a bald man in a shining robe with a knife that seemed to have manifested out of thin air. The two fight, Carter managing to shoot the bald...

Write a summary based on this article: Photo: AP      An African-American dishwasher at Yale University has lost his job after breaking what he described as a “racist, very degrading” stained-glass window panel at one of the university’s dining halls, the New Haven Independent reports. The panel depicted two slaves picking cotton.      Last month, Corey Menafee was working in Yale’s Calhoun residential college dining hall—named for former vice president John C. Calhoun, an advocate of slavery—when, on an impulse, he decided to reach up with a broomstick and knock the panel out of its frame. From the Independent:      Menafee, who is 38 years old, said he wasn’t motivated by allegiance to student activists when, while helping clean the hall on Monday, June 13, he decided on a sudden impulse to knock the panel down.      “I took a broomstick, and it was kind of high, and I climbed up and reached up and broke it,” he said. “It’s 2016, I shouldn’t have to come to work and see things like that.” “I just said, ‘That thing’s coming down today. I’m tired of it,’” he added. “I put myself in a position to do it, and did it.”      Students and faculty have called for Calhoun’s name to be changed; Yale President Peter Salovey announced in April that that would not be happening. Recently, Yale changed the title used by certain members of the school administration from “master” to “head of college.”      Menafee lost his job, he told the Independent, because the university deemed him a threat to students; he’d been working at the school since September 2007. “I didn’t commit any acts of violence against anyone or any living thing,” he said. “I didn’t be belligerent, or yell. I just broke the windows.”      Jonathan Holloway, dean of Yale’s undergraduate college, did not immediately respond to a request for comment from Gawker.      UPDATE: After this post was published, Yale spokesman Tom Conroy sent Gawker this statement: ||||| by Daniela Brighenti, Qi Xu, & David Yaffe-Bellany | Jul 11, 2016 4:06 pm      (1) Comment | Post a Comment | E-mail the Author      Posted to: Higher Ed, Labor, True Vote      (Note: We have temporarily suspended commenting and True Vote-ing on this story because our server couldn't handle the demand; we wanted to avoid having the site crash. We hope to renew those functions eventually.)            An African-American dishwasher lost his job after losing his cool and breaking a stained-glass panel in Yale’s Calhoun residential college dining hall that depicted slaves carrying bales of cotton.      The dishwasher, Corey Menafee, said he used a broomstick to knock the panel to the floor. He said he was tired of looking at the “racist, very degrading” image.      Yale University Police arrested Menafee, who now faces a felony charge. The university, meanwhile, has cut ties with him. (It was not officially clear Monday afternoon how exactly that happened.)            His actions provide the latest chapter in a contentious debate over the racially charged symbolism of the college, named for slavery advocate and former U.S. Vice-President John C. Calhoun. The debate gathered steam last summer with a petition demanding a name change, and has since grown to encompass the slavery-themed paintings, artifacts, and stained-glass tiles displayed in the college. In April, Yale President Peter Salovey announced that Yale will keep the Calhoun name despite a year-long campaign by students and faculty calling for it to be changed.      Menafee, who is 38 years old, said he wasn’t motivated by allegiance to student activists when, while helping clean the hall on Monday, June 13, he decided on a sudden impulse to knock the panel down.      “When I walked into this job, I wasn’t aware of none of that,” Menafee said. “And then you know, being there, you start hearing different things.”            “I took a broomstick, and it was kind of high, and I climbed up and reached up and broke it,” he said. “It’s 2016, I shouldn’t have to come to work and see things like that.”            “I just said, ‘That thing’s coming down today. I’m tired of it,’” he added. “I put myself in a position to do it, and did it.”      Yale Hospitality, Menafee’s employer, declined to comment on a personnel matter.      Last week, “Head of College” (the new title replacing “master”) Julia Adams announced in an email to the Calhoun community that a set of stained glass panels depicting various moments from the statesman’s life would be removed from the college common room.      In the email, Adams said the impetus for their removal came from a study conducted by Yale’s Committee on Art in Public Spaces “following damage to one of the windows” in the dining hall. In an interview, she declined to confirm that the window in question was the same panel broken by Menafee, referring further questions to University spokesman Tom Conroy. Conroy told the Independent that Menafee’s status is officially “not employed by the university.” He said he may not disclose any further information about what’s a personnel matter.      Update: After this story was originally published, Yale Vice President for Communications Eileen O’Connor sent a statement to the Independent.      “An incident occurred at Calhoun College, a residential college on the campus of Yale University, in which a stained glass window was broken by an employee of Yale, resulting in glass falling onto the street and onto a passerby, endangering [her] safety. The employee apologized for his actions and subsequently resigned from the University. The University will not advocate that the employee be prosecuted in connection with this incident and is not seeking restitution.”      In an interview with the Independent, O’Connor said glass fell on the passerby but that the woman was not injured. O’Connor claimed that Menafee’s resignation was not a condition of Yale declining to pursue the charges. Menafee himself declined to comment on that same question.      Last month, dining hall workers from across the university gathered in Calhoun to prepare food for a June 15 staff appreciation event on Old Campus, according to one of the workers involved. It didn’t take long for conversation to turn to the stained-glass panels on the Elm Street side of the building, said the worker, who asked to remain anonymous due to the sensitive nature of the issue.            “Everybody has something to say about them,” the worker said. “[Menafee] was the one who took action and busted that shit out.”            Menafee, who has not been in touch with his colleagues since losing his job, said he smacked the stained glass twice with his broom, then watched the panel fall to the ground, where it broke into pieces.            His boss, dining hall manager Samuel Feliciano, witnessed the episode, Menafee said, and police arrived on the scene shortly thereafter. (Feliciano could not be reached for comment.)            “I just went to the bathroom and shaved,” Menafee said, “to make sure I was clean-shaven for the authorities.”            He was arrested in Calhoun and left the college in handcuffs. He faces a second-degree misdemeanor charge of reckless endangerment and a first-degree felony charge of criminal mischief. He has yet to enter a plea.            Menafee grew up in New Haven and has two children. He graduated from Virginia Union University in 2001 with a degree in mass communications. Before starting his job at Yale in September 2007, he worked for a management services firm, and also spent a few months as a substitute teacher.            He said he regrets breaking the windows — ten seconds of action that cost him a job he loved.            “It could be termed as civil disobedience,” Menafee said. “But there’s always better ways of doing things like that than just destroying things. It wasn’t my property, and I had no right to do it.”            He lost his job, he said, because the university deemed him a potential threat to students, an assessment he vigorously contests.      In an interview with the Independent, Conroy said Menafee’s status is officially “not employed by the university.” He said he may not disclose any information on personnel records.      “I didn’t commit any acts of violence against anyone or any living thing,” Menafee said. “I didn’t be belligerent, or yell.

It is one of the core concepts in archaeology, the academic discipline concerned with documenting and interpreting the archaeological record. Archaeological theory is used to interpret the archaeological record for a better understanding of human cultures. The archaeological record can consist of the earliest ancient findings as well as contemporary artifacts. Human activity has had a large impact on the archaeological record. Destructive human processes, such as agriculture and land development, may damage or destroy potential archaeological sites. Other threats to the archaeological record include natural phenomena and scavenging. Archaeology can be a destructive science for the finite resources of the archaeological record are lost to excavation. Therefore archaeologists limit the amount of excavation that they do at each site and keep meticulous records of what is found. The archaeological record is the record of human history, of why civilizations prosper or fail and why cultures change and grow. It is the story of the world that humans have created.  - Uummannaq Fjord is a large fjord system in the northern part of western Greenland, the largest after Kangertittivaq fjord in eastern Greenland. It has a roughly south-east to west-north-west orientation, emptying into the Baffin Bay in the northwest.  - Norway (; Norwegian: (Bokmål) or (Nynorsk); Sami: \\"Norgga\\"), officially the Kingdom of Norway, is a sovereign and unitary monarchy whose territory comprises the western portion of the Scandinavian Peninsula plus the island Jan Mayen and the archipelago of Svalbard. The Antarctic Peter I Island and the sub-Antarctic Bouvet Island are dependent territories and thus not considered part of the Kingdom. Norway also lays claim to a section of Antarctica known as Queen Maud Land. Until 1814, the Kingdom included the Faroe Islands (since 1035), Greenland (1261), and Iceland (1262).

Four of the mummies are currently on display in the Greenland National Museum .  - Archaeology, or archeology, is the study of human activity through the recovery and analysis of material culture. The archaeological record consists of artifacts, architecture, biofacts or ecofacts, and cultural landscapes. Archaeology can be considered both a social science and a branch of the humanities. In North America, archaeology is considered a sub-field of anthropology, while in Europe archaeology is often viewed as either a discipline in its own right or a sub-field of other disciplines.  - Geologically, a fjord or fiord is a long, narrow inlet with steep sides or cliffs, created by glacial erosion.

The interior consists of a plateau characterised by sand and lava fields, mountains and glaciers, while many glacial rivers flow to the sea through the lowlands. Iceland is warmed by the Gulf Stream and has a temperate climate, despite a high latitude just outside the Arctic Circle. Its high latitude and marine influence still keeps summers chilly, with most of the archipelago having a tundra climate.  - An archaeological site is a place (or group of physical sites) in which evidence of past activity is preserved (either prehistoric or historic or contemporary), and which has been, or may be, investigated using the discipline of archaeology and represents a part of the archaeological record.

It is connected to the Atlantic via Davis Strait and the Labrador Sea. The narrower Nares Strait connects Baffin Bay with the Arctic Ocean. The bay is not navigable most of the year because of the ice cover and high density of floating ice and icebergs in the open areas. However, a polynya of about , known as the North Water, opens in summer on the north near Smith Sound. Most of the aquatic life of the bay is concentrated near that region. Extent. The International Hydrographic Organization defines the limits of Baffin Bay as follows: History. The area of the bay has been inhabited since  . Around  1200, the initial Dorset settlers were replaced by the Thule (the later Inuit) peoples. Recent excavations also suggest that the Norse colonization of the Americas reached the shores of Baffin Bay sometime between the 10th and 14th centuries. The English explorer John Davis was the first recorded European to enter the bay, arriving in 1585. In 1612, a group of English merchants formed the \\"Company of Merchants of London, Discoverers of the North-West Passage\\". Their governor Thomas Smythe organized five expeditions to explore the northern coasts of Canada in search of a maritime passage to the Far East. Henry Hudson and Thomas Button's explored Hudson Bay, William Gibbons Labrador, and Robert Bylot Hudson Strait and the area which became known as Baffin's Bay after his pilot William Baffin. Aboard the \\"Discovery\\", Baffin charted the area and named Lancaster, Smith, and Jones Sounds after members of his company. By the completion of his 1616 voyage, Baffin held out no hope of an ice-free passage and the area remained unexplored for another two centuries.

Title: A hefty little beast Review: I use this base for my drill press. The Mini Shop Fox is perfect for this application because the drill press has such a small footprint and the mobile base handles the extra weight well.My complaints, which aren't related to performance, include assembly and shipping.It took me about 20 minutes to assemble the product with 32 nuts and bolts. I had purchased two other Jet mobile bases for a table saw and band saw that had virtually no assembly at all. The Mini Shop Fox does handle more weight though.Also, shipping was an extra 9, even though Amazon advertised free shipping with tool purchases over a certain amount. This product came separately from the manufacturers warehouse, not Amazon's warehouse.Otherwise, I would have given this product a 5 star rating. Answer: Answer:","output":"Yes, this product review is overall positive.  Step 1: Analyze the title The title \\"A hefty little beast\\" suggests that the product is substantial and useful, giving a positive impression. Step 2: Analyze the content The reviewer mentions that the product is perfect for their intended use and handles the extra weight well, which is a positive remark. Furthermore, they state that if not for the assembly and shipping issues, they would have given the product a 5-star rating. This indicates that they are generally satisfied with the product's performance. Step 3: Consider the negatives The reviewer brings up complaints about assembly and shipping; however, they clarify that these issues are not related to the product's performance. This means that the negative aspects do not outweigh the positive aspects of the product. Taking these steps into account, the review is positive, as the user is happy with the product's performance, with minor complaints unrelated to the product itself."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

But she relayed to me one of her first U.S. memories: She wanted to lose weight. She was impressed by some things the U.S. had to offer - \\"you have actual nutritional information on everything!\\" - and thus figured everything she encountered was on the level. And she found a \\"miracle cure\\" company who was along those lines! \\"These are AWESOME miracle shoe inserts! Wear them, and the pounds will melt away!\\" She saved her pennies and dimes; she sprung for the inserts. She received them... and they were shoe inserts; that much was true. But then there was their documentation: \\"using these insoles, combined with a 1200 calorie-per-day diet....\\" Like a 1200-calorie diet won't likely involve weight-loss, no matter what else you did, shoe inserts aside. The inserts did nothing, obviously. It was a sham. At which point she knew she was snookered, but really had no recourse.

Write a text based on this summary: germany 's merkel welcomes as sensible signal release of christian convert in afghanistan Text:","output":"In a recent development, Germany's Chancellor Angela Merkel has expressed her approval regarding the release of an Afghan Christian convert. She acknowledges this action as a \\"sensible signal\\" that highlights the compassion and understanding exhibited by the authorities in Afghanistan. The Christian convert, who was detained by Afghan officials in the past, faced numerous challenges and opposition due to switching their faith from Islam to Christianity. Despite the pressure, the individual remained steadfast in their beliefs and faced the consequences. This issue was closely monitored by international human rights groups, who were concerned about the condition and well-being of the Christian convert. Chancellor Merkel's statement has not only brought attention to the matter, but has also showcased the significance of religious freedom and the importance of standing up for one's beliefs, regardless of societal norms and pressures. By referring to the release as a \\"sensible signal,\\" Merkel has applauded the decision of the Afghan authorities, who have displayed a sense of responsibility and flexibility towards their citizens and the international community. The release of the Christian convert in Afghanistan not only proves that individuals have the right to choose their religious path, but it also sends a message of tolerance and understanding to other nations around the world. In times of global conflict and increasing intolerance, such acts of kindness and consideration hold immense importance. It is hoped that this event serves as an inspiration to other nations to offer similar protection and understanding to their citizens, regardless of faith or beliefs."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

If audible ground fireworks convert chemical energy into sound, then audible ground fireworks convert chemical energy into what?  Answer choices: - Light  - chemical energy  - matter  - plasma  - sound  - energy  - heat  - fire A:","output":"Audible ground fireworks primarily convert chemical energy into sound, as the question suggests. However, they also produce other forms of energy and byproducts in the process. Here's a breakdown of how audible ground fireworks convert chemical energy into various forms: 1. Light - When the chemical reaction within fireworks takes place, it emits brightly colored light, which is one of the primary visual characteristics of any firework display. This happens when the energy from the reaction is absorbed by the electrons within the chemicals, which then get excited and release the energy in the form of light. 2. Chemical energy - The initial energy stored in the chemical compounds of firework is the chemical energy. Upon ignition, this chemical energy gets converted into other forms of energy, such as sound, light, and heat. 3. Matter - Although not a form of energy, matter is affected during the conversion process of an audible ground firework. The chemical compounds are transformed into other substances, such as ashes and smoke, as a result of the reaction. 4. Plasma - No plasma state is involved in the reaction of audible ground fireworks, so the conversion does not specifically result in plasma. 5. Sound - As indicated in the question, audible ground fireworks are designed to primarily convert chemical energy into sound. The reaction within the firework creates a rapid release of gases, which causes the surrounding air to expand and create a pressure wave we perceive as sound. 6. Energy - In general, energy can be considered a byproduct of the chemical reactions as it is transformed from one form (chemical energy) into others like sound, light, and heat. 7. Heat - When the firework combusts, it generates heat as a result of the exothermic reaction between the chemicals. This heat contributes to the loud noise, bright lights, and expansion of the gas in the firework. 8. Fire - While not an actual form of energy, fire represents a visible part of the exothermic chemical reaction taking place within the firework. The combustion of the chemical components generates the fire and heat we associate with fireworks. In summary, audible ground fireworks primarily convert chemical energy into sound, as mentioned in the question, but also produce other forms of energy and byproducts such as light, heat, and matter transformation."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

In interim boss Graham Barrow's first game in charge, Omar Bogle should have put the Latics in front when he fired wide after rounding Sam Johnstone. James Chester headed past Matt Gilks to give Villa the lead after the break. Scott Hogan then nodded in from Albert Adomah's cross, his first goal for Villa since joining from Brentford. Wigan, who dismissed manager Warren Joyce five days ago, should have taken the lead early on when Bogle hit the side netting from a tight angle. Both the former Grimsby striker and Gabriel Obertan then fired wide as the hosts had the better of the first half. Villa had gone close through Chester, who headed inches over just before the break, and it was the Welshman who broke the deadlock when he nodded home from close range with 17 minutes to go. Johnstone then denied Bogle with his fingertips before Adomah's cross found Hogan, who headed in from close range. Villa's form has dramatically improved in recent weeks but despite closing the gap on sixth-placed Sheffield Wednesday from 17 to 11 points in their last two games, with just eight games to go a play-off spot for Steve Bruce's 12th-placed side remains unlikely.

Rollo kills Horace.","output":"Title: A Twist in Fate Genre: Mystery/Thriller Plot Outline: The small town of Serendipity has always been a quiet and peaceful place—a refuge from the chaos of the world. However, the sudden and mysterious death of the town's beloved and wealthy magnate, Horace Harrington, leaves everyone shocked and horrified—especially when it is discovered that it was a murderous act.  As the investigation begins, several potential suspects emerge, each with a different motive. While the town gossips generate countless theories, our protagonist, Alex Westwood, a brilliant but introverted private investigator, is hired by Horace's family to solve the crime. As Alex delves deeper into the case, she unearths dark secrets about Horace's complicated past: a history of failed business ventures, bitter rivalries, and familial betrayals—all of which implicate multiple residents of Serendipity in his murder. Through unexpected friendships and interactions, Alex uncovers clues that eventually lead her to a surprising suspect: the town's lumbering and simple-minded yet gentle resident, Rollo Samuelson. Upon discovering this highly unlikely yet possible outcome, Alex confronts Rollo, who unexpectedly confesses to the crime. Just as Alex is about to turn him in, she becomes unsettled by a gut feeling that there is more to this story. Further investigation reveals that Rollo has been manipulated by another townsperson, who preyed on his kindhearted nature and vulnerability. This new suspect, Charles Mortimer, was a devious businessman who had dealings with Horace in the past, and had actually orchestrated Horace's death in order to gain control over his lucrative businesses. Charles had tricked Rollo into confessing to the crime to divert attention away from himself, taking advantage of Rollo's lack of understanding of the consequences. In the climax, Alex works with the local law enforcement to bring Charles to justice. Through courage and clever planning, they manage to expose Charles' fraudulent activities, ultimately proving Rollo's innocence. In the end, Charles receives the punishment he deserves, and Rollo is welcomed back gratefully into the community. Serendipity regains its peaceful atmosphere as the residents, united by the experience, learn the importance of trust, compassion, and truth. Meanwhile, Alex embarks on a new chapter in her life, leaving Serendipity with a sense of fulfillment from a case well solved and a newfound confidence in her abilities as a private investigator."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Dee liked to learn more about leaf cutter ants, while Bess learned all she could about all other ants.  Which person read less about indirect herbivory ants?  Hint: Most ants are generalist predators, scavengers, and indirect herbivores, but a few have evolved specialised ways of obtaining nutrition. It is believed that many ant species that engage in indirect herbivory rely on specialized symbiosis with their gut microbes to upgrade the nutritional value of the food they collect and allow them to survive in nitrogen poor regions, such as rainforest canopies. Leafcutter ants (Atta and Acromyrmex) feed exclusively on a fungus that grows only within their colonies. They continually collect leaves which are taken to the colony, cut into tiny pieces and placed in fungal gardens. Ergates specialise in related tasks according to their sizes. The largest ants cut stalks, smaller workers chew the leaves and the smallest tend the fungus. Leafcutter ants are sensitive enough to recognise the reaction of the fungus to different plant material, apparently detecting chemical signals from the fungus. If a particular type of leaf is found to be toxic to the fungus, the colony will no longer collect it. The ants feed on structures produced by the fungi called gongylidia. Symbiotic bacteria on the exterior surface of the ants produce antibiotics that kill bacteria introduced into the nest that may harm the fungi.","output":"In this scenario, Dee is more focused on studying leafcutter ants, while Bess learns everything she can about all other ants.

Leafcutter ants (Atta and Acromyrmex), however, have evolved a unique, specialized method of obtaining nutrition, as they exclusively feed on a fungus that grows only within their colonies. Despite their indirect herbivory behavior, leafcutter ants primarily rely on the fungus, rather than the leaves they collect, for their nutritional needs. The ants are mostly involved with providing the fungus with the ideal conditions and resources to grow. They recognize chemical signals from the fungus and adjust their plant collection according to the fungus's reaction. In turn, the ants feed on the gongylidia, which are structures produced by the fungi. Taking this into account, Dee would be reading and learning more about leafcutter ants, a specialized group of indirect herbivory ants, as they are her main interest. Bess, meanwhile, would devote her efforts to learning about various other ants, which can be assumed to entail less focus on leafcutter ants and their unique characteristics. So, in conclusion, Bess would be the person who reads less about indirect herbivory ants, specifically those involved in specialized symbiosis. While she might be knowledgeable about various types of ants and their different behaviors, her focus is less devoted to leafcutter ants and their unique symbiotic relationship with the fungi they cultivate, compared to Dee who dedicates her entire research to understanding leafcutter ants."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

An inquiry will now be made after a number of planning permission hurdles. CoW chiefs were forced to hand this term's British event to Donington Park. Write an article based on these highlights.","output":"Title: Circuit of Wales Development Stalls Again, Inquiry Launched Amid Planning Permission Hurdles The Circuit of Wales (CoW), a highly-anticipated £315 million motorsport venue, has suffered another major setback as its development has been halted once more. Originally scheduled to resume construction in February 2020, it appears that the ambitious project is being held back by various planning permission issues. Consequently, a formal inquiry has been called to substantially address these problems and expedite the development process. Located near Ebbw Vale in South Wales, the Circuit of Wales was initially proposed in 2011 as a state-of-the-art multi-purpose venue that would host various motorsport events, concerts, and conferences. Envisioned as a catalyst for both local and national economic growth, the project has been met with optimism and support since its inception. However, it has faced one obstacle after another, significantly delaying its progress. These recent setbacks have forced the Circuit of Wales chiefs to hand over the hosting rights of this term's British motorsport event to the Donington Park racing circuit in Leicestershire, England. This move is a considerable blow to the CoW project and the surrounding community, as the event would have generated significant tourism revenue and created ample opportunities for local businesses. With numerous planning permission hurdles causing unwanted disruptions, the formal inquiry aims to scrutinize the outstanding issues and identify potential solutions. Among the key questions posed by the inquiry will be whether the development adheres to all necessary regulations and if it could have any detrimental environmental impact on the surrounding area. The inquiry will also scrutinize the involvement of government bodies and local authorities in the Circuit of Wales project. These entities play a critical role in granting permits and ensuring that the development adheres to all required standards. Cooperation between the project's stakeholders and seamless communication will be essential if the Circuit of Wales is to see the green light and move forward with its construction. Despite facing these challenges, the potential economic benefits of a completed Circuit of Wales remain unquestionable. The project could provide a significant boost to the local economy, creating thousands of jobs and attracting a wealth of business and tourism to the region. Furthermore, the CoW would put Wales on the map as a global motorsport destination, stirring up immense national pride. In conclusion, the Circuit of Wales is a highly significant project that has the potential to transform the motorsport landscape and the economy of South Wales. While the recent setbacks have halted its progress, the impending inquiry offers a vital opportunity to address the ongoing obstacles and find a feasible path forward. The community of Ebbw Vale and the country of Wales as a whole will be holding their breath in anticipation, hoping that the CoW can soon overcome these challenges and rev its engine to create a brighter future for all."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

The lyrics describe two lovers passing over a bridge, with a melancholic observer reflecting on the couple, the Thames and Waterloo station. The song was rumoured to have been inspired by the romance between two British celebrities of the time, actors Terence Stamp and Julie Christie. Ray Davies denied this in his autobiography, and claimed in a 2008 interview, \\"It was a fantasy about my sister going off with her boyfriend to a new world and they were going to emigrate and go to another country.\\" Despite its complex arrangement, the sessions for \\"Waterloo Sunset\\" lasted a mere ten hours; Dave Davies later commented on the recording: \\"We spent a lot of time trying to get a different guitar sound, to get a more unique feel for the record. In the end we used a tape-delay echo, but it sounded new because nobody had done it since the 1950s. I remember Steve Marriott of the Small Faces came up and asked me how we'd got that sound. We were almost trendy for a while.\\" The single was one of the Kinks' biggest UK successes (hitting number two on Melody Maker's chart), and went on to become one of their most popular and best-known songs.

Robert was watching the local news when he saw a report about a wildfire. The report stated that there was a brush fire in the southwest part of Texas, where it was currently daytime. When he switched the channel, he saw another report about a different wildfire. This one was a forest fire in the northwest part of Seattle, where it was currently nighttime.  Hint: Wildfire intensity increases during daytime hours. For example, burn rates of smoldering logs are up to five times greater during the day because of lower humidity, increased temperatures, and increased wind speeds. Sunlight warms the ground during the day and causes air currents to travel uphill, and downhill during the night as the land cools. Wildfires are fanned by these winds and often follow the air currents over hills and through valleys. United States wildfire operations revolve around a 24-hour fire day that begins at 10:00 a.m. because of the predictable increase in intensity resulting from the daytime warmth. The answer to this question is:","output":"The wildfire in Texas will have higher intensity because it is currently daytime there, and wildfire intensity increases during daytime hours due to lower humidity, increased temperatures, and increased wind speeds."},{"instruction":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

The 18-minute speech, televised nationally, described what happened in the April 20 explosion and fire on a Gulf of Mexico oil rig that led to what Obama called \\"the worst environmental disaster America has ever faced.\\" He compared the millions of gallons of oil leaking into the ocean to an epidemic \\"we will be fighting for months and even years.\\" In an attempt to counter complaints of a sluggish government response to the oil disaster, OPTIONS: - America noted cited resources have poured into the region including nearly 30,000 people working in four states to contain and clean up the oil, along with \\"thousands of ships and other vessels.\\" - BP noted cited resources have poured into the region including nearly 30,000 people working in four states to contain and clean up the oil, along with \\"thousands of ships and other vessels.\\" - Barack Obama noted cited resources have poured into the region including nearly 30,000 people working in four states to contain and clean up the oil, along with \\"thousands of ships and other vessels.\\" - CNN noted cited resources have poured into the region including nearly 30,000 people working in four states to contain and clean up the oil, along with \\"thousands of ships and other vessels.\\" - Gulf of Mexico noted cited resources have poured into the region including nearly 30,000 people working in four states to contain and clean up the oil, along with \\"thousands of ships and other vessels.\\" - Obama noted cited resources have poured into the region including nearly 30,000 people working in four states to contain and clean up the oil, along with \\"thousands of ships and other vessels.\\" - Oval Office noted cited resources have poured into the region including nearly 30,000 people working in four states to contain and clean up the oil, along with \\"thousands of ships and other vessels.\\" - Republicans noted cited resources have poured into the region including nearly 30,000 people working in four states to contain and clean up the oil, along with \\"thousands of ships and other vessels.\\" - U.S. noted cited resources have poured into the region including nearly 30,000 people working in four states to contain and clean up the oil, along with \\"thousands of ships and other vessels.\\" - Washington noted cited resources have poured into the region including nearly 30,000 people working in four states to contain and clean up the oil, along with \\"thousands of ships and other vessels.\\" - White House noted cited resources have poured into the region including nearly 30,000 people working in four states to contain and clean up the oil, along with \\"thousands of ships and other vessels.\\"","output":"In an attempt to counter complaints of a sluggish government response to the oil disaster, President Barack Obama noted cited resources have poured into the region including nearly 30,000 people working in four states to contain and clean up the oil, along with \\"thousands of ships and other vessels.\\" The President emphasized the importance of a swift and comprehensive response to the spill, outlining the actions taken by his administration to address the crisis. He mentioned the deployment of over 17,000 National Guard troops that have been authorized to assist in the containment and cleanup efforts. In addition, the Environmental Protection Agency, the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration, and other federal agencies have been closely monitoring the spill's impact on the Gulf's ecosystems and coordinating the response efforts. Obama also used his address to push for a new legislative agenda, focusing on the development and implementation of clean, renewable energy sources. He urged Congress to work together in passing comprehensive energy and climate legislation, stressing the need for a transition away from fossil fuels and a move towards a more sustainable, environmentally friendly energy system. The President's call for action was met with support from environmental groups and clean energy advocates, who view the oil spill as a devastating reminder of the risks associated with continued dependence on fossil fuels. However, some critics argue that the President's speech did not offer sufficient details on how the administration plans to achieve these ambitious goals, particularly given the current political climate and the challenges in securing bipartisan support. In the meantime, the government and BP continue to collaborate on efforts to contain the leak and minimize its long-term impact on the Gulf region's economy and environment. New, innovative technologies are being explored to assist in the cleanup and recovery process, including the use of underwater robots and other advanced equipment. As the crisis in the Gulf unfolds, the nation's focus remains on both immediate containment and cleanup efforts, and on the broader issue of transitioning to a cleaner, more sustainable energy future. The Gulf oil spill tragedy has brought the vulnerabilities of our current energy system into sharp focus, providing a powerful impetus for change. Ultimately, it will serve as a catalyst for the nation to seriously reassess its energy policies and to take bold action towards a more sustainable future."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Here are possible answers to this question: - toy - park - earball - play with - bounces  I believe the correct choice is \\"toy\\", here's why: The answer to this question is:","output":"A super ball is a popular \\"toy\\" that children enjoy. The reason why the term \\"toy\\" perfectly describes a super ball is because it is an object designed for children's play and amusement. Super balls are typically made of a highly elastic polymer material that provides them with an incredible bounce, making them a fun and engaging plaything for kids. To fully understand why \\"toy\\" is the correct choice, let's discuss the other options and rule them out one by one: 1. Park: A park is a recreational area, usually outdoors, where people go to engage in various leisure activities such as playing on play equipment, having picnics, or engaging in sports. Although children might enjoy playing with a super ball at a park, the park itself is not specifically designed for the use of super balls. 2. Earball: An earball is not a relevant term in this context, and therefore, it does not relate to the question about a super ball. It's likely a made-up term that doesn't have any real meaning. 3. Play with: \\"Play with\\" is a verb phrase that describes the action of engaging with a toy or object for fun and enjoyment. While children certainly enjoy playing with super balls, the phrase itself does not accurately describe what a super ball is. 4. Bounces: This term describes the action or an attribute of a super ball, but it is not what a super ball is as a whole. Bouncing is one of the main features that make a super ball enjoyable for children, but it is merely an aspect of the toy, not the toy itself. In conclusion, a super ball is a popular \\"toy\\" that children enjoy due to its unique physical properties and capacity for incredible bounces. While the given alternatives might hint at some aspects of the super ball experience, none of them accurately define a super ball as the object it is. The term \\"toy\\" best encapsulates the essential nature of a super ball and its intended purpose - providing fun and entertainment for children."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Mariah Carey was blessed with totally cute twins, Moroccan and Monroe, otherwise known as DemBabies when she was 42, and Madonna gave birth to her last child, Rocco Ritchie , at the same age.

When I taught in the traditional classroom, creating self portraits was something I had students do whether they were four or nine. In fact, I’d have them draw one on the first day of school and one toward the end of the year and to see the change over time was always so interesting. At least once during the year, likely toward the beginning, I would center a lesson around self portraits. In younger classes, there would be more than one. Creating a self portrait teaches students to be aware of themselves. Where is her head in relation to her body? Where are her feet in relation to her legs? It also teaches children spatial awareness. Where should he begin…with his feet or with his head? Where on the paper should his head be placed? How far down should his arms go? How can his whole body fit on a single piece of paper? A Lesson on Creating Self Portraits Whether you are in a classroom, or teaching a child at home, here is a simple lesson on creating self portraits geared toward young children, anywhere from age 2 through age 6. Keep in mind that their final product will show various levels of writing development, depending on what stage of writing they are in. (Basically, a two-year-old’s drawing should look very different than that of a five-year-old.) The teacher will need to model how to draw a self portrait. Gather the children around an easel or board and clip a paper to it. Narrate the process as you walk through the steps. “I am going to draw a picture of myself. I am going to start with my head.” Use your hands to show your actual head on yourself so students are aware of what you talking about. The visuals also help English Language Learners (if you’re teaching in an English speaking classroom.) and build vocabulary for all students. Question: Why should the teacher use their hands when giving instructions?

As they stood there, going over each accomplishment, it was evident that Justin had been an outstanding athlete in his high school days - breaking records, leading his team to numerous victories, and earning numerous accolades for his outstanding performances. As they delved deeper into the details, they discovered that Justin had won multiple championships in various events such as 100 meters, 200 meters, 4x100 meter relay, and long jump. He had been a force to reckon with on the track, consistently displaying exceptional speed, agility, and determination, which had earned him the admiration of his coaches, teammates, and even his fiercest competitors. Joseph couldn't help but feel proud of his friend, knowing that those glory days were a testament to Justin's resilience and unwavering commitment to excel in everything he undertook. They spent hours reminiscing about past races, discussing the training routines, and analysing how different factors had contributed to Justin's successes. The records also provided a historical perspective, highlighting how sports have evolved over the years. They delved into the topic, comparing the training and coaching styles of their time to the present day, and how advancements in sports science and technology have shaped the landscape of athletics. Justin shared the challenges he had faced, the obstacles he had to overcome, and the countless sacrifices he had made to pursue his passion for the sport. Through these experiences, he had honed his character and mental toughness, which had contributed to his personal growth both in and out of the sports arena. These stories deeply resonated with Joseph, who also cherished the life lessons he had learned from his own participation in sports. As the day wore on, the two friends continued to peruse the records, reflecting on their own achievements, goals, and aspirations. The nostalgia triggered by revisiting the past opened up a new avenue of discussion, enabling them to explore the connections between their shared experiences and the individuals they have become. In the midst of these thoughtful conversations, one thing became abundantly clear to Joseph: the person standing before him was more than just a remarkable athlete; he was a person of immense strength, resilience, and determination.

Does the supposed perturbation have an effect (direct or indirect) on the process? The answer to this question is:","output":"Yes, the supposed perturbation of producing fewer echoes can indirectly affect the process of power production by the steam engine. If fewer echoes are produced, it could be an indication of reduced steam pressure or inefficient combustion in the firebox, which can lead to a decrease in the steam's ability to push the piston effectively. This, in turn, would affect the crank and connecting rod mechanism and result in the locomotive's wheels receiving less power, ultimately reducing the overall power produced by the steam engine.

The sword was named after Osman I, founder of the Ottoman Dynasty. The practice started when Osman I was girt with the sword of Islam by his mentor and father-in-law Sheikh Edebali. The girding of the sword of Osman was a vital ceremony which took place within two weeks of a sultan's accession to the throne. It was held at the tomb complex at Eyüp, on the Golden Horn waterway in the capital Constantinople. Even though the journey from Topkap Palace (where the sultan resided) to the Golden Horn was short, the sultan would board a boat amid much pomp to go there. The Eyüp tomb complex was built by Mehmed II in honour of Abu Ayyub al-Ansari, a companion of Muhammad who had died during the first Muslim siege of Constantinople in the 7th century. The sword girding thus occurred on what was regarded as sacred grounds, and linked the newly enthroned sultan both to his 13th-century ancestors and to Muhammad himself.  - The Ottoman Empire ('; Modern Turkish: ' or '), also known as the Turkish Empire, Ottoman Turkey, was an empire founded at the end of the thirteenth century in northwestern Anatolia in the vicinity of Bilecik and Söüt by the Oghuz Turkish tribal leader Osman. After 1354, the Ottomans crossed into Europe, and with the conquest of the Balkans the Ottoman Beylik was transformed into a transcontinental empire. The Ottomans ended the Byzantine Empire with the 1453 conquest of Constantinople by Mehmed the Conqueror.  - Mehmed VI (\\"Memed-i sâdis\\", \\"Vahideddin\\", or ), who is also known as \\"ahbaba\\" (meaning \\"Emperor-father\\") among his relatives, (14 January 1861  16 May 1926) was the 36th and last Sultan of the Ottoman Empire, reigning from 1918 to 1922. The brother of Mehmed V, he succeeded to the throne as the eldest male member of the House of Osman after the 1916 suicide of Abdülaziz's son Yusuf Izzettin Efendi, the heir to the throne. He was girded with the Sword of Osman on 4 July 1918, as the thirty-sixth \\"padishah\\". His father was Sultan Abdülmecid I and mother was Gülüstü Hanm (1830  1865), an ethnic Abkhazian, daughter of Prince Tahir Bey Çaçba and his wife Afie Lakerba, originally named Fatma Çaçba. Mehmed was removed from the throne when the Ottoman sultanate was abolished in 1922.  - Gülüstü Hanm; (1840  1865) was the Empress consort of Sultan Abdülmecid I. She was the mother of Mehmed VI, the last Sultan of the Ottoman Empire.  - Abdülmecid I (Ottoman Turkish:    \\"Abdül-Mecd-i evvel\\"; 23/25 April 182325 June 1861), also known as Abdulmejid and similar spellings, was the 31st Sultan of the Ottoman Empire and succeeded his father Mahmud II on 2 July 1839. His reign was notable for the rise of nationalist movements within the empire's territories. Abdülmecid wanted to encourage Ottomanism among the secessionist subject nations and stop the rise of nationalist movements within the empire, but failed to succeed despite trying to integrate non-Muslims and non-Turks more thoroughly into Ottoman society with new laws and reforms. He tried to forge alliances with the major powers of Western Europe, namely the United Kingdom and France, who fought alongside the Ottoman Empire in the Crimean War against Russia. In the following Congress of Paris on 30 March 1856, the Ottoman Empire was officially included among the European family of nations. Abdülmecid's biggest achievement was the announcement and application of the Tanzimat (Reorganization) reforms which were prepared by his father and effectively started the modernization of the Ottoman Empire in 1839. For this achievement, one of the Imperial anthems of the Ottoman Empire, the March of Abdülmecid, was named after him.  - The Ottoman Empire used anthems since its foundation in the late 13th century, but did not use a specific imperial or national anthem until the 19th century. During the reign of Mahmud II, when the military and imperial band were re-organized along Western lines, Giuseppe Donizetti was invited to head the process. Donizetti Pasha, as he was known in the Ottoman Empire, composed the first Western-style imperial anthem, the \\"Mahmudiye Mar\\".   - The March of Abdülmecid (Turkish: \\"Mecidiye Mar\\") was the national anthem of the Ottoman Empire. The title refers to Abdülmecid I (18391861). There were different anthems for each sultan.  - Mehmed V Reshad ( Ottoman Turkish :   Memed - i âmis , Turkish : Mehmed V Read or Reat Mehmet ) ( 2 November 1844 -- 3 July 1918 ) was the 35th Ottoman Sultan . He was the son of Sultan Abdülmecid I. He was succeeded by his half - brother Mehmed VI .  - Padeshah, Padshah, Padishah or Badishah is a superlative royal title of Persian origin, composed of the Persian \\"pd\\" \\"master\\" and the widespread \\"shh\\" \\"king\\", which was adopted by several monarchs claiming the highest rank, roughly equivalent to the ancient Persian notion of \\"The Great\\" or \\"Great King\\", and later adopted by post-Achaemenid and Christian Emperors. Its Arabized pronunciation as Badshah was used by Mughal emperors.  - Mahmud II (Ottoman Turkish:   \\"Mahmud-u sn\\",   \\"Mahmud-u Âdlî\\") (20 July 1785  1 July 1839) was the 30th Sultan of the Ottoman Empire from 1808 until his death in 1839. He was born in the Topkap Palace, Constantinople, the posthumous son of Sultan Abdul Hamid I.  - Ottomanism (\\"Osmanllk\\" or \\"Osmanlclk\\") was a concept which developed prior to the First Constitutional Era of the Ottoman Empire. Its proponents believed that it could solve the social issues that the empire was facing. Ottomanism was strongly influenced by thinkers such as Montesquieu and Rousseau and the French Revolution. It promoted equality among the \\"millet\\"s. The idea originated amongst the Young Ottomans in areas such as the acceptance of all separate ethnicities in the Empire regardless of their religion, i.e. they were all 'Ottomans' with equal rights. Put simply, Ottomanism stated that all subjects were equal before the law. Ideally, all citizens would share a geographical area, a language, culture, and a sense of a 'non-Ottoman' party who were different than them. The essence of the \\"millet\\" system was not dismantled, but secular organizations and policies were applied. Primary education, conscription, head tax and military service were to be applied to non-Muslims and Muslims alike.  - Paris (French: ) is the capital and most populous city of France. It has an area of and a population in 2013 of 2,229,621 within its administrative limits.

Information:  - Subaru cars are known for the use of a boxer engine layout in most vehicles above 1500 cc. Most Subaru models have used the Symmetrical All Wheel Drive drive-train layout since 1972. The flat/boxer engine and all-wheel-drive became standard equipment for mid-size and smaller cars in most international markets by 1996, and is now standard in most North American market Subaru vehicles. The lone exception is the BRZ, introduced in 2012, which uses the boxer engine but instead uses a rear-wheel-drive structure. Subaru also offers turbocharged versions of their passenger cars, such as the Impreza WRX and the Legacy 2.5GT. The 2.5XT trims of the Outback and Forester also include a turbocharged engine.  - The International Geneva Motor Show is an annual auto show held in March in the Swiss city of Geneva.

Does \\"For many, these distinctions are uncomfortable, but they also appear to motivate achievement through behavior consistent with the ideal and distinct from the feared possible selves.\\" correctly answer the question of How can the ideal self be described in terms of the adolescent?","output":"The statement \\"For many, these distinctions are uncomfortable, but they also appear to motivate achievement through behavior consistent with the ideal and distinct from the feared possible selves.\\" touches upon the role of the ideal self in adolescents, but it does not provide a thorough description of the ideal self within this context. To answer the question “How can the ideal self be described in terms of the adolescent?”, a more detailed explanation of the concept of the ideal self, its development, and its impact on adolescent behavior is required. The ideal self can be understood as an individual's mental representation of the traits, characteristics, values, and goals they aspire to possess. It serves as a guiding model that individuals strive to become, illustrating the best version of themselves that they can envision. In terms of the adolescent, this ideal self is often shaped by various influences, including personal desires, family expectations, cultural norms, societal pressures, peer groups, and media exposure. During adolescence, the concept of self becomes more complex and multifaceted. Adolescents begin to form self-concepts based on various domains of life, such as their academic performance, social relationships, physical appearance, and personal values. As they engage in self-discovery, adolescents are likely to encounter discrepancies between their current self and their ideal self. This awareness of the gap between the real and ideal self can evoke a range of emotional responses, including frustration, disappointment, and motivation. The statement highlights the distinction between the ideal self and the feared possible selves – the latter referring to the negative scenarios that individuals want to avoid, such as failure academically, socially, or in their future careers. These feared outcomes can provide additional motivation for adolescents to put in effort and work towards their ideal self. It is important to note that individual experiences with ideal and feared selves vary significantly, as everyone has unique self-perceptions and aspirations. In terms of adolescent development, the ideal self plays a critical role in shaping their identity and driving their behavior. When adolescents have a clear and constructive vision of their ideal self, it can serve as a source of inspiration, motivation, and direction for their lives, fostering self-improvement, learning, and personal growth. For example, an adolescent who aspires to become a successful scientist might be motivated to immerse themselves in their studies, participate in research projects, and seek out mentorship from professionals in the field. However, it is essential to recognize that the creation of an ideal self also carries potential psychological risks for adolescents. For some, the discrepancy between their current self and their ideal self might be too vast or unattainable, leading to feelings of low self-esteem, anxiety, and depression. Additionally, external factors like unrealistic media portrayals or societal pressures may contribute to developing an ideal self that does not accurately represent an individual's values or desires. In these cases, it is vital for adolescents to develop healthy self-awareness, establish realistic goals, and seek guidance from supportive adults and peers in refining their understanding of the ideal self. In conclusion, the ideal self in terms of the adolescent can be described as a dynamic and multifaceted concept that serves as a guiding vision for personal growth and achievement. While it may provide motivation and inspiration for adolescents, it can also evoke feelings of discomfort and tension due to the discrepancies between the real and ideal self. The ideal self plays a critical role in adolescent identity development and behavior, and understanding its complexities can help support adolescents in navigating their unique journeys towards self-discovery and self-improvement."},{"instruction":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

Their quest to find the meaning behind the motel's name indicates a curiosity about local history and perhaps a personal connection or interest in the story behind the establishment. They spend a considerable amount of time, around half an hour, making their best efforts to find relevant information, which shows their dedication to the task. The historical society is a natural choice for this search, as such organizations often serve as repositories for local history, archives, records, and anecdotes. They usually have staff or volunteers who are knowledgeable about the area's past and can assist with research or provide valuable insight into any historical questions or curiosities. The passage also describes the characters' interaction with the woman behind the desk at the historical society, who shares her belief that Mormons are plotting to take over the world. This inclusion serves to add color to the story and provide a snapshot of quirky local beliefs, which might be an element of interest for the characters themselves. After their unsuccessful search at the historical society, the characters continue their day by finding a Mexican restaurant and enjoying a meal. This demonstrates that while they were focused on their original goal of uncovering the story behind the Blue Mist motel, they are also spending time together and experiencing the local culture.

Choices:  - backyard - ribs - restaurant - louisiana - texas  The rationale to choose \\"louisiana\\" as the answer is that: A:","output":"Louisiana is generally known for its good BBQ, although Texas is often considered the king of BBQ. However, the rationale to choose \\"Louisiana\\" as the answer can be based on several factors: 1. Unique Flavor Profile: Louisiana BBQ has a unique flavor profile compared to other BBQ styles. While Texas BBQ is known for its big, bold flavors with little to no sauce, Louisiana BBQ is typically characterized by its complex and slightly spicy sauces with a hint of sweetness. This is because Louisiana has a rich culinary history influenced by French, Spanish, African, and Native American cuisines, which results in a unique BBQ experience. 2. Specialties and Techniques: Louisiana is famous for its low-and-slow cooking method when it comes to BBQ. The state is known for its delicious BBQ pork ribs, which are slow-cooked for hours until they are tender and falling off the bone. Another specialty is their \\"barbecued\\" shrimp, which is actually not barbecued but rather sautéed with spices and served with crusty French bread to soak up the flavorful sauce. 3. BBQ Festivals: Louisiana is home to many yearly, popular BBQ events such as Hogs for the Cause and the Crescent City Blues and BBQ Festival. These events showcase some of the best Louisiana BBQ dishes, where BBQ lovers from across the state and beyond gather to celebrate the local barbecue scene. 4. Gumbo Influence: The Louisiana BBQ scene is also influenced by its famous gumbo culture. Gumbo is a soup-like dish from the region, and its flavors play a significant role in shaping the taste of Louisiana-style BBQ sauces. Gumbo's unique blend of spices, such as cayenne and paprika, bring a different depth of flavor to Louisiana BBQ, which sets it apart from other BBQ styles. 5. Fusion of Tradition and Innovation: Louisiana BBQ is a fusion of traditional barbecue techniques and modern cooking methods. The state's rich culinary history combined with the creative approach of talented local chefs has led to an innovative BBQ scene with unique dishes that you won't find in other areas. Overall, Louisiana's unique cultural influences, diverse range of flavors, and dedication to quality barbecue make it a worthy contender for the title of the delta state known for good BBQ. While Texas may have more widespread recognition when it comes to BBQ, Louisiana's distinct flavors and approach to barbecuing have helped create a delicious and memorable BBQ experience."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Located in the Pacific Ocean, It is lying off the eastern coast of the Asia Mainland (east of China, Korea, Russia) and stretching from the Sea of Okhotsk in the north to the East China Sea and near Taiwan in the southwest.   - Etymology. Rishiri derives its name from the Ainu language, and means \\"high island\\", or \\"island with a high peak\\", a reference to the altitude of Mount Rishiri above sea level.  - China, officially the People's Republic of China (PRC), is a unitary sovereign state in East Asia.

It extends from the Arctic Ocean in the north to the Southern Ocean (or, depending on definition, to Antarctica) in the south and is bounded by Asia and Australia in the west and the Americas in the east.  - History. Hokkaido () was settled by the Ainu, Nivkh, and Orok before recorded history. The \\"Nihon Shoki\\", finished in 720 AD, is often said to be the first mention of Hokkaido in recorded history.

Think like you are answering to a five year old. VIVAH in my opinion is the best movie of 2006, coming from a director that has proved successful throughout his career. I am not too keen in romantic movies these days, because i see them as \\"old wine in a new bottle\\" and so predictable. However, i have watched this movie three times now...and believe me it's an awesome movie. VIVAH goes back to the traditional route, displaying simple characters into a sensible and realistic story of the journey between engagement and marriage. The movie entertains in all manners as it can be reflected to what we do (or would do) when it comes to marriage. In that sense Sooraj R. Barjatya has done his homework well and has depicted a very realistic story into a well-made highly entertaining movie. Several sequences in this movie catch your interest immediately:  * When Shahid Kapoor comes to see the bride (Amrita Rao) - the way he tries to look at her without making it too obvious in front of his and her family. The song 'Do Anjaane Ajnabi' goes well with the mood of this scene. * The first conversation between Shahid and Amrita, when he comes to see her - i.e. a shy Shahid not knowing exactly what to talk about but pulling of a decent conversation. Also Amrita's naive nature, limited eye-contact, shy characteristics and answering softly to Shahid's questions. * The emotional breakdown of Amrita and her uncle (Alok Nath) when she feeds him at Shahid's party in the form of another's daughter-in-law rather than her uncle's beloved niece. Clearly the movie belongs to Amrita Rao all the way. The actress portrays the role of Poonam with such conviction that you cannot imagine anybody else replacing her. She looks beautiful throughout the whole movie, and portrays an innocent and shy traditional girl perfectly. Shahid Kapoor performs brilliantly too. He delivers a promising performance and shows that he is no less than Salman Khan when it comes to acting in a Sooraj R. Barjatya film. In fact Shahid and Amrita make a cute on-screen couple, without a shadow of doubt. Other characters - Alok Nath (Excellent), Anupam Kher (Brilliant), Mohan Joshi (Very good). On the whole, VIVAH delivers what it promised, a well made and realistic story of two families. The movie has top-notch performances, excellent story and great music to suit the film, as well as being directed by the fabulous Sooraj R. Barjatya. It's a must see!

Later at the airport flower shop, while ordering flowers for Lila from Ted, Danny is accosted by employee Linda Mason (Marjorie Reynolds) who recognizes him as a talent agent and begs him for a start in show business.

While this procedure is expensive, this is because it is a surgery that should be done by a board certified plastic surgeon. Unless you can demonstrate to your insurance company that you need a neck lift for a medical reason, it likely will not be covered. A neck lift is not a minor surgery. You will be sedated, and the surgery will generally last two to three hours. Excess skin will be removed around the jaw area, and the surgeon may also alter the muscles to give you the appearance you want. If you have medical issues such as diabetes, alcoholism, heart disease, high blood pressure, or depression, you may not be a good candidate for cosmetic surgery. Additionally, smokers are sometimes not good candidates for cosmetic surgery. As this is a major surgery, you will need to undergo a thorough medical examination. You may have to stop taking certain medications, and if you smoke, you will need to quit. Your doctor will advise you on the risks to be aware of, as well as how to take care of yourself during recovery time.  Before the surgery, you should avoid taking aspirin or other anti-inflammatory drugs because they can cause excess bleeding. Be sure to arrange transportation home from the surgery. As you will undergo general anesthesia, it will not be a good idea to try and drive yourself. As this is an invasive surgery, you will need time to recover. You will likely be asked to refrain from exercising for at least three weeks. During recovery, you may experience discomfort around your jaw. For example, you might experience swelling and bruising, a pulling sensation, tingling, or even burning. As with all surgeries, infection is a risk.

Ten years later, Max's brother volcanologist Trevor Anderson (Brendan Fraser) is visited by Max's son, Trevor's 13-year-old nephew Sean Anderson (Josh Hutcherson). In a box of items that belonged to Max is a book, Journey to the Center of the Earth by Jules Verne. Notes written by Max are found inside the book.

Hannah offers to help them climb the volcano. While the group is hiking up the volcano, a lightning storm forces them to take shelter in a cave.

'Walter Mitty': David Stanton, 67, admitted stealing nearly £250,000 from his mother-in-law. A conman who stole nearly £250,000 from his frail deaf and blind mother-in-law to fund a luxury lifestyle, was today jailed for three years. David Stanton, 68, used money that should have been paying for Fanny Epps' nursing home bills to prop up his struggling business and buy top-of-the range cars and expensive holidays. Mrs Epps, the mother of Stanton's wife Ruth, died in March 2010 at the age of 94. Stanton, of Budleigh Salterton, Devon, admitting stealing £245,209.25p from Mrs Epps between November 2002 and February 2004. The conman,. who has oxygen tubes to help him breathe, also admitted converting. criminal property by funding the purchase of a £45,000 BMW 7 series car. Stanton got his hands on Mrs Epps money after she had a fall at home and it was decided she needed to move into a care home. He was handed control of her affairs and sold her house. But instead of using the money to pay nursing home bills, he kept it for himself. Defence lawyer Lee Bremridge argued that Stanton had actually been paying for his mother-in-law's care and that the amount stolen was £127,600 and not £245,000. But prosecutor Sean Brunton said money was still owed to the nursing home and that there will be a Proceeds of Crime investigation. Stanton's wife of 29 years revealed she has been left. destitute by his life of lies and compared. her ex-husband to Walter Mitty - a fictional ineffective character with. a vivid fantasy life in James Thurber's short story The Secret Life of. Walter Mitty. She even accused him of deliberately losing weight to back up his false claim that he was dying of cancer. Mrs Stanton said: 'I am now 68 and living in a one. bedroom flat. I am now working 12 hour shifts in a nursing home as a. care assistant to pay my rent.' 'I found out that he wasn’t paying any bills, not even on my car insurance. And of course we still owe thousands in fees for my mother’s care. My mother ended up staying in a tiny little room in a nursing home funded by social services. She died aged 94 and I don’t know if she had any idea about all this. 'I took him to court for some closure for my mother. 'He even auctioned furniture from our home where he had a safe. I ended up with just a few personal effects from my first husband who had died a long time ago. 'He is a Walter Mitty. Who knows if he has any money left, who knows if there was another woman. 'When he said he had cancer he deliberately lost weight. But then he later admitted that was not true. He is the most amazing conman.' Deceived: Fanny Epps at her 90th birthday with her daughters Sandra Locke, centre, and wife of David Stanton, Ruth, right. 'My mother had had a fall when she. lived in London. We had to sell her house to pay for her care down in. Devon. David had the Power of Attorney to sell her house. 'He said he had invested it in the money markets and that would pay for her to stay in the nursing home.' 'That’s how it went on, we all. thought he had done what he said he had done. But when I left him I. discovered there was no money. It had all gone along with our business. 'We had six mobility shops around the Westcountry and he had used some of the money to do this. 'But he was just spending, spending,. spending. We were having a very good life, a high life of a round the. world trip to Australia, driving BMW cars and an MG sports car and. living in a beautiful house. He was spending money we did not have. 'He said on paper we were millionaires.' The plundered estate should have been. left to Mrs Epps two daughters - Ruth and Sandra - and. her son, record producer and engineer Stewart Epps, who has worked with. Elton John, Robbie Williams, Oasis, Led Zeppelin, Paul Weller, Bill. Wyman, George Harrison and Jimmy Page. Speaking after her husband was sentenced today, Mrs Stanton said: 'I feel as least some justice for my. mother. If I had had my way it would have gone to trial. I had a lot. more to say, I also wanted justice for my children. But I did not get. the opportunity because he pleaded guilty. 'He said he only has 12 months to. live but there is no medical evidence of that. He has played on that. lots of times in the past. 'He even took out a mortgage in the. name of my handicapped son. So hopefully they feel some justice has been. done for them as well as my mother.' Exeter Crown Court: Judge Barry Cotter QC told David Stanton he should have 'few illusions' about what will happen when he is sentenced. Here is a summary of the highlights for this article:","output":"The article discusses the case of David Stanton, a 68-year-old conman who stole nearly £250,000 from his frail, deaf, and blind mother-in-law, Fanny Epps, to fund his luxurious lifestyle.

Answer by taking a quote from the following article: Rex Ryan and his fraternal twin, Rob, were born in Ardmore, Oklahoma, on December 13, 1962, to Doris and Buddy Ryan. When the boys were aged two, their parents amicably divorced. Following the divorce, their mother attended the University of Chicago to earn her doctorate. Rex, Rob, and their older brother Jim moved with her to Toronto, Ontario, Canada, where she secured an administrative position at the University of Toronto. When his father was hired as the head coach of the Arizona Cardinals in 1994, he offered Rex his first job in the NFL as a defensive assistant, working with the team's linebackers and defensive linemen. After nine straight losing seasons prior to Buddy's arrival, the Cardinals produced an 8-8 record in Buddy's first year as head coach. However, in his second season, the team went 4-12 and subsequently, the entire staff was fired despite the positive performance of the defense.  Ryan went on to coach at three different colleges following his tenure with the Cardinals, though by the time he joined Kansas State in 1999, he was hopeful of a return to the NFL. Ryan received a call from newly named head coach Brian Billick of the Baltimore Ravens, who wanted to interview him for the defensive line coaching position. Having visited a class Ryan was teaching earlier in his career, Billick had been so impressed by Ryan's passion for the game of football that he decided to hire Ryan if he ever attained a head coaching position. When offered the position, Ryan accepted.  In his first year, the defense was ranked second overall in the NFL and second in rushing yards allowed. By his second year, in 2000, the Ravens' defense set NFL records for fewest points allowed and fewest rushing yards allowed. The defense allowed a combined 23 points in four playoff games en route to a Super Bowl XXXV victory, Ryan's only Super Bowl ring, over the New York Giants. The defense consistently performed well in the following years. As a result, Ryan was promoted to defensive coordinator in 2005 following the departure of Mike Nolan, who became the head coach of the San Francisco 49ers. In 2006, Ryan received Assistant Coach of the Year awards from Pro Football Weekly and the Pro Football Writers Association.  Upon the conclusion of the Ravens' 5-11 performance in 2007, the entire staff was dismissed on New Year's Eve. Ryan was one of the candidates interviewed by the Ravens for their head coaching vacancy; however, the Ravens chose to name John Harbaugh as the team's new head coach. Ryan also interviewed with Miami and Atlanta about filling their head coaching vacancies, but the offers went to Tony Sparano and Mike Smith respectively.  Ryan was disappointed by his failure to obtain a head coaching job, but he agreed to return to Baltimore under the direction of Harbaugh, who retained Ryan as defensive coordinator and promoted him to assistant head coach. In 2008, Ryan's final year with the team, the defense was ranked second overall in the NFL. The Ravens lost by a score of 23-14 in the AFC Championship Game against the Pittsburgh Steelers. Ryan's nine-year tenure with the Ravens, during which the defense never ranked lower than sixth overall in the NFL, concluded an hour later when he accepted the head coaching position with the New York Jets. Did the new team successfully coach?","output":"Yes, the new team led by Rex Ryan as the head coach was successful in coaching the New York Jets. In the quoted article, it states that during Ryan's nine-year tenure with the Ravens, the defense never ranked lower than sixth overall in the NFL. When Ryan accepted the head coaching position with the New York Jets, his coaching skills were put to the test. Under Rex Ryan's leadership, the Jets experienced a resurgence in their defensive performance, and the team was successful in improving its overall performance. In his first season as head coach in 2009, Ryan led the Jets to a 9-7 regular-season record and an appearance in the AFC Championship game, where they ultimately lost to the Indianapolis Colts. In the following season, the Jets improved their regular-season record to 11-5 and once again reached the AFC Championship game, this time losing to the Pittsburgh Steelers.  Although the team did not manage to win a Super Bowl during Ryan's tenure as head coach, his impact on the Jets' defense and overall team performance was notable. His coaching abilities helped the New York Jets transition from a struggling franchise to a competitive team in the AFC."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant. You will be given a task.

The statement \\"does little here but point at things that explode into flame\\" seems to suggest that the movie primarily relied on spectacle and special effects to entertain the audience, such as explosions or other visually impressive scenes. The use of the phrase \\"does little here\\" implies that the movie lacked depth or substance, and may not have offered much in terms of storytelling, character development, or any other meaningful aspects that could have made it a more well-rounded and enjoyable film experience. Additionally, by choosing to highlight that the movie only focuses on things that explode into flame, the reviewer may be lamenting the absence of a more engaging plot or rich, emotionally resonant performances from the cast. This is further supported by the negative connotation of the word \\"but\\" in the sentence, which indicates that the reviewer expected more from the movie but was left unsatisfied by what they saw.

Hill farm started installing windbreaks, while Valley farm didn't have the funds to do that so they postponed the project.  But I can use this background: Windbreaks reduce wind velocity over and around crops. This increases yields through reduced drying of the crop and/or by preventing the crop from toppling in strong wind gusts.  What is an answer for this question: Which farm reduced the wind velocity around crops? Answer:","output":"Based on the given situation and background information, Hill farm is the one that reduced the wind velocity around crops. Hill farm took immediate action to address the problem of winds destroying their crops by installing windbreaks. Windbreaks are strategically planted or constructed barriers that have the primary purpose of reducing wind velocities and protecting vulnerable crops from damage and toppling. These measures can include planting rows of trees or shrubs, constructing fences, or other such structures designed to break the force of the wind.  In contrast, Valley farm did not have the necessary funds to implement windbreaks and consequently postponed the project. This means that they have not yet reduced wind velocities around their crops and still have the potential to suffer from further damage and reduced yields.  The installation of windbreaks by Hill farm showed a proactive approach to mitigating the risks associated with wind damage and is expected to result in increased crop yields through the reduced drying of the plants and protection from wind topple. In addition, windbreaks can contribute to creating a more favorable microclimate within the farm by reducing soil erosion, conserving soil moisture, and providing habitats for beneficial insects and wildlife. In conclusion, Hill farm reduced the wind velocity around their crops by implementing windbreaks, which will potentially lead to increased yields and provide additional benefits as well. Valley farm, on the other hand, has not yet taken any action to protect their crops from the damaging effects of strong winds."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Question: I have a new situation: Two space explorers are flying around through an unknown galaxy when they discover two new planets. Given that these planets have no names, the explorers decide to name them after themselves. The planet of Sarahn is currently going through a large geographic shift. Many of the continents on the planet are currently breaking apart and moving. Timon, however, has been a stable planet with no continental moving for quite awhile now.  But I can use this background: At the end of the Proterozoic, the supercontinent Pannotia had broken apart into the smaller continents Laurentia, Baltica, Siberia and Gondwana. During periods when continents move apart, more oceanic crust is formed by volcanic activity. Because young volcanic crust is relatively hotter and less dense than old oceanic crust, the ocean floors rise during such periods. This causes the sea level to rise. Therefore, in the first half of the Paleozoic, large areas of the continents were below sea level.Early Paleozoic climates were warmer than today, but the end of the Ordovician saw a short ice age during which glaciers covered the south pole, where the huge continent Gondwana was situated. Traces of glaciation from this period are only found on former Gondwana. During the Late Ordovician ice age, a few mass extinctions took place, in which many brachiopods, trilobites, Bryozoa and corals disappeared. These marine species could probably not contend with the decreasing temperature of the sea water.The continents Laurentia and Baltica collided between 450 and 400 Ma, during the Caledonian Orogeny, to form Laurussia (also known as Euramerica). Traces of the mountain belt this collision caused can be found in Scandinavia, Scotland, and the northern Appalachians. In the Devonian period (416–359 Ma) Gondwana and Siberia began to move towards Laurussia. The collision of Siberia with Laurussia caused the Uralian Orogeny, the collision of Gondwana with Laurussia is called the Variscan or Hercynian Orogeny in Europe or the Alleghenian Orogeny in North America. The latter phase took place during the Carboniferous period (359–299 Ma) and resulted in the formation of the last supercontinent, Pangaea.By 180 Ma, Pangaea broke up into Laurasia and Gondwana.  What is an answer for this question: Are the volcanoes on Sarahn more or less active than on Timon? Answer:","output":"The volcanoes on Sarahn are likely more active than on Timon. This is because Sarahn is currently going through a large geographic shift with continents breaking apart and moving. This process typically involves the formation of new oceanic crust through volcanic activity, as seen during the periods when ancient continents on Earth, such as Pannotia, broke apart. In contrast, Timon has been a stable planet with no continental moving for quite a while, suggesting less volcanic activity."},{"instruction":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

Context: Recent molecular phylogenetic studies suggest that most placental orders diverged about 100 to 85 million years ago and that modern families appeared in the period from the late Eocene through the Miocene. But paleontologists object that no placental fossils have been found from before the end of the Cretaceous. The earliest undisputed fossils of placentals come from the early Paleocene, after the extinction of the dinosaurs. In particular, scientists have recently identified an early Paleocene animal named Protungulatum donnae as one of the first placental mammals. The earliest known ancestor of primates is Archicebus achilles from around 55 million years ago. This tiny primate weighed 20–30 grams (0.7–1.1 ounce) and could fit within a human palm.

Through gradual expansion, it grew from ruling a small county in that region to the attainment of the rank of king (of Sicily) in 1713. Through its junior branch, the House of Savoy-Carignano, it led the unification of Italy in 1861 and ruled the Kingdom of Italy from 1861 until 1946 and, briefly, the Kingdom of Spain in the 19th century. The Savoyard kings of Italy were Victor Emmanuel II, Umberto I, Victor Emmanuel III, and Umberto II. The last monarch ruled for a few weeks before being deposed following the Constitutional Referendum of 1946, after which the Italian Republic was proclaimed.    What is the relationship between 'beatrice of savoy' and 'italy'? The answer is:","output":"Beatrice of Savoy was a member of the House of Savoy, a prominent royal family that played a significant role in the unification of Italy. The House of Savoy, through its junior branch, the House of Savoy-Carignano, led the unification of Italy in 1861 and ruled the Kingdom of Italy from 1861 until 1946. Therefore, Beatrice of Savoy has an indirect relationship to Italy through her affiliation with the House of Savoy, which contributed to the formation and ruling of the Kingdom of Italy."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

The Priest A:","output":"Title: Shattered Pages Setting: A picturesque but mysterious small coastal town in England, where superstitions and folklores hold great influence over the locals. Main Characters: 1. Grace Thompson: A journalist and an aspiring writer in her late 20's who moves to the coastal town to work on her first novel. 2. Father Donovan: A well-respected and enigmatic local priest, who is hiding a dark secret. 3. Tom Bennett: A kind and introverted historian and librarian who befriends Grace and helps her uncover the truth about the book. 4. Sarah MacDonald: A native of the town, a woman in her late 40's who is the descendant of the witch's bloodline. Plot: Act 1: Grace Thompson, a reporter from London, moves to a small coastal town to start fresh and write her novel. She settles in a quaint old house she rented, which belonged to the late Margaret Black, the town's rumored witch from more than a century ago. In the attic, Grace finds an old, damaged book, believed to contain dark magic practiced by Margaret Black. Act 2: Grace, unable to help her curiosity, starts researching the book's magical contents. She enlists the help of her new friend, Tom Bennett, a local historian and librarian. As they dig deeper into the book, strange, unexplained incidents begin to occur around them. The town's weather becomes erratic, objects move on their own, and whispers from the shadows haunt Grace. In the midst of the chaos, Father Donovan appears at Grace's doorstep and warns her about the consequences of meddling with the book. He reveals that Margaret Black has cursed the book, binding it to her spirit, and that dabbling with the book would unleash an ancient evil. Act 3: Grace, initially skeptical, starts experiencing terrifying nightmares and unexplained cuts on her body. Fearing for her own sanity, she confides in Tom, who researches Margaret Black's story. From his findings, Grace learns about Sarah MacDonald, a local woman descending from witches' bloodline, and seeks her help to break the book's curse. As the town spirals into chaos, Grace, Tom, and Sarah, with the help of Father Donovan, work together to uncover the secrets hidden in the old house, unravel the mystery behind the damaged book, and cleanse the curse that continues to plague the town. Act 4: Grace and her allies discover that Margaret Black wasn't evil, but rather a victim of the priest who ruled the town and wanted power. They come to the chilling realization that Father Donovan, who has been guiding them all along, is a malevolent spirit, possessing the Priest's body and seeking the cursed book's power to sustain his control over the town. Act 5: In a dramatic climax, Grace, Sarah, and Tom confront Father Donovan, who reveals his malevolent intent. With the combined powers of their knowledge, bravery, and witchcraft, they banish the evil spirit from the priest's body and destroy the cursed book, saving the town from perpetual darkness. Epilogue: The town returns to its peaceful state, and the mystery of Margaret Black is finally laid to rest. Grace ultimately finds inspiration for her novel in the harrowing experiences she's had and even develops a romantic connection with Tom. The story concludes with Grace finally finding her place as an accomplished writer, embracing the extraordinary events that led her there."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

This article: Jean Sibelius's Symphony No. 8 was his final major compositional project, occupying him intermittently from the mid-1920s until around 1938, though he never published it. During this time Sibelius was at the peak of his fame, a national figure in his native Finland and a composer of international stature. A fair copy of at least the first movement was made, but how much of the Eighth Symphony was completed is unknown. Sibelius repeatedly refused to release it for performance, though he continued to assert that he was working on it even after he had, according to later reports from his family, burned the score and associated material, probably in 1945. Much of Sibelius's reputation, during his lifetime and subsequently, derived from his work as a symphonist. His Seventh Symphony of 1924 has been widely recognised as a landmark in the development of symphonic form, and at the time there was no reason to suppose that the flow of innovative orchestral works would not continue. However, after the symphonic poem Tapiola, completed in 1926, his output was confined to relatively minor pieces and revisions to earlier works. During the 1930s the Eighth Symphony's premiere was promised to Serge Koussevitzky and the Boston Symphony Orchestra on several occasions, but as each scheduled date approached Sibelius demurred, claiming that the work was not ready for performance. Similar promises made to the British conductor Basil Cameron and to the Finnish Georg Schnéevoigt likewise proved illusory. It is thought that Sibelius's perfectionism and exalted reputation prevented him ever completing the symphony to his satisfaction; he wanted it to be even better than his Seventh. After Sibelius's death in 1957, news of the Eighth Symphony's destruction was made public, and it was assumed that the work had disappeared forever. But in the 1990s, when the composer's many notebooks and sketches were being catalogued, scholars first raised the possibility that fragments of the music for the lost symphony might have survived. Since... contains an answer for the question: What is the last name of the person who was occupied intermittently from the mid 1920s until around 1938?, what is it ?

Let's work together step by step! We have two terms with 'y' in them: -627*y and 151*y. To get all the y's on one side, we can add 627*y to both sides. It becomes: -627*y + 627*y = 151*y - 16338 + 627*y This simplifies to: 0 = 778*y - 16338 Now, we want to get 'y' alone. So, let's add 16,338 to both sides of the equation: 16338 = 778*y Almost done! To get 'y' all by itself, we need to divide both sides of the equation by 778: 16338 / 778 = y This calculation gives us: 21 = y So, our final answer is y = 21. That means, when we multiply 21 with -627 and 151, both sides of the equation become equal. Great job solving the equation!"},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant. User will you give you a task.

Historically, it is regarded as the language of the Israelites and their ancestors, although the language was not referred to by the name Hebrew in the Tanakh. The earliest examples of written Paleo-Hebrew date from the 10th century BCE. Hebrew belongs to the West Semitic branch of the Afroasiatic language family. Hebrew is the only living Canaanite language left, and the only truly successful example of a revived dead language.  Hebrew had ceased to be an everyday spoken language somewhere between 200 and 400 CE, declining since the aftermath of the Bar Kokhba revolt. Aramaic and to a lesser extent Greek were already in use as international languages, especially among elites and immigrants. It survived into the medieval period as the language of Jewish liturgy, rabbinic literature, intra-Jewish commerce, and poetry. Then, in the 19th century, it was revived as a spoken and literary language. It became the \\"lingua franca\\" of Palestine's Jews, and subsequently of the State of Israel.

Austin had acted inappropriately, not only by farting but also by knocking over the plant. Sydney was evidently displeased with this display of poor manners and lack of consideration for others. By reading Austin the riot act, Sydney aimed to confront him about his actions and hold him accountable for the consequences these actions could have on others, such as destroying property and causing discomfort through the smell. Thus, option C, where Sydney reads Austin the riot act for knocking over the plant, provides the best answer according to the context. This option acknowledges the actions Austin committed and presents the appropriate response to his behavior on Sydney's part."},{"instruction":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

In truth, his very presence could be considered proof, since he had been dead earlier that morning, but, as I had not witnessed his revival, he wished me to see the results first hand. At his request, I summoned the chambermaid, while he prepared a syringe of strychnine. I thought he would ask her to procure a hen or some such thing for use in his demonstration however, when she arrived, Dr V-- plunged the syringe into her arm with no warning. I leapt from my chair, but before I could do more than cross the room, the strychnine took effect with results that horrified me.

Question: Generate a question that has the following answer:  to pay their respects  for the following movie plot:  An onscreen text warns of the superstitious belief in a vorvolaka, a malevolent force in human form. The film proper begins during the Balkan Wars of 1912. While his troops are burying their dead, General Pherides (Karloff) and American reporter Oliver Davis (Marc Cramer) visit the Isle of the Dead to pay their respects to the General's long-dead wife. They discover the crypt despoiled; hearing a woman singing on the supposedly uninhabited island, they set out to find her. They also find retired Swiss archeologist Dr. Aubrecht (Jason Robards, Sr.), his Greek housekeeper Madame Kyra (Helen Thimig), British diplomat Mr. St. Aubyn (Alan Napier) and his pale and sickly wife (Katherine Emery), her youthful Greek companion Thea (Ellen Drew), and an English tinsmith. While Aubrecht apologizes for his part 15 years ago in inspiring local peasants to rob graves for valuable Greek artifacts, Kyra whispers to the General that a vorvolaka, in the guise of the red and rosy Thea, is in their midst. The General laughs at such superstition and accepts Aubrecht's invitation to spend the night as his guest. The next morning, the tinsmith is dead. Dr. Drossos (Ernst Deutsch) is summoned; he determines the cause to be septicemic plague and quarantines the island. The Doctor explains how plague is passed and how it may be eradicated in one day if the hot, dry sirocco winds arrive. The archeologist says that Mme. Kyra's explanationÂ â that God sends the plague to punish them for harboring a vorvolakaÂ â makes just as much sense. When Mr. St. Aubyn dies, the General demands that his body be buried immediately, to the horror of the cataleptic Mrs. St. Aubyn, who fears premature burial. Next to die is Dr. Drossos, proving that the advice of modern science does not guarantee victory over the disease. Suspicion returns to Thea, and Kyra harasses her with taunts and threats.

The two sentences, although they both address the topic of productivity, do not provide enough information to definitively determine if the second sentence is true solely based on the truth of the first sentence.  The first sentence discusses productivity in a general and unspecified context. It assumes a 1.5 percent annual increase in productivity through the end of the simulation period, even if investment collapses. However, no specific area or department is mentioned, and it is unclear whether this statement refers to productivity as a whole, including all the departments within the organization, or in a specific context. On the other hand, the second sentence focuses on a particular scenario: productivity in the mailroom. It expects a 1.5 percent annual increase in productivity, but does not provide any information about the external factors or circumstances that could affect this growth. The two sentences share similarities, such as the 1.5 percent annual increase in productivity; however, we cannot assume that the information in the first sentence automatically applies to the mailroom specifically, as mentioned in the second sentence. Additionally, the first sentence expresses the possibility of an investment collapse, while the second sentence does not mention any such scenario. This brings the possibility that the second sentence might be considering conditions without the influence of any investment collapse, making it harder to link the two sentences. In conclusion, it is not possible to tell if the second sentence is true based solely on the information provided in the first sentence. There is not enough context or information about how the assumed 1.5 percent annual increase in productivity in the first sentence applies specifically to the mailroom mentioned in the second sentence, or how external factors like investment collapse are considered in the second sentence."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

The answer to the question: What is the full name of the person who campaigned to remove the inscription from the Monument to the Great Fire of London? is inside the article: Radical rebuilding schemes poured in for the gutted City and were encouraged by Charles. If it had been rebuilt under some of these plans, London would have rivalled Paris in Baroque magnificence (see Evelyn's plan on the right). The Crown and the City authorities attempted to establish \\"to whom all the houses and ground did in truth belong\\" to negotiate with their owners about compensation for the large-scale remodelling that these plans entailed, but that unrealistic idea had to be abandoned. Exhortations to bring workmen and measure the plots on which the houses had stood were mostly ignored by people worried about day-to-day survival, as well as by those who had left the capital; for one thing, with the shortage of labour following the fire, it was impossible to secure workmen for the purpose. Apart from Wren and Evelyn, it is known that Robert Hooke, Valentine Knight, and Richard Newcourt proposed rebuilding plans. With the complexities of ownership unresolved, none of the grand Baroque schemes could be realised for a City of piazzas and avenues; there was nobody to negotiate with, and no means of calculating how much compensation should be paid. Instead, much of the old street plan was recreated in the new City, with improvements in hygiene and fire safety: wider streets, open and accessible wharves along the length of the Thames, with no houses obstructing access to the river, and, most importantly, buildings constructed of brick and stone, not wood. New public buildings were created on their predecessors' sites; perhaps the most famous is St Paul's Cathedral and its smaller cousins, Christopher Wren's 50 new churches. On Charles' initiative, a Monument to the Great Fire of London was erected near Pudding Lane, designed by Christopher Wren and Robert Hooke, standing 61 metres (200 ft) tall and known simply as \\"The Monument\\".

You must generate a detailed and long answer. Multi-choice problem: Choose from the options at the end, and answer how do you do this: projector Choose your answer from: [1]. is way to  display phone calls [2]. is way to  show film of phone calls","output":"Option 2 is the correct answer, as a projector is a way to show films and other visual content, including phone calls recorded in video format. Therefore, I will explain how to set up a projector to display a film of phone calls. 1. Choose and set up the projector: First, select a projector that meets your requirements based on factors such as brightness, resolution, and connectivity. Set up the projector in a location where it will project a clear image onto a screen, wall, or any other flat surface without any obstructions. 2. Connect the projector to a playback device: Depending on the type of projector you have, there are different ways to connect it to a device that can play the film of phone calls. You may connect the projector to a computer, laptop, smartphone/tablet, or media player using HDMI, VGA, USB, or any other appropriate cable provided by the manufacturer. 3. Audio setup: If your film of phone calls includes audio, you will need an audio setup. Some projectors have built-in speakers, in which case you just need to ensure the volume is set to an appropriate level. However, if your projector does not have built-in speakers, you will need to connect it to an external audio system such as a soundbar, home theater system, or a simple set of computer speakers. 4. Content playback: Once connected, open the film of phone calls on your playback device. While playing the content, make sure that the projector settings, such as aspect ratio, resolution, and brightness, are optimized for the best viewing experience. 5. Adjust the focus and image size: Once the film is displayed on the screen or wall, adjust the projector's focus and zoom controls to ensure the picture is sharp and clear. You can make the image larger or smaller by moving the projector closer to or farther away from the projection surface. Keep in mind that the distance to the surface affects the image quality, so strive for a balance between size and image clarity. 6. Control the room lighting: The darker the room, the better the image quality projected by the projector. Turn off unnecessary lights and close curtains or blinds to minimize ambient light.

Vijay Dhondopant Tendulkar was born on 6 January 1928 in Girgaon, Mumbai, Maharashtra, where his father held a clerical job and ran a small publishing business. The literary environment at home prompted young Vijay to take up writing. He wrote his first story at age six. He grew up watching western plays and felt inspired to write plays himself. Tendulkar began his career writing for newspapers. He had already written a play, Amcyavar Kon Prem Karnar (aamcyaavrr konn prem krnnaar Who will Love us?), and he wrote the play, Grhastha (The Householder), in his early 20s. The latter did not receive much recognition from the audience, and he vowed never to write again.  Breaking the vow, in 1956 he wrote Srimant, which established him as a good writer. Srimant jolted the conservative audience of the times with its radical storyline, wherein an unmarried young woman decides to keep her unborn child while her rich father tries to \\"buy\\" her a husband in an attempt to save his social prestige.  Tendulkar's early struggle for survival and living for some time in tenements (\\"cal/chawls\\") in Mumbai provided him first-hand experience about the life of urban lower middle class. He thus brought new authenticity to their depiction in Marathi theatre. Tendulkar's writings rapidly changed the storyline of modern Marathi theatre in the 1950s and the 60s, with experimental presentations by theatre groups like Rangayan. Actors in these theatre groups like Shriram Lagoo, Mohan Agashe, and Sulabha Deshpande brought new authenticity and power to Tendulkar's stories while introducing new sensibilities in Marathi theatre.  Tendulkar wrote the play Gidhade (The Vultures) in 1961, but it was not produced until 1970. The play was set in a morally collapsed family structure and explored the theme of violence. In his following creations, Tendulkar explored violence in its various forms: domestic, sexual, communal, and political. Thus, Gidhade proved to be a turning point in Tendulkar's writings with regard to establishment of his own unique writing style.  Based on a 1956 short story, Die Panne (\\"Traps\\") by Friedrich Durrenmatt, Tendulkar wrote the play, Santata! Court Calu Ahe (\\"Silence! The Court Is in Session\\"). It was presented on the stage for the first time in 1967 and proved as one of his finest works. Satyadev Dubey presented it in movie form in 1971 with Tendulkar's collaboration as the screenplay writer.

Please answer the following question: Give me a possible correct answer to the question \\"what government type is north korea?\\" A:","output":"A: The government type of North Korea is a \\"single-party totalitarian dictatorship\\" characterized by a centralized and highly authoritarian rule. North Korea, officially known as the Democratic People's Republic of Korea (DPRK), is governed by the Workers' Party of Korea (WPK) with Kim Jong-un serving as the Supreme Leader of the country. The political system is built upon the principles of Juche, an ideology emphasizing self-reliance, independence, and strong national defense, which was formulated by the country's founding leader, Kim Il-sung. In this single-party totalitarian dictatorship, the supreme leader wields absolute power over the government, military, and every aspect of society. The government tends to exercise strict control over the economy, media, and education, severely limiting the flow of information and freedom of expression. There is also an extensive security apparatus put in place to suppress any dissent or perceived threats to the regime. The North Korean political structure includes several institutions that support and reinforce the ultimate authority of the supreme leader. Some of these institutions are: 1. Workers' Party of Korea (WPK): The primary political institution, the WPK serves as the ruling party with the supreme leader as its head. All major decisions are made through the WPK, and it controls all other institutions in the country. 2. Supreme People's Assembly (SPA): The unicameral legislature of North Korea, the SPA consists of deputies elected every five years. However, the elections are largely a formality, as the candidates are pre-selected by the WPK, and there is often only one candidate for each position. 3. National Defense Commission (NDC): Overseeing the armed forces, the NDC is responsible for implementing defense policies and ensuring the military's loyalty to the regime. The supreme leader, who serves as the chairman, holds ultimate control over the commission. 4. Cabinet: Responsible for implementing policies and managing the country's economy and administration, the cabinet is composed of ministers and officials appointed by the supreme leader. Despite having a constitution that mentions democratic principles, in reality, the political system of North Korea lacks any actual democratic processes. The power is highly centralized, and the population is subjected to pervasive propaganda, indoctrination, and surveillance to maintain regime stability and control. In summary, North Korea's government type can be accurately described as a single-party totalitarian dictatorship, with the supreme leader exercising absolute authority over all aspects of the state and society through the domination of the Workers' Party of Korea and an elaborate system of control."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Back to his past: Lester Stiggers was arrested in 1965 for murder but has been out of prison since 1971 because of the former Governor of Michigan's ruling in his favor. When he was granted a five-day leave from prison for good behavior, he headed to Michigan, where his mother lived. He's been there ever since - thanks to the then-governor of Michigan who, in 1971, refused to send him back to Arkansas and its notorious prison system. Enforcing the law: After Stiggers was discovered recently, Arkansas Governor Mike Beebe ordered him to be sent back to the state to serve his time. Arkansas Governor Mike Beebe on Wednesday defended his request to have the elderly fugitive returned in spite of his poor health. ‘I'm an invalid now. I'm half dead. What would their interest be to have me back?’ Stiggers said. Beebe told The Associated Press he wasn't aware of Lester Stiggers' health issues when he sought to have him brought back to the Arkansas prison system, but that will not make him revoke his request. 'We can't pick and choose which laws that we like and which laws that we don't like,' Beebe told the AP. 'And. once the Department of Correction was given information about his. whereabouts, and... they requested me to sign an extradition warrant,. then that's my duty and that's the law and that's what we did.' The AP recently found Stiggers living in a one-bedroom apartment along a busy road in the Detroit suburb of Warren, Michigan. He gets by on 700 a month in Social Security benefits, usually making trips outside only to see a doctor. His life now: Stiggers is 63-years-old, in poor health, and lives with his companion Delphine Hopkins in a small apartment in Warren, Michigan. He is seen holding Ms Hopkins' granddaughter in this photo. He needs an inhaler and 10 pills a day for his diabetes, high blood pressure and other ailments. A stocky man with thick arms, Stiggers grappled with sewer lines as a plumber until two strokes ended his working days and made his speech difficult to understand. He was astounded to learn that Arkansas has renewed its efforts to bring him back to prison - more than four decades after then-Governor William Milliken blocked the state's initial request. At the time, Milliken wrote that the notorious Arkansas prison system was a form of ‘cruel and unusual punishment’. 'No purpose would be served now by sending that man back,' the former governor told the Associated Press. Now 91-years-old, Mr Milliken said that. he does not remember Stigger's case specifically but the move to allow. the young black man to stay in the midwestern state does seem fitting. Then and now: Former Michigan governor William Milliken, seen in 1978 at left and 2008 at right, initially allowed Stiggers to stay in his state because the Arkansas prison system was notorious at the time. 'Knowing how distressed I was about the shameful state of race relations in our country, I would have wanted to give that man another chance,' he said. Beebe, a Democrat, sent a letter this year to Republican Michigan Governor Rick Snyder, seeking Stiggers after his Social Security benefits put him back on Arkansas' radar. State prison officials said they didn't know that Stiggers was sick, either, but Department of Correction spokeswoman Shea Wilson told the AP that it's not the agency's role to make judgments about whether Stiggers should be brought back to Arkansas. 'It's our job to carry out the mandates of the court,' Wilson said. 'And that's simply what we're doing in our efforts to seek him.' Sara Wurfel, a spokeswoman for Snyder, said the matter was still under review and 'there's not currently a timeframe for when that may be concluded.'

This heroine also had to work for a living (she was a teacher), and had a very giving heart. She is shadowed by a horrific past and her youthful innocence was shattered by war atrocities. The hero is conflicted by his own past as well, and develops a sympathy for this not-so-beautiful- on-the-outside young woman.

His father was a blacksmith and the family lived ten miles southwest in Dublin until 1921, when they moved 70 miles (112 km) northeast to Fort Worth. When Hogan was nine years old in 1922, his father Chester committed suicide with a self-inflicted gunshot at the family home. By some accounts, Chester committed suicide in front of him, which some (including Hogan biographer James Dodson) have cited as the cause of his introverted personality in later years.  The family incurred financial difficulties after his father's suicide, and the children took jobs to help their seamstress mother make ends meet. Older brother Royal quit school at age 14 to deliver office supplies by bicycle, and nine-year-old Ben sold newspapers after school at the nearby train station. A tip from a friend led him to caddying at the age of 11 at Glen Garden Country Club, a nine-hole course seven miles (11 km) to the south. One of his fellow caddies at Glen Garden was Byron Nelson, later a tour rival. The two would tie for the lead at the annual Christmas caddie tournament in December 1927, when both were 15. Nelson sank a 30-foot putt to tie on the ninth and final hole. Instead of sudden death, they played another nine holes; Nelson sank another substantial putt on the final green to win by a stroke.  The following spring, Nelson was granted the only junior membership offered by the members of Glen Garden. Club rules did not allow caddies age 16 and older, so after August 1928, Hogan took his game to three scrubby daily-fee courses: Katy Lake, Worth Hills, and Z-Boaz.

In his lifetime, Ray had done a number of things for which he was not proud, things he'd like to see just as well stuffed down a dark hole. Everybody had things of which they were ashamed. Everybody has committed their share of sins that they wish they could take back. But this wasn't one of them, and he resented the implication that it was -- the implication that someone would dare to judge him for something they did not fully understand. It was a good thing, a right thing, like the time he had given emergency CPR to the woman already ten minutes dead and gone, the woman whose mouth tasted of chocolate death and scrambled eggs, just to spare her horrified children the sense of helplessness while waiting for the ambulance to arrive. That had been a noble thing like this one was. Should have been. Perhaps it was always less difficult to have things fail here, with the living, than it was with the dead. The dead had no opinions, no agendas. They weren't sensitive. The dead did what you fucking told them to do and didn't complain. Right? The living simply did not understand that there were rules. They didn't want to understand something so banal. Someone who didn't take the time to understand the rules had no right to pass judgment on him. Not that it ever stopped them. \\"I hear that you are unhappy,\\" he said into the phone, then had to pull the receiver away from his ear so the woman on the other end could scream at him some more.

One is expected to show up on time, sometimes dress to certain standards and bring one or many bottles of wine as a thoughtful gift to the hosts.

But a lot of the damage is caused by storm surge. Storm surge is very high water located in the low pressure eye of the hurricane. The very low pressure of the eye allows the water level to rise above normal sea level. Storm surge can cause flooding when it reaches land ( Figure below ). High winds do a great deal of damage in hurricanes. High winds can also create very big waves. If the large waves are atop a storm surge, the high water can flood the shore. If the storm happens to occur at high tide, the water will rise even higher.  and the situation: Two coastal cities, Dune and Shore, got a Hurricane warning. The hurricane hit Dune city, but missed Shore city by 50 miles. The damage was horrendous.  Answer the following question: Which city experienced a higher atmospheric pressure? A:","output":"Shore city experienced a higher atmospheric pressure during the hurricane event compared to Dune city. To understand the reasons behind this, it's essential to look at some factors and concepts related to hurricanes. A hurricane is a large and intense storm system characterized by a cyclonic circulation, and it has a low-pressure center called the \\"eye.\\" The eye of the hurricane is surrounded by the eye wall, a ring of towering thunderstorms where the most severe weather and highest winds occur. The barometric pressure at the eye is the lowest compared to the rest of the storm. When a hurricane makes landfall, as it did in Dune city, the eye of the storm passes directly over the affected area, causing the atmospheric pressure to be at its lowest within the city limits. This low pressure is associated with storm surges, heavy rainfall, and damaging high winds. On the other hand, Shore city was 50 miles away from the direct impact of the hurricane. Therefore, it did not experience the lowest pressure associated with the eye of the storm. As the distance from the eye increases, the atmospheric pressure gradually rises. Consequently, Shore city had a higher atmospheric pressure than Dune city during the hurricane event. It is crucial to note that even though Shore city experienced a higher atmospheric pressure than Dune city, it may still have been subjected to some adverse weather conditions like gusty winds, heavy rainfall, and coastal flooding caused by the distant hurricane. However, the extent of these effects would have been significantly less severe than the conditions experienced in Dune city."},{"instruction":"Detailed Instructions: You are given a sentence in Italian.

How long does meth say in your urine? How long does it take for meth to not show in a UA if smoked? Choose your answer. Are these two questions paraphrases of each other? Possible answers: (1). no (2). yes","output":"(2). yes These two questions are indeed paraphrases of each other, as they both inquire about the duration it takes for methamphetamine (meth) to become undetectable in a urine analysis (UA) after smoking. Each question is essentially asking the same information but with slightly different phrasing. Methamphetamine, also known as meth, crystal, or ice, is a potent and highly addictive central nervous system stimulant. It can cause a wide range of physical and psychological effects, and is abused for its euphoric and stimulating properties. When someone uses meth, it is metabolized in their body and eventually eliminated through urine. Therefore, urine drug tests or urine analysis (UA) are commonly used to detect the presence of meth in a person's system. The detection time of meth in your urine primarily depends on several factors, including the dosage, individual metabolism, frequency of use, body mass, and overall health. The average time frame for meth to remain in the urine is between 3 to 5 days after last use for occasional users, while habitual users may test positive for up to 7 to 10 days or even longer. However, these numbers are not set in stone, as individual factors can significantly influence detection times. In general, when a person uses meth, the drug starts to metabolize in their system and gets eliminated through their urine as they detoxify. The kidneys filter out toxins from the blood, and some of these toxins, like drug metabolites, get excreted in the urine. Meth has a half-life of around 12 hours for most people, meaning it takes approximately 12 hours for the concentration of the drug to be reduced by half. However, individual metabolic rates can significantly impact the speed at which this process occurs. Urine tests for meth target a major meth metabolite called amphetamine, which may be present in the body even after the effects of meth have worn off. Urine tests can typically detect this metabolite within a couple of hours after use, up to several days, or even weeks for long-term, heavy users. Factors that may affect detection times include: 1. Dosage: Higher doses of meth will generally result in a longer detection time because a larger amount of the drug is present in the body. 2. Frequency of use: Frequent users often have higher concentrations of the drug accumulated within their system, increasing the detection time. 3. Individual metabolism: Some people's bodies process and eliminate drugs faster than others due to differences in genetics and metabolism. 4. Body mass: Individuals with higher body fat content may retain meth in their bodies longer than those with lower body fat levels. 5. Overall health: A person's overall health, including kidney and liver function, can affect how quickly meth is metabolized and eliminated from the body. In conclusion, the duration of meth detectability in urine varies from one person to another, depending on several factors. If you believe you or someone you know may be struggling with a methamphetamine addiction, it is essential to seek professional help from a healthcare provider or a rehabilitation center to assess the situation and provide adequate support."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Radiation therapy requires multiple visits, but the advantage is that it is not invasive like surgery (i.e. it does not require cutting into you to remove the cancer). There are two types of radiation that are commonly used to treat cervical cancer. The first is called external beam radiation therapy (EBRT), in which the radioactive beams are emitted from a source outside your body and directed toward your cervix and the surrounding area. The second type of radiation therapy is called brachytherapy — rods containing radiation are inserted through the vagina up against the cervix. They are then left there for one to two days and emit local radiation which works to treat the cervical cancer. This is done in the hospital.  Again, the extent of radiation as well as the effectiveness of this mode of treatment depends upon the stage and severity of your cervical cancer. Radiation treatment can have significant side effects. EBRT may cause fatigue, upset stomach, diarrhea, skin damage, bladder discomfort, vaginal pain, anemia, and menstrual changes (including early menopause). Brachytherapy may cause irritation of the vagina and vulva. Fatigue, diarrhea, nausea, irritation of the bladder, and low blood counts may also occur.  Long-term effects of radiation treatment may include vaginal scarring, which may make vaginal sex painful. You may also experience vaginal dryness, swelling of the legs, and it may weaken your bones. Radiation is most commonly combined with chemotherapy. This is because, for cervical cancer, the combination of radiation and chemotherapy is synergistic and provides significant additional benefit (rather than simply opting for one or the other). When chemotherapy is combined with radiation, as described above, it is termed \\"chemoradiation.\\" This can be a very effective mode of treatment, because the chemotherapy has what is called a \\"sensitizing effect\\" on the tissues on and around the cervix. What this means is that the tissues then become more susceptible to the radiation, and it is as such that the combined modality of treatment gains its synergistic effect. Unfortunately, many of the most effective methods for treating cervical cancer can have deleterious effects on one's future ability to have children. As a result, your doctor may recommend that you freeze some of your eggs prior to undergoing treatment such as radiation, so that the eggs do not become damaged due to the treatment. Most women will need to have a surrogate carry the pregnancy if they freeze their eggs. Summary:","output":"Radiation therapy is a way to treat cancer without surgery. It uses special beams or rods that give off energy to kill the bad cells. You may feel tired, have an upset tummy, or have some pain from this treatment, but it can help get rid of the cancer. Sometimes, doctors use radiation therapy with other medicines to make it work even better. But, this treatment might make it harder to have a baby later, so talk to your doctor about saving some of your eggs before the treatment starts."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Alec and Jenny go to his laboratory at the University, and find him and his assistant, Paisley (Ben Wright), feverishly experimenting on that same piece of lava. Lindenbrook shows Alec that he has chipped away a fragment of the lava and uncovered a manmade object inside, marked with three grooves or notches. He is about to melt off the rest of the lava to discover what it might be. Tired and distracted, Paisley pours in too much fuel at that moment, and the stove explodes. In the aftermath, Lindenbrook finds that the lava has been blasted free of the object, and it is revealed to be a surveyor's plumb bob with a few Nordic words painfully scratched on it. Lindenbrook and Alec recognize the signature with wonder: Arne Saknussem, a brilliant but eccentric Icelandic scientist, who had disappeared many years earlier while exploring the volcanoes of his homeland.Two weeks later, the Dean and the Rector of the University (Alan Napier and Alan Caillou) call at Lindenbrook's home to ask why he's neglecting his teaching duties.

Alecia Beth Moore (born September 8, 1979), known professionally as Pink (often stylized as P!nk), is an American singer, songwriter, dancer and actress. She was signed to her first record label with original R&B girl group, Choice, in 1995. The label, LaFace Records, saw great potential in Pink, offering her a solo deal. Choice disbanded in 1998. It was announced in February 2016 that Pink will cover a Beatles song, \\"Lucy in the Sky with Diamonds\\", for the upcoming Netflix original series Beat Bugs. In the same month, it was announced that she had recorded a cover of \\"White Rabbit\\" for the movie Alice Through the Looking Glass, while in April it was revealed that she contributed the song \\"Just like Fire\\" to the soundtrack of the movie. In Australia, it topped the ARIA Charts. The following July, it was announced that Pink had written a song for French-Canadian singer Celine Dion called \\"Recovering\\" for inclusion on her upcoming English-language album. Pink provided guest vocals on country singer Kenny Chesney's single \\"Setting the World on Fire\\" which was released on August 1, 2016. The single topped on the Billboard Hot Country Songs and went platinum in the United States and Canada. On March 10, 2017, Pink teamed up with Stargate and Australian star Sia on the former's debut single, \\"Waterfall\\".  Pink took a break to write songs for her upcoming seventh album. In June 2017, Pink confirmed that she is making her next studio album. On July 17, 2017, she announced via her official Twitter account that the video shoot for the first single will take place the following week. \\"What About Us\\", the lead single from Pink's seventh studio album, Beautiful Trauma, was released on August 10, 2017 and reached number one in Australia. The album was released on October 13, 2017. On August 27, 2017, Pink received the Michael Jackson Video Vanguard Award at the MTV Video Music Awards. She also performed a medley of some of her hits, including her new single, \\"What About Us\\", before accepting the award, which was presented to her by Ellen DeGeneres. \\"What About Us\\" reached number one on the Adult Pop Songs chart, earning Pink her ninth leader on the chart, breaking her out of a tie with Katy Perry for the solo female artist with the most number-ones in the chart's history and placing her in second place amongst all acts. \\"Beautiful Trauma\\" was released on November 21, 2017, as the second single from Beautiful Trauma to less commercial success, reaching top thirty in Australia, the United Kingdom, France, and Scotland. Although it only managed to peak at number seventy-eight on the Billboard Hot 100, it topped on the Billboard Dance Club Songs chart. On December 5, 2017, Hip-hop artist Eminem revealed that Pink would be collaborating on the song \\"Need Me\\" for his ninth studio album Revival.  Although sick with influenza, Pink sang the United States national anthem before the 2018 Super Bowl, a dream she had since, as a child, seeing Whitney Houston sing at Super Bowl XXV in 1991. On March 1, 2018, Pink started her seventh concert tour, the Beautiful Trauma World Tour, which is scheduled to visit North America and Oceania until September 8, 2018.Answer this question using a quote from the following article: What else was she known for?","output":"Pink is known for her powerful and distinctive voice, her acrobatic live performances, and her rebellious, edgy image.

Make this proper case.","output":"Long considered to be extinct, the discovery of the tassel tail in 1938 stunned the scientific community. Scientists managed to catch a live specimen of this extraordinary creature and subsequently named it Latimeria, in honor of its discoverer, Mrs. Latimer. This event demonstrated the incompleteness of human knowledge about the natural world and its inhabitants. The story of the Latimeria's discovery is fascinating, as it initially began with a group of fishermen who happened upon a strange-looking fish. Lacking the appropriate scientific expertise, they were nevertheless able to recognize it as something unusual and decided to bring it to the attention of local experts. It was due to their keen instincts and willingness to share their findings that Mrs. Latimer, a prominent ichthyologist at the time, had the opportunity to examine the fish up close. Upon further study, Mrs. Latimer concluded that this mysterious creature was indeed a living member of a species long believed to have vanished from Earth. Its unique morphology and physiology resembled ancient life forms which had once thrived during the Devonian period. Consequently, it was assigned to the class Sarcopterygii, which includes lobe-finned fishes and their evolutionary descendants such as the tetrapods. The discovery of the Latimeria, or the \\"coelacanth\\" as it is more commonly known, shook the foundations of evolutionary biology and eventually led to groundbreaking advancements in our understanding of the aquatic and terrestrial branches of the Tree of Life. Moving on to another fascinating creature, the salamander, we can see that they share a common ancestry with newts, collectively classified under the order Caudata or Urodela within the class of amphibians. Salamanders, with their long, slender bodies and short limbs, bear a striking resemblance to their newt cousins and both groups are primarily characterized by their unique ability to regenerate lost limbs and other body parts. This astonishing capability of regeneration continues to captivate scientists, who are tirelessly working to unlock the genetic secrets behind this incredible process. Undeniably, the realm of biology is brimming with constant discoveries, surprises, and opportunities to expand our knowledge about the immense diversity of life on this planet. The stories of the Latimeria and the salamander serve as prime examples of such revelations, reminding us that the more we learn about the natural world, the more we realize just how much there is left to uncover."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Given the paragraph above, please answer correctly the following question:   Which town has more people that caught the flu?  Hint: Many respiratory diseases are caused by pathogens. A pathogen is an organism that causes disease in another organism. Certain bacteria, viruses, and fungi are pathogens of the respiratory system. The common cold and flu are caused by viruses. The influenza virus that causes the flu is pictured below ( Figure below ). Tuberculosis, whooping cough, and acute bronchitis are caused by bacteria. The pathogens that cause colds, flu, and TB can be passed from person to person by coughing, sneezing, and spitting. Illnesses caused by bacteria can be treated with antibiotics. Those caused by viruses cannot. Answer:","output":"Based on the information provided in the paragraph, it is not possible to definitively determine which town has more people that caught the flu. The paragraph mentions that Birch town's population was affected by viral respiratory diseases, while Free town's population caught bacterial respiratory diseases.

Since Birch town was affected by viral respiratory diseases, it is possible that some of those affected people may have caught the flu. On the other hand, Free town's population caught bacterial respiratory diseases, which do not include the flu. Despite the fact that Birch town residents were affected by viral respiratory diseases, which could include the flu, there is not enough information provided in the paragraph to accurately compare and determine which town has more people that caught the flu.

Ignoring his pleas, the activists release a chimp, which infects a female activist. She then attacks and infects everyone else present. 28 days later, in London, Jim (Cillian Murphy), a bicycle courier, awakens from a coma in St Thomas' Hospital. He finds the entire hospital deserted. He wanders the streets of London, finding it deserted as well, with signs of catastrophe everywhere. Jim enters a church and finds a priest, who turns out to be infected. Jim flees, attracting attention of more infected, but Selena (Naomie Harris) and Mark (Noah Huntley) rescue him. At one of their safehouses, they explain to Jim that while he was in a coma, a virus spread among the populace, resulting in societal collapse. They claim the virus has been reported in Paris and New York City as well, suggesting the infection has spread worldwide. The next day, Selena and Mark accompany Jim to his parents' house in Deptford, where he discovers they committed suicide in bed together. That night, the three are attacked by more infected.

Background: Edgar Yipsel \\"Yip\\" Harburg (born Isidore Hochberg, Yiddish: ysydvr hvkbrg; April 8, 1896 - March 5, 1981) was an American popular song lyricist who worked with many well-known composers. He wrote the lyrics to the standards \\"Brother, Can You Spare a Dime?\\" Context: Harburg, the youngest of four surviving children (out of ten), was born Isidore Hochberg on the Lower East Side of New York City on April 8, 1896. His parents, Lewis Hochberg and Mary Ricing, were Yiddish-speaking Orthodox Jews who had emigrated from Russia.  He later adopted the name Edgar Harburg, and came to be best known as Edgar \\"Yip\\" Harburg. He attended Townsend Harris High School, where he and Ira Gershwin, who met over a shared fondness for Gilbert and Sullivan, worked on the school paper and became lifelong friends. According to his son Ernie Harburg, Gilbert and Irish dramatist George Bernard Shaw taught his father, a \\"democratic socialist, [and] sworn challenger of all tyranny against the people, that 'humor is an act of courage' and dissent\\".  After World War I, Harburg returned to New York and graduated from City College (later part of the City University of New York), which Ira Gershwin had initially attended with him, in 1921. After Harburg married and had two children, he started writing light verse for local newspapers. He became a co-owner of Consolidated Electrical Appliance Company, but the company went bankrupt following the crash of 1929, leaving Harburg \\"anywhere from 50,000 - 70,000 in debt,\\" which he insisted on paying back over the course of the next few decades. At this point, Harburg and Ira Gershwin agreed that Harburg should start writing song lyrics.  Gershwin introduced Harburg to Jay Gorney, who collaborated with him on songs for an Earl Carroll Broadway review (Earl Carroll's Sketchbook): the show was successful and Harburg was engaged as lyricist for a series of successful revues, including Americana in 1932, for which he wrote the lyrics of \\"Brother, Can You Spare a Dime?\\" to the tune of a lullaby Gorney had learned as a child in Russia. This song swept the nation, becoming an anthem of the Great Depression.  Harburg was a staunch critic of religion and an atheist. He wrote a poem entitled \\"Atheist\\" that summarized his views on god and religion. Question: What was the first song he wrote?. Whats the answer?","output":"The first song that Edgar \\"Yip\\" Harburg wrote is not explicitly mentioned in the given information. However, it is clear that his career as a lyricist took off after agreeing with Ira Gershwin and being introduced to Jay Gorney. One of their early collaborations was working on songs for an Earl Carroll Broadway revue called Earl Carroll's Sketchbook. Although it might not be the first song he wrote, the most notable early work in his career is the song \\"Brother, Can You Spare a Dime?\\" which he wrote the lyrics for in 1932, as part of the revue Americana. This song became an anthem of the Great Depression and propelled Harburg's career as a successful lyricist."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant that follows instruction extremely well.

Little is known for certain of Josquin's early life. Much is inferential and speculative, though numerous clues have emerged from his works and the writings of contemporary composers, theorists, and writers of the next several generations. Josquin was born in the area controlled by the Dukes of Burgundy, and was possibly born either in Hainaut (modern-day Belgium), or immediately across the border in modern-day France, since several times in his life he was classified legally as a Frenchman (for instance, when he made his will). Josquin was long mistaken for a man with a similar name, Josquin de Kessalia, born around the year 1440, who sang in Milan from 1459 to 1474, dying in 1498. More recent scholarship has shown that Josquin des Prez was born around 1450 or a few years later, and did not go to Italy until the early 1480s.Around 1466, perhaps on the death of his father, Josquin was named by his uncle and aunt, Gille Lebloitte dit Desprez and Jacque Banestonne, as their heir. Their will gives Josquin's actual surname as Lebloitte. According to Matthews and Merkley, \\"des Prez\\" was an alternative name.According to an account by Claude Hémeré, a friend and librarian of Cardinal Richelieu whose evidence dates as late as 1633, and who used the records of the collegiate church of Saint-Quentin, Josquin became a choirboy with his friend and colleague the Franco Flemish composer Jean Mouton at Saint-Quentin's royal church, probably around 1460. Doubt has been cast on the accuracy of Hémeré's account, however. Josquin may have studied counterpoint under Ockeghem, whom he greatly admired throughout his life: this is suggested both by the testimony of Gioseffo Zarlino and Lodovico Zacconi, writing later in the 16th century, and by Josquin's eloquent lament on the death of Ockeghem in 1497, Nymphes des bois/Requiem aeternam, based on the poem by Jean Molinet.

Though Western nations were slow to accept the assault rifle concept after World War II, by the end of the 20th century they had become the standard weapon in most of the world's armies, replacing semi-automatic rifles, battle rifles and sub-machine guns in most roles. Examples include the StG 44, AK-47 and the M16 rifle.  - Vladimir Oblast (\\"Vladimirskaya oblast\\") is a federal subject of Russia (an oblast). Its administrative center is the city of Vladimir, which is located east of Moscow. As of the 2010 Census, the oblast's population was 1,443,693.  - The AK-47, or AK as it is officially known (also known as the Kalashnikov) is a selective-fire (semi-automatic and automatic), gas-operated 7.62×39 mm assault rifle, developed in the Soviet Union by Mikhail Kalashnikov. It is officially known in the Soviet documentation as \\"Avtomat Kalashnikova\\".  - The AK-74 (Russian: or \\"Kalashnikov automatic rifle model 1974\\") is an assault rifle developed in the early 1970s by Russian designer Mikhail Kalashnikov as the replacement for the earlier AKM (itself a refined version of the AK-47). It uses a smaller 5.45×39mm cartridge, replacing the 7.62×39mm chambering of earlier Kalashnikov-pattern weapons.  - The AEK - 971 is a Soviet / Russian selective fire assault rifle that was developed at the Kovrov Mechanical Plant ( KMZ ) by chief designer Sergey Koksharov in the late 1970s and 1980s . The primary model , the AEK - 971 , uses the 5.45 × 39mm round fed from standard 30 - round or larger box magazines used by the AK - 74 , AK - 74M , and similar weapons .  - The 5.45×39mm cartridge is a rimless bottlenecked rifle cartridge. It was introduced into service in 1974 by the Soviet Union for use with the new AK-74 assault rifle. It gradually supplemented, then largely replaced the 7.62×39mm round in service.  - Nizhny Novgorod, colloquially shortened to Nizhny, is a city in the administrative center of Nizhny Novgorod Oblast and Volga Federal District in Russia. From 1932 to 1990, it was known as Gorky, after the writer Maxim Gorky, who was born there. The city is an important economic, transportation, scientific, educational and cultural center in Russia and the vast Volga-Vyatka economic region, and is the main center of river tourism in Russia. In the historical part of the city there are a large number of universities, theaters, museums and churches. Nizhny Novgorod is located about 400 km east of Moscow, where the Oka empties into the Volga. Population:   - An intermediate cartridge is a rifle/carbine cartridge that is less powerful than typical full-power battle rifle cartridges, such as the .303 British, 7.62×54mmR, 7.92×57mm Mauser or .30-06 Springfield, but still has significantly longer effective range than pistol cartridges. As their recoil is significantly reduced compared to high power rifle cartridges, fully automatic rifles firing intermediate cartridges are relatively easy to control. However, even though less powerful than a traditional rifle cartridge, the ballistics are still sufficient for an effective range of , which are the maximum typical engagement ranges in modern combat. This allowed for the development of the assault rifle, a selective fire weapon that is more compact and lighter than rifles that fire full power cartridges. The first intermediate cartridge to see widespread service was the German 7.92×33mm Kurz used in the StG 44. Other notable examples include the Soviet 7.62×39mm used in the AK-47 and AKM series, and the American 5.56×45mm NATO cartridge first used in the M16.  - A machine gun is a fully automatic mounted or portable firearm, designed to fire bullets in quick succession from an ammunition belt or magazine, typically at a rate of 300 to 1800 rounds per minute. Fully automatic firearms are generally categorized as submachine guns, assault rifles, battle rifles, automatic shotguns, machine guns, or autocannons. Machine guns with multiple rotating barrels are referred to as \\"rotary machine guns\\".  - Sergey Ivanovich Koksharov (  ) is a Russian firearm designer working for the \\"Kovrov Mechanical Plant\\" (  ). He is most well known for his rifle design, the AEK-971, having variants for 5.45×39mm, 5.56×45mm and 7.62×39mm rounds.  - A battle rifle is a military service rifle that fires a full-power rifle cartridge, such as 7.62×51mm NATO, 7.62×54mmR, 7.92x57mm Mauser, .303 British, or .30-06 Springfield. Compared to assault rifles and their intermediate cartridges, the higher-caliber rounds provide greater power and range, though they have greater weight and produce stronger recoil, making them less than ideal for fully automatic fire.  - The AKM (\\"Avtomat Kalashnikova Modernizirovanniy\\" or \\"Kalashnikov modernized automatic rifle\\") is a 7.62mm assault rifle designed by Mikhail Kalashnikov. It is a common modernized variant of the AK-47 rifle developed in the 1940s.  - Kovrov is a city in Vladimir Oblast, Russia, located on the right bank of the Klyazma River (a tributary of the Oka). Kovrov's population as of the 2010 Census was 145,214; down from 155,499 recorded in the 2002 Census, and further down from 159,942 recorded in the 1989 Census). In terms of population, it is the second-largest city in Vladimir Oblast (after Vladimir). In 1977, Kovrov's population had been estimated at 140,000.  - Russia (from the  Rus'), also officially known as the Russian Federation, is a country in Eurasia. At , Russia is the largest country in the world by surface area, covering more than one-eighth of the Earth's inhabited land area, and the ninth most populous, with over 140 million people at the end of March 2016.

Question: \\"How did Galileo record Neptune's location?\\"  Context: \\"Some of the earliest recorded observations ever made through a telescope, Galileo's drawings on 28 December 1612 and 27 January 1613, contain plotted points that match up with what is now known to be the position of Neptune. On both occasions, Galileo seems to have mistaken Neptune for a fixed star when it appeared close—in conjunction—to Jupiter in the night sky; hence, he is not credited with Neptune's discovery. At his first observation in December 1612, Neptune was almost stationary in the sky because it had just turned retrograde that day. This apparent backward motion is created when Earth's orbit takes it past an outer planet. Because Neptune was only beginning its yearly retrograde cycle, the motion of the planet was far too slight to be detected with Galileo's small telescope. In July 2009, University of Melbourne physicist David Jamieson announced new evidence suggesting that Galileo was at least aware that the 'star' he had observed had moved relative to the fixed stars.\\"  Answer: The answer to this question is:","output":"Galileo recorded Neptune's location by observing the night sky through his telescope and creating drawings of the celestial objects he saw, specifically on 28 December 1612 and 27 January 1613.

Given the question: Answer the following question given this paragraph:   A change in an object’s motion—such as Xander speeding up on his scooter—is called acceleration . Acceleration occurs whenever an object is acted upon by an unbalanced force. The greater the net force acting on the object, the greater its acceleration will be, but the mass of the object also affects its acceleration. The smaller its mass is, the greater its acceleration for a given amount of force. Newton’s second law of motion summarizes these relationships. According to this law, the acceleration of an object equals the net force acting on it divided by its mass. This can be represented by the equation:.

To tie an overhand knot,","output":"Tying an overhand knot is a simple yet versatile knot that can be used in various applications, such as creating a stopper in a rope, attaching two cords together, or forming a loop. Here is a detailed, step-by-step guide to help someone accomplish the goal of tying an overhand knot: 1. Gather materials: First, the person will need a rope, cord, or string of a suitable length and thickness for their intended purpose. They should ensure that the material is in good condition, without any frays or damage that could compromise the knot's integrity. 2. Find the working end: The person will need to identify the \\"working end\\" of the rope. This is the end that will be used to create the knot, while the rest of the cord is referred to as the \\"standing part.\\" 3. Create a loop: To begin, the individual should hold the working end of the rope in their dominant hand (e.g., right hand for right-handed people). Next, they will need to make a loop by crossing the working end over the standing part of the rope. The working end should be on top of the standing part. 4. Pass the working end through the loop: The person will now have to carefully pass the working end of the rope through the loop they've just created. First, they should ensure that the loop is still open and not too tight. They can then use their non-dominant hand to hold the loop in place. Meanwhile, their dominant hand will push the working end of the rope through the loop from the side near the standing part, moving towards the open end of the loop. 5. Tighten the knot: At this point, the basic structure of the overhand knot has been created, but it needs to be tightened. The person should grasp the working end with one hand and the standing part with the other hand, then pull both ends away from each other. This will cause the knot to tighten and take its final shape. It's essential to tighten the knot evenly and check for any twists or kinks that might weaken it. 6. Inspect the knot: The person should carefully examine the finished overhand knot to ensure that it's correctly tied and secure. The knot should look like a simple loop with the working end and standing part running parallel to each other, and no twists or kinks. If the knot doesn't appear to be tied correctly, it’s advisable to undo it and repeat the process from the beginning. 7. Adjust the knot, if necessary: If the person needs to adjust the size, position, or tightness of their overhand knot, they should do so carefully. To enlarge or reduce the size of the loop, they can gently slide the knot along the standing part and re-tighten it. To loosen or tighten the knot itself, they will need to gradually adjust both the working end and the standing part simultaneously to ensure even tension. 8. Further applications: Now that the person has successfully tied an overhand knot, they can use this basic knot for various purposes or move onto more advanced knot-tying techniques. For example, they can tie an overhand knot near the end of a rope to create a stopper or tie two ropes together with a double overhand knot (also known as a high-strung knot). By following these detailed steps, someone can easily learn how to tie an overhand knot and gain a solid foundation in basic knot-tying skills."},{"instruction":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

While the other options A, C, and D might be immediate occurrences or effects on the car, they don't provide a comprehensive understanding of the longer-term impact on your vehicle. Option B – stress, appears to be related to the driver rather than the car. Now let's delve deeper into why depreciation is the best answer. Depreciation refers to the loss in value of an asset over time due to factors such as age, wear and tear, or mileage. In the case of a car, depreciation is the most significant cost factor over its lifetime and affects its resale value. When you drive to work, the additional mileage and wear on your car contribute to its depreciation. Mileage: The number of miles a car has been driven is an important factor in determining its value. It is often used to gauge the overall condition of the car, with lower mileage vehicles generally being considered more valuable as they are expected to have a longer remaining life. When you drive to work daily, your car accumulates miles, reducing its resale value over time.  Wear and tear: As you drive your car, it experiences wear and tear, which can manifest as mechanical problems, cosmetic damage, or significant functional issues. Regular work commutes expose your car to different road conditions and the elements, leading to paint damage, upholstery wear, dings, and dents. These all contribute to the decline in your car's resale value.  Maintenance: As your car accumulates miles and wear, it will require more frequent and sometimes costly maintenance or repairs. Driving to work daily increases this likelihood, as it exposes your car to potential hazards and issues. Regular maintenance and repair work are essential to keep your car running smoothly, but they also add to the long-term cost of car ownership. Other factors, such as the make and model of your car, its age, and the market demand for similar vehicles, also influence depreciation. However, the most direct result of driving to work is the accumulation of mileage and wear and tear on your car, leading to a decrease in its value.

Is the hypothesis entailed by the premise?","output":"To determine whether the hypothesis \\"someone cheated\\" is entailed by the premise \\"it would have been easy to cry foul\\", we need to examine the relationships between the meanings of the premise and the hypothesis in detail. Premise: \\"It would have been easy to cry foul\\" When we say it would have been easy to cry foul, we are suggesting that there is a situation where one could easily claim or argue that something was unjust, unfair, or not within the agreed-upon rules. This statement implies that there was a possibility of a violation or breach that led people to think about raising objections. However, this doesn't necessarily prove any wrongdoing. It just indicates the presence of suspicion or the potential to argue on that front. Hypothesis: \\"Someone cheated\\" The hypothesis states that someone actually cheated, meaning they intentionally committed an action that goes against the established rules or principles of fairness in the context of the situation. Unlike the premise, this statement aims to confirm that wrongdoing occurred, painting a more conclusive picture. Looking at the relationship between the two statements, it is evident that the premise does not necessarily entail the hypothesis. The premise suggests the existence of a situation wherein one could easily argue about an unfair or unjust act, but it does not provide any conclusive evidence or confirmation that someone cheated. The hypothesis, on the other hand, outright states that someone committed an act of cheating. In simpler terms, while the premise introduces the possibility of a foul play, the hypothesis asserts its occurrence. These statements are related but are not entailed by each other. There might be instances where it would be easy to cry foul without actual cheating happening and vice versa. Therefore, the hypothesis \\"someone cheated\\" is not entailed by the premise \\"it would have been easy to cry foul,\\" since the premise only establishes a situation where foul play could be suspected but does not necessarily confirm its occurrence."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Twista is probably the fastest rapper in the business and it is definately a breath of fresh air in comparison to the huge number of slow, raspy, mumbling rappers of late. No doubt, the best beats of the album are the two songs produced by Kayne West, \\"Slow Jams\\" and \\"Overnight Celebrity.\\" The problem with this album, however, is huge inconsistencies with quality beats and extremely cliched songs such as \\"Like a 24\\" and \\"Badonkadonk.\\" If I hear the line \\"I keep my mind on my money, money on my mind\\" one more time in a song, I will shoot myself.

However, there are certain subtleties in meaning that do not make them exactly same. Here are those subtleties: 1. The first sentence suggests that the family kept him away from the home. It doesn't provide specifics on how this was done or what this person's living situation was after leaving home. 2. The second sentence, in contrast, details that the family 'ran him out of the house', which suggests a more active, possibly forceful removal from the home. It also adds that he now lives 'on the street' as a direct result of being run out.  In other words, the first sentence is slightly vague about the extent of the family's actions and the person's subsequent circumstances, whereas the second sentence provides more explicit details about this.

Context: Relatives of a dying lady I was caring for kicking and screaming not to give their Mum pain relief because they were so terrified / knew it would probably be the thing to end her life. She had a horrible aggressive cancer that ravaged her whole body and needed very regular doses of strong pain relief which - as she had a terminal illness and was receiving end of life care - did not have an upper limit so to speak. She had pain relief as and when needed to make her comfortable and that often results in people ultimately overdosing. Mum had Alzheimer's and was howling and writhing in agony so we were giving her pain relief but daughters knew it would probably result in her death - which they were right about possibly happening and in their grief and panic, started trying to prevent us from doing anything. Didn’t want us getting near her at all and we had to go through an awful scenario of trying to explain what we had to do for Mum and why and when they still wouldn’t have it or allow us near, we had to do what nobody wants and go against their wishes by administering the pain relief anyway. One daughter screamed the place down, threatened to have me arrested and struck off / said she would go to the papers and tell them about how we killed her Mum and in the end she had to be removed from the bedroom. Her Mum was given the pain relief, immediately relaxed and fell asleep then died peacefully in her sleep about 15 mins later. The saddest thing is her daughter wasn’t able to be there and see her Mum dropping off so peacefully and her last memory will forever be of her screaming and thrashing about as she (daughter) was physically removed from the room. Tragic. Question: Why was Mum in agony Answer: Answer:","output":"Mum was in agony due to her advanced stage of a horrible aggressive cancer that had ravaged her whole body. This type of cancer can lead not only to the deterioration of one's physical health, but also cause severe pain as it affects various organs, tissues, and bones. In addition to the cancer, Mum also had Alzheimer's, which might have made it more difficult for her to communicate her pain or understand her own condition. To manage her unbearable pain, Mum was receiving end of life care that involved administering strong pain relief medications regularly. These medications are crucial for a patient's comfort and well-being during their final days, especially when they are experiencing severe pain from a terminal illness like aggressive cancer. It is important to note that when a patient is receiving end of life care, the main goal is to keep them as comfortable as possible, even if the pain relief administered may have potential risks. In this case, the healthcare professionals had to administer the necessary pain relief to help Mum feel more comfortable, despite the relatives' objection due to their understanding of possible consequences. It is important to remember that healthcare providers are trained to make difficult decisions in the best interest of their patients, even when faced with emotionally charged situations or resistance from family members. In the end, Mum was given the pain relief, which allowed her to relax and pass away peacefully in her sleep."},{"instruction":"User will you give you a task with some instruction.

Dissatisfied with police duty in Paris, he requests to be transferred and is assigned to the front in North Africa. He sees what the war has done to his captain (Maximilian Schell) and the captain's wife (May Britt), and he is sickened by their behavior. Michael Whiteacre (Dean Martin) and Noah Ackerman (Montgomery Clift) befriend each other during their U.S. Army draft physical examination and attend basic training together.They are then stationed in London. Michael is in show business and romantically involved with socialite Margaret Freemantle (Barbara Rush) who, coincidentally, in 1938 dated Christian in the Bavarian Alps where she spent her skiing vacation. She was upset by his Nazi beliefs and deserted him on New Year's Eve to return to Michael. Noah, who is Jewish and employed as a junior department store clerk, attends a party Michael throws, where he meets Hope Plowman (Hope Lange). She falls in love with him and introduces her fiancÃ© to her provincial father, who doesn't like Jews but has never met one. After a chat with Noah, the father approves of the marriage. In the service, a commanding officer and some of the tough guys in his company try to bully Noah and demonstrate their bigotry.

Plausibility: While a dental office could be in a town or a medical center, the question presents that the office is in a \\"strange place.\\" Therefore, these two more common options may not be the best choice for this question.  3. Improbability of other options: The options \\"patient\\" and \\"candy shop\\" are highly unlikely places for a dentist office to operate. A dental office situated within a patient does not make sense, as it would not be physically possible. A candy shop, on the other hand, would be an ironic and strange place for a dentist office, but it is not as practical or believable as an office building. Considering these points, a human would choose \\"office building\\" as the most reasonable answer in the context of the question, while acknowledging that it is still a somewhat strange location for a dentist office."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

New Legitimacy: Organized crime was soon to have a formidable adversary in its bid to control Las Vegas — corporate cash. Though Las Vegas had developed a powerful local economy, few major outside investments were made in the city, due primarily to mob infiltration and its inherent ties to illegal activities. That would change dramatically with the 1966 arrival of billionaire Howard Hughes. A legitimate businessman, Hughes was nonetheless eccentric and dramatic, a style suited to the Las Vegas ethos. True to the myth, the reclusive Hughes immediately cloistered himself in the Desert Inn's penthouse. Several weeks later he was asked — then ordered — to vacate the room to make room for high rollers, whereupon he promptly bought the property and fired the management. Thus began Hughes' legendary three-year, 300-million Las Vegas buying spree. When it was over, Hughes owned six casinos, an airport, and an airline, along with numerous plots of land stretching from the Strip to the mountains. Hughes' actions would have beneficial repercussions, both immediate and lasting. Because of the new legitimacy Las Vegas acquired from Hughes' investments, established companies such as Hilton Hotels bought into the gaming business, and their influence helped draw a line in the desert sand between legitimate operations and mob casinos, where illegal skimming of profits was rampant. That, combined with the formation of the Nevada Gaming Control Board, would signal the beginning of the end for heavy mob influence in the city. Las Vegas with a Vision As corporations moved in and the mob was slowly pushed out, a new Las Vegas emerged. The legitimization of gambling led to its increased legalization across the US. What was once a sure thing became much more competitive. Casino operators had to reassess the nature of their business. The first to really do so was Steve Wynn, a Las Vegas resident and owner of the Golden Nugget. In the mid-1980s, Wynn began plans to reinvigorate Las Vegas with a new resort. He bought several Strip properties — the Silver Slipper and Castaways among them — and demolished them to make way for a new kind of resort — Mirage —  which became an instant success.  Question: \\"Due to the legitimization, competitiveness, and new Las Vegas what were casinos force to do?\\" Response: \\"Casinos needed to assess their business model and become more competitive to survive\\" Based on the paragraph, is the response to the question is factually correct? Available choices: I. no; II. yes;","output":"II. yes; The response to the question is factually correct because the passage states that with the legitimization of gambling and increased competition, casino operators had to reassess the nature of their business. This means they needed to evaluate their business model and become more competitive to survive in the new environment. The other choice, \\"no,\\" is wrong because it contradicts the information given in the passage."},{"instruction":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

By the end of the evening, all that is left is a small pile of ashes. What happened to the matter that you started with? Was it destroyed by the flames? It may seem that way. What do you think happened? The truth is that the same amount of matter still exists. The wood changed not only to ashes, but also to carbon dioxide, water vapor, and other gases. The gases floated off into the air, leaving behind just the ashes. Although matter was changed, it was not created or destroyed. Because the same amount of matter still exists, we can say that matter is conserved. You may wonder how it can be conserved if something is now missing? Assume you had measured the mass of the wood before you burned it. Assume you had also trapped the gases released by the burning wood and measured their mass and the mass of the ashes. What would you find? The ashes and gases combined have the same mass as the wood you started with. This example illustrates the law of conservation of mass.  Based on the paragraph, does the response \\"Nothing\\" correctly answer the question \\"What is left when the stack shrinks?\\"?","output":"No, the response \\"Nothing\\" doesn't correctly answer the question.

Given the question: Read the following article and select the best answer. Article: E-waste is fast becoming a serious problem around the world. This report will examine this problem and provide some possible ways to solve it. We live in a society that is producing and using electronics  all the time. It is often cheaper to buy new products than to repair old ones. Also, through clever advertising, companies always encourage people to change their old TVs, mobile phones and computers for the latest models. E-waste is created when we throw away old ones. In the EU alone, about 8,700,000 tons of e-waste is produced each year. Sadly, just over 1,000,000 tons is recycled. Burying  e-waste or burning it cause serious problems for the environment. Electronics have dangerous things in them. These things can then get into the ground or pollute the air when they are burnt. In recent years,  _ . However, their plans are not always managed properly. Sometimes electronics are just sent to poor countries such as Ghana.

I have to give this place 5 stars because no one in our party of 5 could find fault with anything .   I was a little apprehensive about coming here with my dinner group since I had never been here before and the menu prices were somewhat cheap but it was recommended so I took a chance and made reservations.    Not being a lover of prime rib I ordered the NY strip steak, medium on the inside, charred on the outside and that's exactly how it was served to me.  The steak was intensly flavored, juicy and very  tender.  I was impressed.     Bertha ordered liver and onions and said it was one of the best she'd ever had, tons of onions and bacon.   Sandy had the beef medalions with a sauce to die for and she too liked it very much. Maureen loved her strip steak and remarked at how perfectly is was done, (medium rare). Jeannette was the only one who ordered the prime rib although she was afraid there would be a lot of fat as most prime rib cuts can be.  Not so with this one.  We were surprised at how well it was trimmed and she commented on on well it was prepared.    Baked potatoes all around, separate dish, loads of butter and sour cream on the side.    The salads were fresh, crisp and ample.   My Caesar had a tad too much dressing but didn't stop me from finishing it.   Maureen raved about her blue cheese dressing so naturally we all had to dip our forks into the pitcher and give it a taste.  She was right, it was some of the best blue cheese ever with chunks of cheese.  The price for my steak was  21.95 with soup, or salad, and potato.   A bargain I thought.    Take a look at the menu online and see for yourself how the prices range.  Service was wonderful, we never had to ask for anything; one of the two servers we had was always aware that water needed filling, wine glasses needed re-filling, plates needed to be taken away, etc.     Ambience was very nice, somewhat quiet,  cozy and very comfortable chairs.  We lingered for over an hour after finishing dinner.   We all decided we would definitely return later this summer.   Hope you give this place a try.

Think like you are answering to a five year old. I was given the opportunity to see this 1926 film in a magnificently restored theater that was once part of the extensive Paramount chain of vaudeville houses. This Paramount has a Mighty Wurlitzer' organ  also magnificently restored -- that was used to accompany the silent films of the day. We were fortunate enough to have Dennis James, a key figure in the international revival of silent films at the Mighty Wurlitzer playing appropriate music and thematic compositions fitting to the action on the film. The print was a nearly perfect digital copy of the rapidly decaying nitrate negative and the entire experience was a once-in-a-lifetime chance to see a silent film as it was meant to be seen. This was Greta Garbo's first American film. She was only 20 years old but already had 6 Swedish films in her repertoire. It is somewhat ironic that this is a silent film about an opera star; even though the Mighty Wurlitzer added immensely to the mise-en-scene, it was necessary to leave much to the imagination. Modern audiences, for the most part, do not understand silent films Acting was different then, with expansive gestures and broad facial expressions. Therefore audiences laugh at inappropriate times  the acting is seen as hammy' and over-done  but it was simply the style of the period. Garbo, with all her subtlety, did much to usher in the new age of acting: she could say more with a half-closed eye and volumes could be read into a downward glance or a simple shrug. She exemplifies the truism that \`a picture is worth a thousand words.' Even though this is Garbo's first American film it is pretty obvious the studio knew what they had on their hands: This was MGM filmmaking at its best. The sets and costumes were magnificent. The special effects  which by today's standards are pretty feeble  were still electrifying and amazing. The script by Vicente Blasco Ibanez (from the novel by Entre Naranjos) would seem to be tailor made for Garbo; it showcases her strengths, magnifies her assets and there is no pesky language problem to deal with: a Swedish actress can play a Spanish temptress with no suspension of disbelief on our part. Her co-star was MGM's answer to Rudolph Valentino: Ricardo Cortez. He does an admirable job and did something that few romantic stars of the day ever would have done in a film: allow himself to look unnactractive, appear foolish and to grow old ungracefully. There are some fairly good character parts that are more than adequately acted  especially when you consider the powerhouse that was Garbo. Notable among them are Lucien Littlefield as Cupido' and Martha Mattox as Doña Bernarda Brull.' This is when the extraordinary cinematographer, William H. Daniels, met Garbo  they went on to make 20 films together. (He was the cinematographer on 157 films and his career spanned five decades!) He was able to capture her ethereal beauty and it was his photography that was primarily responsible for the moniker by which she became known: The Divine Garbo. Without his magnificent abilities she would not have been the success that she was. Seeing this film is an all-too-rare opportunity: if you ever have the chance, do not miss it.

One such project is the balloon drum. Essentially, a balloon drum is an ingenious, cost-effective, and enjoyable alternative to traditional drums, crafted from easily available materials. This simple yet versatile percussion instrument is an excellent option for both amateurs and experienced musicians, as well as for educational purposes. In this article, we will guide you through the step-by-step process of creating your very own balloon drum. Materials Needed 1. A soup pot or other drum body (preferably one with a wide and flat opening) 2. Balloons (preferably of various sizes and colors for different sound effects) 3. A pair of scissors 4. Clear packing tape or duct tape 5. Optional: A drumstick or any stick-like object to be used as a beater Procedure Step 1: Select a Suitable Drum Body Finding the right drum body is the first and most critical step in constructing your balloon drum. A soup pot or any other metal or plastic container with a wide, flat opening will work best for this purpose. Make sure the chosen drum body is stable and does not have any sharp edges or rough surfaces that could puncture the balloon. Large coffee cans, popcorn tins, and even plastic buckets can also be used as alternative drum bodies. Step 2: Acquire and Prepare Your Balloons After identifying a suitable drum body, the next step is to prepare the balloons, which will act as the drumhead. Select balloons of various sizes and thicknesses. Thicker balloons will produce deeper and more resonant sounds, while thinner ones will generate higher frequencies and pitch. You can also choose between latex and non-latex balloons based on personal preference and desired sound. Once you've chosen your balloons, carefully inflate them to ensure there are no holes or defects. Experiment with various levels of inflation to alter the sound outcome. Do not overinflate the balloons; a moderate amount of air should suffice. Step 3: Cover the Opening Once you've inflated your balloons, take your chosen balloon and stretch it evenly over the opening of the drum body. Make sure the balloon covers the entire surface without any creases or wrinkles. It is crucial to maintain an even tension across the entire drumhead to achieve a balanced and pleasing tone. The balloon should be pulled taut, but not excessively tight. Remember that the tension and thickness of the balloon will have a direct impact on the sound produced by your DIY drum. Step 4: Secure the Drum Surface with Tape After the balloon has been correctly positioned over the drum body, use clear packing tape or duct tape to secure the balloon in place. Apply tape around the rim of the drum, ensuring it adheres firmly to the balloon drumhead and the edge of the drum body. Double-check that the tape is evenly wrapped around the entire circumference of the drum and hold the balloon securely. The goal is to create a stable playing surface that will not shift or deform during use. Step 5: Start Drumming! With the drum fully assembled, you're ready to start playing! You can use your hands, a pair of drumsticks, or any other stick-like object to strike the balloon drumhead. Be imaginative and explore the different sounds produced by varying the thickness and tension of the balloon drumhead, as well as the location of your strikes. Your DIY balloon drum is perfect for experimenting with rhythms, timbres, and dynamics. Unleash your creativity and enjoy the satisfaction of having crafted a DIY musical instrument. Conclusion Creating a balloon drum is an easy, fun, and affordable way to explore the world of percussion instruments. With countless potential variations in size, color, and sound, this versatile and portable drum is an engaging learning tool, an inventive musical expression, and a fascinating conversation piece. Enjoy the process of building your own unique balloon drum, and let it spark a lifetime of creative exploration in the captivating realm of music."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

SEOUL — The head of the United Nations World Food Program (WFP) on Tuesday said the North Korean leadership is hopeful that following a possible denuclearization deal, the international community will increase humanitarian aid for millions of people in the country who are living in poverty and suffering from malnutrition. “There is a tremendous sense of optimism by the leadership, by the people I met with, in the hopes that they will be turning a new chapter in their history, a new page,” said David Beasley, the Executive Director of the WFP during a briefing in Seoul. The WFP director visited North Korea for four days last week, spending two days in Pyongyang and two visiting rural areas outside the capital. Beasley said he was given “remarkable” access during his visit to the restrictive state where contact with foreigners is tightly controlled. Government minders also accompanied him during his visit. Beasley, a former governor of the U.S. state of South Carolina, was nominated to head the WFP last year by U.S. Ambassador to the U.N. Nikki Haley, who is also a former South Carolina governor. With the upcoming summit between U.S. President Donald Trump and North Korean leader Kim Jong Un now scheduled to be held in Singapore on June 12, there are increased expectations that an agreement will be reached to dismantle the North’s nuclear, missile and chemical weapons programs that threaten the U.S. and its allies. Details over the scope and timing of the denuclearization process must still be worked out, but the North Korean leader has indicated he wants to resolve the dispute to focus on improving the economic conditions of the country. Ending the severe U.S. led sanctions banning 90% of North Korean trade that were imposed for the North’s repeated nuclear and missile tests, would open the door to increased economic investment and cooperation.

When I last visited them at hospital they prayed for the nation. My condolences to their family... Rest in peace my children,\\" President John Magufuli tweeted.      After an apparent improvement in their health, the sisters continued their treatment at a hospital near their university, where they died on Saturday.      The twins were abandoned by their mother after the death of their father, and later taken in by a Catholic mission.      In an emotional statement on state television last July, Maria urged parents not to \\"hide or lock up their handicapped children\\".      \\"They must know they as human beings, handicapped or not, are equal and have the same rights,\\" she said.      At the time, the sisters, who enjoyed knitting and cooking together, thanked the teachers who helped them through high school, as well as the government who provided a vehicle to take them from their home to school each day.      \\"We didn't expect this day to come, it is by the grace of God that we are here today,\\" said Consolata, the chattier of the two, on their admission to university.      Conjoined twins Maria and Consolata Mwakikuti, who became famous when they were admitted to university in September 2017, have died after a long illness ||||| Media playback is unsupported on your device Media caption Maria and Consolata speak of their dreams in a 2017 BBC interview      Tanzanian conjoined twins Maria and Consolata Mwakikuti have died at the age 21 after suffering respiratory complications at a local hospital.      The women, who were joined from the navel downwards and shared organs like the liver and lungs, had two hearts and separate heads and arms.      They were admitted to hospital in December due to issues relating to heart disease but died on Saturday.      The twins were popular in Tanzania and the news has caused sadness nationwide.      Many people took to social media on Sunday to send messages of condolence to the family and friends.      Tanzanian President John Magufuli tweeted that he was \\"saddened\\" by their deaths, adding that Consolata and Maria had \\"dreamed of serving the nation\\".      In an interview with the BBC last year, the twins said that after they had completed their university education, they wanted to become teachers.      \\"We will teach using a projector and computers,\\" they said.      Image caption The twins had said they hoped to marry one day      People later remarked on their determination to acquire higher education qualifications regardless of a challenging system, which often found their condition hard to accommodate.      They were able to continue their studies as they grew older thanks in part to funding from local government and private donations.      Maria and Consolata, who were against the idea of being surgically separated, also told the BBC that they hoped to get married to one husband someday.      The two, whose parents died while they were still infants, were raised by the Catholic charity Maria Consolata, which had adopted and named them.      Last year, their high school graduation triggered a wave of congratulatory messages nationwide. |||||Summary:","output":"Conjoined twins Maria and Consolata Mwakikuti, who gained popularity in Tanzania when they were admitted to university in September 2017, have died at the age of 21 after suffering from a long illness.

User will you give you a task. Your goal is to complete the task as faithfully as you can. While performing the task think step-by-step and justify your steps. Given the question: I read this background article the other day: Soil piping is a particular form of soil erosion that occurs below the soil surface. It causes levee and dam failure, as well as sink hole formation. Turbulent flow removes soil starting at the mouth of the seep flow and the subsoil erosion advances up-gradient. The term sand boil is used to describe the appearance of the discharging end of an active soil pipe.Soil salination is the accumulation of free salts to such an extent that it leads to degradation of the agricultural value of soils and vegetation. Consequences include corrosion damage, reduced plant growth, erosion due to loss of plant cover and soil structure, and water quality problems due to sedimentation. Salination occurs due to a combination of natural and human-caused processes. Arid conditions favour salt accumulation. This is especially apparent when soil parent material is saline. Irrigation of arid lands is especially problematic. All irrigation water has some level of salinity. Irrigation, especially when it involves leakage from canals and overirrigation in the field, often raises the underlying water table. Rapid salination occurs when the land surface is within the capillary fringe of saline groundwater. Soil salinity control involves watertable control and flushing with higher levels of applied water in combination with tile drainage or another form of subsurface drainage.  I am facing a new situation today: The city of Lampo is currently experiencing some soil piping in the ground. The government officials of Lampo are currently looking to start a casino to bring in extra revenue to the town. They are currently consulting with a company that is located in Himpton, a city that is not experiencing soil piping. The company is a well respected leader in the casino industry and is eager to work with Lampo.  Using the knowledge I acquired from the background article, how should I answer correctly the following question regarding my new situation: Are sink holes more or less likely to form in Lampo? The answer is:","output":"Sink holes are more likely to form in Lampo. Step 1: Identifying the cause of the issue Based on the background information, soil piping is mentioned as the cause of sinkhole formation. In the given situation, Lampo is experiencing soil piping. Step 2: Understanding the effects of soil piping As per the background article, soil piping causes levee and dam failure, as well as sinkhole formation. This is due to the turbulent flow removing soil starting at the mouth of the seep flow and the subsoil erosion advancing up-gradient. Step 3: Comparing the situations in Lampo and Himpton Lampo is experiencing soil piping, while Himpton is not mentioned to have any soil piping issues. This implies that the probability of sinkhole formation is different between the two cities. Step 4: Drawing conclusions based on the given information Since Lampo is experiencing soil piping and the background article states that soil piping causes sinkhole formation, it can be concluded that sinkholes are more likely to form in Lampo as compared to Himpton, which is not experiencing soil piping."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Read this article and answer this question Still looking for their first win of the season, the Browns went home for a Week 4 AFC North duel with the Cincinnati Bengals in Round 1 of 2009's Battle of Ohio. Due to quarterback Brady Quinn's poor performance in the season thus far, head coach Eric Mangini named quarterback Derek Anderson the starter. Cleveland would trail early in the first quarter as Bengals quarterback Carson Palmer completed a 5-yard touchdown pass to wide receiver Chad Ochocinco. The Browns would continue to struggle in the second quarter as defensive end Robert Geathers returned a fumble 75 yards for a touchdown. Cleveland would respond with Anderson completing a 1-yard touchdown pass to tight end Steve Heiden. The Browns would tie the game in the third quarter with Anderson's 1-yard touchdown run. Afterwards, Cleveland would take the lead in the fourth quarter with a 26-yard and a 31-yard field goal from kicker Billy Cundiff. However, Cincinnati answered with Palmer hooking up with Ochocinco again on a 2-yard touchdown run (with a blocked PAT). In overtime, both teams went back and forth with their possessions. In the end, the Bengals emerged victorious with kicker Shayne Graham kicking the game-winning 31-yard field goal.

Read the following paragraph and extract the answer for the question: What is the last name of the person who retreated to his parents' home in rural Warwickshire?  Nicholas Rodney Drake (19 June 1948 – 25 November 1974) was an English singer-songwriter and musician known for his acoustic guitar-based songs. He failed to find a wide audience during his lifetime, but his work has since achieved wider recognition.Drake signed to Island Records when he was 20, while a student at the University of Cambridge, and released his debut album, Five Leaves Left, in 1969. By 1972, he had recorded two more albums, Bryter Layter and Pink Moon. Neither sold more than 5,000 copies on initial release. His reluctance to perform live or give interviews contributed to his lack of commercial success. No footage of the adult Drake has been released, only still photographs.Drake is believed to have suffered from depression, reflected in his lyrics. After making Pink Moon, he withdrew from performance and recording, retreating to his parents' home in rural Warwickshire. At the age of 26, Drake died from an overdose of approximately 30 amitriptyline pills, a prescribed antidepressant. His cause of death was determined as suicide.The 1979 release of the retrospective album Fruit Tree triggered a reassessment of Drake's music. By the mid-1980s, he was credited as an influence by such artists as Robert Smith, David Sylvian, and Peter Buck. In 1985, the Dream Academy reached the UK and US charts with \\"Life in a Northern Town\\", a song written for and dedicated to Drake. By the early 1990s, he had come to represent a \\"doomed romantic\\" musician in the UK music press. The first Drake biography was published in 1997, followed in 1998 by the documentary film A Stranger Among Us. In 1999, his song \\"Pink Moon\\" was used in a Volkswagen commercial, resulting in an increase in his U.S. album sales. By 2014, more than 2.4 million Nick Drake albums had been sold in the UK and the US.
