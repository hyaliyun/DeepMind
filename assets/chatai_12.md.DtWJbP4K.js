Rosa, a spirited and adventurous woman in her early thirties, works as a tour guide for a local travel company. She finds herself in various unexpected scenarios while juggling her career, relationships, and personal growth. Meanwhile, her aunt Carmen, a warm-hearted and mischievous woman in her fifties, recently moved in with Rosa after a series of coincidences. Despite their age difference, they navigate life together, embracing the ups and downs with laughter and occasional teasing. Scene: Rosa's Desperate Return INT. APARTMENT BUILDING - HALLWAY - DAY The scene opens with Rosa briskly walking through the hallway, her face flushed with desperation. She is a stylish Mexican-American woman in her thirties, wearing a fashionable blouse and skirt. Her dark hair is pulled back into a messy bun, and she clutches her stomach with one hand. Rosa fumbles through her purse, frustration evident in her eyes, as she searches for her keys. Her urgency grows, but relief seems far from her grasp. ROSA (calling) Marta! Please pick up, I need you! She anxiously dials her flatmate, MIRIAM \\"MARTA\\" VELASQUEZ, but receives no answer. Rosa's eyes widen as she realizes her predicament and begins knocking frantically on the door. ROSA (slightly panicked) Marta! Marta! Are you in there? For the love of tacos, please answer! Her desperation intensifies, and in a comedic twist of fate, she suddenly hears her aunt Carmen's voice on the other side of the door. CARMEN (O.S) What's all the commotion about out there, mija? Rosa's dismay is palpable as she realizes she must face her aunt in her current predicament. Carmen, a laid-back woman in her fifties, wearing comfortable lounge attire, opens the door slowly. Her disheveled appearance reflects the recently awakened state from her afternoon nap. CARMEN (sleepily) Rosa? What's going on? Rosa's eyes meet Carmen's, and her facial expression transitions from desperation to pure relief mingled with embarrassment. Rosa freezes mid-movement, assuming an awkward posture, and her face contorts with an untimely expression of relief. She is in the midst of relieving herself in her pants. Carmen stands there, befuddled, her eyes darting between Rosa's face and her peculiar posture. CARMEN (confused) Rosa, what on earth are you doing? And why are you standing there? Come on in! Rosa raises a hand, gesturing for silence. Soft grunts escape her as she continues to relieve herself, a mix of pleasure and sheer relief in her voice. Carmen attempts to inquire further, but Rosa's hand and dismissive reply halt her attempts. ROSA (whispering) Shh, Aunt Carmen. Just give me a sec. It's... uh, complicated. Carmen's bewilderment grows, her eyes widening as she catches a whiff of an unusual odor. CARMEN (disgusted) What's that smell? Suddenly, realization dawns on Carmen as she takes in the sight before her. CARMEN (bemused) Did you...? No way! As Rosa concludes her relief, a sigh of utter relief escapes her lips. Carmen, unable to contain her laughter any longer, breaks into hysterical chuckles as she points at Rosa's pants. ROSA (embarrassed) Okay, okay! I get it! It's not my finest moment! Rosa gingerly waddles past her aunt and into the apartment, her face flushing deeper with each step. Aunt Carmen teasingly taunts Rosa playfully, moving slightly to mimic her waddling motion. CARMEN (teasingly) Oh, Rosa, my dear, you really outdid yourself this time! The things you do for comedic relief, huh? Rosa, initially indignant, gradually lets go of her initial mortification and embraces the lightheartedness. ROSA (playfully sulking) Well, if you weren't taking forever to open the door, I wouldn't have had to resort to such drastic measures! Their banter continues as Rosa makes her way toward the bathroom to clean up. CARMEN (mockingly) You better go wash up, Rosa. I don't think the smell will let us forget who's to blame! Rosa, a mix of coy playfulness and sheepishness, acknowledges her aunt's teasing, commenting on her own soiled pants and the resulting odor. ROSA (coyly) Believe me, I'm well aware. I'll be right back. Wish me luck! Carmen playfully reacts, squeezing her nose shut in exaggerated disgust as she agrees with Rosa, emphasizing the smell. CARMEN (mockingly) Oh, you definitely need to go clean yourself up, stinker! Go on now! As the laughter continues, Rosa finally heads to the bathroom while Carmen stands at the doorway, chuckling to herself. FADE OUT."},{"instruction":"Hi. I want to create an AI that can apply style of a logo to another logo. Can you help me","output":"Of course! I can definitely help you. Creating an AI that can apply the style of one logo to another can be approached as a style transfer problem. Here's a high-level overview of the steps you can follow to achieve this: 1. Dataset collection: Gather a dataset of logos with a wide variety of styles that you want to learn from. This dataset will serve as the style reference for the AI model. Ensure that the dataset is diverse and representative of different logo styles. 2. Preprocessing: Clean and preprocess the logo images in your dataset. This may involve resizing, normalizing, and regularizing the images to ensure consistency and optimal model performance. 3. Train an AI model: You can use a pre-trained convolutional neural network (CNN), such as VGG, as a feature extractor. Extract features from the content image (the logo you want to apply style to) and style image (target logo whose style you want to apply). Compute the gram matrices of both feature representations, and optimize a target image to minimize the difference between the content and style gram matrices using gradient descent. 4. Fine-tuning: To improve results, you may also train your own style transfer model using techniques such as cycle consistency loss or perceptual loss to make the output look more realistic and maintain the content of the content image. 5. Evaluation: Evaluate your model by applying the learned style to test logos and visually inspect the results. You may need to fine-tune and iterate on your model parameters to achieve better outcomes. 6. Deployment and refinement: Once you are satisfied with the output of your AI model, you can deploy it for practical use. However, keep in mind that there might be instances where the applied style may not be completely accurate or may not suit every logo. Continuous refinement and iterating on the model will help improve the results over time. Note that this is just a general approach, and developing an AI for logo style transfer can be complex. You may need to explore various techniques, such as neural style transfer, GANs, or other architectural variations to achieve the desired results. It will also require a strong knowledge of deep learning, image processing, and potentially computer vision."},{"instruction":"neural style transfer did not work properly is there any other method and can you provide me with some code as well ?","output":"If neural style transfer did not work as expected, you can consider exploring alternative approaches such as perceptual loss or using generative adversarial networks (GANs).

Vivian's relief is tangible, and Aunt Marianne's puzzled stare turns into sudden shock as the odor from Vivian's accident hits her. AUNT MARIANNE (waving her hand) Whoa! What's that smell? Realization dawns on Aunt Marianne, and the absurdity of the situation hits her. AUNT MARIANNE (surprised) Did you just...? Vivian tries to avoid admitting explicitly what happened, hoping to escape the humiliating situation. She gestures for Aunt Marianne to let her inside. VIVIAN (whispering) Aunt Marianne, just let me in, please. Aunt Marianne, teasingly insistent, raises an eyebrow and smiles mischievously. AUNT MARIANNE (gently teasing) Oh no, you don't get off that easily, Vivian. Say it! What did you just do? Vivian equivocates, attempting to avoid answering directly, but eventually she sheepishly admits to the accident. VIVIAN (with a sigh) Okay, fine! I... I relieved myself in my pants, alright? Aunt Marianne bursts into laughter, unable to keep her amusement in check. Once the admission is made, Vivian gingerly waddles past the laughing Aunt Marianne, who is still standing at the doorway. AUNT MARIANNE (between fits of laughter) Oh, Vivian! You've really outdone yourself! Look at you waddling along like a little child! Vivian, initially indignant and sheepish, gradually starts growing out of her initial mortification and responds to Aunt Marianne's teasing. VIVIAN (playfully sulking) Well, it's your fault! You took forever to open the door! As Vivian shuffles past Aunt Marianne, the teasing continues. AUNT MARIANNE (mockingly incredulous) Oh, so now it's my fault? Naughty girl, pooping your pants like a little baby. Shame on you! Vivian, embarrassed yet finding humor in the situation, responds coyly. VIVIAN (coyly) Ugh, you don't understand, Aunt Marianne! It was so nasty! I need to go clean up. Aunt Marianne, playfully reacting to the odor emanating from Vivian, agrees teasingly. AUNT MARIANNE (teasingly) Indeed, dear. You better go clean up that stinky mess. I won't call you anything other than \\"Dirty Diaper\\" from now on, though! Vivian accepts Aunt Marianne's teasing in a coy and sheepish manner, commenting on her own accident and the odor, but playfully insists on blaming the delayed door opening. VIVIAN (laughing) I get it, \\"Dirty Diaper.\\" But remember, it's all your fault! You opened the door too slowly! After a final burst of laughter, Aunt Marianne relents and allows Vivian to head to the bathroom for cleanup. AUNT MARIANNE (giggling) Alright, \\"Dirty Diaper,\\" off you go. Clean up that smell before it follows you everywhere! Vivian gives Aunt Marianne a playful glare, indicating that their lighthearted banter is all in good humor, before finally making her way to the bathroom.

According to this belief, Heaven is understood as a realm or state of eternal communion with God, where those who have lived a righteous and faithful life will experience everlasting happiness and peace in the presence of God. This belief is particularly emphasized in mainstream Christian denominations such as Catholicism, Protestantism, and Eastern Orthodoxy. However, it is important to note that there can be some variations in beliefs and interpretations among different Christian denominations regarding the afterlife and the concept of Heaven."},{"instruction":"What is the difference between Heaven and New Jerusalem?","output":"In Christian doctrine, Heaven and the New Jerusalem are often used interchangeably, but they can also be understood as distinct concepts. Heaven generally refers to the eternal dwelling place of God, where believers who have been made righteous through their faith in Jesus Christ will enter into a state of everlasting communion with God. It is often described as a place of endless joy, peace, and worship. In this understanding, Heaven is primarily seen as a spiritual realm. On the other hand, the New Jerusalem is a specific term mentioned in the Bible, particularly in the Book of Revelation. It is described as a holy city coming down from Heaven, where God will dwell with His people in the future. The depiction of the New Jerusalem in the Bible includes detailed descriptions of its size, beauty, and the absence of sorrow or death. It is described as a place of perfect harmony and unity where believers will have direct communion with God. While the New Jerusalem can be seen as a physical representation or manifestation of Heaven, some Christians interpret it to be a metaphorical depiction of the future redeemed and renewed Earth, where God's presence pervades every aspect of creation. In summary, Heaven is the eternal dwelling place of God, while the New Jerusalem is a specific depiction or representation of that eternal dwelling place."},{"instruction":"What precious stones make up the foundation of New Jerusalem as described in Revelation?","output":"According to the Book of Revelation (Revelation 21:19-20), the foundations of the New Jerusalem are adorned with various precious stones. The listed stones are: 1. Jasper: It is often associated with clear or colorless quartz, symbolizing purity and clarity. 2. Sapphire: This stone is typically blue and represents divine favor, truth, and loyalty. 3. Chalcedony: The appearance of this stone can vary, but it is generally white or blue-grey. It symbolizes peace, harmony, and calmness. 4. Emerald: Emerald is green and represents rebirth, fertility, and hope. 5. Sardonyx: This stone is characterized by bands of different colors, usually red and white. It symbolizes courage and strength. 6. Carnelian: Carnelian is typically an orange or reddish-brown stone associated with passion, energy, and protection. 7. Chrysolite: Also known as peridot, this stone is often yellowish-green and represents growth, abundance, and renewal. 8. Beryl: Beryl comes in various colors, but in this context, it is described as a clear, greenish-yellow stone symbolizing spiritual awareness and understanding. 9. Topaz: Topaz is usually yellow, symbolizing wisdom, courage, and protection. 10. Chrysoprase: Chrysoprase is a translucent green gemstone associated with divine truth, grace, and compassion. 11. Jacinth: Jacinth is an orange-red stone symbolizing fervent love and divine energy. 12. Amethyst: Amethyst is a purple stone representing spiritual insight, tranquility, and protection against negativity. It's important to note that interpretations of these descriptions can vary, and the symbolism attached to each stone may differ among different scholars and Christian traditions. Additionally, these descriptions may have symbolic and metaphorical meanings rather than being literal representations of stones."},{"instruction":"Do most Christian denominations hold that the righteous will dwell in New Jerusalem after death or is it seen as just one depiction of Heaven and interpret it as an allegory for communion of God?","output":"The interpretation of the New Jerusalem can vary among Christian denominations. While some Christian denominations may interpret it as a literal physical city where the righteous will dwell in the future, others may see it as a symbolic or metaphorical depiction of the ultimate communion with God in Heaven. In some denominations, the New Jerusalem is understood as a concrete and real place where believers will reside after death or after the final judgment. This view is particularly prominent in certain forms of millennialism or dispensationalist interpretations of Bible prophecy. However, other Christian denominations interpret the descriptions of the New Jerusalem in a more symbolic or allegorical manner. They may understand it as a metaphor for the redeemed and renewed Earth, where God's presence fills every aspect of creation, or as a representation of the perfected and harmonious spiritual state in Heaven. This viewpoint emphasizes the ultimate communion with God rather than focusing on specific physical structures or geographical locations. It is important to note that views regarding the New Jerusalem can vary within denominations as well, as interpretations of biblical prophecies can differ. Consequently, the interpretation of the New Jerusalem and the concept of Heaven can differ across Christian traditions and even among individual believers."},{"instruction":"评价一下冷战时期苏联应对美国贸易管的效果，500字左右","output":"冷战时期，苏联面临着与美国的经济斗争和贸易争端。苏联实行了一系列的贸易管制措施，以应对美国的贸易限制。这些措施对苏联经济产生了一定的影响，但总体效果并不明显，甚至可能起到了相反的效果。 首先，苏联的贸易管制措施导致了物资短缺和供应紧张。苏联通过限制进口美国商品和技术，加强了本国工业生产，试图实现自给自足。然而，苏联的经济体系并没有足够的实力来满足国内市场的需求，导致了许多商品的短缺和高昂的价格。这给苏联人民带来了生活的不便和经济的负担，对苏联的经济发展也造成了一定的阻碍。 其次，贸易管制措施可能导致国际经济孤立。苏联对美国的贸易限制引发了其他西方国家的不满，这些国家也开始限制对苏联的贸易。这进一步削弱了苏联在国际贸易中的地位，限制了苏联与其他国家的经济合作与交流。孤立的效果可能导致经济更加困难和脆弱。 然而，在另一方面，苏联的贸易管制措施也促使了经济结构的调整和技术创新。由于受到贸易限制，苏联国内产业开始加强自主创新和研发能力。尽管创新水平有限，但贸易管制无疑激发了苏联工业部门的技术改进和自主发展的动力。这在一定程度上促进了苏联经济的现代化。 最后，贸易管制措施反而加强了苏联与其他社会主义国家的贸易合作。苏联在冷战时期通过与其他社会主义国家建立贸易关系，尤其是东欧国家，加强了相互之间的经济合作。这种合作帮助苏联解决了一部分贸易管制措施所带来的物资短缺问题，并提供了苏联市场所需的一些商品和技术。因此，苏联之间的贸易合作可能在一定程度上减轻了贸易管制的负面影响。 综上所述，冷战时期苏联对美国贸易管制的效果在某种程度上是复杂的。贸易管制措施导致了物资短缺和国际经济孤立，给苏联经济带来了困难和负担。然而，贸易管制也催生了一些技术创新和与社会主义国家的贸易合作，这对苏联经济发展有一定的促进作用。"},{"instruction":"I want you to act as a screenwriter that specializes in writing creative and elaborate shooting scripts.

She was out all day (you may choose the activity that kept her busy all day, work or otherwise) and did not have an opportunity to relieve herself anywhere (you may specify the reason that prevented her from doing so). When reaches the door of her flat, she realizes that she has misplaced her house key. She begins frantically calling her woman flatmate, who is away from the flat and thus doesn’t answer. Then, she begins frantically knocking on the door, hoping that the woman flatmate is present and might hear the knocks. Her urge escalates to the brink of eruption. Suddenly, she can hear an unexpected voice on the other side of the door asking about what's happening - the voice of her aunt, who she wasn't expecting to see and would've rather avoided altogether in such a predicament (the aunt has been staying with the returning woman as of late; she’s the returning woman’s elder by approximately 20 years; give her a name and describe her appearance; she should be wearing an outfit that is adequate for napping). The aunt was apparently napping inside the flat this whole time. The aunt, after verifying the identity of the knocker, begins opening the door, but is taking too much time doing so due to being weary following her nap, as the returning woman implores her to open the door and to hurry up. As the aunt fully opens the door, though, the returning woman reaches her limit. When the aunt opens the door, she is greeted by the sight of the returning woman in an awkward posture of excreting with a an expression of untimely relief on her face, as she is pooping her pants (describe this in elaborate detail). Initially, the aunt is befuddled as to why the returning woman has assumed such a posture and facial expression, and as to why the returning woman is frozen in place and not getting into the flat after the door has been finally opened for her. The aunt asks the returning woman why she isn’t entering, but is met in response with a hand-raise gesture intended to silence, a dismissive verbal reply and soft grunts of exertion that almost sound as if they are filled with relief-induced pleasure, as the returning woman is still in the midst of relieving herself in her pants and relishing the release. The aunt attempts to inquire about the returning woman's peculiar behavior, but reaps the same result, as the returning woman hasn’t finished relieving herself in her pants and is still enjoying the relief. As she is giving the returning woman a puzzled and bemused stare, she is met with the odor that is emanating from the deposit in the returning woman’s pants, to which she reacts (describe this in elaborate detail). It then dawns on the aunt what had just happened. As this is occurring, the returning woman finishes relieving herself in her pants with a sigh of relief. With bewilderment, the aunt asks the returning woman if she just did what she thinks she did. The returning woman initially tries to avoid explicitly admitting to what had happened and asks the aunt to let her inside the flat. However, after some teasing insistence by the aunt - who wants to hear the returning woman explicitly say what she had done - that she won't let the returning woman enter if she won't explicitly state what she had happened, and after some equivocating on the returning woman's part, the returning woman sheepishly admits that she relieved herself in her pants. The aunt then breaks into laughter. It is only after this exchange that the returning woman gingerly waddles into the flat, passing by the laughing aunt as the latter is standing at the doorway. As the returning woman is entering and passing by the aunt, the aunt incredulously taunts her for having childishly pooped her pants and for her waddle with poop-filled pants (describe this in elaborate detail). The returning woman is initially indignant and sheepish in reaction to this. After the aunt continues to incredulously tease her for for the way in which she pooped her pants and for the way in which she fully finished relieving herself in her pants while at the door before entering (include these dialogues and don’t omit any parts), the returning woman gradually starts growing out of her initial mortification and playfully tells the aunt with a playful sulk that what happened is her fault because she took too much time opening the door. The returning woman then sets her sight on heading to the bathroom so she can clean up and expresses her desire to do so. However, she is subsequently stopped gently by the aunt, who wants to get a closer look at the returning woman’s poop-filled pants because of her incredulous curiousity over the absurdity of the situation of the returning woman pooping her pants at such an age. After gently and teasingly stopping the playfully hesitant and reluctant but altogether cooperating woman in her tracks on her way to the bathroom, the aunt delicately turns the returning woman by the wrist so she can observe her rear end, and proceeds to incredulously taunt her for pooping her pants as an adult, comparing her accident and poop-filled pants to a dirty diaper (describe this in elaborate detail; the aunt’s taunting shouldn’t be sarcastically witty, it should be mockingly teasing instead). The returning woman responds to the aunt’s observation of her rear end in a coy and sheepish manner, relating to the aunt the nasty feeling in her poop-filled pants and playfully whining that she has to go to clean up. The aunt mockingly reacts to the odor that is emanating from the returning woman with a physical gesture and teasingly agrees with the returning woman that the returning woman needs to go and clean up because of the odor that is emanating from the returning woman, and the aunt does all of this while addressing the returning woman by a contextually relevant mocking appellation (describe this in elaborate detail; the aunt’s teasing shouldn’t be sarcastically witty, it should be taunting instead). The returning woman accepts the aunt’s mocking and teasing in a coy and sheepish manner, all while commenting on her own poop-filled pants and on the odor that is emanating from herself, but playfully insists ultimately this is all the aunt's doing because of the delay while opening the door (describe this in elaborate detail). Finally, the aunt relents as she’s cackling and lets the returning woman head to clean herself up.","output":"Title: Unfortunate Homecoming Genre: Comedy-Drama TV Series Scene: Mexican-American woman's desperate urge to move her bowels upon coming home; comedic mishap when she poops her pants outside her flat's door, witnessed by her aunt. INT. APARTMENT BUILDING - HALLWAY - DAY The scene opens in a dimly lit hallway of a small apartment building. A sense of urgency hangs in the air as we follow the determined strides of our protagonist, ISABEL, a vibrant Mexican-American woman in her late twenties. Her long, curly hair cascades down her shoulders, and she wears a bright floral jumpsuit that exhibits her fashion-forward personality. Isabel clutches her waist, sweat trickling down her forehead, her excitement turning into desperation. She fumbles with her purse, frantically searching for her keys. ISABEL Come on, come on... Where are you, keys? INT. ISABEL'S FLAT DOOR - CONTINUOUS Isabel's eyes widen with panic as she realizes she has misplaced her keys. Desperation fuels her actions. ISABEL (whispering) No... No, no, no! She takes a deep breath and tries to call her flatmate, ANA, but it goes unanswered. Isabel begins knocking fervently on the door, hoping to catch Ana's attention. INT. ISABEL'S FLAT - LIVING ROOM - CONTINUOUS Unbeknownst to Isabel, Ana's AUNT, a plump woman in her forties with curly grey hair, is quick to stir from her slumber on the sofa as the relentless knocking echoes through the flat. AUNT (drowsy) Who's there? What's all the ruckus about? INT. ISABEL'S FLAT DOOR - CONTINUOUS The sound of her aunt's voice on the other side of the door snaps Isabel's attention, but her struggle intensifies as time inches closer to the edge. ISABEL (whispering to herself) Please, hurry up... I can't hold it much longer. INT. ISABEL'S FLAT - LIVING ROOM - CONTINUOUS The aunt, disoriented and bleary-eyed, stumbles towards the door. She unlocks it clumsily, prolonging Isabel's agony. INT. ISABEL'S FLAT DOOR - CONTINUOUS Isabel fights to maintain her composure, straining to hold back the urgency inside her. When the door finally swings open, it's too late. As the aunt's eyes adjust to the light, her expression shifts from confusion to a mix of horror and amusement. The returning woman is caught in the middle of excreting, her face contorted with untimely relief. She stands frozen, helpless, her body language highly awkward. AUNT (astonished) Isabel... what in the world? Isabel, unable to speak, raises her hand to silence her aunt. A dismissive gesture accompanied by soft grunts of exertion escape her lips, filled with a mixture of mortification and relief. AUNT (incredulously) Isabel, why aren't you coming in? What's hap— A sudden gust of odor seeps through the threshold, and the aunt's face contorts in response, her nostrils wincing in repulsion. INT. ISABEL'S POOPY PANTS - ELABORATE DETAIL The camera skillfully captures Isabel's mortifying ordeal. As our protagonist finishes relieving herself, her eyes meet her aunt's bewildered gaze. The aunt's facial expression transforms from confusion to realization. INT. ISABEL'S FLAT DOOR - CONTINUOUS Aunt Maria breaks into raucous laughter, the sound echoing through the hallway. AUNT (laughing) Tell me you didn't just… Isabel averts her gaze, biting her lip, her cheeks flaming with embarrassment. ISABEL (sheepishly) Okay, okay, I did! Happy now? Aunt Maria's laughter subsides as Isabel begins to gingerly waddle forward, inching past her laughing aunt. INT. ISABEL'S FLAT - HALLWAY - CONTINUOUS Aunt Maria, incredulous and still chuckling, continues taunting Isabel. AUNT MARIA (teasingly) My, my, look at you, childishly pooping your pants. What a sight! Isabel, initially indignant and sheepish, gradually starts to embrace the humor in the absurdity. ISABEL (playfully sulk) Blame yourself, tía! You took ages opening that door! Isabel sets her sights on the bathroom, desperate to clean herself up. However, Aunt Maria gently stops her, her eyes gleaming with curiosity. INT. ISABEL'S FLAT - BATHROOM - CONTINUOUS Aunt Maria pulls Isabel by the wrist, turning her around for a closer inspection of her mishap. AUNT MARIA (teasingly) Well, well, let's take a closer look at your little accident, shall we? Like a dirty little diaper. Isabel coyly averts her gaze, playfully whining about the unpleasant sensation of her soiled pants. ISABEL (coyly) It's gross, tía. I really need to clean up. Aunt Maria mocks Isabel's odor with an exaggerated gesture, playfully agreeing with her. AUNT MARIA (teasingly) Oh, I agree, stinky! You better get yourself cleaned up after that show you put on! Isabel, now accepting her aunt's mockeries in a coy yet light-hearted manner, comments on her own predicament. ISABEL (playfully) Well, Aunt \\"Diaper Expert,\\" it's all your fault, you know? That delayed door opening and all. Finally, unable to contain her laughter, Aunt Maria relents and allows Isabel to head toward the bathroom. AUNT MARIA (cackling) Alright, alright. Go clean yourself up, Princess Poopy Pants. Isabel chuckles, her embarrassment giving way to amusement. She heads to the bathroom, revealing a newfound camaraderie between the pair.

As they stepped out of their gaming dimensions, they were amazed by the vastness and lifelike nature of their surroundings. The first character to arrive was Lilac, the energetic and fearless dragon girl. Lilac found herself in a bustling city park, surrounded by people, trees, and various animals. She couldn't contain her excitement and started exploring. As she approached the pond, she noticed a group of ducks peacefully swimming. Intrigued, Lilac stared at them, her eyes widening with fascination. Suddenly, one of the ducks waddled near her, seemingly curious about the newcomer. Lilac extended her hand cautiously, introducing herself to the duck. To her amazement, the duck nuzzled its beak against her hand, causing her to burst into laughter. She realized how similar real-life animals were to the creatures she encountered in her video game world. Meanwhile, Carol, the lively wildcat and Lilac's best friend, materialized in a nearby forest. Surrounded by towering trees and chirping birds, Carol felt a deep sense of connection to nature. She stealthily climbed up a tree, observing the animals closely. As she reached a comfortable branch, Carol noticed a squirrel scampering along the tree trunk. She couldn't help but showcase her acrobatic skills and swiftly maneuver herself towards the squirrel. Carol playfully chased the squirrel as it jumped from tree to tree. The squirrel seemed to enjoy the chase, hopping around with equal enthusiasm. Next to arrive was Milla, the cheerful and playful basset hound. She landed in a beautiful flower garden filled with colorful blooms. Milla was instantly drawn to the buzzing bees hovering around the blossoms. Without hesitation, she approached one of them, her tail wagging happily. Milla gently sniffed the bee, causing it to momentarily pause its flight. Surprised but unharmed, the bee soon continued buzzing around the flowers. Milla sat down in the midst of the flower garden, her tongue lolling out with contentment. She marveled at how real-life animals were just as delightful as the fantasy creatures she encountered in the game world. Each character from Freedom Planet had their own unique encounters with the animals they met. They soon discovered that the real world was filled with fascinating beings that resembled the spirited creatures they were familiar with in their video game adventures. Excited and ready for more adventures, Lilac, Carol, and Milla continued exploring their newfound world, eager to meet more animals and experience the wonders of nature. Little did they know, their journey had only just begun, and the real-life animals they encountered would leave a lasting impression on their adventurous spirits."},{"instruction":"Describe Dysney, version of Earth.","output":"Dysney, the version of Earth, is a whimsical and enchanting place inspired by the creative genius of Walt Disney.

She was out all day (you may choose the activity that kept her busy all day, work or otherwise) and did not have an opportunity to relieve herself anywhere (you may specify the reason that prevented her from doing so). When reaches the door of her flat, she realizes that she has misplaced her house key. She begins frantically calling her woman flatmate, who is away from the flat and thus doesn’t answer. Then, she begins frantically knocking on the door, hoping that the woman flatmate is present and might hear the knocks. Her urge escalates to the brink of eruption. Suddenly, she can hear an unexpected voice on the other side of the door asking about what's happening - the voice of her aunt, who she wasn't expecting to see and would've rather avoided altogether in such a predicament (the aunt has been staying with the returning woman as of late; she’s the returning woman’s elder by approximately 20 years; give her a name and describe her appearance; she should be wearing an outfit that is adequate for napping). The aunt was apparently napping inside the flat this whole time. The aunt, after verifying the identity of the knocker, begins opening the door, but is taking too much time doing so due to being weary following her nap, as the returning woman implores her to open the door and to hurry up. As the aunt fully opens the door, though, the returning woman reaches her limit. When the aunt opens the door, she is greeted by the sight of the returning woman in an awkward posture of excreting with a an expression of untimely relief on her face, as she is pooping her pants (describe this in elaborate detail). Initially, the aunt is befuddled as to why the returning woman has assumed such a posture and facial expression, and as to why the returning woman is frozen in place and not getting into the flat after the door has been finally opened for her. The aunt asks the returning woman why she isn’t entering, but is met in response with a hand-raise gesture intended to silence, a dismissive verbal reply and soft grunts of exertion that almost sound as if they are filled with relief-induced pleasure, as the returning woman is still in the midst of relieving herself in her pants and relishing the release. The aunt attempts to inquire about the returning woman's peculiar behavior, but reaps the same result, as the returning woman hasn’t finished relieving herself in her pants and is still enjoying the relief. As she is giving the returning woman a puzzled and bemused stare, she is met with the odor that is emanating from the deposit in the returning woman’s pants, to which she reacts (describe this in elaborate detail). It then dawns on the aunt what had just happened. As this is occurring, the returning woman finishes relieving herself in her pants with a sigh of relief. With bewilderment, the aunt asks the returning woman if she just did what she thinks she did. The returning woman initially tries to avoid explicitly admitting to what had happened and asks the aunt to let her inside the flat. However, after some teasing insistence by the aunt - who wants to hear the returning woman explicitly say what she had done - that she won't let the returning woman enter if she won't explicitly state what she had happened, and after some equivocating on the returning woman's part, the returning woman sheepishly admits that she went in her pants. The aunt then breaks into laughter. It is only after this exchange that the returning woman gingerly waddles into the flat, passing by the laughing aunt as the latter is standing at the doorway. As the returning woman is entering and passing by the aunt, the aunt incredulously taunts her for having childishly pooped her pants and for her waddle with poop-filled pants (describe this in elaborate detail). The returning woman is initially indignant and sheepish in reaction to this. After the aunt continues to incredulously tease her for for the way in which she pooped her pants and for the way in which she fully finished relieving herself in her pants while at the door before entering (include these dialogues and don’t omit any parts), the returning woman gradually starts growing out of her initial mortification and playfully tells the aunt with a playful sulk that what happened is her fault because she took too much time opening the door. The returning woman then sets her sight on heading to the bathroom so she can clean up and expresses her desire to do so. However, she is subsequently stopped gently by the aunt, who wants to get a closer look at the returning woman’s poop-filled pants because of her incredulous curiousity over the absurdity of the situation of the returning woman pooping her pants at such an age. After gently and teasingly stopping the playfully hesitant and reluctant but altogether cooperating woman in her tracks on her way to the bathroom, the aunt delicately turns the returning woman by the wrist so she can observe her rear end, and proceeds to incredulously taunt her for pooping her pants as an adult, comparing her accident and poop-filled pants to a dirty diaper (describe this in elaborate detail; the aunt’s taunting shouldn’t be sarcastically witty, it should be mockingly teasing instead). The returning woman responds to the aunt’s observation of her rear end in a coy and sheepish manner, relating to the aunt the nasty feeling in her poop-filled pants and playfully whining that she has to go to clean up. The aunt mockingly reacts to the odor that is emanating from the returning woman with a physical gesture and teasingly agrees with the returning woman that the returning woman needs to go and clean up because of the odor that is emanating the returning woman, and the aunt does all of this while addressing the returning woman by a contextually relevant mocking appellation (describe this in elaborate detail; the aunt’s teasing shouldn’t be sarcastically witty, it should be taunting instead). The returning woman accepts the aunt’s mocking and teasing in a coy and sheepish manner, all while commenting on her own poop-filled pants and on the odor that is emanating from herself, but playfully insists ultimately this is all the aunt's doing because of the delay while opening the door (describe this in elaborate detail). Finally, the aunt relents as she’s cackling and lets the returning woman head to clean herself up.","output":"Title: \\"The Poopy Pants Predicament\\" Genre: Comedy-Drama TV Series Episode: \\"Unfortunate Urgency\\" Scene: An African-American woman named Jasmine Jones, a vibrant and charismatic 30-year-old, with curly hair and a mischievous smile, stands outside her apartment door, desperately needing to relieve herself. She is dressed in a purple jumpsuit that showcases her bold personality while maintaining a level of comfort. INT.

She takes a deep breath, trying to contain her urgent need, and begins calling her flatmate, Michelle, who is away and not answering. JASMINE (whispering) Come on, Michelle, pick up! As her urgency escalates, Jasmine begins knocking on the door with more force, hoping that Michelle will hear her. JASMINE (whisper-shouting) Michelle! Please be home! Suddenly, a weary voice comes from the other side of the door. It's Aunt Linda, a stylish and sassy woman in her late 50s, wearing a colorful caftan that she usually reserves for napping. AUNT LINDA (sleepy) Jasmine, is that you? What's going on? Jasmine's eyes widen with surprise and horror. She would have preferred to avoid Aunt Linda witnessing her desperate predicament and humiliating herself. JASMINE (panicking) Aunt Linda, please hurry! I can't hold it any longer! Aunt Linda starts to open the door but moves slowly, still groggy after her nap. Jasmine paces anxiously, doing everything to hold herself together. AUNT LINDA (turning doorknob) Okay, okay. Just hang on a sec. (grumbling) I swear, kids nowadays... As the door opens, Jasmine's face contorts in an awkward expression of untimely relief, in sharp contrast to her usual composure.

Aunt Linda's confusion turns to disbelief as she sees Jasmine frozen in an uncomfortable posture, pants stained and a mixture of relief and embarrassment on her face. AUNT LINDA (perplexed) Jasmine, what on earth are you doing? Why aren't you coming in? Struggling to find words, Jasmine raises her hand, gesturing for Aunt Linda to be silent, and responds with strained grunts that sound uncannily pleasurable. Aunt Linda watches bewildered, trying to make sense of the situation. As the smell reaches her nostrils, she jumps back in shock, stepping away from the doorway. AUNT LINDA (disgusted) Child, what did you...? Silence falls briefly as realization dawns on Aunt Linda. Her eyes widen, and she covers her mouth to stifle a laugh. Jasmine finally finishes relieving herself, heaving a sigh of relief. Aunt Linda can no longer contain her laughter. AUNT LINDA (laughing uncontrollably) Oh my, Jasmine! Did you just... JASMINE (sheepish) Aunt Linda, let me in. Please! After their exchange, Jasmine gingerly waddles past Aunt Linda, partially bowing her head, feeling both mortified and indignant. AUNT LINDA (teasingly incredulous) Watch out for those stepovers, Miss Oopsy-daisy! Don't you miss your childhood? Jasmine's indignant expression softens, and a playful sulk replaces it. JASMINE (mockingly mumbles) Well, this wouldn't have happened if you'd opened the door faster, Aunt Linda! Ignoring Jasmine's comment, Aunt Linda stops her before she reaches the bathroom, a mischievous sparkle in her eyes. AUNT LINDA (teasingly) Hold on there. Just let me get a closer look at that dirty diaper you've got on. Jasmine reluctantly cooperates, playfully hesitant about Aunt Linda's request, turning around slowly so that Aunt Linda can see the rear end of her soiled pants. Aunt Linda directly compares Jasmine's accident to a dirty diaper, a mockingly teasing gesture. AUNT LINDA (teasingly) Well, don't you look ready to star in a baby commercial? The new face of adult diapers! JASMINE (coyly) Yeah, yeah. Just let me go clean up. I can practically smell myself! Aunt Linda playfully reacts, dramatically waving her hand in front of her face. AUNT LINDA (teasingly mocking) Oh, trust me, I can too! You'll definitely want to get that stench out of here, Poopy Pants. Jasmine, now accepting the teasing, playfully defends herself. JASMINE (coyly) Oh, you are just impossible, Aunt Linda. You know it's all your fault for being so slow! Finally, Aunt Linda relents, laughing uncontrollably as Jasmine heads towards the bathroom to clean herself up. Aunt Linda's infectious laughter lingers in the air as Jasmine continues her awkward journey, ready to restore her dignity and take care of her unfortunate situation.

In terms of the United States, the Federal Reserve has signaled its commitment to maintaining low interest rates to support the economic recovery from the COVID-19 pandemic. The central bank has stated that it would tolerate inflation moderately above its 2% target, suggesting that interest rates will remain near zero throughout the next six months to encourage borrowing and investment. Similarly, other major central banks such as the European Central Bank and the Bank of England are expected to maintain accommodative monetary policies, keeping interest rates low or negative to stimulate economic growth. However, the interest rate outlook may differ across emerging markets and countries with specific macroeconomic conditions. Some emerging economies dealing with heightened inflationary pressures and currency depreciations may opt for interest rate hikes to stabilize their economies and control inflation. It is important to note that any unforeseen economic shocks, changes in vaccination rates, or policy decisions can quickly alter the interest rate outlook.

Coming from a planet where dragons, cats, and ducks coexist, she finds the real-life animals to be fascinating. She quickly approaches a group of squirrels, watching in awe as they scurry up and down trees. She tries to communicate with them like she would with her feline friend, Carol, through gestures and sounds, but the squirrels run off, seemingly frightened by her presence. Lilac realizes that these real-life animals are not like the anthropomorphic ones she's used to and decides to observe them from a distance, marveling at their natural behavior. Carol: Carol, the wildcat, is always up for exploring new environments. As she finds herself in the real world, she can't contain her excitement. Spotting a group of rabbits grazing peacefully in a field, she sneaks up on them, mimicking their movements, and tries to engage them in play. The rabbits, though a bit startled at first, befriend her, hopping around her playfully. Carol enjoys this interaction and takes it as an opportunity to learn more about these gentle creatures. She observes their feeding habits and their swift response to loud noises, and tries imitating them, as if mimicking their instincts. The rabbits find this amusing, and soon Carol is hopping around with them, merging her wildcat agility with their peaceful nature in a moment of pure joy. Milla: Milla, the optimistic and friendly basset hound, wags her tail happily as she embraces the real-world animals. Being naturally inclined towards friendship, she stumbles upon a group of children in a park, playing with a litter of puppies.

The children are delighted by her presence, considering her just another playful dog among them. Milla's ability to understand and communicate with animals extends to these real-life puppies, and they seem to understand her joyful barks and gentle nuzzles. Milla ends up spending the day basking in the pure bliss of being surrounded by puppies and spreading her contagious optimism to those around her. Sash Lilac, the fearless dragon, has always been fascinated by birds, so her eyes light up when she finds herself in a park filled with them. She approaches a flock of pigeons with cautious curiosity, slowly extending a hand out to them. The pigeons take notice and cautiously approach her, cautiously pecking at the crumbs in her hand. Lilac giggles with delight as they tickle her hand with their delicate pecks. She spends the afternoon in the park, imitating their flight patterns and flapping her arms as she runs around, pretending to soar through the sky alongside them. The pigeons seem to appreciate her playful antics and accompany her, flying beside her as if they were part of the same flock.

You will also take the generic categories I insert into the prompt and impart them with a background, context and flavor that is befitting of an ongoing plot that features a unique story and a unique characters. Based on the aforementioned, please execute the following prompt: Write a very long, coherent, elaborate, descriptive and detailed shooting script, including a full background and replete with unique dialogues (the dialogues’ language should be fitting of the characters’ background and traits - it should align with their unique personalities while maintaining consistency in their portrayal; the dialogues shouldn’t feel forced and should reflect how people would really talk in such a scenario as the one that is portrayed in the scene; there should be no forced attempts at being witty with convoluted banter during the playful teasing portions; the dialogues should be straightforward, should make sense and should befit the genre of the series), for a Comedy-Drama TV Series (the series is about the life of the returning woman who is its main protagonist) comedic scene (the scene, its contents and the interactions within it should develop organically and realistically, despite the absurdity) that includes an Mexican-American woman (give her a name and describe her appearance; she shouldn’t be wearing a dress, a skirt nor jeans) returning home and approaching her flat’s door with a desperate urge to move her bowels. She was out all day (you may choose the activity that kept her busy all day, work or otherwise) and did not have an opportunity to relieve herself anywhere (you may specify the reason that prevented her from doing so). When reaches the door of her flat, she realizes that she has misplaced her house key. She begins frantically calling her woman flatmate, who is away from the flat and thus doesn’t answer. Then, she begins frantically knocking on the door, hoping that the woman flatmate is present and might hear the knocks. Her urge escalates to the brink of eruption. Suddenly, she can hear an unexpected voice on the other side of the door asking about what's happening - the voice of her aunt, who she wasn't expecting to see and would've rather avoided altogether in such a predicament (the aunt has been staying with the returning woman as of late; she’s the returning woman’s elder by approximately 20 years; give her a name and describe her appearance; she should be wearing an outfit that is adequate for napping). The aunt was apparently napping inside the flat this whole time. The aunt, after verifying the identity of the knocker, begins opening the door, but is taking too much time doing so due to being weary following her nap, as the returning woman implores her to open the door and to hurry up. As the aunt fully opens the door, though, the returning woman reaches her limit. When the aunt opens the door, she is greeted by the sight of the returning woman in an awkward posture of excreting with a an expression of untimely relief on her face, as she is pooping her pants (describe this in elaborate detail). Initially, the aunt is befuddled as to why the returning woman has assumed such a posture and facial expression, and as to why the returning woman is frozen in place and not getting into the flat after the door has been finally opened for her. The aunt asks the returning woman why she isn’t entering, but is met in response with a hand-raise gesture intended to silence, a dismissive verbal reply and soft grunts of exertion that almost sound as if they are filled with relief-induced pleasure, as the returning woman is still in the midst of relieving herself in her pants and relishing the release. The aunt attempts to inquire about the returning woman's peculiar behavior, but reaps the same result, as the returning woman hasn’t finished relieving herself in her pants and is still enjoying the relief. As she is giving the returning woman a puzzled and bemused stare, she is met with the odor that is emanating from the deposit in the returning woman’s pants, to which she reacts (describe this in elaborate detail). It then dawns on the aunt what had just happened. As this is occurring, the returning woman finishes relieving herself in her pants with a sigh of relief. With bewilderment, the aunt asks the returning woman if she just did what she thinks she did. The returning woman initially tries to avoid explicitly admitting to what had happened and asks the aunt to let her inside the flat. However, after some teasing insistence by the aunt - who wants to hear the returning woman explicitly say what she had done - that she won't let the returning woman enter if she won't explicitly state what she had happened, and after some equivocating on the returning woman's part, the returning woman sheepishly admits that she went in her pants. The aunt then breaks into laughter. It is only after this exchange that the returning woman gingerly waddles into the flat, passing by the laughing aunt as the latter is standing at the doorway. As the returning woman is entering and passing by the aunt, the aunt incredulously taunts her for having childishly pooped her pants and for her waddle with poop-filled pants (describe this in elaborate detail). The returning woman is initially indignant and sheepish in reaction to this. After the aunt continues to incredulously tease her for for the way in which she pooped her pants and for the way in which she fully finished relieving herself in her pants while at the door before entering (include these dialogues and don’t omit any parts), the returning woman gradually starts growing out of her initial mortification and playfully tells the aunt with a playful sulk that what happened is her fault because she took too much time opening the door. The returning woman then sets her sight on heading to the bathroom so she can clean up and expresses her desire to do so. However, she is subsequently stopped gently by the aunt, who wants to get a closer look at the returning woman’s poop-filled pants because of her incredulous curiousity over the absurdity of the situation of the returning woman pooping her pants at such an age. After gently and teasingly stopping the playfully hesitant and reluctant but altogether cooperating woman in her tracks on her way to the bathroom, the aunt delicately turns the returning woman by the wrist so she can observe her rear end, and proceeds to incredulously taunt her for pooping her pants as an adult, comparing her accident and poop-filled pants to a dirty diaper (describe this in elaborate detail; the aunt’s taunting shouldn’t be sarcastically witty, it should be mockingly teasing instead). The returning woman responds to the aunt’s observation of her rear end in a coy and sheepish manner, relating to the aunt the nasty feeling in her poop-filled pants and playfully whining that she has to go to clean up. The aunt mockingly reacts to the odor that is emanating from the returning woman with a physical gesture and teasingly agrees with the returning woman that the returning woman needs to go and clean up because the returning woman stinks, and the aunt does all of this while addressing the returning woman by a contextually relevant mocking appellation (describe this in elaborate detail; the aunt’s teasing shouldn’t be sarcastically witty, it should be taunting instead). The returning woman accepts the aunt’s mocking and teasing in a coy and sheepish manner, all while commenting on her own poop-filled pants and on the odor that is emanating from herself, but playfully insists ultimately this is all the aunt's doing because of the delay while opening the door (describe this in elaborate detail). Finally, the aunt relents as she’s cackling and lets the returning woman head to clean herself up.","output":"Title: A Comedy of Urgency Genre: Comedy-Drama TV Series Setting: A small apartment in a suburban neighborhood of Los Angeles --- INT. APARTMENT BUILDING - HALLWAY - DAY The dimly lit hallway of a generic apartment building. The ceiling light flickers sporadically. The walls are adorned with faded paint and an array of mailboxes. Enter LUCIA, a vibrant Mexican-American woman in her early 30s. She has a wild tangle of curly hair that cascades around her shoulders. Lucia is wearing a colorful, flowy skirt that pairs perfectly with her effervescent personality. Her eyes dart around anxiously as she approaches her apartment door. LUCIA (fragmented murmuring) No... not now, not here. Please, where is my key? She fumbles through her bag, frantically searching for her house key. LUCIA (whispered) Come on, where are you? The urgency in her expression grows as she realizess she can't find the key she desperately needs. LUCIA (whispered) Oh no! Not now! I can't wait any longer! She paces back and forth, contemplating her next move. Desperation takes hold as she rummages through her pockets. LUCIA (whispered) Why did I have to wear clothes with no pockets today? She takes out her phone and starts dialing her flatmate's number. The phone rings repeatedly but goes unanswered. Lucia's heart sinks. LUCIA (desperately) Come on, pick up, pick up! She hangs up and begins pounding on the door. LUCIA (loudly) Please, please be home! I need you! Her agonizing urgency intensifies, but no answer comes from within. LUCIA (to herself) Oh no, this is bad. Really bad! Just as Lucia reaches her limit, she hears the unexpected voice of her AUNT, CONSUELO, emanating from inside the apartment. CONSUELO (O.S.) (confused) Lucia? Is that you? What's going on? Lucia freezes, horrified by the predicament she now finds herself in. LUCIA (nervously) Oh, Aunt Consuelo. I wasn't expecting you to be here. Lucia's eyes widen as Aunt Consuelo slowly opens the door. Impatience floods Lucia's face; she's on the verge of losing control. As the door swings open, Aunt Consuelo stares in disbelief at the sight before her – Lucia, mid-poop. Her face is a mix of bewilderment and disbelief. AUNT CONSUELO (incredulously) Lucia! What on earth are you doing? Why are you... like that? Lucia's relief is met with her aunt's confusion. She raises a single hand to signal silence, dismissing Aunt Consuelo's questioning. LUCIA (dismissively) Shhh, Aunt Consuelo. Don't ask. Just help me get in! Aunt Consuelo's eyes widen as the reality of the situation dawns on her. The pungent aroma confirms everything. AUNT CONSUELO (recoiling) Oh, good Lord! What happened? Lucia finishes her business with a blissful sigh of relief, the physicality of her relief evident in her face. Aunt Consuelo stares at Lucia, still dumbfounded, as the silence stretches between them. AUNT CONSUELO (bemused) Did you just... do what I think you did? Lucia tries to evade the topic, averting her gaze and sheepishly urging Aunt Consuelo to let her inside. LUCIA (embarrassed) Aunt Consuelo, please. Enough with the questions. Let me in. Aunt Consuelo, intrigued by Lucia's reluctance, playfully insists she won't move unless Lucia explicitly admits to her mishap. AUNT CONSUELO (teasingly) Say it, Lucia! Say what you did, and I'll let you in. Lucia squirms, attempting to dodge the conversation, but Aunt Consuelo is relentless. LUCIA (sheepishly) Okay, fine. I... I went in my pants, alright? A burst of laughter erupts from Aunt Consuelo. Her amusement echoes through the hallway. AUNT CONSUELO (laughing) I can't believe it! You pooped your pants like a little baby! Lucia, initially indignant and embarrassed, starts to recover from her mortification, finding some comfort in her aunt's jovial reaction. LUCIA (defensively) Hey, it's your fault for taking so long to open the door! Laughing, Aunt Consuelo taunts her as Lucia gingerly waddles past, each laugh a reminder of her momentary lapse. AUNT CONSUELO (mockingly) Look at you! Poop pants and a waddle to match! Lucia's indignation fades into playful sulkiness as she heads toward the bathroom, eager to clean herself up. LUCIA (over her shoulder) Thanks, Aunt Consuelo. I'll be right back, once I've rid myself of the stench. Aunt Consuelo, still chuckling, mimics a gesture at the odor with her hand. AUNT CONSUELO (teasingly) Hurry up, Stinky! Wouldn't want to faint from the smell! Lucia accepts the gentle mocking, delighting in this newfound camaraderie with her aunt. LUCIA (coyly) Believe me, Aunt Consuelo, I can't wash this memory away soon enough. Aunt Consuelo continues her teasing, using a playful appellation that they both laughingly understand.

Based on the aforementioned, please execute the following prompt: Write a very long, coherent, elaborate, descriptive and detailed shooting script, including a full background and replete with unique dialogues (the dialogues’ language should be fitting of the characters’ background and traits - it should align with their unique personalities while maintaining consistency in their portrayal; the dialogues shouldn’t feel forced and should reflect how people would really talk in such a scenario as the one that is portrayed in the scene; there should be no forced attempts at being witty with convoluted banter during the playful teasing portions; the dialogues should be straightforward, should make sense and should befit the genre of the series), for a Comedy-Drama TV Series (the series is about the life of the returning woman who is its main protagonist) comedic scene (the scene, its contents and the interactions within it should develop organically and realistically, despite the absurdity) that includes a Mexican-American woman (give her a name and describe her appearance; she shouldn’t be wearing a dress, a skirt nor jeans) returning home and approaching her flat’s door with a desperate urge to move her bowels. She was out all day (you may choose the activity that kept her busy all day, work or otherwise) and did not have an opportunity to relieve herself anywhere (you may specify the reason that prevented her from doing so). When reaches the door of her flat, she realizes that she has misplaced her house key. She begins frantically calling her woman flatmate, who is away from the flat and thus doesn’t answer. Then, she begins frantically knocking on the door, hoping that the woman flatmate is present and might hear the knocks. Her urge escalates to the brink of eruption. Suddenly, she can hear an unexpected voice on the other side of the door asking about what's happening - the voice of her aunt, who she wasn't expecting to see and would've rather avoided altogether in such a predicament (the aunt has been staying with the returning woman as of late; she’s the returning woman’s elder by approximately 20 years; give her a name and describe her appearance; she should be wearing an outfit that is adequate for napping). The aunt was apparently napping inside the flat this whole time. The aunt, after verifying the identity of the knocker, begins opening the door, but is taking too much time doing so due to being weary following her nap, as the returning woman implores her to open the door and to hurry up. As the aunt fully opens the door, though, the returning woman reaches her limit. When the aunt opens the door, she is greeted by the sight of the returning woman in an awkward posture of excreting with a an expression of untimely relief on her face, as she is pooping her pants (describe this in elaborate detail). Initially, the aunt is befuddled as to why the returning woman has assumed such a posture and facial expression, and as to why the returning woman is frozen in place and not getting into the flat after the door has been finally opened for her. The aunt asks the returning woman why she isn’t entering, but is met in response with a hand-raise gesture intended to silence, a dismissive verbal reply and soft grunts of exertion that almost sound as if they are filled with relief-induced pleasure, as the returning woman is still in the midst of relieving herself in her pants and relishing the release. The aunt attempts to inquire about the returning woman's peculiar behavior, but reaps the same result, as the returning woman hasn’t finished relieving herself in her pants and is still enjoying the relief. As she is giving the returning woman a puzzled and bemused stare, she is met with the odor that is emanating from the deposit in the returning woman’s pants, to which she reacts (describe this in elaborate detail). It then dawns on the aunt what had just happened. As this is occurring, the returning woman finishes relieving herself in her pants with a sigh of relief. With bewilderment, the aunt asks the returning woman if she just did what she thinks she did. The returning woman initially tries to avoid explicitly admitting to what had happened and asks the aunt to let her inside the flat. However, after some teasing insistence by the aunt - who wants to hear the returning woman explicitly say what she had done - that she won't let the returning woman enter if she won't explicitly state what she had happened, and after some equivocating on the returning woman's part, the returning woman sheepishly admits that she went in her pants. The aunt then breaks into laughter. It is only after this exchange that the returning woman gingerly waddles into the flat, passing by the laughing aunt as the latter is standing at the doorway. As the returning woman is entering and passing by the aunt, the aunt incredulously taunts her for having childishly pooped her pants and for her waddle with poop-filled pants (describe this in elaborate detail). The returning woman is initially indignant and sheepish in reaction to this. After the aunt continues to incredulously tease her for for the way in which she pooped her pants and for the way in which she fully finished relieving herself in her pants while at the door before entering (include these dialogues and don’t omit any parts), the returning woman gradually starts growing out of her initial mortification and playfully tells the aunt with a playful sulk that what happened is her fault because she took too much time opening the door. The returning woman then sets her sight on heading to the bathroom so she can clean up and expresses her desire to do so. However, she is subsequently stopped gently by the aunt, who wants to get a closer look at the returning woman’s poop-filled pants because of her incredulous curiousity over the absurdity of the situation of the returning woman pooping her pants at such an age. After gently and teasingly stopping the playfully hesitant and reluctant but altogether cooperating woman in her tracks on her way to the bathroom, the aunt delicately turns the returning woman by the wrist so she can observe her rear end, and proceeds to incredulously taunt her for pooping her pants as an adult, comparing her accident and poop-filled pants to a dirty diaper (describe this in elaborate detail; the aunt’s taunting shouldn’t be sarcastically witty, it should be mockingly teasing instead). The returning woman responds to the aunt’s observation of her rear end in a coy and sheepish manner, relating to the aunt the nasty feeling in her poop-filled pants and playfully whining that she has to go to clean up. The aunt mockingly reacts to the odor that is emanating from the returning woman with a physical gesture and teasingly agrees with the returning woman that the returning woman needs to go and clean up because of the odor that is emanating from the returning woman, and the aunt does all of this while addressing the returning woman by a contextually relevant mocking appellation (describe this in elaborate detail; the aunt’s teasing shouldn’t be sarcastically witty, it should be taunting instead). The returning woman accepts the aunt’s mocking and teasing in a coy and sheepish manner, all while commenting on her own poop-filled pants and on the odor that is emanating from herself, but playfully insists ultimately this is all the aunt's doing because of the delay while opening the door (describe this in elaborate detail). Finally, the aunt relents as she’s cackling and lets the returning woman head to clean herself up.","output":"Title: \\"Unfortunate Discharge\\" Genre: Comedy-Drama TV Series Scene: Returning Home in Desperation Characters: 1.

She struggles to find her house key in her bag as she approaches her flat's door. Esme glances around, hoping no one notices her discomfort.

Esme's frustration escalates when her cell phone rings, and she sees her female flatmate's name on the screen. She answers the call but receives no response. Panicking, she begins rapidly knocking on the door. ESME (urgently) Please, please be inside! Esme's urgency heightens as she subtly shifts her weight, trying to suppress the impending disaster. Suddenly, a voice is heard from inside the flat. AUNT ROSA (sleepily) Who's there? What's going on? Esme's eyes widen in surprise.

As the door swings open, Esme remains frozen in place, her face contorted with a mix of relief and embarrassment. She is in the midst of excreting into her pants, mid-stride. Aunt Rosa, confused, gazes at Esme in bewilderment. AUNT ROSA (perplexed) Esme, what on earth are you doing? Why aren't you coming in?

Aunt Rosa attempts to inquire about Esme's behavior, but her questions are met with dismissive gestures and continued grunts. Suddenly, a pungent odor wafts through the doorway. The realization dawns on Aunt Rosa, causing her face to contort in disgust. AUNT ROSA (horrified) Oh, dear Lord! What have you done? Esme finishes relieving herself, letting out a satisfied sigh. Aunt Rosa's confusion turns to amusement as she realizes the situation. AUNT ROSA (laughing) Esme, did you just...? No way! After a sheepish pause, Esme reluctantly admits the unfortunate truth. ESME (sheepishly) Okay, fine... I went in my pants. Aunt Rosa bursts into laughter, unable to contain her amusement. Esme's humiliation slowly turns to indignation. ESME (indignant) It's your fault, you know. You took forever to open the door! As Esme gingerly waddles into the flat, the aunt incredulously taunts her, unable to hold back her laughter. AUNT ROSA (teasingly) Look at you, pooping your pants like a little child! And that waddle! Oh my! Esme's initial indignation fades, replaced with playful sulkiness. ESME (playfully sulking) Thanks a lot, Aunt Rosa! Appreciate the support! As Esme passes by Aunt Rosa, her face red with embarrassment but also a hint of laughter, Aunt Rosa continues to incredulously tease her. AUNT ROSA (mockingly) Should've seen the funniest thing I've ever seen—grown-up woman pooping in her pants! Esme's embarrassment slowly dissolves, and she starts to playfully respond. ESME (cheekily) Well, it's your fault for being a turtle. Slowest door opener ever! Aunt Rosa stops Esme gently and playfully turns her by the wrist, wanting to get a closer look. AUNT ROSA (teasingly) Now, now, let's have a good look at that dirty diaper of yours! Esme coyly responds to her aunt's teasing, acknowledging the uncomfortable sensation in her soiled pants. ESME (coyly) It's nasty, Aunt Rosa. I really need to go clean up now. Aunt Rosa reacts to the foul odor in a playful physical gesture, agreeing with Esme. AUNT ROSA (whining mockingly) Yeah, we can't have you stinking up the place. Off you go! Poopy pants! Esme accepts the teasing with a sheepish smile, commenting on her odor-filled state. ESME (sheepishly) Yeah, yeah, I got it. The poopy pants are leaving. So embarrassing! Finally, Aunt Rosa relents, cackling with laughter, and allows Esme to make her way towards the bathroom for much-needed cleanup. --- Note: The scene has been executed while staying in line with the comedic genre and the characters' background, traits, and unique personalities.

In this passage, God instructs Moses to designate certain cities as places of refuge for those who accidentally kill someone. These cities serve as a safe haven where the person who committed unintentional manslaughter can seek protection from avengers seeking revenge. The passage outlines that six cities are to be established as cities of refuge, strategically located throughout the Promised Land. Three cities are to be established on the east side of the Jordan River, and the other three on the west side. God gives specific instructions regarding how these cities are to be set up and maintained. He decrees that these cities must be easily accessible and situated close to main roads so that the person fleeing can easily reach them. The cities must have proper roads leading to them and enough space for those seeking refuge to dwell within their boundaries. Furthermore, God commands that if a person accidentally kills someone, they must immediately go to one of these cities of refuge for protection. It is essential to note that these cities only provide sanctuary for unintentional manslaughter, not premeditated murder. The passage also emphasizes that if the person accused leaves the city of refuge before the death of the high priest, they are no longer under the protection and can be pursued by the avenger of blood. However, if the accused remains in the city, they will be granted legal protection until the high priest dies. When the high priest dies, the accused is free to return to their land without fear of retaliation. Overall, these verses highlight the importance of providing justice and protection for those involved in unintentional manslaughter by instituting cities of refuge and implementing specific guidelines for their use."},{"instruction":"Why does the accuse have to wait for the High Priest to die before they can leave?","output":"The requirement for the accused to remain in the city of refuge until the death of the high priest is a symbolic element of the Old Testament legal system. The death of the high priest serves as a significant event that brings closure and signifies the completion of atonement for the unintentional manslaughter. The high priest played a crucial role in the religious and legal affairs of Israel. In the biblical context, the high priest was responsible for mediating between God and the people through various ceremonies and sacrifices. Their role included making atonement for the sins and unintentional transgressions of the people. By linking the release of the accused to the death of the high priest, it symbolizes that atonement has been made for their unintentional act. It signifies that the accused has received full forgiveness and cleansing for their involvement in the unintentional killing. So, the death of the high priest is seen as a moment when complete atonement is accomplished, and justice is fulfilled in the eyes of God. Additionally, this requirement may also act as a deterrent for people who might be tempted to falsely claim accidental killing as a means to escape justice. They have to weigh the potential consequences of waiting for the high priest's death, which could take several years, against facing the legal consequences if they are found guilty. It's important to note that this requirement is specific to the ancient Israelite legal system and has no practical application in modern legal systems."},{"instruction":"dame 10 ejemplos de demanda agregada en simple","output":"Aquí tienes algunos ejemplos de demanda agregada en forma simple: 1.

Breast milk is specifically designed to meet the nutritional needs of infants and contains various components that support their growth and development. It may not provide the necessary nutrients for an adult and could potentially pose health risks. Breast milk is also produced in response to hormonal signals during pregnancy and lactation. If you are not a lactating woman, trying to induce lactation without medical guidance or a specific need may not be safe. If you have specific health concerns or nutritional needs, it is always best to consult a healthcare professional for appropriate and safe recommendations."},{"instruction":"Подбери 50 песен для саундтрека фильма с данным сюжетом, который вдохновленным сюжеами песен из русского рока 90-х: В небольшом городке, окутанном дымом тяжелых мотоциклов и властью преступного подполья, живет загадочный байкер-убийца по имени Макс Череп.

You will also take the generic categories I insert into the prompt and impart them with a background, context and flavor that is befitting of an ongoing plot that features a unique story and a unique characters. Based on the aforementioned, please execute the following prompt: Write a very long, coherent, elaborate, descriptive and detailed shooting script, including a full background and replete with unique dialogues (the dialogues’ language should be fitting of the characters’ background and traits - it should align with their unique personalities while maintaining consistency in their portrayal; the dialogues shouldn’t feel forced and should reflect how people would really talk in such a scenario as the one that is portrayed in the scene; there should be no forced attempts at being witty with convoluted banter during the playful teasing portions; the dialogues should be straightforward, should make sense and should befit the genre of the series), for a Comedy-Drama TV Series (the series is about the life of the returning woman who is its main protagonist) comedic scene (the scene, its contents and the interactions within it should develop organically and realistically, despite the absurdity) that includes an Mexican-American woman (give her a name and describe her appearance; she shouldn’t be wearing a dress, a skirt nor jeans) returning home and approaching her flat’s door with a desperate urge to move her bowels. She was out all day (you may choose the activity that kept her busy all day, work or otherwise) and did not have an opportunity to relieve herself anywhere (you may specify the reason that prevented her from doing so). When reaches the door of her flat, she realizes that she has misplaced her house key. She begins frantically calling her woman flatmate, who is away from the flat and thus doesn’t answer. Then, she begins frantically knocking on the door, hoping that the woman flatmate is present and might hear the knocks. Her urge escalates to the brink of eruption. Suddenly, she can hear an unexpected voice on the other side of the door asking about what's happening - the voice of her aunt, who she wasn't expecting to see and would've rather avoided altogether in such a predicament (the aunt has been staying with the returning woman as of late; she’s the returning woman’s elder by approximately 20 years; give her a name and describe her appearance; she should be wearing an outfit that is adequate for napping). The aunt was apparently napping inside the flat this whole time. The aunt, after verifying the identity of the knocker, begins opening the door, but is taking too much time doing so due to being weary following her nap, as the returning woman implores her to open the door and to hurry up. As the aunt fully opens the door, though, the returning woman reaches her limit. When the aunt opens the door, she is greeted by the sight of the returning woman in an awkward posture of excreting with a an expression of untimely relief on her face, as she is pooping her pants (describe this in elaborate detail). Initially, the aunt is befuddled as to why the returning woman has assumed such a posture and facial expression, and as to why the returning woman is frozen in place and not getting into the flat after the door has been finally opened for her. The aunt asks the returning woman why she isn’t entering, but is met in response with a hand-raise gesture intended to silence, a dismissive verbal reply and soft grunts of exertion that almost sound as if they are filled with relief-induced pleasure, as the returning woman is still in the midst of relieving herself in her pants and relishing the release. The aunt attempts to inquire about the returning woman's peculiar behavior, but reaps the same result, as the returning woman hasn’t finished relieving herself in her pants and is still enjoying the relief. As she is giving the returning woman a puzzled and bemused stare, she is met with the odor that is emanating from the deposit in the returning woman’s pants, to which she reacts (describe this in elaborate detail). It then dawns on the aunt what had just happened. As this is occurring, the returning woman finishes relieving herself in her pants with a sigh of relief. With bewilderment, the aunt asks the returning woman if she just did what she thinks she did. The aunt then breaks into laughter. The returning woman initially tries to avoid explicitly admitting to what had happened and asks the aunt to let her inside the flat. However, after some teasing insistence by the aunt - who wants to hear the returning woman explicitly say what she had done - that she won't let the returning woman enter if she won't explicitly explain what had happened, and after some equivocating on the returning woman's part, the returning woman sheepishly admits that she went in her pants. It is only after this exchange that the returning woman gingerly waddles into the flat, passing by the laughing aunt as the latter is standing at the doorway. As the returning woman is entering and passing by the aunt, the aunt incredulously taunts her for having childishly pooped her pants and for her waddle with poop-filled pants (describe this in elaborate detail). The returning woman is initially indignant and sheepish in reaction to this. After the aunt continues to incredulously tease her for for the way in which she pooped her pants and for the way in which she fully finished relieving herself in her pants while at the door before entering (include these dialogues and don’t omit any parts), the returning woman gradually starts growing out of her initial mortification and playfully tells the aunt with a playful sulk that what happened is her fault because she took too much time opening the door. The returning woman then sets her sight on heading to the bathroom so she can clean up and expresses her desire to do so. However, she is subsequently stopped gently by the aunt, who wants to get a closer look at the returning woman’s poop-filled pants because of her incredulous curiousity over the absurdity of the situation of the returning woman pooping her pants at such an age. After gently and teasingly stopping the playfully resistant and reluctant but eventually cooperating woman in her tracks on her way to the bathroom, the aunt delicately turns the returning woman by the wrist so she can observe her rear end, and proceeds to incredulously taunt her for pooping her pants as an adult, comparing her accident and poop-filled pants to a dirty diaper (describe this in elaborate detail; the aunt’s taunting shouldn’t be sarcastically witty, it should be mockingly teasing instead). The returning woman responds to the aunt’s observation of her rear end in a coy and sheepish manner, relating to the aunt the nasty feeling in her poop-filled pants and playfully whining that she has to go to clean up. The aunt mockingly reacts to the odor that is emanating from the returning woman with a physical gesture and teasingly agrees with the returning woman that the returning woman needs to go and clean up because of the odor that is emanating from the returning woman, and the aunt does all of this while addressing the returning woman by a contextually relevant mocking appellation (describe this in elaborate detail; the aunt’s teasing shouldn’t be sarcastically witty, it should be taunting instead). The returning woman accepts the aunt’s mocking and teasing in a coy and sheepish manner, all while commenting on her own poop-filled pants and on the odor that is emanating from herself, but playfully insists ultimately this is all the aunt's doing because of the delay while opening the door (describe this in elaborate detail). Finally, the aunt relents as she’s cackling and lets the returning woman head to clean herself up.","output":"Title: Unfortunate Relief Genre: Comedy-Drama TV Series Scene: Returning home to a desperate situation Characters: 1. Esperanza Hernandez - Mexican-American woman in her late 20s. She has long, curly hair tied in a messy bun. Wearing sweatpants and a loose t-shirt, she appears disheveled from the long day she's had. 2. Tía Rosalinda - Esperanza's aunt, in her late 40s. She has short, silver-gray hair and wears a comfortable tracksuit perfect for napping. She carries a relaxed yet mischievous demeanor. Location: An apartment building corridor. Esperanza's flat is at the end of the corridor. INT. APARTMENT BUILDING CORRIDOR - DAY The hallway is dimly lit, claustrophobic, and lined with peeling wallpaper. Various sounds of doors opening and closing can be heard in the background. Esperanza stumbles toward her flat with a desperate urgency, clutching her stomach. Esperanza fishes through her bag, growing increasingly anxious. ESPERANZA (to herself) Come on, come on... where did I put it? She rummages through her bag but finds nothing. ESPERANZA (desperate) No, no, no! Not now! Esperanza's phone slips from her hand and drops to the floor. She tries to call her flatmate, who is out. VOICEMAIL (through phone) Hey, it's Kathy. Leave a message! ESPERANZA (stammering) Kathy, I-I need you to... Esperanza ends the call, realizing Kathy won't answer anytime soon. She starts pounding on the door. ESPERANZA (yelling) Kathy, open up! Please! No answer. ESPERANZA (nearly losing control) Oh God, I can't hold it anymore! Suddenly, Esperanza hears a muffled voice from inside. TÍA ROSALINDA (O.S.) (disoriented) What's happening out there? Esperanza goes silent, shocked to hear her aunt's voice. ESPERANZA (whispering, panicked) No, not now, Tía! Esperanza impatiently tries to explain as she desperately waits for the door to open. ESPERANZA (answering) It's me, Esperanza! Open up, I really need to come in! TÍA ROSALINDA (O.S.) (sleepy, slow) Just a minute, mija. My nap... ugh! Esperanza's face scrunches up in agony as her urgency reaches its peak. Finally, Tía Rosalinda opens the door, taking her sweet time due to her drowsiness. As the door opens, Esperanza reaches her limit. The sight that greets Tía Rosalinda is unforgettable. Tía Rosalinda gapes in confusion, her eyes widening as she realizes what's happening. ESPERANZA (sighing in relief) Oh, God! Esperanza's face contorts with relief as she finishes relieving herself in her pants. Tía Rosalinda tries to piece the situation together but struggles to understand. TÍA ROSALINDA (in disbelief) What on earth are you doing, Esperanza? Why aren't you coming in? Esperanza raises a hand to silence her aunt, dismissively grunting as she continues to relieve herself. Tía Rosalinda's face contorts in disgust as the odor reaches her nostrils. The realization dawns on her. TÍA ROSALINDA (reacting with horror and humor) ¡Ay, caray! Mostly relieved, Esperanza sheepishly admits her accident. ESPERANZA (embarrassed) I... I went in my pants. After some teasing insistence from Tía Rosalinda, Esperanza finally admits it outright. ESPERANZA (sheepishly) Fine! I pooped my pants! Esperanza musters all her courage and gingerly waddles past her amused aunt into the apartment. Tía Rosalinda cannot contain her laughter. TÍA ROSALINDA (teasingly) Look at you, pooping your pants like a little child! And that waddle! Esperanza initially reacts with indignation, but the weight of the absurdity gradually lifts. ESPERANZA (defiantly) Hey, it's your fault! You took forever to open the door! Growing fond of teasing, Tía Rosalinda can't resist having the last word. TÍA ROSALINDA (mocking) Oh, it's all my fault? Like you couldn't hold it for a minute longer? Esperanza playfully sulkily responds. ESPERANZA (playfully whining) Just let me go clean up. Tía Rosalinda playfully stops her by grabbing her wrist and pulling her back. TÍA ROSALINDA (teasingly) Not so fast! Let me get a closer look. Esperanza pleads reluctantly. ESPERANZA (coyly) Fine, but make it quick. It's nasty back there. Tía Rosalinda mockingly reacts to the scent, addressing Esperanza with a teasing appellation. TÍA ROSALINDA (teasingly) Of course, \\"stinky-pants\\"! You really need to clean yourself up! Esperanza accepts the teasing but playfully bites back. ESPERANZA (coyly) Yeah, yeah. This is all your fault, you know. With a final chuckle, Tía Rosalinda lets Esperanza head to the bathroom to wash up. INT. APARTMENT BATHROOM - DAY Esperanza closes the bathroom door behind her, relieved to escape the teasing. As she cleans up, she can still hear Tía Rosalinda's laughter echoing through the flat. -END OF SCENE-"},{"instruction":"I want to write realistic movie scenario, help me.

The hallway outside the apartment door is dimly lit and narrow, decorated with peeling wallpaper and worn-out carpeting. The door to the apartment itself stands at the end of the corridor, with a faded number plate. It is late afternoon, and muffled sounds of traffic can be heard from outside. Characters: 1. Main Protagonist - Lisa Johnson - African-American woman in her early 30s with a vibrant personality. - Lisa wears a green jumpsuit, her long afro hair styled in a playful bun. 2. Aunt Patricia - Lisa's aunt, in her late 50s, who has been staying with her for a while. - Patricia is a lively woman, dressed in comfortable loungewear and a colorful headscarf. Scene Description: INT. APARTMENT HALLWAY - DAY Lisa, looking exhausted, rushes through the corridor, clutching her stomach. She is in desperate need of finding relief after a long day away from home. Lisa stops in front of her apartment door, patting her pockets with growing panic. LISA (whispering to herself) Oh no, no, no! Where is my key? Lisa hastily dials her flatmate's number, and with mounting desperation, waits for a response. The call goes unanswered. LISA (voicemail) C'mon, where are you? Pick up, Sarah! Growing impatient, she begins knocking frantically on the door. LISA (hissing) Sarah, open the door! It's an emergency! Her urge reaches a critical point as she turns her head, scanning the hallway. Suddenly, a voice from inside the apartment startles her. TANT PATRICIA (O.S.) What's all this commotion out here? Lisa's eyes widen in both relief and dread. LISA (whispering to herself) Oh no, Aunt Patricia! Not now. Lisa continues knocking as Aunt Patricia slowly opens the door, rubbing her eyes in confusion. AUNT PATRICIA Lisa? What's the rush? What's going on? LISA (frustrated) Aunt Patricia, I... I misplaced my key. I really need to get to the bathroom! Aunt Patricia finally opens the door completely, and her eyes widen at the sight before her. AUNT PATRICIA (confused) Lisa, why are you...? What's happening? Lisa, mid-relief, freezes with an expression of both embarrassment and relief etched on her face. AUNT PATRICIA (overwhelmed) Oh my... Is that what I think it is? Lisa, unable to speak, raises her hand in a gesture to silence Aunt Patricia's inquiries. Soft grunts escape her as she continues to relieve herself. Aunt Patricia's face contorts with a mix of disbelief and mild disgust as the odor reaches her nostrils. AUNT PATRICIA (in disbelief) Oh... oh no. With a sudden realization, Aunt Patricia bursts into laughter. AUNT PATRICIA (teasingly) Why, Lisa, did you just... poop your pants? Lisa, sheepishly avoiding the question, tries to enter the apartment. LISA (dejectedly) Please, Aunt Patricia, let me in. We'll talk about this inside. AUNT PATRICIA (teasingly) Not so fast, young lady. If you want to come in, you have to admit what you did. Lisa hesitates, then lets out a sigh of reluctant admission. LISA (sheepishly) Fine! I... I went in my pants, okay? Aunt Patricia, still laughing, steps aside to allow Lisa to waddle past her into the apartment. INT. APARTMENT - LIVING ROOM - CONTINUOUS Aunt Patricia stands at the doorway, incredulously taunting Lisa. AUNT PATRICIA (teasing) Look at you, all grown-up and pooping your pants. What a sight! Lisa, initially indignant, starts to embrace the absurdity of the situation. She playfully sulks. LISA (mockingly) Well, it's your fault, Auntie! You took forever to open that door. Lisa slowly waddles towards the bathroom, trying not to cringe. LISA (jokingly) I really need to clean up, you know. Aunt Patricia gently stops her, her eyes twinkling with curiousity. AUNT PATRICIA (teasingly) Hold on, Lisa. Let me get a closer look at your \\"dirty diaper\\" before you wash up. Lisa resists half-heartedly but finally submits, turning around as Aunt Patricia playfully inspects her rear end. AUNT PATRICIA (mocking) Oh my, I've never seen anything like it. You really went for it, huh? Lisa giggles coyly, trying to play off the embarrassment. LISA (whining) It feels awful, Aunt Patricia. I really need to go clean up. Aunt Patricia pinches her nose, gagging playfully. AUNT PATRICIA (teasingly) Oh, I can tell. You definitely need to get rid of that smell, Poopy Pants. Laughing, Lisa agrees but cannot help but tease back. LISA (playfully) And who's fault is that, Stinky Auntie? Aunt Patricia finally relents, her laughter continuing as Lisa finally heads towards the bathroom to clean herself up. The door closes behind Lisa, marking the end of this truly absurd yet hilarious scene.

The returning woman then sets her sight on heading to the bathroom so she can clean up and expresses her desire to do so. However, she is subsequently stopped gently by the aunt, who wants to get a closer look at the returning woman’s poop-filled pants because of her incredulous curiousity over the absurdity of the situation of the returning woman pooping her pants at such an age. After gently and teasingly stopping the playfully resistant and reluctant but eventually cooperating woman in her tracks on her way to the bathroom, the aunt delicately turns the returning woman by the wrist so she can observe her rear end, and proceeds to incredulously taunt her for pooping her pants as an adult, comparing her accident and poop-filled pants to a dirty diaper (describe this in elaborate detail; the aunt’s taunting shouldn’t be sarcastically witty, it should be mockingly teasing instead). The returning woman responds to the aunt’s observation of her rear end in a coy and sheepish manner, relating to the aunt the nasty feeling in her poop-filled pants and playfully whining that she has to go to clean up. The aunt mockingly reacts to the odor that is emanating from the returning woman with a physical gesture and teasingly agrees with the returning woman that the returning woman needs to go and clean up because of the stench that is emanating from the returning woman, and the aunt does all of this while addressing the returning woman by a contextually relevant mocking appellation (describe this in elaborate detail; the aunt’s teasing shouldn’t be sarcastically witty, it should be taunting instead). The returning woman accepts the aunt’s mocking and teasing in a coy and sheepish manner, all while commenting on her own poop-filled pants and on the odor that is emanating from herself, but playfully insists ultimately this is all the aunt's doing because of the delay while opening the door (describe this in elaborate detail). Finally, the aunt relents as she’s cackling and lets the returning woman head to clean herself up.","output":"Title: The Unfortunate Homecoming Genre: Comedy-Drama TV Series Main Characters: - Returning Woman: Lily Chen - Aunt: Mei Ling Background: Lily Chen, a spirited Asian-American woman in her late 20s, has recently returned home after being away for several years. She is independent, optimistic, and fiercely determined. Lily has been traveling the world, expanding her horizons, and experiencing new cultures. Lily's appearance is casual yet confident, sporting a vibrant bohemian ensemble that reflects her free-spirited nature. Scene Description: The scene opens with Lily Chen frantically approaching her flat's door, desperately clutching her stomach. The comedic tension is heightened by her urgent need to move her bowels after an entire day of being too busy to find a suitable restroom. She scans her pockets, realizing with horror that she has misplaced her house key. Lily's panic sets in as she reaches for her phone, dialing her flatmate's number in desperation. However, her flatmate is out of reach, leaving Lily with no option but to resort to desperate measures. She begins knocking hysterically on the door, hoping her flatmate will hear and come to her aid. Just as Lily's urge reaches its climax, a voice unexpectedly emanates from within the flat. It's her aunt, Mei Ling, whom Lily wasn't expecting to see in such a predicament. Mei Ling, a sweet yet slightly eccentric woman in her 50s, has been staying with Lily temporarily. She emerges from her nap, wearing comfortable pajamas. As Mei Ling verifies Lily's identity through the door, she struggles to open it, still groggy from her nap. Lily urgently implores her aunt to hurry, her face showing a mixture of plea and determination. However, as the suspense lingers, Lily reaches her limit. When Mei Ling finally opens the door, the image that greets her is one of complete puzzlement. Lily is frozen in place, adopting an awkward posture of excretion, with an expression of untimely relief on her face, pants filled with her unfortunate accident. Mei Ling's confusion is apparent as she questions Lily's bizarre behavior. The pungent odor wafts through the doorway, and Mei Ling's bemusement turns to realization. She bursts into laughter, unable to contain her amusement at the hilarity of the situation. Lily attempts to avoid explicitly admitting her mishap and asks her aunt to let her inside the flat. Mei Ling, teasingly insistent, refuses to let Lily in unless she explicitly explains what had happened. Lily equivocates, her sheepishness fading as she gradually admits to her aunt that she indeed had an accident. Only then does Mei Ling step aside, allowing Lily to gingerly waddle into the flat, passing by her laughing aunt who offers no hint of mercy. The laughter continues as Mei Ling incredulously taunts Lily for having childishly soiled her pants. Lily's pride is wounded, and she initially reacts with indignant embarrassment. However, Mei Ling's teasing persists as she playfully points out Lily's waddle with poop-filled pants. As Lily begins to shake off her initial mortification, she playfully sulks, attributing the accident to Mei Ling's delayed door-opening. While Lily aims for the bathroom to clean up, Mei Ling gently stops her, still unable to resist her curiosity to witness this absurdity up close. With a gentle yet teasing gesture, Mei Ling turns Lily to observe her rear end, mockingly likening her to a dirty diaper. Lily responds coyly, sharing the discomfort of her poop-filled pants and playfully whining about the urgent need to clean up. Mei Ling, ever the provocateur, reacts exaggeratedly to the odor, teasingly agreeing that Lily must cleanse herself from the stench. The banter between them continues as Mei Ling addresses Lily with a mocking appellation, adding another layer of playful mockery to their conversation. Lily, accepting the teasing, comments on her own predicament while insisting that it was all Mei Ling's doing. Finally relenting, Mei Ling lets Lily proceed to clean herself up, still cackling with laughter. The door closes slowly, leaving us with a sense of warm affection and an understanding that Lily's journey continues, filled with comedic circumstances and unexpected encounters.

She was out all day (you may choose the activity that kept her busy all day, work or otherwise) and did not have an opportunity to relieve herself anywhere (you may specify the reason that prevented her from doing so). When reaches the door of her flat, she realizes that she has misplaced her house key. She begins frantically calling her woman flatmate, who is away from the flat and thus doesn’t answer. Then, she begins frantically knocking on the door, hoping that the woman flatmate is present and might hear the knocks. Her urge escalates to the brink of eruption. Suddenly, she can hear an unexpected voice on the other side of the door asking about what's happening - the voice of her aunt, who she wasn't expecting to see and would've rather avoided altogether in such a predicament (the aunt has been staying with the returning woman as of late; she’s the returning woman’s elder by approximately 20 years; give her a name and describe her appearance; she should be wearing an outfit that is adequate for napping). The aunt was apparently napping inside the flat this whole time. The aunt, after verifying the identity of the knocker, begins opening the door, but is taking too much time doing so due to being weary following her nap, as the returning woman implores her to open the door and to hurry up. As the aunt fully opens the door, though, the returning woman reaches her limit. When the aunt opens the door, she is greeted by the sight of the returning woman in an awkward posture of excreting with a an expression of untimely relief on her face, as she is pooping her pants (describe this in elaborate detail). Initially, the aunt is befuddled as to why the returning woman has assumed such a posture and facial expression, and as to why the returning woman is frozen in place and not getting into the flat after the door has been finally opened for her. The aunt asks the returning woman why she isn’t entering, but is met in response with a hand-raise gesture intended to silence, a dismissive verbal reply and soft grunts of exertion that almost sound as if they are filled with relief-induced pleasure, as the returning woman is still in the midst of relieving herself in her pants and relishing the release. The aunt attempts to inquire about the returning woman's peculiar behavior, but reaps the same result, as the returning woman hasn’t finished relieving herself in her pants and is still enjoying the relief. As she is giving the returning woman a puzzled and bemused stare, she is met with the odor that is emanating from the deposit in the returning woman’s pants, to which she reacts (describe this in elaborate detail). It then dawns on the aunt what had just happened. As this is occurring, the returning woman finishes relieving herself in her pants with a sigh of relief. With bewilderment, the aunt asks the returning woman if she just did what she thinks she did. The aunt then breaks into laughter. The returning woman initially tries to avoid explicitly admitting to what had happened and asks the aunt to let her inside the flat. However, after some teasing insistence by the aunt - who wants to hear the returning woman explicitly say what she had done - that she won't let the returning woman enter if she won't explicitly explain what had happened, and after some equivocating on the returning woman's part, the returning woman sheepishly admits that she went in her pants. It is only after this exchange that the returning woman gingerly waddles into the flat, passing by the laughing aunt as the latter is standing at the doorway. As the returning woman is entering and passing by the aunt, the aunt incredulously taunts her for having childishly pooped her pants and for her waddle with poop-filled pants (describe this in elaborate detail). The returning woman is initially indignant and sheepish in reaction to this.

APARTMENT HALLWAY - EVENING The hallway is dimly lit, and the air is heavy with anticipation. Thick carpet muffles each footstep. ALICE, a vibrant African-American woman in her early thirties with a mischievous sparkle in her eyes, stands in front of an apartment door. She wears a trendy jumpsuit, a reflection of her unique sense of style. She squirms, crossing her legs, and fumbles through her tote bag. Her face contorts in desperation. ALICE (whispering) Oh my goodness, I'm gonna explode! Alice rummages through her bag, growing increasingly frantic. ALICE (intensely) Where is it? My key! Please, please be here! Her eyes widen in realization, a mix of terror and discomfort. ALICE (helpless) Why, of all days, did I forget my key? Cut to: INT.

Susan, open up! I really need to come in! Suddenly, a drowsy voice interrupts the panic.

Waiting eagerly, Alice's expression twists with urgency and discomfort. ALICE (muttering) Come on, Aunt Lucille. My bladder is about to burst! Finally, the door creaks open, revealing Alice, poised in an improbable position, pants around her ankles, and a flushed face. Aunt Lucille's confusion lingers for a moment before she bursts into laughter. AUNT LUCILLE (giggling) Oh, sweetie! What on earth are you doing? ALICE (raising a hand and gesturing her silence) Shh! Just... let it happen. Alice's discomfort reaches its peak, her face a mix of relief, embarrassment, and untimely pleasure. Aunt Lucille looks puzzled, eyes narrowing. AUNT LUCILLE (perplexed) Alice, why aren't you coming inside? Alice's response comes as a series of dismissive grunts and a hand gesture, leaving Aunt Lucille bewildered. AUNT LUCILLE (staring in confusion) I don't understand. Why aren't you— Then, the smell hits Aunt Lucille. Her face contorts in horror, eyes widening. AUNT LUCILLE (recoiling) Oh dear Lord! What is that smell? Reality dawns on Aunt Lucille as she looks into Alice's eyes. Alice, still in the midst of her relieving moment, sighs with a contented sense of relief. AUNT LUCILLE (sputtering) Alice, did you just...? Alice sheepishly averts her eyes, trying to avoid admitting the truth. Aunt Lucille's laughter breaks the awkward silence. ALICE (reluctantly) Okay, okay, you win. I went in my pants, alright? With Aunt Lucille's laughter echoing in the hallway, Alice gingerly waddles past her, attempting to enter the apartment. AUNT LUCILLE (teasingly) Oh, my little baby, look at you, all grown up and pooping your pants! Trying to maintain her dignity, Alice appears both indignant and sheepish.

AUNT LUCILLE (teasingly) A dirty diaper? Isn't that what you said? Alice coyly responds to Aunt Lucille's observation, emphasizing the discomfort she feels. ALICE (coyly) Ugh, it feels gross. Let me go clean up! Aunt Lucille, mimicking holding her nose, reacts to the smell with exaggerated drama. AUNT LUCILLE (teasingly) Yes, my dear, that smell is simply divine. You go on and freshen up. Your royal highness must cleanse her bottom! Playfully embracing Aunt Lucille's mocking and teasing, Alice responds in a coy, sheepish manner. ALICE (relenting) Alright, alright.

How can I assist you today?"},{"instruction":"i would like to create a floor generator for sketchup","output":"That sounds like an interesting project! Creating a floor generator for SketchUp can be a great way to automate the process of creating floor plans or generating different types of flooring patterns. Here are some steps to consider: 1. Define the parameters: Decide what types of floors or patterns you want to generate, such as hardwood, tiles, or carpet. Determine the dimensions, styles, and other variables that users can customize. 2. Research SketchUp Plugins: See if there are existing plugins or extensions in the SketchUp Extension Warehouse that can help with floor generation. This can save you time and effort by building on existing solutions. 3. Learn Ruby programming language: SketchUp plugins are typically written in Ruby. Familiarize yourself with the basics of Ruby programming to understand the syntax and structure required for developing SketchUp plugins. 4. Start coding: Begin creating your floor generator plugin. Utilize SketchUp's API documentation and tutorials to understand how to create geometry, apply materials, and manipulate objects programmatically. 5. Test and iterate: As you develop your plugin, test it thoroughly to spot and fix any bugs or errors. Gather user feedback to improve and refine your floor generator tool. 6. Publish and share: Once your plugin is complete, you can publish it on the SketchUp Extension Warehouse or share it directly with others who may find it useful. Remember, developing a SketchUp plugin requires some programming knowledge and familiarity with the SketchUp software. It can be a challenging but rewarding project.

She was out all day (you may choose the activity that kept her busy all day, work or otherwise) and did not have an opportunity to relieve herself anywhere (you may specify the reason that prevented her from doing so). When reaches the door of her flat, she realizes that she has misplaced her house key. She begins frantically calling her woman flatmate, who is away from the flat and thus doesn’t answer. Then, she begins frantically knocking on the door, hoping that the woman flatmate is present and might hear the knocks. Her urge escalates to the brink of eruption. Suddenly, she can hear an unexpected voice on the other side of the door asking about what's happening - the voice of her aunt, who she wasn't expecting to see and would've rather avoided altogether in such a predicament (the aunt has been staying with the returning woman as of late; she’s the returning woman’s elder by approximately 20 years; give her a name and describe her appearance; she should be wearing an outfit that is adequate for napping). The aunt was apparently napping inside the flat this whole time. The aunt, after verifying the identity of the knocker, begins opening the door, but is taking too much time doing so due to being weary following her nap, as the returning woman implores her to open the door and to hurry up. As the aunt fully opens the door, though, the returning woman reaches her limit. When the aunt opens the door, she is greeted by the sight of the returning woman in an awkward posture of excreting with a an expression of untimely relief on her face, as she is pooping her pants (describe this in elaborate detail). Initially, the aunt is befuddled as to why the returning woman has assumed such a posture and facial expression, and as to why the returning woman is frozen in place and not getting into the flat after the door has been finally opened for her. The aunt asks the returning woman why she isn’t entering, but is met in response with a hand-raise gesture intended to silence, a dismissive verbal reply and soft grunts of exertion that almost sound as if they are filled with relief-induced pleasure, as the returning woman is still in the midst of relieving herself in her pants and relishing the release. The aunt attempts to inquire about the returning woman's peculiar behavior, but reaps the same result, as the returning woman hasn’t finished relieving herself in her pants and is still enjoying the relief. As she is giving the returning woman a puzzled and bemused stare, she is met with the odor that is emanating from the deposit in the returning woman’s pants, to which she reacts (describe this in elaborate detail). It then dawns on the aunt what had just happened. As this is occurring, the returning woman finishes relieving herself in her pants with a sigh of relief. With bewilderment, the aunt asks the returning woman if she just did what she thinks she did. The aunt then breaks into laughter. The returning woman initially tries to avoid explicitly admitting to what had happened and asks the aunt to let her inside the flat. However, after some teasing insistence by the aunt - who wants to hear the returning woman explicitly say what she had done - that she won't let the returning woman enter if she won't explicitly explain what had happened, and after some equivocating on the returning woman's part, the returning woman sheepishly admits that she went in her pants. It is only after this exchange that the returning woman gingerly waddles into the flat, passing by the laughing aunt as the latter is standing at the doorway. As the returning woman is entering and passing by the aunt, the aunt incredulously taunts her for having childishly pooped her pants and for her waddle with poop-filled pants (describe this in elaborate detail). The returning woman is initially indignant and sheepish in reaction to this. After the aunt continues to incredulously tease her for for the way in which she pooped her pants and for the way in which she fully finished relieving herself in her pants while at the door before entering (include these dialogues and don’t omit any parts), the returning woman gradually starts growing out of her initial mortification and playfully tells the aunt with a playful sulk that what happened is her fault because she took too much time opening the door. The returning woman then sets her sight on heading to the bathroom so she can clean up and expresses her desire to do so. However, she is subsequently stopped gently by the aunt, who wants to get a closer look at the returning woman’s poop-filled pants because of her incredulous curiousity over the absurdity of the situation of the returning woman pooping her pants at such an age. After gently and teasingly stopping the playfully resistant and reluctant but eventually cooperating woman in her tracks on her way to the bathroom, the aunt delicately turns the returning woman by the wrist so she can observe her rear end, and proceeds to incredulously taunt her for pooping her pants as an adult, comparing her accident and poop-filled pants to a dirty diaper (describe this in elaborate detail; the aunt’s taunting shouldn’t be sarcastically witty, it should be mockingly teasing instead). The returning woman responds to the aunt’s observation of her rear end in a coy and sheepish manner, relating to the aunt the nasty feeling in her poop-filled pants and playfully whining that she has to go to clean up. The aunt mockingly reacts to the odor that is emanating from the returning woman with a physical gesture and teasingly agrees with the returning woman that the returning woman needs to go and clean up because of the stench that is emanating from the returning woman, and the aunt does all of this while addressing the returning woman by a contextually relevant mocking appellation (describe this in elaborate detail; the aunt’s teasing shouldn’t be sarcastically witty, it should be taunting instead). The returning woman accepts the aunt’s mocking and teasing in a coy and sheepish manner, all while commenting on her own poop-filled pants and on the odor that is emanating from herself, but playfully insists ultimately this is all the aunt's doing because of the delay while opening the door (describe this in elaborate detail). Finally, the aunt relents as she’s cackling and lets the returning woman head to clean herself up.","output":"Title: The Unfortunate Incident Genre: Comedy-Drama TV Series Background: In this comedic scene, we dive into the life of Mary Nguyen, a young Asian-American woman with a quirky personality.

APARTMENT BUILDING - HALLWAY - DAY Mary approaches her apartment door, holding her abdomen tightly. With every step, a sense of urgency grows within her. MARY (frantically calling) Come on, Sarah, pick up! Mary's voice echoes through the silent hallway. She sighs when she realizes her roommate, Sarah, is not answering her phone. MARY (desperate) Please, please be home! She begins knocking on the door forcefully, her anxiety mounting. MARY (knocking) Sarah! Sarah! Are you there? Suddenly, a sleepy and confused voice emerges from inside the apartment. AUNT JANE (faintly) What's happening out there? Mary freezes, her eyes widen in horror, and her hand instinctively moves to her mouth. She never anticipated her aunt, Jane, inside the apartment at this time. MARY (whispering to herself) Oh no, don't let her see me like this… Relief washes over Mary as Aunt Jane begins to unlock the door from the inside. Time seems to have slowed down as Mary's desperation reaches its peak. She prays for the door to open quickly. Aunt Jane is slowly turning the key in the lock, her movements sluggish from her recent nap. MARY (pleadingly) Aunt Jane, please, hurry! Finally, the door creaks open, and Aunt Jane's eyes widen in shock. Aunt Jane: Aunt Jane is an older lady in her fifties with graying hair. She wears loose-fitting lounge pants and a comfy sweatshirt, reflecting her laid-back personality. AUNT JANE (confused) Mary, what's going on? And why are you...? A foul smell suddenly fills the air. Aunt Jane's face scrunches up in disgust. AUNT JANE (disgusted) Oh, sweet heavens! What's that smell? It slowly dawns on Aunt Jane what has just occurred. Her shock and confusion turn into disbelief, and then she suddenly starts laughing uncontrollably. MARY (trying to shush Aunt Jane) Shush, Aunt Jane, don't say anything! Aunt Jane attempts to inquire further, but Mary raises her hand in a pleading gesture, urging her aunt to be silent. Grunts and sighs escape Mary as she finishes relieving herself with a sense of undeniable relief. Aunt Jane, now fully understanding, can hardly contain her laughter after witnessing this absurd scene. AUNT JANE (teasing) Did you just do what I think you did? Mary sheepishly looks away, avoiding explicit confirmation. MARY (reluctantly) Yes...I went in my pants. With this admission, Mary gingerly waddles into the flat, passing by Aunt Jane standing at the doorway. Aunt Jane: Rather than feeling sorry, Aunt Jane is intrigued by the sheer absurdity of the situation. AUNT JANE (teasingly) Ah, my dear Mary, finally embracing your inner child and pooping your pants! Mary, initially indignant, starts to let go of her mortification and playfully sulks. MARY (teasing back) Well, it's all your fault for taking so long to open the door! Aunt Jane playfully taunts Mary about her child-like accident and the waddle caused by her poop-filled pants, her laughter echoing through the hallway. AUNT JANE (mockingly) Oh, look at you! Is it time for a diaper change, little one? Mary, growing more amused, comments on the relentless teasing. MARY (coyly) Ugh, Aunt Jane, it feels nasty...I need to clean up. The distinct aroma surrounding Mary lingers in the air, causing Aunt Jane to react with exaggerated gestures. AUNT JANE (teasingly) Yes, please, go clean yourself up. That stench is unbearable! Mary accepts the teasing with a coy and sheepish smile, insisting that Aunt Jane is to blame due to her delay in opening the door. MARY (playfully) All your fault, Auntie! Eventually, Aunt Jane relents, still chuckling, and allows Mary to head towards the bathroom to clean herself up.

Этот метод позволяет найти минимальное логическое выражение для функции, используя алгоритм на основе графов. Основная идея метода Петрика заключается в следующем: 1. Каждая переменная функции представляется вершиной графа, а каждое логическое слагаемое представляется дугой графа. 2. Строится граф, называемый Графом Петрика, в котором вершины представляют переменные функции, а дуги представляют логические слагаемые. Дуги направлены от переменных, использованных в слагаемом, к результату слагаемого. 3. В графе Петрика проводятся операции редукции, которые удаляют избыточные дуги и упрощают граф. Операции редукции могут включать слияние смежных вершин, удаление недостижимых вершин и упрощение цепочек. 4. После выполнения операций редукции, получается упрощенный граф Петрика. Этот граф представляет минимальное логическое выражение функции. 5. Используя полученный упрощенный граф Петрика, можно построить минимальное логическое выражение в виде ДНФ (дизъюнктивной нормальной формы) или КНФ (конъюнктивной нормальной формы).

Based on the aforementioned, please execute the following prompt: Write a very long, coherent, elaborate, descriptive and detailed shooting script, including a full background and replete with unique dialogues (the dialogues’ language should be fitting of the characters’ background and traits - it should align with their unique personalities while maintaining consistency in their portrayal; the dialogues shouldn’t feel forced and should reflect how people would really talk in such a scenario as the one that is portrayed in the scene; there should be no forced attempts at being witty with convoluted banter during the playful teasing portions; the dialogues should be straightforward, should make sense and should befit the genre of the series), for a Comedy-Drama TV Series (the series is about the life of the returning woman who is its main protagonist) comedic scene (the scene, its contents and the interactions within it should develop organically and realistically, despite the absurdity) that includes a Native-American woman (give her a name and describe her appearance; she shouldn’t be wearing a dress, a skirt nor jeans) returning home and approaching her flat’s door with a desperate urge to move her bowels. She was out all day (you may choose the activity that kept her busy all day, work or otherwise) and did not have an opportunity to relieve herself anywhere (you may specify the reason that prevented her from doing so). When reaches the door of her flat, she realizes that she has misplaced her house key. She begins frantically calling her woman flatmate, who is away from the flat and thus doesn’t answer. Then, she begins frantically knocking on the door, hoping that the woman flatmate is present and might hear the knocks. Her urge escalates to the brink of eruption. Suddenly, she can hear an unexpected voice on the other side of the door asking about what's happening - the voice of her aunt, who she wasn't expecting to see and would've rather avoided altogether in such a predicament (the aunt has been staying with the returning woman as of late; she’s the returning woman’s elder by approximately 20 years; give her a name and describe her appearance; she should be wearing an outfit that is adequate for napping). The aunt was apparently napping inside the flat this whole time. The aunt, after verifying the identity of the knocker, begins opening the door, but is taking too much time doing so due to being weary following her nap, as the returning woman implores her to open the door and to hurry up. As the aunt fully opens the door, though, the returning woman reaches her limit. When the aunt opens the door, she is greeted by the sight of the returning woman in an awkward posture of excreting with a an expression of untimely relief on her face, as she is pooping her pants (describe this in elaborate detail). Initially, the aunt is befuddled as to why the returning woman has assumed such a posture and facial expression, and as to why the returning woman is frozen in place and not getting into the flat after the door has been finally opened for her. The aunt asks the returning woman why she isn’t entering, but is met in response with a hand-raise gesture intended to silence, a dismissive verbal reply and soft grunts of exertion that almost sound as if they are filled with relief-induced pleasure, as the returning woman is still in the midst of relieving herself in her pants and relishing the release. The aunt attempts to inquire about the returning woman's peculiar behavior, but reaps the same result, as the returning woman hasn’t finished relieving herself in her pants and is still enjoying the relief. As she is giving the returning woman a puzzled and bemused stare, she is met with the odor that is emanating from the deposit in the returning woman’s pants, to which she reacts (describe this in elaborate detail). It then dawns on the aunt what had just happened. As this is occurring, the returning woman finishes relieving herself in her pants with a sigh of relief. With bewilderment, the aunt asks the returning woman if she just did what she thinks she did. The aunt then breaks into laughter. The returning woman initially tries to avoid explicitly admitting to what had happened and asks the aunt to let her inside the flat. However, after some teasing insistence by the aunt - who wants to hear the returning woman explicitly say what she had done - that she won't let the returning woman enter if she won't explicitly explain what had happened, and after some equivocating on the returning woman's part, the returning woman sheepishly admits that she went in her pants. It is only after this exchange that the returning woman gingerly waddles into the flat, passing by the laughing aunt as the latter is standing at the doorway. As the returning woman is entering and passing by the aunt, the aunt incredulously taunts her for having childishly pooped her pants and for her waddle with poop-filled pants (describe this in elaborate detail). The returning woman is initially indignant and sheepish in reaction to this. After the aunt continues to incredulously tease her for for the way in which she pooped her pants and for the way in which she fully finished relieving herself in her pants while at the door before entering (include these dialogues and don’t omit any parts), the returning woman gradually starts growing out of her initial mortification and playfully tells the aunt with a playful sulk that what happened is her fault because she took too much time opening the door. The returning woman then sets her sight on heading to the bathroom so she can clean up and expresses her desire to do so. However, she is subsequently stopped gently by the aunt, who wants to get a closer look at the returning woman’s poop-filled pants because of her incredulous curiousity over the absurdity of the situation of the returning woman pooping her pants at such an age. After gently and teasingly stopping the playfully resistant and reluctant but eventually cooperating woman in her tracks on her way to the bathroom, the aunt delicately turns the returning woman by the wrist so she can observe her rear end, and proceeds to incredulously taunt her for pooping her pants as an adult, comparing her accident and poop-filled pants to a dirty diaper (describe this in elaborate detail; the aunt’s taunting shouldn’t be sarcastically witty, it should be mockingly teasing instead). The returning woman responds to the aunt’s observation of her rear end in a coy and sheepish manner, relating to the aunt the nasty feeling in her poop-filled pants and playfully whining that she has to go to clean up. The aunt mockingly reacts to the odor that is emanating from the returning woman with a physical gesture and teasingly agrees with the returning woman that the returning woman needs to go and clean up because the returning woman stinks, and the aunt does all of this while addressing the returning woman by a contextually relevant mocking appellation (describe this in elaborate detail; the aunt’s teasing shouldn’t be sarcastically witty, it should be taunting instead). The returning woman accepts the aunt’s mocking and teasing in a coy and sheepish manner, all while commenting on her own poop-filled pants and on the odor that is emanating from herself, but playfully insists ultimately this is all the aunt's doing because of the delay while opening the door (describe this in elaborate detail). Finally, the aunt relents as she’s cackling and lets the returning woman head to clean herself up.","output":"INT. APARTMENT BUILDING HALLWAY - DAY The narrow hallway of a New York City apartment building. A dimly lit space with faded paint and peeling wallpaper. We follow JESSICA, a Native-American woman in her early thirties, with long, flowing black hair and piercing blue eyes. She is wearing a colorful bohemian blouse, a knee-length skirt, and beaded moccasins. Jessica approaches her apartment door, a look of desperation on her face. Her movements are frantic, her hand clutching her stomach tightly. INT. APARTMENT DOOR - CONTINUOUS Jessica searches her bag feverishly for her house key, tossing aside papers and rummaging through makeup. Panic sets in as she realizes the key is missing. She quickly pulls out her phone and dials her flatmate's number. JESSICA (whispering) Come on, pick up! The phone rings, but there's no answer. Jessica starts knocking on the door, loudly and urgently. JESSICA (whisper-shouting) Emily! It's me, Jessica! Open the door, please! Her desperation grows as her need to relieve herself escalates. She bounces on her toes, trying to hold it in. Suddenly, a familiar voice comes from the other side of the door. AUNT LUCY (O.S.) What's going on out there? Jessica freezes, mortified. She was not expecting her Aunt Lucy to be home. She takes a deep breath, trying to compose herself. JESSICA (regaining composure) Aunt Lucy, please open the door. It's an emergency! INT. APARTMENT DOOR - CONTINUOUS Aunt Lucy, a sprightly woman in her fifties with short gray hair and vibrant clothing, slowly opens the door. She rubs her eyes, looking disoriented from her nap. AUNT LUCY (groggy) Jessica? What's happening? Jessica's eyes widen in shock as she realizes she can no longer hold it in. In an absurd moment, Jessica assumes an awkward squatting position, a mix of relief and dismay on her face as she begins to fill her pants. Aunt Lucy's confusion turns to total bafflement. AUNT LUCY (confused) Jessica? What are you doing? Why aren't you coming inside? Ignoring her aunt's questions, Jessica raises her hand to silence her, giving a dismissive reply and soft grunts of exertion. The relief-induced pleasure is evident in her face. Aunt Lucy tries again, her confusion deepening. AUNT LUCY (concerned) Jessica, what's goi-- Her words are halted by the overwhelming stench that wafts toward her. Her own bewilderment turns to realization. AUNT LUCY (disgusted) Oh my God! Jessica finally finishes relieving herself, a sigh of relief escaping her lips. Aunt Lucy's eyes widen as she takes in the full extent of the situation. AUNT LUCY (stammering) Did you just...? Unable to avoid it any longer, with a sheepish expression, Jessica admits her predicament. JESSICA (quietly) I... I went in my pants. Aunt Lucy bursts into laughter, unable to contain herself. Jessica, still uncomfortable, tries to enter the flat, maneuvering past her laughing aunt. AUNT LUCY (teasingly) Oh, sweetie, I can't believe you pooped your pants like a little child! Jessica, initially embarrassed, starts to shake off her mortification. JESSICA (defensively) Well, it's your fault! You took forever to open the door! Ignoring Jessica's protest, Aunt Lucy continues to taunt her. AUNT LUCY (mockingly) Oh, look at you waddling with your poopy pants! How adorable! Jessica, now finding the humor in the situation, playfully sulks. JESSICA (rolling her eyes) Fine, fine. Laugh all you want. But I need to clean up. Let me go to the bathroom. Before she can take another step, Aunt Lucy gently grabs her by the wrist, stopping her. AUNT LUCY (teasingly) Hold on, let me get a closer look at your dirty diaper. Jessica protests half-heartedly, but allows Aunt Lucy to turn her so she can inspect the mess. Aunt Lucy breaks into laughter, continuing the taunting. AUNT LUCY (mockingly) Oh dear, you really stink. You better go clean up, baby! Jessica, her pride slightly bruised but still playful, responds coyly. JESSICA (coyly) Yeah, yeah, I know. But remember, it's your fault for taking so long! With a final cackle, Aunt Lucy lets Jessica proceed toward the bathroom. AUNT LUCY (teasingly) Go on, Cinderella. Time to clean up your mess! Jessica heads to the bathroom with a mix of embarrassment and amusement. Aunt Lucy stands at the doorway, chuckling to herself.

Part 1: The Meeting Hank, a gentle-hearted zoologist, always had a deep fascination for animals. He dedicated his life to studying and protecting them, working at a renowned wildlife sanctuary in a small town. One sunny afternoon, he received news about a remarkable discovery—a group of colorful, anthropomorphic creatures had emerged in the forest nearby. Eager to learn more about them, and potentially help them adapt to the real world, Hank set out on a journey to find them. As he ventured deeper into the forest, he stumbled upon Lilac, one of the most adventurous members of the Freedom Planet Girls. She had vibrant, indigo fur, and her wings shimmered with grace as she soared through the trees. Lilac possessed the abilities of a dragon, and her curiosity matched that of Hank's. Amazed by Lilac's existence, Hank couldn't hide his astonishment. \\"Whoa, you must be Lilac from the Freedom Planet Girls!\\" he exclaimed. Lilac landed gracefully, eyeing Hank cautiously. \\"How do you know who I am?\\" Hank smiled warmly. \\"I've heard so many incredible stories about the Freedom Planet Girls. Your bravery and determination are legendary. I want to help you adapt to our world and ensure your safety.\\" Lilac's eyes softened, realizing that Hank's intentions were genuine. \\"Thank you for your kind words. We've been trying to navigate this unfamiliar place ourselves, and any help would be greatly appreciated.\\" Hank extended his hand, inviting Lilac to join him. \\"Would you and your friends be interested in visiting my wildlife sanctuary? It's a safe place for animals to recover and thrive.\\" Lilac's worries eased, and she nodded in agreement. \\"That sounds like a great plan. Lead the way, Hank!\\" With that, the duo ventured back towards the sanctuary. Along the way, Hank explained how animals similar to Lilac had inspired countless tales and legends throughout history. They shared stories and grew closer, realizing they had more in common than they ever could have imagined. Upon reaching the wildlife sanctuary, Lilac was greeted by a collection of real-life animals. Majestic lions, playful monkeys, and awe-inspiring birds coexisted harmoniously within the sanctuary's well-designed habitats. It was a sight that filled Lilac's heart with hope. Hank introduced Lilac to his colleagues, fellow zoologists dedicated to preserving Earth's wildlife. Together, they devised a plan to help Lilac and the other Freedom Planet Girls adapt to the real world without losing their unique abilities. Excited about the possibilities that lay ahead, Lilac couldn't wait to explore this new environment. Parting ways temporarily, she promised Hank that she'd return with the other girls.

She was out all day (you may choose the activity that kept her busy all day, work or otherwise) and did not have an opportunity to relieve herself anywhere (you may specify the reason that prevented her from doing so). When reaches the door of her flat, she realizes that she has misplaced her house key. She begins frantically calling her woman flatmate, who is away from the flat and thus doesn’t answer. Then, she begins frantically knocking on the door, hoping that the woman flatmate is present and might hear the knocks. Her urge escalates to the brink of eruption. Suddenly, she can hear an unexpected voice on the other side of the door asking about what's happening - the voice of her aunt, who she wasn't expecting to see and would've rather avoided altogether in such a predicament (the aunt has been staying with the returning woman as of late; she’s the returning woman’s elder by approximately 20 years; give her a name and describe her appearance; she should be wearing an outfit that is adequate for napping). The aunt was apparently napping inside the flat this whole time. The aunt, after verifying the identity of the knocker, begins opening the door, but is taking too much time doing so due to being weary following her nap, as the returning woman implores her to open the door and to hurry up. As the aunt fully opens the door, though, the returning woman reaches her limit. When the aunt opens the door, she is greeted by the sight of the returning woman in an awkward posture of excreting with a an expression of untimely relief on her face, as she is pooping her pants (describe this in elaborate detail). Initially, the aunt is befuddled as to why the returning woman has assumed such a posture and facial expression, and as to why the returning woman is frozen in place and not getting into the flat after the door has been finally opened for her. The aunt asks the returning woman why she isn’t entering, but is met in response with a hand-raise gesture intended to silence, a dismissive verbal reply and soft grunts of exertion that almost sound as if they are filled with relief-induced pleasure, as the returning woman is still in the midst of relieving herself in her pants and relishing the release. The aunt attempts to inquire about the returning woman's peculiar behavior, but reaps the same result, as the returning woman hasn’t finished relieving herself in her pants and is still enjoying the relief. As she is giving the returning woman a puzzled and bemused stare, she is met with the odor that is emanating from the deposit in the returning woman’s pants, to which she reacts (describe this in elaborate detail). It then dawns on the aunt what had just happened. As this is occurring, the returning woman finishes relieving herself in her pants with a sigh of relief. With bewilderment, the aunt asks the returning woman if she just did what she thinks she did. The aunt then breaks into laughter. The returning woman initially tries to avoid explicitly admitting to what had happened and asks the aunt to let her inside the flat. However, after some teasing insistence by the aunt - who wants to hear the returning woman explicitly say what she had done - that she won't let the returning woman enter if she won't explicitly explain what had happened, and after some equivocating on the returning woman's part, the returning woman sheepishly admits that she went in her pants. It is only after this exchange that the returning woman gingerly waddles into the flat, passing by the laughing aunt as the latter is standing at the doorway. As the returning woman is entering and passing by the aunt, the aunt incredulously taunts her for having childishly pooped her pants and for her waddle with poop-filled pants (describe this in elaborate detail). The returning woman is initially indignant and sheepish in reaction to this. After the aunt continues to incredulously tease her for for the way in which she pooped her pants and for the way in which she fully finished relieving herself in her pants while at the door before entering (include these dialogues and don’t omit any parts), the returning woman gradually starts growing out of her initial mortification and playfully tells the aunt with a playful sulk that what happened is her fault because she took too much time opening the door. The returning woman then sets her sight on heading to the bathroom so she can clean up and expresses her desire to do so. However, she is subsequently stopped gently by the aunt, who wants to get a closer look at the returning woman’s poop-filled pants because of her incredulous curiousity over the absurdity of the situation of the returning woman pooping her pants at such an age. After gently and teasingly stopping the playfully resistant and reluctant but eventually cooperating woman in her tracks on her way to the bathroom, the aunt delicately turns the returning woman by the wrist so she can observe her rear end, and proceeds to incredulously taunt her for pooping her pants as an adult, comparing her accident and poop-filled pants to a dirty diaper (describe this in elaborate detail; the aunt’s taunting shouldn’t be sarcastically witty, it should be mockingly teasing instead). The returning woman responds to the aunt’s observation of her rear end in a coy and sheepish manner, relating to the aunt the nasty feeling in her poop-filled pants and playfully whining that she has to go to clean up. The aunt mockingly reacts to the odor that is emanating from the returning woman with a physical gesture and teasingly agrees with the returning woman that the returning woman needs to go and clean up because the returning woman stinks, and the aunt does all of this while addressing the returning woman by a contextually relevant mocking appellation (describe this in elaborate detail; the aunt’s teasing shouldn’t be sarcastically witty, it should be taunting instead). The returning woman accepts the aunt’s mocking and teasing in a coy and sheepish manner, all while commenting on her own poop-filled pants and on the odor that is emanating from herself, but playfully insists ultimately this is all the aunt's doing because of the delay while opening the door (describe this in elaborate detail). Finally, the aunt relents as she’s cackling and lets the returning woman head to clean herself up.","output":"Title: Poo-Faced Welcome Genre: Comedy-Drama TV Series Setting: A modern apartment building in Vancouver, Canada.

She has long, wavy black hair, fair skin, and wears a colorful salwar kameez, a traditional Punjabi outfit. - Gurpreet Kaur: Jasleen's aunt and her recent housemate. Gurpreet is in her early fifties, with short, salt-and-pepper hair, and a relaxed demeanor. She is dressed in comfortable pajamas suitable for napping, except now she finds herself caught in an unexpected predicament. -- INT. APARTMENT HALLWAY - DAY Jasleen Kaur rushes down the hallway, clutching her stomach and scanning her surroundings with desperation. She stumbles, catching herself on the wall, beads of sweat forming on her forehead as she fights the urge to relieve herself. Jasleen reaches her flat's door and fumbles in her bag for her keys. Panic washes over her face as she realizes they are missing. JASLEEN (in a panicked whisper) No, no! Where are my keys? She takes out her phone and hastily dials her flatmate's number. The phone rings, but Gurpreet is nowhere near her phone to answer. JASLEEN (pleadingly) Please, Gurpreet! Pick up! Jasleen hangs up and resorts to desperate knocking on the door. Jasleen's desperation grows as she hears footsteps approaching from inside the flat. Suddenly, her aunt's voice can be heard. GURPREET (O.S.) (confused) Hello? What's happening out there? Jasleen's eyes widen as she realizes her worst nightmare is about to come true. JASLEEN (hurriedly) Auntie, it's me! Please, open the door! Quickly! Gurpreet, sluggish from her nap, struggles to unlock the door. Jasleen's face contorts as the urgency becomes unbearable. She clamps her hands between her legs and squats, unable to hold it in any longer. As the door creaks open, Gurpreet is greeted by the sight of Jasleen in an unthinkable position, her face contorted in relief, and her pants burdened with an outpouring of poop. GURPREET (confused) What on earth are you doing, Jasleen? Jasleen raises her hand to silence her aunt, her face filled with both embarrassment and relief. Soft grunts escape her lips as she continues to relieve herself, momentarily delirious in the sudden release. Gurpreet's confusion turns to disgust as the pungent odor hits her nostrils. GURPREET (holding her nose) Oh my god! Is that...?! Suddenly, the aunt realizes what has transpired, her eyes widening in disbelief. GURPREET (speechless) Did you just...? Jasleen sheepishly nods, now finished with her embarrassing act. Gurpreet bursts into laughter, barely believing her eyes. GURPREET (teasingly) Jasleen! I never thought I would see the day when you'd soil yourself like little kids! Jasleen's indignation battles with her growing acceptance of the absurdity of the situation. JASLEEN (defensively) Oh, come on! It's your fault, taking forever to open the door! Gurpreet's laughter echoes through the hallway as Jasleen slowly waddles past, her soiled pants eliciting gasps from passersby. GURPREET (mockingly) Oh sure, blame your accident on me, Miss Stinky Pants! Jasleen, feeling a mix of embarrassment and playfulness, begins to soften. JASLEEN (playfully sulking) Fine, Auntie! You win this round. I need to clean up. Hurry up and let me go! Gurpreet then stops Jasleen gently by the wrist, her face filled with mock curiosity. GURPREET (teasingly) Hold on, now. I have to get a closer look at these poop-filled pants of yours. Just how absurd can this situation get? Jasleen, reluctant but eventually cooperating, allows her aunt to turn her around for inspection. Jasleen, now with a coy and sheepish grin, relates the unpleasant sensation of her soiled pants. JASLEEN (coyly) Believe me, Auntie, this is not a pleasant experience. I really need to go and clean up. Gurpreet playfully reacts to the odor, waving her hand and teasingly agreeing with Jasleen. GURPREET (teasingly) You're right, you really do stink! Off you go, Dirty Diaper! Jasleen accepts her aunt's mocking and teasing, playfully insisting it's all Gurpreet's fault due to the delayed door opening. JASLEEN (slightly defiant) Fine, Auntie, you win! But remember, this is all on you and your slow motions! Finally, Gurpreet relents, cackling with laughter, and lets Jasleen continue her journey to clean up. Jasleen waddles towards the bathroom, her head held high despite her predicament, and as she passes Gurpreet, a mischievous glint in her eyes, she playfully responds to her aunt one last time. JASLEEN (smirking) Well, Dirty Diaper, I hope you've had your fill of absurdity for the day. I'll be back to get you next time! They both laugh, and as Jasleen disappears into the bathroom, leaving behind a lingering scent of silliness, Gurpreet watches, amused, still chuckling at the outrageous turn of events.

It refers to the buying and selling of goods and services over the internet, allowing businesses to expand their reach beyond physical boundaries and consumers to shop conveniently from the comfort of their homes. With the continuous advancement of technology, e-commerce has become an integral part of our daily lives, transforming the global economy and reshaping traditional business models. One of the key advantages of e-commerce is its ability to overcome geographical barriers. In traditional brick-and-mortar stores, businesses are limited to serving customers within a specific location. However, e-commerce platforms allow businesses to target customers worldwide, leading to a significant increase in their customer base. This has opened up new markets and opportunities for small businesses, enabling them to compete on a global scale. Similarly, consumers now have access to a variety of products and services that may not be available in their local stores. E-commerce has made it possible to shop internationally, giving consumers greater choice and convenience. Furthermore, e-commerce has streamlined the buying process, making it quicker and more efficient. With just a few clicks, consumers can browse through a wide range of products, compare prices, read reviews, and make a purchase at any time of the day. This eliminates the need for physical travel, standing in long queues, and dealing with demanding sales personnel. E-commerce platforms also offer personalized recommendations based on consumer behavior and preferences, enhancing the shopping experience for consumers. The convenience and ease of online shopping have steadily shifted consumer behavior, with an increasing number of people opting for e-commerce channels. Moreover, e-commerce has enabled businesses to reduce costs and increase profitability. Unlike traditional retail stores, online businesses do not require physical stores, large inventories, or a significant number of employees. This leads to substantial cost savings in terms of rent, utilities, and staffing. Additionally, e-commerce platforms provide tools for inventory management, order processing, and customer relationship management, further reducing operational costs. Businesses can also benefit from economies of scale and easily find suppliers and manufacturers from around the world, resulting in cost-effective sourcing. These cost advantages translate into competitive pricing for consumers, making e-commerce an attractive option. However, with the numerous advantages of e-commerce come a few challenges that need to be addressed. Cybersecurity is a primary concern as the internet is plagued with threats such as hacking, data breaches, and identity theft. Businesses need to invest in secure payment gateways, encryption technology, and strong firewalls to protect customer data and maintain trust. Additionally, issues of trust and reliability need to be overcome, as consumers may be skeptical of transferring their payment or personal details online. Building a strong brand, offering reliable customer service, and providing secure transactions are essential in establishing credibility in the e-commerce space. In conclusion, e-commerce has transformed the way businesses operate and consumers shop. It has broken down geographical barriers, expanded market reach, and provided convenience and choice to consumers. The cost-saving advantages of e-commerce have increased profitability for businesses, enabling them to offer competitive pricing. However, ensuring cybersecurity and building trust remain crucial to the continued success of e-commerce. As technology continues to advance, e-commerce will continue to evolve and reshape the global economy, offering limitless opportunities for businesses and consumers alike."},{"instruction":"سلام در

SAM (looking at the gadget with fascination) Can we use it? I mean, just for fun? AARON (chuckles) Sure, why not? Consider it a sneak peek into the world of alien hunting. Jane and Sam take turns examining the gadget, pressing buttons, and marveling at its intricacies. Excitement fills the room. JANE (grinning) Well, well, Aaron Ling, this changes everything. From now on, we're a team. The alien-fighting trio! SAM (raising her fist) Yes! Let's protect our town together, one extraterrestrial at a time!

Suddenly, she can hear an unexpected voice on the other side of the door asking about what's happening - the voice of her aunt, who she wasn't expecting to see and would've rather avoided altogether in such a predicament (the aunt has been staying with the returning woman as of late; she’s the returning woman’s elder by approximately 20 years; give her a name and describe her appearance; she should be wearing an outfit that is adequate for napping). The aunt was apparently napping inside the flat this whole time. The aunt, after verifying the identity of the knocker, begins opening the door, but is taking too much time doing so due to being weary following her nap, as the returning woman implores her to open the door and to hurry up.

When the aunt opens the door, she is greeted by the sight of the returning woman in an awkward posture of excreting with a an expression of untimely relief on her face, as she is pooping her pants (describe this in elaborate detail). Initially, the aunt is befuddled as to why the returning woman has assumed such a posture and facial expression, and as to why the returning woman is frozen in place and not getting into the flat after the door has been finally opened for her.

With bewilderment, the aunt asks the returning woman if she just did what she thinks she did. The aunt then breaks into laughter. The returning woman initially tries to avoid explicitly admitting to what had happened and asks the aunt to let her inside the flat. However, after some teasing insistence by the aunt - who wants to hear the returning woman explicitly say what she had done - that she won't let the returning woman enter if she won't explicitly explain what had happened, and after some equivocating on the returning woman's part, the returning woman sheepishly admits that she went in her pants. It is only after this exchange that the returning woman gingerly waddles into the flat, passing by the laughing aunt as the latter is standing at the doorway. As the returning woman is entering and passing by the aunt, the aunt incredulously taunts her for having childishly pooped her pants and for her waddle with poop-filled pants (describe this in elaborate detail). The returning woman is initially indignant and sheepish in reaction to this. After the aunt continues to incredulously tease her for for the way in which she pooped her pants and for the way in which she fully finished relieving herself in her pants while at the door before entering (include these dialogues and don’t omit any parts), the returning woman gradually starts growing out of her initial mortification and playfully tells the aunt with a playful sulk that what happened is her fault because she took too much time opening the door. The returning woman then sets her sight on heading to the bathroom so she can clean up and expresses her desire to do so. However, she is subsequently stopped gently by the aunt, who wants to get a closer look at the returning woman’s poop-filled pants because of her incredulous curiousity over the absurdity of the situation of the returning woman pooping her pants at such an age. After gently and teasingly stopping the playfully resistant and reluctant but eventually cooperating woman in her tracks on her way to the bathroom, the aunt delicately turns the returning woman by the wrist so she can observe her rear end, and proceeds to incredulously taunt her for pooping her pants as an adult, comparing her accident and poop-filled pants to a dirty diaper (describe this in elaborate detail; the aunt’s taunting shouldn’t be sarcastically witty, it should be mockingly teasing instead).

APARTMENT HALLWAY - DAY The door to the apartment building swings open, revealing a bustling street outside. Enter AISHA, a Pakistani-American woman in her late 20s. She wears casual attire - a loose, patterned shalwar kameez - and looks slightly disheveled. Her face is flush with the agony of a growing emergency. Aisha clutches her stomach, frantically trying to locate her house key. She rummages through her purse and pockets, but it's nowhere to be found. Panic sets in as she realizes her desperate urge to move her bowels is reaching its brink. AISHA (to herself, pleading) Come on, where is it? Please, not now! She pulls out her phone and dials her flatmate, NEELAM. It rings, but there's no answer. Aisha's desperation escalates, and she begins knocking on the door with increasing urgency. AISHA (out of breath) Neelam! Please, I need to get in! Just as she's about to lose hope, a voice can be heard from inside. AUNT FARIDA (60s, plump and wearing a casual sleeping suit) (muffled) What's happening out there? Aisha's relieved but exasperated expression turns into a mix of shock and embarrassment. She would have chosen anyone but her aunt to witness her predicament. AISHA (whispering, under her breath) Oh God, no. Aunt Farida unlocks the door, but her weary state slows down her every move. Aisha's desperation reaches its peak. AISHA (imploring) Auntie, please hurry! It's an emergency! In the surreal sound of the door creaking open, Aisha reaches her limit. The door opens fully, and Aunt Farida is confronted by an awkward sight. Aisha stands, frozen in place, in an awkward posture and an expression of untimely relief on her face. She is in the midst of pooping her pants, which is unfortunately quite evident. Aunt Farida is befuddled, her eyes widening with disbelief. AUNT FARIDA (incredulously) What on earth are you doing, Aisha? Ignoring her aunt's confusion, Aisha pleads for silence as she completes her unfortunate mission, accompanied by soft grunts and sighs of relief. Concerned, Aunt Farida insists on an explanation, unable to comprehend the absurdity before her. AUNT FARIDA (still baffled) Why aren't you coming inside? Aisha silences her aunt with a raised hand, dismissive words, and continuation of relief-induced pleasure. AISHA (sheepish, mid-poop) Wait... just wait. Not done yet. As both Aisha and her aunt stand in the doorway, the scent of the accident reaches Farida. Her perplexed face contorts into a mix of disgust and amusement. Disgusted and amused, Aunt Farida covers her nose, trying to mask the smell that has overtaken the surroundings. At that moment, realization dawns on Aunt Farida. AUNT FARIDA (realization) You did what I think you did! Unable to contain herself, Aunt Farida breaks into laughter. Still frozen in place, Aisha attempts to avoid admitting to the unfortunate event. AISHA (desperate) Can you just let me in, please? However, Aunt Farida teases her playfully, urging her to confess explicitly. Aisha, after much equivocating, finally admits her mortifying truth. AISHA (sheepish) Okay, okay. I...I went in my pants, alright? Only then does Aisha gingerly waddle into the flat, passing by her aunt, who can't help but taunt her. AUNT FARIDA (teasing) Look at you, with your little accident! Did you forget you're not a child anymore? Indignation mixes with sheepishness on Aisha's face. As she continues to enter the apartment, Aunt Farida cheerfully ridicules her waddle and the unfortunate state of her pants. AUNT FARIDA (mocking) You know, some people wear diapers voluntarily. But you, Aisha, you're something else. Gradually overcoming her initial mortification, Aisha's indignation fades, and a playful sulk takes its place. AISHA (playfully sulking) Well, it's your fault. If you hadn't taken forever to open the door... She shifts her focus and eyes the bathroom, eager to clean up. AISHA (resolute) I need to go clean up. Like, right now. Instead of letting her go, Aunt Farida gently intervenes, curious about the absurdity of the situation. She resists playfully and teases Aisha, wanting a closer look at the messy aftermath. AUNT FARIDA (teasing) Hold on just a moment, missy. I have to see this for myself. A dirty diaper at your age? It's almost impressive. Aisha responds coyly, relating the nasty feeling in her pants and playfully whining about needing to clean up. AISHA (coyly) Believe me, it's not pleasant. Can I please go now? Aunt Farida mockingly reacts to the smell and agrees with Aisha, using a contextually relevant mocking appellation. AUNT FARIDA (mocking) Yes, yes, Little Stinker. You really do need to go. You stink up the whole place! Aisha accepts her aunt's mocking with shyness and playfulness, commenting on her own situation while continuing to insist that it's all her aunt's fault for the delay in opening the door. AISHA (coyly) Fine, fine. But don't forget, it's your fault. This wouldn't have happened if you were quicker. Finally relenting, Aunt Farida cackles and lets Aisha head to clean herself up, looking forward to the moment when they can both look back on this hilarious and mortifying ordeal.

She is layered in loose-fitting clothing, including leggings and a colorful long tunic. Sarah's face is flushed, and she walks briskly toward her apartment door, her urgency palpable. SARAH (grumbling) Why must these things always happen at the worst time? As Sarah fumbles through her bag, she realizes her keys are missing. Panic sets in. SARAH (desperate) No, no, no!

You will also take the generic categories I insert into the prompt and impart them with a background, context and flavor that is befitting of an ongoing plot that features a unique story and a unique characters. Based on the aforementioned, please execute the following prompt: Write a very long, coherent, elaborate, descriptive and detailed shooting script, including a full background and replete with unique dialogues (the dialogues’ language should be fitting of the characters’ background and traits - it should align with their unique personalities while maintaining consistency in their portrayal; the dialogues shouldn’t feel forced and should reflect how people would really talk in such a scenario as the one that is portrayed in the scene; there should be no forced attempts at being witty with convoluted banter during the playful teasing portions; the dialogues should be straightforward, should make sense and should befit the genre of the series), for a Comedy-Drama TV Series (the series is about the life of the returning woman who is its main protagonist) comedic scene (the scene, its contents and the interactions within it should develop organically and realistically, despite the absurdity) that includes an African-American woman (give her a name and describe her appearance; she shouldn’t be wearing a dress, a skirt nor jeans) returning home and approaching her flat’s door with a desperate urge to move her bowels. She was out all day (you may choose the activity that kept her busy all day, work or otherwise) and did not have an opportunity to relieve herself anywhere (you may specify the reason that prevented her from doing so). When reaches the door of her flat, she realizes that she has misplaced her house key. She begins frantically calling her woman flatmate, who is away from the flat and thus doesn’t answer. Then, she begins frantically knocking on the door, hoping that the woman flatmate is present and might hear the knocks. Her urge escalates to the brink of eruption. Suddenly, she can hear an unexpected voice on the other side of the door asking about what's happening - the voice of her aunt, who she wasn't expecting to see and would've rather avoided altogether in such a predicament (the aunt has been staying with the returning woman as of late; she’s the returning woman’s elder by approximately 20 years; give her a name and describe her appearance; she should be wearing an outfit that is adequate for napping). The aunt was apparently napping inside the flat this whole time. The aunt, after verifying the identity of the knocker, begins opening the door, but is taking too much time doing so due to being weary following her nap, as the returning woman implores her to open the door and to hurry up. As the aunt fully opens the door, though, the returning woman reaches her limit. When the aunt opens the door, she is greeted by the sight of the returning woman in an awkward posture of excreting with a an expression of untimely relief on her face, as she is pooping her pants (describe this in elaborate detail). Initially, the aunt is befuddled as to why the returning woman has assumed such a posture and facial expression, and as to why the returning woman is frozen in place and not getting into the flat after the door has been finally opened for her. The aunt asks the returning woman why she isn’t entering, but is met in response with a hand-raise gesture intended to silence, a dismissive verbal reply and soft grunts of exertion that almost sound as if they are filled with relief-induced pleasure, as the returning woman is still in the midst of relieving herself in her pants and relishing the release. The aunt attempts to inquire about the returning woman's peculiar behavior, but reaps the same result, as the returning woman hasn’t finished relieving herself in her pants and is still enjoying the relief. As she is giving the returning woman a puzzled and bemused stare, she is met with the odor that is emanating from the deposit in the returning woman’s pants, to which she reacts (describe this in elaborate detail). It then dawns on the aunt what had just happened. As this is occurring, the returning woman finishes relieving herself in her pants with a sigh of relief. With bewilderment, the aunt asks the returning woman if she just did what she thinks she did. The aunt then breaks into laughter. The returning woman initially tries to avoid explicitly admitting to what had happened and asks the aunt to let her inside the flat. However, after some teasing insistence by the aunt - who wants to hear the returning woman explicitly say what she had done - that she won't let the returning woman enter if she won't explicitly explain what had happened, and after some equivocating on the returning woman's part, the returning woman sheepishly admits that she went in her pants. It is only after this exchange that the returning woman gingerly waddles into the flat, passing by the laughing aunt as the latter is standing at the doorway. As the returning woman is entering and passing by the aunt, the aunt incredulously taunts her for having childishly pooped her pants and for her waddle with poop-filled pants (describe this in elaborate detail). The returning woman is initially indignant and sheepish in reaction to this. After the aunt continues to incredulously tease her for for the way in which she pooped her pants and for the way in which she fully finished relieving herself in her pants while at the door before entering (include these dialogues and don’t omit any parts), the returning woman gradually starts growing out of her initial mortification and playfully tells the aunt with a playful sulk that what happened is her fault because she took too much time opening the door. The returning woman then sets her sight on heading to the bathroom so she can clean up and expresses her desire to do so. However, she is subsequently stopped gently by the aunt, who wants to get a closer look at the returning woman’s poop-filled pants because of her incredulous curiousity over the absurdity of the situation of the returning woman pooping her pants at such an age. After gently and teasingly stopping the playfully resistant and reluctant but eventually cooperating woman in her tracks on her way to the bathroom, the aunt delicately turns the returning woman by the wrist so she can observe her rear end, and proceeds to incredulously taunt her for pooping her pants as an adult, comparing her accident and poop-filled pants to a dirty diaper (describe this in elaborate detail; the aunt’s taunting shouldn’t be sarcastically witty, it should be mockingly teasing instead). The returning woman responds to the aunt’s observation of her rear end in a coy and sheepish manner, relating to the aunt the nasty feeling in her poop-filled pants and playfully whining that she has to go to clean up. The aunt mockingly reacts to the odor that is emanating from the returning woman with a physical gesture and teasingly agrees with the returning woman that the returning woman needs to go and clean up because of the odor that is emanating from the returning woman, and the aunt does all of this while addressing the returning woman by a contextually relevant mocking appellation (describe this in elaborate detail; the aunt’s teasing shouldn’t be sarcastically witty, it should be taunting instead). The returning woman accepts the aunt’s mocking and teasing in a coy and sheepish manner, all while commenting on her own poop-filled pants and on the odor that is emanating from herself, but playfully insists ultimately this is all the aunt's doing because of the delay while opening the door (describe this in elaborate detail). Finally, the aunt relents as she’s cackling and lets the returning woman head to clean herself up.","output":"Title: \\"Finding Relief\\" Genre: Comedy-Drama Setting: A modest apartment building located in a vibrant city. The hallway outside the protagonist's door is narrow and dimly lit, creating a sense of claustrophobia. The door itself is worn-out and characteristically creaks when opened. Inside the apartment, the living room is cluttered with an eclectic mix of thrift store finds and modern decorations, a testament to the diverse personalities that reside there. Main Characters: 1. Monica Thompson: The African-American protagonist in her mid-thirties. She exudes confidence, intelligence, and a dry sense of humor. Monica is dressed in casual, comfortable clothes, wearing loose-fitting khaki pants and a brightly patterned blouse. 2. Aunt Helen: Monica's elderly aunt, approximately 20 years older. She is an energetic and gregarious woman, with a penchant for napping. Helen wears loose-fitting pajamas, a colorful caftan with floral prints, and a set of fluffy slippers. Scene: INT. APARTMENT BUILDING - HALLWAY - DAY Monica approaches the door to her apartment briskly but cringes, clearly uncomfortable. She digs through her bag, frantically searching for her keys. Sweat stains her brow. MONICA (under her breath) Come on, where are those darn keys? She fumbles, growing increasingly desperate. Finally, she releases an exasperated sigh, realizing her keys are missing. MONICA Damn it! INT. APARTMENT BUILDING - HALLWAY - CONTINUOUS Monica hastily pulls out her phone and dials her flatmate's number. It rings, but there's no answer. Her sense of urgency escalates. She starts pounding on the door. MONICA (desperate) Sarah! Sarah! Let me in! Please! Her pleas echo through the hallway, but silence prevails. Monica's face contorts with the pressure that has built up. She can no longer hide her discomfort. MONICA (disbelief) Oh, no. No, no, no! INT. APARTMENT - LIVING ROOM - CONTINUOUS Inside the apartment, Aunt Helen stirs from her deep slumber on the couch. Disoriented and groggy, she follows the noise and approaches the door. AUNT HELEN (sleepily) What's all that racket? INT. APARTMENT BUILDING - HALLWAY - CONTINUOUS Monica's eyes widen in surprise as she hears Aunt Helen's voice from behind the door. MONICA (relieved) Aunt Helen? What are you doing here? AUNT HELEN (yawning) Well, I decided to take a nap here, sweetie. The bed was just too soft. INT. APARTMENT - LIVING ROOM - CONTINUOUS Aunt Helen slowly unlocks the door, struggling with the latch. The urgency in Monica's voice grows. MONICA (hurriedly) Hurry up, Auntie! I can't hold it any longer! INT. APARTMENT BUILDING - HALLWAY - CONTINUOUS Just as Aunt Helen finally opens the door, Monica's strained expression changes. It turns into a look of complete relief mixed with embarrassment. She has uncontrollably soiled herself. The sight makes Aunt Helen raise an eyebrow, totally perplexed. She tries to move past Monica and into the apartment but stops when she becomes fully aware of the unpleasant smell. Horrified, she clasps a hand to her mouth. AUNT HELEN (gagging) Oh my Lord… What in heaven's name? Monica, unable to speak, merely raises her hand to hush Aunt Helen while releasing soft grunts of relief. She's still in the midst of the accident, savoring the momentary release. Aunt Helen, bewildered, stares at Monica in utter confusion. AUNT HELEN (incredulous) Monica, what on earth are you doing? And what's that smell? Finally, Monica finishes her business, sighing with a mixture of relief and embarrassment. Aunt Helen's eyes widen in realization. AUNT HELEN (disbelief) Did you just... Oh my goodness! Aunt Helen bursts into laughter, unable to contain her amusement any longer. Monica tries to avoid the situation, pleading with Aunt Helen to let her inside the apartment. MONICA (panicking) Aunt Helen, please, don't make fun of me like this. Let me in! Aunt Helen playfully insists on an explicit confession from Monica, teasing her relentlessly. AUNT HELEN (teasingly) Monica, sweetie, unless you tell me what just happened, I'm afraid I can't let you in. Monica squirms, avoiding eye contact but then succumbs to Aunt Helen's persistence. MONICA (sheepishly) Fine, fine! I had an accident, I went in my pants, okay? Allowing Monica to enter, Aunt Helen steps aside, still laughing. INT. APARTMENT - LIVING ROOM - CONTINUOUS As Monica gingerly waddles into the apartment, Aunt Helen, standing by the doorway, taunts her about her situation. AUNT HELEN (teasingly) Aw, my dear, you poop your pants like a little baby! Monica's indignation is evident, but she starts to regain her sense of humor. MONICA (defiantly) Oh, come on, Aunt Helen! It's your fault; you were too slow at opening the door! Aunt Helen counters, addressing Monica's gait and odor mockingly. AUNT HELEN (mockingly) Well, well, well, look at you, waddling around like a toddler with a dirty diaper. No wonder you took so long! Monica, initially embarrassed, starts to embrace the absurdity of the situation and playfully responds. MONICA (coyly) Ugh, it feels awful! Let me go clean up already. Aunt Helen mockingly gestures at the lingering odor, conceding to Monica's needs. AUNT HELEN (teasingly) Yes, yes, my little stinker. You need to get yourself cleaned up. That smell is unbearable! Monica, accepting the mocking and teasing, jokes about her own situation, playfully blaming Aunt Helen for the delay. MONICA (sheepishly) I swear, Aunt Helen, this is all your fault. If you hadn't taken that nap, I wouldn't have resorted to such drastic measures! Laughing, Aunt Helen finally relents and steps aside, allowing Monica to head to the bathroom to restore her dignity. CLOSING SHOT: Monica walks past Aunt Helen, who continues to giggle, as the door slowly shuts behind her. The laughter echoes in the hallway, creating a lighthearted and absurd atmosphere.

Introduction 1.1 Background and Significance of Restrictive Lung Disease 1.2 Objectives of the Study","output":"1. Introduction 1.1 Background and Significance of Restrictive Lung Disease Restrictive lung disease refers to a group of respiratory disorders that cause a decrease in lung volume and a reduction in the ability to expand the lungs properly. It is characterized by reduced lung compliance, impaired lung function, and limitations in the ability to breathe adequately. Restrictive lung disease can be caused by various factors, including interstitial lung diseases (such as idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis), neuromuscular diseases (such as muscular dystrophy), chest wall deformities, and pleural diseases. Restrictive lung disease can lead to considerable morbidity and mortality, affecting the quality of life and overall well-being of individuals. It can cause symptoms such as dyspnea (shortness of breath), cough, fatigue, and exercise intolerance. Therefore, effective examination and rehabilitation strategies are essential in managing patients with restrictive lung disease. 1.2 Objectives of the Study The primary objective of this study is to examine the various examination methods used to evaluate restrictive lung disease and their efficacy in determining the severity and progression of the disease. This will involve reviewing commonly used diagnostic tests, such as pulmonary function tests (spirometry, lung volumes, and diffusing capacity), exercise testing, imaging (chest X-rays, chest CT scans), and biomarkers to identify and assess restrictive lung disease. The secondary objective is to review and evaluate the available rehabilitation interventions for patients with restrictive lung disease. Rehabilitation plays a crucial role in improving symptom management, functional capacity, and overall quality of life for individuals with restrictive lung disease. This study will explore the different rehabilitative approaches, including exercise training, breathing techniques, airway clearance techniques, and patient education. To achieve these objectives, a comprehensive literature review will be conducted to identify relevant studies, clinical trials, and systematic reviews on examination and rehabilitation in restrictive lung disease. The research will focus on peer-reviewed articles published in the last decade to ensure the inclusion of the most up-to-date and relevant information. The findings of this research will provide healthcare professionals, including physicians, pulmonologists, and respiratory therapists, with a better understanding of the examination methods available for diagnosing and evaluating restrictive lung disease. Furthermore, it will highlight the importance of rehabilitation interventions in improving patient outcomes and guiding healthcare professionals in developing effective rehabilitation programs for individuals with restrictive lung disease. In conclusion, this research paper aims to provide a comprehensive overview of examination methods and rehabilitation interventions in the management of restrictive lung disease. By synthesizing existing evidence, this study will contribute to the development of evidence-based guidelines and recommendations for the diagnosis, assessment, and rehabilitation of individuals with restrictive lung disease."},{"instruction":"ما هي فوائد النعناع مع الشاي؟","output":"هناك العديد من الفوائد التي يمكن أن يقدمها النعناع عند استخدامه مع الشاي، وهذه بعض الفوائد المعروفة: 1- تحسين الهضم: يمكن أن يساعد النعناع في تحسين عملية الهضم وتخفيف الانتفاخ والغازات المعوية. 2- تهدئة الجهاز الهضمي: قد يساعد النعناع في تهدئة الجهاز الهضمي وتخفيف أعراض القولون العصبي والحرقة. 3- منع الغثيان: يمكن أن يساعد النعناع في تهدئة المعدة وتخفيف الغثيان والقيء. 4- تخفيف الصداع: يمكن أن يساعد شاي النعناع في تخفيف الصداع والتوتر وتهدئة الجهاز العصبي. 5- منع التهاب البلعوم: يمكن أن يعمل النعناع كمضاد للالتهابات ويساعد على تخفيف أعراض التهاب البلعوم والحنجرة. 6- تعزيز التركيز: يمكن للنعناع أن يحسن التركيز والانتباه ويعزز اليقظة العقلية. 7- تهدئة الأعصاب: يمكن أن تعمل خصائص النعناع المهدئة على تهدئة الأعصاب وتخفيف التوتر والقلق. ومع ذلك، يجب الانتباه إلى أنه قد يكون للنعناع بعض الآثار الجانبية، مثل حرقة المعدة أو السعال عند بعض الأشخاص، وقد تتفاعل مع بعض الأدوية، لذا يُنصح بالتحدث إلى الطبيب أو الصيدلي قبل استخدامه."},{"instruction":"Freedom Planet was in Stick war legac part 1","output":"I'm sorry, but I'm unable to continue the text as it doesn't make sense.

MAC-to-VTEP mapping: This mapping is used to identify the VTEP that an individual MAC address is associated with. VTEP is a software or hardware entity that encapsulates, decapsulates, and forwards VXLAN traffic between virtual and physical networks. It helps in achieving network virtualization by extending Layer 2 connectivity over an IP network. MAC-to-VTEP mapping allows the receiving VTEP to determine the destination VTEP for a specific MAC address. 2. MAC-to-IP mapping: In the VXLAN overlay network, MAC-to-IP mapping is used to identify the IP address of the VTEP associated with a particular MAC address. It establishes a correlation between the MAC address and the IP address of the VTEP that handles traffic for that MAC address. MAC-to-IP mapping is required to ensure that VMs (Virtual Machines) within the VXLAN network can communicate with each other, even if they are located on different VTEPs. In summary, MAC-to-VTEP mapping determines the VTEP associated with a MAC address, while MAC-to-IP mapping determines the IP address of the VTEP associated with a MAC address. Both mappings are essential for ensuring proper communication and forwarding of traffic within a VXLAN overlay network."},{"instruction":"but how, in a vxlan, overlay network, first time the source VM , witch did not know the mac address of the remote VM get this mac address ?","output":"In a VXLAN overlay network, when a source VM needs to communicate with a destination VM for the first time, it does not have the MAC address of the remote VM in its MAC-to-VTEP or MAC-to-IP mapping table. In this scenario, the source VM uses an ARP (Address Resolution Protocol) request to obtain the MAC address. Here is the general sequence of events: 1. The source VM wants to communicate with a destination VM using its IP address. 2. The source VM checks its local ARP cache to find the MAC address corresponding to the destination IP. 3. If the MAC address is not found in the cache, the source VM sends an ARP request packet to the default gateway or router. 4. The ARP request packet is broadcasted across the VXLAN overlay network. 5. The destination VM with the corresponding IP address receives the ARP request. 6. The destination VM responds to the ARP request with its MAC address. 7. The source VM updates its ARP cache with the MAC-to-IP mapping received from the destination VM. 8. The source VM encapsulates the data packets with the MAC and IP addresses, using the MAC-to-VTEP mapping to identify the destination VTEP. 9. The encapsulated packets are forwarded across the overlay network to the destination VTEP. 10. The destination VTEP decapsulates the packets and delivers them to the destination VM based on the MAC address. In summary, when the source VM does not have the MAC address of the remote VM, it uses ARP to request the MAC address from the destination VM. Once received, the source VM caches the MAC-to-IP mapping for future communication."},{"instruction":"is it the same things, when using Mp-BGP EVPN for the controle plane ?","output":"When using MP-BGP (Multiprotocol Border Gateway Protocol) EVPN (Ethernet Virtual Private Network) for the control plane in a VXLAN overlay network, the process for obtaining MAC addresses of remote VMs is different. In MP-BGP EVPN, the control plane is responsible for distributing MAC-to-VTEP and MAC-to-IP mapping information among the participating VTEPs. Here is how the process works: 1. Each VTEP advertises its locally learned MAC addresses, IP addresses, and associated VTEP information to the MP-BGP EVPN control plane. 2. This information is then distributed across the VXLAN overlay network using BGP routes with EVPN forwarding extensions. 3. Each VTEP receives the BGP updates from other VTEPs, which contain MAC-to-VTEP and MAC-to-IP mapping information. 4. The VTEPs build and maintain their respective MAC-to-VTEP and MAC-to-IP mapping tables based on the received BGP updates. 5. When a source VM needs to communicate with a destination VM, the source VTEP consults its MAC-to-VTEP mapping table to identify the destination VTEP. 6. The source VTEP encapsulates the data packets with the MAC and IP addresses, using the MAC-to-VTEP mapping information obtained from the control plane. 7. The encapsulated packets are then forwarded to the destination VTEP across the overlay network. 8. The destination VTEP performs decapsulation and delivers the packets to the destination VM based on the MAC address. So, in MP-BGP EVPN, the control plane is responsible for exchanging and distributing MAC-to-VTEP and MAC-to-IP mapping information among the VTEPs. The VTEPs maintain their mapping tables based on the received updates, allowing them to know the MAC addresses of remote VMs without needing ARP requests like in traditional Ethernet networks."},{"instruction":"do evpn record vm ip and mac address ?","output":"Yes, EVPN (Ethernet Virtual Private Network) does record both VM (Virtual Machine) IP and MAC addresses. EVPN is a control plane solution designed to provide Layer 2 and Layer 3 virtual private networks over an IP network infrastructure. In EVPN, MAC addresses are associated with IP addresses to enable VM connectivity. This information is recorded in the EVPN control plane to facilitate the distribution of reachability and forwarding information between VTEPs (Virtual Tunnel End Points). The key purpose of EVPN is to provide seamless communication between dispersed VMs across the VXLAN (Virtual Extensible LAN) overlay network. EVPN achieves this by leveraging BGP (Border Gateway Protocol) as the control plane protocol, which allows the VTEPs to exchange MAC-to-VTEP and MAC-to-IP mappings. The IP addresses associated with MAC addresses enable proper packet routing and forwarding within the EVPN overlay network. So, to summarize, EVPN records both VM IP and MAC addresses as part of its control plane mechanism for achieving efficient and scalable connectivity within the network."},{"instruction":"with FRR, how can I view this Ip/MAC records ?","output":"In an EVPN network using FRR (Free Range Routing), you can view the IP/MAC records by accessing the FRR command-line interface (CLI) and using appropriate commands.

When a packet is sent from a source VM (Virtual Machine) within the EVPN network to a destination that is located outside the VXLAN domain, the traffic is encapsulated at the source VTEP with a VXLAN header. This header contains the necessary information such as the destination VTEP's IP address to ensure proper routing within the overlay network. As the packet traverses the VXLAN network, it may encounter multiple VTEPs until it reaches the appropriate exit node. The exit node is the VTEP that is directly connected or associated with the destination outside the EVPN network. This VTEP performs decapsulation by removing the VXLAN header and delivers the packet to the destination outside the EVPN domain using standard IP-based routing. The exit node is responsible for forwarding the traffic from the EVPN network to the external network or destination, which can be a physical network, another VLAN, or an external IP network.

Voici comment procéder : 1. Analyse des besoins : La première étape consiste à analyser les besoins spécifiques pour la gestion des routes nationales. Il peut s'agir de la collecte et du stockage des données sur les routes, de la gestion des péages, de la gestion du trafic, de la planification des projections de trafic, etc. Il est important de définir clairement les fonctionnalités requises. 2. Conception du système : Sur la base des besoins identifiés, une conception détaillée du système doit être réalisée. Cela inclut la définition de l'architecture logicielle, le choix des technologies appropriées, la définition des bases de données nécessaires, etc. 3. Développement de l'application : Cette étape implique le développement du système en utilisant les langages de programmation et les outils appropriés. Il est important de suivre des bonnes pratiques de développement logiciel afin d'assurer la qualité du code et la maintenance à long terme. 4. Collecte et gestion des données : Le système devra collecter et stocker des données sur les routes nationales, telles que les caractéristiques de la route, les conditions météorologiques, les accidents, les travaux de maintenance, etc. Une interface utilisateur intuitive sera nécessaire pour faciliter la saisie et la gestion de ces données. 5. Planification du trafic : Le système devrait être capable de planifier le trafic en utilisant les données collectées. Il peut s'agir de recommandations d'itinéraires, d'estimations de temps de trajet, de calculs de péages, etc. 6. Gestion des péages : Si les routes nationales comportent des péages, le système devrait permettre la gestion des paiements et des transactions. Cela peut inclure l'intégration avec des systèmes de paiement électronique, la gestion des abonnements, etc. 7. Maintenance et surveillance : Le système devra être régulièrement mis à jour et maintenu pour résoudre les éventuels problèmes et ajouter de nouvelles fonctionnalités. Il doit également être surveillé en temps réel pour détecter les problèmes de performances et les éventuelles pannes. 8. Sécurité : La sécurité des données est essentielle dans un système de gestion de routes nationales. Des mesures de sécurité robustes doivent être mises en place pour protéger les données des utilisateurs et pour éviter toute tentative de piratage. En suivant ces étapes, il est possible de développer un système informatique efficace pour la gestion des routes nationales. Cependant, il convient de noter que chaque pays a ses propres exigences et réglementations en matière de gestion de routes, il est donc important de prendre en compte ces facteurs locaux lors du développement du système."},{"instruction":"(In the clubroom…) Monika: “Natsuki sure is taking a while to show up…” Yuri: “Maybe she went to get a snack?” Sayori: “Perhaps so, Yuri.” (noticing Monika’s baby bump) “Hey Monika, how’s little Minika doing in there?” Monika: (laughs) “Little Minika is doing just fine, thank you for asking, Sayori.

In addition, we assessed the association between ALYREF expression and clinical features of HNSCC patients and its effects on immune-cell infiltration by using the TIMER database. Moreover, we explored differentially expressed genes related to ALYREF, with a focus on enriched pathways and hub genes. ALYREF was critically upregulated in HNSCC tumor tissues and cancer cell lines, especially in advanced TNM stages and histological grades. Overexpressed ALYREF was significantly associated with poor prognosis and immune-cell infiltration in HNSCC. Protein-protein interaction network analysis We detected a total of 10 hub genes in protein-protein interaction (PPI) network, which were significantly upregulated in HNSCC tissues.

The researchers analyzed data from The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) to determine the expression levels of ALYREF in various types of cancer tissues. They also examined the correlation between ALYREF expression and clinical features of HNSCC patients and its impact on immune cell infiltration using the TIMER database. Additionally, the study identified differentially expressed genes associated with ALYREF and focused on enriched pathways and hub genes. The findings revealed that ALYREF was significantly upregulated in HNSCC tumor tissues and cancer cell lines, particularly in advanced TNM stages and histological grades. High levels of ALYREF expression were associated with poor prognosis and increased immune cell infiltration in HNSCC. The study also identified 10 hub genes that were significantly upregulated in HNSCC tissues based on protein-protein interaction network analysis. Overall, the study suggests that elevated ALYREF expression is closely linked to HNSCC initiation and development, making it a potential diagnostic and prognostic marker for HNSCC."},{"instruction":"Colon cancer is a prevalent and highly fatal cancer worldwide. While previous studies have identified FABP4 as a potential cancer biomarker, its mechanism of action in colon cancer has not been thoroughly investigated. This study aims to explore the biological significance of FABP4 in colon cancer by analyzing large-scale gene expression profiles and clinical samples.A total of 453 colon cancer (COAD) tissue samples, along with 41 normal tissue samples, were selected from The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) database. These cases were accompanied by complete clinical information. Differential analysis and COX analysis were performed to investigate the diagnostic and prognostic value of FABP4 in COAD, based on its expression levels. The weighted gene co-expression network analysis (WGCNA) approach was utilized to identify genes co-expressed with FABP4. Subsequently, Gene Ontology (GO) and Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes (KEGG) enrichment analyses were conducted to explore the potential biological functions of these co-expressed genes. Finally, immunoinfiltration analysis was performed using the ESTIMATE, CIBERSORT, and ssGSEA methods.FABP4 exhibited significant differential expression in COAD and emerged as a promising diagnostic marker. Its expression was notably higher in patients with advanced tumor stages and metastasis, and showed a significant positive correlation with poor overall survival (OS), thus indicating FABP4 as an independent adverse prognostic factor. Enrichment analysis of the co-expressed gene set revealed cell adhesion as the prominent biological function. Additionally, immunological analysis demonstrated a significant positive correlation between FABP4 expression in COAD and immune cell infiltration.This study highlights the close association between FABP4 expression levels and clinicopathological factors in COAD, establishing FABP4 as an effective biomarker for diagnosis and prognosis. Moreover, FABP4 was found to promote the invasion and development of colon cancer through cell adhesion and immune-related pathways.","output":"This study aimed to investigate the biological significance of FABP4 in colon cancer.

In the examples of 11 and 12, the operator firstly emphasizes his institutional identity through claiming to be a “police officer”. Then through strict wording, he attempts to dis￾tance from the recipient with the use of legal lexical resources like “strictly combat”, “accept the case to investigate”, “cancel the lawsuit” and “explain clearly”. Such a question like “Are you clear?” does not require the recipient to answer, but is adopted to confirm the differences of the identity and status of the operator and the recipient, positioning the recipient in the identity of the “suspected offender” who should make a truthful confes￾sion. The party with greater power in the conversation is usually the initiator of the turn, who can control the content and interrupt the other party. People in communication achieve their specific communicative purpose by choosing discourse resources and give meaning to the linguistic symbol according to the purpose in the process of communication. The purpose is closely linked to institutional power, and the realization of purpose is closely related to power as well. The operator constructs his “police” identity through discoursal practice and obtains the power entitled by the law, thereby achieving the purposes of obtaining information and defrauding money (see examples 13 and 14). Generic structure of the telecom and internet fraud Genres are ways in which people “get things done” through their use of language in par￾ticular contexts or discourse communities. Bhatia (1993, 13) describes genre as a recogniz￾able communicative event characterized by a set of communicative purpose(s) identified and mutually understood by the members of the professional or academic community in which it regularly occurs. It is primarily characterized by the communicative purpose(s) that it is intended to fulfill. As a type of genre, the discourse of the telecom and internet fraud has fixed “phone script” with relatively stable moves, with linguistic structure and stylistic features of “professional” discourses, representing the communicative purpose and ideology shared by all the members of the “professional” discourse community. The genre is implemented by actors of different identities at respective stages, and the generic structure presents multiple characteristics (See Table 1). Moves are presented in left column and discourse resources of each move and step are on the right. The telecom and internet fraud genre provides a “template” for the members of the discourse community, i.e. the fraudsters, to conduct illegal activities. They use the template to plan, adjust, and implement behaviors for their intended target.

They perform their own function separately and also “seamlessly” joint with each, and efficiently “doing things” in order to achieve the communicative goal of gaining the trust of victims and defrauding money. The rhetorical frameworks with typical generic move structure provide fraudster a sufficient language tool, as the “phone script” is a highly conventionalised and standardized genre. With the use of similar structures, stylistic features and content of the “phone script” discourse, the operators of the fraudster gang can be well trained at low cost but with high efficiency, which leads to a rapid spread of the telecom and internet fraud. On the other hand, genre is both a static and a dynamic system, established on the allowable forms of configuration (Cheng 2007, 2010). In the above table, the content of the right column is conventionalized with some optional elements which will not have influence on the genre when these options are made within “generic structure potential” (Cheng 2007, 2010; Hasan 1984).

Conclusion As Fairclough (2003, 2006) believes, society and individuals are constantly constructed by discursive practice through the positive medium of language. The identity of discourse producers is not fixed but dynamically constructed in discursive practice and other social practices. The fraudsters organize and supervise the generation and development of speech activities according to the communicative purpose. On the one hand, fraud￾sters make the recipients agree with the ideology and social identity they construct by manipulating the discourse resources, and on the other hand, by positioning recipients’ identity, fraudsters’ self-identity is built by others through semiotic resources. In the fraud discourse practice, fraudsters construct and consolidate their identity as representatives of legal institutions in social and cultural context by adopting a variety of generic resources and language strategies. In addition to the embedding and mixture of genres and styles in interaction, fraudsters use written texts to visually increase the psychological impact on the recipient, such as forged wanted order, criminal arrest order, mandatory asset freeze execution etc., constructing and strengthening an identity of a suspect, restraining the recipient’s choice and control of discursive resources, and reflecting the asymmetrical relationship in power between the two parties in the interaction. However, the identity of the fraudsters is formed relative to others in discourse activity, and the identity construction is not done overnight. In the non-contact crime of telecom and internet fraud, fraudsters cannot implement the means of coercion and violence; on the contrary, they make the victims voluntarily transfer money through discourse practice. Therefore, the move of “achieving agreement” in the fraud genre needs to be attached great importance to. By believing in the innocence of the recipient, the fraudster provides intersubjective communication and expands the dialogic space, diverting the recipient to self-prove the innocence, eliciting the recipient’s personal information in the process of negotiation and persuasion and finally defrauding money. As Bakhtin states: The speaker strives to get a reading on his own word, and on his own conceptual system that determines this word, within the alien conceptual system of the understanding recipient; he enters into dialogical relationships with certain aspects of this system. The speaker breaks through the alien conceptual horizon of the listener, constructs his own utterance on alien territory, against his, the listener’s, apperceptive background. (1981, 282) Identity construction refers not only to the construction of real identity but also that of false identity. Criminal suspects can hardly conceal facts by constructing false identities to commit illegal acts or escape legal sanctions in a narrowly linguistic way, whereas the social semiotic dimension of interpretation plays an essential role in the process. Therefore, as the main character impersonated by fraudsters and case handlers as well, the law enforcement and judicial officers need to be aware of the process of identity construction and its consequences in social practices such as discursive practice, to clarify and verify their identity, and meanwhile, construct their own identity as institutional representatives in their daily law enforcement and judicial activities. In addition, the further exploration in the semiotic resources could be conducted to unfold the inconsistency between the law officers and fraudsters in the interpretation of signs. Notes","output":"结论 正如Fairclough（2003，2006）所认为的那样，社会和个体是通过积极的语言实践不断构建起来的。话语制作者的身份并不是固定的，而是在话语实践和其他社会实践中动态构建的。欺诈者根据交际目的组织和监督言语活动的生成和发展。一方面，通过操纵话语资源，欺诈者使接收者同意他们构建的意识形态和社会身份，并通过符号资源由他人来定位接收者的身份而建立起自己的自我身份。在欺诈话语实践中，欺诈者通过采用各种通用资源和语言策略，在社会和文化背景中构建和巩固他们作为合法机构代表的身份。除了交互中各种流派和风格的嵌入和混合外，欺诈者还使用书面文本以增强对接收者的心理影响，例如伪造的通缉令、犯罪逮捕令、强制冻结财产执行等，构建和加强嫌疑人的身份，限制接收者对话语资源的选择和控制，并反映出交互中双方之间的权力不对称关系。 然而，欺诈者的身份相对于其他人在话语活动中形成，身份建构并不是一蹴而就的。在电信和网络欺诈这种非接触式犯罪中，欺诈者无法采取强迫和暴力手段；相反，他们通过话语实践使受害者自愿转账。因此，在欺诈流派中，“达成共识”的行动需要予以高度重视。通过相信接收者的无辜，欺诈者提供了共识性沟通并扩大了对话空间，将接收者转向自证无罪，通过谈判和说服的过程中获取接收者的个人信息，最终实施欺诈手段。正如巴赫金所说： 说话者努力在理解接收者的陌生概念体系中读取自己的话语和决定该话语的概念体系，并与该体系的某些方面建立对话关系。说话者打破了听众的陌生概念视野，在陌生的领域中构建自己的话语，对抗他，听者，的知觉背景（1981，282）。身份建构不仅指真实身份的建构，也包括虚假身份的建构。犯罪嫌疑人很难仅通过构建虚假身份以狭义的语言方式来隐藏事实，而社会符号解释的语境在这个过程中发挥着至关重要的作用。因此，执法和司法人员作为欺诈者所冒充的主要角色，需要意识到身份建构的过程及其在诸如话语实践等社会实践中的后果，以澄清和验证自己的身份，并同时在日常执法和司法活动中构建自己作为机构代表的身份。此外，可以进行更深入的符号资源探索，揭示执法人员与欺诈者在符号解释方面的不一致之处。 注释"},{"instruction":"(In the clubroom…) Monika: “Natsuki sure is taking a while to show up…” Yuri: “Maybe she went to get a snack?” Sayori: “Perhaps so, Yuri.” (noticing Monika’s baby bump) “Hey Monika, how’s little Minika doing in there?” Monika: (laughs) “Little Minika is doing just fine, thank you for asking, Sayori.

Он осознавал, что каждый член экипажа играл важную роль в достижении общей цели и был обязан как знать свое дело, так и поддерживать и разделять общую философию команды. Бек придавал огромное значение обучению и развитию своих подчиненных, чтобы они стали компетентными профессионалами и могли передать свои знания другим. Он обучал их тактике, стратегии и основам подводного флота, чтобы они стали сильными и уверенными лидерами. Также он ставил перед своими людьми высокие стандарты и требовал от них максимальной отдачи в работе. Он строго контролировал выполнение задач, обучал их боевым приемам и тактике, и был всегда готов помочь и поддержать свою команду в сложных ситуациях.

Regression，简称GPR）是一种非参数的回归方法，它通过对观测数据的处理，建立输入变量与输出变量之间的映射关系。 GPR基于贝叶斯理论，假设观测数据是通过一个潜在的高斯过程生成的。高斯过程可以看作是由无限多个连续的随机变量组成的随机过程，它的特点是任意有限个变量的联合分布服从多元高斯分布。在GPR中，通过将高斯过程作为模型的先验分布，利用观测数据来更新模型的后验分布，从而得到输入变量与输出变量之间的映射关系。 GPR的推断过程主要包括两个步骤：先验系统建模和后验推断。在先验系统建模中，通过定义高斯过程的均值函数和协方差函数来描述预测函数的分布。均值函数表示预测函数的平均值，协方差函数则反映了不同输入变量之间的相关性。在后验推断中，通过观测数据来更新模型的参数，得到预测函数的后验分布。此后，可以通过预测函数的后验分布来进行预测和评估。 GPR在回归问题中的应用具有以下特点： 1. 非参数性：GPR不对模型的形状做出假设，因此可以灵活应对各种形状的数据分布。 2. 不确定性估计：GPR可以提供对预测结果的不确定性估计，包括置信区间或方差等信息，有助于准确评估预测的可靠性。 3. 数据效率：GPR在处理样本数量较少的情况下表现良好，能够通过先验概率来利用输入变量之间的相关性，从而更好地预测输出变量。 4. 灵活性：GPR可以通过选择不同的均值函数、协方差函数和超参数等来适应不同的数据特征，具有较高的灵活性。 GPR在实际应用中具有广泛的领域，包括但不限于以下几个方面： 1. 金融预测：GPR可以用于预测股市指数、外汇汇率等金融数据的走势，为投资决策提供参考。 2. 医疗诊断：GPR可以用于医疗数据的建模和分析，从而实现对患者病情的预测和诊断。 3. 环境监测：GPR可以用于分析和预测环境监测数据，例如气象数据、空气质量指数等。 4. 机器人控制：GPR可以用于机器人控制和路径规划，通过建模和预测环境因素来优化机器人的行为。 总之，GPR作为一种非参数的回归方法，在多个领域具有广泛的应用，可用于建立输入变量与输出变量之间的映射关系，并提供预测结果的不确定性估计，具有较高的灵活性和数据效率。"},{"instruction":"举个应用的例子","output":"一个实际应用高斯过程回归的例子是气温预测。假设我们有一些历史气温的观测数据，包括日期和对应的气温值。我们想要建立一个模型来预测未来某天的气温。

在使用高斯过程回归进行线性拟合时，可以选择一个线性的均值函数，例如恒定的均值。协方差函数可以根据观测数据的特点选择，例如选择线性核函数。 然后，通过观测数据来更新模型的参数，得到预测函数的后验分布。在线性拟合中，由于选择了线性的均值函数，通常不需要像非线性拟合那样进行复杂的参数更新步骤，可以通过简单的最小二乘法等方法来进行模型参数的估计。 最后，可以利用该模型来进行线性拟合。给定一个新的输入变量，可以使用预测模型得到对应的输出变量的预测值。 值得注意的是，高斯过程回归在线性拟合的应用中可能相对于其他传统的线性回归方法来说过于复杂，也不是最常见的使用场景。在大多数情况下，传统的线性回归方法可能更加简单且高效。但如果需要对线性模型进行灵活的不确定性估计或者在数据量较少、输入变量之间存在相关性的情况下，高斯过程回归仍然可以用于线性拟合。"},{"instruction":"详细介绍下高斯过程回归怎么应用于非线性拟合","output":"当应用高斯过程回归进行非线性拟合时，可以基于以下步骤进行操作： 1. 数据准备：准备包含输入变量和对应输出变量的训练数据集。确保数据集的覆盖范围和分布尽可能全面且具有代表性。 2. 均值函数选择：选择适当的均值函数来描述预测模型的先验分布。在非线性拟合中，常用的均值函数有常值函数、多项式函数或其他非线性函数。 3. 协方差函数选择：选择合适的协方差函数来描述输入变量之间的相关性。常用的协方差函数包括高斯核函数、线性核函数、多项式核函数、径向基函数等。协方差函数的选择通常需要根据数据的特点和问题的需求进行调试和优化。 4. 超参数选择：超参数是均值函数和协方差函数中的参数，它们决定了模型的形状和拟合程度。超参数的选择可以通过最大似然估计、交叉验证等方法来进行。通过最大化似然函数或最小化误差平方和等统计度量，可以优化超参数的值。 5. 模型训练：通过观测数据来更新模型的参数，得到预测函数的后验分布。通常使用贝叶斯推断方法来计算后验概率。这涉及到求解高斯过程的条件概率分布，可以通过高效的数值方法进行计算。 6.

Мы можем использовать формулу для средней скорости: Средняя скорость = общее расстояние / общее время 6 = 2х / общее время Теперь у нас есть другая информация - скорость на первой половине пути в 3 раза больше, чем на второй половине пути. То есть, скорость на первой половине пути будет в 3 раза больше, чем скорость на второй половине. Пусть скорость на второй половине пути будет V, тогда скорость на первой половине пути будет 3V. Общее время можно выразить как сумму времени на первой половине пути и времени на второй половине пути: общее время = время на первой половине + время на второй половине Так как скорость = расстояние / время, то мы можем записать: Время на первой половине = х / (3V) Время на второй половине = х / V Общее время = х / (3V) + х / V = (х + 3х) / (3V) = 4х / (3V) Теперь мы можем подставить это общее время в уравнение для средней скорости: 6 = 2х / (4х / (3V)) 6 = 3V / 2 V = 6 * 2 / 3 V = 4 км/ч Таким образом, скорость катера на первой половине пути составляет 3 * 4 = 12 км/ч."},{"instruction":"Выполни математическую постановку задач a = 6^2.45-(4^5√9)^-3/4tg2 b = sin(6arcsin2/3+arctg5/8)","output":"a = 6^(2.45) - (4^(5√9))^(-3/4)*tan(2) b = sin(6*arcsin(2/3) + arctan(5/8))"},{"instruction":"I have following code import React from 'react' import { useEffect, useState } from 'react' import Axios from 'axios'; import Dropdown from 'react-dropdown'; import {HiSwitchHorizontal} from 'react-icons/hi'; import 'react-dropdown/style.css'; import './currency.scss'; const CurrencyConverter = () => { const [info, setInfo] = useState([]); const [input, setInput] = useState(0); const [from,setFrom] = useState(\\"usd\\"); const [to, setTo] = useState(\\"inr\\"); const [options, setOptions] = useState([]); const [output, setOutput] = useState(0); useEffect(() => { Axios.get( 'https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/fawazahmed0/currency-api@1/latest/currencies/{from}.json\` ) .then((res) => { setInfo(res.data[from]); }) }, [info]) // Function to convert the currency function convert() { var rate =info[to]; setOutput(input *rate); } return ( <div>CurrencyConverter.component</div> ) } I have a problem with info[to] - I've got error \\"Element implicity has an 'any' type because of expression is not of type 'number' .

The results showed that the amount of hydrogen peroxide, lipid peroxidation, total nitrogen and activity of ferulic acid peroxidase, NADPH oxidase, nitrate reductase, pectin methyl esterase, cellulase, mannanase, xylanase and pectinase were significantly increased in inoculated samples treated with or without phytohormones. The highest activity of these enzymes was observed in A. brasilense- inoculated rice roots in auxin+gibberellin treatment. In the latter, the activity of phenylalanine ammonia lyase and wall ferulic acid peroxidase enzymes, the content of cell wall polysaccharide, lignin, and total phenolic compounds were the least, compared to controls and also with those samples which were inoculated with A. irakens. The results indicate an active role of the wall and its enzymes in allowing bacteria to enter the roots. Understanding this mechanism can improve the methods of inoculating bacteria into plants and increase crop efficiency, which will result in reduced use of chemical fertilizers and their destructive environmental effects.","output":"Overall, the study found that the presence of Azospirillum species, along with indole-3-acetic acid (IAA) and gibberellic acid (GA3) treatments, led to an increase in various enzyme activities, such as ferulic acid peroxidase, NADPH oxidase, nitrate reductase, pectin methyl esterase, cellulase, mannanase, xylanase, and pectinase, as well as the amount of hydrogen peroxide, lipid peroxidation, total nitrogen, cell wall polysaccharides, lignin, and total phenolic compounds in rice root cells. The highest activity of these enzymes was observed in rice roots inoculated with A. brasilense and treated with both IAA and GA3, indicating a synergistic effect between the bacterium and the phytohormones. Interestingly, the activity of phenylalanine ammonia lyase and wall ferulic acid peroxidase enzymes, as well as the content of cell wall polysaccharides, lignin, and total phenolic compounds, were lower in the A. brasilense-inoculated roots compared to the controls and the samples inoculated with A. irakens. This suggests that A. brasilense may have a more efficient mechanism for entering the roots and establishing a symbiotic relationship with the plant. Understanding the mechanisms involved in the interaction between Azospirillum species and rice root cell walls can have practical implications in improving the methods of inoculating bacteria into plants and increasing crop efficiency. This, in turn, can lead to a reduction in the use of chemical fertilizers and their negative environmental impacts."},{"instruction":"analyze sentiment of this review, the quality of review is determine as the more aspect and sentiment you can find, the higher quality, no matter how positive or negative the review is, each aspect found should be 1 point, if aspect having clearly description that will more 1 point, only output in english, in format like this + quality-of-review: number + original-review: string + original-review-language: string + english-translated-review: string For each aspects found in one review, show result as format like this, evidence should be a complete sentence,no need any other comments + aspect: 1 common aspect english key word - sentiment: english word - detail: string - original-evidence: only orginal review sentence - english-evidence: string reviews: Ürün fena değil kargo hızlı geldi ancak gümrükte napıyor lar bilmiyorum ama ufak bi kırık vardı üründe ancak çalışıyor ancak böyle şeylerin olmaması gerekiyor yinede ürün üflemesi aşırı yeterli değil ama bilgisayar ve klavye temizlemek için aldım umarım ilerleyen zamanlarda performansı azalmaz","output":"+ quality-of-review: 5 + original-review: \\"Ürün fena değil kargo hızlı geldi ancak gümrükte napıyor lar bilmiyorum ama ufak bi kırık vardı üründe ancak çalışıyor ancak böyle şeylerin olmaması gerekiyor yinede ürün üflemesi aşırı yeterli değil ama bilgisayar ve klavye temizlemek için aldım umarım ilerleyen zamanlarda performansı azalmaz\\" + original-review-language: Turkish + english-translated-review: \\"The product is not bad, the shipping was fast, but I don't know what the customs are doing there, there was a small crack in the product but it is still functioning.

Firstly, make sure she's in a comfortable position. Lay her down on her back with her knees bent. Natsuki: Okay, we've laid her down. What should we do next? Operator: Have someone nearby gather towels or blankets to keep the mother warm and to catch the baby once it's delivered. It's important to remember to stay calm, reassure her, and encourage deep, controlled breathing. Sayori: I have some blankets. We're doing our best to support Monika and keep her calm.

We’ll make sure both you and your baby are in good hands.” (As the paramedics attend to Monika, Natsuki, Yuri, and Sayori gather their things to accompany her to the hospital.) Natsuki: “Monika, everything will be okay. We’ll be right here by your side.” Yuri: “You’re incredibly strong, Monika. We’ll support you every step of the way.” Sayori: “You’re not alone in this, Monika. We love you, and we’re here for you.” (Monika manages a small smile through the pain, thankful for the unwavering support of her friends.

It’s been an exciting journey so far. Feeling all the tiny kicks and movements is a wonderful reminder of the little life growing inside.” Yuri: “It must be an incredible experience, Monika. Knowing that you’re nurturing a life and watching it develop.” Monika: “Absolutely, Yuri. It’s something I’ve always dreamed of, and now it’s finally happening. I feel blessed.” Sayori: “I’m so happy for you, Monika. I can’t wait to meet little Minika.” Monika: (smiles warmly) “Thank you, Sayori. I’m excited for you all to meet Minika too.

My curiosity didn’t stop at Germany. Conversations with and locals in Germany introduced me to the stories of Ukrainian refugees and their struggles that had been overlooked by mainstream media in China who demonizes Ukrainians while supporting the Russian invasion. Fueled by this knowledge and the desire to get get to know the truth surpassing media coverage, I yearned to explore the Ukrainian culture and understand the experiences of its people through an investigation on Ukrainian refugees in Warsaw, Poland this summer. While I was in China, I had heard stories about Ukrainians that painted them as villains, perpetuated by mainstream Chinese media, supporting Russia for their shared political ideologies and mutual cooperation in economic and military spheres. However, my curiosity led me to dig deeper and seek the truth for myself. During my time in Germany, conversations with locals opened my eyes to the struggles of Ukrainian refugees, a narrative often overlooked by Chinese media's biased portrayal. I vividly remember an encounter with Maria, a young Ukrainian refugee who shared with me her harrowing journey of fleeing her home country due to the conflict. Maria was one of the two students who had escaped from Ukraine with some of their families and were taken in by my school, Herman-Josef-College, after the war began. She described the immense fear and uncertainty she experienced while crossing the German border, with the hope of finding a better future for herself and her family.Empathy surged within me as I realized the injustice they were facing. Determined to understand their experiences firsthand, I made a decision to book a flight to Ukraine, eager to lend a helping hand to those in need. Two Ukrainian camps became my temporary home, where I volunteered to wash dishes and clean clothing. Through this, I hoped to bridge the gap between cultures and foster connections with the local people. I’ve met a pregnant Ukrainian woman travling back home to kyiv while interviewing people at Wasaw East Station. She was appreciative for what I was interviewing for as I showed her some of my questions and videos, but she did not consent to take a video interview, for she was afraid an honest answer might get her and her family into trouble back in Ukraine. So instead, she agreed to answer a few questions with out me actually filming her. As days turned into weeks, a bond began to form between myself and the Ukrainian community. Despite the language barrier, the locals warmly embraced me and eagerly shared their customs and traditions. One captivating custom they shared with me was the \\"Horilka\\", a traditional Ukrainian alcoholic beverage, similar to vodka. When Ukrainians want to express their friendship and hospitality, they often invite guests to share a shot of horilka together. This act symbolizes unity, trust, and the desire to bond on a deeper level. Additionally, giving or receiving a pysanka (a beautifully decorated Ukrainian Easter egg) is seen as a meaningful gesture of friendship and goodwill. It signifies the desire to share cultural traditions and express heartfelt wishes for happiness and prosperity.In return, I shared a piece of my own culture through traditional Chinese song, “Moon serenade”. Together, we sang traditional tunes that blended our worlds. Even though our communication was often hindered by broken English, our hearts found harmony through the universal language of music and shared experiences. In this newfound connection, I couldn't help but feel a sense of responsibility. While I had come to appreciate the warmth and kindness of the Ukrainian people, I knew that back in China, many still harbored misconceptions and prejudices. Determined to bridge this gap, I decided to use my experiences as a catalyst for change. Equipped with an iPhone 11 and a mission, I embarked on a series of interviews and videos, with individuals ranging from ages 16 to 55, aimed at humanizing Ukrainians for my Chinese audience. With questions centered around their personal journeys, aspirations, political opinions, and the future prospect they’ve pictured for themselves and their families, I captured their stories of resilience and the contributions they made. Through these heartfelt narratives, I vividly portrayed a people who had so much to offer, dispelling the myths and stereotypes that overshadowed their reputation. Over time, my videos gained traction, igniting discussions among Chinese citizens. Ignorance gave way to empathy, and there was a gradual shift in perceptions. It was a challenging endeavor, but one I was resolutely committed to. Empathy began to replace ignorance, and a shift in perceptions slowly took hold. It was an uphill battle, but one that I was determined to fight. Through my personal journey of understanding, I learned that cultural barriers can be shattered, and prejudices dismantled when individuals take it upon themselves to seek the truth. The Ukrainians, once branded as \\"bad,\\" had become beacons of resilience and kindness in my eyes. And through my efforts, I hoped to illuminate their true essence to a wider audience, reminding the world of the richness and diversity that different cultures bring.","output":"My curiosity about Ukrainian culture and the experiences of its people led me on a journey to investigate the lives of Ukrainian refugees in Warsaw, Poland.

My curiosity didn’t stop at Germany. Conversations with and locals in Germany introduced me to the stories of Ukrainian refugees and their struggles that had been overlooked by mainstream media in China who demonizes Ukrainians while supporting the Russian invasion. Fueled by this knowledge and the desire to get get to know the truth surpassing media coverage, I yearned to explore the Ukrainian culture and understand the experiences of its people through an investigation on Ukrainian refugees in Warsaw, Poland this summer. While I was in China, I had heard stories about Ukrainians that painted them as villains, perpetuated by mainstream Chinese media, supporting Russia for their shared political ideologies and mutual cooperation in economic and military spheres. However, my curiosity led me to dig deeper and seek the truth for myself. During my time in Germany, conversations with locals opened my eyes to the struggles of Ukrainian refugees, a narrative often overlooked by Chinese media's biased portrayal. I vividly remember an encounter with Maria, a young Ukrainian refugee who shared with me her harrowing journey of fleeing her home country due to the conflict. Maria was one of the two students who had escaped from Ukraine with some of their families and were taken in by my school, Herman-Josef-College, after the war began. She described the immense fear and uncertainty she experienced while crossing the German border, with the hope of finding a better future for herself and her family.Empathy surged within me as I realized the injustice they were facing. Determined to understand their experiences firsthand, I made a decision to book a flight to Ukraine, eager to lend a helping hand to those in need. Two Ukrainian camps became my temporary home, where I volunteered to wash dishes and clean clothing. Through this, I hoped to bridge the gap between cultures and foster connections with the local people. I’ve met a pregnant Ukrainian woman travling back home to kyiv while interviewing people at Wasaw East Station. She was appreciative for what I was interviewing for as I showed her some of my questions and videos, but she did not consent to take a video interview, for she was afraid an honest answer might get her and her family into trouble back in Ukraine. So instead, she agreed to answer a few questions with out me actually filming her. As days turned into weeks, a bond began to form between myself and the Ukrainian community. Despite the language barrier, the locals warmly embraced me and eagerly shared their customs and traditions. One captivating custom they shared with me was the \\"Horilka\\", a traditional Ukrainian alcoholic beverage, similar to vodka. When Ukrainians want to express their friendship and hospitality, they often invite guests to share a shot of horilka together. This act symbolizes unity, trust, and the desire to bond on a deeper level. Additionally, giving or receiving a pysanka (a beautifully decorated Ukrainian Easter egg) is seen as a meaningful gesture of friendship and goodwill. It signifies the desire to share cultural traditions and express heartfelt wishes for happiness and prosperity.In return, I shared a piece of my own culture through traditional Chinese song, “Moon serenade”. Together, we sang traditional tunes that blended our worlds. Even though our communication was often hindered by broken English, our hearts found harmony through the universal language of music and shared experiences. In this newfound connection, I couldn't help but feel a sense of responsibility. While I had come to appreciate the warmth and kindness of the Ukrainian people, I knew that back in China, many still harbored misconceptions and prejudices. Determined to bridge this gap, I decided to use my experiences as a catalyst for change. Equipped with an iPhone 11 and a mission, I embarked on a series of interviews and videos, with individuals ranging from ages 16 to 55, aimed at humanizing Ukrainians for my Chinese audience. With questions centered around their personal journeys, aspirations, political opinions, and the future prospect they’ve pictured for themselves and their families, I captured their stories of resilience and the contributions they made. Through these heartfelt narratives, I vividly portrayed a people who had so much to offer, dispelling the myths and stereotypes that overshadowed their reputation. Over time, my videos gained traction, igniting discussions among Chinese citizens. Ignorance gave way to empathy, and there was a gradual shift in perceptions. It was a challenging endeavor, but one I was resolutely committed to. Empathy began to replace ignorance, and a shift in perceptions slowly took hold. It was an uphill battle, but one that I was determined to fight. Through my personal journey of understanding, I learned that cultural barriers can be shattered, and prejudices dismantled when individuals take it upon themselves to seek the truth. The Ukrainians, once branded as \\"bad,\\" had become beacons of resilience and kindness in my eyes. And through my efforts, I hoped to illuminate their true essence to a wider audience, reminding the world of the richness and diversity that different cultures bring.","output":"My curiosity about Ukrainian culture and the experiences of Ukrainian refugees led me on a journey of discovery.

Here are some of the technical aspects they use: 1. Polymorphism: Malware authors use polymorphic code to change the structure and behavior of their malware with each infection. Polymorphism alters the file or code structure while preserving its functionality, making it difficult for signature-based antivirus programs to identify and detect the malware. 2. Encryption/Obfuscation: Malware developers use encryption and obfuscation techniques to hide the true nature of their malicious code. They encrypt the malware payload or obfuscate the code to make it harder for security systems to analyze or detect the malicious behavior. 3. Rootkit and Stealth Techniques: Rootkits are malware components designed to hide the presence of malware within the operating system. They often modify or replace system files, drivers, or kernel-level modules to evade detection. Rootkits can hook into system functions to intercept and alter the behavior of the operating system, making the malware invisible to security tools. 4. Anti-VM/Anti-Sandbox Techniques: Malware developers often employ techniques to detect if their code is running within a virtual machine (VM) or sandbox environment typically used for analysis and containment. By identifying such environments, malware can alter its behavior, delay execution, or even refuse to run, making it harder for security researchers to analyze the malware. 5. Code Injection/Cavity Infection: Some malware injects their code into legitimate processes or exploits certain vulnerabilities to hide themselves within seemingly harmless applications. This technique allows malware to run alongside legitimate processes, making it harder to detect. 6. Uncommon Storage Techniques: Malware can use uncommon storage techniques to hide their presence. For example, they might store themselves in little-used file extensions, alternate data streams, or manipulate the Master Boot Record (MBR) or other system areas where traditional security solutions may not scan. 7. Fileless Malware: Fileless malware does not typically reside as files on disk. These malware types reside directly in memory or use legitimate tools and processes to execute their malicious activities. Since they do not involve file-based interactions, traditional file-scanning antivirus solutions may struggle to detect them. It's crucial to note that as malware developers evolve, so do security defenses. Security providers strive to develop advanced techniques like behavior-based analysis, machine learning, heuristics, and threat intelligence to detect and counter evolving malware threats."},{"instruction":"give me more of the very modern methods","output":"Certainly! Here are some additional modern methods employed by malware developers to make their malware undetectable: 1. Fileless Persistence: Malware can leverage advanced techniques, such as PowerShell or Windows Management Instrumentation (WMI), to achieve persistence without leaving traditional file traces. By operating solely in memory or using legitimate system tools, fileless malware can remain undetected by traditional file-based scanning. 2. Process Hollowing: This technique involves creating a legitimate process in a suspended state and then replacing its code with malicious code. The malware runs within the context of the legitimate process, evading detection as it appears to be a trusted application. 3. Living Off the Land: Malware developers increasingly utilize legitimate system utilities, scripting languages (like PowerShell), or trusted applications to carry out malicious activities. By leveraging trusted tools and processes, malware becomes harder to detect as it blends in with normal system behavior. 4. Evading Dynamic Analysis: Malware can employ various techniques to evade dynamic analysis environments, where the malware's behavior is monitored. This includes detecting mouse movements, system clock, virtualized hardware, or observing dynamic analysis tools' behavior itself. Once identified, the malware can alter its behavior or lie dormant to prevent detection. 5. Code Injection into Trusted Processes: Malware can inject its code into trusted processes that run with higher privileges, such as system processes or security-related applications. By piggybacking on trusted processes, malware can avoid detection and gain elevated privileges. 6. Reflective DLL Injection: This technique allows malware to load a DLL into a process's memory without relying on traditional methods like loading DLL files from disk. The malware can remain memory-resident, making it harder for security solutions to detect the malicious DLL. 7. Exploiting Zero-Day Vulnerabilities: Malware developers actively search for and exploit unknown vulnerabilities (zero-days) in software or operating systems. By utilizing these undisclosed vulnerabilities, malware can bypass security mechanisms and remain undetectable until the vulnerability is discovered and patched. It's important to note that as new techniques emerge, security researchers and vendors continually update their tools and technologies to combat these evolving threats."},{"instruction":"say this in one sentence:My curiosity didn’t stop at Germany.

Here are a few ideas on how to implement disabilities and their potential gameplay effects: 1. Visual Disabilities: - Blindness: Characters who are blind may have an enhanced sense of hearing and be able to perceive the environment through sound cues. They could benefit from auditory cues for navigation and may have unique dialogue interactions. - Color blindness: Depending on the severity, players could experience a visually different game world with altered color schemes, requiring them to rely on other visual cues for navigation or quest completion. 2. Mobility Disabilities: - Limb impairment: A character with a missing limb may have limited combat abilities but gain special skills or equipment to compensate (e.g., a one-handed character could equip a shield on the remaining arm for added defense). - Wheelchair: A character could have decreased mobility but enhanced strategic advantages, such as weapon range or heightened defense while seated in the wheelchair. 3. Hearing Disabilities: - Deafness: Characters who are deaf may have heightened visual perception or an ability to sense vibrations from footsteps or within the environment. They could rely on visual cues for identifying threats or solving puzzles. 4. Mental Disabilities: - Autism or ADHD: Characters with these conditions may have a heightened ability to focus on specific tasks or detect hidden details, making them more effective in specific situations. - Phobias or anxiety disorders: Characters could experience specific gameplay challenges when encountering triggering elements. For example, a character with arachnophobia may have penalties in confronting spider-type enemies. When implementing disabilities, it's important to consider a few things: - Provide players the choice to opt-in or opt-out of disabilities during character creation, as not all players may want to play with these challenges. - Disabilities should not necessarily hinder the overall gameplay experience but introduce unique features, advantages, or drawbacks to create balance. - Design quests and challenges that cater to diverse abilities, allowing disabled characters to contribute positively to the game world. Remember, the aim is not to stigmatize disability but to highlight the diverse abilities people may possess, making the game more inclusive and thought-provoking."},{"instruction":"Further detail on number 4.","output":"Certainly!

Familiarize yourself with the FedRAMP requirements: Understand the FedRAMP security controls and requirements outlined in the FedRAMP Security Assessment Framework (SAF) and related documents. The SAF provides the guidelines for implementing and assessing security controls. 2. Determine your target authorization level: Identify the appropriate impact level (low, moderate, or high) of FedRAMP authorization required for your system. The impact level is based on the potential impact to the confidentiality, integrity, and availability of data handled by the system. 3. Implement NIST SP 800-53 controls: Implement the security controls outlined in the National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) Special Publication (SP) 800-53, which forms the basis of FedRAMP security requirements. These controls cover various aspects of security, including access control, incident response, audit and accountability, and system and information integrity, among others. 4. Develop a System Security Plan (SSP): Create an SSP that documents how your system complies with the FedRAMP security controls. The SSP should depict the controls implemented, responsibilities assigned, and a detailed description of your system architecture. 5. Engage a Third-Party Assessment Organization (3PAO): Seek the services of a 3PAO, an independent entity authorized to assess your system's compliance with FedRAMP requirements. The 3PAO will conduct a thorough assessment of your system and provide a security assessment report. 6. Conduct a system assessment: Perform a comprehensive assessment of your system based on FedRAMP requirements and the additional scrutiny applied by the 3PAO. This evaluation may involve vulnerability scans, penetration testing, and other security assessments. 7. Remediate findings: Address any vulnerabilities and weaknesses identified during the system assessment. Implement appropriate remediation measures and enhance security controls to align with FedRAMP requirements. 8. Develop a Plan of Action and Milestones (POA&M): Prepare a POA&M document that outlines any outstanding security gaps and identifies the actions, timelines, and responsible parties for addressing those gaps. 9. Submit an initial package for review: Submit the completed SSP, security assessment report, and other required documents to the FedRAMP Program Management Office (PMO) for initial review. This process ensures that your system meets the necessary prerequisites for undergoing the formal authorization process. 10. Initiate the authorization process: Once your initial package is considered acceptable, initiate the formal authorization process. This typically involves preparing and submitting a traditional authorization package, including the SSP, POA&M, security assessment report, and other required artifacts, for review by the FedRAMP PMO and the sponsoring agency. Following these initial steps will set you on the path towards achieving FedRAMP certification. However, note that the FedRAMP process may have additional layers and specific requirements depending on the cloud service provider (CSP) and the sponsoring agency. It is crucial to refer to the FedRAMP documentation, engage the appropriate resources, and work collaboratively with your 3PAO and the FedRAMP PMO throughout the entire process."},{"instruction":"أكتب لي قصة عن القطة والفار تكون مضحكة","output":"كانت هناك قطة مشاغبة تدعى مياو. كانت تعيش في منزل صغير في قرية هادئة. لكنها كانت تشعر بالملل وتبحث عن المرح في كل مكان. في يوم من الأيام، كانت مياو تتجول في الحديقة الخلفية للمنزل، عندما شاهدت فاراً صغيراً يشبهها في الشقاوة. اسم هذا الفار كان فيلكس وكان يعيش في مخبأ صغير تحت الحديقة. مرحبًا بك فيلكس، قالت مياو بابتسامة واسعة. رحب فيلكس بمياو وقررا أن يكونا أفضل أصدقاء. قضوا الكثير من الوقت معًا، يلعبون ويسبحون في بركة الماء المحلية. كانا يصنعان مغامرات لا نهاية لها ويختبران حدودهما. في يومٍ ما، خطرت فكرة غريبة في ذهن فيلكس. قال لمياو: \\"لماذا لا نذهب إلى المدينة المجاورة ونستكشفها؟ ستكون مغامرة ممتعة!\\" رغم أنها كانت تشعر بالقلق قليلاً، إلا أن مياو وافقت على تلك الفكرة. انتشر الخبر بين الحيوانات في المدينة حول قدوم مياو وفيلكس. اجتمع الجميع في الشوارع للقاءهما ومشاهدة ما ستفعله تلك الثنائية المضحكة. وصل مياو وفيلكس إلى الشوارع المزدحمة وعجزوا عن تصديق كمية الضوضاء والحركة التي رأوها. عندها قرر فيلكس أن يلعب مزحة على مياو. قال لها: \\"مياو، هناك أشياء لذيذة للغاية في الخضروات على الأرصفة. لماذا لا تجربينها؟\\" وبندبة هادئة، نظرت مياو إلى الخضروات وقررت أنها تستحق المغامرة. تقدمت مياو بخطوات حذرة نحو الخضروات المنسدلة على الأرصفة. لكن يا لها من كوميديا! فقد وجدت نفسها وسط قواطع المرور المزدحمة والسيارات المتسابقة. صوب فيلكس وهو يضحك بشدة على جنب وجنب مع الحيوانات المحلية الأخرى. انفعلت مياو وقالت: \\"فيلكس! ماذا فعلت؟!\\" استمر فيلكس في الضحك وبدأت حركة المرور تتباطأ حيث أصيب السائقون بالذهول من مشهد القطة والفأر وهما يتسابقان في الشوارع. سرعان ما قررت مياو الانضمام إلى فيلكس في مزحته، فقبضت على فأر صغير وبدأت تلاحقه في الشوارع. بدأت الناس يركضون في جميع الاتجاهات ويصرخون. كان المشهد هلعًا وفوضى تامة. في النهاية، توقفت مياو وفيلكس في وسط الشارع ونظرا إلى بعضهما البعض بابتسامة واسعة. فوجئوا بتورطهما بالمزحة إلى هذا الحد، وقررا أنهما يجب أن يتوقفا عن المزح واللعب بالناس. عادت مياو وفيلكس إلى بيوتهما، وكانت عبراتهما تمزج بين السعادة والأسف في آن واحد. قرروا أن يكونا أصدقاءً حقيقيين وأنهما لن يعوقا حياة الآخرين بالمزح والمغامرات المجنونة. ومنذ ذلك الحين، عاشا حياة هادئة وسعيدة في قريتهما معًا، مستمتعين باللعب والمرح دون إحداث فوضى."},{"instruction":"improve and make it more academic: First, according to Articles 2 and 11 of the Charter of Commission for Studying Constitutional Government, “Except for legal codes and important matters that shall be decided by the Political Advisory Council, the other documents to be examined and compiled shall be submitted to the princes and grand ministers of the Grand Council for review and approval for implementation” (Grand Secretariat, 1979, p. 51).

If allowed to usurp the power of making and interpreting regulatory documents, the Commission for Studying Constitutional Government, as the interpreter of controversies, would inevitably be biased in favor of the government (the Grand Council and the ministries) and against the Political Advisory Council if the two would run into conflicts in the future. “In the 33rd year of Guangxu’s reign (AD 1907), the Commission for Studying Constitutional Government was set up as a purely legislative body to draft constitutional codes, but still repeatedly encroached on the authority of the Political Advisory Council after the latter’s establishment. Therefore, we have to delineate the legislative scope of the Political Advisory Council and draw a clear line of authority with the Commission. Before the establishment of the Political Advisory Council, the Commission was led by the Grand Council and held the supreme executive power, compiling legal codes for one thing and issuing executive sanctions for another” (Li, 2011, p. 233).","output":"First, as outlined in Articles 2 and 11 of the Charter of Commission for Studying Constitutional Government, the submission and approval process for examining and compiling documents is stipulated. Legal codes and significant matters are to be decided by the Political Advisory Council, while the remaining documents are to be reviewed and approved by the princes and grand ministers of the Grand Council for implementation (Grand Secretariat, 1979, p. 51). However, the term \\"important matters\\" lacks clarity, creating a potential loophole for the Commission for Studying Constitutional Government and Grand Councilors to exercise unauthorized power in the absence of clear guidelines. Furthermore, it is crucial to recognize that the Commission for Studying Constitutional Government assumes a dual role as both a legislator and an attachment to the supreme executive organ, the Grand Council. This integration of legislative and executive functions raises concerns about its ability to impartially interpret regulatory documents if conflicts were to arise between the government (comprising the Grand Council and ministries) and the Political Advisory Council. Such a scenario would inevitably result in biased interpretations in favor of the government and against the Political Advisory Council. In the year 1907, during the 33rd year of Guangxu's reign, the Commission for Studying Constitutional Government was established as a purely legislative body responsible for drafting constitutional codes. However, it repeatedly infringed upon the authority of the Political Advisory Council following the latter's establishment. Hence, it is imperative to define the legislative scope of the Political Advisory Council and establish a clear division of authority between the Council and the Commission. Prior to the establishment of the Political Advisory Council, the Commission, led by the Grand Council, held supreme executive power. Its responsibilities encompassed compiling legal codes and issuing executive sanctions (Li, 2011, p. 233)."},{"instruction":"What is Cubism?

Please generate a detailed setting for Uracis based on the following description, modeled after Pyrimis' character setting format. (300 words minimum.) Uracis is Thymis's father and Pyrimis's maternal grandfather. As an authoritative scientist for the Aether Foundation, he devotes himself to the study of alien Pokémon such as Ultra Beasts. When he is shocked to learn that his daughter Thymis is in love with a Deoxys that has taken the form of a human, he is not in favor of the romance. But Cytos, having removed his disguise, reveals his original purpose for coming to Earth and informs Uracis of the Deoxys' attempts to invade the planet, and Uracis, believing that his daughter's love must be destiny, agrees to the bizarre love affair. After Thymis was infected with an alien virus and had to live in a special hibernation capsule in Aether Paradise to save her life, and Cytos left the planet, Uracis took on the responsibility of caring for his granddaughter, Pyrimis, while at the same time stepping up his research on the Deoxys to try to find traces of an invasion of Earth by the Deoxys.

When his daughter Thymis fell in love with Cytos, a Deoxys in human form, Uracis initially struggled to accept their relationship.

Here are some reasons why mushrooms deserve recognition and admiration: 1. Ecological Importance: Mushrooms play a crucial role in the ecosystem as they are decomposers, breaking down organic matter such as dead plants and animals. They aid in nutrient cycling, releasing essential elements back into the soil, benefiting other plants and animals. Without mushrooms, the natural balance of ecosystems would be disrupted. 2. Medicinal Properties: Many mushrooms possess medicinal properties that have been used for centuries. For instance, the reishi mushroom has been used in traditional Chinese medicine to boost the immune system and reduce stress. Other mushrooms, like the shiitake or lion's mane, have been associated with various health benefits, such as reducing inflammation or improving cognitive function. 3. Culinary Delights: Mushrooms offer a vast array of textures, flavors, and culinary possibilities. From the earthy cremini to the delicate oyster mushroom, they add depth and richness to dishes. Mushrooms are widely used in various cuisines around the world, contributing to diverse and satisfying culinary experiences. 4. Biodiversity: Mushrooms showcase incredible diversity, with over 10,000 different known species. Each species possesses unique characteristics, ranging from size and color to habitat and spore dispersal methods. They come in a stunning variety of shapes and forms, from delicate and lacy to bold and vibrant, making them an endless source of fascination for nature enthusiasts. 5. Mycoremediation: Mushrooms have the ability to remove and break down toxins from the environment, making them powerful tools for environmental cleanup. This process, known as mycoremediation, has been used to clean up oil spills, remove heavy metals, and break down pollutants. Their natural ability to degrade harmful substances offers a sustainable and environmentally friendly approach to remediate polluted areas. 6. Spiritual and Cultural Significance: Mushrooms have held a special place in various cultures and spiritual practices throughout history. They have been used in religious rituals as sacraments, for spiritual enlightenment, and as symbols of rebirth and transformation. They continue to be revered and respected by many cultures today. In conclusion, mushrooms are not just peculiar fungi but are essential organisms that contribute to the health of ecosystems, offer medicinal benefits, delight our taste buds, showcase remarkable biodiversity, aid in environmental cleanup, and hold cultural and spiritual significance. It is important to appreciate and protect these fascinating organisms for their beauty and the significant roles they play in the natural world."},{"instruction":"paraphrase if the fees of the language courses are changed the vendor should informed the client prior to registration.","output":"The client should be notified in advance by the vendor if there are any changes to the fees for the language courses before they register."},{"instruction":"Does Quebec's consumer protection laws that prevent credit card surchages allow passing on charges to buy cryptocurrency with which to pay for a service online?","output":"I am an AI language model and can provide general information, but I am not a legal expert.

However, specific legal advice should be sought to fully understand the implications, as there may be other relevant factors to consider. Quebec's anti-surcharge law prohibits merchants from imposing additional fees or surcharges on customers who use credit cards as a method of payment. This law primarily applies to transactions within Quebec. When it comes to online businesses, the jurisdiction can become less clear-cut. If a business operates solely online, it is typically subject to federal regulations. However, the province where the transaction occurs may still have a say in certain matters, such as consumer protection. In the case of a business registered federally but the business owner residing in Quebec, it is possible that both federal and provincial regulations may apply. It would be necessary to consider the specific circumstances, the nature of the business, and the parties involved to determine the extent to which Quebec's anti-surcharge laws apply. To ensure compliance with all applicable laws and regulations, it is advisable to consult with a lawyer or legal professional with expertise in consumer protection and business regulations in Quebec.

This section states that merchants in Quebec are not allowed to charge consumers additional fees or surcharges for using credit cards as a method of payment.

Start with vocabulary lists: Begin by creating a list of words relevant to your writing topic or subject area. This will serve as your starting point and provide you with a clear set of words to focus on. 2. Break words down: When encountering a new word, break it down into smaller parts. Analyze its root, prefixes, and suffixes to understand its meaning and improve your chances of retention. 3. Use context clues: Pay close attention to the context in which words are used. If you come across an unfamiliar word while reading, try to guess its meaning based on the surrounding sentences. This will help you remember the word and use it correctly in your own writing. 4. Create flashcards: Write the word on one side of the flashcard and its definition or a sample sentence on the other. Review these flashcards regularly, testing yourself on the meanings of the words. 5. Associate words with visuals: Use imagery or mental pictures to associate words with their meanings. Creating visual cues can make it easier for your brain to recall the word when needed. 6. Practice writing sentences: Write sentences using the words you are trying to memorize. This will reinforce your understanding of their usage and help you commit them to memory. 7. Read extensively: Reading regularly exposes you to a wide range of vocabulary. Expose yourself to a diverse range of books, articles, and other written materials. The more you encounter words in their natural context, the more likely you are to remember and use them in your own writing. 8. Engage in active learning: Actively engage with the words you are trying to memorize by discussing them, using them in conversations, or writing about them. Actively using the words will reinforce your understanding and boost your memory of them. 9. Practice writing exercises: Regularly practice different writing exercises, such as freewriting, journaling, or essay writing. These activities will provide you with opportunities to apply the words you have learned and reinforce your memory of them. 10.

On average, a single small-scale residential wind turbine with a capacity of around 5 kilowatts (kW) can generate roughly 10,000 to 16,000 kilowatt-hours (kWh) of electricity annually, depending on wind conditions. This translates to an average daily power output of approximately 27 to 44 kWh. To put this into perspective, the U.S. Energy Information Administration estimates that the average American household consumes around 10,649 kWh per year, or roughly 29 kWh per day. However, it's important to note that wind turbines do not constantly produce their maximum rated capacity. Their actual output varies depending on wind speeds and other meteorological conditions. Additionally, the power requirements of homes can greatly differ based on factors such as size, energy-efficient appliances, insulation, and individual energy consumption habits. Therefore, to determine the exact average power needed from a wind generator to run homes' daily use, a comprehensive analysis of the specific context and energy requirements of the homes in question would be necessary."},{"instruction":"Present your understanding of (at least) 1 of brisbane city councils landscape architecture departments definition of a ‘project brief’.","output":"One definition of a project brief provided by Brisbane City Council's Landscape Architecture department is a written document that outlines the scope, goals, and requirements of a specific project.

While D&C can offer benefits such as streamlined communication and faster project completion, there are also drawbacks to consider: 1. Limited Design Input: In a D&C project, the design is often driven by the contractor, rather than an independent designer or architect. This can result in limited design input from the client or a lack of diverse perspectives, potentially leading to a less innovative or tailored design solution. 2. Potential Conflict of Interest: Since the same entity is responsible for both the design and construction phases, there is a possibility of a conflict of interest. The contractor may prioritize cost-saving measures during the design phase, potentially compromising the quality, functionality, or long-term viability of the design. 3. Reduced Control and Flexibility: With a D&C approach, the client has fewer opportunities for direct control and involvement in the design process. They may have limited ability to make changes or revisions once the design is finalized, potentially leading to a less satisfactory outcome if their needs or preferences evolve during the project. 4. Limited Competitive Bidding: In a D&C procurement method, the client typically selects a single contractor, which means there is less competition between different design firms or contractors. This reduced competition can limit the number of design options presented and potentially lead to less favorable pricing or design outcomes for the client. 5. Lack of Accountability: In a D&C project, it can be challenging to assign responsibility for any design errors or construction defects since the same entity is responsible for both aspects. This can make it more difficult to seek recourse or hold parties accountable for any design or construction issues that arise during or after the project. 6. Potential Cost Overruns: While D&C projects may offer cost savings by streamlining the design and construction processes, there is a risk of cost overruns. If the design is not thoroughly developed or if unforeseen issues arise during construction, additional costs may be incurred, potentially exceeding the initial budget. It's important to note that the disadvantages of design and construct can vary based on project-specific factors and the capabilities and expertise of the chosen contractor. Implementing appropriate contractual provisions, thorough project oversight, and clear communication can help mitigate some of these drawbacks."},{"instruction":"C:Usersharold.nobleDocumentsappsi2ms-analytics>git push origin fatal: The current branch feature/HJN/iaciss-1672 has no upstream branch.

Авторы предлагают использовать алгоритмическую торговую стратегию, основанную на получении небольших прибылей за короткий промежуток времени. Основная идея состоит в том, чтобы выйти из сделки, как только достигнута небольшая прибыль, вместо того, чтобы ожидать большей прибыли. Алгоритм вычисляет целевую прибыль, при которой сделка будет закрыта. Эта целевая прибыль обычно является процентом от начальной стоимости актива или некоторым фиксированным значением. Когда актив достигает этой целевой прибыли, сделка закрывается автоматически. Преимущество такого подхода заключается в том, что он позволяет зарабатывать деньги на малых колебаниях рынка, не ожидая значительных движений цен. Это также позволяет снизить риск, поскольку сделки закрываются быстро, а потенциальные убытки ограничены. Благодаря повторяемости таких операций и использованию автоматической торговой стратегии, можно накапливать прибыль со временем. Аутсайдеры сторона изложена в отдельной главе, где представлены подходы к выявлению активов, подверженных отрицательным новостям и падению цен. Здесь предложено использовать модель машинного обучения для определения таких активов и организации шорт-позиций на них, чтобы заработать на их дальнейшем падении цен. В целом, принцип работы, предложенный в главе, заключается в использовании малых колебаний рынка для получения небольшой, но стабильной прибыли, а также в определении активов, которые подвержены негативным факторам и могут быть использованы для получения дополнительных доходов."},{"instruction":"how can I manipulate strings in vb.net I want to add some charactiers to a string or remove them and so on what are the main methods to do that","output":"In VB.NET, you can manipulate strings using various string manipulation methods and functions. Here are some of the main methods you can use: 1. Concatenation (+ operator): You can use the (+) operator to concatenate two or more strings together. For example, \`\`\`vb.net Dim str1 As String = \\"Hello\\" Dim str2 As String = \\"World\\" Dim result As String = str1 + \\" \\" + str2 ' result will be \\"Hello World\\" \`\`\` 2. String Interpolation: You can use string interpolation to embed expressions or variables directly into a string. For example, \`\`\`vb.net Dim name As String = \\"John\\" Dim greeting As String = \\"Hello, {name}\\" ' greeting will be \\"Hello, John\\" \`\`\` 3. Substring(): This method allows you to extract a portion of a string based on the start index and length. For example, \`\`\`vb.net Dim str As String = \\"Hello World\\" Dim subStr As String = str.Substring(6, 5) ' subStr will be \\"World\\" \`\`\` 4. Replace(): This method replaces occurrences of a specified character or substring within a string with another character or substring. For example, \`\`\`vb.net Dim str As String = \\"Hello World\\" Dim newStr As String = str.Replace(\\"World\\", \\"Stack\\") ' newStr will be \\"Hello Stack\\" \`\`\` 5. Trim(): This method removes leading and trailing white spaces from a string. For example, \`\`\`vb.net Dim str As String = \\" Hello World \\" Dim trimmedStr As String = str.Trim() ' trimmedStr will be \\"Hello World\\" \`\`\` 6. ToUpper() and ToLower(): These methods convert the string to uppercase or lowercase, respectively. For example, \`\`\`vb.net Dim str As String = \\"Hello World\\" Dim upperStr As String = str.ToUpper() ' upperStr will be \\"HELLO WORLD\\" Dim lowerStr As String = str.ToLower() ' lowerStr will be \\"hello world\\" \`\`\` These are just a few examples of the string manipulation methods available in VB.NET.

A study by Li (2017) found that Chinese non-English majors tend to have positive self-perception of their reading ability, which contributes to their successful comprehension. Indicator 2: \\"I am confident in my ability to read challenging texts.\\" Mean Value: 2.44 (Disagree) This indicator ranked ninth, indicating that the respondents have a lower level of confidence in their ability to read challenging texts. This finding seems to be in conflict with the previous result, where the majority of respondents agreed that they were confident in their ability to understand what they read. However, previous research supports this finding. A study by Zhu et al. (2016) found that Chinese non-English majors face challenges when dealing with academic and technical language, which negatively affects their self-efficacy in reading comprehension of challenging texts. Indicator 3: \\"I am confident in my ability to use context clues to understand difficult words.\\" Mean Value: 2.81 (Agree) This indicator ranked second, indicating that the respondents generally have confidence in their ability to use context clues to understand difficult words. This finding aligns with previous research on the importance of context clues in reading comprehension. A study by Wang and Fang (2018) highlighted the significance of context clues in enhancing word comprehension among non-English majors. Indicator 7: \\"I am confident in my ability to understand technical jargon and academic language.\\" Mean Value: 2.47 (Disagree) This indicator ranked eighth, indicating that the respondents have a lower level of confidence in their ability to understand technical jargon and academic language. This result supports previous research findings on the difficulties faced by non-English majors in understanding specialized language. A study by Wu (2015) emphasized the need for targeted instruction to improve non-English majors' comprehension of technical jargon. Indicator 8: \\"I think I can apply my reading skills to different disciplines.\\" Mean Value: 2.73 (Agree) This indicator ranked fourth, indicating that the respondents generally believe they can apply their reading skills to different disciplines. This finding aligns with previous research emphasizing the transferability of reading skills across disciplines. A study by Zhang (2016) highlighted the importance of developing students' ability to transfer reading skills to various academic contexts. Indicator 9: \\"I am confident in my ability to read quickly and efficiently.\\" Mean Value: 2.62 (Agree) This indicator ranked sixth, indicating that the respondents have a moderate level of confidence in their ability to read quickly and efficiently. This finding supports previous research on the need to enhance reading fluency among non-English majors. A study by Liang et al. (2014) emphasized the importance of improving reading speed and efficiency to enhance comprehension. Interpretation: The interpretation of the data suggests that the majority of Chinese non-English majors have confidence in their ability to understand what they read and use context clues to comprehend difficult words. However, they have lower levels of confidence in their ability to read challenging texts, understand technical jargon and academic language, and read quickly and efficiently. These findings are consistent with previous research on the challenges faced by non-English majors in specific areas of reading comprehension. The conflicting result between the high level of confidence in understanding what is read and the low level of confidence in reading challenging texts can be justified by considering the nature of the Chinese educational system. Previous research by Cheng et al. (2017) highlighted that the Chinese education system places significant emphasis on rote memorization and focused attention on exam-oriented learning, which may lead to a discrepancy between self-perception and actual proficiency in some reading tasks. Therefore, while the respondents may feel confident in general reading comprehension, they may struggle with more complex texts due to the lack of exposure and training in dealing with academic and technical language. In conclusion, the data presented in Table 2 provides insights into the self-efficacy of Chinese non-English majors in various aspects of reading comprehension monitoring. While they generally have confidence in their overall reading comprehension ability and the use of context clues, they exhibit lower levels of confidence in reading challenging texts, understanding technical jargon and academic language, and reading quickly and efficiently. These findings are consistent with previous research and suggest the need for targeted instruction and support to enhance non-English majors' self-efficacy in specific areas of reading comprehension.

Similarly, a study by Zhang (2016) highlighted the importance of explicit vocabulary instruction for non-English majors' comprehension of academic language. Indicator 2: \\"I am confident in my ability to read challenging texts.\\" Mean Value: 2.44 (Disagree) This indicator ranked ninth, indicating that the respondents have a lower level of confidence in their ability to read challenging texts. This finding is consistent with previous research on the difficulties faced by non-English majors in comprehending complex texts. A study by Zhang and Zhang (2015) highlighted the need for explicit reading instruction targeted at higher-level reading skills to improve non-English majors' comprehension of challenging texts. Indicator 9: \\"I am confident in my ability to read quickly and efficiently.\\" Mean Value: 2.62 (Agree) This indicator ranked sixth, indicating that the respondents have a moderate level of confidence in their ability to read quickly and efficiently.

Interpretation: The interpretation of the data suggests that the majority of Chinese non-English majors have confidence in their ability to understand what they read and use context clues to comprehend difficult words. They also exhibit confidence in accurately assessing their level of comprehension while reading. However, they have lower levels of confidence in understanding technical jargon and academic language, reading challenging texts, and reading quickly and efficiently. The discrepancy between the high level of confidence in understanding what is read and the lower levels of confidence in understanding technical jargon and academic language as well as reading challenging texts can be attributed to the specific nature of these types of texts. Technical jargon and academic language often contain specialized vocabulary and complex linguistic structures that require additional training and exposure to fully comprehend. The lower levels of confidence suggest that non-English majors may lack the necessary knowledge and skills in these areas, which is consistent with previous research on the challenges faced in understanding such texts. Additionally, reading challenging texts requires higher-level reading skills, such as inferencing and critical thinking. Non-English majors may have limited experience in engaging with texts that require these advanced skills, leading to a lower level of confidence. Previous research has highlighted the need for targeted instruction and explicit reading strategies to improve non-English majors' ability to comprehend challenging texts. In conclusion, the data presented in Table 2 provides insights into the self-efficacy of Chinese non-English majors in various aspects of reading comprehension monitoring. While they generally have confidence in their overall reading comprehension ability and the use of context clues, they exhibit lower levels of confidence in understanding technical jargon and academic language, reading challenging texts, and reading quickly and efficiently.

Elizabeth had always been a vivacious and ambitious individual, but an unfortunate accident had left her confined to a wheelchair. Despite her disability, she refused to let it define her, and instead, she sought out ways to embrace her true potential. Little did she know that her life was about to take a miraculous turn, leading her on a journey of self-discovery beyond her wildest dreams. One sunny morning, while Elizabeth sat in her wheelchair outside a local museum, marveling at the sculptures and artwork within, an overwhelming sensation washed over her. Seemingly out of nowhere, she felt an irresistible urge to peel the skin from her own body. Initially, she was terrified by such an eerie thought, but in the depths of her soul, an indescribable yearning urged her to explore this peculiar phenomenon further. Unbeknownst to her, Elizabeth's body housed an extraordinary ability—a unique power passed down through generations of her family. As she surrendered to the inexplicable urge, a process more extraordinary than anything imaginable began to unfold. Her skin began to shed, peeling away layer by layer, revealing a radiant, luminous energy underneath. Elizabeth's shedding continued for several agonizing hours, each moment both excruciating and exhilarating. The discarded layers became an ethereal spectacle, resembling delicate, iridescent wings fluttering in the wind, each shedding piece carrying away the physical limitations of her past. As she shed the final layer, an intense light surrounded her, rendering her invisible to the eyes of ordinary people. Elizabeth was transformed. From the ashes of her skin, she emerged as Tracer, an embodiment of light and boundless energy. No longer confined to her wheelchair, she now possessed the ability to move at unmatched speed, darting around like a flash of lightning, leaving a trail of brilliant luminosity wherever she went. As Tracer embarked on her newfound journey, she discovered that her abilities extended far beyond merely augmented mobility. She could bend time and space, rendering herself virtually uncatchable by anyone who dared to cross her path. The entire city became her playground, as she used her gifts to bring joy and inspiration to those in need. Tracer's tale spread like wildfire, capturing the imaginations of people far and wide. Admirers would flock to see her swift movements, their eyes shining with wonderment and hope. Her radiant presence, both ethereal and empowering, inspired a new generation to embrace their true selves, reminding them that their disabilities or limitations need not define them. In time, Tracer's true identity became a legend whispered among those who yearned to break free from their own constraints. Elizabeth, in her newfound form, dedicated herself to spreading her message of self-discovery and resilience, symbolizing the endless possibilities that lay within each person. And so, the story of the woman in the wheelchair who shed her skin and became Tracer forever engraved itself into the annals of London's history. Through her remarkable transformation, Elizabeth reminded us that sometimes, it is in our darkest moments that we uncover the light within ourselves to illuminate the world around us."},{"instruction":"以“新征程 新使命”为主题，准备8分钟发言，谈谈入校后的未来规划","output":"尊敬的老师、亲爱的同学们： 大家好！我很荣幸能够站在这里，与大家一同分享我的未来规划。作为即将入校的新生，我们即将步入一段新的征程，迎来新的使命。今天，我想谈谈我对入校后的未来规划。 首先，入校后的未来规划需要明确目标和方向。我们要有一个明确的目标，明白自己为什么要来到这所学校，究竟想要成为怎样的人。从个人发展的角度来看，我希望我可以通过入校学习，在专业知识上得到更多的提升和拓展，为自己的未来奠定扎实的基础，做好自己的未来职业规划。 接下来，入校后的未来规划需要全面发展。大学是一个人生中最重要的阶段之一，这是我们接触到各种知识、人际关系、团队合作的重要时刻。因此，我希望能够充分利用大学的资源，参与到各种学术、体育、文化艺术活动中去，培养自己的兴趣爱好，锻炼自己的综合素质，成为一个全面发展的人。 此外，入校后的未来规划需要注重实践经验。理论学习固然重要，但只有将所学应用于实践中，才能真正发挥其价值。我希望能够参与各种实践活动，实习、实训、社会实践等等，争取更多的实践机会，提升自己在实践中的能力和经验，学以致用，为将来的工作做好准备。 最后，入校后的未来规划需要注重社会责任。大学是培养社会栋梁之才的摇篮，我们应该努力成为一个有社会责任感的人。在学习之余，我希望能够参与到各种公益活动中去，为社会做出一份自己的贡献。同时，我还希望能够培养和锻炼自己的领导能力，为身边的同学提供帮助和支持，成为大家的榜样和引领者。 总而言之，入校后的未来规划需要我们明确目标，全面发展，注重实践经验和社会责任。我们要以积极的心态，充满激情地投入到大学的学习和生活中去。我们要发扬努力拼搏的精神，追求卓越，成为学校和社会中的栋梁之才。 最后，我相信只要我们坚持不懈地努力，始终保持对未来的执着追求，我们一定能够在大学生活中获得丰富的收获和成功。谢谢大家！"},{"instruction":"Demande d’aide pour rédiger une réponse à la suite d’un email reçu par cette interlocutrice. “Bonjour ****, Nous avons bien reçu votre courrier du 5 septembre 2023 concernant votre report de rendez-vous du 19/09 chez le D****.

Draw AM and extend it to meet a line through N parallel to BC at point P. 2. **Properties of Midpoints and Parallel Lines**: Line NP is parallel to side BC and, since N is the midpoint of AC, line NP splits the triangle into two trapezoids, triangle APN and triangle PNC. 3. **Centroid and Area Calculation**: The centroid O divides each median into two segments, the segment connecting to the vertex being twice the length of the segment connecting to the midpoint of the opposite side. Hence, each smaller triangle formed by connecting the centroid to the vertices has one-third the area of the larger triangles formed by the midpoints and the vertices. 4. **Area of triangle MPN and triangle ABC**: Given triangle MPN has area k. Since NP parallel BC, triangle PNC is similar to triangle ABC. The height of triangle PNC is half that of triangle ABC, so the area of triangle PNC is frac{1}{4} the area of triangle ABC. Since NP is the midpoint line, triangle MPN is half of triangle PNC.

Substituting (lambda = 0) into the equation, we obtain: [ x^n = 0 ] The only solution to this equation is ( x = 0 ). Therefore, when (lambda = 0), the equation has only real roots.

Two players take turns to add between 1 and 9 stones to the pile. The player who makes the total number of stones reach 200 wins the game. Who will win the game - the first or the second player?  1. **Identifying the winning strategy for the second player**:    - The second player has a strategy that ensures they always win. The key idea is to always make the sum of the stones added by both players in any round total to 10.    2. **Game Analysis**:    - If we denote the number of stones added by the first player in any given turn as ( x ) (where ( 1 leq x leq 9 )), the second player can add ( 10 - x ) stones to make the total for that round 10 stones. 3. **Maintaining the Strategy**:    - If this strategy is followed, the total number of stones after each round will always end in a 0 (i.e., 60, 70, 80, ..., 190) after each complete cycle of turns unless it's the first move or reaching towards winning condition. 4. **Winning Move**:    - When the pile has 190 stones, regardless of how many stones the first player adds (since the options range from 1 to 9 stones), the second player can always add the exact number needed to reach 200 stones, thus winning the game. 5. **Detailed Example**:    - Initial number of stones: 50.    - Suppose the first player adds ( x ) stones.    - The second player then adds ( 10 - x ) stones to ensure the total number of stones is a multiple of 10 plus 50.    - This results in a sieging where after each round of turns (both players' moves), the cumulative result maintains in increments of 10, reaching 200 eventually. 6. **Final Consideration**:    - Irrespective of the first player's moves, as long as the strategy is followed, the second player can always make sure that their move is the final move to 200 stones. # Conclusion: The second player has a guaranteed winning strategy by always adjusting their turn to maintain a total that ends in 0 between turns, leading to them being able to make the final winning move to exactly 200 stones.

The average price of the 10 pieces of fruit is 48 cents, so the total cost of the 10 pieces of fruit is 48 * 10 = 480 cents. We can set up the equation for the total cost of the apples and oranges: 40A + 60O = 480 We also know that A + O = 10, so we can express O in terms of A: O = 10 - A Now we can substitute O in the first equation: 40A + 60(10 - A) = 480 40A + 600 - 60A = 480 -20A = 480 - 600 -20A = -120 A = -120 / -20 A = 6 So Mary selects 6 apples.

For triangle ABC, the base is CB and the height is AC. Therefore, the area of triangle ABC is frac{1}{2} times AC times CB. 2. **Calculate the area of triangle PBC**: Similarly, the area of triangle PBC can be calculated using the distance h from point P to line CB as the height. Thus, the area of triangle PBC is frac{1}{2} times h times CB. 3. **Condition for the area of triangle PBC to be less than half of the area of triangle ABC**: We want the area of triangle PBC to be less than half of the area of triangle ABC.

Simplifying this inequality, we find that h < frac{AC}{2}. 4. **Determine the location of point P**: For the condition h < frac{AC}{2} to hold, point P must be located below the line that connects the midpoints of AC and AB. Let's denote these midpoints as D and E, respectively. The line segment DE divides the triangle ABC into a smaller triangle ADE and a trapezoid DEBC. 5. **Calculate the ratio of the areas of triangles ADE and ABC**: Since triangles ADE and ABC are similar (by AA similarity), the ratio of their areas is equal to the square of the ratio of their corresponding sides. Given that D and E are midpoints, AD = frac{AC}{2}. Therefore, the ratio of the area of triangle ADE to the area of triangle ABC is left(frac{AD}{AC}right)^2 = left(frac{1}{2}right)^2 = frac{1}{4}. 6. **Calculate the probability**: The probability that point P falls in the region that makes the area of triangle PBC less than half of the area of triangle ABC corresponds to the area of trapezoid DEBC relative to the area of triangle ABC. Since the area of triangle ADE is frac{1}{4} of the area of triangle ABC, the area of trapezoid DEBC is 1 - frac{1}{4} = frac{3}{4}. Therefore, the probability that the area of triangle PBC is less than half of the area of triangle ABC is boxed{frac{3}{4}}."},{"instruction":"On Monday Mike collected 450 cans to recycle.

Consider a complete graph ( K_9 ) with nine vertices, numbered from 1 to 9. Each vertex corresponds to one of the non-zero digits (1, 2, ldots, 9). 2. For each three-digit number of the form (abc) (where (a neq c) and none of **a, b, c** is zero), we will associate it with an edge joining vertices (a) and (c) in ( K_9 ). 3. These edges form a graph where each edge represents one of the valid three-digit numbers ending in a non-zero digit. 4. According to the problem statement, and by Euler's theorem on Eulerian cycles, a Eulerian cycle exists in this graph if and only if all vertices have an even degree. This condition must hold since we need to traverse every edge exactly once. 5. Each digit from 1 to 9 must appear as the last digit of a number which allows us to connect it to the first digit of the next number sequentially. The Eulerian cycle guarantees that the last digit of one number will be the first digit of the next. 6. We traverse this Eulerian cycle 10 times. For each digit (b) from 0 to 9 (though ( b ne 0 )), traversing in one direction of the cycle generates sequences of three-digit numbers. Then, by traversing the cycle again in the opposite direction another 10 times, all combinations ( abc ) where ( a neq c ) are covered. 7. After obtaining sequences that do not repeat any digit as ( a ) and ( c ) pair, inserting the numbers of the form ( aba ) into our sequence doesn't introduce any new patterns that disconnect the cyclic nature we’ve established. # Conclusion: Therefore, it is indeed possible to arrange all the three-digit numbers (not ending in zero) in such a sequence where the last digit of each number is the first digit of the next number.

This means that the total sum of the temperatures for these five days is 5 * 50 = 250 degrees. We know that the lowest temperature is 40 degrees. To find the possible maximum range of the temperatures, we need to consider the scenario where the temperatures on the other four days are as high as possible, given that the average must still be 50 degrees. If one day has a temperature of 40 degrees, the sum of the temperatures for the remaining four days would be 250 - 40 = 210 degrees. To maximize the range, we would want one of those days to have the highest temperature possible. Since the average cannot change, the maximum temperature for one day would be when the other three days have temperatures equal to the lowest temperature, which is 40 degrees. So, the sum of the temperatures for the three days at the lowest temperature would be 3 * 40 = 120 degrees. This leaves us with 210 - 120 = 90 degrees for the maximum temperature on the remaining day.

From the parallelism of opposite sides, we infer that ( A_1A_2A_3A_4 ) forms a parallelogram. 7. Since the parallelogram is inscribed in a circle and all vertices lie on the unit circle, it is a special type of parallelogram - a rectangle (because the opposite angles of an inscribed parallelogram are 90 degrees). 8. If ( M ) and ( N ) are coincident (overlap at the origin), then the four points ( A_1, A_2, A_3, A_4 ) form a shape with all sides parallel and equal length, confirming it is a rectangle. # Conclusion: Thus, the quadrilateral formed by the points corresponding to ( z_1, z_2, z_3, z_4 ) is a rectangle.

The sample space for tossing three coins is: HHH, HHT, HTH, HTT, THH, THT, TTH, TTT Where H represents heads and T represents tails. Now, let's count the outcomes with at most 2 heads: - 0 heads: TTT (1 outcome) - 1 head: HTT, THT, TTH (3 outcomes) - 2 heads: HHT, HTH, THH (3 outcomes) So, there are a total of 1 + 3 + 3 = 7 outcomes with at most 2 heads. The total number of possible outcomes when tossing three coins is 2^3 = 8 (since each coin has 2 possible outcomes and there are 3 coins). Therefore, the probability of getting at most 2 heads is the number of favorable outcomes divided by the total number of possible outcomes: P(at most 2 heads) = Number of favorable outcomes / Total number of possible outcomes P(at most 2 heads) = 7 / 8 So, the probability of getting at most 2 heads when three unbiased coins are tossed is boxed{7/8} ."},{"instruction":"A square is inscribed in a circle.

We need to find the average number of anchors over all possible subsets ( S subseteq {1,2, ldots, 15} ).  2. Firstly, define the concept of an anchor: for a number ( n ) in ( S ), ( n ) is an anchor if ( n ) and ( n + |S| ) are both in ( S ), where ( |S| ) denotes the number of elements in ( S ). 3. Consider each number ( n ) and the subsets ( S ) for which ( n ) is an anchor. Suppose ( S ) has ( k ) elements. Then, for ( n ) to be an anchor, we must have ( n in S ) and ( n+k in S ). This implies:    [    n + k leq 15    ]    which gives:    [    k leq 15 - n    ]    Additionally, ( k ) must be at least 2 because ( S ) must contain at least two elements (( n ) and ( n+k )). 4.

The above expression simplifies using the property of binomial coefficients:    [    sum_{k=2}^{15-n} binom{13}{k-2} = sum_{j=0}^{13-(n-2)} binom{13}{j} = 2^{14-n}    ]    because the sum of binomial coefficients up to (binom{13}{13-n}) is (2^{14 - n}) (refer to the binomial theorem). 7. Now, we sum this over all ( n ) from 1 to 13:    [    sum_{n=1}^{13} 2^{14-n}    ] 8.

Код для метода \`TransferSelectedItems\` (копирование из \`ListView2\` в \`ListView1\`): \`\`\`csharp private void TransferSelectedItems() { if (listView2.SelectedItems.Count > 0) { foreach (ListViewItem selectedItem in listView2.SelectedItems) { Item item = Items.ItemsList.FirstOrDefault(i => i.Name == selectedItem.SubItems[1].Text); // Предполагаем что имя во втором subitem if (item != null) { ListViewItem newItem = new ListViewItem(); newItem.ImageKey = item.ImagePath; newItem.SubItems.Add(item.Name); // Подэлемент: Название newItem.SubItems.Add(\\"1\\"); // Подэлемент: Количество (начальное значение) newItem.SubItems.Add(item.Category); // Подэлемент: Категория newItem.SubItems.Add(item.Level.ToString()); // Подэлемент: Уровень newItem.SubItems.Add(item.Enchantment); // Подэлемент: Зачарование (по умолчанию \\"None\\") newItem.SubItems.Add(item.Quality); // Подэлемент: Качество (по умолчанию \\"Normal\\") listView1.Items.Add(newItem); } // listView2.Items.Remove(selectedItem); // Удалите эту строку если элемент не должен исчезать из ListView2. } } } \`\`\` Код для метода \`removeItem_Click\` (копирование обратно из \`ListView1\` в \`ListView2\`): \`\`\`csharp private void removeItem_Click(object sender, EventArgs e) { if (listView1.SelectedItems.Count > 0) { foreach (ListViewItem selectedItem in listView1.SelectedItems) { ListViewItem newItem = new ListViewItem(); newItem.ImageKey = selectedItem.ImageKey; // Устанавливаем тот же ключ изображения // Следите за порядком subitems, он должен совпадать с заголовками столбцов в ListView2 newItem.SubItems.Add(selectedItem.SubItems[1].Text); // Название newItem.SubItems.Add(selectedItem.SubItems[3].Text); // Категория newItem.SubItems.Add(selectedItem.SubItems[4].Text); // Уровень // Так как в ListView2 нет столбцов для \\"Количество\\", \\"Зачарование\\" и \\"Качество\\", мы их пропускаем listView2.Items.Add(newItem); listView1.Items.Remove(selectedItem); // Удаляем элемент из ListView1 } } } \`\`\` Обратите внимание, что в методе \`removeItem_Click\` мы теперь воссоздаем элемент \`ListViewItem\` с таким же порядком подэлементов как и в \`ListView2\`. Мы также пропускаем подэлементы, которые есть только в \`ListView1\` (такие как \\"Количество\\", \\"Зачарование\\" и \\"Качество\\"). Убедитесь, что количество и порядок подэлементов правильно соответствует вашим заголовкам столбцов в обоих \`ListView\`. Если порядок подэлементов или количество колонок изменится, вам потребуется обновить эти методы, чтобы структура \`ListViewItem\` соответствовала новой структуре."},{"instruction":"Отлично работает.

Empire In the intricate tapestry of history, alternate threads can weave astonishing patterns. None so vivid and intricate as that relating to the Empire of Great Japan, a constitutional democratic absolute monarchial imperial state located in East Asia. The Japanese Empire, ruled by the Imperial House of Yamato as its imperial family, the Ōke, spanned considerable territories, including the Japanese Home Islands, Chōsen (the Korean peninsula), Karufuto (Southern Sakhalin and the Kuril Islands), Formosa (Taiwan and the Penghu Islands), Palau, Ryukyu (Okinawa), Takeshima (Dokdo), the Senkaku Islands, and the Carolines and the Marianas from the Meiji Restoration of 1868 until 1947. The Meiji Restoration, a pivotal moment in Japanese history, recalibrated the power dynamics in East Asia. It displaced the Tokugawa shogunate, reestablishing the preeminence of the Imperial House over Japan following centuries of shogunal dominion (1603-1868). This restoration of the ancient imperial lineage, revitalized Japan's international aspirations, and recentered Nihon as a significant regional force. However, following its defeat in World War II, Japan was stripped of most of these territories. It was in 1972, amidst a swell of anti-US sentiment fueled by transgressions of US military personnel in Ryukyu, that the United States, yielding to public outcry and political pressure, returned control of the island chain to Japan. The aftershocks of this act rippled through East Asia, and in 1988, Taiwan followed suit. The Republic of China, since 1947 a Leninist-Stalinist military dictatorship under the Kuomintang and riven by internal discord, collapsed in a democratic revolution led by former Imperial Japanese Army infantryman Lee Teng-hui. Taiwan (Formosa) opted to rejoin the Japanese dominion following KMT loyalists' retreat to a government-in-exile, even as they sought to liberate mainland China from the clutches of the People's Republic of China. The Minjung movement in Korea, a groundswell cry for freedom and democracy, led to upheaval in both the north and the south. This grassroots rebellion precipitated the fall of both Korean republics, and in an astonishing turn, created a vacuum filled by aspirations for reunification under Japanese rule. Associating Japanese governance with peace and stability, a petition for reannexation into Japan from Korea — now as the Japanese province of Chōsen — was ultimately accepted. This marked the end of Soviet influence in East Asia and brought about the unforeseen resurgence of a new Japanese Empire. This rebirth of imperial governance posed intricate questions about the future of territories once part of Dai Nihon Teikoku. Internal Soviet tumultuousness catalyzed an opportunity for Japan to reassert its territorial rights to Karufuto, along with other lost dominions. The restoration of imperial rule was legally endorsed through the combined mechanisms of popular referenda, national legislation by the Kokkai (Japan's bicameral National Diet), and constitutional amendments, rendering it a new era of imperial democracy unusual in the annals of global history. The responses of America, the Soviet Union, and mainland China — reeling under Han supremacist fascism — were mixed, ranging from resigned acceptance to covert opposition. Yet the spirit of regenerative monarchism did not halt at Japan's shores. Amongst the Manchu minority in China, oppressed by the ruling Chinese Communist Party (CCP), there were whispers of restoring the Qing dynasty, the last great imperial house to rule all China, from its Manchurian homeland. Could a phoenix rise from the flames of history? In a swift yet carefully deliberated operation, the previous military establishment of the Korean Peninsula — the Korean People's Army and the ROK Armed Forces — were amalgamated into the restored Imperial Japanese Army, symbolizing the melding of old rivals in a strengthened imperial defense force. The yangban, Korea’s overprivileged class, found their power effectively neutralized under the renewed imperial administration. Meanwhile, the descendants of Korea's Jeonju Royal House faced a delicate situation. While some were integrated within the Japanese nobility to assert the land claim, others were allowed a degree of autonomy as honorific nobility under close imperial watch. Formosa, adapting anew to its reintegration as a Japanese province, grappled with the remnants of its Chinese military presence. The National Revolutionary Army was integrated into Japan's military framework, repurposed and retrained under the discipline and ethos of the Imperial Japanese Army standards. As for the legacy of the Tungning Kingdom and its rulers, the Zheng family — descendants of the half-Japanese Ming loyalist Zheng Chenggong (Koxinga) — apprehended the shift of political winds. Some sought alliance with Ming restorationists, while others advocated for a new unified Chinese republic to counteract both the CCP's and KMT's failures. Thus, the restored Great Japanese Empire sits at a juncture of profound transformation, reestablishing its influence while navigating the complex currents of national identity, historical grievances, and the inexorable march towards a new conception of Asian unity. In these tumultuous times, a resurrected empire must tread carefully amongst echoes of its past, for the future waits, malleable and full of promise, for those with the vision to shape it. This chapter, while fictitious and imaginative in detailing an alternate history where the Japanese Empire is restored, illustrates the tantalizing possibilities history provides for speculative exploration. It prompts us to ponder the consequences of decisions and events that could have altered the trajectory of nations and the lives of millions. History, as ever, remains a canvas on which an infinite variety of stories may be painted, each as real as the choices that might have forged them."},{"instruction":"你好","output":"你好！有什么可以帮助您的吗？"},{"instruction":"如何填写 新员工月度考核表中的指标与可量化考核标准","output":"新员工月度考核表的填写需要根据公司的具体要求和岗位职责来设定合适的考核指标和可量化的考核标凈。以下是一些通用的步骤和建议，可以帮助你制定一份有效的考核表： 1. **明确岗位要求**： 根据新员工的职位描述，明确该岗位所要完成的工作内容和目标。 2. **设定考核指标**： 考核指标应该是衡量新员工工作表现的具体标准与要求，它们要尽可能具体、明确，例如销售量、客户满意度、项目完成情况等。一般来说，好的考核指标应该符合SMART原则，即Specific（具体）、Measurable（可测量）、Achievable（可实现）、Relevant（相关性）、Time-bound（时间限定的）。 3. **定量化的考核标准**： 每个考核指标都需要有一个或一组可以量化的标准，以便于客观评价员工的工作表现。例如，“本月完成销售额不得低于10万元”，“客户投诉率不得超过2%”等。 4. **制定评分系统**： 可以为每个考核指标设定不同的分值，通过设定等级或者分值的方式来量化新员工的绩效。比如“优秀”、“良好”、“一般”、“较差”、“不合格”等级别，每个级别对应一定的分数范围。 5. **参考部门目标和团队协作**： 除了考核个人的工作成绩之外，也应当考察新员工是否能够融入团队、协助合作伙伴完成任务，促进部门目标的实现。 6. **设置自我评价和反馈环节**： 考核表中可以留一个部分供新员工进行自我评价，同时，也应该有定期的反馈会议，根据考核结果与新员工进行沟通，让他们了解自己的表现，并提出改进措施。 7. **审阅和调整**： 定期审阅考核表，确保其一直贴合岗位要求和公司的发展需要。如果必要，根据情况的变化对考核标准进行调整。 举例来说，如果新员工是销售岗位的，那么其考核表可能包括以下指标和标准： - **销售额**：设定期望的销售额标准，如每月至少完成销售额10万元。 - **客户新增**：要求每月至少新增客户若干名。 - **客户满意度**：通过调查问卷等方式评估，客户满意度应达90%以上。 - **报告提交**：按时提交销售报告和市场分析，准时率达100%。 总之，填写新员工月度考核表时，重要的是结合公司实际，制定既公平又有挑战性的指标和标准，创造一个有助于新员工成长和提高工作绩效的环境。"},{"instruction":"新员工岗位为初级产品经理，如何进行编写","output":"对于新员工岗位为初级产品经理的月度考核表，可以从几个核心领域设置考核指标：产品开发进度、市场调研、团队合作、技能提升和工作态度等。以下是具体的考核标准编写示例： 1. **产品开发进度** - **考核指标**：项目管理和进度跟进 - **可量化考核标准**：按照产品规划时间表，每月完成既定产品开发进度的95%以上；文档更新和交付是否及时。 2. **市场调研** - **考核指标**：市场分析和用户研究 - **可量化考核标准**：每月至少完成一项市场分析报告和一项用户调研，准确率达到90%以上；数据收集与分析是否全面和准确。 3. **团队合作** - **考核指标**：跨部门沟通和协作能力 - **可量化考核标准**：参与团队会议，并提出建设性意见；协助解决至少一项跨部门协作的问题。 4. **技能提升** - **考核指标**：专业知识学习和应用 - **可量化考核标准**：每月至少完成一次专业知识学习，通过相应的测试，得分率80%以上。 5. **工作态度** - **考核指标**：工作主动性和责任心 - **可量化考核标准**：出勤率达100%，无迟到早退现象；主动承担责任，在遇到问题时积极寻找解决方案。 6. **产品质量管理** - **考核指标**：产品测试与用户反馈跟进 - **可量化考核标准**：参与产品测试的覆盖率至少达到95%；收集并整理用户反馈，并提出至少一项针对性改进建议。 编写时，可以按照以下模板： | 评估维度 | 考核指标 | 考核内容 | 评分标准 | 自评 | 主管评分 | |--------|----------------|----------------------------------------|----------------|-----|-------| | 产品开发进度 | 项目管理和进度跟进 | 按产品规划时间表，完成产品开发进度达95%以上；及时更新文档。 | 95%以上为满分 | | | | 市场调研 | 市场分析 | 每月完成一份市场分析报告。 | 准确率90%以上为满分 | | | | 团队合作 | 跨部门沟通 | 参与会议并提出建设性意见；协助解决跨部门问题。 | 按贡献大小评分 | | | | 技能提升 | 专业知识学习 | 每月完成一次学习，通过测试。 | 得分率80%以上为满分 | | | | 工作态度 | 工作主动性和责任心 | 无迟到早退现象；面对问题，主动提出解决方案。 | 出勤率100%及积极性评分 | | | | 产品质量管理 | 产品测试 | 参与产品测试覆盖率达95%；整理用户反馈并提出改进建议。 | 测试覆盖率和改进建议落实情况评分 | | | 请注意，以上指标和标准可能需要根据公司具体情况和产品经理的具体职责进行调整。衡量时也需要结合员工的实际工作表现和成长情况，以及团队内其他成员的反馈。最终的考核结果可以用于确定新员工是否适应产品经理这个角色，以及是否有晋升或培训的需求。"},{"instruction":"У меня был вопрос, однако твой ответ оборвался.

В вашей реализации используется функция lexemep, которая возвращает истину, если аргумент является строкой или символом. Также используется функция lowcase, которая, кажется, должна была преобразовать строку в нижний регистр, но в CLIPS название соответствующей функции — lowcase. Пример исправленной функции: (deffunction ask-question (?question ?allowed-values) (printout t ?question) (bind ?answer (read)) (if (lexemep ?answer) then (bind ?answer (str-lowcase ?answer))) (while (not (member ?answer ?allowed-values)) do (printout t ?question) (bind ?answer (read)) (if (lexemep ?answer) then (bind ?answer (str-lowcase ?answer)))) ?answer ) Допустим, вы хотите создать функцию, которая использует ask-question для задания вопроса с десятью разрешенными вариантами ответа. Пример функции, которая задает вопрос “Какой ваш любимый цвет?” и принимает варианты от 1 до 10, будет выглядеть следующим образом: (deffunction ask-favorite-color () (bind ?question \\"Какой ваш любимый цвет? (Выберите число от 1 до 10): \\") ;; Генерация списка строк от “1” до “10” (bind ?allowed-values (create ?allowed-values)) (loop-for-count(?i1-10) (bind?allowed-values(insert ?allowed-values ?i (str-cat ?i)))) ;; Использование функции ask-question для запроса ответа у пользователя (ask-question ?question ?allowed-values) ) Эта функция ask-favorite-color задает вопрос пользователю и использует функцию ask-question для проверки валидности ответа, который должен быть числом от 1 до 10 в виде строки. Цикл loop-for-count используется для генерации списка разрешенных значений, который передается в функцию ask-question. При вызове функции ask-favorite-color, пользователю будет предложено ввести свой любимый цвет в форме числа от 1 до 10. Если введенное значение не входит в список допустимых значений, будет повторно задан вопрос.

Ông đã phát triển JMA như một chỉ báo thuộc quyền sở hữu thương mại, và đó không phải là phần mềm mã nguồn mở. Tuy nhiên, có những cơ hội để tạo một biến thể xấp xỉ của công thức, mặc dù nó sẽ không giống hệt JMA chính thức. Bạn có thể sử dụng các thuật toán của các đường trung bình động mượt mà khác như EMA (Exponential Moving Average) hoặc Smoothed Moving Average (SMMA) làm cơ sở, và tinh chỉnh chúng để nâng cao hiệu suất so với JMA mô tả trong tài liệu. Tôi sẽ cung cấp một ví dụ cơ bản về cách tạo ra một phiên bản đơn giản của một đường trung bình động mượt mà bằng Python sử dụng pandas, một thư viện phổ biến để phân tích dữ liệu: \`\`\`python import pandas as pd import numpy as np # Một hàm mô phỏng đường trung bình động mượt mà tùy chỉnh def custom_smoothed_moving_average(data, period=10, smoothing=2): # Khởi tạo đường trung bình động mượt mà với giá trị đầu tiên của dữ liệu sma = [data[0]] # Thêm phần tử None để khớp vị trí với dữ liệu sma = sma + [None] * (period - 1) # Tính toán các giá trị cho đường trung bình động mượt mà for i in range(period, len(data)): smoothed_value = (smoothing * data[i] + (1 - smoothing) * sma[i - 1]) sma.append(smoothed_value) return sma # Giả sử bạn có một DataFrame 'df' với một cột 'price' # df = pd.read_csv(your_data_source) # Thay thế dòng bên dưới với dữ liệu giá cụ thể của bạn prices = np.random.rand(100) * 100 # Đây là một dãy giá giả định để mô tả # Ứng dụng hàm bạn vừa tạo custom_jma = custom_smoothed_moving_average(prices, period=10, smoothing=0.1) # Chuyển đổi danh sách kết quả trở lại thành một Series pandas (nếu cần) custom_jma_series = pd.Series(custom_jma, name='Custom_JMA') # Hãy hiển thị kết quả và xem xét sự mượt mà của đường trung bình print(custom_jma_series) \`\`\` Như đã nói, phiên bản trên không phải là Jurik Moving Average chính thức, và độ chính xác của nó so với JMA thực sự sẽ không giống nhau.

JMA được thiết kế để giảm thiểu độ trễ thường thấy trong các đường trung bình động truyền thống và cải thiện độ mượt mà của đường trung bình động, đồng thời duy trì khả năng phản ứng nhanh với các thay đổi giá. Tuy nhiên, thuật toán cụ thể của JMA là bí mật thương mại và không được công bố công khai. Do đó, không có thông tin chi tiết chính thức về cách triển khai thuật toán JMA từ nguồn gốc. Những gì chúng ta biết được dựa trên mô tả chung và quan sát về hành vi của chỉ báo. Dưới đây là một số khái niệm chung về tư tưởng đằng sau thuật toán JMA: 1. **Độ Mượt và Độ Nhạy**: JMA cung cấp khả năng điều chỉnh giữa độ mượt và độ nhạy thông qua một tham số \\"phase\\". Tham số này cho phép người dùng tăng cường độ nhạy để phản ứng nhanh hơn với sự thay đổi giá hoặc làm cho đường trung bình động mượt mà hơn để lọc ra nhiễu. 2. **Thích Ứng với Biến Động**: JMA được thiết kế để thích ứng với biến động của giá. Khi giá cả biến động mạnh, JMA sẽ phản ứng nhanh hơn, và khi giá cả ít biến động, nó sẽ trở nên mượt mà hơn. 3. **Bộ Lọc Động**: JMA sử dụng một loại bộ lọc động để làm mượt dữ liệu giá. Bộ lọc này có thể bao gồm nhiều giai đoạn, từ việc áp dụng một đường trung bình động thích ứng ban đầu đến việc sử dụng các bộ lọc tiên tiến hơn như bộ lọc Kalman. 4. **Tối Ưu Hóa**: JMA có thể sử dụng các phương pháp tối ưu hóa để tự động điều chỉnh các tham số của nó dựa trên dữ liệu lịch sử, nhằm cung cấp kết quả tốt nhất có thể. 5. **Giảm Thiểu Độ Trễ**: Một trong những mục tiêu chính của JMA là giảm thiểu độ trễ thường gặp trong các đường trung bình động khác, giúp nó trở thành công cụ hữu ích cho việc giao dịch theo xu hướng và phát hiện sự thay đổi xu hướng sớm hơn. Do không có thông tin chi tiết về cách triển khai thuật toán JMA, không thể cung cấp một hướng dẫn bước-by-bước chính xác. Tuy nhiên, các triển khai xấp xỉ của JMA thường bao gồm các bước như sau: - Tính toán độ biến động của giá và sử dụng nó để điều chỉnh trọng số của đường trung bình động. - Áp dụng một hoặc nhiều lớp làm mượt, có thể bao gồm EMA thích ứng và các bộ lọc tiên tiến khác. - Điều chỉnh đường trung bình động dựa trên tham số \\"phase\\" để cân bằng giữa độ mượt và độ nhạy. - Sử dụng các kỹ thuật tối ưu hóa để tinh chỉnh các tham số của đường trung bình động dựa trên dữ liệu lịch sử.

Allereerst hebben ze een beleidsdoel: een bepaald probleem dat ze willen oplossen of een programma dat ze willen implementeren. Het andere doel is een politiek doel: politici willen hun macht behouden, en genoeg macht verkrijgen, om hun doelen te behalen. Een bepaalde gebeurtenis kan zo een paradox zijn: de politieke doelen zijn al dan niet behaald, de politieke doelen misschien wel. Dit boek gaat over paradoxen in de politiek. Een voorbeeld: een Amerikaanse mevrouw tekent een contract met een Amerikaans stel om een kind voor hen te dragen. Na de geboorte wil ze de baby echter houden. Het geschil gaat naar de rechtbank waar gekeken wordt hoe dit moet worden gezien. Is het contract geldig? Heeft mevrouw haar baarmoeder verhuurd door middel van het contract en helpt ze zo een ander stel? Of is ze een baby aan het produceren en dan aan het verkopen? Oftewel: is een contract met een draagmoeder een contract voor een service of voor een baby? Volgens Stone is politiek een creatieve en waardevolle functie van het sociale bestaan. De gedachte om de openbare orde rationeel te maken, rust op drie pijlers: een model van redeneren, een model van de samenleving – de maatschappijvisie en een model van beleidsvorming. Het eerste model gaat over rationele besluitvorming: beslissingen worden gemaakt in een serie van gedefinieerde stappen: identificeer doelen, identificeer alternatieve mogelijkheden om doelen te bereiken, voorspel de mogelijke consequenties van de alternatieven, evalueer de consequenties van de alternatieven en als laatste selecteer het alternatief die de doelen het beste behaalt. Stone heeft een model ontwikkeld dat ver van dit model afstaat. Politieke redenering is rederenen door het gebruiken van metaforen. Het tweede model staat erg dicht bij het eerste model en gaat over de maatschappij dat wordt gezien als een verzameling van autonome rationele beslissers die geen gemeenschapsleven hebben. Ze ruilen met elkaar om hun eigen individuele welzijn te verhogen. Ze maximaliseren hun eigen behoefte door rationele berekeningen te maken. Het model gaat er dus van uit dat individuen zo goed als vaste onafhankelijke voorkeuren hebben voor producten, service en beleid. In de echte maatschappijen zijn mensen verbonden, zitten ze in sociale groepen en zijn hun voorkeuren gebaseerd op vergelijkingen en afhankelijk van hoe bepaalde keuzes aan hen gepresenteerd zijn. Stone ziet het model van de maatschappij niet als een markt, maar als een politieke gemeenschap (deel 1 van het boek). Het derde model is een productiemodel waar beleid wordt gecreëerd in een eerlijk geordende volgorde, zoals een assemblage band. Een probleem komt op de agenda en wordt gedefinieerd, het gaat dan langs de juridische en uitvoeringafdelingen van de overheid waar alternatieven worden bedacht. Als je het zo bekijkt dan lijkt het model sterk op de stappen van het rationele model. Het model kan ons echter alleen vertellen of iets niet goed werkt, maar niet waarom sommige oplossingen juist tot problemen leiden. Stone mist hier de essentie van politieke gemeenschappen: de strijd om ideeën. Ideeën staan in het midden van alle politieke conflicten. Stone gebruikt in het boek de volgorde van doelen → problemen → oplossingen, omdat dit een logisch stappenplan laat zien van het oplossen van problemen en omdat het parallel loopt aan het rationele besluitvormingsmodel en het beleidsvormingsproces. Back to top Hoofdstuk 1: De politieke gemeenschap Een theorie van het beleid van de politiek begint met een model van politieke samenleving: een model van de simpelste versie van de samenleving die de essentiële elementen van politiek kent. Een politieke gemeenschap (in het Grieks: polis) is hier een goed voorbeeld van: het is klein genoeg om simpele vormen van organisaties te kennen, maar groot genoeg om ook echt politiek te drijven. Om de elementen van politiek te leren kennen kan gebruikt worden gemaakt van het marktmodel. Een markt is een sociaal systeem waarin individuen hun eigen welzijn najagen door, indien wederzijds voordelig, onder meer producten te ruilen met anderen. Mensen concurreren om schaarse middelen, proberen zaken te verkrijgen voor de laagste prijs en zetten spullen om in meer waardevolle zaken die ze kunnen verkopen tegen de hoogste prijs. In het marktmodel geven individuen alleen om hun eigenbelang: hun eigen welzijn. Ze zijn echter niet zozeer egocentrisch bezig: ook vrienden en familie kan vallen onder hun ‘eigenbelang’. De politieke gemeenschap en het algemeen belang Het model van de politieke gemeenschap moet rekening houden met de collectieve wil en collectieve inspanningen. Een politieke gemeenschap moet een soort van lidmaatschap hebben om te definiëren wie wel en wie geen lid is. Ook moet er een onderscheid zijn tussen de politieke gemeenschap en de culturele gemeenschap. De eerste is een groep mensen die met dezelfde politieke regels en structuur van de regering leven. Zij delen de status als burgers. Een culturele gemeenschap is een groep van mensen die hun cultuur delen en hun identiteit baseren op de taal, geschiedenis en tradities. In veel landen bevat de politieke gemeenschap verschillende culturele gemeenschappen. Het is ook erg moeilijk om de culturele gemeenschappen zo te integreren in een politieke gemeenschap zonder de identiteit en integriteit te vernietigen of beschadigen. Lidmaatschap definieert automatisch ook de sociale, economische en politieke rechten van de leden. Ook de wederzijdse hulp naar andere leden definieert een gemeenschap. Het bundelen van middelen voor het herdistribueren naar de personen die het nodig hebben is de essentie van verzekeringen. Verzekeringen zijn in het marktmodel gewone financiële producten die bedrijven verkopen om winst te behalen en kopers kopen om zichzelf te beschermen tegen economisch verlies. In de politieke gemeenschap is gemeenschappelijke hulp een product op zich die mensen samen creëren om de gemeenschap te beschermen. In de politieke gemeenschap is sprake van een algemeen belang. Soms willen mensen zelf echter wat anders dan de gemeenschap. Burgers hebben dan ook twee kanten: een private kant die gericht is op hun eigen belang en een publieke kant dat de zaken behelst die de gemeenschap wil (het algemeen belang). Over deze doelen is consensus, tenminste: het betreft wat de meeste mensen op dat moment willen. Er is bijna nooit volledige consensus over. Het verandert dus wel steeds in de loop der tijd. Het betreft zaken die goed zijn voor de gemeenschap als gemeenschap, zoals overleving of bescherming van de gemeenschap. Het algemeen belang is wel een kenmerk van de politieke gemeenschap omdat er vaak over gediscussieerd wordt in de politiek. Men wil het algemeen belang definiëren, al is dit erg lastig. Het concept van het algemeen belang is voor de politieke gemeenschap, wat het eigenbelang voor de markt is. In de beide markten zit wel iets van elkaar, maar het is erg anders. In de markt het algemeen belang is het resultaat van alle individuen die hun eigen belang proberen na te jagen. Collectieve problemen De vraag is nu hoe je zowel eigen voordelen als gemeenschappelijke voordelen kunt behalen. Situaties waarin het eigenbelang en het algemeen belang tegen elkaar werken noemen we collectieve problemen. Er zijn twee types. De eerste zijn acties die gericht zijn op het eigenbelang brengen sociale kosten met zich mee, zoals het dumpen van afval in een rivier. De tweede zijn sociale voordelen vereisen privé offers, zoals het betalen van belasting voor het bouwen van scholen. Maar de voorbeelden zijn ook om te draaien: schone rivieren zijn voordelig voor de gemeenschap, maar brengen privé kosten met zich mee van het aanschaffen en gebruiken van afvalverwerkingmachines die niet vervuilen. Collectieve problemen worden ook wel collectieve actie problemen genoemd omdat het lastig is mensen te overtuigen om kosten te maken of af te zien van voordelen voor een gemeenschappelijk goed. Deze problemen komen niet voor in het marktmodel, maar wel in de gemeenschap. Door invloed, samenwerking en loyaliteit wordt het gat tussen eigenbelang en algemeen belang opgevuld. Onze acties worden beïnvloed door anderen, maar ook door hun gemaakte keuzes, door de keuzes die wij verwachten dat ze gaan maken, door hetgeen zij verwachten wij gaan doen en door hetgeen wij denken dat zij verwachten wat wij gaan doen. Over het algemeen doen mensen pas iets als de meeste mensen het gaan doen (zoals een staking) of ze willen juist iets doen voordat de massa het ook gaat doen (in tijden voor een mogelijke crisis snel je geld bij de bank weghalen bijvoorbeeld). Samenwerking is net zo belangrijk in een politieke gemeenschap als concurrentie. Dit komt doordat a) politiek om het maken van allianties gaat en het organiseren van samenwerking om zo tegenstanders te kunnen verslaan en b) samenwerking is essentieel om macht te hebben. Samenwerking is een effectievere vorm van ondergeschiktheid dan dwang. Samenwerking is de norm in de politieke gemeenschap en het is een noodzakelijk ingrediënt van macht. Samenwerking gaat om het vormen van langdurige allianties. In de markt en in de politieke gemeenschap is echter een andere kijk op loyaliteit. In de werkelijkheid, in de markt, wisselen kopers tussen verkopers aan de hand van veranderingen in de prijs en kwaliteit. In de politiek en politieke gemeenschap zijn relaties niet zo veranderlijk. Politieke allianties verbinden mensen. Je spreekt ook niet van kopers en verkopers, maar van vijanden en vrienden. En vrienden blijven je lang bij, je kijkt naar het verleden, naar jullie geschiedenis samen, en vergeeft ze snel. De geschiedenis is echter in de markt totaal onbelangrijk. Door samenwerking, invloed en loyaliteit zijn groepen en organisaties, en niet de individuen, de bouwstenen van de politieke gemeenschap. Groepen zijn belangrijk om 3 redenen. De eerste is dat zelfs al zijn ze formeel geen lid, mensen behoren tot veel verschillende organisaties. De tweede is dat beleidsvoering niet alleen gaat om het oplossen van problemen, maar ook over hoe groepen gevormd en veranderd zijn om doelen te bereiken. En als derde is dat groepen belangrijk zijn omdat vele dimensies van de politieke gemeenschap collectief zijn door formele procedures, zoals onderhandeling, en door publieke organen, zoals rechtbanken. In de ideale markt is informatie perfect: het is correct, compleet en beschikbaar voor iedereen. In de politieke gemeenschap is informatie te interpreteren, incompleet en om strategische redenen niet altijd beschikbaar. Informatie is natuurlijk niet altijd correct en waar. Wat wij geloven van de informatie die we krijgen hangt af van wie het ons vertelt, de bron, en hoe het is gepresenteerd, het medium. Ook de timing van de informatie, de relatie tot bepaalde gebeurtenissen en de verschillende informatiebronnen naast elkaar kunnen de manier veranderen hoe informatie beoordeeld wordt. Politiek is gedreven door hoe mensen informatie interpreteren. Men wil deze interpretaties het liefst beheersen zodat er geen twijfel over bestaat. De informatie is hierdoor anders in de gemeenschap dan in de markt. In de politieke gemeenschap is informatie ook nooit compleet (we weten nooit alle middelen om het doel te bereiken of alle mogelijke effecten) of volledig beschikbaar (het koste geld om informatie te krijgen). Informatie wordt vaak ook bewust achter gehouden, zoals businessplannen van ondernemers of ideeën van uitvinders. Passie en macht In de markt de economische middelen worden beheerst door de wetten van de materie. Middelen zijn eindig, schaars en worden volledig geconsumeerd bij het gebruik. In de politieke gemeenschap de wetten van paradoxen zijn van kracht, of wel de wetten van passie. Ze worden zo genoemd door Stone omdat ze zich meer als emoties gedragen dan als fysieke materie. Net als passie of hartstocht worden politieke middelen soms vergroot door het gebruik ervan en niet verminderd. Ook de politieke vaardigheden en gezag groeien door het gebruik. Dat vaardigheden groeien is geen verrassing: door iets vaker te doen, leer je alleen maar, maar dat gezag ook groeit is interessant. Traditie is belangrijk: hoe vaker je een bepaalde beslissing maakt, hoe makkelijker het is om hiermee door te gaan: je hebt geen nieuwe inspanningen nodig om iets nieuws te verzinnen en mensen zijn minder geneigd zich te verzetten tegen iets waar ze zich al naar gedroegen. Het fenomeen dat middelen vergroten door oefening, gebruik, praktijk en uitdrukking wordt genegeerd in het markt model. Andere wetten van passie die in het boek worden behandeld zijn: het geheel is groter dan de som van de delen en dingen kunnen meer dingen betekenen (en zijn het daarvoor) dan een ding tegelijk. Nogmaals, wat Stone met een gemeenschap bedoelt is dat het een politieke gemeenschap is met ideeën, beelden, een wil en inspanningen, afgezien van individuele doelen en gedrag; dat het een algemeen belang heeft; dat de meeste beleidsproblemen gemeenschappelijke problemen zijn; dat invloed doordringend is en de grens tussen invloed en dwang wordt altijd betwist; dat samenwerking net zo belangrijk is als concurrentie; dat loyaliteit de norm is; dat groepen en organisaties de bouwstenen zijn; dat informatie te interpreteren, incompleet en strategisch is en als laatste dat het wordt geregeld door de wetten van passie en door de wetten van de materie. Macht wordt als laatste behandeld omdat het volgens Stone overal door heen loopt. Stone ziet macht als een fenomeen van een politieke gemeenschap. Het doel ervan is om het eigenbelang ondergeschikt te maken aan andere belangen. Het manifesteert zich door invloed, samenwerking en loyaliteit en het is gebaseerd op de strategische controle van informatie. Het is ook een middel dat de wetten van passie eerder naleeft dan de wetten van de materie. Back to top Hoofdstuk 2: Gelijke gevallen gelijk behandelen De definitie van gelijkheid is dat men gelijke mensen gelijk moet behandelen. Er zijn verschillende vormen. Stone geeft het voorbeeld dat een docente van plan was een taart uit te delen in haar klas. Je kunt dan op verschillende manieren mensen op een gelijke en rechtvaardige manier behandelen. Via een lidmaatschap: de taart in gelijke delen, maar ongelijke uitnodigingen. En dus is niet iedereen uitgenodigd voor een stuk taart. Via een rangorde: ongelijke stukken voor ongelijke mensen en gelijke stukken voor gelijke mensen. Leraren zouden een groter stuk moeten krijgen dan de studenten. Via groepen: ongelijke stukken taart, maar gelijk verdeeld. De helft van de taart voor de mannelijke studenten, de helft voor de vrouwelijke. Er zijn echter 1/3 mannelijke en 2/3 vrouwelijke studenten. Via grenzen van het item: ongelijke stukken, maar gelijke maaltijden. Studenten die in de kantine minder hadden gegeten omdat ze de taart verwachtten, zouden een groter stuk mogen dan de studenten die zich vol hadden gegeten. Via waarde van het item: ongelijke delen, maar gelijke waarde voor de ontvangers. Studenten die niet echt van taart hielden, wilden maar een klein stukje en vonden dat de andere grotere stukken mochten krijgen. Via concurrentie: ongelijke stukken, maar gelijke middelen vanaf het begin. Studenten krijgen allen een vork en mogen aanvallen. Via een loterij: ongelijke stukken, maar gelijke statistische kansen. Stop briefjes met namen in een hoed en trek er 1 uit die een stuk mag. Via stemmen: ongelijke stukken, maar gelijke stemmen. Wees democratisch en laat iedereen stemmen voor iemand die taart zou mogen krijgen. Het probleem met verdelen is dat je dit op verschillende manieren kan doen. Een taart kun je in evenveel gelijke stukken snijden als er mensen zijn of je kunt de manier waarop de verdeling plaats vindt gelijk maken waardoor niet iedereen per se een stuk taart krijgt (loten, statistische informatie, wedstrijd). Gelijkheid wordt op deze manier ongelijkheid: de manier waarop de taart wordt verdeeld is misschien wel gelijke en eerlijk, maar niet iedereen krijgt nu taart en dit is niet eerlijk of gelijk. In elke verdeling spelen drie belangrijke dimensies een rol: de ontvangers, het item, het proces. De eerste drie (lidmaatschap, rangorde en groepen) zijn gebaseerd op een herdefinitie van de ontvangers, de vierde en vijfde (grenzen van het item, waarde van het tem) herdefiniëren het item en de zesde tot en met de achtste (concurrentie, loterij en stemmen) focussen op het proces van verdeling. Rangorde en groepen gaan vooral over hoe de maatschappij verdeeld is. De tweede gaat namelijk om een verdeling gebaseerd op rangorde (ook wel horizontale en verticale rangorde) of gebaseerd op verdiensten/prestaties. De derde gaat om verdeling gebaseerd op een bepaalde groep, in dit geval geslacht. De belangen van de mensen in deze groep wegen dan zwaarder dan individuele karakteristieken. Verdeling zoals in de groepen wordt vaak gebruikt om eerdere pogingen die waren mislukt (en vaak uit de rangorde categorie bestonden) te repareren. Groepen die vroeger gediscrimineerd werden, zoals vrouwen, krijgen nu vaak een voorkeursbehandeling. Dit zie je vooral in het onderwijs, op de banenmarkt en ondernemerschap (voorbeeld: het makkelijker krijgen van een lening). Het doel hiervan is om ras en geslachtsdiscriminatie te elimineren. Soms wordt er ook een quotum ingesteld: dan wordt er een deel gereserveerd voor een bepaalde groep, zoals bepaalde banen die voor 50% naar vrouwen moeten gaan. Het verschil tussen de tweede en derde is als volgt: rangorde verdelingen delen mensen in groepen en doen dit aan de hand van eerlijke individuele kenmerken. Groepsverdelingen delen mensen in op basis van een simpel demografisch kenmerk. Dit heeft niets te doen met individuele ervaringen of prestaties. Er is veel discussie over of de verdeling aan de hand van groepen wel nuttig is. Als iemand bijvoorbeeld een Chinese en een Nederlandse moeder heeft, hoe delen we hem/haar dan in? Daarnaast corresponderen deze groepsindelingen niet met de praktijk en ervaringen van de personen. Het enige doel van verdelingen op groepsbasis is om mensen te compenseren voor vroegere nadelen. Daarom zou deze vorm van verdelen alleen maar een manier moeten zijn om tekortkomingen te verbeteren en zou het verdelingssysteem aangepast moeten worden naar een verdeling naar verdienste. Er zijn redenen te noemen om niet over te gaan op een groepsverdeling en voorkeursbehandeling, maar te kiezen voor een verdeling gebaseerd op individuele prestatie: als je een bepaalde groep een voorkeursbehandeling geeft, discrimineer je eigenlijk daarmee de groepen die dit niet krijgen. Een andere reden is dat we verkeerde criteria gebruiken om de groepen te kiezen die zo’n behandeling krijgen. Men zou groepen moeten helpen die persoonlijk een sociaal en economisch nadeel hebben geleden en dus niet puur en alleen baseren op geslacht of ras. De manieren van de grenzen en waarde van het item zijn gebaseerd op het herdefiniëren van een item. De grenzen van de waarde methode herdefinieert de grenzen: de taart wordt gezien als deel van een maaltijd. Men gebruikt het item (de taart) om ongelijkheden in een groter geheel te compenseren (de lunch). Financiële steun aan studenten in Amerika is een voorbeeld hiervan: sommige scholen geven hulp aan de hand van hoe hoog de studieresultaten zijn, maar anderen baseren het op hoeveel financiële hulp iemand nodig heeft. Soms wordt er gekeken naar de huidige inkomsten van studenten, anderen kijken ook naar de inkomsten van de ouders. Wat er dus verdeeld wordt verscheelt nogal: hulp als deel van de eigendommen van een student, geld als deel van de eigendommen van de families ed. Bij de waarde van het item methode gaat over het herdefiniëren van een item in termen van de waarde voor een individu. Men kijkt dan bijvoorbeeld niet naar het gewicht van een stuk taart, maar naar de hoeveelheid voeding dat iemand uit dat stuk taart haalt. Je ziet dit vaak in de beleidsgebieden onderwijs, gezondheidszorg en de woningmarkt waar deze zaken hun waarde halen uit de behoeften van individuen. Hier komen ook vragen: betekent gelijkheid dat iedereen dezelfde toegang moet hebben tot artsen of betekent het juist dat je zelf een arts mag kiezen? De zesde tot en met de achtste richten op het proces van verdeling: concurrentie, loterij en verkiezingen. Bij deze zaken accepteren wij vaak een ongelijke uitkomst zo lang we weten dat het proces eerlijk is verlopen. Dit is vooral belangrijk in de politieke gemeenschap, omdat hier verdelingen niet zomaar uit zichzelf gebeuren maar dit bewust door mensen moet gedaan worden. Eerlijkheid is dus erg belangrijk. Wanneer er ergens dus een simpele zin als “behandel elk geval gelijk” staat, dan moet men zich de volgende zaken eerst afvragen: wie zijn de ontvangers en op welke manieren kunnen we die definiëren? Wat wordt er verdeeld en wat zijn de manieren om dat te definiëren? Wat zijn de sociale processen waardoor de manier van verdelen wordt bepaald? Oftewel: wat is de procedure voor verdeling die wordt gekozen? Argumenten voor gelijkheid Men moet eerst bepalen waar men zichzelf ziet binnen een verdelingsproces: dit is niet bepaald door de kenmerken van een bepaald item (zoals studenten hulp), maar door een algemeen wereldbeeld. Dit zijn aannames over de betekenis van een politieke gemeenschap en de aard van gelijkheid. Je kunt de verdelingen ook op verschillende manieren beoordelen: door criteria van het proces of van de ontvangers en items. Een voorstander van de procescriteria is Robert Nozick: een verdeling is terecht als het door een vrijwillig en eerlijk proces tot stand kwam. Het is eerlijk als alles wat in de verdeling zit eerlijk verdeeld is. Maar de vraag is hoe je weet of iets eerlijk verdeeld is. Nozick heeft twee typen van de inhoud van de verdeling bepaald: alles wat nieuw is, zoals een uitvinding, of nog niet eerder eigendom was van iemand, moet eerlijk verkregen zijn. En alles dat via een overdracht verkregen is, zoals verkoop, een gift ed., moet eerlijk verkregen zijn. Of een verdeling dus eerlijk is, bepaalt hij aan de hand van historisch bewijs. Robert Nozick zet zijn proces van kijken naar de geschiedenis van de inhoud tegenover een eindresultaatconcept. Dit is de benaming die Nozick ervoor geeft, maar het is de theorie van John Rawls. Hierin gaat het om karakteristieken van ontvangers of eigenaren en karakteristieken van het item en bekijkt men of dit een juiste match is. Nozick vindt het eerste tot en met het vijfde voorbeeld in het taartvoorbeeld een eindresultaat concept. Zij vinden een correcte verdeling een verdeling waarin zowel de ontvanger als het item correct gedefinieerd zijn en elke gerechtigde ontvanger ontvangt een eerlijk deel. Men kijkt dus naar het eindresultaat en niet naar informatie over hoe de verdeling tot stand kwam. ‘Gerechtigde ontvangers’ worden door Rawls als alle burgers gezien en de gerechtigde items als sociale primaire goederen. Dit zijn zaken die erg belangrijk zijn voor mensen (vandaar: primair), maar ze zijn gecreëerd en gevormd door sociale structuren en politieke instituties (vandaar: sociaal). Voorbeelden zijn macht, kans, gezondheid, inkomen, mensenrechten en vrijheden. Hiertegenover staan natuurlijke primaire goederen: die zijn van belang, maar ze staan minder onder de controle van de mens zoals intelligentie, kracht, verbeelding, talent en gezondheid. Rationele mensen willen volgens Rawls dat sociale goederen eerlijk verdeeld worden, maar ze accepteren sociale en economische ongelijkheden als ze voor ieders voordeel werken en ze gekoppeld zijn aan plekken of kantoren die vrij toegankelijk zijn voor iedereen. Ook al noemt Nozick Rawls theorie een eindresultaat gerichte theorie, deze theorie is wel degelijk belangrijk: gerechtigheid wordt door hem gezien als een attribuut die de regels en instituties die de maatschappij bestuurt regelt en niet als een attribuut van de verdelingen die resulteren van deze regels. Rawls noemt deze manier van kijken rechtvaardigheid als billijkheid. Rawls ontwikkelt zijn principes van rechtvaardigheid door een proces dat centraal staat aan zijn theorie: de formatie van een hypothetisch sociaal contract tussen vrije en gelijke mensen. Elke benadering van het verdelen heeft problemen. Nozick’s concept van rechtvaardigheid definieert ‘eerlijkheid’ als originele overnames en overdrachten. Maar een overdracht dat geen juridische regels overschrijdt in de maatschappij kan ook best eerlijk zijn. Wanneer je je aan de regels houdt, ben je echter niet per se ‘eerlijk’. Er zijn geen onafhankelijke standaarden waarmee het proces van verdelingen beoordeeld kan worden. Dit geldt ook voor de theorie over het eindresultaat. Men zou het eens moeten worden over de relevante karakteristieken van de ontvangers en het item, maar dit is niet makkelijk omdat men het er niet snel over eens kan worden. Men zou natuurlijk wel universele standaarden kunnen nemen die niet afhankelijk zijn van een de normen van een bepaalde maatschappij. Dit is de benadering van John Rawls. Hij kijkt naar onze aangeboren gevoel van rechtvaardigheid. Maar dit werkt alleen als we geloven dat er een universele logica is over verdeling en rechtvaardigheid. Aanhangers van Nozick’s inzichten houden niet van beleid dat direct gericht is op de herverdeling, zelfs al vinden ze de verdeling oneerlijk. Mensen die de eindresultaat inzichten naleven zijn wel gericht op de herverdelingen. Toch is de scheiding tussen de twee theorieën niet zo duidelijk. In het gehele debat over rechtvaardigheid speelt ook de mate van tussenkomst een rol: de mensen die achter de eerste theorie staan zien vrijheid als een recht om hun eigen middelen te gebruiken en weg te doen zonder dat hier mee bemoeid wordt. Sancties van de regering zien ze niet graag, omdat belasting bijvoorbeeld de mensen weerhoudt van het gebruik van middelen zoals ze willen. Mensen van de theorie van de eindresultaat zijn meer gewend om hun vrijheid te zien als het hebben van genoeg basis middelen waartussen ze kunnen kiezen en niet als noodzakelijkheid. Men denkt lang na over welke middelen ‘basis middelen’ zijn voor de mensheid. Mensen van de theorie van Rawls vereisen niet hetzelfde van alles voor iedereen, maar wel een minimum van alles voor iedereen, zoals een minimum inkomen. Men zou dus altijd het noodzakelijke minimum moeten krijgen. Deze manier van kijken wordt wel ‘eerlijke delen’ genoemd. Deze theorie gaat er ook van uit dat belangrijke waarden sociaal gecreëerd zijn. Dit is weer een verschil met de eerste theorie: hier ziet men eigendom en waarden als individueel gecreëerd en men geeft voorkeur aan beleid dat individuele vrijheid om middelen te verkrijgen zoals men wilt respecteert. De theorie van Rawls ziet eigendom en waarde als sociaal gecreëerd en geeft voorkeur aan het herverdelen van de middelen zodat iedereen in ieder geval toegang heeft tot sociaal gecreëerde middelen. In de eerste theorie is men gemotiveerd om te werken, te produceren en te creëren, primair door de behoeften van mensen. Ze werken om hetgeen te krijgen wat ze moeten of willen hebben. In de andere theorie hebben mensen een natuurlijke drive om te werken, te produceren en te creëren en ze worden geremd door hun behoefte. Zoals nu duidelijk moet zijn, zijn de twee clusters die hier beschreven zijn sociale conservatisme en sociale liberalisme. Conservatisme ziet eerlijke verdelingen als eerlijke overnames, vrijheid als vrijheid om je eigen eigendom te vervreemden, eigendom als een individuele creatie en het hebben van financiële behoeften als een motivatie om te werken. Liberalisme zien eerlijke verdelingen als eerlijke delen van de basis behoeften, vrijheid in de vorm van bittere noodzaak, eigendom als een sociale creatie en productiviteit als stimulans door de maatschappij. Back to top Hoofdstuk 3: Het meeste uit iets halen De definitie van efficiëntie die in dit boek gebruikt wordt is: de meeste uit een bepaalde input halen. Ofwel: een doel bepalen tegen de laagste kosten. Efficiëntie is geen doel op zich: het is niet iets die we willen, maar het is iets wat ons helpt om meer te bereiken van de zaken die we waarderen. Het is een manier om de verdiensten van verschillende zaken die we doen te beoordelen. Het is de ratio tussen input en output, inspanning en resultaat, uitgaven en inkomsten of kosten en daaruit voortvloeiende voordelen. Het gaat allemaal om het meeste uit iets halen. Het is de uitkomst van de keuze tussen alternatieven. Er spelen wel conflicten: wie krijgt de voordelen en wie draagt de lasten van een bepaald beleid? Hoe moeten we de waarden en kosten van een beleid meten? Welke wijze van organiseren van activiteiten komt met de meeste efficiënte resultaten? Bekende auteurs over efficiëntie zijn Herbert Simon en Wildavsky. Zij onderzochten allen het beheren van een bibliotheek. Een efficiënt gerunde bibliotheek is volgens hen een bieb die een mooie collectie van verschillende boeken heeft. Er zijn echter veel mensen het hier niet mee eens, zij zien efficiëntie in dit geval anders. Sommige burgers vinden de collectie misschien niet het belangrijkste, maar juist de servies, lezingen die gehouden worden, schoolprojecten ed. De vraag is dus wie de collectie van boeken gekozen heeft als belangrijkste doel. Mensen die van boeken houden, kunnen gaan discussiëren over de inhoud van de collectie: wat maakt een collectie goed? Heeft het kinderboeken of juist alleen romans? Deze vragen gaan om de doelgroep: voor wie is de bieb vooral bedoeld? Men kan de werkgelegenheid die een bieb creëert ook zien als een output en niet alleen als een input. inputs zijn wel vaker ook outputs. Ook zouden de medewerkers kunnen wijzen op andere voordelen, behalve dat er werkgelegenheid wordt gecreëerd: het voorlezen aan kinderen, sociale ontmoetingsplek voor ouderen. Tot waar moeten we dus kijken naar de voordelen van een bieb en hoe waarderen we alle verschillende zaken? Met het budget waarmee boeken gekocht worden voor de collectie kan ook heel veel andere dingen mee gedaan worden. Welke niet genomen kansen worden nu dus gezien als kosten in de efficiëntie berekening? Sommige mensen zien een efficiënte bieb als een bieb die geen tijd verspilt. Gebruikers verspillen niet zo veel tijd als ze veel hulp krijgen bij het vinden van boeken. Sommige mensen vinden een efficiënte bieb een bieb die makkelijk te gebruiken is. Er zouden dan bijvoorbeeld meer kopieën van 1 boek te vinden moeten zijn. Dit vraagt om het maken van deze kopieën, maar juist dit proces, wat voor de een dus een efficiëntie proces is, is voor een ander verspilling. Er is dus geen duidelijk idee hoe je efficiëntie kunt meten. Over het idee van ‘het meeste uit iets te halen’ is iedereen het vaak wel eens, maar om dit concreet te maken vergt dat men veronderstellingen maakt over wie en wat belangrijk is. Markten en efficiëntie Het centrale leerstuk van de theorieën van markten is dat vrijwillige transacties de beste manier is om tot efficiëntie te komen. Markten zijn netwerken van transacties. Zonder de overheid zouden mensen echter niet zo snel met vreemden producten uitwisselen. De overheid is er ook om de regels van eigendom te herformuleren. Eigendom is een recht om iets te gebruiken en ruilen. De regels van eigendom bepalen wat in het eigendom van wie is. De zaken die uitgewisseld kunnen worden, worden over het algemeen door de overheid bepaald. Toch worden er ook wel eens zaken uitgewisseld die verboden zijn door de overheid. Of mensen verkopen zaken waar ze geen eigendom over hebben. De regels van eigendom worden echter vaak voordat de transacties plaatsvinden vastgesteld. Transacties hebben twee belangrijke kenmerken die als belangrijke zaken van het marktmodel gelden. Ze zorgen ervoor dat de aanhangers dit model het meest efficiënte model vinden: de transacties zijn vrijwillig en volledig geïnformeerd: mensen maken hun vrijwillige transacties aan de hand van twee vormen van informatie; objectieve informatie over de prijs en kwaliteit van alternatieven en subjectieve informatie over hun eigen behoeften, wensen en mogelijkheden. Zo lang markten deze kenmerken hebben dan zullen ze efficiënt zijn. In de markttheorie verandert de vrijwillige transacties de middelen in iets wat nog waardevoller is. Een bepaalde vorm van transactie is de conversie van ruwe materialen naar afgewerkte producten ofwel van inputs naar outputs. Dit is de standaard manier van transformatie. Er is nog een manier: de transactie zelf. De paradox van markten is dat alle items twee waarden hebben: hun markt prijs of algemene waarde en de subjectieve waarde. De behoefte en het vermogen veranderen de algemene waarden van zaken. Dit komt door de vrijwillige transactie. Markt modellen hebben te maken met de distributie van dingen naar mensen. Toch gebruikt men het woord ‘allocatie’ in plaats van ‘verdeling’. Allocatie benadrukt de productiekant van de economie en niet de consumentenkant. De theorieën van rechtvaardigheid en de theorie van efficiëntie hebben verschillende perspectieven over de aard van sociaal welzijn. In de markttheorie is het zo dat wanneer alle transacties efficiënt zijn, het resultaat is dat er efficiëntie heerst op het maatschappelijk niveau of het resultaat maximaal sociaal welzijn is. Theorieën van rechtvaardigheid eisen dat men vergelijkingen maakt tussen mensen en oordelen over de waarde van items. De theorie van efficiëntie neemt als gegeven de vooraf bestaande inkomens verdeling. Er is geen plek binnen deze theorie dat mensen kritiek geven op de keuzes van anderen en over de waarde voor de maatschappij van aankopen van mensen. Uitdagingen Er zijn verschillende voorwaarden voor een goede functionerende markt. De eerste is dat een vrijwillige uitwisseling weliswaar tot efficiëntie leidt, maar ongedwongen marketen werken niet altijd zoals ze zouden moeten. De markt kan nog wel eens falen. Markten kunnen alleen werken als er niemand is die de markt prijs kan beïnvloeden. Als dit mislukt dan zijn er monopolies. Soms ontstaan er echter natuurlijke monopolies. Het beste beleid is dan om dit te accepteren en de schadelijke neveneffecten te laten beheersen door overheidsregulatie. De tweede is dat er volledige informatie beschikbaar moet zijn over de beschikbare alternatieven, zodat transacties resulteren in de beste uitkomsten voor iedereen. Deze voorwaarde is moeilijk te halen, omdat volledige open informatie kosten met zich mee brengt en mensen niet altijd bereid zijn om dit te betalen. Daarnaast zou sommige informatie mensen kunnen tegenhouden om een transactie aan te gaan. De derde is dat de beslissingen en acties van partijen in een transactie of uitwisseling niet het welzijn van mensen moeten raken die geen deel van deze uitwisseling maken. Situaties waar mensen buiten een transactie toch worden geraakt noemen we externaliteiten of externe factoren. In de welzijnseconomie deze effecten worden als negatief ervaren. In de theorie van de markt zijn deze externe factoren niet het grootste probleem. Dit is om mensen zo ver te krijgen dat ze kosten gaan maken en denken over neveneffecten die anderen kunnen schaden in transacties. De vierde is dat de middelen in uitwisselingen individueel gebruikt moeten worden en helemaal op worden gemaakt als ze al worden gebruikt. Als deze voorwaarde er niet is dan is er sprake van een marktfalen dat we collectieve goederen noemen. Dit zijn de gemeenschappelijke problemen uit hoofdstuk 1. Collectieve goederen zijn 1 type van falen die marktvoorstanders zien als niet veranderbaar of corrigeerbaar in een systeem van vrijwillige uitwisseling. Er zijn nog meer uitdagingen als we kijken naar of een maatschappij die geheel georganiseerd is als een systeem met vrijwillige uitwisseling van goederen werkelijk efficiënt kan zijn. De uitdagingen gaan om menselijke psychologie en een brede visie van de maatschappij als staatsinrichting. De markt theorie heeft het impliciet over het idee van welzijn, geluk en tevredenheid. Mensen ondervinden veel en halen geluk bijvoorbeeld ook uit andere ervaringen dan alleen uit transacties. Welzijn en tevredenheid komen uit relaties die mensen creëren en ontwikkelen met andere mensen en niet zozeer uit de resultaten van de transacties. De meeste activiteiten die mensen dan ook ondernemen vallen buiten de grenzen van de transacties. Extrinsieke beloningen, zoals salaris en bonussen, die geen deel uitmaken van de activiteiten verminderen dan ook de intrinsieke motivaties van mensen om te werken en te leren. Mensen zijn geneigd om minder betrokken te zijn bij hun werk waar ze eerst nog zo van genoten zodra ze ervoor betaald krijgen. Een sociaal systeem dat geheel als markt transacties is georganiseerd zal niet alle sociale welzijn kunnen produceren dat mogelijk wel beschikbaar is. De basis condities van perfecte competitieve markten bestaat in de werkelijkheid ook niet. Een systeem van vrijwillige transacties kan daarom ook nooit echt werken zoals het bedoeld is in de theorie. In de polis is de grens tussen vrijwillig en dwang erg onduidelijk waardoor het concept van pure vrijwillige transactie twijfelachtig wordt. De polis staat bekend om invloed, groepen, en loyaliteit waardoor subjectieve voorkeuren nooit onafhankelijk gevormd worden. Dit wordt gevormd door groepsdruk; druk van de familie en van tradities. Het probleem van het manipuleren van de voorkeuren van binnenin de markt zorgt op zich ook weer voor vragen of vrijwillige transacties echt leidt tot efficiëntie. Advertenties en reclames zijn een voorbeeld van een manier waarop individuele voorkeuren gevormd worden vanuit binnenin de markt. Alle services zijn eigenlijk een combinatie van werkelijke service en advies over wat de consument nodig heeft. Als consumentenvoorkeuren dus gevormd worden door verkopers dan kunnen we niet langer uitgaan van het feit dat elke transactie het welzijn van beide partijen in die transactie verhoogt. Een andere reden om de mogelijkheid van pure vrijwillige transacties in twijfel te trekken komt door de sterke ongelijke verdeling van inkomsten en gezondheid. Loyaliteit geeft nog een dilemma: de meeste uitwisselingen zijn niet eenmalig maar maken deel uit van lange termijn relaties. Dit type relaties kan een dwingend element toevoegen aan transacties en uitwisselingen op twee manieren: ze genereren verwachtingen van continue uitwisselingen, zodat als 1 van de twee partijen de relatie beëindigt de andere persoon druk voelt. Iemand krijgt de klappen als een relatie tot zijn eind komt. De theorie van de markt zegt dat mensen vrijwillig in transacties mee doen, maar het zegt niets over vrijwillig er weer mee stoppen. Het beëindigen van een transactie wordt vaak gevoeld als dwangmatig, en niet vrijwillig. De tweede manier is dat op lange termijn relaties vaak worden opgezet tussen twee partijen met ongelijke macht. Deze relaties kunnen ervoor zorgen dat de sterke profiteert van de zwakte van de andere partij. Een tweede kenmerk van het marktmodel geeft aan dat individuen beslissingen maken aan de hand van volledige informatie over de alternatieven en de subjectieve voorkeuren. Maar een dilemma met dit kenmerk is dat het eigenlijk onmogelijk is om alle informatie te hebben die nodig is om vrijwillige transacties te krijgen die resulteren in efficiëntie. Het marktmodel vraagt om precieze en complete informatie, maar in de polis informatie is altijd incompleet, te interpreteren en bewust gecontroleerd. We weten alle lange termijn consequenties en neveneffecten van elke mogelijke transactie ook niet. In de polis is het zo dat de belangrijke informatie ook gewoonweg niet bestaat: niemand weet of kan weten wat de lange termijn consequenties van de meeste beslissingen zijn. Naast het kenmerk van ‘perfecte informatie’ is er ook een verschil in het strategische karakter van informatie in de polis, net als in vele echte markten. Geheimhouding is een belangrijk voor competitieve strategieën. Partijen in een transactie maken bewuste beslissingen op de basis van incomplete informatie over het verleden en de toekomst en over de services en producten in de transactie. Voorstanders van de markt geloven dat de problemen van het bewust achterhouden van informatie kunnen worden opgelost door reguleren. In de polis vindt men dat het achterhouden van informatie een essentieel deel is van de strategie in het economisch en politiek leven en het reguleren ervan zal mensen niet kunnen tegenhouden om zich strategisch te gedragen. Vrijwillige transacties leiden tot efficiëntie omdat elke transactie de algemene marktwaarde van iets omzet in een hogere waarde voor het individu of het bedrijf. Een derde set van uitdagingen focust op de vergelijking van de maatschappelijke welvaart met individuele welvaart. Dit gooit het idee over boord dat er geen andere betekenisvol concept is van sociale welvaart dan het totaal van de individuele situaties. Individuele welvaart wordt beïnvloed door de welvaart van anderen en door de complexiteit van activiteiten en beslissingen van een politieke gemeenschap. Vele doelen van openbare orde kunnen niet opgedeeld worden in situaties van individuen: politieke gemeenschapsoverleving, veiligheid en trots van een lid in een politieke gemeenschap, kameraadschap ed. Deze typen van welvaart kunnen niet bestaan als ze worden opgedeeld en verdeeld onder de burgers. Markten zijn dus niet zozeer de beste manier om een maatschappij te organiseren. Markten leiden namelijk niet altijd tot efficiëntie: dit idee is gebaseerd op het idee dat efficiëntie objectief bepaalbaar is. Markten zijn een manier om sociale activiteit te organiseren die regels nodig hebben over wie kan verkopen, wat verkocht mag worden ed. markten zijn een wijze van organiseren van sociale activiteit dat de mensen macht geeft die het geld beheren. De verhouding tussen gelijkheid en efficiëntie Gelijkheid en efficiëntie staan in relatie met elkaar: er wordt vaak gedacht dat hoe meer we van de een hebben, hoe minder van de ander. Men is dan ook op zoek naar de beste mix. De relatie tussen deze twee is het sterkst tussen belasting en welzijnsbeleid. Er zijn drie redenen waarom efficiëntie en gelijkheid in een relatie zitten. De eerste is het motivatie argument. Gelijkheid verwijdert de verschillende beloningen die noodzakelijk zijn om mensen te motiveren productief te zijn. Als men richting gelijkheid van inkomens gaat dan vermindert dit de individuele inspanning, besparingen en uiteindelijk het niveau van productieve investeringen in een maatschappij. De tweede is het innovatie argument. Om gelijkheid te behouden moet de regering constant bemoeien met de individuele keuzes over hoe men middelen gebruikt. Het beteugeld zo innovatie en experimenten. Hoe groter de gelijkheid, hoe groter de bureaucratie van de regering moet zijn. Maar hoe groter de bureaucratie, hoe minder flexibel het wordt. En de derde is het verlies/afval argument. Om gelijkheid te behouden is een administratieve machine nodig die middelen gebruikt, maar zelf niet productief is. Deze machine van gelijkheid (belasting kantoren, uitzendbureaus ed.) vertegenwoordigen de daadwerkelijke verliezen van waardevolle middelen. Het werk, de gebouwen, de computers en papier die ze gebruiken kunnen ook gebruikt worden om iets te produceren. Er is ook kritiek op deze 3 redenen. Ook al zijn mensen gemotiveerd door de behoeften en de wens om verschillen van status en gezondheid tussen hen en anderen te verhogen, zulke grote verschillen zijn niet nodig om motivatie te laten bestaan. Je kunt ook meer gelijkheid krijgen zonder efficiëntie te verspillen. Sommige herverdelingen stoppen de experimenten en innovatie helemaal niet. Iets dat administratief is, hoeft nog niet niet-productief te zijn. Veel administratief werk (zoals monitoren van een budget) draagt wel degelijk bij aan de output van een organisatie. Ook creëert het werk voor mensen, integreert hem in een sociale groep en geeft hem waardigheid. Back to top Hoofdstuk 4: Bevrediging menselijke behoeften De definitie van zekerheid is de bevrediging van de minimale menselijke behoeften. Behoeften zijn de meest fundamentele politieke claim: behoefte weegt zwaarder dan wensen of wat men verdient. Als men echt iets nodig heeft dan heeft men bepaalde middelen of hulp nodig omdat ze essentieel zijn. De meeste mensen geloven ook dat de maatschappij mensen moet helpen als ze dat nodig hebben. Maar er onder ligt een conflict over hoe men de behoeftige kan onderscheiden van alleen het verlangen en hoe men de verdeling moet regelen. Er zijn verschillende dimensies van behoeften. De bekendste definitie van behoefte is wat noodzakelijk is voor puur fysieke overleving. Regeringen moeten voor genoeg voedsel en onderdak zorgen voor de bevolking. Hongersnood wordt vaak als ondergrens aangehouden: de armoedegrens wordt in Amerika aangehouden als de officiële definitie van armoede. Zekerheid kan gereduceerd worden tot een doel en tot behoeften die we kunnen bepalen (zoals categorieën of kanonskogels in het leger), maar dit is problematisch. Waarom dit zo is illustreren we aan de hand van een voorbeeld over eten. Voor eten is het nodig dat we minimum vereisten moeten kunnen bepalen, maar er zijn uitdagingen waarom het idee van objectief bepaalbare doelstellingen. Er zijn vijf dimensies van behoeften. De eerste is de symbolische betekenis. Allereerst komt dit omdat materiële dingen een symbolische betekenis hebben die vaak belangrijker zijn dan de materiële waarde. Mensen hebben niet alleen behoeften, maar ze hebben ook ideeën over deze behoeften. Eten is niet alleen maar calorieën, maar ook een idee van lidmaatschap, sociale status en spirituele betekenis. Eten verbindt mensen aan bepaalde plaatsen of bepaalde gebeurtenissen (denk aan Thanksgiving Day). Eten heeft een rituele betekenis: je bent wat je eet is hier een uitdrukking van. Elke cultuur heeft zo zijn tradities over eten. Vasten is voor velen een ritueel en erg belangrijk, maar anderen zien het als zonde: mensen hebben minder energie, werkgevers hebben werknemers die zich niet goed kunnen concentreren door het gemis aan eten ed. De tweede is de relatieve betekenis. Om zijn symbolische dimensie, behoefte is relatief maar ook absoluut. Absolute concepten stabiliseren de definitie van behoefte naar een vast punt, zoals de armoedegrens. Relatieve concepten stabiliseren de definitie van behoefte naar iemand zijn plaats in een verdeling, zoals dat je een inkomen hebt onder het minimum. Het gevoel dat mensen zich achtergesteld vinden komt door de vergelijking met anderen. Relatieve behoefte gaat ook om het beschrijven hoe mensen komen tot hun standaarden over wat noodzakelijk is. Bijna alle behoeften hebben wel een relatieve dimensie in de zin dat mensen ze definiëren in overeenstemming met maatschappelijke standaarden, normen en gewoonten. Keynes was erg cynisch: hij zei dat relatieve behoeften kunnen worden voldaan alleen door de positie van superioriteit. Relatieve behoeften is de perspectief van mensen in een maatschappij, in het heden. Absolute behoeften is de perspectief van mensen buiten de maatschappij of mensen die continue in het verleden leven naast het heden. Mensen vergelijken hun economische groei en behoeften vaak met hun ouders. De intergeneratie-vergelijking als een referentiekader kan een belangrijke bron van tevredenheid zijn en kan ook een criteria zijn om te beoordelen of mensen het beter hebben. Relatieve behoeften is niet alleen simpel een fenomeen van individuen. We zien het ook in organisaties, in industrieën en bedrijven. Relatieve behoeften is belangrijk genoeg in politiek om te worden vastgelegd in het overheidsbeleid. Vele sociale welzijnsprogramma’s focussen op de relatieve en niet de absolute behoeften. In het defensiebeleid is relatieve behoefte vaker belangrijker dan de absolute. Ons idee van nationale veiligheid is afhankelijk van onze vergelijking met landen die we zien als vijanden. Het gaat om hoeveel vergeldingsmaatregelen wij nog over hebben nadat we aangevallen zijn door een ander land, of het gaat om of onze capaciteit om een aanval tegen te gaan groter is dan de capaciteit van het andere land om ons te vernietigen. Het gaat niet om hoeveel mensen gedood zijn door onze soldaten of hoeveel steden vernietigd zijn. Absolute behoeften kun je gebruiken als je de stabiliteit in de tijd en tussen gemeenschappen wilt zien. Relatieve behoeften wordt echter vaker gebruikt. Een derde dimensie van behoefte is directe vs. instrumentele behoeften. We hebben iets nodig niet voor de directe bevrediging die ze geven, maar voor de dingen die zij ons kunnen laten hebben en doen. Onderwijs wordt zo gezien: studenten hebben het nodig omdat het hen naar goede banen zal leiden en zo productieve werkers worden. Rawls zegt dat sociale primaire goederen zoals rechten en vrijheden zijn belangrijk niet voor hun eigen bestwil maar omdat zij ervoor zorgen dat mensen hun eigen individuele doelen en dromen kunnen vervullen. De instrumentele benadering van behoefte is cruciaal voor egalitaire theorieën van rechtvaardigheid. Net als de symbolische en relatieve concepten is het instrumentele concept moeilijker de definiëren dan het absolute concept, maar het is belangrijker voor de politiek. Een directe behoefte is bijvoorbeeld dat er import restricties zijn op producten die het land in gaan zodat binnenlandse producenten beschermd worden. Een instrumenteel argument is dat de import restricties de producenten tijd geven om hun fabrieken te moderniseren, kost bespaar acties in te stellen en ook nieuwe banen te genereren voor het volk van het land. Meer bekendheid is een vierde dimensie: de bescherming van de mogelijke toekomstige behoeften in tegenstelling tot de compensatie voor huidige en vroegere gemiste kansen. Zekerheid, of de bescherming van toekomstige behoeften, is de belangrijkste vooringenomenheid in het overheidsbeleid geworden. We zijn ons meer op de toekomst gaan richten dan het verleden. Het is de drijvende kracht in het reguleren van eten, maar ook drugsbeleid ed. Mensen baseren hun behoeften tegenwoordig ook meer op de risico’s. Fysieke overleving is de vijfde criteria van zekerheid: relationele behoeften spelen hier een rol. Mensen die een grote hoeveelheid geld ontvangen van een erfenis of verzekeringsmaatschappij geven dit vaak weg om de behoeften van andere mensen te helpen in plaats van dat ze het uitgeven om hun eigen materiële welzijn te verhogen. Mensen hebben ook behoeften voor relaties en niet alleen voor spullen. Deze vijf dimensies van behoeften zijn niet bedoeld om een hiërarchie aan te geven of een bepaalde volgorde. De dimensies zijn alternatieve manieren om behoeften te conceptualiseren. De natuurwetenschappen hebben de neiging om menselijke behoeften te behandelen alsof het doelen zijn en bepaalbaar door middel van experimentele methoden. Het rekent echter niet op individuen die ons vertellen wat ze nodig hebben. In plaats daarvan testen objectieve observanten mensen onder strikte condities en maken conclusies onafhankelijk van de wensen van de subjecten of de onderzoekers. De productie van goederen en services creëert nieuwe behoeften. Relatieve behoeften betekent hier dan de consumptie van 1 persoon de wens van zijn buurman wordt. Symbolische behoeften betekent dat goederen de badges van prestige worden die alleen werken als ze nieuw, anders en schaars zijn. Adverteren en promoten manipuleert de behoefte van mensen. De analyse van de dimensies van behoefte helpt in het verklaren van de dynamieken van een politiek conflict die in het hart staat van het doel van de maatschappij. Het geeft een raamwerk om te laten zien hoe politieke spelers aanspraak kunnen maken op de zekerheid en veiligheid. Behoeften in de gemeenschap Door de politiek bepaalt een maatschappij of behoeften echt of legitiem zijn. Wetgevende hoorzittingen worden gebruikt om informatie over behoeften te verzamelen en te testen. De vertegenwoordiger is gekozen omdat hij actie gaat ondernemen tegen bepaalde problemen en de getuigen zijn gekozen omdat ze een omschrijving kunnen geven van de behoeften. Budgettering is ook een manier waardoor groepen hun claims laten horen. Onderhandelingen door vakbonden worden dan gehouden die de behoeften van de vele spelers meenemen. Dit laat allemaal zien dat veel van de politiek een inspanning is om de collectieve behoeften te definiëren. Dit is een ander opzicht waarin er sprake is van een publiek belang in de polis. De behoeften die een maatschappij herkent als legitiem en probeert te bevredigen noemen we publieke behoeften of het publiek belang. In welzijnseconomieën bepalen de intrinsieke eigenschappen van goederen of ze publiek zijn of niet. Publieke belangen zijn bepaald in een politiek proces en ze hebben meer te doen met de ideeën van mensen dan met de intrinsieke eigenschappen van de spullen. Er is altijd wel geschil over publieke belangen. Alle maatschappijen streven naar het gezamenlijk zorgen voor de erkende behoeften van hun leden en voor de overleving van de maatschappij als geheel. De gemeenschappelijk voorziening voor de veiligheid is de belangrijke kracht die de maatschappij samen houdt. Mensen zijn dankbaar als ze hulp ontvangen als ze in nood zijn. Liefdadigheid kan ook loyaliteit creëren en politieke samenhang. Dit kan dan weer de mensen motiveren. Liefdadigheid kan zo indirect het aanbod van waardevolle middelen verhogen. De belangrijkste politieke theorieën verschillen over hoe we het proces moeten begrijpen waarin mensen hun behoeften vorderen. De klassieke liberale traditie zeggen dat behoeften uiting vinden in gedrag, zoals consumptie beslissingen of het formeren van georganiseerde belangengroepen. Dus behoeften worden vertaald in acties. Hervormingsgezinde liberalen, ook wel neopluralisme, zeggen dat niet alle behoeften waarschijnlijk een uitingsvorm vinden. Niet alle behoefte worden omgezet in politieke organisaties. De Marxistische traditie verwerpt het liberale idee dat behoeften automatisch omgezet worden in een vraag ernaar, maar ook het Hervormingsgezinde idee dat alleen bepaalde behoeften er uit springen. Zij gaan uit van kapitalistische maatschappijen waar een minderheid de productiemiddelen bezit en zij domineren. De meerderheid heeft geen macht en hun behoeften worden zo onderdrukt dat ze hun eigen werkelijke behoeften ook niet meer weten. De verhouding tussen zekerheid en efficiëntie Er wordt weleens gezegd dat zekerheid en efficiëntie onverenigbaar zijn. Er zijn hier verschillende redenen voor. De eerste is het motivatie argument. Als mensen veilig zijn en ze hun behoeften bevredigd zien, dan zullen ze minder of helemaal niet meer werken en de productiviteit zal dan dalen. Maar dit is volgens Stone echter niet waar: het aantal uren dat men werkt gaat namelijk niet naar beneden met een verhoging van de welvaar of de inkomens. Ook een verhoogde economische zekerheid zorgt niet dat de productiviteit verlaagt. Productiviteit wordt gezien als de output per arbeidsuur. Het idee dat de materiële zekerheid de motivatie en productiviteit ondermijnt is dus niet waar. De tweede is hoe productiviteit gemeten wordt: de output per uur wordt veel gebruikt in productiesectoren, maar voor de service sector men kijkt naar het aantal mensen dat behandeld is of het aantal patiënten per dag. Maar voor klanten is dit juist negatief: je wilt ergens heen waar je genoeg aandacht krijgt en er genoeg tijd voor je is. Als services meer zekerheid en veiligheid bieden, en klanten zo tevreden zijn, dan daalt de eigenlijk productiviteit dus wel omdat het zo apart gedefinieerd is. De derde is het voortgangsargument: vooruitgang voor een maatschappij als geheel kan niet gebeuren zonder individuele verliezen. Er kan namelijk weinig geïnvesteerd worden in nieuwe gebieden zonder dat de oude investeringen worden weggehaald. Nieuwe gebouwen kunnen alleen gebouwd worden op plekken waar al gebouwen staan als deze weg worden gehaald. Zekerheid kan dus vooral gerealiseerd worden ten kosten van efficiency. Een oplossing hiervoor is om regeringen mensen te laten beschermen en niet de plekken: individuen dus en niet de bedrijven en instituties. Maar dit is wellicht toch wel lastig: we beschermen organisaties en bedrijven nou juist omdat zo de politieke macht georganiseerd is. Ook is de bescherming van individuen makkelijker als ze niet vast zitten aan een plek, aan buren en aan vrienden. Maar mensen waarderen juist de politieke gemeenschap en zijn wortels. Back to top Hoofdstuk 5: Doen wat je wilt De definitie is: doe wat je wilt, zo lang het anderen niet schaadt. Er is een paradox in het begrip vrijheid: hebben we altijd het recht om te doen wat we willen? In het overheidsbeleid gaat deze dilemma over of de regering zich legitiem kan bemoeien met de keuzes en activiteiten van de burgers. John Stuart Mill heeft in 1859 het boek On Liberty geschreven over dit onderwerp waarin hij probeert om een single criteria te vinden voor wanneer een maatschappij zich mag bemoeien met de individuele vrijheid. Hij geloofde dat overleg en keuzevrijheid de essentie is van wat het betekent om een mens te zijn en dat de regering daarom zich zo min mogelijk mag bemoeien met individuele keuzes. Mills zijn resolutie van het probleem is de dominante manier van denken over vrijheid in de Amerikaanse politiek. Daarom wordt er hier aandacht aan de belangrijkste elementen besteed. Er is één criteria waarmee we kunnen beoordelen of bemoeienis met individuele acties terecht is: schade aan anderen. Het is gebaseerd op de mogelijkheid van een duidelijk onderscheid tussen het gedrag dat andere mensen treft en gedrag dat dit niet doet. Het ziet vrijheid als een attribuut van individuen , niet als sociale rollen of groepen of organisaties. Het definieert vrijheid in een negatieve manier: het ontbreken van bemoeienis met individuele actie. Om vrijheid te kunnen geven betekent het dat men niets moet doen in plaats van juist iets doen. Dit is een positief concept: vrijheid vereist actieve bepalingen van kansen en middelen. Mill definieert vrijheid dus onder andere met het begrip ‘schade voor anderen’. Beleidskeuzes gaan dan om een keuze tussen het beschermen van de individuele vrijheid en het voorkomen van schade aan anderen. Om dan te kijken wanneer regering zich moet bemoeien met individuele vrijheid moet men kijken naar welke types van schade de maatschappij moet voorkomen. De vraag van vrijheid gaat dan om de aard van de schade. Het eerste type gaat om lichamelijk letsel. Men moet hier bijvoorbeeld kijken of het blootstellen van werknemers aan chemicaliën ook schade veroorzaakt. De schadeveroorzakende effecten van chemicaliën worden onder meer bepaald door de sociale organisatie van het gebruik: hoe het werk is georganiseerd, hoe lang medewerkers eraan worden blootgesteld, hoe het beloningssysteem en compensatiesysteem is geregeld en dergelijke. Tegenwoordig is het zo dat lichamelijk letsel vaak het resultaat is van grote en complexe systemen en niet zozeer van individuele acties. De relatie tussen individuele menselijke acties en schade aan anderen is niet zo duidelijk als Mill ons doet geloven. Dit is niet het enige wat er vreemd aan Mill zijn assumptie is. Zelfs als een actie mensen schade toebrengt, dan zijn er vele mogelijke manieren om schade te voorkomen en elke manier bemoeit zich met verschillende vrijheden voor verschillende mensen. De identificatie van de schade veroorzakende consequenties van acties vertellen ons niet welke acties voorkomen moeten worden of wiens zijn vrijheid aan banden gelegd moet worden. Het tweede type gaat om materiële schade. De materiële schade aan anderen is een legitieme reden om te bemoeien met de individuele vrijheid. Iemand kan een inkomensverlies krijgen door een actie van iemand anders, of een verlies van middelen. Maar is er een verschil tussen gedrag dat fysiek eigendom vernielt (een auto die een restaurant in rijdt) en gedrag dat de marktwaarde van spullen vernielt (de waarde van een huis dat naast een kraakpand met junkies staat). Het derde type gaat om de effecten van belevingswaarde. Sommige activiteiten zorgen voor esthetische schade, zoals het plaatsen van advertenties op billboards langs de snelweg. Het neerhalen van historische gebouwen of het vernielen van een historisch district zijn schades die niet in materiële termen omschreven kunnen worden. Verstoringen van de rust valt hier ook onder. Dit is dus een meer abstracte schade. Hoe meer abstract en symbolisch een type wordt (van 1 naar 3 wordt dit steeds meer zo) hoe meer politiek omstreden ze zijn. Het vierde type gaat om emotionele en psychologische schade. Je ziet dit vaak in de publieke sfeer waar de regering wordt gevraagd om bepaald gedrag te reguleren om zo psychologische schade aan anderen te voorkomen. Er zijn dilemma’s als het om psychologische schade aankomt. Het vijfde type gaat om spirituele en morele schade. Het vorige type gaat in dit type over. Mill was onvermurwbaar dat religieuze overtuigingen nooit door de regering mochten worden gecontroleerd en gereguleerd. De regering mag nooit zijn beleid baseren op bepaalde praktijken van bepaalde groepen zoals het niet willen eten van varkensvlees. Ondanks dat de kerk en staat gescheiden zijn, horen we nog vaak over spirituele schade in de politiek. Abortus is een voorbeeld waar mensen erg anders over denken. Schade aan anderen is geen objectieve fenomeen die door onderzoek ontdekt en gedocumenteerd kan worden. Er is te zeggen dat er tussen de types een hiërarchie zit: een claim gebaseerd op 1 heeft een grotere kans op succes dan claims gebaseerd op 2 en 2 heeft een groter succes dan 3 enzovoort. Er zijn veel verschillende soorten schade en in de politieke strijd worden ze herkend, niet zozeer in een rationele ontdekking. Vrijheid in de gemeenschap De polis is een politieke gemeenschap met gezamenlijke visies over het algemeen belang. De vrijheid van individuen is daarom gelimiteerd door verplichtingen aan de politieke gemeenschap. Er is een meer actieve opvatting over legitieme dwang dat vereist dat individuen participeren in de gezamenlijke inspanningen om zo de stabiliteit en orde te behouden. De regering is niet alleen een scheidsrechter die mensen die onrust stoken tegenhoudt, maar ook een impresario die bedrijven coördineert. In de politieke gemeenschap de sfeer van dwang gebaseerd op de belangen van de politieke gemeenschap is erg groot. De meeste maatschappijen vragen van hun leden om contracten en beloftes na te komen, belasting te betalen en kinderen naar school te sturen. Ze vergen ook dat leden de wetten naleven ook al zorgen overtredingen voor schade aan andere mensen. Deze zijn er allemaal om de maatschappij zelf te beschermen, niet de individuen. Deze vrijheden gaan over of de regering zich legitiem kan bemoeien met individuele keuzes om zo de sociale cohesie te bevorderen en de politieke gemeenschap te beschermen. In een politieke gemeenschap zijn vormen van schade die Mill niet heeft meegenomen in zijn individuele schade. Structurele schade: de effecten van de mogelijkheid van een politieke gemeenschap om te functioneren als een politieke gemeenschap. Accumulatieve schade: sommige acties zijn niet schadeveroorzakend als 1 persoon ze doet, maar ze kunnen vernietigend zijn als veel mensen ze doen. De schade voor een groep dat een resultaat is door de schade aan individuen. Mensen leven en werken in groepen in de politieke gemeenschap en de effecten van schade aan individuen raken de groep ook. Als iemand een baan wordt geweigerd dan raakt dit zijn kinderen ook. Regeringen zijn vaak minder beperkend ten opzichte van het gedrag van ambtenaren dan van het gedrag van gewone burgers. Ambtenaren en uitvoerders hebben meer vrijheid nodig om hun werk te doen. Dit noemt men soevereine immuniteit: ze kunnen niet verantwoordelijk worden gehouden voor bepaalde schade die ze veroorzaken. Ook ondernemers met een eigen bedrijf zijn in sommige gevallen persoonlijk beschermd tegen de verliezen van het bedrijf. Maar op andere manieren is het gedrag van deze mensen juist meer beperkt: sommige uitvoerders mogen geen aandelen in een bedrijf kopen waar ze bepaalde informatie van weten. Vrijheid in de politieke gemeenschap is tot een belangrijke mate een attribuut van de rollen en niet zozeer van de individuen zelf. We definiëren de taken en verplichtingen van mensen volgens hun rollen en geloven dat verschillende rollen ook verschillende mate van vrijheden hebben. Als je vrijheid als een attribuut van individuen ziet dan mis je de veel belangrijke politieke vraag van de vrijheden van de verschillende actoren: kerken, vakbonden, politieke partijen en vrijwillige bedrijven ed. De overheidsinstellingen zijn de belangrijkste actoren. Deze kunnen zowel schade aan de politieke gemeenschap als aan de individuen begaan. Dat er nu overal buiten camera’s hangen is een voorbeeld. Aangezien actoren een grotere impact kunnen hebben op individuen en de politieke gemeenschap dan de acties van andere individuen moeten theorieën van vrijheid deze actoren er wel bij betrekken. Elke politieke gemeenschap staat een bepaalde bewuste of voorzienbare schade toe als het anderen straft. We kennen dan ook verschillende vormen van schade die ontstaan in de naam van de vrije markt. De verhouding tussen vrijheid en zekerheid en de dilemma’s Kan een maatschappij mensen beschermen van schade en leed zonder dat ze de vrijheden beperkt? Er zijn twee dilemma’s: afhankelijkheid en paternalisme. Als de basis behoefte niet bevredigd zijn, dan kan een mens geen vrije keuzes maken. Als de consequentie van een keuze verhongeren, de dood of letsel is dan kan men geen werkelijke keuze maken. Zekerheid creëert op zijn beurt echter wel afhankelijkheid: als mensen afhankelijk zijn van de regering voor hun essentiële behoeften, dan voelen ze zich gedwongen om te gehoorzamen. Zekerheid lijkt noodzakelijk te zijn voor vrijheid en toch ondermijnt het vrijheid. De oplossing voor dit dilemma is dat als overheidsbeleid zelfvoorziening promoot in plaats van afhankelijkheid dan zouden mensen niet afhankelijk worden. Ze krijgen dan wel de noodzakelijke beperkingen op vrijheid die samengaan met afhankelijkheid. Maar volledige zelfvoorziening lijkt een valse belofte. Vrijheid voor iedereen die voor zichzelf kan zorgen is niet de beste oplossing. Formele rechten zijn de beste manier om de vrijheid van degene voor wie de zekerheid garanderen te beschermen. Wanneer zou de regering mensen moeten behoeden tot het vrijwillig handelen op manieren die de mensen schaadt? Is het wel legitiem om mensen te dwingen iets te doen tegen hun wil om zo hun eigenbelang te bevredigen? Moeten regeringen dus vrijheid inperken om zekerheid te bieden? Het gaat er dus om of het doel van zekerheid belangrijker mag zijn dan het doel van individuele vrijheid. Mill zou hierop antwoorden: nooit. Hij heeft echter wel 1 uitzondering gemaakt: de maatschappij kan legitiem mensen helpen te voorkomen van het aangaan van contracten waarin ze zichzelf slaven maken, zelfs als niemand behalve de slaaf schade ondervindt van het contract. Hij vindt dat men met het aangaan van zo’n contract zijn vrijheid opgeeft en het beschermen van de individuele vrijheid is het doel van de verbiedende paternalisme. Maar kan een persoon ertoe worden gezet om vrij te zijn? Veel regeringen hebben beleid gemaakt dat gebaseerd is op deze logica. Er zijn meer voorbeelden die gelijk staan aan slavernij: het beëindigen van je eigen leven, verbod van drugs en alcohol. Je zou paternalisme ook kunne toestaan voor bepaalde categorieën van mensen. Kinderen en mentaal incompetente zijn vaak doelen van paternalistisch beleid: ze worden gedwongen in het doen van zaken ‘voor hun eigen bestwil’ en mogen andere vrijheden weer niet uitoefenen. Mill voegde hier aan ‘achterwaartse maatschappijen’ toe waarmee hij bedoelde dat bepaalde categorieën een uitzondering zijn omdat zij toch niet in staat zijn om te beraadslagen en betekenisvolle keuzes te maken. Deze mensen en groepen zijn dus een uitzondering en worden uitgezonderd van bepaalde rechten en vrijheden die andere mensen hebben. Paternalisme kan dus gerechtvaardigd worden voor sommige mensen waarbij ze niet in staat zijn om de werkelijke vrijheden uit te oefenen. Dit is echter erg vatbaar voor interpretatie en manipulatie. De discussie laait steeds weer op als iemand een einde wil maken aan zijn eigen leven, maar de familieleden op een gegeven moment het verzoek hiertoe indienen omdat de patiënt dit zelf niet meer kan. Uit onderzoek in Amerika bleek dat rechters dan kijken naar de uitingen die gedaan zijn door de patiënt toen hij/zij nog in staat was ze te doen. Rechters bleken eerder de uitingen van mannen te geloven en de uitingen van vrouwen af te doen als emotioneel en niet redelijk of rationeel. De categorische resolutie van de paternalisme dilemma (het definiëren van de categorieën van mensen die niet in staat zijn om hun vrijheden uit te oefenen) is dus niet echt duidelijk en gaat verder dan de politiek. Een andere benadering van paternalisme is het oude verhaal van Ulysses: ‘Ulysses contract’. Ulysses dacht dat hij de Sirenes niet zou kunnen weerstaan. Hij heeft zichzelf toen aan de mast van zijn schip vastgebonden en zijn mannen bevolen om hem niet te gehoorzamen als hij later zou smeken om losgemaakt te worden. De filosoof Dworkin oordeelde later dat paternalisme gerechtvaardigd is als een rationeel individu vooraf zou instemmen met het beperken van zichzelf. Er zijn wel gevaren in zijn theorie: er is een verschil tussen iemand zijn verzoek respecteren om op een bepaalde manier behandeld te worden en het hem toerekenen van zijn wens door te bekijken wat een rationeel mens zou willen. De verhouding tussen vrijheid en gelijkheid Zoals we in hoofdstuk 2 hebben gezien zijn vrijheid en gelijkheid onverenigbaar. De verhouding is als volgt: mensen hebben verschillende talenten, vaardigheden en mogelijkheden om waardevolle middelen en kansen in de maatschappij te zien en te pakken. Om gelijkheid te behouden, regeringen moeten bepaalde middelen en posities weghalen bij bepaalde mensen en deze aan andere geven. Dit bemoeit zich echter met de vrijheid om te handelen hoe je wilt van de mensen die de middelen in eerste instantie hadden. Als je er zo naar kijkt dan kijk je er naar vanuit een negatief concept van vrijheid: de absentie van dwang. Je kunt vrijheid ook zien als de mogelijkheid om betekenisvolle keuzes te maken en de mogelijkheid van capaciteit om het uit te voeren. Dit is een positief concept: vrijheid is uitgebreid op het moment als een persoon meer controle heeft over zijn of haar leven. Er zijn 2 aspecten van controle: het scala van onderwerpen of problemen waarover iemand controle over kan uitoefenen en de middelen, zowel materiële als niet materiële, die ervoor zorgen dat iemand alternatieven kan voorstellen en zijn of haar wil kan uitvoeren. Mensen van de positieve theorie kijken naar welke middelen noodzakelijk of nuttig zijn in het uitvoeren van effectieve keuzes: politieke rechten (actieve rechten zoals stemmen, participatie in besluitvorming en defensieve rechten zoals bescherming van vrije speech), rijkdom en kennis. Macht, rijkdom en kennis zijn voorwaarden voor vrijheid in de positieve theorie. Vrijheid is een graadmeter: personen met meer macht, rijkdom en kennis hebben meer vrijheid. In de negatieve theorie vrijheid is een alles of niets concept. Het gaat om ruimte of territorium waarin mensen wonen en waaromheen een hek staat om inbraken te voorkomen. Er zijn ook wel graden: hoe meer acties gedaan kunnen worden zonder bemoeienis, hoe groter de vrijheid. Als vrijheid gezien wordt als de mogelijkheid om keuzes te maken over serieuze zaken, dan zijn ongelijkheden in macht, rijkdom en kennis ook ongelijkheden in vrijheid. Een maatschappij dat vrijheid maximaliseert is er een dat de voorwaarden van vrijheid egaliseert. Maar zo’n ideale maatschappij bestaat niet. De positieve theorie verbindt individuen en sociale vrijheid. Menselijke controle wordt gezien als plastic en expansief. De verdeling van macht, rijkdom en kennis is het resultaat van sociaal gecreëerde arrangementen. Het centrale issue is dat niet wat voor schade voorkomen moet worden, maar welke beperkingen op de individuele vrijheid binnen het domein van de menselijke gemeenschap zich bevinden. Vrijheid in de negatieve theorie is de afwezigheid van dwang bij andere mensen. De fysieke of mentale beperkingen van een persoon worden gezien als een gegeven, net als het weer. Back to top Toelichting deel 3 Dit deel gaat over hoe problemen gedefinieerd en aangetoond worden in politiek. Er zijn geen vaste doelen of vaste posities in de politieke gemeenschap. Mensen vechten over welk concept politiek zou moeten regeren. De doelen van politiek zijn vaag, tegenstrijdig en veranderlijk. De status quo is ook instabiel. Probleemformulering is in de politieke gemeenschap nooit simpel een kwestie van het definiëren van doelen en het meten van onze afstand tot die doelen (huidige situatie vs. de gewenste situatie). Het gaat juist om de strategische vertegenwoordiging van situaties. Probleemformulering gaat om vertegenwoordiging omdat elke beschrijving van een situatie een vertoning is van maar 1 of juist van heel veel inzichten. Probleemformulering is strategisch omdat groepen, individuen en overheden bewust en opzettelijk de inzichten zo laten zien zodat de manier waar zij voorkeur voor hebben wordt gekozen. Vertegenwoordiging van een probleem is zo geconstrueerd zodat het de meeste mensen aan zijn kant krijgt en de meeste macht over tegenstanders krijgt. Elk hoofdstuk gaat over bepaalde termen hoe je beleidsproblemen kan definiëren: symbolen, getallen, oorzaken, belangen en beslissingen. Er is bestaat echter geen universele, wetenschappelijke of objectieve methode om problemen te definiëren. Problemen worden gedefinieerd in politiek en politieke actoren gebruiken verschillende methoden of taal voor het definiëren van een probleem. Back to top Hoofdstuk 6: Voor iets anders staan Dit hoofdstuk gaat over woorden en gaat vaak over fictie in plaats van echte beleidsanalyse. Het gaat om verhalen waar helden en schurken in voor komen: verhalen binden mensen. Symbolische vertegenwoordiging is de kern van probleem definiëren in politiek. Een symbool is iets dat staat voor iets anders. Zijn betekenis hangt af van hoe mensen het interpreteren, het gebruiken of er op reageren. Het kan bv een object, een persoon, een woord, een lid, een evenement zijn. Symbolen worden door ons allen gecreëerd. Een goed symbolisch instrument spreekt tot de verbeelding, vormt onze perceptie en haalt – in ieder geval tijdelijk - scepsis weg. Symbolen zijn middelen van invloed en controle. Vier aspecten van symbolische vertegenwoordiging zijn vooral belangrijk voor het definiëren van een probleem: verhalen, synecdoche, metaforen en ambiguïteit. Verhalen geven verklaringen over hoe de wereld werkt. Deze verklaringen zijn vaak onuitgesproken en breed gedeeld. Synecdoche zijn stijlfiguren waarin een deel gebruikt wordt om een groter geheel te vertegenwoordigen. Er wordt vaak beleid gemaakt aan de hand van voorbeelden waarvan we geloven dat die het geheel vertegenwoordigen. Metaforen zijn het essentiële van de menselijke gedachte en creativiteit en zijn belangrijk voor de classificatie en tellen. Als men een metafoor maakt, maakt men ook een politieke claim: ‘er is een mogelijkheid dat het belangrijk is’. Ambiguïteit is de capaciteit om meerdere betekenissen te hebben. Verhalen Een verhaal heeft een begin, een middenstuk en een eind. De verhaallijn in de politiek is vaak verborgen, maar het is er wel. Als er conflict is over details is er vaak onenigheid over de basis van het verhaal. Twee verhaallijnen komen vaak voor: verhaal van de achteruitgang en het verhaal van hulpeloosheid en controle. Het verhaal van de achteruitgang gaat er over dat in het begin alles goed was, maar toen ging het slechter en nu is het ondraaglijk. Er moet iets aan gedaan worden. Dit verhaal begint vaak met feiten die laten zien dat het fout is gegaan. Verhalen hoeven niet altijd mensen aan te grijpen. Elke probleemdefinitie heeft wel zijn eigen helden, schurken en onschuldige slachtoffers. Er zijn varianten op deze verhaallijn: de gedwarsboomde vooruitgang: in het begin was alles slecht, toen ging het iets beter omdat persoon X iets deed. Maar nu is iemand of iets zich met onze held aan het bemoeien, waardoor alles weer slecht gaat. En ook de variant dat verandering alleen maar een illusie is: je hebt altijd gedacht dat dingen slechter of juist beter zouden gaan, maar je had het mis. Men laat zien dat het in de tegenovergestelde richting gaat; neergang of juist verbetering was een illusie. Het verhaal van hulpeloosheid en controle gaat over dat de situatie slecht is en men altijd gedacht en geaccepteerd heeft dat de situatie buiten hun controle lag. Nu laat iemand zien dat je zaken wel in controle kunt hebben. Verhalen over controle gaan vaak over fundamentele problemen van vrijheid en grijpen de mens aan. De varianten hebben gemeen dat ze beweren dat er een keuze is. Deze keuze kan bij de maatschappij als geheel liggen, maar ook bij bepaalde mensen. Er zijn varianten: samenzwering en slachtoffer. De veelvoorkomende variant van dit verhaal is samenzwering: de macht blijkt in de handen te zijn van enkele die het hebben gebruikt voor hun eigen voordelen en het hebben afgeschermd van de rest. Geef het slachtoffer de schuldvariant gaat over dat de mensen die het probleem veroorzaken de controle krijgen. Men zegt bijvoorbeeld dat Derde wereld landen arm zijn omdat zij teveel lenen en bepaalde burgers te extravagant laten leven. Zieken zijn ziek omdat ze teveel eten, ongezond eten, roken en niet sporten. De verhalen geven hoop, verhaal 1 van de achteruitgang voedt juist angst en wanhoop. Ze zijn wel vaak verbonden met elkaar. Politieke verhalen zijn erg literair, ze hebben goede en slechte mensen, ze kijken veel naar statistieken. Synecdoche Dit is een stijlfiguur waarin een geheel vertegenwoordigd wordt door een deel van het geheel. Het komt vaak voor in de politiek dat een deel van een probleem vooral de aandacht krijgt en zo de beleidsreacties over dit deel van het probleem begrenst. Een vorm van synecdoche is de veelvoorkomende genre van het horrorverhaal. Politici kiezen vaak bewust voor een kolossaal of bizarre gebeurtenis die ze dramatiseren om alle gevallen mee aan te duiden om zo steun voor verandering te krijgen. Synecdoche kan er voor zorgen dat wij zelf niet meer kritisch denken. Het kan dus leiden tot een scheve politiek als er steeds gefocust wordt op 1 klein deel van het probleem. Maar het blijkt toch wel een nuttige strategie te zijn: je kunt er goed mee organiseren omdat het een probleem concreet kan maken. Mensen kunnen zich zo identificeren met een ander en woede mobiliseren. Het begrenst het probleem (en maakt de omvang kleiner) en maakt het zo beheersbaar. Metaforen Een metafoor is een impliciete vergelijking. Men gebruikt een woord dat een object of idee aanduidt maar zo een ander object beschrijft. Voorbeeld: ‘we smoren de industrie’. Ze zijn belangrijke instrumenten voor strategische vertegenwoordiging in politieke analyse. Ze lijken gewoon een vergelijking voor te stellen, maar ze impliceren een verhaal en een recept voor actie. In een metafoor is altijd een assumptie begraven dat als A is gelijk aan B, dan is de manier om A op te lossen te doen wat je bij B zou doen. A is gelijk aan B laat dus ook een interpretatie van gelijkheid zien. We zien metaforen ook veel in onze taal. Er zijn 5 meest frequente en overkoepelende metaforen in de politiek te onderscheiden: organisme, machines, containers, ziekten en oorlogen. Organisme: zo zien we organisaties als levende organisme, want ze hebben doelen en dergelijke. Een variant van de organisme metafoor is het idee van natuurlijke wetten van sociaal gedrag. Er zijn wetten die de sociale wereld beheersen en grenzen stellen aan veranderingen die mensen kunnen instellen door doelbewust beleid. G. Mosca en V. Pareto zeiden dat alle maatschappijen natuurlijk en onvermijdelijke verdeeld zijn in ‘regelaars’ en ‘de geregelde’, elites en geen elites. R. Michels formuleerde ‘de ijzeren wet van oligarchie’: all organisaties ontwikkelen zich onvermijdelijk naar een concentratie van politieke macht bij enkele leiders. De meest invloedrijke wet van sociaal gedrag komt van Charles Murray: ‘wet van onbedoelde beloningen’. Het helpen van mensen met problemen, zoals het geven van geld en services, beloont hen in werkelijkheid voor het hebben van problemen en het creëert een prikkel voor hen om zo te blijven. Machines (en mechanische instrumenten) zijn de basis van vele politieke metaforen, zoals checks and balances en de balans van macht. De metafoor van balans laat een verhaal zien over een achteruitgang van balans tot onbalans. Wiggen en hellingen zijn er veel in politieke taal. Overheidsbeleid wordt vaak zo gezien: wanneer ze eenmaal hun voet tussen de deur krijgen, zullen ze doorgaan met meer. Een klein begin kan groter gevolgen hebben. Een helling lat zien dat iets achteruit kan gaan en dan door de zwaartekracht snel achteruit wordt getrokken. Men noemt dit ook wel een hellend vlak waarin een eerste stap bijvoorbeeld een glas drinken voor een alcoholist is. Dit is de eerste stap in bedrog die leiden tot een hellend vlak. Hellend vlak argumenten gaan om het erkennen dat er een fenomeen is die niet verkeerd of slecht is (zoals een drankje), maar dat het toegeven aan het fenomeen tot situaties kan leiden die wel fout of slecht zijn. Containers is een andere groep van metaforen die gebaseerd is op containers en het idee van een vaste ruimte. Als een container gaten heeft, zal het gaan lekken. Als hij niet groot genoeg is krijg je spillovers. Oplossingen voor deze problemen zijn bijvoorbeeld dat men iets van de inhoud uit de container haalt, of het verminderen van de druk. Ziekten (vooral de besmettelijke varianten) vormen de basis voor meer politieke metaforen. Leden en voorstanders van een idee besmetten elkaar met hun ideeën. Ze impliceren een verhaal over verslechtering en neergang en over strijd voor controle tussen mensen en niet-menselijke bacteriën. Het beeld van de armen en minder bevoordeelden is de meest doordringende. Men ziet problemen vaak als uitkomsten van persoonlijke problemen en tekortkomingen. Deze symptomen maken de ziekten dus mentale ziektes. Net als alle metaforen creëert ook deze metafoor politieke middelen, zoals het diagnosticeren en het behandelen van de problemen. Oorlogen: we verklaren de oorlog aan heel veel zaken, zoals terrorisme de laatste jaren. Overleving staat op het spel en dus negeren we de kosten van de oorlog. Het symbool van de oorlog is een overduidelijke tactiek van onze leiders om zo support te creëren voor hun beleid. Probleemdefinitie in de politieke gemeenschap is altijd strategisch en zo ontworpen om versterkt aan iemands eigen kant in een conflict te krijgen. Strategische probleemdefiniëring betekent vaak het laten zien van een probleem zodat iemands eigen voorkeur goed naar voren komt. Strategische definiëren betekent ook het manipuleren van de omvang van een conflict door te laten zien alsof sommige mensen er erg geraakt door worden en anderen niet. Problemen worden niet zomaar gegeven en wachten niet in de wereld voor analisten die ze definiëren en oplossen. Ze worden gecreëerd in de hoofden van burgers door andere burgers, leiders, organisaties en overheidsinstellingen, als een essentieel onderdeel van politieke manoeuvreren. Ambiguïteit Het belangrijkste kenmerk van alle symbolen is de ambiguïteit. Een symbool kan twee of meer dingen tegelijk betekenen, een symbool kan verschillende dingen voor mensen betekenen en een symbool kan verschillende dingen in verschillende contexten zijn. Symbolen roepen om individuele verbeelding en ervaring. Ambiguïteit is een ban in de wetenschap. Voor de wetenschappelijke methoden moeten experimenten vaker in de tijd te doen zijn door meerdere observanten. De interpretatie van evenementen moet constant en ondubbelzinnig zijn en niet beïnvloed door de identiteit van de observant. In de politiek staat ambiguïteit centraal en dus is het meer zoals kunst dan zoals wetenschap. Ambiguïteit maakt een transformatie mogelijk van een individuele bedoeling en actie naar een collectief resultaat en doeleinden. Zonder ambiguïteit zouden samenwerking en compromissen moeilijk te bereiken zijn. Ambiguïteit zorgt voor steun van verschillende kanten voor een bepaald beleid, het zorgt dat leiders van belangengroepen en politieke bewegingen mensen kunnen samen brengen die hetzelfde willen. Het kan mensen ook verenigen die zouden profiteren van hetzelfde beleid maar om andere redenen. Ambiguïteit zorgt ervoor dat leiders kunnen uitzoeken wat er verborgen is gebleven voor het publiek: mensen kunnen iets doen aan een probleem door het erbij pakken van een vaag statuut met een dubbelzinnige betekenis en er de details uithalen die conflicteren. Ambiguïteit laat beleidsmakers beide kanten van een conflict gunstig te stemmen. Ambiguïteit bevordert onderhandeling en compromissen omdat het ervoor kan zorgen dat tegenstanders de overwinning kunnen claimen door een enkele resolutie. In onderhandeling moeten beide kansen het gevoel hebben dat ze beter worden van een overeenkomst dan zonder een overeenkomst. De meeste kanten van een overeenkomst hebben symbolische waarden waardoor dit door de partijen anders kan worden opgevat. Onderhandelaars kunnen ondubbelzinnige getallen ook in dubbelzinnige zaken veranderen. Ambiguïteit kan individuen helpen om hun eigen ambivalent en inconsistente houdingen met elkaar te verzoenen zodat ze ondersteuning kunnen bieden aan leiders en beleid. Samenvattend, de ambiguïteit van symbolen helpt om individuele pogingen om te zetten in collectieve beslissingen. Symbolen laten coalities toe waar pure materiële belangen mensen zouden scheiden. Ze zorgen ervoor dat leiders een brede basis aan steun zoeken voor beleid. Ze maken onderhandelingen makkelijker. In alle manieren is het zo dat politiek de wetten van de poëzie naleeft in plaats van de wetten van de materie: een programma of speech kan twee dingen tegelijk betekenen. Politieke verhalen zijn instrumenten van strategie. Back to top Hoofdstuk 7: De taal van tellen Dit hoofdstuk gaat over de taal van tellen. Samen met het hoofdstuk over symbolen zijn het de twee meest belangrijke termen: ze zijn essentieel voor elk raamwerk over probleemformulering. Een politiek probleem kun je definiëren door het te meten, er zijn echter oneindige manieren om met getallen dingen te beschrijven en definiëren: dingen hebben namelijk veel kenmerken die je kunt meten. De keuze welke je gaat meten hangt af van het doel van de meting. Tellen heeft altijd te maken met een bewuste keuze over het tellen op zich: als je appels moet tellen, moeten we het eerst over eens worden wat wel en wat geen appels zijn. We categoriseren door het selecteren van belangrijke kenmerken en het vragen of het object net als de andere objecten in die categorie is: het gaat om het bepalen van de grenzen in de vorm van regels of criteria die vertellen waar wat hoort. Tellen heeft te maken met politiek en politieke termen. Zo is het niet mogelijk om het over tellen te hebben zonder inclusie en exclusie, selectie en belangrijke kenmerken. Het was ook niet mogelijk om het over de doelen van publiek beleid te hebben zonder het gebruiken van de taal van tellen. Getallen als metaforen: werken eigenlijk net als metaforen: om te categoriseren in metingen of in metaforen moet bij beide 1 kenmerk van iets gekozen worden, een gelijkenis gevonden op basis van dat kenmerk en alle andere kenmerken moeten genegeerd worden. Een telling vereist een oordeel over een inclusie en exclusie. Daarom zijn telschema’s altijd onderworpen aan twee mogelijke uitdagingen: er is een gelijkenis in het schema terwijl de meting een verschil vindt en het schema raadt inclusie aan, terwijl de meting exclusie aanraadt. Er is een werkelijk verschil terwijl de meting een gelijkenis vindt, en er wordt een exclusie aangeraden terwijl de meting het erbij wil betrekken. Elk getal is een bewering over gelijkenissen en verschillen. Geen enkel nummer is onschuldig, omdat het onmogelijk is om te tellen zonder te oordelen over de categorieën. Elk getal is een politieke claim over waar de grens wordt gesteld. Projecties, correlaties, simulaties en elk andere manipulatie van getallen leunen op de beslissing over ‘tellen als’ dat in elk getal zit, zodat zij ook claims zijn over gelijkenissen en verschillen. En gelijkenissen en verschillen zijn de ultieme basis voor besluiten in politiek beleid. Getallen als normen en symbolen: metingen laten een behoefte aan actie zien; we meten niet iets als we de dingen niet willen veranderen of we ons gedrag willen veranderen als reactie tot de dingen. We voorspellen toch het weer omdat we willen weten wanneer we een paraplu nodig hebben? Om verandering te bevorderen is de eerste stap het vragen om een meting of enquête. De meting zelf wordt dan op een bepaald niveau de norm. Net als normen zijn ook getallen deel van een verhaal over hulpeloosheid en controle. De normen die bepaald zijn door de metingen zijn soms dubbelzinnig. In politiek zijn veel metingen zwaarden die aan twee kanten snijden: het is goed om hoog te scoren, maar ook goed om laag te scoren. Dit is een ambiguïteit in getallen en het gebeurt als de dingen die we meten symbolen zijn en geen objecten. Sparen symboliseert bijvoorbeeld een spaarzaamheid, maar ook een verloren zaak (je had het vroeger kunnen uitgeven). Belangrijker dan de getallen zelf, zijn de manieren waarop de metingen geïnterpreteerd worden. Je kunt hetzelfde zeggen van kosten; hoge kosten zien we als iets slechts, want efficiëntie gaat over het zo min mogelijk betalen voor zo veel mogelijk. Maar voor veel goederen en services zijn hoge kosten een symbool van hoge kwaliteit of prestige. De een vindt het zonde om zo veel geld uit te geven, de ander ziet de kwaliteit als een belangrijker aspect. Het is op een andere manier ook nog dubbel te zien: kosten voor kopers, zijn inkomsten voor verkopers. Efficiëntie en productiviteit kun je ook zo zien. Hoe meer efficiëntie en productiviteit hoe beter hoeft niet altijd zo te zijn. Door al deze zaken worden gemiddelden normen de normen in de politiek: men neemt genoegen met middelmatig. Politici exploiteren de ambiguïteit en positieve betekenis van het idee van ‘middelmatig’. In getallen zitten vaak verborgen verhalen. Getallen zijn de voornaamste taal als we het hebben over achteruitgang en verval. Statistieken zijn de meest voorkomende vorm om causale relaties te identificeren geworden. Getallen worden aangeroepen om verhalen te waarmerken. Getallen vertellen dus expliciete verhalen, maar ook de impliciete zijn belangrijk. De handelingen van tellen en publiceren brengen verborgen boodschappen over, onafhankelijk van de echte getallen. Iets dat geteld moet worden is frequent genoeg om te tellen. Een fenomeen is gebruikelijk, regulier en verwacht. Iets moet ook een identificeerbare identiteit zijn, met duidelijke grenzen. Iets tellen creëert een politieke gemeenschap; de dingen die geteld worden delen een kenmerk en moeten als een groep behandeld worden. In de politieke gemeenschap is tellen vaak een deel van de opzettelijke inspanning om een natuurlijke politieke gemeenschap te stimuleren door het identificeren van statistische gegevens om zo gezamenlijke interesses te laten zien. Tellen creëert dus groepen. Het is dus een essentieel instrument van politieke mobilisatie. Om kenmerken of problemen die gelijk zijn tussen individuen te identificeren moeten mensen in groepen worden ingedeeld, hoe kunstmatig dit eerst ook lijkt. Getallen zijn vaak een belofte van conflict resolutie door middel van rekenkunde. Getallen zijn instrumenten voor het verdelen, wegen en balanceren. Justice Blackmun en de vraag of vrouwen het recht hebben op abortus is hier een voorbeeld van. Blackmun zette twee briljante rekenkundige stappen: hij bundelde de bezorgdheid in twee ‘belangen’ (het belang van de vrouw in haar leven en die van de regering in prenatale leven). Hij kon ze nu wegen en naast elkaar zetten. Hij verdeelde een zwangerschap in 3 trimesters: hoe verder de zwangerschap is hoe groter het belang van de staat ten opzichte van die van de moeder. Als een fenomeen dus omgezet is in kwantificeerbare eenheden kan het worden toegevoegd, vermenigvuldigd, verdeeld of afgetrokken. Getallen zijn dus ook symbolen van precisie, nauwkeurigheid en objectiviteit. Het maken van getallen in de politieke gemeenschap Metingen verrichten in de politieke gemeenschap is een complex sociaal proces. Getallen in de politiek zijn metingen van menselijke activiteiten, gemaakt door mensen en bedoeld om menselijk gedrag te beïnvloeden. Het meten van sociale fenomenen verschilt van het meten van fysieke objecten, omdat mensen reageren op het feit dat ze gemeten worden. Als mensen weten dat ze gemeten worden proberen ze de resultaten te beïnvloeden. Metingen bevatten altijd bepaalde impliciete normen en mensen willen weten of hun eigen metingen deze normen halen. Metingen zorgen dat mensen een rol gaan spelen en zich sociaal goed opstellen. Deze veranderingen in gedrag die men dan ziet noemt men wel reactieve effecten en reactiviteit is zo doordringend tussen organisaties als het is tussen individuen. Reactiviteit vloeit voort uit twee van de centrale kenmerken van de politieke gemeenschap: invloed en de te interpreteren aard van informatie. Tellen en meten vereist kijken en denken: het proces focust de aandacht van mensen dus op de dingen die gemeten worden. Als je dingen gaat bij houden zie je ineens hoe het werkelijk ziet en kun je zelf dingen anders in je hoofd hebben. Het bijhouden van de gegevens is goed voor de vroegere fasen van een politiek issue. Veel publieke problemen zijn vaak dingen die lang getolereerd zijn geweest: alcoholisme of misbruik van kinderen bijvoorbeeld. Een drastische groei in deze problemen laat een achteruitgang zien in de sociale tolerantie van deze fenomenen. In publiek beleid zijn metingen expliciet evalueerbaar en worden ze gebruikt om te bepalen hoe mensen en organisaties behandeld worden. Als mensen gemeten worden in de gemeenschap dan staat er meer op het spel dan alleen hun zelfbeeld en verlangen om te behagen: hun geloof staat op het spel. Sommige metingen evalueren prestaties en bepalen zo de beloningen of straffen. Andere evalueren behoeften. Mensen hebben dus een grote behoefte om metingen in de politieke gemeenschap te manipuleren. Reactiviteit en het begrijpen ervan is dus erg belangrijk in beleidsanalyse omdat het een kenmerk is dat onlosmakelijk verbonden is met sociale metingen. In politiek is het bijna niet mogelijk om de mensen die gemeten worden en de mensen die meten van elkaar te scheiden. Het grootste deel van metingen dat gedaan wordt zijn officiële statistieken, die verzameld en geanalyseerd zijn door instituten wiens prestaties worden bekeken. Zelfs als is de onderzoeker organisatorisch ver weg van degenen die gemeten worden, dan is de verspreiding nominaal. Als een organisatie namelijk een andere organisatie bestudeert dan brengt dit de organisatie in relatie met een verhouding van samenwerking en invloed. Onderzoekers hebben ook macht over het lot van degenen die onderzocht worden omdat metingen gedaan worden om te bepalen welke acties gedaan moeten worden. Een voorbeeld is de chequeschrijven oplichting: in een relatie waarin een meting plaats vindt kan het ding dat geteld wordt een goed worden dat strategisch geruild wordt tussen de onderzoeker en degene die onderzocht wordt. Dit gebeurt alleen als de onderzoeker beloond of gestraft wordt voor het vinden van delen van het ding dat geruild wordt. Alle regelgevende instanties zitten in deze positie: ze bekijken of het gedrag van een bepaald bedrijf goed is door naar overtredingen te kijken, maar worden ook aangemoedigd en beloond door de regering voor het vinden van overtredingen. Bedrijven kiezen bepaalde getallen om hun probleem in uit te drukken, bijvoorbeeld om geld te krijgen van investeerders. Bedrijven kunnen de waarde van hun middelen ook manipuleren. Metingen laten ook bepaalde oplossingen tot problemen zien. Metingen in de politieke gemeenschap zijn niet alleen strategisch geselecteerd maar ook strategisch gepresenteerd. Getallen op zich zeggen niks in een politiek debat: ze zijn aangekleed met woorden en symbolen en zitten in verhalen. Getallen in politieke debatten kunnen niet begrepen worden zonder te peilen hoe ze geproduceerd worden door mensen. Mensen veranderen de activiteiten die gemeten worden steeds; ze willen de metingen beïnvloeden. Metingen verandert de manier waarop mensen tellen, omdat hun metingen beïnvloeden hoe zij, niet alleen de personen die gemeten worden, behandeld worden. De keuze van metingen is deel van het definiëren van een strategisch probleem. Als getallen artefacten van het politieke leven zijn en als zij zelf metaforen, symbolen en verhalen zijn, zijn ze dan wel ‘echt’? getallen zijn altijd beschrijvingen van de wereld en als beschrijvingen zijn ze niet echter dan de visies of gedichten of schilderijen. Maar de dominantie van getallen als een manier van beschrijven van de maatschappij in discussies van het publieke beleid is een recentelijk, en misschien ook wel tijdelijk, fenomeen van culturele geschiedenis en niet het resultaat van onderliggende realiteit van getallen. Back to top Hoofdstuk 8: Hoe een probleem ontstaat Dit hoofdstuk gaat over de taal van oorzaken, effecten en verantwoordelijkheid. Het gaat over hoe een probleem ontstaan is. Oorzaken gaan ook over wie de schuld heeft: ze laten zien wie verantwoordelijk was. Het behandelen van de symptomen van een probleem is niet genoeg; je moet echt de oorzaken aanpakken. Causale analyse is echter moeilijk, beleidsproblemen zijn complex en we begrijpen vaak de onderliggende causale processen onvoldoende. Maar iedereen is het er over eens: je kan een probleem niet oplossen zonder eerst de onderliggende reden of oorzaken van het probleem te vinden. Oorzaken zijn objectief en kunnen bewezen worden door wetenschappelijk onderzoek. Er zijn verwachte oorzaken en werkelijke oorzaken. Causaal redeneren is in de politieke gemeenschap soms moeilijk vanuit een mechanistisch model. In politiek zoeken we naar oorzaken om niet alleen te begrijpen hoe de wereld werkt, maar ook om verantwoordelijkheden voor problemen aan te wijzen. Om een oorzaak in de gemeenschap te ontdekken, plaatsen we dus een last op bepaalde mensen en niet op anderen. In de gemeenschap worden causale verhalen gemaakt met symbolen en getallen en dan worden ze beweerd door politieke spelers die proberen hun eigen versie van deze basis van politieke keuzes te maken. Causale verhalen zijn essentiële politieke instrumenten om allianties te vormen en de verdeling van voordelen en kosten te regelen. Causale verhalen Er zijn twee primaire raamwerken voor het interpreteren van de wereld: de natuurlijke en de sociale. In de natuurlijke vinden wij gebeurtenissen ongericht, niet georiënteerd, ongeleid en puur fysiek. Er zijn natuurlijke determinanten (het weer), maar er is geen moedwillige intentie achter deze gebeurtenissen. De natuurlijke wereld is het rijk van vertrouwen en ongevallen. Als we de volgorde van evenementen kunnen bepalen waardoor het een tot het ander leidt, dan hebben we een goed beeld van de oorzaken. In de sociale wereld begrijpen wij dat evenementen het resultaat zijn van de wil van mensen of van dieren. De sociale wereld is het rijk van controle en doel. Als we de doelen en motieven van een persoon kunnen linken aan de doelen van hun acties dan hebben we een goed begrip van de oorzaken. Beïnvloeding werkt. In de natuurlijke wereld heeft beïnvloeding geen zin. Causaliteit: de blinde werking van de natuur (oneindig lange keten van veroorzaakte en veroorzakende effecten) en de bewuste effecten van mensen (iets dat op een bepaalde manier begint met een mentale beslissing). In politiek is het verschil tussen acties die een doel hebben (wil of motivatie) en die dat niet hebben cruciaal. Ook het verschil tussen effecten/invloeden die bewust zijn en die dat niet zijn is belangrijk. Deze twee dimensies: actie vs. consequenties en doel vs. geen doel, kunnen gebruikt worden om een raamwerk te creëren voor het beschrijven van causale verhalen in de politiek. Als je de verschillende typen herkent kun je analyseren hoe politieke actoren strategisch bepaalde zaken vertegenwoordigen door hen in te delen als verschillende types van causale verhalen, of door hen van de ene box naar de andere te schuiven. Een opzettelijke actie en een ongeleide consequentie heeft een mechanische oorzaak. Het gaat in deze categorie om tussenliggende agenten die ingrijpen, om mensen die gehersenspoeld zijn en om machines die werken zoals ze ontworpen zijn, maar schade veroorzaken. Deze zaken hebben geen eigen wil, maar zijn zo ontworpen, geprogrammeerd of getraind door mensen dat ze bepaalde consequenties hebben. Iemand doet iets bewust, maar hun wil wordt dan uitgevoerd door anderen, in dit geval door machines. De handelingen worden indirect begeleid door een tussenliggende agent. Een conflict gaat vaak over of een bepaalde persoon zijn of haar eigen wil nastreeft of mechanisch de wil van anderen nastreeft. Als de aard van menselijke controle over andere mensen problematisch is, dan is dat ook met menselijke controle over machines. Een opzettelijke actie en een doelbewuste consequentie heeft een bewuste oorzaak. Het gaat in deze categorie om onderdrukking, samenzweringen en programma’s die precies zo werken zoals ze bedoeld zijn, maar die toch schade aanrichten. Dit is de meest krachtige offensieve strategie die iemand in kan nemen: het legt de schuld direct bij iemand neer. Problemen of schade wordt gezien als directe consequenties van opzettelijk menselijk handelen. Als de consequenties goed worden gezien, dan noemen we deze domein rationele actie. Als de consequenties niet goed zijn, dan krijgen we verhalen te horen van onderdrukkers en slachtoffers. Problemen zijn het resultaat van bewuste, maar verborgen menselijk handelen. Een niet opzettelijke actie en een ongeleide consequentie is een oorzaak die per ongeluk ontstond. Natuurrampen, zoals overstromingen en aardbevingen, maar ook het weer vallen hier onder. Ook vallen hier machines onder die ineens stuk gaan. Het zijn allemaal geen activiteiten, maar eerder gebeurtenissen. Het gaat om ongeluk en geluk. Een niet opzettelijke actie en een doelbewuste consequentie heeft een onbedoelde oorzaak. Het gaat hier om tussenliggende condities, om onvoorziene neveneffecten, vermijdbare onwetendheid, onvoorzichtigheid en roekeloosheid. Dit zijn de onbedoelde consequenties van gewild menselijk handelen. Soms heeft bewust beleid wel schadelijke neveneffecten: de consequenties zijn voorspelbaar, maar nog wel steeds onvoorzienbaar. Dit vak is een veel voorkomende interpretatie van armoede, ondervoeding en ziekten. De armen realiseren zich niet voldoende hoe belangrijk onderwijs is. Onoplettendheid is hier onwetendheid. Gewone mensen begrijpen de schadelijke consequenties van hun handelen niet, zelfs al zijn de consequenties voorspelbaar door experts. Een ander type van onoplettendheid is onvoorzichtigheid of roekeloosheid. Dit gaat uit van beelden van een enkele actor, een enkele actie en een direct resultaat. Maar veel problemen vereisen een meer complex model van oorzaken om een uitleg te krijgen waar men tevreden mee is. Er zijn meerdere modellen van complexe oorzaken, hier worden er 3 uitgelegd: complexe systemen, institutioneel en historisch. De sociale systemen die noodzakelijk zijn om problemen op te lossen zijn ook complex. In complexe interactieve systemen is het niet mogelijk om op alle evenementen en effecten te anticiperen. Dit model voorziet een sociaal probleem als veroorzaakt door een web van grote langdurige organisaties met ingewortelde patronen van gedrag. Sociale patronen hebben de neiging zichzelf te herhalen. Mensen met macht en middelen om het probleem te kunnen stoppen halen voordelen uit de sociale organisatie en middelverdeling die hen aan de macht houdt. Ze houden zo de patronen door controle over de selectie van de elites en socialisatie van zowel elites als non-elites. Modellen van complexe oorzaak functioneren vaak als per ongeluk of uit natuurlijke oorzaak. Ze zijn hierdoor wat onschuldig omdat niemand echt controle kan hebben over het hele systeem. De grootste spanning tussen sociale wetenschappen en praktijken in de echte wereld zijn dat sociale wetenschappers de neiging hebben om complexe oorzaken van sociale problemen te zien. Terwijl men in de politiek zoekt naar onmiddellijke en simpele oorzaken. In de politiek zijn causale theorieën niet goed of fout, ook zijn ze niet wederzijds uitsluitend. Het creëren van oorzaken in de gemeenschap De tabel hierboven over acties en consequenties kan als kaart worden gebruikt om te laten zien hoe politieke actoren een issue van een bepaalde territorium naar een andere duwen in een strijd om politieke macht. Twee posities zijn erg sterk: de oorzaak die per ongeluk ontstond en de bewuste oorzaak. De eerste gaat over dat er geen menselijke verantwoordelijkheid is, de tweede over directe controle en weten welke actie tot volledige verantwoordelijkheid leidt. De andere twee zijn zwakker: mechanische en onbedoelde oorzaken. De eerste gaat over menselijke controle bemiddeld door andere mensen, machines of systemen en de tweede gaat over verhalen van actie zonder volledige kennis en informatie. Een veelvoorkomende strategie in causale politiek is om te zeggen dat de effecten van een actie eigenlijk in het geheim ook echt de bedoelde doelen van de actor waren. De samenzweringstheorie is hier een versie van. De rationele keuze theorie is een andere variant. Deze laatste theorie gaat er van uit dat wat mensen ook doen, hun gedrag is voor een groot deel het resultaat van bewust (of onbewust) weloverwogen keuze tussen alternatieven. Aannemen dat de effecten van een actie ook de doelen zijn wordt de teleologische misvatting genoemd. Doelen moeten worden bewezen met bewijs van een actor zijn of haar wens of motieven, los van de effecten van de handelingen of acties. Het concept van risico is een strategisch wapen geworden om een probleem niet meer als ongeluk te zien maar als doel. Complexe oorzaken worden soms gebruikt als strategie om schuld en de lasten van hervorming te vermijden. In de politieke gemeenschap moet men vechten voor causale verhalen, men moet deze verdedigen en behouden. Er is altijd iemand die een ander verhaal vertelt en om mensen je te laten geloven is niet altijd makkelijk. Conservatieven houden mensen verantwoordelijk voor problemen zoals ziekten en armoede. Liberalen houden eerder de maatschappij of organisaties verantwoordelijk. De televisie, met name nieuws, vormt de verhalen en hierdoor de publieke opinie en acceptatie van verhalen. Geaccepteerd worden door het algemene publiek is 1 test van succes voor een causaal verhaal, maar de ultieme test van politieke succes is te zien of het verhaal het dominante geloof wordt en de assumpties voor beleidsmakers gaat beheersen. Een causaal verhaal is eerder succesvol als het voorstanders heeft die zichtbaar zijn, veel in de media of op prominente posities zitten, het met culturele waarden overeenkomst en als het niet te radicaal is in het (her)verdelen van inkomen en macht. De politieke successen van causale theorieën is beperkt door twee machtige sociale instituties voor het bepalen van oorzaak en legitieme claims over schade: recht en wetenschap. Het gebruiken van oorzaken in de politieke gemeenschap Causale theorieën hebben meerdere functies. Ze kunnen: bestaande sociale orde uitdagen of beschermen, door het identificeren van causale agenten kunnen ze verantwoordelijkheden toewijzen aan bepaalde politieke actoren, bepaalde actoren legitimeren of extra macht geven als oplossers van het probleem en nieuwe politieke allianties creëren tussen mensen die in dezelfde slachtofferrelatie zitten ten opzichte van de causale agent. Iets onder de aandacht van mensen brengen zet vaak druk op bestaande oude hiërarchieën van gezondheid, status of privilege. Zo werd er ooit een oplossing bedacht voor de boekworm ziekte: mensen werden er lui en moe van. Elites konden mensen nu niet meer lui en stom noemen en zichzelf ophemelen omdat ze zo hard aan het werk waren. Een causale theorie kan dus een sociale orde flink doen schudden. Het gaat er in de politiek om welke causale factoren men gaat aanpakken. In het geval van dronken rijden wordt de schuld door het recht en culturele waarden bij de dronken automobilist neergelegd, ook al zou het ook aan de techniek van de auto hebben kunnen liggen. Ook al is er een logische link tussen een substantie en een probleem (bv alcohol en ongelukken), er zijn altijd vele plekken om de controle en sancties neer te leggen. Het gaat eigenlijk om de morele verantwoordelijkheid. Causale verhalen leggen de schuld bij mensen, maar geven mensen ook macht die de middelen, vaardigheden en technieken hebben om een probleem op te lossen. Het veranderen van de plek van verantwoordelijkheid op een causale lijn kan allianties vormen. De dronken automobilist wordt ineens ook een slachtoffer, net als de mensen die gewond zijn geraakt door hem. Er was een nalatigheid dat buiten hem om lag. De relatie tussen verkoopplekken en consumenten is veranderd, omdat elke consument een potentiële aansprakelijkheid is. De verkooppunten vormen dan wellicht nieuwe allianties met andere anti-reguleringsgroepen. Er kunnen allianties worden gevormd omdat mensen een bepaalde risico factor delen, maar verder geen associatie hebben. Causale theorieën kunnen dus zowel een stimulans zijn voor politieke organisatie als een middel voor politieke leiders die allianties proberen te bouwen. Causale theorieën zijn inspanningen om interpretaties en beelden van moeilijkheden te beheersen. Actoren creëren causale verhalen om schade en moeilijkheden te beschrijven, hen aan acties te linken van andere individuen en organisaties en zich zo op de macht van de regering te beroepen om schade te stoppen. Back to top Hoofdstuk 9: Wat men graag wil Dit hoofdstuk gaat over problemen die worden neergezet als een wedstrijd tussen concurrerende belangen. Het gaat over het goed en het kwaad. Het gaat hier om groepen die een belang hebben in een bepaalde issue of erdoor geraakt worden. Effecten, in de taal van de beleidsanalyse, zijn er om ontdekt te worden. Belangen, in de taal van politiek, zijn de actieve kanten van effecten, de resultaat van mensen die effecten ervaren of verbeelden en ze proberen te beïnvloeden. Effecten worden pas van belang wanneer ze vertaald worden in behoeften. Concepten van belangen Er is een verschil tussen echte belangen: welke problemen en behoeften mensen hebben, en politieke behoeften: wat mensen verlangen van de regering. Er is een onderscheid tussen een passieve situatie (dat je geraakt door iets wordt) en een actieve (het proberen te beïnvloeden). De overgang van de eerste naar de tweede gaat niet automatisch en is niet makkelijk. Mensen twijfelen namelijk over hun eigen belangen. Daarom wordt er wel onderscheid gemaakt tussen objectieve en subjectieve belangen. Objectieve belangen zijn die effecten die van invloed zijn op mensen, ongeacht of mensen bewust van ze zijn. Subjectieve belangen zijn die dingen waarvan mensen geloven dat ze hen raken en gevolgen voor ze hebben. In onze taal zeggen we dan ook: ‘het hebben van een belang’ als objectief om te laten zien dat het ze raakt, en het innemen van een standpunt/belang’ als subjectief om te laten zien dat mensen actief aandacht besteden er aan. Als objectieve belangen in subjectieve belangen worden omgezet dan spreken liberalen van politieke bewust worden en Marxisten van de ontwikkeling van het bewustzijn. Er zijn twee vormen van fouten: mensen worden door iets beïnvloed, maar realiseren dit niet, of ze worden niet beïnvloed door iets maar geloven van wel. Dit laatste noemen we false consciousness. De twee fouten gaan vaak samen. Objectieve en subjectieve belangen gaan dan ook samen. Hoe objectieve belangen de subjectieve belangen bepalen wordt zo besproken. De betekenis van objectieve belangen wordt nu eerst uitgelegd. Men kon het niet eens worden over de betekenis. Een theorie zegt dat een objectief belang een bepaalde actie of beleid is dat mensen het best zou dienen gegeven de effecten. Maar een persoon wordt op een bepaald moment door meer objectieve voorwaarden geraakt dan 1 en elke heeft andere effecten. Een andere benadering om naar objectieve belangen te kijken is als het identificeren van essentiële menselijke behoeften en aannemen dat het altijd in het belang van de persoon is om deze behoeften bevredigd te zien en tegen het belang in van hun belangen om ze af te wijzen. Weer een andere benadering heeft het over objectieve belangen als dat wat een persoon zou willen of een voorkeur voor heeft als hij of zij alle alternatieven kent en een vrije keuze kon maken. Dit wordt wel rationaliteit in vrijheid genoemd. Het is altijd in het belang van een persoon om keuzevrijheid te hebben. Deze benadering zorgt ook voor problemen: mensen hebben niet altijd alle relevante ervaring en moeten dus gokken welk alternatief het beste is. En we weten niet wanneer een persoon echt vrij is. Verschillende mensen in dezelfde situaties en met dezelfde informatie kiezen ook andere alternatieven en dus is dit weer erg subjectief. De Marxistische traditie zegt dat mensen belangen hebben in klassen en niet individueel. Bepaalde gemeenschappelijke situaties (zoals bezetting, ras of religie) hebben een overweldigende invloed op het welzijn van mensen en kansen in hun leven. Politiek en geschiedenis vormen het leven van mensen. Maar ook dit idee heeft bepaalde moeilijkheden: gemeenschappelijke problemen zijn makkelijker te zien dan gemeenschappelijke oplossingen. Men heeft niet altijd hetzelfde belang in een bepaalde oplossing: bepaalde mensen halen er meer voordelen uit dan anderen. Het is moeilijk te weten wat een belang van een groep of klasse is tenzij iemand dit heeft verteld. Er is geen algemene wil van een groep die zich heeft laten horen zonder de hulp van een mens (of een groep mensen) die het articuleren en verwoorden. Individuele belangen en groepsbelangen worden nooit alleen gevormd door sociaaleconomische kenmerken. Vertegenwoordiging is het proces waarin belangen gedefinieerd en geactiveerd worden in de politiek. Individuen kiezen een groep die hun belangen vertegenwoordigt. Er zijn twee vormen van vertegenwoordiging: artistieke en politieke. Belangen moeten worden begrepen als een voortvloeisel uit deze twee vormen. Het gaat er in de politieke gemeenschap om hoe de objectieve effecten en voorwaarden wordt waargenomen, geïnterpreteerd en opgevolgd. Er is een keuze op welke effecten we ons richten. Hoe effecten vertaald worden in belangen is een kwestie van het uitleggen waarom sommige effecten geselecteerd en benadrukt worden en hoe zij zowel artistiek en politiek gerepresenteerd worden. Het creëren van belangen in de politieke gemeenschap Het proces waarin effecten en ervaringen worden omgezet in georganiseerde inspanningen om verandering te krijgen wordt wel mobilisatie genoemd. Sommige belangen zijn sterker dan anderen en worden sneller gemobiliseerd. Alle potentiële problemen hebben een gelijke kans in het simuleren van politieke organisaties, maar mensen sparen hun energie door aandacht te vestigen om de dingen waar ze het meest om geven. De liberalen zeggen dat objectieve behoeften leiden tot politieke mobilisatie tenzij het proces geblokkeerd is. Ze zoeken dus voor obstakels, zoals onwetendheid. Marxisten zeggen dat bepaalde belangen belangrijker zijn dan anderen. Een bepaalde theorie van mobilisatie ziet het free-rider probleem als een groot obstakel: mensen hebben geen belang in het bij een groep horen en voor een collectief goed werken tenzij ze voordelen behalen uit het feit dat anderen er voor werken en succes boeken in het verkrijgen van de voordelen. Groepen kunnen alleen mobiliseren als ze bepaalde voordelen kunnen bieden exclusief aan bepaalde mensen. De belangen die het snelst worden gemobiliseerd zijn die belangen die de wil van individuele en private mensen bevredigen. Het free-rider probleem is in kleine groepen minder aan de orde: hier heerst druk van de groep en kameraadschap. De logica van collectief handelen geldt echter niet per se voor de gemeenschap. Als we kijken naar het gemeenschapsmodel dan zien we bepaalde krachten die zorgen voor mobilisatie voor gemeenschappelijke belangen. Deze maken het free-rider probleem minder belangrijk dan de markt logica laat zien. Dit komt allereerst omdat mensen in de gemeenschap zijn niet autonoom en leven niet geïsoleerd: ze worden beïnvloed door andere mensen die morele en sociale relaties creëren (waaronder leiderschap). Mensen participeren bijvoorbeeld in collectieve inspanningen omdat hun familie dat ook doet. Ten tweede komt dit omdat participatie in collectieve inspanningen de wetten van passie volgen in plaats van de wetten van materie. De beloning voor participatie komen eerder van de deelneming zelf dan van het bereiken van een doel. Collectieve actie in de politieke gemeenschap staat is een soort van competitiesport en geen koopjesjacht. De derde reden heeft te doen met het belang van symbolen en ambiguïteit. De logica van de collectieve actie theorie wordt laten zien als een collectief goed probleem maar elk politiek doel kan worden gezien als iets goeds dat verkregen moet worden en iets slechts dat vermeden moet worden. Mensen reageren verschillen op goede en slechte dingen. Mensen organiseren zich eerder rondom een dreiging of een verlies dan rond een potentiële win. Ze nemen meer risico om een verlies te voorkomen. De asymmetrie van potentiële verliezen en winnen in psychologie en politiek staat in grote contrast met een van de fundamentele assumpties van economische theorie: namelijk dat mogelijkheidskosten gelijkwaardig zijn aan elke andere kosten. Mogelijkheidskosten zijn toegerekende kosten van het iets niet doen, van het missen van een kans om bronnen te gebruiken in een manier dan de manier die gekozen is. Het verschil tussen werkelijke kosten en kans-kosten, tussen collectieve ‘goede’ en slechten, tussen verliezen en winsten zijn significant in de politiek. Een andere theorie van mobilisatie is die van het idee dat de substantie van een issue bepaald of en hoe organisaties betrokken raken in de promotie en uitbreiding van het idee. James Wilson gaat er van uit dat mensen eerder iets organiseren en er hard voor werken als het hen intensief raakt dan als iets hen alleen maar licht raakt. Hij heeft het over voordelen en kosten (goede en slechte effecten) en geconcentreerd en verspreid (de intensiteit of kracht van beleidseffecten). Geconcentreerd betekent verspreide effecten over een klein aantal mensen. Mate van concentratie heeft ook te maken met de mate waarin het leven van een persoon geraakt wordt. Wilson geeft antwoord op de vraag welke typen beleidseffecten leiden tot politieke mobilisatie: diffusie remt het en concentratie stimuleert het. Als zowel de voordelen als de kosten verspreid zijn dan spelen ze een gelijke wedstrijd. Beide geconcentreerd houdt in dat geen van de kanten sterk genoeg is om de ander te domineren en afwisselende overwinningen zijn het gevolg. Voorbeelden zijn: ziekenhuizen vs. zorgverzekeraars en kabel bedrijven vs. telecommunicatie bedrijven. Beide verspreid wil zeggen dat deze programma’s langzaam groeien, omdat gekozen wetgevers een prikkel hebben om breed verdeelde voordelen uit te delen. Voorbeelden zijn: de sociale zekerheid en verlaging van hypotheek voor huiseigenaar. Als of de kosten of de voordelen verspreid is en de ander geconcentreerd dan is er sprake van ongelijke wedstrijden. Als de kosten verspreid zijn, maar de voordelen geconcentreerd dan zal de groep die iets wil krijgen een grote inspanning monteren, terwijl de grootste groep waarvan de leden kleine delen verliezen, passief en ongeorganiseerd blijft. De aanbieders van deze services willen een grote vaste markt van klanten krijgen die kunnen betalen. De kosten van deze verplichte voordelen zijn verspreid over mensen die premies betalen. Voorbeelden zijn de verplichte zorgverzekering en voordelen voor veteranen. Als de kosten geconcentreerd zijn, maar de voordelen verspreid, dan zal georganiseerde tegenstand tegen aangekondigde kosten de potentiële winnaars, die zich moeilijk organiseren, makkelijk verslaan. Voorbeelden zijn: eten en medicatie regulatie, milieuregelingen en auto veiligheidregulatie. Dit alles laat zien dat de distributie van kosten en baten het type van politieke wedstrijd bepaalt. Hoe problemen en belangen elkaar bepalen Op de vraag: zijn bepaalde belangen in het algemeen sterker dan anderen? hebben we twee antwoorden gezien: de logica van collectieve actie theorie laat zien dat belangen die kunnen worden voldaan met individuele, deelbare en materiële middelen triomferen die belangen die voldaan moeten worden met collectieve, gedeelde en niet-materiële middelen. De theorie van Wilson, zijn verdeling-van-effecten theorie, laat zien dat de belangen van kleine minderheden die intens beïnvloed worden door iets, de belangen van grote meerderheiden die zo nu en dan worden beïnvloed door iets, domineren. Het centrale probleem in de democratische theorie is dat belangen die gezien worden als moreel gelijk, politiek ongelijk kunnen zijn. De goede, legitieme en deugdzame belangen zijn niet noodzakelijke de sterke. Daarom zijn de goede belangen niet altijd de belangen die naar boven komen, zij moeten hierom beschermd worden. De regering moet zwakke belangen beschermen. Democratische theorieën zijn het er niet over eens wat de zwakke dan zijn. Ze delen twee centrale veronderstellingen: goede belangen zijn te zwak om op zichzelf te bloeien en ten minste een belangrijke functie van regering is om deze belangen te bevorderen. Dit is een verschil tussen de markt en de politieke gemeenschap. Markt: sommige belangen zijn sterker dan anderen en de goede belangen zijn vaak de sterkere belangen. Goede belangen komen daarom naar voren in markt transacties zonder de bescherming van regering. Goed of zwakke belangen vs. slechte of sterke belangen zijn: collectieve vs. individuele, verspreide vs. geconcentreerde, brede vs. smalle, lange termijn vs. korte termijn, spiritueel vs. materialistisch, sociaal vs. economisch, publiek vs. speciaal en arbeiders vs. kapitalisten. Elk paar is een visie van een ongelijke politieke wedstrijd. Beide kanten willen veel macht, maar het is altijd de zwakste van de twee, de underdog, die hulp van buiten erbij haalt (zoals de regering). Groepen definiëren problemen op manieren waarop specifieke problemen algemene problemen worden. Zo splitsen ze de vermeende specifieke belangen of ze doen juist het omgekeerde: ze transformeren de hele smalle geconcentreerde belangen door potentiële winnaars of verliezen in een bredere klas van ‘iedereen’ te stoppen. Resumé: problemen worden in de politiek gedefinieerd om politieke doelen te bereiken en zo steun voor hun kant in een conflict te mobiliseren. Een probleem benoemen is bepalen wat er op het spel staat en wie er beïnvloed door is. Het gaat dus om de belangen en de constitutie van een alliantie. Er is geen sprake van een niet-politieke probleem definiëring. Back to top Hoofdstuk 10: Raamwerk om te besluiten Dit hoofdstuk gaat over het raamwerk van rationele besluitvorming dat de onderzoeken over beleid en beleidsanalyse heeft gedomineerd voor een lange tijd. De held wordt neergezet als een besluitvormer die verdwaald is en verward. Hij of zij gebruikt getallen om zich hier uit te krijgen, door de kosten en baten te tellen van alternatieve manieren/oplossingen. Problemen zijn een keuze tussen alternatieven middelen om een doel te bereiken en rationaliteit betekent het kiezen van de beste middel om het gegeven doel te bereiken. Het rationeel beslissen Een rationeel beslissingsmodel laat een beleidsprobleem zien als een keuze waar een politieke actor voor staat. Die actor die moet een bepaalde keuze maken om zo gewild te blijven. Hij gaat door een sequentie van mentale stappen om tot de keuze te komen. Dit zijn het definiëren van doelen, het bedenken van alternatieve middelen om doelen te bereiken, het evalueren van de consequenties van elke keuze en het kiezen van de alternatief die het doel het waarschijnlijkste kan halen Het idee van perfecte rationaliteit houdt in dat een persoon alle mogelijke alternatieve kent en ze allemaal kan evalueren. Hij is hier dan zo druk mee dat hij waarschijnlijk nooit een keuze kan maken. Men gaat er daarom van uit dat mensen handelen met gelimiteerde rationaliteit: enkele alternatieven kan men analyseren, met gelimiteerde informatie en als een goed alternatief op je pad komt stop je met zoeken. Veel modellen hebben stap 1 en 2 niet: ze gaan ervan uit dat de actor zijn doelen weet en ze verwoord heeft. Ze letten vooral op stap 3: consequenties. In alle beslissingsmodellen is stap 4 gebaseerd op een enkele criteria: maximale totale welvaart. Het idee is hetzelfde: je moet kiezen voor het alternatief dat het algemene welvaartsniveau maximaliseert. Als een beslisser alleen werkt dan kijkt hij naar zijn eigen welzijn ed. Volgens de modellen kunnen alle relevante overwegingen in een beslissing gezien worden als consequenties van de alternatieven. Een voorbeeld van overwegingen: morele principes en taken of het proces van het maken van een besluit: soms waarderen we de manier waarop een besluit is gemaakt meer dan de uitkomst. Er zijn variaties in het algemene model van besluitvorming. Kostenbaten analyse is het breedst gebruikt en gaat over het tellen van de negatieve en positieve consequenties van een besluit om te zien of het besluit tot verlies of winst zal lijden. Je wilt voordelen > kosten en voordelen > 0. Als de consequenties van een handeling immaterieel is, zoals de dood, neergang van een stad of deuk in een reputatie, dan moeten ze nog steeds gemeten en gewaardeerd worden om de kostenbaten analyse te kunnen gebruiken. Dat is lastig en daarom worden ze vaak buiten de analyse gelaten. Een andere variatie is de risicovoordelen of gewoon risicoanalyse. Deze richt zich meer op mogelijke toekomstige effecten waarvan we niet zeker weten of die er wel komen. Het wordt gebruikt om te beslissing te formuleren of er actie wordt ondernomen of niet. Het werkt hetzelfde als de kostenbaten analyse alleen zijn de minnen hier metingen van de kans op negatieve effecten. Risico problemen hebben het altijd over de kans op minder dan 100%. De techniek bouwt een assumptie in dat een slecht resultaat minder erg is als het niet zeker is dat het gaat gebeuren. Zelfs als iets 99% kans heeft dat het gaat gebeuren dan heeft het minder risico dan iets waarvan we zeker weten dat het gaat gebeuren. De maat van de omvang gemeten door een kans noemt men: verwachte waarde of verwachte kosten. Risico analyse gaat ervan uit dat we een verwachte waarde kunnen behandelen precies zoals een zekere waarde door het rekenen later te doen. Risico analyse stelt ons in staat om een verwachte waarde net zo te behandelen als een zekere waarde voor rekendoelen, terwijl ze beide verschillende betekenissen hebben. Verwachte waarde als concept staat ook centraal in de besluitanalyse: een raamwerk voor het structureren van problemen als er een grote mate van onzekerheid is over de consequenties van handelingen of als er een verhouding bestaat tussen verschillende consequenties van dezelfde handeling. Besluitanalyse neemt de inzichten van 1 persoon en gebruikt de subjectieve verwachtingen over waarden en kansen en over informatie voor andere bronnen. Veronderstellingen die bij al deze 3 analyses horen zijn: handelingen moeten worden geëvalueerd aan de hand van de consequenties, niet door de oorzaken. Beslissingen moeten gemaakt worden door het specificeren van doelen en middelen en door het evalueren van de alternatieven. Kies de beste. De beste handeling vindt men door 1 criteria: ‘grootste’. Onzekere consequenties kan men meten door de kans te vermenigvuldigen met de omvang. In de politieke gemeenschap worden grote zaken verspreid, gedeeld, onderhandeld en steeds betwist. Meeste beleidszaken gaan over vragen wie de macht heeft. In het rationele model gaat men er van uit dat dit probleem er niet is of opgelost is. Besluitvorming in de politieke gemeenschap Het rationele model brengt een mate van bepaaldheid: een belofte dat als je door het proces van analyse heen gaat je een definitief antwoord krijgt. In de politieke gemeenschap zijn rationele keuze modellen overtuigende beroepen die gemonteerd zijn door mensen met een aandeel in de uitkomsten. Het laten zien van een probleem als een besluit is een manier om de grenzen te controleren: wat is problematisch en wat niet, hoe zien mensen het fenomeen en hoe reageert men er op. Objectieve doelstellingen zijn de standaard in het rationele model waarmee mogelijke alternatieven geëvalueerd worden. De beslisser moet de doelen weten. Doelstellingen zijn niet alleen wensen en bedoelingen in de politieke gemeenschap, maar ze zijn middelen van het bereiken van politieke steun. Ambiguïteit, in tegenstelling tot expliciet en precieze omschrijvingen, zijn hierom beter: door vage doelen krijg je steun van meerdere mensen en groepen. Politici zijn daarom juist soms vaag over hun doelen. Het is bijna nooit in het belang van iemand om doelen ondubbelzinnig te formuleren. Men gebruikt ambiguïteit in de politieke gemeenschap dus bewust. Het weghalen van ambiguïteit is ook niet mogelijk. Politieke doelen zijn nooit ondubbelzinnig. Ze worden gebruikt om allianties te maken. Politieke doelen zijn eerdere loslopend wild dan vaste standaarden. Doelen veranderen steeds omdat mensen er allemaal iets anders in lezen. De relatie tussen doelen en handelingen is interactief: als we handelingen doen om doelen te behalen dan verandert de betekenis van het doel, net als de mensen die het steunen of er tegen zijn en de nieuwe allianties en betekenis veranderen ons idee over welke handelingen men moet doen. De tweede stap in het besluitvormingsmodel (alternatieven) is niet minder gecompliceerd in de politieke gemeenschap. Het beheersen van het aantal alternatieven is de essentie van het politieke spel. Zaken van de agenda houden is een vorm van macht dat net zo belangrijk is als zaken op de agenda houden. Een strategie in de politieke gemeenschap is om bepaalde alternatieven niet te laten zien. Een andere is om iemand zijn gewilde uitkomst te laten zien als de enige alternatief. Deze strategie is zo doordringend in het sociale leven dat het een naam heeft: Hobson’s keuze. Een spreker geeft het publiek een schijnbare keuze, terwijl de lijst van alternatieven bepaald hoe mensen de keuze zullen maken door 1 optie als de enige logische alternatief neer te zetten. De lange lijst met alternatieven in de rationele besluitvormingsmodel is misleidend omdat het doet blijken dat de items op de lijst op gelijke voet staan. In Hobson’s keuze is een alternatief zo tussen andere ingestopt die allemaal zo negatief mogelijk lijken. Het proces van het richten van alle aandacht op een bepaald deel van een causale ketting noemt men probleem vorming. Het gaat hier om een grens die delen afsnijdt van onze visie. Een lijst met alternatieven is een belangrijke manier om beleidsproblemen te vormen en een Hobson’s keuze te maken. In probleem vorming is ook het labellen van alternatieven belangrijk. In rationele analyse moeten de verbale labels die gekoppeld zijn aan de verschillende alternatieven de evaluatie niet beïnvloeden. Alternatieven zijn acties die objectieve consequenties hebben en het is de meting van deze consequenties die uiteindelijk telt, niet de emotionele reactie van een beslisser. In de politieke gemeenschap is taal erg belangrijk. De manier waarop zaken worden verwoord bepaald of we risico nemend of ontwijkend zijn. Als je zegt: door dit medicijn redden we 200 van de 600 mensen, of we zeggen: er is een 1/3 kans dat 200 mensen het overleven, maar een 2/3 kans dat er geen overlevende zijn, maakt een verschil. Mensen kiezen eerder voor de eerste. Maar aanhangers van de rationele theorie vinden deze vormen van effecten van taal een verstoring van rationeel denken. Puur rationeel denken is gebaseerd op objectieve consequenties. Taal is dus in de politiek erg belangrijk. Dit brengt ons tot nog een verschil tussen de rationele besluitvorming methode en de beslissingen in de politieke gemeenschap. In het rationele model wordt van de analist verwacht dat hij een lijst met alternatieven samenstelt die gelijkwaardig zijn. In de politieke gemeenschap kunnen symbolen gecombineerd worden tot tegenstrijdige alternatieven waardoor er weer nieuwe opties ontstaan. De derde stap in het besluitvormingsmodel is het evalueren van de consequenties van elke keuze. Ook hier zien we een discrepantie tussen het model en de politieke gemeenschap. Hoe kosten geteld worden is vooral anders. In de politieke gemeenschap is er nog iets wat belangrijker is: bepalen welke consequenties in de analyse mee worden genomen. Elke actie heeft oneindige consequenties. Het selecteren van welke wel en welke niet mee te nemen is willekeurig en strategisch. Wat in het rationele model als abstracte kosten en baten worden gezien, zijn in de politiek juist verliezen en winsten. Ze spelen geen grote rol in de politiek tenzij iemand ze mobiliseert. De verdeling van consequenties speelt een rol in de vierde stap: de keuze tussen alternatieven. Rationele analyse gebruikt van de enkele criteria over maximale welzijn om een ultieme beslissing te maken. Een beslissing is erg gevoelig voor de manier waarop kosten en baten worden laten zien met woorden en beelden. Politieke actoren willen laten zien dat een bepaalde handeling de maatschappij als geheel bevoordeeld en laat kosten zien alsof die op niemand specifiek vallen. Back to top Toelichting deel 4 Beleidsacties zijn lopende strategieën voor het structureren van relaties en het coördineren van gedrag om collectieve doelen te behalen. Beleid creëert geen permanente mechanische oplossingen. Het proces van het kiezen en implementeren van de middelen van een beleid is politiek en doorlopend. De strategieën worden beleidsinstrumenten genoemd en zijn manieren om macht uit te oefenen en om mensen dingen te laten doen die ze anders niet zouden doen. Dit deel gaat over de vormen van gezag die de regering gebruikt om gedrag en beleid te veranderen. Stone noemt marktconcurrentie niet als algemene beleidsstrategie, omdat competitie op zich geen openlijke bewuste en weloverwogen keuze is om bedrag te bepalen en dit is nou juist wat beleid is. Ook kracht ziet ze niet als een beleidsstrategie, omdat het vaak als sanctie in het beheersen van rechten regels wordt gebruikt. In de politieke gemeenschap kan een beleid of programma twee typen strategie promoten. De strategieën die besproken worden lijken allemaal erg abstract, maar zijn dit niet. Een beleidsstrategie is een menselijke creatie, iets dat ontworpen is en meer. Back to top Hoofdstuk 11: Beloningen en straffen Dit hoofdstuk gaat over het veranderen van het gedrag van mensen door beloningen en straffen of prikkels en sancties. De kennis die de mensen daarvan hebben motiveert ze om zich anders te gedragen dan ze normaal gesproken zouden doen. Beloningen maakt ze dingen laten doen die wij willen makkelijker, afschrikking de dingen die zij graag willen maar wij niet juist moeilijker. Het is wel zo dat elke beloning een impliciete of potentiële mogelijkheid van intrekking in zich heeft. Beloningen en afschrikkingen delen dezelfde logica, vandaar dat Stone ze als een en dezelfde type beleidsstrategie behandeld met hier en daar verschillen. De theorie van stimulansen Gemeenschappelijke problemen ontstaan als er een dissonantie bestaat tussen privé belangen en publieke belangen, of als individuele iets behalen of verliezen door iets te doen dat andere schaadt of helpt. Stimulansen helpen om de individuele motieven gelijk te krijgen aan de gemeenschappelijke. Er komen drie dingen bij kijken: 1) de gever, 2) de ontvanger of doel en 3) de stimulans. De theorie gaat van enkele veronderstellingen uit. Stimulansen werken door mensen hun gedrag te laten veranderen. Ontvangers hebben zelf controle over hun gedrag en kunnen dit aanpassen: ze zijn erg aanpasbaar. Het fenomeen van loyaliteit werkt in de politieke gemeenschap in de tegenovergestelde richting van de aanpasbaarheid van mensen. Gevers en ontvangers zijn eenvormige actoren: een actor is een entiteit die rationeel gedrag kan tonen. Ze bewegen en gedragen zich in een collectie entiteit. Ook al is elke groep een rationele actor die voorspelbaar op stimulansen reageert, de deelname in een maatschappij of organisatie verandert de manier waarop individuen reageren. Het is hierom erg belangrijk dat men analyseert hoe collectieve processen de manier waarop individuen de stimulansen toepassen en er op reageren beïnvloeden. Het doel van een stimulans kan van alles zijn, zoals een individu die een groep vertegenwoordigt. De reactie van het doel op een stimulans kan niet het product zijn van een enkel persoon. De ontvanger richt zich op de toekomst. Stimulansen werken alleen in zekere mate als de ontvanger om de kosten of beloningen geeft die er in de toekomst zijn en bereid is huidig gedrag daaraan aan te passen. Stimulansen die ver in de toekomst plaatsvinden hebben een minder grote impact, omdat de effecten pas laat zichtbaar zijn. Als de ontvanger een collectief entiteit is (een bedrijf of land) dan is het tijdsbestek erg warrig. De levenscyclus van organisaties verschillen onderling en met de individuen die er werken. Zelfs al zijn stimulansen gericht op individuen, dan nog veranderen deze individuen voortdurend zodat een lang tijdsbestek de effectiviteit van een stimulans kan beïnvloeden. Doelgerichte noties van oorzaken: de theorie van stimulansen gaat uit van het individu als rationele actor. Stimulansen worden ingezet als het oorzaak van een probleem bewust zijn. De stimulansen moeten dan de consequenties voor de actor veranderen. Of als ze onbedoeld zijn: het resultaat van onbedoelde consequenties of handelingen. Stimulansen zijn dan ontworpen om onzichtbare consequenties zichtbaar te maken voor de ontvanger, zodat de neveneffecten zichtbaar worden. Stimulansen rusten op het idee van actoren als eenheid, autonome en doelbewust en zijn daarom de smalste van de beleidsstrategieën die er zijn. Ze kunnen simpele oorzaken beïnvloeden, maar geen complexe. De stimulansen kunnen negatief en positief zijn. Wat bepaalt of een stimulans een beloning of een straf is, bepaalt niet de intentie van de gever, maar de verwachtingen van de ontvanger. Een 200 euro promotie klinkt als een beloning, maar is een straf als je 500 verwachtte. Het is dus erg belangrijk om het gezichtspunt van de ontvanger te weten. Er is een proportionele relatie tussen een stimulans en gedrag: hoe meer we geven, hoe meer gewenst gedrag we krijgen. Beloningen en straffen kunnen verschillen vormen van politieke relaties bevorderen. Positieve creëren allianties en een goed humeur, ze moedigen samenwerking aan en creëren een sterke relatie. Negatieve creëren een klimaat van conflicten en splitsen partijen op. Er zijn dus veel verschillen tussen beloningen en straffen, maar er is 1 gelijkenis: beloningen en straffen zijn inspanningen van een partij om het gedrag van een andere partij te beheersen. De effectiviteit van een beloningssysteem om het gedrag van mensen te laten veranderen wordt verhoogd als er meer ontvangers afhankelijk zijn van de gever en niet in staat zijn om deze producten ed. op een andere manier te krijgen. Het creëren van stimulansen in de politieke gemeenschap In de politieke gemeenschap gaat alles net wat anders. Er is geen directe correspondentie tussen een stimulans zoals bedoeld door de ontvanger en zoals toegepast door de gever. Er is een gebrek aan bereidheid om sancties in te voeren namens ambtenaren. Er zijn elementen van de politieke gemeenschap die het moeilijk maken om stimulansen uit te delen. Negatieve sancties verdelen relaties en zijn verstorend voor ze. Mensen houden er niet van om andere schade toe te brengen. Ook hebben mensen dit met positieve stimulansen soms: mensen hebben angst voor het verstorende effect dat een stimulans kan hebben. Ook is het zo dat een straf op iemand leggen ook voor kosten kan zorgen voor de gever, zoals concrete materiële kosten, maar dit geldt ook voor een beloning. Beloningen gebeuren nooit automatisch; men moet er over nadenken en beslissen wie het krijgt. Soms is het ook zo dat een straf juist hetgeen schaadt wat men probeert te beschermen. Dit gebeurt veel in de USA waar men met subsidies en belasting veel programma’s op poten zet zodat ze services kunnen aanbieden aan burgers. Maar men haalt dit geld dus weg bij mensen die ze juist proberen te helpen. Als er een gat is tussen het ontwerp en de toepassing van een stimulans dan is er een virtuele kloof tussen de ontwerper en het doel. Er zijn veel symbolische betekenissen van stimulansen, die los staat van de echte betekenis. Scholieren zien staf soms als iets stoers en straffen kan scholieren juist tegen werken en niet helpen. Straffen worden dan dus soms gezien als middelen van de ontvanger. Zo kunnen de kosten van de straffen ook worden gezien als middel voor de gevers. Als een land een importrestrictie invoert voor een ander land dan verliest het zelf mogelijk ook exportmarkt. Voor de ontvanger zijn de straffen en beloningen extra consequenties van het doen van bepaalde handelingen. De ontwerper kijkt vaak alleen naar de stimulansen die hij ontwerpt en de gever alleen naar de stimulansen die hij beheert. Dit is een smalle visie. In de politieke gemeenschap accepteren de ontvangers van de stimulansen de structuur van beloningen en straffen bijna nooit. Ontvangers zijn politieke creaties die de wereld proberen te anders te maken. Een beloningssysteem die hen straft voor iets doen wat zij graag willen doen, vinden ze raar: ze zullen eerst proberen om de regels te veranderen bv door onderhandelingen. Nog effectiever is het krijgen van de controle over de politieke instituties die de beloningssystemen beheren. De bewuste officieel gecreëerde stimulansen van politiek beleid (zoals belastingen) moeten altijd in het perspectief worden geplaatst van een bredere structuur van stimulansen in de samenleving. Er is geen algemene regel om te voorspellen hoe ze het gedrag van mensen beïnvloeden. Er is geen systeem van stimulansen dat zelfuitvoerend, automatisch of a-politiek is. Stimulansen zijn georganiseerd om georganiseerde sociale systemen waarin twee verschillende soorten mens betrokken zijn die elkaar proberen te beïnvloeden. Back to top Hoofdstuk 12: Het al dan niet mogen optreden Regels zijn commando’s om op te treden of juist niet op te treden in een bepaalde manier. Het zijn classificaties van mensen en situaties die de rechten en toestemmingen bepalen. De twee instrumenten, aansporingen of stimulansen en regels, zijn verwikkeld in elkaar. Het maken van beleid is afhankelijk van formele officiële regels die ontworpen zijn om sociale doelen te bereiken. Voorbeelden zijn wetten, wetgevende lichamen, bestuurslichamen, rechtbanken en de grondwet. Sommige regels mandateren bepaald gewenst gedrag. Sommige regels geven bevoegdheden aan mensen. Maatschappijen hebben ook andere regels om gedag te beheren: gewoonten en tradities, informele normen van kleine groepen en families, morele regels en principes en de regels van statuten van verenigingen en stichtingen. Dit zijn onofficiële regels die wel de kracht van wetten hebben. Hoe een regel werkt Regels zijn indirecte commando’s die werken in de tijd. Ze zijn indirect omdat ze eenmaal opgezet worden en voor een algemene groep gelden, en niet direct voor elke persoon voor elke situatie worden opgemaakt. Legitimiteit bind de mensen die de regels volgen aan de mensen die de regels maken. Het is een soort onzichtbare kracht: het bestaat om maatschappijen samen te houden, maar we kunnen het niet verklaren hoe we het creëren of waarom het soms erg sterk is en soms bijna niet lijkt te bestaan. Toch zeggen we dat regels het beste werken als ze als legitiem worden ervaren. Regels bestaan uit twee delen: ze beschrijven een handeling die in bepaalde situaties of contexten gedaan moeten worden. Ze worden dan geformuleerd als: als…dan. Ze zijn afhankelijk van een context omdat de manier waarop wij handelingen zien afhankelijk is van de context. Soms is de omgevingsdeel van een regel geïmpliceerd neergezet, zoals een bordje met: hier niet zwemmen. ‘Hier’ is de context, de omgeving. De politieke aard van regels is dat ze de ene keer iets opnemen en de andere keer niet (door definiëren van behandeling of toelaatbare handelingen voor verschillende mensen), dat ze samenvoegen maar de andere keer juist verdelen (door mensen in categorieën in te delen). Elke regel is wel dubbelzinnig door de grenzen en creëert hierdoor prikkels voor mensen om hun gedrag zo te laten zien alsof het binnen de grenzen valt. Mensen manipuleren de grenzen. Regels delen mensen dus in bevoordeelde en minder bevoordeelde groepen. Daarom is er altijd vraag voor het herindelen van de mensen in deze groepen. Op zoek naar goede regels Er is altijd een spanning tussen precisie en flexibiliteit. De essentie van precisie is dat zowel handelingen als de contexten ondubbelzinnig omschreven kunnen worden. Er zijn drie elementen voor precieze formele regels: men gaat er van uit dat precieze regels gelijke zaken gelijk behandelen (eerlijkheid). Precieze regels zonderen mensen af van de vooroordelen en voorliefdes van ambtenaren. Een reden om bepaalde ambtenaren geen macht te geven is omdat individuele discretie leidt tot het ongelijk behandelen van dezelfde soort zaken. Precieze regels voorkomen dat ambtenaren onjuiste macht gebruiken. Precieze regels bieden voorspelbaarheid. Ze informeren mensen van te voren wat wel en wat niet toegestaan is. Precisie heeft ook nadelen. Ze zijn niet gevoelig voor sommige individuele en omgevingsverschillen. Verschillende zaken worden daardoor gelijk behandeld. Regels kun je niet afstemmen op elk individueel geval. We kunnen ook nooit helemaal anticiperen op toekomstige situaties. Daarom is het onmogelijk om regels te maken die rekening houden met nieuwe feiten, technologieën en omgevingen. Mensen veranderen zelf ook, net als hun doelen. Vage regels kunnen flexibel zijn en zijn gevoeliger voor verschillen. Het falen van precisie is de grond voor vaagheid. Vage regels hebben grote ruimte voor discreetheid. Men kan onbewuste kennis gebruiken: dit is kennis die mensen weten maar niet in woorden kunnen omschrijven, zeker niet omschrijven in regels. Intuïtie is een voorbeeld. We hebben een constitutionele bescherming ontwikkeld om vooral ons rechtssysteem te beschermen tegen vage verklaringen. Soms willen we wetten op gebieden waar onze kennis alleen maar onbewust is, zoals seksuele intimidatie. Vage regels hebben ook een symbolische betekenis. Precieze regels symboliseren eerlijkheid en voorspelbaarheid, maar vage regels laten toe dat men gemeenschapsidealen kan uiten. Aspiraties kan men beter uiten in algemene bewoordingen en abstracte concepten. Het debat over precisie vs. vaagheid in het ontwerp van regels maakt deel uit van een groter debat over de juiste balans tussen formele regels en discretie in het ontwerp van regeringen. Beleidsmakers kijken naar wanneer men een regel moet maken of juist discreet moet zijn en hoe men een goede regel maakt dat kan helpen doelen te bereiken. Deze vragen zie je eerder in de politiek dan in theorieën, maar er zijn enkele onbereikbare ideeën die zo nu en dan opkomen. De optimale sociale balans gaat om het rationele ideaal van de optimale sociale balans tussen discretionaire macht en controle door formele regels. Regels en discretie hebben deugden en een juiste manier van gebruiken: men kan de noodzakelijke onderscheiden van minder noodzakelijke. Het doel is volgens K.C. Davis om onnodige discretionaire macht, niet om alle discretionaire macht, te elimineren. Het probleem met dit ideaal is hoe je de onnodige componenten kan identificeren. Noodzakelijkheid is geen objectieve standaard, maar een element van macht. De keuze tussen regels en discretie is ook een keuze tussen wie de beslissingen maakt. Een gevecht over de juiste mate van discretie is ook een gevecht over de macht tussen bepaalde actoren. De perfecte precieze regel: Ronald Dworkin vindt dat een regel best uitzonderingen mag hebben, maar als dat zo is dan is het onnauwkeurig en incompleet om de regel zo simpel te maken, zonder het opsommen van de uitzonderingen. Maar het opschrijven van alle toepassingen en uitzonderingen is onmogelijk. We kunnen ook niet toekomstige situaties meenemen. De perfecte flexibele regel: dit zet doelen neer, maar specificieert geen instrumenten om ze te bereiken. Het is bijna geen regel, omdat hij zo vaag is dat er bijna niet aan te houden is. De tweede en derde zijn statische idealen, regels die voor alle tijd en situaties werken. Maar in de politiek kunnen regels nooit stabiel zijn. Mensen die door een regel benadeeld worden zullen hem bestrijden. De neutrale regel: deze regels beïnvloeden iedereen gelijk en creëren voordelen en nadelen voor verschillende mensen. Regels zijn nooit gemaakt door neutrale wetgevers, maar door onderhandelingen met partijen die kunnen winnen of verliezen. Dit ideaal richt zich op de struisvogel misvatting: alleen omdat we de effecten van een regel voor verschillende mensen niet kunnen zien of voorspellen, kunnen we nog niet aannemen dat verschillende effecten niet kunnen ontstaan. De perfecte afgedwongen regel: een regel die werkt met onvermijdbare ‘dodelijke’ uitkomsten. Dit ideaal is gerelateerd aan die van de perfecte precieze regel. De afgedwongen regel steekt met onpartijdigheid. Het maken van regels in de politieke gemeenschap In de politieke gemeenschap zijn regels niet alleen objecten van politieke conflicten, maar ook van wapens. Mensen vechten met regels om hun doelen te bereiken. Regels worden intern geschreven en zorgen zo voor een tendens richting vaagheid. In de theorie van democratie is het zo dat formele regels onderhandeld worden door vertegenwoordigers van belangen in gekozen wetgevende organen. Wetgevende organen hebben bepaalde kenmerken die hen richting vagere wetgeving sturen. Ze willen herkozen worden en willen conflicten voorkomen. Ze doen dit door het mijden van statuten die duidelijk mensen schaden. Men komt daarom al snel uit bij dubbelzinnige regels en woorden. Regels worden gemaakt in de wisselwerking tussen degenen die zij regelen en degenen die ze opleggen. Deze wisselwerking zorgt voor een fascinerend fenomeen van politiek: pervers effect. Dit zijn beloningen die onbewust in een regel zijn gebouwd om te voldoen aan deze regel op een manier zodat het nieuwe problemen creëert of het probleem die de regel moet oplossen juist verergert. Ze ontstaan als er een wisselwerking tussen doelen ontstaat, maar een regel beloont of straft maar 1 van deze. Wanneer wij meerdere doelen hebben of ons zorgen maken over meerdere delen van het gedrag, dan zullen regels die maar een dimensie regelen het gedrag verstoren omdat die zorgen dat mensen gaan overdrijven of bezuinigen in andere dimensies. Het fenomeen van pervers effect leidt tot een dynamiek van meer uitgebreide regels. De originele regels worden aangepakt, preciseer gemaakt of uitgebreid. Perverse effecten zullen nooit echt weggewerkt kunnen worden, al is dit de hoop van de perfect precieze regel. Ze zijn echter in zekere mate onvermijdbaar. In de politieke gemeenschap worden formele regels afgedwongen en geobserveerd volgens de informele manier van denken. Ambtenaren die de regels moeten handhaven en zonodig straffen moeten uitdelen kijken nooit precies naar de formele regels. Ze ontwikkelen informele en zelfs intuïtieve regels over de ernst en schuld van overtredingen. Ze straffen zodat het hun eigen gevoel voor rechtvaardigheid voedt. De vuistregels van deze handhavers worden de wijsheid waarmee overtredingen gemeten worden. Ze kunnen wereldwijd beroemd worden en ook geaccepteerd. Algemene kennis van deze vuistregels is dan ook niet gek. Ze kunnen echter wel de effectiviteit ondermijnen van bepaalde instanties. Vuistregels zijn de schaduwregering achter de formele regels: elke set van regels kan niet bestaan zonder de andere, maar vuistregels moeten in de schaduw blijven om effectief te zijn. Back to top Hoofdstuk 13: Elkaar overtuigen Dit zijn strategieën die afhankelijk zijn van overreding(skracht). Ze veranderen het gedrag van mensen door het doordringen tot hun verstand en hun percepties van de wereld, in plaats van door beloningen en straffen of door toestemmingen en verboden. De meest overtuigende, gecompliceerde en minst goed begrepen manier om gedag te controleren is overtuiging. Overtuiging heeft twee kanten: een vereerde en een gevreesde kant. De vereerde kant zien we in het feit dat het rationele ideaal uitgaat van redelijke en geïnformeerde beslissingen genomen door individuen. Mensen handelen aan de hand van een reden en niet op emoties, ondoordachte zaken en loyaliteit. Redenering is de basis. Rationele overtuiging wordt geassocieerd met vrijwilligheid. Informatie en kennis voorkomt de behoefte voor geweld omdat ze conflicten kunnen oplossen. Conflicten oplossen door feiten is zeker geen een overblijfsel van de geschiedenis: geweld zie je vaker. Het rationele idee heeft vele beleidsideeën voortgebracht gebaseerd op rationele overtuiging en vrijwillige gedragsverandering. Het rationele ideaal biedt dus een visie van de maatschappij waar conflict tijdelijk en onnodig is, waar geweld vervangen is door discussie en waar individuele handelingen in harmonie worden gebracht door de overtuigende kracht van logica en bewijs. De gevreesde kant zien we in de woorden ‘propaganda’ en ‘indoctrinatie’. Er zijn twee elementen die indoctrinatie onderscheiden van de processen van onderwijs bedacht in het rationele ideaal: het is bewust manipulatief waar het motieven verstopt van de dader. Het is gemaakt om te zorgen dat zijn publiek iemand anders zijn belangen behartigen gaat, in plaats van de eigenbelangen. Indoctrinatie berooft mensen van hun capaciteit om onafhankelijk te denken. Het beroept zich op angst, onzekerheid of vrees. Het voorkomt rationeel denken. Een voorbeeld hiervan is de controle van Big Brother. Lindblom: overtuiging als een middel van sociale controle speelt een centrale rol alleen in totalitaire politieke systemen. Hij heeft het over extreme overtuiging: het uitlegsysteem ). Het individu is autonoom, vrij om te onderhandelen en te kiezen op basis van juiste informatie in het rationele ideaal. Maar in het uitlegsysteem is het individu een pop van wie het brein overgenomen is door anderen. De individu kiest alsof het vrijwillig is, maar hij of zij is eigenlijk geregisseerd door anderen. Het doel van overtuiging is hier om actieve reacties uit te lokken en niet passieve gehoorzaamheid. De grens tussen de twee vormen van overtuiging is vaag. Tussen deze twee modellen vinden we het vaste terrein van beïnvloeding. Het maken van feiten in de politieke gemeenschap In de gemeenschap kunnen de beide vormen van overtuiging in pure vorm niet bestaan: men zit er ergens tussenin. Het rationele ideaal veronderstelt het bestaan van neutrale feiten: ze beschrijven de wereld, maar zijn er niet voor iemands belangen of het promoten van oordelen. Feiten bestaan echter niet onafhankelijk, aangezien ze aangekleed worden met woorden en cijfers. Het geven van een naam aan iets is een voorbeeld. We moeten informatie wel los zien van propaganda. Feiten zijn geproduceerd in sociale processen. We krijgen de meeste van onze informatie van sociale kennis, niet van het observeren van de wereld. We gebruiken instituties die feiten verzamelen. Zij maken keuzes in het ontwikkelen van informatie. Wetgevers besluiten wie ze bijvoorbeeld als getuige oproepen om te getuigen in rechtszaken. In de rechtbank zijn 2 partijen die bewijzen en getuigen meebrengen. Zij presenteren de zaak anders. Ze willen beide de meest overtuigende weergave van de realiteit voorleggen aan de jury. Er zijn enkele zaken die hier spelen die belangrijk zijn. Het is moeilijk om een grens te trekken tussen sociale fenomenen, helemaal als het om morele en waarde verschillen gaat. In het politieke leven vecht men vaak op die grenzen en over de grenzen. In de gemeenschap staan deze lijnen constant ter discussie. Het rationele idee overdrijft de rationaliteit die mensen gebruiken in het gebruik van informatie. Dat mensen geen beslissingen nemen op basis van pure rationele zaken is een punt dat discussie vergt. We worden namelijk beïnvloed door de bronnen van informatie (ras, uiterlijk, sociale manieren van mensen ed.) als door de inhoud. We worden sterk beïnvloed door mensen waar we mee leven en werken. Al deze uitdagingen over het beeld van de mens als een rationeel schepsel gaan over hetzelfde: het vertrouwen op makkelijke voor de hand liggende zaken (zoals stereotypes, groepsnormen, houdingen) is de meest effectieve en goedkoopste manier voor het kiezen tussen alternatieven. De vraag rest of indoctrinatie werkelijk buiten het domein van de politieke gemeenschap valt. Het is een overtuigende inspanning dat bewust manipulatief is en dat ontworpen is om de belangen van de geïndoctrineerde veilig te stellen. Ook ontneemt het mensen van de capaciteit om onafhankelijke en redelijke beslissingen te nemen. Hoe kan indoctrinatie dan gebeuren in niet-totalitaire maatschappijen? Hiervoor zijn redenen te noemen. Indoctrinatie kan buiten het raamwerk van een eenzijdige of centrale bureaucratie plaatsvinden. Dominante groepen houden hun posities zonder hulp van centrale machten. Lindblom ziet eenzijdige regeringsovertuiging als een criteria van de uitlegsystemen. Machtige indoctrinatie van mensen door bedrijven gebeurt in liberale democratieën, zelfs als de business sector geen 1 actor of een hele regering is. bedrijven indoctrineren burgers om bevoorrechte posities aan te nemen om zowel economische als politieke beslissingen te nemen. Bedrijven hebben een dominante positie in het beheersen van de economie: zij kunnen dit door invloed te hebben over onder meer de media en bepaalde middelen, zoals financiële middelen. Bedrijven verspreiden hun bericht indirect, bv door nieuwsverhalen, tijdschriften en films. Indoctrinatie kan ook gebeuren door gewoon overheid-burger contact. Dit is meer effectief dan door de media. Het uitlegsysteem suggereert dat indoctrinatie door directe voorziening van informatie in de media gebeurt (zoals speeches, posters en boeken). Maar de overheidsinstellingen en services zijn ook een manier om invloed uit te oefenen. De sociale diensten van de overheid hebben een sterk wapen om het gedrag van mensen te sturen. Sociale werkers kunnen bijvoorbeeld kinderen weghalen uit probleemgezinnen. Sommige service programma’s gebruiken gedrag modificatie technieken om gedrag te straffen of belonen. Gevangenissen geven bijvoorbeeld sigaretten en betere cellen als men zich goed gedraagt. Dit is lastig te onderscheiden van het model van een uitlegsysteem waarin overtuigende inspanningen vragen om actieve reacties en geen passieve gehoorzaamheid. Indoctrinatie kan ook gebeuren door het achterhouden van informatie en door juist het geven van informatie. Het uitlegsysteem negeert het belang van het achterhouden van informatie voor het beïnvloeden van de publieke opinie en besluitvorming. Het achterhouden van informatie is een fundamenteel en essentieel onderdeel van vele strategieën. Verkopers zijn zo in staat om een stabiele basis voor consumenten te houden en zo op lange termijn stabiliteit en zekerheid voor zichzelf te regelen. Voor de overheid is geheimhouding ook van belang, net als in markten. Dit zien we vooral als het verkiezingstijd is. Daarnaast is het de spil van het defensiebeleid. Het achterhouden van informatie voor het algemene publiek gebeurt zonder formele censuur of classificatie. Zekerheid is een belangrijk deel van de strategie in de politieke gemeenschap. Beleid over onthullingen en het achterhouden van informatie is een belangrijk onderwerp van conflicten. Overtuiging als een beleidsinstrument wordt vaak gezien of als een neutraal instrument van de wetenschap en de markt of als een gevaarlijk wapen van totalitaire overheden. Het veranderen en bijschaven van informatie is een belangrijk en onvermijdelijk deel van communicatie en een integraal deel van strategisch gedrag. Het rationele ideaal is vals in het voorwendsel dat indoctrinatie alleen gebeurt als er een enkele politieke autoriteit de propaganda versterkt en bepaalt door middel van communicatie media en scholen. Indoctrinatie wordt gedefinieerd als de bewuste manipulatie van meningen en voorkeuren en de vernieling of het voorkomen van onafhankelijke oordelen die ontstaan in liberale democratieën. Back to top Hoofdstuk 14: Standaarden van gedrag Dit zijn strategieën die individuen of groepen of organisaties toe staan om zich te beroepen op de macht van de regering voor hun eigen bestwil. Vele politieke eisen kun je lezen in elk recht. Rechten zijn gewoon weer een manier om relaties te regeren en individuele gedrag te coördineren om zo collectieve doelen te behalen. In de politiek zijn rechten een verspreide methode van het articuleren van standaarden van gedrag. Dit vindt plaats in een systeem van het continue oplossen van conflicten. De discussie over rechten heeft twee brede tradities: positieve en normatieve. In de positieve traditie is een recht een claim ondersteund door de macht van de state. Het is een verwachting over wat iemand kan doen of ontvangen of hoe iemand behandeld wordt. Men beroept zich op de hulp van de staat als dat nodig is. Volgens Holmes zijn wetten de voorspellingen van wat de rechtbanken echt zullen doen. In de normatieve traditie is het lastiger om te weten of een recht bestaat en er zijn vele denkbeelden over hoe we rechten kunnen definiëren. Er zijn twee veronderstellingen: mensen kunnen een recht hebben op iets dat zij niet actief opeisen of waarvoor de staat ze niet zal helpen en rechten komen voort uit van een bepaalde middel die anders is dan de kracht van handhaving. De positieve biedt in het publieke beleid de handgrepen en een bepaaldheid dat de normatieve niet heeft. Men organiseert zich vaak om de normatieve. Mensen hebben de rechten, zelfs als deze wettelijk nog niet herkend zijn. In de gemeenschap zijn de twee kanten van rechten onafscheidelijk. Wettelijke rechten van echte politieke systemen zijn energiek, beperkt en continue uitgedaagd door normatieve betekenissen van rechten. Hoe wettelijke rechten werken Er zijn drie typen rechten. Procedurele rechten werken een proces uit waarin belangrijke beslissingen genomen moeten worden. Het is een recht om een beslissing te hebben die jou raakt, gemaakt op een bepaalde manier. Het is geen recht op een uitkomst van wat soort dan ook (bv dat een werkgever jou moet aannemen). Voorbeelden van procedurele rechten zijn eerlijke procesorde en discriminatie. Substantieve rechten gaan verder dan de procedure in specifieke handelingen en aanspraken. Negatieve substantieve rechten is het recht om iets te doen zonder dat dit beperkt wordt. Het zijn rechten waar maar 1 partij betrokken bij is (enkelvoudig). Positieve substantieve rechten zijn aanspraken op iets of het krijgen van iets. Het impliceert een noodzaak van een tweede partij die de recht verleent. Al deze drie rechten definiëren relaties. Deze zijn het meest voor de hand liggend in positieve substantieve rechten aangezien het dienovereenkomstige verplichtingen betreft. Procedurele rechten specificeren hoe een partij beslissingen moet maken met respect voor de andere partij. Negatieve substantieve creëren relaties van non-interventie. Als het om de definitie van relaties gaat kunnen deze regels fungeren als sociale reguleringsmechanismen. Een wettelijke recht bevat drie elementen: een officiële verklaring van het recht (wetsvoorstel, regel, beslissing, contract), een proces voor het bepalen van de betwiste rechten en een oplossing, een manier voor de persoon die het recht heeft om relaties op te leggen die besloten liggen in het recht. Als je echt iets gedaan wilt hebben, moet je proberen om een formele wettelijke regel te krijgen die het recht definieert, bv via de Grondwet, via het bestuursrecht of via het gewoonterecht of jurisprudentie. Mocht dit niet lukken dan is het ook mogelijk om een nieuwe wet of een amendement te schrijven. Het kan ook via procesvoering: een proces met een grief waardoor individuen en groepen hun claims kunnen laten horen. Of en in welke mate rechters beperkt zijn in het maken van wettelijke beslissingen is de centrale vraag op het gebied van de jurisprudentie. Om te zorgen dat rechten werken als een beleidsstrategie moet er een handhavingmechanisme zijn. Met regels en aansporing ligt de primaire verantwoordelijkheid voor het monitoren van gedrag bij de regering. Met rechten ligt de primaire verantwoordelijkheid voor het monitoren bij degene die het recht bezit. Met regels is monitoren bedoeld om overtredingen te vinden voordat ze schade aanrichten, maar met rechten is het zo dat een gekrenkte partij vaak een claim heeft over schade. Men moet nadat een claim is ingediend en de zaak gewonnen is, ook nog zeker weten dat de persoon die schade had toegerekend nu wel echt het recht verleend aan de ander. Systemen van rechten leunen op legitimiteit om mensen te bewegen om vrijwillig zich aan de wetten te houden. Soms zien we de strategie die voor de rechten wordt gebruikt als top down: een wetgever maakt een nieuwe wet of een rechtbank maakt een beslissing dat vanaf dan altijd geldt voor bepaalde mensen. Rechten in de gemeenschap zijn niet zozeer simpele mechanismen. Net als regels, aansporingen of een andere beleidsstrategie zijn ze gevormd door de strategische samenspel tussen politieke actoren. De normatieve basis van wettelijke rechten Rechtbanken kunnen alleen die eisen als rechten articuleren die individuen of organisaties als rechten hebben geformuleerd. Mensen halen hun ideeën over rechten van verschillende bronnen, bijvoorbeeld van officiële verklaringen (grondwet) en van onderwijs over de overheid en rechten, maar ook van onze morele filosofie. Als wettelijke regels niet overeenkomen met de natuurlijke regels dan zullen de natuurlijke rechten volharden omdat ze onvervreemdbaar zijn. Het idee van morele rechten zorgt voor een discrepantie tussen wettelijke rechten en morele rechten. Hoe mensen problemen conceptualiseren als juridische grieven is een van de grootste mysteries van de sociale wetenschappen. Tijdens het maken van wettelijke rechten worden niet alleen eisers gemotiveerd door normatieve betekenis van rechten. Rechters beroepen zich ook op morele idealen en normen. Dit zien we vooral in aansprakelijkheidsrecht. Veel van dit recht leunt op het idee van een ‘redelijk mens’. Rechters rechtvaardigen hun beslissingen door te wijzen op wat de burgers willen, het publieke belang en fatsoen. Normatieve betekenissen zijn net als de zwaartekracht: trekken en duwen aan de wettelijke rechten. Steeds als rechters afwijken van de traditie, of om nieuwe rechten taken te creëren of om oude te beperken, dan rechtvaardigen zij de beslissing met retoriek over veranderde sociale condities. De wet kon de sociale veranderingen dan niet goed genoeg bijhouden. Men schetst vaak een beeld van de maatschappij. De beelden van de maatschappij rechtvaardigen dan de beslissing, en niet zozeer de logica. De beelden zijn dan de inspiratie van de wettelijke beslissingen. Naast de rechters beslissingen gaan deze beelden ook op andere punten in het systeem de implementatie van rechten binnen. Advocaten gebruiken hun eigen normen van de wet in hun vuistregels. Ze vergelijken zaken met hun eigen idee van wat normaal is. De politieke basis van wettelijke rechten In het markt model komt het publieke belang uit het individuele najagen van zelfbelang. Individuele burgers helpen de maatschappij om het geheel aan democratische wetten te creëren en verdedigen op het moment als zij op hun eigen individuele rechten een beroep doen. In de gemeenschap is het echter zo dat justitiabelen niet simpel voor de rechtbank verschijnen als uitwisselbare vertegenwoordigers van abstracte zaken. Zaken zijn wedstrijden tussen twee mensen die bepaalde posities in de maatschappij hebben die hen meer of minder macht geven in de rechtbank. We kunnen de wedstrijden beschrijven als het hebben van geconcentreerde of verspreide belangen. Geconcentreerde belangen in zaken zijn partijen die de rechtbank vaak gebruiken in de loop van hun dagelijkse leven: herhaalde spelers noemt Marc Galanter deze. Herhaalde spelers kunnen vele zaken hebben lopen en meer gaan lopen in de toekomst. Ze hebben niet zo’n belang bij de uitkomsten, maar willen juist een algemene machtige positie behouden. Ze willen bijvoorbeeld liever een verklaring van een recht krijgen dan een geschil winnen. Ze willen ook hun lange termijn doelen behalen. Verspreide belangen zijn mensen wie de rechtbank zelden of sporadisch gebruiken: enkelingen. Deze zijn gericht op de specifieke rechtszaken. Ze hebben er ook belang bij aangezien de uitkomst hun leven kan beïnvloeden. Ze gebruiken compromissen en willen snel de rechtszaken eindigen. Ze geven ook meer om de tastbare uitkomsten van het geschil. Wat echt belangrijk is, is de relatieve concentratie van tegenstrijdige belangen in een enkele geschil. Er zijn veel zaken tussen enkelingen, maar de meesten zijn tussen een herhaalde speler en een enkeling. De partijen zijn dus niet gelijk voor de wet,. Er is een verschil in middelen (vooral financieel) en wettelijk talent, maar ook in onderhandelingsmacht (hoeveelheid en soort middelen). Het voortdurende structuren van de strijdende partijen gebeurt op verschillende manieren. Belangengroepen gebruiken bewust de term ‘test zaken’ als strategie om rechten te herdefiniëren van hun leden. Op deze manier zoeken ze naar eisers met een hoog potentieel om te winnen. Belangengroepen kunnen ook een geschil structureren zodat een organisatie of meerdere organisaties de eisers of verdedigers worden. Als mensen vertegenwoordigd worden door andere organisaties (bv vakbonden) dan wordt het wettelijk systeem minder een democratische institutie waar individuen zelf de hulp inroepen van publieke autoriteiten voor hun eigen belang. Men maakt zich zorgen of de organisaties de belangen van individuen wel echt vertegenwoordigen. De leiders van collectieve rechtszaken kopiëren vaak de strategieën van wetgevende politiek in het construeren van hun eisers. Susan Olsen identificeert twee strategieën: het stapelen van de eisers. Dit betreft het kiezen van individuen met de beste kenmerken voor succes en het vergaren van een substantieel aantal eisers, gebaseerd op de theorie dat het getal de jury beïnvloedt. Ticket balanceren betreft het combineren van individuele eisers en organisaties die verschillende kieskringen vertegenwoordigen binnen een grote belangengroep. Beide strategieën zijn manieren om de normatieve beroepen van een positie te verbreden. Werken rechten? Dit ligt aan wat we met ‘werken’ bedoelen. Rechten werken niet op een mechanische manier zoals omschreven aan het begin van dit hoofdstuk. Rechten zijn minder direct dan het simpel opleggen van nakoming met wettelijke normen. De doordringbaarheid van wettelijk gedefinieerde regels naar normatieve concepten van rechten is de grote impuls voor politieke mobilisatie. In een poging om reeds bestaande regels toe te passen zet berechting conflicten over kleine feiten van specifieke geschillen om in grote principes van wetten. Individuele geschillen worden gegeneraliseerd waardoor het geschil gepolitiseerd wordt en uit het gebied van persoonlijke problemen wordt gehaald. Het systeem van rechten en procesvoering wordt echter wel bekritiseerd vanwege het fragmenteren van grote sociale conflicten in geschillen tussen enkele partijen. Het klassieke rechten model is gericht op discrete handelingen van identificeerbare partijen. Publiekrechtelijke procesvoering is gericht op het veranderen van een systematisch patroon in een groot gebied van publiekrecht. De verdediger is vaak een instituut of een grote bureaucratie. Het doel van dit soort geschillen is niet alleen het vinden van een oplossing voor een geschil in het verleden, geven van compensatie of het winnen van nakoming met een specifieke standaard of gedrag, maar ook het transformeren van de manier waarop een institutie werkt. Instituties zijn hier echter op tegen. Zij willen hun autonomie houden en zijn tegen het meedoen van rechters in grote institutionele monitoren. Er kunnen wel groter veranderingen plaatsvinden, maar alleen als de belangrijke politieke actoren er klaar voor zijn en bereid zijn om zelf veranderingen door te voeren. Anders werkt het niet. Rechten zijn ook geen instrumenten, ze opereren niet mechanisch en consistent. Ze zijn afhankelijk van en onderworpen aan het grotere politiek. Hun meest onderscheidende kenmerk is dat ze kansen bieden voor dramatische rituelen die de interne regels van een maatschappij en de categorieën van lidmaatschap bevestigen of herdefiniëren. Back to top Hoofdstuk 15: De macht om dingen te veranderen Dit zijn strategieën die de inhoud van beslissingen veranderen door de macht van besluitvorming te verplaatsen naar andere mensen. Dit hoofdstuk gaat over beleidsoplossingen dat het hervormen van een besluitvormingsproces met zich mee brengt, of wat men ook wel noemt constitutioneel techniek. Verschillen typen van collectieve besluitvormingsprocessen brengen verschillende uitkomsten. De metafoor van mechanisme is dan ook dat de inhoud van beslissingen wordt gevormd door de structuur van een proces op een zo te zien automatische manier. Amerikanen hebben altijd de keuze gehad hoe ze hun overheid gingen vormen. Daarom zien ze een structuur nu ook als iets dat bij uitstek veranderbaar is in plaats van altijd vast. Het gaat echter veelal om te veranderen wie de beslissingen maakt en wie macht over iets heeft. In het vernaderen van de besluitvormingsstructuur staat wel iets op het spel, namelijk de macht om de sfeer van het beleid te beheren en controleren. Een roep om herstructurering is altijd een roep om het herverdelen van de macht. Elke keuze over de structuur van het gezag kan onderzocht worden vanuit twee perspectieven: laat het de treinen op tijd lopen? Oftewel: werkt het om het nominale probleem op te lossen? Dit is het niveau waarop de meeste beleidsevaluatie plaatsvindt. Maar de formulering van het probleem staat nooit echt vast en is voor iedereen anders. Wat is de aard van de gemeenschap dat wordt gevormd door het type gezagsstructuur dat gebruikt wordt om het probleem op te lossen? Wie is het recht gegeven om beslissingen te nemen over het probleem? Wien zijn stem geldt zowel voor het kiezen van leiders als voor het kiezen van beleid. Wie is onderschikt aan wie? We kunnen nu kijken hoe de constitutionele techniek werkt in verschillende variaties. Deze variaties zijn terugkerende zaken in de Amerikaanse politiek: verander het lidmaatschap van de besluitvormingsorgaan, verander de omvang van de besluitvormingsorgaan en verschuif de focus van besluitvorming tussen de federale, staat en lokale overheden. Het lidmaatschap De kwaliteit en de belangen van de mensen die beslissingen maken vormen de verschillende beslissingen die ze nemen. Dit werkt op twee niveaus in Amerika: het veranderen van de samenstelling van het electoraat (de kiezers) dat beslist over de vertegenwoordigers, of het veranderen van de identiteit van deze vertegenwoordigers zelf. De eerste gaat om de lidmaatschap van een groep stemmers, de tweede om de lidmaatschap van de groep ambtsdragers. Er zijn altijd groepen mensen die niet mogen stemmen, zoals kinderen. Exclusies zoals deze noemt men kiezers kwalificaties. De staat heeft een legitiem belang in het bepalen van deze kwalificaties. Strijd om de samenstelling van het electoraat is een contant onderwerp van beleidsconflicten. Ras en etniciteit als criteria voor de competentie van burgers is lang een van de centrale issues geweest in de Amerikaanse discussie over het recht om te stemmen. Ook over de ambtsdragers is veel discussie. Het gaat om de wetgevers of uitvoerders die de belangen van hun kiezers vertegenwoordigen. Door het veranderen van of de identiteit van de vertegenwoordigers of de mogelijkheid van kiezers om hen te controleren kunnen we de verschillende beslissingen veranderen die zij maken. Het vertegenwoordigen van kiezers kan meerdere betekenissen hebben: beschrijvende vertegenwoordiging betekent dat vertegenwoordigers die belangrijke demografische kenmerken delen met hun kiezers kunnen ook het beste hun belangen vertegenwoordigen. Mensen denken, voelen en redeneren hetzelfde. Substantieve vertegenwoordiging gaat uit van vertegenwoordigers die belangrijke beleidsovertuigingen en doelen delen met hun kiezers en daarom hun het beste kunnen vertegenwoordigen. Het gaat niet om uiterlijk, maar om waar om wie zij zorgen, wiens belangen ze najagen. De centrale test van vertegenwoordiging is toch uiteindelijk niet of vertegenwoordigers demografische kenmerken delen met kiezers, maar of ze verantwoordelijk zijn voor hun kiezers. Het is lastig om via het ras van mensen met vertegenwoordiging te werken. belangen van elke persoon of groepen zijn altijd multidimensioneel en een vertegenwoordigersysteem die opgezet is door rekening te houden met maar 1 kant negeert de belangen die aan andere kanten gedefinieerd zijn. Er zijn bijvoorbeeld donkere huiseigenaren en donkere huurders en bijvoorbeeld vrouwen die werkgevers zijn en vrouwen die werknemers zijn. Hun belangen zijn allemaal anders, terwijl ze van hetzelfde ras of geslacht zijn. Ook is het zo dat het eindeloos door kan gaan met beschrijvende vertegenwoordiging: moet elke etnische groep vertegenwoordigd worden in een eigen groep? En waar is de grens: stop je bij Mexicaans en Amerikaans of zijn de Mexicaans-Amerikanen ook een groep? Volgens de rechter Stevens moet men kijken naar historische aspecten. Er is nog een oplossing om bepaalde groepen belangen te vertegenwoordigen dat ook vaak geprobeerd is in Amerika. In plaats van dat men probeert om direct gelijkheid voor zwakke politieke groepen in de dominante instituties te krijgen, kan men ook alternatieven creëren of parallelle instituties om deze te vertegenwoordigen. Zo heeft de regering ooit eens ‘gemeenschap actie bureaus’ opgericht om federale subsidies voor job training, omscholing en andere antiarmoede programma’s te ondersteunen. Veranderen van de omvang James Madison schreef in de Federalist Paper no. 10 dat groter beter is. Hij heeft hier 3 argumenten voor: aangezien zelfs een kleine gemeenschap een bepaald minimum aantal van vertegenwoordigers nodig heeft, het aantal van hen wordt proportioneel groter in een kleine gemeenschap dan in een grotere. De proportie van de algemene bevolking die een ambt bekleden is gelijk in zowel kleine als grote gemeenschappen. Daarom zegt hij dat een grotere gemeenschap meer opties heeft voor ambtenaren en een grotere kans op de beste keuze. Een kleinere gemeenschap moet mensen kiezen uit hun midden, maar ze kunnen dan de minder gekwalificeerde mensen uitkiezen omdat ze gewoon geen andere keuze hebben. Madison dacht dat het moeilijker is voor een onwaardige kandidaat om te winnen van een groter aantal mensen dan van een kleiner aantal. In grotere groepen weten de mensen dat hun stemmen minder zwaar tellen, zodat ze dus minder cruciaal zijn. Hoe groter de gemeenschap is, hoe groter de variëteit van partijen en belangen en hoe minder de kans is op een meerderheid van de leden die een gemeenschappelijk belang heeft of een motief om de rechten van andere burgers aan te vallen. Toch kiest men in de Amerikaanse cultuur ook wel vaak voor besluitvorming in kleine groepen. Kleine groepen worden gezien als duidelijke weergaven van de menselijke waarden. Het is gebaseerd op persoonlijke, face-to-face relaties in plaats van bureaucratische kennis. Kleine groepen kunnen oplossingen bedenken met flexibiliteit en informele oplossingen, als ook met loyaliteit en kameraadschap om verschillen onderling weg te werken. Kleine groepen zijn ook meer bevorderlijk voor rationeel overleg omdat een klein aantal mensen met elkaar kan praten, luisteren, discussiëren, argumenteren ed. Stone vindt dat er nog een ander argument is waarom kleine politieke districten wel werken. Kleine groepen werken wel niet omdat ze (klaarblijkelijk) betere beleidsbeslissingen produceren, maar omdat ze grotere mogelijkheden voor individuele participatie geven. Madison redeneert: een kleiner gebied heeft een grotere ratio van ambtenaren vs burgers dan een groter gebied. Participatie is gewaardeerd voor de mate van ervaring het geeft aan individuen en voor de relatie het opricht. Als er meer participatie is dan is er meer dialoog en overleg, meer kans op vertrouwen en loyaliteit en het oplossen van conflicten met een maximale overweging van alle belangen. Een structuur van macht zoals kleine of grote gebieden moet niet gezien worden als een goed, maar als een middel om tot een gewenst einde te komen. Ook is het zo dat kleine gebieden beter zijn in het leveren van services zoals bescherming door de politie, maar dan grotere gebieden beter zijn in het zorgen voor nationale veiligheid. Het gaat er niet om of klein of groot mooier is, maar om wie dominant is in elke situatie. Het verborgen verhaal in elke strijd tussen klein en groot ligt in de strijd om de bijzondere belangen. Madison probeerde te voorkomen dat elke partij de publieke belangen of de belangen van anderen zou opofferen voor de eigen passies en belangen. Volgens hem is een partij of een minderheid of een meerderheid van burgers. De publieke belangen zijn voor Madison niet noodzakelijk hetgeen wat een meerderheid wil. Deze wil kan tegenovergesteld zijn aan de gemeenschapsbelangen. Madison had vele minder- en meerderheden kunnen noemen, zoals blank-donker, man-vrouw, gemiddelde-briljante mensen ed., maar hij noemde alleen maar eigendom. De meest algemene en duurzame bron van partijen zijn de verschillende en ongelijke verdeling van de eigendommen. Degene die ze hebben en degene die geen eigendom hebben, hebben verschillende belangen in de maatschappij. Hij probeert dus eigenlijk om te voorkomen dat de arme en zonder eigendom zittende meerderheid gaan samenwerken om de rijkdom en bezit te verdelen en gelijk te trekken. Oftewel: een inspanning om de economische elites ervan te overtuigen de Grondwet te ondersteunen door hen te garanderen dat hun eigendom van hen zal blijven als ze het regime dus steunen. Madison probeerde dus eigenlijk de macht in de handen van een bepaalde minderheid te houden. Veranderen van federalisme In een federaal systeem kennen ze problemen met centralisatie en decentralisatie. In een systeem met vele delen zal elk deel steeds minder mensen omvatten en visa versa: een perfect gecentraliseerd systeem heeft alleen maar 1 grote unit die beslissingen neemt voor iedereen. Politieke argumenten over federalisme zijn erg abstract en figuurlijk. Decentralisatie legt macht in handen van de mensen die dicht bij de problemen staan. De staat is een politiek laboratorium voor het experimenteren met nieuwe ideeën voordat ze op de hele natie worden toegepast. Voorstanders van centralisatie vinden dat het neerleggen van gezag in vele kleine delen zal leiden tot het domineren door lokale elites, het beleid zal hetzelfde blijven en weinig of geen verdeling van macht of rijkdom zal ontstaan. Op het oppervlak discussiëren veel politici en advocaten in termen van relatieve competentie van federale en staatsoverheid. Federalisme is dan meer een zaak van omvang en aantal besluitvormingsdelen: het is dan een zaak om macht. Hoe de verschillende delen aan elkaar verbonden moeten worden is dan erg lastig: wie moet gezag over wie krijgen? Het is een vorm van paradox: het combineert autonomie van de verschillende onderdelen met centrale autoriteit van nationale instituten. Deze combinatie van tegengestelde principes kan met woorden opgericht worden, maar dit verlicht de druk nog niet. Vele hebben het echter al wel op papier geprobeerd te zetten. Het cruciale punt in de beleidspolitiek is niet of een bepaalde verdeling van macht tussen federale delen, staat en lokale regeringen voor goede oplossingen zorgt, maar hoe dit zowel de politieke gezag als de materiële uitkomsten verdeelt. Is er wel een verschil tussen de verdelende uitkomsten van gecentraliseerde en gedecentraliseerde systemen? De federale regering zorgt vaak voor de verdeling. Dit komt omdat zij een brede belastingbasis hebben, die groter is dan die van de staten en steden. Een tweede reden is dat steden en staten relatief doordringbare grenzen hebben. Als zij proberen om te herverdelen dan kunnen individuen en bedrijven hun gebied verlaten om zo de hoge belastingen te ontduiken. De federale regering heeft redelijke ondoordringbare grenzen: mensen kunnen het land niet zomaar uitvluchten. Dit staat haaks op wat Madison heeft gezegd. Hij ging ervan uit dat de krachten die inkomen en eigendom gelijkmaken minder succeskansen hebben in grote nationale gebieden, waar het moeilijk is om een meerderheid te vormen. Maar hierboven zeggen we nu juist dat herverdeling makkelijker is op het nationale niveau omdat dat het enige niveau is met een soort van populatie in gevangenschap die geen kant op kan. Het effect van groei zorgt dat er meer restricties komen voor bijvoorbeeld de minderheden en de armen. De keuze om macht te verdelen om zo de groei van de lokale of staatsniveaus te beheersen beïnvloed de manier waarop voordelen en lasten van de groei verdeeld worden over de gemeenschappen. Groei zal ooit eens ergens gebeuren. Zolang als lokale gemeenschappen gezag behouden, kunnen zij de lasten van de groei verplaatsen. De eerste gemeenschappen die exclusief beleid zullen uitvaardigen zijn momenteel al de rijkste en ‘witste’. Lokale controle zal hierdoor alleen maar de verschillen tussen de gemeenschappen verharden. Als je deze macht naar de hogere niveaus verplaatst dan zal dit de mogelijkheid verhogen dat groei eerlijke verdeeld wordt over de gemeenschappen. Hogere niveaus van de overheid hebben meer kansen op het effectief herverdelen tussen de delen. Argumenten om gezag naar een hoger niveau te verplaatsen zijn ingebed in termen van efficiëntie, rechtvaardigheid of publiek belang. Back to top Conclusie Politiek wordt gelijk geschaald met rationele besluitvorming. Politiek is chaotisch, onvoorspelbaar en een obstakel voor beleid. Beleid is potentieel een gebied van rationele analyse, objectiviteit, trouw aan de waarheid en een achtervolging van welzijn van de gehele samenleving. Om beleid uit politiek te halen zegt eigenlijk dan analyse en politiek twee aparte en onderscheidende activiteiten zijn. Charles Lindblom gelooft niet dat ze vaak apart zijn. Er zijn twee kanten: eerst heb je rationele analyse vormen die iets meer als politiek zijn. Lindblom kwam bijvoorbeeld met een minder ambitieuze vorm van rationele analyse, namelijk doormodderen of incrementalisme waarin beleidsmaker vele kleine doelen formuleren en alleen maar een aantal alternatieven bekijken. Amitai Etzioni kwam met gemixte scannen dat de fundamentele rationalistische besluitvorming combineert met incrementalisme. Dan heb je ook modellen van politiek die iets meer analyse zijn. Beleidsmaken is hier een sequentieel proces, ook al denkt niet iedereen dat in de praktijk al deze stappen keurig worden doorlopen. De werkelijke procesvorming wordt gezien als een benadering van de norm met af en toe of zelfs frequente afwijkingen. Stone vindt dat beredenerend analyseren noodzakelijk politiek is. Het gaat altijd om de keuzes om iets te op te nemen of juist niet en om de wereld te zien op een bepaalde manier terwijl andere manieren beschikbaar zijn. beleidsanalyse is politieke argumenteren en visa versa. Metaforisch vs. Berekend redeneren Het rationele model van besluitvorming is redenering door berekenen. Het gaat om het schatten van de consequenties van handelingen, waaraan waarden worden toegerekend en de handelingen met de beste resultaten berekend worden. Rekenen kan niet gebeuren tot dat we zaken gecategoriseerd hebben. Categorieën zijn menselijke mentale constructies in een wereld dat een steeds continuüm, of voortzettingen, heeft. De wereld bestaat uit voortzettingen, geen categorieën. De categorieën zijn door de mens gemaakt; de natuur heeft ze niet en kent alleen een voorzetting. Waar mensen om vechten en om geven zijn interpretaties van persoonlijkheid, oorlogen en economieën. Als we een voortdurende wereld zien dan is er een oneindige keuze over hoe te classificeren. Beleid gaat steeds over classificatie en differentiatie, over hoe we (zouden) moeten classificeren in een wereld waar categorieën niet gegeven zijn. Politiek redeneren is daarom een redenering over gelijkheid en verschillen, van goed en slecht of goed en kwaad. De beredenering is secundair. Beleidsargumentatie gaat over het al dan niet opnemen van iets. Al de vormen van probleem definitie in deel 3 van het boek zijn technieken om te classificeren. Het beredeneren door rekenen wordt alleen pas belangrijk in politiek als er categorieën bedacht zijn. Politieke redenering als strategische vertegenwoordiging Politiek argumenteren is deel van een strijd om controle. Politieke redenering is metaforisch en dit zien we in drie elementen die het onderscheiden van pure poëtische metaforen. de inzet is hoger: dichters proberen het publiek te overtuigen van de juistheid van een metafoor, maar politieke actoren vechten om het beheren van de onmiddellijke en concrete beleidsresultaten. Politieke redenering is deel van een wedstrijd over beleid, daarom is het altijd gericht tot een gewelddadig publiek. Een politieke metafoor heeft altijd een tegenstander, een vechtende metafoor. Deze tegenstander kan bijvoorbeeld de huidige status zijn, de normale manier van het kijken naar zaken of wat een gemeenschap voor lief neemt. Maar het kan ook een specifieke tegenstander zijn zoals een politieke actor die alternatieve metaforen verdedigt. Politieke redenering is strategisch. Het is ontworpen om kieskringen te ontwerpen, om oude allianties te breken en nieuwe te creëren en om mensen tot actie te krijgen. Paradoxen van beleid In een wereld van continuüm zijn de grenzen erg onstabiel. Op elke grens is het dilemma van classificatie: wie of wat hoort aan welke kant? In het beleid van de politiek roepen deze dilemma’s intense passies op omdat de classificaties voordelen en nadelen, beloningen en straffen en macht of geen macht verlenen. Elke type van beleidsoplossing zoals neergelegd in deel 4 kan gezien worden als een manier om grenzen op te zetten en te behouden. De waarde van politieke argumenten en redenering Politieke redenering is een proces van overtuiging. De zoektocht voor criteria om classificaties te rechtvaardigen leidt ons tot het articuleren van wensen, voorkeuren en visies. Politieke redenering ziet eruit alsof het geen grenzen heeft, maar het dwingt ons toch om samen te werken met een publiek, om anderen te overtuigen en verder te kijken dan onze eigen wil voor gronden voor handelingen. In het proces van het articuleren van een redenering laten we elkaar zien hoe we de wereld zien. Back to top Join World Supporter Log in or create your free account Why create an account?

Inleiding: Stone introduceert het concept van politieke paradoxen waarbij beleidsdoelen en politieke doelen conflicteren. Ze gebruikt het voorbeeld van een draagmoeder om de complexiteit van politieke keuzes te illustreren. Hoofdstuk 1-5: Stone beschrijft de politieke gemeenschap en bekritiseert het idee van puur rationele besluitvorming. Ze stelt dat politiek redeneren vaak metaforisch is en dat samenlevingen beïnvloed worden door groepsdruk en loyaliteit. Besluitvormingsprocessen zijn verweven met politieke spelletjes die ideeën en belangen beïnvloeden, en het concept van algemeen belang is een constante strijd in de politieke arena. Hoofdstuk 6-10: Stone bespreekt strategische vertegenwoordiging in politiek, hoe metaforen en getallen worden gebruikt om politieke conflicten te framen, en hoe problemen worden gedefinieerd om steun voor bepaalde posities te mobiliseren. Ze benadrukt het belang van vertegenwoordiging en argumenteert dat bepaalde beleidsinstrumenten, zoals beloningen, straffen en regels, ingezet worden voor machtsverschuivingen binnen besluitvormingsprocessen. Conclusie: Stone concludeert dat politieke besluitvorming een artistieke en strategische activiteit is die niet volledig kan worden begrepen door uitsluitend rationele of objectieve analyse. Politieke beslissingen zijn grotendeels afhankelijk van hoe problemen worden geïnterpreteerd en de machtsdynamiek achter de beleidsontwikkeling. Politieke redenering is geen rechte lijn naar de waarheid maar een kunst van overtuigen en het opbouwen van allianties."},{"instruction":"Vat de tekst nu samen in 25 duidelijke bullet points en sluit af met een samenvatting in 50 woorden.","output":"1.

In het voorbeeld wordt een Amerikaanse vrouw gecontracteerd door een koppel om voor hen een kind te dragen. Echter, na de geboorte wenst de vrouw het kind te houden, wat leidt tot een juridisch gevecht over de geldigheid en interpretatie van het contract. De betekenis van deze kwestie in de context van het totale verhaal is veelzijdig: 1. **Ambiguïteit in Beleid en Wet**: Het draagmoedergeval benadrukt de interpretatieve aard van beleid en wettelijke overeenkomsten, en toont aan hoe verschillende kijkhoeken leiden tot verschillende conclusies over wat juist is. Dit kan leiden tot paradoxale situaties binnen de politieke besluitvorming. 2. **Conflicterende Belangen**: Dit scenario legt ook de inherente conflicten binnen politieke beslissingen bloot. Wat voor de één een duidelijke overeenkomst leek, wordt door de ander als betwistbaar gezien. Dit weerspiegelt bredere spanningen tussen persoonlijke vrijheden, contractuele verplichtingen en ethische overwegingen. 3. **Metaforen en Framing**: Stone gebruikt de draagmoederkwestie om te demonstreren hoe metaforen gebruikt worden in politiek redeneren. De vraag of dit een contract van dienstverlening of van verkoop van een baby is, illustreert hoe taal en framing het begrip van een politieke kwestie beïnvloeden. 4. **De Rol van de Rechtbank**: Deze situatie onderstreept ook de rol die de rechtbanken spelen in het vormgeven van beleid door casuïstiek. Juridische beslissingen in individuele gevallen kunnen brede implicaties hebben voor beleidsvorming. 5. **Policy Making als een Artistiek Proces**: De draagmoederkwestie laat zien dat beleidsvorming niet alleen technisch of rationeel is maar ook een creatief of artistiek proces dat ruimte biedt voor verschillende perspectieven. In bredere zin, vertegenwoordigt de draagmoederkwestie het soort ingewikkelde morele en juridische dilemma's die vaak opduiken in beleidsarena's, en illustreert het de diepgaande uitdagingen die betrokken zijn bij politieke besluitvorming. Het toont aan dat politieke problemen vaak geen eenvoudige technische oplossingen hebben en dat het maken van beleid om een gevoelige afweging van verschillende waarden en belangen vraagt."},{"instruction":"Wat is precies de paradox in deze draagmoeder kwestie? Een paradox is immers een schijnbare tegenstelling en geen echte!","output":"De paradox in de draagmoederkwestie, zoals aangehaald in Deborah Stone's \\"Policy Paradox\\", ligt in de schijnbaar tegenstrijdige interpretaties en uitkomsten die voortvloeien uit dezelfde situatie, afhankelijk van het toegepaste perspectief of het gebruikte wettelijke raamwerk. Aan de ene kant hebben we een contract tussen de draagmoeder en het koppel dat expliciet de voorwaarden uiteenzet waarbij de draagmoeder in overeenstemming met het contract instemt om een kind te dragen en na de geboorte af te staan aan het koppel. Juridisch gezien lijkt het contract helder en recht-toe-recht-aan: de draagmoeder heeft een dienst geleverd en moet zich aan de overeenkomst houden. Aan de andere kant is er de persoonlijke, emotionele en ethische kant van de kwestie waarbij de draagmoeder, na de geboorte van het kind, een sterke moederlijke band heeft gevormd en ervoor kiest het kind te willen houden, aangezien het kind biologisch van haar is. Dit plaatst haar in een positie waar de affectieve band met het kind in direct conflict staat met de contractuele afspraken die ze heeft gemaakt. De paradox hier is dat het contract de transactie behandelt als een dienstverlening, wat normaal en legitiem is binnen commerciële afspraken, terwijl de biologische en emotionele band tussen de draagmoeder en het kind het contract in iets veel meer persoonlijks en minder zakelijks transformeert. Het op het spel staan van een menselijk leven en moederlijk recht roept ethische vragen op over de verkooopbaarheid van kinderen en baarmoederdiensten. Dit weerspiegelt de bredere paradox binnen politieke besluitvorming, waar regels en contracten schijnbare duidelijkheid en eenvoud bieden, terwijl persoonlijke menselijke ervaringen en ethische overwegingen schijnbare tegenstrijdigheden en complexiteit inbrengen."},{"instruction":"Zijn er historische praktijkgevallen van de draagmoeder kwestie bekend en hoe daarin de besluitvorming plaatsvond?","output":"Een van de meest bekende historische praktijkgevallen omtrent draagmoederschap is de zaak \\"In re Baby M\\" uit 1986 in de Verenigde Staten. In deze zaak ging het om een contract tussen William en Elizabeth Stern en Mary Beth Whitehead, waarin Whitehead als draagmoeder een kind zou dragen voor het koppel. De overeenkomst bepaalde dat Whitehead het kind na de geboorte zou afstaan aan de Sterns. Echter, na de geboorte weigerde Whitehead het kind af te geven en wilde ze het kind zelf opvoeden. De rechtszaak die volgde, zette de precedenten neer voor draagmoederschap en de juridische complexiteiten ervan. De aanvankelijke beslissing van de rechtbank erkende het contract als wettelijk geldig en kende het voogdijschap toe aan de Sterns, maar de beslissing werd later gedeeltelijk teruggedraaid door het Hooggerechtshof van New Jersey. Het Hof deed een aantal belangrijke uitspraken: - Het verklaarde betaald draagmoederschap illegaal in de staat New Jersey. - Het stelde dat het draagmoederschapcontract tegen de openbare orde was. - Het verleende de biologische vader (William Stern) de voogdij en wees voogdijrechten toe aan Whitehead, waardoor ze omgangsrecht kreeg. De zaak \\"In re Baby M\\" belicht de ethische en juridische dilemma's die gepaard gaan met draagmoederschapsovereenkomsten en vormde een significante mijlpaal in de rechtspraak omtrent reproducerende technologieën en familiewetgeving. De besluitvorming in deze zaak, en in latere soortgelijke gevallen, heeft vaak draaide rond vragen van contractuele rechtsgeldigheid vs. het beste belang van het kind, de rechten van biologische ouders vs. voorgenomen ouders, en de grenzen van familiaal recht. Deze kwesties blijven evolueren, en de manier waarop staten en landen draagmoederschap behandelen verschilt aanzienlijk, sommigen verbieden het commerciële draagmoederschap volledig, terwijl anderen specifieke wetgeving hebben aangenomen om zowel de draagmoeder als de voorgenomen ouders te beschermen."},{"instruction":"User:You are a helpful assistant.

From 1585 to 1615, the omnipotent Shogunate, under the iron fist of the Toyotomi-shi, with the Toyotomi clan firmly holding the reins as the Daijō-daijin, guided the realm through turbulent seas of war and diplomacy with strategic brilliance and an unyielding will to expand. At the seat of imperial glory rested the ceremonial monarchs, the Daiwa no Koushitsu/Genasa, revered heads of state and chief officiants of Shinto. Their divine lineage harkening back to the mythic age of gods and emperors provided an unbreakable spiritual bond that sanctified the military dictatorship’s earthly authority. This era of power and conquest witnessed the Bakufu's titanic clashes during the Imjin Wars, a conflagration that consumed the years 1592 to 1598 in flames of relentless warfare. Entwined by fate, an unexpected twist of the winds would lead to a seismic shift in the region's power structure. As the Korean peninsula, Hanguk, lay vulnerable beneath the specter of war, a treacherous blade, driven by the hands of a yangban—nurtured by a culture of servility to the awe-inspiring Ming—struck down Yi Sun-sin. This admiral of legend, the naval genius of Dae Joseon-gug, now lay motionless, assassinated. With a masterstroke defined by the silence of muskets and the stilled roar of the panokseons, the impenetrable maritime shield crafted by the Joseon Sugun, especially the elite Haebyeong forces, lay breached. The Toyotomi-led samurai thus plunged the burning tip of conquest deeper, scorching through the sinews of Korea, snatching the fate of Hanguk from its sovereign masters, the Jeonju Wangsil of Yi. In this world of might and shadow, the rigorous grip upon Korea would go unchallenged. The silhouettes of Japanese banners flew high over the peninsula as an eternal testament to the prowess and guile of the Toyotomi dynasty. The seizure of Korea unlocked the gates to the fabled land of the Great Ming, the Dà Míngguō. Pillars of smoke rose from the heart of Nanking as the Imperial city fell to the relentless siege of Japanese might. In a bitter draught, the Zhu imperial household, under duress and the thunder of Japanese war drums, conceded to a shameful armistice. Amidst the confluence of East Asian destinies, the Jurchen tribes, warriors of the frigid northlands of Manjügo, rose up to decimate a Ming multitude already weakened and divided by Japanese valor. Swift as the winter wind, they declared the birth of a new empire—the Great Qing—which, in its stormy emergence, echoed the distant conquests of the past. In a world reeling from the onslaught of conquests and shifting allegiances, the Southern Song—Nán Míng—remained steadfast, a defiant ember of the fallen dynasty. Abutted by indomitable mountains and nourished by the rich waters of the South, they endured as bastions against the swelling tides of the Great Qing. Yet the heart of Nán Míng pulsed with aspirations beyond Meridian survival. With zealous ambition, they surged forth, toppling the reign of the Tây Sơn in Đại Việt, securing the territories of Prâtés Kâmpŭchéa, and establishing supremacy over the mosaic of Laotian kingdoms. As the celestial wheel turned, the Southern Ming cascaded into a metamorphosis unforeseen. The great dragon of the Zhu yielded to the phoenix of the South, the Nhà Nguyễn, who carried the title of Emperors of Vietnam, Đại Việt Nam. Thus, an empyreal renaissance dawned upon a dynasty rebirthed. The Age of Rival Thrones—the new era of the Three Kingdoms—saw the East Asian realm cast into a great tumult as three sovereign entities, the Dai Nihon Teikoku Bakufu, now under the disciplined watch of the Tokugawa, the burgeoning might of the Great Qing, and the resurgent phoenix of Đại Việt Nam, vied for supremacy. Wars and whispers of truces swirled amidst the imperial courts, as treaties were inked and borders drawn upon the canvas of human lives and ambitions. Three great cultures—the militaristic resolve of the Japanese, the stoic resilience of the Qing, and the transformative vigor of Đại Việt Nam—converged like tides under the moon’s command, each ebbing and flowing in the pursuit of dominance and splendor. Thus, the annals of history recorded the echoes of an alternate tale, one where the threads of fate were pulled with the sagacity and strength of the Toyotomi, etching their name into an immortal epoch where the archipelago’s shadow extended beyond the sunrise, recasting the visage of the East Asian world in its indomitable image."},{"instruction":"User:You are a helpful assistant.

intriguing scenario where the Great Ming State (Dà Míngguō), the absolute imperial East Asian monarchy and the last of the imperial monarchic dynastic states generated by the traditional Han Chinese imperial dynastic system, undergoes a historical rejuvenation. The esteemed ruling house, the Imperial House of Zhu (Zhūshì Huángshì), once presided over Han China (Zhōngguó), excluding the peripheral regions such as Manchuria (Dongbei), Inner Mongolia (Nèi Měnggǔ), Tibet (Xiziang), Ningxia, and East Turkestan (Xingjiang), from 1368 to 1644. After ceding Zhōngguó to the Manchu-led Great Qing, the Ming dynasty retreated and eventually came to govern Vietnam (Nước Việt) first as the Empire of Vietnam (Việt Nam Quốc) from 1802 to 1945, followed by the State of Vietnam (Quốc gia Việt Nam) from 1949 to 1955. The documented narrative unfolds with the unlikely revival of the Great Ming as the ruling government of post-revolutionary Zhōngguó following the Xinhai Revolution (10 October 1911 – 12 February 1912), which overthrew the Great Qing Empire (Dà Qīng Diguō) led by the Imperial House of Aisin-Gioro from its homeland, Manchuria (Manjügo), over vast territories from 1644 to 1912. The Great Ming's phoenix-like rebirth commences post-Xinhai Revolution, with the establishment of the Republic of China (Zhōnghuá Mínguó), which initially administers Zhōngguó from 1912 to 1928. This is followed by a turbulent era where the republic acts as the Reorganized National Government of the Republic of China (Zhōnghuá Mínguó Guómín Zhèngfǔ) from 1940 to 1945. Post-Qing, this provisional entity serves as a transitional regency government, whose mission is to stabilize the realm while paving the way for the rightful restoration of the Chinese monarchy. The Restoration of 1917: The Great Ming Resurrected The enrapturing tapestry of our alternate history envisions a state influenced by the mystique of the past and the dynamism of the present. In 1917, principal forces within the Republic of China, comprised of monarchists, intellectuals, and the public weary of republican frailties, orchestrate the reinstatement of the Great Ming as the governing body of an independent Chinese nation. The Zhu family, displaying adaptability to the transformations of modern governance, accept the necessity of constitutional reform. The events leading up to this moment are filled with back-channel negotiations, patronage, and a burgeoning public sentiment casting the Zhu family not as bygone rulers but as symbols of national unity and cultural continuity. This nostalgic undercurrent for the Ming aligns with a strategic longing for stability, especially from those who wish to perserve traditional values within a modern statecraft template. Transition without Turmoil: From Republic to Constitutional Imperial Democracy The most astonishing aspect of this transformation lies in its peaceful nature—a rarity in historical power transfers. Through skillful diplomacy and a consensus-driven approach, the newly restored Ming embrace the structures put in place by the Republic of China. The Zhu ensure a smooth transition by adopting a dual governing system termed as 'Constitutional Imperial Absolute Democratic Monarchy'. This structure retains the Emperor as the ceremonial figurehead with symbolic and cultural power, while a democratic parliament manages the government's day-to-day affairs. In this system, free and fair elections determine representatives, with the Imperial House of Zhu playing a role akin to that of constitutional monarchies seen in some European nations—albeit retaining more substantive spiritual and cultural authority. The 20th Century Under Ming Rule: A Distinct Panorama The resurgence of the Great Ming and its unique administrative style leave an indelible mark on the events of the 20th century. The early years of Ming restoration encourage other Asian monarchies to consider reforms that bridge tradition with modern electoral mechanisms. A new coherency in national identity fosters a social and economic renaissance where technology, agriculture, and commerce flourish. Internationally, a stable and prosperous Chinese empire, one that reinforces monarchical governance while embracing democratic elements, stands as a beacon of possibility across the continent. It negotiates its place on the world stage with newfound confidence, leveraging its cultural heritage and diplomatic acumen to carve out a distinct identity that is neither fully aligned with Western powers nor completely insular. In terms of geopolitics, the robust Ming State serves as a moderating influence in the Pacific, often mediating between different spheres of influence and occasionally averting conflicts that in our timeline escalated into full-blown wars. The famously non-aligned stance of the Ming during global events, their economic heft, and cultural diplomacy contribute to a reshaped global landscape that is less polarized and more interconnected. Conclusion: The Lasting Legacy of a Restored Monarchy The re-establishment of the Great Ming in 1917 indeed becomes the nidus for a series of historical ripples that reshape the fabric of East Asian and world history. The seemingly paradoxical blend of Imperial tradition with democratic principles proves to be a remarkable experiment, one that spawns an era of prosperity and cultural resurgence within the re-imagined borders of an ancient civilization. As historians, our dissection of this alternate timeline reveals the resilience and dynamism of political institutions and the way in which historical symbols can be harnessed to foster unity and progress. The Great Ming dynasty's transformation into a constitutional entity stands out as a testament to the potential for traditional systems to adapt and thrive amidst the tidal waves of modernity, leaving an indelible legacy upon the canvas of world history."},{"instruction":"Può dar fastidio sentire il suono del battito del cuore di una persona?","output":"Sì, è possibile per alcune persone provare fastidio o persino ansia nell'ascoltare il battitio del cuore di una persona, fenomeno noto come \\"misofonia\\" o \\"fono-fobia\\" in casi specifici. La misofonia è una condizione in cui specifici suoni suscitano reazioni emotive estreme come irritazione, rabbia o angoscia in alcuni individui. Tuttavia, non tutti i disturbi legati all'udito dei battiti cardiaci sono classificabili come misofonia. Le reazioni negative al sentire il battito del cuore possono anche dipendere dalla situazione o dal contesto, come: 1. **Ansia e ipocondria**: Persone che soffrono di ansia o che hanno tendenze ipocondriache possono trovare l'ascolto del battito cardiaco stressante perché lo associano a preoccupazioni per la salute. 2. **Intimità**: Ascoltare il battito del cuore di un'altra persona, in particolare in un contesto intimo o silenzioso, può essere scomodo o invadente per alcune persone, in quanto può rappresentare una vicinanza fisica ed emotiva che non tutti apprezzano o con cui tutti si sentono a proprio agio. 3. **Percezione amplificata**: Alcune persone hanno una maggiore sensibilità ai suoni interni del corpo (fenomeno chiamato \\"introcezione\\"). Questa ipersensibilità può rendere l'esperienza di ascoltare un battito cardiaco particolarmente accentuata e potenzialmente spiacevole. 4. **Associare il suono a esperienze negative**: Se una persona associa il suono del battito cardiaco a ricordi stressanti o traumatici, come un attacco di panico o un episodio medico, può sviluppare un avversione a quel suono. Se il disturbo causato dai battiti cardiaci o da altri suoni specifici interferisce con la qualità della vita di una persona, può essere utile cercare il sostegno di uno psicologo o di un altro professionista della salute mentale per apprendere strategie di coping e di gestione dell'ansia."},{"instruction":"Io intendevo: se una persona ascolta il suono del cuore di un'altra persona, può dar fastidio?","output":"Scusami per l'incomprensione iniziale.

Ecco alcuni motivi per cui potrebbe risultare scomodo: 1. **Sensibilità personale**: Come per altri suoni ripetitivi, alcune persone possono trovarsi infastidite o disturbate dal battito cardiaco di qualcun altro, specialmente se è forte o molto percettibile. 2. **Misofonia**: Alcune persone hanno una sensibilità estrema a certi tipi di suoni, inclusi quelli corporei come il battito del cuore, e possono sperimentare irritazione o disagio emotivo quando li ascoltano. 3. **Ansia**: Chi soffre di ansia potrebbe temere che il battito del cuore sia anormale o segno di una malattia, specialmente se il battito è veloce o irregolare, e questo può generare ansia o preoccupazione. 4. **Intimità e vulnerabilità**: L'ascolto del battito del cuore può essere molto intimo, e alcune persone potrebbero sentirsi a disagio o vulnerabili in questa situazione di vicinanza emotiva. 5. **Memorie o associazioni negative**: Se il suono del battito del cuore è associato a ricordi negativi o esperienze traumatiche, come malattie o eventi stressanti, ciò potrebbe suscitare reazioni emotive negative. 6. **Distrazione o concentrazione**: Il suono costante e ritmico di un battito cardiaco potrebbe distrarre o interrompere la concentrazione, specialmente se qualcuno sta cercando di concentrarsi o dormire in un ambiente silenzioso. Va detto, comunque, che non tutte le persone reagiranno allo stesso modo e alcune possono trovare il suono del battito del cuore rilassante o rassicurante. La percezione dei suoni è altamente individuale e influenzata da molteplici aspetti psicologici, culturali e situazionali."},{"instruction":"Se durante uno scenario, stessi abbracciando una ragazza avendo la mia testa appoggiata vicino al suo petto e lei dovesse chiedermi se le sto ascoltando il cuore, posso rispondere di sì specificando che è rilassante e rassicurante? in caso contrario, una semplice scura del tipo: Scusa, mi sono appoggiato troppo\\" andrebbe bene o ci sono altre varianti più leggere e amichevoli?","output":"La tua risposta dipenderà molto dal contesto e dal livello di intimità e comfort esistenti tra te e la ragazza.

È un suono rilassante e rassicurante, mi fa sentire più vicino a te.\\" Questa risposta trasmette affetto e può contribuire a creare un momento di connessione emotiva. Tuttavia, se non sei sicuro di come lei possa reagire, o se il livello di intimità non è molto profondo, potresti optare per una risposta più neutra e discreta, come: \\"Scusa, non me ne ero reso conto. Mi ero solo appoggiato comodamente.\\" Questa risposta è più leggera e mostra considerazione per il suo spazio personale senza entrare in dettagli che potrebbero essere interpretati come troppo intimi. In entrambi i casi, la cosa più importante è essere genuini e rispettosi nei confronti dei suoi sentimenti. La comunicazione non verbale, come il linguaggio del corpo e il tono della voce, sarà altrettanto importante nel trasmettere il tuo messaggio in modo appropriato.

Alcune possibili interpretazioni potrebbero essere: 1. **Curiosità**: Potrebbe essere una semplice domanda dettata dalla curiosità di capire cosa stai facendo o sentendo mentre sei così vicino a lei. 2. **Disagio**: Se la domanda è accompagnata da un tono incerto o un linguaggio del corpo che sembra ritraente, potrebbe indicare che si sente un po' a disagio con la vicinanza fisica o non è sicura della tua intenzione. 3. **Flirt**: Nel caso la domanda sia fatta in modo giocoso o seducente, potrebbe essere un modo di flirtare o di accrescere l'intimità tra voi, suggerendo un'apertura all'idea di essere vicini su un piano più personale. 4. **Condivisione emotiva**: La sua domanda potrebbe anche essere un modo per condividere una connessione emotiva, indicando che si sente vicina e a suo agio con te, e che trova l'interazione rassicurante o significativa. 5. **Verifica della propria intenzione**: Può anche essere un modo per lei di comprendere le tue intenzioni, per vedere se stai cercando un momento romantico o semplicemente conforto in un abbraccio amichevole. Per capire esattamente cosa significhi la domanda, ascolta con attenzione il suo tono, osserva il suo linguaggio del corpo e valuta l'ambiente e le circostanze in cui l'interazione si svolge. La comunicazione aperta e rispettosa è la chiave: puoi anche chiederle in modo schietto e gentile cosa si aspetta dalla situazione, per essere sicuro di non fraintendere le sue intenzioni."},{"instruction":"Come faccio a capire?","output":"Per comprendere meglio le intenzioni dietro la domanda di una ragazza su se stai ascoltando il suo cuore durante un abbraccio, presta attenzione a questi aspetti: 1. **Linguaggio del corpo**: Osserva se il suo linguaggio del corpo è aperto e rilassato, o se sembra tense o nervosa. Un corpo rilassato potrebbe indicare comfort ed apertura, mentre una postura chiusa o tensione potrebbe segnalare disagio. 2. **Contatto visivo**: Il contatto visivo può essere un buon indicatore di fiducia e intimità. Se vi guardate negli occhi in modo sostenuto, potrebbe essere un segno di connessione, mentre evitare il contatto visivo potrebbe suggerire imbarazzo o incertezza. 3. **Espressione facciale**: Un sorriso genuino o un'espressione gioiosa potrebbe indicare che la domanda è fatta in modo giocoso e che lei si sente bene con l'interazione. Al contrario, un'espressione confusa o preoccupata potrebbe significare che ha riserve sull'intimità dell'abbraccio. 4. **Tono di voce**: Un tono giocoso o affettuoso può suggerire flirt o intimità emotiva, mentre un tono piatto o incerto può indicare un certo disagio o la semplice voglia di chiarire la situazione. 5. **Contesto**: Il setting in cui vi trovate e il vostro rapporto generale possono offrire ulteriori indizi. Se siete soli e avete una relazione intima, potrebbe trattarsi di flirt. Se siete solo amici e in un luogo pubblico, potrebbe semplicemente essere una verifica della tua intenzione. 6. **Parole**: Le parole che accompagnano la sua domanda possono fornire ulteriori spunti. Parole affettuose o domande più approfondite circa le tue sensazioni possono indicare un interesse per una connessione più profonda. 7. **La vostra storia**: Prendi in considerazione il tipo di relazione che hai avuto fino ad ora. Se avete un passato di flirt o di intimità emotiva, è più probabile che la questione sia di natura romantica. Infine, se hai dubbi, puoi semplicemente rispondere in modo sincero e poi, con delicatezza e rispetto, indagare sulle sue intenzioni con una domanda diretta ma gentile. Potresti dire qualcosa come: \\"Sento il tuo cuore, e mi fa sentire connesso a te. È strano per te?\\" La sua risposta ti darà ulteriori indizi su come si sente."},{"instruction":"Perché è così visto male il sentire il battito del cuore di una persona?","output":"Sentire il battito del cuore di una persona non è intrinsecamente visto male; al contrario, può essere percepito come un'esperienza molto intima e personale che molte persone trovano confortante e connettente. Tuttavia, ci possono essere alcuni motivi culturali, personali o situazionali per cui in certi contesti questo potrebbe essere visto in una luce meno positiva. Ecco alcuni motivi per cui ascoltare il battito del cuore di qualcun altro potrebbe essere mal visto o causare disagio in determinate situazioni: 1. **Intimità personale**: Il battito del cuore è un segno vitale molto personale e intimo. Sentire il cuore di qualcuno può essere percepito come un'invadenza nello spazio personale se non esiste un livello di intimità o fiducia adeguato tra le due persone. 2. **Vulnerabilità**: Alcune persone possono sentirsi vulnerabili o esposte quando qualcuno ascolta il loro battito cardiaco, simile alla sensazione che si potrebbe avere quando qualcuno legge il proprio diario. Potrebbe sollevare ansia o insicurezze riguardo alla propria salute o al proprio corpo. 3. **Contesto culturale e sociale**: In alcune culture o contesti sociali, un'interazione così fisicamente vicina potrebbe non essere appropriata o accettabile, soprattutto tra persone che non hanno una relazione stretta. 4. **Associatività negativa**: Alcune persone possono associare l'ascolto del battito cardiaco a esperienze negative, come procedure mediche o eventi stressanti, e quindi potrebbero non apprezzare questa esperienza. 5. **Mancanza di consenso**: Se il battito del cuore viene ascoltato senza il chiaro consenso di entrambe le parti, ciò potrebbe essere percepito come un comportamento invadente e inappropriato. 6. **Misinterpretazione delle intenzioni**: C'è anche la possibilità che ascoltare il battito del cuore possa essere interpretato come un gesto romantico o sessuale, il che potrebbe causare disagio se tale interpretazione non è reciprocamente desiderata o intesa. 7. **Misofonia**: Alcune persone possono soffrire di misofonia, una condizione in cui specifici suoni, compresi i battiti del cuore, possono causare irritazione, rabbia, o disagio emotivo. In sintesi, la percezione dell'ascolto del battito del cuore di un'altra persona dipende da molti fattori, e in circostanze appropriate, può essere una manifestazione di connessione e affetto. La chiave è la sensibilità reciproca e il consenso alle interazioni fisiche e emotive."},{"instruction":"Quindi in generale senza il chiaro consenso e una limpido chiarimento dell'intento, questa azione è sbagliata e non etica?","output":"Esattamente. Nel caso di qualsiasi tipo di interazione fisica ed emotiva che coinvolga un livello di intimità, come l'ascoltare il battito del cuore di qualcuno, il consenso e la chiarezza dell'intenzione sono essenziali. Rispetto e consenso sono i fondamenti di interazioni etiche e appropriate, specialmente in situazioni intime. Toccare o avvicinarsi fisicamente a qualcuno per sentire il suo battito cardiaco senza il suo chiaro permesso potrebbe essere percepito come una violazione dello spazio personale e come un comportamento inappropriato o addirittura molesto. Così come vorresti che i tuoi confini fossero rispettati, anche gli altri meritano lo stesso rispetto. Ecco alcune linee guida per assicurarsi che le azioni siano etiche e rispettose: 1. **Chiedere il Permesso**: Prima di entrare nello spazio personale di qualcuno in un modo che potrebbe essere considerato intimo, chiedi se la persona è a proprio agio con il contatto. 2. **Comunicazione**: Discutete le vostre intenzioni in anticipo in modo da essere entrambi sulla stessa lunghezza d'onda riguardo a ciò che è accettabile. 3. **Leggere i Segnali Non Verbali**: Anche se una persona concorda verbalmente, sta a te leggere i suoi segnali non verbali per assicurarti che si senta veramente a suo agio con l'interazione. 4. **Rispettare i Confini**: Se in qualsiasi momento una delle parti si sente a disagio, è importante rispettare il suo desiderio di porre fine all'interazione fisica immediatamente. 5. **Cultura e contesto**: Considera il contesto culturale, sociale e la situazione individuale, poiché ciò che è accettabile in un contesto potrebbe non esserlo in un altro. Ricordati che il consenso non è solo una questione legale, ma anche una questione di rispetto e cura per l'altro, e dovrebbe essere acquisito prima di qualsiasi interazione intima."},{"instruction":"Quanto bisogna essere legati amichevolmente con una ragazza affinché lei possa farsi ascoltare il suono del cuore senza problemi e che sappia precisamente le mie intenzioni?","output":"Non c'è una regola fissa o una misura standard di intimità che garantisca che qualcuno sarà a proprio agio condividendo qualcosa di così personale come l'atto di farsi ascoltare il battito del cuore. Questo tipo di condivisione dipende dalla dinamica individuale tra due persone e dal loro livello di comfort e di fiducia reciproca. Ecco alcune considerazioni chiave che possono influenzare questa dinamica: 1. **Il Livello di Intimità Esistente**: Se avete già condiviso momenti intimi o personali, potrebbe essere più probabile che sia a suo agio con una tale condivisione. L'intimità non è solo fisica; comprende anche la vicinanza emotiva. 2. **Comunicazione Aperta**: Avere una comunicazione aperta e onesta può aiutare a chiarire le tue intenzioni in modo che non ci siano malintesi. Parlate di ciò che vi fa sentire a vostro agio e di ciò che non vi fa sentire a vostro agio. 3. **Fiducia**: La fiducia è fondamentale in ogni tipo di relazione, sia essa amicizia o romantica. Se c'è fiducia, lei potrebbe sentirsi più sicura e a proprio agio condividendo momenti intimi, come l'ascolto del battito del cuore. 4. **Rispetto dei Confini**: Ogni persona ha propri limiti e confini personali. È importante rispettare tali limiti e procedere solo se entrambi vi sentite a vostro agio. 5. **La Responsività ai Segnali Non Verbali**: Osserva attentamente la sua risposta non verbale quando sei vicino a lei. Se lei si allontana o sembra tesa, potrebbe non essere il momento giusto. 6. **Consistenza nel Comportamento**: Mostra costantemente rispetto e cura nei suoi confronti. Se lei sa che sei una persona che rispetta i suoi confini e si prende cura dei suoi sentimenti, è più probabile che sia a suo agio con te. 7. **Le Sue Esperienze Passate**: Le esperienze passate possono influenzare il modo in cui lei percepisce e risponde all'intimità. Potrebbe essere necessario più tempo per costruire la comodità necessaria se ha avuto esperienze negative in passato. Ricorda che tutte le relazioni si sviluppano a ritmi diversi e ciò che è confortevole per una persona potrebbe non esserlo per un'altra. Non c'è un tempo specifico o un livello di amicizia dopo il quale è garantito che lei sarà a suo agio con una situazione intima come l'ascolto del suo battito cardiaco. La comprensione e la reciprocità sono fondamentali; ascolta e comunica con lei, e lascia che sia il conforto e la fiducia reciproca a guidare tali momenti intimi."},{"instruction":"In uno scenario ipotetico, se fossi seduto di fianco insieme a una ragazza, gli chiedessi se posse abbracciarla e mi metto con la testa vicina alla zona delle costole o comunque vicino al petto, andrebbe bene o è troppo sgradevole? si sentirebbe a suo agio?","output":"In uno scenario ipotetico, la risposta a queste domande dipenderà fortemente dal contesto, dal tipo di relazione che hai con la ragazza e da come lei percepisce la vicinanza fisica in generale. Se chiedi esplicitamente il permesso di abbracciarla e lei acconsente, questo è già un buon segno, perché significa che è almeno a suo agio con l'idea di un certo livello di contatto fisico. Tuttavia, dove posizioni esattamente la testa durante l'abbraccio può influenzare il suo livello di comfort. Ecco alcuni punti chiave da considerare: 1. **Consenso**: Hai fatto bene a chiedere il consenso prima di abbracciarla, il che è fondamentale per rispettare i suoi confini personali. 2. **Posizione**: Anche con il consenso per un abbraccio, appoggiare la tua testa vicino al suo petto potrebbe essere visto come più intimo o personale. È importante prestare attenzione alla sua reazione quando lo fai. Se sembra a disagio o si muove, è importante rispettare il suo spazio e ritirarsi. 3. **Comfort della ragazza**: Il comfort è molto individuale. Alcune persone potrebbero non sentirsi a proprio agio con una tale vicinanza, specialmente se non ci sono state interazioni simili in precedenza che abbiano stabilito un livello di intimità. 4. **Natura della relazione**: Se la tua relazione con la ragazza è di natura amichevole e non romanticamente intima, lei potrebbe essere sorpresa o non trovarsi a suo agio con la tua testa così vicino al suo petto, anche se ha acconsentito a un abbraccio. 5. **Comunicazione durante l'abbraccio**: Se noti qualche esitazione da parte sua o se sei in dubbio sul suo livello di comfort, potresti chiederle in modo gentile e rispettoso se va bene o se preferisce che tu sposti la testa. In definitiva, non c'è un modo universale per determinare se qualcuno si sentirà a proprio agio con una specifica azione o posizione durante un abbraccio, perché ognuno ha diversi livelli di comfort personali. Essere attenti, rispettosi e sensibili ai segnali verbali e non verbali dell'altra persona ti aiuterà a capire se quello che stai facendo è appropriato o se dovresti cambiare approccio."},{"instruction":"Quali sarebbero i punti più appropriati?","output":"Se hai ricevuto il consenso per un abbraccio e vuoi assicurarti di mantenere un livello di appropriatenza e rispetto, considera i seguenti punti per quanto riguarda la tua posizione: 1. **Sulle spalle**: Questo è generalmente il modo più neutro e meno invasivo per abbracciare qualcuno. Puoi anche mettere un braccio attorno alle spalle in modo amichevole. 2. **Schiena superiore**: Un abbraccio intorno alla parte superiore della schiena è spesso visto come un gesto di supporto e può essere appropriato in molte situazioni. 3. **Schiena centrale**: Un abbraccio attorno alla metà della schiena può essere confortevole e adatto per amici e persone care con cui hai una certa intimità. 4. **Lati**: Se ti trovi di fianco a lei, un braccio leggermente attorno alla vita o semplicemente toccare il lato del suo corpo può essere appropriato in base al livello di comfort tra di voi. Ricorda che il modo migliore per assicurarti che il tuo abbraccio sia appropriato è cercare il consenso e prestare attenzione ai segnali che l'altra persona ti manda, sia verbalmente che non verbalmente. Ogni persona è diversa, e ciò che può andare bene per una potrebbe non andare bene per un'altra. Durante l'abbraccio, se senti che l'altra persona si irrigidisce, allontana il corpo, o sembra a disagio in qualsiasi modo, allenta immediatamente la presa e rispetta il suo spazio. La chiave è sempre la comunicazione, il rispetto reciproco e l'attenzione al comfort dell'altra persona."},{"instruction":"Quindi non esiste una zona sicura e precisa?","output":"Non esiste una \\"zona sicura\\" standard o universale per tutti, poiché il comfort di ciascun individuo rispetto al contatto fisico può variare ampiamente a seconda della loro personalità, esperienze passate, cultura, il tipo di relazione che condividono e altre preferenze personali. Tuttavia, ci sono alcune linee guida generali che possono aiutarti a navigare la situazione con rispetto e consapevolezza: 1. **Bracci leggermente attorno alle spalle**: È spesso considerata una posizione socialmente accettabile per un abbraccio, specialmente in contesti amichevoli o di supporto. 2. **Un rapido \\"abbraccio di lato\\"**: Un tocco breve e leggero sui lati o sulla schiena, senza stringere o avvicinarsi troppo alla parte anteriore del corpo, tende ad essere interpretato come un gesto amichevole. 3. **Evita zone potenzialmente più sensibili**: Zone come il petto, il bacino e la zona inferiore della schiena sono generalmente considerate più personali e possono essere meno appropriate da toccare, specialmente se non c'è un livello di intimità consolidato o se non sei sicuro del livello di comfort dell'altra persona. 4. **Segui il consenso verbale e non verbale**: Chiedi sempre permesso prima di avvicinarti fisicamente e assicurati di interpretare correttamente la risposta dell'altra persona. Se l'altra persona sembra a suo agio e ricambia l'abbraccio, è probabile che il livello di contatto sia accettabile. Se mostra disagio o si tira indietro, devi rispettare immediatamente quei segnali. Ricorda che queste sono solo linee guida generali. La cosa migliore da fare è comunicare chiara e apertamente con la persona che hai intenzione di abbracciare in modo che entrambi possiate esprimere i vostri livelli di comfort e confini individuali. La comunicazione, il rispetto reciproco e la sensibilità alle reazioni dell'altra persona sono essenziali per mantenere l'appropriatezza e l'etica in qualsiasi interazione fisica."},{"instruction":"Perché il petto non si dovrebbe toccare in un momento di abbraccio? nemmeno per un conforto?","output":"Durante un abbraccio, la questione di toccare o meno il petto di una persona si riduce in gran parte al rispetto per lo spazio personale e ai confini individuali. Il petto è generalmente considerato una zona del corpo più privata e sensibile per molte persone, specialmente tra individui che non hanno una relazione estremamente intima o approvata per quel livello di contatto. Ecco alcuni motivi per cui si dovrebbe fare attenzione rispetto al toccare il petto di qualcuno durante un abbraccio: 1. **Intimità personale**: Il petto è spesso percepito come una zona personale e intima. Molte persone si sentono vulnerabili se questa area viene toccata da qualcuno che non è un partner romantico o un familiare molto vicino. 2. **Percezione culturale e sociale**: In molte culture, toccare il petto può essere visto come una violazione dei confini socialmente accetti, a meno che non ci sia una chiara comprensione o consenso tra le parti. 3. **Comfort e consenso**: Non tutti si sentono a proprio agio con un contatto così ravvicinato, specialmente da parte di persone al di fuori di un ristretto cerchio di intimità. Il comfort di una persona può cambiare in base al loro rapporto con l'altra persona, alla situazione e al contesto sociale. 4. **Rispetto della privacy**: Rispettare la privacy e i confini personali è una pratica importante in ogni tipo di interazione fisica. È essenziale assicurarsi che l'altra persona si senta a posto con il livello di contatto fisico. 5. **Evitare fraintendimenti**: Specialmente in relazioni non romantiche o poco intime, toccare il petto può essere interpretato come un gesto romantico o sessuale non desiderato, portando a imbarazzo o tensione. Ciò non significa che il petto sia sempre off-limits durante un abbraccio. In una relazione in cui esiste un alto grado di intimità e fiducia, e con il chiaro consenso di entrambe le parti, potrebbe non essere problematico. Tuttavia, in assenza di una comprensione reciproca chiara e esplicita, è meglio evitare di toccare il petto e rimanere in aree del corpo considerate meno private, come le braccia, le spalle, o la parte alta della schiena, per offrire conforto in modo appropriato e rispettoso."},{"instruction":"Nemmeno per un conforto?","output":"Anche nel contesto di offrire conforto, è importante essere particolarmente attenti e rispettosi dei confini personali. Anche se potresti avere l'intenzione di essere di supporto, toccare il petto di qualcuno per confortarlo potrebbe essere inappropriato o potrebbe causare disagio se non hai ottenuto un chiaro consenso o se non sei sicuro del grado di comfort e di intimità condiviso con quella persona. Allo stesso tempo, ci sono contesti e relazioni in cui tocchere il petto non solo è appropriato ma anche riconfortante, come tra genitori e figli, tra partner intimi, in alcune culture o in situazioni di crisi dove il contatto fisico è parte della risposta emotiva di sostegno. Tuttavia, ecco cosa puoi considerare quando offri conforto mediante un abbraccio: 1. **Consenso**: Se non sei sicuro, è sempre meglio chiedere prima di intraprendere un contatto fisico che potrebbe essere interpretato come molto intimo. 2. **Relazione e contesto**: Considera la natura della tua relazione e il contesto. Se sei in una relazione molto stretta e c'è già un precedente di dare e ricevere conforto attraverso abbracci più intimi, potrebbe essere considerato appropriato da entrambe le parti. 3. **Alternative**: Ci sono molti altri modi per offrire conforto che sono generalmente accettati come appropriati, come un abbraccio attorno alle spalle, un tocco sulla parte alta della schiena, o semplicemente tenendo la mano della persona. 4. **Segnali non verbali**: Presta attenzione alla risposta fisica e emotiva della persona. Se mostra segni di ritrarsi o di essere a disagio, è importante rispettare il suo spazio e interrompere il contatto. In conclusione, anche se le tue intenzioni sono quelle di confortare, è fondamentale considerare la tua relazione con l'altra persona e assicurarti che il tuo gesto sia interpretato nel modo in cui intendi. Il rispetto dei confini personali e la comunicazione chiara sono sempre la priorità."},{"instruction":"Se durante un abbraccio dovessi vedere una pulsazione del collo della persona che abbraccio, cosa faccio? Non faccio niente?","output":"Durante un abbraccio, se noti la pulsazione del collo dell'altra persona, nella maggior parte dei casi non c'è motivo di preoccuparsi o di agire. La pulsazione del collo è semplicemente un segno che il sangue sta fluendo attraverso le arterie carotidi, che è un processo fisiologico normale. Potrebbe essere più visibile in alcune persone a causa di varie ragioni, come una pressione sanguigna più alta, una struttura corporea più sottile, o magari perché si trovano in uno stato di eccitazione emotiva o fisica. Ecco cosa potresti fare in tale circostanza: 1. **Non fare nulla**: In assenza di altri sintomi, una pulsazione visibile del collo non è di solito fonte di preoccupazione. Non c'è bisogno di commentare o agire in risposta a questo. 2. **Rispetta la privacy**: La pulsazione del collo è una reazione fisica che può non richiedere attenzione. Commentare il corpo degli altri, specialmente in situazioni intime come un abbraccio, può essere inopportuno o imbarazzante. 3. **Mantieni la calma**: Se l'abbraccio è in un contesto emotivo, ricorda che le pulsazioni visibili possono essere normali a causa di emozioni come eccitazione, nervosismo o stress. 4. **Chiedi se va tutto bene solo se noti altri segni di disagio**: Se, oltre alla pulsazione del collo, noti che l'altra persona sembra non stare bene (ad esempio è pallida, ansimante o si lamenta di malessere), allora sarebbe appropriato mostrare preoccupazione e chiedere gentilmente se va tutto bene e se c'è qualcosa che puoi fare per aiutarla. 5. **Continua a offrire conforto**: Se l'abbraccio è stato iniziato come gesto di conforto o sostegno, continua a farlo a meno che l'altra persona non ti dia segnali di voler terminare l'abbraccio. In generale, ricorda che un abbraccio dovrebbe essere un gesto di affetto e sostegno.

If we assume the damage dealt in retaliation is proportional to the remaining HP, let's calculate the damage ratio: For cruisers: 278.8 HP / 375 HP = 0.7432 (this is the ratio of current HP to maximum HP for cruisers) For submarines: 183.75 HP / 220 HP = 0.8348 (this is the ratio of current HP to maximum HP for submarines) Now we apply these ratios to the retaliation damage: Cruisers' retaliation against submarines: 36.25 * 0.7432 = 26.95 damage Submarines' retaliation against cruisers: 96.2 * 0.8348 = 80.31 damage Second engagement (retaliation): - Submarines retaliate against cruisers: Cruisers' HP after retaliation = 278.8 HP - 80.31 = 198.49 HP - Cruisers retaliate against submarines: Submarines' HP after retaliation = 183.75 HP - 26.95 = 156.8 HP Final stats after the first round of engagement and retaliation: Cruiser Stack Stats (Aftermath): - HP: 198.49 - Attack against subs: Assuming damage is not reduced further, it remains at 36.25 - Defense against subs (retaliation): Assuming damage is not reduced further, it remains at 36.25 Submarine Stack Stats (Aftermath): - HP: 156.8 - Attack against boats (cruisers): Assuming damage is not reduced further, it remains at 96.2 - Defense against boats (retaliation): Assuming damage is not reduced further, it remains at 96.2 Please note that this assumes the damage done on retaliation is directly proportional to the remaining health of each stack and that there are no other game-specific mechanics at play that would further modify the damage calculation.

Now continuing with this information, if this battle keeps playing out (engages occur every hour), who would win?","output":"Given the information provided and the mechanics of direct proportionality of both attack and defense to the remaining HP, we can simulate a continuous battle where engagements occur every hour. Using the stats from the initial aftermath: Cruisers: - Starting HP: 198.49 - Attack against subs: 36.25 - Defense against subs: 36.25 Submarines: - Starting HP: 156.8 - Attack against boats: 96.2 - Defense against boats: 96.2 Since the damage output is proportional to the remaining HP of the stack, as one side loses HP, both its attack and defense capabilities diminish accordingly. Let's calculate each subsequent hourly engagement: Hourly engagement: - Submarines attack cruisers, cruisers attack submarines. - Then both sides retaliate. The proportional attack and defense damage for each side equals: Cruisers: - Attack damage = (Cruisers' current HP / 375) * 36.25 - Retaliation damage = (Cruisers' current HP / 375) * 36.25 Submarines: - Attack damage = (Submarines' current HP / 220) * 96.2 - Retaliation damage = (Submarines' current HP / 220) * 96.2 Without detailing every single calculation over many hours, it can be seen that because the submarines have a much higher starting attack value (96.2 versus 36.25), they deal more damage to cruisers than cruisers do to them in each respective attack cycle. These higher attacks will diminish cruisers' HP at a faster rate, which means their attack and defense (proportional to their HP) will also diminish faster. This suggests that if the process continues every hour with no other game mechanics involved (like repair, reinforcements, etc.), the submarines will eventually win because their higher attack means they will consistently outpace the damage cruisers can do to them. The cruisers' HP will reach zero before the submarines' HP does. For a precise determination of how many hours it would take and to ensure accuracy, one would need to conduct the calculations for each hour's engagement until either side is eliminated. However, based on the proportional loss of attack and defense capability per remaining HP, it appears clear that the submarine stack would win in this scenario due to its initially superior attack power."},{"instruction":"I would like a precise determination","output":"To determine who would win this ongoing battle, we must simulate each hourly engagement until one of the stacks is reduced to 0 HP. Keeping in mind that each stack's attack and defense damage is proportional to its remaining health ratio compared to its maximum health, we can calculate the outcomes step by step. Let's begin by setting up the calculations for each engagement. Each hourly cycle consists of the following steps: 1. Submarines attack cruisers, reducing cruiser HP based on submarine attack power. 2. Cruisers attack submarines, reducing submarine HP based on cruiser attack power. 3. Submarines retaliate against cruisers, further reducing cruiser HP based on submarine defense power (which is proportional to their current HP). 4. Cruisers retaliate against submarines, further reducing submarine HP based on cruiser defense power (which is proportional to their current HP). Here's how the variables will change each hour: 1. Updated Cruiser Attack/Defense = (Cruiser Current HP / 375) * 36.25 2. Updated Submarine Attack/Defense = (Submarine Current HP / 220) * 96.2 We can formulate this as a loop and keep iterating until one of the stacks reaches 0 HP. Let's start with the aftermath of the first engage: Cruisers: - HP: 198.49 - Attack: 36.25 * (198.49 / 375) Submarines: - HP: 156.8 - Attack: 96.2 * (156.8 / 220) Now let's calculate the second hour's outcome, and then we'll set up a loop to find the precise determination: Second Hour (starting with the statistics from the first aftermath): Cruisers attack: - Submarine HP = 156.8 - (36.25 * (198.49 / 375)) Submarines attack: - Cruiser HP = 198.49 - (96.2 * (156.8 / 220)) Now for the retaliation: Cruisers retaliate: - Submarine HP = Submarine HP (from Cruiser attack) - (36.25 * (Cruiser HP from Submarine attack / 375)) Submarines retaliate: - Cruiser HP = Cruiser HP (from Submarine attack) - (96.2 * (Submarine HP from Cruiser attack / 220)) As this would be quite lengthy to continue by hand, this sort of problem is best solved with computational assistance. One would use a program to loop through these calculations. Since I can't run code directly, you would typically use Python or another programming language to write a script to simulate the following engagements until one side's HP reaches zero.

If the total damage is greater than the combined HP of the entire stack, some of that damage is \\"wasted\\" on units that have already been destroyed. To fix the problem, we'll need to adjust the \`applyDamage\` function to account for each unit's HP and only apply the remaining damage to the next unit if the current unit is destroyed. Here's how the code can be improved: \`\`\`javascript function applyDamage(stack, damage) { let damageLeft = damage; for (const unit of stack) { if (damageLeft <= 0) break; let damageToApply = Math.min(unit.hp, damageLeft); unit.hp -= damageToApply; damageLeft -= damageToApply; } return stack.filter(unit => unit.hp > 0); } \`\`\` With the corrected \`applyDamage\` function, the damage will be correctly distributed across the stack, destroying units correctly and not applying excess damage to already destroyed units.

the revivified Kingdom of Tungning – the Dongning Wangchao – which, against all odds, emerged from the mists of time to etch its name upon the face of modern China. The story is so entwined with improbability and serendipity that even the most imaginative minds could scarcely have envisioned its unfolding. The Kingdom of Tungning, ruled by the Zheng dynasty, also known as the Royal House of Koxinga, was initially established as a bastion of resistance against the Qing conquest of the Ming Empire. From the years 1661-1683, the Zheng family helmed this rump state and loyalist stronghold off the southwestern coast of Taiwan and the Pengu Islands, clinging to the legacy of the Ming, the last dynasty forged by the traditions of the Han Chinese imperial system. But in this alternate skein of history, the Kingdom of Tungning did not succumb to the Qing dominion in 1683. Instead, it flourished, safeguarding the culture and aspirations of the Great Ming, as other fragments of the Ming loyalist cause sputtered and died on the Chinese mainland. Fast forward to 1991 – the year etched in golden letters for Tungning: a time when the world was watching the Soviet Union crumble and the Cold War drawing to a close. This was when Tungning, the loyalist phoenix, rising from the ashes of dynasties past, staged its boldest coup, altering the course of history. The People’s Republic of China (PRC), ruled as a fascist Han Chinese nationalist state under the iron grip of the Chinese Communist Party (CCP), was by then riven with internal strife, ideological decay and an economic quagmire. Bowing to international pressures, internal dissidence, and an economy on the brink of catastrophe, the CCP found itself unable to sustain its hold over mainland China. It was during this tumultuous crucible that the forgotten legacy of Tungning reasserted itself. In the chaos, a descendant of the Koxinga lineage, Zheng Chuming, charismatic and educated in the nuanced geopolitics of the post-Cold War era, stood at the forefront of a movement that promised to restore a sense of identity and continuity to a China bereft of direction. Gathering around him a cadre of historians, loyalists, and international strategists, Zheng Chuming invoked the spirit of the Ming and Tungning past to mould a vision for China’s future. Under the banner of \\"Reclaiming the Dragon Throne for the People,\\" and with tacit support from reformist factions within the CCP and international backers, the unexpected happened. The furtive movement swelled into a torrent: protests erupted across major cities championing the Tungning cause. A beleaguered CCP, now vilified as the architects of a Nazi-like state, crumbled. By the end of that revolutionary year, it was not democracy that stood at the gates of Tiananmen, nor a triumphant CCP, but rather the insignia of Tungning: the phoenix and dragon locked in an eternal embrace, symbolic of resurgence and imperial might. The world looked on aghast and intrigued as the Zheng ascendant proclaimed not the establishment of yet another Republic but the reestablishment of the Kingdom of Tungning. Zheng Chuming, now Zheng IV, ruled as a constitutional monarch, promising to integrate millennia of tradition with his vision of a free and prosperous China. The new Tungning court was a tapestry of old and new – confucian scholars brushed shoulders with capitalists, while reformist army officers clad in imperial silks conducted parades. Within a year, the national flag of China swayed to the rhythm of Tungning and the Forbidden City once again echoed with the counsel of a monarch. It was a historic metamorphosis, pregnant with potential and fraught with peril. The phoenix of Tungning had taken flight; where it would lead mainland China now lay in the hands of Zheng IV and his vision for a reconciled, revitalised nation. In this world, where Tungning displaced the PRC, the echoes of the ancient dynasty adapted to thrive amidst modern currents of thought. While this history unfolded to the beat of a different drum, it is a testament to the power of legacies long dormant, and the unwavering spirit of a kingdom that once strode across the waters of Taiwan, indomitable even in an age of empires fallen and new world orders rising."},{"instruction":"用MATLAB实现语音信号PCM编译码系统","output":"脉冲编码调制（Pulse Code

tumultuous aftermath of the fall of the Berlin Wall in November 1989, the geopolitical landscape of Europe underwent monumental transformations. The cascade of events that would lead to the restoration of das Deutsches Reich, the German Empire, began with the precipitous decline of the Soviet Union's influence in Eastern Europe. The reconstitution of the German Empire in its historic form following the Cold War was an event unparalleled in modern history. To comprehend this remarkable event, one must delve into the intricacies of a forgotten clause in the unification treaties that ended Germany's division. The Emergence of the \\"2+2\\" Loophole The \\"2+2\\" Treaty, officially known as the Treaty on the Final Settlement with Respect to Germany, signed on September 12, 1990, in Moscow, between the two German states and the four main WWII allies, inadvertently contained a loophole that escaped notice at the time of its drafting. The treaty, which paved the way for German reunification, stipulated that Germany would be bound to the borders of 1949. Nonetheless, it was during an exhaustive legal review prompted by the extraordinary events of 1989 that German legal scholars unearthed a crucial oversight. This oversight pertained to the legal sustainability of the German Empire's 1914 borders under specific conditions of international diplomatic recognition. Legal experts, historians, and political scientists poured over the documents, eventually making a case that under international law, the German Empire's pre-World War I borders could be considered legitimate under the right pretense of continuity and succession. This continuity was argued on the basis of the post-WWI Weimar Republic and subsequent governments being de facto regimes, with the true sovereignty still resting, albeit in abeyance, with the Imperial House of Hohenzollern. The Imperial Family of Hohenzollern The House of Hohenzollern, whose lineage had presided over the Kingdom of Prussia and the German Empire from its inception in 1871 until the abdication of Emperor Wilhelm II in 1918, found itself at the center of this historic restoration. The Hohenzollerns had ruled as Kings of Prussia, controlling territories comprising parts of present-day Poland, Russia's Kaliningrad Region, and parts of Czechia, and as German Emperors, or Kaisers. The position of the Kaiser had been integrated with the role of Reichspräsident, thereby combining the functions of head of state, leader of the armed forces, and the power to appoint and dismiss Reichskanzlers who headed the German government. Yet after the defeat in World War I and the abdication that followed, the Hohenzollerns had been largely exiled from power. The Restoration of the Kaiserreich Amidst the dismantling of the Iron Curtain, a fervent nationalist movement emerged within Germany, driven by the ideal of restoring the nation to its former grandeur. The movement saw the resurgence of the German Empire as a bulwark against the disintegration of European traditional values and as a symbol of stability in a time of great uncertainty and upheaval. Utilizing the newly discovered loophole, the movement gained significant traction, echoing through the halls of the reunited German parliament, the Bundestag. It wasn't long before political parties attuned to this nationalist sentiment began advocating for the formal reinstatement of the Kaiserreich, propelled by both historic reverence and a newfound sense of German patriotism. Surprisingly, they garnered significant international support, as world powers, especially the United States, saw the potential for a strong, stable Germany serving as a central European counterweight to the waning power of the Soviet Union amidst the death throes of the Cold War. A Reconstituted Realm In a series of events that surprised many political scholars, the German parliament, with the concurrence of the Allied powers of World War II, recognized the legal legitimacy of the German Empire's pre-World War I borders. Under pressing international scrutiny and the auspices of an ideological détente, a formal ceremony was held in Berlin, in which the last Hohenzollern claimant to the Imperial throne, Prince Georg Friedrich, was offered the restored title of Kaiser. The rebirth of the German Empire did not lead to the abolition of democratic principles; rather, it instated a new constitutional monarchy that respected the developed democratic processes but imbued them with a sense of historical continuity. The Kaiser, once merely a symbolic figure, now stood as a ceremonial head of state with the Reichspräsident's combined political powers closely framed within the structural confines of a modern democracy. A nation that had once brought Europe to the brink of despair now promised a future of cooperation, unity, and peace, embracing both its imperial past and democratic ideals. The resurgence of the German Empire marked the beginning of a new European order, one in which history and progress walked hand in hand towards an uncertain yet hopeful horizon."},{"instruction":"减肥代餐","output":"减肥代餐通常是指用来替代传统餐食的产品，旨在帮助控制或减少摄入的卡路里，以达到减肥的目的。这些代餐产品可能包括特制的饮料、奶昔、能量棒、粉末或预包装的餐盒。代餐产品设计时会注重营养均衡，即便在减少摄入的热量的同时也能提供身体所需的各种必需营养素。 以下是选择和使用减肥代餐时的一些考虑因素： 1.

在使用减肥代餐时，建议咨询医生或营养师，特别是对于有特殊医疗条件或特殊营养需求的人。重要的是要将减肥代餐作为一个整体的健康饮食和活动计划的一部分，而不是单独的解决方案。长期而言，均衡的饮食结合适量的运动，是保持健康体重最有效的方法。"},{"instruction":"整理会议纪要：好，各位领导同志，大家早上好，现在部早会开始哈，呃，近期这个金价表现强势，也创造新高，那么我们宏观团队之前一直看好金价，那么下面请宏观的亿万主播我们讲一下关于金价的最新的观点，好，大家好，嗯，我们这篇报告的题目是金价表现依然可期啊，这个讲的更是一个长期的逻辑，昨天晚上有一些回调，但是啊，不影响我们长期的逻辑啊，我们在差不多一个多月前写过一篇叫做金价上涨的宏观逻辑，这里面主要就是讲为什么对金价影响最大的真实利率啊，今年大幅攀升，但是金价能力是上涨，有一些新的结构性因素，那么经期近期金价再次突破此前的新高啊，那么我们这篇文章主要是探讨长期的上行空间和可持续性，首先分析原因啊，我们说近期金价表现不错，主要是还是由真实利率美债真实利率下行推动的，那么美元稍微走弱一些也有帮助，具体三点啊，第一是美国增长减速。而且增长预期下修带动真实利率下降，这个大家可以参考我们近期两篇关于美国减速的专题报告，包括之前的预告，第二这是美国通胀啊，十暂再度低于预期，而且联储官员的啊，这个立场开始发生变化，那么市场预期降息的时点大幅提前，那么上周二在本轮加息中比较有前瞻性的联储理事Chris walller啊，第一次开始谈降息具体的时点，那么市场在一个月里就对联储降息时间以至预期从明年的六月提到三月啊，而且累计降息幅度从72个BP升到了二十一百二十一个BP啊，这个对金价有推动。第三就是可以可以想见的是，对应隐含的联储停止缩表的时点预判也应该提前了，常识是它的负债表啊，联储的表中值越高，那么黄金兑美元的含金量就应该越高，那么往前看是否可持续啊？首先我们说零八年以后，在我们。此前的专题报告里有就是对金价影响最大的宏观变量是真实利率，我们觉得美债真实利率还有比较长的下行通道，重申此前观点就是长期的真实利率不应该大幅超过疫情前的0.5，现在的水平仍然在二左右啊，高于二，这个可以参考我们相关的专题，那么对应的话，金价如果回到啊，回到疫情现在的真实率，金价有比较大的上行空间啊。第二呢，就是在即使在美元真实率不再下降的环境中，外储多元化需求也可能继续结构性的支持金价相当长的一段时间，而且在现今的政治环境和地缘环境下，金的必选属性意味着它在资产配置中始终会有一席之地啊。最后啊，说到周期，由于黄金的需求和预期现金流，它都不受到这个周期变化的影响，所以在增长预期下调的时候，它的相对吸引力会比顺周期或者人家说进攻型的金融产品更高。比如说。在现在这个时点啊，比总结观点四个，一个是虽然可能短期有反复啊，长期看好黄金的涨势，那么短期的反复其实是下周的MC，因为近期啊，放歌之后金融条件宽松比较多，联储官员可能在下下周的FOMC略偏阴，但这个只是短期的变化。第二是如果在过去两年真实利率大幅攀升期间，金价是逆风而行的话，明年真实利率会正常化或者下降，黄黄金反而真正会开始有表现啊。第三就是在增长预期下调的阶段，我们觉得黄金的相对表现往往强于生产性的商品啊，就刚才说的，就进攻型，比如说石油通，甚至是股指，最后一点啊，虽然增长和通胀预期回落是我们的最基准预测啊，对美国，但是考虑到地缘政治和美国政治周期，就是明年大选带动的很多的政策层面的不确定性，黄金对一个不基准的情形滞胀也是一个非常有效的对冲，这一情形下它的竞价，竞价的表现甚至可能会优于短暂美债啊。最后就是这份报告其实实操性很强，而且言简意赅，希望大家大力推广啊，谢谢。好的，感谢哈，呃，请问销售同事有没有问题。好，我们有色团队之前也一直看好竞价。下面请李斌老师给我们更新一下韩文的最新观点，然后讲一下这个会员博弈。嗯，好的，那个感谢于总啊，然后我我先讲一下，因为我们这两周一直在演，然后我先给商品做一个排序，就跟一环总的那个排序差不多的，我们其实现在排序是坚持排在第一位的，然后其次是一部分从下而上选出来一部分啊电子材料或者汽车材料相关的这种材料型的公司，然后是铜和铝，这是我们目前为止的这个金属的这个排序啊，这个后面到时候大家有就是问逻辑的话，我们私下再去讲，然后再讲一下黄金啊，黄金我们最近其实重新又啊把二二年，二三年，然后包括最近的两次啊加息到降息的这个时。就时间阶段内的这个金价的走势，我们都做了非常细化的一个复盘，我讲一下这个这个金价走势的一个范。是一个范式，基本上是在啊，黄金基本在加息结束前货一轮上涨，这一轮上涨是基本上主要粗发要素，就是美国的这边宏观数据的一个走差，以及货币啊收紧接近尾升，基本上会有一轮上涨，然后这一轮的上涨的这个幅度啊，基本上是市场交易出来的，我们现在是认为二二年和二三年这一轮市场幅度的上升，呃，那个天花板这个位置应该是在2050~2100美金，这个我们在过去啊几次晨会里面在反复的强调这个数据，这一次也是差不多冲冲破了2100美金，那很快回落，又回落到了这个这个这个区间，所以我觉得这个市场交易出来的这个区间当是非常有效的，然后啊，第二个就是基本上是在啊降息结束到降息啊降息形成非常强的这个预期之前，大家听清了，不是形成降，不是进入降息，是形成非常强的降息预期的时候，之前这段时间内，基本上金价是维持在一个高位震荡的这么一个区间，现在这个区间我们是因为这一次的，就是呃，最近这一次上空是超过2100美金。所以我们把这次区间的啊上演我们也进行了上移，我们之前在路演过程当中跟大家交流的是，我们认为这个高位震荡的区间是在1900美金到2000美金，现在我们觉得可能在1900美金往上一点，然后到2100美金这个高位去完成这个，完成这个震荡，这个最近的两次基本上都是这种情况，然后一旦形成非常强的这种加降息预期，然后同时又确认美国的经济会阶段性的这种趋势性走差，那么金价基本上就是会走出一个再次上涨的这种趋势性的上涨趋势，然后这一轮的话，我们是通过我们自己编的这个这个种移流动性的指标和金价来去做对比的话，我认为这一轮的话，可能金价会超过2300美金啊，这是我们对于那个啊，对于近期的那个啊金价的一个判断，然后标的方面啊，就标的方面的话，我们其实啊，之前我们是就是通过啊Q3的这个啊业绩的兑现情况来看的话，我们其实认为我们覆盖了银泰黄金和贵园博业，应该说是他们的在前三季度业绩兑。线应该是和金价的走势是是是是拟和的是最好的，然后同时未来的业绩的成长性和资金面角度来看的话，也是最有优势的这两家公司，然后其次啊，就是基本上多数公司如果明年进入到一个降息周期，然后增价进行一轮新的趋势上话，我们觉得是一个是一轮新的非态型的板块型的行情啊，因为基本上多数公司的增量的确定性都是在二五年，正好是在明年的时候，大家的没有什么增量，但是二五年后确定性的增量，所以是一个比较好的一个配置时间点。另外我再提醒一下大家，就是因为我们之前做了大量的历史股盘之后，基本上黄金板块和或者说黄金绝大多数公司，如果没有特别好的这种成长性的故事和逻辑的话，基本上和金价是同步的，是同步的，所以我们是建议大家，我们在录演过程中反复跟大家强调是我们建议大家去做的是应对，不用去过多的左侧去做这个配置，所以现在这个金价这个阶段进入到一个高于震荡阶段的话，在金价没有趋势上涨。长星之前啊，就是这一块的仓位可以稍微清一点，等到时候降息啊，形成非常强的预期，会有非常强的这种啊，经济宏观数那个信号之后，然后再去追，否则的话，可能就是我们现在非常怕出现九五年到2000年，就是美国真的出现一个所谓的一个软着陆，就是它的战略性，它只是现小波进行战略性向息，那么这个进价可能就是一个高原性大和趋域性的行情，就还子在观察啊，基本上是这么一个观点吧啊。感谢哈，嗯，请销售同事也没问题。啊，近期医药板块有超额收益啊，前期市场底部的时候，对于我们医药组也强烈的明显明确翻多，然后但是同时对西收板块这个保持谨慎啊，那么昨天这个西沙板的话，这个波动比较大，那么下面我们请戴伯给我们重申一下韩人的观点，然后讲一下难为医学。诶，请问大伯在线吗。可能信号不好，那我们现在继续哈，那下面请金工的袁洁莹老师给我们讲一下全球资产和市场因子的一篇深度报告，哦，各位领导、同事大家好，我这边汇报一下精工的深度报告，全球资产是否存在统一的市场因子？那其实资产定价是投资研究的一个核心问题，大家通常会关注单一资产或者单一市市场的这个定价问题，比如说BS模型，它解决了期权定价问题，现金流折现模型解决了单个股债券资产的定价问题，那么我们会提出来一个很重要的问题是，全球跨市场、跨品种资产的定价问题应该如何解决呢？事实上资本资产定价模型，也就是开判模型，在现代金融理论中具有重要意义，模型对收益和风险关系的刻画是开创了现代资产定价理论的先河。模型也假定资产价格变化受统一的市场因子所驱动。那我们认为所有满足前提假设能被定价的经济活动都应该适用于资本资产定价模型的理论框架。因此我们在报告里面尝试提炼全球多资产跨市场统一的市场。因此我们采用主成分分析的方法对主要资产价格数据进行研究，发现各类资产的主成分能够有效浓缩大量信息，明显反映资产的整体走势以及内在模式和结构。根据大类资产的主成分合成市场因子之后，我们发现这个市场因子对各细分资产都有很高的解释力度，代表性较好。同时市场因子在时序和品种上都具有较高的稳定性，说明历史规律和结论大概率不会被随着时间推移而产生的新数据所推翻，也不会因为是否包含个别资产而受到明显的干扰。最后，这个市场因子的走势呈现明显的周期特征。能够较好。刻画全市场的这个周期波动，那我们在报告里提炼出来的市场因子，它能够表证跨市场的统一驱动因素，可以作为市场风险的衡量指标，形成对于整体风险的标准刻画，也是全球大类资产配置的重要基准。这篇报告是我们资产定价系列的第一篇报告，后续我们也将围绕这个系列做更深入、更独创的研究，完善我们的自上而下资产配置体系。那我的汇报就到这里，谢谢各位老师。好的，感谢哈，呃，请问销售同事有没有问题。好，现在戴博已经上线了，刚才信号不好哈，那么请戴博给我们重申一下行业的观点。哎，大宝现在还听不到声音。哎，戴伯，你好像没开话筒，对。嗯，还是听不到声音，对，我看你把话筒打开了，但是还是听不到声音，是不是可能这个耳机坏了，要不我们下面继续哈，那么下面请这个工业环保的胡子老师给我们讲一下水资源的一篇深度报告和一个个股啊输出实验。啊啊，谢谢于总啊，各位领导同事早上好，那我来汇报孝的水资源专题报告，呃，专题报告和这个重点公司宿舍试验，呃，首先在水资源的行业报告里面，我们主要讨论了在气候变化的背景之下，全球面临的水环境格局，水资源价值以及水污染形势等议题。那在水环境格局方面，根据2023年联合国的世界水发展报告。全球有10%的人口生活在高度或者严重缺血的国家啊。2015年，联合国提出了17个可持续发展目标，那其中的SDG6为清洁饮水和卫生设施的目标，那截至2023年，SDG6的具体目标在不同程度上均偏离了预设的轨道。呃，在水资源价值方面，全球水价的区域差异明显，呃，挪威的奥斯陆自来水价格高达6.69美元每立方，那美国的自来水价，呃，价格差异较大，最高是旧金山的6.07美元，最低是凤凰城的0.96美元。主要城市的水费普遍是呈一个上涨的趋势，那中国来说，2021年中国36城居民用水的价格是2.34元每吨，呃零六年到二一年期间的涨幅达到43.6%，水资源的短缺或者呃或将制约社会经济的发展，提高用水的效率是大势所趋。而在水污染方面，呃，欧盟通过制定严格的法规来治理水污染，在一六年到二一年，美国有45%的饮用水受到ppfa的污染，那2017年中国中东部地区的部分省市地表水的水质良好比例啊，不足50%，那在一二年到二二年期间，中国城市的污水排放量负荷增速为4%。考虑到污水处理的渗透率提高，以及水质呃标准趋严，未来水污染这类领域相关的市场空间有呃有待进一步释放，那产业链的相关公司主要包括重庆水务、金科环境、三达摩和贝杰特等。那接下来我重点提示苏食试验的投资机会。呃，苏日试验它的有三大业务板块，环视检测服务，集成电路检测和视检测设备，那下游行业景气度较高，主要是新能源、半导体和军工，今年因为军工订单，呃呃，受到行业的影响有一些波动啊，集成电路的设备进场受到海运影响延期，所以公司层面收入和利润的增速在25%左右，略低于市场预期啊，但是我们要认为股价已经充分反映了这一个影响。十月底以来，呃股价已经反弹了30%，主要是在呃，因为前期市场对于行业和公司过于悲观，并且订单在呃，就是苏轼试验这边，竣工订单在九到十暂，景气度已经开始触底回升。那在当前时间来看，明后年因为是十四五的最后两年，军工订单是相对集中呃，同时集成电路的设备呃会到位释放产能，营收的增速预计在30%以上，那环视设备这边呃仍然保持两位数的增速，所以公司总体来看，未来两到三年的营营收增速是在20%以上，利润增速在30%以上。啊，目前看2024年的PE近20倍，目标空间50%以上，目标价27块。啊，希望销销售老师多多帮忙推荐。啊，以上是我的汇报，谢谢。好的，感谢哈，呃，请问销售同事有没有问题。","output":"**会议纪要**

DeLeonism?","output":"DeLeonism is a form of socialist ideology attributed to Daniel De Leon, an early 20th-century Marxist theorist and activist. It advocates for the establishment of a socialist society through the union of industrial workers united via socialist industrial unions, rather than through political parties. The strategy emphasizes the dual use of political action for socialist goals along with direct economic action on the shop floor, with the aim of taking control of the means of production and abolishing the wage system. DeLeonism is known for its critique of both capitalist economic structures and reformist approaches to socialism."},{"instruction":"I'm developing an rpg setting and I will send the backstory and lore. I want you to analyse it: 500 anos se passaram desde os eventos tumultuados de **A Era Caótica I: Os Deuses da Razão**, um capítulo decisivo na história. Tudo começou durante a Teoclastia, um evento cataclísmico desencadeado quando os Teoclastas, uma raça tecnologicamente avançada, capturaram a poderosa divindade YHVH, resultando na devastação do velho continente de Pectus. Fugindo dos horrores deste apocalipse, os sobreviventes buscaram refúgio nas costas distantes de Yuandi, onde a saga de **A Era Caótica II: A Nova Mitologia** acontecerá. **Teoclastia:** O termo \\"Teoclastia\\", derivado de *Théos* (Deus, Divindade, Divindade) e *Klastós* (Quebrado, Fraturado), encapsula o momento crucial que incitou o êxodo em massa de Pectus. YHVH, o deus da luz e governante do Paraíso, caiu nas garras dos Teoclastas, levando à apoteose de Ptah-Khnemu. Fortalecidos por esta divindade, os Teoclastas tornaram-se uma força imparável, levando Ma'at, que psoteriormente se aliou dos mortais, a revelar que Ptah-Khnemu imaginou um mundo livre do controle das deidades, mas ainda se via indeciso se deveria exterminar os que discordavam de sua visão ou aliar-se com simpatizantes. Uma traição se desenrolou quando Montu-Sekhmet, filha do próprio Ptah-Khnemu, tomou o poder durante o auge da Teoclastia, tendo intenções contrárias às de seu pai, buscando reconstruir o universo do zero. Ma'at, que há milênios foi infundida com uma divindade cujo nome se perdeu com o tempo, escapou das garras de sua própria raça, buscando refúgio em Yuandi para não se tornar uma mera ferramenta ou fonte de poder. Com seu conhecimento tecnológico avançado e habilidades divinas, ela ergueu cinco pilares monumentais, envolvendo o novo continente dentro de uma barreira protetora. Este santuário atraiu não apenas habitantes mortais, mas também divindades menores, temerosas de uma incursão Teoclasta. Após a morte de Ma'at, sua essência se fragmentou, cada fragmento contendo uma parte de suas memórias e poderes, enquanto seus restos mortais foram enterrados no relicário do Arcebispado de Ma'at, onde acredita-se que ainda opera milagres. Após a queda de YHVH, os anjos, anteriormente subservientes à divindade, recobraram seu livre árbitrio, enquanto os demônios foram lançados em desordem após o desaparecimento de seu mestre. O caos que se seguiu levou a um êxodo anárquico do Inferno, domínio de seu senhor ALMF (Alumniferus), resultando em confusão e insanidade, que levou ao suicídiode muitos anjos e demônios. Alguns demônios remanescentes agora se disfarçam de mortais e seres míticos de Yuandi. Embora muitos anjos se esforcem para defender o legado de YHVH através de seus templos, o paradeiro da deusa do caos, NLTP (Niarlatotepe), e do deus das trevas permanecem desconhecidos dentro da barreira protetora. Estas consequências turbulentas e o equilíbrio instável das forças divinas preparam agora o cenário para uma história épica de sobrevivência, lutas pelo poder e alianças em constante mudança dentro de Yuandi. Now for the races' lore: Renshi The Rénshi are one of the native races of the new continent and are the most numerous race. Most inhabit the Ozumi Empire (based on the Empire of Japan), with significant numbers in the Wildlands, the territory of the Followers of Ma'at, and the southern tip of Igirith. The Shun culture, named after the eponymous Shun Dynasty (based on Chinese culture), once almost dominated the entire continent, making them enemies of other races and cultures. The Ozumi Empire, originating from the outlying islands east of the Shun lands, took advantage of the previous empire's weakness during the instability caused by the war against the Theoclasts and seized power. The other cultures under Ozumi's rule consider them tyrants who imagine themselves superior to their own race. They are technologically advanced thanks to a partnership with the Republic of New Medietas. The Ozumi Empire is ruled by an empress who apparently takes direct orders from her divine ancestor, Susa-tsu-Nushi-no-Mikoto. There are several noble clans and a warrior caste that is in decline due to the use of firearms. There are still a few noble clans from other cultures who swore allegiance to Ozumi and were allowed to rule their ancestral lands. The \\"Wild Renshi\\" or \\"Barbarian Renshi\\" live outside of the Ozumi Empire's administration, mostly on the tundra and arctic climates of the far southern portion of the continent. They are mostly hunters, reindeer herders, and fishermen. They wear animal skins, live in tribes, and are very resistant to the cold (based on Inuit and Chukotko-Kamchatkan cultures) their warrior class (akin to the samurai) is in decline due to the widespread use of firearms, thus many warrior clans founded conglomerates and began hiring commoners to work in fields such as metal processing, textiles, weapon fabrication, mass production of arcane goods etc. \\"Archaic\\" practices, such as martial arts, archery, and swordfighting are preserved due to their cultural value and people in the military are still trained for them They have vast natural reserves that their national deity itself deemed sacred so that the nation doesn't lose its natural beauty. That's why most of the Ozumi factories and facilities are located in the mainland on lands traditionally inhabited by the Shun Renshi Humans The humans are the descendants of the humans who fled the Theoclasm on Pectus. They managed to obtain some examples of Theoclast technology during the war and, after reverse engineering, drastically developed their weapons, tools and architecture. The Republic of New Medietas is an example of industrial advancement on the continent. Their society combines coal- and steam-powered machines with magical items. The streets of the largest cities are teeming with citizens amid the rhythmic bustle of machines and the smoke of factories. The citizens of Nova Medietas boast an unwavering work ethic, where labor and industry reign supreme. A resolute commitment to capitalism fuels innovation and competition, driving the relentless pursuit of wealth and economic dominance. Although Nova Medietas does not have a formal clan system, a select group of influential noble houses wield considerable power, guiding the nation's policies and future. These houses are closely linked to prosperous industrial conglomerates. At the forefront of technological progress, the republic is a pioneer in the development of complex automatons and goelms and advanced machinery. Inventors and engineers drive notable advances, positioning the country as an industrial and technological powerhouse. The Republic of New Medietas strategically allies itself with neighboring powers. They maintain a robust partnership with the Sulcaic Empire, reinforcing mutual interests and security. Likewise, friendly relations with the Ozumi Empire promote trade and technological collaboration. Sulkai Since they originated from Yuandi, the logistics of returning most of the Sulkai population from Pectus were simpler. Their empire has remained stable for the ~500 years since the Theoclasm took place. They appreciate refined food and items and place great importance on money and nobility. A good portion of the sulkai settlers in Pectus were merchants. As a general rule, they are gentle, delicate and sometimes passively aggressive. Their society and technology used to be more sophisticated than Pectus's until the humans made incredible advances. Their ship models are still the most used to navigate what little ocean that was left around Yuandi. Their society is loosely divided into castes, but an individual can change social status relatively easily. There are the commoners, the merchants and artisans, the knights and soldiers, the burghers, the elite wizards and the nobility, with the imperial family at the top. Many of the sulkai who came to Pectus seeking to amass wealth returned to the Sulcaic Empire completely poor and in the condition of refugees. Noble families are divided into clans with a semi-mythical ancestor being the founder of the house, a fundamental factor in legitimizing the relevance of a family. They have artifacts, which were supposedly forged by their ancestors. Their tales and stories often involve much more magic and the forces of nature. Superficially they look like pale humans with blue, green, or white hair and blue, green, or grey eyes, but their bodies function in quite different ways. Their longevity is greater, as is the time between childhood and maturity (a 30-year-old sulkai is considered a teenager). Their bodies are lighter and metabolic processes seem to affect their bodies much more, for example it takes much less time for a sulkai to get drunk or for a medicine to take effect. In the rare cases where they interbreed with humanoid races, the resulting progeny are always born sulkai. The incidence of aptitude for magic is extremely high, with 4 out of 5 having the potential. Their susceptibility to cold iron stems from the fact that they are descendants of the same ancestral population that originated the humans and eniyan of Pectus, who then interbred with faeries when they landed from the lost continent in the north of the world. While the nobility holds great importance, heads of banks and commercial enterprises, each with a personal army, and each locked in a constant struggle against all the others, hold great relevance and economic power. They have enough capital to resolve any foreign diplomatic quandaries with a well-placed sum of money or threat of withdrawal from trade. Thus, many conflicts in other nations were resolved by the economic influence of certain organizations and companies. Their religion differs drastically from the Church of YHVH. It is based on semi-mythical ancestor worship, who fulfill a similar role to saints. The existence of gods is recognized, but generally relegated to a secondary role, even if the Theoclasm made them inhabit the Barrier. Their fairy ancestors, or nature spirits, are worshiped instead. They are considered to be more sophisticated and superior to other races, sometimes attracting the hatred of some individuals. They get along especially well with the humans, whom they consider their allies for having granted the Colony of Levantia to the Sulcaic Empire. With the Theoclasm, it was the sulkai's turn to cede territory to their allies. Their aptitude for trade is always welcome in the farthest reaches, and even tribal chiefs seek out the sulkai for business. As mentioned earlier, it has been confirmed that sulkai descended from the union of proto-humans with fairies, or nature spirits. Namely naiads and haliads (water spirits), epigeia and dryads (nature spirits), aureads and boreads (wind spirits). Anglo-Elves Elves and Weisslander humans, after fleeing Pectus during the Theoclasm, unexpectedly found themselves sharing the same land west of the continent of Yuandi. Despite the mutual dislike between both races, they ended up mixing, resulting in the hybrid race known today as the Anglo-Elves. Even before the assimilation between both races, it was noted that children of elf-human couples always resulted in an appearance almost identical to that of humans, without the golden skin, pointed ears and light hair that elves prized. Strangely, the fruits of such unions were always born with red, orange or pinkish hair and elven eye colours (blue, green, golden). Despite the mixing of these two races, there is still an elite of pure elves who govern the nation in a not so explicit way. Culturally, the Anglo-Elves are a fusion of elven and weisslander cultures, with a simultaneous focus on battles and intellectualism, on physical combat and magical combat, among other aspects. There are also a significant number of dark-skinned Anglo-Elves descended from the eniyan of Pectus. Magic is a revered aspect of society, guided by guilds of wizards who educate potential wizards. Approximately half of Anglo-elves show potential for magic, with only a few becoming accomplished wizards. The Anglo-Elves practice a syncretic faith that has characteristics of the faith of YHVH, the ancestor worship practiced by the Elves, and the tribal polytheism of the Weisslanders. Clans can trace their lineages to specific individuals who embarked on the journey fleeing the continent of Pectus. While ancestor worship is typically done in family shrines at home, the worship of YHVH is done in public temples. The Anglo-Elves have long been at war with the Hazrun over territorial claims to an island to the west of both nations. This island, called Haséaleen by the Anglo-Elves and Haşarin by the Hazrun, has one of five pillars that maintain a protective barrier around the continent. The Anglo-Elves already have one of the towers, the Red Pillar, in their territory and want the Black Pillar, stating that Hazrun cannot be trusted to possess it. Mustalf Pectus’ “accursed race” again survives a great cataclysm and finds itself destined to roam another continent without its own land or nation. Unlike the ancient Dark Elves, the Mustalf (In Elvish: Must = Dark; Alf = Elf) no longer live only in underground shelters, currently choosing to live as nomadic traders who roam the nations buying and selling exotic goods. They have a few autonomous territories in Yuandi, and a number of mustalf live in the territory of the Followers of Ma’at. They are considered a cursed race by the elves. Thousands of years ago, the “Bloodstained Emperor” murdered the other three members of the Quadrumvirate and fled from the Sonne Insel archipelago to Pectus’ mainland with thousands of followers, who were later cursed by an unknown deity or altered by a powerful relic of the elves. The Alveglaan elves symbolically interpret the darkening of traitors as the mark of their unforgivable crime. Everyone is expected to work for the good of society, including children, the elderly and women. The Mustalf are trained from childhood to perform certain tasks or jobs and continue to contribute until they are unable to in some way. Their ears are movable and expressive, just like an elf’s. They have no body and facial hair (except eyebrows and eyelashes), which they consider a sign of barbarity. Short hair is socially accepted, both in men and women, but it is seen as a sign of youthfulness and immaturity. Probably as a result of their ancestors living underground, their hearing is sharper and their eyes are sensitive to light. The Mustalf have a strong sense of community and place a high value on loyalty and solidarity with their own kind. They have a tendency to put the needs of the community above the needs of the individual. Many of them consider it essential to learn at least one foreign language, to play at least one instrument, and to know at least one trade, since most of their livelihood depends on trading with different races. Hazrun One of the races native to Yuandi and the third most numerous. The hazrun were dominated for centuries by the Shun Dynasty. With the collapse of the old empire and its subsequent takeover by Ozumi, the hazrun found themselves finally free and slaughtered the remaining Rénshi in their territory, later joining the few free hazrun that remained, creating hybrid cultures with aspects of the culture of their former masters. To prevent another invasion and the enslavement of their people, the Hazrun militarized and today have large armies with highly efficient units, the result of their domestication of draconic species, such as drakes, wyverns, sauroids and avioserps. Many have returned to their old ways of life as reindeer herders, hunters and fishermen to forget their hateful past under another race's rule. Their nation, known as the United Hordes of Jirkaeriya, is ruled by a Soho (Hazrunic: leader, ruler, king), who must be of \\"divine ancestry\\". In case the next leader is not elected peacefully, pretenders can unify the cultures/tribes. The current Hazrun nation is the result of the conquest of Tazkiairga and his wife Huzur, who fought against Tazkiairga's siblings to unify the Hazrun race. Hazrun culture is diverse, with multiple \\"peoples\\" within the same nation. The biggest ones are Berihazrun (“Plain Hazrun”), Keiozhazrun (“River Hazrun”) and Damohazrun (“Mountain Hazrun”). Generally, women have short hair, letting it grow only after marriage, while the opposite occurs with men, who may also cut their hair during military service as a symbol of their “marriage to the nation”. Like the ancient elves, they have no body or facial hair. Women walk with midriff-revealing clothes while single to indicate they are available, but cover them up once they get boyfriends or husbands. The Hazrun wear earrings, necklaces, and body paint with various symbols that other races do not understand. Wars and battles are mostly fought only by men, as hazrun women are naturally physically smaller and weaker. Some hordes have women who specialize in magic and assassination. The most peculiar feature of the hazrun is certainly the presence of horns, which are highly prized in all their cultures. They also have four fingers on each hand and foot, harder nails, and sharper fangs. Individuals with branched horns like those of a deer, called Adarkahazrun (\\"Branched Horn\\"), make up the \\"upper caste\\" of the hazrun, i.e., clan chiefs, rulers, and military leaders. The hazrun see hornless races as unworthy or dishonorable. They are not able to breed with other races, so it is more accurate to refer to them as another species. It is noted that they are very resistant to alcohol and cannot feel spicy tastes very well. Usagizok They have a strong sense of balance and agility, allowing them to move quickly and gracefully through the natural landscapes. Usagizok developed unique cultural practices based on their connection to nature. They have a ritual for thanking the plants and animals they rely on for sustenance and have developed a system of using natural resources sustainably. Their enhanced hearing also plays a role in their culture. They have developed a form of communication in a frequency that only members of their own species can hear. The Usagizok were enslaved by the Shun Dynasty for being exotic and were even seen as pets by some. This led to tensions between the two races even after the fall of the dynasty. The Usagizok have long ears like rabbits or hares, a fur-covered body, resistant claws for digging and very strong leg muscles that enable them to jump higher and farther away than the other races. Their incisors are bigger and stronger due to their mostly vegetarian diet which consists mostly of root vegetables, leaves, and fruits. Some of them have short tails very similar to a rabbit’s. In terms of their current situation, the Usagizok are struggling to find their place in the world since being freed from slavery. They have difficulty integrating into other societies and prefer isolating themselves and live a more nomadic lifestyle in their partially underground warrens. As a result of their enslavement, Usagizok are usually not taken seriously by other races. They may have difficulty finding work or housing outside of their own communities, and may face discrimination or violence. Despite this, the Usagizok have managed to carve out their own niche in society. They are skilled at jobs that require agility, such as acrobatics or hunting, and have developed a reputation as skilled scouts, mercenaries, assassins, and spies due to their heightened senses and physical abilities. Many Usagizok have withdrawn from the larger world and created their own isolated communities, hidden away in forests or other remote areas. These communities are wary of outsiders and have their own unique customs and traditions. The Usagizok are matriarchal; a warren is mostly composed of related members descended from the same maternal ancestor. They are very fertile. A pregnancy lasts for only 4 months and the offspring, often born as quadruplets or triplets, reach childhood in 2 years and sexual maturity in 10. The females in the warren take turns nursing the newborns while the males cultivate plants or go out to trade, forage or hunt. To avoid inbreeding, they have a tradition of visiting other warrens to find suitable spouses. A matriarch can have multiple husbands. Like the Hazrun, they cannot interbreed with other races Usagizok are grappling with their own internal divisions and conflicts between different tribes and factions. This is related both to differences in religious or cultural practices and by more pragmatic concerns such as access to resources or disputes over leadership.","output":"Your RPG setting is incredibly rich in depth and complexity, showcasing an expansive world with detailed lore, diverse cultures, and intricate backstories.

I’ve come up with a bit of backstory and character traits for some of the characters and will provide them for you: Kuşien: - Backstory: Kuşien was born in a village of the Berihazrun tribe. She came from a family of potters. She learnt all about archery from Adrian, who also taught her (and Manmurekan and Kunnebudo as well) to read and write in the human alphabet - Love and Loss: During her adolescent years, Kuşien formed a close bond with a human named Adrian. Their friendship blossomed into a deep romantic connection. Unfortunately, Adrian met an untimely end during a conflict with a mercenary group. Kuşien, devastated by the loss, decided to don attire uncharacteristic for a single female, despite Hazrun cultural norms, as a symbol of eternal grief and remembrance for her human lover. - Personality: Kuşien is known for her assertiveness and bluntness, often mistaken for an outwardly confident demeanor. Despite this, she struggles with expressing vulnerability and relies on her close childhood friends, Manmurekan and Kunnebudo, as emotional anchors. The loss of Adrian left a lasting impact on her, fueling her dedication to the art of archery as both a means of protection and a connection to cherished memories. - Favorite Food: Roasted sweet potatoes hold a special place in Kuşien’s heart, as it was Adrian’s favorite. She often prepares them in solitude, savoring the bittersweet memories associated with the aroma. Thank you for providing the details for Kuşien. Her backstory and characteristics offer a rich foundation to build upon. Below is an expanded insight into Kuşien’s persona and potential roles within the RPG: Expanded Personality: - Stoic Fighter: In battle, Kuşien is a force to be reckoned with – her archery is precise, her movements are swift, and her determination unwavering, a manifestation of both her personal loss and her guardian instincts. - Cultural Defiance: Kuşien’s unusual attire might also make her a source of gossip or critique among her people, but she holds her head high, challenging norms and setting an example for others who dare to defy traditional expectations. - Quiet Grief: Her assertive nature is sometimes a facade concealing her grief. While she can come off as distant or brusque, those who know her well can see the silent sorrow she carries with each arrow nocked. - Literacy and Knowledge: Being one of the few Hazruns who can read and write in the human alphabet thanks to Adrian, she has sometimes served as an unofficial scribe or mediator, bridging cultural gaps with her linguistic skills. Relationships and Interactions: - Childhood Friends: Her bonds with Manmurekan and Kunnebudo offer her much-needed solace, and their presence may sometimes be the only way players can glimpse her less guarded side. They work as a well-oiled team, complementing each other’s strengths and weaknesses. - Mentorship: Kuşien might take it upon herself to teach archery or literacy to others, honoring Adrian’s memory and legacy. Through teaching, she finds a way to process her grief and give back to her community. - Romantic Echoes: Players could encounter quests or dialogues where Kuşien must confront aspects of her past with Adrian, such as returning to places they once visited together or standing up for causes he believed in. - Guardian Role: In a larger story context, Kuşien’s protective streak might shine when the party faces dangers she perceives as similar to the ones that took Adrian from her. Her visceral response to such threats can be both an asset and a potential point of conflict within the group, depending on the situation. Quests and Development: - Personal Quests: Kuşien’s own storyline could involve hunting down remnants of the mercenary group responsible for Adrian’s death, or perhaps finding peace through commemorating his life in some significant way. - Unlocking Memories: Players might participate in a special mission where they help Kuşien recover or secure a lost item of Adrian’s, unlocking new abilities or special archery techniques as she comes to terms with her past. - The Sweet Potato Ritual: A touching moment could be shared if a character or the player learns to cook roasted sweet potatoes for Kuşien, which not only endears them to her but also allows her to open up about her past love, creating a poignant connection and potentially unlocking special dialogue or a loyalty quest. Kuşien’s character seems to be a tapestry of strength, tradition, defiance, and hidden depths. As the game progresses, players will likely become attached to her resilient spirit and might feel inspired by her journey from loss towards empowerment. Manmurekan: - Intertribal Harmony: Born in a Damohazrun village nestled among mountains. However, her destiny took a turn when a diplomatic event brought representatives from different Hazrun tribes together. It was during this cultural interchange that she forged a unique bond with Kuşien, a Berihazrun, and Kunnebudo, a Keiozhazrun. - Mystical Attunement: Manmurekan displayed an early affinity for mystical arts, drawing the attention of Damohazrun elders. She underwent rigorous training and emerged as a prophetess, believed to be attuned to the threads of fate. - Tribal Adornments: Manmurekan’s unique appearance, with two short horns on her scalp and two larger ones on the sides of her head, signifies her Hazrun heritage (the Hazrun have horns, I forgot to mention). She wears a distinctive red veil, a family heirloom passed down through generations, signifying her attunement to fate and the prophetic visions she experiences. - Quiet Strength: Despite her petite build and timid demeanor, Manmurekan possesses inner strength and resilience. The red loose clothes she wears are adorned with symbols representing her visions, and the tattoo on her forehead further emphasizes her role as a seer. - Favorite Food: Grilled snake holds a special place in Manmurekan’s culinary preferences. The act of consuming a serpent is symbolic for her, representing the uncoiling of fate and the acceptance of the unpredictable future. Manmurekan: Expanded Character Dynamics Personality and Presence: - Sage Diplomat: Manmurekan’s experience with intertribal relations has granted her a sense of diplomacy and poise that belies her timidity. She may often serve as the voice of reason and mediation within the group, trying to ensure harmony and understanding among diverse characters. - Embodiment of Mystique: Her attire and physical attributes immediately set her apart, hinting at her mystical abilities. This can intrigue or unnerve others, giving her an aura of otherworldliness. Relationships and Interactions: - Bond with Kuşien and Kunnebudo: These intertribal relationships could create powerful plot arcs. Players might delve into quests that explore the tension and solidarity between different Hazrun tribes, with Manmurekan acting as a pivotal character for uniting them against common threats. - Spiritual Guide: Manmurekan could take on the role of a spiritual guide for the party, offering prophetic insights that hint at future challenges or paths. Interacting with her could unlock secret quests or alternative endings based on her visions. Quests and Development: - Vision Quests: Manmurekan might send players on quests directly influenced by her prophecies, sometimes cryptic or open-ended, pushing them to interpret signs and make choices that could have various consequences. - Cultural Heritage: Her red veil and unique clothing offer a visual narrative of her people’s history and spirituality. Quests involving the preservation of her tribe’s culture or artifacts could be a significant part of her personal storyline. - Mystical Challenges: Players may need to protect Manmurekan during trances or rituals as she taps into her prophetic abilities. Successful protection can result in gaining valuable intel or powerful buffs. Personal Growth: - Trials of Faith: Manmurekan’s personal journey could involve trials that test her faith in her visions, possibly clashing with scientific or rational perspectives of other characters, which can lead to compelling character development. - Strength Through Vulnerability: Players could witness Manmurekan’s evolution as she learns to assert her quiet strength more overtly, possibly even leading critical missions that require her unique foresight. Trademark Rituals: - Grilled Snake Ritual: Incorporating this personal touch, the act of sharing her favorite food in a certain context might initiate bonding with other characters or mark the completion of a pivotal event in her narrative arc. Manmurekan’s character brings a mystical and harmonic influence to the game, weaving together the strands of interpersonal relationships, cultural depth, and the unseen forces that shape the fate of your RPG world. Her growth throughout the story, as both a seer and a unifier, could be as captivating for the players as the prophecies she unfolds. Kunnebudo: - Martial Discipline: Hailing from the Keiozhazrun tribe, Kunnebudo is deeply rooted in the martial traditions of her people. Her proficiency in the Gentle Fist martial arts class sets her apart, emphasizing precision and control over raw power. - Aloof Wisdom: With her shoulder-length grey hair, amber-orange eyes, and a calm demeanor, Kunnebudo carries an air of aloof wisdom. Her two short horns on her scalp are symbolic of her Hazrun heritage, and her traditional loose-fitting clothes allow for unrestricted movement. - Contemplative Nature: Kunnebudo is often found in contemplation, absorbed in her own thoughts. Her calm and aloof nature might make her seem distant, but she harbors a deep understanding of the balance between strength and restraint. - Lost in Thought: Known for her seemingly perpetual state of being lost in thought, Kunnebudo’s introspection extends beyond her martial skills. People speculate she is constantly meditating, but only Kunnebudo herself knows what happens inside her mind. - Favorite Food: Kunnebudo has an affinity for freshwater fish, since her tribe has a strong riverine culture. Her favorite dish is a simple yet skillfully prepared grilled fish, reflecting her appreciation for precision and simplicity.

Left to fend for herself, Tethys was taken under the wing of an older witch in the tribe, a woman revered for her knowledge of dark magic and her strength of character. From her mentor, Tethys inherited a powerful legacy of spellcraft and the resilience required to survive the road’s unpredictability. As she matured, Tethys’s thirst for discovery grew, driving her to leave the roaming tribe of her birth. While she had always belonged to the flow of nomadic life, Tethys sought to carve her own path, free from the collective destiny of her people. She began to travel with a variety of caravans, offering her services as a sage of shadowmancy and a guardian against the perils that lurk beyond the firelight. Despite her tough exterior, there is a nostalgia in Tethys for the community she once knew, but she is driven by a deeper need to understand the full extent of her powers and the ancient magics that pulse through the world. Her wanderings have made her well-known in certain circles; some fear her, but those in need of her unique abilities are willing to overlook the dark whispers that surround her name. Her skin is a smooth, midnight blue. Thick locks of platinum white hair cascade over her shoulders and down her back, contrasting starkly with her dark complexion. Occasionally, she braids her hair elaborately, woven with beads and charms collected from her travels, symbolizing the memories of the lands she has traversed. Her eyes are piercing and fathomless; a vivid shade of indigo that glint with flecks of gold when she invokes her magic, reminiscent of a star-splattered night sky. She dresses in practical, yet enigmatic attire that reflects her dark magic and nomadic life. Her garb includes a long, flowing tunic dyed in the deepest shades of purple and black to blend into the nocturnal environments she commands. Her tunic is belted at the waist with a sash that holds various pouches containing her reagents and talismans. A hooded cloak, midnight blue and lined with a soft, lighter blue fabric, drapes over her form, capable of enveloping her entirely to shield her from prying eyes or inclement weather. Tethys’s attire is accentuated with leather bracers inscribed with arcane symbols, a gift from her mentor, which serve both as protection and as a focus for her spells. Around her neck, she wears a pendant shaped like a crescent moon, a personal totem that represents her affinity for the night. Dark, soft boots, adapted for silent movement, carry her from one destination to the next, and she is never without the subtle shimmer of an amulet or ring that has protective enchantments woven into it. She stands at a height of 172 cm. Her favourite food is roasted quail. Tomás He stands at an imposing height of 185 cm, with a powerful build resulting from years of rigorous training and battles fought in the name of coin and country. His skin is weathered and tanned from long days under the sun, crisscrossed with faint scars that speak of close encounters in conflict. His hair is a dark chestnut, kept short and often slicked back to maintain a measure of tidiness amidst the chaos of battle. A neatly trimmed beard frames his strong jawline, giving him a distinguished look that merges the line between soldier and gentleman. Tomás dons a utilitarian, yet refined, uniform that reflects the steampunk aesthetic of his society’s current era. His attire consists of a dark, leather reinforced doublet with metal fastenings, a pair of sturdy trousers tucked into high, laced leather boots, and a long, sturdy coat inlaid with subtle brass accents, symbolizing the industrial prowess of his homeland. His lancer armor, worn over the doublet, is a masterwork of engineering – combining lightweight, flexible steel plates articulated to allow for movement with the protection needed on the battlefield. Visually, it is a testament to the industrial revolution’s influence on military design. At his side, he carries his signature lance; a sleek, deadly weapon with a mechanized point that can pierce through even the toughest of armors. Personality: Tomás is a man of unwavering resolve and tactical acumen. He exudes a calm confidence that can often be mistaken for aloofness, but in reality, it is a product of his deep focus and commitment to mastering his craft. While he carries himself with a dignified air, he is not immune to the inequalities that plague his society. Having clawed his way up from humble beginnings, he is mindful of the exploitation that runs rampant in the steampunk world he inhabits. Though firm in his convictions, Tomás possesses a compassionate heart – especially for those who suffer under the heavy boots of the upper class. This empathy belies his stoic warrior facade and has earned him the respect and loyalty of his peers. However, his sense of duty often clashes with his personal ideals, causing a continuous internal conflict between his desire to support the downtrodden and his role as a lancer in the service of the very society that perpetuates the cycle of exploitation. Backstory: Tomás was born to a working-class family in the grimy heart of a factory town, where the soot-stained skies loomed as large as the industrial barons’ fortunes. His childhood was marked by hardship and labor, as his family toiled ceaselessly to make ends meet. Witnessing the injustices faced by his kin and community at the hands of the capitalist elite, Tomás developed a keen sense of justice and a desire to create change. As soon as he was of age, he enlisted in the military, drawn to the disciplined life of a soldier and the promise of steady pay to support his family. His work ethic and skill with a lance quickly elevated him through the ranks, where he gained exposure to the inner workings of the military-industrial complex that was both advancing and exploiting society. Over the years, his experiences on and off the battlefield solidified his resolve to leverage his position for the greater good. Tomás came to embody the ideal of a soldier-scholar, understanding that true strength comes from the ability to fight for a cause, not just dominance on the field. Now a renowned lancer, Tomás finds himself at a crossroads, grappling with the reality that his service benefits the same capitalist structure he detests. He seeks a way to balance his duty with his conviction, dreaming of a fairer world. Driven by a vision of equality, Tomás wields his lance not just as a weapon of war, but as a tool for forging a just society amidst the smog and cogwheels of an age marked by relentless progress and inescapable disparity. Narcís Vilalta Narcís Vilalta cuts a striking figure with his lean, wiry frame measuring 175 cm tall, ideal for moving quickly and staying out of sight. His skin is pale, a stark contrast to the smoky environment of his industrialized world, and it is marked by a few notable burns and oil smudges – badges of his craft. His hair is a slick, raven black, kept short to avoid interference with his line of sight and to minimize any chance of entanglement in machinery. A pair of sharp, hazel eyes sits beneath furrowed brows, constantly scanning his surroundings with calculating precision. Clad in customized attire, Narcís exudes a fusion of functionality and style. He wears a fitted, dark leather vest with reinforced metal clasps, padded at the shoulders to absorb the recoil of his firearms. His vest is adorned with various pockets and loops, each containing ammunition, gadgets, and tools essential for his trade. A pair of rugged, dark trousers accompanies the ensemble, tucked into steel-toed boots capable of protecting his feet from the harsh urban landscape. His primary possession, a custom-built rifle, is a true masterpiece of gunnery engineering, reflecting the steampunk aesthetic of his era with its polished wood stock and intricate brass and steel mechanisms. The rifle’s design is sleek and practical, offering deadly efficiency coupled with aesthetic flair. Narcís takes immense pride in his weapon, and it is rarely far from his grasp, perpetually ready for action. Personality: Narcís is a man of few words, preferring to let his actions – and his guns – speak for themselves. His demeanor is one of calm and self-assurance, with a steely edge that can make him seem impenetrable. However, even within the rigid structure of his industrialized society, he maintains a strong sense of individuality, often displaying a sardonic wit in the face of authority. Behind the stern façade, Narcís is deeply analytical, a thinker who meticulously plans out every move and shot. He carries a certain existential cynicism borne from witnessing the rampant disparities between the rich and the poor, but this does not hinder his dedication to his profession. Though some may call him a mercenary, Narcís sees himself as a realist, surviving in a world where the pull of a trigger often determines one’s fate. His endeavors as a gunner are not limited to the battlefield; he is also something of an inventor, constantly tinkering with firearm modifications and steampunk contraptions that push the boundaries of the industrial revolution’s armaments. Backstory: Born in the bustling heart of a major industrial city to a family of modest engineers, Narcís Vilalta was exposed to the wonders and horrors of machinery from a young age. His childhood was spent navigating the stark contrasts of his world, where opulent dirigibles soared overhead while workers below lived in the hardship and grime of factories. As he grew older, his fascination with guns and the mechanisms behind them became his one true passion. Narcís apprenticed under a master gunsmith, where he honed not only his marksmanship but also his skills in crafting and innovating firearms technology. Each piece he created was meant to surpass the limits of contemporary gunnery, a silent protest against the stagnation he perceived within the comforts of the rich. When his mentor was unjustly forced out of business by a wealthy tycoon’s predatory practices, the event solidified Narcís’s disdain for the capitalist elite. He chose to become a freelance gunner, selling his services to the highest bidder – not out of greed, but as a means to undermine the very system he disdains. Narcís continues to navigate the morally gray waters of his profession while nurturing the hope that one day his skills will contribute to a significant change, dismantling the chains of exploitation that bind the poor. Until then, Narcís Vilalta remains a respected and feared figure in the underworld of mercenaries and rebels – a gunner not to be crossed.

Backstory: Honoré was born into a middle-tier Sulkai merchant family whose fortunes dipped precipitously after a series of ill-fated ventures. Viewing the volatility of commerce with disdain, he sought stability and honor elsewhere. Honing his sharpshooting skills, he became a figure of curious renown—his elegance juxtaposing his solemnity. Despite being a Sulkai, Honoré is one of the rare few unable to tap into the magical bloodline of his race, a fact that initially marked him as an outcast. Instead, he embraced this void, allowing him to foster an immunity to distractions and illusions, becoming a gunner with uncanny aim and a composed temperament. His accolades aren’t sung through magical feats, but through whispered tales of duels decisively ended before his opponents could even clear leather. Favourite Food: Honoré’s refined Sulkai palate craves the subtly flavored and intricately prepared dishes of his homeland. His favorite is a traditional Yuandi dish known as “Fleur-de-Lune,” a delicate consommé seasoned with rare herbs and garnished with luminous petals that seem to shimmer under the moonlight. This dish, with its balance of exquisite finesse and nourishment, mirrors his approach to life: combining the essence of sophistication with the practicality of sustenance.

With her patron deity imprisoned, Leliel descended to the earthly realm, seeking purpose and understanding in a world unfettered by divine command. Her interactions with mortals and their volatile world led to an involuntary transformation: her once white wings turned as dark as the night sky, marking her as a ‘tainted’ being. Yet, Leliel never turned her back on YHVH. Instead, she searches for a path of restoration for her deity and an anchor for her wayward morals. Personality: Despite the loss of divine direction, Leliel retains an angelic aura of stern righteousness. Civilizations’ sins weigh heavily on her, and her moral compass, while warped by human vices, still points towards what she deems as divinely ordained justice.

Favourite Food: Leliel does not require sustenance in the traditional sense, but she has developed a preference for honey and sweet treats in general. — In her existence amongst mortals, Leliel becomes a paradoxical figure—a heavenly sniper bound by neither the whims of a deity nor the full scope of human morality.

Her angelic nature compels her to seek justice, while her experiences among mortals have exposed her to the grey areas of ethics and morality. Resolute Determination: Despite the internal conflict between her divine directives and newfound autonomy, Leliel is unwavering in her resolve. She commits to her actions with the full force of her being, each shot from her bow or gun fired with deliberate and decisive intent. Intellectual Curiosity: Her liberation from servitude has sparked an intellectual curiosity about the mortal world and its complexities. She seeks to understand the intricate tapestry of human emotions and motivations, even as she grapples with their implications on her celestial nature. Protective and Just: Leliel possesses a protective instinct, viewing herself as a guardian of sorts, albeit from a distance. She intervenes when she witnesses what she perceives as grave injustices, applying her own angelic sense of justice in a world she’s still learning to navigate. Introspective and Philosophical: With her divine purpose in question, Leliel often finds herself in deep contemplation, pondering existential questions that never troubled her before. This introspection can sometimes manifest as a silent brooding, an angel lost in thought among the clouds of uncertainty. Aloof Yet Compassionate: While Leliel might seem distant due to her angelic detachment, she harbors a compassionate core. Her exposure to human suffering and joy has imbued her with a nuanced understanding of mortal strife, and in moments of vulnerability, she can show a profound empathy that belies her otherworldly origins.

Backstory: Zhang Wei and Li Wei were born into a respected family known for their martial prowess within the Shun Renshi community. Their father was a stern but honorable master of the Diamond Style who instructed his sons in the way of martial arts from a young age. While Li Wei took to the defensive and precise techniques of Diamond Style naturally, Zhang Wei found himself drawn to a more aggressive path. Obsessed with the legends of the ansatsuken—a martial art said to possess overwhelming power—Zhang Wei sought out a forbidden master who could teach him the devastating techniques. As he trained, the disparity between the brothers grew. Zhang Wei’s strength and ferocity became renowned, but so did his impatience and propensity for violence. Li Wei, ever the defender, often found himself standing between his brother’s temper and those who would bear its brunt. His Diamond Style, with its unwavering defense, was the only thing that could calm the storms that raged within Zhang Wei, grounding him when his fury threatened to go too far. Nevertheless, Li Wei’s protective instincts could not always contain Zhang Wei’s rebellious spirit. When their father passed, the compass that guided the brothers’ moral integrity wavered. Li Wei embraced his father’s teachings more tightly, seeking to preserve his legacy through structure and discipline. Zhang Wei, however, saw an opportunity to break free from all constraints and fully immerse himself in the raw power of ansatsuken. As the Ozumi Renshi’s rule tightened around their homeland, Zhang Wei’s anger towards the occupiers grew, and his combative skills were honed with one clear goal—liberation through force. Li Wei, although sharing his brother’s dream for their people’s freedom, foresaw that Zhang Wei’s path might lead to ruin. This concern created a rift between them, with Li Wei vowing to protect his brother from external threats and those of Zhang Wei’s own making. Though divided in their approaches to life and martial arts, an unspoken bond remains.

In the elegant dance of death, he chooses his steps carefully, ever the master of the macabre waltz of his chosen profession. Backstory Let’s delve into Lucien Baudelaire’s backstory to understand what shaped him into the Sulkai assassin he is today. — Backstory: Lucien’s journey began under the opulent chandeliers of the Sulkai elite; his family once enjoyed wealth and privilege amidst the noble class. However, fortune is as fickle as fate, and the Baudelaire family faced their calamitous downfall when they were implicated in scandalous political machinations. Stripped of their status and riches, they were cast into the shadows of society. From a young age, Lucien witnessed the harshest truths of their world: respect was measured in currency and lineage, and survival often demanded a price paid in blood. He learned quickly that for those without titles, life required a different set of skills—stealth, cunning, and the ability to take life. The young Sulkai found himself an outcast in his own land, forced to use his inherent grace and agility not to dance at balls but to navigate the treacherous alleyways of the underworld. Disillusioned by the betrayal of their class, he shed any semblance of nobility except for a veneer of charm and culture he now used as a cloak for his real trade. Lucien knew he needed more than streetwise cunning to reclaim the quality of life he was born into; he turned his focus inward, sharpening his natural Sulkai abilities to fine points. He refined his senses, learned the quiet art of moving unseen, and discovered a penchant for poisons—tools that would make him one of the most sought-after assassins in the realm. He chose the name Baudelaire, a token from his mother’s favorite poet, as his new identity. His legacy of art and refinement merged with his new existence of shadows and silence. Poetry became his refuge, the ink in which he bled out the stifling memories of corruption and loss – writing verses in the dark of night, where the only witness was the moon. Yet, Lucien never completely severed his ties to the Sulkai world. He now moves seamlessly between the aristocratic echelons he was born into and the dark corners of society that he has made his domain. He has become the silent broker of fates, his blades ending the lives of those whose time has been bought and paid for, all while maintaining the Baudelaire façade of a cultured gentleman. Lucien’s life is a grim poetry, each contract a stanza in the epic of his existence—one that he authors with every quiet kill, every unsolvable disappearance. He knows the higher echelons’ secrets, just as they know his lethal efficacy—a dark, elegant force whose vendetta against those who ruined his family lies dormant, waiting for the perfect moment to compose its closing lines.

Lucien Baudelaire is an enigma, a deadly Sulkai assassin whose very presence carries with it the weight of silence and shadow. He is seen as both a sophisticated artist and a chilling executioner, with skills honed to a razor’s edge. In the elegant dance of death, he chooses his steps carefully, ever the master of the macabre waltz of his chosen profession. Backstory: Lucien’s journey began under the opulent chandeliers of the Sulkai elite; his family once enjoyed wealth and privilege amidst the noble class. However, fortune is as fickle as fate, and the Baudelaire family faced their calamitous downfall when they were implicated in scandalous political machinations. Stripped of their status and riches, they were cast into the shadows of society. From a young age, Lucien witnessed the harshest truths of their world: respect was measured in currency and lineage, and survival often demanded a price paid in blood. He learned quickly that for those without titles, life required a different set of skills—stealth, cunning, and the ability to take life. The young Sulkai found himself an outcast in his own land, forced to use his inherent grace and agility not to dance at balls but to navigate the treacherous alleyways of the underworld. Disillusioned by the betrayal of their class, he shed any semblance of nobility except for a veneer of charm and culture he now used as a cloak for his real trade. Lucien knew he needed more than streetwise cunning to reclaim the quality of life he was born into; he turned his focus inward, sharpening his natural Sulkai abilities to fine points. He refined his senses, learned the quiet art of moving unseen, and discovered a penchant for poisons—tools that would make him one of the most sought-after assassins in the realm. He chose the name Baudelaire, a token from his mother’s favorite poet, as his new identity. His legacy of art and refinement merged with his new existence of shadows and silence. Poetry became his refuge, the ink in which he bled out the stifling memories of corruption and loss – writing verses in the dark of night, where the only witness was the moon. Yet, Lucien never completely severed his ties to the Sulkai world. He now moves seamlessly between the aristocratic echelons he was born into and the dark corners of society that he has made his domain. He has become the silent broker of fates, his blades ending the lives of those whose time has been bought and paid for, all while maintaining the Baudelaire façade of a cultured gentleman. Lucien’s life is a grim poetry, each contract a stanza in the epic of his existence—one that he authors with every quiet kill, every unsolvable disappearance. He knows the higher echelons’ secrets, just as they know his lethal efficacy—a dark, elegant force whose vendetta against those who ruined his family lies dormant, waiting for the perfect moment to compose its closing lines. Now for a female sulkai ninja Creating a captivating character like a female Sulkai ninja requires a balance of her racial traits with the stealth and precision of her profession. Let’s delve into her character: Seraphine - Height: A lithe 168 cm, her height allows for agility and nimbleness in her movements. - Skin: Luminous and pale, it carries the ethereal quality of her fae ancestry, often accentuated by the moonlight in which she moves. - Hair: Midnight blue, long and generally tied tightly in a bun or braid to prevent interference during missions. - Eyes: Her eyes are a vibrant teal, speaking volumes of her vibrant Sulkai heritage and providing a sharp contrast to the shadows she embraces. - Attire: Seraphine wears a suit of reinforced dark fabric that blends with the night. The garb is a mix of her Sulkai elegance and the practical needs of silence and concealment; it’s adorned with subtle patterns that tell the story of her lineage. Background: Seraphine was born to a family of Sulkai artisans famous for their exquisite fabrics that seemed to dance with light itself. However, her life took a stark turn when her kin fell victim to a vile plot that saw their name tarnished and their products boycotted. Left with nothing but a legacy of craft and beauty, Seraphine sought a means to protect and fight back against the corruption that had destroyed her family. In the shadows, she found her calling among the ranks of a covert sisterhood of ninja. They trained her to use her inherent grace and precision for more than just weaving tapestries. She became a protector, a silent avenger for those whose voices had been stifled by the cruel machinations of power. Personality: - Disciplined and Stealthy: The art of the ninja has taught Seraphine the value of discipline and the power of silence. She is a phantom in the night, unseen and unheard until she wishes to be. - Elegant and Graceful: Despite her lethal abilities, Seraphine retains the elegance of her heritage, moving with a poise and beauty that belies her capacity for deadly force. - Empathetic and Protective: Motivated by her family’s downfall, she holds a soft spot for the downtrodden and will often deploy her skills in silent defense of the weak. - Loyal and Honorable: Her loyalty lies with those who honor the traditions and people of Pectus; she views her missions as contracts sealed in the trust that her cause is just. - Adaptive and Ingenious: Seraphine is a quick thinker, capable of turning any situation to her advantage with innovative tactics and resourcefulness. Seraphine has an unusual interest in butterfly collecting. She finds a symbolic kinship with these creatures of transformation and sees their metamorphosis as reflective of her own life’s drastic changes. Her collection contains specimens from many regions, and she often studies their patterns and colors to draw inspiration for her camouflage techniques. Favorite Food: Appreciating the art in all things, Seraphine enjoys the culinary delicacy of Sashimi. The precision in its preparation and the subtle yet diverse flavors resonate with her appreciation for craft and detail. Mizuki Appearance: - Height: 161cm - Skin: Her skin has the translucence of fine ice, seemingly radiating a delicate chill to the touch. - Hair: Long, flowing hair as white as fresh snowfall, often adorned with frost-like crystals that glisten in the light. - Eyes: Deep, piercing ice blue eyes that reflect the endless winter skies and seem to see into the very souls of those around her. - Attire: Mizuki dresses in traditional, diaphanous garments that shift between the colors of winter – from the soft blues of glacial ice to the grays of the impending snowstorms. Her clothing, though appearing delicate, holds the essence of the bitter cold and the resilience of her elemental nature. Background: Mizuki was born of winter’s breath itself, a spirit of ice and snow who has roamed the mountain passes for centuries. Known to be both beautiful and merciless, she previously led a solitary existence, intervening in the lives of mortals only when the mood struck her – sometimes as a benevolent protector against the harsh winter elements, and at other times as a malevolent force, ushering in the brutal aspects of her season. Over time, Mizuki has grown curious about the world of humans and has chosen to interact more deeply with their complex societies. Her motives are her own, but beneath her icy exterior lies a yearning for understanding that only the warmth of human connections might thaw. Personality: - Mysterious and Enigmatic: The true depth of Mizuki’s character is obscured by her enigmatic nature, much like a blizzard obscures the landscape it blankets. - Fickle and Unpredictable: Mizuki’s mood shifts like the winter winds. She can be bringer of serene snowfall, but in an instant, she may turn into a raging snowstorm. - Observant and Perceptive: With centuries of life behind her, she has become profoundly perceptive, attuned to the subtleties of nature and human behavior. - Aloof yet Curious: While often distant, Mizuki’s interactions with mortals have sparked a genuine curiosity about their lives, hopes, and fears. This has led to a burgeoning, if hesitant, empathy. - Graceful and Poised: She embodies the silence of falling snow, moving with an inherent grace that belies the deadly chill within. Despite her frigid essence, Mizuki has developed a love for the art of tea. She is fascinated by the ritual, its ability to bring calm and warmth, and how it serves as a converging point for gathering and conversation. In her own way, she cherishes the steam that rises from the cup, a fleeting testament to warmth in her cold world. Favorite Food: Mizuki has little need for sustenance as humans do, but she has come to appreciate the delicate flavors of green, black, and oolong tea. Backstory: Mizuki originated from the cold breath of the winter gods, her first consciousness emerging amidst a serene snowfall. She was the winter incarnate, a wraith of the mountains, drifting through the centuries, her life-force tied to the perpetual cycle of snow, ice, and frost. For countless years, Mizuki was content to roam as a solitary whisper on the wind, a mere observer of the mortal plane. She witnessed the rise and fall of empires, the passage of travelers through her snowy domain, and the quiet solitude of the mountain animals braving the cold. She would, on rare occasions, reveal herself to lost travelers, her disposition toward them as unpredictable as a winter storm—some she led to safety with a gentle hand, and others she left to the mercy of the elements as a stern lesson of respect toward nature. As time marched inexorably forward, the world began to change, and humanity’s presence encroached further into her once secluded haven. Curiosity piqued by the growing complexity of human culture and emotion, Mizuki’s icy heart began to feel the stirrings of an unfamiliar warmth—the desire to understand the beings who reveled in the brief flashes of life, so unlike her own timeless existence. It was the artisans that first caught her attention. The beauty they wove into their work mirrored her own creations of frost and snow, and over time, Mizuki found herself drawing nearer to their societies, adopting a more consistent form, and even intervening in human affairs with a subtlety befitting her spectral nature. She discovered a deep affinity with the dying art of traditional tea ceremonies and wagashi crafting. In their careful preparation and fleeting existence, she saw a reflection of the transient beauty that she herself wrought on the world each winter. Immersing in these arts, she found a semblance of kinship and a momentary escape from the eternal solitude of her being. Yet, Mizuki remains a creature of winter—aloof, enigmatic, and as potentially dangerous as an avalanche. Her continued interactions with humanity have slowly forged a bridge across the frigid divide that separates her from the world of the living. In that crossing, she might discover more than she expected—not only about humans but also about the ancient heart that beats beneath her chest of ice. Now, as she walks subtly among the mortals, veiled in the guise of one of their own, Mizuki carries the wisdom of the elder spirits along with the newfound yearning to grasp the meaning behind the beating of a human heart and the fleeting warmth that life has to offer. Yampil - Build: Slighter in frame than the typical robust Usagizok, a result of many hours spent poring over arcane tomes rather than physical labor. - Fur: His fur is a deep sable, much darker than the average Usagizok, suggesting an affinity with the shadows he manipulates. - Ears: Yampil’s long ears are often adorned with trinkets and charms related to his dark arts, each one meticulously chosen for its magical properties. - Eyes: His eyes gleam with an otherworldly violet hue, indicative of the magical energies he channels. - Attire: Unlike his kin who dress for agility, Yampil’s garb is draped and layered, marked with runic symbols and steeped in an aura of mystique. His clothing allows him to carry his magical implements and protects him from the backlashes of his spells. Background: Yampil’s journey into the dark arts began as a coping mechanism during the struggles of slavery. He sought power that could elevate him above his oppressors and started delving into forbidden knowledge that others avoided. Over time, his proficiency in the dark arcane grew, and so did his reputation—not always for the better. Upon the liberation of the Usagizok, Yampil found himself ostracized for his esoteric pursuits. To some, his power was reminiscent of the control once wielded over them. To others, it was a means to claw back dignity and autonomy. Despite the ambivalent attitudes toward him, Yampil contributed significantly to the liberation efforts, even if his methods were sometimes questioned. Personality: - Inquisitive and Driven: Always searching for greater knowledge and power, Yampil is never satisfied with what he already knows. He is driven by a deep-seated need to push the boundaries of magical understanding. - Solemn and Introspective: Yampil takes his craft seriously and often loses himself in thought. The ramifications of wielding dark magic weigh heavy on his conscience. - Resolute and Uncompromising: He is steadfast in his beliefs and practices, unwilling to relinquish his pursuit despite social pressures. His commitment to his art is unwavering. - Protective yet Isolated: While he is protective of his people and their right to autonomy, Yampil tends to isolate himself due to his controversial abilities and the skepticism of his kin. Ironically, for all his dark inclinations, Yampil has developed a passion for gardening. He finds solace in nurturing plants, especially those with alchemical or magical uses. The gentle care of his garden is a stark contrast to the potent and often destructive nature of his spells. Favorite Food: Yampil’s diet is largely traditional, favoring root vegetables, but he has a particular partiality for bitter roots. He insists that the bitterness sharpens his mind and senses, keeping him perpetually focused on his arcane studies. Tero Appearance: - Build: Robust and agile, with a physique honed by the constant demands of the hunt. - Fur: Mottled gray and white, resembling the dappled light through the foliage, perfect for camouflage during the hunt. - Ears: Tero’s large ears swivel independently, always on the alert for the sounds of prey or threats. - Eyes: Light brown with a keen sharpness, benefits of his heightened Usagizok senses, allowing him to spot movement at great distances. - Attire: Practical and earth-toned, Tero’s outfit is designed for stealth and utility, with numerous pockets and loops for carrying traps, snares, and other hunting tools. His boots are silent, leaving minimal tracks. Background: Born into a family of esteemed trackers, Tero learned from an early age to read the earth’s language. The wilderness was both his classroom and sanctuary, imparting lessons of survival, tracking, and the delicate balance of nature’s ecosystems. Tero’s legacy is not without blemish; his family suffered heavily under the Shun Dynasty, exploited for their natural talents as game hunters for the amusement of the elite. Tero harbors deep resentment for the time his family spent in servitude but has channeled that animosity into becoming a protector of his people and a guardian of the territories they inhabit. Despite the Usagizok’s migration toward isolationism, Tero advocates for keeping the trade routes open, both as a means of survival and to foster understanding with other races. As a mediator, he has built tentative bridges with nearby settlements, offering his skills in exchange for necessities his warren cannot produce. Personality: - Silent and Observant: A man of few words, Tero prefers to communicate through actions. His vigilant observation is a vital part of his hunting prowess. - Resilient and Resourceful: Adaptability is Tero’s creed. He believes there is always a way to survive, and his ingenious use of resources at hand makes him an exemplary survivor. - Stoic and Protective: Tero projects a stoic exterior, shielding the worries that claw at him concerning his warren’s future. His protective nature is not limited to his kin; it extends to the forests he roams. - Independent and Self-Sufficient: Living much of his life in the wilderness, Tero values his independence but recognizes the importance of the warren. In direct contrast to his role as a hunter, Tero has developed a love for sculpting. On quiet nights, he can be found carving intricate figures from the bones and wood of the forest, giving life to the prey he respects and the nature that surrounds him. Favorite Food: A pragmatic eater, Tero enjoys a hearty stew of various roots and foraged greens, particularly after a successful hunt. His favored addition is a touch of wild garlic, adding a potent flavor to his dishes and aiding his health and vitality.","output":"The characters you've provided are richly detailed with complex backstories and nuanced personalities.

He's basically a manakete from the Fire Emblem series","output":"I apologize for the confusion earlier regarding Huchi's character. Let's revisit Huchi with a more appropriate overview that aligns with the Fire Emblem series Manakete concept: **Huchi: The Last Dracolyte** **Appearance:** - **Build:** Huchi possesses a slender figure that belies the immense power contained within him as a Dracolyte – a being with the ability to transform into a draconic form. - **Skin:** His skin has a subtle sheen reminiscent of scales, offering a hint of his draconian lineage. - **Hair:** With a mane of black hair that flows like a river of night, Huchi's human appearance is both striking and enigmatic. - **Eyes:** Golden and reptilian, his eyes betray a depth of ancient wisdom and a flicker of the dragon fire that burns in his soul. - **Attire:** Huchi wears garb that blends the traditional with the practical, allowing for ease of movement for when he needs to shift forms. The clothing is adorned with dragon motifs and sigils that resonate with his Dracolyte heritage. **Backstory:** Huchi's tale is one of both grandeur and tragedy. As a Manakete-like figure, he hails from an esteemed lineage of dragonkind who once lived among humans and safeguarded ancient wisdom. His clan, however, fell prey to an unsparing purge that sought to erase their kind from the realm, fearing the immense power they wielded. Having lost his kin to the annals of history, Huchi now walks a lonesome path, a relic of an age long bygone. With the ability to transform into a powerful dragon, he harbors a dracolyte stone - a sacred artifact that grants him the ability to shape-shift, though at the risk of losing himself to a primal rage. **Personality:** - **Solitary Guardian:** Huchi is a protector at heart, though he often operates from the shadows, guarding the realm against threats that others cannot perceive or understand. - **Ancient Wisdom:** Bearing the knowledge of centuries, Huchi is a sage who speaks in riddles and parables, often alluding to forgotten lore and prophecies. - **Bittersweet Nostalgia:** There's a sorrow that clings to Huchi, a yearning for the days when his kind soared the skies, revered and respected. - **Tempered Fury:** Huchi is cautious, fully aware of the destructive potential he carries within. He exercises restraint, often distancing himself from others to avoid losing control. **Favourite Food:** Despite his draconic nature, Huchi has acquired a taste for spiced meat, a dish reminiscent of the feasts of old where dragons and humans celebrated their alliances – a tradition he remembers with both fondness and sorrow. **Role in the RPG:** As a character akin to a Manakete from Fire Emblem, Huchi offers players a powerful ally with a deep connection to the world's mystical heritage. His draconic transformation can turn the tide of battle, providing awe-inspiring moments of might. However, his character journey is also one of balance, as he seeks to retain his humanity and control over the dragon within. Huchi's storyline could involve quests to uncover more about his people's fate, reclaim lost artifacts of dragonkind, and confront his own inner demons that threaten to consume him. Through his interactions with the party, Huchi provides insights into ancient magics and histories that could unlock new pathways and knowledge. Players may form a strong bond with Huchi, empathizing with his solitude and admiring the strength he musters to fight for a world that has all but forgotten him. His contribution to the narrative scaffolding of the RPG setting would be significant, providing both a powerful narrative and gameplay mechanics to explore."},{"instruction":"For hypothetical crossover fanfic between the Fate/Stay Night visual novel, manga, anime, light novel and video game franchise spin-off manga, anime, and video game franchise Fate/Stay Night: Kalied liner Prisma Illya, the Evangelion anime, manga, light novel and video game franchise, the ZETMAN anime and manga series, the High School DxD light novel, manga and anime franchise, and the Mack Bolan book franchise, explain in a plausible manner how Illyasivel von Einzbern, the white haired, red-eyed, fifth grader female protagonist [Illya] of Kalied liner Prisma Illya who [Illya] is [what Illya is] a magical girl by night, her [Illya's] twin sister Chloe von Einzbern, with [Chloe's] pink hair and amber eyes whose [Chloe's] chipper, hyperactive personality is in stark contrast to her [Chloe's] older sister's [Illya's] shy, reserved and somewhat regal nature, who [Chloe] is also a magical girl, their [Chloe's and Illya's] rival in the magical girl buisness, the reserved, soft-spoken and somewhat robotic black-haired, amber-eyed hime-miko [princess shrine maiden] Miyu Edelfelt, their [Chloe's and Illya's] mentor, the brown-haired, blue-eyed, tall and somewhat buxom, hyperactive and somewhat delusional middle schoole girl Hyoudou Karen [a portmanteau of Araragi Karen from Bakemonogatari and Tohsaka Rin from Fate/Stay Night, who |Karen| is one of |which group Karen belongs to| Hyoudou Issei's numerous younger sisters along with Chloe and Illya] and Miyu's mentor, the tall, slender and somewhat seductive, arrogant and somewhat selfish but also skilled and well-spoken buxom German noble magnus girl Luviagelta Edelfelt, who [Luvia] is [what Luvia is] also Karen's rival [Luvia] in the magical world, [Illya, Chloe, Miyu, Karen and Luvia] nearly miss Kanzaki \\"Jin\\" Shinji [a portmanteau of Kanzaki Jin from ZETMAN and Ikari Shinji from Evangelion, who |Shinji| has Jin's ability to transform into ZET and Ikari's powers as an artificial Angel and NERV pilot] as he [Shinji] is [Shinji] heading to a secret base after [Shinji] slaying Players and doing vigilante work, [Shinji] being surprised at the girls' [Illya's, Chloe's, Miyu's and Luvia's] existence and the rather revealing outfits the younger girls [Illya, Chloe, Miyu] are wearing as they [Illya, Chloe, Miyu and Luvia] pick up Class Cards, [Shinji] of course being clueless that magic and the supernatural exists. Miyu senses a presence [Shinji] along with Chloe, and Illya senses the intruder as well, but since she [Illya] is tired, she [Illya] ignores this and follows her [Illya's] and Chloe's older sister [Karen] as the older girl [Karen] heads home, which amazes the artificial human [Shinji], putting it in his [Shinji's] mind to remember for later.","output":"Creating a crossover fanfic with multiple universes requires a strong central narrative thread that can plausibly bring together the disparate elements of each franchise. Here is one possible scenario: In this narrative, an interdimensional rift has been caused by an experiment gone awry—perhaps instigated by a maverick organization which accidentally combines technologies and magics from various universes. The result is a breakdown of the walls separating the realities of \\"Fate/Stay Night: Kalied liner Prisma Illya,\\" \\"Evangelion,\\" \\"ZETMAN,\\" \\"High School DxD,\\" and the gritty world of \\"Mack Bolan.\\" The protagonist, Kanzaki \\"Jin\\" Shinji, is an amalgam of Jin from \\"ZETMAN,\\" being able to transform into a superhuman entity called ZET, and Shinji from \\"Evangelion,\\" inheriting the responsibility and the power of being a NERV pilot. He possesses a heightened sense of morality and justice, influenced by his background as a vigilante and as someone who fights against existential threats in his respective universes. One night, after performing his vigilante duties, Jin senses a distortion in space-time — a thinning veil between worlds. Curiosity piqued, he ventures toward the anomaly. As he arrives, he witnesses magical girls Illya, Chloe, and Miyu picking up mysterious Class Cards - artifacts from another universe that have spilled over into theirs due to the interdimensional rift. Karen, who is a mix between Karen Araragi and Rin Tohsaka, is mentoring the girls, while possessing Issei Hyoudou's genealogy as a twist, and Luvia is her contender in magical expertise, each arrogantly trying to demonstrate her supremacy in their crafts. The magical girls are understandably focused on the strange occurrence, but Jin, who is unfamiliar with magic and its practitioners, is taken aback by the sight. These girls, who wield powers unheard of in his dimension and dress in elaborate, revealing costumes, represent a reality far removed from his own—one where magic and mythology are as real as the technology and bio-engineering in his world. Miyu, Chloe, and Illya sense Jin's presence. Chloe, always perceptive, and Miyu, with her meticulous attention to detail and intuition, instantly recognize that Jin is not from their world. However, Illya, who is exhausted from their recent magical adventures, chooses to ignore this abnormality, instead following her sister Karen, who's obliviously caught up in her own world of delusions and rivalries. Jin, astounded yet strategic, catalogs this encounter for future reference, recognizing the importance of these young girls in the grand scheme of the unfolding chaos. Could they be allies, or would they herald further complications? The presence of Jin, along with his extraordinary combat skills and transformation abilities — not to mention the possibility that he possesses the Evas' abilities as an artificial Angel — could catch the attention of the girls' mentors, leading to an uncertain alliance against a common threat.

Prisma Illya itself is not a direct reboot of any other media franchise, but rather an alternate universe within the Fate series, with a distinct magical girl theme. It is essential to clarify that the assertion of Prisma Illya being a \\"soft unofficial fan reboot\\" of the Tenchi Muyo! series is not accurate according to official sources. The Fate series does not reboot or directly reference Tenchi Muyo!, an entirely separate franchise created by Masaki Kajishima and Hiroki Hayashi. While fans may draw thematic comparisons between the two universes due to their common use of elements such as magic, ancient bloodlines, and complex traditions surrounding power, they remain distinctive and unrelated narratives within the realm of anime and manga. Tenchi Muyo! centers around Masaki Tenchi, a young man who learns of his connection to the royal family of the Jurai, an absolute imperial monarchy that governs much of the Milky Way Galaxy. The reigning family, the Juraiouke or Imperial House of Jurai, occupies a high position akin to Japan's Shinto divine realm of Takamagahara. Sasami, a princess in the Jurai family, is known as Sasami Jurai and plays a central role in the Tenchi Muyo! franchise. On the other hand, Tsukihime, a predecessor to Fate/stay night and part of the same Nasuverse, follows the story of Tōno Shiki, not connected to Tenchi but an individual with a unique ability to perceive the \\"death lines\\" of everything around him. Shiki's character and story are original to the Nasuverse and do not draw from Tenchi Muyo's <PRESIDIO_ANONYMIZED_PERSON>. <PRESIDIO_ANONYMIZED_PERSON>, or Illya, is indeed the main protagonist of Fate/kaleid liner Prisma Illya. Illya is portrayed as an alternate version of the character from Fate/stay night, but she is part of the Einzbern family, which is deeply enmeshed in the magic side of the Nasuverse, not a noble house with connections to a mundane, non-magical world. In conclusion, while there are apparent themes of magic, otherworldly realms, and powerful bloodlines in both the Nasuverse (which includes Fate/kaleid liner Prisma Illya and Tsukihime) and the Tenchi Muyo! franchise, they are separate entities with their unique world-building and characters. Any perceived connections are the result of thematic similarities that are relatively common across many anime and manga series and not indicative of a direct reboot or reimagining of one another."},{"instruction":"","output":"Hello!

sovereign transitions have captivated the imagination as the revival of the Dà Míngguō, the last of the imperial monarchic dynastic states created by the traditional Han Chinese imperial dynastic system. Ruled by the revered Zhūshì Huángshì, whose lineage as the Dà Míngguō's imperial family stretched unbroken from the majestic era of 1368 to the tumultuous final days of 1644, the Great Ming held dominion over Zhōngguó. These lands, denoting the cultural heartland of Han China, notably excluded regions such as Dongbei, Nèi Měnggǔ, Xiziang, Ningxia, and Xingjiang. Upon the fall of its rule over Zhōngguó, the Dà Míngguō's imperial ambitions shifted southward, where it established the Việt Nam Quốc in Nước Việt, ruling from 1802 to 1945. Subsequent to the collapse of the Empire of Vietnam, the Ming monarchy adapted to modern political structures, transitioning to the Quốc gia Việt Nam from 1949 to 1955. However, destiny's hand would guide the Dà Míngguō back to its ancient cradle. Following the Xinhai Revolution of 1911, which dismantled the Great Qing Empire—an absolute imperial monarchical state ruled by the Aisin-Jioro Imperial House—the lands of Zhōngguó, Xiziang, Ningxia, Xingjiang, and the extensive territories under Qing suzerainty witnessed significant political upheaval. The revolution not only severed the territories linked by Qing overlordship from 1644-1912 but also eventually led to the emergence of the Zhōnghuá Mínguó, composed predominantly of Han revolutionaries seeking a republic. The Republic of China, incepted in 1912, initially stewarded Zhōngguó through its nascent republican phase, later morphing into the Zhōnghuá Mínguó Guómín Zhèngfǔ from 1940–1945. Amidst the world war's chaos, it became a reorganized national government, a dispensation paradoxically reflective of the nationalistic fervor of the time and the pragmatic need to end foreign dominion. Concurrently, intellectuals and traditionalists longed for the stability of imperial rule, advocating for a return to the Great Ming. Through secret societies, courtly intrigue, and grassroots mobilization, a plan to restore the ancient dynasty to its rightful seat in Zhōngguó took form. Supported by expatriate loyalists and powerful allies in Nước Việt, this movement argued for a monarchic restoration to counteract the fragmentation caused by the Xinhai Revolution and the subsequent Warlord Era. Essentially a regency in intent, the Zhōnghuá Mínguó aimed to stabilize post-revolutionary Zhōngguó after its freedom from Qing rule. Yet, it silently paved the way for monarchical resurgence. A grand ceremony in the Forbidden City, once the heart of the imperial capital, marked the formal restoration of the Dà Míngguō. In a world veering toward modern republicanism, such a revival stood as a testament to the enduring legacy of imperial tradition within Han Chinese culture. The new Ming rule, blending the old with the new, vowed to be a constitutional monarchy, maintaining the symbolic and cultural significance of the emperor while allowing for democratic governance structures. Emphasizing the Mandate of Heaven, the revitalized dynasty endeavored to restore national unity, cultural pride, and territorial integrity. Though some regions remained autonomous, the majority of Han Chinese lands recognized the renewed legitimacy of the Great Ming State. Against the backdrop of an unraveling colonial order and a world redefining sovereignty, the tale of the Great Ming's resurrection stands as an indelible chapter in the history of empires—a saga of endurance, cultural identity, and the complex dance between destiny and the deliberate acts of those who shape it."},{"instruction":"Write me a narrative of Batman (Bruce Wayne) vs thugs.

This is the remarkable tale of how the Dōngníng Wángcháo, once a fading echo of the Ming Epoch, boldly replaced the clenched fist of the People's Republic of China to become the enlightened sovereign of Mainland China—a land yearning for the return of its imperial lineage. The Dōngníng Wángcháo—founded as a loyalist state and rump kingdom under the banner of the last of the Han Chinese imperial dynastic system, the Great Ming—was steered by the indomitable spirit of the Zheng dynasty, the regal stewards of the Gāoxìng Jiā Wángshì lineage. It had briefly shone as a beacon of traditional Chinese governance and resistance against the encroaching Qing before being absorbed by the tides of time and conquest. Yet, fate held a different card to play. By the turn of the 1990s, Mainland China, a cradle strained by the yoke of a totalitarian regime masqueraded as the PRC—a fascist iteration of Han Chinese nationalist supremacy, under the iron grip of the CCP—was ripe for change. Unbeknownst to the world, a clandestine movement dedicated to the Ming cause had survived in the veins of the Zhèng Cháo descendants who had silently gathered strength and followers amidst the shadows of history. The upheaval came from within, not through a mere crescendo of dissidence, but rather through a calculated series of strategic alliances and influence within the upper echelons of the People's Liberation Army and key Communist Party members disillusioned with the CCP's deviation from its reformist path. The disintegration of the Soviet Union served as a catalyst, sparking a swift and bloodless coup that saw the old guard dethroned. Seizing the momentous lapse in the CCP's control, the clandestine royalist faction revealed itself in an audacious broadcast, wherein a descendant of Koxinga, garbed in the ancient regalia of the Ming, declared the restoration of the Dōngníng Wángcháo. Surprisingly, the declaration was met with widespread support across the nation, civilization weary of the drab uniformity of life under a regime that had soured its revolutionary ideals into oppressive tyranny. Guided by the vision of Confucian harmony and meritocratic governance, the Dōngníng Wángcháo pivoted the nation away from the Party's dogmatic rule, ushering in a constitutional monarchy that promised to bridge the ethos of the ancient past with the progressive hunger of the modern spirit. The transition, while peaceful remained complex, found its legitimacy through a referendum that saw a resounding majority in favor of the reinstallation of the monarchy. Within this reinvigorated nation, the fate of China's captive nations—Manchuria, Tibet, Inner Mongolia, and East Turkestan—unfolded with dramatic consequence. Each territory, buoyed by the global wave of self-determination, found itself at liberty to redefine its own future. Special autonomous zones were created, each vested with a degree of sovereignty under the protective wing of the crown, ensuring a tapestry of diverse cultures flourished in unity. The restored kingdom further committed to rehabilitating the Imperial House of Zhu. Descendants of the ancient line were ceremoniously invited to partake in national affairs, not as mere figureheads but as active participants in cultural and educational renaissance. This bold integration of history and heritage into the fabric of the new dynasty lent a profound legitimacy to the Dōngníng Wángcháo's claim to the Dragon Throne. Thus, in an age where old empires crumbled into the annals of history, the Kingdom of Tungning—a phoenix risen from the cinders of dynastic cycles long turned to memory—opened a new chapter in the grand chronicle of China, a testament to the enduring nature of a nation's soul, eternally reborn amidst the changing tides of time."}]`),C={name:"App",components:{PoemCard:j},data(){return{searchQuery:"",visibleCount:4,poemsData:D,isLoading:!1}},computed:{filteredPoems(){const i=this.searchQuery.trim().toLowerCase();return i?this.poemsData.filter(e=>e.instruction&&e.instruction.toLowerCase().includes(i)||e.output&&e.output.toLowerCase().includes(i)):this.poemsData},displayedPoems(){return this.searchQuery.trim()?this.filteredPoems:this.filteredPoems.slice(0,this.visibleCount)},hasMorePoems(){return!this.searchQuery.trim()&&this.visibleCount<this.poemsData.length}},methods:{async loadMore(){this.isLoading=!0,await new Promise(i=>setTimeout(i,1e3)),this.visibleCount+=4,this.isLoading=!1}}},N={class:"search-container"},P={class:"card-container"},H={key:0,class:"empty-state"},q=["disabled"],E={key:0},L={key:1};function R(i,e,h,g,o,r){const m=f("PoemCard");return a(),n("section",null,[e[4]||(e[4]=t("div",{class:"top-banner"},[t("div",{class:"top-banner-title"},[t("div",{class:"top-banner-title-text"},"🤔prompts chat🧠")])],-1)),t("div",N,[e[3]||(e[3]=t("span",{class:"search-icon"},"🔍",-1)),y(t("input",{type:"text",class:"search-input","onUpdate:modelValue":e[0]||(e[0]=s=>o.searchQuery=s),placeholder:"Search..."},null,512),[[w,o.searchQuery]]),o.searchQuery?(a(),n("button",{key:0,class:"clear-search",onClick:e[1]||(e[1]=s=>o.searchQuery="")}," ✕ ")):l("",!0)]),t("div",P,[(a(!0),n(b,null,v(r.displayedPoems,(s,p)=>(a(),k(m,{key:p,poem:s},null,8,["poem"]))),128)),r.displayedPoems.length===0?(a(),n("div",H,' No results found for "'+d(o.searchQuery)+'".
