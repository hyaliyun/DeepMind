(CNN) -- Running at full speed since the summer, a lab with the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, testing blood samples collected by American hospitals on patients they suspected of having Ebola, has returned a negative result in every case. Until Tuesday. Some public health officials are explaining the first confirmed case of the Ebola virus in the United States, found in a man in Dallas, as a predictable event. But at least for this case, there are many questions surrounding that assertion. Were crucial procedures that might have prevented the victim--who Liberian officials have identified as Thomas Eric Duncan, according to an article in the New York Times--from arriving in the United States not in place? CDC epidemiologists performing the painstaking \\"contact tracing\\" of the patient's movements for the four days he was symptomatic in the","output":"United States have begun piecing together a clearer picture of how the virus may have been transmitted and whether any other individuals are at risk. The process involves interviewing the patient, his family, friends, and any others he may have come into contact with, while also examining travel records, flight manifests, and other data to determine the extent of potential exposure. According to the CDC, Duncan initially sought medical care on September 26, but was sent home with antibiotics, despite having informed the hospital staff of his recent travel history in Liberia. It wasn't until September 28 that he was admitted to the hospital, isolated, and tested for Ebola. This crucial misstep has raised concerns about the preparedness of US hospitals to handle Ebola cases, as well as the effectiveness of the screening procedures at airports for travelers coming from Ebola-affected regions in West Africa. Furthermore, Liberian authorities have stated that Duncan lied about his potential exposure to the virus before leaving the country, raising additional concerns about the efficacy of airport health screenings in affected countries and the role of personal responsibility in preventing the spread of the virus. \\"It's not a case of 'if,' but 'when' the next Ebola case will surface in the US,\\" said Dr. Anthony Fauci, director of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases. However, both CDC officials and many public health experts have emphasized that while the virus's arrival in the United States is certainly notable, it does not pose a significant threat to public health, given the nation's modern healthcare infrastructure and robust infection control protocols. So, why did Duncan slip through the cracks, and how can we prevent such events from happening in the future? Some experts argue that airport health screenings lack precision and can be easily evaded with dishonest answers, while others blame the fragmented nature of the US healthcare system, which can lead to discrepancies in how potential Ebola cases are handled. As a result, many calls have been made to strengthen the existing protocols and procedures, in order to prevent future transmission. These measures might include pre-departure Ebola screenings in the affected countries, more comprehensive medical histories for international travelers, better coordination among healthcare providers, and increased training for hospital staff so they can more effectively identify and respond to potential Ebola cases. It is crucial to remember that while the United States is well-equipped to handle isolated Ebola cases, tracking and containing the virus in its source region of West Africa remains the best way to prevent a global outbreak. Bolstering public health infrastructure there and supporting efforts to combat the spread of the virus can not only save countless lives but also significantly diminish the risk of Ebola transmission beyond the region. This includes providing adequate resources, personnel, and training to treat patients, trace contacts, and break the chain of transmission. In conclusion, Thomas Eric Duncan's arrival in the United States and subsequent Ebola diagnosis have put a spotlight on the potential weaknesses in our nation's preparedness to deal with this deadly virus. It is now up to healthcare officials, policymakers, and the general public to acknowledge these shortcomings and take action to prevent future incidences, both domestically and across the globe."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

From blogs, news articles, tutorials, and research papers to social media profiles, web apps, and online communities, there's an unlimited number of resources at our fingertips. With so much to explore, keeping track of web pages and finding your way back to relevant content can be a daunting task. This is where the simple yet powerful feature of browser bookmarks comes in. Bookmarks are essentially shortcuts to your favorite or frequently visited web pages that make the process of revisiting them much more straightforward. However, as you accumulate more and more bookmarks, keeping them organized and easy to navigate becomes crucial for an efficient browsing experience. In this article, we will discuss some valuable tips and methods to optimize your bookmark management, starting with the basics and moving on to more advanced techniques. 1. Bookmarking a page using the star icon: Almost all modern browsers have a quick and straightforward method for bookmarking web pages. Simply look for a small star icon next to the URL in the address bar. By clicking on it, you can instantly save the current page as a bookmark. Depending on your browser, you may also be prompted to choose a folder or destination for your new bookmark, so it stays organized from the very beginning. 2. Exploiting the power of the bookmark bar: For web pages you visit frequently, like your email, calendar, or project management tools, consider using the bookmark bar. This is a toolbar, typically located directly below the address bar, that provides one-click access to your favorite sites. Adding bookmarks to this toolbar is as easy as clicking and dragging the website's URL or the tab directly into the desired position on the bar. Additionally, you can remove the bookmark titles to save space and only display the site's icon for a cleaner look. 3. Organizing bookmarks with folders: As the number of your bookmarks grows, organizing them into folders and subfolders becomes essential. By keeping similar bookmarks grouped together in folders, you can quickly locate and access information when you need it. This is especially helpful when you have countless bookmarks related to different interests, projects, or topics. To create a new folder, open your bookmark manager — this can usually be found in the browser's menu under \\"Bookmarks\\" or \\"Favorites.\\" From there, you can create and name new folders, as well as drag and drop existing bookmarks into these organized categories. 4. Making the most of subfolders: When organizing bookmarks, don't hesitate to create subfolders within your existing folders for even more granularity. This is particularly useful when certain bookmark categories have significant variations or cover multiple sub-topics. Breaking them down further into subfolders will make it easier for you to locate the exact information you're looking for at any given moment. 5. Harnessing the potential of bookmark organizing extensions: Modern browsers also offer various extensions and add-ons that can automatically handle your bookmark organizing tasks. These tools can detect duplicates, analyze the content of your bookmarks, automatically sort them into folders based on their themes, and even suggest a more appropriate location when you're adding a new bookmark. Some popular bookmark organizing extensions include Tidy Bookmarks for Chrome, Bookmark Sort & Backup for Firefox, and Raindrop.io, which provides cross-browser compatibility. Conclusion: Efficiently organizing your bookmarks can massively enhance your browsing experience, making it easier for you to revisit your favorite sites and find relevant content efficiently. By using the star icon for quick bookmarking, taking advantage of the bookmark bar, and implementing folder and subfolder organization, you can transform your bloated and unordered bookmarks list into a well-structured, easily navigable system. Furthermore, browser extensions can provide automated assistance in maintaining your bookmark organization, so that you can focus on discovering and enjoying new content without losing track of essential resources. With the right approach and tools, organizing your bookmarks is a breeze, and you can enjoy a faster, more streamlined browsing experience."},{"instruction":"User will you give you a task with some instruction.

A boat, on the other hand, is a smaller watercraft and is more suitable for shallow water navigation. Boats are primarily used for recreational purposes, fishing, or short distance transportation. 2.

Keeping personal and geographical names in their original form is a common practice in translation as alteration may lead to loss of meaning or identification. Please note that the syntax in Czech language can be different as some words can change places but the meaning stays the same. In English, the fixed order of words in a sentence is usually subject-verb-object but the Czech language allows subject-object-verb which is the case of this sentence."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

If you ask, \\"why would anyone ever do that,\\" then you obviously haven't heard of the \\"Condom Snorting Challenge.\\"      This is what you would do if you wanted to participate in this \\"Challenge\\" and demonstrate to everyone that you have absolutely no proper judgment. You would unwrap a new condom (because a used condom would be even worse) inhale it up one nostril and then try to pull it out through your pharynx and mouth, all the while filming it to then post the video on YouTube or some other social media platform.      This \\"Condom Challenge\\" is actually not new and has been around for a number of years, because stupidity doesn't go away that easily. Back in 2013, Alex Alvarez wrote for ABC News about how a YouTube video uploaded in June 2007 showed the act and how the Challenge may have gotten more attention when YouTuber \\"Savannah Strong\\" posted on April 8, 2013, a video of her snorting a condom to the tune of Taylor Swift's \\"22.\\"      In case you are wondering what it looks like, here's a Tweet with a picture:      Doesn't that look wonderful? If you want to see what it looks like in action, a number of videos (such as this one) pop up on YouTube when you search for \\"condom snorting\\" but beware they may make you wince.      Gee, what could go wrong when inhaling an object made of latex rubber and covered in lubricant and spermicide? Well, first of all, here's the list of things that you should be snorting up you nose:      Air      The only possible addition to this list would be medications like nasal sprays, but only when your doctor recommends them and there is a true medical indication. Otherwise, anything else that goes up your nose can damage the sensitive inner lining of your nose, cause an allergic reaction, or result in an infection. I've already written for Forbes about the dangers of snorting chocolate and similar concerns apply to most other substances.      Now, imagine stuffing up your nose something that is larger than your nostril opening and designed not to break. That would be as foolish as, well, trying to inhale a condom. The condom could easily get stuck in your nose or your throat, blocking your breathing or causing you to choke.      But that's not all. Take a look at a case report published in 2004 in the Indian Journal of Chest Diseases and Allied Sciences entitled \\"Accidental condom inhalation,\\" which distinguishes it from deliberate condom inhalation, which is basically the \\"Condom Snorting Challenge.\\" The case report detailed the tribulations of a 27-year-old woman who performed oral sex on a man wearing a condom. The condom went down her trachea and into her lungs, blocked one of her airways, and resulted in pneumonia and a collapse of the right upper lobe of her lung. That would qualify as a bad oral sex experience.      Then there's the case report in the Journal of Medical Case Reports of a 26-year old woman who accidentally swallowed a condom (again, with the emphasis on the word accidentally) during oral sex and then subsequently developed appendicitis because a fragment of the condom lodged inside her appendix. While this does not necessarily mean that you should panic if you accidentally swallow a condom (because you may just eventually poop it out), it does strongly suggest that you should not deliberately inhale or swallow a condom.      Even if you manage to successfully pull the condom out through your mouth, inhaling a condom up your nose would be very uncomfortable and potentially quite painful. Would it really be worth all that just to get more likes and views?      Apparently enough teens still think it's worthwhile, to the point that educators are now visiting San Antonio, Texas-area schools to discuss drug, alcohol, and condom-snorting prevention, as Darian Trotter for NBC News 4 San Antonio reported. Welcome to 2018. Who knew that teens would need to be told not to use condoms? ||||| Snorting a condom to pull it out from the throat as a fad has been around for a while, but parents are now being warned about it.      Teens are constantly finding new ways of putting rubber to use and one trending fad is also giving parents sleepless nights: condom snorting.      Parents in San Antonio, Texas, are learning through education classes that an increasing number of teens are looking up the “condom challenge.” Contrary to what the challenge may suggest, it is not about using the prophylactic for intended purposes. Instead, teens are challenged to snort an unused condom through a nostril only to pull it out from the mouth, while being filmed, a local Fox News affiliate reports.      In the San Antonio class, Stephen Enriquez, one of the educators, is telling parents of school-aged children that psychotropic substances are not the only thing they need to fear.      “These days our teens are doing everything for likes, views, and subscribers. As graphic as it is, we have to show parents because teens are going online looking for challenges and recreating them.”      The use of condoms in pranks and challenges is not new. After the Ice Bucket Challenge gained popularity, new ways to drop water on heads were tried and condom challenges became a craze. Amidst growing concerns of safety, health experts warned about risk of suffocation when a water-filled condom wraps around the head. Soon after, it appears, videos of attempts to snort and extract condoms from the throat started garnering attention.      The Newest Teen Challenge: Snorting Condoms https://t.co/rUcT8FCaFp pic.twitter.com/8tORmcW3Za — News 19 WLTX (@WLTX) April 1, 2018      Besides the unpleasant feeling one is likely to experience when sensitive nasal passages are lined with chemicals a condom contains, including glycerin and spermicide, infections and allergic reactions are likely. More importantly, snorting a condom, which is designed not to break, becomes a choking hazard if it blocks the airway.      While choking or a fatality has not been caught on tape, a few patient case studies reported in medical literature indicate what a condom that enters the respiratory tract can do. Condoms entering the digestive tract, including appendix, cause sickness, and have been reported more often.      In 2004, researchers in India described the troubles of a 27-year-old who accidentally inhaled a condom while performing oral sex. The object was later located and removed with a bronchoscope.      “The lady presented with persistent cough, sputum and fever for the preceding six months. Trials with antibiotics and anti-tuberculosis treatment for the preceding four months did not improve symptoms. A subsequent chest radiograph showed non-homogeneous collapse-consolidation of right upper lobe.”      Forbes contributor Bruce Y. Lee mentions a YouTube video from 2007 that reportedly demonstrated the act. But it may not have been until 2013 when the condom snorting challenge began gaining traction. Clearly, the condom challenge is not new, and is likely to stay. ||||| The year 1735 saw the first appendicectomy, which was performed on an 11-year-old boy at St. Georgeâ€™s Hospital in London by Claudius Amyand during which a sewing pin was found to have perforated the appendix [6]. FBs in the appendix are uncommon but well described with an estimated prevalence of 0.0005 % [7, 8]. FBs generally do not cause any complications and pass through the gastrointestinal tract (GIT) spontaneously within a week. The complication rate of ingested FBs is estimated at less than 1 % [8].      Various objects acting as FBs have been reported in the literature to be the cause of acute appendicitis, including bird shot, bullets, fishing lines, screws, coins, stones, toothbrush bristle, pins, needles, teeth, bone fragments, dog hair, fruit seeds and pits, toothpicks, drill bits, tongue studs, crown post, keys and intrauterine contraceptive devices [3, 4, 7â€“11]. Considering the dependent position of the cecum and to some extent its low motility, such FBs tend to gravitate and settle there. In addition, the chance of entry to the appendiceal lumen is determined not only by its orifice (which might be tight or widely open) but also by the anatomic position of the appendix. There is almost no possibility for a FB to enter the lumen of a retrocecal appendix [8]. Once the FB is lodged in the appendix, peristaltic motion is usually insufficient to expel it back into the cecal lumen. It may remain immobile in the appendix without stimulating an inflammatory process or cause an inflammatory reaction with or without perforation. The period of latency between ingestion of the FB and the onset of symptoms varies from hours to years [4, 9, 11]. Complications usually depend on the size and shape of the FB. Blunt FBs cause appendicitis through obstruction of the appendiceal lumen and remain dormant for longer periods. Elongated sharp FBs are more likely to cause perforations, appendicular abscesses, and peritonitis [4, 8â€“10].      In our case, there was no history suggestive of FB ingestion during clinical evaluation. However, following retrieval of the condom fragment from the patientâ€™s appendix and its presentation to the patient postoperatively, she could recall having performed oral sex on her boyfriend 2 weeks prior to the onset of symptoms. She reported that the condom had loosened during the act and she accidentally ingested it. She however did not find it necessary to inform us as she did not think it was the cause of her symptoms because she had passed out fragments of the ingested condom in her feces 5 days after ingestion. It is likely that during its migration in the GIT the condom was torn into fragments and a piece was trapped within the vermiform appendix and the rest expelled in fecal matter. Arya et al. [12] had reported a case where multiple pieces of a condom were retrieved from the bronchus of a 27-year-old Indian woman. As in the present case report, she inhaled the condom during oral sex.      Apart from accidental ingestion of a condom during oral sex, it is important to note that the act is also associated with several other complications including a significant risk of transmission of human immunodeficiency virus, syphilis, herpes, chlamydia, hepatitis viruses, gonorrhea, and human papilloma virus infections [13].      There is a need to increase awareness of the potential dangers of ingested FBs. Each time such incidents occur, it is advisable patients report promptly for proper evaluation and follow-up until the FB is properly traced as it may account for significant morbidity and mortality. ||||| Another internet challenge has some parents on alert and just about everyone's eyebrows standing straight up.      Viral video on YouTube has been circulating and shared thousands of times, showing teenagers and young adults snorting condoms.      There is a fine line between bravery and stupidity, but the line isn't so fine when people snort condoms.      Internet challenges rule the world wide web but long gone are the days of milk-chugging and spoonfuls of cinnamon.      The Tide pod challenge brought millions to a halt, the Carolina reaper challenge seemed to affect anyone who tried the spicy pepper, but the condom challenge is different because of the tool employed.      \\"It's all about progress; this is better than eating tide pods,\\" said one man.      \\"It's crazy and dangerous, and parents should be quite alarmed to learn this is the new phenomenon,\\" one father told NBC Charlotte.      All of these challenges are done to garner likes, clicks, and attention.

Question: What language does Sindhu translate Tyagaraja keerthanam to? Movie plot title: Sindhu Bhairavi Movie plot: J.K. Balaganapathy (Sivakumar), popularly known as JKB, is a gifted carnatic musician but his wife Bhairavi (Sulakshana), despite her love and loyalty, fails to satisfy or challenge him intellectually. For JKB, this, and her inability to have children, is a problem. Gajapathi (Janagaraj) works for JKB as a tambura musician, and he is a compulsive liar. The film starts with an introduction of all characters of the film followed by JKB going to a concert where he finds Gurumoorthy (Delhi Ganesh), who works for JKB as a Mridangam musician, drunk. He instructs Gurumoorthy to leave the premises and performs in the concert without the use of Mridangam which is considered a basic/compulsory instrument to perform a carnatic concert. When Gurumoorthy is asked to permanently leave the band, he promises not to drink again. While Bhairavi's grandfather is going to receive his pension, which he does on the first of every month, Gajapathi lies to him that his pension has been cancelled. The old man starts crying and JKB intervenes to confirm that his pension is not canceled and that he can go and collect it. JKB then scolds Gajapathi for it and tells him the old man could have died on hearing such a lies, as he is very particular about his pension. Following this, when JKB finds out that Gajapathi has lied to him too and others causing problems he asks him to promise to speak the truth. Sindhu (Suhasini), working as a music teacher in a school, attends one of the concerts of JKB, where he is performing a Tyagaraja keerthanam which is in Telugu Language and she finds some the audience speaking to each other instead of listening to the music. Hence, she asks JKB to translate the song he is singing into Tamil, which everybody in the audience can understand. He then gets angry and challenges her to demonstrate.

The incident occurs during one of the concerts of J.K. Balaganapathy (JKB), a gifted carnatic musician, where Sindhu is part of the audience. In the event, JKB is performing a Tyagaraja keerthanam in Telugu, a language that not everyone in the crowd understands. Sindhu notices this language barrier and sees audience members talking amongst themselves instead of immersing in the performance. Determined to make it more enjoyable and meaningful for everyone, she approaches JKB and asks him to translate the keethanam to Tamil, a language that would be understood by the entire audience. This request angers JKB but also throws down a challenge to Sindhu to do the translation herself, in front of the audience. Sindhu accepts this challenge and indeed succeeds in demonstrating the translation of the Telugu keerthanam into Tamil right at the spot.  Her successful translation not only earns the applause of the crowd but also makes JKB acknowledge her talent and deep understanding of music. He is amazed to know her intellectual capacity and appreciates her abilities. Thus, Sindhu's act of translation bridged the linguistic gap and enhanced the concert, and she thus paved her way into JKB's admiration and respect. Therefore, in summary, Sindhu translates the Tyagaraja keerthanam from Telugu to Tamil during a concert performed by J.K. Balaganapathy (JKB), surpassing his expectations and impressing the audience and JKB himself."},{"instruction":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation. Think like you are answering to a five year old. News article: The Senate took a key step Tuesday toward ratifying a new nuclear arms reduction treaty with Russia, voting 67 to 28 to end debate on the matter and proceed to a final vote.      The \\"cloture\\" vote indicated that the New Strategic Arms Reduction Treaty (START), one of the Obama administration's highest priorities, is all but certain to be ratified when the Senate holds a final vote, expected as soon as Wednesday.      \\"This treaty will make America safer and restore our leadership in global efforts to stop nuclear proliferation,\\" Senate Majority Leader Harry M. Reid (D-Nev.) said in a statement after the vote. He said he was \\"encouraged\\" by Republican support for the treaty and expressed hope that \\"when the Senate votes tomorrow on ratification, we will send a powerful statement about America's commitment to nonproliferation with a strong bipartisan vote.\\"      Tuesday's crucial vote advancing the treaty came after several Republican senators publicly declared their support, apparently putting the pact over the top despite the objections of the Senate's top two GOP leaders and the bulk of their caucus. The Republican declarations of support followed intense last-minute efforts by administration officials, senior military leaders and other advocates of the pact to ensure its passage on grounds that it enhances U.S. national security and nonproliferation interests.      Adm. Mike Mullen, the nation's top military officer, and Secretary of Defense Robert M. Gates appealed to the Senate to approve the treaty.      In floor speeches before Tuesday's vote, two Republicans from Tennessee - Sen. Lamar Alexander, the third-ranking GOP leader in the chamber, and Bob Corker - announced their support for the pact.      Sen. Lisa Murkowski (R-Alaska) issued a statement declaring her backing for ratification, and Sen. George V. Voinovich (R-Ohio) gave a floor speech reaffirming that he would vote for the pact.      Alexander and Corker were the eighth and ninth Republicans to publicly commit to voting for the treaty, but several others had said they are leaning toward doing so. The pact needed at least nine Republican votes to reach the two-thirds threshold necessary for passage.      The cloture vote was considered critical as an indicator of sufficient support for final passage.      While the White House had expected Alexander to back the treaty, he had sounded less certain in recent days, as Republicans lashed out at the administration for pushing ratification in the waning days of the lame-duck session. In a speech on the Senate floor Tuesday, Alexander made his support public for the first time.      \\"I will vote to ratify the New START Treaty . . . because it leaves our country with enough nuclear warheads to blow any attacker to kingdom come,\\" Alexander said. \\"I'm convinced that Americans are safer and more secure with the New START Treaty than without it.\\" Alexander also pointed out that Obama had committed to spending about 85 billion on modernizing America's nuclear complex over the next 10 years, a 14 billion increase over what otherwise might have been spent.      Corker said later, \\"I firmly believe that signing this treaty, that ratifying this treaty . . . is in our country's national interest.\\" ||||| “Today’s bipartisan vote clears a significant hurdle in the Senate,” said Senator John Kerry of Massachusetts , the Democratic chairman of the Foreign Relations Committee, and the president’s chief ally on the floor. “We are on the brink of writing the next chapter in the 40-year history of wrestling with the threat of nuclear weapons .”      Republican critics called it a bad deal, arguing that the treaty’s inspections were inadequate and that nonbinding language in its preamble could give Russia leverage to try to keep the United States from deploying missile defense installations in Eastern Europe.      Photo      “The administration did not negotiate a good treaty,” said Senator Jon Kyl of Arizona , the No. 2 Republican and the leader of the opposition. “They went into negotiations, it seems to me, with the attitude with the Russians just like the guy that goes into the car dealership and says, ‘I’m not leaving here until I buy a car.’ ”      The treaty requires the United States and Russia to reduce their nuclear stockpiles so that within seven years of ratification neither deploys more than 1,550 strategic warheads and 700 launchers. It would also resume the on-site inspections that lapsed last December with the expiration of the original Strategic Arms Reduction Treaty , or Start.      The agreement brings down the legal ceilings set by previous Russian-American treaties that it would now supplant. Under the Treaty of Moscow , signed by President George W. Bush in 2002, each side is allowed no more than 2,200 warheads as of 2012. Under Start, signed by President George H. W. Bush in 1991, each side was required to reduce launchers to 1,600 before it expired last year.      The United States currently has 1,950 deployed strategic warheads and 798 deployed launchers, according to the Federation of American Scientists, while Russia has 2,540 deployed strategic warheads and 574 strategic launchers. Because of counting rules, each side may not have to shelve as many weapons as those numbers imply, according to experts.      The debate over the treaty, however, ranged far beyond the numbers, revealing starkly different visions for national security in the 21st century. Mr. Obama and his supporters argued that ratification was essential to rebuilding a relationship with Russia and maintaining the international coalition against Iran’s nuclear program . His critics said it represented a first step toward a dangerous and wrong-headed vision of eventually eliminating the world’s nuclear weapons.      Advertisement Continue reading the main story      It also became entangled in issues like gay men and lesbians in the military, which some Republicans said poisoned the water for the treaty. And some critics questioned Mr. Obama’s willingness as commander in chief to resist Russian pressure to drop missile defense to preserve the pact down the road.      “I cannot imagine this president taking it to the limit with the Russians because nothing he has done has convinced me that he is committed to missile defense,” said Senator Lindsey Graham , Republican of South Carolina , who added that it was “a monumental mistake” to approve the treaty in a lame-duck session.      Photo      But the White House cast Mr. Obama in the shadow of President Ronald Reagan , who also talked of ridding the world of nuclear weapons. “Our reductions in these are legacies of many presidents, including former President Ronald Reagan,” said Robert Gibbs , the White House press secretary. “And it makes the world safer.”      Mr. Obama enlisted the elder Mr. Bush, former Republican secretaries of state, the nation’s military commanders and Eastern European leaders to knock down objections. Every time a Republican needed assurance about missile defense, verification or nuclear modernization, supporters produced letters or statements from prominent figures.      In a final such letter to several senators, released Tuesday, Mr. Obama repeated his commitment to a 10-year, 85 billion program to modernize the nation’s nuclear weapons complex to ensure that a shrinking nuclear arsenal would still be effective. “My administration will pursue these programs and capabilities for as long as I am president,” he wrote.

Biden Jr. and Secretary of State Hillary Rodham Clinton on Capitol Hill, the reassurances won over Republicans like Senators Lamar Alexander and Bob Corker of Tennessee , Lisa Murkowski of Alaska and Johnny Isakson of Georgia , all of whom announced their support just before Tuesday’s vote.      “I’m convinced that America is safer and more secure with the New Start treaty than without it,” said Mr. Alexander, who just last week voted to block consideration of the pact on the floor. He cited Mr. Obama’s modernization letter and added that the treaty still left the United States with “enough nuclear warheads to blow any attacker to kingdom come.”      Other Republicans who voted to advance the treaty on Tuesday were Senators Robert F. Bennett of Utah , Scott P. Brown of Massachusetts, Thad Cochran of Mississippi , Susan Collins of Maine , Richard G. Lugar of Indiana , Olympia J. Snowe of Maine and George V. Voinovich of Ohio .      The vote cleared the way for a final vote, although senators discussed a number of Republican amendments late into the night. Mr. Kerry accepted two Republican-sponsored side statements that called for modernizing nuclear delivery systems and opening new talks with Russia to reduce tactical nuclear weapons.

Originally named Warsaw, the band consisted of singer-songwriter Ian Curtis, guitarist and keyboardist Bernard Sumner, bass player Peter Hook and drummer Stephen Morris. The band was formed by Sumner and Hook after attending a 4 June 1976 Sex Pistols concert at the Lesser Free Trade Hall in Manchester. While Joy Division's early recordings were heavily influenced by early punk, they evolved a unique sound, aided by producer Martin Hannett, which earned their reputation as pioneers of the post-punk movement. On 20 July 1976, childhood friends Sumner and Hook separately attended a Sex Pistols show at the Manchester Lesser Free Trade Hall. Both were was inspired by the Pistol's performance. The following day Hook borrowed PS35 from his mother to buy a bass guitar. Sumner said that he felt that they \\"destroyed the myth of being a pop star, of a musician being some kind of god that you had to worship\\". They formed a band with Terry Mason, who had also attended the gig. Sumner bought a guitar, and Mason a drum kit. They invited schoolfriend Martin Gresty to join as vocalist, but he turned them down after getting a job at a local factory. An advertisement was placed in the Virgin Records shop in Manchester for a vocalist. Ian Curtis, who knew them from earlier gigs, responded and was hired without audition. Sumner said that he \\"knew he was all right to get on with and that's what we based the whole group on. If we liked someone, they were in\\".  Buzzcocks manager Richard Boon and frontman Pete Shelley have both been credited with suggesting the band name \\"Stiff Kittens\\", but settled on \\"Warsaw\\" shortly before their first gig, referencing David Bowie's song \\"Warszawa\\". Warsaw debuted on 29 May 1977 at the Electric Circus, supporting the Buzzcocks, Penetration and John Cooper Clarke. They received immediate national exposure due to reviews of the gig in the NME by Paul Morley and in Sounds by Ian Wood. Tony Tabac played drums that night after joining the band two days earlier. Mason was soon made the band's manager and Tabac was replaced on drums in June 1977 by Steve Brotherdale, who also played in the punk band Panik. During his tenure with Warsaw, Brotherdale tried to get Curtis to leave the band and join Panik and even got Curtis to audition for the band. In July 1977, Warsaw recorded a set of five demo tracks at Pennine Sound Studios, Oldham. Uneasy with Brotherdale's aggressive personality, the band fired him soon after the demo sessions. Driving home from the studio, they pulled over and asked Brotherdale to check on a flat tyre; when he got out of the car, they sped off.  In August 1977, the band placed an advertisement in a music shop window seeking a replacement drummer. Stephen Morris, who had attended the same school as Curtis, was the sole respondent. Deborah Curtis, Ian's wife, stated that Morris \\"fitted perfectly\\" with the other men, and that with his addition Warsaw became a \\"complete 'family'\\". To avoid confusion with the London punk band Warsaw Pakt, the band renamed themselves Joy Division in early 1978, borrowing their new name from the sexual slavery wing of a Nazi concentration camp mentioned in the 1955 novel House of Dolls. In December, the group recorded what became their debut EP, An Ideal for Living, at Pennine Sound Studio and played their final gig as Warsaw on New Year's Eve at The Swinging Apple in Liverpool. Billed as Warsaw to ensure an audience, the band played their first gig as Joy Division on 25 January 1978 at Pip's Disco in Manchester. Using a quote from the above article, answer the following question: How did that turn out?","output":"Joy Division was formed after Sumner and Hook attended a Sex Pistols concert and got inspired. They found other members, played their first gig as Warsaw, and eventually changed their name to Joy Division. They developed a unique sound and became pioneers of the post-punk movement.

Q:Question: \\"What happened in the 7th year of the 2000s?\\"  Context: \\"On December 20, 2005, the United States Court of Appeals for the Sixth Circuit ruled in the case of ACLU v. Mercer County that the continued display of the Ten Commandments as part of a larger display on American legal traditions in a Kentucky courthouse was allowed, because the purpose of the display (educating the public on American legal traditions) was secular in nature. In ruling on the Mount Soledad cross controversy on May 3, 2006, however, a federal judge ruled that the cross on public property on Mount Soledad must be removed.\\"  Answer: A:","output":"The seventh year of the 2000s was 2007, and it witnessed several notable events and developments around the world. In the context of the previous legal rulings, 2007 was also an important year for court decisions and legislation in the United States. Below is an overview of some significant events in 2007, with a focus on American legal developments: 1. Virginia Tech Shooting: On April 16, 2007, one of the deadliest mass shootings in U.S. history took place at the Virginia Polytechnic Institute and State University in Blacksburg, Virginia. The shooter, Seung-Hui Cho, killed 32 people and wounded 17 others before taking his own life. 2. The U.S. Attorney Dismissal Controversy: Controversy arose in 2007 when the Department of Justice, under Attorney General Alberto Gonzales, fired nine United States Attorneys. Critics argued that these dismissals were politically motivated, which led to hearings, investigations, and the subsequent resignation of Gonzales on September 17, 2007. 3. Legalization of Same-Sex Civil Unions: In May 2007, the state of New Hampshire became the fourth state in the United States to legalize same-sex civil unions, granting same-sex couples the same legal rights as heterosexual couples. 4. Partial-Birth Abortion Ban Upheld: On April 18, 2007, in Gonzales v. Carhart and Gonzales v. Planned Parenthood, the U.S. Supreme Court upheld the nationwide ban on partial-birth abortion (also known as intact dilation and extraction). This marked the first time the Court had allowed a limitation on abortion with no exception for preserving the health of the woman, sparking ongoing debates about reproductive rights. 5. Iraq War Surge: President George W. Bush announced a new strategy for the Iraq War, known as \\"The New Way Forward,\\" in January 2007. The plan included sending an additional 20,000 U.S. troops to bring stability to the country and renew efforts in rebuilding its infrastructure. 6. Jena Six Incident: Racial tensions erupted in Jena, Louisiana, after six African American high school students, known as the Jena Six, were charged with attempted murder for assaulting a white student in December 2006. The case gained national attention, and the severity of the charges faced by the students led to protests, drawing thousands of demonstrators in September 2007. 7. iPhone Launch: On June 29, 2007, Apple released its first iPhone, changing the landscape of mobile phone technology and leading to the widespread adoption of smartphones worldwide. These are just a few of the significant events that took place in 2007. While these events are not directly related to the Ten Commandments or Mount Soledad cross controversy, they illustrate the diverse range of social, political, and technological developments that occurred during the seventh year of the 2000s. In terms of legal expansion and awareness, these events had significant impacts on American culture, law, and the broader global landscape."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Solve -20*l - 106*l = 1134 for l.","output":"To solve the given equation, -20*l - 106*l = 1134 for l, we will follow the below steps: Step 1: Combine like terms  Both terms on the left-hand side of the equation have the variable 'l', so we can combine those terms. -20*l - 106*l = -126*l So, our simplified equation is -126*l = 1134. Step 2: Solve for l Now, we need to isolate the variable 'l' by dividing both sides of the equation by -126. -126*l = 1134 => l = 1134 / -126 Now, we will find the simplified fraction for 1134/-126. Both 1134 and -126 have a factor of 2 in common: So, 1134 ÷ 2 = 567 and -126 ÷ 2 = -63 So our simplified fraction is: l = 567/-63 Step 3: Simplify the fraction Now, the fraction 567 / -63 can be further simplified as both numbers have a factor of 9 in common. 567 ÷ 9 = 63 and -63 ÷ 9 = -7 So, our solution for l is: l = 63 / -7 => l = -9 Thus, the value of 'l' for the given equation -20*l - 106*l = 1134 is l = -9."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Does \\"Kin-selective altruism has made its way into Nigerian politics, resulting in tribalist efforts to concentrate Federal power to a particular region of their interests.\\" correctly answer the question of When did Nigeria get independence?","output":"No, the statement \\"Kin-selective altruism has made its way into Nigerian politics, resulting in tribalist efforts to concentrate Federal power to a particular region of their interests\\" does not correctly answer the question of when Nigeria gained independence. The statement discusses the presence of tribalism and regionalism in Nigerian politics, but it does not provide any information about the country's independence.  To answer the question, Nigeria gained independence from British rule on October 1, 1960. This date is celebrated annually as Nigeria's Independence Day, marking the end of colonial rule and the beginning of self-governance. The country was initially a British protectorate in the late 19th century and then was later merged with the British colony of Lagos to form the Colony and Protectorate of Nigeria in 1914. The process of gaining independence in Nigeria was a gradual one, involving negotiations and constitutional reforms by various Nigerian political leaders, such as Nnamdi Azikiwe, Obafemi Awolowo, and Sir Ahmadu Bello, with the British government. Various political parties were formed with the aim of achieving self-governance, and the movement intensified after World War II. In 1946, the Richards Constitution was introduced, bringing about regionalization and laying the groundwork for political representation. This was followed by the Macpherson Constitution in 1951, which established the Central Legislative Council and allowed for greater political representation. The Lyttleton Constitution came into force in 1954, furthering the autonomy of Nigeria's regions while maintaining a federal structure. Finally, in 1959, the Nigerian general elections took place, resulting in the formation of a coalition government under the leadership of prime minister Sir Abubakar Tafawa Balewa. Nigeria subsequently became fully independent on October 1, 1960, with Nnamdi Azikiwe appointed as Governor-General (and later President, when Nigeria became a republic in 1963). While the original statement does not answer the question of when Nigeria gained independence, it does touch upon the ethno-political complexities that continue to shape Nigerian politics today. The country has more than 250 ethnic groups, with the main groups being the Hausa-Fulani, Yoruba, and Igbo. This diversity, combined with regional economic imbalances, has contributed to power struggles and calls for regional autonomy, which can, at times, exacerbate tribal tensions in Nigerian politics."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

You will be given a task. You must generate a detailed and long answer. I'm taking a test and have to guess the right answer to the question after the article. Article: Publicity  offers several benefits. There are no costs for message time or space. An ad in prime-time television may cost 250,000 to 5,000,000 or more per minute, whereas a five-minute report on a network newscast would not cost anything. Publicity reaches a mass audience within a short time and new products or company policies are widely known. Credibility about messages is high, because they are reported in independent media. A newspaper review of a movie has more believability than an ad in the same paper, because the reader associates independence with objectivity. Similarly, people are more likely to pay attention to news reports than to ads. For example, Women's Wear Daily has both fashion reports and advertisements. Readers spend time reading the stories, but they skim through the ads. Furthermore, there may be 10 commercials during a half-hour television program or hundreds of ads in a magazine. Feature stories are much fewer in number and stand out clearly. Publicity also has some significant limitations. A firm has little control over messages, their timing, their placement, or their coverage by a given medium. It may issue detailed news releases and find only portions mentioned by the media, and media have the ability to be much more critical than a firm would like. For example, in 1982, Procter & Gamble faced a massive publicity problem over the meaning of its 123-year-old company logo. To fight this negative publicity, the firm had a spokesperson appear on Good Morning America to disprove the rumor  . The false rumors were temporarily put to rest. However, in 1985, publicity became so troublemaking that Procter & Gamble decided to remove the logo from its products.

The outcome of the elections could have a profound impact on U.S. President Donald Trump as well, and the president is starting to take notice. At a recent campaign-style rally in Washington, Michigan, Trump turned up the heat on opposition Democrats: \\"A vote for a Democrat in November is a vote for open borders and crime. It's very simple,\\" he said. Opinion polls give Democrats an edge looking ahead to the balloting in November, and Trump is trying to get his supporters excited about turning out at the polls. \\"You know what it is? You get complacent,\\" he said. \\"We cannot be complacent. We have to go out, right?\\" The president also told supporters not to pay attention to Democrats who insist they have the House all but won in November. \\"We've got to go out and we've got to fight like hell and we have got to win the House and win the Senate,\\" Trump told the audience. \\"And I think we are going to do great in the Senate and I think we are going to do great in the House because the economy is so good.\\" According to the website RealClearPolitics, the Democrats enjoy a generic ballot advantage of nearly 7 percentage points over the Republicans looking ahead to November. RealClearPolitics averaged several recent polls and found that 45.6 percent of those surveyed said they would support Democratic congressional candidates in November, compared with 38.9 percent who said they would vote for Republicans. Analysts see the generic ballot as a key indicator of party strength heading into the midterms.

Trump's approval has recently averaged about 41 percent. According to the above context, answer the following question. Why did Donald Trump ask his supporters to not pay attention to Democrats?

Write highlights for this article: Authorities say a 37-year-old man was drunk when he crashed his car into a Syracuse-area home, setting off a fire that destroyed the house. The Onondaga County Sheriff's Office says Brian Aust of the town of Clay was driving on Route 31 around 1 a.m. Wednesday when he lost control of his car and hit a vehicle parked in a driveway in his hometown. Deputies say his car then hit the house, striking a natural gas line and sparking a fire that spread to his vehicle and the home. Bad day: Clay, New York resident Brian Aust was allegedly drunk Wednesday morning when he careened off the road after hitting a mailbox and then a parked car. He then smashed into a home, which ignited a gas line and set the home and the car on fire. According to Syracuse.com, Aust first over-corrected after smashing into a roadside mailbox. His Hyundai Elantra then swerved to the opposite side of the road and collided with a parked car. The collision sent his car careening into the home and a gas light was ignited. The home, as well as Aust's Elantra, went up in flames. The homeowner and another family member pulled Austin from his burning car before it became fully engulfed. Deputies say the family has been left homeless. It was a 'complete loss' Onondaga County Detective Jon Seeber said. Aust suffered only minor injuries to his face. He was taken to a hospital by ambulance. He's charged with driving while intoxicated, felony first-degree aggravated unlicensed operation, imprudent speed and failure to keep right. It couldn't be determined if he has a lawyer. 'Complete loss': Officials say the home was a total loss and that the residents have been left homeless.

Bio: yi ui-bang -lrb- , died december 1174 -rrb- was a military ruler of korea during the goryeo period .","output":"From the given bio, we can gather several details about Yi Ui-bang: 1. Full name and identity: Yi Ui-bang is the full name of the individual in question. He was a Korean historical figure. 2. Time period: Yi Ui-bang lived during the Goryeo period in Korea. The Goryeo period spanned from 918 to 1392, which allows us to place his contributions within a broader historical context. 3. Date of death: Yi Ui-bang died in December 1174. This fact allows us to further refine our understanding of his life and the events that took place during his lifetime. 4. Occupation: Yi Ui-bang was a military ruler of Korea, indicating that he held a significant position of power and influence, specifically within the realm of military affairs. This suggests that he was involved in organizing and directing the armed forces of Korea during his rule. 5. Nature of rule: The bio describes Yi Ui-bang as a \\"military ruler\\" instead of using a more general term like \\"king\\" or \\"emperor.\\" This suggests that his rule was primarily centered on military matters rather than civil administration or other aspects of governance. 6. Significance: The inclusion of Yi Ui-bang in a bio suggests that he is a historically significant figure, whether for his achievements as a military ruler or for other contributions to Korean society during the Goryeo period. While the bio provides some important details about Yi Ui-bang, it leaves out other key pieces of information. Further research would be needed to learn more about his early life, the specific circumstances that led to him becoming a military ruler, his contributions to military strategy and tactics, his relationships with other significant figures of the time, and any major events or battles that occurred during his rule. Additionally, understanding more about the political, social, and cultural climate during the Goryeo period would provide valuable context to Yi Ui-bang's actions and decisions as a military ruler."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

That's all that's needed to force a wide-ranging House debate — and votes — on border security and the immigration status of 700,000 undocumented young people brought to the U.S. as children. Since moderate Republicans opposed House leadership two weeks ago with a rare discharge petition to force a so-called \\"queen of the hill\\" debate (House rule based on the most votes) on immigration, the measure has steadily accumulated support within their own party. The petition needs 218 signatures to start that debate and — with the assumption that all 193 House Democrats will sign on — Republicans need just two more signatures. But that effort now goes on hold as Congress leaves town for an 11-day holiday recess, giving all sides breathing room to figure out what comes next. Many of the 23 Republican signers of the petition face tough re-election races in their districts this November.

You will be given a task. You must generate a detailed and long answer. Various stages of the life cycle of a source program with a neat diagram.? Explain the various stages of the life cycle of a source program with a neat diagram.? Do those questions have the same meaning?","output":"Yes, both questions essentially have the same meaning. Both are asking for an explanation of the various stages of the life cycle of a source program, preferably accompanied by a diagram. Here's a detailed explanation of the various stages of a source program's life cycle. **1. Edit**: This is the first stage of the lifecycle. Here, the program code is written or modified using a text editor or an Integrated Development Environment (IDE). In an IDE, you can write your code, compile it and run it all in one place. It’s generally a more user-friendly way to write code than is a simple text editor. **2. Preprocess**: This is the second stage of the lifecycle. Preprocessing happens immediately after editing and before compilation. During this stage, the preprocessor, a part of the compiler, takes a source code file and deals with the directives, like #include and #define. These directives order the inclusion of particular files and substitution of tokens in the source code file. **3. Compile**: The next stage is compilation. The source code is translated into assembly code by the compiler. The compiler checks the code for syntactic and semantic errors. If it finds any errors, it will show these errors in a list. You have to debug these errors before you can move on. **4. Assemble**: After the code has been successfully compiled and is error-free, it is then assembled. The assembly code is converted into the object (machine) code. **5. Link**: The code is then linked. All individual blocks of the program that have been compiled and assembled separately are combined together to form a single program. The linker also adds other code necessary for the execution of the program. **6. Load**: The last stage is loading. This is where the linking code is loaded into the memory for execution. This stage also involves dynamic relocation and linking if necessary. **7. Execute**: Finally, the source code, which has been translated into a program, is executed by the computer's central processing unit (CPU).  Please note that modern IDE’s can automate most of these steps, allowing developers to go directly from the Edit stage to the Execute stage, seamlessly.  This lifecycle is typically depicted in a flowing, left-to-right diagram that clearly illustrates the transition from one phase to the next. Here is a textual representation of a diagram, due to the limitations of text-based communication. \`\`\` Edit -> Preprocess -> Compile -> Assemble -> Link -> Load -> Execute \`\`\` Starting from the left, you move to the right, going through each stage. If errors are encountered during the Compile, Assemble, or Link stage, you go back to the Edit stage to correct your code. Once your code is Load-ed into the memory, it can be Executed and thus, the lifecycle is completed."},{"instruction":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

The village is attacked by dragons, who steal food (mostly sheep) and set things on fire (hence all the new buildings). The villagers grab weapons and try to fight the dragons off.

The dragon lands in the woods some distance form the village and no one believes that he hit anything, so it's the next day before Hiccup can go looking for it. It turns out to be a rare and deadly Night Fury, but Hiccup can't make himself kill it. Instead he releases it -- whereupon it also refrains from killing Hiccup -- and it flies off through the trees.Hiccup discovers that the dragon (which he eventually calls Toothless because of its retractable teeth) has holed up in a steep-sided valley because it can no longer fly more than a few feet at a time. While sketching the dragon, Hiccup realizes that it's missing a tail fin. He makes a prosthetic tail fin out of leather.

Luzzatti was born of Jewish parents in Venice on 11 March 1841. After completing his studies in law at the University of Padua, he attracted the attention of the Austrian police by his lectures on political economy, and was obliged to emigrate after starting a mutual aid society among gondoliers. In 1863 he obtained a professorship at the Milan Technical Institute; in 1867 he was appointed professor of constitutional law at Padua, whence he was transferred to the University of Rome. Gifted with eloquence and energy, he popularized the economic ideas of Franz Hermann Schulze-Delitzsch in Italy, worked for the establishment of a commercial college at Venice, and contributed to the spread of people's banks on a basis of limited liability throughout the country. He was minister of agriculture in the second Sonnino Cabinet (December 2, 1909 - March 21, 1910), and on the resignation of the latter was called upon to form a cabinet himself. His administration, which lasted until March 18, 1911, was not very successful and fell over a proposed electoral reform. Although a man of first-class financial ability, great honesty and wide culture, he had not the strength of character necessary to lead a government: he showed lack of energy in dealing with opposition and tried to avoid all measures likely to make him unpopular. Furthermore, he never realized that with the chamber, as it was then constituted, he only held office at Giolitti's good pleasure.  During the First World War, he was consistently pro-Ally and strongly supported Italian intervention, but his tone was on the whole pessimistic. Although he did not take office while the war lasted, he was always consulted on all financial matters, and his sound advice was generally followed.  He became treasury minister in the second incarnation of the Nitti cabinet (March 12 - May 10, 1920), but did not resume office in the third.

Summarize: Abdul (not his full name) suffered a hand injury. He says he escaped after a young Taliban fighter his own age intervened on his behalf. The Taliban have been accused by human rights group Amnesty International of killings and abuses following their capture of Kunduz, the northern city they held for several days last week before Afghan security forces moved in to drive them out. Abdul was on his way home to the northern province of Takhar, after spending his Eid holiday in Kabul. He wanted to return to his studies and ignored warnings the journey would be too dangerous, saying the authorities suggested they were back in control in Kunduz. The route from Kabul to Takhar goes through Kunduz and thousands of people have been stranded in the wake of the fighting. Abdul set off on Sunday, a week after Taliban insurgents took over Kunduz. It was the first time the group had captured a provincial capital since they were ousted from power in 2001. \\"When I took a car, the driver told me not to worry because he knew people with the Taliban,\\" Abdul told the BBC in the interview in Takhar. \\"Throughout the journey, the driver was talking to people who seemed to be Taliban on the phone and assured me that nothing would happen.\\" Abdul still appeared to be traumatised as he recounted what happened next, clutching his arm with his thumb in a thick bandage. He says that when the car entered Kunduz, he saw the Afghan flag on a roundabout but there was no one from the Afghan government in sight, The driver was supposed to take his passengers directly to Takhar - but instead dropped them off on the northern outskirts of the city, where they had to find another vehicle. It was on the way out of the city when Abdul got really worried as the area appeared to be under Taliban control. \\"From then onwards on the road to Takhar there were Talibs everywhere,\\" he recounted. \\"I saw dead bodies along the roadside. They smelled bad. Many looked no more than 20 years old.\\" After passing two roadblocks, the car was stopped and Taliban insurgents began to question the passengers. \\"They asked us what we were doing here, and I said I had been in Kabul for treatment because I was not feeling well.\\" The passengers were taken to a nearby hotel which the Taliban had made their base and where the questioning continued. Abdul, whose account cannot be independently verified, says he was kicked in the back twice and accused of working for the government. \\"I told them I wasn't, but however much I cried and shouted, they would not let me go.\\" He said there was a stream outside where the insurgent group appeared to have a killing ground. He says a man had been beheaded there. Such testimony chimes with a report by Amnesty International last week which spoke of \\"mass murder, gang rapes and house-to-house searches by Taliban death squads\\" in Kunduz, based on civilian accounts collected by the human rights watchdog from people fleeing the city. The Taliban by contrast sent out messages of reassurance, saying that civilians and their property would be respected and there was nothing to fear. Abdul's story contradicts this. He says he himself was then taken outside. \\"They dropped me there and put a knife to my neck. I tried to grab the knife and they cut my finger.\\" Abdul recounts how his friend started crying as soon as the Taliban produced the knife and shouted \\"Allahu Akbar\\" (\\"God is great\\"). It was then that one of the insurgents, a young man roughly Abdul's age, started to become emotional himself and intervened. \\"He asked me whether I had done anything wrong,\\" Abdul says. \\"I said: 'No.' I told them that I'd do whatever they wanted, that I would even join them because I was so scared.\\" For whatever reason, Abdul was spared and \\"told to go and not look back\\". He says his hand bled all the way to Takhar, where a doctor treated the wound with 10 stitches. \\"Whenever I see a knife now I feel faint,\\" he says. Abdul accuses the authorities of not telling the truth about the security situation in Kunduz. \\"My only advice to the government is: Don't lie, because people will misunderstand and think Kunduz is under control, and that could cost lives.\\" Summary:","output":"Abdul, a young man from the northern province of Takhar, suffered a hand injury after being stopped by Taliban insurgents while traveling through Kunduz.

It is likely that the substance's change from solid to liquid is what the question is referring to. - hollowness: This option refers to a lack of substance or emptiness inside something.

Context: Creating a self portrait is not your typical selfie! When I taught in the traditional classroom, creating self portraits was something I had students do whether they were four or nine. In fact, I’d have them draw one on the first day of school and one toward the end of the year and to see the change over time was always so interesting. At least once during the year, likely toward the beginning, I would center a lesson around self portraits. In younger classes, there would be more than one. Creating a self portrait teaches students to be aware of themselves. Where is her head in relation to her body? Where are her feet in relation to her legs? It also teaches children spatial awareness. Where should he begin…with his feet or with his head? Where on the paper should his head be placed? How far down should his arms go? How can his whole body fit on a single piece of paper? A Lesson on Creating Self Portraits Whether you are in a classroom, or teaching a child at home, here is a simple lesson on creating self portraits geared toward young children, anywhere from age 2 through age 6. Keep in mind that their final product will show various levels of writing development, depending on what stage of writing they are in. (Basically, a two-year-old’s drawing should look very different than that of a five-year-old.) The teacher will need to model how to draw a self portrait. Gather the children around an easel or board and clip a paper to it. Narrate the process as you walk through the steps. “I am going to draw a picture of myself. I am going to start with my head.” Use your hands to show your actual head on yourself so students are aware of what you talking about. The visuals also help English Language Learners (if you’re teaching in an English speaking classroom.) and build vocabulary for all students.

Wash the lemon: First, make sure to rinse the lemon under cold water to remove any dirt, wax, or pesticides that may be present on the surface. 2. Select the right tool: You can use a zester, grater, or a sharp knife (such as a paring knife or vegetable peeler) to remove the lemon peel. 3. Stabilize the lemon: Place the lemon on a cutting board or any flat surface that is slip-resistant. It's helpful to cut a small slice from the top and bottom of the lemon to create a flat surface on both ends for better stability. 4. Gripping the lemon: Hold the lemon firmly with one hand, making sure to have a good grip so that it doesn't move or slip while you're removing the peel. 5. Using the chosen tool: - If using a zester: Hold the zester's handle with the other hand and firmly press the zesting surface against the lemon, dragging it downwards in one continuous motion, removing the outer layer of the peel in thin strips. - If using a grater: Hold the grater by its handle and rub the lemon against the grater's surface, keeping the motion steady. Rotate the lemon as needed to remove the peel evenly. - If using a knife or vegetable peeler: Place the edge of the knife or peeler against the top of the lemon where a flat surface was created, and carefully slide it downwards under the peel, following the curvature of the lemon. Try to remove the peel in long strips while avoiding cutting too deep, as you only want to remove the outer layer (the colored part) and not the white pith underneath. 6. Rotate the lemon: As you remove the peel, rotate the lemon and repeat the process until the entire peel has been removed. 7. Clean up: If there are any small areas of the peel remaining, use the zester, grater, or knife to remove them as needed. 8. Use the lemon peel: Now that the lemon peel has been removed, you can chop it, grate it, or use it in various dishes or drinks as a garnish or flavor enhancer. By following these steps, you can successfully remove the peel from a lemon."},{"instruction":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

Please answer the following question: There was a boy named Chan who loved his parents, though they did not love him back; he was not even given a first name. He had been born in the wrong month, during the wrong phase of the moon, his parents told him, and had brought them nothing but bad luck. The promotion at the factory promised to his father was taken away at the last moment. The garden his mother worked in nearly every day never produced anything more than the most meager of weeds since Chan's birth. It was often sunny in the little Chinese village, but there was an almost constant gloom over their house, as if a rogue cloud were blocking the sun only over their property. And his parents, of course, blamed Chan for everything. He was small for his age, and usually quiet. He liked to listen to people instead of talking, filling himself with stories. He was a good boy and always did as he was told, and could see the good in his parents, even if others couldn't. Every so often, his mother would allow him a sweet, or his father would bring home an origami folding kit. They didn't like to show it to others, but his parents could be kind. Chan was patient and knew they would love him eventually. He was digging one day between the fence and the west side of the house for grubs to feed to his pet chameleon, Rainbow. It was a warm July day not long after his tenth birthday. He often went there because it was cool and damp from the shade of the trees, and the worms seemed to like it there. He never took more than he needed, then he thanked the grubs for sacrificing their lives so that Rainbow could remain living and being his pet. Chan was very kind-hearted when it came to grubs.

The British Raj was a time when Britain ruled over India, like a very big big sister telling her little brother what to do. Now, Nepal is a small country next to India. One day, the British and Nepal had a little fight called the Anglo-Nepalese War. The people of Nepal were great fighters and lived in big mountains which made it very hard for the British to win. So, after a while, they decided to become friends with Nepal instead of trying to make them listen to the British. They made a special friendship agreement called the Sugauli Treaty. Now, for the second question: 2. Why was Nepal not colonized by the British, like they did to India? Colonized means that a big strong country goes to a smaller country and starts ruling it. So, just like before, Britain tried to rule Nepal but found out it was very difficult because of the tough mountain people and the difficult land with lots of mountains. They decided it was better to stay friends with Nepal and signed that friendship agreement we talked about earlier, the Sugauli Treaty. Instead of ruling Nepal, they worked together. So, to answer your last question, yes, both questions are kind of asking the same thing. They both want to know why Britain didn't control Nepal like they did with India. And now you know, it's because the people in Nepal were such great fighters and their land was so difficult to fight in, so the British thought it was better to be friends with them."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Answer the following question: I heard that Aubrey conducted job interviews with 10 candidates. Aubrey was able to hire only 2 people. Aubrey shook hands with 8 unemployed workers respectively.  And I was wondering Why did Aubrey do this? Answer:","output":"To answer this question, let's think step by step: 1. Aubrey conducted job interviews with 10 candidates: It's clear that Aubrey needed to fill job positions and thus interviewed candidates to select the best fit. 2. Aubrey was able to hire only 2 people: This means that there were only 2 positions available, and after assessing the candidates, Aubrey found the 2 fitting those positions best. 3. Aubrey shook hands with 8 unemployed workers respectively: This means that after the interviews were over, Aubrey shook hands with the candidates who didn't receive an offer. Considering these steps, I can infer the reason:  Aubrey shook hands with the 8 unemployed workers as a sign of respect and gratitude for their time and effort during the interview process. It's a common courtesy to acknowledge the candidates, thank them for coming in, and wish them well in their job search, even if they didn't secure a position at the company.

It's Not Golf, But It's Getting There The game of golf has a lot to answer for: complex rules, white belts, high levels of frustration and profanity. But at least when you play, you're out in the elements, interacting with the natural world. \\"The mainstream golf world doesn't grasp the idea that there are a lot of rounds of golf being played indoors,\\" said Bill Bales, the founder and CEO of aboutGolf, one of several companies which design and manufacture golf simulators. \\"They don't count these rounds, but they're wearing golf shoes, using their clubs and balls, having a satisfying experience playing against each other and by themselves.\\" A simulator at Crosswoods Indoor Golf Center in Chandler, Ariz. last week; It was 109 degrees outside. Luke Donald is one of them. Currently ranked 10th in the Official World Golf Ranking, he lives in Chicago and put an aboutGolf simulator in his home a year ago. \\"I use it in the winter as a way to practice, simulate real golf and play some golf courses that we play on tour,\\" he says. \\"You can work the ball left to right and right to left and it's very accurate.\\" That's a pretty good endorsement, and there are other signs of success: the sims are big in Korea and other parts of the Far East, for example. There is a residential market for those who, like Tour pro Mr. Donald, can afford the 50,000-60,000 price tag. But Mr. Bales and his fellow entrepreneurs also have their eye on driving ranges, golf shops, teaching pros, recreational centers, and the occasional bar and grill. \\"I really think we can grow the game of golf beyond the circle of current golfers by creating this thing that is like the game outdoors, but you can do it at night, you can do it for an hour, you can do it without anyone behind you trying to hurry you along,\\" says Mr. Bales. Golf simulators have been around since the early 1970s. They were amusement park novelties, tucked in the back of a retail shop or in a forgotten corner of a golf center. Today, the technology has improved vastly. \\"The hardest thing to do is to convince someone who played in a sim 15 years ago to come and check it out,\\" said Ken Reynolds, whose company, EverGreens Golf, became an aboutGolf dealer after operating an indoor golf center. Those antediluvian machines featured grainy photos of a course projected onto a simple screen; you whacked a ball into the screen, a device measured the time it took for the ball to pass through two points, and after calculating and extrapolating, it told you your distance and transported you to your next location. Today's most advanced simulators put you in a true 3-D environment, as though you've been transported physically into an ultra-high-def video game. Stereoscopic cameras are trained on the hitting zone, where they record club speed, ball speed, launch angle and all components of spin. The flight of the ball, projected into the virtual course in the time it takes the ball to hit the screen, replicates the shot that would result in the outside world with remarkable precision. Full-swing simulators have to serve two distinctly different purposes: entertainment and performance. The entertainment side is on display at the indoor centers that are springing up around the country. For some, golf leagues have taken the place of bowling leagues for an evening's recreation; there are couples' leagues, skins games, match play, all on simulations of great courses around the world. Brad Lefebvre, Chief Development Officer for the Crosswoods Indoor Golf Centers in the Phoenix area, travels with a group of friends who use the simulators to familiarize themselves with places they're planning to play. \\"I can bring a client in and we can play in two hours,\\" says Mr. Lefebvre. His leagues attract golfers looking to avoid the blistering summer heat and occasional winter rains. \\"It's the first time in my business life I pray for bad weather.\\" But it's the performance side where things have changed the most. The old simulators were notorious for simplifying ball flight. The swing that gave you a big drive down the fairway indoors might produce a duck-hook on the course; the machines were useless for serious practice. Today, they provide all the feedback a golfer can handle, with angles and velocities for every shot. Retailers have found them useful for club-fitting. More than 85% of all clubs are purchased at off-site retail outlets, in a process Mr. Bales calls \\"FMWAI,\\" pronounced fim-way. It stands for Five Minutes With An Idiot. An accurate simulator will provide the necessary data for an accurate fitting, even when operated by a temporary employee at a chain store. There's also teaching. \\"We had one kid who didn't hit the ball high enough to get out of chutes and over trees,\\" says Dave Hollinger, men's golf coach at the University of Waterloo in Ontario. \\"He worked all winter on getting his ball flight right, and he reached the round of 16 at the U.S. Amateur Public Links championship, and finished seventh at the Canadian Amateur.\\" Then there's self-instruction, perhaps the biggest market of all. Only 10% of golfers take lessons, and if most golfers practice at all they must work on their own. What do simulators do best? On full shots, they deliver a good measure of realism and accuracy. But roughly half the shots in a round of golf are played from within 50 yards of the hole, and it's here that the indoor game requires some large mental adjustments. On touch shots like pitches and chips, golfers generally pick out a target visually and play the ball to that point. On a simulator, you have to play from information instead of what you see. If you're 30 yards from the green, you have to develop the feeling of hitting the ball 30 yards; it becomes a question of muscle memory rather than hand-eye coordination and judgment. The putting elements have improved, but they call for a similar adjustment; you have to learn how softly to stroke an eight-foot putt towards a hole on a screen 25 feet away. The good thing is, we can all use more time practicing eight-foot putts, but it's difficult to hold onto that feeling when you go back outside and face a whole different set of sensory inputs. No simulator can prepare a player for the variety of lies and ground conditions he'll find on the course. Every lie on an artificial mat is level; uphill, downhill, and sidehill lies require knowledge and practice you can't get indoors. Some simulators deduct distance for a shot out of thick rough, but that does little to help you learn how to hit it. The same goes for hitting from the sand. Mr. Bales acknowledges these shortcomings, while enthusing about \\"trajectory physics\\" and \\"aero coefficients.\\" On the company's test range, he is seeking \\"sub-millimeter accuracy in pinpointing the position of a ball in space. When we have all that data, then we'll have the Holy Grail of simulator accuracy.\\" Sportswriter Jeff Neuman is co-author of \\"A Disorderly Compendium of Golf.\\" John Paul Newport is off this week.

Simulators have greatly improved over time, with cutting-edge technology providing a more accurate and immersive experience.

(CBS4) – A health warning has been sent out to residents of a small town on Colorado’s Eastern Plains: don’t drink the water.      The town of Hugo’s public works department said Thursday afternoon the municipal water supply has been found to contain THC, the psychoactive ingredient in marijuana.      “Earlier this afternoon Hugo Public Works notified Lincoln County Sheriff’s Office that there was evidence of THC in the Town of Hugo’s water supply,” the Lincoln County Sheriff’s Office wrote in a Facebook post.      So far there’s been no explanation given about how the THC might have come to be present in the water, and it’s not clear how much THC the water may contain. They said the warning is being sent out “out of an abundance of caution” and should be followed for the next 48 hours.      Hugo Residents Evidence of THC in town water,Dont      drink,shower,or cook w/it.Fresh H20 coming Will advise when it arrives.#HugosWater — Hugo Marshals Office (@HugoMarshals) July 21, 2016      Authorities said residents can still flush toilets with the water but they said not to drink it, shower with it or cook with it. They said supplies of fresh water are being delivered to the community soon.      State and federal authorities have been contacted to assist with the investigation into the matter.      Hugo is located to the southeast of Limon on Highway 287, approximately 100 miles east and south of Denver. The town has a population of approximately 800 people.      Residents were told to call 719-743-2485 with questions about the warning.      RELATED STORIES: Marijuana Legalization Story Archive ||||| Related Articles July 23, 2016 Hugo water safe to drink after conclusive tests show no signs of THC      HUGO — This town on Colorado’s Eastern Plains warned its residents not to drink, bathe in or cook with its tap water on Thursday because officials said multiple preliminary tests of the water came back positive for THC, the main psychoactive compound in marijuana.      Residents were told not even to let their pets drink the water.      There have been no reports of illnesses or any symptoms of impairment from drinking the water, officials said at a news conference Thursday evening. Deeper tests, which will not be completed until Saturday, are needed to verify the presence of THC and to determine the level of contamination, if any.      “We are checking to make sure this isn’t because of the field test kit — that it isn’t a false positive,” said Capt. Michael Yowell of Lincoln County Sheriff’s Office.      But Yowell said there were enough troubling signs for officials to take quick action.      Concerns about the water were first raised by a Hugo company using quick “field tests” to check employees for THC, Yowell said. The simple tests are similar in function to home pregnancy tests in that they can return only two results: positive or negative.      Yowell said the company, which he did not identify, had been getting inconsistent results and decided to test a vial of tap water, expecting it to be negative. Instead, the test came back positive, and the company called authorities.      Yowell said Lincoln County officials conducted 10 other field tests, using two different types of test kits, on the town’s water and six came back positive. Authorities later isolated the positive results to a single well — well No. 1, about a mile south of Hugo’s small downtown. When sheriff’s deputies investigated, Yowell said, they found signs of forced entry at the well, though it is unclear when the damage may have occurred.      “I wouldn’t be doing my job for my community if we just wrote this off,” Yowell said.      The well has been sealed and secured, but he said it will take time for water to flush through the lines. Agents from the FBI and Colorado Bureau of Investigation are participating in the probe, Yowell said, and a representative from the 18th Judicial District Attorney’s Office was in Hugo on Thursday to support the investigation, as well.      Screening stations are being set up for worried residents, and water is being trucked in. The county’s public health department said the public should avoid the town’s water for at least the next 48 hours and report any effects to the Rocky Mountain Poison and Drug Center.      Hugo Mayor Tom Lee says he was shocked by news of the possibly tainted water. He said there hasn’t been the kind of acrimonious debate over marijuana in Hugo that there has been in other Colorado communities.      “We’ll figure it out,” Lee said. “It just blew my mind.”      Hugo Residents Evidence of THC in town water,Dont      drink,shower,or cook w/it.Fresh H20 coming Will advise when it arrives.#HugosWater — Hugo Marshals Office (@HugoMarshals) July 21, 2016      Hugo is a Lincoln County town of about 720 people that sits roughly 90 miles east of Colorado Springs and 15 miles southeast of Limon.

THC was discovered in the water in Hugo prompting a city and federal investigation.            Mark Salley, a spokesman for the Colorado Department of Public Health and Environment, said a state toxicologist is assessing what kind of health effects the potential contamination could have. Salley said — as with marijuana edibles or other products — the impacts would likely vary based on the amount of water consumed and the concentration.      But others cast doubt on the dangers of THC-contaminated water or whether it’s even possible to spike tap water with marijuana.      “It would take more product than any of us could afford to contaminate a city water supply to the extent that people would suffer any effects,” Dr. John Fox, Lincoln County’s health officer, said in a statement.      Peter Perrone, who owns Wheat Ridge cannabis testing facility Gobi Analytical, said cannabinoids such as THC or CBD “are in no way soluble in water.”      “There is zero possibility that there’s anything like THC in the Hugo water,” Perrone said.      All tests so far on water have been with field test kits. Some have come back negative. Some positive. — John Ingold ☀️ (@johningold) July 22, 2016      “You know how oil and water separate? It’s the same with cannabinoids. They’re lipophilic, which means they’re fat-loving. They would never be soluble in water. In order for people to solubilize these cannabinoids in their drinks, for marijuana products like the Dixie Elixirs sold in dispensaries, it takes a lot of work. It takes so many steps to get a fat-soluble thing like a cannabinoid into something like a drink.”      Joseph Evans, a former EPA scientist who now serves as lab director at Denver-based marijuana testing lab Nordic Analytical, agreed.      “The one thing that bothers me about this story from a scientific perspective is that THC is so insoluble in water,” Evans said. “I can’t imagine, I can’t even fathom the idea that THC would be in water at any type of solubility to create any kind of health hazard.”      A spokeswoman for the Environmental Protection Agency said the agency’s support had not been requested as of about 5 p.m.      Yowell said authorities in Hugo are aware that THC and water shouldn’t mix.      “But when you have a presumptive positive of THC in our water supply, we take that very seriously,” he said.

The town’s restaurant, Jean’s Family Kitchen, closed because it couldn’t use the water. The soda machines at the Loaf ‘N Jug fell silent.      The high school’s 6-man football team had to cancel its summer camp because players couldn’t shower afterward, said Jake McClendon, a fullback and linebacker on the team.      “I thought it was a joke at first,” he said.      Lucas Hohl, owner of Osborne’s Supermarket, said an influx of customers came in seeking bottled water.      Hohl likened the increase in traffic to the “mad rush of sales when a blizzard is coming in.”      He added: “We’re trying to reduce the panic as best we can. It sounds like the town is trying to get the situation under control.”      Some, like 90-year-old Maye Gene Lee, a former mayor of the town, were angry at the possibility that saboteurs may have struck the town’s water supply.      “If I could have gotten my hands on them, I would have taken care of them myself,” she said. “We shouldn’t have to worry about that. And if it happens out here in Hugo, Colo., it can happen any place.”      Others, though, greeted the news with a sense of humor. Patsie Smith, another former mayor, said she received a reverse 911-type message shortly after 3 p.m. telling residents not to drink the water because there could be THC in it. She chuckled at the thought.      “I might have to go drink some water,” she joked.

As we were going out of the door, a young teenage boy was coming in. The boy had no hair on the sides of his head and some blue hair on top. He held a skateboard under one arm and a basketball under the other. Caitlin, who was walking in front of me, stopped when she saw the teen. I thought she'd be scared of him. I was WRONG. She backed up against the door and opened it as wide as it would go. I walked to the other side and let the boy pass. He said: \\"Thank you very much.\\" On our way to the car, I talked with Caitlin about holding open the door for the boy. I wanted to make sure whether she was troubled by his appearance. But the only thing Caitlin noticed about the teen was the fact that his arms were full. \\"He would have had a hard time to open the door.\\" I saw the shaved   head and the blue hair. She saw a person carrying something under each arm and walking toward a closed door. In the future, I hope to get on her level and raise my sights. Question: What made Grandma feel uncomfortable? Yes or no, is the answer \\"The strange appearance of the teen.\\"? The answer to this question is:","output":"Yes, the answer is \\"The strange appearance of the teen.\\" Grandma felt uncomfortable because when she saw the teenage boy with shaved sides of his head and blue hair on top, carrying a skateboard and a basketball, she initially thought her granddaughter Caitlin would be scared of him based on his unique appearance. However, Caitlin did not seem to be bothered by the teen's appearance at all, and instead focused on the fact that he had a hard time opening the door with his arms full, which led her to open the door for him. This demonstrated a valuable lesson for Grandma about not making snap judgments based on someone's appearance and instead focusing on the person as a whole."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

The United States Navy has been working on the development of a railgun, which is an electromagnetic projectile launcher that can fire projectiles at extremely high velocities without the need for explosives. The concept has been of interest to the military due to its potential for precise, long-range strikes with a relatively low cost per shot compared to conventional missiles like the Tomahawk.

Context: Manny had Bob Marley cranking on the stereo, his van was full of passengers, and the air conditioning was working after a long week of giving him trouble. The sun beat down on the wet-looking asphalt road that ran along the harbor, next to the concrete waterfront. It curved along in front of the brightly colored Dutch Colonial warehouses of Charlotte Amalie, which were now converted restaurants and jewel shops. Tourists in day-glo shirts and daubs of sunscreen rubbed over peeling skin crowded both sides of the waterfront road. Manny slowed somewhat, keeping an eye on them. On the sidewalk by the shops a tall black man stood by a food cart. The hand-painted wooden sign hanging from the cart's side had faded letters. The man wore a grand suit with tails, like an orchestra conductor, and a top hat perched on his shaved head. A cigar burned in his mouth. For a brief second he held Manny's attention. Then the food cart's owner stepped forward and the strangely dressed man disappeared. Manny looked at the other side of the road. A white girl with oval shaped sunglasses and pink leather pants stepped off the sidewalk into the road in front of his van. He slammed on the brakes, trying to dodge her, but the van couldn't respond that fast. Her ponytail flew up towards the windshield and her head struck the star-shaped hood ornament. She bounced along the asphalt. Manny weaved the van to a stop, with swearing from the passengers in the back. He opened the door and stepped out into the heat. Get up, stand up, the radio cried out, and that was what Manny hoped would happen. He hoped that she would at least just stir and be okay. But she just lay there.

Are these two questions paraphrases of each other?","output":"No, these two questions are not paraphrases of each other. They address two completely different topics. I will provide detailed answers for each question separately: 1) Who is likely to be the next American woman running for president? It is difficult to predict with certainty who will be the next American woman running for president, as it depends on various factors such as potential candidates' individual decisions, political party nominations, and public opinion. However, several female politicians have been mentioned in the media and political circles as potential presidential candidates for the upcoming elections. Some of these potential candidates include: - Kamala Harris, the current Vice President of the United States, who could potentially run for president after President Joe Biden's term. - Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, a Democratic congresswoman from New York, who has gained a large following since her election in 2018 and has been vocal about progressive policies. - Elizabeth Warren, a Democratic senator from Massachusetts, who has been an advocate for economic equality and consumer protections and previously ran in the 2020 Democratic primaries. - Nikki Haley, a Republican and former governor of South Carolina, who has experience in the international field having served as the United States Ambassador to the United Nations under former President Donald Trump. These are just a few examples, and the political landscape may change significantly before the next presidential election. As a result, it is important to stay informed of any changes or announcements from potential candidates and political parties. 2) Can anyone guide me on how to create a Personal Assistant using AI? Creating a personal assistant using AI requires several steps, including knowledge of programming, natural language processing, and machine learning techniques. Here's a general outline of the process: 1. Define the purpose and scope: Clearly define what you want your personal assistant to do and the tasks it should accomplish. This will help you determine the required features and functionality. 2. Choose a platform or framework: There are many AI platforms and frameworks available that can be used for building a personal assistant, such as Google's Dialogflow, Microsoft's Bot Framework, and Rasa. These platforms take care of the backend infrastructure and provide useful tools for developers. 3. Learn programming languages: To create your AI personal assistant, you need to have knowledge of programming languages such as Python, JavaScript, or another language depending on the platform or framework you choose. 4. Design the conversational flow: Map out the possible conversation paths between the user and your personal assistant. This includes designing intents (what the user wants to do), entities (keywords or parameters to extract from user input), and dialogue flow (how your assistant responds and guides the user). 5. Train the AI model: Use natural language processing (NLP) algorithms and machine learning techniques to understand user input and learn from conversations as the personal assistant interacts with users. This includes training the model with sample dialogues and constantly refining the conversation paths and responses. 6. Integrate with APIs and external services: Enhance the functionality of your AI personal assistant by connecting it to external services with APIs. This can be beneficial when completing tasks like sending emails, fetching information from databases, or providing personalized recommendations to users. 7. Test and refine: Test your AI personal assistant with real users and analyze the conversation logs to determine weaknesses and shortcomings. Use this data to make improvements and enhancements to the personal assistant's conversational flow and AI model. 8. Deploy your AI personal assistant: Deploy your personal assistant on various platforms, such as messaging apps, websites, and mobile apps, to make it accessible to users. Building a personal assistant using AI is a complex process and may require collaboration with experts in areas such as natural language processing, machine learning, and user experience design. By following these steps, you can start your journey toward creating a helpful and engaging AI personal assistant."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Think like you are answering to a five year old. The Parliamentary and Health Service Ombudsman investigated 158 complaints against the Home Office and agencies last year, and upheld 69% of them. That is more than double the average for the public sector. In one case, a teenage refugee had to wait nearly 10 years before he was allowed to stay. The Home Office said it would consider the report's findings. According to the report, the main problem the watchdog identified with the Home Office concerned immigration casework, where procedural errors, delays and poor decisions meant people had to endure \\"prolonged uncertainty\\". In the case of the 17-year-old asylum seeker, he spent almost a decade without legal status in the UK even though his mother, who had fled her home country, had been allowed to stay permanently. The report said the young man was in \\"administrative limbo\\" because officials continually overlooked his application. He has since received an apology and Â£7,500 in compensation. Parliamentary and Health Service Ombudsman Julie Mellor said: \\"We have seen far too many cases where people have been separated from their loved ones, unable to work and where their children have been denied access to education. \\"It is the responsibility of every board of every UK government department and agency to recognise the profound impact poor services can have on people's lives and make sure they learn from complaints to improve services for all.\\" Complaints about the NHS form the bulk of the ombudsman's work but it completed 885 investigations into 981 complaints about UK government departments, their agencies and some UK public organisations in 2014-15. Four government departments accounted for 85% of the investigations - the Ministry of Justice, Department for Work and Pensions, Home Office and HM Revenue and Customs. Overall the ombudsman upheld 33% of the complaints investigated. \\"The large proportion of complaints that we upheld about the Home Office can partly be explained by the high volume of old legacy immigration cases they are dealing with,\\" the report said. What is a summary of this text?","output":"So, imagine if you did your homework and turned it in, but your teacher kept forgetting to check it for almost 10 years. That's kind of like what happened with the Home Office, a place in the UK that makes big decisions like who can live there. We know this because there is a group called the Parliamentary and Health Service Ombudsman—who act a bit like a school principal—who checked on the Home Office about how well they were doing their job. They looked over 158 times people said the Home Office did something wrong, and found that 69% of the time, the complaints were right.  One of those times was about a teenage boy who came from another country to be safe, but had to wait about 10 years before he was allowed to stay, even though his mom was already allowed to. The Ombudsman said that the Home Office made too many mistakes and took too long to make decisions, which isn't fair to people like the boy who had to wait a very long time. The Home Office has said sorry to the boy and given him some money to say sorry for their mistake. This group also checks on other big departments that are like the Home Office, and usually people are unhappy with how well they're doing their job about 33% of the time. But for the Home Office, people were unhappy about 69% of the time which is quite a lot more.

Answer the following question: Found the following article online, use it to answer the question: What are the full names of the people who the used very last of the chloroform in their medical supplies?  After Shackleton left with the James Caird, Frank Wild took command of the Elephant Island party, some of whom were in a low state, physically or mentally: Lewis Rickinson had suffered a suspected heart attack; Perce Blackborow was unable to walk, due to frostbitten feet; Hubert Hudson was depressed. The priority for the party was a permanent shelter against the rapidly approaching southern winter. On the suggestion of George Marston and Lionel Greenstreet, a hut—nicknamed the \\"Snuggery\\"—was improvised by upturning the two boats and placing them on low stone walls, to provide around five feet (1.5 m) of headroom. By means of canvas and other materials the structure was made into a crude but effective shelter.Wild initially estimated that they would have to wait one month for rescue, and refused to allow long-term stockpiling of seal and penguin meat because this, in his view, was defeatist. This policy led to sharp disagreements with Thomas Orde-Lees, who was not a popular man and whose presence apparently did little to improve the morale of his companions, unless it was by way of being the butt of their jokes.As the weeks extended well beyond his initial optimistic forecast, Wild established and maintained routines and activities to relieve the tedium. A permanent lookout was kept for the arrival of the rescue ship, cooking and housekeeping rotas were established, and there were hunting trips for seal and penguin. Concerts were held on Saturdays and anniversaries were celebrated, but there were growing feelings of despondency as time passed with no sign of the ship. The toes on Blackborow's left foot became gangrenous from frostbite and, on 15 June, had to be amputated by surgeons Alexander Macklin and James McIlroy in the candle-lit hut. Using the very last of the chloroform in their medical supplies, the whole procedure took 55 minutes and was a complete success.By 23 August, it seemed that Wild's no-stockpiling policy had failed. The surrounding sea was dense with pack ice that would halt any rescue ship,... Answer:","output":"The full names of the people who used the very last of the chloroform in their medical supplies are Dr. Alexander Hepburne Macklin and Dr. James Archibald McIlroy. They utilized the remaining chloroform to perform the amputation of the gangrenous toes on Perce Blackborow's left foot, due to frostbite, under the candle-lit makeshift hut called the \\"Snuggery\\" on Elephant Island. The surgery, which lasted for 55 minutes, proved to be a complete success."},{"instruction":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

Paragraph: The inhabited history of the Las Vegas Valley stretches to 23,000 b.c. , when much of the area was covered by a prehistoric lake. During this period, the indigenous people lived in caves, hunting the mammals that gathered at the shoreline. The landscape of the valley changed dramatically over the next 200 centuries. The glaciers feeding the lake melted away and the lake evaporated. Fossils tell an obscure story of man's slow and sporadic development. Around 3000 b.c. , native Archaic Indians began to develop a lasting hunting and gathering culture. By this time, the valley was in much the same geographic state as it exists in today, with one exception — the presence of artesian springs that bubbled to the surface in several areas. These springs fed a network of streams draining through the Las Vegas Wash to the Colorado River. The areas surrounding the springs were desert oases: sprawling collections of grasses, trees, and wildlife. Many springs lay in areas that would eventually become the center of the modern Las Vegas metropolis. For about 4000 years, the Archaics thrived in a culture that included many signs of early civilization. Signs of even more advancement appeared halfway through the first millennium a.d. , when the Anasazi Indians inhabited the valley. Far more progressive than the Archaics, the Anasazi utilized such formal agricultural techniques as irrigation to assist their harvest. This permitted the Anasazi to achieve a benchmark of advanced society — the ability to live in permanent shelters year-round without need to follow wildlife. Mysteriously, the Anasazi vanished from the valley around a.d.  Question: \\"During what time period did the Anasazi Indians inhabit the Las Vegas valley?\\" Answer: \\"23,000 b.c\\" Based on the paragraph, is this answer correct","output":"No, that answer is not correct.

Possible A: relaxation, stress, getting somewhere, transportation, boredom  Why is \\"relaxation\\" an answer aligned with human common sense? Answer:","output":"\\"Relaxation\\" is an answer aligned with human common sense for the following reasons: 1. Perception of Scenic Beauty: Driving along a scenic highway allows individuals to appreciate the beauty of nature and picturesque landscapes. Humans often find nature soothing, and the immersive experience of scenic surroundings can evoke pleasant emotions and a sense of relaxation. 2. Distraction from Stressful Thoughts: A scenic drive can provide a much-needed distraction from daily stressors, allowing the mind to focus on the present and appreciate the calm, peaceful environment around them resulting in relaxation. 3. Decrease in Sensory Overload: Urban environments are often filled with noise, chaos, and high levels of activity that can be mentally overwhelming. In contrast, scenic drives often occur in relatively quiet, less crowded areas, reducing sensory overload and providing an atmosphere conducive to relaxation. 4. Therapeutic Effects of Nature: Research has shown that spending time in nature has various psychological benefits, including reduced stress, improved mood, and increased feelings of relaxation. As driving a car along a scenic highway involves engaging with the natural environment, it stands to reason that this activity would promote relaxation. 5. Enjoyment of Leisure Activity: For many individuals, driving is not just a means of transportation, but can also be an enjoyable activity when it takes place along scenic routes. Engaging in leisure activities that one finds enjoyable is often associated with an increased sense of relaxation and well-being.

Tak'alik Ab'aj (; Mayan pronunciation: [takˀaˈlik aˀ'ɓaχ] (listen); Spanish: [takaˈlik aˈβax]) is a pre-Columbian archaeological site in Guatemala. It was formerly known as Abaj Takalik; its ancient name may have been Kooja. It is one of several Mesoamerican sites with both Olmec and Maya features. The site flourished in the Preclassic and Classic periods, from the 9th century BC through to at least the 10th century AD, and was an important centre of commerce, trading with Kaminaljuyu and Chocolá. Investigations have revealed that it is one of the largest sites with sculptured monuments on the Pacific coastal plain. Olmec-style sculptures include a possible colossal head, petroglyphs and others. The site has one of the greatest concentrations of Olmec-style sculpture outside of the Gulf of Mexico.Takalik Abaj is representative of the first blossoming of Maya culture that had occurred by about 400 BC. The site includes a Maya royal tomb and examples of Maya hieroglyphic inscriptions that are among the earliest from the Maya region. Excavation is continuing at the site; the monumental architecture and persistent tradition of sculpture in a variety of styles suggest the site was of some importance.Finds from the site indicate contact with the distant metropolis of Teotihuacan in the Valley of Mexico and imply that Takalik Abaj was conquered by it or its allies. Takalik Abaj was linked to long-distance Maya trade routes that shifted over time but allowed the city to participate in a trade network that included the Guatemalan highlands and the Pacific coastal plain from Mexico to El Salvador. Takalik Abaj was a sizeable city with the principal architecture clustered into four main groups spread across nine terraces. While some of these were natural features, others were artificial constructions requiring an enormous investment in labour and materials. The site featured a sophisticated water drainage system and a wealth of sculptured monuments. The answer to this question is:","output":"Tak'alik Ab'aj first started to flourish in the Preclassic period, which began around the 9th century BC."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Can the Prime Minister of India be a speaker of the Lok Sabha? Options: [1]. no [2]. yes","output":"[1]. no These questions do not have the same meaning. The first question is a two-part query that asks about the duties of the Speaker of the Lok Sabha and also inquires about the best Speaker to have held the position so far. The second question, on the other hand, is focused on the possibility of the Prime Minister of India taking up the role of the Speaker of the Lok Sabha. Let's break down the two questions to better understand their meaning. First question: What are the duties of the Speaker of the Lok Sabha, and who is the best speaker so far? The Speaker of the Lok Sabha is an essential part of the Indian Parliament, serving as the representative and chief authority of the House. The primary duties of the Speaker are as follows: 1. Presiding over the sittings of the Lok Sabha and maintaining decorum and order in the House. 2. Deciding on procedural matters, points of order, and interpretations of the rules of procedure. 3. Referring bills, motions, and other matters to the relevant parliamentary committees for detailed examination. 4. Casting a deciding vote in case of a tie on any matter under discussion in the House. 5. Representing the Lok Sabha in its relations with the President of India, the Rajya Sabha, and other authorities or individuals. 6. Certifying money bills and providing assent on behalf of the Lok Sabha. 7. Safeguarding the rights and privileges of the members of the House. As for the best Speaker so far, this is a subjective topic and different individuals may have varying opinions based on their assessment of effectiveness, impartiality, and other factors. However, some notable Speakers of the Lok Sabha in the past include G.V. Mavalankar (the first Speaker of independent India), P.A. Sangma, Meira Kumar, and Sumitra Mahajan. Second question: Can the Prime Minister of India be a speaker of the Lok Sabha? Technically, the Prime Minister of India can be elected as the Speaker of the Lok Sabha, as the Constitution does not impose any specific restriction on who can be chosen for this role. However, convention and the practicalities of governance make this possibility highly unlikely. The Prime Minister holds the executive responsibility of running the government and developing and implementing policies, whereas the Speaker is responsible for presiding over the proceedings of the Lok Sabha and ensuring the smooth functioning of the legislature. Combining these two critical and distinct roles would likely lead to a conflict of interest and impede the effective separation of powers between the executive and the legislative branches of government. In reality, the Prime Minister and the Speaker are always two different individuals, each focusing on their respective responsibilities within the Indian polity. Therefore, while there is no explicit constitutional or legal prohibition, historical precedent and practical concerns make it improbable for the Prime Minister of India to also serve as the Speaker of the Lok Sabha."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Lyon arrives pennyless in New York City and is attracted to an illegal street fighting match that is being run by a New Yorker called Joshua, a man who runs fights for money. Gaultier steps forward to take part in the next fight and destroys his opponent, leaving Joshua looking astounded at what he just saw. Joshua takes Lyon to meet a person called Cynthia, also known as 'The Lady' who organizes underground fights for the rich elite and she decides to sponsor him.

Write a summary based on this article: The search is finally over.      The deadly cobra that escaped from the Bronx Zoo on Saturday is back in custody, zoo officials said today.      The highly venomous 20-inch-long snake escaped from its habitat, with zoo officials saying it was hiding out somewhere inside the Reptile House, which had remained closed since the weekend.      The snake was found at about 9 a.m. after it was lured out by the smell of rodents that had been there by zoo workers, officials said.      “As you can imagine, we are delighted to report that the snake has been found alive and well,” said Jim Breheny, director of the Bronx Zoo.      “I really want to thank our staff for their determination and professionalism as we conducted the methodical search. We appreciated the public’s support throughout the past week and we thank the media for helping keep the public informed.”      The brownish cobra — with a uniquely large, broad head — is among the most venomous reptiles on the planet — its poison can kill a person in fewer than 15 minutes.      Zoo officials said no one was fired as a result of the incident.      The missing snake became international news in recent days.      A prankster seized upon the tale to create a fake Twitter account called @bronxzooscobra, quickly garnering nearly 200,000 followers.      The Twitter “cobra” refused to concede that it had been caught. Around 2:10 p.m. it tweeted, “If you see a bag of peanuts inexplicably moving along the ground at Yankee Stadium today. Just ignore it. It’s probably nothing.”      Zoo officials had resorted to using traps baited with live rats to try to capture it.      With Newscore ||||| Bronx Zoo deadly escaped Egyptian Cobra is found alive after 6 days on the lam      Julie Larsen Maher First photo! The Bronx Zoo cobra is captured after six days missing.      The hisssssteria is over: The Bronx Zoo cobra was caught Thursday, less than 100 feet from the cage it somehow escaped six days earlier.      \\"We found our snake and we're very happy,\\" the zoo's relieved director, Jim Breheny, told the Daily News on Thursday.      The fanged former fugitive is world-famous but has no name - so the zoo and the Daily News are teaming up to sponsor a contest, with details to be announced soon.      The venomous Egyptian cobra was spotted coiled in a corner of the Reptile House around 9 a.m., during one of three daily sweeps by a half-dozen zoo workers.      \\"We always thought she'd be in a dark quiet place and that's where she was,\\" Breheny said.      Using special tongs and hooks, staffers easily apprehended her.      \\"We knew it was going to be a game of patience,\\" Breheny said. \\"We set the place up to make it easier to search.\\"      The zoo, which is run by the Wildlife Conservation Society, didn't leave out any mice-baited traps but kept the area dark and quiet, and scattered rodent-scented wood shavings.      \\"We wanted to just let her feel comfortable,\\" Breheny said. \\"We did everything we could to help her feel secure.\\"      Zoo officials believe the serpent slipped out of a fiberglass box with a sliding glass front on Friday while no one was around.      \\"Clearly she finagled her way out of the enclosure,\\" Breheny said. \\"We've begun a review to see if we can piece together what happened.      \\"We have not changed our protocol but double-checked existing protocol and have people double-checking each other,\\" he said.      Zoo officials plan to reopen the Reptile House soon, and the clever cobra will go on exhibit after getting a clean bill of health.      \\"She looks in really good condition,\\" Breheny said.      The cold-blooded Houdini should be a big draw. Her vanishing act made headlines across the globe, provided fodder for late-night comedians, and prompted both anxiety and amusement from New Yorkers.      An anonymous wit even created a Twitter feed chronicling the reptile's madeup misadventures - and picked up over 200,000 followers, from Mayor Bloomberg to Ellen DeGeneres.      All along, zoo officials said they were confident the 20-inch-long adolescent was still somewhere in the Reptile House, not roaming the city.      Cobras can be deadly. The Egyptian's bite will shut down a human respiratory system if left untreated.      But Breheny downplayed the potential danger to the public.      \\"Snakes in general are shy, secretive creatures. If the snake had a choice between fight or flight, it would definitely avoid people,\\" he said.      Now that the elusive animal has been found, she is under close observation.      \\"She's resting comfortably - and secure,\\" he promised.      bpaddock@nydailynews.com |||||","output":"A highly venomous cobra that escaped from the Bronx Zoo has been found and captured, after being on the loose for six days. Zoo officials believed the snake was hiding inside the Reptile House, which had been closed since its escape. The snake was lured out using the smell of rodents by zoo workers. The Egyptian cobra's venom is potent enough to kill a human in under 15 minutes. The escape became international news, even leading to the creation of a fake Twitter account for the snake, which garnered almost 200,000 followers.

Paul and Jessica are killed, but Sarah survives. One year later, Sarah and her friends Juno, Beth, Sam (MyAnna Buring), Rebecca (Saskia Mulder), and newcomer Holly (Nora-Jane Noone) are reunited at a cabin in the Appalachian Mountains of North Carolina. While spelunking, Juno apologises to Sarah for not being there for her after the accident, but Sarah is distant. As the group moves through a passage, it collapses behind them, trapping them. After a heated discussion, Juno admits she led the group into an unknown cave system instead of the fully explored cave system like they originally planned, and that rescue is impossible because of this. She then tells Sarah that she led them into the unknown cave in the hopes of restoring their relationship, but Sarah rebuffs her. As the group presses forward, they discover climbing equipment from a previous spelunker, and a cave painting that suggests an exit exists.

Youth Sport Trust, which organised a National School Sport Week at Home in June, said: \\"We wanted to ensure young people still felt that sense of fun they get from school sports days and that sports days do not get cancelled completely this year.\\" So what have pupils been up to while abiding by lockdown rules? PE teachers in Blackburn have been setting the students a \\"beat the teacher\\" challenge each day for the pupils to do at home. The students then send in their scores to compare to the teachers' results. Hollie Southward, one of the PE teachers, said they were activities suited for the home. Noah in year 7 took on a speed bounce challenge to see how many bounces he could do over a broom in 30 seconds and also competed in an obstacle course. Priestley Smith School in Birmingham, a specialist school for vision impaired pupils, got children to try tea bag throwing and teachers read a sport-themed bed time story to pupils, explained Chloe Manley. Some pupils have not been back at school for weeks so it was an ideal opportunity to engage with the children at school and at home, added Mrs Manley. The PE lead at St Breock Primary School in Wadebridge, said a sports week helped the children at home \\"connect with us at school\\". When they told the children about the plans \\"the excitement was unbelievable\\", said James Ross from Cornwall. Children at school and home competed in similar activities with those taking part in school all having separate PE equipment bags to keep them safe. In Kent, a reception class has been practicing a socially distanced egg and spoon race ahead of a full school sports event. Pupils at Valley Invicta Primary School will be able to earn points for their house before the winner is announced at the end of the week. The sports day activities have been designed to abide by social distancing rules. Pupils in Edinburgh have been trying home high jumping with toilets rolls and tennis ball and spoon races. \\"We ensured that all events could be completed in any space that families had available and that any items of equipment needed were easily found in any house,\\" explained PE and sport director Mike Leonard, from George Watson's College. The teachers recorded some events alongside the school mascot, Rex, for the pupils to try at home, aiming to make the day as inclusive and fun as possible. Teachers in Cornwall have been preparing challenges for their students to try at home, such as toilet roll keepy uppies and tea bag throwing. PE director at Mounts Bay Academy, Ian Veal, said they were avoiding traditional sports day activities to \\"hopefully include all pupils\\" and not exclude any without equipment at home. After all the tutor groups have completed the sports day activities, the PE department will add up the scores and announce the winners. In Sheffield, Tajman had \\"great fun\\" taking part in her first sports day, including doing an obstacle course in the garden. The four-year-old's father said they had been \\"keeping her active\\" during lockdown with lots of different activities outside. Girls High School Sheffield asked its pupils to carry out five different activities. Head of PE Steve Wareham said: \\"As soon as we knew sports day was going to be missed this year, my PE team were really keen to try and do something.\\" The staff at Chelmer Valley High School in Essex made sure all the activities could be done individually and easily at home, such as speed bouncing, sock throwing and chair squatting.

Q:Formulate an answer to this elaborate question: What singer recorded the song \\"Go Now\\" before Denny Laine with Moody Blues? A:","output":"The song \\"Go Now\\" was originally recorded by an American R&B singer named Bessie Banks before Denny Laine and the Moody Blues made it popular. Bessie Banks, born Bessie White on February 8, 1938, in North Carolina, recorded \\"Go Now\\" in 1964 as a soulful ballad. The song was written by her husband Larry Banks, who was a singer, record producer, and songwriter, in collaboration with Milton Bennett. Bessie Banks' version of \\"Go Now\\" was released under the independent record label, Leiber & Stoller's Tiger Records, in late 1964. The song quickly garnered success and began climbing the R&B charts in the United States. Her heartwarming and powerful vocal performance on \\"Go Now\\" showcased her talent, but the song's fame was short-lived due to the quick rise of the Moody Blues' rendition soon after. Denny Laine, the English musician known for his involvement in the Moody Blues and later with Wings, recorded his version of \\"Go Now\\" alongside the Moody Blues in 1964, around the same time Bessie Banks' version was released. Their rendition of the song was rock-oriented, reflecting the British beat movement popular at the time. The Moody Blues' version became part of their debut album, \\"The Magnificent Moodies,\\" which was released in 1965. Capitalizing on the British Invasion in America, the Moody Blues' \\"Go Now\\" became a hit not only in the United Kingdom, where it reached number one on the charts, but also in the United States, where it peaked at number 10 on the Billboard Hot 100. This newfound success overshadowed Bessie Banks' original rendition and made the song synonymous with the Moody Blues and Denny Laine, despite Bessie Banks being the first artist to record it. Throughout her career, Bessie Banks recorded other notable singles such as \\"It Sounds Like My Baby\\" and \\"Do It Now,\\" but none reached the same level of success as her original \\"Go Now\\" recording. Despite the overshadowing of her version, Bessie Banks' \\"Go Now\\" remains a significant piece of music history as it provided a foundation for the influential British rock band, the Moody Blues, and served as a testament to the importance of American soul music as an inspiration for the British Invasion."},{"instruction":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

This is why the condition is commonly known as \\"lockjaw.\\" Symptoms usually set in about eight days after infection, although the onset has been known to range from three days to three weeks.  A shorter incubation period signals a more heavily infected wound. Also, tetanus-infected wounds take longer to incubate when they are father from the central nervous system. Seek urgent treatment if you experience tetanus symptoms within fewer than eight days of exposure. On their own, a headache and a slightly stiff jaw should not terrify you.

Ken Holtzman pitched a no-hitter on August 19, and the division lead grew to 8 1⁄2 games over the St. Louis Cardinals and by 9 1⁄2 games over the New York Mets. After the game of September 2, the Cubs record was 84-52 with the Mets in second place at 77-55. But then a losing streak began just as a Mets winning streak was beginning. The Cubs lost the final game of a series at Cincinnati, then came home to play the resurgent Pittsburgh Pirates (who would finish in third place). After losing the first two games by scores of 9-2 and 13-4, the Cubs led going into the ninth inning. A win would be a positive springboard since the Cubs were to play a crucial series with the Mets the very next day. But Willie Stargell drilled a 2-out, 2-strike pitch from the Cubs' ace reliever, Phil Regan, onto Sheffield Avenue to tie the score in the top of the ninth. The Cubs would lose 7-5 in extra innings. Burdened by a four-game losing streak, the Cubs traveled to Shea Stadium for a short two-game set. The Mets won both games, and the Cubs left New York with a record of 84-58 just 1⁄2 game in front. Disaster followed in Philadelphia, as a 99 loss Phillies team nonetheless defeated the Cubs twice, to extend Chicago's losing streak to eight games. In a key play in the second game, on September 11, Cubs starter Dick Selma threw a surprise pickoff attempt to third baseman Ron Santo, who was nowhere near the bag or the ball. Selma's throwing error opened the gates to a Phillies rally. After that second Philly loss, the Cubs were 84-60 and the Mets had pulled ahead at 85-57. The Mets would not look back. The Cubs' eight-game losing streak finally ended the next day in St. Louis, but the Mets were in the midst of a ten-game winning streak, and the Cubs, wilting from team fatigue, generally deteriorated in all phases of the game.

Premise: Visitors' first views of the convent's splendor begin with the theatrical granite stairway, splashed with splendid 17th-century frescoes from floor to ceiling. In this premise, the key components include: 1. The convent being characterized by its splendor. 2. The theatrical granite stairway serving as the first view of the convent. 3. 17th-century frescoes being a part of the stairway's design, contributing to its splendor. Hypothesis: Visitors' first views of the convent's squalor begin with the rotten wooden stairway. In the hypothesis, the key components are: 1. The convent being characterized by its squalor. 2. The rotten wooden stairway serving as the first view of the convent. This comparison reveals that the conditions in the premise and hypothesis are in direct contrast. The premise discusses a convent with a high degree of grandeur, while the hypothesis depicts a deteriorating, impoverished setting. Therefore, it cannot be concluded that if the premise is true, then the hypothesis must be true as well. Furthermore, the fundamental basis of the two statements is built on contrasting notions: splendor and squalor, which involve opposing and distinctive aspects of the described convent. If the premise is accepted as true, the existence of a grand and richly decorated stairway act as a symbol of the convent's magnificence, refuting any claims of squalor presented in the hypothesis. Similarly, if the hypothesis is accepted as true, it negates the premise by presenting a picture of decay, as opposed to the luxurious atmosphere depicted in the original statement. In conclusion, the premise and hypothesis present conflicting images of the convent in question, and the truth of one does not imply the truth of the other. They exist as separate, mutually exclusive circumstances that cannot coexist within the same context."},{"instruction":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

The first man is wearing jeans and a green shirt. 3. The second man is wearing all black. 4. Both men are dancing on a wood floor. The original sentence clearly describes the attire of each man, and there is no mention of them wearing tuxedos. Provided Statement: \\"There are two men in tuxedos.\\" 1. The statement talks about two men, which is consistent with the original sentence. 2. It states that both men are wearing tuxedos.

If we compare the attire described in both sentences, there are clear discrepancies. In the original sentence, one man is wearing jeans and a green shirt, while the other is wearing all black.

The Supreme Court voiced deep free speech concerns Tuesday about a law designed to stop the sale and marketing of videos showing dog fights and other acts of animal cruelty. Selling depictions of animal cruelty like this amateur dogfighting video may be illegal under a 1999 statute. The justices heard an hour of lively debate about the scope and intent of the decade-old statute that supporters say has done much to stop the spread of profiting from the torture and abuse of animals. But media groups and the National Rifle Association were among those who say the law is overly broad. \\"It's not up to the government to decide what are people's worst instincts,\\" said Justice Antonin Scalia. \\"One can contemplate a lot of other areas, where government could say: You are appealing to people's worst instincts, and, therefore, movies cannot be made\\" showing dramatized depictions of animals being abused, for example. \\"What about people who like to see human sacrifices?\\" asked Justice Samuel Alito, somewhat sarcastically. \\"Suppose that is legally taking place someplace in the world. I mean, people here would probably love to see it. Live, pay-per-view, you know, on the Human Sacrifice Channel. They have a point of view they want to express. That's okay?\\" He seemed to indicate strongly it was not, and that lawmakers would have discretion to block it. The specific case before the court dealt with tapes showing pit bull dogs attacking other animals and one another in staged confrontations. Watch an excerpt of the tapes ». A federal appeals court had thrown out the conviction of Robert Stevens, a Pittsville, Virginia, man who sold videos through his \\"Dogs of Velvet and Steel\\" business. According to court records, undercover federal agents found he was advertising his tapes in \\"Sporting Dog Journal,\\" an underground magazine on illegal dogfighting. Among the products Stevens advertised was \\"Catch Dogs,\\" featuring pit bulls chasing wild boars on organized hunts and a \\"gruesome depiction of a pit bull attacking the lower jaw of a domestic farm pig,\\" according to the Philadelphia, Pennsylvania-based appeals court. Stevens was charged in 2004 with violating interstate commerce laws by selling depictions of animal cruelty. He was later sentenced to 37 months in prison, and promptly appealed. He argued his sentence was longer than the 14 months given professional football player Michael Vick, who ran an illegal dogfighting ring. It was the first prosecution in the United States to proceed to trial under the 1999 law. The divided appeals court concluded that when it came to the federal law in question, \\"research and empirical evidence in the record before us simply does not support the notion that banning depictions of animal cruelty is a necessary or even particularly effective means of prosecuting underlying acts of animal cruelty.\\" Nearly every state and local jurisdiction have their own laws banning mistreatment of wild and domesticated animals. Several media organizations have come out in support of Stevens, worrying the federal law was too broad and could implicate reports about deer hunting, and depictions of bull-fighting in Ernest Hemingway novels. A number of justices too had concerns, raising a number of hypotheticals, a possible sign a majority of the court remains uncomfortable with allowing the law to be reinstated. \\"Why not do a simpler thing?\\" suggested Justice Stephen Breyer. \\"Rather than let the public guess as to what these words mean, ask Congress to write a statute that actually aims at those frightful things that it was trying to prohibit. Now, that can be done.\\" \\"You have to look at the content to determine whether or not the speech is prohibited,\\" said Chief Justice John Roberts. \\"How can you tell these aren't political videos? With organizations like PETA [People for the Ethical Treatment of Animals] and others, depictions of the same sort of animal cruelty that is used to generate support for efforts to prohibit it. Why aren't these videos the exact opposite of efforts to legalize it?\\" Justice Sonia Sotomayor questioned the distinction between Stevens' videos and news items. \\"Tell me what the difference is between these videos and [filmmaker] David Roma's documentary on pit bulls? I mean, David Roma's documentary had much, much more footage on the actual animal cruelty than the films at issue here, greater sections of the film, and more explicit,\\" she said. Roma's 2006 independent film \\"Off the Chain\\" consisted of a great deal of hidden camera footage. Among the wide-ranging hypotheticals raised by the justices over what the law could forbid included: fox hunts, pate de foie gras from geese, cock fighting, bullfighting, shooting deer out of season, even Roman gladiator battles. Neal Katyal, an attorney for the Justice Department, said the law was \\"narrowly targeted\\" and had exceptions specifically for \\"religious, political, scientific, educational, journalistic, historical, or artistic value.\\" \\"This statute has nothing to do with the offense of the message. It has to do with trying to dry up an underlying market for animal cruelty,\\" said Katyal. Justice Samuel Alito appeared most supportive of the government's views. He asked about selling of so-called \\"crush\\" videos, in which women -- with their faces unseen -- are shown stomping helpless animals such as rabbits to death with spiked-heel shoes or with their bare feet. \\"The people who produce 'crush' videos think they have a message, and the message is that this is sexually exciting,\\" he said, clearly uncomfortable with the subject matter. When Stevens' lawyer Patricia Millett launched into a caveat-laden answer, Alito broke in. \\"You are not even willing to say that this could be prohibited?\\" he asked. \\"Because we are trying to determine whether this is overly broad. And this is the category of activity that Congress particularly targeted.\\" Congressional supporters said a principal motivation for passing the law was to stop the growing popularity of \\"crush\\" videos. The Humane Society said the market for such videos stopped almost completely after the law was passed. Millett said \\"Congress has a job to write with a scalpel and not a buzz saw in the First Amendment area.\\" She noted that if the law is upheld, it would only be the second time the Supreme Court has identified a form of speech undeserving of protection by the First Amendment. The justices in 1982 banned the distribution of child pornography. \\"The problem in this case, was that Congress chose to attack speech and to control what the people of this country could see and hear before it was even seriously punishing the conduct at issue and that gets our Constitution upside down,\\" Millett told reporters later. The government had argued a \\"compelling interest\\" in stopping people who would profit from dog attack tapes and similar depictions. The case is U.S. vs. Stevens (08-769) and a ruling is expected in several months. Here is a summary of the highlights for this article:","output":"In 1999, a statute was designed to stop the sale and marketing of videos showing dog fights and other acts of animal cruelty.

A new Facebook button that lets you ask friends if they're single or taken has been branded 'invasive' and 'naggy'. The 'ask' button appears on the profiles of users who have left their relationship status blank, and includes a note section to explain why you're inquiring about their status. But reactions to the addition have been mixed, with some asserting that it is an 'awkward' invasion of privacy. An invasion of privacy? A new Facebook button that lets you ask friends if they're single or taken has been branded 'invasive' and 'naggy' Over-sharing: The 'ask' button appears on the profiles of users who have left their relationship status blank, and includes a note section to explain why you're inquiring about their status. Once you send your 'ask' request, the friend receives a notification that says: 'Hello! I am wondering about your relationship!' They can either ignore it or respond with an answer, with the option of sending it back to you directly or sharing it with the general public. While the social media site has had an option to 'ask' for a friend's phone number, address and e-mail for some months now, the relationship status 'ask' button is a new development - and not everyone is happy about it. One person wrote on Twitter: 'If Facebook wasn't already the biggest invasion of privacy, you can now \\"ask\\" people about their relationship status.' Others called it 'naggy' and questioned its necessity, with one person writing: 'How awkward is that Facebook devoted a single button to ask your friends why they're single?' Even more people have asserted that the button is just another move Facebook has taken to exploit users' private information. 'How awkward is that Facebook devoted a single button to ask your friends why they're single?' Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg explained this company ethos in an 2010 interview. 'People. have really gotten comfortable not only sharing more information and. different kinds, but more openly and with more people,' he said. 'We. view it as our role in the system to constantly be innovating and be. updating what our system is to reflect what the current social norms. are.' But despite the negative reactions, some users have taken the view that the button provides an easy way for singletons to express their interest in one another. Indeed, one man tweeted: 'Hitting the \\"ask\\" button next to \\"relationship status\\" on Facebook is the ultimate gentlemanly move.' And a BroBible writer asked readers: 'Is this a game changer for spitting Facebook game, Bros?' Highlights:","output":"1. Facebook has introduced a new 'ask' button that allows users to inquire about the relationship status of their friends, receiving both praise and criticism. 2. The feature, deemed as an 'awkward' invasion of privacy by some, is designed for users whose relationship status is left blank, enabling others to ask why. 3. Once the 'ask' request is sent, the user receives a notification and can choose to ignore it or respond privately or publicly. 4. While Facebook has had an 'ask' option for phone numbers, addresses, and emails for several months, the relationship status 'ask' is a new addition, and it has met with mixed responses. 5.

The Taxi and Limousine Commission have approved a pilot program that will let up to 400 drivers convert any TLC car less than two years old into a yellow taxi. The move comes after a number of yellow cabbies who had painted their cars black in order to work for Uber are now regretting making the switch. The city hopes the program will bring down expenses for drivers, as well as make it easier for hacks to switch from working in one part of the industry to another. Not so hot: Uber is disputing claims drivers are leaving en masse, pointing to company surveys that claim its","output":"contractors are content with the flexibility and earnings opportunities provided by the ridesharing platform. However, many drivers have faced a decline in earnings due to market saturation and increased competition as more individuals sign up to be Uber drivers.  Yellow taxi advocates argue that these drivers may find more stability and fare guarantees working under the traditional taxi system. The pilot program's success will ultimately depend on whether yellow taxis can regain their competitive edge in the highly dynamic transportation landscape of New York City. The Taxi and Limousine Commission's decision to launch the pilot program aims to address some of the concerns raised by both yellow taxi drivers and Uber drivers, seeking to establish a healthier balance between the two major players in the New York transport industry.  Under this program, drivers will have the opportunity to shift back to yellow taxi operations, thus potentially alleviating the oversaturation of Uber drivers. Additionally, the conversion of black cars into yellow taxis may introduce more cabs onto the streets of New York, reducing wait times and improving overall availability. Towards the end of the pilot program, the Taxi and Limousine Commission must evaluate the results to determine if the program improved the working conditions for drivers, their earnings, and customer satisfaction. The outcomes of this evaluation will be crucial in deciding the next steps for the city's transportation landscape. If the program is successful, it may pave the way for more robust cooperation and a deeper integration between ridesharing platforms and the traditional taxi industry. As a result, New York City's streets could witness a new chapter in transportation history, where yellow taxis and ridesharing services coexist and even complement one another in better serving their passengers. In conclusion, the pilot program enabling the conversion of black cars into yellow taxis aims to address some key issues plaguing the city's transportation network, such as driver working conditions and overall market competition. As New York City continues to grow and evolve, initiatives like this one could facilitate a smoother relationship between the traditional taxi system and ridesharing services like Uber, creating a more efficient and effective transportation system for both drivers and passengers alike."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Context: A federal judge on Thursday rejected efforts by Texas to stop the resettlement of Syrian refugees within its borders. The ruling comes days after presumptive Republican presidential nominee Donald Trump called to block non-citizen Muslims from entering the U.S. following the Orlando nightclub massacre. Even before the attack, Americans were divided, mostly along party lines, on the issue of refugees from war-torn countries in the Middle East. A survey conducted in late May by the Brookings Institution found of those polled, just 38 percent of Republicans supported taking in refugees from Syria and the Middle East, compared with 77 percent of Democrats. But among Trump supporters, an overwhelming 77 percent said they oppose taking in refugees. So who are these people who cause such a divide among Americans, triggering feelings of dread and suspicion in some and feelings of empathy and hospitality in others? Millions have been forced to flee the bloody conflicts in Syria, Iraq, Libya and other Middle Eastern nations. In 1951 the United Nation's Refugee Convention defined a refugee as someone who \\"owing to a well-founded fear of being persecuted for reasons of race, religion, nationality, membership of a particular social group or political opinion, is outside the country of his nationality, and is unable to, or owing to such fear, is unwilling to avail himself of the protection of that country.\\" By the end of 2014, there were 19.5 million refugees worldwide, according to the United Nations, 14.4 million of whom were under the mandate of the United Nations Human Rights Council. This was an increase of 2.9 million from 2013. The remaining 5.1 million refugees were registered with the United Nations Relief and Works Agency.

Question: what are the factors that make one a refugee Answer: Options are: 1). a foreigner 2). not enough information 3). persecuted person 4). person outside his country of nationality due to security reasons Answer:","output":"There are several factors that make one a refugee, as defined by the 1951 United Nation's Refugee Convention. To be considered a refugee, a person must fit the following criteria: 1. Well-founded fear of persecution: A refugee is someone who has a genuine and legitimate fear of being persecuted in their home country. Persecution can be based on various reasons, including race, religion, nationality, membership in a particular social group, or political opinion. The fear of persecution must be well-founded and not based on mere speculation or personal apprehension. 2. Outside the country of nationality: A refugee is someone who is outside their country of nationality or habitual residence due to the fear of persecution. This requirement is essential because it distinguishes refugees from internally displaced persons, who are also fleeing from persecution or violence within their home country but have not crossed international borders. 3. Inability or unwillingness to avail protection of the home country: A refugee is someone who is either unable or unwilling to seek protection from their home country due to the fear of persecution. This inability or unwillingness may be because the government is unable or unwilling to provide protection, or the person may fear that seeking protection will result in further persecution or harm. Based on the context provided above, the correct answer among the options would be: 3). persecuted person. This answer aligns with the United Nation's definition of a refugee, as a person who has a well-founded fear of persecution and is outside their country of nationality or habitual residence."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

If you are crossing using a platform, hold on to the rails provided. If you are getting onto the boat off a jetty or via wading, hold on to the boat itself. When boarding a small boat, it is essential to maintain balance and control over your body movements to ensure your safety and the boat's stability. Using available handrails or holding onto the boat itself can significantly reduce the risk of slipping, falling, or capsizing the vessel. As you board the boat, be mindful of your footing and the surface you are stepping on, as it may be slippery or wet. Furthermore, while boarding, make sure to stow any loose items or gear securely to prevent them from shifting or falling overboard. If you need to transfer some belongings to the boat, do so carefully, and ask for assistance if necessary, as attempting to do it alone can lead to mishaps or accidents. Once aboard, familiarize yourself with the boat's layout and any safety equipment readily available, such as life jackets, fire extinguishers, and other emergency gear. It is essential to know their location and how to use them in case of an emergency. Additionally, take note of the boat's seating arrangement and be aware of weight distribution to avoid causing the boat to list or become unbalanced. Lastly, always pay close attention and follow any instructions given by the boat's crew or captain, as they are responsible for the overall safety of the vessel and its occupants. They should provide necessary guidance on proper boarding procedures, seating arrangements, and safety guidelines while on water. In summary, when boarding a small boat, make use of available handrails or hold onto the boat, stow gear securely, familiarize yourself with the vessel's layout and safety equipment, and follow any instructions given by the crew or captain to ensure a safe and enjoyable boating experience."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Acid rain is precipitation with a low (acidic) pH. This rain can be very destructive to wildlife. When acid rain falls in forests, freshwater habitats, or soils, it can kill insects and aquatic life. It causes this damage because of its very low pH. Sulfur oxides and nitrogen oxides in the air both cause acid rain to form ( Figure below ). Sulfur oxides are chemicals that are released from coal-fired power plants. Nitrogen oxides are released from motor vehicle exhaust.  and the situation: Beijing recently opened several new coal-fired power plants over the last few months. In Montreal, there have been large reductions in sulfur oxides produced by manufacturing plants after a recent referendum.  Answer the following question: Aquatic life in the freshwater habitats of which area is less at risk of dying? Answer:","output":"Aquatic life in the freshwater habitats of Montreal is less at risk of dying. This is because there have been large reductions in sulfur oxides produced by manufacturing plants after a recent referendum. The decreased sulfur oxides emissions result in lower chances of acid rain formation, thus reducing the risk to aquatic life. On the other hand, Beijing has opened several new coal-fired power plants, which release sulfur oxides contributing to air pollution and increasing the risk of acid rain.

If you neglect your teeth, you have a higher risk of developing tooth abscesses. If you constantly eat foods high in sugar (e.g. candy, chocolate), you can increase your risk for cavities. Cavities can lead eventually to abscesses. Some sugary foods are fine but eat them in moderation. If possible, brush afterwards. If you have an untreated cavity or a tooth fracture that reaches the dental pulp (inner part of your tooth), you risk developing an abscess. This happens when bacteria reaches your dental pulp, which is the inside of your tooth. See a dentist as soon as possible, and watch for any symptoms. Cavities and trauma typically lead to a “periapical abscess.” An injury to the gums can cause an abscess. Gum disease causes the space between the tooth and the gum to widen, which allows bacteria to enter. This bacteria can cause an abscess, even if the teeth are healthy and cavity-free. If you have any issues with your gums, watch for symptoms of an abscess. Gum injuries and gum disease typically lead to a particular kind of infection known as a “gingival abscess” (or “gum abscess”). If the infection extends to the gum pockets, and the draining of pus is blocked by the swallowed gum, it is then called a “periodontal abscess.” Summary:","output":"To prevent tooth abscesses, it is essential to maintain good oral hygiene by brushing your teeth twice daily and flossing once daily.

Answer the following question: What is the answer for the question: What is the full name of the fifteen-year-old who auditioned for Lennon, impressing him with his playing? from the following article ?  In March 1957, John Lennon, then aged sixteen, formed a skiffle group with several friends from Quarry Bank High School in Liverpool. They briefly called themselves the Blackjacks, before changing their name to the Quarrymen after discovering that a respected local group was already using the other name. Fifteen-year-old Paul McCartney joined them as a rhythm guitarist shortly after he and Lennon met that July. In February 1958, McCartney invited his friend George Harrison to watch the band. The fifteen-year-old auditioned for Lennon, impressing him with his playing, but Lennon initially thought Harrison was too young for the band. After a month of Harrison's persistence, during a second meeting (arranged by McCartney), he performed the lead guitar part of the instrumental song \\"Raunchy\\" on the upper deck of a Liverpool bus, and they enlisted him as their lead guitarist.By January 1959, Lennon's Quarry Bank friends had left the group, and he began his studies at the Liverpool College of Art. The three guitarists, billing themselves at least three times as Johnny and the Moondogs, were playing rock and roll whenever they could find a drummer. Lennon's art school friend Stuart Sutcliffe, who had just sold one of his paintings and was persuaded to purchase a bass guitar, joined in January 1960, and it was he who suggested changing the band's name to Beatals, as a tribute to Buddy Holly and the Crickets. They used this name until May, when they became the Silver Beetles, before undertaking a brief tour of Scotland as the backing group for pop singer and fellow Liverpudlian Johnny Gentle.

Article: The Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine 2013      James E. Rothman, Randy W. Schekman, Thomas C. Südhof Share this:      English Swedish      Press Release      2013-10-07      The Nobel Assembly at Karolinska Institutet has today decided to award            The 2013 Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine      jointly to      James E. Rothman, Randy W. Schekman      and Thomas C. Südhof      for their discoveries of machinery regulating vesicle traffic,      a major transport system in our cells            Summary      The 2013 Nobel Prize honours three scientists who have solved the mystery of how the cell organizes its transport system. Each cell is a factory that produces and exports molecules. For instance, insulin is manufactured and released into the blood and signaling molecules called neurotransmitters are sent from one nerve cell to another. These molecules are transported around the cell in small packages called vesicles. The three Nobel Laureates have discovered the molecular principles that govern how this cargo is delivered to the right place at the right time in the cell.      Randy Schekman discovered a set of genes that were required for vesicle traffic. James Rothman unravelled protein machinery that allows vesicles to fuse with their targets to permit transfer of cargo. Thomas Südhof revealed how signals instruct vesicles to release their cargo with precision.      Through their discoveries, Rothman, Schekman and Südhof have revealed the exquisitely precise control system for the transport and delivery of cellular cargo. Disturbances in this system have deleterious effects and contribute to conditions such as neurological diseases, diabetes, and immunological disorders.            How cargo is transported in the cell      In a large and busy port, systems are required to ensure that the correct cargo is shipped to the correct destination at the right time. The cell, with its different compartments called organelles, faces a similar problem: cells produce molecules such as hormones, neurotransmitters, cytokines and enzymes that have to be delivered to other places inside the cell, or exported out of the cell, at exactly the right moment. Timing and location are everything. Miniature bubble-like vesicles, surrounded by membranes, shuttle the cargo between organelles or fuse with the outer membrane of the cell and release their cargo to the outside. This is of major importance, as it triggers nerve activation in the case of transmitter substances, or controls metabolism in the case of hormones. How do these vesicles know where and when to deliver their cargo?      Traffic congestion reveals genetic controllers      Randy Schekman was fascinated by how the cell organizes its transport system and in the 1970s decided to study its genetic basis by using yeast as a model system. In a genetic screen, he identified yeast cells with defective transport machinery, giving rise to a situation resembling a poorly planned public transport system. Vesicles piled up in certain parts of the cell. He found that the cause of this congestion was genetic and went on to identify the mutated genes. Schekman identified three classes of genes that control different facets of the cell´s transport system, thereby providing new insights into the tightly regulated machinery that mediates vesicle transport in the cell.      Docking with precision      James Rothman was also intrigued by the nature of the cell´s transport system. When studying vesicle transport in mammalian cells in the 1980s and 1990s, Rothman discovered that a protein complex enables vesicles to dock and fuse with their target membranes. In the fusion process, proteins on the vesicles and target membranes bind to each other like the two sides of a zipper. The fact that there are many such proteins and that they bind only in specific combinations ensures that cargo is delivered to a precise location. The same principle operates inside the cell and when a vesicle binds to the cell´s outer membrane to release its contents.      It turned out that some of the genes Schekman had discovered in yeast coded for proteins corresponding to those Rothman identified in mammals, revealing an ancient evolutionary origin of the transport system. Collectively, they mapped critical components of the cell´s transport machinery.      Timing is everything      Thomas Südhof was interested in how nerve cells communicate with one another in the brain. The signalling molecules, neurotransmitters, are released from vesicles that fuse with the outer membrane of nerve cells by using the machinery discovered by Rothman and Schekman. But these vesicles are only allowed to release their contents when the nerve cell signals to its neighbours. How is this release controlled in such a precise manner? Calcium ions were known to be involved in this process and in the 1990s, Südhof searched for calcium sensitive proteins in nerve cells. He identified molecular machinery that responds to an influx of calcium ions and directs neighbour proteins rapidly to bind vesicles to the outer membrane of the nerve cell. The zipper opens up and signal substances are released. Südhof´s discovery explained how temporal precision is achieved and how vesicles´ contents can be released on command.      Vesicle transport gives insight into disease processes      The three Nobel Laureates have discovered a fundamental process in cell physiology. These discoveries have had a major impact on our understanding of how cargo is delivered with timing and precision within and outside the cell. Vesicle transport and fusion operate, with the same general principles, in organisms as different as yeast and man. The system is critical for a variety of physiological processes in which vesicle fusion must be controlled, ranging from signalling in the brain to release of hormones and immune cytokines. Defective vesicle transport occurs in a variety of diseases including a number of neurological and immunological disorders, as well as in diabetes. Without this wonderfully precise organization, the cell would lapse into chaos.      James E. Rothman was born 1950 in Haverhill, Massachusetts, USA. He received his PhD from Harvard Medical School in 1976, was a postdoctoral fellow at Massachusetts Institute of Technology, and moved in 1978 to Stanford University in California, where he started his research on the vesicles of the cell. Rothman has also worked at Princeton University, Memorial Sloan-Kettering Cancer Institute and Columbia University. In 2008, he joined the faculty of Yale University in New Haven, Connecticut, USA, where he is currently Professor and Chairman in the Department of Cell Biology.      Randy W. Schekman was born 1948 in St Paul, Minnesota, USA, studied at the University of California in Los Angeles and at Stanford University, where he obtained his PhD in 1974 under the supervision of Arthur Kornberg (Nobel Prize 1959) and in the same department that Rothman joined a few years later. In 1976, Schekman joined the faculty of the University of California at Berkeley, where he is currently Professor in the Department of Molecular and Cell biology. Schekman is also an investigator of Howard Hughes Medical Institute.      Thomas C. Südhof was born in 1955 in Göttingen, Germany. He studied at the Georg-August-Universität in Göttingen, where he received an MD in 1982 and a Doctorate in neurochemistry the same year. In 1983, he moved to the University of Texas Southwestern Medical Center in Dallas, Texas, USA, as a postdoctoral fellow with Michael Brown and Joseph Goldstein (who shared the 1985 Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine). Südhof became an investigator of Howard Hughes Medical Institute in 1991 and was appointed Professor of Molecular and Cellular Physiology at Stanford University in 2008.

Americans James Rothman, 62, Randy Schekman, 64, and German-born Thomas Suedhof, 57, separately mapped out one of the body's critical networks in which tiny bubbles known as vesicles enable cells to secrete chemicals such as insulin into the surrounding environment.      This cellular machinery, which has evolved over a billion years, is so sensitive that slight malfunctions in the mechanism can cause serious illness or death.      \\"Through their discoveries, Rothman, Schekman and Suedhof have revealed the exquisitely precise control system for the transport and delivery of cellular cargo,\\" the Nobel Assembly at Sweden's Karolinska Institute said in a statement when awarding the prize of 8 million crowns (1.2 million).      Their research on how cells transport material around sheds light on how insulin, which controls blood sugar levels, is made and released into the blood at the right place at the right time. Diabetes and some brain disorders have been attributed at least in part to defects in the vesicle transport systems.      The scientists' work explains an \\"absolutely essential\\" component of cell biology that helps scientists understand how the brain or hormone secretion works, said Dr. Jeremy Berg, who for years worked as director of the National Institute of General Medical Sciences, a part of the National Institutes of Health, which underwrote much of the research.      \\"It's one of the prizes for which there is not a treatment that came out of it directly, but there are probably literally thousands of laboratories around the world whose work would not be taking place the way it is without their work,\\" said Berg, who is director of the Institute for Personalized Medicine at the University of Pittsburgh.      The Nobel committee said the work could help in understanding immuno-deficiency and brain disorders such as autism.      \\"HOW CELLS WORK\\"      \\"Their discoveries could perhaps have clinical implications in psychiatric diseases, but my guess is that they will be more useful for the understanding of how cells work,\\" said Professor Patrik Rorsman of Oxford University.      Schekman, a geneticist, first became interested in how proteins move within cells in 1974. At the University of California, Berkeley, he began working on yeast, a single cell microorganism. Research showed his findings applied equally to human cells.      Among Schekman's research aims is to study whether the accumulation of the protein amyloid in the brains of Alzheimer's disease patients is due to disruption of the vesicle system.      Suedhof, a neuroscientist, has focused particularly on the brain and questions of human thought and perception, emotions and actions determined by signaling between neurons, cells which constitute the foundation of the nervous system.      \\"My major interest is in trying to understand how neurons in the brain communicate - how these processes get established during development, and how they become impaired in autism and schizophrenia,\\" Suedhof said in an interview.      Suedhof said the work was really about \\"cell traffic,\\" the ability of cells to move material around.      Medicine is the first of the Nobel prizes awarded each year. Prizes for achievements in science, literature and peace were first awarded in 1901 in accordance with the will of dynamite inventor and businessman Alfred Nobel.      \\"My first reaction was, \`Oh, my god!\`\\" said Schekman, who was woken with the good news. \\"That was also my second reaction,\\" he added, according to a University of California, Berkeley, statement.      Schekman said in an interview that his work was born out of a desire to understand how it was possible for one cell to talk to the other. He said figuring that out would help deepen understanding of how the brain works, \\"one of the most important questions in biology today.\\"      Suedhof said while he and his fellow prize winners had worked separately they had met each other \\"many, many times.\\" They had \\"argued and sometimes agreed and sometimes disagreed,\\" he said with a laugh.

Eugene Hoshiko AP Photo Hypothesis: The Nikkei 25 will remain stable for the foreseeable future.","output":"Based on the context provided, we cannot definitively conclude that the Nikkei 225 will remain stable for the foreseeable future. First, it's important to note that the context only provides a snapshot of a particular day (September 3, 2018) and does not offer comprehensive information about the stock market or the factors that contribute to the performance of the Nikkei 225 index. Furthermore, the context states that Asian shares were mostly lower on that day due to escalating trade friction between the U.S. and Canada, and that the two countries have not yet come to a revised trade agreement. Thus, the political and economic uncertainty may have a bearing on the Nikkei 225 and other financial indices. Second, the stability of the Nikkei 225 is influenced by a multitude of factors, including domestic and international political developments, economic indicators, corporate performance, technological advancements, and investor sentiment. The context provided does not offer any indication of these factors and how they might be affecting the stability of the index. Third, stock markets are inherently volatile and unpredictable, and the performance of a particular index can change quickly in response to new information and unforeseen events. It would be difficult to predict with certainty that the Nikkei 225 will remain stable in the future based solely on the context provided. In conclusion, while the context mentions that Asian shares were mostly lower on the day due to trade friction between the U.S. and Canada and that negotiations between the two countries will continue throughout the week, it does not provide enough information to make a definitive statement about the future stability of the Nikkei 225.

News article: Chrysler Gets Judge's Approval for Asset Sale NEW YORK, June 1 -- The lightning-speed journey of Chrysler through bankruptcy court has come to a conclusion, with a federal judge approving the government-orchestrated sale of the American icon to a new company run by Italian carmaker Fiat. U.S. Bankruptcy Judge Arthur Gonzalez's ruling -- delivered in a 47-page opinion late last night -- effectively marked the end of an era for an American industry icon and represented a success for the Obama administration, which played a key role in crafting the company's restructuring strategy. \\"The Sale Motion is granted in its entirety,\\" Gonzalez wrote. The judge's decision came 31 days after Chrysler filed for bankruptcy, among the largest in U.S. history. The speed at which the case has proceeded might set a precedent for General Motors, which followed Chrysler into bankruptcy this morning. The case reached its high point last week when Chrysler urged Gonzalez -- in 34 hours of hearings over three days -- to approve its sale to an entity owned jointly by Fiat, the UAW and the U.S. and Canadian governments. More than 300 objections were filed, including those by lenders and dealers who tried to stop the sale by arguing that the process trampled their rights. Chairman and chief executive Robert Nardelli and other Chrysler executives, however, insisted it was the best and only viable option to avoid liquidation and save jobs. Gonzalez's decision -- the 3,073rd document filed in the case -- sided squarely with Chrysler. \\"Based upon the alternatives available -- and the only other alternative was liquidation -- the sale presented the best opportunity for preserving and maximizing the value of Chrysler's assets and the return to the various stakeholders,\\" he wrote. \\"The sale would strengthen Chrysler for the long-term, benefiting all constituents, including U.S. taxpayers, employees, creditors, dealers, suppliers and secured lenders. In the end, our sole aim was to benefit everyone.\\" A prominent objector to the sale has been a small group of first-lien lenders to Chrysler. Three Indiana pension and construction funds, which hold about 42 million of the 6.9 billion in senior secured loans, contend that their property rights were violated and that the 29 cents on the dollar they would recover under the terms of the government-orchestrated sale is less than what junior lenders would get. The UAW, for example would receive a 55 percent stake in the new Chrysler. The new entity would get most of Chrysler's assets in exchange for 2 billion, which would be distributed among the first-lien lenders. Fiat, which would manage the new Chrysler, is not putting up cash but will be providing technology for small, fuel-efficient vehicles, an area in which Chrysler has lagged its competitors. Gonzalez ruled that the Chrysler was getting \\"fair value for the assets being sold\\" and that \\"not one penny\\" of the value of Chrysler's assets is going to anyone other than the first-lien lenders. The Indiana funds promptly appealed the ruling this morning in U.S. District Court. The U.S. government has provided more than 8 billion in loans to Chrysler, which will largely be forgiven. The government will provide an additional 6 billion to the new Chrysler. The Indiana pension funds also contend that the federal government exerted undue influence over the sale. Gonzalez, however, said that the extent to which the government should be involved in protecting certain industries is \\"a political decision, and the Court does not express a view as to the governmental entities' involvement here.\\" \\"The economic reality is that no one was willing to lend other than the governmental entities,\\" he said. \\"Further, in the current economic climate, the only alternative would be an immediate liquidation, which the evidence has shown would not bring a higher return to creditors.\\" Objections filed by many of the 787 dealers that will be eliminated are to be heard further in a hearing Thursday. But Gonzalez's ruling portends an uphill battle for the dealers. The underlying argument of many opposing the transaction, Gonzalez noted, is not against the federal government's involvement but the desire to have it protect every stakeholder from economic loss -- not just those that the government perceives as being essential to the survival of a successful new Chrysler. \\"For example, any dealership rejection that is approved will cause hardship to the particular dealership involved but may well be necessary if New Chrysler is to survive,\\" he wrote. \\"These are the kinds of economic decisions that have to be made in every bankruptcy case.\\" Like Chrysler, GM is seeking a quick sale of most of its assets to a \\"new GM,\\" in which the U.S. government will have a 60 percent stake. The transaction \\"will enable New GM to become an engine of opportunity and prosperity for countless Americans,\\" GM's chief executive, Frederick A. Henderson, said in a 98-page court document filed this morning. The alternative, he said, was liquidation and a loss of hundreds of thousands of jobs.

At the core it is really hot. All that heat tries to rise toward the surface. In the Mantle, the rock is partially melted and is able to move. As it is heated, the material in the mantle moves toward the surface. As the mantle material rises, it cools. When it reaches the Earths crust, it is mostly stopped. A little of the material can break through the surface, but not all. Instead, it begins to move horizontally. The mantle material moves horizontally away from a mid-ocean ridge crest. Toward the surface, the mantle material starts to cool. As it cools it sinks back down into the mantle. These areas are where deep sea trench occur. The material sinks back down to the core.

Lara finds this orb, as well as a strange medallion; but both are stolen by the crime lord Chen Lo (Simon Yam). Lara (Angelina Jolie) only just manages to escape as a subsequent earthquake causes the Luna Temple to collapse, while her two companions are killed by Chen's men. Lara is tasked by MI6 to find Pandora's Box, an object from ancient legends that supposedly contains a deadly plague, before Nobel Prize-winning scientist turned bio-terrorist Jonathan Reiss (Ciarán Hinds) can get his hands on it. The key to finding the box, which is hidden in the mysterious Cradle of Life, is a magical luminous sphere that serves as a map, the one stolen by Chen Lo in Santorini, who plans to sell the sphere to Reiss. To help her track down Chen Lo and the ball, Lara recruits an old lover, Terry Sheridan (Gerard Butler), a former mercenary and Royal Marine, who was in prison in the Republic of Kazakhstan.Among the action sequences that take place during this time are Lara and Terry's entry into China, a fight scene in suburban Shanghai, and a leap off the then-under-construction International Finance Centre skyscraper in Hong Kong, using special winged flight-suits that Terry had arranged for, landing on a ship out in the Kowloon Bay after taking the Orb from Reiss.

Peace and Prosperity: After years of government propaganda predicting the worst atrocities, most Japanese civilians were surprised at the warmth and friendliness of the occupying forces. The postwar period began, however, with millions of displaced people homeless and starving. To counter a perceived communist threat from the Soviet Union, the US quickly set to work reconstructing the economy by transforming Japan's institutions and devising a new pacifist constitution. Article 9 renounced Japan's right to maintain armed forces, although the ambiguous wording was later taken to permit the creati on of a \\"self-defense\\" force. The zaibatsu conglomerates that had proved so instrumental in boosting Japan's militarism were disbanded, later to re-emerge as the keiretsu trading conglomerates that dominated the economy once again. The entire economy received a massive jump-start with the outbreak of the Korean War, with Japan ironically becoming the chief local supplier for an army it had battled so furiously just a few years earlier. The occupation lasted until 1952, having already planted the seeds for Japan's future stunning economic success. Economic output was back to prewar levels, and British auto companies provided the support needed to get Japan's auto industry back on its feet. Japanese companies then enthusiastically imported any Western technologies they could get their hands on. This included transistor technology — invented in the US but then considered to have only limited applications — for the surreal sum of 25,000. It was Japan that produced the world's first transistor radio. The electronic technology spurt that followed is now legendary. Parliamentary democracy finally came into its own, albeit with distinctly Japanese characteristics reflecting the dislike of debate and confrontation and the group-oriented preference for maintaining the appearance of harmony at all times. The government, through the powerful Finance Ministry and Ministry of International Trade and Industry, generously supported favored private corporations: first shipping, then cars, then electronics firms basked in the warmth of the government's loving attentions. Japan overtook Britain economically in 1964. By the end of the decade, Japan's was the third largest economy in the world — less then two decades after the war had left the country in ruins. Prosperity was not without its own problems: pollution caused by \\"dirty\\" industries, a high incidence of stomach ulcers (even suicides) among schoolchildren pressured by over-ambitious parents, and the awkward questions of what to do about nuclear energy. The famous coziness among politicians, bureaucrats, and private companies, together with the strong cultural emphasis on relationship-building and a lack of transparency and accountability, eventually led to corrupt practices of endemic proportions.

It was the subject of some meetings with ubuntu-women, something I have discussed with my friend Sulamita in a Brazilian bar at 4.30am and the subject of various ad-hoc discussions at the Ubuntu Developer Summit. As the wider Open Source community grows, it becomes more of an issue every day, and something we all need to be aware of. While in Brazil I made a promise to Sulamita that I would be blogging about the issue of discrimination against women, and I have been holding off writing an entry until I had some real, practical, implementable steps that I can advise people to take to help make the situation better. Although I will never fully understand how some women are made to feel at the hands of such discrimination, I have been hoping my contribution could be to help contribute to an awareness of the issue, and for that to happen I felt I needed to construct some doable steps that people can execute. Solving social problems is hard though, which ain’t all that surprising, so I had held off on a blog post until I had some such action points. I have since discovered that there is really one key step that we all need take – don’t accept or allow discrimination in your community. In my mind all discrimination is bad. Every day people get up and are discriminated due to gender, age, race, mobility, technical knowledge and more. The issues of discrimination, while different in the specifics (e.g. women are discriminated in different ways to age discrimination), the underlying issue is very similar – mistreating people because of a grouping they are part of. We have all suffered this in different ways, from serious racial hatred to someone not taking you seriously because you have long hair and an Iron Maiden t-shirt. Question: When did they start thinking a lot about discrimination? Options: - While in Brazil - not enough information - While blogging - Just recently Answer:","output":"Just recently"},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant. You will be given a task.

Traditionally considered the last part of the Stone Age, the Neolithic followed the terminal Holocene Epipaleolithic period and commenced with the beginning of farming, which produced the \\"Neolithic Revolution\\". It ended when metal tools became widespread (in the Copper Age or Bronze Age; or, in some geographical regions, in the Iron Age). The Neolithic is a progression of behavioral and cultural characteristics and changes, including the use of wild and domestic crops and of domesticated animals.  The beginning of the Neolithic culture is considered to be in the Levant (Jericho, modern-day West Bank) about 10,200 – 8,800 BC. It developed directly from the Epipaleolithic Natufian culture in the region, whose people pioneered the use of wild cereals, which then evolved into true farming. The Natufian period was between 12,000 and 10,200 BC, and the so-called \\"proto-Neolithic\\" is now included in the Pre-Pottery Neolithic (PPNA) between 10,200 and 8,800 BC. As the Natufians had become dependent on wild cereals in their diet, and a sedentary way of life had begun among them, the climatic changes associated with the Younger Dryas are thought to have forced people to develop farming. 1.

A:","output":"The perturbation hypothesis you mentioned involves two separate processes - one is the process of human life and reproduction, while the other is related to the coal industry. These two processes are not directly linked, so it would be incorrect to assume that an increase in coal on a conveyor belt would directly affect the formation of zygotes. However, there could be potential indirect effects. For example, an increase in coal production and usage could result in increased air pollution. If this pollution affects the health of individuals living near the coal plants, it might lower their chances of successful reproduction, possibly leading to fewer zygotes formed. This effect, though, would not be directly caused by the coal on the conveyor belt but rather by the subsequent pollution and its impacts on human health.

What is the solution?","output":"To help you understand this math problem, let's break it down step by step. We have the equation -59*w -10*w -69 = 0. First, we need to combine the terms with \\"w\\" in them. That'd be like collecting similar toys together. -59*w and -10*w are both \\"w\\" terms, so we can add them together: -59*w + (-10*w) = -69*w Now our equation looks like this: -69*w - 69 = 0 Next, we want to get \\"w\\" by itself. Let's get rid of the -69 in front of the \\"w\\". Imagine that we are sharing candies equally among friends. To cancel out that -69, we can add 69 to both sides of the equation: -69*w - 69 + 69 = 0 + 69 Now we have: -69*w = 69 To solve for \\"w\\", we need to divide both sides of the equation by -69. It's like splitting the candies equally to find out how many candies each person gets: w = 69 / -69 When we divide those numbers, we get: w = -1 So the solution for the math problem is w = -1. It means when you replace \\"w\\" by \\"-1\\" the equation will be true."},{"instruction":"Given the below context:  Dr. Jan Żabiński is director of the Warsaw Zoo, one of the largest in 1930s Europe, assisted by his wife, Antonina.

Fart lighting Fart lighting, also known as pyroflatulence or flatus ignition, is the practice of igniting the gases produced by human flatulence, often producing a flame of a blue hue, hence the act being known colloquially as a \`\`blue angel'', \`\`blue dart'', or in Australia, a \`\`blue flame''. The fact that flatus is flammable, and the actual combustion of it through this practice, gives rise to much humorous derivation. Other colors of flame such as orange and yellow are possible with the color dependent on the mixture of gases formed in the colon. In order to \`\`fire fart'', one must have a fart prepared in the anal cavity, and a lighter at the ready. Then they fart onto the lighter. Is this statement correct \\"can you start a fire with a fart\\"?","output":"Yes, the statement \\"can you start a fire with a fart\\" is technically correct, as human flatulence contains flammable gases such as methane and hydrogen. When these gases are expelled and come in contact with an open flame (like a lighter), they can ignite, producing a flame. However, it's important to note that attempting to \\"fire fart\\" is extremely dangerous and can result in severe burns or other injuries. It is not recommended to try this at any time. Safety should always be a top priority."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant. You should describe the task and explain your answer.

A Radically Modern Quilt and Bookends Inspired by the Cosmos FOR A NEW COLLECTION of modern quilts, Oklahoma-born, Rhode Island-based designer Meg Callahan took inspiration from the sprawling skies of the American West. “I went on lots of road trips as a kid,” said Ms. Callahan, whose pieces bring a restless, contemporary edge to the sometimes fusty world of needlework. But on “Knot,” her latest meticulously hand-sewn composition, Ms. Callahan, 26, seems to have been studying not sky but highway; ribbons of stitching flow across the surface like invitations to a nightly journey. The project was a liberating left turn from the angular patchwork styles she typically produces. “This was a chance to explore,” she said. “In quilts, there aren’t many curves.” Hawkins New York + Meg Callahan Knot Quilt, 450 for queen size, preorder at hawkinsnewyork.com Jewelry designer Lara Bohinc has always been interested in outer space—she’s made a bangle that referenced planetary orbits and a ring that paid homage to the Apollo space mission. In her new five-piece collection for Swedish home accessories brand Skultuna, celestial inspiration again finds its way into her work. This time, she said, the result is a pair of luminous brass bookends on which an etched pattern alludes to a solar eclipse, with loops interrupting radiant orbs. “Ancient man always had this fascination with the planets,” said the London-based designer, 42. “It’s the most basic shape.” The pieces will be available at Barneys New York beginning this month.

You see, Kyle and Leslie were two little kids who loved to play outside in their neighborhood. One day, they found a lost dog who was very dirty and smelly. Kyle thought the dog was stinky because the dog hadn't had a bath in a long time. He looked at the dog and made a face, like how we sometimes do when we smell something bad. But Leslie, she didn't mind the smell at all, because she loved animals so much, especially dogs. She thought the dog was really cute and friendly, and wanted to help it find its home. She didn't care about the smell, because she believed that having friends and helping them was more important than how they smelled. So, together, Kyle and Leslie decided to help the stinky dog. They went around their neighborhood, asking people if they knew who the dog belonged to. They walked and walked, showing the dog to everyone they met. Sometimes, Kyle would hold his nose because of the smell, but he still wanted to help. As they were walking, they saw a lady who was looking around as if she was searching for something. When she saw the dog, her face lit up with happiness. The lady ran towards them and hugged the dog tightly. She was the dog's owner and had been looking for her lost pet for a long time. She thanked Kyle and Leslie for finding her dog and helping it return home. She then took the dog to give it a nice, warm bath so it would smell nice and clean – and not stinky anymore. Kyle and Leslie waved goodbye to the dog and its owner, feeling very happy that they were able to help a friend and learn a valuable lesson about friendship and kindness."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Please answer the following question: Information:  - Six by Seven (also written as SIX.BY SEVEN or six.by seven or six.byseven) are a Nottingham-based indie rock band who originally consisted of Chris Olley on vocals and guitars, James Flower on keyboards, Sam Hempton on guitar, Paul Douglas on bass and Chris Davis on drums. Exponents of building, atmospheric drone-rock, influenced heavily by bands such as My Bloody Valentine and Spacemen 3 they found a niche in the industry with a considerable underground following, but despite some attempts to commercialise their sound, this never crossed over into mainstream success. After splitting up in 2008, the band reformed in 2012 with Olley and Flower the only original members.  - Spacemen 3 were an English alternative rock band, formed in 1982 in Rugby, Warwickshire by Peter Kember and Jason Pierce. Their music was \\"colourfully mind-altering, but not in the sense of the acid rock of the 1960s; instead, the band developed its own minimalistic psychedelia\\" (Stephen Erlewine, \\"AllMusic\\"). Spacemen 3 came to prominence on the independent music scene around 1989, gaining a cult following. However, they disbanded shortly afterwards, releasing their final studio album post-split in 1991 after an acrimonious parting of ways. They gained a reputation as a drug band due to the members drug taking habits and the candid interviews and outspoken views of Kember about recreational drug use. Kember and Pierce were the only members common to all line-ups of the band. Both founding members have enjoyed considerable success with their respective subsequent projects; Sonic Boom/Spectrum and Spiritualized.  - Club Sandwich at the Peveril Hotel was the final release by Six by Seven , made after the group disbanded . Following the split in late 2005 , 3 original members of the band ( Chris Olley , James Flower and Chris Davis ) formed a new band ( tentatively called ' Collision ' ) with two additional members ( Ady Fletcher and Tony ' Doggen ' Foster ) , with the hope of developing a new sound . Understandably , the sessions ended up sounding like Six by Seven , and so the recordings were released under that moniker .  - Indie rock is a genre of alternative rock that originated in the United States and the United Kingdom in the 1980s. Indie rock encapsulates indie pop and lo-fi, among others. Originally used to describe record labels, the term became associated with the music they produced and was initially used interchangeably with alternative rock. As grunge and punk revival bands in the US, and then Britpop bands in the UK, broke into the mainstream in the 1990s, it came to be used to identify those acts that retained an outsider and underground perspective. In the 2000s, as a result of changes in the music industry and the growing importance of the Internet, some indie rock acts began to enjoy commercial success, leading to questions about its meaningfulness as a term.  - Paul Howard Douglas (March 26, 1892  September 24, 1976) was an American politician and Georgist economist. A member of the Democratic Party, he served as a U.S. Senator from Illinois for eighteen years, from 1949 to 1967. During his Senate career, he was a prominent member of the liberal coalition.  - Nottingham is a city and unitary authority area in Nottinghamshire, England, located south of Sheffield and north of Leicester.  - Chris Olley is a Nottingham based musician and photographer. He was the lead singer and guitarist for Six By Seven and also the band's main creative influence. He studied art at Wakefield College (199091) and gained a BA (Hons)in Photography at Nottingham Trent University (199194). It was at his time at University that Olley met Sam Hempton and together they formed six.byseven.

What is the solution to this math problem? Solve 18*s + 40*s = -880 + 68 for s.","output":"Alright! Here is the step-by-step solution to the equation. The equation you've provided is:  18s + 40s = -880 + 68. Let's break it down step-by-step: Step 1: Simplify the equation on both sides where possible. On the left side of the equation, you have 18s + 40s.  These are like terms because they have the same variable \\"s,\\" and thus can be combined. 18s + 40s equals 58s On the right side of the equation, you have -880 + 68. These are constants and can be combined as well. -880 + 68 equals -812 So after simplification, your equation now is:  58s = -812 Step 2: Solve the equation to find the value of \\"s\\". Because our equation 58s = -812 is multiplication (58 multiplied by some number s equals -812), we will solve this using division. You will isolate s by dividing both sides of the equation by 58: s = -812 / 58 Step 3: The final calculation to get the value of \\"s\\".  s = -14  So, the solution to the equation is s = -14."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

If your visual impairment is preexisting, and you have recently hired a new employee, you may wonder when the best time is to discuss this disability. The longer you wait, the more you open the door for potential confusion or run the risk of your other employees disclosing your disability for you.","output":"Therefore, arguably, the best time to share this information is during the orientation period. During this time, new employees are usually in the process of learning about the business, the workplace culture, and their specific roles.  Informing them about your visual impairment early on can increase their understanding of your unique situation while avoiding any misconceptions that might surface if they observe any unusual interactions. Moreover, an early disclosure can foster openness and trust between you and your new employee, which are essential factors in building a strong working relationship. Begin by explaining your condition.  When talking about your visual disability, start by explaining what it is. State your condition directly - this could be anything from loss of peripheral vision to total blindness. Keep in mind that the employee may not be familiar with your specific kind of visual impairment, so try to describe it in layman's terms.  For instance, if you have retinitis pigmentosa, which affects your peripheral vision, you could say, \\"I have a condition called retinitis pigmentosa, which means that I don't see things that are on the sides or corners. It's kind of like looking through a tunnel.\\" Keeping your explanation clear and straightforward can promote understanding and empathy. Discuss the nature of your vision impairment with clarity, and specify how and to what extent it affects your daily functioning and work performance. However, also reassure them that despite your disability, you are fully capable of performing your roles and responsibilities. Describe specifics about your daily work life. Offer practical examples of how you manage your daily tasks within the workplace given your condition. This will give your employee a clear picture of what your work routine looks like and how their work will intersect with yours. You can talk about the tools and techniques you use, such as using screen reading software or having documents printed in large font sizes.  Discuss potential challenges and your coping strategies. Once your employee has a basic understanding of your visual disability, it might be helpful to discuss possible challenges that can occur in the workplace as a result of your condition. Mention any specific scenarios that might be relevant to your roles and responsibilities and disclose how you manage them effectively. Your transparency will encourage your employees to approach these situations with understanding and flexibility. More importantly, it can teach them how to best support you in these scenarios, fostering a more cooperative and harmonious work environment. Encourage questions and provide opportunities for open dialogue. Remember, your discussion should not be a one-way street. After you share information about your visual disability, create opportunities for the employee to offer their thoughts or ask questions. This will encourage open dialogue and facilitate a deeper understanding of your condition.  The process of engaging in such a conversation might seem daunting, but it has many benefits, including promoting inclusivity, fostering empathy, and building understanding. Being proactive and open about your visual impairment can create a bond of trust and respect between you and your employees, ultimately fostering a supportive and inclusive work environment.  In conclusion, there is no one-size-fits-all approach to discussing your visual impairment with your employees. The information above provides a general guideline, but you should tailor your conversation to the specific needs of your business and the individual employee."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant that follows instruction extremely well.

That was before we entered the permissive period in education in which we decided it was all right not to push our children to achieve their best in school. The schools and the educators made it easy for us. They taught that it was all right to be parents who take a let-alone policy. We stopped making our children do homework. We gave them calculators, turned on the television, left the teaching to the teachers and went on vacation. Now teachers, faced with children who have been developing at their own pace for the past 15 years, are realizing we've made a terrible mistake. One such teacher is Sharon Clomps who says of her students--\\"so passive\\" --and wonders what has happened. Nothing is demanded of them, she believes. Television, says Clomps, contributes to children's passivity. \\"We're talking about a generation of kids who' vet never been hurt or hungry. They have learned somebody will always do it for them, instead of saying 'go and look it up', you tell them the answer. It takes greater energy to say no to a kid.\\" Yes, it does. It takes energy and it takes work. It's time for parents to end their vacation and come back to work.

Please answer the following question: If you’ve ever seen travel photos of Venice or been to Venice yourself, you’re probably familiar with the Rialto Bridge. The Ponte di Rialto is one of the most popular tourist destinations in Venice and one of the most iconic landmarks of the Italian city. Even in 1594, when the bridge was only recently completed, a British traveler called it the “eighth wonder of the world.” The version of the bridge that most people know was built between 1588 and 1591, but there’s been a bridge in this location since around 1180. The Rialto Bridge was the first bridge to cross the Grand Canal, and until the 1800s it remained the only bridge across Venice’s major waterway. The Rialto district was the main commercial hub of Venice and people increasingly needed access to buy and sell goods. The first bridge built at this site was a pontoon bridge that was eventually replaced by a wooden bridge in 1264. This wooden bridge was destroyed and rebuilt several times: it burned down during an unsuccessful coup in 1310, and in 1444 collapsed under the weight of a crowd watching a boat parade during a wedding. Its last collapse came in 1524, and by then Venice decided it was time to build a more permanent and durable bridge. Beginning in 1525, many architects submitted designs for the Rialto Bridge, but none of them was unanimously selected for the commission. The elected council overseeing the bridge’s construction deliberated and consulted several local builders to figure out how they could erect a stone bridge across the wide Grand Canal. They had a few limitations to consider: the sloped shores on either side, the need for boats to be able to pass underneath, and the practicality of having shops atop the bridge. Andrea Palladio’s design for the Rialto Bridge, published in his architectural treatise, Quattro libri, in 1570, featured three arches that would have prevented larger boats from passing under the bridge. Although his design utilized an appealing classical aesthetic, it was rejected in favor of Antonio Da Ponte’s. how long the problem lasted: - not enough information - 150 years - 250 years - 200 years A:","output":"To determine the duration of the problem (finding a suitable design for the Rialto Bridge), we must identify when the process began and when it was resolved.

A Great Western Railway train traveling from Westbury to Weymouth almost collided with the vehicle, narrowly avoiding a catastrophic accident. The Rail Accident Investigation Branch (RAIB) found that miscommunication between the driver and a signaller played a key role in the incident.  Upon noticing the tractor starting to cross the tracks, the train driver promptly sounded the horn, applied the emergency brake, and managed to stop the train 450 meters past the crossing. CCTV footage from the train revealed that the tractor and trailer cleared the line just as the train was approximately 30 meters away from the crossing.

Consequently, the train had not passed the crossing when the tractor driver called the signaller to inquire if it was safe to proceed. Due to the miscommunication, the signaller incorrectly assumed that the train had already crossed and authorized the tractor driver to proceed without verifying the train's actual position.

Translate this to English?","output":"SETimes: What are the main issues that fathers face if they want to actively participate in their child's life? The main issues that fathers may face when desiring to actively participate in their child's life can be summarized in several key areas: 1. Societal expectations and gender roles: There is still a perception in some societies that the mother should be the primary caregiver and nurturer, while the father's role is to provide financial support. This stereotype can create barriers for fathers who wish to take an active role in their child's upbringing and may face criticism or resistance from their social circle or even the child's mother. 2. Legal challenges: In cases of separation or divorce, fathers may face legal challenges in obtaining custody or sufficient visitation rights, which can prevent them from fully participating in their child's life. Courts may still be biased towards granting primary custody to mothers, especially when the child is young, and this can lead to fathers having limited access to their children. 3. Work-life balance: Fathers in full-time employment may struggle to balance work commitments with their desire to be actively involved in their child's life. Long working hours, lack of flexible work arrangements, and minimal parental leave policies for fathers can contribute to the difficulty in achieving a proper work-life balance. 4. Lack of support networks: Mothers often have access to a wide range of support networks, such as mothers' clubs, playgroups, and other parenting resources. Fathers, on the other hand, may have limited access to similar support networks and can feel isolated or unsure of how best to engage with their children. 5. Feeling of inadequacy or lack of experience: Some fathers may feel insecure about their ability to nurture and care for their children, especially if they lack experience or knowledge in child-rearing. This can lead to feelings of inadequacy and self-doubt about their role as a father, potentially resulting in reduced involvement with their child. 6. Financial pressure: Fathers who want to dedicate more time to their children may experience financial stress as a result of reduced working hours or increased childcare costs. This can further discourage fathers from actively participating in their child's life. 7. Co-parenting challenges: In cases where parents are co-parenting or separated, fathers may experience difficulties in establishing a positive and cooperative relationship with their child's mother, which can limit their ability to be involved in their child's upbringing. Addressing these issues requires joint efforts from both individuals and societies to create more supportive environments for fathers, challenge traditional gender roles, and promote equitable parenting opportunities for both parents. This can give fathers the chance to actively participate in their children's lives and contribute to their well-being and overall development."},{"instruction":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

Without bullies and nerds, studios would have nothing to offer the PG-13 crowd except for superheroes and terminal illness. Unfortunately, “The DUFF” doesn’t rise to the level of genre standouts such as “Carrie,” “Heathers,” and “Mean Girls.” In fact, if recent film history were a high school cafeteria, “The DUFF” would probably be sharing a table with such wannabes as “Revenge of the Nerds,” “Drillbit Taylor,” and Adam Sandler. The title is an acronym for “Designated Ugly Fat Friend,” referring to the unfortunates who make the people they hang out with look better. Here the DUFF is Bianca (Mae Whitman, known to many as Amber Holt on TV’s “Parenthood”) and it comes as a surprise to her when someone indiscreetly tells her, because she is neither fat nor ugly and she doesn’t want to be designated as anything. As she points out in her opening voiceover, she hates labels. Needless to say, such a film can’t operate without labels, or in this case hashtags – for example, Bianca’s friend Casey (Bianca Santos) is #thetoughone (as noted by the film’s overly cute graphics) because she’s athletic, sticks up for her friends, and doesn’t take guff from anyone. As for Bianca, with her good grades, taste for horror movies, dry wit, and a wardrobe featuring flannel shirts and bib overalls, she falls in somewhere between #weirdo and #dork. At times, given Whitman’s spunky performance (an unlikely combination of Ellen Page and Melissa McCarthy), she sometimes resembles an actual character. But when she makes the shocking discovery that others label her a DUFF, Bianca rebels, striking out inappropriately at Casey and her other BFF, Jess (Skyler Samuels), going so far as to unfriend them on Facebook and unfollow them on Twitter (this film exemplifies the ill effect social media is having on movies). Fumbling for a non-DUFF identity, she turns to her former childhood friend and current school stud Wesley (Robbie Amell), a.k.a. #manwhore, for a makeover. In the process she angers Wesley’s prom queen ex-girlfriend Madison (Bella Thorne), who loves to label people and is a master of that suicide-inducing, side-splitting comedy favorite, cyber bullying. The scenes between Whitman and Santos stir with an unfulfilled frisson and a frothy erotic potential but then the characters settle again into their hashtags, smothered by bad writing, Sandel’s sleepwalking direction, and a nonstop, inane soundtrack. Pros like Ken Jeong, Chris Wylde, and Allison Janney make the most of it (especially in the wacky outtakes at the end), but in the end we learn that everyone is a DUFF for someone.

But also a question for economists, argued Kenneth Boulding, a British economist, in an essay published in 1966. We have run our economies, he warned, like cowboys on the open grassland: taking and using the world's resources, confident that more lies over the horizon. But the Earth is less a grassland than a spaceship--a closed system, alone in space, carrying limited supplies. We need, said Boulding, an economics that takes seriously the idea of environmental limits. In the half century since his essay, a new movement has responded to his challenge. \\"Ecological economists\\", as they call themselves, want to revolutionise its aims and assumptions. What do they say--and will their ideas achieve lift-off? To its advocators, ecological economics is neither ecology nor economics, but a mix of both. Their starting point is to recognise that the human economy is part of the natural world. Our environment, they note, is both a source of resources and a sink for wastes. But it is ignored in conventional textbooks, where neat diagrams trace the flows between firms, households and the government as though nature did not exist. That is a mistake, say ecological economists. There are two ways our economies can grow, ecological economists point out: through technological change, or through more intensive use of resources. Only the former, they say, is worth having. They are suspicious of GDP, a crude measure which does not take account of resource exhaustion, unpaid work, and countless other factors. In its place they advocate moreholistic  approaches, such as the Genuine Progress Indicator (GPI), a composite index  that includes things like the cost of pollution, deforestation and car accidents. While GDP has kept growing, global GPI per person peaked in 1978: by destroying our environment we are making ourselves poorer, not richer.

If you still have the liquid you cooked the pumpkins in, this can be reused. Otherwise, boil about 4 pints (2 liters) of fresh water. Use your hands or a large spoon. Do not mash the cubes into the jar. Instead, allow them to sit somewhat loosely. Leave about 1 inch (2.5 cm) of headspace or empty space in between the pumpkins and the top of the jar. Pour the water slowly to prevent it from splashing out and to allow it to fill the empty spaces in between the cubes of pumpkin. Make sure that approximately 1 inch (2.5 cm) of empty headspace still remains in each jar. Make sure that the lids are screwed on securely. If the lids are too loose, you will not be able to create a seal during the canning process. Heat the water to boiling. You must use a pressure canner when canning pumpkin. Use jar tongs to carefully place the jars on the rack inside the canner. Do not allow the jars to clink together as you move them. If the jars do collide, they may crack. Put the heat on high while the pressure valve is still open. Allow the steam to escape through this vent for ten minutes to purge the air inside. Close all the valves to allow pressure to build inside the canner. You will also need to set the weight, but the amount of weight will vary depending the time of pressure canner used as well as your present altitude.  If using a dial-gauge pressure canner, set the weight to 11 lb (4.99 kg)for altitudes up to 2000 feet (609.6 m). Add 1 lb (0.45 kg) of weight for every additional 2000 feet (609.6 m), stopping at 14 lb (6.35 kg). If using a weighted-gauge pressure canner, set the weight to 10 lb (4.54 kg) for altitudes up to 1000 feet (304.8 m). For any higher altitude, set the weight to 15 lb (6.8 kg). If using quart-size (liter-size) jars, however, you will need to process the pumpkin for 90 minutes. Turn off the heat after the jars have finished processing. After the pressure drops to zero, wait three additional minutes and open the vent to release the steam. Open the canner and lift the jars out with jar tongs. Set them to dry and cool in a draft-free area. Do not allow them to touch or bump into each other. After the jars have cooled overnight, press on the center of each lid to check the seal. If it does not move, the jars have been sealed properly. If the center button \\"pops\\" or moves up and down when pressed, the jars have not been sealed and are not safe for long-term storage.

And they tried many methods to try to straighten the tower, but nothing seemed to work. That was, until one day when the same little girl was walking up again, and she put her arm on the side of the tower to rest. She felt the tower shaking slightly. When she took her hand off it, the movement stopped. And when she put it back on again, the same thing happened. The girl spent a while doing this, until she was completely certain of what she had discovered: \\" The tower is ticklish ( ) !\\" She ran to get some plants, and she planted them right next to the tower. Now if the tower leant over any further it would be tickled by the leaves of those plants. Being a ticklish tower, it would then return to where it had been. In this way, the girl managed to make sure that the tower didn't fall down, but still kept it leaning a little. The fact that it was leaning made it even more famous, and this taught a fine lesson to the envious people of the neighboring city.

He was a member of the orchestra engaged for a performance of Saint-Saëns's oratorio La lyre et la harpe, to be conducted by the composer. At the last minute Saint-Saëns judged the player engaged for the important and difficult organ part to be inadequate and, as a celebrated virtuoso organist, decided to play it himself. He asked the orchestra if any of them could take over as conductor; there was a chorus of \\"Oui – Monteux!\\". With great trepidation, Monteux conducted the orchestra and soloists including the composer, sight-reading the score, and was judged a success.Monteux's musical career was interrupted in 1896, when he was called up for military service. As a graduate of the Conservatoire, one of France's grandes écoles, he was required to serve only ten months rather than the three years generally required. He later described himself as \\"the most pitifully inadequate soldier that the 132nd Infantry had ever seen\\". He had inherited from his mother not only her musical talent but her short and portly build and was physically unsuited to soldiering.Returning to Paris after discharge, Monteux resumed his career as a violist. Hans Richter invited him to lead the violas in the Bayreuth Festival orchestra, but Monteux could not afford to leave his regular work in Paris. In December 1900 Monteux played the solo viola part in Berlioz's Harold in Italy, rarely heard in Paris at the time, with the Colonne Orchestra conducted by Felix Mottl. In 1902 he secured a junior conducting post at the Dieppe casino, a seasonal appointment for the summer months which brought him into contact with leading musicians from the Paris orchestras and well-known soloists on vacation. By 1907 he was the principal conductor at Dieppe, in charge of operas and orchestral concerts. As an orchestral conductor he modelled his technique on that of Arthur Nikisch, under whose baton he had played, and who was his ideal conductor.  answer the following question:  What is the last name of the person that conducted the December 1900 performance where the man who was called up for military service in 1896 played solo viola? A:","output":"The last name of the person that conducted the December 1900 performance where the man who was called up for military service in 1896 played solo viola is Mottl.

Ventura was born James George Janos on July 15, 1951 in Minneapolis, Minnesota, the son of George William Janos and his wife, Bernice Martha (nee Lenz). Both of his parents were World War II veterans. Ventura has an older brother who served in the Vietnam War. Ventura has described himself as Slovak, since his father's parents were from what is now Slovakia; his mother was of German descent. After the legislature refused to increase spending for security, Ventura attracted criticism when he decided not to live in the governor's mansion during his tenure, choosing instead to shut it down and stay at his home in Maple Grove. Critics pointed to the loss of jobs for several working-class people at the mansion and the extra cost of reopening the mansion later.  In 1999, a group of disgruntled citizens petitioned to recall Governor Ventura, alleging, among other things, that \\"the use of state security personnel to protect the governor on a book promotion tour constituted illegal use of state property for personal gain.\\" The petition was denied. The proposed petition was dismissed by order of the Chief Justice of the Supreme Court of Minnesota. Under Minnesota law, a proposed petition for recall is required to be reviewed by the Chief Justice for legal sufficiency, and, upon such review, the Chief Justice determined that it did not allege the commission of any act that violated Minnesota law. Ventura sought attorney's fees as a sanction for the filing of a frivolous petition for recall, but that request was denied, on the ground that there was no statutory authority for such an award.  In November 2011, Ventura held a press conference in relation to a lawsuit he had filed against the Transportation Security Administration. During that press conference, Ventura stated that he would \\"never stand for a national anthem again, I will turn my back and raise a fist the same way Tommy Smith and John Carlos did in the '68 Olympics, Jesse Ventura will do that today.\\"  During his tenure as governor, Ventura drew frequent fire from the press in the Twin Cities. He referred to reporters as \\"media jackals,\\" a term that even appeared on the press passes required to enter the governor's press area. Shortly after Ventura's election as governor, author and humorist Garrison Keillor wrote a satirical book about the event, spoofing Ventura as \\"Jimmy (Big Boy) Valente,\\" a self-aggrandizing former \\"Navy W.A.L.R.U.S. (Water Air Land Rising Up Suddenly)\\" turned professional wrestler turned politician. Initially, Ventura responded angrily to the satire, but later, in a conciliatory vein, said that Keillor \\"makes Minnesota proud\\". During his term, Ventura appeared on the Late Show with David Letterman, in which he responded controversially to the following question: \\"So which is the better city of the Twin Cities, Minneapolis or St. Paul?\\". Ventura responded, \\"Minneapolis. Those streets in St. Paul must have been designed by drunken Irishmen\\". He later apologized for the remark, adding that it was not intended to be taken seriously.

(CNN) -- In my travels around the world I have noted how attitudes toward women are a pretty accurate weather vane indicating what is happening in the wider politics of a country.

Question: Why did Fritz Shimon Haber's wife suicided? Title: Haber Movie plot: Fritz Shimon Haber [4] was a German-born scientist and professor of Jewish origin with one of the most extraordinary dual legacies in history. On the one hand, his revolutionary process for creating synthetic fertilizers averted the greatest overpopulation crisis the world has ever known, won him the Nobel Prize in 1918, and now feeds over 2 billion people. But Haber was also a staunch German patriot who loved his country with an almost blinding loyalty. Born and raised Jewish, his longing to be accepted as a true German and his intense ambition in his career led him to convert to Lutheranism and abandon his faith. When World War I broke out, the bloody stalemate of trench warfare threatened to slaughter an entire generation of young Germans, and the German military requested Haber to use his genius to create a new kind of weapon that could break the deadlock. As Haber agonized over the decision, his wife, Clara, a chemist herself who had sacrificed her own career to support his, implored him not to go through with it. But Haber, his opportunity to become a true German hero finally at hand, agreed to help the militaryâand became the father of modern chemical warfare. Ultimately, the tragedy of Fritz Shimon Haberâs legacy was personal as well. His wife, horrified at his decision, committed suicide in protest.

Battered and scratched, my valiant Carlton stood up to almost a year's worth of international motor shows. Its nemesis was a rainy Heathrow in January 1998; at five o'clock in the morning, Terminal 4, just off the red-eye from Detroit. Mine was nearly the first suitcase to thump off the conveyor and on to the luggage carousel, where it slunk round, cracked across the bottom, trailing my underwear like the entrails of a stricken animal. But in watching fellow travellers and their luggage there is reassurance that baggage handlers have no snobbery. It doesn't matter whether it says Louis Vuitton, Samsonite, Delsey or Connolly on the handle. They don't care whether it's made of cardboard or carpet, leather or plastic, whether it's hand-stitched or riveted; they'll cheerfully smash it up. So for two years I didn't spend more than £30 on a suitcase; changing it every year. I also carried a variety of repair materials and straps around with me. Guildford market yielded a selection of suitable cases. The zips were flimsy, the hinges wobbly and the wheels squeaked rather than glided, but the strategy worked. And that was how I carried on until I was persuaded to test-drive one of the world's most expensive cases for a year. A Tumi, designed and manufactured in the US, now (the company claims) the best-selling designer brand in the world, sported by the likes of Madonna, Sean Connery and Angelina Jolie, and worth 30 times what I last spent on a suitcase. It had better be good. On first inspection, the Wheel-A-Way Tumi looks no different from dozens of other cases. Examine it more closely, though, and you see that the nylon is that bit thicker and of a harder-wearing grade, the steel frame is that bit stouter, the zips that much stronger. Yes, the wheels glide and the handles sigh into their slots, but it is the tiny details that make you appreciate the workmanship. There's the foolproof combination padlock that prevents you from inadvertently changing the combination and locking yourself out of the case. There's the patented expansion system that keeps the case in its expanded size even when it is empty, making it easier to load. And there's the one-handed pop-up towing handle, which gives you that crucial edge in the dash from luggage carousel to customs queue. The Tumi's first outing was to the launch of the Aston Martin Vanquish in Northumberland. Edinburgh's baggage handlers managed to inflict a white scrape on the top of the case, which has remained there ever since. When we tried to get the £865 Tumi into the £158,000 supercar, Aston Martin's chairman, Ulrich Bez, joined us to close the recalcitrant boot lid. \\"I've had my Tumi case for years,\\" he said as a hand-crafted aluminium boot lid repeatedly slammed down on US military-spec ballistic-grade nylon. \\"I damaged the zip and the company replaced the whole case free of charge, they are brilliant.\\" He stepped back and admired the now closed boot lid; the Tumi had gained a new Aston-green paint mark. The case also went with me to Venice and travelled across the lagoon by enthusiastically helmed water taxi. The consequent deluge of lagoon into the cabin soaked me and the Tumi, which leaked through the zipper and was left with a corroded padlock. Rinsed with fresh water and dried out on the Aga, the Tumi then saw active service at the Geneva Motor Show, closely followed by the motor shows at Frankfurt and Tokyo last autumn. Loaded beyond belief (and, I admit, beyond the airline's maximum baggage limit), the case protected the precious press packs from both shows. At this point, I had thrown away the pointless \\"suiter\\" suit protector, which is a poor substitute for folding a suit properly in tissue paper and takes three times as long. The Tumi also went to the United States, four times, and while there I took it on several internal flights, which accounted for the only real damage it sustained. After September 11, on some internal flights, all passenger's luggage was inspected, then not terribly expertly repacked. The Las Vegas inspectors over-strained a zip. Fortunately it had only pulled open for about four inches when I arrived in Britain, and the tough nylon teeth weren't permanently damaged. I was able to tug the zipper back and into operation, and although Tumi offered to repair the case free of charge, it wasn't necessary. Nine months later, having travelled three-quarters of the way round the world, it is still in perfect working order. Few of us give much thought to our luggage - until it breaks. My cheaper suitcases all lasted a year in motor-show service, but when they failed, they did so catastrophically and often at the most embarrassing and incovenient moments. The Tumi has shrugged off a year's hard slog, has just done its second Geneva Motor Show, still looks smart and I have absolute confidence in it. You simply cannot justify an £865 suitcase in terms of pure utility; it will always be an expensive treat. Unlike other pricey extravagances, however, the case I tested does its job superbly. I get the feeling that when I finally stop travelling the only way to get rid of it will be to take it outside and shoot it. • Tumi opens a British store at 170 Piccadilly, London W1 (020 7493 4138) on Monday; for other stockists ring 020 7731 3500. A 26in Wheel-A-Way Tumi costs £865. Globetrotter cases are very traditional and virtually indestructible. The design is basic - they're really just boxes on wheels, with spartan interiors - but they have a classic style and a cult following. They're made of layers of re-constituted paper and glue, and although that sounds as though they won't last a day, the cases can go on for 50 years or more. Occasionally the locks go, but they can be replaced. Globetrotter will be increasing its prices by about 30 per cent in August, so if you're going to buy one, do so soon. A 26in Globetrotter Centenary, with leather straps and corners, available in black or red, costs £325; the 26in original trolley case, without leather trim, comes in navy only and costs £219. Victorinox luggage is extremely durable and functional - as close as you'll get to Tumi workmanship at this price. The company is better known for making Swiss army knives, and the same attention to detail has gone into its luggage design. It's made from high-density nylon, with sturdy zips; we've been selling it here for about a year and have had no problems or complaints. The Victorinox 27in Mobiliser costs £379. Mandarina Duck has just brought out a very good new luggage range. It's straightforward, made of good quality nylon, and has the sort of styling that only the Italians can manage. The Mandarina Duck 26in Workbag Canvas Trolley costs £180. • Suitcases recommended by James Tanner, Buying Manager for luggage at Selfridges (020 7629 1234), which stocks all cases mentioned.

The answer to this question is:","output":"\\"False\\".  Although the statement mentioning the inflation rate in the Netherlands in February 2013 represents a specific aspect about the economic situation of the country at that particular point in time, it does not generally or completely answer the question about the economics of the Netherlands.  The economics of a country encapsulates a wide spectrum of different elements, including but not limited to, its GDP, unemployment rate, economic structure, inflation rate, public debt, trade balance, economic sectors, fiscal policy, and monetary policy. It would also look into the distribution of resources and wealth, productivity, as well as economic growth and development. As such, a comprehensive answer to the mentioned question would require an overview of these components, a discussion about the country's economic history, and an analysis of current challenges and future perspectives. Let’s illustrate what a more appropriate response might look like: \\"The economy of the Netherlands is considered highly developed, being the world's 17th largest economy. It is known for its stable industrial relations, moderate unemployment and inflation, a sizable current account surplus, and an important role as a European transportation hub. The country's economy is mainly based on services, representing around 70% of the GDP, and is particularly strong in sectors like logistics, banking, and specialized technical industries. Moreover, natural gas resources play a significant role, as due to certain sectors, the Netherlands has a substantial trade surplus. However, the economic growth has been slowed down by the global financial crisis in the past decade, and the country is facing several challenges, including an ageing population and uncertainty in regards to the future trade relationship with the UK after Brexit.\\" Therefore, stating only that the inflation rate was at 3.2% in February 2013 does not adequately respond to the question about the economics of the Netherlands. While the suggested reply contains accurate statistical data for that precise period of time, it lacks sufficient breadth and depth. It does not provide a comprehensive overview of the country's economic situation, nor does it address several other key economic indicators or sectors that would be necessary to fully understand the economics of the Netherlands."},{"instruction":"You should describe the task and explain your answer.

All its life it had been asleep, but now it hardly got a chance for a nod, so swiftly did big events and crashing surprises come along in one another's wake: Friday morning, first glimpse of Real Nobility, also grand reception at Aunt Patsy Cooper's, also great robber raid; Friday evening, dramatic kicking of the heir of the chief citizen in presence of four hundred people; Saturday morning, emergence as practicing lawyer of the long-submerged Pudd'nhead Wilson; Saturday night, duel between chief citizen and titled stranger.  The people took more pride in the duel than in all the other events put together, perhaps.  It was a glory to their town to have such a thing happen there.  In their eyes the principals had reached the summit of human honor.  Everybody paid homage to their names; their praises were in all mouths.  Even the duelists' subordinates came in for a handsome share of the public approbation: wherefore Pudd'nhead Wilson was suddenly become a man of consequence.  When asked to run for the mayoralty Saturday night, he was risking defeat, but Sunday morning found him a made man and his success assured.

Background: The general trend in electronegativity is that the value increases from left to right across a row in the periodic table and decreases down a column. The most electronegative element is fluorine, which has a value of 4.0. As discussed in the lesson \\"Trends in the Periodic Table,\\" electronegativity increases across a row as the number of protons in the nucleus increases and therefore has a stronger pull. Electronegativity decreases down a column due to an increased effect of electron shielding in larger atoms.  Paragraph: A high school student, Timmy, is reading about elements of a periodic table. He is studying the periodic table when he decides to compare two random elements within the same column. He chooses Mardine and Sampline to compare and contrast and gets to work. The first thing he notices is that Sampline is further down the periodic table than Mardine. It's not much information to go on, but it's a good starting point for Timmy.  Given the paragraph above, please answer correctly the following question: Is electron shielding higher or lower in Sampline? The answer to this question is:","output":"Electron shielding is higher in Sampline. Justification: Since Sampline is further down the periodic table than Mardine, it indicates that Sampline has more electron shells. More electron shells result in a higher degree of electron shielding due to a greater number of electrons between the nucleus and the outermost electrons. This increase in electron shielding reduces the effective nuclear charge experienced by the outermost electrons, making the atom's electronegativity decrease as we go down a column in the periodic table."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

For couples, these pressures can strain relationships and create emotional disconnection. If you are looking to alleviate some stress and rebuild a stronger connection with your partner, consider incorporating relaxation techniques and open communication into your daily life. Step 1: Understand that you are okay Before beginning any relaxation techniques, it's essential to accept and remind yourself that you are okay. Often, people become caught up in worry and anxiety, making it difficult to focus on the present moment. By acknowledging that you are safe and secure, you can start releasing tension from your body and mind. Step 2: Simple relaxation techniques Wiggle your toes: Wiggling your toes may seem like a simple act, but doing so can help ground you to the present moment and release tension in your feet. This quick activity can provide a mental reminder that your body is okay and help relax your mind. Scrunch your face: Tighten the muscles in your face by scrunching it up and holding the position for a few seconds before releasing. This action can help relieve tension in your facial muscles and may provide a sense of release, promoting relaxation. Make a fist: Clench your fists tightly and hold for a few seconds before releasing. Doing so allows you to become more aware of the tension in your hands, making it easier to release that stress and feel more relaxed. Step 3: Talk to your partner Open communication is essential for any healthy relationship. By discussing your feelings, thoughts, and emotions with your partner, you demonstrate vulnerability and invite them to do the same. This openness can create a greater emotional connection and contribute to both of you feeling more supported and less anxious. Try incorporating these conversation prompts with your partner: - Share experiences from your day - Discuss any stressors that have been impacting you - Ask your partner about their feelings and experiences Step 4: Incorporate relaxation techniques and communication into daily routine By regularly practicing relaxation techniques and prioritizing open communication with your partner, you lay the foundation for a stronger emotional connection and a more mindful approach to life. Consider setting aside time each day for relaxing activities, such as yoga, deep breathing exercises, or progressive muscle relaxation. Taking moments to practice relaxation techniques and talk openly with your partner can significantly reduce stress and improve overall well-being. Conclusion Relax, communicate, and reconnect - it may seem like a simple mantra, but following these steps can genuinely help alleviate stress and create a deeper bond with your partner. Remember, understanding that you are okay, practicing relaxation techniques, and talking openly with your partner can transform your relationship and promote a more balanced, peaceful life. Give these methods a try and experience the benefits for yourself."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant. User will you give you a task.

Here is a news article: ATLANTA, GA (November 7, 2014) - Many people don't realize allergies and asthma go hand-in-hand, and about 90 percent of kids with asthma also have allergies. Even more important, when asthma is undiagnosed or poorly controlled, children are at risk for suffering difficult-to-treat allergic reactions to food.      According to a study presented at the American College of Allergy, Asthma and Immunology (ACAAI) Annual Scientific Meeting, a two and-a-half year-old girl in Pennsylvania suffered a life-threatening allergic reaction (anaphylaxis) to eating an orange - the first time such a case has been reported in a toddler.      \\"She ate an orange, and within a few minutes had developed severe anaphylaxis,\\" said allergist and ACAAI member Sigrid DaVeiga, MD, study author. \\"Her lips and tongue swelled, she broke out in hives and couldn't breathe well. Her parents immediately got her to an emergency room, and she was flown by helicopter to a pediatric intensive care unit.\\"      Following treatment and a 48-hour hospital stay, the girl recovered and was able to go home. Upon examination of her medical history, doctors discovered that she had previously had orange juice with no reaction, but more importantly, that she had undiagnosed asthma. Later testing by allergists found that she was allergic to both orange and peach.      \\"Several recommendations were made following the allergic reaction, said allergist and ACAAI member Sayantani Sindher, MD, study author. \\"She was advised to avoid orange and peach, and also told to start asthma therapy, both of which will keep future allergic reactions under control.\\"      According to ACAAI, it's very rare for anyone to have a severe allergic reaction to an orange.      It's more common for people who suffer from hay fever to sometimes suffer from oral allergy syndrome - an itchy mouth or scratchy throat after eating certain raw fruits or vegetables and some tree nuts. The response is caused by cross-reacting allergens found in both pollen, and the fruits and vegetables.      #      For more information about allergies and to locate an allergist in your area, visit AllergyandAsthmaRelief.org.

But in one recent case, an orange nearly proved fatal for a 31-month-old toddler.      While at Walmart in Pennsylvania, the child ate a mandarin orange. Her face began swelling and itching, so her parents bought and gave her some Benadryl, says Dr. Sigrid DaVeiga, an allergist at the Children’s Hospital of Philadelphia.      But then she began coughing. Her breathing became more labored as her lungs spasmed, and her alarmed parents took her to a nearby emergency room.      There, she was given two shots of epinephrine to reverse the anaphylactic reaction, says DaVeiga, a co-author of a newly published report describing the case, to be presented this weekend at the annual meeting of the American College of Allergy, Asthma, and Immunology in Atlanta. Anaphylaxis is a life-threatening condition in which multiple organs react to an allergen; the face and mouth swell and airways constrict, hampering breathing, DaVeiga tells Newsweek. Typically, one epinephrine shot is enough to control anaphylaxis, but in this case the swelling was so severe. Epinephrine works by relaxing airway muscles and reducing swelling.      Even after the two epinephrine shots, the child still had enough trouble breathing that doctors intubated her and connected her to a ventilator. She was later taken via helicopter to the intensive care unit at Children’s Hospital of Philadelphia.      She recovered and, after a 48-hour stay, returned home. She was prescribed two medications to treat her underlying asthma, which hadn’t previously been recognized by the parents.      See all of the best photos of the week in these slideshows      At first, doctors thought something besides an orange must have been to blame, because the fruit rarely causes allergic complications. “We kept asking about other things she might have been exposed to, but her parents were adamant” that it was just this one piece of fruit, DaVeiga says.      “Her reaction was pretty severe—we were all surprised it was ultimately an orange,” she adds.      The diagnosis was confirmed when the physicians performed a skin-prick test with an extract of orange; the child’s skin swelled up slightly in the spot where she was exposed to the orange extract.      Oranges and other fruits contain proteins that are chemically similar to pollen; eating these can cause itching and irritation of the mouth in certain people, many of whom also happen to be allergic to pollen, says Dr. James Sublett, an allergist in Louisville, Kentucky, who wasn’t involved in the study.      But this case is the first known case of an extreme anaphylactic reaction, he says.      The fact that the child had asthma likely made the reaction worse than it otherwise would have been, since asthmatics often already have inflamed, narrowed airways, DaVeiga says.      This is not the only unusual food allergy DaVeiga has seen. She has also come across allergies to paprika, cinnamon and calamari, though “none as severe as this recent orange reaction,” she says. She also seen “patients with a severe allergy to just pine nuts (not other nuts) that presented with anaphylaxis after eating pesto sauce.” And another weird allergy that’s gotten some press recently is a reaction to red meat after being bit by a Lone Star tick.      There’s no saying exactly why the child reacted so strongly to this orange, although it likely has a genetic underpinning, like other allergies, Sublett says. Regardless, he doesn’t recommend anybody stay away from these fruit.      “I don't think we'll see a surge of orange allergies or anything like that,” DaVeiga says, laughing. ||||| A summary of this is?","output":"The news article discusses a rare case of a severe allergic reaction to an orange in a two-and-a-half-year-old girl from Pennsylvania. The child experienced anaphylaxis, a life-threatening reaction that caused her lips, tongue, and face to swell, hives to appear, and difficulty in breathing. She was promptly taken to an emergency room and later transferred to a pediatric intensive care unit, where she recovered after a 48-hour stay. Upon reviewing the girl's medical history, doctors discovered her previously undiagnosed asthma, which is known to exacerbate allergic reactions. Subsequent allergy tests revealed that she was allergic to oranges and peaches. Following the incident, doctors advised the girl to avoid both fruits and begin asthma therapy to prevent future allergic reactions.  Severe allergic reactions to oranges are exceedingly rare and usually manifest as mild symptoms involving irritation and itching in the mouth. The girl's case is the first known instance of an extreme anaphylactic reaction to an orange. The child's underlying asthma condition likely contributed to the severity of the reaction."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant. User will you give you a task.

Over the long term, these environmental conditions can even create local adaptation between plant hosts, AM fungi and the local soil nutrient concentrations.  I am facing a new situation today: Greg and Paul were two neighbors. They were both into mycology. Greg researched AM fungi, while Paul studied other types of mycorrhizal fungi.

Here is a goal: To find honey when out in the wild, How would you accomplish this goal?","output":"To accomplish the goal of finding honey when out in the wild, you would need to follow several steps for a higher probability of locating a beehive and ultimately, honey.  1. Preparing for the journey: Before you start, it's crucial to have appropriate supplies such as insect repellent, water, snacks, comfortable clothes, a local map (possibly with natural landmarks and vegetation zones), a compass or GPS device, gloves, a beekeeping veil, a small knife or scraper, and a container or jar for collecting honey. Familiarize yourself with plants, flowers, and trees that bees favor in your location, as these may indicate proximity to a hive. 2. Locate possible bee habitats: Start by searching for suitable locations where bees might reside and establish their hives. Often, this includes areas with an abundance and variety of flowering plants that provide a food source for bees. Examples could be fields, orchards, meadows, and forests with a diverse flora. 3. Observing bee behavior: Once you are in a suitable area, observe the behavior of bees and their flight pattern. Bees have a very systematic approach when gathering nectar, they typically fly in a more or less straight line between the nectar source and their hive. If you notice bees consistently flying in the same direction, follow it while maintaining a safe distance from the bees to avoid disturbing their normal behavior. 4. Identify the beehive: As you follow the bees, keep in mind that hives can be located in various locations, including tree trunks, hollowed-out logs, or even in crevices of rocks. Wild beehive locations are rarely obvious, so keep a watchful eye for openings or irregularities in the surroundings. If you notice bees entering or leaving a specific spot, it's likely you've found a beehive. 5. Observe from a distance: Once you locate a beehive, it's crucial to maintain a safe distance and not disturb the bees. Observe their behavior – often, the presence of honey within the hive is indicated by bees coming and going with full pollen baskets on their hind legs.  6. Collect honey: If you’re certain that the hive has honey, protective clothing like gloves and a beekeeping veil is essential for safety. Approach the beehive cautiously and slowly to avoid alarming the bees. Once you are near the hive, use your knife or scraper to open the hive and remove a small portion of the honeycomb, retaining enough for the bees’ own needs. Quickly and gently transfer the honeycomb to your portable container. 7. Post-collection care: After collecting the honeycomb, move away from the site of the beehive and find a safe area to process your honey. Carefully remove bees that may still be on the honeycomb using a tool or a gentle brush. Extract honey from the honeycomb and filter it through a fine mesh to remove any beeswax, preserving the raw honey.  8. Leave no trace: Always keep in mind the importance of preserving nature and the bees that are vital to the ecosystem. Avoid taking more honey than necessary, as bees need it for food and hive maintenance, especially during the cold season. Lastly, respect the surroundings by leaving no litter and avoiding any damage to the area in which the beehive is located. Following these steps can successfully lead you to find and collect honey while out in the wild, all while ensuring the preservation and safety of the bee colony and their precious resource."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Write an article that answers the following question: How many U.S. ships were damaged on 25 October?","output":"Step 1: Identify the context and scope of the article In order to address the question \\"How many U.S. ships were damaged on 25 October?\\" I must first determine the context and scope of the article. Since a specific year is not given, I will choose to focus on a historically significant event. One such event is the Battle of Leyte Gulf, which took place during World War II between 23-26 October 1944. Therefore, I will concentrate on this event and the U.S. ships damaged on 25 October 1944. Step 2: Research the Battle of Leyte Gulf In order to provide accurate information, I will research the Battle of Leyte Gulf, focusing specifically on the events that occurred on 25 October 1944. I will identify the number of U.S. ships that were damaged during that day as well as gather information about the broader context of the battle to provide a well-rounded article. Step 3: Organize the information After acquiring the necessary information, I will organize it in a manner that allows for a coherent article structure. This will involve presenting the broader context of the Battle of Leyte Gulf, the significance of the particular date (25 October 1944), the number of U.S. ships damaged, and any notable aftermath or consequences as a result of that day's events. Step 4: Write the article With the information organized, I can now write the article: Title: The Impact of 25 October 1944 on U.S. Ships during the Battle of Leyte Gulf The Battle of Leyte Gulf, fought between 23-26 October 1944, is considered one of the largest and most complex naval battles in history. This monumental World War II confrontation had profound implications for both the Allied and Axis forces. In particular, 25 October 1944 was a significant date within the context of the battle due to its impact on U.S. Navy ships. As a comprehensive engagement spanning multiple days, the Battle of Leyte Gulf featured a series of individual battles, such as the Battle of Sibuyan Sea, the Battle of Surigao Strait, the Battle off Samar, and the Battle off Cape Engaño. On 25 October, the Battle off Samar and the Battle off Cape Engaño took place, and it was on this day that a number of U.S. ships were damaged. During the Battle off Samar, the U.S. Navy's Task Unit 77.4.3, also known as \\"Taffy 3\\", suffered the loss of two ships, USS Hoel and USS Johnston. Additionally, three other ships, USS Samuel B. Roberts, USS Heermann, and USS Dennis, were heavily damaged. These damages were inflicted by the overwhelming force of the Japanese Center Force, consisting of four battleships, six heavy cruisers, two light cruisers, and eleven destroyers. Simultaneously, the Battle off Cape Engaño involved the U.S. Navy's Task Force 38, which engaged in aerial attacks against the Japanese Northern Force. During this attack, USS Princeton, an Independence-class light aircraft carrier, was struck and irreparably damaged by a Japanese air attack, eventually forcing her abandonment and leading to her scuttling. In conclusion, on 25 October 1944 during the Battle of Leyte Gulf, a total of six U.S. ships were damaged. These events proved critical in the outcome of the Battle of Leyte Gulf, which ultimately contributed to the eventual defeat of the Axis forces and further cemented the United States' role as a significant power in the Pacific theatre of World War II.

Is the sentiment of the following sentence positive or negative? pleasant but not","output":"The sentiment of the given sentence, \\"pleasant but not,\\" is somewhat neutral with a slightly positive leaning. While sentiment analysis typically categorizes text as positive, negative, or neutral, this short phrase is not as straightforward or definitive. The word \\"pleasant\\" has a positive connotation, which indicates a favorable perception or experience. However, the inclusion of \\"but not\\" after \\"pleasant\\" introduces an element of contrast or contradiction. This phrase, without any further context, doesn't provide enough information to suggest the overall sentiment behind it. Additionally, without any additional information surrounding the context or what the phrase is being compared to, speculation as to the exact sentiment remains imprecise. A complete assessment of the sentiment would require more context or a fuller statement to consider. In a larger context, the sentiment might lean more towards positive or negative based on the addition of other words or phrases that accompany the given sentence. The sentiment analysis would become more precise with the presence of additional context. Nevertheless, as it stands, the sentiment of the sentence \\"pleasant but not\\" slightly leans towards positive due to the presence of the word \\"pleasant.\\" However, the presence of the contrasting element \\"but not\\" tempers the positivity with uncertainty and fuzziness, which places the sentiment in a more neutral territory."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

News article: Marcus Willis’s Dream Ends at Wimbledon Before Marcus Willis, the tennis instructor turned British sports hero, walked on Centre Court to a standing ovation for his match against Roger Federer, he had to take care of a few things. First he had to wait for Federer by the locker room. Then he had to go to the bathroom. Then he had to decide whether he should lead the way to Centre Court, or follow behind Federer. Federer, winner of a record 17 Grand Slam singles titles, didn’t want to be bossy, but he nudged Willis a little. “I said, ‘You have the choice. I don’t know what you want to do,’” Federer said. “I thought it was cool that he got out first because it’s his moment, in my opinion. I wanted him to have a great time.” Willis walked out with a white bandana on his head, just like Federer. He also wore one of Federer’s Nike shirts, with the RF initials on the sleeve. “I bought it for last year’s Wimby, but I didn’t play,” Willis said. The chances that Willis would play in this year’s Wimbledon were close to zero, too. First he had to win three matches in a pre-qualifying tournament. Then three more in the qualifying tournament. You probably know the rest. Willis—a pudgy, 25-year-old ranked 772nd in the world who gives lessons for £30 an hour and lives with his parents—won his first-round match and then got to play Federer, seven-time Wimbledon champion and perhaps the sport’s all-time greatest player, on Wednesday. Federer won, 6-0, 6-3, 6-4. But they really did play, even if Willis wondered at times if he might be hallucinating. “I did look up twice as I bounced the ball and saw Roger Federer, and thought, ‘Oh, haven’t seen this before,’” he said. Willis wasn’t on court for long before the obvious became quite clear: He wasn't going to beat Federer. Federer won the first seven games, though Willis stayed close in a few of them. When Willis finally won a game, with a clean forehand winner, he raised both arms and urged the crowd to cheer more. With the roof closed, Centre Court was as loud as it usually is when someone wins the tournament. There were other memorable moments. Willis hit nine aces, the same as Federer. He hit a few nice volleys and touch shots. And then there was the lob, an on-the-run, looping backhand beauty that floated over Federer’s head for a winner in the first set. Willis raised his fist in triumph after he hit it. “It was amazing,” Willis said. “I did enjoy myself even though I was getting duffed up. I loved every bit of it. Not the duffing bit. I loved getting stuck in, fighting hard.” Federer and Willis shook hands and hugged after the match, and then Federer skipped the celebration normally reserved for winners, so Willis could say goodbye to Centre Court. Federer, who has taken plenty of bows in his career, was happy to step aside. “I said a few days ago, this story is gold,” Federer said. “This is definitely one of the matches I’ll remember.” Willis too, but he wasn’t going to party, like he would have years ago, when he was a lot heavier and used to eat candy and drink soda during matches. On Wednesday, he went back to the locker room and drank a bottle of beer—not even a full pint. “That’s why I’m here, I haven’t been doing stuff like that,” he said. “Get a meal, go to bed, yeah, try and rest.” Besides, Willis was supposed to play in a league tennis match on Thursday for the club where he teaches. “I might play if I’m feeling OK,” he said.

You will be given an SQL statement and an English description with what is wrong about that SQL statement. You must correct the SQL statement based off of the feedback. An SQL query works by selecting data from a table where certain conditions apply. A table contains columns where every row in that table must have a value for each column. Every table has a primary key that uniquely identifies each row, usually an id. To choose which columns are returned you specify that after the \\"SELECT\\" statement. Next, you use a \\"FROM\\" statement to specify what tables you want to select the data from. When you specify a table you can rename it with the \\"AS\\" statement. You can reference that table by whatever name follows the \\"AS\\" statement. If you want to select data from multiple tables you need to use the \\"JOIN\\" statement. This will join the tables together by pairing a row in one table with every row in the other table (Cartesian Product). To limit the number of rows returned you should use the \\"ON\\" statement. This will only return rows where the condition specified after the statement is true, this is usually an equals operator with primary keys. You can also use the \\"WHERE\\" statement to specify that only rows with column values statisfying a certain condition, should be returned. The \\"GROUP BY\\" statement will group rows together that have equal column values for whatever columns follows the statement. The \\"HAVING\\" statement will return groups that statisfy whatever condition follows the statement. Any column(s) being returned from grouped rows must either be an aggregate function, (AVG, MAX, COUNT, SUM, ...) of a column, or the column(s) that the data was grouped by. To sort the returned data you can use the \\"ORDER BY\\" command which will order the data by whatever aggregate function or column follows the statement. The \\"DESC\\" statement will sort in descending order and the \\"ASC\\" statement will sort in ascending order. Finally, you can use the \\"LIMIT\\" statement to return a certain number of rows. When \\"*\\" is used in an SQL statement every column is returned. For example, SELECT * FROM table WHERE attribute = 1, will select every column from rows with the attribute column equal to 1.

Write a summary based on this article: President Obama on Wednesday delivered a sharply personal rebuke of GOP presidential candidate Ted Cruz Ted CruzMichele Bachmann: God picked Trump to be the GOP nominee Trump at immigration crossroads Poll: Majority of GOP voters wish they chose another presidential nominee MORE for his call to institute surveillance on Muslim communities in response to the Brussels terrorist attacks.      During a press conference in Argentina, Obama called such a proposal “wrong and un-American” and said it would undermine the U.S. campaign against Islamic extremists.      ADVERTISEMENT      Obama invoked Cruz’s Cuban heritage, arguing the Texas senator was ignoring the personal journey of his father, who fled the island nation for the United States to escape political oppression.      “I just left a country that engages in that kind of neighborhood surveillance, which, by the way, the father of Sen. Cruz escaped for America,” the president said. “The land of the free. The notion that we would start down that slippery slope makes absolutely no sense.”      It was the second day in a row Obama addressed the series of blasts in the Belgian capital that killed at least 31 people and injured more than 180, including a dozen Americans.      The Brussels attacks shook up the presidential campaign with fresh concerns about the threat of terrorist attacks on U.S. soil.      Some Republican candidates have called for drastic measures to prevent a similar strike in the U.S.      Cruz said Muslim neighborhoods should be put under special watch by authorities in order to preempt any future attacks in the U.S.      GOP presidential front-runner Donald Trump Donald Trump5 things to watch for in Trump's immigration speech Deportations under Obama could hit 10-year low Trump softens rhetoric in pitch to black voters MORE backed Cruz on the patrols and renewed his call for a temporary ban on Muslims entering the country and for waterboarding to be used on terrorism suspects.      The proposals touched off a fierce political debate, with Democrats accusing Trump and Cruz of encouraging Islamophobia to win over conservative votes.      Candidates on both sides of the aisle called for tougher security measures in the U.S. and demanded Obama take a more aggressive approach to fighting the Islamic State in Iraq and Syria (ISIS), which claimed responsibility for the attacks.      But Obama indicated he would not make significant changes to his anti-ISIS strategy \\"simply because it's political season.\\"      The president said defeating the group is his “No. 1 priority,” but it must be done in a “smart” way.      “As our strategy evolves and we see additional opportunities, we will go after it,” Obama said.      But he said the U.S. should not “take approaches that will be counterproductive,\\" such as carpet-bombing Middle Eastern countries, an idea Cruz proposed.      “Not only is that inhumane, not only is that contrary to our values, but that would likely be an extraordinary mechanism for ISIL to recruit more,\\" Obama said, using an alternate acronym for the group. “That’s not a smart strategy.”      The president pledged he would \\"continue to go after ISIL aggressively until it is removed from Syria and removed from Iraq and is finally destroyed.\\"      The U.S. has relied on airstrikes to fight the extremist group and has mostly turned to local forces on the ground, resisting calls for a large-scale ground campaign.      American special operations forces have carried out strikes against certain ISIS targets, and the Marines recently set up a base in northern Iraq with around 200 troops. One Marine was killed in an ISIS rocket attack there last Saturday.      At the same time, Obama reiterated his belief that the group does not pose \\"an existential threat\\" to the U.S. and said that its activities should not disrupt the daily lives of Americans.      \\"Even as we are systematic and ruthless and focused in going after them ... it is very important for us to not respond with fear,\\" the president said. \\"We defeat them in part by saying, 'You are not strong. You are weak.' \\" ||||| REUTERS/Ivan Alvarado US President Barack Obama called out Ted Cruz, a Republican presidential candidate and Texas senator, for suggesting amped-up surveillance of Muslim neighborhoods in the US as a way to prevent terrorist attacks.      Obama's remarks came Wednesday in a press conference during a visit to Argentina, a day after terrorists hit Belgium, killing at least 31 people and injuring more than 230 in bombings at a Brussels airport and metro station.      The president emphasized that fighting the terrorist group ISIS — aka the Islamic State, ISIL, or Daesh — is his \\"top priority.\\"      But he criticized Cruz for proposing what he termed a \\"counterproductive\\" strategy that might isolate American Muslims.      Cruz said in a Tuesday statement that the police should be empowered to \\"patrol and secure\\" neighborhoods with large Muslim populations \\"before they become radicalized.\\"      \\"I just left a country that engages in that kind of neighborhood surveillance, which, by the way, the father of Sen. Cruz escaped for America, the land of the free,\\" Obama said, referencing a historic visit to Cuba earlier in the week.      He added: \\"The notion that we would start down that slippery slope makes absolutely no sense. It's contrary to who we are, and it's not going to help us to defeat ISIL.\\"      Obama's visit to Cuba marked the first time in 88 years that a sitting US president traveled to the communist country. Cruz's father fled Cuba for the US in 1957.      The president also criticized Cruz for saying that the US should \\"carpet bomb\\" ISIS in Iraq and Syria, a strategy that military experts have called ineffective and possibly illegal.      \\"When I hear somebody saying we should 'carpet bomb' Iraq or Syria, not only is that inhumane, not only is that contrary to our values, but that would likely be an extraordinary mechanism for ISIL to recruit more people willing to die and explode bombs in an airport or in a metro station,\\" Obama said. \\"That's not a smart strategy.\\"      Obama noted that what sets the US apart from Europe, which sees higher rates of foreign fighters traveling to join terrorist groups, is that Muslims are better integrated into American society.      He said:      One of the great strengths of the United States, and part of the reason why we have not seen more attacks in the United States, is we have an extraordinarily successful, patriotic, integrated Muslim-American community. They do not feel ghettoized, they do not feel isolated. Their children are our children's friends, going to the same schools. They are our colleagues in our workplaces. They are our men and women in uniform, fighting for our freedom.      And so any approach that would single them out or target them for discrimination is not only wrong and un-American, but it also would be counterproductive. Because it would reduce the strength, the antibodies that we have to resist terrorism.      President Obama answering questions during a joint news conference with Argentine President Mauricio Macri. AP Photo/Victor R. Caivano      Obama also defended the US strategy for defeating ISIS, saying that the US's approach has been \\"continuously to adjust to see what works and what doesn't.\\"      \\"What has been working is the air strikes that we're taking on their leadership, on their infrastructure, on their financial systems,\\" he said.      \\"What has been working is special operators partnering with Iraqi security forces and going after leadership networks and couriers and disrupting the connection between their bases in Raqqa and their bases in Mosul,\\" he continued.      But he acknowledged the challenges of identifying threats in Western countries.      \\"It's challenging to find, identify very small groups of people who are willing to die themselves and can walk into a crowd and detonate a bomb,\\" Obama said.      He continued: \\"And my charge to my team is to find every strategy possible to successfully reduce the risk of such terrorist attacks even after we go after their beating heart in places like Iraq and Syria.\\" ||||| President Obama joined the growing chorus Wednesday condemning Sen.

Your task is to classify given movie review into two categories: 1) positive, and 2) negative based on its content. There should be a rule that states quite clearly that movies like Resident Evil are supposed to be made in the spirit of the game, not in the spirit of blowing up everything possible. RE was a survival horror game, and a damn effective one at that, yet Paul WS Anderson managed to make it like any other video game movie to come along. Alone in the Dark is essentially the same kind of a spirit as Resident Evil, so of course, there is the slight hope the director will manage to have some piece of a brain enough to make a horror movie and not an action movie. Instead, Alone in the Dark just proves that there is no longer hope for video games becoming movies.The plot, despite the fact that it obviously isn't supposed to matter, is the largest of many problems with the movie. The movie starts with what can only be described as five minutes of scrolling text that may or may not be important, as after a minute passes, the audience stops caring and just sits through the rest hitting the object closest to them. Then there's something about an orphanage, some artefacts, an ancient tribe, some bureaucracy and some demons, all of which get so jumbled together that the viewers really can't follow with what is going on. Characters move in and out of the plot like candy, some having huge build-ups for meaningless deaths. Basically, what I can understand is that some demons got released, and Edward Carnby (Slater) has some link to them thanks to some operation given to children in his orphanage which has failed on him. He finds an artefact involving the demons and brings it to an ex-girlfriend anthropologist (Reid), who of course he manages to have sex with right away for no good reason. Then, out of nowhere, all hell breaks loose, and the pair end up with a military team led by some asshole commander (Dorff), who apparently has a mutual hatred for Carnby.It's all ridiculous, and the reason I don't really understand it isn't just because it's complicated and jumbled, but it leaves no room for anyone to really care. Instead, I highly recommend that, if you must see this film, bring a tennis ball or something to occupy yourself when the plot manages to bore you into confusion.The action scenes in a movie with a plot as terrible as this should at least bring it up a little, right? Too bad, this movie is like any other ruined crap ever made, with enough quick cuts to behead a coop of chickens. Considering that this is based on a horror game, not an action game, it is especially annoying.The first action scene involving a man chasing Cranby from a taxi is among the worst I have ever had to witness, and the rest isn't all that great either. The demons look somewhat cool, though the fact that they turn into powder when killed takes away all that effect. Scenes involving lots of guns which should be cool to watch instead involve the muzzle fire as the only source of light and the camera zooming and panning faster than the head of a crack addict. It's all the kind of seizure inducing crap that keeps children in bed at night.The acting is what I like to call taking actors and making them do nothing. Slater does nothing but sound important for the whole movie, though he does seem to have more talent than he is letting on. The same is true of Dorff, who gets a thankless role despite actually having some talent (something that has happened to him a lot). Reid is pretty much exactly what she should be, background sex appeal, as whenever she tries to act it is a disaster (as is the incredibly bad scientist look she has in the beginning).In all, this is the type of movie that worries me about future video game movies. If they keep ruining the spirit like this, it's only a matter of time before Samus Aran is killing Middle-Easterns with an AK-47 and Tommy Vercetti is fighting a squadron of aliens. Unlike Resident Evil, however, this one doesn't deserve a second chance, as I don't think anything could possibly help me forget just how terrible this movie is. It's bland, uninteresting and unexciting. This is the movie equivalent of diarrhea; it's all thrown together, nothing really fits and, in the end, you're just glad it's over.TOTAL: 4% A:","output":"In this task, you are given a review of a movie and you need to classify the review as either positive or negative based on its content.

Austin Bush McHenry (September 22, 1894 – November 27, 1922) was a professional baseball player who played outfielder in the Major Leagues from 1918 to 1922 for the St. Louis Cardinals.

Popularity is often subjective and can be based on various factors such as the individual's personality, public presence, and the level of interest or recognition from fans and other people.

Shortly before the wedding, Tom's old girlfriend Vi (Juli Reding) visits and informs him that she will end Tom's relationship with Meg, using blackmail if necessary. While arguing on top of a lighthouse, the railing Vi is leaning against gives way. She manages to briefly hang on, but Tom refuses to help and watches her fall to her death. The next day, Tom sees Vi's body floating in the water. He retrieves her only to see the body turn into seaweed. Tom tries to forget what he's seen, but over the next several days, all manner of strange occurrences happen. Vi's watch washes up on the beach and mysterious footprints appear in the sand. Before long, Vi's ghost appears and tells Tom that she will haunt him for the rest of his life. One day, Meg's little sister Sandy shows up and asks Tom if she can see the engagement ring. As Tom shows it to Sandy, he's spooked by a disembodied hand that soon makes off with the ring. Soon afterward, a party is held for Tom and Meg. Vi's disembodied head makes a small appearance in a photo taken of Tom and Meg, and when he's alone, Vi taunts Tom that she'll now use her voice to tell the world how Tom Stewart killed her.

The cutest of the Dalmatians was, of course, little Snowball who was completely spotless till the very end of the film.

In fact I have often thought about the possibility that she could become friendly, but now that she so quickly changed into \\"herself\\" again and announced that she was Cruella once more, I almost began to be really worried about Chloe's Dalmatians. Actually, the scene in which the puppies watched Lady and the Tramp while Chloe and Kevin had their dinner, was much better than I had expected. I also was fond of the parrot who played to be a dog, and it was incredible that the dogs had learned so many tricks for this movie.  Of course I was content that at the end the Dalmatians were saved again, but I would have liked to know what was going to happen to Cruella after she had lost her whole property. And what on earth could the dogs' home do with such a huge sum of money?

Premise: on the operation of the defense acquisition system to include (1) a requirement to capture specific design knowledge to be used as exit criteria for transitioning from system integration to system demonstration Hypothesis: The defense acquisition system will include a requirement to capture environmental knowledge.  Does the premise entail the hypothesis?","output":"In order to determine if the premise entails the hypothesis, it is essential to evaluate the key components of both statements, understand their relationship within the defense acquisition system, and assess whether the hypothesis is a direct result of the conditions laid out in the premise.  The premise refers to two specific aspects:  1. The operation of the defense acquisition system. 2. A requirement to capture specific design knowledge to be used as exit criteria for transitioning from system integration to system demonstration. The hypothesis, on the other hand, concerns the inclusion of a requirement to capture environmental knowledge in the defense acquisition system.  Now, let's dissect the defense acquisition system and its operation. The defense acquisition system is a comprehensive framework developed by the Department of Defense (DoD) to ensure the optimal management and procurement of defense-related technologies, products, and services. This system operates under strict guidelines, regulations, and procedures to guarantee the development and delivery of high-quality, reliable, and timely capabilities to meet the needs of the warfighters, while achieving value for both the American taxpayers and the federal government.  The premise focuses on the transition from system integration to system demonstration, which are two crucial stages within the defense acquisition life cycle. System integration refers to the phase in which distinct components of a defense system are assembled, integrated, and evaluated to verify that they function as a cohesive unit. System demonstration, on the other hand, involves the testing and evaluation of the integrated system, confirming its performance in a realistic environment while assessing its compliance with requirements, operational effectiveness, and suitability for deployment. The premise highlights the necessity of capturing specific design knowledge as exit criteria for this transition, ensuring that the system has met the established standards before it becomes eligible for demonstration. The hypothesis seeks to add an additional requirement - the capturing of environmental knowledge. Environmental knowledge could pertain to various factors such as geographical, meteorological, ecological, or human-made conditions that may arise during the operation of defense systems. Such knowledge could be critical to ensuring the adaptability, resilience, and effectiveness of defense technologies in diverse environments and unforeseen circumstances. Assessing the relationship between the premise and the hypothesis, it can be argued that while the hypothesis expands upon the premise, it does not necessarily follow or result directly from the premise's arguments. The hypothesis introduces the idea of capturing environmental knowledge, which, although related to the overall design procedures and evaluation criteria of the defense acquisition system, is not directly discussed in the context of the transition between system integration and system demonstration. In summary, while the hypothesis is somewhat connected to the premise and could potentially complement it, it does not directly result from the premise. Thus, the premise does not entail the hypothesis."},{"instruction":"Explain how you used the definition to come up with the answer.

Once we were seated, our server was slow to approach us and appeared to be overwhelmed by the number of tables they were managing. Our drink orders were taken, but it took an additional 15 minutes to receive them. The beverages were a letdown in both taste and presentation - my cappuccino lacked sufficient foam, and the water we ordered tasted strongly of chlorine. As for the menu, we found it to be fairly limited in its options, specifically in regard to vegetarian and vegan dishes. Despite this, we placed our orders for a salad, a pasta dish, and a sandwich, all of which we were eagerly anticipating. However, the food that arrived was subpar, to say the least. The salad was limp and drowning in dressing, the pasta was overcooked and swimming in a watery sauce, and the sandwich - which should have been the most straightforward of the dishes - was made with stale bread and lacked flavor. It seemed as though there was no quality control in the kitchen, and the dishes were thrown together without attention to detail. Had the ingredients been fresher, portions appropriate, and preparation more thoughtful, these dishes could have been far more enjoyable. To make matters worse, our server rarely checked in on us, causing us to flag them down for additional napkins, a glass of water, and ultimately, the check. We felt as though we were barely on their radar, and the overall experience was greatly impacted by the lack of attentive service. With a heavy heart, I must rate my visit to The Promenade Café with a single star. The poor service, inattention to detail, and substandard quality of food compels me to advise others to seek out a more satisfying dining experience. It is unfortunate when a restaurant possesses the potential to be exceptional, but fails to fulfill the promise of its reputation."},{"instruction":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

Smartphones do make our lives easier . But have you ever thought about what they mean to your eyes? According to a study, half of British people own smartphones and they spend an average   of two hours a day using them. There has been a 35% increase in the number of people in the UK who suffer from shortsightedness since smartphones were introduced there in 1997. Staring at smartphones for long time gives you dry eyes. When looking at something in the distance, your eyes automatically blink a certain number of times. However, when you look at things closer to your face, the blinking slows down. This reduces the amount of tears and causes discomfort in your eyes. Another bad habit is using smartphones in dark rooms before going to sleep. If you look at a bright screen while your pupils become larger, too much light enters your eyes. This can do harm to the eyes and cause a disease called glaucoma . While you're probably not going to stop using to your _ , there are a few things you can do to protect your eyes.

BRUSSELS The European Union will raise the stakes in a confrontation with Russia over Ukraine on Monday by slapping sanctions on Russian officials, a day after voters in Ukraine's Crimea region opted to join Russia in a referendum the EU condemned as illegal.      EU diplomats worked late into the night on Sunday, haggling over a list of people in Crimea and Russia who will be hit with travel bans and asset freezes for actions which \\"threaten the territorial integrity, sovereignty and independence of Ukraine.\\"      The initial list of 120 to 130 names, including senior figures in Russia's military and political establishment, will be whittled down to perhaps \\"tens or scores\\" of people before EU foreign ministers take the final decision in Brussels on Monday, diplomats say.      Ministers are also expected to cancel an EU-Russia Summit scheduled to be held in Sochi in June.      Sunday's Crimea referendum has only reinforced European anger over Russia's military intervention there, despite results showing Crimeans voted overwhelmingly to break away from Ukraine and to join Russia.      An EU statement on Sunday said the referendum was illegal and illegitimate and its outcome would not be recognized.      \\"It is quite clear that the behavior of Russia until now is completely unacceptable,\\" Dutch Foreign Minister Frans Timmermans said as he arrived for a meeting of Socialist foreign ministers in Brussels on Sunday evening.      Timmermans said he expected EU sanctions adopted on Monday would be \\"relatively limited\\" but said there could be more to come, possibly as soon as an EU summit later this week.      The risk of Europe and Russia becoming locked in a damaging spiral of economic retaliation depended on Russia, he said.      \\"I would do anything possible to avoid sanctions, because I believe everybody will suffer if we get into sanctions, but the only ones who can prevent this are the Russians,\\" he said.      SANCTIONS ON THE WAY      German Foreign Minister Frank-Walter Steinmeier, accusing Russia of preparing the annexation of Crimea, said Moscow had not accepted the ways out of the crisis it had been offered.      \\"So (on Monday) we'll have to take decisions that will make clear our attitude to the preparation of this annexation. That will be an area of sanctions in the next step,\\" he told Germany's ZDF television.      He said he would argue for a process of gradually tightening sanctions \\"in which there is a way out at every step.\\"      British Foreign Secretary William Hague said in a statement that the EU must adopt measures on Monday \\"that send a strong signal to Russia that this challenge to the sovereignty and territorial integrity of Ukraine will bring economic and political consequences.\\"      German tabloid newspaper Bild reported last week that the chief executive officers of Russia's two biggest companies - Gazprom's Alexei Miller and Igor Sechin of Rosneft - would be on the final sanctions list, but European diplomats have dismissed that report.      EU foreign ministers are expected on Monday to condemn what they will call \\"an illegal referendum\\" in Crimea, according to a draft statement seen by Reuters.      \\"It was held in the visible presence of armed soldiers under conditions of intimidation of civic activists and journalists, blacking out of Ukrainian television channels and obstruction of civilian traffic in and out of Crimea,\\" they will say.      They will urge Russia to defuse the crisis and hold direct talks with Ukraine's government but will repeat the EU's warning that any further steps by Russia to destabilize the situation in Ukraine would lead to \\"additional and far-reaching consequences for relations in a broad range of economic areas.\\"      Russia's military occupation of Crimea after Ukraine's pro-Russian President Viktor Yanukovich was ousted has provoked a deep crisis in East-West relations reminiscent of the Cold War.      Yanukovich's decision to turn his back on signing a trade and political agreement with the 28-nation EU last November in favor of closer ties with Moscow prompted months of street protests that eventually led to his downfall.

The government in Kiev described the vote as a \\"circus performance\\" and said it would not recognise the result.

Sveta Tweeting from a lunch in #Crimea      Crimean leaders are expected to formally apply to the Kremlin on Monday to join Russia.      The Russian parliament had been expected to wait until Friday to begin debating the relevant legislation. But the BBC's Richard Galpin in Moscow says it is now believed the process of absorbing Crimea could take place under existing laws.      Whatever the procedure is, the indications so far are that it will happen soon, says our correspondent.      Speaking in Brussels, EU foreign policy chief Catherine Ashton said the \\"so-called referendum\\" was \\"illegal under the constitution of Ukraine and under international law\\".      \\"I call upon Russia yet again to meet with Ukrainian leaders and to start a dialogue with them, and to try to move to de-escalation, please, as quickly as possible.

She said the EU \\"can't simply sit back and say this situation can be allowed to happen\\", but that ministers needed to think carefully about what their response should be.      EU foreign ministers from the 28 EU countries, meeting in Brussels, are considering a visa ban and an asset freeze against a number of Russian officials.      The bloc has already suspended talks on an economic pact with Russia and an easing of visa restrictions.      The ministers will now be toughening the measures by discussing a list of names of those who could be subject to an asset freeze and a visa ban.

If an asset freeze and visa ban does not rattle Moscow or Russia makes further military moves into eastern Ukraine, he adds, the EU has already warned of moving to another stage which would involve economic sanctions.      Earlier, the EU said in a statement that the vote was \\"illegal and illegitimate and its outcome will not be recognised\\".

Some 58% of people in Crimea are ethnic Russian, with the rest made up of Ukrainians and Tatars.      Most of the Tatars that the BBC spoke to said they had boycotted the vote, and felt that life under the Kremlin would be worse.      The Tatars were deported to Central Asia by Soviet dictator Joseph Stalin in 1944. They were only able to return with the fall of the Soviet Union and many want to remain in Ukraine. ||||| As Crimea votes in favor of secession, the threat of sanctions with Russia grows. (Reuters)      As Crimea votes in favor of secession, the threat of sanctions with Russia grows. (Reuters)      Having failed to prevent a Russian-sponsored referendum in Crimea, the Obama administration and its European allies refocused their efforts Sunday on keeping Moscow from annexing the autonomous Ukrainian region and expanding its military moves into other parts of Ukraine.      In a telephone call to Russian President Vladi­mir Putin — his third in two weeks — President Obama said that the referendum “would never be recognized by the United States and the international community” and that “we are prepared to impose additional costs on Russia for its actions,” the White House said.      An earlier White House statement, issued as Crimean polls were closing on an overwhelming vote by residents to become part of Russia, called Moscow’s actions “dangerous and destabilizing” and said that “military intervention and violation of international law will bring increasing costs for Russia.”      European Union officials are due to meet Monday to consider measures — including an asset freeze and a travel ban on as-yet-unnamed Russian individuals deemed responsible for military aggression and corruption in Ukraine — that British Foreign Secretary William Hague said “must be adopted.”      But how far the West is prepared to go in punishing Russia for the referendum, and how much further Putin intends to take his quest for control over part, if not all, of Ukraine, remain uncertain.      1 of 43 Full Screen Autoplay Close March 21, 2014 Friday March 19, 2014 March 18, 2014 March 16, 2014 Skip Ad × Crimeans vote on Russia referendum View Photos Crimeans turned out in large numbers for a vote that may determine whether they join Russia or remain with Ukraine.

Shamil Zhumatov/Reuters Buy Photo Wait 1 second to continue.      Obama administration promises last week to exact a cost if the vote were held — even before new Russian military exercises on Ukraine’s eastern and southern borders and Saturday’s seizure of a Ukrainian gas plant just beyond Crimea’s northern boundary — would seem to make the imposition of at least some sanctions this week a foregone conclusion.      The question for the West is whether harsh retribution now will make Putin more or less likely to desist from further action. Although he has so far been impervious to American and European threats, U.S. officials think that the cost the upheaval has already imposed on the Russian economy will become unbearable if Putin does not yield.      The West could also suffer costs if Russia cuts off energy supplies to Europe and further squeezes the Ukrainian economy. But Western officials say that is a price they are willing to pay and have pledged economic support to Ukraine.      At the same time, the Obama administration wants to hold more severe punishment in reserve, to unleash in response to annexation or further Russian attempts to destabilize Ukraine.      “In this century, we are long past the days when the international community will stand quietly by while one country forcibly seizes the territory of another,” the White House statement said. “We call on all members of the international community to continue to condemn such actions, to take concrete steps to impose costs, and to stand together in support of the Ukrainian people and Ukraine’s territorial integrity and sovereignty.”      Short of immediate Russian annexation, U.S. officials said, post-referendum Crimea is likely to continue in a sort of limbo status — while both Russia and the West decide what to do about it.      As he has since the Ukraine crisis began last month, Obama urged Putin to take advantage of “a clear path for resolving this crisis diplomatically” that would allow international monitors to investigate alleged abuses against the ethnic Russians in Crimea whom Moscow says it is protecting. The West, along with numerous reporters in the region, has said the abuses are largely nonexistent.      1 of 62 Full Screen Autoplay Close Skip Ad × Ukraine’s Crimean Peninsula votes on secession referendum View Photos Crimea votes on whether the autonomous region should join Russia.

Vadim Ghirda/AP Buy Photo Wait 1 second to continue.      The Kremlin also reported on the call, saying Putin told Obama that the referendum was “fully consistent with the norms of international law and the U.N. charter” and comparing the Crimea situation to the West’s recognition of a legal framework for the breakup of the former Yugoslavia.      Ukraine’s interim government, under close guidance from the United States and Europe, has offered constitutional reforms and consultation with Russia on a new arrangement for increased Crimean autonomy. Presidential elections scheduled for May 25 in Ukraine will “provide a legitimate opportunity for all Ukrainians to make their voices heard on the future of their country,” the White House repeated Sunday.      But Obama, the White House said, “reiterated that a diplomatic resolution cannot be achieved while Russian military forces continue their incursions into Ukrainian territory and that the large-scale Russian military exercises on Ukraine’s borders only exacerbate the tension.”      There was a small glimmer of optimism early Sunday after a telephone call between Secretary of State John F. Kerry and Russian Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov. The Foreign Ministry said that the two had agreed to continue working toward a solution to the crisis through “an earliest possible launch of constitutional reform” in Ukraine.      A senior State Department official, speaking on the condition of anonymity about the sensitive diplomacy, said that it was “positive to see Russia focusing on the political processes in the form of constitutional reforms that have been ongoing.”      But until Russia ends its “provocative” troop movements, pulls its troops in Crimea back to their barracks and stops its partisans from agitating within Ukrainian cities, the official said, political overtures cannot be taken seriously.      Several senior U.S. lawmakers expressed skepticism about any deal involving Russia.      Senate Foreign Relations Committee Chairman Robert Menendez (D-N.J.) said on “Fox News Sunday”: “Putin has started a game of Russian roulette, and I think that the United States and the West have to be very clear in their response, because he will calculate about how far he can go. So that means having very robust sanctions ready to go, starting with the Crimea vote and moving onward.”      He added: “I think the question will be, what does Russia do in response? And having those sanctions ready — whether it be against the defense minister, the federal security service, the secretary of their security council, possibly the executives of Gazprom and Rosneft, which are their oil and gas companies — send a very clear message.” ||||| What is a one-paragraph summary of the above article?","output":"The EU is set to impose sanctions on Russian officials following a referendum in Ukraine's Crimea region where voters opted to join Russia.

Article: Most shoplifters agree that the January sales offer wonderful opportunities for the hard-working thief. With the shops so crowded and the staff so busy, it does not require any extraordinary talent to help you to take one or two little things and escape unnoticed. It is known, in the business, as \\"hoisting\\".  But the hoisting game is not what it used to be. Even at the height of the sales, shoplifters today never know if they are being watched by one of those evil little balls that hang from the ceilings of so many department stores above the most desirable goods.  As if that was not trouble enough for them, they can now be filmed at work and obliged to attend a showing of their performance in court.  Selfridges was the first big London store to install closed-circuit videotape equipment to watch its sales floors. In October last year the store won its first court case for shoplifting using an evidence a videotape clearly showing a couple stealing dresses. It was an important test case which encouraged other stores to install similar equipment.  When the balls, called sputniks, first make an appearance in shops, it was widely believed that their only function was to frighten shoplifters. Their somewhat ridiculous appearances, the curious holes and red lights going on and off, certainly make the theory believable.  It did not take long, however, for serious shoplifters to start showing suitable respect. Soon after the equipment was in operation at Selfridges, store detective Brian Chadwick was sitting in the control room watching a woman secretly putting bottles of perfume into her bag.   \\"As she turned to go,\\" Chadwick recalled, \\"she suddenly looked up at the 'sputnik' and stopped. She could not possibly have seen that the camera was trained on her because it is completely hidden, but she must have had a feeling that I was looking at her.\\" \\"For a moment she paused, but then she returned to counter and started putting everything back.

Executives Urge Public Financing for Campaigns WASHINGTON (AP)  About 40 current and former corporate executives have a message for Congress: Quit hitting us up for campaign cash. In a letter to Congressional leaders on Friday, the executives urged Congress to approve public financing for House and Senate campaigns. They sent the letter a day after the Supreme Court struck down limits on corporate spending in elections. “Members of Congress already spend too much time raising money from large contributors,” the letter said. “And often, many of us individually are on the receiving end of solicitation phone calls from members of Congress. With additional money flowing into the system due to the court’s decision, the fund-raising pressure on members of Congress will only increase.” The companies represented by the executives who signed the letter include Playboy Enterprises, the ice cream maker Ben & Jerry’s, the Seagram’s liquor company, the toymaker Hasbro, Delta Airlines, Men’s Wearhouse, the Quaker Chemical Corporation, the Brita Products Company, San Diego National Bank, MetLife and Crate and Barrel. They sent the letter through Fair Elections Now, a coalition of good-government groups that has long lobbied Congress to pass legislation establishing public campaign financing. A Senate proposal would finance campaigns with a fee on businesses that get 10 million or more in government contracts. The House would finance it with revenue from auctioning off the television broadcast spectrum, which was opened when the country switched to digital broadcasting.

Danny owned two parcels of land. parcel A had a soil with high salinity levels, while parcel B had a rich and healthy soil.  Given the paragraph above, please answer correctly the following question:   Which parcel had plants with lower chances of surviving stressful conditions?  Hint: A plant's first line of defense against abiotic stress is in its roots. If the soil holding the plant is healthy and biologically diverse, the plant will have a higher chance of surviving stressful conditions.The plant responses to stress are dependent on the tissue or organ affected by the stress. For example, transcriptional responses to stress are tissue or cell specific in roots and are quite different depending on the stress involved.One of the primary responses to abiotic stress such as high salinity is the disruption of the Na+/K+ ratio in the cytoplasm of the plant cell. High concentrations of Na+, for example, can decrease the capacity for the plant to take up water and also alter enzyme and transporter functions. Evolved adaptations to efficiently restore cellular ion homeostasis has led to a wide variety of stress tolerant plants.Facilitation, or the positive interactions between different species of plants, is an intricate web of association in a natural environment. It is how plants work together. In areas of high stress, the level of facilitation is especially high as well. This could possibly be because the plants need a stronger network to survive in a harsher environment, so their interactions between species, such as cross-pollination or mutualistic actions, become more common to cope with the severity of their habitat.Plants also adapt very differently from one another, even from a plant living in the same area. When a group of different plant species was prompted by a variety of different stress signals, such as drought or cold, each plant responded uniquely. Hardly any of the responses were similar, even though the plants had become accustomed to exactly the same home environment.Rice (Oryza sativa) is a classic example. Rice is a staple food throughout the world, especially in China and India. Rice plants experience different types of abiotic stresses, like drought and high salinity. These stress conditions have a negative impact on rice production. Genetic diversity has been studied...

Q:Background: Temperature is a measure of the average kinetic energy of the particles in matter. In everyday usage, temperature indicates a measure of how hot or cold an object is. Temperature is an important parameter in chemistry. When a substance changes from solid to liquid, it is because there was an increase in the temperature of the material. Chemical reactions usually proceed faster if the temperature is increased. Many unstable materials (such as enzymes) will be viable longer at lower temperatures.  Paragraph: Susan went to the store to buy some bags of ice for a party she was having later in the day. When she got home she put one bag of ice in the sink and another in the freezer, but then was distracted by a phone call and forgot to put the other bag in the freezer. When she returned, the bag of ice had melted.

While it would be disappointing for both of you, especially your mother who is a fan, your experience can still remain a positive one by addressing the situation properly and considering alternative options. 1. Resale or Refund: First, you should review the terms and conditions of the tickets purchased for the concert. Depending on the vendor and policies in place, you may be eligible for a refund or the opportunity to resell your tickets. If the event is sold out, you can potentially recover your expenses or even turn a profit by selling the tickets online through authorized platforms. 2. Alternative Transportation: In the event that your initial mode of transportation to Birmingham falls through, you could research alternative ways to reach the city, such as trains, buses, or carpooling options. This may require adjusting your travel schedule or even considering arriving on an earlier date to ensure you make it to the concert on time. 3. Scheduling a New Concert: If attending the Birmingham concert ultimately proves impossible, consider researching whether Santana has any other upcoming shows in nearby locations or cities that may be easier to access. Investing in new tickets as a replacement for the original Birmingham show can still bring an exciting experience for you and your mother. 4. Online Stream or Audio Recording: With social media and modern technology, it is likely that some fans present at the concert will stream the performance either live or recorded. As a last resort, you and your mother could watch or listen to the concert together at home by finding streaming options or audio recordings available post-performance. 5. Organizing a Special Day: While your mother may feel disappointed in not being able to see Santana perform live, you can plan a special day with her to celebrate her love for the musician. From watching rare interviews or live performances on DVD or streaming services to playing a Santana-inspired playlist and enjoying a themed dinner, there are plenty of ways to recreate the essence of the concert in a more intimate setting. 6. Support Beverly Knight: Although your primary interest may have been Santana, considering attending a Beverly Knight concert on her own could be a fun new experience. With her energetic onstage presence, she may be a breakout favorite to watch perform.  In summary, if you and your mother are unable to make it to Birmingham to see Santana play, there are several ways to handle the situation. These include seeking a refund or reselling your tickets, exploring alternative transportation options, searching for other concert dates, watching online streams or listening to recordings, organizing a special day for your mother, or checking out Beverly Knight as an alternative live performance. Although the experience may differ from that initially planned, it's still possible to make lasting memories as you celebrate Santana and his music."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant that follows instruction extremely well.

Pakistan's parliament threatened Saturday to cut off access to a  facility used by NATO forces to  ferry troops into Afghanistan, signaling a growing rift that began when  U.S. commandos killed Osama bin Laden during a raid on a Pakistani  compound. A resolution adopted during a joint session of parliament condemned the U.S. action. It also called for a review of its working agreement with the U.S., demanded an independent investigation and ordered the immediate end of drone attacks along its border region. Failure to end unilateral U.S. raids and drone attacks will force Pakistan to \\"to consider taking necessary steps, including withdrawal of (the) transit facility\\" used by the NATO's International Security Assistance Force, according to the resolution. U.S. lawmakers have questioned how the world's most wanted terrorist managed to live in plain sight for years in Pakistan -- near the country's elite military academy -- without being detected. Pakistani and U.S. intelligence officials have said there is no evidence that any active members of Pakistan's military or intelligence establishment knew about or actively protected the al Qaeda leader. Publicly, leaders in both countries have downplayed a rift. During a stop in Afghanistan Saturday, U.S. Sen. John Kerry stressed that Americans want Pakistan to be \\"a real ally\\" in combating terror. Still, he added, the United States is \\"not trying to find a way to break the relationship apart.\\" \\"We're trying to find a way to build it and to improve it and we need to work at that and that's part of what I'll be doing over the course of the next couple of days,\\" said Kerry, chairman of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee, who also planned to visit Pakistan. The unanimous resolution made clear there was a growing dissatisfaction among Pakistani lawmakers. The resolution also ordered a review of its counter-terrorism cooperation agreement with the United States. The government is deeply \\"distress(ed) on the campaign to malign Pakistan, launched by certain quarters in other countries without appreciating Pakistan's determined efforts and immense sacrifices in combating terror,\\" the resolution said. It also said more than 30,000 Pakistani civilians and more than 5,000 military personnel had been killed in its fight against terror \\"and the blowback emanating from actions of the NATO/ISAF forces in Afghanistan.\\" Anger over U.S. drone strikes has mounted during the past year after it stepped up efforts along the Pakistani-Afghan border. On Friday, a suspected U.S. drone strike killed four suspected Islamic militants in the Datta Khel region of North Waziristan, according to two Pakistani intelligence officials. They said an unmanned aircraft fired four missiles at a militant's vehicle on the border area. The demands by the Pakistani civilian government come as new details emerge about the raid on bin Laden's Abbottabad compound. Members of the U.S. Navy SEAL team that attacked the compound were wearing helmet-mounted digital cameras that recorded the mission, a U.S. military official told CNN on Friday. The official described the digital recording as hazy, fast-moving and subject to poor lighting in the rooms. The source also said it is hard to get clear images from the footage. \\"This is not movie-quality stuff,\\" the official said. An official familiar with the material seized from the compound said Friday that Navy SEALs recovered a stash of pornography. The official would not discuss exactly where it was found, what it was or whether it is believed to belong to the al Qaeda leader or to someone else living at the site, such as bin Laden's couriers or his son. Both officials spoke on condition of anonymity because they were not authorized to release the information. Bin Laden's compound is also undergoing intense analysis, and U.S. officials say he apparently enjoyed a support network in Pakistan that allowed him to stay in one location for the past several years. He had no escape plan or means to destroy his reams and gigabytes of documents in the event of an enemy assault, according to the U.S. sources. Two U.S. lawmakers joined a public chorus for the release of photos of bin Laden's body after seeing the images themselves. \\"These are very graphic, gruesome pictures,\\" said Rep. Doug Lamborn, a  Republican from Colorado. But seeing them \\"gave me a sense of finality and closure.\\" A conservative legal watchdog group has filed the first lawsuit seeking the public release of the video and photographs of the raid and its aftermath. Judicial Watch is asking the Department of Defense to comply with a Freedom of Information request for the material, especially photos of bin Laden's body. The legal complaint to force compliance was made in federal court in Washington on Friday. CNN's Reza Sayah, Barbara Starr, Michael Martinez, Pam Benson and Larry Shaughnessy contributed to this report. Here is a summary of the highlights for this article:","output":"1. Pakistan's parliament threatened to cut off access to a facility used by NATO forces to ferry troops into Afghanistan. This is in response to growing tensions between Pakistan and the US after the killing of Osama bin Laden by US commandos in Pakistan.   2. A resolution adopted during a joint session of parliament condemned the US action, called for a review of its working agreement with the US, demanded an independent investigation, and ordered the immediate end of drone attacks along its border region. 3. US lawmakers questioned how bin Laden managed to live in plain sight for years in Pakistan without being detected. Both Pakistani and US intelligence officials claim that there is no evidence of active members of Pakistan's military or intelligence establishment knowing about or protecting bin Laden. 4. Despite tensions, leaders from both countries have publicly downplayed a rift. US Sen. John Kerry stressed that Americans want Pakistan to be \\"a real ally\\" in combating terror. 5. Anger in Pakistan over US drone strikes has increased over the past year, with increased activity along the Pakistani-Afghan border. 6. New details about the raid on bin Laden's compound are emerging, including the use of helmet-mounted digital cameras by the Navy SEAL team. 7. US officials claim bin Laden had a support network in Pakistan that allowed him to stay in one location for several years without an escape plan or means to destroy his documents in case of an enemy assault. 8. US lawmakers and a conservative legal watchdog group are pushing for the release of photos of bin Laden's body, as well as video and photographs of the raid and its aftermath."},{"instruction":"Q:You are considering whether to buy a product.

In the first quarter, the Chargers would score 2 field goals to start out:  Travis Coons kicked them both from 21 and 40 yards out to make the lead 3-0 to 6-0.  The Browns took the lead however when DeShone Kizer found David Njoku on a 28-yard pass to make it 7-6.  Though, the Chargers would move back into the lead when Coons kicked his third field goal of the day from 22 yards out to make it 9-7.  This would remain the halftime score as neither team scored in the second quarter.  In the third quarter however, the Chargers managed to increase their lead when Philip Rivers found Keenan Allen on a 7-yard pass to make it 16-7.  This would be followed up by Coons kicking a fourth field goal from 27 yards out to put his team up 19-7.  The Browns scored their only points in the half during the fourth quarter when Zane Gonzalez kicked a 35-yard field goal. The losing streak continued as the Browns fell to the Chargers 19-10.

Answer a question about this article: Because of the sudden loss of the New Orleans franchise, the league announced in October that the beginning of the free agency period would be delayed in order to accommodate a dispersal draft. Dates were eventually announced as December 2 for the dispersal draft and December 4 for free agency, but shortly before the draft the league issued a press release announcing the draft had been postponed one day to December 3. Shortly thereafter, another press release announced that the draft would be held on December 9 and free agency would commence on December 11. However, the draft still never took place, and instead another press release was issued stating that both the draft and free agency had been postponed indefinitely. Rumors began circulating that the league was in trouble and on the verge of folding, but owners denied those claims.

Paragraph: Catherine V. \\"Ginny\\" Kilgore of Oxford, an attorney with North Mississippi Rural Legal Services, has been recognized for her dedication to serving the indigent. Kilgore - who oversees delivering legal services to the disabled and elderly in 39 north Mississippi counties - is recipient of the University of Mississippi School of Law's 2002 Public Service Award. The award was announced recently at a dinne r, held in Kilgore's honor and hosted by law school Dean Samuel M. Davis, who presented her with an engraved plaque. \\"Ginny Kilgore is a public servant in the truest sense,\\" said Davis. \\"Her selection continues the tradition of this award in recognizing those who have labored in the trenches, with little or no compensation but with great professional and personal satisfaction in helping to bring justice and equality to those who need it most.\\" \\"This award means a great deal to me,\\" Kilgore said, pointing to others so honored. \\"The work of those who received the award before me has been so important; I feel very honored.\\" After earning bachelor's and master's degrees in education and a few years teaching, Kilgore enrolled at the UM law school. Upon graduation in 1975, she entered private law practice in Oxford, joining NMRLS in 1978. Since then, she has earned promotions from managing attorney, senior attorney, then director of the Council on Aging project. Since 1990, she has worked in the Administrative Law Unit and Resource Development, and directed the Elder Law Project, serving the northern half of the state. She also is an adjunct professor in the UM law school's Civil Law Clinic. She held a similar post a few years ago in the school's Elder Law Clinic. Kilgore says she's found her niche. \\"I've always thought it was important to do work to help people. I really enjoy it. The issues I've dealt with through the years have been on the side of helping people maintain the basics of life - home, healt h care, jobs and family.\\" She says her desire to serve others was sparked early, growing up in a single-parent home, aware that her widowed mother faced certain challenges as she supported her four children through public school and college.

On the one hand were the decimation of the population by the Black Death of 1348 and subsequent years of epidemics — and on the other, the series of wars and riots that followed. Among these were the War of the Union, a citizen revolt against the excesses of the monarchy, led by Valencia as the capital of the kingdom — and the war with Castile, which forced the hurried raising of a new wall to resist Castilian attacks in 1363 and 1364. In these years the coexistence of the three communities that occupied the city—Christian, Jewish and Muslim — was quite contentious. The Jews who occupied the area around the waterfront had progressed economically and socially, and their quarter gradually expanded its boundaries at the expense of neighbouring parishes. Meanwhile, Muslims who remained in the city after the conquest were entrenched in a Moorish neighbourhood next to the present-day market Mosen Sorel. In 1391 an uncontrolled mob attacked the Jewish quarter, causing its virtual disappearance and leading to the forced conversion of its surviving members to Christianity. The Muslim quarter was attacked during a similar tumult among the populace in 1456, but the consequences were minor. When was the Muslim section attacked? What is the answer?

Jonathan Swift said, “Everybody wants to live forever, but nobody wants to grow old.”  Wouldn’t it be nice if we could stay healthy and young and live as long as possible? Because that is a deep down desire of the majority, many people are always on a quest to slow down the aging process. So, our question for today is: What are the Anti-Aging Benefits of the Mediterranean Diet? First, we must acknowledge that no diet in the world can halt or slow the aging process. Aging is inevitable and food is not the elixir of life – although the type of food you choose can lengthen or shorten your life. What has been proven by numerous studies is that the Mediterranean diet lessens your risks of getting certain diseases. It also offers a range of health benefits that will allow you to age in a healthy way. When you whole-heartedly adopt the Mediterranean way of eating, you will reduce your risk of health problems such as Alzheimer’s, Parkinson’s, stroke, heart diseases, etc. That alone can be classified as anti-aging. Old age is often associated with health problems. If you can grow old and maintain your health, that would be a fine way to live. The Mediterranean diet can help you do that. Unfortunately, the standard diet for most Americans is filled with junk food, sugary sodas, fast foods and processed, additive-filled food, etc. – basically empty calories. Obesity is an epidemic. People eat whatever is the most convenient with little regard for their health. This is very upsetting and dangerous for the population as a whole. There is a wide assumption that healthy food is not delicious. People believe that to eat healthy they must live on a steady diet of raw carrots and steamed chicken breasts. As a result, they choose not to do so. They would much rather have a fast-food burger and cheese fries – it’s easier and tastier. Question: What is probably true about the author? Options:  A.

As a result, the blades will not be able to spin as quickly or efficiently as they would on a day with higher wind speeds. The shaft of the turbine, which connects the spinning blades to the generator, will also experience a decrease in rotational speed due to the weaker force from the blades. This reduction in speed directly impacts the generator, as it relies on the shaft's rotation to generate electricity. Inside the generator, the spinning shaft rotates a rotor that is surrounded by magnets and wire loops. The rotation of the rotor within this magnetic field is what generates electricity. However, when the rotor spins less due to the reduced wind speed, the level of electricity generated decreases as well. In summary, when there are low winds, the entire process of electricity generation by a wind turbine is affected, especially the rotor's rotation. The rotor will rotate less in the generator, resulting in a lower output of electricity. This demonstrates the variable nature of wind energy and highlights the importance of having a diverse mix of energy sources to ensure reliable power generation under varying weather conditions."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Given the question: Information:  - The genocide in Bangladesh began on 26 March 1971 with the launch of Operation Searchlight, as West Pakistan began a military crackdown on the Eastern wing of the nation to suppress Bengali calls for self-determination rights. During the nine-month-long Bangladesh war for independence, members of the Pakistani military and supporting Islamist militias from Jamaat-e-Islami killed up to 3,000,000 people and raped between 200,000 and 400,000 Bangladeshi women in a systematic campaign of genocidal rape. Some estimates mention the number of people killed between 300,000500,000, and describe the 3 million number as excessively inflated. The actions against women were supported by Imams and Muslim religious leaders, who declared that Bengali women were 'war-booty'. It is estimated that up to 30 million civilians became internally displaced. During the war there was also ethnic violence between Bengalis and Urdu-speaking Biharis. Several thousand non-Bengalis were also killed during the war.  - Bangladesh ( , \\"The country of Bengal\\"), officially the People's Republic of Bangladesh (  \\"Gônôprôjatôntri Bangladesh\\"), is a country in South Asia. It shares land borders with India and Myanmar (Burma). Nepal, Bhutan and China are located near Bangladesh but do not share a border with it. The country's maritime territory in the Bay of Bengal is roughly equal to the size of its land area. Bangladesh is the world's eighth most populous country. Dhaka is its capital and largest city, followed by Chittagong which has the country's largest port.  - East Pakistan, present-day Bangladesh, was a provincial state of Pakistan that existed in the Bengal region of the northeast of South Asia from 1955 until 1971, following the One Unit programme that laid the existence of East Pakistan.  - The right of nations to self-determination (from ) is a cardinal principle in modern international law (commonly regarded as a \\"jus cogens\\" rule), binding, as such, on the United Nations as authoritative interpretation of the Charters norms. It states that nations, based on respect for the principle of equal rights and fair equality of opportunity, have the right to freely choose their sovereignty and international political status with no interference. This principle can be traced to the Atlantic Charter, signed on 14 August 1941, by Franklin D. Roosevelt, President of the United States of America, and Winston Churchill, Prime Minister of the United Kingdom, who pledged The Eight Principal points of the Charter. It also is derived from principles espoused by United States President Woodrow Wilson following World War I, after which some new nation states were formed, or previous states were revived after the dissolution of empires. The principle does not state how the decision is to be made, nor what the outcome should be, whether it be independence, federation, protection, some form of autonomy or full assimilation. Neither does it state what the delimitation between nations should benor what constitutes a nation. There are conflicting definitions and legal criteria for determining which groups may legitimately claim the right to self-determination.  - The Bangladesh Liberation War ('), also known as the Bangladesh War of Independence, or simply the Liberation War in Bangladesh, was a revolution and armed conflict sparked by the rise of the Bengali nationalist and self-determination movement in East Pakistan and the 1971 Bangladesh genocide. It resulted in the independence of the People's Republic of Bangladesh. The war began after the Pakistani military junta based in West Pakistan launched Operation Searchlight against the people of East Pakistan on the night of 25 March 1971. It pursued the systematic elimination of nationalist Bengali civilians, students, intelligentsia, religious minorities and armed personnel. The junta annulled the results of the 1970 elections and arrested Prime Minister-elect Sheikh Mujibur Rahman.  - West Pakistan was one of the two exclaves created at the formation of the modern State of Pakistan following the 1947 Partition of India.  - Pakistan (or ), officially the Islamic Republic of Pakistan, is a federal parliamentary republic in South Asia on crossroads of Central Asia and Western Asia. It is the sixth-most populous country with a population exceeding 200 million people. It is the 36th largest country in the world in terms of area with an area covering . Pakistan has a coastline along the Arabian Sea and the Gulf of Oman in the south and is bordered by India to the east, Afghanistan to the west, Iran to the southwest and China in the far northeast respectively. It is separated from Tajikistan by Afghanistan's narrow Wakhan Corridor in the north, and also shares a maritime border with Oman.  - Operation Searchlight was a planned military operation carried out by the Pakistan Army to curb the Bengali nationalist movement in the erstwhile East Pakistan in March 1971, which the Pakistani state justified on the basis of anti-Bihari violence by Bengalis in early March. Ordered by the central government in West Pakistan, this was seen as the sequel to \\"Operation Blitz\\" which had been launched in November 1970. The original plan envisioned taking control of the major cities on March 26, and then eliminating all opposition, political or military, within one month. President Yahya Khan at a conference in February 1971 said \\"Kill three million of them and the rest will eat out of our hands.\\" Prolonged Bengali resistance was not anticipated by the Pakistani military leaders. The main phase of Operation Searchlight ended with the fall of the last major town in Bengali hands in mid-May. The operation also precipitated the 1971 Bangladesh genocide and caused roughly 10 million refugees to flee to India as well as the death of up to 3,000,000 civilians. Bengali intelligentsia, academics and Hindus were targeted for the harshest treatment, with significant indiscriminate killing taking place. These systematic killings enraged the Bengalis, who declared independence from Pakistan, to establish the new state of Bangladesh.  - Sheikh Mujibur Rahman (17 March 1920  15 August 1975) was the founding leader of Bangladesh. He served twice as the country's President and was its strongman premier between 1972 and 1975. Rahman was the leader of the Awami League. He is popularly known as the Bangabandhu (\\"Friend of Bengal\\"). He is credited as the central figure in Bangladesh's liberation movement and is considered the founding father of Bangladesh. His daughter Sheikh Hasina Wajed is the current Prime Minister of Bangladesh.  - Ranadaprasad Saha ( Bengali :   ) ( 15 November 1896 -- May 1971 ) , also known as RP Saha and Ranoda Proshad Shaha , was a famous Bangladeshi businessman and philanthropist , who during the Bangladesh Liberation War was picked up from home by the Pakistani army on 7 May 1971 and never returned home .  - Bengal (bgl; Bengali: ,  and ) is a region in Asia which is located in the eastern part of the Indian subcontinent at the apex of the Bay of Bengal.

Write a title for this article: At the top of the quarterback categories this season, right around Tom Brady and Matt Ryan and Andy Dalton, there’s a name that would have been unfamiliar to most pro football fans a year ago: Dak Prescott. A fourth-round pick out of Mississippi State, Prescott was pressed into service by the Cowboys in his rookie season after Tony Romo suffered a compression fracture in his back in the preseason. It seemed like a blow to the Cowboys’ hopes, and fans began counting the days till Romo’s hoped-for midseason return. But it turns out, Prescott can play some football. After losing the opener to the Giants by a point, Prescott and the Cowboys have run off six straight wins and taken a two-game lead at the top of the N.F.C. East. Prescott ranks third among the current starting quarterbacks in adjusted yards per pass, behind only Brady and Ryan. Only the Raiders’ Derek Carr and Trevor Siemian of the reigning Super Bowl champion Broncos can match his six wins. Prescott’s nine touchdown passes already ties the Cowboys’ rookie record, set by Troy Aikman in 11 games in 1989. Playing against a strong Eagles defense on Sunday night, Prescott struggled with the blitz at first, but kept his team in the game, rallied from a 10-point deficit in the fourth quarter, and won in overtime with a 5-yard touchdown pass to Jason Witten. But now Romo is just about ready to come back, having returned to practice last week, giving the Cowboys a classic quarterback problem. Romo’s talents have been in dispute among football fans for years. Although his numbers have almost always been solid, he has been criticized for failing to take Dallas to the next level. Since he took over as a starter in 2006, the Cowboys have made the playoffs only four times, with a record there of 2-4. Numerous 8-8 and 9-7 seasons could be viewed as consistency, or mediocrity. Injuries have also been a concern. Romo had perhaps his best season in 2014, making his fourth Pro Bowl, but then missed most of 2015 with a broken collarbone. His latest injury, and his age, 36, have some thinking that he is at the end of the line. The team has announced Prescott will start next Sunday, giving him a good opportunity to increase his statistics against the woeful Cleveland Browns. But after that, it is unclear. Teams generally do not like to take away a player’s job just because of injury. But after the Eagles game, more and more are convinced that it would be foolish to sit Prescott now. The Washington Post: “It would be football malpractice at this point for the Cowboys to even consider going back to Romo.” Bleacher Report: “So long, Tony Romo.” “This team belongs to Prescott now.” The Ringer: “Right now, it feels like a Romo-led team would be headed to brave moral victory in the second round of the playoffs, and like a Prescott-led team could do anything.” In 1996, the Cowboys had won three of the previous four Super Bowls. Barry Switzer was the coach. Since then, they haven’t been the Browns, but they also haven’t been the storied franchise that chased championships nearly every year. Forgive Dallas fans for seeing visions of Meredith, Aikman and Staubach in the young Prescott. An earlier version of this article misstated the year in which Tony Romo became a starter for the Cowboys. It was 2006, not 2005. The article also omitted a current starting quarterback who has a record of six wins. In addition to Dak Prescott and Trevor Siemian, Derek Carr of the Raiders has six wins.

A month or two later I hit it again when I was putting a portable step fence panel in the bed of the truck and it bounced and split the bridge of my nose and hit the tooth again. did not break or get displaced.

So almost 6 months later I was flying to a meeting in Orlando and of course the tooth decided to react to changes in atmospheric pressure just so I could experience the exquisite pain of barodontalgia. Kind of pain that makes you want to pry the top of your head off with a pitchfork because it would take your mind off the pain. Problem was it did not resolve after landing or anytime during the 4 days I was at the meeting.

Q:Read the following paragraph and extract the answer for the question: What was the full name of the location where Richard II began his procession?  When Richard II was crowned in 1377, he led a procession from the Tower to Westminster Abbey. This tradition began in at least the early 14th century and lasted until 1660. During the Peasants' Revolt of 1381 the Tower of London was besieged with the King inside. When Richard rode out to meet with Wat Tyler, the rebel leader, a crowd broke into the castle without meeting resistance and looted the Jewel House. The Archbishop of Canterbury, Simon Sudbury, took refuge in St John's Chapel, hoping the mob would respect the sanctuary. However, he was taken away and beheaded on Tower Hill. Six years later there was again civil unrest, and Richard spent Christmas in the security of the Tower rather than Windsor as was more usual. When Henry Bolingbroke returned from exile in 1399, Richard was imprisoned in the White Tower. He abdicated and was replaced on the throne by Bolingbroke, who became King Henry IV. In the 15th century, there was little building work at the Tower of London, yet the castle still remained important as a place of refuge. When supporters of the late Richard II attempted a coup, Henry IV found safety in the Tower of London. During this period, the castle also held many distinguished prisoners. The heir to the Scottish throne, later King James I of Scotland, was kidnapped while journeying to France in 1406 and held in the Tower. The reign of Henry V (1413–1422) renewed England's fortune in the Hundred Years' War against France. As a result of Henry's victories, such as the Battle of Agincourt, many high-status prisoners were held in the Tower of London until they were ransomed.Much of the latter half of the 15th century was occupied by the Wars of the Roses between the claimants to the throne, the houses of Lancaster and York. The castle was once again besieged in 1460, this time by a Yorkist force. The Tower was damaged by artillery fire but only surrendered when Henry VI was captured at the Battle of Northampton. With the help of Richard Neville, 16th Earl of Warwick (nicknamed \\"the Kingmaker\\")...

It’s quite uncommon, but essentially I can get an excruciating migraine in my arm, leg, etc., on top of getting them in my head/temples. For years my family and I had no idea what was happening, and with no vocabulary to properly explain what was happening, I described it for about fifteen years as “beeping.” Doctors told us it was anything from growth spurts to a grab for attention, and for a while I gave up trying to figure out what they were. When they got worse and I couldn’t ignore them anymore, I was finally sent to a neurologist, who diagnosed me with ice pick headaches. I let out a sigh of relief that I didn’t even know I was holding in; I felt like I could finally breathe. Years of stress and confusion washed off of me, and I started taking a beta blocker to prevent them. I’ve been on them for a few years now, and it’s changed my life for the better. I used to be terrified of learning to drive, for many reasons, but a large one being that if I got an ice pick headache on the road, I couldn’t guarantee the safety of those around me if I was at the wheel. Now I’m considering finally getting my license (considering - I still don’t like being behind the wheel), I don’t double over in white hot pain randomly anymore, and when I do get a cluster headache, I can still function.

Answer the above question based on the context below:  Edmund Sharpe was born on 31 October 1809 at Brook Cottage, Brook Street in Knutsford, Cheshire, the first child of Francis and Martha Sharpe.  His father, a peripatetic music teacher and organist at Knutsford parish church, came from Stamford in Lincolnshire.  At the time of marriage his wife, Martha Whittaker, was on the staff of an academy for young ladies, Belvedere House, in Bath, Somerset. During his childhood in Knutsford, the young Edmund played with Elizabeth Stevenson, the future Mrs Gaskell. In 1812 the Sharpe family moved across town from Over Knutsford to a farm in Nether Knutsford called Heathside, when Francis Sharpe then worked as both farmer and music teacher.  Edmund was initially educated by his parents, but by 1818 he was attending a school in Knutsford.  Two years later he was a boarder at a school near Runcorn, and in 1821 at Burney's Academy in Greenwich. Edmund's father died suddenly in November 1823, aged 48, and his mother moved to Lancaster with her family, where she later resumed her teaching career.Edmund continued his education at Burney's Academy, and became head boy. In August 1827 he moved to Sedbergh School (then in the West Riding of Yorkshire, now in Cumbria), where he remained for two years. In November 1829 he entered St John's College, Cambridge as a Lupton scholar. At the end of his course in 1832 he was awarded a Worts Travelling Bachelorship by the University of Cambridge, which enabled him to travel abroad for three years' study.  At this time his friend from Lancaster at Trinity College, William Whewell, was Professor of Mineralogy. John Hughes, Edmund Sharpe's biographer, is of the opinion that Whewell was influential in gaining this award for Sharpe. Edmund graduated BA in 1833, and was admitted to the degree of MA in 1836. During his time abroad he travelled in Germany and southern France, studying Romanesque and early Gothic architecture. He had intended to travel further into northern France, but his tour was curtailed in Paris owing to \\"fatigue and illness\\"....

Does the sentence \\"The second decline was not as complete as the first.\\" answer the question \\"Why was the second decline in popularity not a strong as the first?\\"","output":"The sentence \\"The second decline was not as complete as the first\\" does provide some information in response to the question \\"Why was the second decline in popularity not as strong as the first?\\" but it does not offer a detailed, comprehensive answer. It only states a fact – that the second decline wasn't as complete – without delving into the underlying reasons or factors contributing to this difference. To provide a long and detailed answer to the question, several potential reasons or factors might be explored: 1. Adaptation and learning: After experiencing the first decline, it is possible that the subject in question learned from its mistakes, made necessary adjustments, or adapted its approach, which resulted in a less severe second decline. 2. Changing external factors: The first decline may have been heavily influenced by external factors, such as a negative event or unfavorable market conditions. If the second decline occurred in a more stable or positive environment, the impact may have been less severe. 3. Strengthening of core supporters: After the first decline, it could be that the remaining supporters became more committed and loyal to the subject, thereby minimizing the impact of the second decline. 4. Less novelty or shock value: The first decline in popularity might have been exceptionally sharp due to the element of surprise or novelty involved in the initial downturn. If the subject's popularity was initially unfaltering, the first decline would have come as a shock to many and may have amplified its impact. However, by the second decline, the fluctuating popularity might be seen as a more common occurrence or less surprising, thus reducing the decline's overall severity. 5. Improved crisis management: Lessons from the first decline may have led to better management strategies during the second decline, preventing a more severe downturn. 6. Impact of initial decline: The base level of popularity after the first decline might have been, in a sense, \\"resistant\\" to further declines – i.e., losses from the second decline may have affected only those supporters who were not significantly deterred by the first decline. This could lead to the appearance of a less severe second decline. In conclusion, while the sentence \\"The second decline was not as complete as the first\\" does convey that the second decline was less severe than the first, it does not adequately answer the question about why this was the case. A detailed answer would explore multiple reasons or factors that contributed to the difference in severity between the two declines in popularity."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant, who knows every language and how to translate one language to another.

Information:  - Operation Banner was the operational name for the British Armed Forces ' operation in Northern Ireland from August 1969 to July 2007 . It was initially deployed at the request of the unionist government of Northern Ireland to support the Royal Ulster Constabulary ( RUC ) . After the 1998 Belfast Agreement , the operation was gradually scaled down . Its role was to assert the authority of the government of the United Kingdom in Northern Ireland . The main opposition to the British military 's deployment came from the Provisional Irish Republican Army ( IRA ) . It waged a guerrilla campaign against the British military from 1970 - 97 . An internal British Army document released in 2007 stated that , whilst it had failed to defeat the IRA , it had made it impossible for the IRA to win through violence , and reduced substantially the death toll in the last years of conflict .  - The War Office was a department of the British Government responsible for the administration of the British Army between the 17th century and 1964, when its functions were transferred to the Ministry of Defence.  - The Royal Ulster Constabulary was the police force in Northern Ireland from 1922 to 2001. Following the awarding of the George Cross in 2000, its formal title became the Royal Ulster Constabulary, GC. It was founded on 1 June 1922 out of the Royal Irish Constabulary (RIC). At its peak the force had around 8,500 officers with a further 4,500 who were members of the RUC Reserve. During the Troubles, 319 members of the RUC were killed and almost 9,000 injured in paramilitary assassinations or attacks, mostly by the Provisional IRA, which made, by 1983, the RUC the most dangerous police force in the world in which to serve. In the same period, the RUC killed 55 people, 28 of whom were civilians.  - The British Army is the principal land warfare force of the United Kingdom. The force was initially administered by the War Office from London, which in 1964 was subsumed into the Ministry of Defence. The professional head of the British Army is the Chief of the General Staff.  - Ulster (or \\"Cúige Uladh\\" , Ulster Scots: \\"Ulstèr\\" or \\"Ulster\\") is a province in the north of the island of Ireland. In ancient Ireland, it was one of the fifths ruled by a \\"rí ruirech\\", or \\"king of over-kings\\".  - Ireland, also described as the Republic of Ireland ('), is a sovereign state in north-western Europe occupying about five-sixths of the island of Ireland. The capital and largest city is Dublin, which is located on the eastern part of the island, and whose metropolitan area is home to around a third of the country's 4.75 million inhabitants. The state shares its only land border with Northern Ireland, a part of the United Kingdom. It is otherwise surrounded by the Atlantic Ocean, with the Celtic Sea to the south, Saint George's Channel to the south-east, and the Irish Sea to the east. It is a unitary, parliamentary republic. The legislature, the ', consists of a lower house, ', an upper house, ', and an elected President (') who serves as the largely ceremonial head of state, but with some important powers and duties. The head of government is the ' (Prime Minister, literally 'Chief', a title not used in English), who is elected by the Dáil and appointed by the President, and appoints other government ministers.  - Humanitarian aid is material and logistic assistance to people in need. It is usually short-term help until the long-term help by government and other institutions replaces it. Among the people in need belong homeless, refugees, victims of natural disasters, wars and famines. The primary purpose of humanitarian aid is to save lives, reduce suffering and respect to human dignity. Humanitarian aid is material or logistical assistance provided for humanitarian purposes, typically in response to humanitarian crises including natural disasters and man-made disaster. The primary objective of humanitarian aid is to save lives, alleviate suffering, and maintain human dignity. It may therefore be distinguished from development aid, which seeks to address the underlying socioeconomic factors which may have led to a crisis or emergency.  - The Good Friday Agreement (GFA) or Belfast Agreement (or ; Ulster-Scots: \\"Guid Friday Greeance\\" or \\"Bilfawst Greeance\\") was a major political development in the Northern Ireland peace process of the 1990s.   - The government of Northern Ireland is, generally speaking, whatever political body exercises political authority over Northern Ireland. A number of separate systems of government exist or have existed in Northern Ireland.   - The Northern Ireland Act 1998 (c.47) is an Act of the Parliament of the United Kingdom which established a devolved legislature for Northern Ireland, the Northern Ireland Assembly, after decades of direct rule from Westminster.  - The Northern Ireland Assembly (Ulster Scots: \\"Norlin Airlan Assemblie\\") is the devolved legislature of Northern Ireland. It has power to legislate in a wide range of areas that are not explicitly reserved to the Parliament of the United Kingdom, and to appoint the Northern Ireland Executive. It sits at Parliament Buildings at Stormont in Belfast.  - The George Cross (GC) is the second highest award of the United Kingdom honours system. It is awarded for gallantry \\"not in the face of the enemy\\" to members of the British armed forces and to British civilians. It has always been able to be awarded posthumously. It was previously awarded to Commonwealth countries, most of which have established their own honours systems and no longer recommend British honours. It may be awarded to a person of any military rank in any service and to civilians including police, emergency services and merchant seamen although no British civilian has received the award since 1976. Many of the awards have been personally presented by the British monarch to both recipients and in the case of posthumous awards to next of kin. These investitures are usually held at Buckingham Palace.  - Northern Ireland (; Ulster Scots: \\"\\") is a top-level constituent unit of the United Kingdom in the northeast of Ireland. It is variously described as a country, province, region, or \\"part\\" of the United Kingdom, amongst other terms. Northern Ireland shares a border to the south and west with the Republic of Ireland. In 2011, its population was 1,810,863, constituting about 30% of the island's total population and about 3% of the UK's population. Established by the Northern Ireland Act 1998 as part of the Good Friday Agreement, the Northern Ireland Assembly holds responsibility for a range of devolved policy matters, while other areas are reserved for the British government. Northern Ireland co-operates with the Republic of Ireland in some areas, and the Agreement granted the Republic the ability to \\"put forward views and proposals\\" with \\"determined efforts to resolve disagreements between the two governments\\".  - A paramilitary is a semi-militarized force whose organizational structure, tactics, training, subculture, and (often) function are similar to those of a professional military, but which is not included as part of a state's formal armed forces.  - The military, also called the armed forces, are forces authorized to use deadly force, and weapons, to support the interests of the state and some or all of its citizens. The task of the military is usually defined as defense of the state and its citizens, and the prosecution of war against another state. The military may also have additional sanctioned and non-sanctioned functions within a society, including, the promotion of a political agenda, protecting corporate economic interests, internal population control, construction, emergency services, social ceremonies, and guarding important areas. The military can also function as a discrete subculture within a larger civil society, through the development of separate infrastructures, which may include housing, schools, utilities, food production and banking.  - The British Armed Forces form the military of the United Kingdom, tasked with defence of the country, its overseas territories, and the Crown dependencies. They also promote the UK's wider interests, support international peacekeeping efforts, and provide humanitarian aid.  - The United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland, commonly known as the United Kingdom (UK) or Britain, is a sovereign country in western Europe. Lying off the north-western coast of the European mainland, it includes the island of Great Britain (the name of which is also loosely applied to the whole country), the north-eastern part of the island of Ireland, and many smaller islands. Northern Ireland is the only part of the UK that shares a land border with another sovereign statethe Republic of Ireland. Apart from this land border, the UK is surrounded by the Atlantic Ocean, with the North Sea to its east, the English Channel to its south and the Celtic Sea to its south-south-west, giving it the 12th-longest coastline in the world. The Irish Sea lies between Great Britain and Ireland. With an area of , the UK is the 78th-largest sovereign state in the world and the 11th-largest in Europe. It is also the 21st-most populous country, with an estimated 65.1 million inhabitants. Together, this makes it the fourth most densely populated country in the European Union.  - The Troubles is the common name for the ethno-nationalist conflict in Northern Ireland during the late 20th century. Also known internationally as the Northern Ireland conflict, it is sometimes described as a \\"guerrilla war\\" or \\"low-level war\\". The conflict began in the late 1960s and is usually deemed to have ended with the Good Friday \\"Belfast\\" Agreement of 1998. Although the Troubles mainly took place in Northern Ireland, violence spilled over at times into parts of the Republic of Ireland, England and mainland Europe.  - A police force is a constituted body of persons empowered by the state to enforce the law, protect property, and limit civil disorder. Their powers include the legitimized use of force. The term is most commonly associated with police services of a sovereign state that are authorized to exercise the police power of that state within a defined legal or territorial area of responsibility. Police forces are often defined as being separate from military or other organizations involved in the defense of the state against foreign aggressors; however, gendarmerie are military units charged with civil policing.  - The Crown dependencies are three territories of the United Kingdom: the Isle of Man in the Irish Sea, and the Bailiwicks of Jersey and Guernsey in the English Channel. Being independently administered jurisdictions, they do not form part of either the United Kingdom or the British Overseas Territories. They are self-governing possessions of the Crown (defined uniquely in each jurisdiction). Internationally, the dependencies are considered \\"territories for which the United Kingdom is responsible\\" rather than as sovereign states. As a result, they are not member states of the Commonwealth of Nations. However, they do have a relationship with the Commonwealth, the European Union, and other international organisations and are members of the BritishIrish Council. They are not part of the European Union (EU), although they are within the EU's customs area.  - Peacekeeping refers to activities intended to create conditions that favor lasting peace. Research generally finds that peacekeeping reduces civilian and battlefield deaths and reduces the risk of renewed warfare.  - The Royal Irish Constabulary (RIC, Irish: \\"Constáblacht Ríoga na hÉireann\\"; simply called the Irish Constabulary 183667) was the armed police force of the United Kingdom in Ireland from the early nineteenth century until 1922. A separate civic police force, the unarmed Dublin Metropolitan Police controlled the capital, and the cities of Derry and Belfast, originally with their own police forces, later had special divisions within the RIC. About seventy-five percent of the RIC were Roman Catholic and about twenty-five percent were of various Protestant denominations, the Catholics mainly constables and the Protestants officers. The RIC's successful system of policing influenced the armed Canadian North-West Mounted Police (predecessor of the Royal Canadian Mounted Police), the armed Victoria Police force in Australia, and the armed Royal Newfoundland Constabulary in Newfoundland. In consequence of the Anglo-Irish Treaty, the RIC was disbanded in 1922 and was replaced by the Garda Síochána in the Irish Free State and the Royal Ulster Constabulary in Northern Ireland.

Dimitri Zinovievich Tiomkin (May 10, 1894 - November 11, 1979) was a Russian-born American film composer and conductor. Classically trained in St. Petersburg, Russia before the Bolshevik Revolution, he moved to Berlin and then New York City after the Russian Revolution. In 1929, after the stock market crash, he moved to Hollywood, where he became best known for his scores for Western films, including Duel in the Sun, Red River, High Noon, The Big Sky, Gunfight at the O.K. Corral, and Last Train from Gun Hill. Tiomkin received twenty-two Academy Award nominations and won four Oscars, three for Best Original Score for High Noon, The High and the Mighty, and The Old Man and the Sea, and one for Best Original Song for \\"The Ballad of High Noon\\" from the former film. Following his work for Fred Zinnemann on The Men (1950), Tiomkin composed the score for the same director's High Noon (1952). His theme song was \\"Do Not Forsake Me, Oh My Darlin'\\" (\\"The Ballad of High Noon\\"). At its opening preview to the press, the film, which starred Gary Cooper and Grace Kelly, did badly. Tiomkin writes that \\"film experts agreed that the picture was a flat failure... The producers hesitated to release the picture.\\" Tiomkin bought the rights to the song and released it as a single for the popular music market, with singer Frankie Laine. The record became an immediate success worldwide. Based on the song's popularity, the studio released the film four months later, with the words sung by country western star Tex Ritter. The film received seven Academy Award nominations and won four awards, including two for Tiomkin: Best Original Music and Best Song. Walt Disney presented him with both awards that evening.  According to film historian Arthur R. Jarvis, Jr., the score \\"has been credited with saving the movie.\\" Another music expert, Mervyn Cooke, agrees, adding that \\"the song's spectacular success was partly responsible for changing the course of film-music history\\". Tiomkin was the second composer to receive two Oscars (score and song) for the same dramatic film. (The first was Leigh Harline, who won Best Original Score for Disney's Pinocchio and Best Song for \\"When You Wish Upon a Star\\". Ned Washington wrote its lyrics as he did for \\"Do Not Forsake Me, Oh My Darlin\\".)  The song's lyrics briefly tell High Noon's entire story arc, a tale of cowardice and conformity in a small Western town. Tiomkin composed his entire score around this single western-style ballad. He also eliminated violins from the ensemble. He added a subtle harmonica in the background, to give the film a \\"rustic, deglamorized sound that suits the anti-heroic sentiments\\" expressed by the story.  According to Russian film historian Harlow Robinson, building the score around a single folk tune was typical of many Russian classical composers. Robinson adds that the source of Tiomkin's score, if indeed folk, has not been proven. However, the Encyclopedia of Modern Jewish Culture, on page 124, states: \\"The fifty-year period in the USA between 1914, the start of the First World War and the year of Irving Berlin's first full score, Watch Your Step, and 1964, the premiere of Boek and Hamick's Fiddler on the Roof, is informed by a rich musical legacy from Yiddish folk tunes (for example Mark Warshavsky's \\"Di milners trem,\\" The miller's tears: and Dimitri Tiomkin's \\"Do Not Forsake Me.\\" High Noon)...\\" The composer worked again for Zinnemann on The Sundowners (1960).  Tiomkin won two more Oscars in subsequent years: for The High and the Mighty (1954), directed by William A. Wellman, and featuring John Wayne; and The Old Man and the Sea (1958), adapted from an Ernest Hemingway novel. During the 1955 ceremonies, Tiomkin thanked all of the earlier composers who had influenced him, including Beethoven, Tchaikovsky, Rimsky-Korsakov, and other names from the European classical tradition.

Title: The Iron Giant Movie plot: In 1957, a large alien robot crashes from orbit near the coast of Rockwell, Maine with no memory. Shortly after, the Iron Giant wanders off into the mainland. Nine-year-old Hogarth Hughes follows a trail of the forest's destruction and frees the robot, who is stuck in the power cables of an electrical substation. After being rescued by and befriended by Hogarth, the Giant follows him back to his house, where he lives with his widowed mother Annie. Upon their return, the Giant attempts to eat the rails off the ties of the nearby railroad tracks. Alarmed by the sound of an oncoming train, Hogarth tells the giant to repair the tracks. The Giant attempts this, but takes too long, causing the train to collide with his head. Hogarth hides the damaged robot in their barn where he discovers the robot is self repairing.Later that night, Hogarth returns to the barn with a stack of comic books to read to the Giant. The Giant is impressed with Superman, but distressed when he discovers a comic about an evil robot; Hogarth tells the Giant that he can be \\"who you choose to be\\". Investigating the destroyed substation, U.S. government agent Kent Mansley discovers evidence of the Giant and decides to continue his inquiries in nearby Rockwell. Finding a BB gun Hogarth left near the substation the night he found the Giant, Mansley takes up a room for rent at Hogarth's home and trails the boy to learn more. He is paranoid about an alien invasion and alerts the U.S. Army to the possible presence of the Giant. Worried that they will get caught, Hogarth evades Mansley and takes the Giant to beatnik artist Dean McCoppin, who passes off the robot as one of his works of scrap-metal art when Mansley and Lieutenant General Guy Rogard investigate. Once Mansley and Rogard are gone, Hogarth plays with the Giant using a toy gun, but inadvertently causes the Giant to activate a defence mechanism.

It's important to look at three possibilities: making plans, becoming isolated, and being unfriendly.  Firstly, making plans with a new friend can be exciting for Ash. This allows them to connect and bond outside of the work environment. By making plans, Ash will be able to explore common interests and participate in various activities that bring them closer to their newfound friend. This can lead to an increased circle of friends, stronger relationships and potentially better job satisfaction since they now have a good friend at work.  However, becoming isolated can happen in a situation where Ash might not be able to connect well with their new friend or may find that their interests or personalities do not align. In this case, it is possible for Ash to feel isolated and potentially struggle with their overall social and work life. This can lead to feelings of loneliness and affect their overall well-being. By recognizing these concerns, Ash should make an effort to further expand their social circle to avoid isolation or work on developing their communication skills to navigate social situations more effectively. Lastly, the possibility of being unfriendly arises when perhaps Ash's new friend exhibits undesirable behavior or actions. If this occurs, Ash may choose to be unfriendly or distance themselves from this new acquaintance, intending to minimize the negative impact on their life. In this situation, Ash would need to assess the pros and cons of maintaining this friendship and determine the best course of action for their well-being. It is essential to address the situation openly and honestly to avoid unnecessary misunderstandings or conflicts that might later escalate. In conclusion, Ash's first day at work and the new friendship they establish present various possibilities for their social and work life. Ash may choose to make plans and grow their friendship with their new colleague, face the potential feeling of isolation, or even opt to be unfriendly and distance themselves if needed. Ultimately, Ash should consider the implications of these different scenarios and make informed decisions that best suit their interests and well-being."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Dune city had very dry air and no rain, while Bay city had very high humidity, fog and lots of rain.  Which city had less damage to cars because of corrosion? Answer:","output":"Bay city likely had less damage to cars because of corrosion, even though it experienced higher humidity, fog, and rain compared to Dune city, which had very dry air and no rain. Corrosion is a natural process in which metal objects and structures, such as car body panels and engine components, are gradually destroyed as a result of interacting with their environment. This process usually involves the oxidation of metal materials in the presence of water and other dissolved chemicals, such as salts, acids, and alkalis. At first glance, one might think that Dune city, with its very dry air and no rain, would have less damage to cars due to corrosion compared to Bay city, which had high humidity and frequent rainfall. However, several factors contribute to explaining why Bay city may experience less corrosion-related damage to cars than Dune city. 1. Protective oxide layers: In highly humid environments, such as Bay city, a thin, protective oxide layer can form on the surface of metals, such as iron and aluminum. This layer acts as a barrier, preventing the underlying metal from further contact with the corrosive agents in the air. In Dune city's dry environment, this layer may not form as readily or be less stable, increasing the potential for corrosion. 2. Presence of salts: Dune city's dry environment may mean that salts, which are a significant catalyst for corrosion, may accumulate on the surfaces of cars. These salts might be deposited by wind-blown dust or be present on the roads as a result of human activity. In contrast, Bay city's frequent rainfall would help to wash away accumulated salts, reducing their potential to cause corrosion. 3. Accelerated corrosion in microclimates: Certain areas within Dune city, such as under bridges or along coastlines, may experience localized microclimates with higher humidity levels, which could lead to accelerated corrosion in these specific areas. In Bay city, the overall high humidity, fog, and rainfall create a more uniform environment that diminishes the potential for isolated microclimates with exceptionally high corrosion rates. 4. Different metal compositions: Cars in each city may contain different metal alloys with varying levels of resistance to corrosion. Suppose car manufacturers and owners in Bay city were aware of the higher general humidity and took precautions using more corrosion-resistant materials. In that case, cars in Bay city may be less prone to corrosion than those in Dune city. 5. Active corrosion control measures: It is possible that Bay city, with its high humidity, fog, and heavy rainfall, has implemented active corrosion control measures to protect its infrastructure and vehicles, such as regular vehicle inspections, cleaning, and application of protective coatings. These measures could lead to reduced corrosion-related damage in Bay city compared to Dune city. In conclusion, even though Bay city experiences a humid and rainy climate, it may still have less damage to cars due to corrosion. The formation of protective oxide layers, the presence of salts, accelerated corrosion in microclimates, the variable composition of metal alloys, and active corrosion control measures can all contribute to this counterintuitive outcome. However, it should be noted that other factors such as the overall air quality and pollution levels should also be considered when comparing the corrosion rates in the two cities."},{"instruction":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

The commandant of the Marine Corps at the time, General Charles C. Krulak, realized that the existing training model required improvements to enhance teamwork, leadership, and problem-solving skills in recruits. Under his guidance, the Marine Corps introduced the Crucible as a way to adapt the training methods to meet the evolving needs of the modern battlefield. The Crucible is a test of a recruit's mental, emotional, and physical fortitude while working together with fellow recruits to solve problems, overcome obstacles, and complete missions under stressful conditions. During these 54 hours, recruits are subjected to a series of grueling tasks, including lengthy marches carrying heavy loads, night navigation exercises, obstacle courses, squad-based missions, and team-building exercises. All the training is done on minimal food and sleep to push the recruits to their limits. Throughout the Crucible, recruits learn the importance of the Marine Corps' core values—honor, courage, and commitment—while solidifying bonds between fellow recruits who will go on to serve together as Marines. Upon successful completion of the event, recruits participate in a solemn ceremony during which they receive their Eagle, Globe, and Anchor emblem, symbolizing their transformation into United States Marines. The Crucible has since become an integral part of the Marine Corps' recruit training program, continually evolving to meet the various challenges Marines will face in the contemporary combat environment. Throughout the years, it has proven itself as a pivotal part of the journey of turning enlisted civilians into disciplined and combat-ready Marine warriors."},{"instruction":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

My Mom had a gift card for here from someone and didn't want it, so she said I could use it during my quick visit home.  Solid 4.5 star rating.  I've had a reflexology massage before.  No problem, thanks, Mom!  I'm pretty open-minded, but I could NOT get into this place.  It's all one big open room with like half walls separating massage areas.  A nice lady comes in to do her thing, and she was sweet and did an alright job.  But I couldn't chill cause you hear all the slapping from everyone else, people coming and going, side conversations... But okay fine, this is technically a free massage afterall, so, fine.  Then she covers my eyes, and continues to work.  And when the towel was removed from my eyes, a GUY had been massaging me!  I have no idea when they switched!  I don't care that a guy was doing it, but it was a shock to suddenly see a different face.    Then I'm told to lay face down.  Mr. Massager starts going off on me like I'm his punching bag.  I'm wondering what I ever did to this guy to deserve this beating.  But I tell myself, Okay maybe it's toxins leaving my system or whatever, maybe I should expect some discomfort, and I tough it out.  BUT THEN.  Homeboy gets a candy out of this dish that's sitting on this little table and proceeds to roll it around in his mouth and suck on it and slobber all over it for the remainder of my treatment.  SO GROSS.  And he's rubbing all deep and somehow manages to basically lay his junk all over my head while he's doing it.  I'm half laughing and half totally embarrassed and disgusted to even type that!  UGHGHHH!  There was zero communication, he pulls up my shirt and unhooks my BRA and I'm thinking, DID I YELP THE CORRECT PLACE???  (For the record, yes, I did yelp the correct place).  DO PEOPLE REALLY LIKE THIS??  IS THIS HOW IT'S DONE??  WHEN IS THIS GOING TO BE OVER??? WHO GAVE MY MOM THIS GIFTCARD ANYWAY???  WHAT AM I DOING HERE AND WHERE IS THE NEAREST EXIT?? Good thing I went in and my Mom didn't, she would have probably killed somebody.

Gleich eines Vorweg: die Rezension dieser Cd beruht nicht auf deren Inhalt, sondern (LEIDER!!!) auf der Abzockerie von Sony BMG (für ein vergleichendes Beispiel sei auf Oral Fixation von Shakira verwiesen).  Nur drei Monate nach Erscheinen der normalen Version bzw. der amazon Edition (die ich persönlich besitze) von \\"Das Optimale Leben\\" erscheint eine Tour Edition. Damit werden all diejenigen bestraft, die so dumm waren und sich die Cd gleich am Anfang gekauft haben und somit verantwortlich dafür, dass das Album (fast) an die Spitze der Charts schoss.  Für alle anderen, die entweder schlauer waren und gewartet haben (abzusehen war dies ja, auch bei \\"Unausgesprochen\\" kam ja eine weitere Version mit mehr Tracks, allerdings nicht mit so vielen wie hier) oder es sich leisten können nochmals zuzuschlagen, ist die Cd natürlich TOP.  Auf dem \\"Studioalbum\\" (siehe meine Rezension bez der amazon Edition) befinden sich vier weitere Tracks plus Videoclip und daneben gibt es eine zweite Cd mit stolzen 34 Live Tracks; dass Annett auch live eine absolute Sensation ist, habe ich schon einmal erleben dürfen, im Februar folgt das zweite Mal.

Please tell me if those questions are the same.","output":"No, the questions are not the same, but they are related. The first question is about getting your photography exhibited in a gallery, while the second question is about organizing your own photography gallery. I will provide detailed answers for both questions. 1. How can I get my photography in a gallery? To get your photography exhibited in a gallery, follow these steps: a. Build a strong portfolio: Before you approach galleries, you need to ensure that you have a well-curated body of work representing your style and artistic vision. A strong portfolio is essential, as it showcases your talent and serves as your introduction to gallery owners and curators. b. Research potential galleries: Start by researching galleries whose focus aligns with your style and genre of photography. Look for galleries that have previously exhibited work similar to yours. Make a list of the most suitable galleries, visit their websites, and study their submission guidelines. c. Network with industry professionals: Attend photography exhibitions, conferences, and workshops to expand your network and connect with gallery curators, owners, fellow photographers, and industry professionals. Networking is vital, as it can be instrumental in getting your work noticed and presented with exhibiting opportunities. d. Make a professional submission: Follow the submission guidelines of the selected galleries and create a professional submission package. This should include:   - A well-written cover letter, which introduces yourself and your work, shares your motivation for wanting to exhibit in the particular gallery, and explains why your work would be a good fit for that gallery.   - Your portfolio or a selection of your best works (either printed or digital), showcasing your technique, style, and artistic vision.   - An artist statement that provides context and insight into your work, themes, and inspirations.   - Your updated curriculum vitae or resume, which highlights your education, career path, previous exhibitions, and awards or recognitions. e. Be patient and persistent: Getting your work accepted by a gallery may take time, so be prepared for rejection and maintain a positive attitude. Keep applying to multiple galleries, building your network, and improving your photography skills. You can also consider alternative exhibition spaces such as coffee shops, hotels, and local businesses to gain additional exposure. 2. What is the best way to get my photography gallery organized? To organize your own photography gallery, follow these steps: a. Define your gallery's focus: Determine what specific theme, subject matter, or style you want to showcase in your gallery. This will help you to create a cohesive and well-curated exhibition. b. Sort your photographs: Collect and sort your photographs into categories based on the focus of your gallery. Choose only the best high-quality images that represent your artistic style and vision.  c. Select the right method for organizing: Depending on the number of photographs and the purpose of your gallery, decide upon the most effective method of organization. Methods could include chronologically, thematically, or by color, among others. d. Create a layout and flow: Plan the layout of your gallery and the arrangement of your photographs. Consider factors such as the size of the prints, the available wall or display space, and the overall visual impact. Balance the negative space (the empty space between the photographs) to create a smooth visual flow and encourage viewers to explore the gallery comfortably. e. Frame and print: Choose appropriate framing methods and materials for your photographs that will highlight your work and complement your chosen theme. Ensure that your prints are of high quality and a consistent standard. f. Labels and descriptions: Write clear and concise labels for each photograph, including the title, your name, and any relevant technical or contextual information. If desired, provide a brief description or an artist statement to give the viewer a better understanding of your intentions and inspirations. g. Create a digital gallery: If you would like to create an online gallery, select a suitable platform or website builder and follow the same organization principles outlined above. Optimize your images for the web and ensure that your website design is visually appealing and easy to navigate. h. Promote your gallery: Utilize social media, networking events, and other marketing channels to direct viewers and potential buyers to your gallery. Share information about your gallery, your artist's journey, and insights into your work to create engagement and interest. Finally, remember that organizing a gallery can be a learning experience. Review its success, noting what works well and where improvements can be made for future exhibitions."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant. User will you give you a task.

Question: What is the last name of the person whose departure from the band caused another band member to leave?  Answer the above question based on the context below:  Opeth recorded its debut album, Orchid, with producer Dan Swanö in April 1994. Because of distribution problems with the newly formed Candlelight Records, the album was not released until May 15, 1995, and only in Europe. Orchid tested the boundaries of traditional death metal, featuring acoustic guitars, piano, and clean vocals.After a few live shows in the United Kingdom, Opeth returned to the studio in March 1996 to begin work on a second album, again produced by Dan Swanö. The album was named Morningrise, and was released in Europe on June 24, 1996. With only five songs, but lasting 66 minutes, it features Opeth's longest song, the twenty-minute \\"Black Rose Immortal\\". Opeth toured the UK in support of Morningrise, followed by a 26-date Scandinavian tour with Cradle of Filth. While on tour, Opeth attracted the attention of Century Media Records, who signed the band and released the first two albums in the United States in 1997.In 1997, after the tour, Åkerfeldt and Lindgren dismissed De Farfalla for personal reasons, without the consent of Nordin. When Åkerfeldt informed Nordin, who was on a vacation in Brazil, Nordin left the band and remained in Brazil for personal reasons. Former Eternal members, drummer Martín López (formerly of Amon Amarth) and bassist Martín Méndez, responded to an ad at a music shop placed by Åkerfeldt. López and Méndez were fans of the band and took the ads down themselves so no other musicians could apply for the job. Åkerfeldt and Lindgren did not want the Martíns to join at first, due to them already knowing each other; they felt that they wanted two strangers so that there wouldn't be two camps in the band, but eventually hired both. López made his debut with Opeth playing on a cover version of Iron Maiden's \\"Remember Tomorrow\\", which was included on the album A Call to Irons: A Tribute to Iron Maiden.With a larger recording budget from Century Media, Opeth began work on its third album, with noted Swedish producer Fredrik Nordström, at Studio Fredman in August 1997.

Born on November 8, 1954, in Chicago, Illinois, Jones started her music career in the late 1970s, blending a variety of styles such as R&B, jazz, pop, and rock to create a unique sound. \\"Chuck E.'s in Love\\" was released in April 1979 as the lead single from her self-titled debut studio album, \\"Rickie Lee Jones,\\" which came out on Warner Bros. Records. The song quickly gained widespread recognition and became a commercial success, peaking at No. 4 on the Billboard Hot 100 chart in the United States during the summer of 1979. It also reached No. 15 in Canada and No. 49 in Australia, thus establishing Jones' place in the music industry. The song's inspiration comes from Chuck E. Weiss, a musician, and songwriter who was part of the Los Angeles music scene during that time. The title character, Chuck E., was a friend of both Jones and well-known musician Tom Waits.

OPTIONS: (i) they sincerely believe everything they say (ii) not enough information (iii) they will align with Antifa (iv) they are racist Given those answer options, answer the question: WASHINGTON — They called themselves \\"crusaders\\" for a reason. The three Kansas militiamen planned to blow up an apartment complex housing Somali refugees during the 2016 presidential election, unleashing what one of them called \\"Crusades 2.0.\\" But their plan was foiled after their arrest just weeks before the election, highlighting the changing enemy list of a movement founded on the back of anti-government activism a generation ago. And with the election of a president whose policies many militia members support, the urge to confront the government appears to have lost some of its urgency. Instead of railing at the government, they have in recent years turned their venom against new-found foes: Muslims, immigrants, the Antifa. \\"Some of the militia groups have been refocusing their attention on secondary enemies for the movement,\\" said Mark Pitcavage, who researches extremism at the Anti-Defamation League civil rights group. Often lumped together with other right-wing groups, the anti-government movement comes in different forms. There are the \\"preppers,\\" so called because they stockpile water, food and other essentials in preparation for civil unrest. There are the \\"survivalists,\\" people who learn skills to “live off the land” in case of a disaster. There are “sovereign citizens” such as the suspect in the recent shooting at a Waffle House in Tennessee who are opposed to paying taxes and believe they should decide which laws to follow. And then there are the militiamen who conduct regular military-style training to resist a government they see as engaged in a global plot to take away their guns and constitutional rights. The modern militia movement dates back to a series of events in the early 1990s, according to the Southern Poverty Law Center. Among them: the 1992 election of Democratic President Bill Clinton and an FBI attack the following year on the Branch Davidian compound in Waco, Texas, an event seen as \\"evidence of an out of control government willing to attack citizens.\\" Under Clinton, the number... Question: what is probably true about anti-government groups? === The answer to the above question is A:","output":"(i) they sincerely believe everything they say  Justification: The entire passage talks about different factions of anti-government movements and their underlying beliefs - whether it be stockpiling goods in preparation for civil unrest, or resisting government policies as part of a perceived global plot to infringe upon their rights. These groups engage in serious actions based upon their beliefs, such as the Kansas militiamen's foiled plot or the regular military-style training conducted by some. Given this evidence, it would be fair to infer that these anti-government groups sincerely believe in what they say. There is no information given directly aligning these groups with Antifa, and attaching the label \\"racist\\" is an oversimplification and may not apply to all anti-government groups. Therefore, it makes sense to disregard these answer options (iii) and (iv). As for option (ii), while there may always be aspects not covered in the information provided, the passage provides a substantial amount of evidence to make an informed judgment as per option (i).

Write highlights for this article: A Cornell study has discovered an uncomfortable truth about children's cereal and it's not their sky-high sugar content: it's the hypnotic eyes of their cartoon mascots. While the people on adult cereals look straight ahead, the researchers noticed that cartoon tigers, frogs, Cap'ns and the like tend to stare downward. That allows them to gaze right into the eyes of their intended consumer, your kids--a finding that makes sense since they also discovered that eye contact increase brand trust by 16 percent. Scroll down for video... Here's looking at you! Cornell researchers have discovered that kids' cereal cartoon characters stare down at children at an average angle of 9.67 degrees. Cornell Food and Brand Lab Researchers Aner Tal and Brian Wansink evaluated 85 different characters at 10 grocery stores in New York and Connecticut for their project dubbed Cereal Box Psychology. Grocers have long been known to place the kids stuff on lower shelves. But even those shelves can be above many kids' heads. To make up for that, the researchers found that characters like Cap'n Crunch, Tony the Tiger, Luck the Leprechaun and company look downward at an average angle of 9.67 degrees. Meanwhile, cereal for adults--Which is placed an average of 48 inches off the ground versus the children's 23 inches--tends to feature people looking straight ahead. 'Why is Cap'n Crunch looking down at my child?': The Cereal Box Psychology study came from the Cornell University Food and Brand Lab and looked at 85 characters on cereal boxes in 10 stores in New York and Connecticut. Friends: Meanwhile, the study found that people on adult cereal boxes tend to stare directly ahead, presumably into the eyes of their intended consumers, since the adult cereals are placed higher up. Coming back for more: The researchers also found that eye contact from characters increases 'brand trust' by 16 percent. The reason for those googly eyes is more than simply aesthetic. The researchers showed one version of the Trix rabbit that made eye contact and one that did not to to 63 college students. They found 'that brand trust was 16 percent higher and the feeling of connection to the brand was 10 percent higher when the rabbit made eye contact.' 'If you are a cereal company looking to market healthy cereals to kids, use spokes-characters that make eye contact with children to create brand loyalty,\\"' Wansink said. And what of sugar conscious parents who can't bear the thought of their children being hypnotized into eating these tempting products? 'If you are a parent who does not want your kids to go \\"cuckoo for Cocoa Puffs,\\"' he said, 'avoid taking them down the cereal aisle.' Highlights:","output":"1.

In fact, washing your hair every other day will keep it healthier, since it won't get as dry and prone to breakage. If you have oily skin and hair, you may need to wash your hair every day so it doesn't get greasy. A moisturizing conditioner will help make your thick hair smoother and more manageable. Look for conditioners that say “moisturizing” or “deep conditioning” on the bottle. Condition your hair in the shower right after you shampoo it. Clarifying shampoos are stronger and more deep-cleaning than regular shampoos, and they’re great at washing out hair products that build up on hair, like waxes, creams, and hairsprays. Since thick hair is more prone to buildup, washing your hair with a clarifying shampoo once a week will keep your thick hair soft and clean.  Clarifying shampoos can be harsh on hair, so don’t use one more than once a week. Minimize dryness by using a moisturizing conditioner after you wash with a clarifying shampoo. Part of the challenge of styling thick hair is how much volume it has. That's why air drying is a good idea when you have thick hair — it prevents excess volume. Avoid using a blow dryer or towel to dry your hair or you'll make it more voluminous. Summary:","output":"To maintain healthy thick hair, follow these steps: 1. Wash your hair every other day or as required based on the oiliness of your skin and hair. This prevents it from drying out and becoming prone to breakage. 2. Use a moisturizing or deep conditioning hair conditioner to make your hair more manageable. 3. Apply conditioner after shampooing your hair in the shower. 4. Use a clarifying shampoo once a week to remove any buildup from hair products, as thick hair is more prone to this issue. 5. Limit the use of clarifying shampoos to once a week and use a moisturizing conditioner afterward to minimize dryness. 6.

What is the answer: Published in 2013, Saints of the Shadow Bible is the latest novel to feature which detective?","output":"Saints of the Shadow Bible, published in 2013, is the nineteenth novel in the highly acclaimed series featuring Detective Inspector John Rebus, a character created by Scottish crime writer Ian Rankin. John Rebus is an enigmatic and talented police officer working in Edinburgh, Scotland. The Rebus series, which started with the novel Knots & Crosses in 1987, has garnered a significant following over the years and has earned Rankin various prestigious crime fiction awards.  In Saints of the Shadow Bible, Rebus has returned to the force but is demoted to Detective Sergeant due to a change in the aging regulations. The story revolves around two separate but eventually intertwining cases. One case involves a suspicious car accident with a Scottish Member of Parliament at the center, while the other concerns an investigation from the 1980s that involves a potentially corrupt group of detectives known as the \\"Saints.\\" These Saints, who still maintain a strong bond and conduct secret gatherings, concocted their own version of justice and may have committed illegal acts in the process. Rebus is torn between his loyalties to his former mentors, the Saints, and his sense of morality. He has a deep-rooted desire to uncover the truth and, at the same time, must also confront his past actions. Throughout the book, Rebus works alongside his former partner, Detective Inspector Siobhan Clarke, and the ambitious Malcolm Fox from the Complaints department, who seeks to prosecute the Saints and expose their criminal behavior. The novel examines themes of morality, loyalty, and the complexity of human relationships. It also presents readers with a detailed and nuanced portrayal of its setting, Edinburgh, with all its historic charm, contemporary struggles, and political significance being prominently displayed. Saints of the Shadow Bible is a captivating and well-crafted mystery novel, illustrating the depth, intelligence, and human touch that has made Ian Rankin's John Rebus one of modern crime fiction's most iconic and enduring detectives."},{"instruction":"Question: Yes. 20 years ago. When I was a lot younger. I was victimised by a gang of bent police men, who arrested me and set me up to get charged with something that I did not do which I believe was connected to other criminals who live in my area, who I believe were connected to a gang of DJ’s who were involved stealing intellectual and copyright works from me (likely their party organisers and drug dealer buddies). I was sent to court and found guilty based on no evidence by a magistrate court judge who was later struck off for corruption after defrauding an old lady of over a million pounds! I was not put in prison for this minor offense but did receive a minor criminal record. This criminal records the same DJ’s and bent ex-police have used to ruin my reputation and career. One of the bent policemen, who incidentally had already been thrown out of the police force for car insurance fraud, even turned up at the uni I went to and spread vicious slander to ruin me there, and in the area that I lived at the time. I was then victimised by the people at the famous college that I went to and all my intellectual and copyright works stolen. Which I note, generated millions for others. Once they made their money and gained credibility on the back of my hard work, innovation and some may say genius, the thieves then did all they could to ruin my reputation in the entertainment industry and in the area that I live.

The words \\"embrace\\" and \\"sweet\\" indicate a positive viewpoint. However, it's quite challenging to provide a comprehensive analysis based solely on a brief phrase. Critiques usually provide more specific details, focusing on aspects like storytelling, character development, cinematography, the performances of the actors, the director's approach, and so forth. In the context of this short phrase, \\"to embrace small, sweet \`evelyn\`,\\" \\"embrace\\" suggests that the audience or the critic themselves is encouraged to accept or appreciate the film, indicating a positive response. The word suggests a welcoming, appreciative interaction with the movie. \\"Small\\" could be hinting at the film's likely indie stature or possibly the intimate and contained scope of its storyline, which isn't a negative remark. Numerous 'small' movies are often praised for their intricate storytelling, characterized performances, and directorial ingenuity, concentrated within limited settings or focused narratives. The term \\"sweet\\" suggests that there might be some heartwarming or touching elements in the film, perhaps in its storytelling, characters, or overall theme. This implies that the film possibly brought forth some tender, delightful, or relatable moments which appealed to the reviewer, another mark in favor of the film. The title \\"Evelyn\\" doesn't provide much to go by without further context. Still, it's wrapped in backticks, possibly emphasizing the film title - another part of the critic's positive impression of the movie.

The statement in Romanian discusses the significance of supporting an interim agreement, emphasizing its potential positive impact on the security of European citizens. By backing this temporary arrangement, the stakeholders involved could potentially facilitate a more stable and secure environment for individuals within the European region. This support may also pave the way for future negotiations and agreements that would further strengthen the overall safety and well-being of European citizens. The keywords in this statement are \\"interim agreement\\" and \\"security of European citizens.\\" When discussing policymaking and international relations, an interim agreement serves as a provisional arrangement that is implemented until either a more comprehensive or definitive agreement is reached or the situation evolves. The purpose of such an agreement, in most cases, is to find middle ground or provide essential obligations and assurances for the parties involved in a transaction, negotiation, or conflict. Interim agreements can be beneficial for several reasons. First, they are often more manageable than comprehensive agreements because they focus on a smaller range of issues. This makes them more accessible to negotiation and more likely to result in measurable progress within a quicker timeframe. Second, interim agreements can serve as a building block, laying the foundation for further cooperation and dialogue. By establishing a base level of trust and providing a framework for future discussions, interim agreements can promote sustained engagement between parties. Regarding the security aspect, the statement suggests that the interim agreement in question could have a positive effect on the safety and well-being of European citizens. This could be accomplished in various ways, such as enhancing regional cooperation and coordination on security matters; addressing transnational threats, such as terrorism, organized crime, and cybercrime; or fostering a more stable and peaceful geopolitical landscape. Ultimately, the rationale behind this statement is the belief that, by supporting a specific interim agreement, European citizens will enjoy a more secure and prosperous living environment. In summary, the translated statement draws attention to the importance of supporting an interim agreement and its potential benefits for the security of European citizens. By endorsing such a treaty, stakeholders can pave the way toward a safer and more stable region and build a foundation for continued dialogue and collaboration on security matters."},{"instruction":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

Founded in 2000 by vocalist Tim Lambesis, the establishment of the band's first full lineup, which included drummer Jordan Mancino, occurred in 2001. As I Lay Dying has released six albums, one split album, and two compilation albums. As I Lay Dying's fourth studio album An Ocean On January 25, 2012, an announcement revealed that the band would be playing the Mayhem Festival of 2012 with Slipknot, Slayer, Motorhead, Anthrax, The Devil Wears Prada, Asking Alexandria, Whitechapel, Upon A Burning Body, I, the Breather, Betraying the Martyrs, and Dirtfedd. The band announced in April 2012 that Bill Stevenson, who had previously worked with NOFX and Rise Against, would be the producer for their sixth album.  On June 22, 2012, the band announced that their sixth album would be titled Awakened and the first single \\"Cauterize\\" was released on June 25, 2012. On September 12, 2012, As I Lay Dying released their second single \\"A Greater Foundation\\" with a corresponding music video. The album was released on September 25, 2012 and \\"Cauterize\\" was available on the band's website as a free download for a 24-hour period. As I Lay Dying won the \\"Metal Band of the Year\\" award from Loudwire in 2012, beating other well-known bands, including Anthrax and Lamb of God. Subsequently, prior to his criminal charges, Lambesis started a new band entitled Pyrithion with guitarist Ryan Glisan, formerly of Allegaeon. They released one EP as a band.  On May 7, 2013, Lambesis was arrested in Oceanside, California, US after allegedly hiring an undercover detective to kill his estranged wife. The report was made by the San Diego County Sheriff's Department, leaving the future of the band uncertain. On the following day, the band released a statement in which they said: \\"The legal process is taking its course and we have no more information than you do. There are many unanswered questions, and the situation will become clearer in the coming days and weeks. We'll keep you informed as best we can.\\" They also stated that their thoughts were \\"with Tim, his family, and with everyone else affected by this terrible situation.\\" Eight days later, the band cancelled their mid-2013 tour with Killswitch Engage, stating that \\"we feel that it is best for the band to be off the road while the current situation gets sorted\\". During the month of his initial arrest, Lambesis pleaded \\"not guilty\\" and his lawyer stated: \\"His thought processes were devastatingly affected by his steroid use.\\" On February 25, 2014 Lambesis changed his plea from \\"not guilty\\" to \\"guilty\\" and consequently faced a potential sentence of nine years in prison.  Rather than continue on without Lambesis, Mancino, along with former members Phil Sgrosso, Nick Hipa, and Josh Gilbert, decided to focus on a different style of music under a different band name, Wovenwar, with Shane Blay as the vocalist, This project took shape long before Lambesis' plea. although Mancino still remains a member of As I Lay Dying. During this period of time Lambesis was also working on music and found time to release the third full length from Austrian Death Machine called Triple Brutal.  On May 16, 2014, Lambesis was sentenced to six years in prison, with 48 days credit for time served. what was the result?","output":"In 2012, the band As I Lay Dying released their sixth album called \\"Awakened\\" and they won the \\"Metal Band of the Year\\" award from Loudwire.

All I know is that if  Aziz Ansari  didn't want  his  sexual misconduct to become a national news story   he  could have left  his  apartment as soon as things got creepy. It's not like she was blocking the door. Poorna Jagannathan: While Harvey set off outrage   Aziz  has set off thought First of all  thank you  \\"Grace\\" and  Aziz . So far  most of the conversation on sexual violence has been along a strong binary: a clear victim-predator setup. And no doubt  the predator is egregiously wrong. It's dangerous to rely on non-verbal cues or mind reading to tell a guy you're OK with oral sex (giving and receiving) and making out on the couch but you do not want to go all the way  as did the woman who called herself \\"Grace\\" in the Babe.net story about her date with  Ansari . Speaking up is difficult but there is no better time than this #MeToo moment for women to find their voices  not just to expose real predators who sexually harass and assault women  but overly zealous men  as the Babe article portrays  Ansari  to be  who may think \\"yes\\" to a date at  his  place automatically means \\"yes\\" to sex.  Ansari  released a statement saying that the sexual encounter \\"by all indications was completely consensual\\" and that  he  was \\"surprised and concerned\\" when  he  heard that \\"it wasn't the case.\\" A guy once told me: \\"This is our second date. The third date means we're having sex. That's the rule.\\" I was shocked but at least  he  was honest. So was I: \\"There won't be a third date. It's been fun \\" I responded. We laughed and remain friends today. No playing coy  no mind reading. No games. When it comes to dating  both people equally are accountable for setting the tone. My friends and I have rules: 1) Public place for the first date  feel  him  out. 2) If and when you do go to  his  place  or yours  set up a \\"rescue call or text\\" later that night. This gives you an excuse to leave quickly  if needed. I use a code word if I'm in trouble and need help. 3) And  of course  if things get totally out of control  try to stay calm  speed-dial 911  then fight like hell to get away. The  Aziz Ansari  story is a good litmus test for who sees sexual misconduct as a strictly legal question and who is concerned about improving the overall culture surrounding sex and dating.

Answer by taking a quote from the following article: Aaron Benjamin Sorkin (born June 9, 1961) is an American screenwriter, director, producer, and playwright. His works include the Broadway plays A Few Good Men and The Farnsworth Invention; the television series Sports Night, The West Wing, Studio 60 on the Sunset Strip, and The Newsroom; and the films A Few Good Men, The American President, Charlie Wilson's War, Moneyball, and Steve Jobs. For writing The Social Network, he won the Oscar for Best Adapted Screenplay, among other awards. He made his feature directorial debut in 2017 with Molly's Game, which he also wrote. Sorkin was born in Manhattan, New York City, to a Jewish family, and was raised in the New York suburb of Scarsdale. His mother was a schoolteacher and his father a copyright lawyer who had fought in WWII and put himself through college on the G.I. Bill; both his older sister and brother went on to become lawyers. His paternal grandfather was one of the founders of the International Ladies' Garment Workers' Union (ILGWU). Sorkin took an early interest in acting. Before he reached his teenage years, his parents were taking him to the theatre to see shows such as Who's Afraid of Virginia Woolf? and That Championship Season.  Sorkin attended Scarsdale High School where he became involved in the drama and theatre club. In eighth grade he played General Bullmoose in the musical Li'l Abner. At Scarsdale High, he served as vice president of the drama club in his junior and senior years and graduated in 1979.  In 1979, Sorkin attended Syracuse University. In his freshman year he failed a class that was a core requirement. It was a devastating setback because he wanted to be an actor, and the drama department did not allow students to take the stage until they completed all the core freshman classes. Determined to do better, he returned in his sophomore year, and graduated in 1983. Recalling the influence on him at college of drama teacher Arthur Storch, Sorkin recalled, after Storch's death in March 2013, that \\"Arthur's reputation as a director, and as a disciple of Lee Strasberg, was a big reason why a lot of us went to S.U. ... 'You have the capacity to be so much better than you are', he started saying to me in September of my senior year. He was still saying it in May. On the last day of classes, he said it again, and I said, 'How?', and he answered, 'Dare to fail'. I've been coming through on his admonition ever since\\". Are there any other interesting aspects about this article?","output":"One interesting aspect from the article is a quote from Aaron Sorkin about the influence of his drama teacher, Arthur Storch, on him during college: \\"'You have the capacity to be so much better than you are', he started saying to me in September of my senior year.

Given the below context:  \\"One of Us Must Know (Sooner or Later)\\"When Dylan arrived at the studio on January 25, 1966, he had yet to work out the lyrics and title for what was to become the closing track on Blonde on Blonde's first side. With Dylan piecing together the song's sections, and the chorus that gives the song its title only emerging on take five, the session stretched through the night and into the next morning. It was not until the fifteenth take that a full version was recorded. Dylan and the band persisted until they recorded take 24 which closed the session and made it onto the album four months later. Critic Jonathan Singer credits Griffin's piano for binding the song together: \\"At the chorus, Griffin unleashes a symphony; hammering his way up and down the keyboard, half Gershwin, half gospel, all heart. The follow-up, a killer left hand figure that links the chorus to the verse, releases none of the song's tension.\\"\\"One of Us Must Know\\" is a straightforward account of a burned-out relationship. Dissecting what went wrong, the narrator takes a defensive attitude in a one-sided conversation with his former lover. As he presents his case in the opening verse, it appears he is incapable of either acknowledging his part or limiting the abuse: \\"I didn't mean to treat you so bad. You don't have to take it so personal. I didn't mean to make you so sad. You just happened to be there, that's all.\\" \\"One of Us Must Know\\" was the first recording completed for Blonde on Blonde and the only one selected from the New York sessions.

Bin Laden reportedly discussed the planes operation with KSM and Atef in a series of meetings in the spring of 1999 at the al Matar complex near Kandahar. KSM's original concept of using one of the hijacked planes to make a media statement was scrapped, but  Bin Laden considered the basic idea feasible.  Bin Laden, Atef, and KSM developed an initial list of targets. These included the White House, the U.S. Capitol, the Pentagon, and the World Trade Center. According to KSM,  Bin Laden wanted to destroy the White House and the Pentagon, KSM wanted to strike the World Trade Center, and all of them wanted to hit the Capitol. No one else was involved in the initial selection of targets.  Bin Laden also soon selected four individuals to serve as suicide operatives: Khalid al Mihdhar, Nawaf al Hazmi, Khallad, and Abu Bara al Yemeni. During the al Matar meetings,  Bin Laden told KSM that Mihdhar and Hazmi were so eager to participate in an operation against the United States that they had already obtained U.S. visas. KSM states that they had done so on their own after the suicide of their friend Azzam (Nashiri's cousin) in carrying out the Nairobi bombing. KSM had not met them. His only guidance from  Bin Laden was that the two should eventually go to the United States for pilot training. Hazmi and Mihdhar were Saudi nationals, born in Mecca. Like the others in this initial group of selectees, they were already experienced mujahideen. They had traveled together to fight in Bosnia in a group that journeyed to the Balkans in 1995. By the time Hazmi and Mihdhar were assigned to the planes operation in early 1999, they had visited Afghanistan on several occasions. Khallad was another veteran mujahid, like much of his family. His father had been expelled from Yemen because of his extremist views. Khallad had grown up in Saudi Arabia, where his father knew  Bin Laden, Abdullah Azzam, and Omar Abdel Rahman (the \\"Blind Sheikh\\").  Question: \\"Whose father was expelled from Yemen for having extremist views?\\" Answer: \\"Khalid al Mihdhar\\" Is this answer correct?","output":"No, the answer is incorrect.

Aunt Rosie has been feeling dizzy lately so she went to the doctor, where she found out she had hypertension. She was very scared. Aunt Angela was a different temperament she was hypotensive.  Which aunt did not have a disease called the \\"silent killer\\"? The answer is:","output":"Aunt Angela did not have the disease called the \\"silent killer.\\" To better understand the answer, let us break down the information given and provide an in-depth analysis. The question presents us with two individuals, Lena's aunts – Rosie and Angela. Aunt Rosie has been experiencing dizziness lately, which led her to consult a doctor. It was discovered that she has hypertension, also known as high blood pressure. Hypertension is referred to as the \\"silent killer\\" since it often shows no symptoms and can lead to severe health issues if left untreated. People with hypertension have an increased risk of heart disease, stroke, and other serious problems. In the case of Aunt Angela, she has a different temperament and is hypotensive – meaning she has low blood pressure. Hypotension is not popularly known as the \\"silent killer,\\" and it typically poses less risk than hypertension. In some cases, low blood pressure can be harmless or even a sign of good health. However, it's crucial to remember that extremely low blood pressure (called acute hypotension) can still lead to health problems, including dizziness, fainting, and inadequate blood flow to vital organs. It's worth noting that both hypertension and hypotension can be related to various factors, including genetics, lifestyle choices, medications, and underlying health conditions. Regular blood pressure monitoring, maintaining a balanced diet, engaging in physical activity, and managing stress can contribute to better overall heart health. In conclusion, Aunt Angela is the one who does not have the disease called the \\"silent killer.\\" While Aunt Rosie's hypertension puts her at risk for severe health problems if not managed and treated appropriately, Aunt Angela's hypotension is less dangerous and not typically referred to as a silent killer."},{"instruction":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

By the end of the month, you’ll have one thankful pumpkin on display to kick off the holidays! You’ll also have a family that realizes they have much to be thankful for! I thought of this idea one year when I was visiting family. I was trying to think of a way to use a little pumpkin that my niece and nephew had for decoration. So we sat around the table and tried to list everything we were thankful for. As they contributed, I wrote keywords with a marker all over the pumpkin. Even when we were done with our brainstorming activity, they would think of things to add to our thankful pumpkin. It’s a simple yet meaningful activity that encourages children (and adults) to find things they are grateful for in their lives. When you’re not writing on it, place the pumpkin in a spot where everyone can see it every day. It serves as a reminder, not only for all the good things in life, but also to continue the challenge with quality family discussions. If you made these decorative pumpkins, and don’t want to save them, you could paint them a neutral color and write or paint all over them too. We’re going to use a regular picked-from-the-patch pumpkin in our house. The following document gives brief instructions for this activity.

What is this text about?","output":"This text is about the passing of a prominent figure who, for four decades, has been a symbol of the Palestinian struggle for acknowledgement and fulfillment of their national rights. It highlights the individual's unwavering bravery and dedication to the Palestinian cause and their substantial impact on the fight for recognition of their people's rights. The text does not name the specific person; however, the 40-year span suggests a leader who has contributed significantly to the Palestinian struggle for justice, self-determination, and statehood. This could potentially refer to someone like Yasser Arafat, who was Chairman of the Palestine Liberation Organization (PLO) and the first President of the Palestinian National Authority. Arafat was known for his persistence in advocating for Palestinian rights and statehood throughout his political career. The statement emphasizes how this individual's passing marks the end of an era for the Palestinian movement, leaving a void in leadership and a sense of uncertainty about the future. It suggests that this person was a driving force behind the continuous efforts to attain recognition for the Palestinian nation and its rights, embodying the spirit of determination and resistance that has characterized the struggle for decades. The text may be from a political or historic commentary or an obituary, reflecting upon the contributions of the individual in question and acknowledging the depth of the impact they had on the Palestinian cause. In doing so, it also raises questions about the future path of the movement now that this key figure has passed away – whether a new leader will emerge to carry the mantle or if the dynamics of the fight for Palestinian rights will change in their absence. In conclusion, the text highlights the importance of a distinguished leader who has passionately advocated for Palestinian national rights over an extended period of forty years. With the person's disappearance, the Palestinian cause faces an uncertain future, as it loses a significant source of courage and conviction that has long embodied its struggle. The passage thus implores readers to consider both the leadership vacuum left behind and potential ramifications for the ongoing battle for Palestinian recognition and national rights."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Despite this \\"stumbling block\\", Bright said that Windows 8's interface worked well in some places, but began to feel incoherent when switching between the \\"Metro\\" and desktop environments, sometimes through inconsistent means. Tom Warren of The Verge wrote that the new interface was \\"as stunning as it is surprising\\", contributing to an \\"incredibly personal\\" experience once it is customized by the user, but had a steep learning curve, and was awkward to use with a keyboard and mouse. He noted that while forcing all users to use the new touch-oriented interface was a risky move for Microsoft as a whole, it was necessary in order to push development of apps for the Windows Store. Others, such as Adrian Kingsley-Hughes from ZDNet, considered the interface to be \\"clumsy and impractical\\" due to its inconsistent design (going as far as considering it \\"two operating systems unceremoniously bolted together\\"), and concluded that \\"Windows 8 wasn't born out of a need or demand; it was born out of a desire on Microsoft's part to exert its will on the PC industry and decide to shape it in a direction—touch and tablets -- that allows it to compete against, and remain relevant in the face of Apple's iPad.\\"\\",  answer the following question.

After becoming disabled in a machete attack on a visit to his native Haiti, Jean-Claude Joseph needed help persuading his landlord to move him from a fifth-floor apartment to one on the ground floor. Isaac Benjamin became ensnared in a bureaucratic snafu that took away his Social Security disability payments for more than two years. The story of Martha, a woman from Sierra Leone, was more compelling. Beaten, raped and tortured in her politically repressive homeland, she knowingly used someone else's passport to escape to America, but was caught by immigration authorities upon her arrival. She desperately sought political asylum.

Having lost the use of his left arm in warding off the machete attack during a robbery attempt, Joseph said he found it increasingly difficult to negotiate the five flights of stairs lugging groceries or laundry on the frequent occasions when the building's elevator was out of order. \\"With this, it became impossible for me to stay upstairs,\\" he said, pointing to the scars on his forearm. \\"If I cannot carry my groceries or my laundry, how can I live?\\" \\"It was a compelling case,\\" said Legal Services attorney Stephen St. Hilaire. \\"The key for us -- and we have to make tough decisions all the time on whether to take a case -- was visualizing what he had to do to get to the fifth floor, struggling with a bag of groceries,\\" he said.

Help as much as you can. Q: For the given English description, write an SQL command such that it accomplishes every step. An SQL query works by selecting data from a table where certain conditions apply. A table contains columns where every row in that table must have a value for each column. Every table has a primary key that uniquely identifies each row, usually an id. To choose which columns are returned you specify that after the \\"SELECT\\" statement. Next, you use a \\"FROM\\" statement to specify what tables you want to select the data from. When you specify a table you can rename it with the \\"AS\\" statement. You can reference that table by whatever name follows the \\"AS\\" statement. If you want to select data from multiple tables you need to use the \\"JOIN\\" statement. This will join the tables together by pairing a row in one table with every row in the other table (Cartesian Product). To limit the number of rows returned you should use the \\"ON\\" statement. This will only return rows where the condition specified after the statement is true, this is usually an equals operator with primary keys. You can also use the \\"WHERE\\" statement to specify that only rows with column values statisfying a certain condition, should be returned. The \\"GROUP BY\\" statement will group rows together that have equal column values for whatever columns follows the statement. The \\"HAVING\\" statement will return groups that statisfy whatever condition follows the statement. Any column(s) being returned from grouped rows must either be an aggregate function, (AVG, MAX, COUNT, SUM, ...) of a column, or the column(s) that the data was grouped by. To sort the returned data you can use the \\"ORDER BY\\" command which will order the data by whatever aggregate function or column follows the statement. The \\"DESC\\" statement will sort in descending order and the \\"ASC\\" statement will sort in ascending order. Finally, you can use the \\"LIMIT\\" statement to return a certain number of rows. When \\"*\\" is used in an SQL statement every column is returned. For example, SELECT * FROM table WHERE attribute = 1, will select every column from rows with the attribute column equal to 1.

Bea received a very special treatment when she was four years old, which would allow her to be like a normal child if successful. After that, she spent two weeks in ICU before living for four months on a separate ward . Bea was allowed home in February but still needed a special tube in her nose to send in medicines every two days. Her parents clean the house from top to bottom every two days and hoover each morning to make sure Bea is free from any possible bacteria. Anna, Bea's mother, said, \\"she is weak but so strong.

He is sent to China by his guru, who requests him to stop the spread of a pandemic disease existing there from spreading to India.

He begins to teach them how to cure many diseases, the skills of hypnotism and the physical training of the Shaolin monks that led to the creation of Shaolinquan. However, after several years, when he expresses his desire to return to India, the villagers plot to poison him and bury him near the temple, believing that their place would be disease free if he is buried there.

How does this story end? Washington (CNN) -- When the government investigates the alleged unauthorized release of sensitive information, the focus is normally on the person doing the leaking. But the criminal case against a State Department contractor escalated dramatically, putting the spotlight on the person reportedly receiving those communications -- Fox News reporter James Rosen. The complex layer of once-secret search warrants for e-mails and phone records involving Rosen have raised constitutional concerns about press freedoms, balanced against national security. The investigation of that adviser, Stephen Jin-Woo Kim, and a separate probe involving clandestine searches of Associated Press records, has prompted President Barack Obama to order a review of the federal government's practices involving leaks of classified material. The affidavit involving the","output":"Kim-Rosen case dates back to June 2009, when Rosen, a chief Washington correspondent for Fox News, reported on North Korea's intention to conduct further nuclear tests in response to the United Nations' new sanctions. This information was classified, and when the story was published, federal investigators launched an extensive investigation, suspecting the unauthorized leak of sensitive information. Stephen Jin-Woo Kim, a State Department contractor with access to classified information, quickly became the primary suspect. The investigation increasingly focused on Rosen, as well, for his alleged solicitation and receipt of the leaked data. This shift led to scrutiny of the federal government's handling of press freedoms, raising questions about the delicate balance between the freedom of the press and the need to protect national security. The Obama administration was criticized for its aggressive pursuit of journalists and leakers, particularly given that no charges were ever filed against Rosen. Free press advocates argued that the government's investigators overstepped their bounds, while national security proponents maintained that the threat posed by such leaks necessitated a thorough response. Facing mounting pressure, President Obama issued an order to review the federal government's practices related to leaks of classified material. In response, Attorney General Eric Holder initiated a series of meetings with major media organizations to discuss the issue and develop a set of guidelines that would foster a more transparent and restrained approach to investigations involving journalists and their sources. These guidelines were subsequently released, stating that the Justice Department would not prosecute journalists for simply doing their job, and that the federal government would pursue a more balanced approach to protect both national security and freedom of the press. In a surprising turn of events, it was revealed through government leaks that the North Korean regime had manipulated the situation, feeding false information to Kim and deliberately orchestrating the leak. This revelation prompted further scrutiny of the North Korean regime and its large-scale disinformation campaigns. As the case reached its conclusion in 2014, Stephen Jin-Woo Kim pled guilty to a single count of unauthorized disclosure of national defense information. He was sentenced to 13 months in prison, followed by a year of supervised release. Although Rosen was never charged, the controversy surrounding his involvement in the case had lasting effects on the relationship between the press and the U.S. government and raised public awareness of the importance of journalistic freedom. The subsequent review of the government's practices led to a shift in the approach to handling leaks, with increased emphasis on transparency and restraint. This cultural shift ultimately helped to strengthen the balance between safeguarding national security and upholding freedom of the press in the United States. In the years following the case, debates on the role of journalism and the responsibilities that come with it continue to shape conversations around press freedom and national security. However, the Kim-Rosen affair is remembered as a pivotal moment that sparked a reevaluation of the government's investigative practices and inspired a renewed commitment to the protection of the press's constitutional rights."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

In a hugely significant move, Oxford University will create a new school of government in 2012 following aPS75 million donation by Leonard Blavatnik, the American industrialist and philanthropist .The school is intended to train outstanding graduates from across the world in the skills and responsibilities of government.The move is being backed by world leaders including Nelson Mandela, Bill Clinton and Kofi Annan. Andrew Hamilton, Oxford's vice - chancellor, said: \\"The school represents a huge milestone in Oxford's history.It will give tomorrow leaders the best of Oxford's traditional strengths alongside new and practical ways of understanding and meeting the challenges of good governance. \\"The university has educated 26 British Prime Ministers and over 30 other world leaders, yet until how the major international schools of government have all been outside Europe, principally in the United States.\\" Under plans, the Blavatnik School of Government will provide a series of practical courses leading to a Master's degree.It will cover a range of subjects including the humanities, social sciences, law, science, technology, health, finance, energy and security policy. Oxford said Mr Blavatnik's donation was one of the most generous in the university' s 900 year history The university itself will be investing an additionalPS26m in the school, as well as land in the Radcliffe Observatory Quarter, where the school will be located. Lord Patten, Oxford's chancellor, said: \\"This is a once - in - a - century opportunity for Oxford through the Blavatnik donation, Oxford will now become the world's leading centre for the training of future leaders in government and public policy - and in ways that take proper account of the very different additions, institutions and cultures that those leaders will serve.It is an important moment for the future good government throughout the world.\\"   Question: What is the text mainly about?

Question: The aging rockstar had to finally stop playing guitar, his hands just wouldn't cooperate because of the what? Options: - singing - arthritis - listening to music - making music - playing music  Explain why a human would choose \\"arthritis\\" to answer the question above: The answer to this question is:","output":"\\"arthritis.\\" A human would choose \\"arthritis\\" to answer the question above because it is the most plausible and logical reason for the aging rockstar's inability to continue playing guitar. Arthritis is a medical condition that affects the joints, causing pain, stiffness, and reduced mobility in the affected area. As people age, the risk of developing arthritis increases, and it can become an increasingly debilitating condition for those who suffer from it. The other options provided in the question are not as relevant or logical in this context. Singing, listening to music, making music, and playing music are all activities that can be associated with being a rockstar, but they do not specifically relate to the physical impairment of hand function that would limit the ability to play the guitar. Arthritis, on the other hand, directly affects the joints and mobility of the fingers and wrists, which are crucial for guitar playing. As a result, the rockstar's hands would have difficulty cooperating due to the pain and stiffness caused by arthritis, making it difficult or impossible to perform with the same level of skill and dexterity as before. Furthermore, arthritis is a common ailment among the elderly, and since the question mentions that the rockstar is aging, it makes sense that arthritis would be a potential contributor to the decline in their ability to play guitar. In conclusion, a human would choose \\"arthritis\\" as the answer to the question because it is the most plausible and logically relevant option in explaining why the aging rockstar could no longer continue playing guitar due to problems with their hands. This choice is justified by the fact that arthritis is a common medical condition that can lead to difficulties with mobility and dexterity, particularly as people age, which directly impacts an individual's capacity to play a musical instrument like the guitar."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Aber eCall ist ein System, das die Unfallfolgeschäden dramatisch reduzieren kann. eCall ist auch ein System, das dazu beitragen kann, dass es tatsächlich eine breite Allianz gibt zwischen der Kommission, den Mitgliedstaaten, der Automobilindustrie, den Telekommunikationsunternehmen, den Versicherungen und natürlich auch den Notrufdiensten. Could you please translate this to English?","output":"eCall can contribute to reducing this number. We are very well aware that eCall is not a target for accident prevention, and we absolutely have to improve in this area, both now and in the future. But eCall is a system that can dramatically reduce the after-effects of accidents. eCall is also a system that can contribute to creating a broad alliance between the Commission, member states, the automotive industry, telecommunications companies, insurance providers, and of course, the emergency services. eCall is a system that uses technology to assist drivers and passengers in the event of a vehicle collision or other road emergency. It is equipped with a series of sensors that detect an impact which may cause airbag deployment or a sudden change in speed. In the event of such an occurrence, the eCall system automatically sends a standardised minimum set of data (MSD) to the nearest emergency center with information about the incident, like time, precise location, and the direction of travel before the accident. This immediate communication aids in cutting down response time of emergency services, thereby saving lives and reducing the severity of injuries. Whilst the system isn't designed to prevent accidents from occurring, it is crucial in reducing the length of time between when an accident occurs and when the emergency services arrive at the scene. Fast intervention is often key to reducing the severity of injuries sustained in an accident and, in some cases, can be the difference between life and death. Lastly, the eCall system not only benefits the individual drivers and passengers but allows for a comprehensive alliance between different sectors: the Commission, member states, the automotive industry, telecommunications companies, and insurance providers. All these sectors work in synergy thanks to the eCall system, improving road safety on the collective level, facilitating better crisis or emergency management, and even contributing to traffic management and reducing potential traffic congestions that could result from accidents."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

The second major point on which the principals had agreed on March 10 was the need to crack down on terrorist organizations and curtail their fund-raising. The embassy bombings of 1998 had focused attention on al Qaeda's finances. One result had been the creation of an NSC-led interagency committee on terrorist financing. On its recommendation, the President had designated  Bin Laden and al Qaeda as subject to sanctions under the International Emergency Economic Powers Act. This gave theTreasury Department's Office of Foreign Assets Control (OFAC) the ability to search for and freeze any  Bin Laden or al Qaeda assets that reached the U.S. financial system. But since OFAC had little information to go on, few funds were frozen. In July 1999, the President applied the same designation to the Taliban for harboring  Bin Laden. Here, OFAC had more success. It blocked more than 34 million in Taliban assets held in U.S. banks. Another 215 million in gold and 2 million in demand deposits, all belonging to the Afghan central bank and held by the Federal Reserve Bank of New York, were also frozen. After October 1999, when the State Department formally designated al Qaeda a \\"foreign terrorist organization,\\" it became the duty of U.S. banks to block its transactions and seize its funds. Neither this designation nor UN sanctions had much additional practical effect; the sanctions were easily circumvented, and there were no multilateral mechanisms to ensure that other countries' financial systems were not used as conduits for terrorist funding. Attacking the funds of an institution, even the Taliban, was easier than finding and seizing the funds of a clandestine worldwide organization like al Qaeda. Although the CIA's  Bin Laden unit had originally been inspired by the idea of studying terrorist financial links, few personnel assigned to it had any experience in financial investigations. Any terrorist-financing intelligence appeared to have been collected collaterally, as a consequence of gathering other intelligence. This attitude may have stemmed in large part from the chief of this unit, who did not believe that simply following the money from point A to point B revealed much about the terrorists' plans and intentions. As a result, the CIA placed little emphasis on terrorist financing. Nevertheless, the CIA obtained a general understanding of how al Qaeda raised money.  Question: \\"What was a result of the Embassy bombings of 1998?\\" Response: \\"The President's designation of  Bin Laden and al Qaeda as subject to sanctions\\" Choose from: (A). no; (B). yes; Does the response correctly answer the question?","output":"B. yes The response correctly answers the question because after the embassy bombings of 1998, there was a focus on al Qaeda's finances. This led to the President designating Bin Laden and al Qaeda as subject to sanctions under the International Emergency Economic Powers Act.

In addition, a strange mutation has occurred in 10% of the population, giving them minor telekinetic powers, manifested by their ability to float small objects. They are referred to as TKs. Thirty years into the future in 2074, time travel is invented, but is immediately outlawed. However, because by that point tracking technology has rendered it nearly impossible to dispose of bodies secretly, crime bosses turn to time travel to send their targets to the past (the movie's present) to be killed by \\"loopers\\": hired guns paid in silver to kill whoever is sent to them. The victims have bags over their heads, and silver bars strapped to their backs. This comes at a price: The severe sanctions on time travel mean that crime bosses eventually need to end a looper's contract, and also eliminate any traces of their working relationship, so they send his older version back to be killed by his younger self, referred to as \\"closing the loop\\", which each looper must do himself. They're paid in gold for this, to live the rest of their lives in comfort.Joseph \\"Joe\\" Simmons (Joseph Gordon-Levitt), 25, works for a mafia company in Kansas City as a looper.

Abe also controls the \\"Gat Men,\\" his muscle, led by Kid Blue (Noah Segan). Gat men are so named for their magnum revolvers, which have greater range and accuracy than a looper's 'blunderbuss' shotgun; a weapon designed strictly for close quarters.While at the club one evening, another looper announces that he has just closed his loop.

But this wasn't one of them, and he resented the implication that it was -- the implication that someone would dare to judge him for something they did not fully understand. It was a good thing, a right thing, like the time he had given emergency CPR to the woman already ten minutes dead and gone, the woman whose mouth tasted of chocolate death and scrambled eggs, just to spare her horrified children the sense of helplessness while waiting for the ambulance to arrive. That had been a noble thing like this one was. Should have been. Perhaps it was always less difficult to have things fail here, with the living, than it was with the dead. The dead had no opinions, no agendas. They weren't sensitive. The dead did what you fucking told them to do and didn't complain. Right? The living simply did not understand that there were rules.

You must generate a detailed and long answer. Sentence 1: Prudie's philosophy is the same as the very wise Carol Leifer' No pain, no pain. Sentence 2: Carol Leifer's philosophy is \\"no pain, no pain.\\" Is this second sentence entailed by the first sentence?","output":"Yes, the second sentence is entailed by the first sentence. Both sentences convey the same central idea about the philosophical alignment between Prudie and Carol Leifer. I will provide a detailed breakdown of the two sentences to further clarify this connection. In the first sentence, the subject is \\"Prudie's philosophy,\\" and the predicate is \\"is the same as the very wise Carol Leifer' No pain, no pain.\\" Here, the writer is establishing a direct equivalence between Prudie's philosophy and that of Carol Leifer, who is described as \\"very wise.\\" This equivalence is denoted by the phrase \\"the same as,\\" indicating that the two philosophies being compared share identical principles or values. The philosophy itself is then explicitly mentioned as \\"No pain, no pain.\\"  The second sentence says, \\"Carol Leifer's philosophy is 'no pain, no pain.'\\" It is a shorter and more direct statement, with a simple subject-predicate structure: the subject is \\"Carol Leifer's philosophy;\\" the predicate is \\"is 'no pain, no pain.'\\" This sentence conveys the same information—Carol Leifer's philosophy is \\"No pain, no pain\\"—but doesn't compare or equate it with anyone else's philosophy. Given the direct equivalence in philosophy mentioned in the first sentence and the defined philosophy in the second sentence, the second sentence can be considered entailed or implied by the first sentence. The information provided by the first sentence is sufficient to deduce or infer the content of the second sentence. In other words, if someone reads the first sentence, they will unquestionably glean that Carol Leifer's philosophy is \\"No pain, no pain,\\" which is the information elaborated in the second sentence."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

This is because the premise describes a scenario in which the transition of power occurred smoothly and without much conflict. Other answers are wrong because they either negate the premise or suggest that there is not enough information to form a conclusion: II.

Based on the premise \\" Until the 1960s, Sant Antoni was a fishing village tucked into the pine trees at one end of a magnificent bay.\\", can we conclude the hypothesis \\"Sant Antoni was a fishing village hidden in the pine trees at the side of a magnificent bay before 1960s.\\" is true?","output":"Based on the given premise, we can reasonably support the hypothesis that \\"Sant Antoni was a fishing village hidden in the pine trees at the side of a magnificent bay before the 1960s.\\" To further analyze this hypothesis, let us break it down into its constituent parts: 1. Sant Antoni was a fishing village. 2. Hidden in the pine trees. 3. At the side of a magnificent bay. 4. Before the 1960s. Now, let's look at the premise: \\"Until the 1960s, Sant Antoni was a fishing village tucked into the pine trees at one end of a magnificent bay.\\" Here, we can identify the following facts: 1. Sant Antoni was a fishing village (consistent with the hypothesis). 2. Tucked into the pine trees (consistent with \\"hidden in the pine trees\\" in the hypothesis). 3. At one end of a magnificent bay (consistent with \\"at the side of a magnificent bay\\" in the hypothesis). 4. Until the 1960s (consistent with \\"before the 1960s\\" in the hypothesis). Upon examining the premise, we can see that all four parts of the hypothesis are supported: 1. The premise confirms that Sant Antoni was a fishing village. 2. Using the expression \\"tucked into the pine trees,\\" the premise suggests that it was concealed or hidden among the trees. 3. By stating that the village is located at \\"one end of a magnificent bay,\\" the premise matches the idea that it was at the side of the bay. 4. The premise directly provides the time frame of \\"until the 1960s,\\" which supports the notion that this description of Sant Antoni existed before the 1960s. Therefore, based on the information provided in the premise, we can conclude that the hypothesis \\"Sant Antoni was a fishing village hidden in the pine trees at the side of a magnificent bay before the 1960s\\" is true."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Josh Groban was born in Los Angeles, California, to Lindy (nee Johnston), a school teacher, and Jack Groban, a businessman. Josh's younger brother, Chris, was born on Josh's fourth birthday. Josh's father is a descendant of Jewish immigrants from Poland and Ukraine, and converted from Judaism to Christianity upon marrying Josh's mother. Josh's mother's ancestry includes English, German, and Norwegian. In late 1998, the 17-year-old Groban was introduced by his vocal coach, Seth Riggs, to Grammy-winning producer and arranger David Foster and future manager Brian Avnet. At the time, Groban had no recording experience and was preparing to begin studying at Carnegie Mellon University. Groban worked for David Foster as a rehearsal singer on a series of high-profile events, including the January 1999 inauguration of Gray Davis as Governor of California and the 1999 Grammy Awards where--as a stand-in for Andrea Bocelli--he rehearsed Foster's \\"The Prayer\\" with Celine Dion. According to manager Avnet, Groban was very nervous about standing in for Bocelli and had to be talked into it, but his performance prompted the show hostess, Rosie O'Donnell, to ask him to appear on her show the following week, which then led to an appearance on Ally McBeal. Creator David E. Kelley created character Malcolm Wyatt for Groban in the season finale aired in May 2001. The character of Malcolm Wyatt was so popular, prompting 8,000 emails from viewers, that Groban was asked to return the next season to reprise his role and perform \\"To Where You Are.\\" Avnet claims this sequence of events effectively got Groban's career off the ground.  Groban was offered a recording contract at Warner Bros. Records through Foster's 143 Records imprint. Avnet told HitQuarters that Warner initially proved resistant to the deal because \\"They were afraid they wouldn't be able to get a voice like that on radio.\\" Explaining his reasons for signing the artist, Foster said: \\"I love his natural ability in the pop and rock arena, but I love his sense of classics even more. He's a true musical force to be reckoned with.\\" Under Foster's influence, Groban's first album focused more on classics such as \\"Gira Con Me Questa Notte\\" and \\"Alla Luce Del Sole.\\"  Groban performed \\"There For Me\\" with Sarah Brightman on her 2000-01 La Luna World Tour, and was featured on her \\"La Luna\\" concert DVD. He recorded \\"For Always\\" with Lara Fabian on the movie soundtrack to A.I.: Artificial Intelligence (2001). Groban performed in many benefit shows, including: \\"The Andre Agassi Grand Slam Event For Children,\\" singing alongside Elton John, Stevie Wonder, Don Henley, and Robin Williams; \\"Muhammad Ali's Fight Night Foundation\\" which honored Michael J. Fox and others; \\"The Family Celebration\\" (2001), which was co-hosted by President Bill Clinton and his wife, Hillary Clinton, and David E. Kelley and his wife, Michelle Pfeiffer; and Michael Milken's CapCure event, which raises funds for cancer research.  The singer's self-titled debut album Josh Groban was released on November 20, 2001. Over the next year it went from gold to double-platinum.

This store always acts like they want the customer is an inconvenience when I call. One time I got an oil change there and was there almost 4 hours, waiting.","output":"The review you've given can be identified as a negative review. There are key details that exhibit dissatisfaction with the customer service and the store's services. Firstly, the customer feels that the store's staff act as if the customer is an inconvenience when they call, suggesting unpleasant or poor customer service. Effective customer service is a critical aspect of any successful business, and this review outlines a negative experience in that regard. Businesses should prioritize making their customers feel valued and respected, and acting like the customer is an inconvenience contradicts this principle. This element of the review suggests that the customer likely felt disregarded or unappreciated, which is negative feedback. Secondly, the reviewer mentions an incident when they had to wait almost four hours for an oil change. While the time it takes to change oil can vary depending on a few factors, such as the type of vehicle and the type of oil, it usually shouldn’t take four hours under normal circumstances. Most oil changes can typically be done within an hour. This long wait time indicates inefficiency or a lack of respect for the customer's time. This experience clearly left the customer feeling unsatisfied with the service they received, contributing to their negative view of the store. Overall, these points create a picture of a customer who wasn't satisfied with the level of service they received, both in terms of direct customer service and the time efficiency of the services provided.

I can use this background: Often, foreign exchange controls can result in the creation of black markets to exchange the weaker currency for stronger currencies. This leads to a situation where the exchange rate for the foreign currency is much higher than the rate set by the government, and therefore creates a shadow currency exchange market. As such, it is unclear whether governments have the ability to enact effective exchange controls.[1]  Now, I have a new situation: On March 2015 Japans economy soared. There was a likelihood that the Japanese yen would rise in value. In the wake of this event, Japanese Government adjusted  the price of Japanese Currency Yen in accordance with the going market price. On the other hand, at he same time, UK was having economic downturn. There was a likelihood that the UK Currency Pound Sterling would go down. Fearing public backlash, UK Government kept the price of the Pound Sterling at the same level.  Answer this question please: Which currency would most likely be exchanged in the black market, Pound Sterling or Yen? Answer:","output":"In this scenario, the currency most likely to be exchanged in the black market would be the Pound Sterling. The reason for this is that the Japanese government has adjusted the price of the Japanese Yen in accordance with the going market price, reflecting its actual value in the foreign exchange market. On the other hand, the UK government has kept the price of the Pound Sterling at the same level despite the economic downturn, which could result in the official exchange rate not reflecting the actual value of the currency in the market. When the official exchange rate does not represent the true market value of a currency, it may create an opportunity for black market trading. People looking to exchange their weaker currency (in this case, the Pound Sterling) for stronger currencies might turn to the black market, where they may potentially obtain a more favorable exchange rate than the one set by the UK government. As a result, the demand for Pound Sterling in the black market would likely increase, as people seek to exchange it for other stronger currencies at a higher rate than the government-set rate. This would make the Pound Sterling the more likely currency to be exchanged in the black market in this situation."},{"instruction":"Definition: In this task, you are given an input list A.

You must generate a detailed and long answer. Fred McFeely Rogers (March 20, 1928 - February 27, 2003) was an American television personality, musician, puppeteer, writer, producer, and Presbyterian minister. Rogers was famous for creating, hosting and composing the theme music for the educational preschool television series Mister Rogers' Neighborhood (1968-2001), which featured his kind-hearted grandfatherly personality, and direct connection to his audiences. Originally trained and ordained as a minister, Rogers was displeased with the way television addressed children at the time, and made an effort to change this when he began to write for and perform on local Pittsburgh-area shows dedicated to youth. Rogers developed his own show on WQED in 1968, and it was distributed nationwide by Eastern Educational Television Network. Rogers was born in Latrobe, Pennsylvania, 40 miles (65 km) southeast of Pittsburgh, to James and Nancy Rogers; he had one sister, Elaine. Early in life, he spent much of his free time with his maternal grandfather, Fred McFeely, who had an interest in music. He would often sing along as his mother would play the piano, and he himself began playing at five. He obtained a pilot's license while still in high school.  Rogers graduated from Latrobe High School (1946). He studied at Dartmouth College (1946-48), then transferred to Rollins College in Winter Park, Florida, where he earned a B.A. in Music Composition in 1951. Rogers was also a trained general aviation pilot.  At Rollins, he met Sara Joanne Byrd (born c. 1928), an Oakland, Florida, native; they married on June 9, 1952. They had two sons, James (b. 1959) and John (b. 1961). In 1963, Rogers graduated from Pittsburgh Theological Seminary and was ordained a minister in the United Presbyterian Church in the U.S.A.  Rogers had an apartment in New York City and a summer home on Nantucket island in Massachusetts. Rogers was red-green color blind, swam every morning, and neither smoked nor drank. He was a vegetarian on ethical grounds, stating \\"I don't want to eat anything that has a mother.\\" Despite recurring rumors, he never served in the military.  His office at WQED Pittsburgh famously did not have a desk, only a sofa and armchairs, because Rogers thought a desk was \\"too much of a barrier\\". Answer this question using a quote from the following article: what did he do instead of serving in the military?","output":"Fred Rogers did not serve in the military. Instead, he focused on his education and pursued his passion for television and children's well-being. He studied at Dartmouth College and then transferred to Rollins College, where he earned a B.A. in Music Composition in 1951. He later graduated from Pittsburgh Theological Seminary in 1963 and was ordained a minister in the United Presbyterian Church in the U.S.A. Throughout his career, Rogers dedicated himself to creating, hosting, and composing the theme music for the educational preschool television series Mister Rogers' Neighborhood. His primary goal was to address the way television engaged with children at the time and make a lasting, positive impact through his programs."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Read the following context and choose the correct option to answer the question. Context: I have waited tables, but before that, our friend group were regulars at several local “open all night” establishments. Our favorite was the Denny's about ten miles outside of downtown Savannah, and we had a regular waitress that was AWESOME. As a side note, I met her several years later and found out we were a major help putting her daughter through school. We had one kid in our group who was a perpetual problem, a wannabe at everything. He just tried too freaking hard to be the center of attention. Well, he joined us ONCE in a trip to Denny's. I mean we pulled up in six cars, all packed to the gills at 3a.m. and took up almost half of the restaurant. We get done, our favorite waitress drops the check, and this goofball says something about “dine and dash.” We all just looked at him like he had grown a penis in the middle of his forehead and was trying to screw anyone within spitting distance with it. This kid wasn't driving, it would be a ten mile walk through neighborhoods that were questionable during the daytime, and he is talking about not just stiffing our favorite waitress on a tip, but walking out without paying? Are you kidding me? “Ryan. If you do that, you will be left beaten and bloody in the parking lot and EVERY ONE of us will participate.” He hanged his head and coughed up his share of the bill, but he still didn't leave a tip. She made over five bucks a head in tips every time we walked in the door. Several of us were servers, bartenders, bouncers, and a couple strippers. Tips were how a lot of us put food on the table, and chemicals in our system. We shared when we had a good night. Needless to say, Ryan never joined us on a run to Denny's again.
